Materials and methods:   Using the technique of RNA interference, the expression of CLIC1 was downregulated in the PC-3 and DU145 cell lines. MTT assay, Transwell chamber, and flow cytometry were used to determine the effect of CLIC1 on the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis ability of PC-3 and DU145 cells. The levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2), ERK1/2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 were examined by western blotting.  Results:   The results showed that the knockdown of CLIC1 exerts inhibitory effects on the proliferation and migration of PC-3 and DU145 cells. At the same time, the authors found that the knockdown of CLIC1 has no effect on the apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Meanwhile, the levels of p-ERK1/2, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were decreased in the CLIC1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) group compared with the control and vector groups.  Conclusion:   These results indicate that CLIC1 could regulate prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration by regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK pathway and offers a candidate molecular target for prostate cancer prevention and therapy.""","""['Yudong Tian', 'Yanbin Guan', 'Yongyan Jia', 'Qingjun Meng', 'Jinjian Yang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Rho-Associated Protein Kinase (ROCK) Promotes Proliferation and Migration of PC-3 and DU145 Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting LIM Kinase 1 (LIMK1) and Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2).', 'Crude extract of Euphorbia formosana inhibits the migration and invasion of DU145 human prostate cancer cells: The role of matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 inhibition via the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Shikonin inhibits prostate cancer cells metastasis by reducing matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 expression via AKT/mTOR and ROS/ERK1/2 pathways.', 'Chloride channels in cancer: Focus on chloride intracellular channel 1 and 4 (CLIC1 AND CLIC4) proteins in tumor development and as novel therapeutic targets.', 'Modulatory actions of neuropeptide Y on prostate cancer growth: role of MAP kinase/ERK 1/2 activation.', 'The Role οf Ion Channels in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Chloride Intracellular Channel 1 is a Potential Biomarker for Breast Cancer.', 'A Zn2+-triggered two-step mechanism of CLIC1 membrane insertion and activation into chloride channels.', 'CLIC1 Drives Angiogenesis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Modulating VEGFA.', 'Chloride Channels and Transporters: Roles beyond Classical Cellular Homeostatic pH or Ion Balance in Cancers.']"""

In a case-control study of 196 PCa patients and 196 age-paired healthy controls in a Chinese Han population, the association between mtDNA copy number in PBLs and PCa risk was evaluated. The relative mtDNA copy number was measured using quantitative real-time PCR; samples from three cases and two controls could not be assayed, leaving 193 cases and 194 controls for analysis. PCa patients had significantly higher mtDNA copy numbers than controls (medians 0.91 and 0.82, respectively; P<0.001). Dichotomized at the median value of mtDNA copy number in the controls, high mtDNA copy number was significantly associated with an increased risk of PCa (adjusted odds ratio= 1.85, 95% confidence interval: 1.21-2.83). A significant dose-response relationship was observed between mtDNA copy number and risk of PCa in quartile analysis (Ptrend = 0.011). Clinicopathological analysis showed that high mtDNA copy numbers in PCa patients were significantly associated with high Gleason score and advanced tumor stage, but not serum prostate-specific antigen level (P = 0.002, 0.012 and 0.544, respectively).

We examined whether hK2 protein and gene SNPs predict prostate cancer at the time of repeat biopsy.  Methods:   We prospectively offered a repeat biopsy to men with a negative prostate biopsy performed for a PSA >4.0 ng/mL or abnormal Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) between 2001-2005. We genotyped and measured serum hK2 levels in 941 men who underwent a repeat prostate biopsy. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the significance of KLK2 SNPs and hK2 levels for predicting cancer at repeat biopsy.  Results:   Of the 941 patients, 180 (19.1%) were found to have cancer. The rs198977 SNP was positively associated with cancer at repeat biopsy (OR variant T allele = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.04-3.13, p = 0.049). When combined, the odds ratio for prostate cancer for patients with high hK2 levels and the variant T-allele of rs198977 was 3.77 (95% CI: 1.94-7.32, p < 0.0001), compared to patients with low hK2 levels and the C-allele. The addition of hK2 levels and KLK2 rs198977 to the baseline predictive model did not significantly increase the area under the curve from a baseline model of 0.67 to 0.69 (p = 0.6).  Conclusions:   The KLK2 SNP rs198977 was positively associated with hK2 levels and predicts prostate cancer at the time of repeat prostate biopsy.

SPOP mutants impaired ubiquitylation of a subset of proteins in a dominant-negative fashion. Of these, DEK and TRIM24 emerged as effector substrates consistently up-regulated by SPOP mutants. We highlight DEK as a SPOP substrate that exhibited decreases in ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation resulting from heteromeric complexes of wild-type and mutant SPOP protein.

LHRH receptors are expressed on the cell membrane of many tumors, including prostate cancer. This phase I study determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AEZS-108 in men with taxane- and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) while providing additional information on the safety profile and efficacy of this agent.  Experimental design:   AEZS-108 was administered as an intravenous infusion every 21 days until progression or unacceptable toxicity in cohorts of 3 or 6 patients until the MTD was reached. Blood was collected for capture of circulating tumor cells (CTC) to visualize internalization of AEZS-108, an autofluorescent molecule.  Results:   The MTD of AEZS-108 in this cohort was 210 mg/m(2), which was lower than that seen in a phase I study conducted in women with endometrial or ovarian cancers. The dose-limiting toxicity was persistent neutropenia. Three patients had a PSA response with an additional 10 patients maintaining PSA stable disease. Of the 10 patients evaluable by RECIST criteria, 9 achieved stable disease. AEZS-108 internalization in CTCs was routinely visualized using its autofluorescence.  Conclusion:   These findings show that AEZS-108 has an acceptable safety profile and a signal of efficacy, lowering PSA in heavily pretreated patients with prostate cancer, and that internalization of AEZS-108 in prostate cancer CTCs may be a viable pharmacodynamic marker.

Bone metastasis leads to debilitating fractures and severe bone pain. It is associated with therapy resistance and rapid decline. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is standard of care for advanced prostate cancer, however, bone metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) often becomes resistant to ADT. There are few pre-clinical models to understand the interaction between the bone microenvironment and prostate cancer. Here we report the castrate resistant growth in the bone niche of PCSD1, a patient-derived intra-femoral xenograft model of prostate bone metastatic cancer treated with the anti-androgen, bicalutamide.  Methods:   PCSD1 bone-niche model was derived from a human prostate cancer femoral metastasis resected during hemiarthroplasty and serially transplanted into Rag2(-/-); γ c(-/-) mice intra-femorally (IF) or sub-cutaneously (SC). At 5 weeks post-transplantation mice received bicalutamide or vehicle control for 18 days. Tumor growth of PCSD1 was measured with calipers. PSA expression in PCSD1 xenograft tumors was determined using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Expression of AR and PSMA, were also determined with qPCR.  Results:   PCSD1 xenograft tumor growth capacity was 24 fold greater in the bone (intra-femoral, IF) than in the soft tissue (sub-cutaneous, SC) microenvironment. Treatment with the anti-androgen, bicalutamide, inhibited tumor growth in the sub-cutaneous transplantation site. However, bicalutamide was ineffective in suppressing PCSD1 tumor growth in the bone-niche. Nevertheless, bicalutamide treatment of intra-femoral tumors significantly reduced PSA expression (p < = 0.008) and increased AR (p < = 0.032) relative to control.  Conclusions:   PCSD1 tumors were castrate resistant when growing in the bone-niche compared to soft tissue. Bicalutamide had little effect on reducing tumor burden in the bone yet still decreased tumor PSA expression and increased AR expression, thus, this model closely recapitulated castrate-resistant, human prostate cancer bone metastatic disease.

Sexual activity and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among factors under scrutiny, with controversial findings to date.  Methods:   We examined the association between the number and gender of sexual partners, STIs and PCa risk in the context of PROtEuS, a population-based case-control study set amongst the mainly French-speaking population in Montreal, Canada. The study included 1590 histologically-confirmed PCa cases diagnosed in a Montreal French hospital between 2005 and 2009, and 1618 population controls ascertained from the French electoral list, Montreal residents, frequency-matched to cases by age. In-person interviews elicited information on sociodemographic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between sexually related factors and PCa risk, adjusting for age, ancestry, family history of PCa, and PCa screening history.  Results:   Subjects with more than 20 sexual partners in their lifetime had a decreased risk of PCa (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-1.00) as did subjects who specifically had more than 20 female sexual partners (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.94). By contrast, having had several male sexual partners appeared to confer some excess in risk of PCa. No association emerged for history of STIs and PCa but STIs prevalence was low.  Conclusion:   Our findings are in support of a role for the number of sexual partners in PCa development.

Given the long natural history of prostate cancer, we assessed differing graphical formats for imparting knowledge about the longitudinal risks of prostate cancer recurrence with or without 'hormone' or 'androgen deprivation' therapy.  Methods:   . Male volunteers without a history of prostate cancer were randomized to 1 of 8 risk communication instruments that depicted the likelihood of prostate cancer returning or spreading over 1, 2, and 3 years. The tools differed in format (line, pie, bar, or pictograph) and whether the graph also included no numbers, 1 number (indicating the number of affected individuals), or 2 numbers (indicting both the number affected and the number unaffected). The main outcome variables evaluated were graphical preference and knowledge.  Results:   . A total of 420 men were recruited; respondents were least familiar and experienced with pictographs (P < 0.0001), and only 10% preferred this particular format. Overall accuracy ranged from 79% to 92%, and when assessed across all graphical subtypes, the addition of numerical information did not improve verbatim knowledge (P = 0.1). Self-reported numeracy was a strong predictor of accuracy of responses (odds ratio [OR] = 2.6, P = 0.008), and the impact of high numeracy varied across graphical type, having a greater impact on line (OR = 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-16; P = 0.04) and pie charts (OR = 7.1; 95% CI = 2.6-19; P =0.01), without an impact on pictographs (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.1-1.7; P = 0.17) or bar charts (OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.1-1.8; P = 0.24).  Conclusion:   . For longitudinal presentation of risk, baseline numeracy was strongly prognostic for outcome.

Prostate tumors contain cells with different status of androgen receptor. Androgen receptor plays important roles in progression and treatment of prostate cancer. Aurora B kinase, with oncogenic potential, is involved in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, and its inhibition is a promising anti-cancer therapy. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of Aurora B inhibitor, AZD1152-HQPA, on survival and proliferation of androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cells. LNCaP was used as androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line. We explored the effects of AZD1152-HQPA on cell viability, DNA content, micronuclei formation, and expression of genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle. Moreover, the expression of Aurora B and AR were investigated in 23 benign prostatic hyperplasia and 38 prostate cancer specimens. AZD1152-HQPA treatment induced defective cell survival, polyploidy, and cell death in LNCaP cell line. Centromeric labeling with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that the loss of whole chromosomes is the origin of micronuclei, indicating on aneugenic action of AZD1152-HQPA. Treatment of AZD1152-HQPA decreased expression of AR. Moreover, we found weak positive correlations between the expression of Aurora B and AR in both benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer specimens (r = 0.25, r = 0.41). This is the first time to show that AZD1152-HQPA can be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line.

To improve the efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX) for treating chemoresistant disease, the feasibility of using nanodiamond (ND) particles was investigated. Utilizing the pH responsive properties of ND, a novel protocol for complexing NDs and DOX was developed using a pH 8.5 coupling buffer. The DOX loading efficiency, loading on the NDs, and pH responsive release characteristics were determined utilizing UV-Visible spectroscopy. The effects of the ND-DOX on HRPC cell line PC3 were evaluated with MTS and live/dead cell viability assays. ND-DOX displayed exceptional loading efficiency (95.7%) and drug loading on NDs (23.9 wt%) with optimal release at pH 4 (80%). In comparison to treatment with DOX alone, cell death significantly increased when cells were treated with ND-DOX complexes demonstrating a 50% improvement in DOX efficacy. Of the tested treatments, ND-DOX with 2.4 μg mL(-1) DOX exhibited superior efficacy (60% cell death). ND-DOX with 1.2 μg mL(-1) DOX achieved 42% cell death, which was comparable to cell death in response to 2.4 μg mL(-1) of free DOX, suggesting that NDs aid in decreasing the DOX dose necessary to achieve a chemotherapeutic efficacy.

We have previously identified several p53-activating small molecules in a cell-based screen. Two of the compounds activated p53 by causing DNA damage, but this modality was absent in the other four. We recently showed that one of these, BMH-21, inhibits RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription, causes the degradation of Pol I catalytic subunit RPA194, and has potent anticancer activity. We show here that three remaining compounds in this screen, BMH-9, BMH-22, and BMH-23, cause reorganization of nucleolar marker proteins consistent with segregation of the nucleolus, a hallmark of Pol I transcription stress. Further, the compounds destabilize RPA194 in a proteasome-dependent manner and inhibit nascent rRNA synthesis and expression of the 45S rRNA precursor. BMH-9- and BMH-22-mediated nucleolar stress was detected in ex vivo-cultured human prostate tissues indicating good tissue bioactivity. Testing of closely related analogues showed that their activities were chemically constrained. Viability screen for BMH-9, BMH-22, and BMH-23 in the NCI60 cancer cell lines showed potent anticancer activity across many tumor types. Finally, we show that the Pol I transcription stress by BMH-9, BMH-22, and BMH-23 is independent of p53 function. These results highlight the dominant impact of Pol I transcription stress on p53 pathway activation and bring forward chemically novel lead molecules for Pol I inhibition, and, potentially, cancer targeting.""","""['Karita Peltonen', 'Laureen Colis', 'Hester Liu', 'Sari Jäämaa', 'Zhewei Zhang', 'Taija Af Hällström', 'Henna M Moore', 'Paul Sirajuddin', 'Marikki Laiho']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Effective targeting of RNA polymerase I in treatment-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of pyridoquinazolinecarboxamides as RNA polymerase I inhibitors.', 'Targeting RNA Polymerase I with Hernandonine Inhibits Ribosomal RNA Synthesis and Tumor Cell Growth.', 'The nucleolus as a fundamental regulator of the p53 response and a new target for cancer therapy.', 'Targeting the nucleolus for cancer intervention.', 'Small Molecule RBI2 Disrupts Ribosome Biogenesis through Pre-rRNA Depletion.', 'PAF49: An RNA Polymerase I subunit essential for rDNA transcription and stabilization of PAF53.', ""All these screens that we've done: how functional genetic screens have informed our understanding of ribosome biogenesis."", 'Regulation of RNA Polymerase I Stability and Function.', 'RNA Polymerase I Is Uniquely Vulnerable to the Small-Molecule Inhibitor BMH-21.']"""

However, not all of the patients with PSM develop disease recurrence and the policy of adjuvant radiation could result in considerable over-treatment. We investigated the ability of early postoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) and PSA decline rates to stratify the risk of disease progression during the first weeks after the surgery thereby allowing adequate time for planning eventual adjuvant therapy.  Methods:   We studied 116 consecutive patients with the finding of PSM after RP for localized prostate cancer between 2001 and 2012. No patients were treated with radiation or hormonal therapy. An intensive postoperative PSA monitoring using ultrasensitive assay started first at day 14 after the surgery, then at day 30, 60, 90 and 180, and subsequently in 3 monthly intervals. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) presented the failure of surgical treatment and it was defined as PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml. The ability of PSA decline parameters to predict BCR was assessed using Cox regression model and area under the curve (AUC) calculation.  Results:   Overall 55 (47%) patients experienced BCR during median follow-up of 31.4 months (range 6-69). Preoperative PSA, pathologic Gleason sum and pathologic grade failed to reveal any association with observation of BCR. Postoperative PSA levels achieved significant predictive accuracy already on day 30 (AUC 0.74). PSA >0.073 ng/ml at day 30 increased significantly the risk of BCR (HR 4.35, p < 0.001). Predictive accuracy was significantly exceeded on day 60 (AUC 0.84; p < 0.001), while further enhancements on day 90 (AUC 0.84) and 180 (AUC 0.91) were not significant.  Conclusions:   The level of ultrasensitive PSA yields valuable information about the prostatectomy outcome already at the first month after the surgery and should aid risk stratification in patients with PSM.

Objective:   To validate NCMPC risk groups in a more recently diagnosed population and to develop a more sensitive prognostic model.  Design, setting, and participants:   NCMPC patients were randomized to receive continuous androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without docetaxel in the GETUG-15 phase 3 trial. Potential prognostic factors were recorded: age, performance status, Gleason score, hemoglobin (Hb), prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), metastatic localization, body mass index, and pain.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   These factors were used to develop a new prognostic model using a recursive partitioning method. Before analysis, the data were split into learning and validation sets. The outcome was overall survival (OS).  Results and limitations:   For the 385 patients included, those with good (49%), intermediate (29%), and poor (22%) prognosis had median OS of 69.0, 46.5 and 36.6 mo (p=0.001), and 5-yr survival estimates of 60.7%, 39.4%, and 32.1%, respectively (p=0.001). The most discriminatory variables in univariate analysis were ALP, pain intensity, Hb, LDH, and bone metastases. ALP was the strongest prognostic factor in discriminating patients with good or poor prognosis. In the learning set, median OS in patients with normal and abnormal ALP was 69.1 and 33.6 mo, and 5-yr survival estimates were 62.1% and 23.2%, respectively.

Objective:   To test if SNPs associated with other traits may also affect the risk of aggressive prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   SNPs implicated in any phenotype other than prostate cancer (p≤10(-7)) were identified through the catalog of published GWAS and tested in 2891 aggressive prostate cancer cases and 4592 controls from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). The 40 most significant SNPs were followed up in 4872 aggressive prostate cancer cases and 24,534 controls from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for aggressive prostate cancer were estimated.  Results and limitations:   A total of 4666 SNPs were evaluated by the BPC3. Two signals were seen in regions already reported for prostate cancer risk. rs7014346 at 8q24.21 was marginally associated with aggressive prostate cancer in the BPC3 trial (p=1.6×10(-6)), whereas after meta-analysis by PRACTICAL the summary OR was 1.21 (95% CI 1.16-1.27; p=3.22×10(-18)). rs9900242 at 17q24.3 was also marginally associated with aggressive disease in the meta-analysis (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86-0.94; p=2.5×10(-6)). Neither of these SNPs remained statistically significant when conditioning on correlated known prostate cancer SNPs. The meta-analysis by BPC3 and PRACTICAL identified a third promising signal, marked by rs16844874 at 2q34, independent of known prostate cancer loci (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.19; p=4.67×10(-5)); it has been shown that SNPs correlated with this signal affect glycine concentrations. The main limitation is the heterogeneity in the definition of aggressive prostate cancer between BPC3 and PRACTICAL.  Conclusions:   We did not identify new SNPs for aggressive prostate cancer. However, rs16844874 may provide preliminary genetic evidence on the role of the glycine pathway in prostate cancer etiology.

The primary cause of mortality and morbidity in patients is bone metastases and remodeling resulting in osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions. Recently, cabozantinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor (VEGFR2 and c-MET inhibitor), was shown to have efficacy on bone lesions in patients. In this study we tested multi-kinase inhibitors: axitinib (VEGFR inhibitor) and crizotinib (c-MET inhibitor) in a combination trial in mice models.  Methods:   VCaP-Luc cells were grown as subcutaneous implants in intact and castrated NOD-SCID-gamma (NSG) mice to confirm the androgen dependency. For bone metastasis model two cohorts of NSG mice (castrated and intact) received orthotopic injection of VCaP-Luc cells into the bone marrow cavity of left tibia. Mice were monitored weekly for tumor growth using bioluminescence imaging. Animals were randomized into 4 groups based on the tumor bioluminescence signal: vehicle, crizotinib alone, axitinib alone, crizotinib and axitinib in combination. Animals were imaged weekly by in vivo 2-D X-ray imaging to monitor bone remodeling. At the end of the study animals were euthanized and both tibias were extracted for ex vivo high-resolution 3-D micro-computed tomography (μCT) imaging.  Results:   Subcutaneous model showed that androgen stimulation may be helpful but not essential for the growth of VCaP-Luc cells. VCaP-Luc cells grown intra-tibially in intact animals caused extensive remodeling of bone with mixed osteoblastic (bone formation) and osteolytic (bone matrix dissolution) lesions. The osteoblastic lesions were predominant and at times extended beyond the tibial shaft into the surrounding tissue. In contrast, only osteolytic lesions were prominent throughout the study in castrated animals. Treatment with crizotinib alone reduced the osteolytic lesions in castrated animals. Axitinib alone reduced the osteoblastic lesions in the intact animals. Combination therapy with axitinib and crizotinib remarkably inhibited the tibial remodeling by VCaP-Luc cells which resulted in a significant reduction of both osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions.  Conclusion:   Our data show that combined inhibition of c-MET and VEGFR can be beneficial for treatment of metastatic bone disease in CRPC and that the drugs act on two different stages of the disease.""","""['Jeetendra Eswaraka', 'Anand Giddabasappa', 'Guangzhou Han', 'Kush Lalwani', 'Koleen Eisele', 'Zheng Feng', 'Timothy Affolter', 'James Christensen', 'Gang Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Combination strategy targeting VEGF and HGF/c-met in human renal cell carcinoma models.', 'Preclinical evaluation of imaging biomarkers for prostate cancer bone metastasis and response to cabozantinib.', 'Cabozantinib resolves bone scans in tumor-naïve mice harboring skeletal injuries.', 'Clinical observation of liver cancer patients treated with axitinib and cabozantinib after failed sorafenib treatment: a case report and literature review.', 'Skeletal metastases and impact of anticancer and bone-targeted agents in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting c-Met in the treatment of urologic neoplasms: Current status and challenges.', 'Ceritinib (LDK378) prevents bone loss via suppressing Akt and NF-κB-induced osteoclast formation.', 'Crizotinib synergizes with cisplatin in preclinical models of ovarian cancer.', 'The MET/Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR)-targeted Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Also Attenuates FMS-dependent Osteoclast Differentiation and Bone Destruction Induced by Prostate Cancer.', ""Targeting Met and VEGFR Axis in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: 'Game Over'?""]"""

To better understand the Hsp27 poorly-defined cytoprotective functions in cancers and increase the OGX-427 pharmacological safety, we established the Hsp27-protein interaction network using a yeast two-hybrid approach and identified 226 interaction partners.

Results of an in-depth bioinformatics network analysis allying the Hsp27 interaction map into the human interactome underlined the multifunctional character of this protein.

Wnt-1-induced secreted protein 1 (WISP-1) belongs to the CCN family (CTGF/CYR61/NOV) that plays a key role in bone formation. We found that osteoblast-conditioned medium (OBCM) stimulates migration and vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM)-1 expression in human PCa (PC3 and DU145) cells. Osteoblast transfection with WISP-1 shRNA reduced OBCM-mediated PCa migration and VCAM-1 expression. Stimulation of PCa with OBCM or WISP-1 elevated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and p38 phosphorylation. Either FAK and p38 inhibitors or siRNA abolished osteoblast-derived WISP-1-induced migration and VCAM-1 expression. Osteoblast-derived WISP-1 inhibited miR-126 expression. Moreover, miR-216 mimic reversed the WISP-1-enhanced migration and VCAM-1 expression. This study suggests that osteoblast-derived WISP-1 promotes migration and VCAM-1 expression in human PCa cells by down-regulating miR-126 expression via αvβ1 integrin, FAK, and p38 signaling pathways.

Samples were histologically categorized as positive/negative. Median follow-up time from diagnosis was 11.6 years. Nuclear Eg5-expression was significantly related to docetaxel response (p=0.036) in tissues acquired within three years before docetaxel initiation. Nuclear Eg5-expression was not related to Gleason-score (p=0.994). Survival of patients after docetaxel initiation did not differ based on nuclear Eg5-expression (p=0.540). Analyzing samples taken before hormonal therapy, overall survival and time to docetaxel use were significantly decreased in patients with nuclear Eg5-expressing tumors (p<0.01). Eg5-positive nuclei were found more frequently in T4-staged tumors (p=0.04), Gleason 8-10 tumors (p=0.08), and in metastasized tumors (p<0.01).

The objective of this study was to evaluate ECM and collagen content within normal glandular prostate tissue and glandular BPH, and to evaluate the association of clinical parameters of LUTS with collagen content.  Methods:   Fibrillar collagen and ECM content was assessed in normal prostate (48 patients) and glandular BPH nodules (24 patients) using Masson's trichrome stain and Picrosirius red stain. Second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging was used to evaluate collagen content. Additional BPH tissues (n = 47) were stained with Picrosirius red and the association between clinical parameters of BPH/LUTS and collagen content was assessed.  Results:   ECM was similar in normal prostate and BPH (p = 0.44). Total collagen content between normal prostate and glandular BPH was similar (p = 0.27), but a significant increase in thicker collagen bundles was observed in BPH (p = 0.045). Using SHG imaging, collagen content in BPH (mean intensity = 62.52; SEM = 2.74) was significantly higher than in normal prostate (51.77±3.49; p = 0.02). Total collagen content was not associated with treatment with finasteride (p = 0.47) or α-blockers (p = 0.52), pre-TURP AUA symptom index (p = 0.90), prostate-specific antigen (p = 0.86), post-void residual (PVR; p = 0.32), prostate size (p = 0.21), or post-TURP PVR (p = 0.51). Collagen content was not associated with patient age in patients with BPH, however as men aged normal prostatic tissue had a decreased proportion of thick collagen bundles.  Conclusions:   The proportion of larger bundles of collagen, but not total collagen, is increased in BPH nodules, suggesting that these large fibers may play a role in BPH/LUTS. Total collagen content is independent of clinical parameters of BPH and LUTS.

To develop effective therapeutics to improve radiosensitivity, understanding the possible pathways of radioresistance involved and the effects of a combination of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors with radiotherapy on prostate cancer (CaP) radioresistant cells is needed. We found that compared with parent CaP cells, CaP-radioresistant cells demonstrated G0/G1 and S phase arrest, activation of cell cycle check point, autophagy and DNA repair pathway proteins, and inactivation of apoptotic proteins. We also demonstrated that compared with combination of single PI3K or mTOR inhibitors (BKM120 or Rapamycin) and radiation, low-dose of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (BEZ235 or PI103) combined with radiation greatly improved treatment efficacy by repressing colony formation, inducing more apoptosis, leading to the arrest of the G2/M phase, increased double-strand break levels and less inactivation of cell cycle check point, autophagy and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)/homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway proteins in CaP-radioresistant cells. This study describes the possible pathways associated with CaP radioresistance and demonstrates the putative mechanisms of the radiosensitization effect in CaP-resistant cells in the combination treatment.

Therefore, the data from biopsy should be both reproducible across different pathologists and predictive of the true underlying tumour. We evaluated the agreement between bGS with prostatectomy Gleason score (pGS) comparing patients who underwent prostate biopsy at our hospital with those who did it at an outside facility.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy at our Hospital in 2011 and 2012. Patients were divided depending on the site of prostate biopsy. We calculated a weighted κ statistic to evaluate the concordance from bGS and pGS in the two groups and to evaluate the Gleason score (GS) concordance comparing the proportion of positive cores at biopsy.  Results:   A total of 124 patients with completed data were identified (70 patients performed biopsy at our institution and 54 at an outside facility). The weighted κ score for GS agreement was 0.40 for our Institution and 0.27 for other facilities. The weighted κ score stratified by biopsy hospital for patients with at least 30% of positive cores was 0.46 for our hospital and 0.42 for other facilities.  Conclusion:   Internal prostate biopsy predicted better pGS than outside facility biopsy reports. When the percentage of biopsy-positive cores increases, the agreement between bGS and pGS is similar between the two groups.

Thiosulfate was further measured in a multicenter approach to exclude center-related biases.  Methods:   Thiosulfate, calculated as ratio of thiosulfate to urinary creatinine (TS/Crea ratio), was measured in two cohorts in a total of 269 patients.

The second prospective cohort included 109 patients from four centers.  Results:   The median TS/Crea ratio was not statistically different between the patients with and without PCa. The receiver-operating characteristics showed that the TS/Crea ratio was unable to discriminate between patients with and without PCa in contrast to %fPSA, Phi, and PCA3. In all four centers, the low median TS/Crea ratios (<1 mmol/mol) in both patient cohorts were confirmed and thiosulfate was again not able to distinguish between them (p-values, 0.13-0.90).

These data were made representative of the entire PLCO screening arm through reweighting with weights estimated in logistic regression models. We assessed associations between smoking status, cigarettes smoked per day, and time since quitting with dichotomized marker levels using adjusted weighted logistic regression models.  Results:   Current smoking was associated with 10 inflammation markers after correcting for multiple testing, encompassing several components of the immune/inflammation response. Levels of seven of these markers (interleukin [IL]-15, IL-1RA, IL-1β, IL-16, stem cell factor, soluble interleukin 6 receptor, and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3) were lower among current smokers (n = 414) when compared with never smokers (n = 548), with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.44 to 0.27, while levels of CC motif ligand (CCL)/thymus and activation regulated chemokine (CCL17/TARC) (OR = 4.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.01 to 8.25), CCL11/EOTAXIN (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.45 to 4.55), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.29 to 4.98) were elevated. These markers were not associated with cigarettes per day among current smokers, but there were trends in IL-15, IL-1RA, IL-1β, CCL17/TARC, CCL11/EOTAXIN, and CRP levels across categories of years since quitting smoking.

Both in vitro and in vivo models of metastatic colonization were utilized to study AS regulation associated with cancer metastasis. Transcriptome profiling of prostate cancer cells and derivatives crossing in vitro or in vivo barriers of metastasis revealed splicing factors with significant gene expression changes associated with metastatic colonization. These include splicing factors known to be differentially regulated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (ESRP1, ESRP2, and RBFOX2), a cellular process critical for cancer metastasis, as well as novel findings (NOVA1 and MBNL3). Finally, RNA-seq indicated a large network of AS events regulated by multiple splicing factors with altered gene expression or protein activity. These AS events are enriched for pathways important for cell motility and signaling, and affect key regulators of the invasive phenotype such as CD44 and GRHL1.  Implications:   Transcriptome-wide remodeling of AS is an integral regulatory process underlying metastatic colonization, and AS events affect the metastatic behavior of cancer cells.""","""['Zhi-xiang Lu', 'Qin Huang', 'Juw Won Park', 'Shihao Shen', 'Lan Lin', 'Collin J Tokheim', 'Michael D Henry', 'Yi Xing']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Exon-level transcriptome profiling in murine breast cancer reveals splicing changes specific to tumors with different metastatic abilities.', 'A Systems-Level Analysis Reveals Circadian Regulation of Splicing in Colorectal Cancer.', 'The epithelial splicing factors ESRP1 and ESRP2 positively and negatively regulate diverse types of alternative splicing events.', 'Alternative splicing modulates cancer aggressiveness: role in EMT/metastasis and chemoresistance.', 'The Functional Role of Prostate Cancer Metastasis-related Micro-RNAs.', 'Therapeutic Targeting of RNA Splicing in Cancer.', 'ESPRESSO: Robust discovery and quantification of transcript isoforms from error-prone long-read RNA-seq data.', 'Investigating isoform switching in RHBDF2 and its role in neoplastic growth in breast cancer.', 'Alternative splicing downstream of EMT enhances phenotypic plasticity and malignant behavior in colon cancer.', 'The Estrogen Receptor α Signaling Pathway Controls Alternative Splicing in the Absence of Ligands in Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

We sought to identify genetic biomarkers that may predict the aggressiveness of GS 7 diseases.  Experimental design:   We genotyped 72 prostate cancer susceptibility SNPs identified in genome-wide association studies in 1,827 white men with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma. SNPs associated with disease aggressiveness were identified by comparing high-aggressive (GS ≥8) and low-aggressive (GS ≤6) cases. The significant SNPs were then tested to see whether they could further stratify GS 7 prostate cancer.  Results:   Three SNPs-rs2735839, rs10486567, and rs103294-were associated with biopsy-proven high-aggressive (GS ≥8) prostate cancer (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the frequency of the variant allele (A) at rs2735839 was significantly higher in patients with biopsy-proven GS 4+3 disease than in those with GS 3 + 4 disease (P = 0.003). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, patients carrying the A allele at rs2735839 exhibited a 1.85-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.31-2.61) increased risk of being GS 4 + 3 compared with those with GS 3 + 4. The rs2735839 is located 600 base pair downstream of the KLK3 gene (encoding PSA) on 19q13.33 and has been shown to modulate PSA level, providing strong biologic plausibility for its association with prostate cancer aggressiveness.  Conclusions:   We confirmed the association of the rs2735839 with high-aggressive prostate cancer (GS ≥8). Moreover, we reported for the first time that rs2735839 can stratify GS 7 patients, which would be clinically important for more accurately assessing the clinical behavior of the intermediate-grade prostate cancer and for tailoring personalized treatment and posttreatment management.""","""['Yonggang He', 'Jian Gu', 'Sara Strom', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Jeri Kim#', 'Xifeng Wu#']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Correction: The Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Variant rs2735839 Near KLK3 Gene Is Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer and Can Stratify Gleason Score 7 Patients.', 'Association study between common variations in some candidate genes and prostate adenocarcinoma predisposition through multi-stage approach in Iranian population.', 'Association of gene polymorphisms of KLK3 and prostate cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Kallikarein-related peptidase 3 common genetic variant and the risk of prostate cancer.', 'Fine mapping the KLK3 locus on chromosome 19q13.33 associated with prostate cancer susceptibility and PSA levels.', 'Association between KLK3 rs2735839 G/A polymorphism and serum PSA levels in Japanese men.', 'Cumulative Effect Assessment of Common Genetic Variants on Prostate Cancer: Preliminary Studies.', 'Identifying cancer tissue-of-origin by a novel machine learning method based on expression quantitative trait loci.', 'Application of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Vision & Learning for the Development of a Live Single-cell Phenotypic Biomarker Test to Predict Prostate Cancer Tumor Aggressiveness.', 'KLK3 SNP-SNP interactions for prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'Genome-wide association study of serum prostate-specific antigen levels based on 1000 Genomes imputed data in Japanese: the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study.']"""

Due to low incidence and high number of different histological subtypes, their pathogenesis and thus potential targets for their therapy remain barely investigated. Several studies revealed significant higher EPHB4 expression in malignancies such as prostate and colorectal cancer showing survival advantages for these tumor cells. Therefore we studied the expression of EPHB4 in a total of 46 clinical human specimens of different STS and human fibroblasts. EPHB4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased in synovial sarcoma. After targeting EPHB4 in fibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, liposarcoma and MFH sarcoma cell lines by siRNA or by inhibition of autophosphorylation using the specific EPHB4 kinase inhibitor NVP-BHG712 a decreased proliferation rate/vitality of synovial- and fibrosarcoma cells was observed. Silencing of EPHB4 significantly reduced the transmigration of synovial sarcoma cells towards fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In addition, we assessed the anti-metastatic effect of EPHB4 inhibition in vivo by intraperitoneal administration of the EPHB4 inhibitor in an appropriate sarcoma lung metastasis xenograft model. As result 43% of NVP-BHG712 treated mice (n = 3/7) developed pulmonary metastases whereas all control mice (n = 5) revealed lung metastases. The residual 57% of mice (n = 4/7) showed only small local tumor cell spots. Size measurements of the Vimentin positive area explained significant decrease in lung metastasis formation (p < 0.05) after EPHB4 kinase inhibition.

SPOP promotes ubiquitination and degradation of several protein substrates, including the androgen receptor (AR) coactivator SRC-3. However, the relative contributions that SPOP substrates may make to the pathophysiology of SPOP-mutant (mt) prostate adenocarcinomas are unknown. Using an unbiased bioinformatics approach, we determined that the gene expression profile of prostate adenocarcinoma cells engineered to express mt-SPOP overlaps greatly with the gene signature of both SRC-3 and AR transcriptional output, with a stronger similarity to AR than SRC-3. This finding suggests that in addition to its SRC-3-mediated effects, SPOP also exerts SRC-3-independent effects that are AR-mediated. Indeed, we found that wild-type (wt) but not prostate adenocarcinoma-associated mutants of SPOP promoted AR ubiquitination and degradation, acting directly through a SPOP-binding motif in the hinge region of AR. In support of these results, tumor xenografts composed of prostate adenocarcinoma cells expressing mt-SPOP exhibited higher AR protein levels and grew faster than tumors composed of prostate adenocarcinoma cells expressing wt-SPOP. Furthermore, genetic ablation of SPOP was sufficient to increase AR protein levels in mouse prostate. Examination of public human prostate adenocarcinoma datasets confirmed a strong link between transcriptomic profiles of mt-SPOP and AR.

For this study, a cohort of 957 PCa patients from 270 hereditary prostate cancer families of European ancestry was genotyped for a panel of 22 PCSM-associated SNPs.

Chronic arsenic exposure malignantly transforms the RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial line to chronic arsenic exposed-prostate epithelial (CAsE-PE) cells, and a derivative normal prostate stem cell (SC) line, WPE-stem to arsenic-cancer SCs (As-CSCs). The KRAS oncogene is highly overexpressed in CAsE-PE cells and activation precedes transformation, inferring mechanistic significance. As-CSCs also highly overexpress KRAS. Thus, we hypothesize KRAS activation is key in causing and maintaining an arsenic-induced malignant phenotype, and hence, KRAS knockdown (KD) may reverse this malignant phenotype. RNA interference using shRNAmirs to obtain KRAS KD was used in CAsE-PE and As-CSC cells. Cells analyzed 2 weeks post transduction showed KRAS protein decreased to 5% of control after KD, confirming stable KD. KRAS KD decreased phosphorylated ERK, indicating inhibition of RAS/ERK signaling, a proliferation/survival pathway activated with arsenic transformation. Secreted metalloproteinase (MMP) activity was increased by arsenic-induced malignant transformation, but KRAS KD from 4 weeks on decreased secreted MMP-9 activity by 50% in As-CSCs. Colony formation, a characteristic of cancer cells, was decreased in both KRAS KD transformants. KRAS KD also decreased the invasive capacity of both cell types. KRAS KD decreased proliferation in As-CSCs, consistent with loss of rapid tumor growth. Genes predicted to impact cell proliferation (eg, Cyclin D1, p16, and p21) changed accordingly in both KD cell types. Thus, KRAS silencing impacts aspects of arsenic-induced malignant phenotype, inducing loss of many typical cancer characteristics particularly in As-CSCs.""","""['Ntube N O Ngalame', 'Erik J Tokar', 'Rachel J Person', 'Michael P Waalkes']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Toxicol Sci""","""['Aberrant microRNA expression likely controls RAS oncogene activation during malignant transformation of human prostate epithelial and stem cells by arsenic.', 'Silencing KRAS Overexpression in Cadmium-Transformed Prostate Epithelial Cells Mitigates Malignant Phenotype.', 'Arsenic Alters Exosome Quantity and Cargo to Mediate Stem Cell Recruitment Into a Cancer Stem Cell-Like Phenotype.', 'Promotion of cancer cell stemness by Ras.', 'Cooperation between NRF2-mediated transcription and MDIG-dependent epigenetic modifications in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis and cancer stem cells.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Arsenic activates STAT3 signaling during the transformation of the human bronchial epithelial cells.', 'The role of autophagy in metal-induced urogenital carcinogenesis.', 'KRAS-retroviral fusion transcripts and gene amplification in arsenic-transformed, human prostate CAsE-PE cancer cells.', 'Arsenite malignantly transforms human prostate epithelial cells in vitro by gene amplification of mutated KRAS.']"""

Previously, we demonstrated that irradiated riboflavin (IR) has potential antitumoral effects against human leukemia cells (HL60), human prostate cancer cells (PC3), and mouse melanoma cells (B16F10) through a common mechanism that leads to apoptosis. Hence, we here investigated the effect of IR on 786-O cells, a known model cell line for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), which is characterized by high-risk metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. IR also induced cell death in 786-O cells by apoptosis, which was not prevented by antioxidant agents. IR treatment was characterized by downregulation of Fas ligand (TNF superfamily, member 6)/Fas (TNF receptor superfamily member 6) (FasL/Fas) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1a (TNFR1)/TNFRSF1A-associated via death domain (TRADD)/TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF) signaling pathways (the extrinsic apoptosis pathway), while the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was upregulated, as observed by an elevated Bcl-2 associated x protein/B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio, reduced cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (c-IAP1) expression, and increased expression of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). The observed cell death was caspase-dependent as proven by caspase 3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP) cleavage. IR-induced cell death was also associated with downregulation of v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homologue (avian)/protein serine/threonine kinase B/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (Src/AKT/ERK1/2) pathway and activation of p38 MAP kinase (p38) and Jun-amino-terminal kinase (JNK). Interestingly, IR treatment leads to inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and reduced expression of renal cancer aggressiveness markers caveolin-1, low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (LMWPTP), and kinase insert domain receptor (a type III receptor tyrosine kinase) (VEGFR-2).

To this end criteria were developed which are formulated as recommendations in the S3 guidelines for prostate cancer and in joint instructions of the Bundesverband Deutscher Pathologen (BDP, ""National Association of German Pathologists"") and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pathologie (DGP, ""German Society of Pathology""). In this article the findings from tumor positive prostate needle biopsies taken from various institutes in Germany, were investigated exclusively to determine to what extent the recommended parameters were followed.  Material and methods:   The study encompassed the findings from 91 patients with a mean age of 65.3 years from whom an average of 9.3 biopsy samples from different regions of the prostate were submitted. All diagnosed tumors corresponded to a standard type adenocarcinoma according to the classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) which was detected in an average of 2.5 biopsy regions per patient. The assessment was made from H & E stained serial sections which was supplemented in 11 (12.1%) cases by special staining methods and in 40 (44%) cases by immunohistochemical staining techniques. The length of the needle biopsy was documented in 88 (96.7%) cases and the tumor spread also in 88 cases. The tumor stage was reported in 16 cases (17.6%).  Results:   The Gleason grading score (GS) was reported in all 91 cases whereby the old GS was explicitly used in 1 case and the modified GS in all other cases. The allocated GS ranged from 4 to 10 whereby 8 cases were graded as ≤5, 46 as GS grade 6, 27 as GS grade 7 and 10 as GS >7. Out of 45 cases with several positive biopsy samples, 38 were uniformly graded (84.4%), 6 out of the 7 samples which were not uniformly graded were allocated a GS of 6 or 7 and 1 sample was graded as GS 6-9. In 64 cases (70.3%) the conventional 3-stage WHO grading (n=42) and the Helpap grading (n=22) were additionally used. The WHO and Helpap grading scores were found to be highly correlated with the GS grading scores and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) grading scores derived from it (χ²-test, p<0.001), although surprising allocations were selected in isolated cases.  Conclusion:   In total, the only serious deficits were that in three cases (3.3%) no information was supplied on the estimated spread of the tumor in the tumor positive biopsies because this information can be decisive for therapy decisions, particularly for the selection of an active surveillance strategy. Also a relatively large number of cases were assigned a GS score ≤ 5 which is not recommended in the modified Gleason grading. Furthermore, translation of the GS into the other grading forms used revealed that the biological assessment of the GS showed clear differences between the various participating institutes. In conclusion, the findings of the pathologists as a rule incorporated all the parameters necessary for a therapy decision in accordance with the guidelines so that they can be considered comprehensive and completely valid apart from a few exceptions.""","""['S Biesterfeld']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20094=7 prostate cancer with minimal quantity of gleason pattern 4 on needle biopsy is associated with low-risk tumor in radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Histopathology reports of findings of prostate needle biopsies.

Material and methods:   The results of small pelvic MRI in 44 patients who had medical (26 (59.1%) patients) or surgical (18 (40.9%) patients) treatment for PC were analyzed. Examinations were performed on a 1.5-Tesla superconducting MRI scanner with a multichannel phased array surface coil. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at b values of 1000 s/mm(-2) was used in addition to the standard MRI protocol in all the cases. The measurable diffusion coefficient (MDC) was calculated when estimating DWI.  Results:   Analysis of the results of DWI MRI has indicated that the criteria for the positive impact of medical treatment are a progressive decrease in the prostate volume, a reduction in a MRI signal of a tumor on isotropic DWI, and an increase in MDC. Progressive PC is suggested by a local increase in the MRI signal of a tumor on isotropic DWI and a low MDC. The study has establishes that after radical prostate vesiculectomy, the pattern of tissue masses at the site of cystourethral anastomosis should be assessed not earlier than 6 months postsurgery.

We have previously shown that (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), in the form of Polyphenon E, significantly decreases serum levels of HGF and VEGF in prostate cancer patients. Given that HGF and VEGF are secreted from surrounding tumor myofibroblasts, these observations suggested that EGCG may inhibit prostate cancer-associated myofibroblast differentiation. Herein, we demonstrate that micromolar combinations of EGCG and a second polyphenol, luteolin, synergistically inhibit TGF-β-induced myofibroblast phenotypes in prostate fibroblast cell lines, as observed primarily by potentiation of fibronectin expression. Functionally, EGCG and luteolin inhibited TGF-β-induced extracellular matrix contraction, an enhancer of tumor cell invasion. EGCG and luteolin inhibited downstream TGF-β-induced signaling, including activation of ERK and AKT, respectively, but mechanistically, only ERK appeared to be necessary for TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression. Furthermore, neither EGCG nor luteolin affected Smad signaling or nuclear translocation. Rho signaling was found to be necessary for TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression and EGCG and luteolin each reduced RhoA activation. Finally, EGCG and luteolin were shown to reverse TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression, implicating that these natural compounds may be useful not only in preventing but also in treating already activated myofibroblasts and the diseases they cause, including cancer.

However, the mechanism of androgenic regulation of Skp2 in CRPC cells was not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the androgenic regulation of Skp2 in two AR-positive CRPC cell line models, the LNCaP 104-R1 and PC-3AR Cells. The former one is an early stage androgen-independent LNCaP cells, while the later one is PC-3 cells re-expressing either wild type AR or mutant LNCaP AR. Proliferation of LNCaP 104-R1 and PC-3AR cells is not dependent on but is suppressed by androgen. We observed in this study that androgen treatment reduced protein expression of Cdk2, Cdk7, Cyclin A, cyclin H, Skp2, c-Myc, and E2F-1; lessened phosphorylation of Thr14, Tyr15, and Thr160 on Cdk2; decreased activity of Cdk2; induced protein level of p27(Kip1); and caused G1 cell cycle arrest in LNCaP 104-R1 cells and PC-3AR cells. Overexpression of Skp2 protein in LNCaP 104-R1 or PC-3AR cells partially blocked accumulation of p27(Kip1) and increased Cdk2 activity under androgen treatment, which partially blocked the androgenic suppressive effects on proliferation and cell cycle. Analyzing on-line gene array data of 214 normal and PCa samples indicated that gene expression of Skp2, Cdk2, and cyclin A positively correlates to each other, while Cdk7 negatively correlates to these genes. These observations suggested that androgen suppresses the proliferation of CRPC cells partially through inhibition of Cyclin A, Cdk2, and Skp2.""","""['John M Kokontis', 'Hui-Ping Lin', 'Shih Sheng Jiang', 'Ching-Yu Lin', 'Junichi Fukuchi', 'Richard A Hiipakka', 'Chi-Jung Chung', 'Tzu-Min Chan', 'Shutsung Liao', 'Chung-Ho Chang', 'Chih-Pin Chuu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Androgen suppresses proliferation of castration-resistant LNCaP 104-R2 prostate cancer cells through androgen receptor, Skp2, and c-Myc.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.', 'Progression of LNCaP prostate tumor cells during androgen deprivation: hormone-independent growth, repression of proliferation by androgen, and role for p27Kip1 in androgen-induced cell cycle arrest.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Moringa oleifera Lam.

Although mitochondria control energy metabolism and apoptosis, the origins and impact of cancer-associated mutations in mtDNA are unclear. In this study, we analyzed somatic alterations in mtDNA from 1675 tumors. We identified 1907 somatic substitutions, which exhibited dramatic replicative strand bias, predominantly C > T and A > G on the mitochondrial heavy strand. This strand-asymmetric signature differs from those found in nuclear cancer genomes but matches the inferred germline process shaping primate mtDNA sequence content. A number of mtDNA mutations showed considerable heterogeneity across tumor types. Missense mutations were selectively neutral and often gradually drifted towards homoplasmy over time. In contrast, mutations resulting in protein truncation undergo negative selection and were almost exclusively heteroplasmic. Our findings indicate that the endogenous mutational mechanism has far greater impact than any other external mutagens in mitochondria and is fundamentally linked to mtDNA replication.""","""['Young Seok Ju', 'Ludmil B Alexandrov', 'Moritz Gerstung', 'Inigo Martincorena', 'Serena Nik-Zainal', 'Manasa Ramakrishna', 'Helen R Davies', 'Elli Papaemmanuil', 'Gunes Gundem', 'Adam Shlien', 'Niccolo Bolli', 'Sam Behjati', 'Patrick S Tarpey', 'Jyoti Nangalia', 'Charles E Massie', 'Adam P Butler', 'Jon W Teague', 'George S Vassiliou', 'Anthony R Green', 'Ming-Qing Du', 'Ashwin Unnikrishnan', 'John E Pimanda', 'Bin Tean Teh', 'Nikhil Munshi', 'Mel Greaves', 'Paresh Vyas', 'Adel K El-Naggar', 'Tom Santarius', 'V Peter Collins', 'Richard Grundy', 'Jack A Taylor', 'D Neil Hayes', 'David Malkin;ICGC Breast Cancer Group;ICGC Chronic Myeloid Disorders Group;ICGC Prostate Cancer Group;Christopher S Foster', 'Anne Y Warren', 'Hayley C Whitaker', 'Daniel Brewer', 'Rosalind Eeles', 'Colin Cooper', 'David Neal', 'Tapio Visakorpi', 'William B Isaacs', 'G Steven Bova', 'Adrienne M Flanagan', 'P Andrew Futreal', 'Andy G Lynch', 'Patrick F Chinnery', 'Ultan McDermott', 'Michael R Stratton', 'Peter J Campbell']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Elife""","""['A replication-linked mutational gradient drives somatic mutation accumulation and influences germline polymorphisms and genome composition in mitochondrial DNA.', 'Mitochondrial DNA mutations in pancreatic cancer.', 'Mitochondrial DNA mutations in Malaysian female breast cancer patients.', 'Recent Advances in Detecting Mitochondrial DNA Heteroplasmic Variations.', 'Functional Role of Mitochondrial DNA in Cancer Progression.', 'Breast cancers as ecosystems: a metabolic perspective.', 'Mitochondrial DNA-targeted therapy: A novel approach to combat cancer.', 'Role of mitochondrial alterations in human cancer progression and cancer immunity.', 'Metastatic pattern of ovarian cancer delineated by tracing the evolution of mitochondrial DNA mutations.', 'Effectors Enabling Adaptation to Mitochondrial Complex I Loss in Hürthle Cell Carcinoma.']"""

High expression of PTOV1 was significantly associated with pathological grade (P = 0.029) and clinical stage (P = 0.001). Moreover, the results of Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that a high expression level of PTOV1 resulted in a significantly poor prognosis of EOC patients. Multivariate analysis showed that high expression of PTOV1 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P < 0.001).

We conducted a population-based, prospective cohort study of 966 patients who underwent RP at a tertiary cancer centre from 2008 to 2012. Cavernous nerve condition was evaluated on a 4-point nerve sparing score and assigned to one of three groups: bilateral sparing, unilateral resection (UNR) and bilateral nerve resection (BNR). EF was assessed pre-RP and 24-30 months post-op using a validated 5-point patient-reported scale (1 = fully rigid; 5 = no tumescence). EFR was defined as a post-op EF grade of 1-2. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, anova, chi-square, Fisher's exact test and logistic regression. Mean baseline EF was 1.84 ± 1.3 and 2.74 ± 1.5 for UNR and BNR patients respectively. Thirty-three percent of UNR patients and 13% of BNR patients exhibited EFR. Age, baseline EF were predictors of EFR. Multivariable analysis showed baseline EF was a significant predictor of EFR at 24 months for UNR. For BNR patients, pre-RP EF was the only factor predictive of EFR. Patients undergoing nerve resection still have a significant chance of achieving true EFR, with UNR surgery patients showing more potential for improvement than patients undergoing BNR surgery. Age and baseline EFR characterize recovery prospects in these two groups. Physicians should thus measure and account for baseline EF in addition to age and the degree of nerve resection when advising patients about expectations for successful EF following RP.""","""['R Krishnan', 'D Katz', 'C J Nelson', 'J P Mulhall']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Andrology""","""['Preoperative erectile function is an independent predictor for decision to spare cavernous nerves during radical prostatectomy.', 'Nightly vs on-demand sildenafil for penile rehabilitation after minimally invasive nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: results of a randomized double-blind trial with placebo.', 'Effects of tadalafil treatment on erectile function recovery following bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a randomised placebo-controlled study (REACTT).', 'Exploring the potential role of neuromodulatory drugs in radical prostatectomy patients.', 'Strategies to promote recovery of cavernous nerve function after radical prostatectomy.', 'Relaxin-2 Prevents Erectile Dysfunction by Cavernous Nerve, Endothelial and Histopathological Protection Effects in Rats with Bilateral Cavernous Nerve Injury.', 'Local continuous glial cell derived neurotrophic factor release using osmotic pump promotes parasympathetic nerve rehabilitation in an animal model of cavernous nerve injury induced erectile dysfunction.', 'Optimization of Sonic Hedgehog Delivery to the Penis from Self-Assembling Nanofiber Hydrogels to Preserve Penile Morphology after Cavernous Nerve Injury.', 'Quality of Life Following Prostatectomy as a Function of Surgery Type and Degree of Nerve Sparing.', 'Influence of multinerve-sparing, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy on the recovery of erection in Japanese patients.']"""

Methods:   Among patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our center between 2006 and 2013, we identified 577 patients (group A) who preoperatively fulfilled at least one of 6 different AS criteria. Also, we identified 217 patients (group B) with biopsy GS 3+4 but fulfilled non-GS criteria from at least one of 6 AS criteria. Designating group C as expanded group incorporating all patients in group A and B, we compared risk of unfavorable disease (pathologic GS ≥ 4+3 and/or pathologic T stage ≥ pT3a) and biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival between groups.  Results:   Rates of unfavorable disease were not significantly different between patients of group A and C who met AS criteria from 5 institutions (all p>0.05), not including University of Toronto (p < 0.001). Also BCR-free survivals were not significantly different between patients in group A and C meeting each of 6 AS criteria (all p > 0.05). Among group B, PSAD > 0.15 ng/mL/cm3 (p = 0.011) and tumor length of biopsy GS 3+4 core > 4 mm (p = 0.007) were significant predictors of unfavorable disease. When these two criteria were newly applied in defining group B, rates of unfavorable disease in group A and B was 15.6% and 14.7%, respectively (p = 0.886).  Conclusion:   Overall rate of pathologically aggressive PCa harbored by potential candidates for AS may not be increased significantly with expansion of criteria to biopsy GS 3+4 under most contemporary AS protocols.

After a comprehensive analysis of all results, we developed a new model to assess the risk of prostate cancer and an effective follow-up strategy.  Results:   Age, PSA, PV, fPSA, rate of abnormal DRE findings and rate of hypoechoic masses detected by TRUS were included in our model. A significantly greater area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was obtained in our model when compared with using PSA alone (0.782 vs. 0.566). Patients were grouped according to the value of prostate cancer risk (PCaR). In the second stage of our study, patients with PCaR>0.52 were recommended to undergo biopsies immediately while the rest of the patients continued close follow-up observation. Compared with the first stage, the detection rate of PCa in the second stage was significantly increased (33.0% vs 21.1%, p = 0.012). There was no significant difference between the two stages in distribution of the Gleason score (p = 0.808).  Conclusions:   We developed a follow-up strategy based on the new model, which reduced unnecessary prostate biopsies without delaying patients' diagnoses and treatments.""","""['Ruizhe Zhao', 'Yuan Huang', 'Gong Cheng', 'Jinliang Liu', 'Pengfei Shao', 'Chao Qin', 'Lixin Hua', 'Changjun Yin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Developing a model for forecasting Gleason score ≥7 in potential prostate cancer patients to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies.', 'Clinical usefulness of free PSA in early detection of prostate cancer.', 'The added value of percentage of free to total prostate-specific antigen, PCA3, and a kallikrein panel to the ERSPC risk calculator for prostate cancer in prescreened men.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Overdetection in screening for prostate cancer.', 'Multivariate model for predicting semen cryopreservation outcomes in a human sperm bank.', 'Developing a model for forecasting Gleason score ≥7 in potential prostate cancer patients to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies.', 'Association of serum EPCA-2 level with prostate cancer in Chinese Han population.']"""

People with severe mental illness (PSMI) are vulnerable to cancer as they are exposed to higher levels of cancer risks. Little is known about PSMI's cancer screening behavior and associated factors. The present study examined the utilization of breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening among PSMI in Hong Kong and to identify factors associated with their screening behaviors.  Method:   591 PSMI from community mental health services completed a cross-sectional survey.  Results:   The percentage of cancer screening behavior among those who met the criteria for particular screening recommendation was as follows: 20.8% for mammography; 36.5% for clinical breast examination (CBE); 40.5% for pap-smear test; 12.8% for prostate examination; and 21.6% for colorectal cancer screening. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that marital status was a significant factor for mammography, CBE, and pap-smear test; belief that cancer can be healed if found early was a significant factor for pap-smear test and colorectal screening; belief that one can have cancer without having symptoms was a significant factor for CBE and pap-smear test; belief that one will have a higher risk if a family member has had cancer was a significant factor for CBE; and self-efficacy was a significant factor for CBE and pap-smear test behavior.  Conclusions:   Cancer screening utilization among PSMI in Hong Kong is low. Beliefs about cancer and self-efficacy are associated with cancer screening behavior.

The vast majority of pancreatic cancer (PaCa) patients already have metastatic complications at the time of diagnosis, and the death rate of this lethal type of cancer has increased over the past decades. Thus, efforts at identifying novel molecularly targeted therapies are priorities. Recent studies have suggested that serotonin (5-HT) contributes to the tumor growth in a variety of cancers including prostate, colon, bladder and liver cancer. However, there is lack of evidence about the impact of 5-HT receptors on promoting pancreatic cancer. Having considered the role of 5-HT-1 receptors, especially 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D subtypes in different types of malignancies, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in PaCa growth and progression and analyze their potential as cytotoxic targets. We found that knockdown of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors expression, using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), induced significant inhibition of proliferation and clonogenicity of PaCa cells. Also, it significantly suppressed PaCa cells invasion and reduced the activity of uPAR/MMP-2 signaling and Integrin/Src/Fak-mediated signaling, as integral tumor cell pathways associated with invasion, migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Moreover, targeting 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors down-regulates zinc finger ZEB1 and Snail proteins, the hallmarks transcription factors regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), concomitantly with up-regulating of claudin-1 and E-Cadherin. In conclusion, our data suggests that 5-HT1B- and 5-HT1D- mediated signaling play an important role in the regulation of the proliferative and invasive phenotype of PaCa. It also highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting of 5-HT1B/1D receptors in the treatment of PaCa, and opens a new avenue for biomarkers identification, and valuable new therapeutic targets for managing pancreatic cancer.""","""['Nilgun Gurbuz', 'Ahmed A Ashour', 'S Neslihan Alpay', 'Bulent Ozpolat']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Down-regulation of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors inhibits proliferation, clonogenicity and invasion of human pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Down-regulation of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors inhibits proliferation, clonogenicity and invasion of human pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Elongation factor-2 kinase regulates TG2/β1 integrin/Src/uPAR pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition mediating pancreatic cancer cells invasion.', 'Pterostilbene inhibits triple-negative breast cancer metastasis via inducing microRNA-205 expression and negatively modulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'Src-mediated regulation of E-cadherin and EMT in pancreatic cancer.', 'NCAM is at the heart of reciprocal regulation of E-cadherin- and integrin-mediated adhesions via signaling modulation.', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Restore Cancer Cell Sensitivity towards T Lymphocytes Mediated Cytotoxicity in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'TPH1 and 5-HT7 Receptor Overexpression Leading to Gemcitabine-Resistance Requires Non-Canonical Permissive Action of EZH2 in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification of a Gene Prognostic Signature for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma by RNA Sequencing and Bioinformatics.', 'Stressing for sugar: a new role of serotonin for glycolysis in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Targeting Epithelial Mesenchymal Plasticity in Pancreatic Cancer: A Compendium of Preclinical Discovery in a Heterogeneous Disease.']"""

In this study, we investigated the ability of prostate tumor-derived exosomes to downregulate NKG2D expression on natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells. NKG2D is an activating cytotoxicity receptor whose aberrant loss in cancer plays an important role in immune suppression. Using flow cytometry, we found that exosomes produced by human PC cells express ligands for NKG2D on their surface. The NKG2D ligand-expressing prostate tumor-derived exosomes selectively induced downregulation of NKG2D on NK and CD8+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner, leading to impaired cytotoxic function in vitro. Consistent with these findings, patients with castration-resistant PC (CRPC) showed a significant decrease in surface NKG2D expression on circulating NK and CD8+ T cells compared to healthy individuals. Tumor-derived exosomes are likely involved in this NKG2D downregulation, since incubation of healthy lymphocytes with exosomes isolated from serum or plasma of CRPC patients triggered downregulation of NKG2D expression in effector lymphocytes. These data suggest prostate tumor-derived exosomes as down-regulators of the NKG2D-mediated cytotoxic response in PC patients, thus promoting immune suppression and tumor escape.""","""['Marie Lundholm', 'Mona Schröder', 'Olga Nagaeva', 'Vladimir Baranov', 'Anders Widmark', 'Lucia Mincheva-Nilsson', 'Pernilla Wikström']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Human tumor-derived exosomes down-modulate NKG2D expression.', 'Soluble ligands for the NKG2D receptor are released during HIV-1 infection and impair NKG2D expression and cytotoxicity of NK cells.', 'Release of Soluble Ligands for the Activating NKG2D Receptor: One More Immune Evasion Strategy Evolved by HIV-1 ?', 'Differential expression of ligands for NKG2D and DNAM-1 receptors by epithelial ovarian cancer-derived exosomes and its influence on NK cell cytotoxicity.', 'Generation of soluble NKG2D ligands: proteolytic cleavage, exosome secretion and functional implications.', 'Retroviral b-Zip protein (HBZ) contributes to the release of soluble and exosomal immune checkpoint molecules in the context of neuroinflammation.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'New insights and options into the mechanisms and effects of combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Abscopal Effect, Extracellular Vesicles and Their Immunotherapeutic Potential in Cancer Treatment.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.']"""

Unfortunately the malignancy will return to form lethal castration-recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC). The androgen receptor (AR) remains transcriptionally active in CRPC in spite of castrate levels of androgens in the blood. AR transcriptional activity resides in its N-terminal domain (NTD). Possible mechanisms of continued AR transcriptional activity may include, at least in part, expression of constitutively active splice variants of AR that lack the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Current therapies that target the AR LBD, would not be effective against these AR variants. Currently no drugs are clinically available that target the AR NTD which should be effective against these AR variants as well as full-length AR. Niphatenones were originally isolated and identified in active extracts from Niphates digitalis marine sponge. Here we begin to characterize the mechanism of niphatenones in blocking AR transcriptional activity. Both enantiomers had similar IC50 values of 6 µM for inhibiting the full-length AR in a functional transcriptional assay. However, (S)-niphatenone had significantly better activity against the AR NTD compared to (R)-niphatenone. Consistent with niphatenones binding to and inhibiting transactivation of AR NTD, niphatenones inhibited AR splice variant. Niphatenone did not affect the transcriptional activity of the related progesterone receptor, but slightly decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity and covalently bound to GR activation function-1 (AF-1) region. Niphatenone blocked N/C interactions of AR without altering either AR protein levels or its intracellular localization in response to androgen. Alkylation with glutathione suggests that niphatenones are not a feasible scaffold for further drug development.""","""['Carmen A Banuelos', 'Aaron Lal', 'Amy H Tien', 'Neel Shah', 'Yu Chi Yang', 'Nasrin R Mawji', 'Labros G Meimetis', 'Jacob Park', 'Jian Kunzhong', 'Raymond J Andersen', 'Marianne D Sadar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Discovery of drugs that directly target the intrinsically disordered region of the androgen receptor.', 'Niphatenones, glycerol ethers from the sponge Niphates digitalis block androgen receptor transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells: structure elucidation, synthesis, and biological activity.', 'An androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist for treating prostate cancer.', 'Sintokamide A Is a Novel Antagonist of Androgen Receptor That Uniquely Binds Activation Function-1 in Its Amino-terminal Domain.', 'Targeting the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor: The effective approach in therapy of CRPC.', 'Inhibiting androgen receptor splice variants with cysteine-selective irreversible covalent inhibitors to treat prostate cancer.', 'Drugging the Undruggable: Targeting the N-Terminal Domain of Nuclear Hormone Receptors.', 'An Overview of Next-Generation Androgen Receptor-Targeted Therapeutics in Development for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Eighty Years of Targeting Androgen Receptor Activity in Prostate Cancer: The Fight Goes on.', 'Discovery of drugs that directly target the intrinsically disordered region of the androgen receptor.']"""

We now describe how androgen ablation induces CXCL13 expression.

The same cells produce CXCL13 after chemotherapy. Myofibroblast activation and CXCL13 expression also occur in the normal prostate after androgen deprivation, and CXCL13 is expressed by myofibroblasts in human PC. Hypoxia activates hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and induces autocrine TGF-β signaling that promotes myofibroblast activation and CXCL13 induction. In addition to TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitors, myofibroblast activation and CXCL13 induction are blocked by phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.

Screening effects were investigated by comparing hazards before/after the introduction of mammography for breast cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer. Case siblings had higher cancer incidence than control siblings for all cancers at all ages, with overall incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 2.41 (95% confidence interval 2.14-2.71) for colorectal cancer, 2.37 (2.24-2.52) for breast cancer, 3.69 (3.46-3.93) for prostate cancer and 3.20 (2.72-3.76) for melanoma. Risks were highest in siblings who were young when the first cancer was diagnosed in the family, with siblings aged 30-40 having IRR 9.05 (3.03-27.00) for colorectal cancer and 4.30 (2.87-6.45) for breast cancer. Smoothed HRs remained fairly constant for up to 20 years except for prostate cancer, where the HR decreased steeply during the first few years. After introduction of PSA testing, men had higher incidence of prostate cancer shortly after diagnosis in a brother, but no such screening effect was found for breast cancer. Our findings can help inform the screening and counseling of family members of cancer patients.""","""['Myeongjee Lee', 'Kamila Czene', 'Paola Rebora', 'Marie Reilly']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Familial risk of cancer shortly after diagnosis of the first familial tumor.', 'Timing of familial breast cancer in sisters.', 'Prostate cancer screening, changing age-specific incidence trends and implications on familial risk.', 'Evaluation of bias in familial risk estimates: a study of common cancers using Swedish population-based registers.', 'Serial prostate specific antigen, free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio and complexed prostate specific antigen for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Evidence for familial clustering in breast cancer age of onset.', 'Joint model robustness compared with the time-varying covariate Cox model to evaluate the association between a longitudinal marker and a time-to-event endpoint.', 'Quantitative risk of positive family history in developing colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Lower Relative Contribution of Positive Family History to Colorectal Cancer Risk with Increasing Age: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 9.28 Million Individuals.']"""

Our previous animal study found decreased Nrf2 expression through promoter CpG methylation/histone modifications during prostate cancer progression in TRAMP mice. In this study, we evaluated CpG methylation of human NRF2 promoter in 27 clinical prostate cancer samples and in LNCaP cells using MAQMA analysis and bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing. Prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA) containing normal and prostate cancer tissues was studied by immunohistochemistry. Luciferase reporter assay using specific human NRF2 DNA promoter segments and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay against histone modifying proteins were performed in LNCaP cells. Three specific CpG sites in the NRF2 promoter were found to be hypermethylated in clinical prostate cancer samples (BPH<ADT-RCaP<AS-CaP). NRF2 staining in human prostate cancer TMA showed a decreasing trend for both intensity and percentage of positive cells from normal tissues to advanced-stage prostate cancer (Gleason score from 3-9). Reporter assays in the LNCaP cells containing these three CpG sites showed methylation-inhibited transcriptional activity of the NRF2 promoter. LNCaP cells treated with 5-aza/TSA restored the expression of NRF2 and NRF2 downstream target genes, decreased expression levels of DNMT and HDAC proteins, and ChIP assays showed increased RNA Pol II and H3Ac with a concomitant decrease in H3K9me3, MBD2, and MeCP2 at CpG sites of human NRF2 promoter. Taken together, these findings suggest that epigenetic modification may contribute to the regulation of transcription activity of NRF2, which could be used as prevention and treatment target of human prostate cancer.""","""['Tin Oo Khor', 'Francisco Fuentes', 'Limin Shu', 'Ximena Paredes-Gonzalez', 'Anne Yuqing Yang', 'Yue Liu', 'Dominic J Smiraglia', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'William G Nelson', 'Ah-Ng Tony Kong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Nrf2 expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms in prostate cancer of TRAMP mice.', 'Epigenetic CpG Methylation of the Promoter and Reactivation of the Expression of GSTP1 by Astaxanthin in Human Prostate LNCaP Cells.', 'Epigenetics Reactivation of Nrf2 in Prostate TRAMP C1 Cells by Curcumin Analogue FN1.', 'NRF2 modulation in TRAMP mice: an in vivo model of prostate cancer.', 'Cooperation between NRF2-mediated transcription and MDIG-dependent epigenetic modifications in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis and cancer stem cells.', 'The mechanistic insights of the antioxidant Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in oncogenesis: a deadly scenario.', 'Epigenetic effects of herbal medicine.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'Comprehensive overview of Nrf2-related epigenetic regulations involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury.', 'Oxidative Stress and Cancer Heterogeneity Orchestrate NRF2 Roles Relevant for Therapy Response.']"""

In this hospital-based case-control study, histologically confirmed 195 PCa patients and 250 unrelated healthy controls of similar ethnicity were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. The result showed that heterozygous ID (odds ratio (OR) = 1.71; p = 0.010) carrier genotype of CCL2 gene were at increased risk for developing PCa. Variant allele D carriers (ID + DD) demonstrated a 1.67-fold increased risk (OR = 1.67; p = 0.010), suggesting a dominant effect model involved in PCa risk. Similarly, variant allele D of CCL2 gene also had a higher risk (OR = 1.53; p = 0.040) for developing PCa. High risk to PCa was also observed with respect to diplotypes, I-G (OR = 1.83; Bonferroni corrected p value (P c) = 0.004) and D-A (OR = 2.11; P c = 0.004) of CCL2 I/D and -2518 (A > G).

Integrin receptor-directed cyclic peptide cRGDfk, transferrin receptor-addressing peptide B6, and epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting peptide GE11 were used in the study in DU145 prostate cancer cells that express all three receptors. Dual-receptor targeted pDNA polyplexes were designed by combining two of the above ligands at various ratios, in order to find an optimal ligand combination. Two polycation/pDNA ratios of nitrogen/phosphate (N/P) 6 and 12 were tested. Dual targeting effects were most pronounced at the lower N/P ratio and found for all three combinations. Cell binding studies and pDNA transfections revealed GE11 plus B6 as the most potent combination. In general, a good correlation of cell binding with gene transfer was observed.

We investigated the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) after ADT for prostate cancer in the Asian population.  Methods:   All prostate cancer patients who were treated primarily with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, with or without further ADT from 2000 to 2009 were reviewed. Clinical parameters including age, clinical T stage, Gleason score, hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, ischemic heart disease, history of stroke, new-onset DM, follow-up duration, form and duration of ADT were reviewed. The risk of DM after ADT was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis.  Results:   A total of 388 patients were included, consisting of 169 patients in the non-ADT group and 219 patients in the ADT group. Upon Kaplan-Meier analysis, the ADT group had a higher risk of new-onset DM (P = 0.011). Upon multivariate Cox regression analysis, dyslipidemia (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.07-5.00, P = 0.032), impaired fasting glucose (HR 5.92, 95% CI 1. 2.27-15.45, P < 0.001) and the use of ADT in the form of GnRH agonist (HR 3.34, 95% CI 1.19-9.39, P = 0.022) and bilateral orchiectomy (HR 6.49, 95% CI 1.48-28.55, P = 0.013) were associated with increased risk of new-onset DM.

The authors recently synthesized a series of GRPR-affine peptide analogs based on the 27-mer GRP and derivatized with the DOTA chelator at the N-terminus for (111)In-labeling. In this study, the authors evaluated the most promising from these series, DOTA-GRP(13-27), after radiolabeling with (177)Lu for future therapeutic applications. In addition, to improve in vivo stability of the peptide against in vivo degradation by the protease neutral endopeptidase (NEP), the authors coinjected [(177)Lu]DOTA-GRP(13-27) with the potent NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA). The authors also aimed at reducing renal uptake by coadministration of lysine.  Methods:   In vivo stability studies were performed in Swiss albino mice. Biodistribution studies were conducted in NMRI nu/nu mice bearing prostate cancer (PC)-3 xenografts. Ex vivo autoradiography was performed using frozen sections from PC-3 xenografts and kidneys.  Results and discussion:   Coadministration of PA significantly increased the percentage of intact radiopeptide in the mouse circulation. From biodistribution and ex vivo autoradiography studies, coadministration of both lysine and PA with [(177)Lu]DOTA-GRP(13-27) appeared to induce a clear improvement of tumor uptake as well as lower levels of renal radioactivity, causing a promising ninefold increase in tumor/kidney ratios.""","""['Panteleimon J Marsouvanidis', 'Marleen Melis', 'Erik de Blois', 'Wout A P Breeman', 'Eric P Krenning', 'Theodosia Maina', 'Berthold A Nock', 'Marion de Jong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Amide-to-triazole switch vs. in vivo NEP-inhibition approaches to promote radiopeptide targeting of GRPR-positive tumors.', 'Dual-Modality Imaging of Prostate Cancer with a Fluorescent and Radiogallium-Labeled Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist.', 'Comparative study on DOTA-derivatized bombesin analog labeled with 90Y and 177Lu: in vitro and in vivo evaluation.', 'Radiolabeled gastrin/CCK analogs in tumor diagnosis: towards higher stability and improved tumor targeting.', 'Lutetium-177-labeled gastrin releasing peptide receptor binding analogs: a novel approach to radionuclide therapy.', 'Trastuzumab cotreatment improves survival of mice with PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts treated with the GRPR antagonist 177 Lu-DOTAGA-PEG2 -RM26.', 'Localization of 99mTc-GRP Analogs in GRPR-Expressing Tumors: Effects of Peptide Length and Neprilysin Inhibition on Biological Responses.', 'In Vivo Stabilized SB3, an Attractive GRPR Antagonist, for Pre- and Intra-Operative Imaging for Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular imaging in neuroendocrine tumors: recent advances, controversies, unresolved issues, and roles in management.', 'Bombesin related peptides/receptors and their promising therapeutic roles in cancer imaging, targeting and treatment.']"""

Thus, hormone therapy using antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide, is a first-line treatment for the disease. Although hormone therapy initially reduces the tumor burden, many patients eventually relapse, developing tumors with acquired endocrine resistance. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying endocrine resistance is therefore a fundamental issue for the understanding and development of alternative therapeutics for advanced prostate cancer. In the present study, we performed short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated functional screening to identify genes involved in bicalutamide-mediated effects on LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Among such candidate genes selected by screening using volcano plot analysis, ribosomal protein L31 (RPL31) was found to be essential for cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression in bicalutamide-resistant LNCaP (BicR) cells, based on small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown experiments. Of note, RPL31 mRNA is more abundantly expressed in BicR cells than in parental LNCaP cells, and clinical data from ONCOMINE and The Cancer Genome Altas showed that RPL31 is overexpressed in prostate carcinomas compared with benign prostate tissues. Intriguingly, protein levels of the tumor suppressor p53 and its targets, p21 and MDM2, were increased in LNCaP and BicR cells treated with RPL31 siRNA. We observed decreased degradation of p53 protein after RPL31 knockdown. Moreover, the suppression of growth and cell cycle upon RPL31 knockdown was partially recovered with p53 siRNA treatment. These results suggest that RPL31 is involved in bicalutamide-resistant growth of prostate cancer cells.

We report that the precursor of nerve growth factor (proNGF) is overexpressed in prostate cancer and involved in the ability of prostate cancer cells to induce axonogenesis. A series of 120 prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) samples were analyzed by IHC for proNGF. ProNGF was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells, with marked expression in cancer compared with BPH. Importantly, the proNGF level positively correlated with the Gleason score (n = 104, τB = 0.51). A higher level of proNGF was observed in tumors with a Gleason score of ≥8 compared with a Gleason score of 7 and 6 (P < 0.001). In vitro, proNGF was detected in LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells and BPH-1 cells but not in RWPE-1 immortalized nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells or primary normal prostate epithelial cells. Co-culture of PC12 neuronal-like cells or 50B11 neurons with PC-3 cells resulted in neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells that was inhibited by blocking antibodies against proNGF, indicating that prostate cancer cells can induce axonogenesis via secretion of proNGF.

Preventing or inhibiting metastasis-related events through non-toxic agents could be a useful approach for lowering high mortality among PCA patients. We have earlier reported that natural flavonoid silibinin possesses strong anti-metastatic efficacy against PCA however, mechanism/s of its action still remains largely unknown. One of the major events during metastasis is the replacement of cell-cell interaction with integrins-based cell-matrix interaction that controls motility, invasiveness and survival of cancer cells. Accordingly, here we examined silibinin effect on advanced human PCA PC3 cells' interaction with extracellular matrix component fibronectin. Silibinin (50-200 μM) treatment significantly decreased the fibronectin (5 μg/ml)-induced motile morphology via targeting actin cytoskeleton organization in PC3 cells. Silibinin also decreased the fibronectin-induced cell proliferation and motility but significantly increased cell death in PC3 cells. Silibinin also inhibited the PC3 cells invasiveness in Transwell invasion assays with fibronectin or cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) serving as chemoattractant. Importantly, PC3-luc cells cultured on fibronectin showed rapid dissemination and localized in lungs following tail vein injection in athymic male nude mice; however, in silibinin-treated PC3-luc cells, dissemination and lung localization was largely compromised. Molecular analyses revealed that silibinin treatment modulated the fibronectin-induced expression of integrins (α5, αV, β1 and β3), actin-remodeling (FAK, Src, GTPases, ARP2 and cortactin), apoptosis (cPARP and cleaved caspase 3), EMT (E-cadherin and β-catenin), and cell survival (survivin and Akt) related signaling molecules in PC3 cells. Furthermore, PC3-xenograft tissue analyses confirmed the inhibitory effect of silibinin on fibronectin and integrins expression. Together, these results showed that silibinin targets PCA cells' interaction with fibronectin and inhibits their motility, invasiveness and survival; thus further supporting silibinin use in PCA intervention including its metastatic progression.""","""['Gagan Deep', 'Rahul Kumar', 'Anil K Jain', 'Chapla Agarwal', 'Rajesh Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mutat Res""","""['Role of E-cadherin in antimigratory and antiinvasive efficacy of silibinin in prostate cancer cells.', 'Silibinin prevents prostate cancer cell-mediated differentiation of naïve fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype by targeting TGF β2.', 'Silibinin inhibits prostate cancer cells- and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by targeting NFATc1, NF-κB, and AP-1 activation in RAW264.7 cells.', 'Prostate cancer prevention by silibinin.', 'Prostate cancer chemoprevention by silibinin: bench to bedside.', 'Modern aspects of the use of natural polyphenols in tumor prevention and therapy.', 'Natural products remodel cancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors.', 'Direct comparison of five different 3D extracellular matrix model systems for characterization of cancer cell migration.', 'Antiangiogenic Activity of Flavonoids: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Silibinin suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human non-small cell lung cancer cells by restraining RHBDD1.']"""

Increasing evidence suggests that disorders in iron metabolism affect tumorigenesis and tumor behaviors, and that excess tumor iron stimulates tumor progression through various mechanisms such as enhancing DNA replication and energy metabolism. Ferroportin (FPN) is the only known iron exporter in mammalian cells, and it determines global iron egress out of cells. FPN reduction leads to decreased iron efflux and increased intracellular iron that consequentially aggravates the oncogenic effects of iron. MZF-1 was recently identified as a transcription factor that regulates FPN expression. Thus far, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the MZF-1-FPN signaling in cancers are largely unknown. Here, we found a significant reduction of FPN levels in prostate tumors relative to adjacent tissues, and demonstrated a crucial role of FPN in tumor growth through controlling tumor iron concentration. Inhibition of MZF-1 expression led to reduced FPN concentration, coupled with resultant intracellular iron retention, increased iron-related cellular activities and enhanced tumor cell growth. In contrast, increase of MZF-1 expression restrained tumor cell growth by promoting FPN-driven iron egress. Importantly, we demonstrated that AP4 and c-Myb jointly modulated MZF-1 transcription, and that miR-492 was also directly involved in regulating MZF-1 concentration through binding to the 3' untranslated regions of its mRNA. These results correlate with reduced AP4 and c-Myb expression and elevated miR-492 expression found in prostate tumors as compared with adjacent tissues that resulted in diminished MZF-1 and FPN. Moreover, we demonstrated that alterations of AP4, c-Myb and miR-492 levels significantly affected tumor cell growth.

Methods:   The transgenic rat for adenocarcinoma of prostate (TRAP) model was used to investigate the modulating effects of PFJ and EA on prostate carcinogenesis. Three-week-old male transgenic rats were treated with EA or PFJ for 10 weeks. In vitro assays for cell growth, apoptosis, and Western blot were performed using the human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP (androgen-dependent), PC-3 and DU145 (androgen-independent).  Results:   PFJ decreased the incidence of adenocarcinoma in lateral prostate, and both EA and PFJ suppressed the progression of prostate carcinogenesis and induced apoptosis by caspase 3 activation in the TRAP model. In addition, the level of lipid peroxidation in ventral prostate was significantly decreased by EA treatment. EA was able to inhibit cell proliferation of LNCaP, whereas this effect was not observed in PC-3 and DU145. As with the in vivo data, EA induced apoptosis in LNCaP by increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase 3 activation.

The toxicity of arsenic varies across its different forms. While the carcinogenicity of arsenic has been confirmed, the mechanisms behind the diseases occurring after acute or chronic exposure to arsenic are not well understood. Inorganic arsenic has been confirmed as a human carcinogen that can induce skin, lung, and bladder cancer. There are also reports of its significant association to liver, prostate, and bladder cancer. Recent studies have also suggested a relationship with diabetes, neurological effects, cardiac disorders, and reproductive organs, but further studies are required to confirm these associations. The majority of research to date has examined cancer incidence after a high exposure to high concentrations of arsenic. However, numerous studies have reported various health effects caused by chronic exposure to low concentrations of arsenic. An assessment of the health effects to arsenic exposure has never been performed in the South Korean population; thus, objective estimates of exposure levels are needed. Data should be collected on the biological exposure level for the total arsenic concentration, and individual arsenic concentration by species.

We hypothesize that an increasing tumor volume within iPCa patients increases the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   We relied on RP patients treated between 1992 and 2008. Multivariable Cox regression analyses predicting BCR within patients harboring favorable pathological characteristics (≤pT2, pN0/Nx, Gleason 3 + 3). Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for BCR-free survival within iPCa patients (≤pT2, pN0/Nx, Gleason 3 + 3, tumor volume: <0.5 vs. 0.5-2.49 ml).  Results:   From 1,829 patients, 141 (7.7%) and 310 (16.9%) harbored iPCa (tumor volume: <0.5 vs. 0.5-2.49 ml), respectively. Of those, 21 (14.9%) versus 31 (10.0%) had PSA >10 ng/ml. Tumor volume achieved independent predictor status for BCR. Specifically, iPCa patients with increasing tumor volume (0.5-2.49 ml) were at higher risk of BCR after RP than those with tumor volume <0.5 ml (HR: 8.8, 95% CI: 1.2-65.9, P = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier analysis recorded superior BCR-free survival in iPCa patients with lower tumor volume (<0.5 ml) (log-rank P = 0.009). The 10-year cancer-specific death rate was 0 versus 0.5%.  Conclusions:   Contemporary iPCa definition incorporates intermediate and high-risk patients (PSA: 10-20 and >20 ng/ml). Despite most favorable pathological characteristics, iPCa patients are not devoid of BCR after RP. Moreover, iPCa patients were at higher risk of BCR, when increasing tumor volume up to 2.49 ml was at play. Taken together the contemporary concept of iPCa is suboptimal. Especially, an increased tumor volume threshold for defining iPCa cannot be recommended according to our data.

We report contemporary outcomes of salvage focal cryoablation for locally recurrent PCa after radiotherapy within the Cryo On-Line Data (COLD) Registry.  Methods:   We queried the COLD Registry to identify patients diagnosed as locally recurrent PCa after radiotherapy and treated with salvage focal cryoablation. Patients with hormone ablation after cryotherapy were excluded. The biochemical disease-free survival and morbidities were analyzed. Biochemical failure was defined using the Phoenix definition.  Results:   From 2002 to 2012, 91 patients with biopsy-proven radio-recurrent PCa underwent salvage focal cryoablation with curative intent. The biochemical disease-free survival rates were 95.3%, 72.4%, and 46.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Positive biopsies after salvage focal cryoablation were observed in four of 14 patients who underwent biopsy (28.6%). Rectourethral fistula was observed in three cases (3.3%). Urinary retention was observed in six cases (6.6%). Incontinence (requiring pad use) was reported in five cases (5.5%). Intercourse was reported in 10 of 20 patients (50%) who reported potency before salvage focal cryoablation.  Conclusions:   The outcomes from this observational study indicate that salvage focal cryoablation can be an effective treatment with encouraging potency preservation for patients with locally recurrent PCa after radiotherapy. However, other morbidity including rectourethral fistula and incontinence are not clearly lower than for patients treated with salvage whole gland cryoablation.

Current practices for treatment of prostate cancer are less than satisfactory because of metastasis and recurrence, which are primarily attributed to angiogenesis. Hence, anti-angiogenesis treatment is becoming a promising new approach for prostate cancer therapy. In addition to treating acute promyelocytic leukemia, arsenic trioxide (As2 O3 ) suppresses other solid tumors, including prostate cancer. However, the effects of As2 O3 on angiogenesis in prostate cancer cells, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, As2 O3 attenuated angiogenic ability through microRNA-155 (miR-155)-mediated inhibition of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)/SMAD signal pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 and LNCaP cells in vitro and in vivo. Briefly, As2 O3 inhibited the activations/expressions of both TGFβ-induced and endogenous SMAD2/3. Furthermore, As2 O3 improved the expression of miR-155 via DNA-demethylation. MiR-155, which targeted the SMAD2-3'UTR, decreased the expression and function of SMAD2. Knockdown of miR-155 abolished the As2 O3 -induced inhibitions of the TGF-β/SMAD2 signaling, the vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and angiogenesis. Through understanding a novel mechanism whereby As2 O3 inhibits angiogenic potential of prostate cancer cells, our study would help in the development of As2 O3 as a potential chemopreventive agent when used alone or in combination with other current anticancer drugs.""","""['Hui Ji', 'Yuan Li', 'Fei Jiang', 'Xingxing Wang', 'Jianping Zhang', 'Jian Shen', 'Xiaojun Yang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Inhibition of TGF-β/SMAD3/NF-κB signaling by microRNA-491 is involved in arsenic trioxide-induced anti-angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Inhibition of the cancer stem cells-like properties by arsenic trioxide, involved in the attenuation of endogenous transforming growth factor beta signal.', 'The repressive effect of miR-148a on TGF beta-SMADs signal pathway is involved in the glabridin-induced inhibition of the cancer stem cells-like properties in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'TGF-betal/Smad signaling in prostate cancer.', 'TGF-beta/Smad in prostate cancer: an update.', 'The interaction between miRNAs and hazardous materials.', 'Arsenic impairs stem cell differentiation via the Hippo signaling pathway.', 'Epigenetic regulation of dental-derived stem cells and their application in pulp and periodontal regeneration.', 'Targeting Cell Death Mechanism Specifically in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Combined anticancer effects of simvastatin and arsenic trioxide on prostate cancer cell lines via downregulation of the VEGF and OPN isoforms genes.']"""

The product of human BRCA2, BRCA2 protein, has a key role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and interstrand cross-links by RAD51-mediated homologous recombination. Here, we present a biochemical and structural characterization of full-length (3,418 amino acid) BRCA2, alone and in complex with RAD51. We show that BRCA2 facilitates nucleation of RAD51 filaments at multiple sites on single-stranded DNA.

Algebraic reconstruction with sparsity regularizers as well as local denoising methods has not significantly improved the soft tissue conspicuity. The authors aim to utilize a nonlocal means denoising method and texture enhancement to recover the soft tissue information in MVCT (DeTECT).  Methods:   A block matching 3D (BM3D) algorithm was adapted to reduce the noise while keeping the texture information of the MVCT images. Following imaging denoising, a saliency map was created to further enhance visual conspicuity of low contrast structures. In this study, BM3D and saliency maps were applied to MVCT images of a CT imaging quality phantom, a head and neck, and four prostate patients. Following these steps, the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were quantified.  Results:   By applying BM3D denoising and saliency map, postprocessed MVCT images show remarkable improvements in imaging contrast without compromising resolution. For the head and neck patient, the difficult-to-see lymph nodes and vein in the carotid space in the original MVCT image became conspicuous in DeTECT. For the prostate patients, the ambiguous boundary between the bladder and the prostate in the original MVCT was clarified. The CNRs of phantom low contrast inserts were improved from 1.48 and 3.8 to 13.67 and 16.17, respectively. The CNRs of two regions-of-interest were improved from 1.5 and 3.17 to 3.14 and 15.76, respectively, for the head and neck patient. DeTECT also increased the CNR of prostate from 0.13 to 1.46 for the four prostate patients. The results are substantially better than a local denoising method using anisotropic diffusion.  Conclusions:   The authors showed that it is feasible to extract more soft tissue contrast information from the noisy MVCT images using a nonlocal means 3D block matching method in combination with saliency maps, revealing information that was originally unperceivable to human observers.""","""['Ke Sheng', 'Shuiping Gou', 'Jiaolong Wu', 'Sharon X Qi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Technical Note: Iterative megavoltage CT (MVCT) reconstruction using block-matching 3D-transform (BM3D) regularization.', 'A Megavoltage CT Image Enhancement Method for Image-Guided and Adaptive Helical TomoTherapy.', 'Deformable registration of the planning image (kVCT) and the daily images (MVCT) for adaptive radiation therapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of normalized metal artifact reduction in kVCT using MVCT prior images (MVCT-NMAR) for radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Denoising of polychromatic CT images based on their own noise properties.', 'Multislice input for 2D and 3D residual convolutional neural network noise reduction in CT.', 'ERA-WGAT: Edge-enhanced residual autoencoder with a window-based graph attention convolutional network for low-dose CT denoising.', 'Generation of synthetic megavoltage CT for MRI-only radiotherapy treatment planning using a 3D deep convolutional neural network.', 'Low-dose computed tomography image reconstruction via a multistage convolutional neural network with autoencoder perceptual loss network.', 'Improved contrast and noise of megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) through cycle-consistent generative machine learning.']"""

Methods:   Nineteen prostate cancer patients with 8-13 prostate CT images of each patient were used to model patient-specific interfraction deformable organ changes. The model was based on the principal component analysis (PCA) method and was used to predict the patient geometries for virtual treatment course simulation. For each patient, an IMRT plan using zero margin on target structures, prostate (CTVprostate) and seminal vesicles (CTVSV), were created, then evaluated by simulating 1000 30-fraction virtual treatment courses. Each fraction was prostate centroid aligned. Patients whose D98 failed to achieve 95% coverage probability objective D98,95 ≥ 78 Gy (CTVprostate) or D98,95 ≥ 66 Gy (CTVSV) were replanned using planning techniques: (1) FM (PTVprostate = CTVprostate + 5 mm, PTVSV = CTVSV + 8 mm), (2) CPOM which optimized uniform PTV margins for CTVprostate and CTVSV to meet the coverage probability objective, and (3) CPCOP which directly optimized coverage probability objectives for all structures of interest. These plans were intercompared by computing probabilistic metrics, including 5% and 95% percentile DVHs (pDVH) and TCP/NTCP distributions.  Results:   All patients were replanned using FM and two CP techniques. The selected margins used in FM failed to ensure target coverage for 8/19 patients. Twelve CPOM plans and seven CPCOP plans were favored over the other plans by achieving desirable D98,95 while sparing more normal tissues.

Associated with the anisotropic dose distribution of seeds, these orientations could cause dose differences between the planning configurations and the clinical postplanning dosimetry. This study will quantify the impact of seed orientation on the dosimetry.  Methods:   3D seed positions and θ and φ polar angles were obtained using five independent fluoroscopic images for 287 patients. Five dose calculation methods are compared: TG43-1D (1), TG43-2D parallel to implant axis (2) and with orientations (3), Monte Carlo (MC) simulations parallel (4), and MC simulations with orientations (5). GEANT4 v4.9.6 MC simulations were made in 1 mm(3) voxelized geometries based on the DICOM-RT information. Materials were assigned using thresholds based on the HU number, as recommended in TG186 reports. Seed voxels are overridden with prostatic materials and the layered mass geometry [Enger et al., Phys. Med.

Results:   The various seed orientations do not result in statistically significant differences on the dose metrics for the clinical target volume (CTV) or the urethra, based on the Student t-test p-value. Difference as low as -0.238% and 0.059% has been seen on the CTV D90, respectively, for the MC and the TG43. The difference between parallel and oriented calculations for the organs at risk (OARs) can differ by 2% on average.

This system is capable of detecting plan transfer and delivery errors and evaluating the dosimetric impact of those errors.  Methods:   The authors' QA process, MCLogQA, utilizes an independent pretreatment MC secondary dose calculation and postdelivery TomoTherapy exit detector-based MLC sinogram comparison and log file examination to confirm accurate dose calculation, accurate dose delivery, and to verify machine performance. MC radiation transport simulations are performed to estimate patient dose utilizing prestored treatment machine-specific phase-space information, the patient's planning CT, and MLC sinogram data. Sinogram data are generated from both the treatment planning system (MC_TPS) and from beam delivery log files (MC_Log). TomoTherapy treatment planning dose (DTPS) is compared with DMC_TPS and DMC_Log via dose-volume metrics and mean region of interest dose statistics. For validation, in-phantom ionization chamber dose measurements (DIC) for ten sample patient plans are compared with the computed values.  Results:   Dose comparisons to in-phantom ion chamber measurements validate the capability of the MCLogQA method to detect delivery errors. DMC_Log agreed with DIC within 1%, while DTPS values varied by 2%-5% compared to DIC. The authors demonstrated that TomoTherapy treatments can be vulnerable to MLC deviations and interfraction output variations during treatment delivery. Interfractional Linac output variations for each patient were approximately 2% and average output was 1%-1.5% below the gold standard. While average MLC leaf opening time error from patient to patient varied from -0.6% to 1.6%, the MLC leaf errors varied little between fractions for the same patient plan, excluding one patient.  Conclusions:   MCLogQA is a new TomoTherapy QA process that validates the planned dose before delivery and analyzes the delivered dose using the treatment exit detector and log file data. The MCLogQA procedure is an effective and efficient alternative to traditional phantom-based TomoTherapy plan-specific QA because it allows for comprehensive 3D dose verification, accounts for tissue heterogeneity, uses patient CT density tables, reduces total QA time, and provides for a comprehensive QA methodology for each treatment fraction.""","""['Lydia L Handsfield', 'Ryan Jones', 'David D Wilson', 'Jeffery V Siebers', 'Paul W Read', 'Quan Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Detection of dose delivery variations on TomoTherapy using on-board detector based verification.', 'A method to reconstruct and apply 3D primary fluence for treatment delivery verification.', 'Monte Carlo based IMRT dose verification using MLC log files and R/V outputs.', 'Tolerance limits and methodologies for IMRT measurement-based verification QA: Recommendations of AAPM Task Group No. 218.', 'Monte Carlo simulation for MLC-based intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Development of Automated Delivery Quality Assurance Analysis Software for Helical Tomotherapy.', 'Novel methodologies for dosimetry audits: Adapting to advanced radiotherapy techniques.', 'An Automated knowledge-based planning routine for stereotactic body radiotherapy of peripheral lung tumors via DCA-based volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Leaf open time sinogram (LOTS): a novel approach for patient specific quality assurance of total marrow irradiation.', 'Independent calculation-based verification of volumetric-modulated arc therapy-stereotactic body radiotherapy plans for lung cancer.']"""

Recent evidence suggests that PRMT5 may function as an oncogene and its overexpression contributes to the development and progression of several human cancers. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of PRMT5 expression in cancer cells remains largely unknown. In the present study, we have mapped the proximal promoter of PRMT5 to the -240bp region and identified nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y) as a critical transcription factor that binds to the two inverted CCAAT boxes and regulates PRMT5 expression in multiple cancer cell lines. Further, we present evidence that loss of PRMT5 is responsible for cell growth inhibition induced by knockdown of NF-YA, a subunit of NF-Y that forms a heterotrimeric complex with NF-YB and NF-YC for function. Significantly, we have found that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in LNCaP prostate cancer cells down-regulates the expression of NF-YA and PRMT5 at the transcription level in a c-Fos-dependent manner.

We report here a carbohydrate microarray analysis of a number of tumor-associated carbohydrates for their serum antibody reactivities and potential immunogenicity in humans. These are the precursors, cores and internal sequences of N-glycans. They are usually masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of glyco-antigens that are normally ""cryptic"". However, viral expression of these carbohydrates may trigger host immune responses. For examples, HIV-1 and SARS-CoV display Man9 clusters and tri- or multi-antennary type II (Galβ1→4GlcNAc) chains (Tri/m-II), respectively; viral neutralizing antibodies often target these sugar moieties. We asked, therefore, whether prostate tumor expression of corresponding carbohydrates triggers antibody responses in vivo. Using carbohydrate microarrays, we analyzed a panel of human sera, including 17 samples from prostate cancer patients and 12 from men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). We observed that IgG antibodies targeting the Man9- or Tri-/m-II-autoantigens are readily detectable in the sera of men with BPH, as well as those with cancer. Importantly, these antibody activities were selectively increased in prostate cancer patients. Thus, human immune systems actively recognize these N-glycan cryptic carbohydrates and produce targeting antibodies. This finding shads a light on a class of previously less studied immunological targets of human cancers.

Methods:   IL-17RC expression in human and rodent prostate tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry.

Results:   IL-17RC protein was increased in human and rodent PIN lesions, compared to the normal human and rodent prostatic epithelium.

We fabricated DNA tetrahedron-based microarrays by covalently coupling the DNA tetrahedron onto glass substrates. After their biorecognition capability was evaluated, DNA tetrahedron microarrays were utilized for the analysis of different types of bioactive molecules. The gap hybridization strategy, the sandwich configuration, and the engineering aptamer strategy were employed for the assay of miRNA biomarkers, protein cancer biomarkers, and small molecules, respectively. The arrays showed good capability to anchor capture biomolecules for improving biorecognition. Addressable and high-throughput analysis with improved sensitivity and specificity had been achieved. The limit of detection for let-7a miRNA, prostate specific antigen, and cocaine were 10 fM, 40 pg/mL, and 100 nM, respectively. More importantly, we demonstrated that the microarray platform worked well with clinical serum samples and showed good relativity with conventional chemical luminescent immunoassay.

Materials and methods:   We prospectively studied 56 patients with prostate cancer treated by surgery (n=22) or radiotherapy (n=34) who had hypermetabolic foci on 11C-choline PET/CT determined for biochemical recurrence (prostate-specific antigen 1.23-9.9 ng/ml). We used the dual-phase technique, calculating the standardized uptake value (SUV) for early (SUVearly) and late (SUVdelay) acquisitions and the difference between the two (SUVvariation) to determine whether tracer uptake remained stable or increased (accumulative pattern) or decreased (washout pattern). We used t-tests to compare mean and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (SUVearly/SUVdelay/SUVvariation vs. benign/malignant).  Results:   We identified 106 hypermetabolic foci (34 local, 10 inguinal, 34 infradiaphragmatic, 14 supradiaphragmatic, and 14 in bone). We identified 34 local foci (eight after prostatectomy and 26 after radiotherapy). The eight postsurgical foci had an accumulative pattern and recurrence was confirmed (three histology, five follow-up). Of the 26 postradiotherapy foci, three had a washout pattern and follow-up ruled out recurrence; 23 had an accumulative pattern and recurrence was confirmed (14 histology, nine follow-up). The 10 inguinal foci had a washout pattern and were reactive (three histology, seven follow-up). The 34 infradiaphragmatic foci had an accumulative pattern and were malignant (34 follow-up). Of the 14 supradiaphragmatic foci, the three with a washout pattern were benign (three histology) and the 11 with an accumulative pattern were malignant (11 histology). Of the 14 foci in bone, two had a washout pattern and corresponded with signs of spondyloarthropathy. On the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, SUVvariation best discriminated benign from malignant lesions [area under the curve (AUC)=0.993], followed by SUVdelay (AUC=0.933) and finally SUVearly (AUC=0.665).

Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models have been constructed to assess the causal role of these putative oncogenic events and provide molecular insight into disease pathogenesis. While GEM models generally initiate neoplasia by manipulating a single gene, expression profiles of GEM tumors typically comprise hundreds of transcript alterations. It is unclear whether these transcriptional changes represent the pleiotropic effects of single oncogenes, and/or cooperating genomic or epigenomic events. Therefore, it was determined whether structural chromosomal alterations occur in GEM models of prostate cancer and whether the changes are concordant with human carcinomas. Whole genome array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to identify somatic chromosomal copy number aberrations (SCNA) in the widely used TRAMP, Hi-Myc, Pten-null, and LADY GEM models. Interestingly, very few SCNAs were identified and the genomic architecture of Hi-Myc, Pten-null, and LADY tumors were essentially identical to the germline. TRAMP neuroendocrine carcinomas contained SCNAs, which comprised three recurrent aberrations including a single copy loss of chromosome 19 (encoding Pten). In contrast, cell lines derived from the TRAMP, Hi-Myc, and Pten-null tumors were notable for numerous SCNAs that included copy gains of chromosome 15 (encoding Myc) and losses of chromosome 11 (encoding p53).  Implications:   Chromosomal alterations are not a prerequisite for tumor formation in GEM prostate cancer models and cooperating events do not naturally occur by mechanisms that recapitulate changes in genomic integrity as observed in human prostate cancer.""","""['Daniella Bianchi-Frias', 'Susana A Hernandez', 'Roger Coleman', 'Hong Wu', 'Peter S Nelson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Cells Comprising the Prostate Cancer Microenvironment Lack Recurrent Clonal Somatic Genomic Aberrations.', 'Recurrent and nonrandom DNA copy number and chromosome alterations in Myc transgenic mouse model for hepatocellular carcinogenesis: implications for human disease.', 'DNA in situ hybridization (interphase cytogenetics) versus comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in human cancer: detection of numerical and structural chromosome aberrations.', 'Molecular cytogenetics of prostate cancer.', 'Chromosomal basis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Attenuation of SRC Kinase Activity Augments PARP Inhibitor-mediated Synthetic Lethality in BRCA2-altered Prostate Tumors.', 'A mouse model of prostate cancer bone metastasis in a syngeneic immunocompetent host.', 'Differential expressions of integrin-linked kinase, β-parvin and cofilin 1 in high-fat diet induced prostate cancer progression in a transgenic mouse model.', 'Characterization of novel cell lines derived from a MYC-driven murine model of lethal metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'A Bioluminescent and Fluorescent Orthotopic Syngeneic Murine Model of Androgen-dependent and Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Because castration-induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α enhances the transcriptional activity of androgen receptor (AR) at low androgen levels mimicking the castration-resistant stage, HIF-1α is expected to be a promising target for suppression of growth of CRPC. We investigated the effect of resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) on the growth of human prostate cancer LNCaP xenografts in castrated male BALB/cSlc-nu/nu mice (5 wk old). The mice were administered a control diet or a resveratrol diet (4 g/kg diet) for 40 d. The resveratrol diet significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to the control diet. In LNCaP xenografts, dietary resveratrol decreased the protein level of HIF-1α, but not the AR coactivator β-catenin, and reduced the mRNA levels of androgen-responsive genes. In the control group, β-catenin was predominantly localized in the nucleus with HIF-1α in LNCaP xenografts, whereas dietary resveratrol inhibited the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. In hypoxic LNCaP cells at a low androgen level mimicking the castration-resistant stage, hypoxia-induced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was inhibited by resveratrol. Furthermore, resveratrol repressed the expression level of HIF-1α even in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor and suppressed hypoxia-enhanced AR transactivation. These results indicate that dietary resveratrol represses nuclear localization of β-catenin by decreasing the HIF-1α expression, perhaps in a proteasome-independent manner, and inhibits β-catenin-mediated AR signaling; this contributes to suppression of tumor growth of CRPC.""","""['Takakazu Mitani', 'Naoki Harada', 'Shinji Tanimori', 'Yoshihisa Nakano', 'Hiroshi Inui', 'Ryoichi Yamaji']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo)""","""['Coordinated action of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and β-catenin in androgen receptor signaling.', 'Hypoxia enhances transcriptional activity of androgen receptor through hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in a low androgen environment.', 'Dual targeting of the androgen receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α pathways synergistically inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Adaptation to Hypoxia May Promote Therapeutic Resistance to Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Molecular Targets of Natural Compounds with Anti-Cancer Properties.', 'Hypoxia: Role of SIRT1 and the protective effect of resveratrol in ovarian function.', 'Natural Product-Based Studies for the Management of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Computational to Clinical Studies.']"""

Results:   Responses from 825 men (mean age 67.6 years and 80% treated with radical prostatectomy) were available for analysis (response 70.8%). Compared to the reference population impairments in HRQL were reported especially in terms of the roles and social functionality. The prostate-specific symptoms varied depending on the treatment strategy. A nerve-sparing surgical technique reduced the likelihood of erectile dysfunction. Other protective factors were no pre-existing comorbidities and younger age.  Discussion:   The effects of PCA on the HRQOL varied by age, comorbidities and treatment modality which should be considered in healthcare information and counseling of patients.""","""['S Henninger', 'S Neusser', 'C Lorenz', 'E M Bitzer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Erratum to: Prostate cancer in routine healthcare.

One of the projects of the COCON examines the use of CM and the information and counseling needs regarding these topics in various groups of cancer patients. The focus of this article is on the qualitative study reporting selected results for the subgroup of prostate cancer patients.  Study design and study methods:   A total of 19 semi-structured qualitative interviews with prostate cancer patients were conducted regarding the use of CM as well as their information and consultation needs.  Results:   It was found that the patients interviewed discussed various issues surrounding nutrition, particularly a healthy diet, the selective use of certain foods and the use of dietary supplements. Additional themes mentioned by interviewees were physical exercise, psychological well-being, mistletoe therapy, homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine. Patients indicated that they wanted more information and counseling opportunities with regards to CM. They also expressed a desire for more holistic care.  Conclusion:   The results show that prostate cancer patients use a range of CM and have a need for information about CM. Prostate cancer patients are in a special situation because of a regular feedback on the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value. This should be taken into consideration in consultation with prostate cancer patients regarding CM.""","""['K M Gschwendtner', 'G Klein', 'C Güthlin', 'C Holmberg', 'M Horneber', 'J Weis']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""[""Cancer patients' informational needs on health promotion and related factors: a multi-institutional, cross-sectional study in Korea."", 'Emphasizing and promoting overall health and nontraditional treatments after a prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Addressing Unmet Information Needs: Results of a Clinician-Led Consultation Service About Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Cancer Patients and Their Relatives.', 'Understanding the motivation for conventional and complementary/alternative medicine use among men with prostate cancer.', 'An Integrative Approach to Prostate Cancer.']"""

Lymphadenectomy with removal of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is now evolving towards the concept of radio guided surgery as an instrument for the removal of the lymph nodes of primary drainage.  Methods:   From October 2012 to September 2013 laparotomic SLN dissection was performed in 43 patients during standard open radical prostatectomy. Twenty hours before surgery, 240 MBq of 99mTc nanocolloid were injected into the prostate gland under transrectal ultrasound guidance. A planar scintigraphy and a SPET/CT scan were performed 1-2 hours after the injection. Intraoperatively, all LNs detected by gamma-probe with an activity significantly higher than background were removed and classified as SLNs. We evaluated operative time, complications, postoperative outcomes and costs of the procedures of patients who underwent radio guided surgery. We measured radioactive exposure rates.  Results:   The intraoperative detection of SLNs occurred in all 43 patients, while the scintigraphic localization was observed in 42/43 patients. A total of 77 SLNs were found, at histopathological analysis 7/77 SLNs resulted positive for metastases (4/43 patients): 3 were in the obturator fossa while the remaining SLNs were in the internal iliac chain (1), common iliac chain (1), external iliac chain (2). Global radiation exposure was not significant.  Conclusion:   Our preliminary data confirm the feasibility and the safety of SLN biopsy in nodal staging of PCa.

EMT also promotes malignant tumor progression and the maintenance of the stem cell property, which endows cancer cells with the capabilities of self-renewal and immortalized proliferation. The transcriptional repressor zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2), as an EMT activator, might be an important promoter of metastasis in some tumors. Here, we report that ZEB2 directly represses the transcription of miR-145, which is a strong repressor of EMT. In turn, ZEB2 is also a direct target of miR-145. Further, our findings show that the downregulation of ZEB2 not only represses invasion, migration, EMT, and the stemness of prostate cancer (PCa) cells, but also suppresses the capability of PC-3 cells to invade bone in vivo. Importantly, the expression level of ZEB2 as revealed by immunohistochemical analysis is positively correlated to bone metastasis, the serum free PSA level, the total PSA level, and the Gleason score in PCa patients and is negatively correlated with miR-145 expression in primary PCa specimens. Thus, our findings demonstrate a double-negative feedback loop between ZEB2 and miR-145 and indicate that the ZEB2/miR-145 double-negative feedback loop plays a significant role in the control of EMT and stem cell properties during the bone metastasis of PCa cells. These results suggest that the double-negative feedback loop between ZEB2 and miR-145 contributes to PCa progression and metastasis and might have therapeutic relevance for the bone metastasis of PCa.""","""['Dong Ren', 'Min Wang', 'Wei Guo', 'Shuai Huang', 'Zeyu Wang', 'Xiaohui Zhao', 'Hong Du', 'Libing Song', 'Xinsheng Peng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Tissue Res""","""['Wild-type p53 suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness in PC-3 prostate cancer cells by modulating miR‑145.', 'HEF1 promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition and bone invasion in prostate cancer under the regulation of microRNA-145.', 'MicroRNA-200b regulates cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by directly targeting ZEB2 in gastric carcinoma.', 'ZEB/miR-200 feedback loop: at the crossroads of signal transduction in cancer.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox Family: Non-Coding RNA and Epigenetic Regulation in Gliomas.', 'The molecular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies of EMT in tumor progression and metastasis.', 'Downregulation of ZNF280A inhibits proliferation and tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer cells by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of RPS14.', 'Urinary microRNAs and Their Significance in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A 5-Year Update.', 'Long Noncoding RNA and Circular RNA: Two Rising Stars in Regulating Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Pancreatic Cancer.']"""

This has led to the important clinical problem of overtreatment. THOC1 encodes a nuclear ribonucleoprotein whose expression is higher in some cancers than in normal tissue. The hypothesis that THOC1 may be a functionally relevant biomarker that can improve the identification of aggressive prostate cancer has not been tested.  Methods:   THOC1 protein immunostaining was evaluated in a retrospective collection of more than 700 human prostate cancer specimens and the results associated with clinical variables and outcome. Thoc1 was conditionally deleted in an autochthonous mouse model (n = 22 or 23 per genotype) to test whether it is required for prostate cancer progression. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   THOC1 protein immunostaining increases with higher Gleason score and more advanced Tumor/Node/Metastasis stage. Time to biochemical recurrence is statistically significantly shorter for cancers with high THOC1 protein (log-rank P = .002, and it remains statistically significantly associated with biochemical recurrence after adjusting for Gleason score, clinical stage, and prostate-specific antigen levels (hazard ratio = 1.61, 95% confidence interval = 1.03 to 2.51, P = .04). Thoc1 deletion prevents prostate cancer progression in mice, but has little effect on normal tissue. Prostate cancer cells deprived of Thoc1 show gene expression defects that compromise cell growth.  Conclusions:   Thoc1 is required to support the unique gene expression requirements of aggressive prostate cancer in mice.

A recent report showed that APOBEC3B mRNA was overexpressed in breast cancer and that its expression was responsible for the high C-to-T mutation spectrum in breast cancer, suggesting that APOBEC3B could serve as a source for producing mutations. To see whether APOBEC3B is overexpressed in other common cancers at the protein level, we investigated APOBEC3 protein expression in 100 gastric, 103 colorectal and 107 prostate cancer tissues as well as in 10 breast cancers by immunohistochemistry using antibody that could detect APOBEC3B, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3D proteins.  Results:   In the cancers, APOBEC3 expression was detected in 100% of breast cancers, 67% of gastric, 84% of colorectal and 67% of prostate cancer. Also, it was expressed in 100% of normal breast, 90% of normal stomach, 82% of normal colon and 93% of normal prostate tissues. In contrast to earlier data that showed an increased APOBEC3B expression in breast cancer cells compared to normal breast cells, APOBEC3 expression in cancers was lower than in normal tissues (gastric and prostate cancer) or was not different from normal tissues (colorectal and breast cancer).

Cancer incidence variations are influenced by different factors including socioeconomic status, risk factors and use of screening. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in cancer incidence in two urban areas in Europe showing differences in influencing factors but also some common characteristics in the context of data quality of the corresponding cancer registries.Methods. Age-standardized incidence rates (world standard - ASRW) for cases diagnosed in 2000-2009 for Sofia (Bulgaria) and the Canton of Zurich (Switzerland) were calculated using data from the corresponding cancer registries. Average annual percent change (AAPC) was estimated with Joinpoint regression analysis. Data quality was estimated in terms of proportions of microscopically verified (MV%) and death-certificate-only (DCO%) cases. Results. ASRWs for all sites were higher in Zurich for men (311 vs 262 per 100,000) and women (241 vs 231 per 100,000) than in Sofia. Colorectal (both sexes), lung (men), cervical and corpus uteri cancer had a higher incidence in Sofia. Prostate, breast and lung (women) cancer were more often diagnosed in Zurich. A significant increase in female lung cancer incidence was observed in both areas. Overall incidence decreased in Zurich, while it did not significantly change in Sofia. MV% was lower in Sofia than in the Canton of Zurich but increased steadily up to 85% in 2009, whereas in the Canton of Zurich MV% was more or less stable around 95%. The DCO% of Sofia was 19% in 2000 and steadily decreased to 8% in 2009. In the Canton of Zurich, the DCO% decreased from 5% in 2000 but increased again from 2006 onwards, up to 3% in 2009. Conclusions. Cancer incidence rates differ between Sofia and Zurich. Differences concerning socioeconomic status, risk factors, use of cancer screening but also data quality may influence these results.""","""['Silvia Dehler', 'Simeon Tonev', 'Dimitri Korol', 'Sabine Rohrmann', 'Nadya Dimitrova']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Indicators of Data Quality at the Cancer Registry Zurich and Zug in Switzerland.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in South Eastern Europe in the last decade: gaps persist compared with the rest of Europe.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2002, featuring population-based trends in cancer treatment.', 'Age-standardized cancer-incidence trends in Canada, 1971-2015.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Socio-demographic inequalities in the uptake of Papanicolaou tests in Peru: analysis of the 2015-2017 Demographic and Family Health Survey.', 'Indicators of Data Quality at the Cancer Registry Zurich and Zug in Switzerland.', 'Changing trends in the incidence (1999-2011) and mortality (1983-2013) of cervical cancer in the Republic of Korea.']"""

In many cases, such analyses are based on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) core needle biopsy material on which Gleason grading for diagnosis has been conducted. Since each patient typically has multiple biopsy samples, and since Gleason grading is an operator dependent procedure known to be difficult, the impact of the operator's choice of biopsy was evaluated.  Methods:   Multiple biopsy samples from 43 patients were evaluated using a previously reported gene signature of IGFBP3, F3 and VGLL3 with potential prognostic value in estimating overall survival at diagnosis of prostate cancer. A four multiplex one-step qRT-PCR test kit, designed and optimized for measuring the signature in FFPE core needle biopsy samples was used. Concordance of gene expression levels between primary and secondary Gleason tumor patterns, as well as benign tissue specimens, was analyzed.  Results:   The gene expression levels of IGFBP3 and F3 in prostate cancer epithelial cell-containing tissue representing the primary and secondary Gleason patterns were high and consistent, while the low expressed VGLL3 showed more variation in its expression levels.  Conclusion:   The assessment of IGFBP3 and F3 gene expression levels in prostate cancer tissue is independent of Gleason patterns, meaning that the impact of operator's choice of biopsy is low.""","""['Zhuochun Peng', 'Karl Andersson', 'Johan Lindholm', 'Inger Bodin', 'Setia Pramana', 'Yudi Pawitan', 'Monica Nistér', 'Sten Nilsson', 'Chunde Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Improving the Prediction of Prostate Cancer Overall Survival by Supplementing Readily Available Clinical Data with Gene Expression Levels of IGFBP3 and F3 in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded Core Needle Biopsy Material.', 'Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer From Biopsy Specimens.', 'Application of a Clinical Whole-Transcriptome Assay for Staging and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer Diagnosed in Needle Core Biopsy Specimens.', 'Optimization of initial prostate biopsy in clinical practice: sampling, labeling and specimen processing.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'A Novel Risk Score (P-score) Based on a Three-Gene Signature, for Estimating the Risk of Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer: Use, Outcomes, Imaging, and Diagnostic Tools.', 'Genome-wide identification of target genes for miR-204 and miR-211 identifies their proliferation stimulatory role in breast cancer cells.', 'Improving the Prediction of Prostate Cancer Overall Survival by Supplementing Readily Available Clinical Data with Gene Expression Levels of IGFBP3 and F3 in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded Core Needle Biopsy Material.', 'Applying precision medicine to the active surveillance of prostate cancer.']"""

To 'scan' the target volume, the proton beam is controlled by varying its energy to penetrate the patient's body at different depths. Although scanning the proton beamlets or spots with the same energy can be as fast as 10-20 m s(-1), changing from one proton energy to another requires approximately two additional seconds. The total IMPT delivery time thus depends mainly on the number of proton energies used in a treatment. Current treatment planning systems typically use all proton energies that are required for the proton beam to penetrate in a range from the distal edge to the proximal edge of the target. The optimal selection of proton energies has not been well studied. In this study, we sought to determine the feasibility of optimizing and reducing the number of proton energies in IMPT planning. We proposed an iterative mixed-integer programming optimization method to select a subset of all available proton energies while satisfying dosimetric criteria. We applied our proposed method to six patient datasets: four cases of prostate cancer, one case of lung cancer, and one case of mesothelioma. The numbers of energies were reduced by 14.3%-18.9% for the prostate cancer cases, 11.0% for the lung cancer cases and 26.5% for the mesothelioma case. The results indicate that the number of proton energies used in conventionally designed IMPT plans can be reduced without degrading dosimetric performance. The IMPT delivery efficiency could be improved by energy layer optimization leading to increased throughput for a busy proton center in which a delivery system with slow energy switch is employed.""","""['Wenhua Cao', 'Gino Lim', 'Li Liao', 'Yupeng Li', 'Shengpeng Jiang', 'Xiaoqiang Li', 'Heng Li', 'Kazumichi Suzuki', 'X Ronald Zhu', 'Daniel Gomez', 'Xiaodong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Integrated beam orientation and scanning-spot optimization in intensity-modulated proton therapy for brain and unilateral head and neck tumors.', 'Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'Spot-Scanning Proton Arc (SPArc) Therapy: The First Robust and Delivery-Efficient Spot-Scanning Proton Arc Therapy.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) - The future of IMRT for head and neck cancer.', 'Intensity modulated proton arc therapy via geometry-based energy selection for ependymoma.', 'Delivery of intensity-modulated electron therapy by mechanical scanning: An algorithm study.', 'Developing an accurate model of spot-scanning treatment delivery time and sequence for a compact superconducting synchrocyclotron proton therapy system.', 'Future Developments in Charged Particle Therapy: Improving Beam Delivery for Efficiency and Efficacy.', 'Linear Energy Transfer Incorporated Spot-Scanning Proton Arc Therapy Optimization: A Feasibility Study.']"""

While recent studies have identified potential pathways involved in CRPC development, the drivers of CRPC remain largely undefined. Here we determined that nuclear receptor coactivator 2 (NCoA2, also known as SRC-2), which is frequently amplified or overexpressed in patients with metastatic PCa, mediates development of CRPC. In a murine model, overexpression of NCoA2 in the prostate epithelium resulted in neoplasia and, in combination with Pten deletion, promoted the development of metastasis-prone cancer. Moreover, depletion of NCoA2 in PTEN-deficient mice prevented the development of CRPC. In human androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, androgen signaling suppressed NCoA2 expression, and NCoA2 overexpression in murine prostate tumors resulted in hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling, promoting tumor malignance. Analysis of PCa patient samples revealed a strong correlation among NCoA2-mediated signaling, disease progression, and PCa recurrence. Taken together, our findings indicate that androgen deprivation induces NCoA2, which in turn mediates activation of PI3K signaling and promotes PCa metastasis and CRPC development. Moreover, these results suggest that the inhibition of NCoA2 has potential for PCa therapy.""","""['Jun Qin', 'Hui-Ju Lee', 'San-Pin Wu', 'Shih-Chieh Lin', 'Rainer B Lanz', 'Chad J Creighton', 'Francesco J DeMayo', 'Sophia Y Tsai', 'Ming-Jer Tsai']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Anti-androgen therapy induces transcriptomic reprogramming in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a murine model.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Negative cross talk between LIMK2 and PTEN promotes castration resistant prostate cancer pathogenesis in cells and in vivo.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Values of Gene Copy Number Alterations in Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic differences in NCOA2: a novel biomarker that predicts prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Post-transcriptional modification of m6A methylase METTL3 regulates ERK-induced androgen-deprived treatment resistance prostate cancer.', 'NCOA2-induced secretion of leptin leads to fetal growth restriction via the NF-κB signaling pathway.']"""

Biomarkers were evaluated individually and jointly via multivariable modeling of distant metastasis using competing risks hazards regression, adjusting for age, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, T stage, and treatment.  Results:   Modeling identified four biomarkers (Ki-67, MDM2, p16 and Cox-2) that were jointly associated with distant metastasis. The c-index was 0.77 for the full model and 0.70 for the model without the biomarkers; a relative improvement of about 10% (likelihood ratio P < 0.001). Subdivision of the patients into quartiles based on predicted distant metastasis risk identified a high-risk group with 10-year distant metastasis risk of 52.5% after EBRT + STADT and 31% with EBRT + LTADT; associated 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) risks were 45.9% and 14.5% with STADT and LTADT.  Conclusion:   Four biomarkers were found to contribute significantly to a model that predicted distant metastasis and identified a subgroup of patients at a particularly high risk of both distant metastasis and PCSM when EBRT + STADT was used.

Recently, critical role of aberrant lipogenesis is highlighted in prostate carcinogenesis, offering a unique opportunity to target it to reduce PCA. Here, we evaluated efficacy and associated mechanisms of silibinin in inhibiting lipid metabolism in PCA cells. At physiologically achievable levels in human, silibinin strongly reduced lipid and cholesterol accumulation specifically in human PCA cells but not in non-neoplastic prostate epithelial PWR-1E cells. Silibinin also decreased nuclear protein levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and 2 (SREBP1/2) and their target genes only in PCA cells. Mechanistically, silibinin activated AMPK, thereby increasing SREBP1 phosphorylation and inhibiting its nuclear translocation; AMPK inhibition reversed silibinin-mediated decrease in nuclear SREBP1 and lipid accumulation. Additionally, specific SREBP inhibitor fatostatin and stable overexpression of SREBP1 further confirmed the central role of SREBP1 in silibinin-mediated inhibition of PCA cell proliferation and lipid accumulation and cell cycle arrest. Importantly, silibinin also inhibited synthetic androgen R1881-induced lipid accumulation and completely abrogated the development of androgen-independent LNCaP cell clones via targeting SREBP1/2.

The correlation between L1CAM expression and prostate cancer metastasis was also validated in serum samples of prostate cancer patients. Knockdown of L1CAM expression in prostate cancer cells by RNA interference significantly decreased their aggressive behaviors, including colony formation, migration and invasion in vitro, and tumor formation in a metastatic murine model. These anti-malignant phenotypes of L1CAM-knockdown cancer cells were accompanied by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and suppression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression and nuclear factor NF-κB activation. In vivo targeting of L1CAM expression using liposome-encapsulated L1CAM siRNAs effectively inhibited prostate cancer growth in mouse bone, which was associated with decreased L1CAM expression and cell proliferation by tumor cells.

Analysis of prostate cancer-specific mortality by nomogram-predicted risks of biochemical recurrence""","""Background:   Due to the protracted natural history of the clinical progression of prostate cancer, biochemical recurrence (BCR) is often used to compare treatment modalities. However, BCR definitions and posttreatment prostate-specific antigen kinetics vary considerably among treatments, calling into the question the validity of such comparisons.  Objective:   To analyze prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) according to treatment-specific nomogram-predicted risk of BCR for men treated by radical prostatectomy (RP), external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and brachytherapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 13 803 men who underwent RP, EBRT, or brachytherapy at two US high-volume hospitals between 1995 and 2008.  Intervention:   RP, EBRT, and brachytherapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The 5-yr progression-free probability (5Y-PFP) was calculated for each patient based on the treatment received using a validated treatment-specific nomogram. Fine and Gray competing risk analysis was then used to estimate PCSM by a patient's predicted 5Y-PFP. Multivariable competing risk regression analysis was used to determine the association of treatment with PCSM after adjusting for nomogram-predicted 5Y-PFP.  Results and limitations:   Men receiving EBRT had higher 10-yr PCSM compared with those treated by RP across the range of nomogram-predicted risks of BCR: 5Y-PFP >75%, 3% versus 0.9%; 5Y-PFP 51-75%, 6.8% versus 5.9%; 5Y-PFP 26-50%, 12.2% versus 10.6%; and 5Y-PFP ≤25%, 26.6% versus 21.2%. After adjusting for nomogram-predicted 5Y-PFP, EBRT was associated with a significantly increased PCSM risk compared with RP (hazard ratio: 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.0; p=0.006). No statistically significant difference in PCSM was observed between patients treated by brachytherapy and RP, although patient selection factors and lack of statistical power limited this analysis.  Conclusions:   EBRT patients with similar nomogram-predicted 5Y-PFP appear to have a significantly increased risk of PCSM compared with those treated by RP. Comparison of treatments using nomogram-predicted BCR end points may not be valid.  Patient summary:   Biochemical recurrence (BCR) outcomes after external-beam radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy are associated with different risks of subsequent prostate cancer-specific mortality.

Materials and methods:   A total of 18 fiducial markers, which served as the target centres for the virtual tumours (target fiducials), were implanted in the prostate and kidney of a fresh cadaver, and preoperative computed tomography (CT) was performed to allow three-dimensional model reconstruction of the surgical regions, which were registered on the body intra-operatively. The position of the movable tablet's display could be selected to obtain the best recognition of the interior anatomy. The system was used to navigate the puncture needle (with position-tracking sensor attached) using a colour-coded, predictive puncture-line. When the operator punctured the target fiducial, another fiducial, serving as the centre of the ablative treatment (treatment fiducial), was placed. Postoperative CT was performed to assess the digitized distance (representing the real distance) between the target and treatment fiducials to evaluate the accuracy of the procedure.  Results:   The movable tablet display, with position-tracking sensor attached, enabled the surgeon to visualize the three-dimensional anatomy of the internal organs with the help of an overlaid puncture line for the puncture needle, which also had a position-tracking sensor attached. The mean (virtual) distance from the needle tip to the target (calculated using the computer workstation), was 2.5 mm. In an analysis of each digitalized axial component, the errors were significantly greater along the z-axis (P < 0.01), suggesting that the errors were caused by organ shift or deformation.  Conclusion:   This virtual navigation system, integrating a position-tracking sensor with a movable tablet display, is a promising advancement for facilitating percutaneous interventions. The movable display over the patient shows a preoperative three-dimensional image that is aligned to the patient. Moving the display moves the image, creating the feeling of looking through a window into the patient, resulting in instant perception and a direct, intuitive connection between the physician and the anatomy.""","""['Arnaud Marien', 'Andre Castro de Luis Abreu', 'Mihir Desai', 'Raed A Azhar', 'Sameer Chopra', 'Sunao Shoji', 'Toru Matsugasumi', 'Masahiko Nakamoto', 'Inderbir S Gill', 'Osamu Ukimura']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['A three-dimensional window into the body?', 'Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of virtual tumours in canine kidney using Global Positioning System-like technology.', 'A new device for fiducial registration of image-guided navigation system for liver RFA.', 'Are Skin Fiducials Comparable to Bone Fiducials for Registration When Planning Navigation-assisted Musculoskeletal Tumor Resections in a Cadaveric Simulated Tumor Model?', 'Surgical navigation in urology: European perspective.', 'Navigation in urological surgery: Possibilities and limits of current techniques.']"""

We conducted a replication study in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) study and pooled with published ATBC (Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene) data.  Methods:   In PLCO, 292 NHL cases (95 CLL/SLL cases) and 301 controls were pooled with 142 NHL cases (47 CLL/SLL cases) and 142 controls from ATBC.

Unconditional logistic regression estimated mtDNA CN and NHL risk by odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).  Results:   Greater mtDNA CN was associated with increased risk of CLL/SLL among males in PLCO (3rd vs. 1st tertile: OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.03-4.72; Ptrend: 0.049) and pooled (T3 vs. T1: OR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.72-5.68; Ptrend: 0.0002).

We show that human prostatic hyperplasia is associated with IGF pathway activation specifically localized to foci of inflammation.

Materials and methods:   A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all case-control studies of CASP8 D302H and -652 6N del polymorphisms and PCa risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association and the precision of the estimate, respectively.  Results:   Nine -625 6N del studies and 4 D302H studies were included. CASP8 -652 6N del and D302H polymorphisms were not significantly associated with PCa risk in the overall analyses. However, in the subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity, -625 6N del was significantly associated with PCa risk in the East Asian and Indian populations under the recessive model. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis strongly suggested that D302H was associated with lower PCa risk in the Non-Indian population under the dominant model.  Conclusions:   In our meta-analysis, ethnic-specific differences were evident in the association of CASP8 -625 6N del and D302H polymorphisms with PCa risk.""","""['Cheng-Dong Zhang', 'Hong-Tao Li', 'Kun Liu', 'Zhi-Di Lin', 'Qi-Liu Peng', 'Xue Qin', 'Min He', 'Hua Wu', 'Zeng-Nan Mo', 'Xiao-Li Yang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Association of two CASP8 polymorphisms with breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis.', 'The relationship of CASP 8 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis.', 'CASP8 -652 6N del polymorphism contributes to colorectal cancer susceptibility: evidence from a meta-analysis.', 'CAS P8 -652 6N del polymorphism and breast cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association of CASP8 polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility: A meta-analysis.', 'Association of Caspase-8 Genotypes With Oral Cancer Risk in Taiwan.', 'CASP8 -652 6N insertion/deletion polymorphism and overall cancer risk: evidence from 49 studies.', 'Association Between the Asp312Asn, Lys751Gln, and Arg156Arg Polymorphisms in XPD and the Risk of Prostate Cancer.', 'Association between the ERCC2 Asp312Asn polymorphism and risk of cancer.', 'Shorter GGN Repeats in Androgen Receptor Gene Would Not Increase the Risk of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) is the active ingredient extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Salvia, and it has effects of anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, vascular smooth muscle relaxation and tumour growth inhibition. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of Tan IIA in the prevention and treatment of BPH. In a rat model of oestradiol/testosterone-induced BPH, Tan IIA inhibited the increase in the thickness of the peri-glandular smooth muscle layer, suppressed the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in both prostate epithelial cells and stromal cells, downregulated the expression of androgen receptor (AR), oestrogen receptor α (ERα), cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and cyclin D1 (CCND1), and effectively prevented the development of the disorder. In vitro, Tan IIA inhibited the proliferation of human prostate stromal cell line WPMY-1 and epithelial cell line RWPE-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In WPMY-1 cells, Tan IIA treatment arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and downregulated the expression of CCNB1. However, in RWPE-1 cells, Tan IIA treatment arrested cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and reduced the expression of CCND1. Tan IIA also reduced the expression of ERα and AR in WPMY-1 and RWPE-1 cells. These results suggest that Tan IIA can inhibit the growth of prostate stromal and epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism that may involve arresting the cell cycle and downregulating ERα and AR expression.""","""['Chao Wang', 'Xiaoling Du', 'Rui Yang', 'Jie Liu', 'Da Xu', 'Jiandang Shi', 'Linfeng Chen', 'Rui Shao', 'Guanwei Fan', 'Xiumei Gao', 'Guo Tian', 'Yan Zhu', 'Ju Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['The therapeutic effects of docosahexaenoic acid on oestrogen/androgen-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.', 'Psoralea corylifolia L. extract ameliorates benign prostatic hyperplasia by regulating prostate cell proliferation and apoptosis.', 'Activation of p53 signaling and inhibition of androgen receptor mediate tanshinone IIA induced G1 arrest in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Clinical and experimental studies of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Role of the stromal microenvironment in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'Effects of Alginate Oligosaccharide on Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Orchiectomized Rats.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tanshinone against Prostate Cancer.', 'The Expression Profiles of the Salvia miltiorrhiza 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A Reductase 4 Gene and Its Influence on the Biosynthesis of Tanshinones.', 'Combined Effects of Different Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) on Prostate Gland.', 'Pharmacological Modulation of Steroid Activity in Hormone-Dependent Breast and Prostate Cancers: Effect of Some Plant Extract Derivatives.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study comprised 2380 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer seen at 28 practices in the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative from March 2012 through September 2013. Data included age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score (GS), clinical T stage, total number of positive biopsy cores, whether or not the patient received a staging abdominal and/or pelvic CT scan, and CT scan result. We fit a multivariate logistic regression model to identify clinical variables associated with metastases detected by CT scan. We estimated the sensitivity and specificity of existing imaging recommendations.  Results:   Among 643 men (27.4%) who underwent a staging CT scan, 62 men (9.6%) had a positive study. In the multivariate analysis, PSA, GS, and clinical T stage were independently associated with the occurrence of a positive CT scan (all P values <.05). The American Urological Association's Best Practice Statements' recommendations for imaging when PSA level >20 ng/mL or GS ≥ 8 or locally advanced cancer had a sensitivity of 87.3% and specificity of 82.6%. Compared with current practice, implementing this recommendation in the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative population was estimated to result in approximately 0.5% of positive study results being missed, and 26.1% of fewer study results overall.

Methods:   Patients with D'Amico low-risk prostate cancer on ≥ 10-core biopsy who underwent radical prostatectomy at our academic center were evaluated for eligibility for AS by either Epstein criteria or Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) criteria. Prostatectomy specimens of patients eligible for AS were compared to determine if the presence of clinical HGPIN or ASAP affected the primary outcomes of pathologic upstaging and Gleason score upgrading.  Results:   Of 553 patients with low-risk prostate cancer, 400 patients (72.3%) met the MSKCC criteria, whereas only 170 patients (30.7%) met the Epstein criteria. HGPIN was present in approximately 32%, and ASAP in approximately 12%, of each AS cohort. On univariate and multivariate analyses, HGPIN and ASAP had no impact on the rate of upgrading and upstaging in either Epstein or MSKCC AS-eligible patients.

In this study, we assessed the feasibility of engaging rural barbershops as venues for barbers to deliver a prostate cancer education intervention to increase informed decision-making for prostate cancer screening among customers. Twelve barbershops were recruited from two separate micropolitan areas in Georgia as intervention and control sites. Structured interviews were conducted with 11 barbers in both sites about customer characteristics as well as their willingness to participate in the study. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. In the intervention site, six barbers completed a survey and a pre-/posttest prostate cancer knowledge instrument following training classes. Barbers reported a wide average range of customers served per week (50 to 300). African-American men made up an average of 87% of customers. Barbers thought prostate cancer was an important discussion topic, felt they would be comfortable discussing it, and supported the participation of their barbershop in the study. For intervention group barbers, there was a statistically significant difference between the average pretest knowledge score of 72% (mean 12.2, SD=3.2) and the posttest knowledge score of 89% (mean 15.2, SD=1.1) (P=0.03) on the 17-item prostate cancer knowledge instrument.

Results:   Lower area-level SES was weakly associated with higher total cancer incidence and lower prostate cancer risk, but was not associated with risk of breast cancer.

We reported that G-1, a selective agonist of G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), inhibited PC cell growth by inducing G2 cell cycle arrest and arrested PC-3 xenograft growth. However, the therapeutic actions of G-1 and their relationships with androgen in vivo are unclear. Using the LNCaP xenograft to model PC growth during the androgen-sensitive (AS) versus the castration-resistant (CR) phase, we found that G-1 inhibited growth of CR but not AS tumors with no observable toxicity to the host. Substantial necrosis (approximately 65%) accompanied by marked intratumoral infiltration of neutrophils was observed only in CR tumors. Global transcriptome profiling of human genes identified 99 differentially expressed genes with 'interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses' as the top pathway. Quantitative PCR confirmed upregulation of neutrophil-related chemokines and inflammation-mediated cytokines only in the G-1-treated CR tumors. Expression of murine neutrophil-related cytokines also was elevated in these tumors. GPR30 (GPER1) expression was significantly higher in CR tumors than in AS tumors. In cell-based experiments, androgen repressed GPR30 expression, a response reversible by anti-androgen or siRNA-induced androgen receptor silencing. Finally, in clinical specimens, 80% of CRPC metastases (n=123) expressed a high level of GPR30, whereas only 54% of the primary PCs (n=232) showed high GPR30 expression.

Patients and methods:   Between 2001 and 2011, 200 patients were treated by the same team with 125 iodine seeds: 167 low-risk and 33 intermediate risk according to the d'Amico classification; eligible patients had clinical stage T1/T2a-b, Gleason score 3+3 or 3+4, baseline prostate-specific antigen level below 15ng/mL, prostate volume less than 60cm(3). The median number of random biopsies was 12 (range 6-32) and the breakdown of positive cores was as follows: 1 (29%), 2 (35%), 3 or more (36%). Acute morbidity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and late toxicity according to the EORTC/RTOG scale. Data were prospectively collected.

A total of 135 patients with metastatic prostate cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Both Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and multivariable analysis by Cox regression model were used to assess the prognostic role of serum CRP levels on overall survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. There were 51 patients (37.8%) with higher values of baseline serum CRP levels (≥10 mg/L). Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and log-rank test showed that patients with high serum CRP level (≥10 mg/L) had significantly worse overall survival than those patients with normal serum CRP level (<10 mg/L) (P < 0.001). The multivariable analysis by Cox regression model further showed that high serum CRP level (≥10 mg/L) was a significantly independent predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.39; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.56-2.39, P < 0.001).

The molecular mechanisms that enable cancer cells to proliferate in the presence of elevated copper levels are, therefore, of key importance in our understanding of tumour growth progression. In the current study, we have examined the role played by the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in mitigating copper-induced growth inhibition of the PCa cell line, DU145. A range of APP molecular constructs were stably over-expressed in DU145 cells and their effects on cell proliferation in the presence of copper were monitored. Our results show that endogenous APP expression was induced by sub-toxic copper concentrations in DU145 cells and over-expression of the wild-type protein was able to mitigate copper-induced growth inhibition via a mechanism involving the cytosolic and E1 copper binding domains of the full-length protein. APP likely represents one of a range of copper binding proteins that PCa cells employ in order to ensure efficient proliferation despite elevated concentrations of the metal within the tumour microenvironment.

Family food provision, however, involves complex social interactions, which shape how men engage with their diets and dietary interventions. The role that gender plays in shaping prostate cancer couples' food practices and men's diets after a prostate cancer diagnosis is thought to be important but is little understood. This study explored couples' accounts of nutrition information seeking and diet change to gain a better understanding of how gender relations shaped men's food practices after prostate cancer diagnosis. Qualitative health interviews with men and their partners were conducted and analysed using interpretive descriptive methods. Findings demonstrated how couples navigated food change journeys that involved seeking information, deciding what changes were warranted and implementing and regulating diet changes. Two overarching themes that illustrated couples' food negotiations were called 'Seeking information and deciding on food changes' and 'Monitoring food changes'. Additional sub-themes described who led food changes, women's filtering of information, and moderation or 'treats'. Throughout these food change journeys, interactions between men and women were at play, demonstrating how gender relations and dynamics acted to shape couples' food negotiations and men's food practices. Findings reveal that attention to gender relations and the men's family food dynamics should inform diet interventions for men with prostate cancer in order to improve uptake.""","""['Lawrence W Mróz', 'Steven Robertson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Appetite""","""['Gender relations, prostate cancer and diet: re-inscribing hetero-normative food practices.', ""Men, food, and prostate cancer: gender influences on men's diets."", '""He\'s more typically female because he\'s not afraid to cry"": connecting heterosexual gender relations and men\'s depression.', 'Prostate cancer, masculinity and food.

Prostatic epithelial cells are surrounded by stroma, which has well-established regulatory control over epithelial proliferation, differentiation, and the inflammatory response. Here we examined the regulation of vitamin D-related genes and inflammatory genes by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D) in laser-capture microdissected prostate tissue from a vitamin D3 clinical trial and in an in vitro model that facilitates stromal-epithelial crosstalk. Analysis of the trial tissues showed that VDR was present in both cell types, whereas expression of the hydroxylases was the highest in the epithelium. Examination of gene expression by prostatic (1,25(OH)2D) concentrations showed that VDR was significantly lower in prostate tissues with the highest concentration of 1,25(OH)2D, and down-regulation of VDR by 1,25(OH) 2D was confirmed in the primary cell cultures. Analysis of inflammatory genes in the patient tissues revealed that IL-6 expression was the highest in the prostate stroma while PTGS2 (COX2) levels were lowest in the prostate cancer tissues from men in the highest tertile of prostatic 1,25(OH)2D. In vitro, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 were suppressed by 1,25 (OH)2D in the primary epithelial cells, whereas TNF-α and PTGS2 were suppressed by 1,25(OH) 2D in the stromal cells. Importantly, the ability of 1,25(OH)2D to alter pro-inflammatory-induced changes in epithelial cell growth were dependent on the presence of the stromal cells. In summary, whereas both stromal and epithelial cells of the prostate express VDR and can presumably respond to 1,25(OH)2D, the prostatic epithelium appears to be the main producer of 1,25(OH)2D. Further, while the prostate epithelium was more responsive to the anti-inflammatory activity of 1,25 (OH)2D than stromal cells, stroma-epithelial crosstalk enhanced the phenotypic effects of 1,25(OH)2D and the inflammatory process in the prostate gland.""","""['Angeline A Giangreco', 'Shweta Dambal', 'Dennis Wagner', 'Theodorus Van der Kwast', 'Reinhold Vieth', 'Gail S Prins', 'Larisa Nonn']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['microRNAs and DICER1 are regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in prostate stroma.', 'Anti-proliferative activity of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in human prostate cells.', 'Temporal changes in tissue 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, vitamin D receptor target genes, and calcium and PTH levels after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment in mice.', 'The role of Vitamin D3 metabolism in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of prostate cancer growth by vitamin D: Regulation of target gene expression.', 'Immune Response: A Missed Opportunity Between Vitamin D and Radiotherapy.', 'Post-treatment levels of plasma 25- and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and mortality in men with aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Racial Differences in Immunological Landscape Modifiers Contributing to Disparity in Prostate Cancer.', 'Vitamin D regulates prostate cell metabolism via genomic and non-genomic mitochondrial redox-dependent mechanisms.', 'Repurposing vitamin D for treatment of human malignancies via targeting tumor microenvironment.']"""

However, changes in Gleason score during serial biopsies are not detailed in many of these reports.  Objectives:   To evaluate changes in Gleason score on follow-up biopsies in low-risk prostate cancer in patients undergoing AS program in our center.  Material and methods:   Series of patients diagnosed of prostate cancer between 2004 and 2013 have been analyzed. The inclusion criteria were: PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml + Gleason ≤ 6 + T1c/T2a + ≤ 2 positive cores, and no more than 50% of affected core. The pathology of each of the biopsies was analyzed.  Results:   We studied a series of 175 patients undergoing AS. Mean follow-up was 3.96 years (SD 2.4). Follow-up biopsies with Gleason scores ≥ 7 were: 5.72% in the first biopsy, 7.39% and 7.41% in subsequent biopsies. By contrast, in 42.03% of cases did not show evident tumor involvement in the first biopsy, 40.74% and 51.85% in the second and third biopsies respectively. Median stay in the AS program was: 90.99 months (95% CI: 53.53-128.46) in patients with first positive biopsy vs. 96.66 months (95% CI: 63.19-130.13) in those without evidence of tumor.  Conclusions:   In our series the pathological data of the first 3 biopsies remain stable in terms of the positive biopsy rate, Gleason score, or indication of active treatment proportions. Those patients who do not show evidence of malignancy in the first follow-up biopsy are less likely to need active treatment than the other patients in the series.""","""['A Guijarro', 'V Hernández', 'B López', 'C Capitán', 'E Pérez-Fernández', 'E de la Peña', 'J M de la Morena', 'C Llorente']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Factors influencing disease progression of prostate cancer under active surveillance: a McGill University Health Center cohort.', '3+4\xa0= 6?

Functional data analysis is used to investigate the information contained in differential dose-volume histograms. The method is applied to the normal tissue complication probability modeling of rectal bleeding (RB) for patients irradiated in the prostatic bed by 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   Kernel density estimation was used to estimate the individual probability density functions from each of the 141 rectum differential dose-volume histograms. Functional principal component analysis was performed on the estimated probability density functions to explore the variation modes in the dose distribution. The functional principal components were then tested for association with RB using logistic regression adapted to functional covariates (FLR). For comparison, 3 other normal tissue complication probability models were considered: the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model, logistic model based on standard dosimetric parameters (LM), and logistic model based on multivariate principal component analysis (PCA).  Results:   The incidence rate of grade ≥2 RB was 14%. V65Gy was the most predictive factor for the LM (P=.058). The best fit for the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model was obtained with n=0.12, m = 0.17, and TD50 = 72.6 Gy. In PCA and FLR, the components that describe the interdependence between the relative volumes exposed at intermediate and high doses were the most correlated to the complication. The FLR parameter function leads to a better understanding of the volume effect by including the treatment specificity in the delivered mechanistic information. For RB grade ≥2, patients with advanced age are significantly at risk (odds ratio, 1.123; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.22), and the fits of the LM, PCA, and functional principal component analysis models are significantly improved by including this clinical factor.  Conclusion:   Functional data analysis provides an attractive method for flexibly estimating the dose-volume effect for normal tissues in external radiation therapy.""","""['Mohamed Amine Benadjaoud', 'Pierre Blanchard', 'Boris Schwartz', 'Jérôme Champoudry', 'Ryan Bouaita', 'Dimitri Lefkopoulos', 'Eric Deutsch', 'Ibrahima Diallo', 'Hervé Cardot', 'Florent de Vathaire']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Functional data analysis in NTCP modeling: in regard to Benadjaoud et al.', 'In reply to Alber and Söhn.', 'Fitting late rectal bleeding data using different NTCP models: results from an Italian multi-centric study (AIROPROS0101).', 'Comparison of rectal dose-wall histogram versus dose-volume histogram for modeling the incidence of late rectal bleeding after radiotherapy.', 'Principal component analysis-based pattern analysis of dose-volume histograms and influence on rectal toxicity.', 'Validation of normal tissue complication probability predictions in individual patient: late rectal toxicity.', 'Radiation dose-volume effects in radiation-induced rectal injury.', 'Machine learning for normal tissue complication probability prediction: Predictive power with versatility and easy implementation.', 'Feasibility of Differential Dose-Volume Histogram Features in Multivariate Prediction Model for Radiation Pneumonitis Occurrence.', 'Evaluating the predictive value of quantec rectum tolerance dose suggestions on acute rectal toxicity in prostate carcinoma patients treated with IMRT.', 'A Population-based Statistical Model for Investigating Heterogeneous Intraprostatic Sensitivity to Radiation Toxicity After 125I Seed Implantation.', 'Association between EBRT dose volume histograms and quality of life in prostate cancer patients.']"""

Given that prostate cancer and dyslipidemia affect large proportions of Western society, understanding these associations has public health importance.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 843 radical prostatectomy (RP) patients who never used statins before surgery within the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to investigate the association between cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides and biochemical recurrence risk. In secondary analysis, we explored these associations in patients with dyslipidemia, defined using National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines.  Results:   Elevated serum triglycerides were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer recurrence [HRper 10 mg/dl, 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.05] but associations between total cholesterol, LDL and HDL, and recurrence risk were null. However, among men with dyslipidemia, each 10 mg/dl increase in cholesterol and HDL was associated with 9% increased recurrence risk (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17) and 39% reduced recurrence risk (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91), respectively.  Conclusions:   Elevated serum triglycerides were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer recurrence. Cholesterol, LDL, or HDL were not associated with recurrence risk among all men. However, among men with dyslipidemia, elevated cholesterol and HDL levels were associated with increased and decreased risk of recurrence, respectively.

A total of 100 consecutive high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with definitive VMAT with prophylactic whole-pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) were enrolled. All patients were treated with a double-arc VMAT plan delivering 52 Gy to the prostate planning target volume (PTV), while simultaneously delivering 46.8 Gy to the pelvic nodal PTV in 26 fractions, followed by a single-arc VMAT plan delivering 26 Gy to the prostate PTV in 13 fractions. Image-guided RT was performed with daily cone-beam computed tomography. Dose-volume parameters for the PTV and the organs at risk (OARs), total number of monitor units (MUs) and treatment time were evaluated. Acute toxicity was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. All dosimetric parameters met the present plan acceptance criteria. Mean MU and treatment time were 471 and 146 s for double-arc VMAT, respectively, and were 520 and 76 s for single-arc VMAT, respectively. No Grade 3 or higher acute toxicity was reported. Acute Grade 2 proctitis, diarrhea, and genitourinary toxicity occurred in 12 patients (12%), 6 patients (6%) and 13 patients (13%), respectively. The present study demonstrated that VMAT for WPRT in prostate cancer results in favorable PTV coverage and OAR sparing with short treatment time and an acceptable rate of acute toxicity.

Methods:   The overall cohort consisted of 1,265 men (234 AA and 1,031 CS) who met the National comprehensive cancer network criteria for low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer and underwent RP between 1990 and 2012. We first evaluated whether clinical factors were associated with adverse pathologic outcomes and freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF) using the entire cohort. Next, we studied a subset of 705 men (112 AA and 593 CS) who had pathologic Gleason score≤6 (low-grade disease). Using this cohort, we determined whether race affected FFbF in men with RP-proven low-grade disease and similar CAPRA-S scores.  Results:   With a median follow-up time of 27 months, the overall 7-year FFbF rate was 86% vs. 79% in CS and AA men, respectively (P = 0.035). There was no significant difference in one or more adverse pathologic features between CS vs. AA men (27% vs. 31%; P = 0.35) or CAPRA-S score (P = 0.28). In the subset analysis of patients with low-grade disease, AA race was associated with worse FFbF outcomes (P = 0.002). Furthermore, AA race was a significant predictor of FFbF in men with low-grade disease (hazard ratio = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.08-3.72; P = 0.029).  Conclusions:   AA race is a predictor of worse FFbF outcomes in men with low-grade disease after RP.

Design:   Retrospective data collection.  Setting:   Population based.  Participants:   New cancer patients within the Barwon South Western region.  Main outcome measures:   Cancer incidence and staging data for a regional and rural area.  Results:   In 2009, there were 1778 primary tumours. Prominent tumour streams included prostate, breast, colon, lung, lymphoma, melanoma and rectum. Stage at diagnosis was recorded for more than 50% of patients for the tumour streams of testis, breast, bowel, renal, lung, and head and neck. Patients reporting to health centres with an on-site oncologist as part of their team had a higher rate of staging recorded at diagnosis (48.0 versus 36.9%, P=0.01). More women (55.4%) than men (41.4%) had stage-recorded.  Conclusion:   The Evaluation of Cancer Outcomes study is an important initiative that collects information about newly diagnosed cases of cancer more detailed than is currently collected by the Cancer Council of Victoria.

With new therapies extending survival in mCRPC, it was hypothesized that the pattern of metastases is changing over time. The pattern of metastatic disease was evaluated in men with mCRPC, as reported in baseline characteristics of prospective clinical trials over 2 decades.  Methods:   This study identified all phase 2 and 3 therapeutic studies in men with mCRPC in PubMed and American Society of Clinical Oncology abstracts from 1990 to 2012. Studies were excluded if they did not report demographic data and sites of metastasis, or excluded patients with a specific site of metastatic disease (except brain). For each type of metastasis, weighted least squares linear regression models were used to evaluate temporal trends.  Results:   A total of 290 eligible studies (270 phase 2 studies and 20 phase 3 studies) involving 19,110 patients were identified. Between 1990 and 2012, the rate of nonosseous metastasis increased significantly at 1.6% per year (P < .0001), whereas the rate of osseous metastasis decreased at 0.5% per year (P < .0001). The rate of lymph node metastasis increased at 1.4% per year (P < .0001), but the rate of liver and lung metastasis remained relatively stable.  Conclusions:   A notable change was found in the pattern of metastasis in patients with mCRPC. Because these evolving patterns may have important implications in treatment selection and prognosis, it is crucial that future clinical trials of patients with mCRPC define patients with a uniform reporting of nonosseous metastasis.""","""['Stephanie M Doctor', 'Che-Kai Tsao', 'James H Godbold', 'Matthew D Galsky', 'William K Oh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['The prognostic importance of metastatic site in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Is computed tomography a necessary part of a metastatic evaluation for castration-resistant prostate cancer?

Numerous reasons have been offered in explanation, pertaining both to the vaccine formulation, and the clinical trial methodology used. This study aims to characterize the tumor vaccine clinical trial landscape quantitatively, and explore the possible validity of the offered explanations including the translational obstacles posed by the current common endpoints.  Methods:   We performed a detailed cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of tumor vaccine trials (n=955) registered in the US Clinical Trials database.  Results:   The number of tumor vaccine trials initiated per annum has declined 30% since a peak in 2008. In terms of vaccine formulation, 25% of trials use tumor cell/lysate preparations; whereas, 73% of trials vaccinate subjects against defined protein/peptide antigens. Also, 68% of trials do not use vectors for antigen delivery. Both these characteristics of tumor vaccines have remained unchanged since 1996. The top five types of cancer studied are: melanoma (22.6%); cervical cancer (13.0%); breast cancer (11.3%); lung cancer (9.5%); and prostate cancer (9.4%). In addition, 86% of the trials are performed where there is established disease rather than prophylactically, of which 67% are performed exclusively in the adjuvant setting. Also, 42% of Phase II trials do not measure any survival-related endpoint, and only 23% of Phase III trials assess the immune response to vaccination.  Conclusion:   The clinical trial effort in tumor vaccination is declining, necessitating a greater urgency in identifying and removing the obstacles to clinical translation. These obstacles may include: 1) vaccination against a small range of antigens; 2) naked delivery of antigen; 3) investigation of less immunogenic cancer types; and 4) investigation in the setting of established disease. In addition, the prevalence of late phase failure may be due to inadequate assessment of survival-related endpoints in Phase II trials. The clinical trial development of tumor vaccines should include mechanism-based translational endpoints, as well as the discovery of immune biomarkers with which to stratify, monitor, and prognosticate patients.""","""['Liangjian Lu', 'Haixi Yan', 'Vijay Shyam-Sundar', 'Tobias Janowitz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['Melanoma Vaccine--AVAX Technologies: DNP-VACC, M-Vax.', 'Sipuleucel-T: APC 8015, APC-8015, prostate cancer vaccine--Dendreon.', 'Current vaccination strategies for prostate cancer.', 'A Phase I/II trial comparing autologous dendritic cell vaccine pulsed either with personalized peptides (PEP-DC) or with tumor lysate (OC-DC) in patients with advanced high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma.', 'The Rapid Development and Early Success of Covid 19 Vaccines Have Raised Hopes for Accelerating the Cancer Treatment Mechanism.', 'Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as an endpoint in cancer vaccine trials.', 'Melanoma and Nanotechnology-Based Treatment.', 'The Therapeutic Potential of Tackling Tumor-Induced Dendritic Cell Dysfunction in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Vaccines for Non-Viral Cancer Prevention.', 'Vaccines for immunoprevention of cancer.']"""

Understanding CYP17A1 multifunctional biochemistry is thus integral to treating prostate and breast cancer, subfertility, blood pressure, and other diseases. CYP17A1 structures with all four physiologically relevant steroid substrates suggest answers to four fundamental aspects of CYP17A1 function. First, all substrates bind in a similar overall orientation, rising ∼60° with respect to the heme. Second, both hydroxylase substrates pregnenolone and progesterone hydrogen bond to Asn(202) in orientations consistent with production of 17α-hydroxy major metabolites, but functional and structural evidence for an A105L mutation suggests that a minor conformation may yield the minor 16α-hydroxyprogesterone metabolite. Third, substrate specificity of the subsequent 17,20-lyase reaction may be explained by variation in substrate height above the heme. Although 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is only observed farther from the catalytic iron, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone is also observed closer to the heme. In conjunction with spectroscopic evidence, this suggests that only 17α-hydroxypregnenolone approaches and interacts with the proximal oxygen of the catalytic iron-peroxy intermediate, yielding efficient production of dehydroepiandrosterone as the key intermediate in human testosterone and estrogen synthesis. Fourth, differential positioning of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone offers a mechanism whereby allosteric binding of cytochrome b5 might selectively enhance the lyase reaction. In aggregate, these structures provide a structural basis for understanding multiple key reactions at the heart of human steroidogenesis.""","""['Elyse M Petrunak', 'Natasha M DeVore', 'Patrick R Porubsky', 'Emily E Scott']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Kinetic processivity of the two-step oxidations of progesterone and pregnenolone to androgens by human cytochrome P450 17A1.', 'Conformational selection dominates binding of steroids to human cytochrome P450 17A1.', 'Structural insights into the function of steroidogenic cytochrome P450 17A1.', 'Human cytochrome P450 17A1 conformational selection: modulation by ligand and cytochrome b5.', 'Insights into Interactions of Human Cytochrome P450 17A1: A Review.', 'Transcriptional changes in multiple endocrine organs from lethal cases of COVID-19.', 'Non-steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors: Discovery and Assessment.', 'Recombinant Technologies Facilitate Drug Metabolism, Pharmacokinetics, and General Biomedical Research.', 'Pyridine-containing substrate analogs are restricted from accessing the human cytochrome P450 8B1 active site by tryptophan 281.', 'Human cytochrome P450 17A1 structures with metabolites of prostate cancer drug abiraterone reveal substrate-binding plasticity and a second binding site.']"""

Recruitment for the largest therapeutic randomised controlled trial in PCa--the Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy: A Multi-Stage Multi-Arm Randomised Controlled Trial (STAMPEDE)--includes men with newly diagnosed metastatic PCa who are commencing long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); the control arm provides valuable data for a prospective cohort.  Objective:   Describe survival outcomes, along with current treatment standards and factors associated with prognosis, to inform future trial design in this patient group.  Design, setting, and participants:   STAMPEDE trial control arm comprising men newly diagnosed with M1 disease who were recruited between October 2005 and January 2014.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival (FFS) were reported by primary disease characteristics using Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from multivariate Cox models.  Results and limitations:   A cohort of 917 men with newly diagnosed M1 disease was recruited to the control arm in the specified interval. Median follow-up was 20 mo. Median age at randomisation was 66 yr (interquartile range [IQR]: 61-71), and median prostate-specific antigen level was 112 ng/ml (IQR: 34-373). Most men (n=574; 62%) had bone-only metastases, whereas 237 (26%) had both bone and soft tissue metastases; soft tissue metastasis was found mainly in distant lymph nodes. There were 238 deaths, 202 (85%) from PCa. Median FFS was 11 mo; 2-yr FFS was 29% (95% CI, 25-33). Median OS was 42 mo; 2-yr OS was 72% (95% CI, 68-76). Survival time was influenced by performance status, age, Gleason score, and metastases distribution. Median survival after FFS event was 22 mo. Trial eligibility criteria meant men were younger and fitter than general PCa population.  Conclusions:   Survival remains disappointing in men presenting with M1 disease who are started on only long-term ADT, despite active treatments being available at first failure of ADT. Importantly, men with M1 disease now spend the majority of their remaining life in a state of castration-resistant relapse.

Objective:   To develop and validate a nomogram to predict the probability of PCSM from the time of BCR among men with rising PSA levels after radical prostatectomy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 1987 and 2011, 2254 men treated by radical prostatectomy at one of five high-volume hospitals experienced BCR, defined as three successive PSA rises (final value >0.2 ng/ml), single PSA >0.4 ng/ml, or use of secondary therapy administered for detectable PSA >0.1 ng/ml. Clinical information and follow-up data were modeled using competing-risk regression analysis to predict PCSM from the time of BCR.  Intervention:   Radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer and subsequent PCa BCR.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PCSM.  Results and limitations:   The 10-yr PCSM and mortality from competing causes was 19% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16-21%) and 17% (95% CI 14-19%), respectively.

Significant parameters in the models were preoperative PSA, pathological Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, time to PCa BCR, PSA level at PCa BCR, and PSADT (all p<0.05).  Conclusions:   We constructed and validated a nomogram to predict the risk of PCSM at 10 yr among men with PCa BCR after radical prostatectomy.

It has already been reported that formononetin could inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in several cancers, including prostate cancer. This study aimed to further investigate whether cell cycle arrest is involved in formononetin-mediated antitumor effect in human prostate cancer cells, along with the underlying molecular mechanism.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cells PC-3 and DU145 were respectively treated with various concentrations of formononetin. The inhibitory effect of formononetin on proliferation of prostate cancer cells was determined using MTT assays and flow cytometry. Next, formononetin-induced alterations in cyclin D1, CDK4 and Akt expression in PC-3 cells were detected by real-time PCR and western blot.  Results:   Formononetin dose-dependently inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation via the induction of cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in vitro, which was more evident in PC-3 cells. Meanwhile, concomitant with reduced phosphorylation of Akt in PC-3 cells, formononetin remarkably downregulated expression levels of cyclin D1 and CDK4 in a dose-dependent manner. More interestingly, in the in vivo studies, formononetin showed a noticeable inhibition of tumor growth in recipient mice.  Conclusion:   Formononetin could exhibit inhibitory activity against human prostate cancer cells in vivo and in vitro, which is associated with G1 cell cycle arrest by inactivation of Akt/cyclin D1/CDK4.

Methods and materials:   One hundred ninety-eight consecutive patients treated for prostate cancer by iodine-125 seed brachytherapy were assessed. Prostate dosimetry was stratified according to British Columbia Cancer Agency criteria, with good implants having both V100 (percentage of target volume that receives 100% of the prescribed dose) > 85% and D90 (percentage of the prescribed dose received by 90% of the target volume) > 90%, suboptimal implants with V100 of 75-85%, or D90 80-90%, whereas poor implants were defined as those with V100 < 75 or D90 < 80%.

However, the increase in incidence has not been mirrored by a similar reduction in mortality. Widespread PSA testing has facilitated the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent disease. To reduce this phenomenon and avoid negative repercussions on the quality of life of men undergoing unnecessary therapies, the diagnostic pathway of prostate cancer needs to be improved. Multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of PSA, as well as the shortcomings of random biopsy sampling. This novel imaging technique has been proven to identify larger and more aggressive cancer foci, which should be targeted for treatment. New technological developments now allow for fusion of mp-MRI images with real-time ultrasound, opening the way to lesion-targeted biopsies. Furthermore, mp-MRI and targeted biopsies can also improve active surveillance protocols and permit more conservative focal therapy strategies. By implementing targeted biopsies, the diagnostic pathway will focus on clinically significant disease, consequently reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Before this novel protocol becomes the new gold standard, mp-MRI acquisition and interpretation need to be standardized and targeted-biopsy strategies need to be further validated prior to abandoning random-sampling ones. Several multidisciplinary consortiums are already working on the standardization of prostate MRI, and there are ongoing prospective trials on targeted biopsies and MRI. Soon, imaging of prostatic lesions and selected biopsies will modify the diagnostic evaluation of prostate cancer, reducing overtreatment and therapy-derived complications that negatively affect quality of life.""","""['Thomas J Polascik', ""Niccolo' M Passoni"", 'Arnauld Villers', 'Peter L Choyke']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Multiparametric MRI to improve detection of prostate cancer compared with transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy alone: the PROMIS study.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI of the prostate with three functional techniques in patients with PSA elevation before initial TRUS-guided biopsy.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (MRI/US)-fusion biopsy platforms in prostate cancer detection: a systematic review.', 'PSA Testing Use and Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Stage After the 2012 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Guideline Changes.', 'Deep neural maps for unsupervised visualization of high-grade cancer in prostate biopsies.', 'Observation versus treatment among men with favorable risk prostate cancer in a community-based integrated health care system: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Engaging the primary care community to encourage appropriate prostate cancer screening.', 'Comparative Study of Blood-Based Biomarkers, α2,3-Sialic Acid PSA and PHI, for High-Risk Prostate Cancer Detection.']"""

The primary aim was to evaluate the current evidence critically and to develop a consensus document on the approach to this difficult disease. The outcome applies to primary RPS that is nonvisceral in origin. The evaluation included sarcomas of major veins (inferior vena cava, renal vein, ovarian/testicular vein), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the psoas, and ureteric leiomyosarcoma (LMS). It excluded desmoid, lipoma and angiomyolipoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, visceral sarcomas such as those arising from the gut or its mesentery, uterine LMS, prostatic sarcoma, paratesticular/spermatic cord sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, alveolar/embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, primitive peripheral neuro-ectodermal tumor, sarcoma arising from teratoma, carcinosarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, clear cell sarcoma, radiation-induced sarcoma, paraganglioma, and malignant pheochromocytoma.  Results:   Management of RPS was evaluated from diagnosis to follow-up, and a level of evidence was attributed to each statement.

Methods:   A total of 20 consecutive patients suspicious of prostate cancer at the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging scan were recruited prospectively. Targeted biopsies were carried out for each cancer-suspicious lesion, and 12 systematic biopsies using the BioJet system. Pathological findings of targeted and systematic biopsies were analyzed.  Results:   The median age of the patients was 70 years (range 52-83 years). The median preoperative prostate-specific antigen value was 7.4 ng/mL (range 3.54-19.9 ng/mL). Median preoperative prostate volume was 38 mL (range 24-68 mL). The number of cancer-detected cases was 14 (70%). The median Gleason score was 6.5 (range 6-8). Cancer-detected rates of the systematic and targeted biopsy cores were 6.7 and 31.8%, respectively (P < 0.0001). In six patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, the geographic locations and pathological grades of clinically significant cancers and index lesions corresponded to the pathological results of the targeted biopsies.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancers detected by targeted biopsies with manually controlled targeted biopsy using real-time multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound fusion imaging have significantly higher grades and longer length compared with those detected by systematic biopsies.

Compared with related tirucallic acids, αATA(8,24) was the most potent inhibitor of the proliferation of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, in prostate cancer xenografted onto chick chorioallantoic membranes. αATA(8,24) induced loss of cell membrane asymmetry, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation in vitro and in vivo. These effects were selective for cancer cells, because αATA(8,24) exerted no overt toxic effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the chick embryo. At the molecular level, αATA(8,24) inhibited the Akt1 kinase activity. Prior to all biochemical signs of cellular dysfunction, αATA(8,24) induced inhibition of the Akt downstream target mTOR as indicated by dephosphorylation of S6K1. This event was followed by decreased expression of cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin B1, as well as cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK2 and phosphoretinoblastoma protein, which led to inhibition of the cell-cycle progression. In agreement with the mTOR inhibition, αATA(8,24) and rapamycin increased the volume of acidic vesicular organelles. In contrast to rapamycin, αATA(8,24) destabilized lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes and induced reactive oxygen species production in cancer cells. The ability of αATA(8,24) to inhibit Akt/mTOR signaling and to induce simultaneously oxidative stress could be exploited for the development of novel antitumor therapeutics with a lower profile of toxic side effects.""","""['Menna El Gaafary', 'Berthold Büchele', 'Tatiana Syrovets', 'Sara Agnolet', 'Bernd Schneider', 'Christoph Q Schmidt', 'Thomas Simmet']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Tirucallic acids are novel pleckstrin homology domain-dependent Akt inhibitors inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Embelin inhibits growth and induces apoptosis through the suppression of Akt/mTOR/S6K1 signaling cascades.', 'Piperlongumine, an alkaloid causes inhibition of PI3\xa0K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in human triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Promising Anticancer Activities of Alismatis rhizome and Its Triterpenes via p38 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathways.', 'The Fascinating Effects of Baicalein on Cancer: A Review.', 'Exploring the Phytochemicals and Anti-Cancer Potential of the Members of Fabaceae Family: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Synthesis of β-Enaminonitrile-Linked 8-Methoxy-1H-BenzofChromene Moieties and Analysis of Their Antitumor Mechanisms.', 'Chrysosplenol d, a Flavonol from Artemisia annua, Induces ERK1/2-Mediated Apoptosis in Triple Negative Human Breast Cancer Cells.', 'A Naturally Derived Carrier for Photodynamic Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma: In Vitro and In Vivo Models.', 'Establishment of xenografts of urological cancers on chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) to study metastasis.']"""

We investigated oxidative stress-related genetic variants in relation to advanced prostate cancer risk and examined potential interactions with pro- and antioxidant exposures.  Methods:   A case-cohort analysis was conducted in the prospective Netherlands Cohort Study, which included 58,279 men ages 55 to 69 years. Cohort members completed a baseline questionnaire and provided toenail clippings, which were used to isolate DNA. Advanced prostate cancer cases were identified during 17.3 years of follow-up. The analysis included 14 genetic variants and 11 exposures. Cox regression models were used for analysis and FDR Q-values were calculated.  Results:   Complete genotyping data were available for 952 cases and 1,798 subcohort members. CAT rs1001179 was associated with stage III/IV and stage IV prostate cancer risk, with HRs per minor allele of 1.16 [95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.01-1.33; P = 0.032] and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46; P = 0.006), respectively. We tested 151 gene-environment interactions in relation to both stage III/IV and IV prostate cancer risk. Seven interactions were statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing (FDR Q-value <0.20); for stage III/IV prostate cancer, these involved intake of β-carotene (GPX1 rs17650792, hOGG1 rs1052133) and heme iron (GPX1 rs1800668 and rs3448), and for stage IV prostate cancer, these involved intake of catechin (SOD2 rs4880) and heme iron (hOGG1 rs1052133, SOD1 rs10432782).

In a retrospective study we previously found that during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy this new technique could significantly shorten continence recovery time. We designed a prospective clinical trial to confirm this.  Materials and methods:   We designed a single-blind, parallel group, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 100 men who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy performed by a single surgeon at a referral center were randomly allocated to the intervention group (50) or the control group (50) from October 2012 through August 2013. The intervention group underwent posterior reconstruction with this new technique before vesicourethral anastomosis. All patients in each group were treated with anterior reconstruction. The study primary end point was time to continence recovery, defined as no pad use. Secondary outcomes were time to recovery of social continence, defined as 0 or 1 pad used per day.  Results:   One control was excluded from analysis due to open conversion and 4 patients were excluded since they withdrew from participation. Median time to complete continence recovery did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups (106 and 119 days, respectively, p = 0.890). However, time to social continence recovery was significantly shorter in the intervention group than in controls (median 18 vs 30 days, p = 0.024).

We compared the diagnostic potential of positron emission tomography (PET)-X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging using BAY1075553 versus [(18)F]f luorocholine (FCH) PET-CT.  Procedures:   Twelve prostate cancer patients (nine staging, three re-staging) were included. The mean prostate-specific antigen in the primary staging and re-staging groups was 21.5 ± 12 and 73.6 ± 33 ng/ml, respectively. Gleason score ranged from 5-9. In nine patients imaged for pre-operative staging, the median Gleason score was 8 (range, 7-9). PET acquisition started with dynamic PET images in the pelvic region followed by static whole-body acquisition. The patients were monitored for 5-8 days afterward for adverse events.  Results:   There were no relevant changes in laboratory values or physical examination. Urinary bladder wall received the largest dose equivalent 0.12 mSv/MBq. The whole-body mean effective dose was 0.015 mSv/MBq. There was a significant correlation between detected prostatic lesions by the two imaging modalities (Kappa = 0.356, P < 0.001) and no significant difference in sensitivity (P = 0.16) and specificity (P = 0.41). The sensitivity and specificity of PET imaging using BAY1075553 for lymph node (LN) staging was 42.9 % and 100 %, while it was 81.2 % and 50 % using FCH. The two modalities were closely correlated regarding detection of LNs and bone metastases, although BAY1075553 failed to detect a bone marrow metastasis. Degenerative bone lesions often displayed intense uptake of BAY1075553.  Conclusions:   BAY1075553 PET-CT produced no adverse effects, was well tolerated, and detected primary and metastatic prostate cancer.

To identify gene expression patterns associated with early testosterone-driven prostate carcinogenesis, which are impacted by dietary tomato and lycopene, wild-type (WT) and transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice were fed control or tomato- or lycopene-containing diets from 4 to 10 weeks of age. Eight-week-old mice underwent sham surgery, castration, or castration followed by testosterone repletion (2.5 mg/kg/d initiated 1 week after castration). Ten-week-old intact TRAMP mice exhibit early multifocal prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Of the 200 prostate cancer-related genes measured by quantitative NanoString, 189 are detectable, 164 significantly differ by genotype, 179 by testosterone status, and 30 by diet type (P < 0.05). In TRAMP, expression of Birc5, Mki67, Aurkb, Ccnb2, Foxm1, and Ccne2 is greater compared with WT and is decreased by castration. In parallel, castration reduces Ki67-positive staining (P < 0.0001) compared with intact and testosterone-repleted TRAMP mice. Expression of genes involved in androgen metabolism/signaling pathways is reduced by lycopene feeding (Srd5a1) and by tomato feeding (Srd5a2, Pxn, and Srebf1). In addition, tomato feeding significantly reduced expression of genes associated with stem cell features, Aldh1a and Ly6a, whereas lycopene feeding significantly reduced expression of neuroendocrine differentiation-related genes, Ngfr and Syp. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a profile of testosterone-regulated genes associated with early prostate carcinogenesis that are potential mechanistic targets of dietary tomato components.

Previous study found that HMGN5 is required for tumorigenesis in vitro, and aberrations in the expression of HMGN5 were found in human osteosarcoma, prostate cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma. Nevertheless, the role of HMGN5 in breast cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of HMGN5 in human breast cancer, confirm the oncogenic role of HMGN5, and explore the mechanism by which HMGN5 contributes to invasion and metastasis. HMGN5 expression was detected in breast cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues from 43 patients by immunohistochemistry, and the clinicopathologic characteristics of all patients were also analyzed. Next, knockdown of HMGN5 protein in MDA-MB-231 cells was performed through a small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique, and cell viability, apoptosis, and invasion were detected by cell vitality test, flow cytometry, and transwell assay, respectively. Immunohistostaining showed that HMGN5 were highly expressed in the nucleus in all breast cancer tissues as compared with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT;(73.5 ± 11 vs. 31.0 ± 5 %, P < 0.01). HMGN5 expression level was associated with the poorly differentiated tumor cells, lymph node involvement tumor, and T4 staging tumor. Knockdown of HMGN5 inhibited cell growth, suppressed invasion, and increased cell apoptosis in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the expressions of PCNA, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and MMP-9 were decreased in human breast MDA-MB-231 cells depleted of HMGN5.

The benefit of additional imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) to target biopsy remains to be fully addressed.  Methods:   Using a cohort of consecutive patients undergoing transperineal template mapping biopsies, we studied positive biopsies in the context of magnetic resonance imaging findings and examined the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in predicting the location of transperineal template mapping biopsies-detected prostate cancer.  Results:   Forty-four patients (mean age: 65 years, range 53-78) underwent transperineal template mapping biopsies. Thirty-four patients had 1-2 and 10 patients had ≥3 previous transrectal ultrasound scan-guided biopsies. The mean prostate-specific antigen was 15 ng/mL (range 2.5-79 ng/mL). High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was found in 12 (27%) patients and prostate cancer with Gleason <7, 7 and >7 in 13, 10 and 8 patients, respectively. Suspicious lesions on magnetic resonance imaging scans were scored from 1 to 5. In 28 patients, magnetic resonance imaging detected lesions with score ≥3. Magnetic resonance imaging correctly localised transperineal template mapping biopsies-detected prostate cancer in a hemi-gland approach, particularly in a right to left manner (79% positive prediction rate), but not in a quadrant approach (33% positive prediction rate).

Abiraterone is licensed in combination with prednisone 5 mg twice daily to prevent a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess. We hypothesised that a 'steroid switch' from prednisone to dexamethasone would induce secondary responses in patients progressing on abiraterone and prednisone 5 mg b.i.d.  Methods:   We performed a 'steroid switch' in patients with CRPC at PSA progression on abiraterone and prednisolone. Patients were monitored for secondary declines in PSA, radiological tumour regression and toxicity.  Results:   A retrospective analysis of 30 CRPC patients who underwent a steroid switch from prednisolone to dexamethasone while on abiraterone was performed. A total of six patients (20%) had a ⩾50% PSA decline that was confirmed by a second PSA level at least 3 weeks later. In all, 11 patients (39.2%) had a confirmed ⩾30% PSA decline. Median time to PSA progression on abiraterone and dexamethasone was 11.7 weeks (95% CI: 8.6-14.8 weeks) in the whole cohort and 27.6 weeks (95% CI: 14.5-40.7 weeks) in patients who achieved a confirmed 50% PSA decline. Nine patients had RECIST evaluable disease: two of these patients had RECIST partial response, six patients had stable disease and one patient had progressive disease at the first imaging assessment. Treatment was well tolerated, with no grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events. One patient had to be reverted to prednisolone because of grade 2 hypotension.

The objective of the study was to examine whether sarcosine influences EC function and affects angiogenesis.  Materials and methods:   The effect of sarcosine was studied using different model systems including chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), rat aortic rings in culture, and human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) in culture. The statistical significance of difference was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test using GraphPad 5 software.  Results:   Increased vascularization in CAM, increased endothelial sprouting in rat aortic rings in culture, and increased expression of CD31 and E-selectin suggested a possible angiogenic effect of sarcosine. Sarcosine modulated expression of angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In ECs in culture LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) reversed the effect of sarcosine.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective study was carried out on 30 patients, who received radiotherapy to the Brain, Head and Neck, and Pelvis. In the OPI technique, anterior-posterior and right-lateral portal images were taken by the On Board Imaging (OBI) system and were superimposed on the reference images. Similarly, in the kV-CBCT technique, CBCT was performed by the OBI system and CBCT images were superimposed on the reference CT images. A total of 150 comparison sets of kV-OPI and kV-CBCT images were analyzed and evaluated. Shifts in the Lateral, Longitudinal, and Vertical directions were noted in both techniques. The iso displacement vector (IDV) was calculated for all imaging.  Results:   The mean IDV (in cm) are found to be 0.3395 (SD: 0.1477) and 0.3088 (SD: 0.1593) in cases of the brain, 0.4266 (SD: 0.1511) and 0.3666 (SD: 0.1533) in cases of the head and neck, and 1.0339 (SD: 0.5893) and 0.9498 (SD: 0.6047) in cases of the pelvis for the CBCT and OPI techniques, respectively. The P values were 0.3201, 0.0515, and 0.4829 for the brain, head and neck, and pelvic cases, respectively.  Conclusions:   There is statistically no significant difference between both the imaging techniques. As the dose delivered by the CBCT technique is higher than that by the OPI technique, from the socioeconomical and radiation safety point of view, the OPI technique is possibly better than the CBCT technique. Hence, it can be concluded that CBCT is not a mandatory technique compared to the OPI technique in routine brain, head and neck, and pelvic cases, except in those cases where better information about interfraction movements of soft tissue is necessarily required for positioning of the target, as is the case in prostate carcinoma.""","""['Om Prakash Gurjar', 'Surendra Prasad Mishra', 'Virendra Bhandari', 'Pankaj Pathak', 'Sidharth Pant', 'Prapti Patel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['Dose calculation and treatment plan optimization including imaging dose from kilovoltage cone beam computed tomography.', 'Phantom and in-vivo measurements of dose exposure by image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT): MV portal images vs. kV portal images vs. cone-beam CT.', 'Radiation exposure to patients from image guidance procedures and techniques to reduce the imaging dose.', 'Refinement of treatment setup and target localization accuracy using three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography for stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of setup accuracy for NSCLC patients; studying the impact of different types of cone-beam CT matches based on whole thorax, columna vertebralis, and GTV.', 'A study on prostate movement and dosimetric variation because of bladder and rectum volumes changes during the course of image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'A prospective observational study to analyse the influence of bladder and rectal volume changes on prostate radiotherapy using IMRT.', 'Craniospinal Irradiation in Medulloblastoma using High Energy Medical Linear Accelerator: an Innovative Approach to Planning Technique.', 'Value of Three-Dimensional Imaging Systems for Image-Guided Carbon Ion Radiotherapy.', 'A Dosimetric Study on Slab-pinewood-slab Phantom for Developing the Heterogeneous Chest Phantom Mimicking Actual Human Chest.']"""

Recently, 4 novel therapies have been introduced for the treatment of mCRPC; of these, abiraterone and sipuleucel-T have been studied in the asymptomatic, pre-docetaxel population. Both have shown clinical benefits compared with placebo. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of abiraterone acetate and sipuleucel-T compared with prednisone in asymptomatic, pre-docetaxel mCRPC from a US societal perspective. A Markov model was constructed to simulate stable disease, progressed disease, and death. Survival and event rates were derived from published clinical trial data. Costs were derived from the literature and government reimbursement schedules. Outcomes were measured as average cost-effectiveness ratios (ACERs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. The base-case ACER was $114K/quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for abiraterone, $85K/QALY for sipuleucel-T, and $31K/QALY for prednisone. The base-case ICER was $389K/QALY for abiraterone and $547K/QALY for sipuleucel-T. Prednisone dominates both abiraterone and sipuleucel-T in terms of NMB at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $400K or less.

However, severe pharmacological limitations have challenged their clinical testing. The synthetic FASN inhibitor triclosan, which was initially developed as a topical antibacterial agent, is merely affected by these pharmacological limitations. Yet, little is known about its mechanism in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. Here we compared the cellular and molecular effects of triclosan in a panel of eight malignant and non-malignant prostate cell lines to the well-known FASN inhibitors C75 and orlistat, which target different partial catalytic activities of FASN. Triclosan displayed a superior cytotoxic profile with a several-fold lower IC50 than C75 or orlistat. Structure-function analysis revealed that alcohol functionality of the parent phenol is critical for inhibitory action. Rescue experiments confirmed that end product starvation was a major cause of cytotoxicity. Importantly, triclosan, C75 and orlistat induced distinct changes to morphology, cell cycle, lipid content and the expression of key enzymes of lipid metabolism, demonstrating that inhibition of different partial catalytic activities of FASN activates different metabolic pathways. These finding combined with its well-documented pharmacological safety profile make triclosan a promising drug candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Martin C Sadowski', 'Rebecca H Pouwer', 'Jennifer H Gunter', 'Amy A Lubik', 'Ronald J Quinn', 'Colleen C Nelson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Overexpression of fatty acid synthase in human gliomas correlates with the WHO tumor grade and inhibition with Orlistat reduces cell viability and triggers apoptosis.', 'Therapeutic and toxicologic evaluation of anti-lipogenic agents in cancer cells compared with non-neoplastic cells.', 'Fatty Acid Inhibition Sensitizes Androgen-Dependent and -Independent Prostate Cancer to Radiotherapy via FASN/NF-κB Pathway.', 'Orlistat as a FASN inhibitor and multitargeted agent for cancer therapy.', 'Pharmacological inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN)--catalyzed endogenous fatty acid biogenesis: a new family of anti-cancer agents?', 'Role of EGFR and FASN in breast cancer progression.', 'Metabolic reprogramming in cancer: Mechanisms and therapeutics.', 'Dysfunctional Lipid Metabolism-The Basis for How Genetic Abnormalities Express the Phenotype of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Approaches to Measuring the Activity of Major Lipolytic and Lipogenic Enzymes In Vitro and Ex Vivo.', 'Lipid metabolism in tumor microenvironment: novel therapeutic targets.']"""

The high accumulation of myofibroblasts in reactive stroma is predictive of the rate of cancer progression in many different tumors, yet the cell types of origin and the mechanisms that regulate proliferation and differentiation are unknown. We report here, for the first time to our knowledge, the characterization of normal human prostate-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the TGF-β1-regulated pathways that modulate MSC proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation. Human prostate MSCs combined with prostate cancer cells expressing TGF-β1 resulted in commitment to myofibroblasts. TGF-β1-regulated runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) was required for cell cycle progression and proliferation of progenitors. RUNX1 also inhibited, yet did not block, differentiation. Knockdown of RUNX1 in prostate or bone marrow-derived MSCs resulted in cell cycle arrest, attenuated proliferation, and constitutive differentiation to myofibroblasts. These data show that RUNX1 is a key transcription factor for MSC proliferation and cell fate commitment in myofibroblast differentiation. This work also shows that the normal human prostate gland contains tissue-derived MSCs that exhibit multilineage differentiation similar to bone marrow-derived MSCs.

This information can be derived from the results of clinical trials with the aid of microsimulation models.  Methods:   Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and individual-level data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovarian Cancer Screening trial (PLCO) were used to investigate the sensitivity (by histology and stage) of CT and chest radiography (CXR) and the mean preclinical sojourn time (MPST) of lung cancer (by gender, histology, and stage). The MISCAN-Lung model was used to reproduce the lung cancer incidence by method of detection (clinically or screen-detected), gender, histology, and stage in both trials and SEER, by calibrating CT and CXR sensitivity and natural history parameters.  Results:   CT sensitivity ranges from 8.83% to 99.35% and CXR sensitivity from 2.51% to 97.31%, depending on histology and stage. CT sensitivity for stage IA is more than 3-fold higher compared with CXR, for all histologies. The total MPST estimates for lung cancer progressing through preclinical stages IA to IV range from 3.09 to 5.32 years for men and 3.35 to 6.01 years for women. The largest difference in total MPST between genders was estimated for adenocarcinoma.  Conclusions:   We estimate longer MPSTs for lung cancer compared with previous research, suggesting a greater window of opportunity for lung cancer screening.

This behavior is associated with poor clinical outcomes; therefore, it is critical to identify novel ligand-receptor interactions between nerves and cancer cells that support the process of perineural invasion. A proteomic profiler chemokine array was used to screen for nerve-derived factors secreted from tissue explants of dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and CCL2 was identified as a lead candidate. Prostate cancer cell line expression of CCR2, the receptor to CCL2, correlated closely with MAPK and Akt pathway activity and cell migration towards CCL2 and DRG. In vitro nerve and cancer coculture invasion assays of perineural invasion demonstrated that cancer cell CCR2 expression facilitates perineural invasion. Perineural invasion is significantly diminished in coculture assays when using DRG harvested from CCL2(-/-) knockout mice as compared with control CCL2(+/+) mice, indicating that CCR2 is required for perineural invasion in this murine model of perineural invasion. Furthermore, 20 of 21 (95%) patient specimens of prostate adenocarcinoma with perineural invasion exhibited CCR2 expression by immunohistochemistry, while just 3 of 13 (23%) lacking perineural invasion expressed CCR2. In summary, nerve-released CCL2 supports prostate cancer migration and perineural invasion though CCR2-mediated signaling.

The serum protein profiles appear to provide cancer-specific fingerprints that help to discriminate patients (especially with low PSA level) from controls, improving the performance of existing clinical tests.  Methods:   Samples from healthy controls and PCa patients with low (≤4 ng/mL) and high PSA (>4 ng/mL) levels were analyzed by MALDI profiling, and by a multi fractionation approach coupled to ESI-MS for peaks identification.  Results:   MALDI profiling achieved to detect 10 and 14 changed peaks (p-value <0.05), respectively, in PCa patients with low and high PSA versus controls. In particular, a peak identified as C3f fragment, resulted overexpressed in low PSA PCa patients.  Conclusions:   PSA test, coupled to MALDI profiling, is able to detect changes, specifically related to PCa, in low molecular weight protein range.

We sought to compare the changing clinical characteristics of patients undergoing TURP and laser vaporization of the prostate (LVP) over time.  Methods:   The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried for men who underwent TURP and LVP from 2007 to 2012. Patient demographics, clinical and intraoperative characteristics and 30-day postoperative outcomes were analyzed.  Results:   In all, 12,645 men met inclusion criteria, of whom 65% underwent TURP and 35% underwent LVP. Overall, men undergoing TURP were more likely to be scheduled as an emergency (3% vs. 1%, P<0.001), have shorter operative times (53 vs. 56 min, P<0.001), longer hospital stays (2.4 vs 1.0 days, P<0.001), more frequent blood transfusions (2.1% vs. 0.6%, P<0.001) and more postoperative complications including: pneumonia (0.5% vs. 0.3%, P=0.02), septic shock (0.3% vs. 0.1%, P=0.045), and reoperation within 30 days (2.2% vs. 1.4%, P=0.06).

Yet, CaP is still the second cause of cancer death in men. We used two monthly curated databases of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) to describe the natural history of patients dying of CaP in the modern era.  Methods:   The outcome of 190 men with metastatic CRPC treated from 2008 to 2011 was studied. The characteristics of the patients who died from CaP (n = 113 patients, 61%) were analyzed.  Results:   All 113 patients who died of CaP were assessable for the presence of metastases at diagnosis. Sixty-three patients (56%) had detectable metastases at diagnosis: 67%, 11% and 43% had bone, visceral and lymph node metastases, respectively. The median time to CRPC was 16 months and median overall survival (OS) was 5.2 years.Among the patients with localized CaP at diagnosis (n = 50, 44%), 46% had T stage ⩾ 3 and 38% had a Gleason score ⩾ 8. Overall, 64% of patients were classified as having a high-risk CaP. Only 26% who died from CaP had a Gleason score ⩽ 6. Median OS was 8.8 years.  Conclusions:   In the modern era, approximately half of the patients who die from CaP have metastases at diagnosis. The paradigm of progression from localized disease to metastasis and eventually death is only represented in the other half, although possible initial screening and staging errors ought to be taken into consideration.

Therefore, we sought to assess the differences in perioperative outcomes and hospital reimbursement in a privately insured patient population who were surgically treated for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using a large private insurance database, we identified 17,610 prostate cancer patients who underwent either MIRP or ORP from 2003 to 2010. The primary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), perioperative complications, 90-day readmissions rates and hospital reimbursement. Multivariable regression analyses were used to evaluate for differences in primary outcomes across surgical approaches.  Results:   Overall, 8981 (51.0%) and 8629 (49.0%) surgically treated prostate cancer patients underwent MIRP and ORP, respectively. The proportion of patients undergoing MIRP markedly rose from 11.9% in 2003 to 72.5% in 2010 (P<0.001 for trend). Relative to ORP, MIRP was associated with a shorter median LOS (1.0 day vs 3.0 days; P<0.001) and lower adjusted odds ratio of perioperative complications (OR: 0.82; P<0.001).

A designed PA analogue; DENSpm, induces cell cycle arrest, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in melanoma, breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer cells. Although the mechanism by which DENSpm induces apoptosis has been examined, the effect of DENSpm on autophagy has not been investigated yet. Therefore, in this study, our objective was to determine the role of p53 in the DENSpm-induced autophagy/apoptotic regulation in a time-dependent manner in colon cancer cells. Exposure of HCT 116 colon cancer cells to DENSpm decreased cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, the p53 mutant, SW480, and deficient HCT 116 p53(-/-) cells were more resistant to DENSpm treatment compared to HCT 116 p53(+/+) cells. The resistant profile caused by p53 defect also caused a cell type-specific response to PA pool depletion and SSAT overexpression. In addition to PA depletion, DENSpm induced apoptosis by activating the mitochondria-mediated pathway in a caspase-dependent manner regardless of p53 expression in colon cancer cells. Concomitantly, we determined that DENSpm also affected autophagy in HCT 116 p53(+/+), SW480 and HCT 116 p53(-/-) colon cancer cells for different periods of exposure to DENSpm. Therefore, this study revealed that effect of DENSpm on cell death differs due to p53 protein expression profile.

Outcomes are improved by concomitant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with radiation therapy, but not by concomitant ADT with surgery. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa; leuprolide acetate) does not reduce serum androgens as effectively as abiraterone acetate (AA), a prodrug of abiraterone, a CYP17 inhibitor that lowers serum testosterone (< 1 ng/dL) and improves survival in metastatic PCa. The possibility that greater androgen suppression in patients with localized high-risk PCa will result in improved clinical outcomes makes paramount the reassessment of neoadjuvant ADT with more robust androgen suppression.  Patients and methods:   A neoadjuvant randomized phase II trial of LHRHa with AA was conducted in patients with localized high-risk PCa (N = 58). For the first 12 weeks, patients were randomly assigned to LHRHa versus LHRHa plus AA. After a research prostate biopsy, all patients received 12 additional weeks of LHRHa plus AA followed by prostatectomy.  Results:   The levels of intraprostatic androgens from 12-week prostate biopsies, including the primary end point (dihydrotestosterone/testosterone), were significantly lower (dehydroepiandrosterone, Δ(4)-androstene-3,17-dione, dihydrotestosterone, all P < .001; testosterone, P < .05) with LHRHa plus AA compared with LHRHa alone. Prostatectomy pathologic staging demonstrated a low incidence of complete responses and minimal residual disease, with residual T3- or lymph node-positive disease in the majority.  Conclusion:   LHRHa plus AA treatment suppresses tissue androgens more effectively than LHRHa alone. Intensive intratumoral androgen suppression with LHRHa plus AA before prostatectomy for localized high-risk PCa may reduce tumor burden.""","""['Mary-Ellen Taplin', 'Bruce Montgomery', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Glenn J Bubley', 'Jerome P Richie', 'Bruce L Dalkin', 'Martin G Sanda', 'John W Davis', 'Massimo Loda', 'Lawrence D True', 'Patricia Troncoso', 'Huihui Ye', 'Rosina T Lis', 'Brett T Marck', 'Alvin M Matsumoto', 'Steven P Balk', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Trevor M Penning', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Wanling Xie', 'Zhenyang Jiang', 'Christopher M Haqq', 'Daniel Tamae', 'NamPhuong Tran', 'Weimin Peng', 'Thian Kheoh', 'Arturo Molina', 'Philip W Kantoff']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Can targeting the androgen receptor in localized prostate cancer provide insights into why men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer die?', 'Re: Intense androgen-deprivation therapy with abiraterone acetate plus leuprolide acetate in patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer: results of a randomized phase II neoadjuvant study.', 'External beam radiation therapy and abiraterone in men with localized prostate cancer: safety and effect on tissue androgens.', 'Evaluation of Intense Androgen Deprivation Before Prostatectomy: A Randomized Phase II Trial of Enzalutamide and Leuprolide With or Without Abiraterone.', 'Clinical and Biological Characterisation of Localised High-risk Prostate Cancer: Results of a Randomised Preoperative Study of a Luteinising Hormone-releasing Hormone Agonist with or Without Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone.', 'Abiraterone acetate/androgen deprivation therapy combination versus docetaxel/androgen deprivation therapy combination in advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a network meta-analysis on safety and efficacy.', 'Abiraterone acetate: oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy plus abiraterone or docetaxel as neoadjuvant therapy for very-high-risk prostate cancer: a pooled analysis of two phase II trials.', 'Neoadjuvant Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors before Radical Prostatectomy for Non-Metastatic Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'A cohort analysis of patients receiving neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy prior to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy during the Covid-19 pandemic.', 'ROLE OF ANDROGEN RECEPTOR-TARGETED AGENTS IN LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER.', 'Adrenal Steroids and Resistance to Hormonal Blockade of Prostate and Breast Cancer.']"""

The product of the SRD5A2 gene, membrane‑bound steroid 5‑α‑reductase, type II enzyme, is key in testosterone metabolism. The present study explored the association between the SRD5A2 V89L gene polymorphism and the risk of developing prostate cancer. The study cohort consisted of 456 male Slovak patients, including 260 cases with histologically confirmed prostate cancer and 196 age‑matched controls without any clinically suspected infections of the prostate. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to detect the SRD5A2 polymorphism on codon 89. Odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for different allele variants were calculated in order to determine the association between the SRD5A2 V89L gene polymorphism and prostate cancer. The distribution of V89L variants in the control group was consistent with the Hardy‑Weinberg equilibrium (χ2 test, P=0.266) with a significant deviation in the case group (χ2 test, P=0.04). However, no association between the SRD5A2 polymorphism and an increased risk of developing prostate cancer was identified. When the wild type VV variant was used as a reference, the ORs for different allele variants ranged from 1.11 (95% CI 0.66‑1.87, P=0.70) for the LL genotype to 0.99 (95% CI 0.68‑1.46, P=0.99) for the LL + VL genotypes. No particular allele variant was identified to exhibit an increased capacity to promote the development of highly aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason ≥7) or induce carcinogenesis at an earlier onset (<65 years of age). It was confirmed that in the population studied, the SRD5A2 V89L polymorphism was not associated with the risk of prostate cancer and SRD5A2 was not shown to be a key gene involved in prostate cancer development. Published data indicate that a combination of multiple genetic changes are required for prostate cancer development, rather than a single gene change. Therefore, it was hypothesized that high-throughput genotyping may be more effective than single nucleotide polymorphism detection.""","""['Róbert Dušenka', 'Roman Tomaškin', 'Ján Kliment', 'Dušan Dobrota', 'Svetlana Dušenková', 'Marta Vilčková', ""Monika Kmeť'ová Sivoňová""]""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['V89L polymorphism of the testosterone 5-alpha-reductase II gene and prognostic factors of prostate cancer.', 'Polymorphic markers in the SRD5A2 gene and prostate cancer risk: a population-based case-control study.', 'Association of V89L SRD5A2 polymorphism with prostate cancer development in a Japanese population.', 'Steroid 5-{alpha}-reductase Type 2 (SRD5a2) gene polymorphisms and risk of prostate cancer: a HuGE review.', 'Genotyping the High Altitude Mestizo Ecuadorian Population Affected with Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of CD5L and SRD5A2 as Prognostic Biomarkers for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Prostate cancer between prognosis and adequate/proper therapy.']"""

Objective:   We sought to characterize the natural history and predictors of outcome for patients experiencing BF in a large cohort of men with localized prostate cancer undergoing definitive dose-escalated EBRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective analysis included 2694 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with EBRT at a large academic center. Of these, 609 experienced BF, defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir + 2 ng/ml. The median follow-up was 83 mo for all patients and 122 mo for BF patients.  Intervention(s):   All patients received EBRT at doses of 75.6-86.4 Gy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary objective of this study was to determine predictors of distant progression at the time of BF. Cox proportional hazards models were used in univariate and multivariate analyses of distant metastases (DM), and a competing risks method was used to analyze prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).  Results and limitations:   From the date of BF, the median times to DM and PCSM mortality were 5.4 yr and 10.5 yr, respectively. Shorter posttreatment PSA doubling time, a higher initial clinical tumor stage, a higher pretreatment Gleason score, and a shorter interval from the end of radiotherapy to BF were independent predictors for clinical progression following BF. Patients with two of these risk factors had a significantly higher incidence of DM and PCSM following BF than those with zero or one risk factor. The main limitations of this study are its retrospective nature and heterogeneous salvage interventions.  Conclusions:   Clinical and pathologic factors can help identify patients at high risk of clinical progression following BF.  Patient summary:   In this report, we look at predictors of outcome for patients with prostate cancer recurrence, as determined by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, following radiation treatment. We found that the approximate median times to distant metastasis and death from prostate cancer for patients in this situation were 5 yr and 10 yr, respectively. Furthermore, we found that patients with a rapid increase in PSA levels following treatment, a short time to PSA recurrence, invasion of extraprostatic organs, or a high Gleason score had worse outcomes.""","""['Zachary S Zumsteg', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Paul B Romesser', 'Xin Pei', 'Zhigang Zhang', 'William Polkinghorn', 'Sean McBride', 'Marisa Kollmeier', 'Yoshiya Yamada', 'Michael J Zelefsky']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate cancer: predicting outcomes of recurrence after escalated-dose radiotherapy.', 'Natural History after Biochemical Failure Following Dose-escalated External Beam Radiation: An Opportunity to Improve Outcomes?', 'Dose escalation for prostate cancer radiotherapy: predictors of long-term biochemical tumor control and distant metastases-free survival outcomes.', 'Impact of biochemical failure on overall survival after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer in the PSA era.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Bounce After Dose-Escalated External Beam Radiation Therapy Is an Independent Predictor of PSA Recurrence, Metastasis, and Survival in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Patients.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'Local Failure Events in Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiotherapy: A Pooled Analysis of 18 Randomized Trials from the Meta-analysis of Randomized Trials in Cancer of the Prostate Consortium (LEVIATHAN).', 'Toxicity and Outcomes of Moderately Hypofractionated Radiation for Prostate Cancer With Seminal Vesicle Involvement.', 'Dose-escalated radiotherapy for clinically localized and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific Antigen Levels Following Brachytherapy Impact Late Biochemical Recurrence in Japanese Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Construction and validation of a fatty acid metabolism-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and therapeutic response in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Patient-specific forecasting of postradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen kinetics enables early prediction of biochemical relapse.']"""

Objective:   To compare in-hospital characteristics and patient-reported outcomes at 3 mo between robot-assisted laparoscopic and open retropubic radical prostatectomy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective, controlled trial was performed of all men who underwent radical prostatectomy at 14 participating centres. Validated patient questionnaires were collected at baseline and after 3 mo by independent health-care researchers.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The difference in outcome between the two treatment groups were analysed using logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for identified confounders.  Results and limitations:   Questionnaires were received from 2506 (95%) patients. The robot-assisted surgery group had less perioperative bleeding (185 vs 683 ml, p<0.001) and shorter hospital stay (3.3 vs 4.1 d, p<0.001) than the open surgery group. Operating time was shorter with the open technique (103 vs 175 min, p<0.001) compared with the robot-assisted technique.

Men who underwent open surgery were more likely to seek healthcare (for one or more of 22 specified disorders identified prestudy) compared to men in the robot-assisted surgery group (p=0.03). It was more common to seek healthcare for cardiovascular reasons in the open surgery group than in the robot-assisted surgery group, after adjusting for nontumour and tumour-specific confounders, (7.9% vs 5.8%, OR 0.63, CI 95% 0.42-0.94). The readmittance rate was not statistically different between the groups. A limitation of the study is the lack of a standardised tool for the assessment of the adverse events.  Conclusions:   This large prospective study confirms previous findings that robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is a safe procedure with some short-term advantages compared to open surgery.

Thus, we aimed at establishing a high-performance noninvasive DNA methylation assay based on pyrosequencing for screening of prostate cancer in this article. The assay is designed to detect aberrant promoter methylation of RARβ2 gene in ejaculate samples. The negative and positive control plasmids were constructed with different treatments by direct bisulfite conversion or conversion after Sss I Methylase methylation to establish quality control standard. The ejaculate and tissue samples were collected from patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of prostate (n = 43) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 40). Significant correlation was observed between prostate cancer and methylation level of RARβ2 gene promoter. In addition, the results of pyrosequencing in ejaculate samples were compared with that of DNA sequencing in tissue samples from the same patients. There is no significant difference in the detection of RARβ2 promotor methylation between these two methods (p < 0.05). In conclusion, we have developed a high-performance noninvasive DNA methylation assay based on pyrosequencing which is more suitable for high-throughput detection of aberrant promoter methylation in ejaculate samples. Moreover, the acceptive degree of this noninvasive method makes it potentially promising for future screening of prostate cancer.""","""['Tong Zhang', 'Lei Zhang', 'Qinggong Yuan', 'Xiangling Wang', 'Yi Zhang', 'Jinhua Wang', 'Yanping Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Biochem Biophys""","""['Formamide as a denaturant for bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA: Bisulfite sequencing of the GSTPi and RARbeta2 genes of 43 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostate cancer specimens.', 'Retinoic acid receptor β2 (RARβ2): nonivasive biomarker for distinguishing malignant versus benign prostate lesions from bodily fluids.', 'Detection of aberrant promoter methylation of GSTP1, RASSF1A, and RARβ2 in serum DNA of patients with breast cancer by a newly established one-step methylation-specific PCR assay.', 'The association of retinoic acid receptor beta2(RARβ2) methylation status and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The emerging roles of DNA methylation in the clinical management of prostate cancer.', 'Downregulation of HMGA2 inhibits cellular proliferation and invasion, improves cellular apoptosis in prostate cancer.']"""

We evaluated the effect of nerve-sparing procedures on risk of positive SM for pT2- and pT3-category tumors. We hypothesized that nerve sparing would increase rates of pT2 positive margins.  Methods:   We evaluated a historical cohort of 9,915 consecutive RP patients treated at The Ottawa Hospital or Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 2000 to 2010. Patients underwent open, laparoscopic, or robotic RP. The primary outcome was presence of a positive SM stratified by pathologic pT2 and pT3 categories. The association between nerve sparing and positive margin was adjusted for prostate-specific antigen, RP Gleason sum, surgical modality, surgical date, and location in the multivariable model.  Results:   Of 6,120 eligible patients, 3,958 (64.7%) had open RP, 1,566 (25.6%) had laparoscopic RP, and 596 (9.7%) had robotic RP. Approximately 8.6% (363/4,199) of patients with pT2-category disease and 25.2% (485/1,921) of patients with pT3-category disease had a positive margin. Patients with pT2-category disease who underwent a bilateral nerve-sparing procedure were more likely to have a positive margin when compared with those who underwent nerve resection on multivariable analysis (relative risk [RR] = 1.52, 95% CI: 0.97-2.39) after adjusting for confounders. Patients with pT3-category disease who underwent a bilateral nerve-sparing procedure had no associated increase in risk of positive margin after adjustment for other variables (RR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80-1.16). Prostate incision into tumor (pT2R1) was significantly more likely in patients treated with robotic surgery (RR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.25-2.48) than in those with open surgery. There was no difference between laparoscopic and open RP (RR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.65-1.12).

The presence of IDC-P was considered as an adverse pathological factor, which was associated with high Gleason score, large prostate volume and accelerated disease progression. However, no any information is available on the presence of IDC-P diagnosed by needle biopsy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. We investigated the incidence and prognostic value of intraductal carcinoma of prostate (IDC-P) in initial diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   We included 278 patients with initial diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer treated between 2008 and 2011, all the pathological diagnosis were from ultrasonic-guided transperineal needle biopsy. IDC-P was strictly defined according to Epstein's criteria. Analyzed factors included age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, clinical T staging, Gleason scores, baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), hemoglobin (HGB), PSA normalization, and the presence of IDC-P.  Results:   Totally, IDC-P was found in 57/278 (20.5%) cases. Univariate analysis showed that, compared with cases without IDC-P, cases with IDC-P was definitely associated with much shorter CRPC-free survival (CFS) time (46.05 ± 1.39 vs. 22.98 ± 1.80 months, P = 0.000) and OS time (50.38 ± 1.18 vs. 36.43 ± 2.10 months, P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of IDC-P was the only independent prognostic factor associated with poor CFS (HR = 4.886, P = 0.011) and OS (HR = 1.945, P = 0.020). Further sub-analysis showed, even among patients with higher Gleason score (≥8) (n = 158), IDC-P was still significantly and inversely associated with CFS and OS (the median CFS time: 40 versus 22 months; P = 0.000; the median OS time: 54 vs. 36 months, P = 0.000). Again, Cox's regression model confirmed that only the presence of IDC-P was still not only an independent prognostic factor predicting shorter time of CRPC (HR = 4.031, P = 0.035), but also for poorer OS (HR = 2.499, P = 0.006).  Conclusions:   The presence of IDC-P in initial diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, even among patients with more aggressive pattern, was firstly found to be significantly and independently associated with earlier occurrence of CRPC and poorer OS. We recommended the presence of IDC-P should be a routine record in pathological report of clinical diagnosis and other potential therapeutic regimen might be added to intervene in the integrated therapy as early as possible.

One of AMACR's primary substrates, phytanic acid, is derived predominately from red meat and dairy product consumption. Epidemiological evidence suggests links between dairy/red meat intake, as well as phytanic acid levels, and elevated PCa risk. This study investigates the relationships among dietary intake, serum and tissue concentrations of phytanic acid, and AMACR expression (mRNA and protein) in the histologically benign human prostate.  Methods:   Men undergoing radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localized disease provided a food frequency questionnaire (n = 68), fasting blood (n = 35), benign fresh frozen prostate tissue (n = 26), and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections (n = 67). Serum and tissue phytanic acid concentrations were obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We extracted RNA from epithelial cells using laser capture microdissection and quantified mRNA expression of AMACR and other genes involved in the peroxisomal phytanic acid metabolism pathway via qRT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry for AMACR was performed on FFPE sections and subsequently quantified via digital image analysis. Associations between diet, serum, and tissue phytanic acid levels, as well as AMACR and other gene expression levels were assessed by partial Spearman correlation coefficients.  Results:   High-fat dairy intake was the strongest predictor of circulating phytanic acid concentrations (r = 0.35, P = 0.04). Tissue phytanic acid concentrations were not associated with any dietary sources and were only weakly correlated with serum levels (r = 0.29, P = 0.15). AMACR gene expression was not associated with serum phytanic acid (r = 0.13, P = 0.47), prostatic phytanic acid concentrations (r = 0.03, P = 0.88), or AMACR protein expression (r = -0.16, P = 0.20).  Conclusions:   Our data underscore the complexity of the relationship between AMACR and its substrates and do not support the unifying hypothesis that excess levels of dietary phytanic acid are responsible for both the overexpression of AMACR in prostate cancer and the potential association between PCa risk and intake of dairy foods and red meat.""","""['Yachana Kataria', 'Margaret Wright', 'Ryan J Deaton', 'Erika Enk Rueter', 'Benjamin A Rybicki', 'Ann B Moser', 'Vijayalakshmi Ananthanrayanan', 'Peter H Gann']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['AMACR polymorphisms, dietary intake of red meat and dairy and prostate cancer risk.', 'Branched fatty acids in dairy and beef products markedly enhance alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase expression in prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Serum phytanic and pristanic acid levels and prostate cancer risk in Finnish smokers.', 'Phytanic acid, AMACR and prostate cancer risk.', 'Phytanic acid--an overlooked bioactive fatty acid in dairy fat?', 'Phytol and its metabolites phytanic and pristanic acids for risk of cancer: current evidence and future directions.', 'The peroxisome: an update on mysteries 2.0.', 'Milk fat components with potential anticancer activity-a review.', 'Phytanic Acid-Induced Neurotoxicological Manifestations and Apoptosis Ameliorated by Mitochondria-Mediated Actions of Melatonin.']"""

In this study, we investigated the expression of the neuroendocrine secretory protein secretogranin II (SgII) in PCa, and its potential involvement in the progression of this cancer as a granulogenic factor promoting NED.  Methods:   We have examined SgII immunoreactivity in 25 benign prostate hyperplasia and 32 PCa biopsies. In vitro experiments were performed to investigate the involvement of SgII in the neuroendocrine differentiation and the proliferation of PCa cell lines.  Results:   We showed that immunoreactive SgII intensity correlates with tumour grade in PCa patients. Using the androgen-dependent lymph node cancer prostate cells (LNCaP) cells, we found that NED triggered by androgen deprivation is associated with the induction of SgII expression. In addition, forced expression of SgII in LNCaP cells implemented a regulated secretory pathway by triggering the formation of secretory granule-like structures competent for hormone storage and regulated release. Finally, we found that SgII promotes prostate cancer (CaP) cell proliferation.

Patients and methods:   This was a retrospective multicentre study that included 374 patients referred for choline-PET/CT who had biochemical relapse. In all, 233 patients who met the following inclusion criteria were analysed: diagnosis of prostate cancer; early radical treatment; biochemical relapse; main clinical and pathological variables; and clinical, pathological and imaging data needed to validate the results. Criteria used to validate the PET/CT: findings from other imaging techniques, clinical follow-up, treatment response and histological analysis. Different statistical tests were used depending on the distribution of the data to correlate the results of the choline-PET/CT with qualitative [T stage, N stage, early radical prostatectomy (RP) vs other treatments, hormone therapy concomitant to choline-PET/CT] and quantitative [age, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at diagnosis, PSA nadir, PSA level on the day of the choline-PET/CT (Trigger PSA) and PSA doubling time (PSADT)] variables. We analysed whether there were independent predictive factors associated with positive PET/CT results.  Results:   Choline-PET/CT was positive in 111 of 233 patients (detection rate 47.6%) and negative in 122 (52.4%). Disease locations: prostate or prostate bed in 26 patients (23.4%); regional and/or distant lymph nodes in 52 (46.8%); and metastatic bone disease in 33 (29.7%). Positive findings were validated by: results from other imaging techniques in 35 patients (15.0%); at least 6 months of clinical follow-up in 136 (58.4%); treatment response in 24 (10.3%); histological analysis of lesions in 17 (7.3%); and follow-up plus imaging results in 21 (9.0%). The statistical analysis of qualitative variables, corresponding to patients' clinical characteristics, and the positive/negative final PET/CT results revealed that only whether or not early treatment with RP was done was statistically significant (P < 0.001), with the number of positive results higher in patients who did not undergo a RP. Among the quantitative variables, Gleason score, Trigger PSA and PSADT clearly differentiated the two patient groups (positive and negative choline-PET/CT: P = 0.010, P = 0.001 and P = 0.025, respectively). A Gleason score of <5 or ≥ 8 clearly differentiated positive from negative PET. Trigger PSA: mean of 8 ng/mL for positive PET/CT vs 2.8 ng/mL for negative PET/CT; PSADT: mean of 8 months for positive vs 12.6 months for negative. The optimal threshold values were: 3 ng/mL for Trigger PSA level and 6 months for PSADT (Youden index/receiver operating characteristic curve). Analysing these two variables together showed that PSADT was more conclusive in patients with lower Trigger PSA levels. Analysing variables by location showed that only PSADT was able to differentiate between those with disease confined to the prostate compared with the other two locations (lymph nodes and bone), with shorter PSADT in these two, which was statistically significant (P < 0.002). In the patient group with a PSA level of <1.5 ng/mL, 30.8% had the disease, 7% of whom had metastatic bone disease. In the multivariate logistic regression, the risks factors that were clearly independent for those with positive PET/CT were: PSA level of >3 ng/mL, no early RP, and Gleason score of ≥ 8.  Conclusion:   Our results support the usefulness of (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT in biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after radical treatment, with an overall disease detection rate close to 50%, and it can be recommended as first-line treatment.

Methods:   Expressions of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem cell markers were molecularly tested using prostate cancer (PCa) cells transfected with AR and AR3 (also known as AR-V7) plasmids or siRNA, and also cultured cells under androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) condition. Cell migration, clonogenicity, sphere-forming capacity was assessed using PCa cells under all experimental conditions and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM; BR-DIM) treatment. Human PCa samples from BR-DIM untreated or treated patients were also used for assessing the expression of AR3 and stem cell markers.  Results:   Overexpression of AR led to the induction of EMT phenotype, while overexpression of AR3 not only induced EMT but also led to the expression of stem cell signature genes. More importantly, ADT enhanced the expression of AR and AR3 concomitant with up-regulated expression of EMT and stem cell marker genes.

Given their limited toxicity and ability to easily integrate into the diet, compounds occurring naturally in the diet make ideal potential radio-sensitizing agents. In this study, we have examined whether capsaicin, the active compound in chilli peppers, can modulate the response to RT in preclinical models of prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   The effects of RT (1-8 Gy) and/or capsaicin (1-10 µM) on colony formation rates in human PCa cells were assessed using clonogenic assays. Mechanistic studies were performed by Western Blot, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. Athymic mice (n = 40) were inoculated with human LNCaP cells. Once tumors reached 100 mm(3) , animals were randomized into four groups: control, capsaicin alone (5 mg/kg/d), RT alone (6 Gy), and capsaicin and RT.  Results:   Capsaicin reduced colony formation rates and radio-sensitized human PCa cells (Sensitizer enhancement ratio = 1.3) which corresponded to the suppression of NFκB, independent of TRP-V1 receptor. Cell cycle modulation occurred following RT and capsaicin treatment independently. In vivo, oral administration of capsaicin with RT resulted in a 'greater than additive' growth delay and reduction in the tumor growth rate greater than capsaicin (P < 0.001) or RT (P < 0.03) alone. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a reduction in proliferation and NFκB expression, and increase in DNA damage.  Discussion:   Our findings suggest that capsaicin acts as a radio-sensitzing agent for PCa through the inhibition of NFκB signalling.""","""['Natalie A Venier', 'Alexandra J Colquhoun', 'Hiroshi Sasaki', 'Alex Kiss', 'Linda Sugar', 'Hans Adomat', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Laurence H Klotz', 'Vasundara Venkateswaran']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Torc1/Torc2 inhibitor, Palomid 529, enhances radiation response modulating CRM1-mediated survivin function and delaying DNA repair in prostate cancer models.', 'Sodium selenite radiosensitizes hormone-refractory prostate cancer xenograft tumors but not intestinal crypt cells in vivo.', 'Induction of apoptosis in prostate tumor PC-3 cells and inhibition of xenograft prostate tumor growth by the vanilloid capsaicin.', 'Final report on the safety assessment of capsicum annuum extract, capsicum annuum fruit extract, capsicum annuum resin, capsicum annuum fruit powder, capsicum frutescens fruit, capsicum frutescens fruit extract, capsicum frutescens resin, and capsaicin.', 'Combination of novel systemic agents and radiotherapy for solid tumors - Part II: An AIRO (Italian association of radiotherapy and clinical oncology) overview focused on treatment toxicity.', 'Anticancer Activity of Region B Capsaicin Analogs.', 'Capsaicin: A Two-Decade Systematic Review of Global Research Output and Recent Advances Against Human Cancer.', 'Integrated Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Analyses of Cold-Tolerant and Cold-Sensitive Pepper Species Reveal Key Genes and Essential Metabolic Pathways Involved in Response to Cold Stress.', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) Metabolites Profiling and Biological Activities of Various Capsicum annum cultivars.', 'The Natural Chemotherapeutic Capsaicin Activates AMPK through LKB1 Kinase and TRPV1 Receptors in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Prophylactic radiotherapy to bone metastases planned concomitantly with primary PCa radiotherapy could enable more precise control of combined dose in healthy tissues when compared to sequential palliative treatment.  Materials and methods:   Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) was planned for 14 PCa patients with primary bone metastases. The bone planning target volume (PTVbone) was contoured together with the PTVs of prostate (pr), pelvic lymph nodes (ln) and seminal vesicles (sv). Another virtual plan was calculated excluding PTVbone for dose volume histogram (DVH) comparison. DVHs were additionally compared to a set of actual VMAT treatment plans of a control cohort of 13 high risk PCa patients treated with PTVpr, PTVsv and PTVln. The prescribed doses varied between 42 and 76 Gy for PTVbone.  Results:   Recommended healthy tissue tolerances (Quantec) were not exceeded except for one patient's rectum V50Gy value. Rectum doses did not increase significantly due to the inclusion of PTVbone. For bladder, there was a slight increase for V65Gy and V50Gy (2.7% and 7.4%). The DVHs of metastatic and non-metastatic patients were comparable. There were no differences in the PTVpr DVH parameters, while mean PTVln dose increased by 3.7 Gy-4.4 Gy due to the increased treatment volume related to PTVbone. All side effects were <grade 3 during the mean follow-up duration of 25 months.  Conclusions:   VMAT offers a good optimization tool for adding extra PTVs to the radiotherapy plan.

However, there is little information regarding the relationship between angiogenesis and NHT. The aim of this study was to identify a suitable method to evaluate the angiogenic status of tissue, and to determine the prognostic value of this method for biochemical recurrence in patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy after NHT.  Methods:   We analyzed 108 formalin-fixed specimens from patients treated by radical prostatectomy. NHT was administered in 48 patients (52.9%) and 60 patients who had a similar Gleason score and pT stage were selected as a non-NHT treated control group. Microvessel density (MVD) was measured using anti-CD31, anti-CD34, and anti-CD105 antibodies. The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and thrombospondin (TSP)-1 were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of CD31-, CD34-, and CD105-MVD for biochemical recurrence was investigated.  Results:   The mean/SD of CD105-MVD in the NHT group (13.3/4.7) was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than that in the non-NHT group (125.8/7.3). In the NHT group, CD105-MVD was associated with pT stage and it was positively correlated with VEGF-A expression (r = 0.56, P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with TSP-1 expression (r = 0.42, P = 0.003). CD105-MVD was identified as a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in patients treated with NHT (log rank test, P < 0.001). Although CD31- and CD34-MVD were significantly associated with pT stage or Gleason score in non-NHT group, they were not associated with pathological features and BCR in NHT group.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that CD105-MVD reflects the angiogenic conditions in prostate cancer tissues treated with NHT.

HMGN5 is a novel and characteristic member of the HMGN protein family. We have previously found that HMGN5 is upregulated in prostate cancer and its downregulation had been demonstrated to induce apoptosis and G2-M cell cycle arrest.  Methods:   The radiosensitization effect of HMGN5 knockdown on PC3 and DU145 cells was assessed using clonogenic assay, flow cytometry, and comet assay. The DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair kinetics of HMGN5 knockdown and control cells after radiation exposure was evaluated using immunocytofluorescence. The mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were estimated using Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123) probes. Expression of mitochondrial antioxidant MnSOD was measured by real-time PCR and Western blot. The expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as well as cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP were also measured using Western blot.  Results:   HMGN5 knockdown cells exhibit decreased clonogenic survival and increased apoptosis rate in response to 2-8 Gy ionizing radiation (IR). Loss of HMGN5 does not affect the DSB repair kinetics after radiation exposure. HMGN5 knockdown cells demonstrated increased mitochondrial ROS level and suppressed induction of MnSOD upon radiation compared with control cells upon radiation. Further, MnSOD knockdown resulted in inhibited cell viability as well as increased mitochondrial ROS level and apoptosis upon radiation in PC3 and DU145 cells. Finally, HMGN5 knockdown cells showed significantly decreased levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as well as increased cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP compared with control cells after radiation.

We evaluate the frequency of primary and secondary CPC detection and the association with biochemical failure, relation with clinical-pathological parameters and clinical implications in men treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Serial blood samples were taken before surgery and during follow up after RP. Mononuclear cells were obtained by differential gel centrifugation, and CPCs were identified using standard immunocytochemistry using anti-PSA monoclonal antibodies. Age, pathological stage (organ confined, non organ confined), pathological grade, margin status (positive, negative), extracapsular extension, perineural, vascular, and lymphatic infiltration (positive, negative) were compared with the presence/absence of CPCs in patients with and without biochemical failure. Kaplan Meier method was used to compare the unadjusted biochemical failure free survival of patients with and without CPCs.  Results:   138 of 423 (32.6%) men undergoing prostate biopsy for an elevated serum PSA were diagnosed of prostate cancer. Of these men 15 (10.9%) were CPC negative. 95 CPC positive men underwent RP. There was no relation between primary CPC detection and clinical-pathological parameters; however, secondary CPCs were associated both with clinical-pathological parameters and biochemical failure.

Most likely it activates and complements chymotryptic KLK3 (prostate-specific antigen) in cleaving seminal clotting proteins, resulting in sperm liquefaction. KLK2 belongs to the ""classical"" KLKs 1-3, which share an extended 99- or kallikrein loop near their non-primed substrate binding site. Here, we report the 1.9 Å crystal structures of two KLK2-small molecule inhibitor complexes. In both structures discontinuous electron density for the 99-loop indicates that this loop is largely disordered. We provide evidence that the 99-loop is responsible for two biochemical peculiarities of KLK2, i.e. reversible inhibition by micromolar Zn(2+) concentrations and permanent inactivation by autocatalytic cleavage. Indeed, several 99-loop mutants of KLK2 displayed an altered susceptibility to Zn(2+), which located the Zn(2+) binding site at the 99-loop/active site interface. In addition, we identified an autolysis site between residues 95e and 95f in the 99-loop, whose elimination prevented the mature enzyme from limited autolysis and irreversible inactivation. An exhaustive comparison of KLK2 with related structures revealed that in the KLK family the 99-, 148-, and 220-loop exist in open and closed conformations, allowing or preventing substrate access, which extends the concept of conformational selection in trypsin-related proteases. Taken together, our novel biochemical and structural data on KLK2 identify its 99-loop as a key player in activity regulation.""","""['Wolfgang Skala', 'Daniel T Utzschneider', 'Viktor Magdolen', 'Mekdes Debela', 'Shihui Guo', 'Charles S Craik', 'Hans Brandstetter', 'Peter Goettig']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['A Single Glycan at the 99-Loop of Human Kallikrein-related Peptidase 2 Regulates Activation and Enzymatic Activity.', 'Crystal structures of human tissue kallikrein 4: activity modulation by a specific zinc binding site.', 'Structural basis of the zinc inhibition of human tissue kallikrein 5.', 'Development of peptides specifically modulating the activity of KLK2 and KLK3.', 'Structures and specificity of the human kallikrein-related peptidases KLK 4, 5, 6, and 7.', 'Remodelling of the tumour microenvironment by the kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'A Suite of Activity-Based Probes To Dissect the KLK Activome in Drug-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'From Plant to Patient: Thapsigargin, a Tool for Understanding Natural Product Chemistry, Total Syntheses, Biosynthesis, Taxonomy, ATPases, Cell Death, and Drug Development.', 'The Implications of Zinc Therapy in Combating the COVID-19 Global Pandemic.', 'Structural determinants of specificity and regulation of activity in the allosteric loop network of human KLK8/neuropsin.']"""

Methods:   A total of 3,752 patients with stage IV disease from the prospective nationwide cohort database of the Japan Study Group of Prostate Cancer (J-CaP) were enrolled. All patients started primary androgen deprivation therapy (PADT) between 2001 and 2003, and the present study was performed using the data set from December 2011. Patients were divided into two groups according to initial treatments: CAB with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRH) plus anti-androgen (AA) and non-CAB treatments such as LHRH monotherapy. The overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) for each group were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   A total of 2,967 patients (79.1%) received CAB. Overall, no significant difference was observed in OS and CSS between the CAB group and the non-CAB group. However, CAB resulted in significantly better OS and CSS compared to non-CAB in patients with very high Japan Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (J-CAPRA) scores of ten or greater (P = 0.007 and 0.013, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that CAB was an independent predictive factor for better OS (P = 0.013, hazard ratio = 0.83).  Conclusions:   Based on large-scale nationwide database, as PADT for prostate cancer patients with very high-risk disease, CAB resulted in better OS than other endocrine treatments.""","""['Taeko Matsuoka', 'Koji Kawai', 'Tomokazu Kimura', 'Takahiro Kojima', 'Mizuki Onozawa', 'Jun Miyazaki', 'Hiroyuki Nishiyama', 'Shiro Hinotsu', 'Hideyuki Akaza']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Clinical outcomes and nadir prostate-specific antigen (PSA) according to initial PSA levels in primary androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a Japanese perspective--the effect of primary androgen deprivation therapy on stage C prostate cancer.', 'Patterns of Bicalutamide Use in Prostate Cancer Treatment: A U.S. Real-World Analysis Using the SEER-Medicare Database.', 'The long-term results with delayed-combined androgen blockade therapy in local or locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Arguments against the long-term use of combined androgen blockade.', 'Prostate cancer in multi-ethnic Asian men: Real-world experience in the Malaysia Prostate Cancer (M-CaP) Study.', 'Clinical outcomes and nadir prostate-specific antigen (PSA) according to initial PSA levels in primary androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Sensitization of cells to anticancer agents by BID overexpression from adenovirus or pcDNA vectors is a proposed strategy for cancer therapy; however it does not provide any stringent control of cellular level of BID. The aim of this work was to examine whether a fusion of BID with TAT cell penetrating peptide (TAT-BID) may be used for controlled sensitization of cancer cells to anticancer agents acting through death receptors (TRAIL) or DNA damage (camptothecin). Prostate cancer PC3 and LNCaP, non-small human lung cancer A549, and cervix carcinoma HeLa cells were used in the study.  Methods:   Uptake of TAT-BID protein by cells was studied by quantitative Western blot analysis of cells extracts. Cells viability was monitored by MTT test. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and cytochrome c release assay.  Results:   TAT-BID was delivered to all cancer cells in amounts depending on time, dose and the cell line. Recombinant BID sensitized PC3 cells to TRAIL or, to lesser extent, to camptothecin. Out of remaining cells, TAT-BID sensitized A549, and only slightly HeLa cells to TRAIL. None of the latter cell lines were sensitized to camptothecin. In all cases the mutant not phosphorylable by CK2 (TAT-BIDT59AS76A) was similarly efficient in sensitization as the wild type TAT-BID.  Conclusions:   TAT-BID may be delivered to cancer cells in controlled manner and efficiently sensitizes PC3 and A549 cells to TRAIL. Therefore, it may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent that enhances the efficacy of TRAIL for the treatment of prostate and non-small human lung cancer.""","""['Emilia Joanna Orzechowska', 'Ewa Kozlowska', 'Alicja Czubaty', 'Piotr Kozlowski', 'Krzysztof Staron', 'Joanna Trzcinska-Danielewicz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Synergy of BID with doxorubicin in the killing of cancer cells.', 'Naringenin up-regulates the expression of death receptor 5 and enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer A549 cells.', 'Genistein sensitizes human hepatocellular carcinoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by enhancing Bid cleavage.', 'The caspase-8/Bid/cytochrome c axis links signals from death receptors to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production.', 'Quercetin enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in colon cancer cells by inducing the accumulation of death receptors in lipid rafts.', 'Model certainty in cellular network-driven processes with missing data.', 'Delivery of Various Cargos into Cancer Cells and Tissues via Cell-Penetrating Peptides: A Review of the Last Decade.', 'TAT for Enzyme/Protein Delivery to Restore or Destroy Cell Activity in Human Diseases.', 'Cell-Penetrable Peptide-Conjugated FADD Induces Apoptosis and Regulates Inflammatory Signaling in Cancer Cells.', 'Cell Penetrating Peptides as Molecular Carriers for Anti-Cancer Agents.']"""

The objective was to handle such missingness and to assess response shift and 'true change' with the use of an attrition-based multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM) approach.  Method:   Functional limitations and health impairments were measured in 1,157 cancer patients, who were treated with palliative radiotherapy for painful bone metastases, before [time (T) 0], every week after treatment (T1 through T12), and then monthly for up to 2 years (T13 through T24). To handle missing data due to attrition, the SEM procedure was extended to a multigroup approach, in which we distinguished three groups: short survival (3-5 measurements), medium survival (6-12 measurements), and long survival (>12 measurements).  Results:   Attrition after third, sixth, and 13th measurement occasions was 11, 24, and 41 %, respectively. Results show that patterns of change in functional limitations and health impairments differ between patients with short, medium, or long survival. Moreover, three response-shift effects were detected: recalibration of 'pain' and 'sickness' and reprioritization of 'physical functioning.' If response-shift effects would not have been taken into account, functional limitations and health impairments would generally be underestimated across measurements.  Conclusions:   The multigroup SEM approach enables the analysis of data from patients with different patterns of missing data due to attrition. This approach does not only allow for detection of response shift and assessment of true change across measurements, but also allow for detection of differences in response shift and true change across groups of patients with different attrition rates.""","""['Mathilde G E Verdam', 'Frans J Oort', 'Yvette M van der Linden', 'Mirjam A G Sprangers']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Response shift in the presence of missing data.', 'Method variation in the impact of missing data on response shift detection.', 'Using structural equation modeling to detect response shifts and true change in discrete variables: an application to the items of the SF-36.', 'RespOnse Shift ALgorithm in Item response theory (ROSALI) for response shift detection with missing data in longitudinal patient-reported outcome studies.', 'Strontium 89 therapy for the palliation of pain due to osseous metastases.', 'Palliative radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Postoperative quality of life and therapy-related impairments of oral cancer in relation to time-distance since treatment.', 'Investigation of measurement invariance in longitudinal health-related quality of life in preemptive or previously dialyzed kidney transplant recipients.', 'Using structural equation modeling to investigate change and response shift in patient-reported outcomes: practical considerations and recommendations.', 'The Role of Response-Shift in Studies Assessing Quality of Life Outcomes Among Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review.', 'Advancing quality-of-life research by deepening our understanding of response shift: a unifying theory of appraisal.']"""

We compare A11 minibody immunoPET to (18)F-Fluoride PET bone scans for detecting prostate cancer bone tumors and evaluate the ability of the A11 minibody to image tumor response to androgen deprivation.  Experimental design:   Osteoblastic, PSCA-expressing, LAPC-9 intratibial xenografts were imaged with serial (124)I-anti-PSCA A11 minibody immunoPET and (18)F-Fluoride bone scans. Mice bearing LAPC-9 subcutaneous xenografts were treated with either vehicle or MDV-3100 and imaged with A11 minibody immunoPET/CT scans pre- and posttreatment. Ex vivo flow cytometry measured the change in PSCA expression in response to androgen deprivation.  Results:   A11 minibody demonstrated improved sensitivity and specificity over (18)F-Fluoride bone scans for detecting LAPC-9 intratibial xenografts at all time points. LAPC-9 subcutaneous xenografts showed downregulation of PSCA when treated with MDV-3100 which A11 minibody immunoPET was able to detect in vivo.  Conclusions:   A11 minibody immunoPET has the potential to improve the sensitivity and specificity of clinical prostate cancer metastasis detection over bone scans, which are the current clinical standard-of-care. A11 minibody immunoPET additionally has the potential to image the activity of the androgen signaling axis in vivo which may help evaluate the clinical response to androgen deprivation and the development of castration resistance.""","""['Scott M Knowles', 'Richard Tavaré', 'Kirstin A Zettlitz', 'Matthew M Rochefort', 'Felix B Salazar', 'Ziyue Karen Jiang', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Anna M Wu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: immunoPET for imaging disease progression in prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative immunoPET of prostate cancer xenografts with 89Zr- and 124I-labeled anti-PSCA A11 minibody.', 'An affinity matured minibody for PET imaging of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA)-expressing tumors.', 'Dual-Modality ImmunoPET/Fluorescence Imaging of Prostate Cancer with an Anti-PSCA Cys-Minibody.', '124I-Labeled anti-prostate stem cell antigen affinity-matured A11 minibody.', '124I-Anti-PSCA 2B3 minibody.', 'ImmunoPET: Antibody-Based PET Imaging in Solid Tumors.', 'Radiopharmaceuticals for PET and SPECT Imaging: A Literature Review over the Last Decade.', 'Development and Functional Characterization of a Versatile Radio-/Immunotheranostic Tool for Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Diagnosis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma by Immuno-Positron Emission Tomography.', 'Radiochemistry, Production Processes, Labeling Methods, and ImmunoPET Imaging Pharmaceuticals of Iodine-124.']"""

Whether adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) in affected regions improves the outcome by elimination of residual tumour burden remains unclear.  Methods:   A total of 93 patients with exclusively nodal PCa relapse underwent choline-positron-emission tomography-computed-tomography-directed pelvic/retroperitoneal salvage-LND; 46 patients had surgery only and 47 patients received ART in regions with proven lymph node metastases. In case of subsequent prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression, different imaging modalities were performed to confirm next relapse within or outside the treated region (TR). Mean follow-up was 3.2 years.  Results:   Lymphatic tumour burden was balanced between the two groups. Additional ART resulted in delayed relapse within TR (5-year relapse-free rate 70.7 %) versus surgery only (5-year relapse-free rate 26.3 %, p < 0.0001). In both treatment arms, time to next relapse outside the TR was almost equal (median 27 months versus 29.6 months, p = 0.359). With respect to the detection of the first new lesion, regardless if present within or outside the TR, 5 years after the treatment 34.3 % of patients in the group with additional ART were free of relapse, versus 15.4 % in the surgery only group (p = 0.0122). ART had no influence on the extent of PSA reduction at latest follow-up compared to treatment with surgery only.

Methods:   This is a population-based study which includes all the inhabitants in the GHR in the period 1993-2006. In order to assess prostate/cervical cancer risk, Besag, York and Mollie (BYM)'s spatial-temporal version of the model was used and four random effects were introduced: (non-spatial) unstructured variability, spatial dependency, temporal dependency and spatial-temporal interaction. As an explanatory variable, a deprivation index was introduced at the census tract level. Furthermore, the percentage of the population between 45-64 years of age and over-65 was also considered as explanatory variables.  Results:   In the case of prostate cancer, all the variables which were introduced into the model showed a significant correlation with the relative risk, except for the second quintile of the deprivation index. Furthermore, as the index increased the correlation became negative and lower. Thus, the correlation between the relative risk and the two age bands proved to be lower, the higher the age was. In the case of cervical cancer, only the correlation between the over-65 age band and the relative risk was found to be statistically significant and positive.

This paper presents an evaluation of the additional dose that will be delivered to the patient as a result of backscatter radiation from the collimator. Monte Carlo simulations of planar and cylindrical collimators embedded in a tissue-equivalent phantom were performed using Geant4, with an (192)Ir source placed at two different source-collimator distances. The planar configuration was replicated experimentally to validate the simulations, with a MOSkin dosimetry probe used to measure dose at three distances from the collimator. For the cylindrical collimator simulation, backscatter dose enhancement was calculated as a function of axial and azimuthal displacement, and dose distribution maps were generated at three distances from the collimator surface. Although significant backscatter dose enhancement was observed for both geometries immediately adjacent to the collimator, simulations and experiments indicate that backscatter dose is negligible at distances beyond 1 mm from the collimator.

Growing evidence of increasing quinolone resistance is of particular concern. In the current retrospective study, we evaluated the incidence of infectious complications after prostate biopsy and identified the risk factors.  Materials and methods:   The study population included 1,195 patients who underwent a prostate biopsy between January 2007 and December 2012 at Chung-Ang University Hospital. Cases of febrile UTI that occurred within 7 days were investigated. Clinical information included age, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, and biopsy done in the quinolone-resistance era. Patients received quinolone (250 mg intravenously) before and after the procedure, and quinolone (250 mg) was orally administered twice daily for 3 days. We used univariate and multivariate analysis to investigate the predictive factors for febrile UTI.  Results:   Febrile UTI developed in 39 cases (3.1%). Core numbers increased from 2007 (8 cores) to 2012 (12 cores) and quinolone-resistant bacteria began to appear in 2010 (quinolone-resistance era). In the univariate analysis, core number≥12 (p=0.024), body mass index (BMI)>25 kg/m(2) (p=0.004), and biopsy done in the quinolone-resistance era (p=0.014) were significant factors. However, in the multivariate analysis adjusted for core number, the results were not significant, with the exception of BMI>25 kg/m(2) (p=0.011) and biopsy during the quinolone-resistance era (p=0.035), which were significantly associated with febrile UTI.  Conclusions:   Quinolone resistance is the main cause of postbiopsy infections in our center. We suggest that further evaluation is required to validate similar trends. Novel strategies to find alternative prophylactic agents are also necessary.""","""['Joong Won Choi', 'Tae Hyoung Kim', 'In Ho Chang', 'Kyung Do Kim', 'Young Tae Moon', 'Soon Chul Myung', 'Jin Wook Kim', 'Min Su Kim', 'Jong Kyou Kwon']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Korean J Urol""","""['Acute bacterial prostatitis after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: epidemiological, bacteria and treatment patterns from a 4-year prospective study.', 'Comparison of Single and Prolonged Fluoroquinolone Prophylaxis and Risk Factors for Infectious Complications After Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.', 'Increasing risk of infectious complications after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: time to reassess antimicrobial prophylaxis?', 'Comparison of fosfomycin against fluoroquinolones for transrectal prostate biopsy prophylaxis: an individual patient-data meta-analysis.', 'Fosfomycin vs. quinolone-based antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Low Infection Rate After Transrectal Implantation of Gold Anchor ™ Fiducial Markers in Prostate Cancer Patients After Non-broad-spectrum Antibiotic Prophylaxis.', 'Risk factors for infectious complications following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Obesity was an independent risk factor for febrile infection after prostate biopsy: A 10-year single center study in South China.', 'Infective complications in patients after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and the role of ciprofloxacin resistant Escherichia coli colonization in rectal flora.', 'Infection after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.']"""

Many disorders, including diabetes and Parkinson disease, are associated with autonomic dysfunction including parasympathetic denervation. Nonneuronal cholinergic signaling is also involved in immune responses to infections and in cancer pathogenesis. 5-(11)C-methoxy-donepezil, a noncompetitive acetylcholinesterase ligand, was previously validated for imaging cerebral levels of acetylcholinesterase. In the present study, we explored the utility of (11)C-donepezil for imaging acetylcholinesterase densities in peripheral organs, including the salivary glands, heart, stomach, intestine, pancreas, liver, and spleen.  Methods:   With autoradiography, we determined binding affinities and levels of nonspecific (11)C-donepezil binding to porcine tissues. Radiation dosimetry was estimated by whole-body PET of a single human volunteer. Biodistribution and kinetic analyses of (11)C-donepezil time-activity curves were assessed with dynamic PET scans of 6 healthy human volunteers. A single pig with bacterial abscesses was PET-scanned to explore (11)C-donepezil uptake in infections.  Results:   Autoradiography showed high (11)C-donepezil binding (dissociation constant, 6-39 nM) in pig peripheral organs with low nonspecific signal. Radiation dosimetry was favorable (effective dose, 5.2 μSv/MBq). Peripheral metabolization of (11)C-donepezil was low (>90% unchanged ligand at 60 min). Slow washout kinetics were seen in the salivary glands, heart, intestines, pancreas, and prostate. A linear correlation was seen between (11)C-donepezil volumes of distribution and standardized uptake values, suggesting that arterial blood sampling may not be necessary for modeling uptake kinetics in future (11)C-donepezil PET studies. High standardized uptake values and slow washout kinetics were seen in bacterial abscesses.  Conclusion:   (11)C-donepezil PET is suitable for imaging acetylcholinesterase densities in peripheral organs. Its uptake may potentially be quantitated with static whole-body PET scans not requiring arterial blood sampling. We also demonstrated high (11)C-donepezil binding in bacterial abscesses. We propose that (11)C-donepezil PET imaging may be able to quantify the parasympathetic innervation of organs but also detect nonneuronal cholinergic activity in infections.""","""['Trine Gjerløff', 'Steen Jakobsen', 'Adjmal Nahimi', 'Ole L Munk', 'Dirk Bender', 'Aage K O Alstrup', 'Karina H Vase', 'Søren B Hansen', 'David J Brooks', 'Per Borghammer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""[""Imaging acetylcholinesterase density in peripheral organs in Parkinson's disease with 11C-donepezil PET."", 'Cholinergic PET imaging in infections and inflammation using 11C-donepezil and 18F-FEOBV.', 'Whole-body distribution and brain tumor imaging with (11)C-4DST: a pilot study.', 'Radiation Imagers for Quantitative, Single-particle Digital Autoradiography of Alpha- and Beta-particle Emitters.', 'Radionuclide targeting and dosimetry at the microscopic level: the role of microautoradiography.', 'In vivo vesicular acetylcholine transporter density in human peripheral organs: an 18FFEOBV PET/CT study.', ""Cholinergic system changes in Parkinson's disease: emerging therapeutic approaches."", 'Nerve density in cancer: Less is better.', 'Radionuclide Imaging of the Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson Disease.', 'Radiotracers for Bone Marrow Infection Imaging.']"""

Effects on SRD5A gene expression were determined in both cell lines. Benomyl, vinclozolin, and prochloraz, but not atrazine, concentration dependently (1-30 μM) decreased dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-stimulated proliferation of LNCaP cells.

DLK1-DIO3 cluster miRNAs are elevated in the serum of patients with metastatic cancer. However, the biologic functions of these miRNAs in the EMT and metastasis of cancer cells are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated the oncogenic and metastatic role of miR-409-3p/5p, a member of this cluster, in prostate cancer. In this study, we defined the role of miR-154* and miR-379, two key members of this cluster, in prostate cancer progression and bone metastasis in both cell line models and clinical specimens.  Experimental design:   Genetic manipulation of miR-154* and miR-379 was performed to determine their role in tumor growth, EMT, and bone metastasis in mouse models. We determined the expression of miR-154* in prostate cancer clinical samples and bone metastasis samples using in situ hybridization and quantum dot labeling.  Results:   Elevated expression of miR-154* and miR-379 was observed in bone metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and tissues, and miR-379 expression correlated with progression-free survival of patients with prostate cancer. Intracardiac inoculation (to mimic systemic dissemination) of miR-154* inhibitor-treated bone metastatic ARCaPM prostate cancer cells in mice led to decreased bone metastasis and increased survival.  Conclusion:   miR-154* and miR-379 play important roles in prostate cancer biology by facilitating tumor growth, EMT, and bone metastasis.

In our system, electrical body forces generated by ac-EHD act within nanometers of an electrode surface (i.e., within the electrical layer) to generate nanoscaled fluid flow that enhances the specificity of capture and also reduce nonspecific adsorption of weakly bound molecules from the electrode surface. This approach demonstrates the analysis of exosomes derived from cells expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and prostate specific antigen (PSA), and is also capable of specifically isolating exosomes from breast cancer patient samples. The device also exhibited a 3-fold enhancement in detection sensitivity in comparison to hydrodynamic flow based assays (LOD 2760 exosomes/μL for ac-EHD vs LOD 8300 exosomes/μL for hydrodynamic flow; (n = 3)).

Methods:   uPA and PAI-1 were extracted from liquid N2 frozen homogenised prostate tissue with TRIS/Triton pH 8.5 buffer and measured by ELISA (FEMTELLE).  Results:   The concentration of uPA (mean ± SD) was found to be 0.1177 ± 0.0266 (range 0.0070-0.7200; n = 30) and 0.1092 ± 0.0130 (range 0.0040-0.7800; n = 70) for PCa and BPH patients, respectively.

We compared the outcomes of ultra-early versus early salvage ADT.  Methods:   Among 855 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at our institution between 2000 and 2012, we identified 121 with adjuvant-treatment-naïve pT2-4N0M0 prostate cancer who received salvage ADT for biochemical recurrence. These patients were divided into an ultra-early salvage ADT group (n = 51), who started salvage ADT before meeting the standardized definition of biochemical recurrence in Japan (two consecutive prostate-specific antigen [PSA] values ≥0.2 ng/ml), and an early salvage ADT group (n = 70) who started salvage ADT when they met the definition. The ultra-early ADT group consisted of those who started salvage ADT with a single PSA value ≥0.2 ng/ml (n = 30) or with two consecutive PSA values >0.1 ng/ml and rising (n = 21). The primary endpoint was biochemical recurrence after salvage ADT, defined as a single PSA value ≥0.2 ng/ml after PSA nadir following salvage ADT. Secondary endpoints were clinical metastasis and cancer-specific survival. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis. The median follow-up was 65.5 months.  Results:   Biochemical recurrence occurred in one patient (2.0%) in the ultra-early group and in 12 (17.1%) in the early salvage ADT group. Multivariate analysis identified ultra-early salvage ADT and preoperative Gleason score ≤7 as independent negative predictors of biochemical recurrence after salvage ADT. Only one patient in the early salvage ADT group developed clinical metastasis to a left supraclavicular lymph node, and no patient died from prostate cancer during follow-up. The major limitations of this study were its retrospective design, selection bias, and the possibility that the ultra-early salvage ADT group may have included patients without biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   Ultra-early salvage ADT was an independent negative predictor of biochemical recurrence after salvage ADT in post-prostatectomy patients.

However, handling of fresh radical prostatectomy specimens has been notoriously challenging given the distinctive physical properties of prostate tissue and the difficulty to identify cancer foci on gross examination. Here, we have developed a novel approach using ceramic foam plates for processing freshly cut whole mount sections from radical prostatectomy specimens without compromising further diagnostic assessment. Forty-nine radical prostatectomy specimens were processed and sectioned from the apex to the base in whole mount slices. Putative carcinoma foci were morphologically verified by frozen section analysis. The fresh whole mount slices were then laid between two ceramic foam plates and fixed overnight. To test tissue preservation after this procedure, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded whole mount sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence, and silver in situ hybridization (FISH and SISH, respectively).

Results:   We propose a method called Differential Regulation-based enrichment Analysis for GENe sets (DRAGEN) to identify gene sets in which a significant proportion of genes have their transcriptional regulatory patterns changed in a perturbed phenotype. We conduct comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the capability of our method in identifying differentially regulated gene sets. We further apply our method to three human microarray expression datasets, two with hormone treated and control samples and one concerning different cell cycle phases. Results indicate that the capability of DRAGEN in identifying phenotype-associated gene sets is significantly superior to those of four existing methods for analyzing differentially expressed gene sets. We conclude that the proposed differential regulation enrichment analysis method, though exploratory in nature, complements the existing gene set analysis methods and provides a promising new direction for the interpretation of gene expression data.

Akt and Myc are arguably the most prevalent driving oncogenes in prostate cancer. Mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling was performed on immortalized human prostate epithelial cells transformed by AKT1 or MYC, transgenic mice driven by the same oncogenes under the control of a prostate-specific promoter, and human prostate specimens characterized for the expression and activation of these oncoproteins. Integrative analysis of these metabolomic datasets revealed that AKT1 activation was associated with accumulation of aerobic glycolysis metabolites, whereas MYC overexpression was associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism. Selected metabolites that differentially accumulated in the MYC-high versus AKT1-high tumors, or in normal versus tumor prostate tissue by untargeted metabolomics, were validated using absolute quantitation assays.

Nevertheless, the risk of developing resistance warrants the development of sensitizers that can overcome resistance to TRAIL. In this study, isoegomaketone (1) acted as a synergistic TRAIL sensitizer by mediating up-regulation of DR5 expression in primary prostate cancer RC-58T/h/SA#4 cells. Combined with 1, TRAIL exhibited enhanced apoptotic activity in a human prostate cancer cell line designated RC-58T/h/SA#4, as indicated by increases in annexin V-positive and sub-G1 cell populations as well as condensation of chromatin or apoptotic bodies. Combined treatment also activated caspases-8, -9, and -3; increased the protein levels of Bax, AIF, and cytosolic cytochrome c; and induced PARP cleavage while reducing Bcl-2 protein expression. Human recombinant DR5 Fc chimera efficiently attenuated 1-induced apoptosis, thereby demonstrating the critical role of DR5 in 1-mediated apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, DR5 expression induced by 1 was mediated via a ROS-independent pathway that required CHOP and p53. Overall, these findings provide evidence that 1 potentiates TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through up-regulation of DR5 via a ROS-independent pathway.

Existing correlation-based methods do not guarantee positive correlations of the selected features and often need a pre-feature selection step to reduce redundant features on each feature view. The new GNCCA approach attempts to overcome these issues by incorporating (1) a nonnegativity constraint that guarantees positive correlations in the reduced representation and (2) a group-sparsity constraint that allows for simultaneous between- and within- view feature selection. In particular, GNCCA is designed to emphasize correlations between feature views and class labels such that the selected features guarantee better class separability. In this work, GNCCA was evaluated on three prostate cancer (CaP) prognosis tasks: (i) identifying 40 CaP patients with and without 5-year biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy by fusing quantitative features extracted from digitized pathology and proteomics, (ii) predicting in vivo prostate cancer grade for 16 CaP patients by fusing T2w and DCE MRI, and (iii) localizing CaP/benign regions on MR spectroscopy and MRI for 36 patients. For the three tasks, GNCCA identifies a feature subset comprising 2%, 1% and 22%, respectively, of the original extracted features. These selected features achieve improved or comparable results compared to using all features with the same Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In addition, GNCCA consistently outperforms 5 state-of-the-art feature selection methods across all three datasets.""","""['Haibo Wang', 'Asha Singanamalli', 'Shoshana Ginsburg', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv""","""['Multilevel analysis of spatiotemporal association features for differentiation of tumor enhancement patterns in breast DCE-MRI.', 'Central gland and peripheral zone prostate tumors have significantly different quantitative imaging signatures on 3 Tesla endorectal, in vivo T2-weighted MR imagery.', 'Automated detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution ex vivo MRI.', 'Novel PCA-VIP scheme for ranking MRI protocols and identifying computer-extracted MRI measurements associated with central gland and peripheral zone prostate tumors.', 'A feature set for cytometry on digitized microscopic images.', 'Dimensionality reduction-based fusion approaches for imaging and non-imaging biomedical data: concepts, workflow, and use-cases.']"""

This study estimates the chance that an untreated PSA-R would not progress to clinical metastasis within the patient's lifetime, that is, that recurrence is overdetected.  Experimental design:   Times from PSA-R to metastasis were estimated from patients with RP treated at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD) who did not receive salvage treatment (n = 441) at PSA-R. Times to other-cause death were based on U.S. life tables adjusted to reflect other-cause survival among RP cases in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. We used competing risks simulation to estimate lower bounds on the chance that other-cause death would precede clinical metastasis for patients with disease characteristics at diagnosis based on the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database (n = 4,455).  Results:   Cumulative incidence of PSA-R in CaPSURE was 13.6% at 5 years and 19.9% at 10 years. The risk of other-cause death among patients with RP in SEER was 60% lower than the age-matched U.S. population. At least 9.1% of patients with PSA-R <5 years after RP and at least 15.6% of patients with PSA-R 5 to 10 years after RP were overdetected. At least 31.4% of patients over the age of 70 years at diagnosis, who recurred <10 years of diagnosis, were overdetected.  Conclusions:   This analysis indicates that PSA-R after RP may be overdetected, with risk depending on patient age and tumor characteristics. The potential for overdetection of recurrence confirms the need for approaches to determine whether and when to initiate salvage therapies.""","""['Jing Xia', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Roman Gulati', 'Leslie Mallinger', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Peter R Carroll', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Ruth Etzioni']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Postoperative radiation therapy for patients at high-risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: does timing matter?', 'Persistent Prostate-Specific Antigen After Radical Prostatectomy and Its Impact on Oncologic Outcomes.', 'Predicting risk of prostate specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy with the Center for Prostate Disease Research and Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor databases.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is an Independent Predictor of Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prostate specific antigen only progression of prostate cancer.', 'Low Blood Levels of LRG1 Before Radical Prostatectomy Identify Patients with High Risk of Progression to Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer mortality and metastasis under different biopsy frequencies in North American active surveillance cohorts.', 'Prognostic Significance of Serum PSA Level and Telomerase, VEGF and GLUT-1 Protein Expression for the Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'A Framework for Treatment Decision Making at Prostate Cancer Recurrence.', 'Validation of a Genomic Risk Classifier to Predict Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality in Men with Adverse Pathologic Features.']"""

However, abiraterone increases progesterone, which can activate certain mutant androgen receptors (AR) identified previously in flutamide-resistant tumors. Therefore, we sought to determine if CYP17A1 inhibitor treatment selects for progesterone-activated mutant ARs.  Experimental design:   AR was examined by targeted sequencing in metastatic tumor biopsies from 18 patients with CRPC who were progressing on a CYP17A1 inhibitor (17 on abiraterone, 1 on ketoconazole), alone or in combination with dutasteride, and by whole-exome sequencing in residual tumor in one patient treated with neoadjuvant leuprolide plus abiraterone.  Results:   The progesterone-activated T878A-mutant AR was present at high allele frequency in 3 of the 18 CRPC cases. It was also present in one focus of resistant tumor in the neoadjuvant-treated patient, but not in a second clonally related resistant focus that instead had lost one copy of PTEN and both copies of CHD1. The T878A mutation appeared to be less common in the subset of patients with CRPC treated with abiraterone plus dutasteride, and transfection studies showed that dutasteride was a more potent direct antagonist of the T878A versus the wild-type AR.

It is unclear, however, to what extent copper is required for prostate cancer cell function as we observed only modest effects of chelation strategies on the growth of these cells in vitro. With the goal of exploiting prostate cancer cell proclivity for copper uptake, we developed a ""conditional lethal"" screen to identify compounds whose cytotoxic actions were manifested in a copper-dependent manner. Emerging from this screen was a series of dithiocarbamates, which, when complexed with copper, induced reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis of malignant, but not normal, prostate cells. One of the dithiocarbamates identified, disulfiram (DSF), is an FDA-approved drug that has previously yielded disappointing results in clinical trials in patients with recurrent prostate cancer. Similarly, in our studies, DSF alone had a minimal effect on the growth of prostate cancer tumors when propagated as xenografts. However, when DSF was coadministered with copper, a very dramatic inhibition of tumor growth in models of hormone-sensitive and of castrate-resistant disease was observed. Furthermore, we determined that prostate cancer cells express high levels of CTR1, the primary copper transporter, and additional chaperones that are required to maintain intracellular copper homeostasis. The expression levels of most of these proteins are increased further upon treatment of androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cell lines with androgens. Not surprisingly, robust CTR1-dependent uptake of copper into prostate cancer cells was observed, an activity that was accentuated by activation of AR. Given these data linking AR to intracellular copper uptake, we believe that dithiocarbamate/copper complexes are likely to be effective for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer whose disease is resistant to classical androgen ablation therapies.""","""['Rachid Safi', 'Erik R Nelson', 'Satish K Chitneni', 'Katherine J Franz', 'Daniel J George', 'Michael R Zalutsky', 'Donald P McDonnell']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: copper unlocks therapeutic potential of disulfiram.', 'Choline Kinase Alpha as an Androgen Receptor Chaperone and Prostate Cancer Therapeutic Target.', ""Clioquinol, a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease, has proteasome-inhibitory, androgen receptor-suppressing, apoptosis-inducing, and antitumor activities in human prostate cancer cells and xenografts."", 'The disulfiram/copper complex induces apoptosis and inhibits tumour growth in human osteosarcoma by activating the ROS/JNK signalling pathway.', 'BAG1L: a promising therapeutic target for androgen receptor-dependent prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'The immunomodulatory function and antitumor effect of disulfiram: paving the way for novel cancer therapeutics.', 'Plant-derived chelators and ionophores as potential therapeutics for metabolic diseases.', 'Copper overload impairs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation via prompting HSF1/SP1 aggregation and the subsequently downregulating FOXM1-Cytoskeleton axis.', 'Identification of copper metabolism-related subtypes and establishment of the prognostic model in ovarian cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis of cuproptosis-related prognostic gene signature and tumor immune microenvironment in HCC.']"""

Here we used affinity chromatography of tumor cell extracts to identify LGALS3BP as a novel sialic acid-dependent ligand for human Siglec-9 and for other immunomodulatory Siglecs, such as Siglec-5 and Siglec-10. In contrast, the mouse homolog Siglec-E binds to murine LGALS3BP with lower affinity. LGALS3BP has been observed to be up-regulated in human colorectal and prostate cancer specimens, particularly in the extracellular matrix.

Targeting prostate cancer cells that disseminated to the bone marrow before surgery and before metastatic outgrowth may therefore prevent lethal metastasis. This prompted us to directly analyze the transcriptome of disseminated cancer cells (DCC) isolated from patients with nonmetastatic (UICC stage M0) prostate cancer. We screened 105 bone marrow samples of patients with M0-stage prostate cancer and 18 bone marrow samples of patients without malignancy for the presence of EpCAM(+) single cells. In total, we isolated 270 cells from both groups by micromanipulation and globally amplified their mRNA. We used targeted transcriptional profiling to unambiguously identify DCCs for subsequent in-depth analysis. Transcriptomes of all cells were examined for the expression of EPCAM, KRT8, KRT18, KRT19, KRT14, KRT6a, KRT5, KLK3 (PSA), MAGEA2, MAGEA4, PTPRC (CD45), CD33, CD34, CD19, GYPC, SCL4A1 (band 3), and HBA2. Using these transcripts, we found it impossible to reliably identify true DCCs. We then applied combined genome and transcriptome analysis of single cells and found that EpCAM(+) cells from controls expressed transcripts thought to be epithelial-specific, whereas true DCCs may express hematopoietic transcripts. These results point to an unexpected transcriptome plasticity of epithelial cancer cells in bone marrow and question common transcriptional criteria to identify DCCs.""","""['Miodrag Gužvić', 'Bernhard Braun', 'Roman Ganzer', 'Maximilian Burger', 'Michael Nerlich', 'Sebastian Winkler', 'Melanie Werner-Klein', 'Zbigniew T Czyż', 'Bernhard Polzer', 'Christoph A Klein']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Isolation and molecular profiling of bone marrow micrometastases identifies TWIST1 as a marker of early tumor relapse in breast cancer patients.', 'Prostate Cancer Disseminated Tumor Cells are Rarely Detected in the Bone Marrow of Patients with Localized Disease Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy across Multiple Rare Cell Detection Platforms.', 'Increased expression of putative cancer stem cell markers in the bone marrow of prostate cancer patients is associated with bone metastasis progression.', 'Prostate cancer with disseminated carcinomatosis of bone marrow initially presenting with disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome: a case report.', 'Role of the EpCAM (CD326) in prostate cancer metastasis and progression.', 'Liquid biopsy for monitoring of tumor dormancy and early detection of disease recurrence in solid tumors.', 'Translational Strategies to Target Metastatic Bone Disease.', 'Prostate cancer dormancy and recurrence.', 'Transcriptome profiles of stem-like cells from primary breast cancers allow identification of ITGA7 as a predictive marker of chemotherapy response.', 'Prognostic significance of KRT19 in Lung Squamous Cancer.']"""

Little data are available on risk factors influencing the time of treatment until an osteonecrosis occurs.  Methods:   From 1 Dec 2004 until 21 Sep 2012, the German Register collected all patients with validated diagnoses of ONJ (N = 1,229) that were reported to the national pharmaco-vigilance system or to the Register directly. We analysed 963 patients with cancerous disease and an ONJ during i.v. BP treatment. Duration of BP treatment until first diagnosis of ONJ and Kaplan-Meier curves of ONJ-free survival were analysed stratified by gender, type of BP and type of cancer.  Results:   Main indications for BP treatment were breast cancer (36%), multiple myeloma (24%), prostate cancer (16%) and kidney cancer (4%). Men suffered from their ONJ earlier than women. A total of 780 patients (81%) had their ONJ during zoledronate treatment, 93 (10%) under pamidronate and 90 (9%) under ibandronate treatment. ONJ-free survival in single BP users was significantly longer in pamidronate-treated patients than in zoledronate or ibandronate users. Ibandronate users had the shortest median duration of treatment (17 months), similar to that of zoledronate users (21.5 months). Sequential prescription of two different BPs prolonged the period of overall BP treatment until an ONJ occurred. Time of BP treatment was shortest in patients with kidney cancer. Age or a concomitant osteoporosis did not influence the time to event of an ONJ.  Conclusion:   Systemic risk factors such as gender play a significant role in certain subgroups only. Comparative analysis of different cancer patients helps the treating oncologist/dentist to identify patients with a more imminent risk to develop an ONJ (i.e. kidney cancer, ibandronate/zoledronate use).""","""['Tatjana I Gabbert', 'Bodo Hoffmeister', 'Dieter Felsenberg']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Longitudinal cohort study of risk factors in cancer patients of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.', 'Bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaws: prospective study of 80 patients with multiple myeloma and other malignancies.', 'Osteonecrosis of the jaw in cancer after treatment with bisphosphonates: incidence and risk factors.', 'A review of the literature on osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with osteoporosis treated with oral bisphosphonates: prevalence, risk factors, and clinical characteristics.', 'Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw.', 'Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Dental Practice: A Retrospective Analysis of Data from the Milan Cohort.', 'The association between the severity of periodontitis and osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with different cancer locations: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Targeted histological evaluation shows high incidence of actinomyces infection in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws.', 'Prognosis by cancer type and incidence of zoledronic acid-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: a single-center retrospective study.', 'Intraoral localized methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorders concurrent with antiresorptive agent-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: A case report and literature review.']"""

N-linked glycosylation supports protein folding and correct sorting of proteins to plasma membrane and secretion. This process generates complex glycoforms, which can be recognized by other proteins and glycosylation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) can also regulate their plasma-membrane retention time. Of special interest for experimental biologists, plants produce proteins, termed lectins, which bind with high specificity to glyco-conjugates. For the purposes of molecular biology, plant lectins can be conjugated to different moieties, such as agarose beads, which enable precipitation of specifically glycosylated proteins.

Few studies have examined the prevalence of comorbidities before and after a cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   Cancer cases were sampled from two California cancer registries to examine medical conditions (ever experienced and developed after cancer) among 1,527 long-term breast, prostate, colorectal, and gynecological cancer survivors by socio-demographic, cancer-related, and health behavior variables.  Results:   On average, survivors reported five medical conditions ever diagnosed (95 % CI, 4.8, 5.1) and 1.9 conditions (95 % CI, 1.8, 2.0) diagnosed after cancer. Breast cancer survivors reported the highest (5.8 ever, 2.9 post-cancer) and prostate survivors the lowest (4.0 ever, 1.0 post-cancer) comorbidity burden. Higher comorbidity burden was associated with older age, being a breast cancer survivor, divorced, widowed or separated, non-Hispanic White, overweight or obese, and not receiving chemotherapy. Breast and endometrial cancer survivors, as well as those more than 10 years post-diagnosis, obese, or physically inactive were more likely to report that these comorbidities occurred after cancer. Cancer treatment type, smoking, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, and education were not significant predictors of comorbidities acquired post-cancer.  Conclusions:   Cancer survivors report a large number of medical conditions, many identified after a cancer diagnosis. Findings suggest that time since cancer diagnosis, body mass index, and activity level are important contextual variables when managing survivor's post-treatment follow-up care.

Associations were investigated using chi-square tests.  Results:   After excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, 17-year cancer prevalence in Ireland was 112,610 (females: 58,054 (52%) males: 54,556 (48%)). The four most prevalent cancers among females were breast (26,066), colorectum (6,598), melanoma (4,593) and uterus (3,505) and among males were prostate (23,966), colorectum (8,207), lymphoma (3,236) and melanoma (2,774). At the end of 2011, 39% of female survivors were aged <60 and 35% were ≥70 compared to 25% and 46% of males (p < 0.001). More than half of survivors of bladder, colorectal and prostate cancer were ≥70. Cancers with the highest percentages of younger (<40) survivors were: testis (50%); leukaemia (females: 28%; males: 22%); cervix (20%); and lymphoma (females: 19%; males: 20%). Fewer female (57%) than male (64%) survivors were married but the percentage single was similar (17-18%). More female (25%) than male survivors (18%; p < 0.001) were ≥10 years from diagnosis. Overall, 69% of survivors had undergone cancer-directed surgery, and 39%, 32% and 18% had received radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy, respectively. These frequencies were higher among females than males (surgery: 82%, 54%; radiotherapy: 42%, 35%; chemotherapy: 40%, 22%; hormone therapy: 23%, 13%).  Conclusions:   These results reveal the socio-demographic and clinical heterogeneity of the survivor population, and highlight groups which may have specific medical and supportive care needs. These types of population-based estimates may help decision-makers, planners and service providers to develop follow-up and after-care services to effectively meet survivors' needs.""","""['Linda Sharp', 'Sandra Deady', 'Pamela Gallagher', 'Michal Molcho', 'Alison Pearce', 'Audrey Alforque Thomas', 'Aileen Timmons', 'Harry Comber']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2014: Prevalence and cure of cancer in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2010: Cancer prevalence in Italy.

This is motivated by pre-clinical experiments with cells or animals that identify such events, represented by binary or quantitative biomarkers. When evaluating targeted agents in humans, central questions are whether the distribution of a targeted biomarker changes following treatment, the nature and magnitude of this change, and whether it is associated with clinical outcome. Major difficulties in estimating these effects are that a biomarker's distribution may be complex, vary substantially between patients, and have complicated relationships with clinical outcomes. We present a probabilistically coherent framework for modeling and estimation in this setting, including a hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric mixture model for biomarkers that we use to define a functional profile of pre-versus-post-treatment biomarker distribution change. The functional is similar to the receiver operating characteristic used in diagnostic testing. The hierarchical model yields clusters of individual patient biomarker profile functionals, and we use the profile as a covariate in a regression model for clinical outcome. The methodology is illustrated by analysis of a dataset from a clinical trial in prostate cancer using imatinib to target platelet-derived growth factor, with the clinical aim to improve progression-free survival time.""","""['Rebecca Graziani', 'Michele Guindani', 'Peter F Thall']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biometrics""","""['Bayesian nonparametric statistics: A new toolkit for discovery in cancer research.', 'A Bayesian adaptive marker-stratified design for molecularly targeted agents with customized hierarchical modeling.', 'Bayesian semiparametric estimation of covariate-dependent ROC curves.', 'Receptor tyrosine kinases as rational targets for prostate cancer treatment: platelet-derived growth factor receptor and imatinib mesylate.', 'Imatinib and prostate cancer: lessons learned from targeting the platelet-derived growth factor receptor.', 'A Common Atoms Model for the Bayesian Nonparametric Analysis of Nested Data.', 'A Causal Framework for Making Individualized Treatment Decisions in Oncology.', 'Bayesian nonparametric statistics: A new toolkit for discovery in cancer research.']"""

However, little is known concerning the expression and function of these regulators in prostate tumor samples and PCa cells and their correlation with invasion and bone metastasis. In the present study, we determined the expression of RANK, RANKL and OPG in 3 human PCa cell lines and 40 PCa patient samples by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As controls, samples from 20 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and normal prostate epithelial RWPE2 cells were also included in the analyses. The effects of soluble RANKL (sRANKL) and OPG as well as RANK knockdown on PCa invasion were examined in Transwell assays. Immunohistochemical staining detected little RANK, OPG and RANKL expression in hyperplasia prostate while the percentages of positivity were increased to 50, 45 and 52.5%, respectively, in prostate tumor tissues. OPG and sRANKL levels in the prostate tumor samples as measured by ELISA were ~10-fold that in the BPHs (P<0.01) and the levels were higher in aggressive tumors than non-aggressive ones (P<0.05). The sRANKL level in the serum of PCa patients was the same as that in the patients with BPH, yet the serum OPG levels correlated with the tissue levels (R2=0.620, P<0.01, which both showed a 10-fold increase in PCa over BPH (P<0.01) with higher levels in aggressive PCa than non-aggressive ones (P<0.05). Consistent with the tissue analyses, expression levels of RANK mRNA and protein were detected in multiple human PCa cell lines by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The treatment of PCa cells with RANKL significantly increased the number of invaded cells (P<0.01), which was suppressed by the decoy receptor OPG. RANK siRNA transfection dramatically dampened the stimulatory effect of RANKL on PCa cell invasion. Our findings indicate that the expression of RANK, RANKL and OPG may be used as diagnostic markers to identify patients at high risk for aggressive PCa and that the effective suppression of PCa cell migration by OPG via the blockage of RANKL activity represents a potential therapeutic strategy for interfering with prostate tumor metastasis and progression to bone.""","""['Xiaoming Li', 'Yaoming Liu', 'Bin Wu', 'Zhilong Dong', 'Yichen Wang', 'Jianzhong Lu', 'Ping Shi', 'Wenlong Bai', 'Zhiping Wang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Serum receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) levels predict biochemical recurrence in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Alterations of the RANKL pathway in blood and bone marrow samples of prostate cancer patients without bone metastases.', 'Abnormal bone remodeling process is due to an imbalance in the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) axis in patients with solid tumors metastatic to the skeleton.', 'CLINICAL Review #: the role of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK)/RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin: clinical implications.', 'The role of RANK/RANKL/osteoprotegerin (OPG) triad in cancer-induced bone diseases: physiopathology and clinical implications.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer - microenvironmental roles of adipose tissue.', 'Transcriptome of Lung Cancer Cells Resistant to the Cytotoxic Activity of Macrophages.', 'OncoTherad® is an immunomodulator of biological response that downregulate RANK/RANKL signaling pathway and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.', 'RANKL regulates testicular cancer growth and Denosumab treatment has suppressive effects on GCNIS and advanced seminoma.', 'The Signaling Pathways Associated With Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis.']"""

In the in vitro angiogenesis assay, fasudil exerted a more significant effect. Tube formation was significantly inhibited at fasudil concentrations exceeding 3 µM, and spheroid sprouts were significantly thinner and shorter (at fasudil concentrations of 10 and 30 µM, respectively). Western blotting results showed that expression of phosphorylated myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT-1) was significantly lower after fasudil treatment, confirming that fasudil inhibited ROCK activity in these model systems.

The outcomes of interest were need and timing of perioperative blood transfusion (PBT), which was categorized into early (postoperative day [POD] ≤1) or late (POD ≥2). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with the need and timing for PBT.  Results:   A total of 16,144 men who underwent RP were identified from 2007 to 2012. The overall PBT rate was 3.1%. Highest rate of transfusions occurred on day of surgery for patients undergoing ORP, and first POD for patients undergoing RARP. On multivariate analysis significant predictors of blood transfusion included history of bleeding disorder (OR: 2.8, p=0.002), preoperative dyspnea (odds ratio [OR]: 1.7, p=0.03), starting hematocrit <42% (OR: 1.9, p<0.001), open approach (OR: 0.09, p<0.001), year of surgery (OR: 0.5, p<0.001), resident involvement (OR: 1.6, p=0.003), and operative time (OR: 4.4, p<0.001). The only predictor of receiving a blood transfusion on POD 2 or later was having the procedure performed through a robot-assisted approach (OR: 3.7, p<0.001).  Conclusions:   In this study we found that the rate of perioperative transfusions is lower than previously published. A clear separation in timing of transfusion exists based on the utilized surgical approach. It is prudent that surgeons performing RARP be aware of the low, but present risk of a delayed blood transfusion.""","""['Ruslan Korets', 'Aaron C Weinberg', 'Blake D Alberts', 'Solomon L Woldu', 'Mark J Mann', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy: results from the nationwide inpatient sample.', 'Robot-assisted Versus Open Radical Prostatectomy: A Contemporary Analysis of an All-payer Discharge Database.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of routine type and screens in select urological surgeries.', 'Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'Perioperative Blood Transfusion as a Significant Predictor of Biochemical Recurrence and Survival after Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, emergence of DTX resistance has been a therapeutic hurdle. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining DTX with Bcl-2 family inhibitors using human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, LNCaP, and DU145 cells). PC3 cells were less sensitive to DTX than were the other two cell lines. In contrast to ABT-199, which inhibits Bcl-2 and Bcl-w, both ABT-263 and ABT-737, which inhibit Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, significantly augmented the antitumor effect of DTX on PC3 cells. ABT-263 also enhanced the antitumor effect of DTX on a DTX-resistant PC3 variant cell line. The antitumor effect of ABT-263 was due mainly to its inhibitory effect on Bcl-xL. In a xenograft mouse model, DTX and ABT-737 combination therapy significantly inhibited PC3 tumor growth. Interestingly, although ABT-263 activated caspase-9 in PC3 cells, inhibition of caspase-9 unexpectedly promoted ABT-263-induced apoptosis in a caspase-8-dependent manner. This augmented apoptosis was also observed in LNCaP cells.

We previously reported that TGF-β signaling in prostate stroma promotes prostate tumor angiogenesis and growth. By using a PCa/stroma co-culture model, here we show that stromal TGF-β signaling induces comprehensive morphology changes of PCa LNCaP cells. Furthermore, it induces AR activation in LNCaP cells in the absence of significant levels of androgen, as evidenced by induction of several AR target genes including PSA, TMPRSS2, and KLK4. SD-208, a TGF-β receptor 1 specific inhibitor, blocks this TGF-β induced biology. Importantly, stromal TGF-β signaling together with DHT induce robust activation of AR. MDV3100 effectively blocks DHT-induced, but not stromal TGF-β signaling induced AR activation in LNCaP cells, indicating that stromal TGF-β signaling induces both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent AR activation in PCa. TGF-β induces the expression of several growth factors and cytokines in prostate stromal cells, including IL-6, and BMP-6. Interestingly, BMP-6 and IL-6 together induces robust AR activation in these co-cultures, and neutralizing antibodies against BMP-6 and IL-6 attenuate this action.

We found that inhibition of miR-96 abolished hypoxia-induced autophagy. Paradoxically, ectopic over-expression of miR-96 to a certain threshold, also abolished the hypoxia-induced autophagy. Further studies have shown that high levels of miR-96 inhibited autophagy through suppressing ATG7, a key autophagy-associated gene. Importantly, the miR-96 expression level threshold was determined, and the effects of miR-96 on autophagy on either side of the threshold were opposite. These data demonstrate hypoxia-induced autophagy is at least partially regulated by miR-96; miR-96 can promote or inhibit autophagy by principally inhibiting MTOR or ATG7 depending on the expression levels of miR-96.

However, information on this association remains limited. We assessed the association between daily aspirin use and PCSM in a large prospective cohort.  Patients and methods:   This analysis included men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between enrollment in the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort in 1992 or 1993 and June 2009. Aspirin use was reported at enrollment, in 1997, and every 2 years thereafter. During follow-up through 2010, there were 441 prostate cancer deaths among 8,427 prostate cancer cases with information on prediagnosis aspirin use and 301 prostate cancer deaths among 7,118 prostate cancer cases with information on postdiagnosis aspirin use.  Results:   Compared with no aspirin use, neither prediagnosis nor postdiagnosis daily aspirin use were statistically significantly associated with PCSM (prediagnosis use, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.17, postdiagnosis use, HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.29).

Mechanisms that allow this dynamic switching between overlapping and distinct functions are unclear. Here we demonstrate that JUND has a role in prostate cell migration that is the opposite of c-JUN's and JUNB's. RNA sequencing reveals that opposing regulation by c-JUN and JUND defines a subset of AP-1 target genes with cell migration roles. cis-regulatory elements for only this subset of targets were enriched for ETS factor binding, indicating a specificity mechanism. Interestingly, the function of c-JUN and JUND in prostate cell migration switched when we compared cells with an inactive versus an active RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. We show that this switch is due to phosphorylation and activation of JUND by ERK.

Recently, we have described co-operative interactions between two clonal subpopulations derived from the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, in which the invasiveness of a cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched subpopulation (PC-3M, or M) is enhanced by a non-CSC subpopulation (PC-3S, or S), resulting in their accelerated metastatic dissemination.  Methods:   M and S secretomes were compared by SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Aminoacids in Cell Culture). Invasive potential in vitro of M cells was analyzed by Transwell-Matrigel assays. M cells were co-injected with S cells in the dorsal prostate of immunodeficient mice and monitored by bioluminescence for tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. SPARC levels were determined by immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR in tumors and by ELISA in plasma from patients with metastatic or non-metastatic prostate cancer.  Results:   Comparative secretome analysis yielded 213 proteins differentially secreted between M and S cells. Of these, the protein most abundantly secreted in S relative to M cells was SPARC. Immunodepletion of SPARC inhibited the enhanced invasiveness of M induced by S conditioned medium. Knock down of SPARC in S cells abrogated the capacity of its conditioned medium to enhance the in vitro invasiveness of M cells and compromised their potential to boost the metastatic behavior of M cells in vivo. In most primary human prostate cancer samples, SPARC was expressed in the epithelial tumoral compartment of metastatic cases.  Conclusions:   The matricellular protein SPARC, secreted by a prostate cancer clonal tumor cell subpopulation displaying non-CSC properties, is a critical mediator of paracrine effects exerted on a distinct tumor cell subpopulation enriched in CSC. This paracrine interaction results in an enhanced metastatic behavior of the CSC-enriched tumor subpopulation. SPARC is expressed in the neoplastic cells of primary prostate cancer samples from metastatic cases, and could thus constitute a tumor progression biomarker and a therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Francesca Mateo', 'Oscar Meca-Cortés', 'Toni Celià-Terrassa', 'Yolanda Fernández', 'Ibane Abasolo', 'Lourdes Sánchez-Cid', 'Raquel Bermudo', 'Amaia Sagasta', 'Leonardo Rodríguez-Carunchio', 'Mònica Pons', 'Verónica Cánovas', 'Mercedes Marín-Aguilera', 'Lourdes Mengual', 'Antonio Alcaraz', 'Simó Schwartz Jr', 'Begoña Mellado', 'Kristina Y Aguilera', 'Rolf Brekken', 'Pedro L Fernández', 'Rosanna Paciucci', 'Timothy M Thomson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and acquisition of cancerstem cell phenotypes.', 'Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) Mediates Metastatic Dormancy of Prostate Cancer in Bone.', 'The role of SPARC in the TRAMP model of prostate carcinogenesis and progression.', 'SPARC in Tumor Pathophysiology and as a Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Patient-derived xenografts, the cancer stem cell paradigm, and cancer pathobiology in the 21st century.', 'Omics Overview of the SPARC Gene in Mesothelioma.', 'The paradox of cooperation among selfish cancer cells.', 'Synergistic inter-clonal cooperation involving crosstalk, co-option and co-dependency can enhance the invasiveness of genetically distant cancer clones.', 'SPARC Induces E-Cadherin Repression and Enhances Cell Migration through Integrin αvβ3 and the Transcription Factor ZEB1 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Effect of SPARC Suppression in Mice, Perfused Human Anterior Segments, and Trabecular Meshwork Cells.']"""

Nanotechnology has the potential to facilitate the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer cases. Successful delivery of nucleic acids into cancer cells with the use of nanoparticles would be a significant improvement for medical and cellular biology. The use of nanoparticle-based vehicles in clinical treatment is considerably important for treating genetic disorders. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been suggested as therapeutic delivery tools for cancer. Because microRNAs (miRNAs), which induce post-transcriptional gene silencing, are deregulated in cancer cells, they are also considered as strong candidates for cancer therapy applications. In prostate and breast cancer, miR-145, a well-known tumor suppressor miRNA, is strongly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to their corresponding normal tissues.  Methods:   In the present study, we aimed to use engineered AuNPs as nanocarrier platforms to deliver miRNAs to prostate/breast cancer cells. 13-nm AuNPs were modified with thiolated RNAs and then the miR-145 was hybridized to the RNAs that were chemically attached to the AuNPs.

As an alternative to ePLND, sentinel-node dissection with preoperative isotope injection and imaging has been reported. The objective was to determine whether intraoperative sentinel-node detection with a simplified protocol can accurately determine lymph-node stage in prostate cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   Patients with biopsy-verified high-risk prostate cancer with tumour stage T2-3 were included in the study. All patients underwent both ePLND and sentinel-node detection. (99m)Tc-marked nanocolloid was injected peritumourally by the operating urologist after induction of anaesthesia just before surgery. Sentinel nodes were detected both in vivo and ex vivo intraoperatively using a gamma probe. Sentinel nodes and metastases and their locations were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated.  Results:   At least one sentinel node was detected in 72 (87%) of the 83 patients. In 13 (18%) of these 72 patients sentinel nodes were detected outside the ePLND template. In six of these 13 patients, the Sentinel nodes from outside the template contained metastases, which proved to be the only metastases in two. For 12 patients the only metastatic deposit found was a micrometastasis (≤2 mm) in a sentinel node. In the 72 patients with detectable sentinel nodes, pathological analysis of the sentinel node correctly categorized 71 and ePLND 70 patients.  Conclusions:   This protocol yielded results comparable to the commonly used technique of sentinel-node detection, but with more cases of non-detection.""","""['Henrik Kjölhede', 'Ola Bratt', 'Sigurdur Gudjonsson', 'Pernilla Sundqvist', 'Fredrik Liedberg']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['Editorial comment on ""Simplified intraoperative sentinel-node detection performed by the urologist accurately determines lymph-node stage in prostate cancer"".', 'Detection rate and operating time required for gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node resection after injection of technetium-99m nanocolloid into the prostate with and without preoperative imaging.', 'Detection of early lymph node metastases in prostate cancer by laparoscopic radioisotope guided sentinel lymph node dissection.', 'Laparoscopic radioisotope-guided sentinel lymph node dissection in staging of prostate cancer.', 'Advances in sentinel node dissection in prostate cancer from a technical perspective.', 'Sentinel Node Procedure in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review to Assess Diagnostic Accuracy.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Patients: Results From an Injection Technique Targeting the Index Lesion in the Prostate Gland.']"""

To establish an effective treatment strategy for recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy, we retrospectively analyzed the outcome of salvage radiation monotherapy in such cases.  Methods:   Data from 61 men who had undergone salvage radiation monotherapy for biochemical recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy were retrospectively reviewed. In all patients, salvage radiotherapy consisted of iraradiation to the prostatic bed (70 Gy) using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy techniques. Treatment outcome was analyzed to identify predictive factors of salvage radiotherapy.  Results:   The biochemical recurrence-free survival after salvage radiation monotherapy at 2 and 5 years was 55% and 38%, respectively. Cox proportional regression models revealed that the independent predictive factors for biochemical recurrence were Gleason Score ≥ 8, negative surgical margin, and PSA velocity ≥ 0.38 ng/mL/year. Negative surgical margin and PSA velocity ≥ 0.8 ng/mL/year were significantly associated with poor response in the serum PSA levels after salvage radiotherapy.  Conclusions:   Based on our findings, we propose a treatment strategy for biochemical recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy. Patients with Gleason score ≤ 7, positive surgical margin, and PSA velocity < 0.38 ng/mL/year are categorized the most favorable group, so that eradication by salvage radiation monotherapy could be expected.

This study compares two approaches to delivering a church-based peer community health advisor intervention consisting of a series of four men's health workshops on informed decision-making for prostate cancer screening. In the men-only group, male community health advisors teach group workshops consisting only of men. In the health partner group, male-female pairs of community health advisors teach workshops in a mixed-gender format in which enrolled men are asked to invite a significant woman in their lives (e.g., wife/partner, sister, daughter, friend) with them to the workshops. Eighteen African-American churches were randomized to receive one of the two approaches, and 283 eligible men enrolled in the intervention. Main findings suggested that the workshops had an impact on stage of decision-making, and this increased significantly over time in the health partner group only. The intervention was highly rated by men in both groups, and these ratings increased over time, with some study group differences. Within-workshop study group differences favored the health partner group in some instances; however, men in the men-only groups reported greater increases in their ratings of trust in the workshops over time.

These effects may include modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, but the ability to impinge on the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells by affecting cell motility should also be considered, as prostate tumor metastasis correlates with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Human growth hormone (hGH) can affect the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells, but the effect of hGH on prostate cancer cell motility is unknown. In the present study, the potential for exogenous and autocrine hGH to directly affect prostate cancer cell motility was addressed.  Materials and methods:   The effects of exogenous and autocrine hGH on the chemokinesis and chemotaxis of LNCaP prostate cancer cells were tested using cell monolayer wound healing and Boyden chamber invasion assays. The signaling pathways underlying these effects were resolved with chemical inhibitors and the correlation with cytoskeletal actin reorganization evaluated microscopically by staining cells with fluor-conjugated phalloidin.  Results:   Both exogenous and autocrine hGH augmented the migration and invasion of LNCaP cells, and hGH itself acted as a chemoattractant. This activity was dependent upon the STAT5, MEK1/2 and PI3K signaling pathways, and was accompanied by an alteration in cellular actin organization.

Of the first six marine-derived drugs that made anticancer clinical trials, three originated from ascidian specimens. In order to identify new anti-neoplastic compounds, an ascidian extract library (143 samples) was generated and screened in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using a real-time cell analyzer (RTCA). This resulted in 143 time-dependent cell response profiles (TCRP), which are read-outs of changes to the growth rate, morphology, and adhesive characteristics of the cell culture. Twenty-one extracts affected the TCRP of MDA-MB-231 cells and were further investigated regarding toxicity and specificity, as well as their effects on cell morphology and cell cycle. The results of these studies were used to prioritize extracts for bioassay-guided fractionation, which led to the isolation of the previously identified marine natural product, eusynstyelamide B (1). This bis-indole alkaloid was shown to display an IC50 of 5 µM in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Objective:   To study the association between deprivation and incidence of common cancer types in a Southern European region.  Methods:   Retrospective ecological study using the SIDIAP (Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care) database of longitudinal electronic medical records for a representative population of Catalonia (Spain) and the MEDEA index based on urban socioeconomic indicators in the Spanish census. Study outcomes were incident cervical, breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer in 2009-2012. The completeness of SIDIAP cancer recording was evaluated through linkage of a geographic data subset to a hospital cancer registry. Associations between MEDEA quintiles and cancer incidence was evaluated using zero-inflated Poisson regression adjusted for sex, age, smoking, alcoholism, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.  Results:   SIDIAP sensitivity was 63% to 92% for the five cancers studied. There was direct association between deprivation and lung, colorectal, and cervical cancer: incidence rate ratios (IRR) 1.82 [1.64-2.01], IRR 1.60 [1.34-1.90], IRR 1.22 [1.07-1.38], respectively, comparing the most deprived to most affluent areas. In wealthy areas, prostate and breast cancers were more common: IRR 0.92 [0.80-1.00], IRR 0.91 [0.78-1.06]. Adjustment for confounders attenuated the association with lung cancer risk (fully adjusted IRR 1.16 [1.08-1.25]), reversed the direction of the association with colorectal cancer (IRR 0.90 [0.84-0.95]), and did not modify the associations with cervical (IRR 1.27 [1.11-1.45]), prostate (0.74 [0.69-0.80]), and breast (0.76 [0.71-0.81]) cancer.  Conclusions:   Deprivation is associated differently with the occurrence of various cancer types.

We also found that FOXP1 acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer through inhibiting cell proliferation and migration. We generated an extensive global map of FOXP1 binding sites and found that FOXP1 is directly involved in AR-mediated transcription. We demonstrated that FOXP1 has a repressive effect on AR-induced transcriptional activity or histone modification in enhancer regions. Moreover, by a global analysis of androgen-mediated transcriptional networks, we observed enrichment of FOXP1 binding genes in the gene cluster negatively regulated by FOXP1. Evaluation of FOXP1 expression in clinical samples indicated that the decreased expression of FOXP1 is another prognostic factor of prostate cancer.

Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising approach to cancer therapy. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed in advanced prostate cancer and targeting this protein is used for imaging of advanced prostate cancer as well as development of targeting strategies. The objective of our studies was to evaluate the efficacy of PSMA ADC against a series of patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts (LuCaP 58, LuCaP 77, LuCaP 96CR, and LuCaP 105) with different characteristics, including varying levels of PSMA expression and responses to androgen suppression.  Methods:   Mice bearing subcutaneous LuCaP prostate cancer-derived xenografts received PSMA antibody monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) drug conjugate (PSMA ADC) in which the antibody and MMAE are linked via a protease-cleavable linker. PSMA ADC dose ranged from 1 to 6 mg/kg. Unmodified PSMA mAb + free MMAE at the amount equivalent to those contained in 6 mg/kg PSMA ADC was used as control. All treatments were administered once a week via tail-vein injections and repeated four times once a week and tumor responses were monitored for 10 weeks. IHC analyses were performed to determine PSMA and AR expression and effects on proliferation.  Results:   Treatment responses varied widely across the tumor models, from complete tumor regressions in LuCaP 96CR to largely unimpeded tumor progression of LuCaP 58, which had the lowest baseline level of PSMA expression. Intermediate antitumor effects were seen for LuCaP 77 and LuCaP 105 tumors, despite their having similar basal expression of PSMA as LuCaP 96CR. Interestingly, we detected substantial differences in responses even within the same model, indicating that PSMA expression is not the only factor involved in treatment outcomes.  Conclusions:   Our results show high efficacy of PSMA ADC in advanced prostate cancer but also considerable variability in effects despite PSMA expression.

Loss of RKIP expression promotes invasion and metastasis in cell transplantation animal models. However, it is unknown if RKIP expression can impact the progression of cancer in an autochthonous model of cancer. The goal of this study was to determine if loss of RKIP expression in a genetic mouse model of prostate cancer (PCa) impacts metastasis.  Methods:   Endogenous RKIP expression was measured in the primary tumors and metastases of transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP(+) ) mice. RKIP knockout mice (RKIP(-/-) ) were crossbred with (TRAMP(+) ) mice to create RKIP(-/-) TRAMP(+) mice. Mice were euthanized at 10, 20, and 30 weeks for evaluation of primary and metastatic tumor development. To determine if loss of RKIP alone promotes metastasis, RKIP was knocked down in the low metastatic LNCaP prostate cancer cell line.  Results:   Endogenous RKIP expression decreased in TRAMP(+) mice as tumors progressed. Primary tumors developed earlier in RKIP(-/-) TRAMP(+) compared to TRAMP(+) mice. At 30 weeks of age, distant metastases were identified only the RKIP(-/-) TRAMP(+) mice. While prostate epithelial cell proliferation rates were higher at 10 and 20 weeks in RKIP(-/-) TRAMP(+) compared to TRAMP(+) mice, by 30 weeks there was no difference. Apoptosis rates in both groups were similar at all timepoints. Decreased RKIP expression did not impact the metastatic rate of LNCaP in an orthotopic PCa model.  Conclusions:   These results demonstrate that loss of RKIP decreases latency of tumor development and promotes distant metastasis in the TRAMP mouse model in the context of a pro-metastatic background; but loss of RKIP alone is insufficient to promote metastasis. These findings suggest that in addition to its known metastasis suppressor activity, RKIP may promote tumor progression through enhancing tumor initiation.

Our first aim is to validate with mathematical simulations that IRE as currently practiced has a non-negligible thermal response. Our second aim is to present a method that allows simple temperature estimation to aid IRE treatment planning.  Methods:   We derived an approximate analytical solution of the bio-heat equation for multiple 2-needle IRE pulses in an electrically conducting medium, with and without a blood vessel, and incorporated published observations that an electric pulse increases the medium's electric conductance.  Results:   IRE simulation in prostate-resembling tissue shows thermal lesions with 67-92°C temperatures, which match the positions of the coagulative necrotic lesions seen in an experimental study. Simulation of IRE around a blood vessel when blood flow removes the heated blood between pulses confirms clinical observations that the perivascular tissue is thermally injured without affecting vascular patency.  Conclusions:   The demonstration that significant Joule heating surrounds current multiple-pulsed IRE practice may contribute to future in-depth discussions on this thermal issue. This is an important subject because it has long been under-exposed in literature. Its awareness pleads for preventing IRE from calling ""non-thermal"" in future publications, in order to provide IRE-users with the most accurate information possible. The prospect of thermal treatment planning as outlined in this paper likely aids to the important further successful dissemination of IRE in interventional medicine.

Mx proteins contain the typical GTP-binding motif and show significant homology to dynamin family of GTPases. Strong interaction of MxA with tubulin suggests that Mx proteins could be involved in mitosis. Studies have shown that MxA inhibit tumor motility/metastasis and virus induced apoptosis. However, the clear association between MxA expression and cancer remains unknown. Meta-analysis suggested that MxA expression was inversely correlated with prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we demonstrate the expression MxA in PCa and its functional significance on the cancer phenotype.  Methods:   The expression of MxA protein in prostate cancer was examined by immuno-histochemistry. MxA was knocked down (shMxA) or over-expressed (pMxA) in DU145 or LNCaP PCa cell lines respectively. These cell lines were used to study proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and anchorage independent growth. Co-localization of MxA with tubulin was performed by immuno-cytochemistry following Docetaxel treatment.  Results:   The expression of MxA protein was significantly decreased in PCa as compared to the normal tissues. DU145 cells lacking MxA (DU145 + chMxA) showed significant increase in proliferation, associated with decreased expression of CDKN1A and B. Increased migration, anchorage independent growth in DU145 + shMxA cells was associated with increased MMP13 expression. Tubulin organization was also dependent on MxA expression. Tubulin polymerizing agents such as Docetaxel was less effective in promoting apoptosis in cells lacking MxA due to altered tubulin organization. Gain of MxA expression in LNCaP cells (LNCaP + pMxA) resulted in cell cycle arrest that was associated with increased expression of CDKN1A. MxA expression was also down-regulated by dihydrotestosterone in LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   MxA expression is inversely correlated with prostate cancer. Down-regulation of MxA in LNCaP cells by DHT suggests that MxA could play a significant role in disease progression. Loss of MxA expression results in increased metastasis and decreased sensitivity to Docetaxel suggesting that MxA expression could determine the outcome of chemo-therapeutic treatment. Additional studies will be required to fully establish the cross-talk between androgen receptor-IFN pathway in regulating MxA expression in the normal prostate and prostate cancer.

Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is highly expressed in the prostate and has been associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis.  Methods:   To examine the relationship between GDF-15 and prostatic inflammation, GDF-15 expression was measured by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in human prostatectomy specimens containing inflammation. The relationship between GDF-15 and specific inflammatory cells was determined using non-biased computer image analysis. To provide insight into a potential suppressive role for GDF-15 in inflammation, activation of inflammatory mediator nuclear factor of kappa B (NFκB) was measured in PC3 cells.  Results:   GDF-15 expression in luminal epithelial cells was decreased with increasing inflammation severity, suggesting an inverse association between GDF-15 and inflammation.

Phase 2 testing of an ADC targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in advanced prostate cancer has shown antitumor activity. The present study examined PSMA ADC used in combination with potent antiandrogens (enzalutamide and abiraterone) and other compounds.  Methods:   Antiproliferative activity and expression of PSMA, prostate-specific antigen and androgen receptor were evaluated in the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2. Cells were tested for susceptibility to antiandrogens or other inhibitors, used alone and in combination with PSMA ADC. Potential drug synergy or antagonism was evaluated using the Bliss independence method.  Results:   Enzalutamide and abiraterone demonstrated robust, statistically significant synergy when combined with PSMA ADC. Largely additive activity was observed between the antiandrogens and the individual components of the ADC (free drug and unmodified antibody). Rapamycin also synergized with PSMA ADC in certain settings. Synergy was linked in part to upregulation of PSMA expression. In androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, enzalutamide and abiraterone each inhibited proliferation, upregulated PSMA expression, and synergized with PSMA ADC. In androgen-independent C4-2 cells, enzalutamide and abiraterone showed no measurable antiproliferative activity on their own but increased PSMA expression and synergized with PSMA ADC nonetheless. PSMA expression increased progressively over 3 weeks with enzalutamide and returned to baseline levels 1 week after enzalutamide removal.

PSA testing has been widely used to detect and screen prostate cancer. However, in the diagnostic gray zone, the PSA test does not clearly distinguish between benign prostate hypertrophy and prostate cancer due to their overlap. To develop more specific and sensitive candidate biomarkers for prostate cancer, an in-depth understanding of the biochemical characteristics of PSA (such as glycosylation) is needed. PSA has a single glycosylation site at Asn69, with glycans constituting approximately 8% of the protein by weight. Here, we report the comprehensive identification and quantitation of N-glycans from two PSA isoforms using LC-MS/MS. There were 56 N-glycans associated with PSA, whereas 57 N-glycans were observed in the case of the PSA-high isoelectric point (pI) isoform (PSAH). Three sulfated/phosphorylated glycopeptides were detected, the identification of which was supported by tandem MS data. One of these sulfated/phosphorylated N-glycans, HexNAc5Hex4dHex1s/p1 was identified in both PSA and PSAH at relative intensities of 0.52 and 0.28%, respectively. Quantitatively, the variations were monitored between these two isoforms.

Patients and methods:   All Chinese patients with prostate cancer who were treated primarily with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, with or without further ADT at our hospital from the year 2000 to 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. We compared the risk of AMI in the patients who were given further ADT (ADT group) with those who were not given any ADT (non-ADT group). Potential risk factors of AMI including age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, history of stroke, ischaemic heart disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) and duration of ADT were reviewed. The risk of AMI after ADT was first analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method, followed by Cox regression analyses including the potential risk factors mentioned.  Results:   In all, 452 patients were included, with 200 patients in the non-ADT group and 252 patients in the ADT group. The mean (sd) age was 68.2 (5.9) years in the non-ADT group and 69.5 (6.5) years in the ADT group, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.031). There were no significant differences in their pre-existing medical conditions or ECOG PS. The ADT group was associated with an increased risk of AMI when compared with the non-ADT group (P = 0.004) upon Kaplan-Meier analysis. Upon multivariate Cox regression analysis, hyperlipidaemia, poor ECOG PS and the use of ADT were the only three significant factors that were associated with increased risk of developing new AMI.  Conclusions:   There was increased risk of AMI after ADT for prostate cancer in a Chinese population. Hyperlipidaemia and poor ECOG PS were also significant risk factors for developing AMI.

However, GSK-3 inhibition can also activate signals that promote cell proliferation and survival, which may preclude the use of GSK-3 inhibitors in the clinic. To identify such signals in prostate cancer, we screened for changes in transcription factor target DNA binding activity in GSK-3-silenced cells. Among the alterations was a reduction in AR DNA target binding, as predicted from previous studies, and an increase in NFκB DNA target binding. Consistent with the latter, gene silencing of GSK-3 or inhibition using the GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR99021 increased basal NFκB transcriptional activity. Activation of NFκB was accompanied by an increase in the level of the NFκB family member RelB. Conversely, silencing RelB reduced activation of NFκB by CHIR99021. Furthermore, the reduction of prostate cancer cell proliferation by CHIR99021 was potentiated by inhibition of NFκB signaling using the IKK inhibitor PS1145. Finally, stratification of human prostate tumor gene expression data for GSK3 revealed an inverse correlation between NFκB-dependent and androgen-dependent gene expression, consistent with the results from the transcription factor target DNA binding screen. In addition, there was a correlation between expression of androgen-repressed NFκB target genes and reduced survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

Methods:   In 2,137 consecutive RP patients between 1998 and 2011 at Asan Medical Center, we aimed to assess the presence and impact of statin use according to types (hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic), dose equivalents (DEs), and postoperative duration of usage (<18, 18-36, >36 months). Between non-users and preoperative or postoperative users, clinicopathological characteristics, and impact of statin use on BCR were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model. Mean (range) follow-up was 39.4 (8-183) months.  Results:   Compared to non-users, preoperative users had lower PSA (5.8 vs. 7 ng/ml), but the rates of organ confined disease, pathologic Gleason score (GS) or positive surgical margin (PSM) were not different. After adjusting for pathologic stage, postoperative statin use was associated with a higher BCR-free survival. In multivariate analysis, ≤36 months' statin use independently decreased the risk of BCR along with PSA, pathologic GS, pathologic stage, and PSM. Risk reduction was observed especially in patients with pathologic GS ≥ 7 (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.59, P = 0.001), NSM disease (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.63, P = 0.007), or PSA ≥ 10.0 ng/ml (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.81, P = 0.018). Increasing duration of use nullified the effect. Preoperative statin use did not demonstrate significant risk reduction for BCR in any of the stratified multivariate models.  Conclusion:   In Korean men undergoing RP, preoperative statin use was not associated with different pathologic outcome. However, postoperative statin use until 36 months decreased the risk of BCR independently especially in patients with high-risk disease.""","""['Cheryn Song', 'Sejun Park', 'Jinsung Park', 'Myungsun Shim', 'Aram Kim', 'In Gab Jeong', 'Jun Hyuk Hong', 'Choung-Soo Kim', 'Hanjong Ahn']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Influence of statin use on clinicopathological characteristics of localized prostate cancer and outcomes obtained after radical prostatectomy: a single center study.', 'Effect of statin use on biochemical outcome following radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic Value of Biochemical Recurrence Following Treatment with Curative Intent for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Clinicopathological Significances of Positive Surgical Resection Margin after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostatic Cancers: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Statin Use and the Risk of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence Following Definitive Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.', 'The association of statin use and biochemical recurrence after curative treatment for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prostate cancer prognosis after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy among statin users.

Modern biopsy and surveillance protocols, and advances in prostate cancer imaging, have renewed interest in TZ prostate cancers. We compared TZ and PZ prostate cancer to determine if cancer location is independently associated with better outcomes.  Methods:   We evaluated an expanded cohort of 1354 men who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1983 and 2003 with updated long-term clinical follow-up. Regression models were used to compare the volume of high-grade (Gleason 4 or 5) cancer and total cancer volume by location. Uni- and multi-variable logistic regression models tested the associations between cancer location and adverse pathologic features. Multivariable proportional hazard models were fit to examine cancer recurrence.  Results:   Patients with TZ cancer presented with higher pre-operative serum PSA values (11.07 vs. 7.86 ng/ml) and larger total cancer volume (7.1 vs. 3.8 cc). Patients with TZ cancer had decreased odds of seminal vesicle invasion (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03, 0.21), extra-capsular extension (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35, 0.92), and lymphovascular invasion (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.27, 0.87) in multivariable models.

We report a detailed longitudinal study for development of CRPC in men initially treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).  Methods:   During 1991-2008, 2,478 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with dose-escalated EBRT at a single institution. The primary objective was to determine predictors of CRPC among men who failed definitive EBRT and progressed to salvage androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). CRPC was defined as castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dl) with progressive biochemical or radiographic disease.  Results:   For the entire cohort (n = 2,478), the 10-year cumulative incidence rate for developing CRPC was 9.9%. For those that progressed to salvage ADT (n = 362), the 7-year cumulative incidence rates for developing CRPC from time of salvage ADT was 33.7%. Amongst this cohort, multivariable analysis demonstrated that PSA doubling-time (continuous; hazard ratio [HR], 0.98 [0.97-0.99], P < 0.001), higher Gleason score (HR, 1.96 [1.12-3.43]; P = 0.034), and duration of ADT at time of EBRT (continuous; HR, 1.02 [1.01-1.03]; P = 0.007) were associated with development of CRPC.  Conclusions:   This represents the first report of predictors of CRPC for patients treated with modern dose-escalated EBRT. We demonstrate that among the minority of patients not initially cured after EBRT, those treated with longer-course ADT have higher rates of resistance to the re-introduction of ADT.

The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the accuracy of PHI and PCA-3 scores to predict overall and significant PCa in men undergoing an initial prostate biopsy.  Methods:   Double-blind assessments of PHI and PCA-3 were conducted by referent physicians in 138 patients who subsequently underwent trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy according to a 12-core scheme. Predictive accuracies of PHI and PCA-3 were assessed using AUC and compared according to the DeLong method. Diagnostic performances with usual cut-off values for positivity (i.e., PHI >40 and PCA-3 >35) were calculated, and odds ratios associated with predicting PCa overall and significant PCa as defined by pathological updated Epstein criteria (i.e., Gleason score ≥7, more than three positive cores, or >50% cancer involvement in any core) were estimated using logistic regression.  Results:   Prevalences of overall and significant PCa were 44.9% and 28.3%, respectively. PCA-3 (AUC = 0.71) was the most accurate predictor of PCa overall, and significantly outperformed PHI (AUC = 0.65; P = 0.03). However, PHI (AUC = 0.80) remained the most accurate predictor when screening exclusively for significant PCa and significantly outperformed PCA-3 (AUC = 0.55; P = 0.03). Furthermore, PCA-3 >35 had the best accuracy, and positive or negative predictive values when screening for PCa overall whereas these diagnostic performances were greater for PHI >40 when exclusively screening for significant PCa. PHI > 40 combined with PCA-3 > 35 was more specific in both cases. In multivariate analyses, PCA-3 >35 (OR = 5.68; 95%CI = [2.21-14.59]; P < 0.001) was significantly correlated with the presence of PCa overall, but PHI >40 (OR = 9.60; 95%CI = [1.72-91.32]; P = 0.001) was the only independent predictor for detecting significant PCa.

Recent studies have indicated that also early anti-androgen exposure may affect prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   We examined the influence of perinatal exposure to mixtures of anti-androgenic and estrogenic chemicals on prostate development. Wistar rats were exposed from gestation day 7 to postnatal day 22 to a mixture of 8 anti-androgenic compounds (AAMix), a mixture of four estrogenic compounds (EMix), or paracetamol or a mixture of all 13 compounds (TotalMix) in mixture ratios reflecting human exposure levels.  Results:   Ventral prostate weights were reduced by the TotalMix and AAMix in pre-pubertal rats. Histological changes in prostate appeared with increasing age and indicated a shift from the normal age-dependent epithelial atrophy towards hyperplasia. These lesions showed similarities to pre-cancerous lesions in humans. Increased proliferation was observed already in pre-puberty and it was hypothesized that this could be associated with reduced ERβ signaling, but no clear conclusions could be made from gene expression studies on ERβ-related pathways.

Methods:   Bone scans of various patients were analyzed by BONENAVI version 2. Patients with skeletal metastasis from prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers were included in the study as true positive cases. Patients with normal bone scans, consecutive patients with several days of no skeletal metastasis (regardless of hot spots), and patients with abnormal bone scans but no skeletal metastasis were included as negative cases. Patient artificial neural network (ANN) values equal to or above 0.5 were regarded as positive, and those below 0.5 as negative. This study also analyzed cases according to primary cancer factors, osseous metastasis type, and bone tumor burden.  Results:   The sensitivity of patient ANN values was 121/142 (85 %) for all cancers, 25/29 (86 %) for prostate cancer, 35/40 (88 %) for lung cancer, 37/45 (82 %) for breast cancer, and 24/28 (86 %) for other cancers. The specificity of ANN values was 40/49 (82 %) for normal bone scans, 99/122 (81 %) for consecutive patients with several days of no skeletal metastasis, and 44/81 (54 %) for patients with abnormal bone scans but no skeletal metastasis. Patients showing false negatives included: 10 patients with small lesions (6 of whom showed positive lesion ANN values), 4 patients with osteolytic lesions, 5 patients with intertrabecular osseous metastasis, and 1 patient with a metastatic lesion adjacent to the urinary bladder. The correlation between manually counted lesion numbers and Bone Scan Index was excellent for prostate cancer, and was good for lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers.

Methods:   HRQoL data were collected from patients with mCRPC who were enrolled in an observational study conducted in 47 centers across six European Union countries. Utility values were generated using a UK-specific EQ-5D value set. The predictive validity of the five FACT-P subscales, patient demographics, comorbidities and prior chemotherapy was tested using ordinary least squares (OLS), median, Gamma and Tobit multivariate regression models.  Results:   FACT-P and EQ-5D questionnaires were completed by 602 (86 %) patients. Mean age [standard deviation (SD)] was 72.1 (7.9) years, mean time from diagnosis (SD) was 5.4 (4.4) years, and mean time since failure of androgen deprivation therapy (SD) was 1.0 (1.6) years.

Methods and study design:   Twenty consecutive patients treated with intensity-modulated or intensity-modulated arc therapy to the prostate bed were retrospectively evaluated. Both the planning tomography and kilovoltage-cone-beam computed tomography were acquired with an empty rectum and a half-full bladder. Target localization was performed on the basis of soft tissue matching using cone-beam computed tomography scans before each treatment fraction. A total of 16 cone-beam computed tomography scans per patient (acquired at the first 5 fractions and twice weekly thereafter) were used for the assessments. The bladder and rectum were re-contoured offline on each cone-beam computed tomography scan by a single physician, and the delivered doses were recalculated. The variations in certain dose-volume parameters for the rectum and bladder (BD2cc, RD 2cc, V40%, V50%, V60%, V65%) were analyzed using the paired t test.  Results:   Most of the dose volume variations for rectum and bladder were significantly higher than predicted (P <0.05) for the 320 kilovoltage-cone-beam computed tomography sets, except for the doses received by 2 cc of the bladder and V50 and V60 of the rectum. The dose-volume parameters of the bladder did not meet our criteria of V65 ≤25% and V40 ≤50% in 10% and 20% of the patients, respectively. None of the dose-volume histograms showed rectal V65 ≥17%; however, the rectal V40 ≤35% dose constraint was not met in 11 patients. For all patients, the ANOVA test revealed no significant difference between the variations.  Conclusion:   Actual doses delivered during treatment were found to be higher than predicted, but the majority of calculated bladder and rectal doses remained in the limits of our plan acceptance criteria. Interfraction variability of the rectum and bladder is a major concern in the postprostatectomy radiotherapy setting, even when patients are instructed about rectal and bladder preparation before the radiotherapy course.

Results:   Analysis of the 3,137 cone-beam computed tomography images (201 patients) revealed that the margins between the clinical target volume and planning target volume with skin marks registration should be 1.24 cm in the anteroposterior, 0.98 cm in the craniocaudal, and 1.03 cm in the laterolateral direction.

We investigated whether there is a correlation between prolonged use of aspirin and prognostic risk in prostate cancer.  Methods and study design:   From January 2002 to December 2007 we performed 385 radical prostatectomies for localized prostate cancer. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group A (GA) comprised 174 patients who took aspirin 100 mg once daily for 2 years or more; group B (GB) consisted of 211 patients who did not take NSAIDs, or only occasionally. To evaluate the correlation between aspirin use and prognostic risk in prostate cancer we examined the following factors: biochemical recurrence, percentage of positive surgical margins, pathological stage, pathological Gleason score, percentage of positive lymph nodes, and preoperative PSA level.  Results:   There was no statistical difference in preoperative PSA levels (6.5 and 6.9 ng/mL; P = 0.045) between the 2 groups. The incidence of positive surgical margins was 18.9% in GA and 28.9% in GB (P <0.002). The percentage of positive lymph nodes in patients with positive surgical margins in GB (47.5%) was statistically higher than that in GA (27.2%). With an average follow-up period of 4.6 years, 22.7% of patients in GA and 32.7% in GB developed biochemical recurrence. In the stratified analysis we observed significant differences in the association between prediagnostic aspirin use and prognostic risk for patients with Gleason score 7 and T2 stage of disease. The daily use of aspirin was significantly associated with a lower risk of disease progression, with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-0.99).  Conclusions:   These results provide further evidence that aspirin may have chemopreventive activity against prostate cancer and highlight the need for additional research.

This compound also exerts antiproliferative effects in several human cancer cell lines. Although auranofin induces apoptosis in human cancer cells, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated auranofin-mediated inhibition of cell growth and induction of mitochondrial apoptosis in PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Treatment with auranofin significantly inhibited cell viability with an IC50 value of 2.5 μM after 24 h. In particular, when cells were treated with 2.5 μM auranofin, there was a 2.2-fold increase in apoptotic cells compared to untreated cells. Auranofin activated caspase-3 and -8 in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased the levels of mitochondrial anti-apoptotic factors, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. In addition, auranofin enhanced oligomerization of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, auranofin significantly enhanced annexin A5 mRNA and protein expression and promoted annexin A5 translocation into the mitochondria. In order to characterize the function of annexin A5 in auranofin-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, annexin A5 was depleted using siRNA. Annexin A5 siRNA suppressed auranofin-mediated annexin A5 expression and VDAC oligomerization. Accordingly, annexin A5 depletion rescued auranofin-induced apoptosis, which may be mediated by caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that auranofin induces mitochondrial apoptosis through induction of annexin A5 expression and translocation as well as VDAC oligomerization in human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Nahee Park', 'Young-Jin Chun']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Toxicol Environ Health A""","""['Chimaphilin induces apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells through a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway.', 'Role of annexin A5 in cisplatin-induced toxicity in renal cells: molecular mechanism of apoptosis.', 'Danthron, an anthraquinone derivative, induces DNA damage and caspase cascades-mediated apoptosis in SNU-1 human gastric cancer cells through mitochondrial permeability transition pores and Bax-triggered pathways.', 'Annexin A5 as a potential marker in tumors.', 'Molecular imaging of apoptosis with radio-labeled Annexin A5 focused on the evaluation of tumor response to chemotherapy.', '3D imaging analysis on an organoid-based platform guides personalized treatment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Auranofin and ICG-001 Emerge Synergistic Anti-tumor Effect on Canine Breast Cancer by Inducing Apoptosis via Mitochondrial Pathway.', 'Combination of Auranofin and ICG-001 Suppress the Proliferation and Metastasis of Colon Cancer.', 'Upgrade of an old drug: Auranofin in innovative cancer therapies to overcome drug resistance and to increase drug effectiveness.', 'AnnexinA5 promote glioma cell invasion and migration via the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway.']"""

To determine whether clusterin plays an important role in cellular proliferation, the function of clusterin was examined using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) in PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Transient transfection with clusterin siRNA resulted in significant suppression of clusterin mRNA and protein expression. Clusterin knockdown resulted in a decrease in protein expression of phospho-Akt and an increase in expression of proteins phosphatase type 2AC (PP2AC) and phosphorylation of p38. However, treatment with PP2AC siRNA exerted minimal effects on clusterin expression. Interestingly, clusterin mRNA expression was reduced in paclitaxel-treated cells, and the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel was more potent when cells were incubated with clusterin siRNA. In addition, co-treatment with paclitaxel and clusterin siRNA significantly enhanced PP2AC levels.

Materials and methods:   Between November 2011 and December 2013, 30 patients (39 lesions) were treated with SBRT, delivered using Cyberknife, for recurrent prostate cancer with isolated nodal metastases. Prescribed doses and schedules of fractionation varied, ranging from 24 Gy in 1 fraction to 36 Gy in 3 fractions. Most commonly used schedules were 30 Gy in 3 fractions and 36 in Gy in 3 fractions on alternating days. Biochemical response, acute and late toxicity were analyzed.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 12 months (range 2-24.9), a significant reduction of PSA was observed in 24 cases, while PSA was stable in 1 case and raised in 9 cases. At the time of analysis, among the 30 patients treated, two were dead for systemic disease; 12 patients experienced a relapse of disease in other sites. Sixteen patients were still free of disease.

To what extent genetic risk can be reduced by environmental factors is unknown.  Methods:   We evaluated effect modification by environmental factors of the association between susceptibility SNPs and prostate cancer in 1,230 incident prostate cancer cases and 1,361 controls, all white and similar ages, nested in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Trial. Genetic risk scores were calculated as number of risk alleles for 20 validated SNPs. We estimated the association between higher genetic risk (≥12 SNPs) and prostate cancer within environmental factor strata and tested for interaction.  Results:   Men with ≥12 risk alleles had 1.98, 2.04, and 1.91 times the odds of total, advanced, and nonadvanced prostate cancer, respectively. These associations were attenuated with the use of selenium supplements, aspirin, ibuprofen, and higher vegetable intake. For selenium, the attenuation was most striking for advanced prostate cancer: compared with <12 alleles and no selenium, the OR for ≥12 alleles was 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.67-2.55] in nonusers and 0.99 (0.38-2.58) in users (Pinteraction = 0.031). Aspirin had the most marked attenuation for nonadvanced prostate cancer: compared with <12 alleles and nonusers, the OR for ≥12 alleles was 2.25 (1.69-3.00) in nonusers and 1.70 (1.25-2.32) in users (Pinteraction = 0.009). This pattern was similar for ibuprofen (Pinteraction = 0.023) and vegetables (Pinteraction = 0.010).  Conclusions:   This study suggests that selenium supplements may reduce genetic risk of advanced prostate cancer, whereas aspirin, ibuprofen, and vegetables may reduce genetic risk of nonadvanced prostate cancer.

We have recently reported that novel (99m)Tc-labeled small-molecule PSMA inhibitors bind with high affinity to PSMA-positive tumor cells in vitro and localize in PCa xenografts. This study reports the first, to our knowledge, human data in men with metastatic PCa and in healthy male subjects.  Methods:   Under an exploratory investigational new drug, using a cross-over design, we compared the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and tumor uptake of (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 and (99m)Tc-MIP-1405 in 6 healthy men and 6 men with radiographic evidence of metastatic PCa. Whole-body images were obtained at 10 min and 1, 2, 4, and 24 h. SPECT was performed between 3 and 4 h after injection.  Results:   Both agents cleared the blood rapidly, with MIP-1404 demonstrating significantly lower urinary activity (7%) than MIP-1405 (26%). Both agents showed persistent uptake in the salivary, lacrimal, and parotid glands. Uptake in the liver and kidney was acceptable for imaging at 1-2 h. In men with PCa, both agents rapidly localized in bone and lymph node lesions as early as 1 h. SPECT demonstrated excellent lesion contrast. Good correlation was seen with bone scanning; however, more lesions were demonstrated with (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 and (99m)Tc-MIP-1405. The high-contrast images exhibited tumor-to-background ratios from 3:1 to 9:1 at 4 and 20 h.  Conclusion:   Compared with the standard-of-care bone scanning, (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 and (99m)Tc-MIP-1405 identified most bone metastatic lesions and rapidly detected soft-tissue PCa lesions including subcentimeter lymph nodes.

Nobiletin has been reported to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, but the mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of nobiletin in prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145.  Methods:   Nobiletin was isolated from a polymethoxy flavonoid mixture using HPLC, cell viability was analyzed with MTS-based assays. Protein expression was examined by ELISA and western blotting. Gene expression was examined by luciferase assay. And the pathways were examined by manipulating genetic components with plasmid transfection.  Results:   Data showed that nobiletin decreased cell viability in both prostate cell lines, with a greater reduction in viability in PC-3 cells. HIF-1α expression and AKT phosphorylation were decreased in both cell lines. The VEGF expression was inhibited in PC-3 but not DU-145 cells. cMyc expression was decreased in DU-145 cells. Nobiletin down-regulated NF-κB (p50) expression in nuclei of DU145 cells but not whole cells. It also suppressed NF-κB expression in both whole cells and nuclei of PC-3 cells. Increasing HIF-1α levels reversed nobiletin's inhibitory effects on VEGF expression, and up-regulating AKT levels reversed its inhibitory effects on HIF-1α expression. We speculate that AKT influences cell viability probably by its effect on NF-κB in both prostate cells. The effect of nobiletin on VEGF expression in PC-3 cell lines was through the AKT/HIF-1α pathway.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our results show that nobiletin suppresses cell viability through AKT pathways, with a more profound effect against the more metastatic PC-3 line. Due to this enhanced action against a more malignant cell type, nobiletin may be used to improve prostate cancer survival rates.""","""['Jianchu Chen', 'Ashley Creed', 'Allen Y Chen', 'Haizhi Huang', 'Zhaoliang Li', 'Gary O Rankin', 'Xingqian Ye', 'Guihua Xu', 'Yi Charlie Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Pharmacol Toxicol""","""['YC-1 inhibits HIF-1 expression in prostate cancer cells: contribution of Akt/NF-kappaB signaling to HIF-1alpha accumulation during hypoxia.', 'The flavonoid nobiletin inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis of ovarian cancers via the Akt pathway.', 'Nobiletin, a citrus flavonoid, suppresses invasion and migration involving FAK/PI3K/Akt and small GTPase signals in human gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cells.', 'Radiation-induced HIF-1alpha cell survival pathway is inhibited by soy isoflavones in prostate cancer cells.', ""Androgens stimulate hypoxia-inducible factor 1 activation via autocrine loop of tyrosine kinase receptor/phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/protein kinase B in prostate cancer cells."", 'Circadian disruption: from mouse models to molecular mechanisms and cancer therapeutic targets.', 'Agri-Food By-Products in Cancer: New Targets and Strategies.', 'The Crucial Role of AR-V7 in Enzalutamide-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Mechanism of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium as an Anticancer Agent from the Perspective of Flavonoids: A Review.', 'Nobiletin, a citrus polymethoxyflavone, enhances the effects of bicalutamide on prostate cancer cells via down regulation of NF-κB, STAT3, and ERK activation.']"""

The majority of metastatic PCa express wild-type p53, whereas loss of p63 expression, a p53 family member, is a common event. Here we identify inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP), a common cellular regulator of p53 and p63, as an important player of PCa progression. Detailed analysis of the prostate epithelium of iASPP transgenic mice, iASPP(Δ8/Δ8) mice, revealed that iASPP deficiency resulted in a reduction in the number of p63 expressing basal epithelial cells compared with that seen in wild-type mice. Nuclear and cytoplasmic iASPP expression was greater in PCa samples compared with benign epithelium. Importantly nuclear iASPP associated with p53 accumulation in vitro and in vivo. A pair of isogenic primary and metastatic PCa cell lines revealed that nuclear iASPP is enriched in the highly metastatic PCa cells. Nuclear iASPP is often detected in PCa cells located at the invasive leading edge in vivo. Increased iASPP expression associated with metastatic disease and PCa-specific death in a clinical cohort with long-term follow-up. These results suggest that iASPP function is required to maintain the expression of p63 in normal basal prostate epithelium, and nuclear iASPP may inactivate p53 function and facilitate PCa progression. Thus iASPP expression may act as a predictive marker of PCa progression.""","""['E V Morris', 'L Cerundolo', 'M Lu', 'C Verrill', 'F Fritzsche', 'M J White', 'G N Thalmann', 'C S ten Donkelaar', 'I Ratnayaka', 'V Salter', 'F C Hamdy', 'X Lu', 'R J Bryant']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP) prevents senescence and is required for epithelial stratification.', 'iASPP inhibits p53-independent apoptosis by inhibiting transcriptional activity of p63/p73 on promoters of proapoptotic genes.', 'miR-129 targets CDK1 and iASPP to modulate Burkitt lymphoma cell proliferation in a TAp63-dependent manner.', 'Reactivating p53 functions by suppressing its novel inhibitor iASPP: a potential therapeutic opportunity in p53 wild-type tumors.', 'p63 in prostate biology and pathology.', 'p53 inhibitor iASPP is an unexpected suppressor of KRAS and inflammation-driven pancreatic cancer.', 'Hyaluronan-Induced CD44-iASPP Interaction Affects Fibroblast Migration and Survival.', 'iASPP contributes to cell cortex rigidity, mitotic cell rounding, and spindle positioning.', 'LncRNA XIST Promotes Growth of Human Chordoma Cells by Regulating miR-124-3p/iASPP Pathway.', 'ASPP1 deficiency promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer.']"""

EZH2 is overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer and has been shown to promote cell proliferation and metastasis. Here we show that EZH2 also suppresses prostate cancer apoptosis by coordinating the epigenetic silencing of two proapoptotic microRNAs (miRNA), miR-205 and miR-31. We previously reported that miR-205 promotes apoptosis by targeting antiapoptotic protein Bcl-w and miR-205 is silenced in prostate cancer through promoter methylation. In this study, we found that EZH2 suppresses miR-31 expression by trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 on the miR-31 promoter. SiRNA knockdown of EZH2 increased miR-31 expression and decreased the antiapoptotic protein E2F6 (E2F transcription factor 6) (a target of miR-31), resulting in the sensitization of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel-induced apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of EZH2 blocked docetaxel-induced apoptosis. We further demonstrated that miR-205 silencing is linked to miR-31 silencing through EZH2. Suppression of miR-205 with an miRNA inhibitor caused an increase of EZH2 protein, which in turn inhibited miR-31 expression. Conversely, overexpression of miR-205 decreased EZH2 protein and increased miR-31 expression. In paired human prostate cancer specimens and adjacent normal tissues, we observed that the decrease of miR-205 expression correlated with EZH2 overexpression and miR-31 silencing. Thus, EZH2 integrates the epigenetic silencing of miR-205 and miR-31 to confer resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.""","""['Q Zhang', 'S K R Padi', 'D J Tindall', 'B Guo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Yin Yang 1-mediated epigenetic silencing of tumour-suppressive microRNAs activates nuclear factor-κB in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Genomic loss of microRNA-101 leads to overexpression of histone methyltransferase EZH2 in cancer.', 'Down-regulation of human DAB2IP gene expression mediated by polycomb Ezh2 complex and histone deacetylase in prostate cancer.', 'EZH2 in Bladder Cancer, a Promising Therapeutic Target.', 'Roles of enhancer of zeste homolog 2: from skeletal muscle differentiation to rhabdomyosarcoma carcinogenesis.', 'Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Regulation Landscape in HPV+ Cancers: Biological and Clinical Implications.', 'Differential Expression of E2F Transcription Factors and Their Functional and Prognostic Roles in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'The clinical significance of circulating miR-21, miR-142, miR-143, and miR-146a in patients with prostate cancer.', 'EZH2 modulates retinoic acid signaling to ensure myotube formation during development.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the functional and prognostic value of E2F transcription factors in human prostate cancer through data mining and experimental validation.']"""

With a mean total dose of 76 Gy to the planning target volume, rectal wall volumes included in the 70 Gy, 60 Gy, 50 Gy isodoses were 0 cm(3), 0 cm(3), and 0.4 cm(3) with a spacer and 2.9 cm(3), 4.5 cm(3), and 6.2 cm(3) without a spacer, respectively. The patient reported rectal urgency during radiotherapy, completely resolving after the end of treatment. The PSA level was 5.4 ng/ml a week before the end of radiotherapy and dropped to 0.9 ng/ml 5 months after radiotherapy.  Conclusion:   A hydrogel spacer was successfully applied for dose-escalated radiotherapy in a patient with macroscopic local prostate cancer recurrence at the urethrovesical anastomosis to decrease the dose at the rectal wall.

The goal of this work was to evaluate the influence of relevant patient- and treatment-related factors.  Materials and methods:   The study population comprised 312 consecutive patients treated with permanent seed implantation. All patients were evaluable for analysis of overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS), 230 for bRFS, of which 192 were in the PSI group and 38 in the COMB group. The prescribed minimum peripheral dose was 145 Gy for PSI, for COMB 110 Gy implant and external beam radiotherapy of 45 Gy. The median follow-up time was 33 months (range 8-66 months). bRFS was defined as a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≤ 0.2 ng/ml at last follow-up.  Results:   Overall, the actuarial bRFS at 50 months was 88.4 %. The 50-month bRFS rate for PSI and COMB was 90.9 %, and 77.2 %, respectively.

Methods:   The study cohort consisted of 784 patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant or adjuvant endocrine therapy. The relationships of biochemical recurrence with perioperative findings were evaluated. The prognostic factors for biochemical recurrence-free survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard model analyses.  Results:   During the follow-up period, 80 patients showed biochemical recurrence. The biochemical recurrence-free survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 92.2%, 85.2% and 80.1%, respectively.

This study aimed to assess secular changes in incidences of common cancers in Khuzestan province from 2004 to 2008.  Materials and methods:   Data were collected from Khuzestan cancer registry which is a branch of Iranian Ministry of Health Cancer Registry (http://ircancer.ir) for the period 2004-2008. Data were presented as incidence rates by site, sex, age, using the crude rate and age-standardized rate (ASR) per 105 persons. A direct method of standardization was applied according to the WHO guideline and data analysis was performed using the SPSS package.  Results:   During the 2004-2008 period, 14,893 new cases of cancer were registered in Khuzestan cancer registry. The age- standardized incidence rate of all cancers was 153.7 per 105 in males and 156.4 per 105 in females. The incidence was increased over the period of five years. The most incident cancers among males were skin cancer (ASR =18.7/105), stomach cancer (ASR13.8/105), lung cancer (ASR12.9/105), leukemia (ASR=12.6/105) and prostate cancer (ASR=12.4/105).

Recent studies have demonstrated that asymmetric small interfering RNA (asiRNA)-mediated gene silencing is more effective and longer-lasting than conventional symmetric siRNA. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the effects of GRP78-specific asiRNA on human prostate cancer cells. A series of asiRNAs was synthesized and their efficiency in silencing GRP78 expression in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells was evaluated. The effects of knockdown using asiRNAs were compared to those of knockdown using symmetric siRNAs. The effect of GRP78 silencing on PC-3 cell apoptosis and migration, and the possible mechanisms governing these biological processes were examined. Compared with the symmetric siRNA, transfection with the 15 base pair asiRNA (asiGRP78-3) resulted in greater downregulation of GRP78 expression. GRP78 depletion in PC-3 cells resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased migration of these cells. Experiments investigating the underlying mechanisms of these effects revealed that knockdown of GRP78 attenuated protein kinase B activation and decreased the expression of pro-caspase 9, pro-caspase 3 and vimentin.

The study population included 240 pathologically diagnosed cases of PCa and 223 age-matched controls. Among the 789 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database variants detected, 129 were reported in two Asian groups (Han Chinese and Japanese) in the HapMap database. Only 21 polymorphisms of CYP17A1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A43 were selected based on linkage disequilibrium in Asians (r2 = 1), locations (SNPs in exons were preferred), and amino acid changes and were assessed. In addition, we performed haplotype analysis for the 21 SNPs in CYP17A1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A43 genes. To determine the association between genotype and haplotype distributions of patients and controls, logistic analyses were carried out, controlling for age. Twelve sequence variants and five major haplotypes were identified in CYP17A1. Five sequence variants and two major haplotypes were identified in CYP3A4.

The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical utility of abiraterone and its impact on circulating androgens following ketoconazole.  Experimental design:   Chemotherapy-naïve patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and prior ketoconazole therapy ≥28 days received abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with PSA response, defined as ≥30% PSA decline at 12 weeks. H0 = 0.30 versus H1 = 0.50 (α = 0.05, power = 0.83). Circulating androgen levels were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.  Results:   Thirty-nine patients were included in the final analysis. Twenty (51%; 95% confidence interval, 36%-66%) patients had ≥30% PSA decline; the null hypothesis was rejected. Sixteen (41%) had ≥50% PSA decline. Median PFS (progression-free survival) was 16 weeks; median radiographic PFS (rPFS) was 36 weeks. Samples for measurement of baseline androgens were available in 37 patients.

Numerous test tube and animal studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids may prevent or inhibit the growth of cancers, suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids are important in cancer physiology. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is one of an essential omega-3 fatty acid and organic compound found in seeds (chia and flaxseed), nuts (notably walnuts), and many common vegetable oils. ALA has also been shown to down-regulate cell proliferation of prostate, breast, and bladder cancer cells. However, direct evidence that ALA suppresses to the development of colon cancer has not been studied. Also, no previous studies have evaluated whether ALA may regulate malignant potential (adhesion, invasion and colony formation) in colon cancer cells. In order to address the questions above, we conducted in vitro studies and evaluated whether ALA may down-regulate malignant potential in human (HT29 and HCT116) and mouse (MCA38) colon cancer cell lines. We observed that treatment with 1-5 mM of ALA inhibits cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion in both human and mouse colon cancer cell lines. Interestingly, we observed that ALA did not decrease total colony numbers when compared to control. By contrast, we found that size of colony was significantly changed by ALA treatment when compared to control in all colon cancer cell lines. We suggest that our data enhance our current knowledge of ALA's mechanism and provide crucial information to further the development of new therapies for the management or chemoprevention of colon cancer.""","""['John P Chamberland', 'Hyun-Seuk Moon']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Fam Cancer""","""['AMPK/p53 Axis Is Essential for α-Lipoic Acid-Regulated Metastasis in Human and Mouse Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Alpha linolenic acid and oleic acid additively down-regulate malignant potential and positively cross-regulate AMPK/S6 axis in OE19 and OE33 esophageal cancer cells.', 'HER2 (erbB-2)-targeted effects of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3), in breast cancer cells: the ""fat features"" of the ""Mediterranean diet"" as an ""anti-HER2 cocktail"".', 'Biological activity of linseed oil as the source of omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid.', 'Beyond Fish Oil Supplementation: The Effects of Alternative Plant Sources of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids upon Lipid Indexes and Cardiometabolic Biomarkers-An Overview.', 'CircRNA MBOAT2 promotes intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression and lipid metabolism reprogramming by stabilizing PTBP1 to facilitate FASN mRNA cytoplasmic export.', 'Association between dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and risk of colorectal cancer in the Japanese population: The Japan Collaborative Cohort Study.', 'A novel role of FoxO3a in the migration and invasion of trophoblast cells: from metabolic remodeling to transcriptional reprogramming.', 'Association of Dietary Intake and Biomarker of α-Linolenic Acid With Incident Colorectal Cancer: A Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies.', 'Herb and Spices in Colorectal Cancer Prevention and Treatment: A Narrative Review.']"""

We screened these regions by targeted DNA sequencing to search for cancer-associated variants. Altogether, four novel susceptibility alleles were identified. Two ZNF652 (17q21.3) variants, rs116890317 and rs79670217, increased the risk of both sporadic and hereditary PrCa (rs116890317: OR = 3.3-7.8, p = 0.003-3.3 × 10(-5) ; rs79670217: OR = 1.6-1.9, p = 0.002-0.009).

This expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis identified 272 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) possibly regulating six genes that were differentially expressed between cases and controls. In a modified approach, prefiltered PrCa-associated SNPs were exploited and interestingly, a novel eQTL targeting ZNF652 was identified. The novel variants identified in this study could be utilized for PrCa risk assessment, and they further validate the suggested role of ZNF652 as a PrCa candidate gene.

Methods:   Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining on prostatectomy specimens from 3,123 patients who underwent RP for prostate cancer was retrospectively performed. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess the association of Ki-67 status with BCR.

Failure of chemotherapies and hormone-deprivation therapies is the major cause of death in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Currently, the androgen inhibitors enzalutamide and abiraterone are approved for treatment of metastatic CRPC. Here we show for the first time that both enzalutamide and abiraterone render prostate tumor cells more sensitive to T cell-mediated lysis through immunogenic modulation, and that these immunomodulatory activities are androgen receptor (AR)-dependent. In studies reported here, the NAIP gene was significantly down-regulated in human prostate tumor cells treated in vitro and in vivo with enzalutamide. Functional analysis revealed that NAIP played a critical role in inducing CTL sensitivity. Amplification of AR is a major mechanism of resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Here, we show that enzalutamide enhances sensitivity to immune-mediated killing of prostate tumor cells that overexpress AR. The immunomodulatory properties of enzalutamide and abiraterone provide a rationale for their use in combination with immunotherapeutic agents in CRPC, especially for patients with minimal response to enzalutamide or abiraterone alone, or for patients who have developed resistance to ADT.""","""['Andressa Ardiani', 'Sofia R Gameiro', 'Anna R Kwilas', 'Renee N Donahue', 'James W Hodge']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Downregulation of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Accelerates Progression to Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Niclosamide enhances abiraterone treatment via inhibition of androgen receptor variants in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Enzalutamide as a second generation antiandrogen for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Dying of Stress: Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, and Small-Molecule Inhibitors in Immunogenic Cell Death and Immunogenic Modulation.', 'Sex-specific Augmentation of Treatment Responses in Bladder Cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Tumor Stroma: Responsibility in Tumor Biology, Diagnosis and Treatment.', 'Sex-biased adaptive immune regulation in cancer development and therapy.', 'Immunotherapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer: Current Knowledge and Future Directions.']"""

Combining the IGF-1R inhibitor ganitumab (formerly AMG 479) with standard of care androgen-deprivation therapy greatly delays prostate cancer recurrence in xenograft models; however, a significant proportion of these tumors ultimately acquire resistance to ganitumab. Here we describe the development of a stable and reproducible ganitumab-resistant VCaP human prostate cancer cell derivative termed VCaP/GanR to investigate the mechanism of acquired resistance to IGF-1R inhibition. Unlike parental VCaP, VCaP/GanR did not undergo apoptosis following ganitumab treatment. VCaP/GanR did not express increased levels of IGF-1R, insulin receptor, or phospho-AKT compared to parental VCaP. VCaP/GanR exhibited increased levels of phospho-S6 indicative of increased mTOR activity. However, acquired resistance to ganitumab was not dependent on increased mTOR activity in VCaP/GanR. Phospho-proteomic arrays revealed alterations in several calcium-regulated signaling components in VCaP/GanR compared to VCaP. Reduction of intracellular calcium using cell-permeable calcium-specific chelators restored ganitumab sensitivity to VCaP/GanR through inhibition of cell-cycle progression. These data suggest a new mechanism of resistance to IGF-1R inhibition involving calcium-mediated proliferation effects.

Cancer stem cells are generally more resistant to conventional therapies thus requiring the characterization of key pathways involved in the formation and/or maintenance of this malignant cellular subpopulation. To this end, we identified Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β (GSK-3β) as a crucial kinase for the maintenance of prostate cancer stem/progenitor-like cells and pharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3β dramatically decreased the size of this cellular subpopulation. This was paralleled by impaired clonogenicity, decreased migratory potential and dramatic morphological changes. In line with our in vitro observations, treatment with a GSK-3β inhibitor leads to a complete loss of tumorigenicity and a decrease in metastatic potential in preclinical in vivo models. These observed anti-tumor effects appear to be largely Wnt-independent as simultaneous Wnt inhibition does not reverse the observed antitumor effects of GSK-3β blockage. We found that GSK-3β activity is linked to cytoskeletal protein F-actin and inhibition of GSK-3β leads to disturbance of F-actin polymerization. This may underlie the dramatic effects of GSK-3β inhibition on prostate cancer migration. Furthermore, GSK-3β inhibition led to strongly decreased expression of several integrin types including the cancer stem cell-associated α2β1 integrin.

As far as we know, this is a first report of salvage brachytherapy for seminal vesicle recurrence in Japan.  Case presentation:   A 70-year-old Japanese man with low-risk prostate cancer received low-dose-rate brachytherapy. Forty-two months after the seed implantation, he showed biochemical recurrence based on the nadir + 2 ng/mL definition. The prostate specific antigen (PSA) level was 5.11 ng/mL at 58 months after seed implantation. A saturation biopsy of the prostate showed no recurrence. Systemic screening also showed no distant metastases. However, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a low intensity area at the base of the right seminal vesicle, which was strongly suggestive of recurrence. Sixty months after the initial therapy, a seminal vesicle biopsy confirmed recurrence with a Gleason score of 4 + 3 before salvage brachytherapy was performed. The prescribed dose was 145 Gy, the same as the dose of the initial therapy. One month later, the PSA level had rapidly declined to 0.898 ng/mL without androgen deprivation therapy. Ten months after the salvage brachytherapy, the PSA level reached 0.078 ng/mL. No adverse events were seen during the follow-up period.

First-line treatment typically consists of reducing AR signaling by hormone depletion, but resistance inevitably develops over time. One way to overcome this issue is to block AR function via alternative means, preferably by inhibiting protein targets that are more active in tumors than in normal tissue. By staining prostate cancer tumor sections, elevated LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) expression and increased phosphorylation of its substrate Cofilin were found to be associated with poor outcome and reduced survival in patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. A LIMK-selective small molecule inhibitor (LIMKi) was used to determine whether targeted LIMK inhibition was a potential prostate cancer therapy. LIMKi reduced prostate cancer cell motility, as well as inhibiting proliferation and increasing apoptosis in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells more effectively than in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. LIMK inhibition blocked ligand-induced AR nuclear translocation, reduced AR protein stability and transcriptional activity, consistent with its effects on proliferation and survival acting via inhibition of AR activity. Furthermore, inhibition of LIMK activity increased αTubulin acetylation and decreased AR interactions with αTubulin, indicating that the role of LIMK in regulating microtubule dynamics contributes to AR function. These results indicate that LIMK inhibitors could be beneficial for the treatment of prostate cancer both by reducing nuclear AR translocation, leading to reduced proliferation and survival, and by inhibiting prostate cancer cell dissemination.""","""['Katerina Mardilovich', 'Mads Gabrielsen', 'Lynn McGarry', 'Clare Orange', 'Rachana Patel', 'Emma Shanks', 'Joanne Edwards', 'Michael F Olson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['LIM domain kinases as potential therapeutic targets for neurofibromatosis type 2.', 'Resveratrol regulates the PTEN/AKT pathway through androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Synergy of FLT3 inhibitors and the small molecule inhibitor of LIM kinase1/2 CEL_Amide in FLT3-ITD mutated Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) cells.', 'Structural Aspects of LIMK Regulation and Pharmacology.', 'Endocrine Disruptors and Prostate Cancer.', 'Cofilin Acts as a Booster for Progression of Malignant Tumors Represented by Glioma.', 'Comparative Analysis of Small-Molecule LIMK1/2 Inhibitors: Chemical Synthesis, Biochemistry, and Cellular Activity.', 'The microtubule cytoskeleton: An old validated target for novel therapeutic drugs.', 'Development and Characterization of Type I, Type II, and Type III LIM-Kinase Chemical Probes.', 'Inhibition of LIM kinase reduces contraction and proliferation in bladder smooth muscle.']"""

Here, genomic analysis of ERG siRNA-treated prostate cells harboring the endogenous TMPRSS2-ERG fusion revealed an inverse relationship between ERG and Annexin A2 (ANXA2) expression at both the RNA and protein level. ANXA2, a Ca(2+)-dependent and phospholipid-binding protein, is involved in various cellular functions, including maintenance of epithelial cell polarity. Mechanistic studies defined the prostate-specific transcription start site of ANXA2 and showed that the recruitment of ERG to the ANXA2 promoter is required for transcriptional repression by ERG. Knockdown of ERG enhanced the apical localization of ANXA2, the bundling of actin filaments at cell-cell junctions and formation of a polarized epithelial phenotype. ERG overexpression disrupted ANXA2-mediated cell polarity and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by inhibiting CDC42 and RHOA, and by activating cofilin. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a reciprocal relationship of ANXA2 and ERG expression in a large fraction of primary prostate cancer clinical specimens. ANXA2 was absent or markedly reduced in ERG(+) tumors, which were mostly well differentiated. ERG(-) tumors, meanwhile, expressed moderate to high levels of ANXA2, and were either poorly differentiated or displayed subsets of poorly differentiated cells. Taken together, the transcriptional repression of ANXA2 by ERG in prostate epithelial cells plays a critical role in abrogating differentiation, promoting EMT, and in the reciprocal correlation of ERG and ANXA2 expression observed in human prostate cancer.

Interventions have focussed on the promotion of earlier diagnosis in patients with potential cancer symptoms. However, to assess the effectiveness of these interventions, the time from symptom onset to presentation needs to be reliably and accurately measured. This qualitative study explored the use of calendar landmarking instruments in cancer symptom research.  Methods:   We performed a secondary analysis of transcripts of interviews using the calendar landmarking instrument, undertaken with patients who had either been diagnosed with cancer (n = 40, IRCO study, Western Australia), or who had symptoms suggestive of cancer (n = 38, SYMPTOM study, North East and Eastern England). We used constant comparison methods to identify use of the calendar landmarking instruments and the impact of their application.  Results:   The calendar landmarking instrument appeared to help many patients, either by acting as a prompt or helping to refine recall of events. A combination of personal (e.g. birthday) and national (e.g. Christmas) landmarks seemed to be the most effective. Calendar landmarking instruments appeared more useful where the time period between onset of symptoms and date of first consultation was less than three months. The interviewee's age, gender and cancer type did not appear to influence whether or not the instrument facilitated recall, and there were no instances where the use of the instrument resulted in the disclosure of a new first symptom. Symptoms of similar chronic conditions could create difficulties when applying the instrument; it was difficult for these participants to characterise and disentangle their symptoms which prompted their decisions to seek help. Some participants tended to prefer to use their own, already personalised, diaries to assist in their recall of events.  Conclusions:   This study is the first to describe the potential role of calendar landmarking instruments to support research interviews which explore symptoms and events along the cancer diagnostic pathway.

The aim of this study was to investigate how Shh and androgen [dihydrotestosterone (DHT)] signaling act in prostate epithelial and stromal compartments and whether this signaling pathway drives EMT and promotes PCa progression.  Material and methods:   LNCaP, normal prostate fibroblast (NPF) and cancer-associated prostate fibroblast (CPF) cells were studied with DHT and/or the Shh signaling inhibitor cyclopamine. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the expressions of a potential Shh target gene, osteonectin (ON) and EMT-associated markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin). Immunohistochemical studies using PCa prostatectomy samples were performed to assess the expression levels of ON, Gli-1, androgen receptor, Shh, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin.  Results:   While DHT enhanced cell proliferation in CPF more than LNCaP or NPF, cyclopamine inhibited cell proliferation enhanced by DHT in CPF. Real-time RT-PCR showed whereas both Shh and DHT induced N-cadherin and vimentin, DHT also induced the expression of osteonectin in LNCaP and cyclopamine blocked these expressions in osteonectin, N-cadherin and vimentin (p = 0.0084, 0.0002 and 0.0373, respectively).

Patients with TNBC carry an unfavorable prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes given that endocrine or HER2 targeted therapies are not effective, rendering chemotherapy the sole effective treatment option to date. Therefore, there is a high demand for additional novel treatment options.  Findings:   We previously published a list of genes showing both higher gene expression rates in TNBC and, in addition, are known to encode targets of non-oncologic drugs. SRD5A1, which encodes the type-1 isoform of the steroid-5alpha-reductase, which is involved in androgen metabolism, was found to be one of these genes. Dutasteride is a dual blocker of both the type-1 and type-2 isoform of SRD5A1 and is indicated in the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia. Treatment of TNBC cell lines with dutasteride was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, altered protein expression of VEGF and HIF-1α and increased chemosensitivity.

We hypothesized that the efficacy of inhibiting DHT ligand synthesis would associate with intra-tumoral androgen ratios indicative of relative dependence on DHT-mediated growth.  Methods:   We characterized two androgen-sensitive prostate cancer xenograft models after androgen suppression by castration in combination with the SRD5A inhibitor, dutasteride, as well as a panel of castration resistant metastases obtained via rapid autopsy.  Results:   In LuCaP35 tumors (intra-tumoral T:DHT ratio 2:1) dutasteride suppressed DHT to 0.02 ng/gm and prolonged survival vs. castration alone (337 vs.152 days, HR 2.8, p = 0.0015). In LuCaP96 tumors (T:DHT 10:1), survival was not improved despite similar DHT reduction (0.02 ng/gm). LuCaP35 demonstrated higher expression of steroid biosynthetic enzymes maintaining DHT levels (5-fold higher SRD5A1, 41 fold higher, 99-fold higher RL-HSD, p<0.0001 for both), reconstitution of intra-tumoral DHT (to ∼30% of untreated tumors), and ∼2 fold increased expression of full length AR. In contrast, LuCaP96 demonstrated higher levels of steroid catabolizing enzymes (6.9-fold higher AKR1C2, 3000-fold higher UGT2B15, p = 0.002 and p<0.0001 respectively), persistent suppression of intra-tumoral DHT, and 6-8 fold induction of full length AR and the ligand independent V7 AR splice variant. Human metastases demonstrated bio-active androgen levels and AR full length and AR splice-variant expression consistent with the range observed in xenografts.  Conclusions:   Intrinsic differences in basal steroidogenesis, as well as variable expression of full length and splice-variant AR, associate with response and resistance to pre-receptor AR ligand suppression.

Methods:   Prostate tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenised into a fine powder in a precooled stainless steel punch homogeniser. One aliquot of the powder was extracted directly, and a second aliquot was freeze-dried overnight and then extracted. The extracts were analysed by FEMTELLE assay to determine the concentrations of uPA and PAI-1. uPA/PAI-1 ratios were calculated for each sample, and the mean ratios for the frozen and the lyophilised tissue were compared.  Results:   The concentrations of uPA measured for the frozen and lyophilised samples are strongly correlated (R = 0.90 ± 0.05). The same applies to the PAI-1 measured (R = 0.89 ± 0.03).

The study included cases (n = 761 localized; n = 1199 advanced) and controls (n = 1139) from the multiethnic California Collaborative Case-Control Study of Prostate Cancer. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between tobacco smoking variables and risk of localized and advanced PCa risk. Being a former smoker, regardless of time of quit smoking, was associated with an increased risk of localized PCa (odds ratio [OR] = 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-1.6). Among non-Hispanic Whites, ever smoking was associated with an increased risk of localized PCa (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.1), whereas current smoking was associated with risk of advanced PCa (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.0-1.9). However, no associations were observed between smoking intensity, duration or pack-year variables, and advanced PCa. No statistically significant trends were seen among Hispanics or African-Americans. The relationship between smoking status and PCa risk was modified by the CYP1A2 rs7662551 polymorphism (P-interaction = 0.008). In conclusion, tobacco smoking was associated with risk of PCa, primarily localized disease among non-Hispanic Whites. This association was modified by a genetic variant in CYP1A2, thus supporting a role for tobacco carcinogens in PCa risk.""","""['Ahva Shahabi', 'Román Corral', 'Chelsea Catsburg', 'Amit D Joshi', 'Andre Kim', 'Juan Pablo Lewinger', 'Jocelyn Koo', 'Esther M John', 'Sue A Ingles', 'Mariana C Stern']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Red meat and poultry, cooking practices, genetic susceptibility and risk of prostate cancer: results from a multiethnic case-control study.', 'Polymorphisms in carcinogen metabolism enzymes, fish intake, and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Fish intake, cooking practices, and risk of prostate cancer: results from a multi-ethnic case-control study.', 'Association between NAT2, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2 genotypes, heterocyclic aromatic amines, and prostate cancer risk: a case control study in Japan.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of tobacco use and prostate cancer mortality and incidence in prospective cohort studies.', 'Polymorphisms in the gene encoding CYP1A2 influence prostate cancer risk and progression.', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.', 'Prostate cancer mortality in Brazil 1990-2019: geographical distribution and trends.', 'Food Habits, Lifestyle Factors, and Risk of Prostate Cancer in Central Argentina: A Case Control Study Involving Self-Motivated Health Behavior Modifications after Diagnosis.', 'Lack of association between polymorphisms in the CYP1A2 gene and risk of cancer: evidence from meta-analyses.']"""

Results suggested that subjects with TC/CC genotypes had significantly decreased risk of PCa compared with those with TT genotype (adjusted OR 0.68, 95 % CI 0.55-0.85). Further functional assays showed that the risk-associated T allele increased the protein-binding affinity and reduced the activity of the promoter compared with C allele.

A previous study defined two organic polymethine cyanine dyes as ideal NIRF probes, IR‑783 and its derivative MHI‑148, which have excellent optical characteristics, superior biocompatibility and cancer targeting abilities. To investigate the feasibility of NIRF dye‑mediated prostate cancer imaging, dye uptake and subcellular co‑localization were investigated in PC‑3, DU‑145 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells and RWPE‑1 normal prostate epithelial cells. Different organic anion transporting peptide (OATP) inhibitors were utilized to explore the potential role of the OATP subtype, including the nonspecific OATP inhibitor bromosulfophthalein, the OATP1 inhibitor 17β‑estradiol, the selective OATP1B1 inhibitor rifampicin and the selective OATP1B3 inhibitor cholecystokinin octapeptide. NIRF dyes were also used for the simulated detection of circulating tumor cells and the rapid detection of prostate cancer in human prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer xenografts in mouse models. The results revealed that the cancer‑specific uptake of these organic dyes in prostate cancer cells occurred primarily via OATP1B3. A strong NIRF signal was detected in prostate cancer tissues, but not in normal tissues that were stained with IR‑783. Prostate cancer cells were recognized with particular NIR fluorescence in isolated mononuclear cell mixtures.

Here, we developed a computational method based on the naïve Bayesian classifier method to identify cancer-related lncRNAs by integrating genome, regulome and transcriptome data, and identified 707 potential cancer-related lncRNAs. We demonstrated the performance of the method by ten-fold cross-validation, and found that integration of multi-omic data was necessary to identify cancer-related lncRNAs. We identified 707 potential cancer-related lncRNAs and our results showed that these lncRNAs tend to exhibit significant differential expression and differential DNA methylation in multiple cancer types, and prognosis effects in prostate cancer. We also found that these lncRNAs were more likely to be direct targets of TP53 family members than others. Moreover, based on 147 lncRNA knockdown data in mice, we validated that four of six mouse orthologous lncRNAs were significantly involved in many cancer-related processes, such as cell differentiation and the Wnt signaling pathway. Notably, one lncRNA, lnc-SNURF-1, which was found to be associated with TNF-mediated signaling pathways, was up-regulated in prostate cancer and the protein-coding genes affected by knockdown of the lncRNA were also significantly aberrant in prostate cancer patients, suggesting its probable importance in tumorigenesis. Taken together, our method underlines the power of integrating multi-omic data to uncover cancer-related lncRNAs.""","""['Tingting Zhao', 'Jinyuan Xu', 'Ling Liu', 'Jing Bai', 'Chaohan Xu', 'Yun Xiao', 'Xia Li', 'Liming Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Biosyst""","""['Long noncoding RNA in prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.', 'Construction of a lncRNA-PCG bipartite network and identification of cancer-related lncRNAs: a case study in prostate cancer.', 'Construction and analysis of lncRNA-lncRNA synergistic networks to reveal clinically relevant lncRNAs in cancer.', 'LncRNA ontology: inferring lncRNA functions based on chromatin states and expression patterns.', 'Involvement of lncRNA dysregulation in gastric cancer.', 'Association filtering and generative adversarial networks for predicting lncRNA-associated disease.', 'SCCPMD: Probability matrix decomposition method subject to corrected similarity constraints for inferring long non-coding RNA-disease associations.', 'Computational prediction of disease related lncRNAs using machine learning.', 'Identifying lncRNA-disease association based on GAT multiple-operator aggregation and inductive matrix completion.', 'Heterogeneous graph neural network for lncRNA-disease association prediction.']"""

The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti‑cancer effect of QH on prostate cancer cells. The results demonstrated that QH decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased antioxidant capacity in PC3 cells at various concentrations (2.5‑60 µg/ml) with peak inhibition and augmentation changes of 3.22‑ and 3.00‑fold, respectively. Following treatment with QH for 48 and 72 h, the IC50-values on PC3 cells were 19.7 and 12.4 µg/ml, respectively. Western blot analysis revealed that QH induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells via activation of caspase‑3 and cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase. In addition, QH significantly inhibited the invasion and migration of PC3 cells as well as reduced the expression of numerous prostate tumor‑associated microRNAs (miRs), including miR‑21, compared to that of untreated human prostate cancer cells. QH was also found to enhance the expression of tumor suppressor programmed cell death protein 4, which was negatively regulated by miR‑21. Furthermore, induced overexpression of miR‑21 using pre‑miR‑21 oligonucleotides attenuated the beneficial effect of QH on prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   The prostate-only clinical target volume (CTV2) and rectum were delineated on 1 pre-treatment CBCT each week in 18 randomly selected patients. By transposing these contours onto the original plan, dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for CTV2 and the rectum were each calculated and combined, for each patient, to produce a single mean DVH representative of the dose delivered over the treatment course. Plans were reoptimized using reduced CTV2 to PTV2 margins and the consequent radiobiological impact modelled by the tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of the rectum.  Results:   All CBCT images were deemed of sufficient quality to identify the CTV and rectum. No loss of TCP was observed when plans using the standard 5-mm CTV2 to PTV2 margin of the centre were reoptimized with a 4- or 3-mm margin. Margin reduction was associated with a significant decrease in rectal NTCP (5-4 mm; p < 0.05 and 5-3 mm; p < 0.01).  Conclusion:   Using daily online image guidance with CBCT, a reduction in CTV2 to PTV2 margins to 3 mm is achievable without compromising tumour control. The consequent sparing of surrounding normal tissues is associated with reduced anticipated rectal toxicity.  Advances in knowledge:   Margin reduction is feasible and potentially beneficial.

We investigated whether discontinuous biopsy involvement usually results from a large tumor focus or multiple small foci. Prostate needle biopsies with discontinuous tumor and corresponding whole-mounted radical prostatectomies from 2008 to 2013 were analyzed. Linear length and percentage of biopsy involvement were measured both including and subtracting the benign intervening tissue. The corresponding region of the prostatectomy specimen was evaluated for tumor size and multifocality.

In 9 patients, multiple small foci were present. Eleven patients could have been excluded from active surveillance eligibility by measuring tumor from end to end (>50% involvement), of whom only 1 met criteria for clinically insignificant cancer at prostatectomy.

Where significant stimulation was found, the influence of an antagonist was also investigated.  Results:   Neither growth nor motility of endothelial cells was affected by either agonist. In DU145 cells, while the B2R agonist was without any significant effect, the B1R agonist stimulated proliferation and migration at concentrations of 10nM and 50nM respectively. Further, this effect was abrogated when cells were pre-incubated with a B1R antagonist.  Conclusions:   Unlike the physiologically-active B2R, the pathologically-inducible B1R may be implicated in prostate tumourigenic events.

However, these associations may be explained by detection bias caused by SNPs influencing PSA concentration. Thus, in a simulation study, we quantified the extent of bias in the association between a SNP and prostate cancer when the SNP influences PSA concentration.  Methods:   We generated 2,000 replicate cohorts of 20,000 men using real-world estimates of prostate cancer risk, prevalence of carrying ≥1 minor allele, PSA concentration, and the influence of a SNP on PSA concentration. We modeled risk ratios (RR) of 1.00, 1.25, and 1.50 for the association between carrying ≥1 minor allele and prostate cancer. We calculated mean betas from the replicate cohorts and quantified bias under each scenario.  Results:   Assuming no association between a SNP and prostate cancer, the estimated mean bias in betas ranged from 0.02 to 0.10 for ln PSA being 0.05 to 0.20 ng/mL higher in minor allele carriers; the mean biased RRs ranged from 1.03 to 1.11. Assuming true RRs = 1.25 and 1.50, the biased RRs were as large as 1.39 and 1.67, respectively.  Conclusion:   Estimates of the association between SNPs and prostate cancer can be biased to the magnitude observed in published GWAS, possibly resulting in type I error.

VT-464 demonstrated a greater decrease in AR transactivation compared with ABI in C4-2 and both ENZ-resistant cell lines. At the gene and protein level, VT-464 suppressed the AR axis to a greater extent compared with ABI.

Finally, an AR-antagonist effect of VT-464 independent of CYP17A1 inhibition was observed using luciferase reporter assays, and a direct interaction was confirmed using an AR ligand binding domain biolayer interferometry.

The consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been associated with a lower risk of certain types of cancer including prostate cancer, although the precise mechanisms of this effect are poorly understood. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFAs could modify IL-18BP production by prostate cancer cells by altering IFN-γ receptor-mediated signal transduction. Here, we demonstrate that n-3 PUFA treatment significantly reduced IFN-γ-induced IL-18BP production by DU-145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells by inhibiting IL-18BP mRNA expression and was associated with a reduction in IFN-γ receptor expression. Furthermore, IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), and P38 were suppressed by n-3 PUFA treatment. By contrast, n-6 PUFA had no effect on IFN-γ receptor expression, but decreased IFN-γ-induced IL-18BP production and IFN-γ stimulation of JAK1, STAT1, ERK1/2, and JNK phosphorylation. These data indicate that both n-3 and n-6 PUFAs may be beneficial in prostate cancer by altering IFN-γ signaling, thus inhibiting IL-18BP production and thereby rendering prostate cancer cells more sensitive to IL-18-mediated immune responses.""","""['Xiaofeng Wang', 'Andrew Breeze', 'Marianna Kulka']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids impair in vivo interferon- gamma responsiveness via diminished receptor signaling.', 'Down-regulation of neu/HER-2 by interferon-gamma in prostate cancer cells.', 'IFN-gamma-induced BACE1 expression is mediated by activation of JAK2 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and direct binding of STAT1 to BACE1 promoter in astrocytes.', 'Interleukin 18 and interleukin 18 binding protein: possible role in immunosuppression of chronic renal failure.', 'Interleukin-18 and IL-18BP in inflammatory dermatological diseases.', 'Role of Interleukin-1 family in bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Alpha-Linolenic Acid Modulates T Cell Incorporation in a 3D Tissue-Engineered Psoriatic Skin Model.', 'Disrupted Lipid Raft Shuttling of FcεRI by n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Is Associated With Ligation of G Protein-Coupled Receptor 120 (GPR120) in Human Mast Cell Line LAD2.', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids of Both the Omega-3 and the Omega-6 Family Abrogate the Cytokine-Induced Upregulation of miR-29a-3p by Endothelial Cells.', 'Expression of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase Induced by IFN-γ and TNF-α as Potential Biomarker of Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Thus, these compounds are employed as targeting moieties to selectively deliver chemotherapeutic agents to cancer cells. GnRH-III, the decapeptide isolated from the sea lamprey brain, has lower potency than GnRH in stimulating gonadotropin secretion, but it exerts antiproliferative effects on many tumors expressing the GnRH-R. GnRH-III-based peptides are considered promising targeting moieties for the preparation of anticancer drug delivery systems. These studies were aimed at i) evaluating the antitumor activity of two cytotoxic oxime bond-linked daunorubicin (Dau)-GnRH-III derivative bioconjugates (Dau-GnRH-III, in which daunorubicin was coupled to the 8Lys in the native form of GnRH-III, and Dau-[4Lys(Ac)]-GnRH-III, in which daunorubicin was attached to the 8Lys of a GnRH-III derivative where 4Ser was replaced by an acetylated lysine) on CRPC cells; and ii) to elucidate the involvement of the classical GnRH-R (type I GnRH-R) in this antitumor activity. Our results demonstrated that both Dau-GnRH-III and Dau-[4Lys(Ac)]-GnRH-III were rapidly internalized into DU145 prostate cancer cells and exerted a significant cytostatic effect. Both bioconjugates increased the levels of the active form of caspase-3, indicating the involvement of apoptosis in their antitumor activity. The antiproliferative effect of both Dau-GnRH-III and Dau-[4Lys(Ac)]-GnRH-III was counteracted by the simultaneous treatment of the cells with Antide, an antagonist of the GnRH-R. Moreover, after silencing the type I GnRH-R the antitumor activity of both bioconjugates was completely abolished. These data demonstrate that in CRPC cells, daunorubicin-GnRH-III derivative bioconjugates: i) inhibit tumor cell proliferation, by triggering the apoptosis process; ii) exert their antitumor effect through the activation of the type I GnRH-R expressed on these cells.

The results revealed that miR-429 was significantly upregulated in the human prostate cancer cell lines, compared with the normal prostate epithelial tissue. Downregulation of miR-429 expression in IF11 and IA8 cells inhibited cell proliferation and arrested the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The luciferase assay demonstrated that p27Kip1 was a direct target of miR-429. Furthermore, overexpression of p27Kip1 was observed to partially rescue the proliferation‑promoting effect of miR-429 on IA8 cells.

By inhibition of glycolysis and fatty acid synthase (FAS), the key enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, we confirmed the deuterium labeled lipids in cancer cells were from de novo lipid synthesis.

To further analyze the consequences of hypoxic upregulation on stem cell proliferation and HIF1α signaling, CSC subpopulations from murine TRAMP-C1 cells (Sca-1(+)/CD49f(+)) as well as from a human prostate cancer cell line (CD44(+)/CD49f(+)) were isolated and characterized. HIF1α levels and HIF target gene expression were elevated in hypoxic CSC-like cells, and upregulation of AKT occurred through a mechanism involving an mTOR/S6K/IRS-1 feedback loop. Interestingly, resistance of prostate CSCs to selective mTOR inhibitors was observed because of HIF1α upregulation. Thus, prostate CSCs show a hypoxic deactivation of a feedback inhibition of AKT signaling through IRS-1. In light of these results, we propose that deregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway through HIF1α is critical for CSC quiescence and maintenance by attenuating CSC metabolism and growth via mTOR and promoting survival by AKT signaling.

In this context, firstly, Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was activated by using SB216763 which is a glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) β inhibitor. Cell proliferation levels in bladder cancer cells, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer cells treated with GSK3β inhibitor (SB216763) were detected by WST-1 reagent. WIF-1 gene methylation profile was determined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP); expression levels of target genes β-catenin and WIF-1 by real-time PCR; and protein levels of β-catenin, DNMT1, pGSK3β(Ser9), HAUSP, and UHRF1 by Western Blot. Our results indicated that treatment with SB216763 caused an increased cell proliferation at low dose. mRNA levels of β-catenin increased after treatment with SB216273 and protein levels of pGSK3β(Ser9), β-catenin, and DNMT1 increased in comparison to control. HAUSP and UHRF1 were either up-regulated or down-regulated at the same doses depending on the type of cancer. Also, we showed that protein levels of DNMT1, β-catenin, HAUSP, and UHRF1 decreased after re-expression of WIF-1 following treatment with DAC. In Caki-2 cells, β-catenin pathway might have accounted for the stability of DNMT1 expression, whereas such relation is not valid for T24 and PC3 cells.

Therefore, we investigated the differences of S100A8/A9 expression between prostate cancer (CaP) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, and we evaluated the possibilities of urinary nucleic acids of S100A8/A9 as diagnostic and prognostic markers.  Methods:   Tissues from 132 CaP patients who underwent prostatectomy or transurethral resection and 90 BPH patients who underwent transurethral prostatectomy were assessed.sd In addition, S100A8 and S100A9 nucleic acid levels were measured in the urine of 283 CaP patients and 363 BPH controls.  Results:   S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA levels were lower in CaP than BPH tissues (P < 0.001). S100A8 and S100A9 expression was increased in cancer tissues with poorer prognosis. In 69 specimens from prostatectomy patients, S100A8/A9 were the independent predictor of biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio 5.22, 95 % confidence interval 1.800-15.155, P = 0.002). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that BPH tissues stained more strongly for both S100A8 and S100A9 than CaP tissues (P < 0.001).

Tumor-specific cell free DNA (cfDNA) present in serum and plasma provides a real-time, easily accessible surrogate.  Methods:   DNA was extracted from serum of 204 patients with prostate cancer (Gleason score 2-10), 207 male controls, and patients with benign hyperplasia (n = 10) and prostatitis (n = 10). DNA was amplified by use of random primers, tagged with molecular identifiers, sequenced on a SOLID system, and aligned to the human genome. We evaluated the number of sequence reads of cfDNA in sliding 100-kbp intervals for variation from controls. We used chromosomal regions with significant variations in alignment hits for their ability to segregate patients and matched controls.  Results:   Using ROC curves to assess diagnostic performance, we evaluated the number of regions in a first subset (n = 177), with variations in alignment hits alone, provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 (95% CI 0.7-0.9, P < 0.001). Using 5 rounds of 10-fold cross-validation with the full data set, we established a final model that discriminated prostate cancer from controls with an AUC of 0.92 (0.87-0.95), reaching a diagnostic accuracy of 83%. Both benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatitis could be distinguished from prostate cancer by use of cfDNA, with an accuracy of 90%.

The quality of spectral fitting of the (choline + creatine)/citrate ([Cho + Cr]/Cit) ratio at different field strengths and different coils is important for quantitative/semi-quantitative diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Purpose:   To evaluate the quality of spectral fitting of the (Cho + Cr)/Cit ratio of a prostate phantom using MRSI at different field strengths and various coils.  Material and methods:   Experiments were using 1.5-T and 3.0-T MR systems. Measurements were taken on a homemade prostate phantom with different coils: spinal array; abdominal array; and endorectal. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of choline, creatine, and citrate peaks as well as the (Cho + Cr)/Cit ratio in each voxel were compared among groups using multi-way analysis of variance.  Results:   Magnetic field strength, coils, and plane position had a significant effect on the SNR or (Cho + Cr)/Cit ratio, and there were interactions among groups (all P = 0.000). The 1.5-T (0.228 ± 0.044) exhibited a higher (Cho + Cr)/Cit ratio than the 3.0-T (0.125 ± 0.041) magnetic field strength (F = 3238, P = 0.000). The (Cho + Cr)/Cit ratio of both surface coils (0.183 ± 0.065) and all coils (0.181 ± 0.057) was significantly lower than that of the endorectal coil (0.195 ± 0.077) (both P < 0.05), but significant differences in the mean (Cho + Cr)/Cit ratio were not observed if surface coils and all coils were used (P > 0.05). No significant differences were found among the (Cho + Cr)/Cit ratios of all voxels in the middle planes by the post-hoc analyses (all P > 0.05).  Conclusion:   Three-dimensional proton MRSI of prostate metabolites in a phantom using surface coils is feasible and reliable, but (Cho + Cr)/Cit ratios acquired at different magnetic fields and coils were different. This difference should be taken into account when calculating this ratio in a field strength-independent way.""","""['Chao Ma', 'Luguang Chen', 'Tom W J Scheenen', 'Jianping Lu', 'Jian Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Acta Radiol""","""['1H-MRSI of prostate cancer: the relationship between metabolite ratio and tumor proliferation.', 'Transition zone prostate cancer: metabolic characteristics at 1H MR spectroscopic imaging--initial results.', 'In vivo assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness using magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at 3 T with an endorectal coil.', 'Metabolite ratios in 1H MR spectroscopic imaging of the prostate.', 'Theory and application of array coils in MR spectroscopy.', 'Doctor, a patient is on the phone asking about the endorectal coil!', 'A High-Fidelity Phantom for the Simulation and Quantitative Evaluation of Transurethral Resection of the Prostate.']"""

These nanoparticles are often surface-coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to improve their biodistribution. Until now, the effects of varying PEG surface density have been studied in a narrow and low range. Here, the effects of high and a broad range of PEG surface densities on the in vivo performance of lipid-based nanoparticles were studied.  Methods:   Oil-in-water nanoemulsions were prepared with PEG surface densities of 5-50 mol%. Confocal microscopy was used to assess intracellular disintegration in vitro. In vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in tumor bearing mice were studied using a small animal optical imager.  Results:   PEG surface density did not affect intracellular nanoemulsion stability. Surprisingly, circulation half-lives decreased with increasing PEG surface density. A plausible explanation was that nanoemulsion with high (50 mol%) PEG surface density activated the complement in a whole blood assay, whereas nanoemulsion with low (5 mol%) PEG density did not. In vivo, nanoemulsion with low PEG surface density was mostly confined to the tumor and organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system, whereas nanoemulsion with high PEG density accumulated throughout the mouse.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the association between race and treatment regret and to determine whether there was an interaction between race and sexual problems after treatment with regards to treatment regret.  Results:   Black men (N=78) were significantly more likely to have treatment regret when compared with non-black men (N=406; 21.8% versus 12.6%) on univariable analysis (odds ratio (OR) 1.94; 95% confidence interval 1.05-3.56; P=0.03). On multivariable analysis, black race trended towards but was no longer significantly associated with an increase in treatment regret (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.84 (0.95-3.58); P=0.071). There was an interaction between race and sexual problems after treatment (Pinteraction=0.02) such that among those without sexual problems, black men had more treatment regret than non-black men (26.7% versus 8.4%: AOR 4.68 (1.73-12.63); P=0.002), whereas among those with sexual problems, there was no difference in treatment regret between black and non-black men (18.8% versus 17.3%: AOR 1.04 (0.44-2.46); P=0.93).

To this end, we mimicked typical human prostate infection with retrograde urethral instillation of CP1, a human prostatic isolate of Escherichia coli. CP1 bacteria were tropic for the accessory sex glands and induced acute inflammation in the prostate and seminal vesicles, with chronic inflammation lasting at least 1 year. Compared to controls, infection induced both acute and chronic inflammation with epithelial hyperplasia, stromal hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltrates. In areas of inflammation, epithelial proliferation and hyperplasia often persist, despite decreased expression of androgen receptor (AR). Inflammatory cells in the prostates of CP1-infected mice were characterized at 8 weeks post-infection by flow cytometry, which showed an increase in macrophages and lymphocytes, particularly Th17 cells. Inflammation was additionally assessed in the context of carcinogenesis. Multiplex cytokine profiles of inflamed prostates showed that distinct inflammatory cytokines were expressed during prostate inflammation and cancer, with a subset of cytokines synergistically increased during concurrent inflammation and cancer. Furthermore, CP1 infection in the Hi-Myc mouse model of prostate cancer accelerated the development of invasive prostate adenocarcinoma, with 70% more mice developing cancer by 4.5 months of age.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) has been reported to be associated with arterial and venous thrombosis and mortality in several diseases. Here, we analyzed the association between RDW and other red blood cell (RBC) parameters with risk of VTE and mortality in patients with cancer.  Methods:   RBC parameters were measured in 1840 patients with cancers of the brain, breast, lung, stomach, colon, pancreas, prostate, kidney; lymphoma, multiple myeloma and other tumor sites, that were included in the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS), which is an ongoing prospective, observational cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed or progressive cancer after remission. Primary study outcome is occurrence of symptomatic VTE and secondary outcome is death during a maximum follow-up of 2 years.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 706 days, 131 (7.1%) patients developed VTE and 702 (38.2%) died. High RDW (>16%) was not associated with a higher risk of VTE in the total study cohort; in competing risk analysis accounting for death as competing variable the univariable subhazard ratio (SHR) was 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80-2.23, p = 0.269). There was also no significant association between other RBC parameters and risk of VTE. High RDW was associated with an increased risk of mortality in the total study population (hazard ratio [HR, 95% CI]: 1.72 [1.39-2.12], p<0.001), and this association prevailed after adjustment for age, sex, hemoglobin, leukocyte and platelet count (HR [95% CI]: 1.34 [1.06-1.70], p = 0.016).  Conclusions:   RDW and other RBC parameters were not independently associated with risk of VTE in patients with cancer and might therefore not be of added value for estimating risk of VTE in patients with cancer. We could confirm that high RDW is an independent predictor of poor overall survival in cancer.""","""['Julia Riedl', 'Florian Posch', 'Oliver Königsbrügge', 'Felix Lötsch', 'Eva-Maria Reitter', 'Ernst Eigenbauer', 'Christine Marosi', 'Ilse Schwarzinger', 'Christoph Zielinski', 'Ingrid Pabinger', 'Cihan Ay']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Red cell distribution width is associated with incident venous thromboembolism (VTE) and case-fatality after VTE in a general population.', 'Soluble Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (sVEGF) and the Risk of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Cancer: Results from the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS).', 'Association between red cell distribution width and risk of venous thromboembolism.', 'Risk factors for venous thromboembolism in cancer: novel findings from the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS).', 'A narrative review of red blood cell distribution width as a marker for pulmonary embolism.', 'Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism in Patients with Metastatic Lung Cancer.', 'Association between peripheral blood cytopenia and cancer mortality: A race-specific risk factor for cancer death.', 'Association Between Red Blood Cell Indices and Preoperative Deep Vein Thrombosis in Patients Undergoing Total Joint Arthroplasty: A Retrospective Study.', 'Prevalence of venous thromboembolism risk factors in hospitalized patients at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu Nigeria.', 'A New Online Dynamic Nomogram: Construction and Validation of an Assistant Decision-Making Model for Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.']"""

Although the effects of FLU treatment on several cancer types through many mechanisms have been identified, its relationship with unfolded protein response and apoptosis has not been clearly understood. In this recent study, we aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effect of Fluvastatin on MCF-7 cells and define the transcriptional regulation of specific genes during the occurrence of this cytotoxic effect. We administered 0.62, 2.5, 5, and 40 μM FLU on MCF-7 cells singly and in combination with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), and we monitored cell viability and proliferation for 48 hours using real-time cell analyzer system (xCELLigence). At the same time, we measured the mRNA expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, homologous protein (CHOP), caveolin-1 (CAV1), NDRG1 Variant 1 and Variant 2, HMOX1, SGK1, and prostate apoptosis response-4 (PAR4) genes using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (LightCycler 480 II). We accepted GAPDH gene and control groups as the reference gene and calibrator, respectively. We performed relative gene expression analyses of the study groups using the QIAGEN 2009 Relative Expression Software Tool (REST). FLU revealed an antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cells, while causing the transcriptional regulation of many genes. Of these genes, the mRNA expressions of CHOP, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) V1, and NDRG1 V2 increased. On the other hand, the mRNA expression levels of SGK1 and CAV1 decreased.

Materials and methods:   Bioluminescent human prostate tumor xenografts were established by subcutaneous implantation into male mice. Tumors were irradiated with uniform or non-uniform field configurations using conventional in vivo irradiation procedures performed using a 225 kVp generator with custom lead shielding. Tumor responses were measured using Vernier calipers and by BLI using an in vivo imaging system. Survival was defined as the time to quadroupling of pre-treatment tumor volume.  Results:   The correlation between BLI and tumor volume measurements was found to be different for un-irradiated (R = 0.61), uniformly irradiated (R = 0.34) and partially irradiated (R = 0.30) tumors. Uniformly irradiated tumors resulted in an average tumor growth delay of 60 days with median survival of 75 days, compared to partially irradiated tumors which showed an average growth delay of 24 days and median survival of 38 days.  Conclusions:   Correlation between BLI and tumor volume measurements is lower for partially irradiated tumors than those exposed to uniform dose distributions. The response of partially irradiated tumors suggests non-uniformity in response beyond physical dose distribution within the target volume. Dosimetric uncertainty associated with conventional in vivo irradiation procedures prohibits their ability to accurately determine tumor response to non-uniform radiation fields and stresses the need for image guided small animal radiation research platforms.""","""['Karl T Butterworth', 'Kelly M Redmond', 'Stephen J McMahon', 'Aidan J Cole', 'Suneil Jain', 'Helen O McCarthy', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Alan R Hounsell', 'Kevin M Prise']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['Longitudinal measurement of subcutaneous and intratibial human prostate cancer xenograft growth and response to ionizing radiation by plasma Alu and LINE-1 ctDNA: A comparison to standard methods.', 'Irradiation enhances the metastatic potential of prostatic small cell carcinoma xenografts.', 'Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) to improve and refine traditional murine models of tumor growth and metastasis.', 'In vivo bioluminescence imaging.', 'Bioluminescence imaging in vivo - application to cancer research.', 'Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells promote prostate cancer cell stemness via cell-cell contact to activate the Jagged1/Notch1 pathway.', 'Evaluation of On- and Off-Line Bioluminescence Tomography System for Focal Irradiation Guidance.', 'Modelling responses to spatially fractionated radiation fields using preclinical image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Bioluminescence Tomography-Guided Radiation Therapy for Preclinical Research.']"""

Patients and methods:   Of 2358 patients receiving EBRT for prostate cancer between 1988 and 2005, 2156 had chart-recorded smoking histories. Patients were classified as 'never smokers', 'current smokers', 'former smokers', and 'current smoking unknown'. Variables considered included quantity of tobacco use in pack-years, duration of smoking, and, for former smokers, how long before initiation of RT the patient quit smoking, when available. The median EBRT dose was 8100 Gy and the median follow-up was 95 months. Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.  Results:   Current smoking significantly increased the risks of both prostate-specific antigen relapse [hazard ratio (HR) 1.4, P = 0.02] and distant metastases (HR 2.37, P < 0.001), as well as prostate cancer-specific death (HR 2.25, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that smoking was also associated with increased risk of EBRT-related genitourinary toxicities (current smoker, HR 1.8, P = 0.02; former smoker, HR 1.45, P = 0.01). Smoking did not increase gastrointestinal toxicity.  Conclusions:   Current smokers with prostate cancer are at increased risk of biochemical recurrence, distant metastasis, and prostate cancer-related mortality after definitive RT to the prostate. Current and former smokers, regardless of duration and quantity of exposure, are at an increased risk of long-term genitourinary toxicity after EBRT.
