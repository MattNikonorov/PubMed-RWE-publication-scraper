We have previously demonstrated that progranulin acts as an autocrine growth factor and stimulates motility, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, supporting the hypothesis that progranulin may play a critical role in prostate cancer progression. However, the mechanisms regulating progranulin action in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells have not been characterized. Sortilin, a single-pass type I transmembrane protein of the vacuolar protein sorting 10 family, binds progranulin in neurons and negatively regulates progranulin signaling by mediating progranulin targeting for lysosomal degradation. However, whether sortilin is expressed in prostate cancer cells and plays any role in regulating progranulin action has not been established. Here, we show that sortilin is expressed at very low levels in castration-resistant PC3 and DU145 cells. Significantly, enhancing sortilin expression in PC3 and DU145 cells severely diminishes progranulin levels and inhibits motility, invasion, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth. In addition, sortilin overexpression negatively modulates Akt (protein kinase B, PKB) stability. These results are recapitulated by depleting endogenous progranulin in PC3 and DU145 cells. On the contrary, targeting sortilin by short hairpin RNA approaches enhances progranulin levels and promotes motility, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. We dissected the mechanisms of sortilin action and demonstrated that sortilin promotes progranulin endocytosis through a clathrin-dependent pathway, sorting into early endosomes and subsequent lysosomal degradation. Collectively, these results point out a critical role for sortilin in regulating progranulin action in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, suggesting that sortilin loss may contribute to prostate cancer progression.""","""['Ryuta Tanimoto', 'Alaide Morcavallo', 'Mario Terracciano', 'Shi-Qiong Xu', 'Manuela Stefanello', 'Simone Buraschi', 'Kuojung G Lu', 'Demetrius H Bagley', 'Leonard G Gomella', 'Katia Scotlandi', 'Antonino Belfiore', 'Renato V Iozzo', 'Andrea Morrione']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['The perlecan-interacting growth factor progranulin regulates ubiquitination, sorting, and lysosomal degradation of sortilin.', 'Sortilin inhibition limits secretion-induced progranulin-dependent breast cancer progression and cancer stem cell expansion.', 'C-terminus of progranulin interacts with the beta-propeller region of sortilin to regulate progranulin trafficking.', 'Potential mechanisms of progranulin-deficient FTLD.', 'Mechanisms of Progranulin Action and Regulation in Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Progranulin and EGFR modulate receptor-like tyrosine kinase sorting and stability in mesothelioma cells.', 'Progranulin Oncogenic Network in Solid Tumors.', 'Complexity of progranulin mechanisms of action in mesothelioma.', 'Combined miR-486 and GP88 (Progranulin) Serum Levels Are Suggested as Supportive Biomarkers for Therapy Decision in Elderly Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Against Sortilin Induces Apoptosis in Human Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

In some settings, the experimental treatment is only expected to affect the deaths caused by the disease, and the proportion of deaths caused by the disease is relatively low. In these settings, the ability to assess treatment-effect differences between Kaplan-Meier survival curves can be hampered by the large proportion of deaths in both arms that are unrelated to the disease. To address this problem, frequently displayed are cause-specific survival curves or cumulative incidence curves, which respectively censor and immortalize events (deaths) not caused by the disease. However, the differences between the experimental and control treatment arms for these curves overestimate the difference between the overall survival curves for the treatment arms and thus could result in overestimation of the benefit of the experimental treatment for the patients. To address this issue, we propose new estimators of overall survival for the treatment arms that are appropriate when the treatment does not affect the non-disease-related deaths. These new estimators give a more precise estimate of the treatment benefit, potentially enabling future patients to make a more informed decision concerning treatment choice. We also consider the case where an exponential assumption allows the simple presentation of mortality rates as the outcome measures. Applications are given for estimating overall survival in a prostate-cancer treatment randomized clinical trial, and for estimating the overall mortality rates in a prostate-cancer screening trial.""","""['Edward L Korn', 'James J Dignam', 'Boris Freidlin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Overestimation of prostate cancer mortality and other-cause mortality by the Kaplan-Meier method.', 'Screening for Cervical Cancer With High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Testing: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Long-term Results of Active Surveillance in the Göteborg Randomized, Population-based Prostate Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Early versus deferred androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer.']"""

One of its advantages is its ability to account for the within-study and between-study correlations. However, the standard inference procedures, such as the maximum likelihood or maximum restricted likelihood inference, require the within-study correlations, which are usually unavailable. In addition, the standard inference procedures suffer from the problem of singular estimated covariance matrix. In this paper, we propose a pseudolikelihood method to overcome the aforementioned problems. The pseudolikelihood method does not require within-study correlations and is not prone to singular covariance matrix problem. In addition, it can properly estimate the covariance between pooled estimates for different outcomes, which enables valid inference on functions of pooled estimates, and can be applied to meta-analysis where some studies have outcomes missing completely at random. Simulation studies show that the pseudolikelihood method provides unbiased estimates for functions of pooled estimates, well-estimated standard errors, and confidence intervals with good coverage probability. Furthermore, the pseudolikelihood method is found to maintain high relative efficiency compared to that of the standard inferences with known within-study correlations. We illustrate the proposed method through three meta-analyses for comparison of prostate cancer treatment, for the association between paraoxonase 1 activities and coronary heart disease, and for the association between homocysteine level and coronary heart disease.""","""['Yong Chen', 'Chuan Hong', 'Richard D Riley']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Inference for correlated effect sizes using multiple univariate meta-analyses.', 'An improved method for bivariate meta-analysis when within-study correlations are unknown.', 'Permutation inference methods for multivariate meta-analysis.', 'An Empirical Assessment of Bivariate Methods for Meta-Analysis of Test Accuracy Internet.', 'Empirical and Simulation-Based Comparison of Univariate and Multivariate Meta-Analysis for Binary Outcomes Internet.', 'Computing within-study covariances, data visualization, and missing data solutions for multivariate meta-analysis with metavcov.', 'Testing small study effects in multivariate meta-analysis.', 'Random-effects meta-analysis of combined outcomes based on reconstructions of individual patient data.', 'The Galaxy Plot: A New Visualization Tool for Bivariate Meta-Analysis Studies.', 'Using simulation studies to evaluate statistical methods.']"""

The consequences of close and long-standing follow-up with regard to outpatient visits, tests and repeated biopsies are widely unknown. This study investigated the trajectory and costs of AS in patients with localized PCa.  Materials and methods:   In total, 317 PCa patients were followed in a prospective, single-arm AS cohort. The primary outcomes were number of patient contacts, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests, biopsies, hospital admissions due to biopsy complications and patients eventually undergoing curative treatment. The secondary outcome was cost.  Results:   The 5 year cumulative incidence of discontinued AS in a competing-risk model was 40%. During the first 5 years of AS patients underwent a median of two biopsy sets, and patients were seen in an outpatient clinic including PSA testing three to four times annually. In total, 38 of the 406 biopsy sessions led to hospital admission and 87 of the 317 patients required treatment for bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). With a median of 3.7 years' follow-up, the total cost of AS was euro (€) 1,240,286. Assuming all patients had otherwise undergone primary radical prostatectomy, the cost difference favoured AS with a net benefit of €662,661 (35% reduction).  Conclusions:   AS entails a close clinical follow-up with a considerable risk of rebiopsy complication, treatment of BOO and subsequent delayed definitive therapy.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of miRNA-200c (miR-200c) on the biological behavior and mechanism of proliferation, migration, and invasion in the prostate cancer cell line Du145. In this study, Du145 cells were transfected with miR-200c mimics or negative control miR-NC by using an X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent. The relative expression of miR-200c was measured by RT-PCR. The proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of Du145 cells were detected by CCK8 assays, migration assays and invasion assays, respectively. The expressions of ZEB1, E-cadherin, and vimentin were observed by western blot. Results showed that DU145 cells exhibited a high expression of miR-200c compared with immortalized normal prostate epithelial cell RWPE-1.

Therefore, further studies about the protests of disease, diagnosis and timely treatment are essential.  Study method:   In this study, 80 prostate cancer patients admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital, Urmia in Iran from 2000 to 2008 were reviewed. Patients were studied according to their age, clinical protests, Gleason scoring, positive family history, smoking, type of treatment and post-treatment conditions. Questionnaires were adjusted based on the objectives and the data were extracted from the medical records of patients and the desired results were achieved.  Results:   In this study, the most common age group for prostate cancer is older than 60 years (92/5%). The most common type of pathology for prostate cancer is adenocarcinoma that 93.75% of cases are included. Secondary TCC with secondary source is present in 5% and sarcoma in 1.25% of cases. 46.25% of patients with prostate cancer are smokers. The most common clinical symptoms among patients are obstructive symptoms (56.25%), and irritation of the urinary tract (52.81%). Hematuria in 26.25% and urinary incontinence in 5% of cases have been recorded. 16.3% of patients referred with metastatic symptoms. Most patients with prostate cancer have Gleason score 5-7 (40%). All patients were undergoing prostatectomy (82.5% TURP and 17.5% SPP) and 47.5% of cases were bilateral orchiectomy. The cases reviewed, 22 were followed that included 27.5% of cases. Among them, 6 people have died due prostate cancer (27.27%) that the mean age of the patients after diagnosis until death was 34.4 months. 2 others died from other causes (9.09%). The remaining 14 cases were elder patients with a mean follow-up duration of 44 months.  Conclusion:   According to the results obtained in the present study, the most common type of prostate cancer pathology is adenocarcinoma that is included 93.75% of cases. Prostate sarcoma is present at 1.25% and secondary bladder TCC at 5% of cases more over the incidence of prostate sarcoma is reported in a lower age group than adenocarcinoma, which the results obtained in a similar study in Iran in other centers.

This is the first randomized study comparing an open surgery procedure (radical prostatectomy) with a combination of high-dose rate brachytherapy (2×10 Gy) and external beam radiotherapy (25×2 Gy) in PC patients in Sweden 1996-2001. The two randomization arms were compared regarding differences in patients-reported outcomes, such as complications and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).  Material and methods:   The patients had localized/locally advanced PC, clinical category T1b-T3a, N0, M0 and PSA≤50 ng/ml. All underwent total androgen blockade (six months). Self-reported HRQoL and symptoms including urinary, bowel, and sexual side effects were investigated prospectively before randomization and 12 and 24 months after randomization. A total of 89 patients were randomized and completed the EORTC QLQ C-33 and EORTC PR-25 questionnaires.  Results:   Over the study period, there were no discernible differences in HRQoL, or complications between the two groups. Emotional functioning, however, improved statistically significantly over time, whereas Social functioning decreased, and financial difficulties increased. No statistically significant differences in group-by-time interactions were found. The survival rate was 76%. Only eight patients (9%) died of PC.

To achieve this, however, requires sensors capable of detecting (with high reproducibility) biomarkers at concentrations one million times lower than the concentration of the other blood proteins. Here, we show that a sandwich assay that combines mechanical and optoplasmonic transduction can detect cancer biomarkers in serum at ultralow concentrations. A biomarker is first recognized by a surface-anchored antibody and then by an antibody in solution that identifies a free region of the captured biomarker. This second antibody is tethered to a gold nanoparticle that acts as a mass and plasmonic label; the two signatures are detected by means of a silicon cantilever that serves as a mechanical resonator for 'weighing' the mass of the captured nanoparticles and as an optical cavity that boosts the plasmonic signal from the nanoparticles. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated with two cancer biomarkers: the carcinoembryonic antigen and the prostate specific antigen, which are currently in clinical use for the diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of colon and prostate cancer, respectively. A detection limit of 1 × 10(-16) g ml(-1) in serum is achieved with both biomarkers, which is at least seven orders of magnitude lower than that achieved in routine clinical practice.

Patients and methods:   Patients were randomly assigned to enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo. FACT-P was completed before randomization, at weeks 13, 17, 21, and 25, and every 12 weeks thereafter while on study treatment. Longitudinal changes in FACT-P scores from baseline to 25 weeks were analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM), with a pattern mixture model (PMM) applied as secondary analysis to address non-ignorable missing data. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots were generated and different methodological approaches and models for handling missing data were applied. Due to the exploratory nature of the analyses, adjustments for multiple comparisons were not made. AFFIRM is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00974311.  Results:   The intention-to-treat FACT-P population included 938 patients (enzalutamide, n = 674; placebo n = 264) with evaluable FACT-P assessments at baseline and ≥1 post-baseline assessment. After 25 weeks, the mean FACT-P total score decreased by 1.52 points with enzalutamide compared with 13.73 points with placebo (P < 0.001). In addition, significant treatment differences at week 25 favoring enzalutamide were evident for all FACT-P subscales and indices, whether analyzed by MMRM or PMM.

The size of DVC may affect the venous control. We developed a trick to simplify the suturing of the DVC.  Materials and methods:   Forty-seven patients with localized prostate cancer were divided in two groups: group 1 (n = 24) underwent LRP with a conventional ligature of DVC, and in group 2 (n = 23) the venous control was done with ""Narrowing"" of DVC technique (N-DVC). Our technique involves maintaining pressure on a metallic urethral sound inserted into the urethra, just at the time of ligature. The width of DVC in group 2 was measured before and after applying the technique. The numbers of attempts to place the stitch adequately were recorded and compared in both groups. The demographic dates, perioperative dates and results were compared retrospectively.  Results:   Operative time, estimated blood loss, prostate weight, positive surgical margins rates and potency results showed no significant differences between the groups. The immediate 1-month, and 3-month continence rates were significantly greater in group 2 (30.4% vs. 12.5%, P = .048; 73.9% vs. 50%, P = .037, respectively). For all patients in group 2, width of DVC decreased and the ligation stitch was effective at the first attempt.

A difficulty of laparoscopic surgery involves converting two-dimensional (2D) images into 3D images and depth perception rearrangement. 3D imaging may remove the need for depth perception rearrangement and therefore have clinical benefits.  Methods:   We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial to compare the surgical outcome of 3D-high-definition (HD) resolution and 2D-HD imaging in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), in order to determine whether an LRP under HD resolution 3D imaging is superior to that under HD resolution 2D imaging in perioperative outcome, feasibility, and fatigue. One-hundred twenty-two patients were randomly assigned to a 2D or 3D group. The primary outcome was time to perform vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA), which is technically demanding and may include a number of technical difficulties considered in laparoscopic surgeries.  Results:   VUA time was not significantly shorter in the 3D group (26.7 min, mean) compared with the 2D group (30.1 min, mean) (p = 0.11, Student's t test). However, experienced surgeons and 3D-HD imaging were independent predictors for shorter VUA times (p = 0.000, p = 0.014, multivariate logistic regression analysis). Total pneumoperitoneum time was not different. No conversion case from 3D to 2D or LRP to open RP was observed. Fatigue was evaluated by a simulation sickness questionnaire and critical flicker frequency. Results were not different between the two groups. Subjective feasibility and satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the 3D group.  Conclusions:   Using a 3D imaging system in LRP may have only limited advantages in decreasing operation times over 2D imaging systems. However, the 3D system increased surgical feasibility and decreased surgeons' effort levels without inducing significant fatigue.""","""['Hidefumi Kinoshita', 'Ken Nakagawa', 'Yukio Usui', 'Masatsugu Iwamura', 'Akihiro Ito', 'Akira Miyajima', 'Akio Hoshi', 'Yoichi Arai', 'Shiro Baba', 'Tadashi Matsuda']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Surg Endosc""","""['Perioperative, pathologic, and early continence outcomes comparing three-dimensional and two-dimensional display systems for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy--a retrospective, single-surgeon study.', '3D vs 2D laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in organ-confined prostate cancer: comparison of operative data and pentafecta rates: a single cohort study.', 'Three-Dimensional (3D) Laparoscopy Versus Two-Dimensional (2D) Laparoscopy: A Single-Surgeon Prospective Randomized Comparative Study.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Impact of three-dimensional vision in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for renal tumors.', 'The role of cystoprostatectomy in management of locally advanced prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Does three-dimensional surgery affect recurrence patterns in patients with gastric cancer after laparoscopic R0 gastrectomy?

Using a novel case-based strategy, we developed and pilot tested an online educational program to promote shared decision making (SDM) by primary care clinicians.  Methods:   A three-phased approach was used: 1) development of a conceptual model of the SDM process; 2) development of an online teaching case utilizing the Design A Case (DAC) authoring template, a well-tested process used to create peer-reviewed web-based clinical cases across all levels of healthcare training; and 3) pilot testing of the case. Participants were clinician members affiliated with several primary care research networks across the United States who answered an invitation email. The case used prostate cancer screening as the clinical context and was delivered online. Post-intervention ratings of clinicians' general knowledge of SDM, knowledge of specific SDM steps, confidence in and intention to perform SDM steps were also collected online.  Results:   Seventy-nine clinicians initially volunteered to participate in the study, of which 49 completed the case and provided evaluations. Forty-three clinicians (87.8%) reported the case met all the learning objectives, and 47 (95.9%) indicated the case was relevant for other equipoise decisions. Thirty-one clinicians (63.3%) accessed supplementary information via links provided in the case. After viewing the case, knowledge of SDM was high (over 90% correctly identified the steps in a SDM process). Determining a patient's preferred role in making the decision (62.5% very confident) and exploring a patient's values (65.3% very confident) about the decisions were areas where clinician confidence was lowest. More than 70% of the clinicians intended to perform SDM in the future.  Conclusions:   A comprehensive model of the SDM process was used to design a case-based approach to teaching SDM skills to primary care clinicians. The case was favorably rated in this pilot study. Clinician skills training for helping patients clarify their values and for assessing patients' desire for involvement in decision making remain significant challenges and should be a focus of future comparative studies.""","""['Robert J Volk', 'Navkiran K Shokar', 'Viola B Leal', 'Robert J Bulik', 'Suzanne K Linder', 'Patricia Dolan Mullen', 'Richard M Wexler', 'Gurjeet S Shokar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['Achieving involvement: process outcomes from a cluster randomized trial of shared decision making skill development and use of risk communication aids in general practice.', 'What Exactly Is Shared Decision-Making?

This method can help in determining the whole-body dose. Options for risk estimations for toxicities in normal tissue and for the incidence of secondary malignancy are still under debate. In this investigation, helical tomotherapy (TOMO) is compared with step-and-shoot IMRT (SSIMRT) of the prostate gland by measuring the dose distribution within patients' lymphocytes. In this prospective study, blood was taken from 20 patients before and 10 min after their first irradiation fraction for each technique. The isolated leukocytes were fixed 2 h after radiation. DNA double-stranded breaks in lymphocyte nuclei were stained immunocytochemically using anti-gamma-H2AX antibodies. Gamma-H2AX foci distribution in lymphocytes was determined for each patient. Using a calibration line, dose distributions in patients' lymphocytes were determined by studying the gamma-H2AX foci distribution, and these data were used to generate a cumulative dose-lymphocyte histogram (DLH). Measured in vivo (DLH), significantly fewer lymphocytes indicated low-dose exposure (<40% of the applied dose) during TOMO compared with SSIMRT. The dose exposure range, between 45 and 100%, was equal with both radiation techniques. The mean number of gamma-H2AX foci per lymphocyte was significantly lower in the TOMO group compared with the SSIMRT group. In radiotherapy of the prostate gland, TOMO generates a smaller fraction of patients' lymphocytes with low-dose exposure relative to the whole body compared with SSIMRT.

These new techniques offer superior conformity of high-dose regions to the target compared to conventional techniques, however more normal tissue is exposed to low-dose radiation with VMAT. There is a potential increase in radiobiological effectiveness associated with lower energy photons delivered during VMAT as normal cells are exposed to a temporal change in incident photon energy spectrum. During VMAT deliveries, normal cells can be exposed to the primary radiation beam, as well as to transmission and scatter radiation. The impact of low-dose radiation, radiation-induced bystander effect and change in energy spectrum on normal cells is not well understood. The current study examined cell survival and DNA damage in normal prostate cells after exposure to out-of-field radiation both with and without the transfer of bystander factors. The effect of a change in energy spectrum out-of-field compared to in-field was also investigated. Prostate cancer (LNCaP) and normal prostate (PNT1A) cells were placed in-field and out-of-field, respectively, with the PNT1A cells being located 1 cm from the field edge when in-field cells were being irradiated with 2 Gy. Clonogenic and γ-H2AX assays were performed postirradiation to examine cell survival and DNA damage. The assays were repeated when bystander factors from the LNCaP cells were transferred to the PNT1A cells and also when the PNT1A cells were irradiated in-field to a different energy spectrum. An average out-of-field dose of 10.8 ± 4.2 cGy produced a significant reduction in colony volume and increase in the number of γ-H2AX foci/cell in the PNT1A cells compared to the sham-irradiated control cells. An adaptive response was observed in the PNT1A cells having first received a low out-of-field dose and then the bystander factors. The PNT1A cells showed a significant increase in γ-H2AX foci formation when irradiated to 20 cGy in-field in comparison to out-of-field. However, no significant difference in cell survival or colony volume was observed whether the PNT1A cells were irradiated in-field or out-of-field. Out-of-field radiation dose alone can have a damaging effect on the proliferation of PNT1A cells when a clinically relevant dose of 2 Gy is delivered in in-field. Out-of-field radiation with the transfer of bystander factors induces an adaptive response in the PNT1A cells.""","""['L Shields', 'I Vega-Carrascal', 'S Singleton', 'F M Lyng', 'B McClean']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Radiat Res""","""['DNA Damage and Cytokine Production in Non-Target Irradiated Lymphocytes.', 'DNA damage responses following exposure to modulated radiation fields.', 'Medium-mediated intercellular communication is involved in bystander responses of X-ray-irradiated normal human fibroblasts.', 'Radiation-induced bystander effect: the important part of ionizing radiation response.

Consequently, it was also observed that the β-catenin-E-cadherin association at the plasma membrane was disrupted during acute cytokine exposure. Additionally, it was demonstrated that disrupting cell-cell interactions led to increased migration of LNCaP cells in real-time migration assay. Nevertheless, ectopic expression of NKX3.1, which is degraded upon proinflammatory cytokine exposure in inflammation, was found to induce the degradation of β-catenin by inhibiting Akt(S473) phosphorylation, therefore, partially rescued the disrupted β-catenin-E-cadherin interaction as well as the cell migration in LNCaP cells upon cytokine exposure. As, the disrupted localization of β-catenin at the cell membrane as well as increased Akt(S308) priming phosphorylation was observed in human prostate tissues with prostatic inflammatory atrophy (PIA), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (H-PIN) and carcinoma lesions correlated with loss of NKX3.1 expression. Thus, the data indicate that the β-catenin signaling; consequently sub-cellular localization is deregulated in inflammation, associates with prostatic atrophy and PIN pathology.""","""['Bilge Debelec-Butuner', 'Cansu Alapinar', 'Nursah Ertunc', 'Ceren Gonen-Korkmaz', 'Kutsal Yörükoğlu', 'Kemal Sami Korkmaz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Decreased NKX3.1 protein expression in focal prostatic atrophy, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and adenocarcinoma: association with gleason score and chromosome 8p deletion.', 'Inflammation-mediated abrogation of androgen signaling: an in vitro model of prostate cell inflammation.', 'MYC overexpression induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and loss of Nkx3.1 in mouse luminal epithelial cells.', 'Id4 deficiency attenuates prostate development and promotes PIN-like lesions by regulating androgen receptor activity and expression of NKX3.1 and PTEN.', 'Inflammation, Microbiota, and Prostate Cancer.', 'Neural crest E-cadherin loss drives cleft lip/palate by epigenetic modulation via pro-inflammatory gene-environment interaction.', 'Application of Proteogenomics to Urine Analysis towards the Identification of Novel Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer: An Exploratory Study.', 'RNA m6A methylation regulates dissemination of cancer cells by modulating expression and membrane localization of β-catenin.', 'Expression and Polymorphism of TSLP/TSLP Receptors as Potential Diagnostic Markers of Colorectal Cancer Progression.', 'YTHDF2 mediates the mRNA degradation of the tumor suppressors to induce AKT phosphorylation in N6-methyladenosine-dependent way in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   The in vitro cultured human prostate cancer cell lines RWPE-1, LNCaP, PC-3, and TSU-Pr1 were randomly divided into four groups: control group; negative control group (treated with dimethyl sulfoxide), high-dose group (treated with 150 Μl 0.6 mg/ml quercetin), and low-dose group (treated with 150 Μl 0.3 mg/ml quercetin). The mRNA expression of HSP27 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence staining.

Moreover, microtubule stabilization caused by DTX is suppressed in CXCL12-stimulated PCa cells as revealed by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses. The effect of CXCL12 on microtubule stabilization is abrogated when PCa cells are pre-treated with a CXCR4 antagonist. In additional studies, we show that the chemoprotective action of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is mediated by p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4)-dependent activation of Lim domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), and inhibition of either PAK4 or LIMK1 leads to re-sensitization of PCa cells to DTX-induced tubulin polymerization and cellular toxicity even in the presence of CXCL12.

High-content cell spot microarray (CSMA) screen was performed in VCaP cells in the presence and absence of androgens with detection of Ki67 and cleaved ADP-ribose polymerase (cPARP) as assays for cell proliferation and apoptosis. Thirty-nine candidate genes were identified, whose silencing inhibited proliferation or induced apoptosis of VCaP cells exclusively under androgen-deprived conditions. One of the candidates, HSPB (heat shock 27 kDa)-associated protein 1 (HSPBAP1), was confirmed to be highly expressed in tumor samples and its mRNA expression levels increased with the Gleason grade. We found that strong HSPBAP1 immunohistochemical staining (IHC) was associated with shorter disease-specific survival of PCa patients compared with negative to moderate staining. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HSPBAP1 interacts with AR in the nucleus of PCa cells specifically during androgen-deprived conditions, occupies chromatin at PSA/klk3 and TMPRSS2/tmprss2 enhancers and regulates their expression.

Aim:   We examined a proposed biopsychosocial conceptual model of couples' sexual recovery that included functional, psychological, and relational aspects of sexuality, surgery-related sexual losses, and grief and mourning as recovery process.  Methods:   We interviewed 20 couples preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. between 2010 and 2012. Interviews were analyzed with Analytic Induction qualitative methodology, using NVivo software. Paired t-tests described functional assessment data. Study findings led to a revised conceptual model.  Main outcome measures:   Couples' experiences were assessed through semi-structured interviews; male participants' sexual function was assessed with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and female participants' sexual function with the Female Sexual Function Index.  Results:   Preoperatively, 30% of men had erectile dysfunction (ED) and 84% of partners were postmenopausal. All valued sexual recovery, but worried about cancer spread and surgery side effects. Faith in themselves and their surgeons led 90% of couples to overestimate erectile recovery. Postoperatively, most men had ED and lost confidence. Couples' sexual activity decreased. Couples reported feeling loss and grief: cancer diagnosis was the first loss, followed by surgery-related sexual losses. Couples' engagement in intentional sex, patients' acceptance of erectile aids, and partners' interest in sex aided the recovery of couples' sexual intimacy recovery. Unselfconscious sex, not returning to erectile function baseline, was seen as the end point. Survey findings documented participants' sexual function losses, confirming qualitative findings.

Targeting tumor blood vessels for destruction, or tumor vascular disruption therapy, can therefore provide significant therapeutic benefit. Here, we describe the ability of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-bearing T cells to recognize human prostate-specific membrane antigen (hPSMA) on endothelial targets in vitro as well as in vivo. CAR T cells were generated using the anti-PSMA scFv, J591, and the intracellular signaling domains: CD3ζ, CD28, and/or CD137/4-1BB. We found that all anti-hPSMA CAR T cells recognized and eliminated PSMA(+) endothelial targets in vitro, regardless of the signaling domain. T cells bearing the third-generation anti-hPSMA CAR, P28BBζ, were able to recognize and kill primary human endothelial cells isolated from gynecologic cancers. In addition, the P28BBζ CAR T cells mediated regression of hPSMA-expressing vascular neoplasms in mice. Finally, in murine models of ovarian cancers populated by murine vessels expressing hPSMA, the P28BBζ CAR T cells were able to ablate PSMA(+) vessels, cause secondary depletion of tumor cells, and reduce tumor burden. Taken together, these results provide a strong rationale for the use of CAR T cells as agents of tumor vascular disruption, specifically those targeting PSMA.

Methods:   We designed and synthesized fluorinated 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derivatives to target T877A-AR. We performed binding assays to select suitable candidates using COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type or T877A AR (WT-AR, T877A-AR) expressing plasmids and investigated cellular uptake of candidate (18) F-RB390. Stability, biodistribution analyses and PET-Imaging were assessed by injecting (18) F-RB390 (10MBq), with and without co-injection of an excess of unlabeled DHT in C4-2 and PC-3 tumor bearing male SCID mice (n = 12).  Results:   RB390 presented a higher relative binding affinity (RBA) (28.1%, IC50 = 32 nM) for T877A-AR than for WT-AR (1.7%, IC50 = 357 nM) related to DHT (RBA = 100%). A small fraction of (18) F-RB390 was metabolized when incubated with murine liver homogenate or human blood for 3 hr. The metabolite of RB390, 3-hydroxysteroid RB448, presented similar binding characteristics as RB390. (18) F-RB390 but not (18) F-FDG or (18) F-FCH accumulated 2.5× more in COS-7 cells transfected with pSG5AR-T877A than with control plasmid. Accumulation was reduced with an excess of DHT. PET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies revealed a significantly higher uptake of (18) F-RB390 in T877A mutation positive xenografts compared to PC-3 control tumors. This effect was blunted with DHT.

Furthermore, sPSA is not able to discriminate between poorly-, moderately-, and well-differentiated PCa. We investigated prostatic protein glycosylation profiles as a potential PCa biomarker.  Methods:   Differences in total urine N-glycosylation profile of prostatic proteins were determined between healthy volunteers (n = 54), patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; n = 93) and newly diagnosed PCa patients (n = 74). Variations in N-glycosylation profile and prostate volume were combined into one urinary glycoprofile marker (UGM). Additionally, differences in N-glycosylation were identified between Gleason <7, =7, and >7.  Results:   The UGM was able to discriminate BPH from PCa, overall and in the diagnostic gray zone (P < 0.001). The UGM showed comparable diagnostic accuracy to sPSA, but gave an additive diagnostic value to sPSA (P < 0.001). In the diagnostic gray zone the UGM performed significantly better than sPSA (P < 0.001).

Bortezomib has been proposed to stimulate autophagy, but scientific observations did not always support this. Interactions between ERK activity and autophagy are complex and not completely clear. Autophagy proteins have recently been shown to regulate the functions of ERK, and ERK activation has been found to induce autophagy. On the other hand, sustained activation of ERK has also been shown to inhibit the maturation step of the autophagy process. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanism of autophagy regulation in cancer cells treated with bortezomib. Our results indicate that bortezomib blocked the autophagic flux without inhibiting the fusion of the autophagosome and lysosome. In ovarian cancer, as well as endometrial cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma cells, bortezomib inhibited protein degradation in lysosomes by suppressing cathepsins, which requires the participation of ERK phosphorylation, but not JNK or p38. Our findings that ERK phosphorylation reduced cathepsins further explain how ERK phosphorylation inhibits the autophagic flux. In conclusion, bortezomib may induce ERK phosphorylation to suppress cathepsin B and inhibit the catalytic process of autophagy in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. The inhibition of cisplatin-induced autophagy by bortezomib can enhance chemotherapy efficacy in ovarian cancer. As we also found that bortezomib blocks the autophagic flux in other cancers, the synergistic cytotoxic effect of bortezomib by abolishing chemotherapy-related autophagy may help us develop strategies of combination therapies for multiple cancers.""","""['C Kao', 'A Chao', 'C-L Tsai', 'W-C Chuang', 'W-P Huang', 'G-C Chen', 'C-Y Lin', 'T-H Wang', 'H-S Wang', 'C-H Lai']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Bortezomib induces apoptosis and autophagy in osteosarcoma cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in vitro.', 'Investigation of the eIF2alpha phosphorylation mechanism in response to proteasome inhibition in melanoma and breast cancer cells.', 'ARHI (DIRAS3)-mediated autophagy-associated cell death enhances chemosensitivity to cisplatin in ovarian cancer cell lines and xenografts.', 'You eat what you are: autophagy inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in leukemia.', 'Molecular mechanisms for synergistic effect of proteasome inhibitors with platinum-based therapy in solid tumors.', 'Antitumoral effects of Bortezomib in malignant mesothelioma: evidence of mild endoplasmic reticulum stress in vitro and activation of T cell response in vivo.', 'Bortezomib abrogates temozolomide-induced autophagic flux through an ATG5 dependent pathway.', 'MLN2238 exerts its anti-tumor effects via regulating ROS/JNK/mitochondrial signaling pathways in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Autophagy activation can partially rescue proteasome dysfunction-mediated cardiac toxicity.', 'In utero hypoxia attenuated acetylcholine-mediated vasodilatation via CHRM3/p-NOS3 in fetal sheep MCA: role of ROS/ERK1/2.']"""

Resurgent androgen receptor (AR) activity is an established driver of castration-resistant progression, and upregulation of the full-length AR (AR-FL) and constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-Vs) has been implicated to contribute to the resurgent AR activity. We reported previously that ginsenoside 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-aglycone (PPD) can reduce the abundance of both AR-FL and AR-Vs. In the present study, we further showed that the effect of PPD on AR expression and target genes was independent of androgen. PPD treatment resulted in a suppression of ligand-independent AR transactivation. Moreover, PPD delayed castration-resistant regrowth of LNCaP xenograft tumors after androgen deprivation and inhibited the growth of castration-resistant 22Rv1 xenograft tumors with endogenous expression of AR-FL and AR-Vs. This was accompanied by a decline in serum prostate-specific antigen levels as well as a decrease in AR levels and mitoses in the tumors. Notably, the 22Rv1 xenograft tumors were resistant to growth inhibition by the next-generation anti-androgen enzalutamide. The present study represents the first to show the preclinical efficacy of PPD in inhibiting castration-resistant progression and growth of prostate cancer.

To overcome this problem, various surface coating protocols have been developed. However, a comparative and precise real-time measurement of their impact on cell behavior has not been conducted. The prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, derived from a patient lymph node metastasis, is a commonly used model system in prostate cancer research. However, the cells' characteristically weak attachment to the surface of tissue culture vessels and cover slips has impeded their manipulation and analysis and use in high throughput screening. To improve the adherence of LNCaP cells to the culture surface, we compared different coating reagents (poly-L-lysine, poly-L-ornithine, collagen type IV, fibronectin, and laminin) and culturing conditions and analyzed their impact on cell proliferation, adhesion, morphology, mobility and gene expression using real-time technologies. The results showed that fibronectin, poly-L-lysine and poly-L-ornithine improved LNCaP cells adherence and provoked cell morphology alterations, such as increase of nuclear and cellular area. These coating reagents also induced a higher expression of F-actin and reduced cell mobility. In contrast, laminin and collagen type IV did not improve adherence but promoted cell aggregation and affected cell morphology. Cells cultured in the presence of laminin displayed higher mobility than control cells. All the coating conditions significantly affected cell viability; however, they did not affect the expression of androgen receptor-regulated genes. Our comparative findings provide important insight for the selection of the ideal coating reagent and culture conditions for the cancer cell lines with respect to their effect on proliferation rate, attachment, morphology, migration, transcriptional response and cellular cytoskeleton arrangement.""","""['Michelle S Liberio', 'Martin C Sadowski', 'Carolina Soekmadji', 'Rohan A Davis', 'Colleen C Nelson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Chemical and physical modifications to poly(dimethylsiloxane) surfaces affect adhesion of Caco-2 cells.', 'Type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin promote the adhesion and migration of rabbit lens epithelial cells in vitro.', 'Effect of collagen I and fibronectin on the adhesion, elasticity and cytoskeletal organization of prostate cancer cells.', 'The surface energy of various biomaterials coated with adhesion molecules used in cell culture.', 'Simvastatin alters fibroblastic cell responses involved in tissue repair.', 'Metasurface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy in multiwell format for real-time assaying of live cells.', 'Microfluidic Wound-Healing Assay for ECM and Microenvironment Properties on Microglia BV2 Cells Migration.', 'Prostate cancer cells of increasing metastatic potential exhibit diverse contractile forces, cell stiffness, and motility in a microenvironment stiffness-dependent manner.', 'See-N-Seq: RNA sequencing of target single cells identified by microscopy via micropatterning of hydrogel porosity.', 'Direct addition of poly-lysine or poly-ethylenimine to the medium: A simple alternative to plate pre-coating.']"""

The significance of DHT or 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARI) in PCa development and progression has not yet been fully characterized. The aim of this study was to determine whether the initiation of DNA replication was influenced by DHT in PCa. Three cell lines were used. LNCaP: a human PCa cell line that exhibits androgen-dependent proliferation, C4-2: a human PCa cell line that exhibits androgen-independent proliferation, and C4-2AT6: a castration resistant prostate cancer cell line. Two 5ARIs, finasteride and dutasteride, were used. We examined the mRNA expression of the components of pre-replication complex (Pre-RC), CDC6, CDT1, and MCM2-7. DHT induced cell proliferation of LNCaP accompanied by significantly increased CDC6, CDT1, and MCM2-7 expression. In contrast to LNCaP, DHT inhibited cell proliferation in C4-2AT6 cells accompanied by decreased expression of CDC6, CDT1, and MCM2-7. These reverse effects resemble the effects of 5ARIs in Pre-RC. Treatment with finasteride or dutasteride inhibited CDC6 expression in LNCaP, but both 5ARIs induced CDC6 expression in C4-2 and C4-2AT6 cells.These results indicate that DHT showed reversal effects on PCa cell proliferation among prostate cancer cells based on androgen-dependence, accompanied by regulation of the initiation of DNA replication. 5ARIs may modulate the DNA replication system in someaggressive PCa through up-regulation of CDC6 expression.""","""['Takeo Kosaka', 'Yota Yasumizu', 'Yasumasa Miyazaki', 'Akira Miyajima', 'Eiji Kikuchi', 'Mototsugu Oya']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Clin Exp Urol""","""['Is DHT Production by 5α-Reductase Friend or Foe in Prostate Cancer?', 'Dutasteride, the dual 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, inhibits androgen action and promotes cell death in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line.', 'New steroidal 17β-carboxy derivatives present anti-5α-reductase activity and anti-proliferative effects in a human androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line.', 'Androgen-induced prostate-specific antigen gene expression is mediated via dihydrotestosterone in LNCaP cells.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The proliferation of atypical hepatocytes and CDT1 expression in noncancerous tissue are associated with the postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Long non-coding RNA-PCGEM1 contributes to prostate cancer progression by sponging microRNA miR-129-5p to enhance chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 expression.', 'Adverse Effects and Safety of 5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride): A Systematic Review.', 'Tissue Effects in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Short-term Finasteride in Early Prostate Cancer.', 'Combination of 5α-reductase inhibitor with combined androgen blockade (CAB) as a novel cytoreductive regimen before prostate brachytherapy: Ultra-CAB.']"""

Qualitative interviews with men participating in the ProDiet study were undertaken to explore the feasibility of implementing dietary interventions for the prevention of prostate cancer.  Methods:   An interview study nested within the ProDiet randomised feasibility trial of dietary interventions to prevent a PC diagnosis. Men (n = 133) who previously participated in community based prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing without PC but who were at increased risk of the disease were randomly allocation to both lycopene (lycopene or placebo capsules or lycopene rich diet) and green tea (green tea or placebo capsules or green tea drink) for 6 months. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants shortly after randomisation, to investigate attitudes towards dietary modification for PC prevention and dietary information. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed to identify common themes.  Results:   Interviews were conducted with 21 participants aged 52-72 years with PSA levels between 2.5 and 2.95 ng/ml, or a negative prostate biopsy result. Most men identified the major causes of cancer in general to include diet, environment, ageing and genetic factors. This contrasted sharply with men's uncertainty about PC aetiology, and the function of the prostate. Men were confused by conflicting messages in the media about dietary practices to promote health overall, but were positive about the potential of lycopene and green tea in relation to PC prevention, valuing their natural components. Furthermore these men wanted tailored dietary advice for PC prevention from their clinicians, whom they considered a trusted source of information.

It has a wide spectrum of differential. In many occasions, it is a presentation of underlining serious urological problems. Evaluation of gross and significant microscopic haematuria is of paramount importance. This study was conducted to assess and compare the findings and diagnostic competency of transabdominal ultrasonography (US) versus cystourethroscopy in patients with haematuria of lower urinary tract origin.  Methods:   Prospective hospital-based study done at Ibn Sina Specialized and Omdurman Military Hospitals from June 2012 to March 2013. The study included 109 patients. Structured questionnaires were used to gather data from patients. All patients were evaluated by transabdominal US before cystourethroscopy examination.  Results:   One hundred and nine patients were studied. Patients' mean (SD) age was 57.9 (18.8) years. Fifty-four patients (49.5 %) presented with macroscopic haematuria, while 55 patients presented with microscopic haematuria. The sensitivity and specificity of the US in detecting prostate enlargement, vesical stones, bladder wall tumour, cystitis and schistosomiasis were [(84, 80 %); (82.6, 97.7 %); (64.7, 92.1 %); (15.3, 96.8 %); and (15.3, 98.9 %)], respectively, as compared to cystoscopic finding as the gold standard.

However, the value of FDG PET/CT for detecting prostate cancer is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of incidental prostate 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT scans. We reviewed 18F-FDG PET/CT scan reports from September 2009 to September 2013, and selected cases that reported focal/diffuse FDG uptake in the prostate. We analyzed the correlation between 18F-FDG PET/CT scan findings and data collected during evaluations such as serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), and/or biopsy to confirm prostate cancer. Of a total of 18,393 cases, 106 (0.6%) exhibited abnormal hypermetabolism in the prostate. Additional evaluations were performed in 66 patients. Serum PSA levels were not significantly correlated with maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) in all patients (rho 0.483, p=0.132). Prostate biopsies were performed in 15 patients, and prostate cancer was confirmed in 11. The median serum PSA level was 4.8 (0.55-7.06) ng/mL and 127.4 (1.06-495) ng/mL in the benign and prostate cancer groups, respectively. The median SUVmax was higher in the prostate cancer group (mean 10.1, range 3.8-24.5) than in the benign group (mean 4.3, range 3.1-8.8), but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.078). There was no significant correlation between SUVmax and serum PSA, prostatic volume, or Gleason score. 18F-FDG PET/CT scans did not reliably differentiate malignant or benign from abnormal uptake lesions in the prostate, and routine prostate biopsy was not usually recommended in patients with abnormal FDG uptake.

Methods:   We included 1'254 prostate cancer patients recorded at the Geneva Cancer Registry who had radical prostatectomy during 1990-2008. To assess factors associated with positive margins, we used logistic regression. We assessed the effects of positive margins on prostate cancer-specific survival by Cox proportional hazard models accounting for numerous other prognostics factors including prostate and tumour volume, the total percentage of tumour, radiotherapy, surgical approach and surgeon's caseload.  Results:   Among men undergoing prostatectomy, 479 (38%) had positive margins. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, period, clinical- and pathological T stage, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score and percentage of tumour in the prostate were significantly associated to positive margins. Ten-year prostate cancer-specific survival was 96.6% for the negative margins group and 92.0% for the positive margins group (log rank p = 0.008). In the Cox survival analysis adjusted for tumour characteristics, surgical margin status per se was not an independent prognostic factor while age, pathological T, PSA level and Gleason score remained associated with prostate cancer-specific survival.

Accumulated evidence demonstrates an anti-tumor effect of maspin on tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. The molecular mechanism underlying these biological functions of maspin is thought to be through histone deacetylase inhibition, key to the maintenance of differentiated epithelial phenotype. Since tumor-driven stromal reactivities co-evolve in tumor progression and metastasis, it is not surprising that maspin expression in tumor cells inhibits extracellular matrix degradation, increases fibrosis and blocks hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. Using the athymic nude mouse model capable of supporting the growth and progression of xenogeneic human prostate cancer cells, we further demonstrate that maspin expression in tumor cells elicits neutrophil- and B cells-dependent host tumor immunogenicity. Specifically, mice bearing maspin-expressing tumors exhibited increased systemic and intratumoral neutrophil maturation, activation and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, and decreased peritumoral lymphangiogenesis. These results reveal a novel biological function of maspin in directing host immunity towards tumor elimination that helps explain the significant reduction of xenograft tumor incidence in vivo and the clinical correlation of maspin with better prognosis of several types of cancer.

Objective:   Compare multiple approaches for generating cancer care composite measures and evaluate how well composite measures summarize dimensions of cancer care and predict survival.  Study design:   We computed hospital-level rates for 13 colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer process measures in 59 Veterans Affairs hospitals. We computed 4 empirical-factor (based on an exploratory factor analysis), 3 cancer-specific (colorectal, lung, prostate care), and 3 care modality-specific (diagnosis/evaluation, surgical, nonsurgical treatments) composite measures. We assessed correlations among all composite measures and estimated all-cause survival for colon, rectal, non-small cell lung, and small cell lung cancers as a function of composite scores, adjusting for patient characteristics.  Results:   Four factors emerged from the factor analysis: nonsurgical treatment, surgical treatment, colorectal early diagnosis, and prostate treatment. We observed strong correlations (r) among composite measures comprised of similar process measures (r=0.58-1.00, P<0.0001), but not among composite measures reflecting different care dimensions.

We have previously shown that PAR1 and PAR4 are able to promote the migration of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells suggesting a function in HCC progression. In this study, we assessed the underlying signalling mechanisms.  Methods:   Using Hep3B liver carcinoma cells, RTK activation was assessed by Western blot employing phospho-RTK specific antibodies, ROS level were estimated by H2DCF-DA using confocal laser scanning microscopy, and measurement of PTP activity was performed in cell lysates using 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) as a substrate.  Results:   Thrombin, the PAR1 selective agonist peptide TFLLRN-NH2 (PAR1-AP), and the PAR4 selective agonist peptide, AYPGKF-NH2 (PAR4-AP), induced a significant increase in Hep3B cell migration that could be blocked by inhibitors targeting formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), or activation of hepatocyte-growth factor receptor (Met), or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), respectively. The involvement of these intracellular effectors in PAR1/4-initiated migratory signalling was further supported by the findings that individual stimulation of Hep3B cells with the PAR1-AP and the PAR4-AP induced an increase in ROS production and the transactivation of Met and PDGFR. In addition, PAR1- and PAR4-mediated inhibition of total PTP activity and specifically PTP1B. ROS inhibition by N-acetyl-L-cysteine prevented the inhibition of PTP1B phosphatase activity induced by PAR1-AP and the PAR4-AP, but had no effect on PAR1/4-mediated activation of Met and PDGFR in Hep3B cells.  Conclusions:   Collectively, our data indicate that PAR1 and PAR4 activate common promigratory signalling pathways in Hep3B liver carcinoma cells including activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases Met and PDGFR, the formation of ROS and the inactivation of PTP1B. However, PAR1/4-triggered Met and PDGFR transactivation seem to be mediated independently from the ROS-PTP1B signalling module.""","""['Franziska Mußbach', 'Petra Henklein', 'Martin Westermann', 'Utz Settmacher', 'Frank-D Böhmer', 'Roland Kaufmann']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits thrombin-induced hepatocellular carcinoma cell invasion and p42/p44-MAPKinase activation.', 'Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) in hepatic stellate cells - evidence for a role in hepatocellular carcinoma growth in vivo.', 'Thrombin-mediated hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration: cooperative action via proteinase-activated receptors 1 and 4.', 'Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) - focus on receptor-receptor-interactions and their physiological and pathophysiological impact.', 'Cofactoring and dimerization of proteinase-activated receptors.', 'Diversification of PAR signaling through receptor crosstalk.', 'Bladder Oxidative Stress and HMGB1 Release Contribute to PAR4-Mediated Bladder Pain in Mice.', 'MET in glioma: signaling pathways and targeted therapies.', 'PAR4 overexpression promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation and migration.', 'Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1): a promising molecular target for cancer.']"""

Cell viability was measured by MTT assay; cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. The expression levels of IGFBP-3 and Bcl-2 mRNA and protein were analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.  Results:   The proliferation of LNCaP cells was be inhibited by IP6 in a dose dependent manner. After exposure to IP6 for 24 h, the cell viability in LNCaP cells and siRNA-treated LNCaP cells was 53.2%±11.6% and 82.3%±10.9%, respectively (P<0.05).

We investigated the roles of ANGPTLs in the acquisition of androgen independence and the malignant behavior of human prostate cancer cells. Expression of ANGPTL messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins were ascertained using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis in human prostate cancer cell lines. Androgen‑dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent LNCaP/AI cells, respectively, were cultured in fetal bovine and charcoal-stripped medium. Cell proliferation, androgen dependence, migration and invasion, respectively, were examined under the overexpression and knockdown of ANGPTL2 by transfection of ANGPTL2 cDNA and its small‑interfering RNA (siRNA). The effects of exogenous ANGPTL2 and blocking of its receptor, integrin α5β1, were also investigated. Human prostate cancer cell lines predominantly expressed ANGPTL2 among the members. Interrupting ANGPTL2 expression with siRNA suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of LNCaP cells. LNCaP/AI cells showed a higher ANGPTL2 expression than that of LNCaP cells. Furthermore, siRNA led to apoptosis of LNCaP/AI cells. The ANGPTL2-overexpressing LNCaP cells markedly increased proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant behavior in androgen‑deprived medium. The migration rates were increased depending on the concentration of ANGPTL2 recombinant protein and were inhibited by anti-integrin α5β1 antibodies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to elucidate the expression of ANGPTL2 in human prostate cancer cells. ANGPTL2 may be important in the acquisition of androgen independency and tumor progression of prostate cancer in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner via the integrin α5β1 receptor. Targeting ANGPTL2 may therefore be an efficacious therapeutic modality for prostate cancer.""","""['Ryuta Sato', 'Mutsushi Yamasaki', 'Kenichi Hirai', 'Takanori Matsubara', 'Takeo Nomura', 'Fuminori Sato', 'Hiromitsu Mimata']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['The Vav3 oncogene enhances the malignant potential of prostate cancer cells under chronic hypoxia.', 'Simvastatin Up-Regulates Annexin A10 That Can Inhibit the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion in Androgen-Independent Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Angiopoietin-like protein 2 regulates Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in human gingival epithelial cells.', 'The Roles of ANGPTL Families in Cancer Progression.', 'Angiopoietin-like proteins--potential therapeutic targets for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.', 'The Emerging Role of Cell Adhesion Molecules on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Endothelial Dysfunction Syndromes after Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation.', 'Angiopoietin-Like Protein 2 Is Increased in Obese Mouse Models of Lung Injury.', 'Angptl2 is a Marker of Cellular Senescence: The Physiological and Pathophysiological Impact of Angptl2-Related Senescence.', 'Exosomal ANGPTL1 attenuates colorectal cancer liver metastasis by regulating Kupffer cell secretion pattern and impeding MMP9 induced vascular leakiness.']"""

Methods:   The data of 113 diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer patients from January 2002 to June 2010 were collected retrospectively, including patient's age at diagnosis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at diagnosis,Gleason score, clinical stage, PSA nadir during hormonal therapy, the time to PSA nadir, vital status, survival time and cause of death. The expression of AR-V7 in prostate cancer tissue was detected by using immunohistochemical staining. The correlation of AR-V7 expression and patient clinicopathological characteristics in all patients were analysed using Student t-test or Chi-square test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the predictive role of AR-V7 expression and patient characteristics for overall survival.  Results:   The median PSA nadir was 0.7 µg/L (ranged from 0.0 to 143.0 µg/L). The median time to PSA nadir was 8.1 months (ranged from 0.9 to 71.0 months). The follow-up was performed until March 12, 2014. During the follow-up period, 67 of 113 metastatic prostate cancer patients (59.3%) died and the median overall survival was 96 months (ranged from 5 to 135 months). The AR-V7 detection rate was 20.4% (23/113). The serum PSA level in patients with positively expression of AR-V7 was significantly higher than that without AR-V7 expression (t = 2.521, P = 0.013). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the expression of AR-V7 (HR = 2.421, P = 0.002) and time to PSA nadir (HR = 1.019, P = 0.022) were independent prognostic factors of overall survival for metastatic prostate cancer patients.  Conclusions:   The expression of AR-V7 in prostate cancer tissues and time to PSA nadir during hormonal therapy are independent prognostic factors of overall survival for metastatic prostate cancer patients.

In this study, the authors measured accuracy and interobserver variability in the segmentation of the prostate on T2-weighted endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging within the whole gland (WG), and separately within the apex, midgland, and base regions.  Methods:   The authors collected MR images from 42 prostate cancer patients. Prostate border delineation was performed manually by one observer on all images and by two other observers on a subset of ten images. The authors used complementary boundary-, region-, and volume-based metrics [mean absolute distance (MAD), Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall rate, precision rate, and volume difference (ΔV)] to elucidate the different types of segmentation errors that they observed. Evaluation for expert manual and semiautomatic segmentation approaches was carried out. Compared to manual segmentation, the authors' semiautomatic approach reduces the necessary user interaction by only requiring an indication of the anteroposterior orientation of the prostate and the selection of prostate center points on the apex, base, and midgland slices. Based on these inputs, the algorithm identifies candidate prostate boundary points using learned boundary appearance characteristics and performs regularization based on learned prostate shape information.  Results:   The semiautomated algorithm required an average of 30 s of user interaction time (measured for nine operators) for each 3D prostate segmentation. The authors compared the segmentations from this method to manual segmentations in a single-operator (mean whole gland MAD = 2.0 mm, DSC = 82%, recall = 77%, precision = 88%, and ΔV = - 4.6 cm(3)) and multioperator study (mean whole gland MAD = 2.2 mm, DSC = 77%, recall = 72%, precision = 86%, and ΔV = - 4.0 cm(3)). These results compared favorably with observed differences between manual segmentations and a simultaneous truth and performance level estimation reference for this data set (whole gland differences as high as MAD = 3.1 mm, DSC = 78%, recall = 66%, precision = 77%, and ΔV = 15.5 cm(3)). The authors found that overall, midgland segmentation was more accurate and repeatable than the segmentation of the apex and base, with the base posing the greatest challenge.  Conclusions:   The main conclusions of this study were that (1) the semiautomated approach reduced interobserver segmentation variability; (2) the segmentation accuracy of the semiautomated approach, as well as the accuracies of recently published methods from other groups, were within the range of observed expert variability in manual prostate segmentation; and (3) further efforts in the development of computer-assisted segmentation would be most productive if focused on improvement of segmentation accuracy and reduction of variability within the prostatic apex and base.""","""['Maysam Shahedi', 'Derek W Cool', 'Cesare Romagnoli', 'Glenn S Bauman', 'Matthew Bastian-Jordan', 'Eli Gibson', 'George Rodrigues', 'Belal Ahmad', 'Michael Lock', 'Aaron Fenster', 'Aaron D Ward']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Accuracy Validation of an Automated Method for Prostate Segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'A semiautomatic segmentation method for prostate in CT images using local texture classification and statistical shape modeling.', 'Three-dimensional ultrasound of carotid atherosclerosis: semiautomated segmentation using a level set-based method.', 'Multivariate statistical model for 3D image segmentation with application to medical images.', 'A New Optimized Thresholding Method Using Ant Colony Algorithm for MR Brain Image Segmentation.', 'Comparison of automated segmentation techniques for magnetic resonance images of the prostate.', 'Deep learning prediction of non-perfused volume without contrast agents during prostate ablation therapy.', 'Automated prostate multi-regional segmentation in magnetic resonance using fully convolutional neural networks.', 'Learning rate of students detecting and annotating pediatric wrist fractures in supervised artificial intelligence dataset preparations.', 'Integration of Deep Learning and Active Shape Models for More Accurate Prostate Segmentation in 3D MR Images.']"""

The treatment is performed within a clinical MRI to obtain real-time MR thermometry used as an active feedback to control the spatial heating pattern in the prostate and to monitor for potential damage to surrounding tissues. This requires that the MR thermometry measurements are an accurate representation of the true tissue temperature. The proton resonance frequency shift thermometry method used is sensitive to tissue motion and changes in the local magnetic susceptibility that can be caused by the motion of air bubbles in the rectum, which can impact the performance of transurethral MR-HIFU in these regions of the gland.  Methods:   A method is proposed for filtering of temperature artifacts based on the temporal variance of the temperature, using empirical and dynamic positional knowledge of the ultrasonic heating beam, and an estimation of the measurement noise. A two-step correction strategy is introduced which eliminates artifact-detected temperature variations while keeping the noise level low through spatial averaging.  Results:   The filter has been evaluated by postprocessing data from five human transurethral ultrasound treatments. The two-step correction process led to reduced final temperature standard deviation in the prostate and rectum areas where the artifact was located, without negatively affecting areas distal to the artifact. The performance of the filter was also found to be consistent across all six of the data sets evaluated. The evaluation of the detection criterion parameter M determined that a value of M = 3 achieves a conservative filter with minimal loss of spatial resolution during the process.  Conclusions:   The filter was able to remove most artifacts due to the presence of moving air bubbles in the rectum during transurethral MR-HIFU. A quantitative estimation of the filter capabilities shows a systematic improvement in the standard deviation of the corrected temperature maps in the rectum zone as well as in the entire acquired slice.""","""['Alain Schmitt', 'Charles Mougenot', 'Rajiv Chopra']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Hybrid ultrasound-MR guided HIFU treatment method with 3D motion compensation.', 'Integrated thermal and magnetic susceptibility modeling for air-motion artifact correction in proton resonance frequency shift thermometry.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Hyperthermia for Recurrent Rectal Cancer: MR Thermometry Evaluation and Preclinical Validation.', 'Magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity ultrasound ablation of the prostate.', 'MR techniques for guiding high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatments.', 'Focused ultrasound-mediated small-molecule delivery to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade in solid tumors.', 'POD-Kalman filtering for improving noninvasive 3D temperature monitoring in MR-guided hyperthermia.', 'Enhanced HIFU Theranostics with Dual-Frequency-Ring Focused Ultrasound and Activatable Perfluoropentane-Loaded Polymer Nanoparticles.', 'Correction of motion-induced susceptibility artifacts and B0 drift during proton resonance frequency shift-based MR thermometry in the pelvis with background field removal methods.', 'Breath-hold MR-HIFU hyperthermia: phantom and in vivo feasibility.']"""

Methods:   A MR-compatible cryoneedle was inserted into identical gel phantoms (n = 3) on a 1.5 T MR system. Two fiber-optic temperature sensors were placed parallel to the needle. A fast 3D T1w gradient echo (GRE) sequence (TR/TE/FA = 4.81/1.98/6°) was used to monitor iceball progression. Normalized signal intensity (SI) was correlated with temperature. The same T1w sequence was used during MR-guided prostate cryoablation in ten consecutive patients at the authors' institution. In vivo findings were quantitatively compared to the phantom data.  Results:   In the phantom study, the cryoablation iceball appeared in the T1w MR images as a sharply delineated signal void. A 2.2 ± 0.2 mm wide hyperintense rim directly surrounded the iceball at cooled but nonfreezing temperatures (<20 °C) in the gel. Normalized SI was maximum at 8.4 ± 2.4 °C, showing a 35.6%-43.0% (mean 40.5%) increase with respect to baseline before cooling. In the clinical procedures, the same image contrast was observed in vivo in all patients. In vivo, width of the hyperintense rim was 1.6 ± 0.6 mm. Normalized SI increases with respect to nontreated prostate ranged 28.4%-55.6% (mean 36.8%). On quantitative analysis, normalized SI changes along a linear region of interest from surrounding tissue onto the iceball center were similar between the patients and phantom setting (root mean square difference 0.06).  Conclusions:   The hyperintense rim around the iceball in fast T1w GRE images corresponded to cooled but nonfreezing temperatures (<20 °C) proximal to the frozen zone.

Prostate HDR treatment often involves placing the HDR catheters (needles) into the prostate gland under the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance, then generating a radiation treatment plan based on CT prostate images, and subsequently delivering high dose of radiation through these catheters. The main challenge for this HDR procedure is to accurately segment the prostate volume in the CT images for the radiation treatment planning. In this study, the authors propose a novel approach that integrates the prostate volume from 3D TRUS images into the treatment planning CT images to provide an accurate prostate delineation for prostate HDR treatment.  Methods:   The authors' approach requires acquisition of 3D TRUS prostate images in the operating room right after the HDR catheters are inserted, which takes 1-3 min. These TRUS images are used to create prostate contours. The HDR catheters are reconstructed from the intraoperative TRUS and postoperative CT images, and subsequently used as landmarks for the TRUS-CT image fusion. After TRUS-CT fusion, the TRUS-based prostate volume is deformed to the CT images for treatment planning. This method was first validated with a prostate-phantom study. In addition, a pilot study of ten patients undergoing HDR prostate brachytherapy was conducted to test its clinical feasibility. The accuracy of their approach was assessed through the locations of three implanted fiducial (gold) markers, as well as T2-weighted MR prostate images of patients.  Results:   For the phantom study, the target registration error (TRE) of gold-markers was 0.41 ± 0.11 mm. For the ten patients, the TRE of gold markers was 1.18 ± 0.26 mm; the prostate volume difference between the authors' approach and the MRI-based volume was 7.28% ± 0.86%, and the prostate volume Dice overlap coefficient was 91.89% ± 1.19%.  Conclusions:   The authors have developed a novel approach to improve prostate contour utilizing intraoperative TRUS-based prostate volume in the CT-based prostate HDR treatment planning, demonstrated its clinical feasibility, and validated its accuracy with MRIs. The proposed segmentation method would improve prostate delineations, enable accurate dose planning and treatment delivery, and potentially enhance the treatment outcome of prostate HDR brachytherapy.""","""['Xiaofeng Yang', 'Peter Rossi', 'Tomi Ogunleye', 'David M Marcus', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Hui Mao', 'Walter J Curran', 'Tian Liu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A New CT Prostate Segmentation for CT-Based HDR Brachytherapy.', 'Improved prostate delineation in prostate HDR brachytherapy with TRUS-CT deformable registration technology: A pilot study with MRI validation.', 'Multi-needle Localization with Attention U-Net in US-guided HDR Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'MRI-based prostate and dominant lesion segmentation using cascaded scoring convolutional neural network.', 'A review of deep learning based methods for medical image multi-organ segmentation.', 'Male pelvic multi-organ segmentation aided by CBCT-based synthetic MRI.', 'A Denoising Algorithm for CT Image Using Low-rank Sparse Coding.', 'A MR-TRUS Registration Method for Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Interventions.']"""

Methods:   A total of six textural features including angular second moment, inverse difference moment, contrast, variance, correlation, and entropy were calculated for fluence maps generated from 20 prostate and 20 head and neck VMAT plans. For each of the textural features, particular displacement distances (d) of 1, 5, and 10 were adopted. To investigate the deliverability of each VMAT plan, gamma passing rates of pretreatment quality assurance, and differences in modulating parameters such as multileaf collimator (MLC) positions, gantry angles, and monitor units at each control point between VMAT plans and dynamic log files registered by the Linac control system during delivery were acquired. Furthermore, differences between the original VMAT plan and the plan reconstructed from the dynamic log files were also investigated. To test the performance of the textural features as indicators for the modulation degree of VMAT plans, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (rs) with the plan deliverability were calculated. For comparison purposes, conventional modulation indices for VMAT including the modulation complexity score for VMAT, leaf travel modulation complexity score, and modulation index supporting station parameter optimized radiation therapy (MISPORT) were calculated, and their correlations were analyzed in the same way.  Results:   There was no particular textural feature which always showed superior correlations with every type of plan deliverability. Considering the results comprehensively, contrast (d = 1) and variance (d = 1) generally showed considerable correlations with every type of plan deliverability. These textural features always showed higher correlations to the plan deliverability than did the conventional modulation indices, except in the case of modulating parameter differences. The rs values of contrast to the global gamma passing rates with criteria of 2%/2 mm, 2%/1 mm, and 1%/2 mm were 0.536, 0.473, and 0.718, respectively. The respective values for variance were 0.551, 0.481, and 0.688. In the case of local gamma passing rates, the rs values of contrast were 0.547, 0.578, and 0.620, respectively, and those of variance were 0.519, 0.527, and 0.569. All of the rs values in those cases were statistically significant (p < 0.003). In the cases of global and local gamma passing rates, MISPORT showed the highest correlations among the conventional modulation indices. For global passing rates, rs values of MISPORT were -0.420, -0.330, and -0.632, respectively, and those for local passing rates were -0.455, -0.490 and -0.502. The values of rs of contrast, variance, and MISPORT with the MLC errors were -0.863, -0.828, and 0.795, respectively, all with statistical significances (p < 0.001). The correlations with statistical significances between variance and dose-volumetric differences were observed more frequently than the others.  Conclusions:   The contrast (d = 1) and variance (d = 1) calculated from fluence maps of VMAT plans showed considerable correlations with the plan deliverability, indicating their potential use as indicators for assessing the degree of modulation of VMAT plans. Both contrast and variance consistently showed better performance than the conventional modulation indices for VMAT.""","""['So-Yeon Park', 'Il Han Kim', 'Sung-Joon Ye', 'Joel Carlson', 'Jong Min Park']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Texture analysis on the edge-enhanced fluence of VMAT.', 'Textural feature calculated from segmental fluences as a modulation index for VMAT.', 'The effect of MLC speed and acceleration on the plan delivery accuracy of VMAT.', 'Evaluation of fluence-based dose delivery incorporating the spatial variation of dosimetric leaf gap (DLG).', 'Utilising the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training System to Support Undergraduate Teaching of IMRT, VMAT, DCAT Treatment Planning, and QA Concepts.', 'Evaluation of the dataset quality in gamma passing rate predictions using machine learning methods.', 'Effect of treatment planning system parameters on beam modulation complexity for treatment plans with single-layer multi-leaf collimator and dual-layer stacked multi-leaf collimator.', 'Prediction of VMAT delivery accuracy with textural features calculated from fluence maps.', 'Complexity metrics for IMRT and VMAT plans: a review of current literature and applications.', 'Assessment of the modulation degrees of intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans.']"""

However, manual segmentation from 3D CT images is very time-consuming and often causes large intra- and interobserver variations across clinicians. Many segmentation methods have been proposed to automate this labor-intensive process, but tedious manual editing is still required due to the limited performance. In this paper, the authors propose a new interactive segmentation method that can (1) flexibly generate the editing result with a few scribbles or dots provided by a clinician, (2) fast deliver intermediate results to the clinician, and (3) sequentially correct the segmentations from any type of automatic or interactive segmentation methods.  Methods:   The authors formulate the editing problem as a semisupervised learning problem which can utilize a priori knowledge of training data and also the valuable information from user interactions. Specifically, from a region of interest near the given user interactions, the appropriate training labels, which are well matched with the user interactions, can be locally searched from a training set. With voting from the selected training labels, both confident prostate and background voxels, as well as unconfident voxels can be estimated. To reflect informative relationship between voxels, location-adaptive features are selected from the confident voxels by using regression forest and Fisher separation criterion. Then, the manifold configuration computed in the derived feature space is enforced into the semisupervised learning algorithm. The labels of unconfident voxels are then predicted by regularizing semisupervised learning algorithm.  Results:   The proposed interactive segmentation method was applied to correct automatic segmentation results of 30 challenging CT images. The correction was conducted three times with different user interactions performed at different time periods, in order to evaluate both the efficiency and the robustness. The automatic segmentation results with the original average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.78 were improved to 0.865-0.872 after conducting 55-59 interactions by using the proposed method, where each editing procedure took less than 3 s. In addition, the proposed method obtained the most consistent editing results with respect to different user interactions, compared to other methods.  Conclusions:   The proposed method obtains robust editing results with few interactions for various wrong segmentation cases, by selecting the location-adaptive features and further imposing the manifold regularization. The authors expect the proposed method to largely reduce the laborious burdens of manual editing, as well as both the intra- and interobserver variability across clinicians.""","""['Sang Hyun Park', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Yinghuan Shi', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A semiautomatic segmentation method for prostate in CT images using local texture classification and statistical shape modeling.', 'Spatially varying accuracy and reproducibility of prostate segmentation in magnetic resonance images using manual and semiautomated methods.', 'Accuracy Validation of an Automated Method for Prostate Segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Beyond automatic medical image segmentation-the spectrum between fully manual and fully automatic delineation.', 'Peripheral blood smear image analysis: A comprehensive review.', 'An Adaptive Feature Selection Algorithm for Fuzzy Clustering Image Segmentation Based on Embedded Neighbourhood Information Constraints.', 'Graph-convolutional-network-based interactive prostate segmentation in MR images.', 'Deep learning enables automatic detection and segmentation of brain metastases on multisequence MRI.', 'Prostate zonal segmentation in 1.5T and 3T T2W MRI using a convolutional neural network.', 'Automatic segmentation of the prostate on CT images using deep learning and multi-atlas fusion.']"""

KIM is being piloted in a clinical trial for prostate cancer patients treated with VMAT (NCT01742403). The purpose of this work was to develop clinical process and quality assurance (QA) practices for the clinical implementation of KIM.  Methods:   Informed by and adapting existing guideline documents from other real-time monitoring systems, KIM-specific QA practices were developed. The following five KIM-specific QA tests were included: (1) static localization accuracy, (2) dynamic localization accuracy, (3) treatment interruption accuracy, (4) latency measurement, and (5) clinical conditions accuracy. Tests (1)-(4) were performed using KIM to measure static and representative patient-derived prostate motion trajectories using a 3D programmable motion stage supporting an anthropomorphic phantom with implanted gold markers to represent the clinical treatment scenario. The threshold for system tolerable latency is <1 s. The tolerances for all other tests are that both the mean and standard deviation of the difference between the programmed trajectory and the measured data are <1 mm.

The apoptotic rates of experimental RM‑1 cell groups were assessed by flow cytometry. A clonogenic growth array was used to evaluate the radiosensitivity of RM‑1 cell groups. The NF‑κB family member RelB was expressed at a high level in prostate cancer specimens. Compared with irradiated control cells, RM‑1 cells transfected with RelB siRNA and treated with radiation therapy demonstrated a significant downregulation of RelB expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus.

DNA hypermethylation is a frequent alteration in PCa, but interfocal heterogeneity of these changes has not been extensively investigated. Ten pairs of foci from multifocal PCa and 15 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples were obtained from prostatectomy specimens, resulting altogether in 35 samples. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was used to evaluate methylation status of nine tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), and a set of selected TSGs was quantitatively analyzed for methylation intensity by pyrosequencing. Promoter sequences of the RASSF1 and ESR1 genes were methylated in all paired PCa foci, and frequent (≥75 %) DNA methylation was detected in RARB, GSTP1, and ABCB1 genes. MSP revealed different methylation status of at least one gene in separate foci in 8 out of 10 multifocal tumors. The mean methylation level of ESR1, GSTP1, RASSF1, and RARB differed between the paired foci of all PCa cases. The intensity of DNA methylation in these TSGs was significantly higher in PCa cases than in BPH (p < 0.001). Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a divergent methylation profile of paired PCa foci, while the foci from separate cases with biochemical recurrence showed similar methylation profile and the highest mean levels of DNA methylation. Our findings suggest that PCa tissue is heterogeneous, as between paired foci differences in DNA methylation status were found.

Identification of functionally relevant predictive biomarkers for radioresponse in prostate cancer would enable radioresistant patients to be directed to more appropriate treatment options, avoiding the side-effects of radiotherapy.  Methods:   Using an in vitro model to screen for novel biomarkers of radioresistance, transcriptome analysis of a radioresistant (PC-3) and radiosensitive (LNCaP) prostate cancer cell line was performed. Following pathway analysis candidate genes were validated using qRT-PCR. The DNA repair pathway in radioresistant PC-3 cells was then targeted for radiation sensitization using the PARP inhibitor, niacinimide.  Results:   Opposing regulation of a DNA repair and replication pathway was observed between PC-3 and LNCaP cells from RNA-seq analysis. Candidate genes BRCA1, RAD51, FANCG, MCM7, CDC6 and ORC1 were identified as being significantly differentially regulated post-irradiation. qRT-PCR validation confirmed BRCA1, RAD51 and FANCG as being significantly differentially regulated at 24 hours post radiotherapy (p-value =0.003, 0.045 and 0.003 respectively). While the radiosensitive LNCaP cells down-regulated BRCA1, FANCG and RAD51, the radioresistant PC-3 cell line up-regulated these candidates to promote cell survival post-radiotherapy and a similar trend was observed for MCM7, CDC6 and ORC1. Inhibition of DNA repair using niacinamide sensitised the radioresistant cells to irradiation, reducing cell survival at 2 Gy from 66% to 44.3% (p-value =0.02).

The present study aimed to investigate the expression and epigenetic regulation of PLZF as well as its clinical significance in HCC. We found that the expression of PLZF was significantly downregulated in HCC samples at both the RNA level (P<0.001) and protein level compared with these levels in adjacent normal tissues. The relative expression level of PLZF was also positively correlated with the ALP level (P=0.026) noted in the HCC patients. However, hypermethylation was only detected in one out of 5 paired HCC samples, indicating that methylation of the selected promoter region (from -1702 to -1388) may not be the major regulatory mechanism for the downregulation of PLZF in HCC. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was created to evaluate the diagnostic value for differentiating between HCC and benign diseases. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for indicating the value of PLZF as an HCC biomarker was 0.794 (95% CI, 0.697-0.892; P<0.001).

The sensor is constructed by self-assembly of thiol-modified, redox species-labeled hairpin probes on the gold sensing electrode. The hybridizations between the target miRNAs and the surface-immobilized probes lead to the formation of RNA/DNA duplexes, and DSN subsequently cleaves the redox-labeled hairpin probes of the RNA/DNA duplexes to recycle the target miRNAs and to generate significantly amplified current suppression at different potentials for multiplexed detection of miRNA-141 and miRNA-21 down to 4.2 and 3.0 fM, respectively. The sensor is also highly selective toward the target miRNAs and can be employed to monitor miRNAs from human prostate carcinoma (22Rv1) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lysates simultaneously.

The results showed that both compounds were able to inhibit cell cycle progression in a dose-dependent manner. However, only DEHP was found to weakly reduce androgen receptor (AR) protein levels after long-term exposure, while only DBP partially inhibited expression of the prostate-specific antigen (KLK3) gene, a model AR transcriptional target. This indicated that inhibition of cell proliferation was likely independent of any AR modulations. Both phthalates induced suppression of cell proliferation, but none of them affected the levels of markers associated with neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NED) in LNCaP cells.

Methods:   HRQOL was examined with the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 1, and the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey in patients with selected cancers (kidney cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, upper gastrointestinal cancer, cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, melanoma, chronic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma) and in individuals without cancer on the basis of data linked from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry system and the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey. Scale scores, Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores, and a utility metric (Short Form 6D/Veterans RAND 6D), adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and other chronic conditions, were calculated.

To understand the controversies surrounding screening and to provide sound advice to patients, family physicians should be familiar with the fundamental concepts of screening. Failure to account for the effects of lead-time, length-time, and overdiagnosis biases can lead to overestimation of screening benefits. For this reason, the best method for evaluating the benefit of screening tests is a randomized controlled trial showing decreased disease-specific or all-cause mortality. The number needed to screen can be used to measure the magnitude of benefit of screening tests. Accepted screening tests often require screening several hundred to more than 1,000 asymptomatic patients to prevent one death from the disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend screening for colorectal cancer in adults 50 to 75 years of age, and recommend against prostate-specific antigen testing to screen for prostate cancer. Annual low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer reduces mortality in persons 55 to 80 years of age with at least a 30-pack-year history who are otherwise healthy smokers or who have quit smoking within the past 15 years; however, it is associated with a high false-positive rate, uncertain harms from radiation exposure, and overdiagnosis.

Materials and methods:   The cytological, biological, and molecular alterations were assessed with double immunohistochemistry, double fluorescent labeling, apoptosis assay, and gene expression profiling.  Results:   Our study detected several previously undescribed features: (i) over 95% of infiltrating immune cells were seen within normal, hyperplastic, or in situ cancer structures with focally-disrupted capsules, and fewer than 5% were found within invasive cancer; (ii) over 95% of normal, hyperplastic, and in situ cancerous epithelial cells were physically shielded from immune cells by the surrounding myoepithelial or basal cell layer; (iii) about 90% of myoepithelial or basal cells physically associated with immune cells and such residual cells within focally disrupted layers exhibited distinct degeneration, including apoptosis, necrosis, and reduced expression of tumor suppressor p63; (iv) epithelial cells overlying focally disrupted tumor capsules surrounded by immune cells had substantially higher proliferation than their adjacent counterparts, and some of the proliferating cells were arranged as tongue-like projections invading the stroma; and (v) microdissected cells overlying focally disrupted tumor capsules had more than 5-fold higher expression of stem cell lineage markers KIT and NCOR2.  Conclusion:   Tumor-infiltrating immune cells are primarily associated with degenerated myoepithelial or basal cells causing focal disruptions of the capsule, which selectively favor proliferation, invasion, and dissemination of the overlying tumor stem cells.""","""['Guohong Song', 'Hsuan Hsiao', 'Jinlian L Wang', 'Ciaran Mannion', 'Alexander Stojadinovic', 'Itzhak Avital', 'Sidney W Fu', 'Jeffrey Mason', 'Wen Chen', 'Anahid Jewett', 'Huiping Li', 'Yan-Gao Man']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Focal degeneration of basal cells and the resultant auto-immunoreactions: a novel mechanism for prostate tumor progression and invasion.', 'Destructive impact of T-lymphocytes, NK and Mast cells on basal cell layers: implications for tumor invasion.', 'Cell clusters overlying focally disrupted mammary myoepithelial cell layers and adjacent cells within the same duct display different immunohistochemical and genetic features: implications for tumor progression and invasion.', 'Myoepithelial cells: pathology, cell separation and markers of myoepithelial differentiation.', 'Clinicopathologic characteristics of basal cell carcinoma of the prostate: analysis of 5 cases and review of the literature.', 'Isogenic Mammary Models of Intraductal Carcinoma Reveal Progression to Invasiveness in the Absence of a Non-Obligatory In Situ Stage.', 'The most effective but largely ignored target for prostate cancer early detection and intervention.', 'Profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma neoantigens reveals immune microenvironment and clonal evolution related patterns.', 'Associations between tissue-based CD3+ T-lymphocyte count and colorectal cancer survival in a prospective cohort of older women.', 'The Combination of CD147 and MMP-9 Serum Levels Is Identified as Novel Chemotherapy Response Markers of Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   In vitro cell culture approach with biochemical tests and Western blot analyses was used.  Results:   Magnolol, (80 μM, 6 hour exposure) was found to affect the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and associated proteins. In both cell lines, protein expression of IGF-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) were significantly decreased, while protein expression of IGFBP-3 was significantly increased. Additionally, protein expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was significantly increased and the phosphorylated form of IGF-1 (p-IGF-1R) was significantly decreased in PC3 cells, while IGFBP-4 protein expression was significantly increased in LNCaP cells.

We also hypothesized that people with higher purpose would spend fewer nights in the hospital.

Materials and methods:   Between January 2007 and May 2011, 669 patients (mean 64 years; range 38-91 years) underwent a re-biopsy because of previous negative biopsy (median 1; 1-5) and persistently high prostate-specific antigen (PSA 10.6 ng/ml; 2.5-997.1 ng/ml). 3T MRI using a phased-array coil was performed in 171 (MRI group) but not in 498 (non-MRI group) prior to re-biopsy. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed in both MRI and non-MRI groups. MRI and non-MRI groups were compared in terms of cancer detection rate [(number of cancer-proven patients/number of patients in MRI or non-MRI group) × 100] and positive core rate [(number of cancer-positive cores/number of cores in MRI or non-MRI group) × 100] using Fisher exact test. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were also obtained. Pathologic diagnosis of the biopsy was considered standard reference.  Results:   Of 669 patients, 129 (19.3%) were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. The cancer detection rates of MRI and non-MRI groups were 33.3% (57/171) and 14.5% (72/498), respectively (p < 0.001). The positive core rates of these groups were 9.2% (167/1 818) and 3.2% (179/5 631), respectively (p < 0.001). The odd ratios of cancer detection rate and positive core rate were 3.0 (95% confidence interval 2.0-4.4) and 3.1 (2.5-3.8), respectively.  Conclusion:   Re-biopsy with preceded MRI yields higher cancer detection rate and positive core rate than re-biopsy without preceded MRI.

A MoS2 nanosheet is a two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterial analogous to graphene. However, a MoS2 nanosheet has a higher fluorescence-quenching ability than graphene when applied to a dye-labeled single-stranded DNA probe. In this work, we propose a novel aptamer-functionalized MoS2 nanosheet fluorescent biosensor that detects PSA. The binding of the aptamer to the target PSA induces a rigid aptamer structure which makes the integration with the MoS2 nanosheet very weak. This results in the release of the aptamer probe from the nanosheet surface and restores the quenched fluorescence. This approach has the advantage of simple design and rapid detection of PSA. The biosensor has the merits of high sensitivity and high selectivity with a detection limit for the PSA of 0.2 ng/mL. The biosensor was also successfully applied to the detection of PSA in human serum samples with satisfactory results. The foregoing indicates its promising application to real-life biological samples.""","""['Rong-Mei Kong', 'Lu Ding', 'Zhijie Wang', 'Jinmao You', 'Fengli Qu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anal Bioanal Chem""","""['Single-layer MoS2-based nanoprobes for homogeneous detection of biomolecules.', 'Highly sensitive protein detection via covalently linked aptamer to MoS2 and exonuclease-assisted amplification strategy.', 'Functionalized MoS(2) nanosheet-based field-effect biosensor for label-free sensitive detection of cancer marker proteins in solution.', 'Application of various optical and electrochemical aptasensors for detection of human prostate specific antigen: A review.', 'A comprehensive review on nano-molybdenum disulfide/DNA interfaces as emerging biosensing platforms.', 'Two-Dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Based Biosensors: From Fundamentals to Healthcare Applications.', 'Emerging 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D nanostructures for efficient point-of-care biosensing.', 'Nanomaterial based aptasensors for clinical and environmental diagnostic applications.', 'Molybdenum Disulfide-Based Nanoprobes: Preparation and Sensing Application.', 'Highly portable quantitative screening test for prostate-specific antigen at point of care.']"""

We sought to determine whether biopsy and radical prostatectomy (RP) PNI are associated with adverse outcomes. A secondary objective was to determine whether prostate biopsy PNI should alter surgical technique.  Methods:   Patients were categorized by PNI on biopsy and RP specimens. Associations between PNI, clinicopathologic characteristics, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates were assessed.  Results:   A total of 2,500 patients undergoing open RP by a single-surgeon from 1999 to 2011 were analyzed. In unadjusted univariate analyses, biopsy PNI was significantly associated with Gleason score, clinical stage, positive surgical margins, extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), positive lymph nodes, and BCR (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, EPE (p < 0.001), and SVI (p = 0.022) remained associated with biopsy PNI. Biopsy PNI was not associated with positive margins at RP (OR 1.3, 95 % CI 0.92-1.9). The presence of PNI in the final RP specimen conferred a greater than 4 times increased odds of positive margin (OR 4.6, 95 % CI 2.30-9.22; p < 0.0001). Men with PNI on biopsy were 1.5 times more likely to experience BCR (OR 1.5, 1.06-2.01). PNI on biopsy or RP specimens was not associated with overall survival.  Conclusions:   In men undergoing open RP for clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma, biopsy PNI is associated with an increased risk of BCR. PNI on prostate biopsy was not associated with positive surgical margins after adjusting for related co-variables. The presence of PNI on prostate biopsy should not preclude utilization of a nerve-sparing approach.""","""['Benjamin T Ristau', 'Jeffrey J Tomaszewski', 'Yi-Fan Chen', 'Marnie Bertolet', 'Elen Woldemichael', 'Joel B Nelson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Prognostic significance of perineural invasion in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Evidence of perineural invasion on prostate biopsy specimen and survival after radical prostatectomy.', 'Perineural invasion on prostate biopsy does not predict adverse pathological outcome.', 'Multiple measures of carcinoma extent versus perineural invasion in prostate needle biopsy tissue in prediction of pathologic stage in a screening population.', 'Prognostic significance of lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Investigating association of perineural invasion on prostate biopsy with Gleason score upgrading at prostatectomy: A multi-institutional analysis.', 'Integration of MRI to clinical nomogram for predicting pathological stage before radical prostatectomy.']"""

This study validated the risk assessment at a single institution.  Methods:   We studied 255 prostate cancer patients given primary androgen deprivation therapy. Progression-free survival, cause-specific survival and overall survival were analyzed according to Japan Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score-based risk classification. Cases with lymph node or distant metastases were subdivided by the risk classification.  Results:   Ages ranged from 50 to 90 years (median: 76.5). Observation periods were 2-199 (median: 46.5) months. Primary androgen deprivation therapy includes combined androgen blockade in 150 cases (58.8%), uncombined luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist in 97 (38.0%) and uncombined anti-androgenic agent in 8 (3.2%). Risk classified by Japan Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment scores was low in 104 cases (40.8%), intermediate in 86 (33.7%) and high in 65 (25.5%).

Experimental design:   Four PET tracers [(18)F-FDG, (18)F-Fpp(RGD)2, (18)F-FLT, and (18)F-FAZA] were assessed for uptake into tumor xenografts of drug-responsive (H460, PC3) or drug-resistant (786-0) carcinoma cells. Mice were treated with BAY 87-2243 or vehicle. At each point, RNA from treated and vehicle H460 tumor xenografts (n = 3 each) was isolated and analyzed for target genes.  Results:   Significant changes in uptake of (18)F-FAZA, (18)F-FLT, and (18)F-Fpp(RGD)2 (P < 0.01) occurred with BAY 87-2243 treatment with (18)F-FAZA being the most prominent.

(18)F-FAZA tumor uptake declined by 55% to 70% (1.21% ± 0.10%ID/g to 0.35 ± 0.1%ID/g; n = 6, vehicle vs. treatment) in both H460 (P < 0.001) and PC3 (P < 0.05) xenografts 1 to 3 days after drug administration. (18)F-FAZA uptake in 786-0 xenografts was unaffected. Decline occurred before significant differences in tumor volume, thus suggesting (18)F-FAZA decrease reflected early changes in tumor metabolism. BAY 87-2243 reduced expression of hypoxia-regulated genes CA IX, ANGPTL4, and EGLN-3 by 99%, 93%, and 83%, respectively (P < 0.001 for all), which corresponds with reduced (18)F-FAZA uptake upon drug treatment. Heterogeneous expression of genes associated with glucose metabolism, vessel density, and proliferation was observed.

In murine tumors with Met amplification, Met copy-number gain and expression was present in some cells but not others, revealing intratumoral heterogeneity. Forced MET overexpression in non-MET-amplified prostate tumor cells activated PI3K and MAPK signaling and promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth, whereas MET kinase inhibition selectively impaired the growth of tumors with Met amplification.

Here, we report that darinaparsin, an organic derivative of arsenic trioxide, is cytotoxic to prostate cancer cell lines as well as fresh prostate cancer cells from patients at low micromolar concentrations, and importantly inhibits the TIC subpopulations. It also inhibits growth of the castrate-resistant Du145 prostate tumor propagated as xenograft in mice and inhibits the tumor-initiating potential of prostate cancer cells. Although the mechanism by which darinaparsin acts is not completely known, we show that it kills prostate cancer cells by blocking cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle and inhibits Hedgehog signaling by downregulating Gli-2 transcriptional activity.

Despite the ability of C-type lectin domains (CTLD) to modulate cell-cell adhesion, it is not known if they modulate epithelial adhesion in EMT and tumor progression. Here, the multi-CTLD mannose receptor, Endo180 (MRC2/uPARAP), was shown using the Kaplan-Meier analysis to be predictive of survival outcome in men with early prostate cancer. A proteomic screen of novel interaction partners with the fourth CTLD (CTLD4) in Endo180 revealed that its complex with CD147 is indispensable for the stability of three-dimensional acini formed by nontransformed prostate epithelial cells (PEC). Mechanistic study using knockdown of Endo180 or CD147, and treatment with an Endo180 mAb targeting CTLD4 (clone 39.10), or a dominant-negative GST-CTLD4 chimeric protein, induced scattering of PECs associated with internalization of Endo180 into endosomes, loss of E-cadherin (CDH1/ECAD), and unzipping of cell-cell junctions. These findings are the first to demonstrate that a CTLD acts as a suppressor and regulatory switch for EMT; thus, positing that stabilization of Endo180-CD147 complex is a viable therapeutic strategy to improve rates of prostate cancer survival.

T-cadherin-dependent effects were associated with changes in cell phenotype: overexpression caused cell dissemination and loss of polarity evaluated by relative positioning of the Golgi/nuclei in cell groups, whereas silencing caused formation of compact polarized epithelial-like clusters. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and IGF factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) were identified as mediators of T-cadherin effects. These receptors per se had opposing influences on cell phenotype. EGFR activation with EGF or IGF-1R inhibition with NVP-AEW541 promoted dissemination, invasion, and polarity loss. Conversely, inhibition of EGFR with gefitinib or activation of IGF-1R with IGF-1 rescued epithelial morphology and decreased invasion. T-cadherin silencing enhanced both EGFR and IGF-1R phosphorylation, yet converted cells to the morphology typical for activated IGF-1R.

Methods:   We carry out a stylized model to analyze the decision health authorities face when they do not have perfect information about the best treatment for a population of patients with a given disease. The health authorities decide whether to use a test to match patients with treatments (personalized medicine) to maximize health outcomes. Our model characterizes the situations under which personalized medicine dominates the alternative option of business-as-usual (treatment without previous test). We apply the model to the KRAS test for colorectal cancer, the PCA3 test for prostate cancer and the PCR test for the X-fragile syndrome, to illustrate how the parameters and variables of the model interact.  Results:   Implementation of personalized medicine requires, as a necessary condition, having some tests with high discriminatory power. This is not a sufficient condition and expected health outcomes must be taken into account to make a decision. When the specificity and the sensitivity of the test are low, the health authority prefers to apply a treatment to all patients without using the test. When both characteristic of the test are high, the health authorities prefer to personalize the treatments when expected health outcomes are better than those under the standard treatment. When we applied the model to the three aforementioned tests, the results illustrate how decisions are adopted in real world.  Conclusions:   Although promising, the use of personalized medicine is still under scrutiny as there are important issues demanding a response.

Using ROC analysis RI outperformed tPSA in prediction of PCa in all patients [area under ROC curve (AUC) = 0.83, 0.78, respectively]. With the cutoff value of 0.73, RI discriminated PCa from non-PCa patients with 81.9% sensitivity, 75.9% specificity and 77.63% diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, The AUC for RI in the discrimination of PCa from non-PCa patients in a subset with PSA of 4 to 10 ng/ml, high grade from non-high grade PCa patients and advanced from localized PCa patients was 0.70, 0.77 and 0.80, higher than other parameters (p < 0.05).

Despite the minimal understanding of their modes of action, natural products and herbal therapies have been commonly used in the prevention and treatment of many cancers. Berberis libanotica Ehrenb (BLE) is a plant rich in alkaloids which may possess anti-cancer activity and a high potential for eliminating CSCs. We tested the effect of BLE on prostate cancer cells and our data indicated that this extract induced significant reduction in cell viability and inhibited the proliferation of human prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3 and 22Rv1) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. BLE extract induced a perturbation of the cell cycle, leading to a G0-G1 arrest. Furthermore, we noted 50% cell death, characterized by the production of high levels of reactive oxidative species (ROS). Inhibition of cellular migration and invasion was also achieved upon treatment with BLE extract, suggesting a role in inhibiting metastasis. Interestingly, BLE extract had a major effect on CSCs. Cells were grown in a 3D sphere-formation assay to enrich for a population of cancer stem/progenitor cells. Our results showed a significant reduction in sphere formation ability.

This system allows us to consistently control for the presence or absence of an apoptotic core in the 3D cancer microaggregates. Similar to tumor tissues, the 3D microaggregates display poor polarity. Critically the response of 3D microaggregates to the chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel, is more consistent with in vivo results than the equivalent 2D controls.

Methods and results:   Androgen-dependent LAPC-4 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with low doses of Arc and Q alone or in combination for 48 h. The antiproliferative activity of Arc was 10- to 20-fold stronger than Q in both cell lines. Their combination synergistically enhanced the antiproliferative effect, with a stronger effect in androgen receptor (AR) wild-type LAPC-4 cells than in AR mutated LNCaP cells. Arc demonstrated a strong ability to inhibit AR protein expression in LAPC-4 cells. The combination treatment significantly inhibited both AR and PI3K/Akt pathways compared to control. A protein array analysis revealed that the mixture targets multiple pathways particularly in LAPC-4 cells including Stat3 pathway. The mixture significantly inhibited the expression of several oncogenic microRNAs including miR-21, miR-19b, and miR-148a compared to control.

Knockdown of LRPPRC by siRNA significantly inhibited the invasion and promoted the apoptosis of PCa cells. In addition, downregulation of LRPPRC expression resulted in the reduced expression of Bcl-2, upregulation of Bax, and cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3. Taken together, these results show that the downregulation of LRPRPC expression induces apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated pathway in PCa cells.

ETS factors control the expression of genes involved in many biological processes, such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. FLI1 is an ETS protein aberrantly expressed in retrovirus-induced hematological tumors, but limited attention has been directed towards elucidating the role of FLI1 in epithelial-derived cancers. Using data mining, we show that loss of FLI1 expression is associated with shorter survival and more aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer. Gain and loss of function cellular studies indicate the inhibitory effect of FLI1 expression on cellular growth, migration, and invasion. Using Fli1 mutant mice and both a transgenic murine breast cancer model and an orthotopic injection of syngeneic tumor cells indicates that reduced Fli1 contributes to accelerated tumor growth. Global expression analysis and RNA-Seq data from an invasive human breast cancer cell line with over expression of either FLI1 and another ETS gene, PDEF, shows changes in several cellular pathways associated with cancer, such as the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. This study demonstrates a novel role for FLI1 in epithelial cells.

Accumulated evidence, however, indicates that tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are also critically important for proMMP-9 delivery, especially at early stages of tumor development. To clarify how much angiogenic proMMP-9 is actually contributed by TAMs and TANs, we quantitatively evaluated TAMs and TANs from different tumor types, including human xenografts and syngeneic murine tumors grown in wild-type and Mmp9-knockout mice. Whereas host MMP-9 competence was required for full angiogenic potential of both normal and tumor-associated leukocytes, direct comparisons of neutrophils versus macrophages and TANs versus TAMs demonstrated that macrophages and TAMs secrete 40- to 50-fold less proMMP-9 than the same numbers of neutrophils or TANs. Correspondingly, the levels of MMP-9-mediated in vivo angiogenesis induced by neutrophils and TANs substantially exceeded those induced by macrophages and TAMs. MMP-9-delivering TANs were also required for development of metastasis-supporting intratumoral vasculature, characterized by ≥ 11-μm size lumens and partial coverage with stabilizing pericytes. Importantly, MMP-9-producing TAMs exhibit M2-skewed phenotype but do not express tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), a novel characteristic allowing them to secrete TIMP-1-free, neutrophil-like MMP-9 zymogen unencumbered by its natural inhibitor. Together, our findings support the notion whereby TANs, capable of immediate release of their pre-stored cargo, are the major contributors of highly angiogenic MMP-9, whereas tumor-influxing precursors of macrophages require time to differentiate, polarize into M2-skewed TAMs, shut down their TIMP-1 expression, and only then, initiate relatively low-level production of TIMP-free MMP-9 zymogen.""","""['Elena I Deryugina', 'Ewa Zajac', 'Anna Juncker-Jensen', 'Tatyana A Kupriyanova', 'Lisa Welter', 'James P Quigley']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Angiogenic capacity of M1- and M2-polarized macrophages is determined by the levels of TIMP-1 complexed with their secreted proMMP-9.', 'Human neutrophils uniquely release TIMP-free MMP-9 to provide a potent catalytic stimulator of angiogenesis.', 'Neutrophil MMP-9 proenzyme, unencumbered by TIMP-1, undergoes efficient activation in vivo and catalytically induces angiogenesis via a basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2)/FGFR-2 pathway.', 'The roles of tumor-associated macrophages in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.', 'Significance of Immunosuppressive Cells as a Target for Immunotherapies in Melanoma and Non-Melanoma Skin Cancers.', 'The Significance of CXCL1 and CXCR1 as Potential Biomarkers of Colorectal Cancer.', 'The double-edged role of neutrophil heterogeneity in inflammatory diseases and cancers.', 'Circulating and Tumor-Associated Neutrophils in the Era of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: Dynamics, Phenotypes, Metabolism, and Functions.', 'Neutrophil elastase: From mechanisms to therapeutic potential.', 'NETosis as an oncologic therapeutic target: a mini review.']"""

Analysis of 1184 genotyped and imputed SNPs in 6608 Caucasian cases and 37 925 controls, and 895 Asian cases and 1968 controls, revealed the best signal of association for SNP rs11263763 (P = 8.4 × 10(-14), odds ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.82-0.89), located within HNF1B intron 1.

Genetic analyses prioritized rs11263763 and four other SNPs in high-to-moderate linkage disequilibrium as the most likely causal SNPs. Three of these SNPs map to the extended HNF1B promoter based on chromatin marks extending from the minimal promoter region. Reporter assays demonstrated that this extended region reduces activity in combination with the minimal HNF1B promoter, and that the minor alleles of rs11263763 or rs8064454 are associated with decreased HNF1B promoter activity.

In particular, we described the use of Epidaurus to (i) integrate epigenetic data from prostate cancer cell lines to validate the activation function of EZH2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer and to (ii) study the mechanism of androgen receptor (AR) binding deregulation induced by the knockdown of FOXA1. We found that EZH2's noncanonical activation function was reaffirmed by its association with active histone markers and the lack of association with repressive markers. More importantly, we revealed that the binding of AR was selectively reprogramed to promoter regions, leading to the up-regulation of hundreds of cancer-associated genes including EGFR.

We qualitatively and quantitatively estimated the effect of 25 μM FF on the events which accompany prostate carcinoma cell diapedesis, with the special emphasis on endothelial cell mobilization.  Results:   Fenofibrate attenuated cancer cell diapedesis via augmenting endothelial cell adhesion to the substratum rather than through the effect on intercellular communication networks within the metastatic niche. The inhibition of endothelial cell motility was accompanied by the activation of PPARα-dependent and PPARα-independent reactive oxygen species signaling, Akt and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, in the absence of cytotoxic effects in endothelial cells.

Based on the results of various multivariable regression models there was no significant influence of obesity on pathological tumour stage, pN category, undifferentiated tumour growth (≥ GS7b), upgrading, or PSM rates. Furthermore, obese patients showed a significantly higher intraoperative blood loss and a higher length of surgery, which, however, did not result in a higher rate of grade 3a/b complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification after 90 days.  Conclusions:   In the present series of consecutive patients undergoing RARP there was no evidence for a more aggressive tumour biology or a higher complication rate in obese patients.""","""['C Gilfrich', 'A Haferkamp', 'S Brookman-May', 'A Ahmed', 'J Peter', 'M Eckerl', 'C Schäfer', 'S Lebentrau', 'M May']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Impact of body mass index on outcomes of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with long-term follow-up.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy outcomes in obese and extremely obese men.', 'Postoperative Leukocytosis After Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Is Not Associated with Perioperative Outcome and Histopathological Findings.', 'Pre-biopsy 3-Tesla MRI and targeted biopsy of the index prostate cancer: correlation with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Pitfalls of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a comparison of positive surgical margins between robotic and laparoscopic surgery.', 'Obesity leads to a higher rate of positive surgical margins in the context of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

We studied the relation of three objectively determined allergy markers with cancer mortality and hospitalization risk.  Methods:   Associations between three allergy markers (number of peripheral blood eosinophil counts, skin test positivity, and serum total IgE) with mortality and hospitalization from any type and four common types of cancer (lung, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer) were assessed in the Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen cohort (1965-1990), with follow-up of mortality until 31 December 2008. Hospitalization data were available since 1 January 1995.  Results:   There were no significant associations between objective allergy markers and cancer mortality or hospitalization. We found several associations in specific subgroups. A higher number of eosinophils was associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer mortality in ever smokers HR (95 % CI) = 0.61 (0.45-0.83) and in males 0.59 (0.42-0.83); however, no overall association was observed 0.84 (0.64-1.09). Skin test positivity was associated with a decreased risk of any cancer mortality only among females 0.59 (0.38-0.91) and showed no overall association 0.83 (0.67-1.04). Serum total IgE levels were associated with an increased risk of lung cancer mortality among females 4.64 (1.04-20.70), but with a decreased risk of cancer hospitalization in ever smokers 0.77 (0.61-0.97) and males 0.72 (0.55-0.93); however, no overall associations were observed [mortality 0.99 (0.79-1.25), and hospitalization 0.86 (0.71-1.04)].  Conclusions:   We found no associations between objective allergy markers and cancer in the total population. However, skin test positivity and a high number of eosinophils were associated with a reduced risk to die of cancer in specific subgroups.

Methods:   We used unconditional logistic regression to evaluate the association of 96 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 12 circadian-related genes with fatal prostate cancer in the AGES-Reykjavik cohort (n = 24 cases), the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) (n = 40 cases), and the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) (n = 105 cases).

In a recent screen for mediators of resistance to IGF-1R inhibitor AZ12253801, we identified RAD51, required for the strand invasion step of HR. These findings prompted us to test the hypothesis that IGF-1R-inhibited cells accumulate DSBs formed at endogenous DNA lesions, and depend on residual HR for their repair. Indeed, initial experiments showed time-dependent accumulation of γH2AX foci in IGF-1R -inhibited or -depleted prostate cancer cells. We then tested effects of suppressing HR, and found that RAD51 depletion enhanced AZ12253801 sensitivity in PTEN wild-type prostate cancer cells but not in cells lacking functional PTEN. Similar sensitization was induced in prostate cancer cells by depletion of BRCA2, required for RAD51 loading onto DNA, and in BRCA2(-/-) colorectal cancer cells, compared with isogenic BRCA2(+/-) cells. We also assessed chemical HR inhibitors, finding that RAD51 inhibitor BO2 blocked RAD51 focus formation and sensitized to AZ12253801. Finally, we tested CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306, which impairs HR by inhibiting CDK1-mediated BRCA1 phosphorylation. R0-3306 suppressed RAD51 focus formation consistent with HR attenuation, and sensitized prostate cancer cells to IGF-1R inhibition, with 2.4-fold reduction in AZ12253801 GI50 and 13-fold reduction in GI80. These data suggest that responses to IGF-1R inhibition are enhanced by genetic and chemical approaches to suppress HR, defining a population of cancers (PTEN wild-type, BRCA mutant) that may be intrinsically sensitive to IGF-1R inhibitory drugs.""","""['Kunal A Lodhia', 'Shan Gao', 'Tamara Aleksic', 'Fumiko Esashi', 'Valentine M Macaulay']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['IGF-1R inhibition enhances radiosensitivity and delays double-strand break repair by both non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination.', 'Depletion of the type 1 IGF receptor delays repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks.', 'Suppression of Homologous Recombination by insulin-like growth factor-1 inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitors.', 'Therapeutic exploitation of tumor cell defects in homologous recombination.', 'Homologous recombination and human health: the roles of BRCA1, BRCA2, and associated proteins.', 'CHK1 inhibition exacerbates replication stress induced by IGF blockade.', 'Nuclear IGF1R interact with PCNA to preserve DNA replication after DNA-damage in a variety of human cancers.', 'Insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling in tumorigenesis and drug resistance: a challenge for cancer therapy.', 'Targeting DNA Double-Strand Break Repair Pathways to Improve Radiotherapy Response.', 'The impact of the IGF-1 system of cancer cells on radiation response - An in vitro study.']"""

In the absence of SYK expression, cell surface levels of the progression-associated adhesion receptors integrin α2β1 and CD44 were diminished.

Methods:   In our cohort of AS patients, 157 were diagnosed with unilateral PCa. Using five different definitions of UDF, patients' data were used to simulate the theoretical outcome whether these patients were managed by immediate unilateral HAT or remained on AS.  Results:   The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 67 years (range 47-81). The median follow-up was 5.4 years [interquartile range (IQR) 3.4-8]. Baseline characteristics included a median PSA value of 5.5 ng/ml (IQR 4.5-7), median number of biopsy taken of 10 (IQR 6-10), and maximum cancer percentage on any core of 10 (IQR 5-20). Of the 157 patients, 144 (92 %) had a Gleason score (GS) of ≤6. Using the whole range of definition for UDF, 10-47 % of patients developed UDF while under AS. Using baseline GS, maximum percentage of cancer on any core, and PSA density, we found significant trends for higher development of UDF for patients under AS.  Conclusion:   The majority of our patients did not develop UDF while under AS.

To explore its role in prostate cancer (PCa), we detected its expression patterns in prostate tissues and PCa cells, and determined its anti-proliferation functions in PCa cells in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   The expression of CMTM5 in prostate tissue microarray, specimens and cell lines was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively. After being transfected with CMTM5 adenovirus or vector, the proliferation and migration of DU145 cells were detected by MTT assay and transwell assay, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of CMTM5 on tumor growth were performed in nude mice xenograft in vivo.  Results:   We found CMTM5 was reduced in PCa tissues and cells compared with BPH tissues, and its expression in PCa tissues was related to the Gleason score. Moreover, after being transfected with adenovirus, ectopic expression of CMTM5-v1 in DU145 cells led to significant inhibition of cell proliferation and migration compared with the control, which may be attributed to decreased Akt activity. Finally, restoration of CMTM5 significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that CMTM5 is down-regulated in PCa and exhibit tumor suppressor activities in androgen-independent PCa cells. Loss of CMTM5 protein may be contributed to the development of PCa and it is a potential therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Y Xiao', 'Y Yuan', 'Y Zhang', 'J Li', 'Z Liu', 'X Zhang', 'Z Sheng', 'T Xu', 'X Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['CMTM3 is reduced in prostate cancer and inhibits migration, invasion and growth of LNCaP cells.', 'CMTM5 inhibits the development of prostate cancer via the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Expression and significance of CMTM5 and epidermal growth factor receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Research advances in CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing member 5.', 'Research Advances in CKLFSF-like MARVEL Transmembrane Domain Containing Member 3.', 'CMTM Family and Gastrointestinal Tract Cancers: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Progressive axonopathy when oligodendrocytes lack the myelin protein CMTM5.', 'CMTM Family Genes Affect Prognosis and Modulate Immunocytes Infiltration in Grade II/III Glioma Patients by Influencing the Tumor Immune Landscape and Activating Associated Immunosuppressing Pathways.', 'Oncogenic and tumor suppressor genes expression in myeloproliferative neoplasms: The hidden side of a complex pathology.', 'GPX7 Is Targeted by miR-29b and GPX7 Knockdown Enhances Ferroptosis Induced by Erastin in Glioma.']"""

Assessing long-term radiotherapy-induced toxicity is important. We evaluated the impact of implementing different rectal dose volume constraints (DVC) on late rectal and urinary toxicity.  Material and methods:   Six hundred and thirty-seven PC patients were treated with high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in the primary (median dose of 78 Gy to the prostate) or postoperative setting [median dose of 74 (adjuvant) and 76 Gy (salvage) to the prostatic bed]. Three groups were defined according to different DVC applied over time. The incidence of late rectal and urinary toxicity was evaluated. Three-year actuarial risk estimations of grade 2-3 rectal and urinary toxicity were calculated (Kaplan-Meier statistics).  Results:   Median follow-up was five years. Overall, the incidence of late grade 3 and 2 rectal toxicity was 1% and 11%. The calculated three-year actuarial risk of developing late grade≥2 rectal toxicity decreased from 16% to 7% and 5% for patients in Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3, respectively (p<0.001). Respectively, 17 (4%) and 98 (24%) patients developed grade 3 and 2 late urinary toxicity in the primary setting. In the postoperative setting, 15 (6%) and 62 (26%) patients developed grade 3 and 2 urinary toxicity, respectively. The three-year actuarial risk of developing late≥grade 2 urinary toxicity in primary- and postoperative-treated patients was 22% and 23%, respectively.

Whether models based on in vitro/in vivo RBE data can be used to predict human response to treatments is an open issue. In this work an alternative method, based on an effective radiobiological parameterization directly derived from clinical data, is presented. The method has been applied to the analysis of prostate cancer trials with protons and carbon ions.Prostate cancer trials with proton and carbon ion beams reporting 5 year-local control (LC5) and grade 2 (G2) or higher genitourinary toxicity rates (TOX) were selected from literature to test the method. Treatment simulations were performed on a representative subset of patients to produce dose and linear energy transfer distribution, which were used as explicative physical variables for the radiobiological modelling. Two models were taken into consideration: the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM) and a linear model (LM). The radiobiological parameters of the LM and MKM were obtained by coupling them with the tumor control probability and normal tissue complication probability models to fit the LC5 and TOX data through likelihood maximization. The model ranking was based on the Akaike information criterion.Results showed large confidence intervals due to the limited variety of available treatment schedules. RBE values, such as RBE = 1.1 for protons in the treated volume, were derived as a by-product of the method, showing a consistency with current approaches. Carbon ion RBE values were also derived, showing lower values than those assumed for the original treatment planning in the target region, whereas higher values were found in the bladder.

Objective:   To obtain estimates of survival for some cancers recognized as a public health priority in Colombia using data from the Cancer Registry of Cali for 1995-2004.  Methods:   ALL CANCER CASES FOR RESIDENTS OF CALI WERE INCLUDED FOR THE FOLLOWING SITES: breast (3,984), cervix uteri (2,469), prostate (3,999), stomach (3,442) and lung (2,170). Five-year relative survival estimates were calculated using the approach described by Estève.  Results:   Five-year relative survival was 79% in patients with prostate cancer and 68% and 60% in women with breast or cervix uteri cancer, respectively. The cure fraction was close to zero in subjects with lung cancer and less than 10% in those with stomach cancer. The probability of dying from breast or prostate cancer in people in the lower socio-economic strata (SES) was 1.8 and 2.6 times, respectively, when compared to upper SES, p <0.001. Excess mortality associated with cancer was independent of age in prostate or breast cancer. After adjusting for age, sex and SES, the risk of dying from breast, cervix uteri, prostate and lung cancer during the 2000-2004 period decreased 19%, 13%, 48% and 16%, respectively, when compared with the period of 1995-1999. There was no change in the prognosis for patients with stomach cancer.  Conclusions:   Survival for some kinds of cancer improved through the 1995-2004 period, however health care programs for cancer patients in Cali are inequitable.

Guided by self-regulation theory, the present study examined the cognitive and affective processes involved in shared decision making between physicians and patients who experience a rising PSA after definitive treatment for prostate cancer.  Methods:   In-depth interviews were conducted with 34 prostate cancer survivors who had been diagnosed with a rising PSA (i.e., biochemical failure) within the past 12 months. Survivors were asked about their experiences and affective responses after being diagnosed with a rising PSA and while weighing potential treatment options. In addition, patients were asked about their decision-making process for the initial prostate cancer treatment.  Results:   Compared with the initial diagnosis, survivors with a rising PSA reported increased negative affect following their diagnosis, concern about the treatability of their disease, increased planning and health behavior change, heightened levels of worry preceding doctor appointments (especially prior to the discussion of PSA testing results), and a strong reliance on physicians' treatment recommendations.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer survivors' decision-making processes for the treatment of a rising PSA are markedly different from those of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer. Because patients experience heightened distress and rely more heavily on their physicians' recommendations with a rising PSA, interactions with the health care provider provide an excellent opportunity to address and assist patients with managing the uncertainty and distress inherent with rising PSA levels.""","""['Megan Johnson Shen', 'Christian J Nelson', 'Ellen Peters', 'Susan F Slovin', 'Simon J Hall', 'Matt Hall', 'Phapichaya Chaoprang Herrera', 'Elaine A Leventhal', 'Howard Leventhal', 'Michael A Diefenbach']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""[""Factors influencing primary care physicians' decision to order prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for men without prostate cancer."", 'Treatment Decision Regret Among Long-Term Survivors of Localized Prostate Cancer: Results From the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study.', ""Prostate cancer survivors' beliefs about screening and treatment decision-making experiences in an era of controversy."", 'Methodology of patient care for elevated PSA after prostate cancer treatment: A primary care perspective.', 'Rising PSA in nonmetastatic prostate cancer.', 'Factors influencing decisions people with motor neuron disease make about gastrostomy placement and ventilation: A qualitative evidence synthesis.', 'How should decision aids be developed, and which patient outcomes should be assessed?', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'Patient and caregiver benefit-risk preferences for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment.', 'The Impact of Perceived Etiology, Treatment Type, and Wording of Treatment Information on the Assessment of Gastritis Treatments.']"""

To improve early-detection biopsy decisions, the National Cancer Institute conducted a prospective validation trial to assess the diagnostic performance of the prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) urinary assay for the detection of prostate cancer among men screened with PSA.  Patients and methods:   In all, 859 men (mean age, 62 years) from 11 centers scheduled for a diagnostic prostate biopsy between December 2009 and June 2011 were enrolled. The primary outcomes were to assess whether PCA3 could improve the positive predictive value (PPV) for an initial biopsy (at a score > 60) and the negative predictive value (NPV) for a repeat biopsy (at a score < 20).  Results:   For the detection of any cancer, PPV was 80% (95% CI, 72% to 86%) in the initial biopsy group, and NPV was 88% (95% CI, 81% to 93%) in the repeat biopsy group. The addition of PCA3 to individual risk estimation models (which included age, race/ethnicity, prior biopsy, PSA, and digital rectal examination) improved the stratification of cancer and of high-grade cancer.  Conclusion:   These data independently support the role of PCA3 in reducing the burden of prostate biopsies among men undergoing a repeat prostate biopsy.

They can either upregulate or downregulate gene expression, and play key roles in the progression of various human cancers. However, the functional mechanisms of most lncRNAs still remain unknown at present. This paper aims to provide space for the understanding of lncRNAs by proposing a new method to obtain protein-coding genes (PCGs) regulated by lncRNAs, thus identifying candidate cancer-related lncRNAs using bioinformatics approaches. This study presents a method based on sample correlation, which is applied to the expression profiles of lncRNAs and PCGs in prostate cancer in combination with protein interaction data to build a lncRNA-PCG bipartite network. Candidate cancer-related lncRNAs were extracted from the bipartite network by using a random walk. 14 prostate cancer-related lncRNAs were acquired from the LncRNADisease database and MNDR, of which 6 lncRNAs were present in our network. As one of the seed nodes, ENSG00000234741 achieved the highest score among them. The other two cancer-related lncRNAs (ENSG00000225937 and ENSG00000236830) were ranked within the top 30. In addition, the top candidate lncRNA ENSG00000261777 shares an intron with DDX19, and interacts with IGF2 P1, indicating its involvement in prostate cancer. In this paper, we described a new method for predicting candidate lncRNA targets, and obtained candidate therapeutic targets using this method.

CBCT's and kV/kV imaging were performed before and additional CBCT's after treatment assessing intra-fraction motion. CTVP for 5 patients with LR and CTVPSV for 5 patients with IR/HR prostate cancer were contoured independently by 3 radiation oncologists using MRI. The van Hark formula (PTV margin =2.5Σ +0.7σ) was applied to calculate PTV margins of prostate/seminal vesicles (P/PSV) using CBCT or FM.  Results:   172 and 52 CBCTs before and after RT and 507 kV/kV images before RT were analysed. Differences between FM in CBCT or in planar kV image pairs were below 1 mm. Accounting for both random and systematic uncertainties anisotropic PTV margins were 5-8 mm for P (LR) and 6-11 mm for PSV (IR/HR). Random uncertainties like intra-fraction and inter-fraction (setup) uncertainties were of similar magnitude (0.9-1.4 mm). Largest uncertainty was introduced by CTV delineation (LR: 1-2 mm, IR/HR: 1.6-3.5 mm). Patient positioning using bone matching or ERB-matching resulted in larger PTV margins.  Conclusions:   For IGRT CBCT or kV/kV-image pairs with FM are interchangeable in respect of accuracy. Especially for hypofractionated RT, PTV margins can be kept in the range of 5 mm or below if stringent daily IGRT, ideally including prostate tracking, is applied.

We have previously demonstrated that changes in PSA kinetics correlate with metastasis-free survival; however, it is unknown whether these changes also correlate with overall survival (OS).  Methods:   We performed a combined retrospective analysis of 146 men with BRPC treated on phase-2 trials using one of four investigational drugs: lenalidomide (n=60), marimastat (n=39), ATN-224 (n=22) and imatinib (n=25). We examined factors influencing OS, including within-subject changes in PSA kinetics (PSA slope, PSA doubling time and PSA velocity), before and 6 months after treatment initiation.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 83.1 months, 49 of 146 men had died. In univariate Cox regression analysis, two factors were associated with OS: baseline PSA velocity and change in PSA velocity on therapy. In a landmark multivariable model, stratified by study (which controlled for age, Gleason score, type of local therapy and use of androgen-deprivation therapy prior to metastases), baseline PSA velocity and increase in PSA velocity on therapy remained independent predictors of OS. Median OS for men with an increase in PSA velocity on treatment was 115.4 months and was not reached for men with a decrease in PSA velocity (hazard ratio=0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.88; P=0.02).

Robotic and laparoscopic surgeries do not incorporate haptic feedback, which may result in complications secondary to inadequate tissue dissection (causing positive surgical margins, rhabdosphincter damage, etc). We developed a micro-engineered device (6 mm2 sized) [E-finger]) capable of quantitative elasticity assessment, with amplitude ratio, mean ratio and phase lag representing this. The aim was to assess the utility of the device in differentiating peri-prostatic tissue types in order to guide prostate dissection.  Material and methods:   Two embalmed and 2 fresh frozen cadavers were used in the study. Baseline elasticity values were assessed in bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter of pre-dissected embalmed cadavers using the micro-engineered device. A measurement grid was created to span from the bladder, across the prostate and onto the rhabdosphincter of fresh frozen cadavers to enable a systematic quantitative elasticity assessment of the entire area by 2 independent assessors. Tissue was sectioned along each row of elasticity measurement points, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Image analysis was performed with Image Pro Premier to determine the histology at each measurement point.  Results:   Statistically significant differences in elasticity were identified between bladder, prostate and sphincter in both embalmed and fresh frozen cadavers (p = < 0.001). Intra-class correlation (ICC) reliability tests showed good reliability (average ICC = 0.851).

Subsequently, testing for low serum testosterone has correspondingly increased.  Aims:   We sought to determine the testing behaviors of practitioners as well as the characteristics of men who are undergoing testing for low testosterone.  Methods:   Men aged 18-85 years were queried from the institutional electronic data warehouse from 2009 to 2012. Men were considered ""tested"" if their serum total testosterone level had been measured for any purpose. Tested men (TM) were compared with those not tested (NT).  Main outcome measures:   The frequency and timing of testing for low testosterone as well as patient demographics and clinical characteristics were compared between TM and NT using multivariable logistic regression models.  Results:   Of the 321,674 total men, 10,133 (3.2%) underwent testing with a serum total testosterone (mean age of 55.2 ± 14.1 years). The frequency of testing increased from 2.5% to 3.6% during the study period (P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that TM were significantly (P < 0.001) more likely to be Caucasian and have increased body mass index. In addition, TM were significantly more likely to have comorbid conditions including decreased libido (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.5, 11.7), infertility (aOR 4.8, 95% CI 3.6, 6.6), erectile dysfunction (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 3.4, 3.8), osteoporosis (aOR 3.3, 95% CI 2.8, 3.8), depression (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.6, 1.8), prostate cancer (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5, 1.8), hypertension (aOR 1.3. 95% CI 1.2, 1.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0, 1.4), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1, 1.2). Among TM, only 889 (9%) men underwent testing between 7 am and 12 pm.  Conclusions:   The rate of testosterone testing is increasing with most testing practices directed toward a subset of men with comorbidities that are associated with hypogonadism.

In deciding about screening, men must weigh the benefits and harms: little is known about benefit: harm trade-offs men are willing to accept. The objective of this study was to assess men's preferences for PSA screening, and the trade-offs between benefits and harms men are willing to accept when deciding about screening.  Methods:   Preferences of 662 men aged 40-69 were assessed using a discrete choice experiment. PSA screening was described by six attributes: prostate cancer deaths, prostate cancer diagnoses, unnecessary biopsies from false-positive PSA tests, impotence, urinary incontinence/bowel problems and cost. A mixed logit model was used to examine the influence of attributes on men's preferences for PSA testing; benefit: harm trade-offs were also calculated.  Results:   Men's preferences were significantly influenced by test characteristics, particularly potential mortality benefit, unnecessary biopsies and likelihood of urinary incontinence or bowel problems; preferences were also influenced by age, prior PSA testing experience and perceived risk of prostate cancer. Men were willing to accept between 65 and 233 of 10 000 extra men with unnecessary biopsies, and between 31 and 72 of 10 000 extra men with incontinence/bowel problems to avoid one prostate cancer death.  Conclusions:   Differences in valuations of attributes and trade-offs acceptable to men of different ages suggest a one size fits all approach to PSA testing, regardless of age, may not reflect men's preferences. Our results can be used by policymakers to ensure screening programmes are in line with men's preferences and by clinicians and patients to facilitate informed discussions of the most relevant benefits and downsides of PSA screening for an individual man.""","""['Kirsten Howard', 'Glenn P Salkeld', 'Manish I Patel', 'Graham J Mann', 'Michael P Pignone']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Health Expect""","""['Values and preferences of men for undergoing prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'The COMPASs Study: Community Preferences for Prostate cAncer Screening.

An electromagnetic driver was designed specifically for MRE studies in small-bore MR scanners. Ex vivo prostate specimens (post-fixation) of 14 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were imaged with MRE at 7 T (nine cases had DWI). In six patients, the MRE examination was performed at three frequencies (600, 800, 1000 Hz) to extract the power-law exponent Gamma. The images were registered to wholemount pathology slides marked with the Gleason score. The areas under the receiver-operator-characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated. The methods were validated in a phantom study and it was demonstrated that (i) the driver does not interfere with the acquisition process and (ii) the driver can generate amplitudes greater than 100 µm for frequencies less than 1 kHz. In the quantitative study, cancerous tissue with Gleason score at least 3 + 3 was distinguished from normal tissue in the peripheral zone (PZ) with an average AUC of 0.75 (Gd ), 0.75 (Gl ), 0.70 (Gamma-Gd ), 0.68 (apparent diffusion coefficient, ADC), and 0.82 (Gd + Gl + ADC). The differentiation between PZ and central gland was modest for Gd (p < 0.07), Gl (p < 0.06) but not significant for Gamma (p < 0.2). A correlation of 0.4 kPa/h was found between the fixation time of the prostate specimen and the stiffness of the tissue, which could affect the diagnostic power results. DWI and MRE may provide complementary information; in fact MRE performed better than ADC in distinguishing normal from cancerous tissue in some cases.

However, the impact of the debate on PCa patients has not been systematically studied.  Methods:   We assessed knowledge of, and attitudes toward, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's (USPSTF) May 2012 recommendation against PSA-based screening among men diagnosed with clinically localized PCa, and tested whether exposure to the recommendation and associated controversy about overtreatment of PCa predicted treatment decisional conflict, affected treatment choice, or increased regret about PSA testing.  Results:   Accurate knowledge of the USPSTF recommendation was uncommon (19.1%). Attitudes toward the recommendation were negative, and the vast majority (86.5%) remained highly supportive of annual PSA testing in men ≥50. Although exposure to the recommendation and controversy about treatment was associated with lower enthusiasm for screening and treatment, it was not associated with treatment decisions, or greater decisional-conflict, or regret.  Conclusions:   Findings may alleviate concern that exposure to PSA-based screening and overtreatment controversies has adversely affected recent cohorts of PCa patients. However, patients remain highly supportive of PSA-based screening.

VEGF-A pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced at the terminal exon to produce two families of isoforms, pro- and anti-angiogenic, only the former of which is upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). In renal epithelial cells and colon cancer cells, the choice of VEGF splice isoforms is controlled by the splicing factor SRSF1, phosphorylated by serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1). Immunohistochemistry staining of human samples revealed a significant increase in SRPK1 expression both in prostate intra-epithelial neoplasia lesions as well as malignant adenocarcinoma compared with benign prostate tissue. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the selective upregulation of pro-angiogenic VEGF in PCa may be under the control of SRPK1 activity. A switch in the expression of VEGF165 towards the anti-angiogenic splice isoform, VEGF165b, was seen in PC-3 cells with SRPK1 knockdown (KD). PC-3 SRPK1-KD cells resulted in tumours that grew more slowly in xenografts, with decreased microvessel density. No effect was seen as a result of SRPK1-KD on growth, proliferation, migration and invasion capabilities of PC-3 cells in vitro. Small-molecule inhibitors of SRPK1 switched splicing towards the anti-angiogenic isoform VEGF165b in PC-3 cells and decreased tumour growth when administered intraperitoneally in an orthotopic mouse model of PCa. Our study suggests that modulation of SRPK1 and subsequent inhibition of tumour angiogenesis by regulation of VEGF splicing can alter prostate tumour growth and supports further studies for the use of SRPK1 inhibition as a potential anti-angiogenic therapy in PCa.""","""['A Mavrou', 'K Brakspear', 'M Hamdollah-Zadeh', 'G Damodaran', 'R Babaei-Jadidi', 'J Oxley', 'D A Gillatt', 'M R Ladomery', 'S J Harper', 'D O Bates', 'S Oltean']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Targeting SRPK1 to control VEGF-mediated tumour angiogenesis in metastatic melanoma.', 'Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) splicing from pro-angiogenic to anti-angiogenic isoforms: a novel therapeutic strategy for angiogenesis.', ""Altered VEGF Splicing Isoform Balance in Tumor Endothelium Involves Activation of Splicing Factors Srpk1 and Srsf1 by the Wilms' Tumor Suppressor Wt1."", 'SRPK1 inhibition in vivo: modulation of VEGF splicing and potential treatment for multiple diseases.', 'RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', 'The splicing factor YBX1 promotes the progression of osteosarcoma by upregulating VEGF165 and downregulating VEGF165b.', 'Hypoxia-induced loss of SRSF2-dependent DNA methylation promotes CTCF-mediated alternative splicing of VEGFA in breast cancer.', 'SRPKs: a promising therapeutic target in cancer.', 'SPHINX-Based Combination Therapy as a Potential Novel Treatment Strategy for Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.', 'Synthesis and Anti-Angiogenic Activity of Novel c(RGDyK) Peptide-Based JH-VII-139-1 Conjugates.']"""

Countermeasures against tissue damage caused by radiation are limited by their potential to also protect malignant cells and tissues. Here, we tested a panel of signal transduction modifiers for selective radioprotection of normal but not tumor tissues. These included three inhibitors of GSK3 (LiCl, SB216763, and SB415286) and two inhibitors of NF-κB (ethyl pyruvate and RTA 408). Among these, the thiol-reactive triterpenoid RTA 408 emerged as a robust and effective protector of multiple organ systems (gastrointestinal, skin, and hemopoietic) against lethal doses of radiation. RTA 408 preserved survival and proliferation of intestinal crypt cells in lethally irradiated mice while reducing apoptosis incidence in crypts and villi. In contrast, RTA 408 uniformly inhibited growth of established CWR22Rv1, LNCaP/C4-2B, PC3, and DU145 xenografts either alone or combined with radiation.

Inhibitors of PI3Kβ have potential to reduce growth of tumors in which loss of PTEN drives tumor progression. We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ (AZD8186) and assessed its antitumor activity across a panel of cell lines. We have then explored the antitumor effects as single agent and in combination with docetaxel in triple-negative breast (TNBC) and prostate cancer models. In vitro, AZD8186 inhibited growth of a range of cell lines. Sensitivity was associated with inhibition of the AKT pathway. Cells sensitive to AZD8186 (GI50 < 1 μmol/L) are enriched for, but not exclusively associated with, PTEN deficiency. In vivo, AZD8186 inhibits PI3K pathway biomarkers in prostate and TNBC tumors. Scheduling treatment with AZD8186 shows antitumor activity required only intermittent exposure, and that increased tumor control is achieved when AZD8186 is used in combination with docetaxel. AZD8186 is a potent inhibitor of PI3Kβ with activity against PI3Kδ signaling, and has potential to reduce growth of tumors dependent on dysregulated PTEN for growth.

The effects of NSK-01105 on proliferation and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells were established by cytotoxicity assays, apoptosis analysis, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blot analysis. Two xenograft tumor models were used to verify the therapeutic effect of NSK-01105 in vivo. NSK-01105 exhibited broad-spectrum antitumor activity, particularly in prostate cancer cells. Characterization of apoptosis morphology was observed, and the percentage of apoptosis-positive cells significantly increased after NSK-01105 treatment for 24 h. Furthermore, a significant increase of the ""sub-G1"" population in LNCaP and PC-3 cells after NSK-01105 treatment was determined by cell cycle analysis. Tumor growth was significantly suppressed by once daily oral 30 mg/kg dose of NSK-01105 with the inhibition rates of 63.82% in LNCaP models and 64.29% in PC-3 models, respectively. The activation of Raf-1 kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor was downregulated by NSK-01105 at 10 μmol/L. Consequently, the dual inhibitions of Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathways were observed by Western blot analysis.

Thus, we tried to identify more precise risk stratification system for contemporary high-risk prostate cancer.  Methods:   Classifying patients according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk groups, we reviewed data of 1,905 men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution from 2006 to 2013. For our analyses, high-risk prostate cancers meeting at least one of two following factors were categorized as unfavorable high-risk prostate cancer: biopsy primary Gleason pattern 5 and/or multiple (≥2) high-risk criteria present. All other men with high-risk prostate cancer were designated as having favorable high-risk disease. Postoperative outcomes, including biochemical recurrence-free survivals were assessed and compared via log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   In multivariable analysis, primary Gleason 5 pattern on biopsy (p = 0.008) and multiple (≥2) high-risk criteria (p < 0.001) were observed to be independent predictors of the risk of biochemical recurrence amongst high-risk group undergoing RP. Favorable high-risk prostate cancer group showed a significantly higher 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival than unfavorable high-risk group (56.35 vs. 18.75 %; log-rank test: p < 0.001). Favorable high-risk group demonstrated significantly lower 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival than intermediate-risk group (56.07 vs. 82.05 %; log-rank test: p < 0.001).

It is believed that these patients are overtreated. The current analyses aim to explore patient-level heterogeneity in survival effects, examine matching of patients to treatments in practice, and identify patient characteristics driving heterogenous effects, in order to present more comprehensive evidence about the concerns of overtreatment.  Methods:   Eleven-year all-cause and PCa-specific survival among SEER-Medicare patients diagnosed during 1996-2002 were analyzed using local instrumental variable approaches.  Results:   A total of 8462 (77%) of 11,036 patients received RP. The average effects of RP over WW on 11-year overall and cancer-specific survival were 1.1 months (95%CI, -25, 28; P=0.94) and 1.7 months (95%CI, -25, 29; P=0.90) respectively; effects did not differ significantly according to age, race, grade, and stage. Fewer than 1% of patients had significant cancer-specific survival benefit from RP at the 10% level; 6% were expected to gain over 15 months from RP. However, patients with larger expected survival gains from RP were much more likely to receive RP in practice. Such positive self-selection was driven by PCa-specific survival than overall survival. Several comorbidities may play a critical role in predicting who could benefit from RP.  Conclusions:   Our analyses corroborate concerns about PCa overtreatment. A small fraction of screen-detected PCa patients derive survival benefits from RP. Prediction tools should account for patient comorbidities to accurately predict survival benefits of RP over WW.""","""['Anirban Basu', 'John L Gore']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Care""","""['Re: Are elderly patients with clinically localized prostate cancer overtreated?

Images were reconstructed with 4mm and 2mm voxel size and analyzed quantitatively using AMIDE and MATLAB. Clinical images were judged by two observers concerning TNM staging, image quality and the correlation of PET and CT data. Phantom studies revealed increased SUVmean and SUVmax values in the HR images (P<0.01). The lower detection limit was approximately 3mm in the HR and 4-5mm in the conventional images. Lower FWHM values were found in the HR images. No significant difference was found concerning the image quality and the correlation of PET and CT (each P>0.5). For both reconstructions, a comparable total amount of lesions was reported (P>0.5) with no impact on the TNM staging. In conclusion, the HR PET reconstruction provides semi-quantitative advantages in the sense of an improved lower detection limit and increased semi-quantitative tumour-to-background ratios.

Patients diagnosed with a new malignancy (except skin basal and squamous cell carcinomas) during the period 2005-2010 were included.

Breast, prostate, colorectum, skin, melanomas, and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SHN) and bladder/ureter were the most common sites of first neoplasms, whereas breast, lung, colorectum, prostate, melanoma, and SHN were the most common sites of second neoplasms. The most common pairing was breast with breast (31% synchronous), followed by the bladder/ureter with the prostate (72% synchronous), prostate with the colorectum, SHN with SHN, and SHN with lung. Five-year crude survival of patients with synchronous cancers (34%) was not significantly lower than that of patients with single neoplasms (39%). This population-based study indicates that about one in eight incident neoplasms in these mature registries are second neoplasms and almost 1/40 patients are diagnosed with synchronous primary cancers.

The preoperative period may be a more physically and emotionally salient time to introduce and foster chronic adherence to health behaviours, such as exercise, in patients compared to post-treatment during recovery. Moreover, physical and psychosocial improvements during the preoperative period may translate into an enhanced recovery trajectory with reduced operative complications and postoperative adverse effects. No studies have assessed prehabilitation for men with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Methods/design:   This is a multi-centre, pilot randomized control trial conducted at two Canadian urban teaching hospitals. 100 men undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with no contraindications to exercise will be recruited and randomized to the prehabiliation program or usual care. Prehabilitation participants will engage in a preoperative, individualized exercise program including pelvic floor muscle strengthening instructions and a healthy lifestyle guide for men with prostate cancer. These participants will be asked to engage in 60 minutes of home-based, unsupervised, moderate-intensity exercise on 3-4 days per week. Usual care participants will receive the same pelvic floor muscle strengthening instructions and healthy lifestyle guide only. We will assess the feasibility of conducting an adequately powered trial of the same design via recruitment rate, programmatic adherence/contamination, attrition, and safety. Estimates of intervention efficacy will be captured through measurements at baseline (4-8 weeks preoperatively), within 1 week prior to surgery, and postoperatively at 4, 12, and 26 weeks. Efficacy outcomes include: fatigue, quality of life, urinary incontinence, physical fitness, body composition, aerobic fitness, pain, and physical activity volume.  Discussion:   The primary outcome of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a full-scale, randomized controlled trial of prehabilitation versus usual care and to estimate effect sizes that will inform sample size determinations for subsequent trials in this field. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine a structured presurgical exercise program for men undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. This trial will advance our understanding of strategies to efficiently and effectively use the preoperative period to optimize postoperative recovery.

However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-224 have not been fully elucidated. In this study, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) was identified as a target gene of miR-224. Then, we found that enforced expression of miR-224 could suppress PCa cell proliferation and cell cycle by regulating the expression of CAMKK2 in vitro. In addition, the expression levels of miR-224 in PCa tissues were negatively correlated with those of CAMKK2 mRNA significantly (Spearman's correlation: r = -0.66, P = 0.004). Moreover, combined low miR-224 expression and high CAMKK2 expression (miR-224-low/CAMKK2-high) was closely correlated with advanced clinical stage (P = 0.028). Furthermore, PCa patients with miR-224-low/CAMKK2-high expression more frequently had shorter overall survival than those in groups with other expression patterns of two molecules. In conclusion, our data offer the convincing evidence that miR-224 and its target gene CAMKK2 may synergistically contribute to the malignant progression of PCa. Combined detection of miR-224 and CAMKK2 expressions represents an efficient predictor of patient prognosis and may be a novel marker which can provide additional prognostic information in PCa.""","""['Hao Fu', 'Hui-chan He', 'Zhao-dong Han', 'Yue-ping Wan', 'Hong-wei Luo', 'Ya-qiang Huang', 'Chao Cai', 'Yu-xiang Liang', 'Qi-shan Dai', 'Fu-neng Jiang', 'Wei-de Zhong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.', 'Down-regulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 by androgen deprivation induces castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A regulatory feedback loop between Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Dysregulated microRNA-224/apelin axis associated with aggressive progression and poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Prostate Cancer Biomarkers.', 'Systemic Ablation of Camkk2 Impairs Metastatic Colonization and Improves Insulin Sensitivity in TRAMP Mice: Evidence for Cancer Cell-Extrinsic CAMKK2 Functions in Prostate Cancer.', 'Tyrosine Phosphorylation Profiling Revealed the Signaling Network Characteristics of CAMKK2 in Gastric Adenocarcinoma.', 'Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.', 'The Natural Chemotherapeutic Capsaicin Activates AMPK through LKB1 Kinase and TRPV1 Receptors in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'MicroRNA-378 regulates adipogenic differentiation in bovine intramuscular preadipocytes by targeting CaMKK2.']"""

The aim of this study was to assess the additional value of targeted SPECT-CT with PBS in detecting skeletal metastasis form prostate cancer, considering resource implications in an Irish hospital setting.  Methods:   54 PC patients with increased radiotracer uptake on PBS were retrospectively recruited from 2012 to 2013. All underwent targeted evaluation with SPECT-CT. PBS and SPECT-CT images were reviewed by two nuclear medicine radiologists and reported independently. The final diagnosis was made based on the CT finding corresponding to the area of radiotracer uptake.  Results:   The mean age was 70.9 years (48-88 years) and median PSA at presentation was 13.9 ng/ml (4.2-215 ng/ml). 68.5 % (n = 37) men received treatment for PC while 31.5 % (n = 17) patients had not received treatment prior to PBS. 164 areas of increased radiotracer uptake were identified on PBS; 13 areas were characterised as metastatic on SPECT-CT; iliac bone (n = 3), ribs (n = 1), skull (n = 2), sacrum (n = 1), ischium (n = 1), femur (n = 3), thoracic spine (n = 1) and cervical spine (n = 1). 151 areas were characterised as benign on SPECT-CT. One area of increased radiotracer uptake in the ribs was subsequently described as indeterminate after evaluation with SPECT-CT.  Conclusion:   SPECT-CT improves the diagnostic accuracy of PBS in detecting skeletal metastasis from PC and is superior to PBS alone in differentiating benign from malignant lesions.

The purpose of this study was to characterize and identify animal husbandry conditions that might confound results of the spontaneous void spot assay in male C57Bl/6J mice.  Methods:   Mice were placed in cages lined with filter paper for 4 hr and urine was visualized with UV transillumination. Voiding parameters including urine spot number, spot size, total urine area, primary void area, corner and center voiding were quantified.  Results:   Adult male mice void more frequently with advancing age and a subpopulation (5-10%) display a frequent spotting pattern at 6-9 weeks of age. Voiding was not significantly different in male mice weaned to group housing (4-6 per cage) versus single housing, and was not altered when they were used as breeders. Voiding was changed upon transferring group housed adult males to single density cages, which decreased total urine area. Repeated assays of male voiding behavior over three consecutive days increased primary void area by the third day of monitoring and revealed that voiding behavior is impacted by routine cage changes and time of day.

However, studies have demonstrated a severe lack of comprehension of these terms, particularly in underserved populations. It was hypothesized that a video-based educational tool would significantly improve the understanding of key terms related to prostate health in a predominantly lower literacy population.  Methods:   A software application was developed by various experts, including urologists and human-computer interaction specialists, to serve as a video-based educational tool emphasizing narrated animations to promote understanding of terms related to urinary, bowel, and sexual function. This application was viewed by patients recruited from 2 low-income safety net clinics, where a previously developed survey was administered to assess pre- and postintervention levels of comprehension.  Results:   Fifty-six patients with a mean literacy level of 7th to 8th grade completed the study. Patients achieved statistically significant improvements in comprehension for the majority of the terms after the video intervention, with notable improvements including the terms incontinence (from 14% to 50%), bowels (from 14% to 46%), and impotence (from 58% to 84%). Patients demonstrated significant gains in their understanding of the function of the prostate (from 11% to 30%) and in their ability to locate the prostate on anatomic drawings (from 50% to 82%).

Methods:   We identified 47 patients who underwent (18) F-FCholine and DWIMRI followed by surgical treatment (either prostatectomy or LN dissection or an association of prostatectomy and LN dissection) between May 2010 and December 2012 at Bordeaux University Hospital. These patients were part of a prospective study (EudraCT number 2009-014839-21) evaluating the interest of (18) F-FCholine in staging of high-risk PCa. Diagnostic performances were retrospectively determined for each of (18) F-FCholine and DWIMRI considering LN invasion, each of prostate sextants, capsular invasion and extension to seminal vesicles. (18) F-FCholine and MR findings were correlated with histological findings.  Results:   In a region-based LN analysis, the sensitivity and positive predictive value specificity were respectively, 56% and 98% for (18) F-Choline, and 17% and 97% for DWIMRI. In a patient-based analysis the sensitivity and positive predictive value were respectively 78% and 94% for (18) F-Choline and 33% and 84% for DWIMRI (P = 0.015). For tumor staging, DWIMRI showed better performances with a better specificity (69%) for sextants analysis and sensitivity to detect seminal vesicle invasion (73% vs. 36%).  Conclusions:   (18) F-FCholine imaging appears to provide helpful additional information in the staging of high-risk PCa. It appears essential for predicting LN status due to its higher sensitivity and specificity for LN involvement. However, despite excellent performance, it cannot replace MRI that remains better for tumoral localization and local evaluation, especially for seminal vesicle invasion.

Luteinizing hormone (LH) can induce expression of steroidogenic enzymes and trigger androgen production, but the regulation of this process is not well-described. Here, we explored the impact of silencing LH receptor (LHR) silencing on androgen synthesis and on several relevant signaling pathways in PC.  Methods:   LHR mRNA and protein expression was evaluated in LNCaP PC cells treated with LHR-siRNA. MTS assay was used to measure the effect of LHR-siRNA on proliferation in LNCaP and 22RV1 PC cells.

Results:   We confirmed that functional LHR is expressed in both androgen-sensitive and castrate-resistant PC specimens. Treatment with LHR-siRNA effectively silenced LHR gene and protein expression and prevented LH-mediated proliferation and androgen synthesis in prostate cancer cells. LHR silencing also downregulated expression of AR, PSA, PKA, ERK1/2, PI3K, AKT2, and HER2.

Seventy percent of these genes were concerned with cell cycle progression, DNA repair, or mitosis. These E2F-responsive gene overexpressing (ERGO) tumors frequently exhibited additional evidence of Rb/E2F axis dysfunction, were mostly triple negative, and preferentially overexpressed multiple basal cytokeratins, suggesting that they overlapped substantially with the basal-like tumor subset.

The antimetastatic effect was mediated by the NRP-binding RXXK peptide motif (CendR motif), and not by the integrin-binding RGD motif. iRGD inhibited migration of tumor cells and caused chemorepulsion in vitro in a CendR- and NRP-1-dependent manner. The peptide induced dramatic collapse of cellular processes and partial cell detachment, resulting in the repellent activity.

Expression of PCA3-shRNA2 was upregulated in malignant prostatic tissues, exfoliated urinary cells from men with prostate cancer (13-273 fold change; t test P < 0.003), and closely correlated to PCA3 expression (r = 0.84-0.93; P < 0.001). Urinary PCA3-shRNA2 (C-index, 0.75-0.81) and PCA3 (C-index, 0.78) could predict the presence of cancer in most men. PCA3-shRNA2 knockup altered the expression of predicted target mRNAs, including COPS2, SOX11, WDR48, TEAD1, and Noggin. PCA3-shRNA2 expression was negatively correlated with COPS2 in patient samples (r = -0.32; P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   We identified a short RNA within PCA3, whose expression is correlated to PCA3, which may target mRNAs implicated in prostate biology.  Impact:   This short RNA is stable ex vivo, suggesting a role as a robust biomarker. We identify cytoplasmic enrichment of this RNA and potential targeting of mRNAs implicated in prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Ross M Drayton', 'Ishtiaq Rehman', 'Raymond Clarke', 'Zhongming Zhao', 'Karl Pang', 'Saiful Miah', 'Robert Stoehr', 'Arndt Hartmann', 'Sheila Blizard', 'Martin Lavin', 'Helen E Bryant', 'Elena S Martens-Uzunova', 'Guido Jenster', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Robert A Gardiner', 'James W F Catto']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Evaluation of a short RNA within Prostate Cancer Gene 3 in the predictive role for future cancer using non-malignant prostate biopsies.', 'New genomic structure for prostate cancer specific gene PCA3 within BMCC1: implications for prostate cancer detection and progression.', 'Expression of PRUNE2 mRNA and its positive correlation with non-coding RNA PCA3 in leiomyosarcoma.', 'PCA3: from basic molecular science to the clinical lab.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'FOXF2 Regulates PRUNE2 Transcription in the Pathogenesis of Colorectal Cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA PCA3 contributes to the progression of choriocarcinoma by acting as a ceRNA against miR-106b.', 'Evaluation of a short RNA within Prostate Cancer Gene 3 in the predictive role for future cancer using non-malignant prostate biopsies.', 'Prostate-based biofluids for the detection of prostate cancer: A comparative study of the diagnostic performance of cell-sourced RNA biomarkers.']"""

Methods:   Patients (N = 671) with breast, myeloma, colorectal, lymphoma, bone marrow, prostate, lung and gastroenteric cancer were randomly split into estimation (75%) and validation (25%) datasets. SF-6D was estimated from QLQ-C30 scores via ordinary least squares, generalized linear models and median (least-absolute deviations) regression approaches, and with Bayesian additive regression kernels. Predictive ability was assessed with root mean square error, mean absolute error and proportions of predictions with absolute errors >0.05 and >0.1, whereas explanatory power with adjusted R (2) or equivalent fit measures. Two external samples (breast and colorectal cancer) were used to further test the models.  Results:   The QLQ-C30's global health item, the physical, emotional and social functioning scales, and the fatigue, pain and diarrhea symptom scales were significant predictors (p < 0.05 or better) in all models. Negligible deviations in models' performance were observed. All models overpredicted utilities for patients in worst health and underpredicted them for those in better health (p < 0.01 or better).

Objectives:   The goal of this work was to capture the current treatment pattern of AS for localized prostate cancer (PCa) in patients managed by office-based urologists in Germany.  Materials and methods:   Our cohort consisted of 361 patients included in the AS arm of the HAROW (Hormonal Treatment, Active Surveillance, Radiation Therapy, OP, Watchful Waiting) study, an observational health service study in Germany. Descriptive characteristics and active-treatment-free survival (ATFS), surgical outcomes, and triggers for active treatment were assessed.  Results:   Currently, only 15% of all patients with localized PCa were treated with AS. At baseline, 83% and 58% of all AS patients met the Chism and PRIAS low-risk criteria, respectively. After a median follow-up of 24 months, no systemic progression was observed, 5 patients died of non-disease-specific causes and active treatment was delivered in 20.5% of all patients. Triggers for active therapy were progression at biopsy (42%), rise in prostate-specific antigen level (27%), medical advice (16%) and patient's preference (10%), respectively.  Conclusion:   Our short-term results indicate that - in the hands of office-based urologists - active surveillance might represent a feasible treatment option for patients with localized PCa.

Methods:   We determined the expression of PSF1 in 120 needle biopsy samples of prostate cancer by immunohistochemistry. We divided patients into PSF1-positive or -negative groups and analyzed the relationships between the expression of PSF1, the Gleason score, PSA level, TNM classification and prognosis.  Results:   Our results showed that the PSF1 expression correlated significantly with PSA values at diagnosis (P=0.0028), with tumor grade (P<0.0001), and with clinical stage (P=0.0005). Moreover, the PSF1 expression correlated significantly with overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 5.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.17-15.8; P=0.003) and progression-free survival in 99 consecutive patients with prostate cancer. Noteworthy, the prognosis of PSF1-positive cases was also worse in patients with a Gleason score of 8-10 (HR 3.7; 95% CI 1.28-13.43; P=0.0143). Limitations include that this study had a retrospective design, that patients in the study were heterogeneous and included those with early and advanced cancer, and that small tumor fragments may not be representative of the entire carcinoma.

Results:   Compared with white survivors (mean score, 85.16), Hispanic (mean score, 79.95) and Asian (mean score, 76.55) survivors reported poorer overall communication (P = .04 and P < .001, respectively), and Asian survivors (mean score, 79.97) reported poorer medical test communication (P = .001). Asian survivors were less likely to report high care quality (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.72) and reported lower self-efficacy in medical decisions (mean score, 74.71; P < .001) compared with white survivors (mean score, 84.22). No disparity was found in perceived control. PPC was positively associated with care quality (P < .001) and self-efficacy (P < .001). After adjusting for PPC and other covariates, when compared with whites, Asian disparities remained significant.  Conclusion:   Asian survivors report poorer follow-up care communication and care quality. More research is needed to identify contributing factors beyond PPC, such as cultural influences and medical system factors.""","""['Nynikka R A Palmer', 'Erin E Kent', 'Laura P Forsythe', 'Neeraj K Arora', 'Julia H Rowland', 'Noreen M Aziz', 'Danielle Blanch-Hartigan', 'Ingrid Oakley-Girvan', 'Ann S Hamilton', 'Kathryn E Weaver']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Cancer Survival: The Contribution of Tumor, Sociodemographic, Institutional, and Neighborhood Characteristics.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Diabetes Screening Between Asian Americans and Other Adults: BRFSS 2012-2014.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Patient-Provider Communication With Breast Cancer Patients: Evidence From 2011 MEPS and Experiences With Cancer Supplement.', 'End-of-Life Care for People With Cancer From Ethnic Minority Groups: A Systematic Review.', 'Disparities in Cancer Care and the Asian American Population.', 'Colorectal cancer screening disparities in Asian Americans: the influences of patient-provider communication and social media use.', 'Patient Satisfaction With Breast Cancer Care Delivery at the National Cancer Institute of Sri Lanka: Does Language Play a Role?', 'Timing of Chemotherapy and Patient-Reported Outcomes After Breast-Conserving Surgery and Mastectomy with Immediate Reconstruction.', 'Advancing Digital Health Innovation in Oncology: Priorities for High-Value Digital Transformation in Cancer Care.', 'Racial Disparities in Patient-Provider Communication During Telehealth Visits Versus Face-to-face Visits Among Asian and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Patients With Cancer: Cross-sectional Analysis.']"""

Materials and methods:   From a cohort of 535 patients submitted to radical prostatectomy (RP), a sample of 30 patients (14 patients with rapid biochemical failure (BF) and 16 patients without BF) with Gleason score 7 were analyzed. A total of 1435 miRNAs were quantified by microarray hybridization, and selected miRNAs with the highest Standard deviation (n = 50) were validated by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). In situ hybridization (ISH) was used to evaluate the expression of miR-21.

The ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis and exhibit limitless replication potential allows for progression of cancer from a benign to a metastatic phenotype. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the effect of the isoflavone phenoxodiol on the expression of cell cycle genes.  Methods:   Three prostate cancer cell lines-LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 were cultured in vitro, and then treated with phenoxodiol (10 μM and 30 μM) for 24 and 48 h. The expression of cell cycle genes p21(WAF1), c-Myc, Cyclin-D1, and Ki-67 was investigated by Real Time PCR.  Results:   Here we report that phenoxodiol induces cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, with the resultant arrest due to the upregulation of p21(WAF1) in all the cell lines in response to treatment, indicating that activation of p21(WAF1) and subsequent cell arrest was occurring via a p53 independent manner, with induction of cytotoxicity independent of caspase activation. We found that c-Myc and Cyclin-D1 expression was not consistently altered across all cell lines but Ki-67 signalling expression was decreased in line with the cell cycle arrest.  Conclusions:   Phenoxodiol demonstrates an ability in prostate cancer cells to induce significant cytotoxicity in cells by interacting with p21(WAF1) and inducing cell cycle arrest irrespective of p53 status or caspase pathway interactions. These data indicate that phenoxodiol would be effective as a potential future treatment modality for both hormone sensitive and hormone refractory prostate cancer.""","""['Simon Mahoney', 'Frank Arfuso', 'Michael Millward', 'Arun Dharmarajan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Cell Int""","""['Phenoxodiol, a novel isoflavone, induces G1 arrest by specific loss in cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity by p53-independent induction of p21WAF1/CIP1.', 'Phenoxodiol inhibits growth of metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Cytotoxic effects of the novel isoflavone, phenoxodiol, on prostate cancer cell lines.', 'The role of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in inhibition of proliferation in human prostate carcinoma cells by raloxifene: an in vitro experiment.', 'Estrogen and antiestrogen regulation of cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells.', 'The role of isoflavones in augmenting the effects of radiotherapy.', 'Monooxygenase-catalyzed regioselective hydroxylation for the synthesis of hydroxyequols.', 'Phenoxodiol sensitizes metastatic colorectal cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil- and oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis through intrinsic pathway.', 'Triggering of eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death, by phenoxodiol.', 'FAM46B inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in prostate cancer through ubiquitination of β-catenin.']"""

Logistic regression models were used to estimate multivariable OR adjusted for age, study centre, years of education, social class, BMI, smoking status, family history of prostate cancer and total energy intake. Men with higher DII scores had a higher risk of prostate cancer when analysed using the DII as both continuous (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00, 1.13) and categorical, i.e., compared with men in the lowest quartile of the DII, men in the third and fourth quartiles were at elevated risk (OR(Quartile 3 v. 1) 1.32, 95% CI 1.03, 1.69 and OR(Quartile 4 v. 1) 1.33, 95% CI 1.01, 1.76; P trend= 0.04).

Methods:   Markov modeling was used to estimate the incremental impact on healthcare system costs (2012 USD) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of two alternative strategies: (i) using the new diagnostic to guide therapy versus (ii) current usual care-using a combination of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and bone scan to guide therapy. Costs were based on estimates from literature and Medicare reimbursement. Prostate cancer progression, survival, utilities, and background risk of all-cause mortality were obtained from literature. Base-case diagnostic sensitivity (75 percent), specificity (90 percent), and cost (USD 2,500) were provided by our industry partner GE Healthcare.  Results:   The new diagnostic strategy provided an average gain of 1.83 (95 percent uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.24-2.64) QALYs with added costs of USD 15,595 (95 percent UI: USD -6,330-44,402) over 35 years. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was USD 8,516/QALY (95 percent UI: USD -2,947-22,372).

Its malignant form is associated with internal neoplasms, especially gastric adenocarcinoma (55-61%). Coexistence with prostate cancer is uncommon. In the paraneoplastic type of this dermatosis, the skin and mucous lesions are characteristically of more sudden onset and more severe than those in the benign form. The efficacy of various treatment strategies remains disappointing.  Case presentation:   We here report a case of 66-year-old Caucasian patient with metastatic prostate cancer and a mild form of acanthosis nigricans that preceded the diagnosis of malignancy and resolved with chemotherapy in parallel with the prostate cancer. The dermatosis recurred when the prostate cancer progressed.  Conclusion:   Concurrent acanthosis nigricans and prostate cancer is rare, and few such cases have been reported.

In multiatlas based image segmentation, atlas selection and combination are considered as two key factors affecting the performance. Recently, manifold learning based atlas selection methods have emerged as very promising methods. However, due to the complexity of prostate structures in raw images, it is difficult to get accurate atlas selection results by only measuring the distance between raw images on the manifolds. Although the distance between the regions to be segmented across images can be readily obtained by the label images, it is infeasible to directly compute the distance between the test image (gray) and the label images (binary). This paper tries to address this problem by proposing a label image constrained atlas selection method, which exploits the label images to constrain the manifold projection of raw images. Analyzing the data point distribution of the selected atlases in the manifold subspace, a novel weight computation method for atlas combination is proposed. Compared with other related existing methods, the experimental results on prostate segmentation from T2w MRI showed that the selected atlases are closer to the target structure and more accurate segmentation were obtained by using our proposed method.""","""['Pingkun Yan', 'Yihui Cao', 'Yuan Yuan', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Peter L Choyke']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Cybern""","""['Metric Learning for Multi-atlas based Segmentation of Hippocampus.', 'Multiatlas-based segmentation with preregistration atlas selection.', 'Automatic labeling of MR brain images through extensible learning and atlas forests.', ""Local manifold learning for multiatlas segmentation: application to hippocampal segmentation in healthy population and Alzheimer's disease."", 'A review of atlas-based segmentation for magnetic resonance brain images.', 'Boundary-Weighted Domain Adaptive Neural Network for Prostate MR Image Segmentation.', 'STRAINet: Spatially Varying sTochastic Residual AdversarIal Networks for MRI Pelvic Organ Segmentation.', 'Metric Learning for Multi-atlas based Segmentation of Hippocampus.', 'Deformable MR Prostate Segmentation via Deep Feature Learning and Sparse Patch Matching.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study was a retrospective analysis of routine clinical prostate MRI reports before (254 patients) and after (211 patients) the implementation of a 5-point diagnostic certainty lexicon. Whole-mount step-section pathology of the radical prostatectomy specimens served as the reference standard. The terms used to express diagnostic certainty regarding ECE on standard-of-care MRI and the presence of ECE on pathology were compared between the two periods. ROC analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the 5-point certainty lexicon for detecting ECE.  Results:   Before the implementation of the certainty lexicon, radiologists used 38 different terms to express the levels of certainty regarding the presence of ECE on MRI. Afterward, they adhered to the lexicon's predefined 5-point terminology in 85.3% of cases. The 5-point certainty lexicon used on MRI reports had an AUC of 0.852 for diagnosing ECE.  Conclusion:   The implementation of a lexicon of diagnostic certainty dramatically reduced the number of expressions used by radiologists to indicate their levels of diagnostic certainty. The accuracy of the certainty lexicon for diagnosing ECE on standard-of-care prostate MRI is similar to previously reported accuracy values for the diagnosis of ECE by MRI.

Although prostate tumors respond to androgen ablation therapy at an early stage, they often acquire the potential of androgen-independent growth. Elevated transcriptional activity of androgen receptor (AR) and/or signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) contributes to the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we examined the effect of resveratrol, a phytoalexin present in grapes, on the reporter gene activity of AR and STAT3 in human prostate cancer (LNCaP-FGC) cells stimulated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and/or dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Our study revealed that resveratrol suppressed the growth of LNCaP-FGC cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Whereas the AR transcriptional activity was induced by treatment with either IL-6 or DHT, the STAT3 transcriptional activity was induced only by treatment with IL-6 but not with DHT. Resveratrol significantly attenuated IL-6-induced STAT3 transcriptional activity, and DHT- or IL-6-induced AR transcriptional activity. Treatment of cells with DHT plus IL-6 significantly increased the AR transcriptional activity as compared to DHT or IL-6 treatment alone and resveratrol markedly diminished DHT plus IL-6-induced AR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the production of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was decreased by resveratrol in the DHT-, IL-6- or DHT plus IL-6-treated LNCaP-FGC cells. Taken together, the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on IL-6- and/or DHT-induced AR transcriptional activity in LNCaP prostate cancer cells are partly mediated through the suppression of STAT3 reporter gene activity, suggesting that resveratrol may be a promising therapeutic choice for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Mee-Hyun Lee', 'Joydeb Kumar Kundu', 'Young-Sam Keum', 'Yong-Yeon Cho', 'Young-Joon Surh', 'Bu Young Choi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biomol Ther (Seoul)""","""['Resveratrol inhibits DHT-induced progression of prostate cancer cell line through interfering with the AR and CXCR4 pathway.', 'Androgen receptor activity at the prostate specific antigen locus: steroidal and non-steroidal mechanisms.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'STAT3 pathway as a molecular target for resveratrol in breast cancer treatment.', 'SLC14A1 is a new biomarker in renal cancer.', 'Natural Product-Based Studies for the Management of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Computational to Clinical Studies.', 'Targeting Drug Chemo-Resistance in Cancer Using Natural Products.', 'The Role of Resveratrol in Human Male Fertility.', 'The Effects of Resveratrol on Prostate Cancer through Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Patients and methods:   We evaluated 810 patients with high-risk prostate cancer, defined as having one or more of the following: PSA level of >20 ng/mL, Gleason score ≥8, clinical stage ≥T2c. Patients underwent robot-assisted RP (RARP) with pelvic lymph node dissection, between 2003 and 2012, in one centre. Only 1.6% (13/810) of patients received any adjuvant treatment. Favourable pathological outcome was defined as specimen-confined disease (SCD; pT2-T3a, node negative, and negative surgical margins) at RARP-specimen. Logistic regression models were used to test the relationship among all available predicators and harbouring SCD. A logistic regression coefficient-based nomogram was constructed and internally validated using 200 bootstrap resamples. Kaplan-Meier method estimated biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free and cancer-specific mortality (CSM)-free survival rates, after stratification according to pathological disease status.  Results:   Overall, 55.2% patients harboured SCD at RARP. At multivariable analysis, PSA level, clinical stage, primary/secondary Gleason scores, and maximum percentage tumour quartiles were all independent predictors of SCD (all P < 0.04). A nomogram based on these variables showed 76% discrimination accuracy in predicting SCD, and very favourable calibration characteristics.

Conclusions:   We developed a novel nomogram predicting SCD at RARP. Patients with SCD achieved favourable long-term BCR- and CSM-free survival rates after RARP.

Methods and materials:   We studied 32 patients who received 8100 cGy in 45 daily fractions to their prostate and proximal 1 cm of the seminal vesicles using variable dose rate VMAT (n = 22) or 7-field, step-and-shoot IMRT (n = 10) for intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer between July 2010 and April 2013. In 90% of patients, VMAT was delivered with 2 arcs. To have an unbiased comparison of plan quality, patients who were treated with VMAT were also planned with IMRT and vice versa. Each patient served as his own control for the comparison.  Results:   VMAT reduced median radiation beam-on time from 4.3 to 3.4 minutes (P = .03). There was no statistically significant difference in PTV volumes between the VMAT and step-and-shoot IMRT groups (P = .76). VMAT dose distributions were more homogeneous (P = .003). There was no difference between groups with regard to rectal V60, V65, V70, V75, bladder V65, V70, V75, V80, or femoral heads V33.  Conclusions:   Two-arc VMAT resulted in shorter beam-on times and more homogenous dose distributions than 7-field, step-and-shoot IMRT for prostate cancer. With decreased beam-on time, the intrafraction motion during irradiation is reduced, thus improving confidence that the delivered dose distribution agrees with the plan.""","""['Eric A Mellon', 'Khosrow Javedan', 'Tobin J Strom', 'Eduardo G Moros', 'Matthew C Biagioli', 'Daniel C Fernandez', 'Stu G Wasserman', 'Richard B Wilder']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'A Dosimetric Comparison between Conventional Fractionated and Hypofractionated Image-guided Radiation Therapies for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'A dosimetric comparison of tomotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy in the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer with pelvic nodal radiation therapy.', 'Which IMRT?

Methods and materials:   Three Calypso Beacon (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) transponders were implanted into 2 prostate phantoms. The geometric center of the transponders were identified on computed tomography and set as the isocenter. With the phantom stationary on the treatment table and the tracking array 14-cm above the isocenter, data were acquired by the Calypso system at 10 Hz to establish the uncertainty in measurements. Transponder positional data were acquired with unilateral hip prostheses of different metallic compositions and then with bilateral hips placed at variable separation from the phantom.  Results:   Regardless of hip prosthesis composition, the average vector displacement in the presence of a unilateral prosthesis was <0.5 mm. The greatest contribution to overall vector displacement occurred in the lateral dimension. With bilateral hip prosthesis, the average vector displacement was 0.3 mm. The displacement in the lateral dimension was markedly reduced compared with a unilateral hip, suggesting that there was a countervailing effect with bilateral hip prosthesis. The greatest average vector displacement was 0.6 mm and occurred when bilateral hip prostheses were placed within 4 cm of the detector array.  Conclusions:   Unilateral and bilateral hip prostheses did not have any meaningful effect on the ability to accurately track electromagnetic transponders implanted in a prostate phantom.

In prostate radiation therapy these changes can result from the daily patient positioning as well as the deformation of the body shape between treatment days and simulation. This study investigates the feasibility of using an online correction method to account for interfraction body contour changes prior to daily delivery of prostate radiation therapy based on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging.  Methods and materials:   This is a retrospective study where 5 prostate patients who received intensity modulated radiation therapy were selected. Patients were selected from a cohort who demonstrated repeated minor (1-2 cm) variations in body contour between planning CT and daily CBCT. Pretreatment CBCT images were used to calculate the ""treated"" dose and investigate the deviations from prescription caused by changes in body contour. A simple tissue maximum ratio correction was then applied to each field to calculate the ""adapted"" dose, which accounts for physical changes in path length on the central axis. A comparison was made between the treated and adapted scenarios.  Results:   For this cohort, 22 of the 64 analyzed fractions showed body contour changes ≥1 cm. The treated doses showed deviations from prescribed dose ranging from -2.4% to 1.3% per fraction. After the plan was adapted, 4 of the 5 cases showed an improvement (P < .05) in target dose for the entirety of treatment. The 1 patient not showing improvement had negligible dose change due to contour variation.

Methods and materials:   Ten prostate cancer patients treated with proton therapy underwent weekly verification computed tomographic (CT) scans. US, SFUD, SFUD-opt, and IMPT treatment plans were created and recalculated on weekly verification scans evaluating 2-field daily and single-field target coverage and OAR constraints.  Results:   The average (±standard deviation) planning target volume conformity index for US, SFUD, SFUD-opt, and IMPT clinical plans was 0.53 ± 0.06, 0.78 ± 0.05, 0.78 ± 0.04, and 0.78 ± 0.03, respectively. The average 2-field internal target volume (ITV) coverage was significantly higher for both US and SFUD when individually compared with SFUD-opt and IMPT. There was no significant difference between US and SFUD ITV coverage when comparing 2-field daily versus single-field daily delivery. The average single-field coverage was greatest using US and SFUD with 99% of the ITV being covered by 96.8% ± 0.9% and 96.7% ± 1.3%, respectively, compared with 95.5% ± 0.7% for SFUD-opt. There were no significant differences among the 4 plans regarding OAR dose constraints assessed.  Conclusions:   Pencil beam scanning techniques are more conformal than US and, when optimized only for uniform target coverage from each field, can be equally as robust relative to anatomic interfraction variations for prostate cancer patients treated with a single field per day technique.

There has been concern expressed that high V150 may be associated with higher rates of urinary retention and morbidity.  Methods and materials:   We reviewed 207 consecutive cases of prostate brachytherapy treated with palladium 103 ((103)Pd; n = 140) or iodine 125 ((125)I; n = 67). Prescribed doses for (103)Pd monotherapy and boost were 124 and 90 Gy, respectively; for (125)I, the corresponding doses were 160 and 120 Gy. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and every 6 months thereafter.  Results:   Median follow-up at the time of analysis was 18 months. For (103)Pd, the mean intraoperative volume and V150 were 30.3 cm(3) and 72%, respectively; corresponding values for (125)I were 38.3 cm(3) and 59%, respectively. Two of the patients treated with iodine and 9 treated with palladium experienced acute urinary retention, which was not statistically significant (P = .48). The rectal V100 for (103)Pd was significantly less than that for (125)I (P < .001). The mean baseline, 1-month, and 12-month American Urologic Association (AUA) scores for (103)Pd were 8.5, 19.7, and 8.2, respectively; for (125)I, the values were 7.4, 17.1, and 13.4, respectively. At 12 months, the AUA scores returned to baseline in the (103)Pd-treated patients, whereas scores in (125)I-treated patients remained elevated (P = .005). High V150 did not appear to cause undue risk of urinary retention or morbidity based on logistic regression analysis of patients treated with monotherapy performed with either isotope.  Conclusions:   The risk of urinary retention was low, despite high V150 values for both isotopes. In patients treated with brachytherapy alone, no significant increase in urinary morbidity was seen in relation to V150.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for matching and prostate delineation; however, at a spatial and temporal distance from the planning CT, identical rectal and vesical filling is difficult to achieve. In addition, MRI may also be impaired by metal artifacts, even resulting in spatial image distortion. Here, we present a method to define prostate target volumes based on ultrasound images acquired during CT simulation and online-matched to the CT data set directly at the planning CT.  Methods and materials:   A 78-year-old patient with cT2cNxM0 prostate cancer with bilateral metal THRs was referred to external beam radiation therapy. T2-weighted MRI was performed on the day of the planning CT with preparation according to a protocol for reproducible bladder and rectal filling. The planning CT was obtained with the immediate acquisition of a 3-dimensional ultrasound data set with a dedicated stereotactic ultrasound system for online intermodality image matching referenced to the isocenter by ceiling-mounted infrared cameras. MRI (offline) and ultrasound images (online) were thus both matched to the CT images for planning. Daily image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) was performed with transabdominal ultrasound and compared with cone beam CT.  Results:   Because of variations in bladder and rectal filling and metal-induced image distortion in MRI, soft-tissue-based matching of the MRI to CT was not sufficient for unequivocal prostate target definition. Ultrasound-based images could be matched, and prostate, seminal vesicles, and target volumes were reliably defined. Daily IGRT could be successfully completed with transabdominal ultrasound with good accordance between cone beam CT and ultrasound.  Conclusions:   For prostate cancer patients with bilateral THRs causing artifacts in planning CTs, ultrasound referenced to the isocenter of the CT simulator and acquired with intermodal online coregistration directly at the planning CT is a fast and easy method to reliably delineate the prostate and target volumes and for daily IGRT.""","""['Judit Boda-Heggemann', 'Stefan Haneder', 'Michael Ehmann', 'Dwi Seno Kuncoro Sihono', 'Hansjörg Wertz', 'Sabine Mai', 'Stefan Kegel', 'Sigrun Heitmann', 'Sandra von Swietochowski', 'Frank Lohr', 'Frederik Wenz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'A feature alignment score for online cone-beam CT-based image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Does Interfraction Cone Beam Computed Tomography Improve Target Localization in Prostate Bed Radiotherapy?', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'ACR Appropriateness Criteria for external beam radiation therapy treatment planning for clinically localized prostate cancer, part II of II.', 'ACR Appropriateness Criteria® external beam radiation therapy treatment planning for clinically localized prostate cancer, part I of II.']"""

Rectal and sexual toxicity profiles have been favorable compared with other radiation techniques and surgery.

SBRT is technically more challenging, requiring precise geometric targeting with in-room image guidance. The use of large doses per fraction potentially provides unique biological effects on both tumor and normal tissues.

Methods:   The GRPR antagonist JMV594 (H-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2) was conjugated to NODA-MPAA for labeling with Al(18)F. JMV5132 was radiolabeled with (68)Ga and (18)F, and JMV4168 was labeled with (68)Ga for comparison. The inhibitory concentration of 50% values for binding GRPR of JMV4168, JMV5132, (nat)Ga-JMV4168, and (nat)Ga-JMV5132 were determined in a competition-binding assay using GRPR-overexpressing PC-3 tumors. The tumor-targeting characteristics of the compounds were assessed in mice bearing subcutaneous PC-3 xenografts. Small-animal PET/CT images were acquired, and tracer biodistribution was determined by ex vivo measurements.  Results:   JMV5132 was labeled with (18)F in a novel 1-pot, 1-step procedure within 20 min, without need for further purification and resulting in a specific activity of 35 MBq/nmol. Inhibitory concentration of 50% values (in nM) for GRPR binding of JMV5132, JMV4168, (nat)Ga-JMV5132, (nat)Ga-JMV4168, and Al(nat)F-JMV5132 were 6.8 (95% confidence intervals [CIs], 4.6-10.0), 13.2 (95% CIs, 5.9-29.3), 3.0 (95% CIs, 1.5-6.0), 3.2 (95% CIs, 1.8-5.9), and 10.0 (95% CIs, 6.3-16.0), respectively. In mice with subcutaneous PC-3 xenografts, all tracers cleared rapidly from the blood, exclusively via the kidneys for (68)Ga-JMV4168 and partially hepatobiliary for (68)Ga-JMV5132 and Al(18)F-JMV5132. Two hours after injection, the uptake of (68)Ga-JMV4168, (68)Ga-JMV5132, and Al(18)F-JMV5132 in PC-3 tumors was 5.96 ± 1.39, 5.24 ± 0.29, 5.30 ± 0.98 (percentage injected dose per gram), respectively. GRPR specificity was confirmed by significantly reduced tumor uptake of the 3 tracers after coinjection of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled JMV4168 or JMV5132.

No metastases occurred in AS patients. Medical support in managing the disease reached high scores in all groups, the highest in AS.  Conclusion:   The data enable a differentiated comparative analysis of patient and tumor characteristics of each treatment group. Indication of AS was predominantly consistent with the guideline. The high rate of AS termination based on the physician's recommendation rather than on clinical progression is remarkable, and may be interpreted as a kind of insecurity in dealing with AS.

The purpose of this study was to test psychometric properties of the questionnaire FoP-Q-12, to examine age and gender differences of FoP, and to explore prognostic factors of FoP.  Methods:   A sample of 2059 patients with a cancer diagnosis who had participated in a cancer rehabilitation program was examined 6 months after discharge from the rehabilitation clinic. Participants filled in the Fear of Progression questionnaire FoP-Q-12, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety subscale), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire GAD-2 and answered a list of questions concerning their cancer disease.  Results:   Reliability of the FoP-Q-12 (Cronbach's alpha = 0.90) was good. While exploratory factorial analysis supported the one-dimensional structure of the FoP-Q-12, confirmatory factorial analysis only partially supported the one-dimensional model. A proportion of 16.7 % of the sample scored above the FoP-Q-12 cutoff score. Females showed higher FoP scores than males (effect size d = 0.52), and older patients had slightly lower levels of FoP than younger patients (d = 0.17). There were substantial and significant correlations between FoP-Q-12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety (r = 0.71) as well as GAD-2 anxiety (r = 0.57). The highest FoP mean scores were found for the following cancer locations: ovary (M = 29.5), thyroid gland (M = 28.8), and breast (M = 27.9), while the lowest scores were found for Hodgkin lymphoma (M = 23.6), testis (M = 21.8), and prostate (M = 21.7).

We compared outcomes after laparoendoscopic single site PL (LESSPL) with those after conventional multiport laparoscopic PL (MLPL).  Methods:   A retrospective case-control study was carried out at the authors' center. For LESSPL the reusable X-Cone single port was combined with straight and prebent laparoscopic instruments and an additional 3 mm needlescopic grasper. MLPL was performed via four trocars of different sizes using standard laparoscopic instruments.  Results:   Patients who underwent either LESSPL (n = 20) or MLPL (n = 97) between January 2008 and July 2013, were included in the study. Demographic data were comparable between groups. Patients in the LESSPL group tended to be older and had a significantly higher ASA-score. The mean operating time was 172.4 ± 34.1 min for LESSPL and 116.6 ± 40.1 min for MLPL (P < .001). During LESSPL, no conversion to MLPL was necessary. An average of 12 lymph nodes per patient was retrieved, with no significant difference between study groups. Postoperative pain scores were similar between groups. The hospital stay was 2.3 ± 0.7 days after LESSPL and 3.1 ± 1.2 days after MLPL (P = .01). Two days postoperatively, significantly more patients after LESSPL than after MLPL recovered their normal physical activity (P < .001). Six months postoperatively, no complications were registered in the LESSPL group and cosmetic results were excellent.  Conclusions:   In the present study, shorter hospitalization and quicker postoperative recovery were major benefits of LESSPL over MLPL.

We previously demonstrated that combination simvastatin (SIM) and metformin (MET) ameliorates critical Warburg effect-related metabolic aberrations of C4-2B cells, synergistically and significantly decreases CRPC cell viability and metastatic properties, with minimal effect on normal prostate epithelial cells, and inhibits primary prostate tumor growth, metastasis, and biochemical failure in an orthotopic model of metastatic CRPC, more effectively than docetaxel chemotherapy. Several modes of cell death activated by individual treatment of SIM or MET have been reported; however, the cell death process induced by combination SIM and MET treatment in metastatic CRPC cells remains unknown. This must be determined prior to advancing combination SIM and MET to clinical trial for metastatic CRPC. Treatment of C4-2B cells with combination 4 μM SIM and 2 mM MET (SIM+MET) led to significant G1-phase cell cycle arrest and decrease in the percentage of DNA-replicating cells in the S-phase by 24 h; arrest was sustained throughout the 96-h treatment. SIM+MET treatment led to enhanced autophagic flux in C4-2B cells by 72-96 h, ascertained by increased LC3B-II (further enhanced with lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine) and reduced Sequestosome-1 protein expression, significantly increased percentage of acidic vesicular organelle-positive cells, and increased autophagic structure accumulation assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Chloroquine, however, could not rescue CRPC cell viability, eliminating autophagic cell death; rather, autophagy was upregulated by C4-2B cells in attempt to withstand chemotherapy. Instead, SIM+MET treatment led to Ripk1- and Ripk3-dependent necrosis by 48-96 h, determined by propidium iodide-Annexin V flow cytometry, increase in Ripk1 and Ripk3 protein expression, necrosome formation, HMGB-1 extracellular release, and necrotic induction and viability rescue with necrostatin-1 and Ripk3-targeting siRNA. The necrosis-inducing capacity of SIM+MET may make these drugs a highly-effective treatment for apoptosis- and chemotherapy-resistant metastatic CRPC cells.""","""['M A Babcook', 'R M Sramkoski', 'H Fujioka', 'F Daneshgari', 'A Almasan', 'S Shukla', 'R R Nanavaty', 'S Gupta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Synergistic simvastatin and metformin combination chemotherapy for osseous metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'NPRL2 promotes docetaxel chemoresistance in castration resistant prostate cancer cells by regulating autophagy through the mTOR pathway.', 'Targeting autophagy overcomes Enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells and improves therapeutic response in a xenograft model.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'RIPK1 and RIPK3: critical regulators of inflammation and cell death.', 'Metformin and cancer hallmarks: shedding new lights on therapeutic repurposing.', 'Metformin and simvastatin synergistically suppress endothelin 1-induced hypoxia and angiogenesis in multiple cancer types.', 'Classical epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and alternative cell death process-driven blebbishield metastatic-witch (BMW) pathways to cancer metastasis.', 'Metformin and Cancer Hallmarks: Molecular Mechanisms in Thyroid, Prostate and Head and Neck Cancer Models.', 'New Insight into the Effects of Metformin on Diabetic Retinopathy, Aging and Cancer: Nonapoptotic Cell Death, Immunosuppression, and Effects beyond the AMPK Pathway.']"""

We hypothesize that germline variation modulates susceptibility to aggressive prostate cancer. The goal of this work is to identify susceptibility genes using the C57BL/6-Tg(TRAMP)8247Ng/J (TRAMP) mouse model of neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed in transgene-positive (TRAMPxNOD/ShiLtJ) F2 intercross males (n = 228), which facilitated identification of 11 loci associated with aggressive disease development. Microarray data derived from 126 (TRAMPxNOD/ShiLtJ) F2 primary tumors were used to prioritize candidate genes within QTLs, with candidate genes deemed as being high priority when possessing both high levels of expression-trait correlation and a proximal expression QTL. This process enabled the identification of 35 aggressive prostate tumorigenesis candidate genes. The role of these genes in aggressive forms of human prostate cancer was investigated using two concurrent approaches. First, logistic regression analysis in two human prostate gene expression datasets revealed that expression levels of five genes (CXCL14, ITGAX, LPCAT2, RNASEH2A, and ZNF322) were positively correlated with aggressive prostate cancer and two genes (CCL19 and HIST1H1A) were protective for aggressive prostate cancer. Higher than average levels of expression of the five genes that were positively correlated with aggressive disease were consistently associated with patient outcome in both human prostate cancer tumor gene expression datasets. Second, three of these five genes (CXCL14, ITGAX, and LPCAT2) harbored polymorphisms associated with aggressive disease development in a human GWAS cohort consisting of 1,172 prostate cancer patients. This study is the first example of using a systems genetics approach to successfully identify novel susceptibility genes for aggressive prostate cancer.

The study determined the effect of A muricata on human BPH-1 cells and prostate organ.  Methods:   The MTT assay was performed on BPH-1 cells using the aqueous leaf extract of A muricata. Cells (1 × 10(5) per well) were challenged with 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/mL extract for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell proliferation and morphology were examined microscopically. BPH-1 cells (1 × 10(4) per well) were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated for 48 hours with 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/mL A muricata extract. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed using mRNA extracted from the cells. Possible target genes, Bax and Bcl-2, were examined. Twenty F344 male rats (≈200 g) were gavaged 30 mg/mL (10 rats) and 300 mg/mL (10 rats) and fed ad libitum alongside 10 control rats. Rats were sacrificed after 60 days. The prostate, seminal vesicles, and testes were harvested for histological examination.  Results:   Annona muricata demonstrated antiproliferative effects with an IC50 of 1.36 mg/mL. Best results were obtained after 48 hours, with near cell extinction at 72 hours. Bax gene was upregulated, while Bcl-2 was downregulated. Normal histological architecture was observed for all testes. Seminal vesicle was significantly reduced in test groups (P < .05) and demonstrated marked atrophy with increased cellularity and the acinii, empty of secretion. Prostate of test groups were reduced with epithelial lining showing pyknotic nucleus, condensation, and marginalization of the nuclear material, characteristic of apoptosis of the glandular epithelium.

However, published data exist for small patient cohorts only. The aim of this evaluation was to analyse the diagnostic value of (68)Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT in a large cohort and the influence of several possibly interacting variables.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis in 319 patients who underwent (68)Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT from 2011 to 2014. Potential influences of several factors such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and doubling time (DT), Gleason score (GSC), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), age and amount of injected tracer were evaluated. Histological verification was performed in 42 patients after the (68)Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT. Tracer uptake was measured in 901 representative tumour lesions.  Results:   In 82.8% of the patients at least one lesion indicative of PCa was detected. Tumor-detection was positively associated with PSA level and ADT. GSC and PSA-DT were not associated with tumor-detection. The average maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of tumour lesions was 13.3 ± 14.6 (0.7-122.5). Amongst lesions investigated by histology, 30 were false-negative in 4 different patients, and all other lesions (n = 416) were true-positive or true-negative. A lesion-based analysis of sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) revealed values of 76.6%, 100%, 91.4% and 100%. A patient-based analysis revealed a sensitivity of 88.1%. Of 116 patients available for follow-up, 50 received local therapy after (68)Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT.  Conclusion:   (68)Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT can detect recurrent PCa in a high number of patients. In addition, the radiotracer is highly specific for PCa.

It was hypothesized that A2 failure may have a different prognosis.  Methods:   Data for 2799 eligible patients from Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9202 and RTOG 9413 were analyzed. BF was defined according to the 1997 American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology consensus definition as A1 for PSA failure or as A2 for the start of salvage hormone therapy before 3 consecutive PSA rises.  Results:   Rates of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.0; P < .0001) and distant metastasis (DM; HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.0; P < .0001) were greater with A2 failure. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 88.2% and 74.6% for A1 and A2, respectively (P < .0001), and the DM rates were 15.7% and 29.0%, respectively (P < .0001). The DM rate was greater at 5 years for A2 patients with DM as the first sign of failure versus patients with other A2 failures (87.3% vs 11.7%, P < .001), and this also correlated with worse OS at 5 years: 81.1% for A2 failure without DM and 52.8% with DM (P < .001).

Methods:   The study included 65 individuals with prostate examinations (27 tumors and 38 controls). Manual AIFs were individually extracted and also averaged to obtain a population AIF. Automatic AIFs were individually obtained by applying PCA to volumetric DCE-MR imaging data and finding the highest correlation of the PCs with a reference AIF.

The different AIFs were used as inputs to the pharmacokinetic model and correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman plots and analysis of variance tests were obtained to compare the results.  Results:   Automatic PCA-based AIFs were successfully extracted in all cases. The manual and PCA-based AIFs showed good correlation (r between pharmacokinetic parameters ranging from 0.74 to 0.95), with differences below the manual individual variability (RMSCV up to 27.3%).

We investigated oxidative regulatory responses of PKC-δ and PKC-ε to cystine dimethyl ester (CDME), a metabolic precursor of cystine, which, by inducing release of cellular cystine stimulates apoptosis in different prostate cancer cells, PC3 and LNCaP, compared to normal RWPE1 cells.

This apoptotic regulation was confirmed by immunoblot analyses and specific PKC enzyme assays in immunoprecipitated samples. Additionally, inhibition of PKC-δ by small interfering RNA (siRNA) proved that CDME-induced cell death was dependent on PKC-δ activity in prostate cancer cells.

This occurs through binding of NRIF3 or its 30 amino acid Death Domain-1 (DD1) region to the transcriptional repressor, DIF-1 (DD1 Interacting Factor-1). DIF-1 acts in a wide variety of breast cancer cells but not other cell types to repress the pro-apoptotic gene, FASTKD2. Expression of NRIF3 or DD1 inactivates the DIF-1 repressor leading to rapid derepression of FASTKD2, which initiates apoptosis within 5-8 h of expression. Although FASTKD2 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, it does not require mitochondrial localization to initiate apoptosis.  Methods:   Androgen dependent LNCaP cells as well as two androgen independent LNCaP cell lines (LNCaP-AI and LNCaP-abl) were studied and LNCaP-AI cells were engineered to conditionally express DD1 or the inactive DD1-S28A with 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay. FASTKD2 is related to 4 other proteins encoded in the human genome (FASTKD1, 3, 4, 5). All contain a poorly conserved putative bipartite kinase domain designated as FAST1_FAST2. We examined whether expression of any of the other FASTKD isoforms leads to apoptosis and sought to identify the region of FASTKD2 necessary to initiate the apoptotic pathway.  Results:   Of the FASTKD1-5 isoforms only expression of FASTKD2 leads to apoptosis. Although, the NRIF3/DD1/DIF-1 pathway does not mediate apoptosis of a wide variety of non-breast cancer cell lines, because of certain similarities and gene signatures between breast and prostate cancer we explored whether the NRIF3/DD1/DIF-1/FASTKD2 pathway mediates apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. We found that the pathway leads to apoptosis in LNCaP cells, including the two androgen-independent LNCaP cell lines that are generally resistant to apoptosis. Lastly, we identified that FASTKD2-mediated apoptosis is initiated by the 81 amino acid FAST2 region.  Conclusions:   The NRIF3/DIF-1/FASTKD2 pathway acts as a ""death switch"" in breast and prostate cancer cells. Deciphering how this pathway is regulated and how FASTKD2 initiates the apoptotic response will allow for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer or Tamoxifen-unresponsive Estrogen Receptor negative tumors as well as metastatic breast or prostate cancer.""","""['Sharmistha Das', 'Kay T Yeung', 'Muktar A Mahajan', 'Herbert H Samuels']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A novel transcription complex that selectively modulates apoptosis of breast cancer cells through regulation of FASTKD2.', 'Identification of a novel pathway that selectively modulates apoptosis of breast cancer cells.', 'The NRIF3 family of transcriptional coregulators induces rapid and profound apoptosis in breast cancer cells.', 'Structure and function of GC79/TRPS1, a novel androgen-repressible apoptosis gene.', 'A candidate gene approach to searching for low-penetrance breast and prostate cancer genes.', 'FASTK family of genes linked to cancer.', 'Phosphorylation of CENP-R by Aurora B regulates kinetochore-microtubule attachment for accurate chromosome segregation.', 'The mitochondrial RNA granule modulates manganese-dependent cell toxicity.', 'A novel homozygous missense mutation in the FASTKD2 gene leads to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.', 'Systematic Analysis of FASTK Gene Family Alterations in Cancer.']"""

CaP progression is linked to several somatic AR mutational changes that endow upon the AR dramatic gain-of-function properties. One of the most common somatic mutations identified is Thr877-to-Ala (T877A), located in the ligand-binding domain, that results in a receptor capable of promiscuous binding and activation by a variety of steroid hormones and ligands including estrogens, progestins, glucocorticoids, and several anti-androgens. In an attempt to further define somatic mutated AR gain-of-function properties, as a consequence of its promiscuous ligand binding, we undertook a proteomic/network analysis approach to characterize the protein interactome of the mutant T877A-AR in LNCaP cells under eight different ligand-specific treatments (dihydrotestosterone, mibolerone, R1881, testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, dexamethasone, and cyproterone acetate). In extending the analysis of our multi-ligand complexes of the mutant T877A-AR we observed significant enrichment of specific complexes between normal and primary prostatic tumors, which were furthermore correlated with known clinical outcomes. Further analysis of certain mutant T877A-AR complexes showed specific population preferences distinguishing primary prostatic disease between white (non-Hispanic) vs. African-American males. Moreover, these cancer-related AR-protein complexes demonstrated predictive survival outcomes specific to CaP, and not for breast, lung, lymphoma or medulloblastoma cancers.

However, 4% already present with metastatic disease. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a fundamental process in carcinogenesis that has been shown to be involved in prostate cancer progression. The main event in epithelial-mesenchymal transition is the repression of E-cadherin by transcription factors, but the process is also regulated by microRNAs. The aim of this study was to analyze gene and microRNA expression involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in localized prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and correlate with clinicopathological findings. We studied 51 fresh frozen tissue samples from patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) treated by radical prostatectomy and three metastatic prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145, PC3). The expression of 10 genes and 18 miRNAs were assessed by real-time PCR. The patients were divided into groups according to Gleason score, pathological stage, preoperative PSA, biochemical recurrence, and risk group for correlation with clinicopathological findings. The majority of localized PCa cases showed an epithelial phenotype, with overexpression of E-cadherin and underexpression of the mesenchymal markers. MiRNA-200 family members and miRNAs 203, 205, 183, 373, and 21 were overexpressed, while miRNAs 9, 495, 29b, and 1 were underexpressed. Low-expression levels of miRNAs 200b, 30a, and 1 were significantly associated with pathological stage. Lower expression of miR-200b was also associated with a Gleason score ≥ 8 and shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival. Furthermore, low-expression levels of miR-30a and high-expression levels of Vimentin and Twist1 were observed in the high-risk group. Compared with the primary tumor, the metastatic cell lines showed significantly higher expression levels of miR-183 and Twist1. In summary, miRNAs 200b, 30a, 1, and 183 and the genes Twist1 and Vimentin might play important roles in the progression of prostate cancer and may eventually become important prognostic markers.""","""['Betina Katz', 'Sabrina T Reis', 'Nayara I Viana', 'Denis R Morais', 'Caio M Moura', 'Nelson Dip', 'Iran A Silva', 'Alexandre Iscaife', 'Miguel Srougi', 'Katia R M Leite']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Evaluation of an epithelial plasticity biomarker panel in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'MiR-301a regulates E-cadherin expression and is predictive of prostate cancer recurrence.', 'Aberrant expression of microRNAs involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of HT-29 cell line.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'The interplay between microRNAs and Twist1 transcription factor: a systematic review.', 'Intratumoral Restoration of miR-137 Plus Cholesterol Favors Homeostasis of the miR-137/Coactivator p160/AR Axis and Negatively Modulates Tumor Progression in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Adipose Tissue-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Contribute to Phenotypic Plasticity of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Prostate Cancer-Associated miRNAs in Saliva: First Steps to an Easily Accessible and Reliable Screening Tool.', 'Hsa-miR-183-5p Modulates Cell Adhesion by Repression of ITGB1 Expression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?']"""

Here we hypothesized that the structural alterations in the basal lamina associated with age can induce mechanotransduction pathways in prostate epithelial cells (PECs) to promote invasiveness and cancer progression. To demonstrate this, we developed a 3D model of PEC acini in which thickening and stiffening of basal lamina matrix was induced by advanced glycation end-product (AGE)-dependent non-enzymatic crosslinking of its major components, collagen IV and laminin. We used this model to demonstrate that antibody targeted blockade of CTLD2, the second of eight C-type lectin-like domains in Endo180 (CD280, CLEC13E, KIAA0709, MRC2, TEM9, uPARAP) that can recognize glycosylated collagens, reversed actinomyosin-based contractility [myosin-light chain-2 (MLC2) phosphorylation], loss of cell polarity, loss of cell-cell junctions, luminal infiltration and basal invasion induced by AGE-modified basal lamina matrix in PEC acini. Our in vitro results were concordant with luminal occlusion of acini in the prostate glands of adult Endo180(Δ) (Ex2-6/) (Δ) (Ex2-6) mice, with constitutively exposed CTLD2 and decreased survival of men with early (non-invasive) prostate cancer with high epithelial Endo180 expression and levels of AGE. These findings indicate that AGE-dependent modification of the basal lamina induces invasive behaviour in non-transformed PECs via a molecular mechanism linked to cancer progression. This study provides a rationale for targeting CTLD2 in Endo180 in prostate cancer and other pathologies in which increased basal lamina thickness and tissue stiffness are driving factors. © 2014 The Authors.

This study provides RR estimates using extensive and specific PC family history.  Methods:   A retrospective population-based study was undertaken to estimate RRs for PC based on complete family history of PC. A total of 635,443 males, all with ancestral genealogy data, were analyzed. RRs for PC were determined based upon PC rates estimated from males with no PC family history (without PC in first, second, or third degree relatives). RRs were determined for a variety of constellations, for example, number of first through third degree relatives; named (grandfather, father, uncle, cousins, brothers); maternal, paternal relationships, and age of onset.  Results:   In the 635,443 males analyzed, 18,105 had PC. First-degree RRs ranged from 2.46 (=1 first-degree relative affected, CI = 2.39-2.53) to 7.65 (=4 first-degree relatives affected, CI = 6.28-9.23). Second-degree RRs for probands with 0 affected first-degree relatives ranged from 1.51 (≥1 second-degree relative affected, CI = 1.47-1.56) to 3.09 (≥5 second-degree relatives affected, CI = 2.32-4.03). Third-degree RRs with 0 affected first- and 0 affected second-degree relatives ranged from 1.15 (≥1 affected third-degree relative, CI = 1.12-1.19) to 1.50 (≥5 affected third-degree relatives, CI = 1.35-1.66). RRs based on age at diagnosis were higher for earlier age at diagnoses; for example, RR = 5.54 for ≥1 first-degree relative diagnosed before age 50 years (CI = 1.12-1.19) and RR = 1.78 for >1 second-degree relative diagnosed before age 50 years, CI = 1.33, 2.33. RRs for equivalent maternal versus paternal family history were not significantly different.  Conclusions:   A more complete PC family history using close and distant relatives and age at diagnosis results in a wider range of estimates of individual RR that are potentially more accurate than RRs estimated from summary family history. The presence of PC in second- and even third-degree relatives contributes significantly to risk. Maternal family history is just as significant as paternal family history. PC RRs based on a proband's complete constellation of affected relatives will allow patients and care providers to make more informed screening, monitoring, and treatment decisions.""","""['Frederick Albright', 'Robert A Stephenson', 'Neeraj Agarwal', 'Craig C Teerlink', 'William T Lowrance', 'James M Farnham', 'Lisa A Cannon Albright']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Population-Based Relative Risks for Lung Cancer Based on Complete Family History of Lung Cancer.', 'Population-based relative risks for specific family history constellations of breast cancer.', 'Relative Risks for Lethal Prostate Cancer Based on Complete Family History of Prostate Cancer Death.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of familial prostate cancer risk.', 'Hereditary aspects of prostate cancer.', 'High-Risk Pedigree Study Identifies LRBA (rs62346982) as a Likely Predisposition Variant for Prostate Cancer.', 'Incidence and Predicting Factors of Histopathological Features at Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy in the mpMRI Era: Results of a Single Tertiary Referral Center.', 'DNA repair deficiency as circulating biomarker in prostate cancer.', 'Carriage of Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr Variants of ELAC2 Gene and Risk Factors in Patients with Prostate Cancer in Burkina Faso.', 'Inflammatory Cytokine: An Attractive Target for Cancer Treatment.']"""

F10 is a new polymeric fluoropyrimidine drug-candidate that displays strong activity with minimal systemic toxicity in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer and other malignancies. The effects of exogenous Zn(2+) or Zn(2+) chelation for enhancing F10 cytotoxicity are investigated as is the role of Omi/HtrA2, a serine protease that promotes apoptosis in response to cellular stress.  Methods:   To test the hypothesis that the pro-apoptotic effects of F10 could be enhanced by modulating intracellular Zn(2+) we investigated cell-permeable and cell-impermeable Zn(2+) chelators and exogenous Zn(2+) and evaluated cell viability and apoptosis in cellular models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; PC3, C4-2). The role of Omi/HtrA2 for modulating apoptosis was evaluated by pharmacological inhibition and Western blotting.  Results:   Exogenous Zn(2+) initially reduced prostate cancer cell viability but these effects were transitory and were ineffective at enhancing F10 cytotoxicity. The cell-permeable Zn(2+) -chelator tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and enhanced the pro-apoptotic effects of F10. The pro-apoptotic effects of Zn(2+) -chelation in combination with F10 treatment were enhanced by inhibiting Omi/HtrA2 implicating this serine protease as a novel target for prostate cancer treatment.

Period method RSRs for 2006-to-2008 were derived using general population life tables adjusted for cancer mortality and then compared with estimates derived using corresponding unadjusted life tables.  Results:   For all cancers combined, the use of general population life tables to derive expected survival probabilities overestimated RSRs by 0.6 (1-year), 2.4 (5-year) and 4.6 (10-year) percentage units. Biases in 5-year survival were highest among males (3.0) and among people aged 75 to 99 at diagnosis (4.1). The bias was negligible for most individual cancers; biases were highest for prostate cancer, followed by colorectal and female breast cancer.

Methods:   Prostate cancer (PC-3) cells were treated with either apigenin or bortezomib, and proliferation inhibition was correlated with proteasomal biochemistry, ER-degradation and cell apoptosis.  Results:   Apigenin specifically inhibited only chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasome without affecting trypsin and caspase-like activities, which was in contrast to the non-specific inhibition of all the three activities by bortezomib. Apigenin selectively increased the protein levels of ER-β at 1.8 and 10.0 µM (without affecting mRNA levels) and preferentially accumulated ubiquitinated ER-β over ER-α in PC-3. Apigenin-treated cells exhibited increased ER-β interactions with ubiquitin-protein ligase E6AP, downregulated PSMA5 (α-5 subunit for assembly of 20S proteasome) without affecting PSMB1 (β-1 subunit), PSMB2 (β-2 subunit) and PSMB5 (β-5 subunit, whose overexpression by bortezomib causes drug resistance) of proteasome at mRNA levels. Caspase-3 activation in PC-3 by apigenin was dependent on caspase-8 activity but independent of mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The deubiquitinase USP14 activity, which antagonizes degradation of proteins via proteasome, was significantly increased by apigenin treatment.  Conclusions:   Apigenin selectively inhibits proteasomal degradation of tumor suppressor ER-β by specifically inhibiting chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasome, preventing its assembly via PSMA5 and inhibiting USP14 enzyme activity in prostate cancer cells, resulting in cancer cell apoptosis. Unlike bortezomib, apigenin's actions are subtle, precise, mechanistically distinct and capable of abstaining drug resistance.""","""['Vishal Singh', 'Vikas Sharma', 'Vikas Verma', 'Deepti Pandey', 'Santosh K Yadav', 'Jagdamba P Maikhuri', 'Gopal Gupta']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur J Nutr""","""['Inhibition of proteasome activity by the dietary flavonoid apigenin is associated with growth inhibition in cultured breast cancer cells and xenografts.', 'Phosphorylation of activation function-1 regulates proteasome-dependent nuclear mobility and E6-associated protein ubiquitin ligase recruitment to the estrogen receptor beta.', 'PSMA5 promotes the tumorigenic process of prostate cancer and is related to bortezomib resistance.', 'The Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway and Epigenetic Modifications in Cancer.', 'Breast cancer cells: Modulation by melatonin and the ubiquitin-proteasome system--a review.', 'Bioinformatic Analysis Identifying PSMB 1/2/3/4/6/8/9/10 as Prognostic Indicators in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Bayesian hierarchical lasso Cox model: A 9-gene prognostic signature for overall survival in gastric cancer in an Asian population.', 'Role of Induced Programmed Cell Death in the Chemopreventive Potential of Apigenin.', 'USP14: Structure, Function, and Target Inhibition.', 'Beta-Sitosterol Promotes Milk Protein and Fat Syntheses-Related Genes in Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells.']"""

Methods and materials:   Ten representative patients with MRI-detected, biopsy-proven local recurrences of prostate adenocarcinoma after RP were selected. Areas of recurrence were delineated on individual MRI images, and then mapped onto axial and sagittal ""template"" MRI images to compositely demonstrate the documented areas of recurrence. Coverage of these anatomic areas of recurrence was then evaluated by applying Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-consensus PF-CTV contours to a postoperative computed tomographic template.  Results:   The median age at the time of RP was 61 years (range, 50-73). In the superoinferior direction, recurrences ranged from the superior retrovesical region, to the inferior retrovesical region, to the posterior anastomosis, and as inferiorly as the posterior urogenital diaphragm. In the anteroposterior direction, the areas of recurrence ranged from involving the posterior bladder wall anteriorly to invading the rectum posteriorly. Recurrences were found at the center, right, and left of the prostate and seminal vesicle fossa. When target volumes were delineated using RTOG-defined consensus PF-CTV contours, coverage was marginal on recurrences in the posterolateral aspects of the CTV near the rectum and mesorectal fascia and lacking on recurrences occurring inferiorly at the posterior urogenital diaphragm.

Methods and materials:   From an institutional cohort of 575 patients treated with SRT between 1986 and 2010, the Stephenson nomogram variables were retrospectively collected and available for 179 patients. The prognostic impact of the Stephenson nomogram on 6-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), FFM, and PCSS was assessed on univariate and multivariate analysis using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. The prognostic utility of the Stephenson nomogram was compared with individual pretreatment, treatment, and clinical characteristics using concordance indices.  Results:   In the 179 patients with all available nomogram variables, median follow-up was 85.0 months (interquartile range [IQR], 53-113) and 6-year FFBF, FFM, and PCSS were 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30-46), 79% (95% CI, 73-85), and 96% (95% CI, 92-100), respectively.

Disease characteristics, treatment information, and clinical outcomes data were tabulated for each patient. The PSA response during SRT was defined as a PSA decline of at least 0.2 ng/mL compared with the pretreatment PSA level. Bivariate and multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards modeling were performed to identify predictors of biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Sixty-four patients met eligibility criteria for this analysis. Median PSA before SRT was 0.63 ng/mL (interquartile range: 0.42-1.00).

This initiative, led by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation, fosters conversations between physicians and patients about treatments and tests that may be overused, unnecessary, or potentially harmful.  Methods and materials:   Potential items were initially compiled using an online survey. They were then evaluated and refined by a work group representing the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Clinical Affairs and Quality, Health Policy, and Government Relations Councils. Literature reviews were carried out to support the recommendation and narrative, as well as to provide references for each item. A final list of 5 items was then selected by the ASTRO Board of Directors.  Results:   ASTRO's 5 recommendations for the Choosing Wisely campaign are the following: (1) Don't initiate whole-breast radiation therapy as a part of breast conservation therapy in women age ≥50 with early-stage invasive breast cancer without considering shorter treatment schedules; (2) don't initiate management of low-risk prostate cancer without discussing active surveillance; (3) don't routinely use extended fractionation schemes (>10 fractions) for palliation of bone metastases; (4) don't routinely recommend proton beam therapy for prostate cancer outside of a prospective clinical trial or registry; and (5) don't routinely use intensity modulated radiation therapy to deliver whole-breast radiation therapy as part of breast conservation therapy.  Conclusions:   The ASTRO list for the Choosing Wisely campaign highlights radiation oncology interventions that should be discussed between physicians and patients before treatment is initiated. These 5 items provide opportunities to offer higher quality and less costly care.""","""['Carol Hahn', 'Brian Kavanagh', 'Ajay Bhatnagar', 'Geraldine Jacobson', 'Stephen Lutz', 'Caroline Patton', 'Louis Potters', 'Michael Steinberg']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Choosing wisely.', ""Choosing wisely in headache medicine: the American Headache Society's list of five things physicians and patients should question."", 'Select Choices in Benign Breast Disease: An Initiative of the American Society of Breast Surgeons for the American Board of Internal Medicine Choosing Wisely® Campaign.', 'Measures of Appropriateness and Value for Breast Surgeons and Their Patients: The American Society of Breast Surgeons Choosing Wisely (®) Initiative.', ""Choosing Wisely® in Preventive Medicine: The American College of Preventive Medicine's Top 5 List of Recommendations."", ""AANEM's top five choosing wisely recommendations."", 'Shorter Radiation Regimens and Treatment Noncompletion Among Patients With Breast and Prostate Cancer in the United States: An Analysis of Racial Disparities in Access and Quality.', 'Anatomy-based prediction method for determining ipsilateral lung doses in postoperative breast radiation therapy assisted by diagnostic computed tomography images.', 'Hazardous Attitudes: Physician Decision Making in Radiation Oncology.', 'Assessment of Guideline-Nonconcordant Radiotherapy in Medicare Beneficiaries With Metastatic Cancer Near the End of Life, 2015-2017.', 'Palliative Appropriateness Criteria: A Pragmatic Method to Evaluate the Suitability of Palliative Radiotherapy Fractionation.']"""

Methods:   A transmit-only receive-only (TORO) RF system of resonators consisting of an unshielded, asymmetric, quadrature birdcage (transmit), and an endorectal (ER), linear, surface (receive) coil were developed and tested on a 3T MRI scanner. Two different ER receivers were constructed; a single-tuned ((23) Na) and a dual-tuned ((1) H/(23) Na). Both receivers were evaluated by the measurements of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and B1 homogeneity. For tissue sodium concentration (TSC) quantification, vials containing known sodium concentrations were incorporated into the ER. The system was used to measure the prostate TSC of three men (age 55 ± 5 years) with biopsy-proven prostate cancer.  Results:   B1 field inhomogeneity of the asymmetric transmitter was estimated to be less than 5%. The mean SNR measured in a region of interest within the prostate using the single-tuned ER coil was 54.0 ± 4.6.

However IKT is not widely practiced due to numerous challenges. This research explored how context influenced IKT as a means of identifying how IKT could be strengthened.  Methods:   This research investigated IKT in three health services programs for colon cancer screening, prostate cancer diagnosis, and the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Qualitative methods were used to explore contextual factors that influenced how IKT occurred, and its impact. Data were collected between September 1, 2012 and May 15, 2013 from relevant documents, observation of meetings, and interviews with researchers and decision-makers, analyzed using qualitative methods, and integrated.  Results:   Data were analyzed from 39 documents, observation of 6 meetings, and 36 interviews. IKT included interaction at meetings, joint undertaking of research, and development of guidelines. IKT was most prevalent in one program with leadership, clear goals, dedicated funding and other infrastructural resources, and an embedded researcher responsible for, and actively engaged in IKT. This program achieved a variety of social, research and health service outcomes despite mixed individual views about the value of IKT and the absence of a programmatic culture of IKT. Participants noted numerous challenges including lack of time and incentives, and recommendations to support IKT. A conceptual framework of factors that influence IKT and associated outcomes was generated, and can be used by others to plan or evaluate IKT.  Conclusions:   The findings can be applied by researchers, clinicians, managers or policy-makers to plan or improve collaborative decision-making for health services planning, delivery, evaluation or quality improvement.

Patients and methods:   Patients with mCRPC received escalating doses of i.v.

Common adverse effects included infusion-related reaction (90%), low grade headache (67%), anaemia (48%), epistaxis (43%) and fever (43%). Ten patients had stable disease on study and eight patients had declines in prostate specific antigen (PSA). Significant plasma CD105 reduction was observed at the higher dose levels. In an exploratory analysis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was increased after treatment with TRC105 and VEGF levels were associated with CD105 reduction.  Conclusion:   TRC105 was tolerated at 20 mg/kg every other week with a safety profile distinct from that of VEGF inhibitors. A significant induction of plasma VEGF was associated with CD105 reduction, suggesting anti-angiogenic activity of TRC105. An exploratory analysis showed a tentative correlation between the reduction of CD105 and a decrease in PSA velocity, suggestive of potential activity of TRC105 in the patients with mCRPC.

Reflections on referral criteria""","""Objectives:   The flow of patients between Primary Care (PC) and Specialized care (SC) is a common process. It carries many implications for the patient, physician and health system. In Urology, only benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has referral criteria. Urinary incontinence, prostate cancer (PCa), and urological ultrasound, are in the process. The aim of this paper is to communicate, with critical analysis, the characteristics of the information recorded in the referral visit (clinical reasons / rationale) and the effectiveness for urology consultation.  Methods:   Observational, descriptive and quantitative study of the referral visits made between PC/SC (Urology) in the health care area of our hospital (December 2010-September 2012). We studied: Referral Visit Database (RVD), consultation document, HORUS system, and specific referral visit survey questionnaire. RESULTS. Referral visits account for 67.89% (all first consultations), 14.79% of the total number of visits. 78% were male (mean age 53 y.o). 11.84% recorded reason for consultation (98% in referral document) with normal priority (94.67%). 34% of them were for BPH. HORUS is not exploited for the referral visit. 40% start the diagnostic process with insufficient exams. 18.1% are listed as closed process / completed. Patient satisfaction was evaluated (20%). Key points in the improvement are: improve referral visit reason for consultations, to know patient's expectations, and to develop protocols (guidelines, and/or referral criteria). CONCLUSIONS. The referral process is complex. The computer system does not include the referral reason for consultation. Institutional agreement between PC/SC Urology must be reached to ensure uniformity in the implementation and support.""","""['Carmen González Enguita', 'Miguel Sánchez Encinas', 'Manuel Carbonero García', 'Ramiro Cabello Benavente', 'Juan Vicente García Cardoso', 'Francisco Javier Dodero de Solano', 'Oscar Gómez Martín', 'Maria Luisa Sanchez Noriega']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['Evolution of primary care referrals to urology.

These non-coding RNAs are highly deregulated in prostate cancer thus facilitating progression of the disease. Among the many genes that have gained importance in this disease, Migration and invasion enhancer 1 (MIEN1), a novel gene located next to HER2/neu in the 17q12 amplicon of the human chromosome, has been shown to enhance prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, two key processes in cancer progression. MIEN1 is differentially expressed between normal and cancer cells and tissues. Understanding the regulation of MIEN1 by microRNA may enable development of better targeting strategies.  Methods:   The miRNAs that could target MIEN1 were predicted by in silico algorithms and microarray analysis. The validation for miRNA expression was performed by qPCR and northern blotting in cells and by in situ hybridization in tissues. MIEN1 and levels of other molecules upon miRNA regulation was determined by Western blotting, qPCR, and immunofluorescence. The functional effects of miRNA on cells were determined by wound healing cell migration, Boyden chamber cell invasion, clonal and colony formation assays. For knockdown or overexpression of the miRNA or overexpression of MIEN1 3'UTR, cells were transfected with the oligomiRs and plasmids, respectively.  Results:   A novel miRNA, hsa-miR-940 (miR-940), identified and validated to be highly expressed in immortalized normal cells compared to cancer cells, is a regulator of MIEN1. Analysis of human prostate tumors and their matched normal tissues confirmed that miR-940 is highly expressed in the normal tissues compared to its low to negligible expression in the tumors. While MIEN1 is a direct target of miR-940, miR-940 alters MIEN1 RNA, in a quantity as well as cell dependent context, along with altering its downstream effectors. The miR-940 inhibited migratory and invasive potential of cells, attenuated their anchorage-independent growth ability, and increased E-cadherin expression, implicating its role in mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET).  Conclusions:   These results, for the first time, implicate miR-940, a regulator of MIEN1, as a promising novel diagnostic and prognostic tool for prostate cancer.""","""['Smrithi Rajendiran', 'Anil V Parwani', 'Richard J Hare', 'Subhamoy Dasgupta', 'Rhonda K Roby', 'Jamboor K Vishwanatha']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['MicroRNA-26b suppresses the metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer by targeting MIEN1 via NF-κB/MMP-9/VEGF pathways.', 'Effects of miR-200c on the migration and invasion abilities of human prostate cancer Du145 cells and the corresponding mechanism.', 'MiR-301a regulates E-cadherin expression and is predictive of prostate cancer recurrence.', 'The microRNA-200 family: small molecules with novel roles in cancer development, progression and therapy.', 'Missing link between microRNA and prostate cancer.', 'Loss of miR-936 leads to acquisition of androgen-independent metastatic phenotype in prostate cancer.', 'Construction of a miRNA-Based Nomogram Model to Predict the Prognosis of Endometrial Cancer.', 'Emerging targets in cancer drug resistance.', 'Zinc finger Asp-His-His-Cys palmitoyl -acyltransferase 19 accelerates tumor progression through wnt/β-catenin pathway and is upregulated by miR-940 in osteosarcoma.', ""Characterization of the 3'UTR of the BTD gene and identification of regulatory elements and microRNAs.""]"""

HOOC-PEOz-PLA with a critical micelle concentration of 5.0 mg L(-1) was synthesized and characterized by (1)H NMR and gel permeation chromatography. The prepared YPSMA-1-modified micelles, about 30 nm in diameter, exhibited a rapid release behavior at endo/lysosome pH and a favorable ability of fast endo/lysosome escape as observed by confocal microscopy. More importantly, we evidenced for the first time that both endosome and lysosome escape existed for pH-sensitive micelles via real time tracing using confocal microscopy, and the real time endo/lysosome escape process was also presented. The YPSMA-1-modified micelles were very effective in enhancing the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel by increasing the cellular uptake in PSMA-positive 22Rv1 cells, which was verified the correlation with PSMA expression in tumor cells by flow cytometric analysis and confocal microscopy. Moreover, the active targeting and pH-sensitivity endowed YPSMA-1-modified micelles with a higher antitumor efficacy and negligible systemic toxicity in 22Rv1 xenograft-bearing nude mice compared with unmodified micelles and Taxol®.

This approach identified FBXO25 within a minimal common region of frequent deletion in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). FBXO25 encodes an orphan F-box protein that determines the substrate specificity of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box)(FBXO25) ubiquitin ligase complex. An unbiased screen uncovered the prosurvival protein HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) as the bona fide substrate of FBXO25 that is targeted after apoptotic stresses. Protein kinase Cδ (PRKCD) initiates this process by phosphorylating FBXO25 and HAX-1, thereby spatially directing nuclear FBXO25 to mitochondrial HAX-1. Our analyses in primary human MCL identify monoallelic loss of FBXO25 and stabilizing HAX1 phosphodegron mutations. Accordingly, FBXO25 re-expression in FBXO25-deleted MCL cells promotes cell death, whereas expression of the HAX-1 phosphodegron mutant inhibits apoptosis. In addition, knockdown of FBXO25 significantly accelerated lymphoma development in Eμ-Myc mice and in a human MCL xenotransplant model.

Despite the fact that a large number of its genes have been investigated, its etiology remains poorly understood. Furthermore, most PrCa candidate genes have not been rigorously replicated, and the methods by which they biologically function in PrCa remain largely unknown.  Results:   Aiming to identify key players in the complex prostate cancer system, we reconstructed PrCa co-expressed modules within functional gene sets defined by the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation (biological process, GO_BP). We primarily identified 118 GO_BP terms that were well-preserved between two independent gene expression datasets and a consequent 55 conserved co-expression modules within them. Five modules were then found to be significantly enriched with PrCa candidate genes collected from expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL), somatic copy number alteration (SCNA), somatic mutation data, or prognostic analyses. Specifically, two transcription factors (TFs) (NFAT and SP1) and three microRNAs (hsa-miR-19a, hsa-miR-15a, and hsa-miR-200b) regulating these five candidate modules were found to be critical to the development of PrCa.  Conclusions:   Collectively, our results indicated that genes with similar functions may play important roles in disease through co-expression, and modules with different functions could be regulated by similar genetic components, such as TFs and microRNAs, in a synergistic manner.""","""['Junfeng Jiang', 'Peilin Jia', 'Zhongming Zhao', 'Bairong Shen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Expression profile analysis reveals putative prostate cancer-related microRNAs.', 'Transcription factor and microRNA regulation in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells.', 'In-Silico Integration Approach to Identify a Key miRNA Regulating a Gene Network in Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Gene expression profiling and bioinformatics analysis of gastric carcinoma.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'Tousled-like kinase 1: a novel factor with multifaceted role in mCRPC progression and development of therapy resistance.', 'MicroRNA-15a promotes prostate cancer cell ferroptosis by inhibiting GPX4 expression.', 'TLK1-mediated MK5-S354 phosphorylation drives prostate cancer cell motility and may signify distinct pathologies.', 'Natural Product-Based Studies for the Management of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Computational to Clinical Studies.']"""

Results:   In multivariable analyzes, higher carbohydrate intake, measured as percent of energy from carbohydrates, was associated with reduced PC risk (3rd vs. 1st tertile, OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.21-0.81, P = 0.010), though this only reached significance in white men (p-trend = 0.029). GI was unrelated to PC risk among all men, but suggestively linked with reduced PC risk in white men (p-trend = 0.066) and increased PC risk in black men (p-trend = 0.172), however, the associations were not significant. Fiber intake was not associated with PC risk (all p-trends > 0.55). Higher carbohydrate intake was associated with reduced risk of high-grade (p-trend = 0.016), but not low-grade PC (p-trend = 0.593).

Scant data exist on the factors that increase the risk of ATE/VTE in patients with prostate cancer. The authors investigated the association of bevacizumab treatment and clinical factors with ATE/VTE risk in patients who were treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 90401.  Methods:   Patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were randomized to receive docetaxel and prednisone with or without bevacizumab once every 21 days. Cycle-to-event Cox regression models were used to investigate the association of bevacizumab with the incidence of grade 3 or greater (≥ 3) ATE and VTE. Age, prior ATE/VTE, baseline antiplatelet/anticoagulant use, and VTE risk score (based on leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, body mass index, and tumor location) were evaluated in univariate and multivariable analyses.  Results:   Of 1008 randomized patients, the odds of experiencing grade ≥ 3 ATE were significantly greater in those who received bevacizumab compared with those who received placebo (odds ratio, 2.79; P = .02), whereas an opposite trend was noted for grade ≥ 3 VTE (odds ratio, 0.60; P = .08). In the multivariable analysis, bevacizumab treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 3.00; P = .01) and age (HR, 1.06; P = .02) were significantly associated with the risk of ATE; whereas age (HR, 1.05; P = .01) and VTE risk score (HR, 1.83; P = .03) were significantly associated with the risk of VTE.  Conclusions:   Bevacizumab was significantly associated with a greater risk of ATE in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, but it was not significantly associated with the risk of VTE.

We describe pathological characteristics of low risk PC at radical prostatectomy in contemporary patients.  Methods:   Five-hundred-fifty-two men from 2008 to 2012 with low risk (stage T1c/T2a, PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, Gleason score ≤6) PC underwent radical prostatectomy. Slides were re-reviewed to grade and stage the tumor, map separate tumor nodules, and calculate their volumes.  Results:   Ninety-three (16.9%) men had prostatectomy Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 or higher and were excluded. Five (0.9%) men had no residual carcinoma. Remaining 454 patients composed the study cohort. The median age was 57 years (36-73) and median PSA 4.4 ng/ml (0.4-9.9). Racial distribution was 77.5% Caucasian, 15.5% African American, and 7% other. The median total tumor volume was 0.38 cm(3) (0.003-7.22). Seventy percent of the patients had bilateral tumor and 34% had a tumor nodule >0.5 cm(3) . The index lesion represented 89% (median) of the total tumor volume. Extraprostatic extension and positive margin were present in 5.7% and 9% of cases, respectively. The tumor nodules measuring >0.5 cm(3) were located almost equally between the anterior (53%) and peripheral (47%) gland. The relationship between PSA and total tumor volume was weak (r = 0.13, P = 0.005). The relationship between PSA density and total tumor volume was slightly better (r = 0.26, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Low risk prostate cancer is generally a low volume disease. Gleason score upgrade is seen in 16.9% of cases at radical prostatectomy. While the index lesion accounts for the bulk of the disease, the cancer is usually multifocal and bilateral. Neither PSA nor PSA density correlates well with the total tumor volume. Prostate size has a significant contribution to PSA level.

Design/methodology/approach:   To obtain an accurate provincial representation, six cancer centres were chosen (based on their IMRT utilization, geography, population, academic affiliation and size) for an in-depth evaluation. At each cancer centre semi-structured, key informant interviews were conducted with senior administrators. An electronic survey, consisting of 40 questions, was also developed and distributed to all cancer centres in Ontario.  Findings:   In total, 21 respondents participated in the interviews and a total of 266 electronic surveys were returned. Funding allocation, guidelines and utilization targets, expert coaching and educational activities were identified as effective implementation strategies. The implementation allowed for hands-on training, an exchange of knowledge and expertise and the sharing of responsibility. Future implementation initiatives could be improved by creating stronger avenues for clear, continuing and comprehensive communication at all stages to increase awareness, garner support and encourage participation and encouraging expert-based coaching. IMRT utilization for has increased without affecting wait times or safety (from fiscal year 2008/2009 to 2012/2013 absolute increased change: prostate 46, thyroid 36, head and neck 29, sarcoma 30, and CNS 32 per cent).  Originality/value:   This multifaceted, jurisdiction-wide approach has been successful in implementing guideline recommended IMRT into standard practice. The expert based coaching initiative, in particular presents a novel training approach for those who are implementing complex techniques.

Further, prognosis may also influence health-care utilization. This paper describes health service utilization patterns of subgroups of prostate cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with different relative probabilities of dying of their cancer or other conditions.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort of cancer patients from Kaiser Permanente Colorado were divided into three groups using the predicted probabilities of dying of cancer and other causes calculated by the nomograms in the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Cancer Survival Calculator. Demographic, disease-related characteristics, and health service utilization patterns were described across subgroups.  Results:   The cohort consisted of 2092 patients (1102 prostate cancer and 990 CRC). A new diagnosis of cancer increased utilization of cancer-related services with rates as high as 9.1/1000 person-days for prostate cancer and 36.2/1000 person-days for CRC. Little change was observed in the number of primary and other specialty care visits from prediagnosis to 1 and 2 years postdiagnosis.  Conclusions:   We found that although a new diagnosis of cancer increased utilization of cancer-related services for an extended time period, the timing of cancer diagnosis did not appear to affect other types of utilization. Future research should assess the reason for the lack of impact of cancer and unrelated comorbid conditions on utilization and whether desired outcomes of care were achieved.""","""['Borsika A Rabin', 'Jennifer L Ellis', 'John F Steiner', 'Larissa Nekhlyudov', 'Eric J Feuer', 'Benjamin F Hankey', 'Laurie Cynkin', 'Elizabeth Bayliss']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr""","""['The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Survival Calculator SEER*CSC: validation in a managed care setting.', 'The Cancer Survival Query System: making survival estimates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program more timely and relevant for recently diagnosed patients.', 'Providing clinicians and patients with actual prognosis: cancer in the context of competing causes of death.', 'Survival benefit of radical prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate cancer: estimations of the number needed to treat according to tumor and patient characteristics.', 'Patient survival and healthcare utilization costs after diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer in a United States managed care cancer registry.', 'Early stage breast cancer follow-up in real-world clinical practice: the added value of cell free circulating tumor DNA.', 'Cause-specific mortality among Medicare beneficiaries with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes.', 'The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Survival Calculator SEER*CSC: validation in a managed care setting.', 'Cancer survival: an overview of measures, uses, and interpretation.']"""

They are based on the National Cancer Institute's SEER data, coupled with Medicare data, to estimate the probabilities of surviving or dying from cancer or from other causes based on a set of patient and tumor characteristics. The nomograms provide estimates of survival that are specific to the characteristics of the tumor, age, race, gender, and the overall health of a patient. These nomograms have been internally validated using the SEER data. In this paper, we externally validate the nomograms using data from Kaiser Permanente Colorado.  Methods:   The SEER Cancer Survival Calculator was externally validated using time-dependent area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve statistics and calibration plots for retrospective cohorts of 1102 prostate cancer and 990 colorectal cancer patients from Kaiser Permanente Colorado.  Results:   The time-dependent area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve statistics were computed for one, three, five, seven, and 10 year(s) postdiagnosis for prostate and colorectal cancer and ranged from 0.77 to 0.89 for death from cancer and from 0.72 to 0.81 for death from other causes. The calibration plots indicated a very good fit of the model for death from cancer for colorectal cancer and for the higher risk group for prostate cancer. For the lower risk groups for prostate cancer (<10% chance of dying of prostate cancer in 10 years), the model predicted slightly worse prognosis than observed. Except for the lowest risk group for colorectal cancer, the models for death from other causes for both prostate and colorectal cancer predicted slightly worse prognosis than observed.  Conclusions:   The results of the external validation indicated that the colorectal and prostate cancer nomograms are reliable tools for physicians and patients to use to obtain information on prognosis and assist in establishing priorities for both treatment of the cancer and other conditions, particularly when a patient is elderly and/or has significant comorbidities. The slightly better than predicted risk of death from other causes in a health maintenance organization (HMO) setting may be due to an overall healthier population and the integrated management of disease relative to the overall population (as represented by SEER).""","""['Eric J Feuer', 'Borsika A Rabin', 'Zhaohui Zou', 'Zhuoqiao Wang', 'Xiaoqin Xiong', 'Jennifer L Ellis', 'John F Steiner', 'Laurie Cynkin', 'Larissa Nekhlyudov', 'Elizabeth Bayliss', 'Benjamin F Hankey']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr""","""['Health-care utilization by prognosis profile in a managed care setting: using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Cancer Survival Calculator SEER*CSC.', 'The Cancer Survival Query System: making survival estimates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program more timely and relevant for recently diagnosed patients.', 'Nomograms to predict survival after colorectal cancer resection without preoperative therapy.', 'Nomograms are key decision-making tools in prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and SEER-Medicare Databases: Use in Clinical Research for Improving Colorectal Cancer Outcomes.', 'Estimating life expectancy adjusted by self-rated health status in the United States: national health interview survey linked to the mortality.', 'Models predicting survival to guide treatment decision-making in newly diagnosed primary non-metastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Cause-specific mortality among Medicare beneficiaries with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes.', 'Development, Feasibility, and Small-Scale Implementation of a Web-Based Prognostic Tool-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Survival Calculator.', 'Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2014, Featuring Survival.']"""

But clinicians and cancer patients generally want to understand actual prognosis (crude measures): the chance of surviving, dying from the specific cancer and from competing causes of death in a given time period.  Objective:   To compare cancer and actual prognosis in the United States for four leading cancers-lung, breast, prostate, and colon-by age, comorbidity, and cancer stage and to provide templates to help patients, clinicians, and researchers understand actual prognosis.  Method:   Using population-based registry data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we calculated cancer prognosis (relative survival) and actual prognosis (five-year overall survival and the ""crude"" probability of dying from cancer and competing causes) for three important prognostic determinants (age, comorbidity [Charlson-score from 2012 SEER-Medicare linkage dataset] and cancer stage at diagnosis).  Result:   For younger, healthier, and earlier stage cancer patients, cancer and actual prognosis estimates were quite similar. For older and sicker patients, these prognosis estimates differed substantially. For example, the five-year overall survival for an 85-year-old patient with colorectal cancer is 54% (cancer prognosis) versus 22% (actual prognosis)-the difference reflecting the patient's substantial chance of dying from competing causes. The corresponding five-year chances of dying from the patient's cancer are 46% versus 37%. Although age and comorbidity lowered actual prognosis, stage at diagnosis was the most powerful factor: The five-year chance of colon cancer death was 10% for localized stage and 83% for distant stage.  Conclusion:   Both cancer and actual prognosis measures are important. Cancer registries should routinely report both cancer and actual prognosis to help clinicians and researchers understand the difference between these measures and what question they can and cannot answer.

Disparities often are discussed in terms of either race and ethnicity or socioeconomic status (SES), without examining interactions between these variables.  Methods:   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-18 data, excluding Alaska Native and Louisiana registries, from 2002 to 2008, were used to estimate five-year, cause-specific survival by race/ethnicity and census tract SES. Differences in survival between groups were used to assess absolute disparities. Hazard ratios were examined as a measure of relative disparity. Interactions between race/ethnicity and neighborhood SES were evaluated using proportional hazard models.  Results:   Survival increased with higher SES for all racial/ethnic groups and generally was higher among non-Hispanic white and Asian/Pacific Islander (API) than non-Hispanic black and Hispanic cases. Absolute disparity in breast cancer survival among non-Hispanic black vs non-Hispanic white cases was slightly larger in low-SES areas than in high-SES areas (7.1% and 6.8%, respectively). In contrast, after adjusting for stage, age, and treatment, risk of mortality among non-Hispanic black cases compared with non-Hispanic white cases was 21% higher in low-SES areas and 64% higher in high-SES areas. Similarly, patterns of absolute and relative disparity compared with non-Hispanic whites differed by SES for Hispanic breast cancer, non-Hispanic black colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer cases. Statistically significant interactions existed between race/ethnicity and SES for colorectal and female breast cancers.

Five-year relative survival was calculated using US-based life tables (USLT) and state-specific life tables (SLT).  Results:   Differences in SLT- and USLT-based survival were generally small (SLT < 4 survival percentage points lower than USLT). Differences were higher for states with high SES and low mortality and for prostate cancer. Differences were largest for all cancers combined, colon and rectum, and prostate cancer among males aged 85+ ranging from -10 to -17 survival points for whites and +9 to +17 for blacks.  Conclusion:   Differences between relative survival based on USLT and SLT were small and state-based estimates were less reliable than US-based estimates for older populations aged 85+. Our findings underscore the need to develop more appropriate life tables that better represent the varying mortality patterns in different populations in order to obtain accurate estimates of relative survival.""","""['Antoinette M Stroup', 'Hyunsoon Cho', 'Steve M Scoppa', 'Hannah K Weir', 'Angela B Mariotto']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr""","""['Adjusting relative survival estimates for cancer mortality in the general population.', 'Cancer survival in five continents: a worldwide population-based study (CONCORD).', 'Expected years of life lost for six potentially preventable cancers in the United States.', 'Regression models for crude and relative survival: a comparative review.', 'A Statistical Memoir on the Influence of Various Professions on the Health and Mortality of Mechanics and Artisans in the Prime of Life; Founded on the Tables of the Institution for Sick Mechanics in Würtzburg from 1786 to 1834.', 'Is the Social Gradient in Net Survival Observed in France the Result of Inequalities in Cancer-Specific Mortality or Inequalities in General Mortality?', 'Net survival for colorectal cancer in Cuiabá and Várzea Grande (state of Mato Grosso), Brazil.', 'Hemodialysis vs Peritoneal Dialysis: Comparison of Net Survival in Incident Patients on Chronic Dialysis in Colombia.', 'A competing risk analysis of death patterns in male genitourinary cancer.', 'Correcting for misclassification and selection effects in estimating net survival in clinical trials.']"""

In some cancers, such as breast and ovarian, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur more frequently in transcribed regions, while in other cancer types such as prostate, there is a consistent depletion of breakpoints in transcribed regions. Despite such regularity, little is understood about the mechanisms driving these effects. A few works have suggested that protein binding may be relevant, e.g. in studies of androgen receptor binding and active chromatin in specific cell types. We hypothesized that this behavior might be general, i.e. that correlation between protein-DNA binding (and open chromatin) and breakpoint locations is common across divergent cancers.  Results:   We investigated this hypothesis by comprehensively analyzing the relationship among 457 ENCODE protein binding ChIP-seq experiments, 125 DnaseI and 24 FAIRE experiments, and 14,600 SMs from 8 diverse cancer datasets covering 147 samples. In most cancers, including breast and ovarian, we found enrichment of protein binding and open chromatin in the vicinity of SM breakpoints at distances up to 200 kb. Furthermore, for all cancer types we observed an enhanced enrichment in regions distant from genes when compared to regions proximal to genes, suggesting that the SM-induction mechanism is independent from the bias of DSBs to occur near transcribed regions. We also observed a stronger effect for sites with more than one protein bound.  Conclusions:   Protein binding and open chromatin state are associated with nearby SM breakpoints in many cancer datasets. These observations suggest a consistent mechanism underlying SM locations across different cancers.""","""['Krzysztof R Grzeda', 'Beryl Royer-Bertrand', 'Koichiro Inaki', 'Hyunsoo Kim', 'Axel M Hillmer', 'Edison T Liu', 'Jeffrey H Chuang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Chromatin structural elements and chromosomal translocations in leukemia.', 'Chromatin binding by the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Altered chromatin modifications in AML1/RUNX1 breakpoint regions involved in (8;21) translocation.', 'DNA-Binding Factor Target Identification by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in Plants.', 'Chromatin structure in double strand break repair.', 'Detection and genomic analysis of BRAF fusions in Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma through the combination and integration of multi-omic data.', 'Chromosome structural variation in tumorigenesis: mechanisms of formation and carcinogenesis.', 'Explaining cancer type specific mutations with transcriptomic and epigenomic features in normal tissues.', 'The Tandem Duplicator Phenotype Is a Prevalent Genome-Wide Cancer Configuration Driven by Distinct Gene Mutations.', 'The tandem duplicator phenotype as a distinct genomic configuration in cancer.']"""

The alterations were modeled based on Darwin's evolutionary selection theory and the genes overlapping these altered genomic regions were used to develop a metastatic potential score for a prostate cancer primary tumor. The function of the proteins encoded by some of the predictor genes promote escape from anoikis, a pathway of apoptosis, deregulated in metastases.

Cutaneous reactions, one of the most frequently observed adverse effects associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, can significantly affect patients' quality of life and drug adherence and represent a major therapeutic challenge to maximizing the efficacy of targeted cancer therapy.  Objective:   To describe the frequency and spectrum of skin reactions in patients with urothelial carcinoma receiving cabozantinib as monotherapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A single-institution study at the Clinical Research Center at the National Institutes of Health included 41 consecutive adults with metastatic, progressive urothelial carcinoma enrolled in a National Cancer Institute open-label, nonrandomized, phase 2 clinical trial. Patients receiving cabozantinib were evaluated for the development of skin reactions at each treatment visit from October 2012 to June 2014 by the primary oncology team and referred for dermatologic evaluation as appropriate.  Main outcomes and measures:   A detailed history, full-body physical examination, and clinical photographs of cutaneous lesions were obtained.  Results:   Of 41 consecutive patients who received cabozantinib, 30 (73%) developed 1 or more cutaneous toxic effects. Adverse events included hand-foot skin reaction (22 [54%]), generalized pigment dilution and/or hair depigmentation (18 [44%]), xerosis (8 [20%]), scrotal erythema/ulceration (6 [15%]), and nail splinter hemorrhages (5 [12%]).

Off-target toxicity can often be reduced simply by directing the drugs specifically to sites of diseases. Amidst increasingly sophisticated methods of targeted drug delivery, we observed that Nature has already evolved elegant means of sending biological molecules to where they are needed. One such example is corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), the major carrier of the anti-inflammatory hormone, cortisol. Targeted release of cortisol is triggered by cleavage of CBG's reactive centre loop by elastase, a protease released by neutrophils in inflamed tissues. This work aimed to establish the feasibility of exploiting this mechanism to carry therapeutic agents to defined locations. The reactive centre loop of CBG was altered with site-directed mutagenesis to favour cleavage by other proteases, to alter the sites at which it would release its cargo. Mutagenesis succeeded in making CBG a substrate for either prostate specific antigen (PSA), a prostate-specific serine protease, or thrombin, a key protease in the blood coagulation cascade. PSA is conspicuously overproduced in prostatic hyperplasia and is, therefore, a good way of targeting hyperplastic prostate tissues. Thrombin is released during clotting and consequently is ideal for conferring specificity to thrombotic sites. Using fluorescence-based titration assays, we also showed that CBG can be engineered to bind a new compound, thyroxine-6-carboxyfluorescein, instead of its physiological ligand, cortisol, thereby demonstrating that it is possible to tailor the hormone binding site to deliver a therapeutic drug. In addition, we proved that the efficiency with which CBG releases bound ligand can be increased by introducing some well-placed mutations. This proof-of-concept study has raised the prospect of a novel means of targeted drug delivery, using the serpin conformational change to combat the problem of off-target effects in the treatment of diseases.""","""['Wee Lee Chan', 'Aiwu Zhou', 'Randy J Read']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Monoclonal antibodies to the reactive centre loop (RCL) of human corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) can protect against proteolytic cleavage.', 'The reactive centre loop of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) is a protease target for cortisol release.', 'Effect of mutations of the human serpin protein corticosteroid-binding globulin on cortisol-binding, thermal and protease sensitivity.', 'Molecular and structural basis of steroid hormone binding and release from corticosteroid-binding globulin.', 'Cortisol and CBG - Getting cortisol to the right place at the right time.', 'Serpins in Tick Physiology and Tick-Host Interaction.', 'Pyrexia and acidosis act independently of neutrophil elastase reactive center loop cleavage to effect cortisol release from corticosteroid-binding globulin.', 'Opposite Expression of Hepatic and Pulmonary Corticosteroid-Binding Globulin in Cystic Fibrosis Patients.', 'Design of an allosterically modulated doxycycline and doxorubicin drug-binding protein.', ""SCRAMBLE'N'GAMBLE: a tool for fast and facile generation of random data for statistical evaluation of QSAR models.""]"""

Materials and methods:   The VERDICT framework is a noninvasive microstructure imaging technique that combines an in-depth diffusion MRI acquisition with a mathematical model to estimate and map microstructural tissue parameters such as cell size and density and vascular perfusion. In total, 8 patients underwent 3-T MRI using 9 different b values (100-3000 s/mm). All patients were imaged before undergoing biopsy. Experiments with VERDICT analyzed DW-MRI data from patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer in areas of cancerous and benign peripheral zone tissue. For comparison, we also fitted commonly used diffusion models such as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and the kurtosis model. We also investigated correlations of ADC and kurtosis with VERDICT parameters to gain some biophysical insight into the various parameter values.  Results:   Eight patients had prostate cancer in the peripheral zone, with Gleason score 3 + 3 (n = 1), 3 + 4 (n = 6), and 4 + 3 (n = 1). The VERDICT model identified a significant increase in the intracellular and vascular volume fraction estimates in cancerous compared with benign peripheral zone, as well as a significant decrease in the volume of the extracellular-extravascular space (EES) (P = 0.05). This is in agreement with manual segmentation of the biopsies for prostate tissue component analysis, which found proliferation of epithelium, loss of surrounding stroma, and an increase in vasculature. The standard ADC and kurtosis parameters were also significantly different (P = 0.05) between tissue types. There was no significant difference in any of the IVIM parameters (P = 0.11 to 0.29). The VERDICT parametric maps from voxel-by-voxel fitting clearly differentiated cancer from benign regions. Kurtosis and ADC parameters correlated most strongly with VERDICT's intracellular volume fraction but also moderately with the EES and vascular fractions.  Conclusions:   The VERDICT model distinguished tumor from benign areas, while revealing differences in microstructure descriptors such as cellular, vascular, and EES fractions. The parameters of ADC and kurtosis models also discriminated between cancer and benign regions. However, VERDICT provides more specific information that disentangles the various microstructural features underlying the changes in ADC and kurtosis. These results highlight the clinical potential of the VERDICT framework and motivate the construction of a shorter, clinically viable imaging protocol to enable larger trials leading to widespread translation of the method.""","""['Eleftheria Panagiotaki', 'Rachel W Chan', 'Nikolaos Dikaios', 'Hashim U Ahmed', ""James O'Callaghan"", 'Alex Freeman', 'David Atkinson', 'Shonit Punwani', 'David J Hawkes', 'Daniel C Alexander']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'VERDICT MRI for Prostate Cancer: Intracellular Volume Fraction versus Apparent Diffusion Coefficient.', 'Non-Gaussian water diffusion kurtosis imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: Physical Foundations, Limitations, and Prospective Advances of\xa0Diffusion-Weighted MRI.', 'Body diffusion kurtosis imaging: Basic principles, applications, and considerations for clinical practice.', 'Improving reader accuracy and specificity with the addition of hybrid multidimensional-MRI to multiparametric-MRI in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancers.', 'Comprehensive Brain Tumour Characterisation with VERDICT-MRI: Evaluation of Cellular and Vascular Measures Validated by Histology.', 'Joint estimation of relaxation and diffusion tissue parameters for prostate cancer with relaxation-VERDICT MRI.', 'Diffusion time dependency of extracellular diffusion.', 'A Multicompartmental Diffusion Model for Improved Assessment of Whole-Body Diffusion-weighted Imaging Data and Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.']"""

Higher glycolysis was associated with increased rates of cytoskeletal remodeling, greater cell traction forces and faster cell migration, all of which were blocked by inhibition of glycolysis, but not by inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Thus, our results demonstrate that cancer cell motility and cytoskeleton rearrangement is energetically dependent on aerobic glycolysis and not oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial derived ATP is insufficient to compensate for inhibition of the glycolytic pathway with regard to cellular motility and CSK rearrangement, implying that localization of ATP derived from glycolytic enzymes near sites of active CSK rearrangement is more important for cell motility than total cellular ATP production rate. These results extend our understanding of cancer cell metabolism, potentially providing a target metabolic pathway associated with aggressive disease.""","""['Takumi Shiraishi', 'James E Verdone', 'Jessie Huang', 'Ulf D Kahlert', 'James R Hernandez', 'Gonzalo Torga', 'Jelani C Zarif', 'Tamir Epstein', 'Robert Gatenby', 'Annemarie McCartney', 'Jennifer H Elisseeff', 'Steven M Mooney', 'Steven S An', 'Kenneth J Pienta']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Tumor microenvironment and metabolic synergy in breast cancers: critical importance of mitochondrial fuels and function.', 'Tumor necrosis factor alpha increases aerobic glycolysis and reduces oxidative metabolism in prostate epithelial cells.', 'Quantifying intracellular rates of glycolytic and oxidative ATP production and consumption using extracellular flux measurements.', 'Attenuation of LDHA expression in cancer cells leads to redox-dependent alterations in cytoskeletal structure and cell migration.', 'Metformin and prostate cancer stem cells: a novel therapeutic target.', 'Mitochondrial transfer from cancer-associated fibroblasts increases migration in aggressive breast cancer.', 'Proteomics-Based Identification of Dysregulated Proteins and Biomarker Discovery in Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, the Most Common Breast Cancer Subtype.', 'Myosin II regulatory light chain phosphorylation and formin availability modulate cytokinesis upon changes in carbohydrate metabolism.', 'Transcriptional reprogramming from innate immune functions to a pro-thrombotic signature by monocytes in COVID-19.', 'Discovery of New Glucose Uptake Inhibitors as Potential Anticancer Agents by Non-Radioactive Cell-Based Assays.']"""

Accurate identification of tissue of origin would allow for directed, personalized therapies to improve clinical outcomes. Our objective was to use transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify lineage-specific biomarker signatures for the cancer types that most commonly metastasize as CUP (colorectum, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, pancreas, prostate, and stomach). RNA-Seq data of 17,471 transcripts from a total of 3,244 cancer samples across 26 different tissue types were compiled from in-house sequencing data and publically available International Cancer Genome Consortium and The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Robust cancer biomarker signatures were extracted using a 10-fold cross-validation method of log transformation, quantile normalization, transcript ranking by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and stepwise logistic regression. The entire algorithm was then repeated with a new set of randomly generated training and test sets, yielding highly concordant biomarker signatures. External validation of the cancer-specific signatures yielded high sensitivity (92.0% ± 3.15%; mean ± standard deviation) and specificity (97.7% ± 2.99%) for each cancer biomarker signature. The overall performance of this RNA-Seq biomarker-generating algorithm yielded an accuracy of 90.5%. In conclusion, we demonstrate a computational model for producing highly sensitive and specific cancer biomarker signatures from RNA-Seq data, generating signatures for the top eight cancer types responsible for CUP to accurately identify tumor origin.""","""['Iris H Wei', 'Yang Shi', 'Hui Jiang', 'Chandan Kumar-Sinha', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['TOD-CUP: a gene expression rank-based majority vote algorithm for tissue origin diagnosis of cancers of unknown primary.', 'CUP-AI-Dx: A tool for inferring cancer tissue of origin and molecular subtype using RNA gene-expression data and artificial intelligence.', 'Large-scale RNA-Seq Transcriptome Analysis of 4043 Cancers and 548 Normal Tissue Controls across 12 TCGA Cancer Types.', 'Molecular signatures in breast cancer.', 'A Review on Cancer of Unknown Primary Origin: The Role of Molecular Biomarkers in the Identification of Unknown Primary Origin.', 'A critical review of datasets and computational suites for improving cancer theranostics and biomarker discovery.', 'aTAP: automated transcriptome analysis platform for processing RNA-seq data by de novo assembly.', 'Simulating the restoration of normal gene expression from different thyroid cancer stages using deep learning.', 'Identifying common transcriptome signatures of cancer by interpreting deep learning models.', 'CDK1, CCNB1 and NDC80 are associated with prognosis and progression of hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma: a bioinformatic analysis.']"""

Its function in tumorigenesis appears contradictory though, showing both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities. In this study, we examined whether and how Klf5 functions in prostatic tumorigenesis using mice with prostate-specific deletion of Klf5 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), both of which are frequently inactivated in human prostate cancer. Histologic analysis demonstrated that when one Pten allele was deleted, which causes mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN), Klf5 deletion accelerated the emergence and progression of mPIN. When both Pten alleles were deleted, which causes prostate cancer, Klf5 deletion promoted tumor growth, increased cell proliferation, and caused more severe morphologic and molecular alterations. Homozygous deletion of Klf5 was more effective than hemizygous deletion. Unexpectedly, while Pten deletion alone expanded basal cell population in a tumor as reported, Klf5 deletion in the Pten-null background clearly reduced basal cell population while expanding luminal cell population. Global gene expression profiling, pathway analysis, and experimental validation indicate that multiple mechanisms could mediate the tumor-promoting effect of Klf5 deletion, including the up-regulation of epidermal growth factor and its downstream signaling molecules AKT and ERK and the inactivation of the p15 cell cycle inhibitor. KLF5 also appears to cooperate with several transcription factors, including CREB1, Sp1, Myc, ER and AR, to regulate gene expression. These findings validate the tumor suppressor function of KLF5. They also yield a mouse model that shares two common genetic alterations with human prostate cancer-mutation/deletion of Pten and deletion of Klf5.""","""['Changsheng Xing', 'Xinpei Ci', 'Xiaodong Sun', 'Xiaoying Fu', 'Zhiqian Zhang', 'Eric N Dong', 'Zhao-Zhe Hao', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Additive Effect of Zfhx3/Atbf1 and Pten Deletion on Mouse Prostatic Tumorigenesis.', 'KLF5 inhibits angiogenesis in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer by attenuating AKT activation and subsequent HIF1α accumulation.', 'Conditional deletion of the Pten gene in the mouse prostate induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasms at early ages but a slow progression to prostate tumors.', 'AKT and cytosolic phospholipase A2α form a positive loop in prostate cancer cells.', 'Evasion of anti-growth signaling: A key step in tumorigenesis and potential target for treatment and prophylaxis by natural compounds.', 'Participation of Krüppel-like Factors in Atherogenesis.', 'Opposing transcriptional programs of KLF5 and AR emerge during therapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'miR-9 modulates and predicts the response to radiotherapy and EGFR inhibition in HNSCC.', 'KLF5 Is Activated by Gene Amplification in Gastric Cancer and Is Essential for Gastric Cell Proliferation.', 'The roles and regulation of the KLF5 transcription factor in cancers.']"""

Recently, prostatic artery embolization (PAE) was described as a novel effective and less invasive treatment alternative. Despite promising first results, PAE still has to be considered experimental due to a lack of good quality studies. Prospective randomized controlled trials comparing PAE with TUR-P are highly warranted.  Methods/design:   This is a single-centre, prospective, randomized, non-inferiority trial comparing treatment effects and adverse events of PAE and TURP in a tertiary referral centre. One hundred patients who are electable for both treatment options are randomized to either PAE or TURP. Changes of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) after 3 months are defined as primary endpoint. Changes in bladder diaries, laboratory analyses, urodynamic investigations and standardised questionnaires are assessed as secondary outcome measures. In addition contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis before and after the interventions will provide crucial information regarding morphological changes and vascularisation of the prostate.

Radionuclide molecular imaging of IGF-1R expression in tumors may help in selecting the patients that will potentially respond to IGF-1R-targeted therapy. Affibody molecules are small (7 kDa) non-immunoglobulin-based scaffold proteins that are well-suited probes for radionuclide imaging. The aim of this study was the evaluation of an anti-IGF-1R affibody molecule labeled with technetium-99m using cysteine-containing peptide-based chelator GGGC at C-terminus. ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC was efficiently and stably labeled with technetium-99m (radiochemical yield 97 ± 3%). (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC demonstrated specific binding to IGF-1R-expressing DU-145 (prostate cancer) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines and slow internalization in vitro. The tumor-targeting properties were studied in BALB/c nu/nu mice bearing DU-145 and MCF-7 xenografts. [(99m)Tc(CO)3](+)-(HE)3-ZIGF1R:4551 was used for comparison. The biodistribution study demonstrated high tumor-to-blood ratios (6.2 ± 0.9 and 6.9 ± 1.0, for DU-145 and MCF-7, respectively, at 4 h after injection). Renal radioactivity concentration was 16-fold lower for (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC than for [(99m)Tc(CO)3](+)-(HE)3-ZIGF1R:4551 at 4 h after injection. However, the liver uptake of (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC was 1.2- to 2-fold higher in comparison with [(99m)Tc(CO)3](+)-(HE)3-ZIGF1R:4551. A possible reason for the elevated hepatic uptake of (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC is a high lipophilicity of amino acids in the binding site of ZIGF1R:4551, which is not compensated in (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC. In conclusion, (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC can visualize the IGF-1R expression in human tumor xenografts and provides low retention of radioactivity in kidneys.

To personalize CRPC therapy in an individual with clinical progression despite maximal AR signaling blockade, it is important to characterize the status of AR activity within their cancer. Biopsies of bone metastases are invasive and frequently fail to yield sufficient tissue for further study. Evaluation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) offers an alternative, minimally invasive mechanism to characterize and study late-stage disease. The goal of this study was to evaluate the utility of CTC interrogation with respect to the AR as a potential novel therapeutic biomarker in patients with mCRPC.  Methods:   Fifteen mL of whole blood was collected from patients with progressive, metastatic mCRPC, the mononuclear cell portion was isolated, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to isolate and evaluate CTCs. A novel protocol was optimized to use ImageStreamX to quantitatively analyze AR expression and subcellular localization within CTCs. Co-expression of AR and the proliferation marker Ki67 was also determined using ImageStreamX.  Results:   We found inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity in expression and localization of AR. Increased AR expression and nuclear localization are associated with elevated co-expression of Ki-67, consistent with the continued role for AR in castration-resistant disease. Despite intra-patient heterogeneity, CTCs from patients with prior exposure to abiraterone had increased AR expression compared to CTCs from patients who were abiraterone-naïve.  Conclusions:   As our toolbox for targeting AR function expands, our ability to evaluate AR expression and function within tumor samples from patients with late-stage disease will likely be a critical component of the personalized management of advanced prostate cancer. AR expression and nuclear localization varies within patients and between patients; however it remains associated with markers of proliferation. This supports a molecularly diverse AR-centric pathobiology imparting castration-resistance.""","""['Edwin E Reyes', 'David J VanderWeele', 'Masis Isikbay', 'Ryan Duggan', 'Alexa Campanile', 'Walter M Stadler', 'Donald J Vander Griend', 'Russell Z Szmulewitz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Androgen receptor nuclear localization correlates with AR-V7 mRNA expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from metastatic castration resistance prostate cancer patients.', 'Nuclear-specific AR-V7 Protein Localization is Necessary to Guide Treatment Selection in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Associations between AR-V7 status in circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour cell count and survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AR-v7 liquid biopsy for treatment stratification in prostate cancer: how close are we?', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'MYB interacts with androgen receptor, sustains its ligand-independent activation and promotes castration resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Status of PSMA-Targeted Alpha Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Circulating tumor cell profiling for precision oncology.', 'Tracking the expression of therapeutic protein targets in rare cells by antibody-mediated nanoparticle labelling and magnetic sorting.', 'The Prospect of Identifying Resistance Mechanisms for Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Using Circulating Tumor Cells: Is Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition a Key Player?']"""

We examined our experience in men with IBD who were treated with definitive RT for prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   We queried our institutional database for patients with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, or IBD not otherwise specified. Endpoints were: acute and late ≥grade 2 (G2) GI toxicity and IBD flare after RT. Outcomes were compared with controls using propensity scoring matched 3 to 1. We matched controls to the IBD cohort according to: RT technique, RT dose, risk group, hormone use, treatment year, and age. We determined predictors of acute outcomes using the Fisher exact test and time to outcomes using the log-rank test.  Results:   Between 1990 and 2010, 84 men were included. Sixty-three men served as matched controls and 21 with IBD: 13 ulcerative colitis, 7 Crohn disease, and 1 IBD not otherwise specified. For men with IBD, median age was 69 years, and median follow-up was 49 months. Median flare-free interval before RT was 10 years. Seven were taking IBD medications during RT. There was no difference in acute or late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in the IBD group versus controls. Among IBD patients, IBD medication use was the only predictor of acute ≥G2 GI toxicity: 57.1% with medication versus7.7% without (49.4% absolute difference, 95% confidence interval [CI] 10.0%-88.9%, P = .03). The 5-year risk of late GI toxicity in men with IBD versus controls was not statistically significant (hazard ratio = 1.19, 95%CI 0.28-5.01, P = .83). The crude incidence of late ≥G2 GI toxicity was 10%.  Conclusions:   Acute GI toxicity appears to be exacerbated in patients on concomitant medical therapy for IBD. Overall, late GI toxicity was relatively low and not significantly different between patients with IBD versus no IBD. However, the small sample size limits the interpretation of our estimates and the wide confidence intervals indicate these patients warrant careful selection.""","""['Colin T Murphy', 'Steve Heller', 'Karen Ruth', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'David Weinberg', 'Robert G Uzzo', 'Elizabeth Plimack', 'Alexander Kutikov', 'David Y T Chen', 'Eric M Horwitz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Stereotactic body radiation therapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in men with underlying inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Low Toxicity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Treated With Abdominal and Pelvic Radiation Therapy.', 'Short-term Toxicity of High Dose Rate Brachytherapy in Prostate Cancer Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.', 'Tolerability of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors used for the treatment of rheumatological manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Safety of Radiation Therapy in Patients With Prostate Cancer and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.', 'Inflammatory bowel disease-associated malignancies and considerations for radiation impacting bowel: a scoping review.', 'Toxicity After Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Multi-institutional Matched Case-Control Series.', 'Impact of inflammatory bowel disease on radical prostatectomy outcomes and costs of care.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in men with underlying inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy: An Overview of Toxicity and Dose Response.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively re-contoured and re-planned treatment plans for 10 consecutive prostate cancer patients. Plans were created for a Siemens Artiste linear accelerator with flat 6 MV and FFF 7 MV photons, using the Prowess Panther treatment planning system. mARC and IMRT plans were compared with each other considering indices for plan quality and dose to organs at risk. All plans were exported to the machine and irradiated while measuring scattered dose by thermoluminescent dosimeters placed on an anthropomorphic phantom. Treatment times were also measured and compared.  Results:   All plans were found acceptable for treatment. There was no marked preference for either technique or energy from the point of view of target coverage and dose to organs at risk. Scattered dose was significantly decreased by the use of FFF energies. While mARC and IMRT plans were of very similar overall quality, treatment time could be markedly decreased both by the use of mARC and FFF energy.  Conclusions:   Highly conformal treatment plans could be created both by the use of flat 6 MV and FFF 7 MV energy, using IMRT or mARC.

We chose to investigate if disease burden at time of SADT initiation is associated with clinical outcomes following biochemical failure (BF) post-salvage radiation therapy (SRT).  Methods:   Medical records of 575 patients receiving SRT at a single institution from 1986-2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Of 250 patients experiencing BF post-SRT, 172 had a calculable prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) prior to SADT initiation. These patients comprise the analyzed cohort and were divided into four groups based on characteristics at SADT initiation: those with PSADTs >3 months without distant metastasis (DM) (group 1 [less advanced disease], n=62), those with PSADTs <3 months without DM (group 2 [more advanced disease], n=28), those with DM (group 3 [more advanced disease], n=32), and those not receiving SADT during follow-up (group 4, n=50). Endpoints included prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall mortality (OM). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate survival, and Cox proportional hazards models were used for multivariate analysis.  Results:   Median follow-up post-SRT was 7.9 years. Patients starting SADT with more advanced disease were at significantly increased risk for PCSM (hazard ratio [HR]:2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-5.6, p=0.005) and OM (HR:1.9, 95% CI: 1.0-3.5, p=0.04) compared to those receiving SADT with less advanced disease. PCSM and OM did not significantly differ between groups 1 and 4 or groups 2 and 3. Of note, patients in group 4 had very long PSADTs (median = 27.0 months) that were significantly longer than those of group 1 (median = 6.0 months) (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis including groups 1-3 found a pre-SADT PSADT <3 months to be the most significant predictor of PCSM (HR:4.2, 95% CI: 1.6-11.1, p=0.004) and the only significant predictor of OM (HR:2.9, 95% CI: 1.3-6.7, p=0.01).  Conclusions:   Less advanced disease at initiation of SADT is associated with decreased PCSM and OM following BF post-SRT; however, observation may be reasonable for patients with very long PSADTs.

Materials and methods:   The study was approved by the ethics committee for studies in humans and the animal care committee. The hypothesis was tested by means of subcutaneous injection of human muscle precursor cells from the rectus abdominis muscle into nude mice (n = 18). Animals injected with human fibroblasts, prostate cancer cells, or collagen served as control animals (four in each group). T1, T2, T2*, and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured at 4.7-T MR imaging. MR imaging parameters were statistically evaluated by using analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. The engineered muscle was characterized by means of immunofluorescence, Western blot, and contraction assays.  Results:   Muscle tissue in the early stages of the differentiation process exhibited distinctly higher T1 (mean ± standard deviation, 2242 msec ± 116), T2 (224 msec ± 18), and T2* (33.3 msec ± 3.6) values and ADCs (1.53 × 10(-3) mm(2)/sec ± 0.03) compared with those of skeletal muscle.

Besides conventional parameters, a wealth of prognostic biomarkers has been proposed so far. None of which, however, have successfully been implemented in a routine setting so far. The aim of our study was to systematically verify a set of published prognostic markers for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Following an in-depth PubMed search, 28 markers were selected that have been proposed as multivariate prognostic markers for primary prostate cancer. Their prognostic validity was examined in a radical prostatectomy cohort of 238 patients with a median follow-up of 60 months and biochemical progression as endpoint of the analysis. Immunohistochemical evaluation was performed using previously published cut-off values, but allowing for optimisation if necessary. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to determine the prognostic value of biomarkers included in this study.  Results:   Despite the application of various cut-offs in the analysis, only four (14%) markers were verified as independently prognostic (AKT1, stromal AR, EZH2, and PSMA) for PSA relapse following radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Apparently, many immunohistochemistry-based studies on prognostic markers seem to be over-optimistic.

Repositioning of existing approved drugs with known side effect profiles can provide advantages because de novo drug design suffers from high developmental failure rates and undesirable side effects which have dramatically increased costs. Ligands that target estrogen receptor β (ERβ) could be useful in a variety of diseases ranging from cancer to neurological to cardiovascular disorders. In this context, it is important to minimize cross-reactivity with ERα, which has been shown to trigger increased rates of several types of cancer. Because of high sequence similarities between the ligand binding domains of ERα and ERβ, preferentially targeting one subtype can prove challenging. Here, we describe a sequential ligand screening approach comprised of complementary in-house assays to identify small molecules that are selective for ERβ. Methods include differential scanning fluorimetry, fluorescence polarization and a GAL4 transactivation assay. We used this strategy to screen several commercially-available chemical libraries, identifying thirty ERβ binders that were examined for their selectivity for ERβ versus ERα, and tested the effects of selected ligands in a prostate cancer cell proliferation assay.

The ethyl acetate extract of the ethanol extract had a stronger inhibitory effect on growth and a stronger stimulatory effect on apoptosis than any of the other extracts. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the ethyl acetate extract suppressed the transcriptional activity of NF-kB, increased the level of caspase-3, and decreased the levels of phospho-Erk1/2 and phospho-Akt.

Such metastatic disease is characterized by the presence of osteoblastic bone lesions, and is associated with high rates of mortality. However, the various mechanisms involved in prostate cancer-induced osteoblastic differentiation have not been fully explored. Semaphorin 3A (Sema 3A) is a newly identified regulator of bone metabolism which stimulates differentiation of pre-osteoblastic cells under physiological conditions. We investigated in this study whether prostate cancer cells can mediate osteoblastic activity through Sema 3A.  Methods:   We cultured osteoprogenitor MC3T3-E1 cells in prostate cancer-conditioned medium, and analyzed levels of Sema 3A protein in diverse prostate cancer cell lines to identify cell lines in which Sema 3A production showed a positive correlation with osteo-stimulation. C4-2 cells were stably transfected with Sema 3A short hairpin RNA to further determine whether Sema 3A contributes to the ability of C4-2 cells to induce osteoblastic differentiation.  Results:   Down-regulation of Sema 3A expression decreased indicators of C4-2 CM-induced osteoblastic differentiation, including alkaline phosphatase production and mineralization. Additionally, silencing or neutralizing Sema 3A in C4-2 cells resulted in diminished β-catenin expression in osteogenitor MC3T3-E1 cells.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that prostate cancer-induced osteoblastic differentiation is at least partially mediated by Sema 3A, and may be regulated by the β-catenin signalling pathway.

Our objective is to ascertain the similarities and differences between mortality trends in breast cancer among women and prostate cancer in Spain using age-period-cohort models, and analyse the correlation between incidence of breast and prostate cancer at cancer registries locally and world-wide.  Methods:   We analysed the independent effects of age, period of death and birth cohort on mortality rates for breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in Spain across the period 1952-2011. Segmented regression analyses were performed to detect and estimate changes in period and cohort curvatures. Correlation among age-adjusted incidence rates at 246 population cancer registries world-wide was analysed for the period 2003-2007.  Results:   The mortality trend displayed common characteristics in terms of the annual number of deaths due to these tumours, their adjusted mortality rates and the change points detected in the cohort and period effects. The trend in incidence was very different to that in mortality, due to early detection and progressive improvement in survival. Correlation between the incidence rates of both tumours recorded by registries around the world proved to be a generalised phenomenon.  Conclusions:   This study shows that breast cancer mortality in women and prostate cancer mortality and their trends in Spain display visible similarities in terms of the number of deaths due to these tumours, their adjusted mortality rates and the changes experienced by mortality over time. The effects of advances in the diagnosis of both tumours correspond to a decline in mortality which becomes evident after a lag of approximately eight years.

The study was carried out on 12 cases of different male dogs of terrier (50%), German shepherd (25%) breeds, and Greden (25%), and the age of the dogs ranged from 6 to 13 years (average age 7.8 ± 3.6). The bodyweight ranged from 3.6 to 7.9 kg. Signalment, clinical signs, and diagnostic tools such as ultrasonography, urinary cytology, and histopathology are presented. Dysuria was the most common clinical sign in this study and occurred in 10/12 canine (83.3%) included. Other clinical signs included lameness (5/12 canine, 41.6%) and constipation (3/12 canine, 25%). The range of duration of clinical signs was 5 days to 7 months. Moreover, in the present study, the urinary biochemical markers of different prostate lesions include blood, protein, and glucose and were detected in 11/12 cases (91.6%), 5/12 cases (41.6%), and 2/12 cases (16.6%), respectively. Taken together, sonographic data were classified into four groups based on histological diagnosis. In 7/12 cases (58.4%), the prostate appeared to have BPH lesions, and the remaining lesions included inflammation (3/12 cases, 25%), abscess (1 case, 8.3%), and adenocarcinoma (1 case, 8/3%) on ultrasound. In all cases, prostate tissue had an irregular echotexture. None of the dogs had sonographic evidence of sublumbar lymph node enlargement. Histopathologically, we looked at the prevalence of inflammation (33.3% chronic and 8.3% acute) and BPH (58.4%) in dogs of different ages and breeds, and also, we observed chronic inflammation in >20% of dogs, which was about 25% in 3 cases of the 12 cases referred. More chronic inflammation was associated with more BPH. The majority of the asymptomatic inflammation that is detected in the prostate is classified as chronic inflammation (i.e., as evidenced by the presence of monocytic and/or lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cell infiltrates); however, acute inflammation is also observed to a lesser degree. Acute inflammation, as is typically evidenced by the infiltration of neutrophils, is classically an indicator of an infectious process. Finally, the patients included seven castrated, four castrated together with antibiotic therapy, and one castrated together with chemotherapy intact male dogs, which were treated with the mentioned cases. In conclusion, chronic prostatic inflammation could be a central mechanism in BPH progression, but the pathological features of tissue inflammation were different between BPH and prostate cancer (PCa). Nevertheless, the histological examination of prostate biopsies remains the only way to diagnose prostatic disorders.""","""['Radmehr Shafiee', 'Alireza Shariat', 'Soheil Khalili', 'Hamed Zamankhan Malayeri', 'Aram Mokarizadeh', 'Ali Anissian', 'Mohammad Reza Hafezi Ahmadi', 'Ehsan Hosseini', 'Mostafa Naderafif', 'Siamak Mohsenzadeh', 'Mohammad Hosein Rasoulian', 'Reza Rezapour', 'Maryam Pourzaer']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Retraction Note to: Diagnostic investigations of canine prostatitis incidence together with benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate malignancies, and biochemical recurrence in high-risk prostate cancer as a model for human study.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic value of serum miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression among egyptian patients with prostate cancer.', 'Role of canine basal cells in postnatal prostatic development, induction of hyperplasia, and sex hormone-stimulated growth; and the ductal origin of carcinoma.', 'Significance of histological prostatitis in patients with urinary retention and underlying benign prostatic hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.', 'Prostate growth and inflammation.']"""

In this study, we show that ERG overexpression in in vitro and in vivo models of CRPC is associated with decreased sensitivity to taxanes. ERG affects several parameters of microtubule dynamics and inhibits effective drug-target engagement of docetaxel or cabazitaxel with tubulin. Finally, analysis of a cohort of 34 men with metastatic CRPC treated with docetaxel chemotherapy reveals that ERG-overexpressing prostate cancers have twice the chance of docetaxel resistance than ERG-negative cancers.

The Institute of Public Health of the Osijek-Baranja County in collaborate with different county institutes provide updated information on the cancer occurrence and trends in the Osijek-Baranja County (OBC). The aim of this article is to provide information on the tendencies relating to this cancer group in the OBC during the period from 2001 to 2009, which will be the first report on these cancer sites on a county level in Croatia. This article processes data on cancer incidence and mortality, appertaining age distribution, median age at diagnosis and at death, cancer survival and length of stay in hospital in the OBC. From 2001 to 2009, a total of 891 males were diagnosed with cancers of male genital organs and treated in either of the two OBC hospitals. These cancers accounted for 6.2% of all registered cancers and for 12.5% of all registered cancers among males. Overall age-standardized incidence rate was 60.9/100,000 and it growing strongly during the nine-year period. Although the mortality rate increased too (overall rate was 30.5/100,000), the increase was not as huge as the one in the rate of incidence. Overall median ages at diagnosis and at death were 67.1 years and 74.6 years, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate was estimated to be 53.4%. This report reveals weak reduction in the average length of stay in hospital per patient in the 9-years period (from 11.8 to 11.3 days) and at the same time, the number of admissions almost tripled (from 84 to 221), which is a consequence of the same rise in the number of newly registered cases. During the course of the illness, an average patient was hospitalized 1.6 times and the average length of hospital care was 11.0 days. All the indicators of the quality of the health care provided to C60-C63 cancer patients in the OBC suggest that further advancement in raising the level of diagnostics and treatment should and can be expected in order to reach the corresponding EU standards. An increased incidence and mortality rate from C60-C63 cancers leads to the conclusion that great efforts should be invested into raising the awareness of the male population over 45 years of age on the recognition of the first symptoms of this cancer group and on early preventive examination as to decrease the mortality rate and increase the survival rate and the quality of life of patients suffering from this cancer group.""","""['Josip Milas', 'Senka Samaržić', 'Kreŝimir Milas']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Coll Antropol""","""['Malignant neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs (C30-C39) in the Osijek-Baranja County, Croatia.', 'Neoplasms (C00-D48) in Osijek-Baranja County from 2001 to 2006, Croatia.', 'Malignant neoplasms of breast and female genital organs (C50, C51-C58) in the Osijek-Baranja County, Croatia.', 'Efforts in fighting against cancer in Croatia have to be focused on the primary health care.', 'Male genital cancers.']"""

Main methods:   Malignant (PC-3) and benign (BPH-1) human prostate cells were treated with 17-β-hydroxyestradiol (1 μM) alone or in combination with leptin (0.4, 4, 40 ng/ml) for 72 h. Cell proliferation assay, immunocytochemical staining of estrogen receptor (ER), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS) and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used.  Key findings:   Cell proliferation assay demonstrated that leptin caused significant growth potentiation in both cells. Immunocytochemical staining showed that leptin significantly increased the expression of ER-α and decreased that of ER-β in PC-3 cells. LC-MS method revealed that leptin increased the concentration 4-hydroxyestrone and/or decreased that of 2-methoxyestradiol, 4-methoxyestradiol and 2-methoxyestrone. Interestingly, RT-PCR showed that leptin significantly up-regulated the expression of aromatase and cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) enzymes; however down-regulated the expression of catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme.  Significance:   These data indicate that leptin-induced proliferative effect in prostate cells might be partly attributed to estrogen metabolism.

Pathologic outcomes were compared between races using appropriate statistical tests; biochemical recurrence (BCR) for men with complete follow-up was compared using multivariate models that controlled separately for preoperative and postoperative covariates.  Results:   Very low- and low-risk AA men were more likely to have positive surgical margins (P <.01), adverse pathologic features (P <.01), and be upgraded at RP (P <.01).

Methods:   This study included 65 (99 sides, NVB resection; 31 sides, NVB preservation) and 83 (106 sides, NVB resection; 60 sides, NVB preservation) patients undergoing ORRP and RARP, respectively. The posterior sectors from the apex, mid, and base areas on each side were immunohistochemically stained with an nNOS antibody.  Results:   On the sides with NVB resection, there were no significant differences in the numbers of nNOS-positive nerves in any areas between the ORRP and RARP groups; however, on the sides with NVB preservation, the numbers of nNOS-positive nerves in the ORRP group were significantly higher than those in the RARP group at the apex (84.4 vs 59.2; P = .0028), mid (71.2 vs 52.4; P = .016), and base (148.0 vs 40.8; P <.001) areas. In 55 patients who were judged not to have severe erectile dysfunction before surgery and subsequently underwent nerve-sparing RP, there was a significantly inverse correlation between the total number of nNOS-positive nerves on both sides and the postoperative erectile function.

Whenever a new treatment is introduced into clinical practice, a clinician may have reason to question whether certain side effects occur more frequently in his or her patients than reported in the published literature. However, the clinician, lacking rigorous statistical methods to answer this question, may not draw the correct conclusion until treating a larger number of patients than necessary.  Methods and materials:   We propose a Bayesian framework to calculate (1) the probability that the rate of an adverse event (AE) is above a certain threshold and (2) the number of AEs to be observed before we can conclude with a certain confidence level that the AE rate is above a threshold. Both questions will be answered based on the formulation of a posterior distribution of the AE rate given the observed data. The proposed method does not rely on large sample assumptions, and the computation of the solution is quick and straightforward. The proposed methods are illustrated in 2 clinical scenarios.  Results:   We tabulated the probability that an AE rate is greater than a threshold for a given number of patients experiencing events from an observed number of patients. In addition, we developed a free online interactive tool to facilitate the implementation of the method.  Conclusions:   The proposed method, including the presented tables and the online tool, provides clinicians with a practical means of determining if his or her patients are experiencing a greater (or lower) number of complications than expected. How to use the statistical result to guide a clinical decision depends upon the specifics of the clinical condition and the available treatment alternatives.""","""['Claire McKay Bowen', 'Fang Liu', 'James Wheeler']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['A simple Bayesian approach to quantifying confidence level of adverse event incidence proportion in small samples.', 'Mapping child and adolescent self-reported symptom data to clinician-reported adverse event grading to improve pediatric oncology care and research.', 'Palliative Treatment of Cancer-Related Pain Internet.', 'A Bayesian meta-analytic approach for safety signal detection in randomized clinical trials.', 'Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Weight Loss Interventions to Prevent Obesity-Related Morbidity and Mortality in Adults: An Updated Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.']"""

In the manuscript by Asangani et al., the authors demonstrated that targeting the amino-terminal bromodomains of BRD4 could preferentially suppress human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines.

Human intervention studies with cruciferous vegetable-rich diets also demonstrate modulation of gene expression in important pathways in prostate cells.  Purpose:   Sulforaphane is a constituent of these foods postulated to harbor the anti-neoplastic activity based on multiple tumor models. Our own work demonstrates that sulforaphane inhibits AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. Here, we report results from the first clinical trial of sulforaphane-rich extracts in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We treated 20 patients who had recurrent prostate cancer with 200 μmoles/day of sulforaphane-rich extracts for a maximum period of 20 weeks and determined the proportion of patients with ≥50% PSA declines, the primary endpoint. Only one subject experienced a ≥50% PSA decline. Thus, the primary endpoint was not achieved. Seven patients experienced smaller PSA declines (<50%). There was also a significant lengthening of the on-treatment PSA doubling time (PSADT) compared with the pre-treatment PSADT [6.1 months pre-treatment vs. 9.6 months on-treatment (p = 0.044)]. Finally, treatment with sulforaphane-rich extracts was safe with no Grade 3 adverse events.  Conclusions:   Treatment with 200 μmoles/day of sulforaphane-rich extracts did not lead to ≥50% PSA declines in the majority of patients.

A further study in these cell lines showed that PD could potently affect cell proliferation (indicated by the bromodeoxyuridine assay), induce cell apoptosis (determined by Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry) and cause cell cycle arrest (indicated by PI staining). After being treated with PD for 48 hours, DU145 and LNCaP cells were arrested in the G0 /G1 phase, and PC3 cells were arrested in the G2/M phase. A Western blotting analysis indicated that PD increased the expression of the FOXO3a transcription factor, decreased the expression of p-FOXO3a and MDM2 and increased the expression of FOXO-responsive genes, p21 and p27. MDM2 silencing (transiently by siRNA-MDM2) increased the PD-induced FOXO3a protein expression, while MDM2 overexpression (in cells transiently transfected with a pcDNA3-MDM2 plasmid) decreased the PD-induced expression of the FOXO3a protein. Moreover, PD dose-dependently inhibited the growth of PC3 xenograft tumors in BALB/c nude mice.

Methods:   A total of 150 image pairs were obtained from 30 patients who underwent extreme hypofractionated radiotherapy to a dose of 40 Gy in five fractions on standard linear accelerators. Position verification was obtained with orthogonal x-rays before and after treatment and were used to determine intra-fraction prostate displacement.  Results:   The mean prostate displacements were 0.03 ± 1.23 mm (1SD), 0.18 ± 1.55 mm, and 0.37 ± 1.95 mm in the left-right, superior-inferior, and anterior-posterior directions, respectively. The mean 3D displacement was 2.32 ± 1.55 mm. Only 6 (4%) fractions had a 3D displacement of >5 mm. The average time of treatment delivery for a given fraction was 195 ± 59 seconds.  Conclusions:   The mean intra-fraction prostate displacement during a course of extreme hypofractionated radiotherapy delivered via VMAT, continues to be small.

Methods:   Previously delivered clinical plans for locally advanced head-and-neck (H&N) cancer (n = 5), localized prostate cancer (n = 2), and whole brain with simultaneous integrated boost to 5 metastases (WB + 5M, n = 1) were used for this study. Known rigid rotations were introduced in the planning CT scans. To compensate for these, in-house software was used to adapt gantry and collimator angles in the plan. Doses to planning target volumes (PTV) and critical organs at risk (OAR) were calculated with and without compensation and compared with the original clinical plan. Measurements in the sagittal plane in a polystyrene phantom using radiochromic film were compared by gamma (γ) evaluation for 2 H&N cancer patients.  Results:   For H&N plans, the introduction of 2°-roll and 3°-pitch rotations reduced mean PTV coverage from 98.7 to 96.3%. This improved to 98.1% with gantry and collimator compensation. For prostate plans respective figures were 98.4, 97.5, and 98.4%. For WB + 5M, compensation worked less well, especially for smaller volumes and volumes farther from the isocenter. Mean comparative γ evaluation (3%, 1 mm) between original and pitched plans resulted in 86% γ < 1. The corrected plan restored the mean comparison to 96% γ < 1.

The effect of procedural volume on in-hospital mortality, complications, and length of stay (LOS) was estimated by multilevel regression models.  Results:   In all, 144,432 RPs were analysed. Country-wide RP rates increased between 2001 and 2004, and thereafter remained stable, with large differences between geographical areas. The mean hospital volume increased in the first study years, without centralisation but due to increasing RP numbers at the population level.

Methods:   A total of 48 patients pathologically confirmed as having clinically significant PCa (size > 0.5 cm) underwent preoperative DW-MRI (b of 0-900 s/mm(2)). Data was post-processed by monoexponential and IVIM model for quantitation of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs), perfusion fraction f, diffusivity D and pseudo-diffusivity D*.

The ability of imaging indices to differentiate low-grade (LG, Gleason score (GS) ≤6) from intermediate/high-grade (HG, GS > 6) PCa was analysed by ROC regression.  Results:   Eleven patients had LG tumours (18 foci) and 37 patients had HG tumours (42 foci) on pathology examination. HG tumours had significantly lower ADCs and D in terms of mean, median, 10th and 75th percentiles, combined with higher histogram kurtosis and skewness for ADCs, D and f, than LG PCa (p < 0.05). Histogram D showed relatively higher correlations (ñ = 0.641-0.668 vs. ADCs: 0.544-0.574) with ordinal GS of PCa; and its mean, median and 10th percentile performed better than ADCs did in distinguishing LG from HG PCa.  Conclusion:   It is feasible to stratify the pathological grade of PCa by IVIM with histogram metrics. D performed better in distinguishing LG from HG tumour than conventional ADCs.

Immunotherapy like T cell checkpoint blockade may improve patient survival. However, when and where checkpoint molecules are expressed in CRPC and whether immune evasion is a mechanism of ENZ resistance remains unclear. Thus, we investigated whether clinically relevant immunotherapy targets, specifically PD-L1/2 , PD-1 and CTLA-4, are upregulated in ENZ resistant (ENZR) patients and in a pre-clinical model of ENZ resistance. We show for the first time that patients progressing on ENZ had significantly increased PD-L1/2+ dendritic cells (DC) in blood compared to those naïve or responding to treatment, and a high frequency of PD-1+T cells. These data supported our pre-clinical results, in which we found significantly increased circulating PD-L1/2+ DCs in mice bearing ENZR tumors compared to CRPC, and ENZR tumors expressed significantly increased levels of tumor-intrinsic PD-L1. Importantly, the expression of PD-L1 on ENZR cells, or the ability to modulate PD-L1/2+ DC frequency, was unique to ENZR cell lines and xenografts that did not show classical activation of the androgen receptor. Overall, our results suggest that ENZ resistance is associated with the strong expression of anti-PD-1 therapy targets in circulating immune cells both in patients and in a pre-clinical model that is non-AR driven. Further evaluation of the contribution of tumor vs. immune cell PD-L1 expression in progression of CRPC to anti-androgen resistance and the utility of monitoring circulating cell PD-L1 pathway activity in CRPC patients to predict responsiveness to checkpoint immunotherapy, is warranted.""","""['Jennifer L Bishop', 'Alexander Sio', 'Arkhjamil Angeles', 'Morgan E Roberts', 'Arun A Azad', 'Kim N Chi', 'Amina Zoubeidi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Inhibition of the HER2-YB1-AR axis with Lapatinib synergistically enhances Enzalutamide anti-tumor efficacy in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Preclinical studies using cisplatin/carboplatin to restore the Enzalutamide sensitivity via degrading the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7) to further suppress Enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.', 'Non-coding RNAs in enzalutamide resistance of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

Patients and methods:   The inclusion criteria for the PRIAS study are as follows: clinical stage T1c/T2, PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, PSA density (PSAD) < 0.2 ng/ml per milliliter, one or two positive biopsy cores, and Gleason score (GS) ≤ 6 at initial diagnostic biopsy. Baseline clinical characteristics and prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) at the time of re-Bx were analyzed via multivariate logistic regression with respect to reclassification and 'no cancer' status on the 1-year re-Bx.  Results:   A total of 386 patients were enrolled in PRIAS-JAPAN by the end of 2013. Of these, 216 underwent re-Bx at 1 year. A total of 73 patients (33.8 %) were reclassified, whereas 74 (34.3 %) had no cancer. Older age, a higher PSAD, a higher positive core rate, and a shorter PSADT were significant predictors of reclassification. The positive core rate was the predictor common to reclassification, no cancer, and high GS, upon re-Bx.

The main aim was to evaluate the ability of preoperative urodynamic dysfunctions to predict the outcome of incontinence surgery. The hypothesis was that preoperative bladder dysfunction was predictive of an unsuccessful surgical outcome.  Materials and methods:   Based on patient-reported adverse effects after radical prostatectomy (RP) in 2005-2009, 94 men with persistent severe PPI were invited in 2011 to a clinical examination including urodynamics. When indicated, surgery for PPI was offered, and by January 2014, 46 patients had been operated on with either an artificial urinary sphincter or a sling. The outcome of PPI surgery was evaluated with a follow-up questionnaire. Successful outcome was defined in two ways: patient-reported satisfaction and using one or fewer pads/day.  Results:   Of the 94 men with severe PPI more than 12 months after RP, 76 patients (81% response rate) met for clinical examination. Among them, 99% had intrinsic sphincter deficiency, in 67% coexisting with urodynamic bladder dysfunction. The presence of preoperative bladder dysfunction was not predictive of the outcome of PPI surgery. Preoperative use of fewer pads, less severe PPI, and a longer interval between RP and PPI surgery were associated with the successful outcome of one or fewer pads/day. Longer duration from RP to PPI surgery was the only preoperative factor associated with the successful outcome of satisfaction.  Conclusions:   The hypothesis was not supported as the presence of preoperative urodynamic bladder dysfunction was not predictive of the outcome of PPI surgery in this study.""","""['Henriette Veiby Holm', 'Sophie D Fosså', 'Hans Hedlund', 'Alexander Schultz', 'Alv A Dahl']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['Do clinical or urodynamic parameters predict artificial urinary sphincter outcome in post-radical prostatectomy incontinence?', 'The artificial urinary sphincter and male sling for postprostatectomy incontinence: Which patient should get which procedure?', 'Efficacy of artificial urinary sphincter implantation after failed bone-anchored male sling for postprostatectomy incontinence.', 'Evaluation of urodynamic parameters after sling surgery in men with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence.', 'The etiology of post-radical prostatectomy incontinence and correlation of symptoms with urodynamic findings.', 'Conservative interventions for managing urinary incontinence after prostate surgery.', 'The Role of Urodynamics in Post-Prostatectomy Incontinence.', 'Urodynamic studies prior to urinary incontinence surgery : What is useful?.', 'Recent research on the role of urodynamic study in the diagnosis and treatment of male lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary incontinence.', 'Urinary Incontinence Could Be Controlled by an Inflatable Penile Prosthesis.']"""

Recently, proPSAs, comprised of native proPSA, as well as truncated proPSA forms, [-2] proPSA, [-5] proPSA, and [-7] proPSA, have been shown to be better diagnostic targets than PSA for PCa. Stable isotope labeling-multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SIL/MRM-MS) has been frequently used to measure low-abundance biomarkers in tissues and biofluids, owing to its high sensitivity and specificity, simplicity, and multiplexing capability. In this study, we have developed and optimized a strategy using immunoprecipitation in conjunction with SIL/MRM-MS assay which is capable of sensitive and accurate quantification of proPSA in serum. Since serum and plasma are by far the most complex biological fluids, the immunoprecipitation workflow was optimized to achieve sufficient sensitivity, efficiencies of protein purification with immunoaffinity depletion were determined. The developed strategy can detect proPSA and PSA with a limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) at nanogram per milliliter levels, corresponding to a concentration 6 orders-of-magnitude lower than the most abundant serum proteins. Furthermore, the simultaneous measurement of multiple biomarkers, including the mature and precursor forms of PSA, can be achieved in a single multiplexed analysis using LC/MRM-MS. The strategy demonstrated here provides an attractive alternative to ELISAs or RIAs for the reliably measurement of proPSA to improve the specificity of PCa diagnosis.""","""['Yi-Ting Chen', 'Li-Ping Tuan', 'Hsiao-Wei Chen', 'I-An Wei', 'Min-Yuan Chou', 'Han-Min Chen', 'Yu-Chang Tyan', 'Sung-Fang Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Tumor-associated forms of prostate specific antigen improve the discrimination of prostate cancer from benign disease.', 'Recent advances in proPSA on early detection in prostate cancer.', ""PSA Isoforms' Velocities for Early Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer."", 'From prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to precursor PSA (proPSA) isoforms: a review of the emerging role of proPSAs in the detection and management of early prostate cancer.', '-2 proPSA: A Novel Marker of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeted Mass Spectrometry Assays for Specific Quantification of Urinary proPSA Isoforms.', 'New Antibody-Free Mass Spectrometry-Based Quantification Reveals That C9ORF72 Long Protein Isoform Is Reduced in the Frontal Cortex of Hexanucleotide-Repeat Expansion Carriers.', 'Electrochemical prostate specific antigen aptasensor based on hemin functionalized graphene-conjugated palladium nanocomposites.', 'A Timely Shift from Shotgun to Targeted Proteomics and How It Can Be Groundbreaking for Cancer Research.', 'Detection of candidate biomarkers of prostate cancer progression in serum: a depletion-free 3D LC/MS quantitative proteomics pilot study.']"""

The most common site of prostate cancer metastasis is bone. CXCL12 is preferentially expressed in bone and is targeted by prostate cancer cells, which over-express the receptor for CXCL12, CXCR4. In response to CXCL12 stimulation, Rac1, a GTPase, along with its effectors, regulates actin polymerization to form lamellipodia, which is a critical event for cell migration. Cortactin, an actin-binding protein, is recruited to the lamellipodia and is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues. The phosphorylated cortactin is also involved in cell migration. The inhibition of Rac1 activity using a dominant negative Rac1 impairs lamellipodial protrusion as well as cortactin translocation and cortactin phosphorylation. Denbinobin, a substance extracted from Dendrobium nobile, has anticancer effects in many cancer cell lines. Whether denbinobin can inhibit prostate cancer cell migration is not clear. Here, we report that denbinobin inhibited Rac1 activity. The inhibition of Rac1 activity prevented lamellipodial formation. Cortactin phosphorylation and translocation to the lamellipodia were also impaired, and PC3 cells were unable to migrate. These results indicate that denbinobin prevents CXCL12-induced PC3 cell migration by inhibiting Rac1 activity.""","""['Te-Ling Lu', 'Chien-Kuo Han', 'Yuan-Shiun Chang', 'Te-Jung Lu', 'Hui-Chi Huang', 'Bo-Ying Bao', 'Hsing-Yu Wu', 'Chieh-Hung Huang', 'Chia-Yen Li', 'Tian-Shung Wu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Chin Med""","""['Denbinobin, a phenanthrene from dendrobium nobile, inhibits invasion and induces apoptosis in SNU-484 human gastric cancer cells.', 'Denbinobin inhibits nuclear factor-kappaB and induces apoptosis via reactive oxygen species generation in human leukemic cells.', 'Denbinobin suppresses breast cancer metastasis through the inhibition of Src-mediated signaling pathways.', 'Cortactin: Cell Functions of A Multifaceted Actin-Binding Protein.', 'Cortactin Expression in Hematopoietic Cells: Implications for Hematological Malignancies.', 'As a novel anticancer candidate, ether extract of Dendrobium nobile overstimulates cellular protein biosynthesis to induce cell stress and autophagy.', 'Recent Research Progress on Natural Stilbenes in Dendrobium Species.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Orchidaceae-Derived Anticancer Agents: A Review.', 'Mechanisms and Active Compounds Polysaccharides and Bibenzyls of Medicinal Dendrobiums for Diabetes Management.']"""
