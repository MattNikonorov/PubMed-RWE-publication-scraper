This study demonstrates that Siegesbeckia orientalis ethanol extract (SOE) significantly inhibited the proliferation of RL95-2 human endometrial cancer cells. Treating RL95-2 cells with SOE caused cell arrest in the G2/M phase and induced apoptosis of RL95-2 cells by up-regulating Bad, Bak and Bax protein expression and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein expression. Treatment with SOE increased protein expression of caspase-3, -8 and -9 dose-dependently, indicating that apoptosis was through the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Moreover, SOE was also effective against A549 (lung cancer), Hep G2 (hepatoma), FaDu (pharynx squamous cancer), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), and especially on LNCaP (prostate cancer) cell lines. In total, 10 constituents of SOE were identified by Gas chromatography-mass analysis. Caryophyllene oxide and caryophyllene are largely responsible for most cytotoxic activity of SOE against RL95-2 cells. Overall, this study suggests that SOE is a promising anticancer agent for treating endometrial cancer.""","""['Chi-Chang Chang', 'Hsia-Fen Hsu', 'Kuo-Hung Huang', 'Jing-Mei Wu', 'Shyh-Ming Kuo', 'Xue-Hua Ling', 'Jer-Yiing Houng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Siegesbeckia orientalis Extract Inhibits TGFβ1-Induced Migration and Invasion of Endometrial Cancer Cells.', 'Exploring the anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and antioxidant properties of Santolina corsica Jord. & Fourr.

Clones evolve dynamically in space and time following principles of Darwinian evolution, underpinning important emergent features such as drug resistance and metastasis. Human breast cancer xenoengraftment is used as a means of capturing and studying tumour biology, and breast tumour xenografts are generally assumed to be reasonable models of the originating tumours. However, the consequences and reproducibility of engraftment and propagation on the genomic clonal architecture of tumours have not been systematically examined at single-cell resolution. Here we show, using deep-genome and single-cell sequencing methods, the clonal dynamics of initial engraftment and subsequent serial propagation of primary and metastatic human breast cancers in immunodeficient mice. In all 15 cases examined, clonal selection on engraftment was observed in both primary and metastatic breast tumours, varying in degree from extreme selective engraftment of minor (<5% of starting population) clones to moderate, polyclonal engraftment. Furthermore, ongoing clonal dynamics during serial passaging is a feature of tumours experiencing modest initial selection. Through single-cell sequencing, we show that major mutation clusters estimated from tumour population sequencing relate predictably to the most abundant clonal genotypes, even in clonally complex and rapidly evolving cases. Finally, we show that similar clonal expansion patterns can emerge in independent grafts of the same starting tumour population, indicating that genomic aberrations can be reproducible determinants of evolutionary trajectories. Our results show that measurement of genomically defined clonal population dynamics will be highly informative for functional studies using patient-derived breast cancer xenoengraftment.""","""['Peter Eirew', 'Adi Steif', 'Jaswinder Khattra', 'Gavin Ha', 'Damian Yap', 'Hossein Farahani', 'Karen Gelmon', 'Stephen Chia', 'Colin Mar', 'Adrian Wan', 'Emma Laks', 'Justina Biele', 'Karey Shumansky', 'Jamie Rosner', 'Andrew McPherson', 'Cydney Nielsen', 'Andrew J L Roth', 'Calvin Lefebvre', 'Ali Bashashati', 'Camila de Souza', 'Celia Siu', 'Radhouane Aniba', 'Jazmine Brimhall', 'Arusha Oloumi', 'Tomo Osako', 'Alejandra Bruna', 'Jose L Sandoval', 'Teresa Algara', 'Wendy Greenwood', 'Kaston Leung', 'Hongwei Cheng', 'Hui Xue', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Dong Lin', 'Andrew J Mungall', 'Richard Moore', 'Yongjun Zhao', 'Julie Lorette', 'Long Nguyen', 'David Huntsman', 'Connie J Eaves', 'Carl Hansen', 'Marco A Marra', 'Carlos Caldas', 'Sohrab P Shah', 'Samuel Aparicio']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Clonal evolution in cancer: a tale of twisted twines.', 'The clonal and mutational evolution spectrum of primary triple-negative breast cancers.', 'Clonal evolution in cancer: a tale of twisted twines.', 'Breast tumours maintain a reservoir of subclonal diversity during expansion.', 'Clonal evolution in cancer.', 'Liquid Biopsies for Monitoring Temporal Genomic Heterogeneity in Breast and Colon Cancers.', 'AKR1C2 Promotes Metastasis and Regulates the Molecular Features of Luminal Androgen Receptor Subtype in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Predictors of success in establishing orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models of triple negative breast cancer.', 'Breast cancer heterogeneity and its implication in personalized precision therapy.', 'Chromosomal Instability, Selection and Competition: Factors That Shape the Level of Karyotype Intra-Tumor Heterogeneity.', 'Single-cell genomic variation induced by mutational processes in cancer.']"""

Methods:   Eighty-three patients with pathological proven peripheral zone PCa whose GS in at least one core biopsy met the criteria(GS ≤3+3, GS 3+4, GS 4+3, or GS ≥4+4) were included in this study. DTI was performed using b values of 0 and 800 s/mm(2) with 32 directions in all patients on a 3.0T MRI scanner. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated from the DTI data of patients with the previously mentioned four categories of Gleason scores. An association between DTI measurements(FA, ADC) and GS was tested using the Spearman rank correlation analysis.  Results:   FA values in the sextants found to harbor cancer were positively correlated with the GS(r = 0.48; P < 0.001), while the ADC values were negatively correlated with GS(r = -0.54; P < 0.001). Statistical significance(P < 0.05) was found for FA values among different GS groups, with the exception of GS 3+4 versus GS 4+3 (P = 0.105). The differences between the ADC values were statistically significant for all four different scores(all P < 0.05).  Conclusion:   Quantitative DTI at 3.0T MRI shows a significant association with GS in the evaluation of tumor aggressiveness in peripheral zone PCa, which may be useful to ensure concordance of biopsy results and therefore make the appropriate decision in the management of patients with PCa.""","""['Liang Li', 'Daniel J A Margolis', 'Ming Deng', 'Jie Cai', 'Ling Yuan', 'Zhaoyan Feng', 'Xiangde Min', 'Zhiquan Hu', 'Daoyu Hu', 'Jihong Liu', 'Liang Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'Non-invasive estimation of prostate cancer aggressiveness using diffusion-weighted MRI and 3D proton MR spectroscopy at 3.0\u2009T.', 'Correlation of quantitative diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI parameters with prognostic factors in prostate cancer.', 'Correlation between ADC values and Gleason score in evaluation of prostate cancer: multicentre experience and review of the literature.', 'Advances in magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of peripheral nerve injuries: Diffusion tensor imaging.', 'Acquisition Parameters Influence Diffusion Metrics Effectiveness in Probing Prostate Tumor and Age-Related Microstructure.', 'Prospective evaluation of PI-RADS v2 and quantitative MRI for clinically significant prostate cancer detection in Indian men - East meets West.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 68Ga Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography, and Respective Quantitative Parameters in Detection and Localization of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Intermediate- and High-Risk Group Patients: An Indian Demographic Study.', 'Identification of prostate cancer using multiparametric MR imaging characteristics of prostate tissues referenced to whole mount histopathology.', 'Diffusion and quantification of diffusion of prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the interval from prostate biopsy to radical prostatectomy affects immediate operative outcomes, with a focus on differences in surgical approach. The study population of 1,848 radical prostatectomy patients was divided into two groups according to the surgical approach: open or minimally invasive. Open group included perineal and retropubic approach, and minimally invasive group included laparoscopic and robotic approach. The cut-off of the biopsy-to-surgery interval was 4 weeks. Positive surgical margin status, operative time and estimated blood loss were evaluated as endpoint parameters. In the open group, there were significant differences in operative time and estimated blood loss between the <4-week and ≥4-week interval subgroups, but there was no difference in positive margin rate. In the minimally invasive group, there were no differences in the three outcome parameters between the two subgroups. Multivariate analysis revealed that the biopsy-to-surgery interval was not a significant factor affecting immediate operative outcomes in both open and minimally invasive groups, with the exception of the interval ≥4 weeks as a significant factor decreasing operative time in the minimally invasive group. In conclusion, performing open or minimally invasive radical prostatectomy within 4 weeks of prostate biopsy is feasible for both approaches, and is even beneficial for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy to reduce operative time.""","""['Bumsoo Park', 'Seol Ho Choo', 'Hwang Gyun Jeon', 'Byong Chang Jeong', 'Seong Il Seo', 'Seong Soo Jeon', 'Hyun Moo Lee', 'Han Yong Choi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Korean Med Sci""","""['Does the interval between prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy affect the immediate postoperative outcome?', 'Is Radical Perineal Prostatectomy a Viable Therapeutic Option for Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer?', 'Interval of ≤2 weeks between 12-core prostate biopsy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy does not affect perioperative parameters or surgical outcomes.', 'Perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes after open and minimally invasive prostate cancer surgery: experience from Australasia.', 'Open radical retropubic prostatectomy 2007: the true minimally invasive surgery for localized prostate cancer?', 'Impact of COVID-19 on Prostate Cancer Management: Guidelines for Urologists.', 'Considerations in the Triage of Urologic Surgeries During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Does time interval between prostate biopsy and surgery affect outcomes of radical prostatectomy?

However, prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after prostate SBRT have not been well characterized. The purpose of this study was to analyze the trend in PSA decline following robotic SBRT from a prospective cohort of patients.  Material and methods:   In total 175 patients were treated definitively for localized prostate cancer to a dose of 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions using robotic SBRT in the absence of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). PSA and testosterone were collected at regular intervals following treatment and patients were assessed for biochemical failure and benign PSA bounce. A PSA nadir threshold of 0.5 ng/ml was used as a predictor of long-term disease-free survival. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effect of disease specific covariates on the likelihood of achieving a PSA nadir less than threshold. PSA kinetics were analyzed a multi-component exponential model accounting for benign and malignant sources of PSA.  Results and conclusion:   At a median follow-up of 3 years, 70% of patients achieved a PSA nadir below 0.5 ng/ml with a median PSA nadir of 0.3 ng/ml at a median time to nadir of 30 months. In our cohort, 36.2% experienced a benign PSA bounce. Absence of PSA bounce, initial PSA, and testosterone at the time of nadir proved to be significant predictors of achieving a PSA nadir below threshold. PSA kinetics after prostate SBRT were well described with a functional volume model with fitted half-lives of 4.4 and 14.8 months for malignant and benign sources of PSA, respectively. Patients treated with prostate SBRT experience an initial period of rapid PSA decline followed by a slow decline which will likely result in lower PSA nadirs after longer follow-up. The long-term disease specific impacts of these results remain to be determined.""","""['Thomas P Kole', 'Leonard N Chen', 'Olusola Obayomi-Davies', 'Joy S Kim', 'Siyuan Lei', 'Simeng Suy', 'Anatoly Dritschilo', 'Sean P Collins']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Long-term results and PSA kinetics after robotic SBRT for prostate cancer: multicenter retrospective study in Korea (Korean radiation oncology group study 15-01).', 'Prostate-specific antigen kinetics following hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy boost and whole pelvic radiotherapy for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy as monotherapy or post-external beam radiotherapy boost for prostate cancer: technique, early toxicity, and PSA response.', 'Stereotactic radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'High Dose ""HDR-Like"" Prostate SBRT: PSA 10-Year Results From a Mature, Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial.', 'Early Prostate-Specific Antigen Kinetics for Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated With Definitive Radiation Therapy.', 'Characteristics of PSA Bounce after Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Long-term results and PSA kinetics after robotic SBRT for prostate cancer: multicenter retrospective study in Korea (Korean radiation oncology group study 15-01).', 'A pilot study of highly hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy over 3 weeks for localized prostate cancer.']"""

We aimed to initiate worldwide surveillance of cancer survival by central analysis of population-based registry data, as a metric of the effectiveness of health systems, and to inform global policy on cancer control.  Methods:   Individual tumour records were submitted by 279 population-based cancer registries in 67 countries for 25·7 million adults (age 15-99 years) and 75,000 children (age 0-14 years) diagnosed with cancer during 1995-2009 and followed up to Dec 31, 2009, or later. We looked at cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, lung, breast (women), cervix, ovary, and prostate in adults, and adult and childhood leukaemia. Standardised quality control procedures were applied; errors were corrected by the registry concerned. We estimated 5-year net survival, adjusted for background mortality in every country or region by age (single year), sex, and calendar year, and by race or ethnic origin in some countries. Estimates were age-standardised with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights.  Findings:   5-year survival from colon, rectal, and breast cancers has increased steadily in most developed countries. For patients diagnosed during 2005-09, survival for colon and rectal cancer reached 60% or more in 22 countries around the world; for breast cancer, 5-year survival rose to 85% or higher in 17 countries worldwide. Liver and lung cancer remain lethal in all nations: for both cancers, 5-year survival is below 20% everywhere in Europe, in the range 15-19% in North America, and as low as 7-9% in Mongolia and Thailand. Striking rises in 5-year survival from prostate cancer have occurred in many countries: survival rose by 10-20% between 1995-99 and 2005-09 in 22 countries in South America, Asia, and Europe, but survival still varies widely around the world, from less than 60% in Bulgaria and Thailand to 95% or more in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the USA. For cervical cancer, national estimates of 5-year survival range from less than 50% to more than 70%; regional variations are much wider, and improvements between 1995-99 and 2005-09 have generally been slight. For women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005-09, 5-year survival was 40% or higher only in Ecuador, the USA, and 17 countries in Asia and Europe. 5-year survival for stomach cancer in 2005-09 was high (54-58%) in Japan and South Korea, compared with less than 40% in other countries. By contrast, 5-year survival from adult leukaemia in Japan and South Korea (18-23%) is lower than in most other countries. 5-year survival from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less than 60% in several countries, but as high as 90% in Canada and four European countries, which suggests major deficiencies in the management of a largely curable disease.

This first-in-human phase I study aimed to determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of DMS612 administered by 10-minute intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of an every-28-day schedule.  Experimental design:   Patients with advanced solid malignancies were eligible. Enrollment followed a 3+3 design. PKs of DMS612 and metabolites were assessed by mass spectroscopy and PD by γ-H2AX immunofluorescence.  Results:   A total of 31 patients, including those with colorectal (11), RCC (4), cervical (2), and urothelial (1) cancers, were enrolled. Six dose levels were studied, from 1.5 mg/m(2) to 12 mg/m(2). DLTs of grade 4 neutropenia and prolonged grade 3 thrombocytopenia were observed at 12 mg/m(2). The MTD was determined to be 9 mg/m(2) with a single DLT of grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 of 12 patients. Two patients had a confirmed partial response at the 9 mg/m(2) dose level, in renal (1) and cervical (1) cancer. DMS612 was rapidly converted into active metabolites. γ-H2AX immunofluorescence revealed dose-dependent DNA damage in both peripheral blood lymphocytes and scalp hairs.  Conclusions:   The MTD of DMS12 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days was 9 mg/m(2). DMS612 appears to be an alkylating agent with unique tissue specificities.

Clinical factors such as tumor grade, stage, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are currently used to identify those who are at risk of recurrence and who may benefit from adjuvant therapy, but novel biomarkers that improve risk stratification and that distinguish local from systemic recurrence are needed.  Objective:   To determine whether adding the Decipher genomic classifier, a validated metastasis risk-prediction model, to standard risk-stratification tools (CAPRA-S and Stephenson nomogram) improves accuracy in predicting metastatic disease within 5 yr after surgery (rapid metastasis [RM]) in an independent cohort of men with adverse pathologic features after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   The study population consisted of 169 patients selected from 2641 men who underwent RP at the Cleveland Clinic between 1987 and 2008 who met the following criteria: (1) preoperative PSA>20 ng/ml, stage pT3 or margin positive, or Gleason score≥8; (2) pathologic node negative; (3) undetectable post-RP PSA; (4) no neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy; and (5) minimum of 5-yr follow-up for controls. The final study cohort consisted of 15 RM patients and 154 patients as non-RM controls.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The performance of Decipher was evaluated individually and in combination with clinical risk factors using concordance index (c-index), decision curve analysis, and logistic regression for prediction of RM.  Results and limitations:   RM patients developed metastasis at a median of 2.3 yr (interquartile range: 1.7-3.3). In multivariable analysis, Decipher was a significant predictor of RM (odds ratio: 1.48; p=0.018) after adjusting for clinical risk factors. Decipher had the highest c-index, 0.77, compared with the Stephenson model (c-index: 0.75) and CAPRA-S (c-index: 0.72) as well as with a panel of previously reported prostate cancer biomarkers unrelated to Decipher. Integration of Decipher into the Stephenson nomogram increased the c-index from 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.85) to 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68-0.89).  Conclusions:   Decipher was independently validated as a genomic metastasis signature for predicting metastatic disease within 5 yr after surgery in a cohort of high-risk men treated with RP and managed conservatively without any adjuvant therapy. Integration of Decipher into clinical nomograms increased prediction of RM. Decipher may allow identification of men most at risk for metastatic progression who should be considered for multimodal therapy or inclusion in clinical trials.  Patient summary:   Use of Decipher in addition to standard clinical information more accurately identified men who developed metastatic disease within 5 yr after surgery. The results suggest that Decipher allows improved identification of the men who should consider secondary therapy from among the majority that may be managed conservatively after surgery.""","""['Eric A Klein', 'Kasra Yousefi', 'Zaid Haddad', 'Voleak Choeurng', 'Christine Buerki', 'Andrew J Stephenson', 'Jianbo Li', 'Michael W Kattan', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Elai Davicioni']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Tissue-Based Genomics Augments Post-Prostatectomy Risk Stratification in a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men.', 'Tissue-based Genomics Augments Post-prostatectomy Risk Stratification in a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men.', 'Combined value of validated clinical and genomic risk stratification tools for predicting prostate cancer mortality in a high-risk prostatectomy cohort.', 'Multi-institutional validation of the CAPRA-S score to predict disease recurrence and mortality after radical prostatectomy.', 'Individual Patient-Level Meta-Analysis of the Performance of the Decipher Genomic Classifier in High-Risk Men After Prostatectomy to Predict Development of Metastatic Disease.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.', 'Radiomics and Radiogenomics in Pelvic Oncology: Current Applications and Future Directions.', 'The combination of prostate MRI PI-RADS scoring system and a genomic classifier is associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis at the time of radical prostatectomy.', 'Radiogenomics influence on the future of prostate cancer risk stratification.', 'The Prognostic Value of Liquid Biopsies for Benefit of Salvage Radiotherapy in Relapsed Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Genetic Testing and Its Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Management: Consensus Statements from the Hong Kong Urological Association and Hong Kong Society of Uro-Oncology.']"""

Expression of human cadherin-11 (Cad11), also known as osteoblast cadherin, in prostate cancer increases the migration of prostate cancer cells. How Cad11 mediates cell migration is unknown. Using the human Cad11 cytoplasmic domain in pulldown assays, we identified human angiomotin (Amot), known to be involved in cell polarity, migration, and Hippo pathway, as a component of the Cad11 protein complex. Deletion analysis showed that the last C-terminal 10 amino acids in Cad11 cytoplasmic domain are required for Amot binding. Further, Cad11 preferentially interacts with Amot-p80 than Amot-p130 isoform and binds directly to the middle domain of Amot-p80. Cad11-Amot interaction affects Cad11-mediated cell migration, but not homophilic adhesion, as deletion of Amot binding motif of Cad11 (Cad11-ΔAmot) did not abolish Cad11-mediated cell-cell adhesion of mouse L cells, but significantly reduced Cad11-mediated cell migration of human C4-2B4 and PC3-mm2 prostate cancer cells and human HEK293T cells.

However, most of these shape-based methods are computationally expensive. There are instances in an image where no overlapping objects are present and applying these schemes results in significant computational overhead without any accompanying, additional benefit. In this paper we present a novel adaptive active contour scheme (AdACM) that combines boundary and region based energy terms with a shape prior in a multi level set formulation. To reduce the computational overhead, the shape prior term in the variational formulation is only invoked for those instances in the image where overlaps between objects are identified; these overlaps being identified via a contour concavity detection scheme. By not having to invoke all three terms (shape, boundary, region) for segmenting every object in the scene, the computational expense of the integrated active contour model is dramatically reduced, a particularly relevant consideration when multiple objects have to be segmented on very large histopathological images. The AdACM was employed for the task of segmenting nuclei on 80 prostate cancer tissue microarray images from 40 patient studies. Nuclear shape based, architectural and textural features extracted from these segmentations were extracted and found to able to discriminate different Gleason grade patterns with a classification accuracy of 86% via a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier. On average the AdACM model provided 60% savings in computational times compared to a non-optimized hybrid active contour model involving a shape prior.""","""['Sahirzeeshan Ali', 'Robert Veltri', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Christhunesa Christudass', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['Adaptive energy selective active contour with shape priors for nuclear segmentation and gleason grading of prostate cancer.', 'An integrated region-, boundary-, shape-based active contour for multiple object overlap resolution in histological imagery.', 'Explicit shape descriptors: novel morphologic features for histopathology classification.', 'Advances in the computational and molecular understanding of the prostate cancer cell nucleus.', 'Tumor Malignancy Detection Using Histopathology Imaging.', ""A hitchhiker's guide to cancer models."", 'Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification via Nondestructive 3D Pathology with Deep Learning-Assisted Gland Analysis.', 'Computer extracted gland features from H&E predicts prostate cancer recurrence comparably to a genomic companion diagnostic test: a large multi-site study.', 'Computerized tumor multinucleation index (MuNI) is prognostic in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Automated gleason grading on prostate biopsy slides by statistical representations of homology profile.']"""

The objective of this study was to determine whether we could predict its infiltration at the time of the prostate biopsy to know when to indicate the biopsy of the seminal vesicles.  Material and methods:   observational retrospective study of 466 patients who underwent seminal vesicle biopsy. The indication for this biopsy was a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level greater than 10 ng/ml or an asymmetric or obliterated prostatoseminal angle. The following variables were included in the analysis: PSA level, PSA density, prostate volume, number of cores biopsied, suspicious rectal examination, and preservation of the prostatoseminal angle, studying its relationship with the involvement of the seminal vesicles.  Results:   Forty-one patients (8.8%) had infiltrated seminal vesicles and 425 (91.2%) had no involvement. In the univariate analysis, the cases with infiltration had a higher mean PSA level (P < .01) and PSA density (P < .01), as well as a lower mean prostate volume (P < .01). A suspicious rectal examination (20.7% of the infiltrated vesicles) and the obliteration or asymmetry of the prostatoseminal angle (33.3% of the infiltrated vesicles) were significantly related to the involvement (P < .01). In the multivariate analysis, we concluded that the probability of having infiltrated seminal vesicles is 5.19 times higher if the prostatoseminal angle is not preserved (P < .01), 4.65 times higher for PSA levels >19.60 ng/dL (P < .01) and 2.95 times higher if there is a suspicious rectal examination (P = .014). Furthermore, this probability increases by 1.04 times for each unit of prostate volume lower (P < .01). The ROC curves showed maximum sensitivity and specificity at 19.6 ng/mL for PSA and 0.39 for PSA density.  Conclusions:   In this series, greater involvement of seminal vesicles was associated with a PSA level ≥20 ng/ml, a suspicious rectal examination and a lack of prostatoseminal angle preservation.""","""['J Panach-Navarrete', 'F García-Morata', 'J A Hernández-Medina', 'J M Martínez-Jabaloyas']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Preoperative prostate specific antigen and prostate volume are significant predictors of seminal vesicle invasion in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Ultrasound analysis of seminal vesicles in prostate cancer invasion: monocentric experience of an extended prostate biopsy scheme.', 'Prognostic value of seminal vesicle involvement due to prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Seminal vesicle biopsies: an useful staging procedure-exposure of seminal vesicle biopsies protocol and review of the literature.', 'Carcinosarcoma of the prostate in combination with adenocarcinoma of the prostate and adenocarcinoma of the seminal vesicles.

Purpose:   This randomized pilot trial evaluated the efficacy of a targeted PCa screening decision aid in unaffected FDRs of PCa survivors.  Methods:   Seventy-eight Black and White FDRs were randomized to one of two decision aid groups; 39 to a FDR-targeted decision aid and 39 to a general decision aid.

PCa screening decision outcomes included knowledge, decisional conflict, distress, and satisfaction with screening decision. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks after baseline.  Results:   There were no differences by intervention group for knowledge, decisional conflict, distress, or satisfaction with screening decision (p>0.05). However, men in both groups had significant increases in knowledge and decreases in decisional conflict (p<0.001). These changes were most pronounced (p<0.05) for younger men compared to older men.

Material and methods:   We performed cognitive-targeted biopsy after multiparametric MRI in 53 patients with progressive elevation of PSA. All patients provided written informed consent. Biopsies were done via a transperineal route under ultrasound guidance. The first three samples were obtained by cognitive targeting, with the target lesion determined by multiparametric MRI according to the PI-RADS (prostate imaging, reporting, and data system) criteria. Then 9 cylinders were obtained from the remaining segments of the prostate (systematic biopsies). The pathologist evaluated the 12 cylinders without knowing which ones were obtained by cognitive targeting. In patients with multifocal lesions, we defined the dominant lesion as the one with the highest Gleason score and tumor volume; in patients with unifocal lesions, we defined the dominant lesion as the lesion identified.  Results:   We diagnosed 29 prostate tumors. In 89.7% (26/29), the dominant nodule was diagnosed by the cognitive-targeted biopsy. If only cognitive-targeted biopsy had been done, the dominant nodule would not have been diagnosed in two (3.8%, 2/53) patients and only one (1.8%, 1/53) patient, in whom no sample was obtained from the lesion with the highest Gleason score, would have been understaged. The rate of positivity of cognitive-targeted biopsy was 50.9% (27/53) in the entire group of patients and 46.3% (19/41) in the group of patients with previous negative biopsies. No significant immediate or late complications were observed.

We tested the power of postoperative ultrasensitive prostate specific antigen to identify eventual biochemical failure.  Materials and methods:   We identified 247 patients at high risk with a median followup of 44 months who underwent radical prostatectomy from 1991 to 2013. Each patient had extraprostatic extension and/or a positive margin. Surgical technique, initial prostate specific antigen, pathology findings and postoperative prostate specific antigen were analyzed. The ultrasensitive prostate specific antigen assay threshold was 0.01 ng/ml. Conventional biochemical relapse was defined as prostate specific antigen 0.2 ng/ml or greater. Kaplan-Meier and Cox multivariate analyses were done to compare the rates of ultrasensitive prostate specific antigen recurrence and conventional biochemical relapse.  Results:   Sensitivity analysis revealed that ultrasensitive prostate specific antigen 0.03 ng/ml or greater was the optimal threshold to identify recurrence. A first postoperative ultrasensitive value of 0.03 ng/ml or greater, Gleason grade, T stage, initial prostate specific antigen and margin status predicted conventional biochemical relapse. On multivariate analysis only a first postoperative ultrasensitive value of 0.03 ng/ml or greater, Gleason grade and T stage independently predicted conventional biochemical relapse. First postoperative ultrasensitive prostate specific antigen 0.03 ng/ml or greater conferred the highest risk (HR 8.5, p < 0.0001) and identified conventional biochemical relapse with greater sensitivity than undetectable first conventional prostate specific antigen (70% vs 46%). Any postoperative prostate specific antigen 0.03 ng/ml or greater captured all failures missed by the first postoperative value (100% sensitivity) with accuracy (96% specificity). Defining failure at an ultrasensitive value of 0.03 ng/ml or greater yielded a median lead time advantage of 18 months (mean 24) over the conventional definition of prostate specific antigen 0.2 ng/ml or greater.  Conclusions:   Ultrasensitive prostate specific antigen 0.03 ng/ml or greater is an independent factor that identifies biochemical relapse more accurately than any traditional risk factors and confers a significant lead time advantage.

We determined the percent of men in whom the index lesion could be defined using transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies.  Materials and methods:   Included in study were consecutive men undergoing transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies with biopsies grouped into 20 zones. Men with clinically significant disease in only 1 prostate area were considered to have an identifiable index lesion. We evaluated the impact of using 2 definitions of clinically significant disease (Gleason grade pattern 4 and/or lesion volume 0.5 cc or greater) and 2 clustering rules (stringent and tolerant) to define the index lesion.  Results:   Included in study were 391 men with a median age of 62 years (IQR 58-67) and a median prostate specific antigen of 6.9 ng/ml (IQR 4.8-10.0). Of the men 269 (69%) were previously diagnosed with prostate cancer. By deploying a median of 1.2 cores per ml (IQR 0.9-1.7) cancer was diagnosed in 82.9% of the men (324 of 391) with a median of 6 positive cores (IQR 2-9), a median maximum cancer core length of 5 mm (IQR 3-8) and a total cancer core length per zone of 7 mm (IQR 3-13). Insignificant disease was found in 26.3% to 42.9% of cases. When a stringent spatial relationship was used to define individual lesions, 44.4% to 54.6% of patients had 1 index lesion and 12.7% to 19.1% had more than 1 area with clinically significant disease. These proportions changed to 46.6% to 59.2% and 10.5% to 14.5%, respectively, when less stringent spatial clustering was applied.

All patients had filled in the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) scala, tested for PSA and prostate volume measurement was done by TRUS prior to biopsy. According to their biopsy results, patients were divided into two groups: negative and positive for malignancy.  Results:   There was a significant but low correlation of 0.37 between IPSS and prostate volume measurement by TRUS (p=0.001). Serum free prostate specific antigen (fPSA), total PSA (tPSA), ratio of fPSA to tPSA and PSA density did not show a statistically significant correlation with IPSS (p>0.05). No statistically significant difference in IPSS between the benign and malignant groups (p=0.681) was found.

The resulting chip consists of 40 polyacrylamide gel pad array units for the immobilization of microbeads and each gel pad array is surrounded with a PEG micropillar ring to confine the samples within the microarray. As a proof of concept, this chip was tested for quantitative immunoassays for two model cancer markers, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and prostate specific antigen (PSA), in serum samples. Detection limits below the physiological threshold level for cancer diagnosis were achieved with good inter- and intra-chip reproducibility. Moreover, by using spatial encoded microbeads, simultaneous detection of both hCG and PSA on each gel pad array is achieved with single filter fluorescence imaging. This gel pad array chip is easy to use, easy to fabricate with low cost materials and minimal equipment and reusable.

In this study, we examined the expression of miRNA-126 (miR-126) and miR-149 in prostate cancer, and investigated the molecular mechanisms by which they affect syndecan-1 in prostate cancer. Functional analysis of miR-126 and miR-149 was conducted in the prostate cancer cell lines, PC3, Du145, and LNCaP. The expression levels of SOX2, NANOG, Oct4, miR-126 and miR-149 were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. After silencing syndecan-1, miR-126, and/or miR-149 in the PC3 cells, cell proliferation, senescence, and p21 induction were assessed using the MTS assay, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) assay, and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Compared to the Du145 and LNCaP cells, PC3 cells exhibited higher expression of syndecan-1. When syndecan-1 was silenced, the PC3 cells showed reduced expression of miR-126 and miR-149 most effectively. Suppression of miR-126 and/or miR-149 significantly inhibited cell growth via p21 induction and subsequently, induced senescence. The mRNA expression levels of SOX2, NANOG, and Oct4 were significantly increased in response to the silencing of miR-126 and/or miR-149. Our results suggest that miR-126 and miR-149 are associated with the expression of syndecan-1 in prostate cancer cells. These miRNAs promote cell proliferation by suppressing SOX2, NANOG, and Oct4.

During the follow-up, 49,744 cancers were identified in men and 7860 in women. Prostate cancer in men was positively related to minor depression (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05, 1.23), and cervical cancer in women was inversely related to major depression (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83, 0.98) after adjusting for potential confounders.

In PGE2-treated LNCaP cells, up-regulation of HIF-1α requires the internalization of PGE2, which is in sharp contrast with the generally accepted view that PGE2 acts through EP receptors located at the cell membrane. Here we aimed to study in androgen-independent PC3 cells the role of intracellular PGE2 in several events linked to prostate cancer progression. To this end, we used bromocresol green, an inhibitor of prostaglandin uptake that blocked the immediate rise in intracellular immunoreactive PGE2 following treatment with 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2. Bromocresol green prevented the stimulatory effect of 16,16-dimethyl-PGE on cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion and on HIF-1α expression and activity, the latter assessed as the HIF-dependent activation of (i) a hypoxia response element-luciferase plasmid construct, (ii) production of angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor-A and (iii) in vitro angiogenesis. The basal phenotype of PC3 cells was also affected by bromocresol green, that substantially lowered expression of HIF-1α, production of vascular endothelial growth factor-A and cell proliferation.

BCAS2 stabilised AR protein through both hormone-dependent and -independent manners. There are at least two mechanisms for BCAS2-mediated AR protein upregulation: One is p53-dependent. The p53 is suppressed by BCAS2 that results in increasing AR mRNA and protein expression. The other is via p53-independent inhibition of proteasome degradation. As BCAS2 can form a complex with AR and HSP90, it may function with HSP90 to stabilise AR protein from being degraded by proteasome.

This study's objectives are to identify a risk threshold for selecting individuals for screening, to compare its efficiency with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria for identifying screenees, and to determine whether never-smokers should be screened. Lung cancer risks are compared between smokers aged 55-64 and ≥ 65-80 y.  Methods and findings:   Applying the PLCO(m2012) model, a model based on 6-y lung cancer incidence, we identified the risk threshold above which National Lung Screening Trial (NLST, n = 53,452) CT arm lung cancer mortality rates were consistently lower than rates in the chest X-ray (CXR) arm. We evaluated the USPSTF and PLCO(m2012) risk criteria in intervention arm (CXR) smokers (n = 37,327) of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). The numbers of smokers selected for screening, and the sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values (PPVs) for identifying lung cancers were assessed. A modified model (PLCOall2014) evaluated risks in never-smokers. At PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151, the 65th percentile of risk, the NLST CT arm mortality rates are consistently below the CXR arm's rates. The number needed to screen to prevent one lung cancer death in the 65th to 100th percentile risk group is 255 (95% CI 143 to 1,184), and in the 30th to <65th percentile risk group is 963 (95% CI 291 to -754); the number needed to screen could not be estimated in the <30th percentile risk group because of absence of lung cancer deaths. When applied to PLCO intervention arm smokers, compared to the USPSTF criteria, the PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151 threshold selected 8.8% fewer individuals for screening (p<0.001) but identified 12.4% more lung cancers (sensitivity 80.1% [95% CI 76.8%-83.0%] versus 71.2% [95% CI 67.6%-74.6%], p<0.001), had fewer false-positives (specificity 66.2% [95% CI 65.7%-66.7%] versus 62.7% [95% CI 62.2%-63.1%], p<0.001), and had higher PPV (4.2% [95% CI 3.9%-4.6%] versus 3.4% [95% CI 3.1%-3.7%], p<0.001). In total, 26% of individuals selected for screening based on USPSTF criteria had risks below the threshold PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151. Of PLCO former smokers with quit time >15 y, 8.5% had PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151. None of 65,711 PLCO never-smokers had PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151. Risks and lung cancers were significantly greater in PLCO smokers aged ≥ 65-80 y than in those aged 55-64 y. This study omitted cost-effectiveness analysis.  Conclusions:   The USPSTF criteria for CT screening include some low-risk individuals and exclude some high-risk individuals.

The sensing interface was prepared by immobilizing a ferrocene (Fc)-labeled hairpin DNA on a gold electrode. In the presence of DNA2-antibody2 (Ab2) and methylene blue (MB)-labeled DNA1-Ab1 probes, the addition of target protein could induce the sandwich immunoreaction among two probes and the protein to trigger the hybridization of DNA1 and DNA2, which subsequently unfolded the hairpin DNA to form a three-arm DNA structure on the sensing interface. The DNA assembly caused the departure of Fc from the electrode and the approach of MB to the electrode, which led to the signal decrease and increase of Fc and MB respectively for ratiometric readout. Using prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a model target, the ratiometric electrochemical assay showed a linear detection range from 0.01 to 200ng/mL with a detection limit of 4.3pg/mL (the mean signal of blank measures+3σ).

A diagnostic framework is proposed to measure elastic and viscous behaviors simultaneously using a reduced set of viscoelastic parameters, giving a reliable index for quantitative assessment of tissue quality. The approach is illustrated on prostate models reconstructed from prostate MRI scans. The examples show that the change in viscoelastic time constant between healthy and cancerous tissue is a key index for quantitative diagnostics using point probing.

In this paper, we construct a reliable heterogeneous network by fusing multiple networks, a PPI network reconstructed by topological similarity, a phenotype similarity network and known associations between diseases and genes. We then devise a random walk-based algorithm on the reliable heterogeneous network called RWRHN to prioritize potential candidate genes for inherited diseases. The results of leave-one-out cross-validation experiments show that the RWRHN algorithm has better performance than the RWRH and CIPHER methods in inferring disease genes.

Methods:   Patients were retrospectively identified for inclusion by clinically localized disease, GS7, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 30 ng/mL at diagnosis, and follow-up with PSA at > 12 months. Comparison of demographic, tumor, staging, and outcome variables was performed. Disease recurrence was defined as per contemporary society guidelines. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for disease control estimates.  Results:   Between 2003 and 2010, a total of 253 patients were diagnosed with GS7 prostate cancer, of whom 207 were eligible for the current analysis (120 RP, 87 RT). Excepting older age for RT patients (median 73 vs. 62 years), the groups were well balanced. For RP patients, 82 patients (60%) had at least 1 high-risk feature, 4 (5%) of whom received adjuvant RT. For RT patients, 71 patients (82%) received hormone therapy (median duration 6 months). At a median follow-up of 62.2 months (range 13.1-136.6 months, with no difference between treatment groups), 64 patients had PSA relapse (51 RP, 13 RT), and 15 had died (5 of or with disease). PSA relapse-free survival was inferior for RP versus RT (P < .0001), with 5-year rates of 55.4% versus 82.6%, respectively.  Conclusion:   For GS7 prostate cancer patients, RT is associated with superior disease-free survival at 5 years compared to RP alone, without difference in disease-specific survival.

According to sensitivity and specificity f/t% PSA cutoff points were determined to be 10%, 15%, 15%, and 10% in 50-59 years, 60-69 years, >70 years, and all ages categories, respectively, in patients with initial PSA level of 4-10 ng/mL. f/t PSA ratio had an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.81 (95% confidence level: 0.80-0.82) for all age groups in detecting prostate cancer. f/t PSA ratio has an AUC value of 0.669 (0.632-0.705) in detecting prostate cancer among patients with a PSA level of 4-10 ng/mL. Ten percent of f/t PSA ratio had the highest specificity with PLR and 30% f/t PSA ratio had the highest sensitivity with lower NLR in the all-age categories. The current study shows that the use of f/t PSA ratio in patients with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/mL should enhance the specificity of PSA screening and decrease the number of unnecessary biopsies.

Recently, radiolabeled 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid (NODAGA)-peptide complexes have demonstrated improved in vivo stability and performance compared to their 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) counterparts. Here, we investigated if similar utility could be achieved with mAbs and compared (64)Cu-labeled DOTA and NODAGA-immunoconjugates for the detection of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in a prostate cancer model.  Methods:   DOTA and NODAGA-immunoconjugates of an EpCAM targeting mAb (mAb7) were synthesized and radiolabeled with (64)Cu (DOTA: 40°C for 1hr; NODAGA: 25°C for 1hr). The average number of chelators per mAb was quantified by isotopic dilution, and the biological activity of the immunoconjugates was evaluated by flow cytometry and ELISA. Radioligand assays were performed to compare cellular uptake and determine the dissociation constant (Kd) and maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) for the immunoconjugates using DsRed-transfected PC3-cells. A PC3-DsRed xenograft tumor model was established in nude mice and used to perform biodistribution studies to compare organ uptake and pharmacokinetics.  Results:   (64)Cu-DOTA-mAb7 and (64)Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 were prepared with chelator/protein ratios of 2-3 and obtained in comparable radiochemical yields ranging from 59 to 71%. Similar immunoreactivity was observed with both agents, and mock labeling studies indicated that incubation at room temperature or 40°C did not affect potency. (64)Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 demonstrated higher in vitro cellular uptake while (64)Cu-DOTA-mAb7 had higher Kd and Bmax values. From the biodistribution data, we found similar tumor uptake (13.44±1.21%ID/g and 13.24±4.86%ID/g for (64)Cu-DOTA-mAb7 and (64)Cu-NODAGA-mAb7, respectively) for both agents at 24hr, although normal prostate tissue was significantly lower for (64)Cu-NODAGA-mAb7. (64)Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 also had less accumulation in the liver, suggesting excellent retention of the chelation complex in vivo. This was further confirmed by the higher blood activity of (64)Cu-NODAGA-mAb7, which corresponds to increased bioavailability afforded by the enhanced in vivo stability of the agent. Although tumor/muscle ratios were comparable, tumor/prostate ratios were >2-fold and 1.5-fold higher for (64)Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 at 24 and 48hr, respectively, and suggest better ability to discriminate tumor tissue with (64)Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 in our prostate cancer model.  Conclusions:   To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first comparison of (64)Cu-labeled DOTA and NODAGA immunoconjugates in vivo. Our results show favorable in vivo performance for (64)Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 which builds upon previous data on our hybrid mAb7 imaging agent by increasing the detection sensitivity for metastatic prostate tumors, as well as for other types of cancer that express EpCAM.""","""['Sukhen C Ghosh', 'Kenneth L Pinkston', 'Holly Robinson', 'Barrett R Harvey', 'Nathaniel Wilganowski', 'Karen Gore', 'Eva M Sevick-Muraca', 'Ali Azhdarinia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['68Ga-labeling and in vivo evaluation of a uPAR binding DOTA- and NODAGA-conjugated peptide for PET imaging of invasive cancers.', 'PET of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors using 64Cu- and 68Ga-somatostatin antagonists: the chelate makes the difference.', 'Imaging cancer using PET--the effect of the bifunctional chelator on the biodistribution of a (64)Cu-labeled antibody.', '64Cu-Labeled 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-conjugated IRDye 800CW (a near-infrared fluorescence dye) coupled to mAb7, an anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule monoclonal antibody.', 'PET imaging of colorectal and breast cancer by targeting EphB4 receptor with 64Cu-labeled hAb47 and hAb131 antibodies.', 'Synthesis and In Vitro Comparison of DOTA, NODAGA and 15-5 Macrocycles as Chelators for the 64Cu-Labelling of Immunoconjugates.', 'The Chemical Scaffold of Theranostic Radiopharmaceuticals: Radionuclide, Bifunctional Chelator, and Pharmacokinetics Modifying Linker.', 'Development of a Stable Peptide-Based PET Tracer for Detecting CD133-Expressing Cancer Cells.', 'Spatio-temporal biodistribution of 89Zr-oxine labeled huLym-1-A-BB3z-CAR T-cells by PET imaging in a preclinical tumor model.', '64Cu-PSMA-BCH: a new radiotracer for delayed PET imaging of prostate cancer.']"""

We hypothesised that dexamethasone, another corticosteroid, is more active.  Objective:   To compare the activity of prednisolone and dexamethasone in CRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   This single-centre, randomised, phase 2 trial was performed in 82 men with chemotherapy-naïve CRPC enrolled from 2006 to 2010.  Intervention:   Prednisolone 5mg twice daily versus dexamethasone 0.5mg once daily versus intermittent dexamethasone 8mg twice daily on days 1-3 every 3 wk.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The main end point was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate. Secondary end points included time to PSA progression, radiologic response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), and safety.  Results and limitations:   The intermittent dexamethasone arm was dropped after no response was seen in seven patients. By intention to treat, confirmed PSA response was seen in 41% versus 22% for daily dexamethasone versus prednisolone, respectively (p=0.08). In evaluable patients, the PSA response rates were 47% versus 24% for dexamethasone and prednisolone, respectively (p=0.05). Median time to PSA progression was 9.7 mo on dexamethasone versus 5.1 mo on prednisolone (hazard ratio: 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-2.8). In 43 patients with measurable disease, the response rate by RECIST was 15% and 6% for dexamethasone and prednisolone, respectively (p=0.6). Of 23 patients who crossed over at PSA progression on prednisolone, 7 of the 19 evaluable (37%) had a confirmed PSA response to dexamethasone. Clinically significant toxicities were rare.  Conclusions:   Dexamethasone may be more active than prednisolone in CRPC. In the absence of more definitive trials, dexamethasone should be used in preference to prednisolone.  Patient summary:   We compared two different steroids used for treating men with advanced prostate cancer. Our results suggest that dexamethasone may be more effective than prednisolone and that both are well tolerated.

However, even if screening did not result in a clinically apparent lower stage or grade, it might still lead to less disease recurrence after treatment with curative intent (radical prostatectomy [RP] and radiation therapy [RT]) because the tumor had less time to develop outside the prostate. The outcome after treatment could also differ because of variations in treatment quality (eg, radiation dosage/adjuvant hormonal therapy). To test these hypotheses, we compared differences in the treatment quality of the screening and control arms of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Rotterdam and disease-free survival (DFS) after curative treatment in PCa patients with similar stage and grade. A total of 2595 men were initially treated with RP or RT. In the control arm, RT was more often combined with hormonal therapy; treatment dosage was often ≥69Gy. This most likely resulted from changes over time in treatment that coincided with the later detection in the control arm. DFS was higher in the screening arm in all risk groups. After correction for lead time, these differences were minimal, however. We concluded that treatment quality differed between the screening and control arms of the ERSPC Rotterdam. RT quality was especially superior in the control arm with higher dosages and more often RT in combination with hormonal therapy. Despite these differences favoring the control arm, DFS differences were minimal.  Patient summary:   We looked at differences in prostate cancer (PCa) treatment and outcome after PCa treatment in men diagnosed after screening and men diagnosed after normal clinical practice. Treatment differed with superior treatment given to men diagnosed in normal clinical practice. We propose a likely explanation for this apparently counterintuitive finding (progressive insight combined with, on average, a later detection of tumors in unscreened men). Although unscreened men received better treatment, this advantage seemed to be outweighed by the advantage associated with the earlier detection, on average, of the tumor in screened men.

It consists of two separated channel arrays: detection channel array and sensing channel array, which are connected by a group of parallel ITO BPEs on a glass substrate. Besides, two parallel ITO strips are fabricated at the two sides of BPE array and employed as driving electrodes. After Au films are electrochemically deposited on the cathodes of the BPE array, nanobioprobes including biorecognition elements (aptamer or antibody) and a novel electrochemical tag, which is synthesized by doping thionine in silica nanoparticles (Th@SiO2 NPs), are introduced into the cathodes by immunoreaction or DNA hybridization. The Th@SiO2 coupled nanobioprobes as both recognition probes and signal amplification indicators could mediate the ECL signals of Ru(bpy)3(2+)/tripropylamine (TPA) on the anodes of BPE array through faradaic reaction due to the charge neutrality of BPE. Thus, multiplex detection of cancer biomarkers (adenosine triphosphate (ATP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), α-fetoprotein (AFP) and thrombin) is realized by forming specific sensing interfaces onto the cathodic poles of BPEs in different sensing channels and reported by the ECL images of the Ru(bpy)3(2+)/TPA system on the anodic poles of BPEs in detection channels. The results demonstrate that this visual ECL platform enables sensitive detection with excellent reproducibility, which may open a new door toward the development of simple, sensitive, cost-effective, and high throughput detection methods on biochips.""","""['Mei-Sheng Wu', 'Zhen Liu', 'Hai-Wei Shi', 'Hong-Yuan Chen', 'Jing-Juan Xu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Sensitive electrochemiluminescence biosensor based on Au-ITO hybrid bipolar electrode amplification system for cell surface protein detection.', 'Electrochemiluminescence aptasensor based on bipolar electrode for detection of adenosine in cancer cells.', 'Direct Observation of Oxidation Reaction via Closed Bipolar Electrode-Anodic Electrochemiluminescence Protocol: Structural Property and Sensing Applications.', 'Generation of electrochemiluminescence at bipolar electrodes: concepts and applications.', 'Bipolar electrochemistry.', 'Recent advances in optical aptasensors for biomarkers in early diagnosis and prognosis monitoring of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Bipolar Electrode Arrays for Chemical Imaging and Multiplexed Sensing.', 'Confined Electrochemiluminescence Generation at Ultra-High-Density Gold Microwell Electrodes.', 'CRISPR/Cas13a Powered Portable Electrochemiluminescence Chip for Ultrasensitive and Specific MiRNA Detection.', 'Recent advances in optical aptasensor technology for amplification strategies in cancer diagnostics.']"""

Objective:   To provide clinical outcome data relating to a large cohort of mCRPC patients who received a third-line NA after the failure of docetaxel and another NA.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients who had received at least two successive NAs after the failure of docetaxel.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The independent prognostic value of a series of pretreatment covariates on the primary outcome measure of overall survival was assessed using Cox regression analysis.  Results and limitations:   We assessed 260 patients who received one third-line NA between January 2012 and December 2013, including 38 who received a further NA as fourth-line therapy. The median progression-free and overall survival from the start of third-line therapy was, respectively, 4 mo and 11 mo, with no significant differences between the NAs. Performance status, and haemoglobin and alkaline phosphatase levels were the only independent prognostic factors. The limitations of the study are mainly due its retrospective nature and the small number of patients treated with some of the sequences.  Conclusions:   We were unable to demonstrate a difference in the clinical outcomes of third-line NAs regardless of previous NA therapy.  Patient summary:   It is debated which sequence of treatments to adopt after docetaxel.

Objective:   We searched for predictors of urinary incontinence 1 yr after surgery among surgical steps during radical prostatectomy.  Design, setting, and participants:   More than 100 surgeons in 14 centers prospectively collected data on surgical steps during an open or robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. At 1 yr after surgery, a neutral third-party secretariat collected patient-reported information on urinary incontinence. After excluding men with preoperative urinary incontinence or postoperative irradiation, data were available for 3379 men.  Intervention:   Surgical steps during radical prostatectomy, including dissection plane as a measure of the degree of preservation of the two neurovascular bundles.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Urinary incontinence 1 yr after surgery was measured as patient-reported use of pads. In different categories of surgical steps, we calculated the percentage of men changing pads ""about once per 24 h"" or more often. Relative risks were calculated as percentage ratios between categories.  Results and limitations:   A strong association was found between the degree of bundle preservation and urinary incontinence 1 yr after surgery. We set the highest degree of bundle preservation (bilateral intrafascial dissection) as the reference category (relative risk = 1.0). For the men in the remaining six groups, ordered according to the degree of preservation, we obtained the following relative risks (95% confidence interval [CI]): 1.07 (0.63-1.83), 1.19 (0.77-1.85), 1.56 (0.99-2.45), 1.78 (1.13-2.81), 2.27 (1.45-3.53), and 2.37 (1.52-3.69). In the latter group, no preservation of any of the bundles was performed. The pattern was similar for preoperatively impotent men and for elderly men. Limitations of this analysis include the fact that noise influences the relative risks, due to variations between surgeons in the use of undocumented surgical steps of the procedure, variations in surgical experience and in how the surgical steps are reported, as well as variations in the metrics of patient-reported use of pads.  Conclusions:   We found that the degree of preservation of the two neurovascular bundles during radical prostatectomy predicts the rate of urinary incontinence 1 yr after the operation. According to our findings, preservation of both neurovascular bundles to avoid urinary incontinence is also meaningful for elderly and impotent men.  Patient summary:   We studied the degree of preservation of the two neurovascular bundles during radical prostatectomy and found that the risk of incontinence decreases if the surgeon preserves two bundles instead of one, and if the surgeon preserves some part of a bundle rather than not doing so.""","""['Gunnar Steineck', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Jonas Hugosson', 'Elin Axén', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Johan Stranne', 'Anna Wallerstedt', 'Josefin Persson', 'Ulrica Wilderäng', 'Thordis Thorsteinsdottir', 'Ove Gustafsson', 'Mikael Lagerkvist', 'Thomas Jiborn', 'Eva Haglind', 'Peter Wiklund;LAPPRO steering committee']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Gunnar Steineck, Anders Bjartell, Jonas Hugosson, et al.

Objective:   To examine the effect of pADT on mortality and to assess contemporary trends of pADT use in elderly men with CaP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men older than 65 yr residing in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry areas diagnosed with localized or locally advanced CaP between 1992 and 2009 and not receiving definitive therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Propensity score (PS)-weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effect of pADT use on overall survival among patients receiving pADT. The interaction between comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy (LE) and pADT use was assessed within the Cox and PS-weighted models. Contemporary (2004-2009) trends for pADT use were analyzed by linear regression.  Results and limitations:   The primary cohort included 46 376 men, of whom 17 873 received pADT (39%). Patients with >10 yr LE had lower pADT utilization rates than patients with short LE. Between 2004 and 2009, the use of pADT in men with localized CaP decreased by 14% (from 36% to 22%). Relative to observation, pADT was associated with a survival disadvantage, with a hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.20-1.56). Limitations included biases not accounted for by the PS-weighted model, changes in CaP staging over the study period, the absence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) data prior to 2004, and the limits of retrospective analysis to demonstrate causality.  Conclusions:   The use of pADT in elderly men with localized CaP has decreased over time. For men forgoing primary definitive therapy, the use of pADT is not associated with a survival benefit compared to observation, and denies men an opportunity for cure with definitive therapy. The deleterious effect of pADT is most pronounced in men with prolonged LE.  Patient summary:   In this report, we assessed the effect of primary androgen deprivation (pADT) on prostate cancer mortality and determined current trends in the use of pADT. We showed that use of pADT in men aged >65 yr with localized prostate cancer has decreased over time. We also found that pADT is detrimental to men with localized prostate cancer, and particularly men with longer life expectancy. Therefore, we conclude that ADT should not be used as a primary treatment for men with prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate.""","""['Jesse D Sammon', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Gally Reznor', 'Daniel Pucheril', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Jim C Hu', 'Simon P Kim', 'Marianne Schmid', 'Akshay Sood', 'Maxine Sun', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Mani Menon', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Androgen Deprivation Monotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Can It Be Justified?', 'Re: Patterns of declining use and the adverse effect of primary androgen deprivation on all-cause mortality in elderly men with prostate cancer.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy as primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: data from Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE).', 'Survival Outcomes in Octogenarian and Nonagenarian Patients Treated with First-line Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Organ-confined Prostate Cancer.', 'Effectiveness of primary androgen-deprivation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Trends in primary androgen depletion therapy for patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer: Japanese perspective.', 'Current trends for the use of androgen deprivation therapy in conjunction with radiotherapy for patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, localized, and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'A novel nomogram for predicting long-term heart-disease specific survival among older female primary breast cancer patients that underwent chemotherapy: A real-world data retrospective cohort study.', 'The 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT performance on metastasis status and therapy assessment in oligo-metastasis prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy in High-Risk Localized and Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Long-term outcomes of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer among Japanese men over 80\xa0years old.', 'Upfront metastasis-directed therapy in oligorecurrent prostate cancer does not decrease the time from initiation of androgen deprivation therapy to castration resistance.']"""

Methods:   Of all patients with prostate cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2009 in 7 participating hospitals in the Eindhoven region of the Netherlands Cancer Registry, 197 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were invited to fill in a questionnaire. Data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry were combined with questionnaire data (including European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire-C30, quality of life questionnaire-Prostate Module 25, and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire). Mean scores per margin status group were compared in multivariate linear regression.  Results:   Of the addressed patients, 166 (84%) responded to the questionnaire. At time of questioning, their surgery was 1.7 to 6.4 years ago. The prevalence of PSM was 34%. On most scales, patients with PSM reported more favorable scores than patients with negative surgical margins. However, differences were mostly trivial (<5 points on 100-point scales), or of small (5-10) to medium (10-20) clinical importance. Only differences on hormonal complaints and illness comprehensibility were statistically significant. Effect of PSM on scores did not vary between patients who were at different time points after surgery.  Conclusion:   Although patients with PSM showed a trend toward more favorable scores, these differences were of little or no clinical importance.

Methods:   The instrument's psychometric properties and performance were rated against established criteria for reliability (internal consistency), construct validity (instrument dimensionality) and variability (floor and ceiling effects).  Results:   Internal consistency reliability was satisfactory as evidenced by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 Dimensionality analysis confirmed a unidimensional structure indicating construct validity. A greater than 15% floor effect suggested limited data variability.  Conclusion:   The 17-item BFS seems to have satisfactory psychometric properties for use in an outpatient sample of men with prostate cancer, with some questions regarding detection of variability. The high internal consistency reliability points to the instruments ability to reliably capture the benefit finding construct in this population. The evidence for instrument dimensionality indicates a unidimensional scale, and thus a calculation of a single total score can be recommended. The >15% floor effect suggests that there may be issues with the instrument's ability to detect variance, and thus some questions remain regarding the instrument's ability to discern change in health status over time.

In this work, a liposomal drug delivery system conjugated with cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-tyrosine-lysine peptide (cRGDyk) as αvβ3 integrin ligand was thus developed to improve therapeutic efficacy in a mice model of bone metastasis from prostate cancer. The resultant liposomes were characterized in terms of size, morphology, zeta potential, stability, drug encapsulation percentage and loading efficiency, and drug release. Compared with free cisplatin and cRGDyk-free liposomes, cRGDyk conjugated liposomes showed significantly higher cellular uptake and higher cytotoxicity of loaded cisplatin, as evidenced by in vitro cell experiments. In vivo results revealed that free cisplatin and free cRGDyk could relieve tumor-induced pain but had no contributions to tumor regression and overall survival improvement. cRGDyk-free liposomal drug system with prolonged blood circulation time could accumulated in the tumor sites in the bone through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects and however, did not exhibit desirable therapeutic efficacy superior to free cisplatin and free cRGDyk. This strongly suggested that ERP effects were not effective in treating metastases. By taking advantages of targeted drug delivery and synergistic antitumor activity of cRGDyk and loaded cisplatin, cRGDyk conjugated liposomal drug system could inhibit osteoclastic and osteoblastic bone lesions, relieve pain, and improve overall survival.

We aimed to test combined genomic and microenvironmental indices in prostate cancer to improve risk stratification and complement clinical prognostic factors.  Methods:   We used DNA-based indices alone or in combination with intra-prostatic hypoxia measurements to develop four prognostic indices in 126 low-risk to intermediate-risk patients (Toronto cohort) who will receive image-guided radiotherapy. We validated these indices in two independent cohorts of 154 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center cohort [MSKCC] cohort) and 117 (Cambridge cohort) radical prostatectomy specimens from low-risk to high-risk patients. We applied unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to the copy-number profiles of 126 pre-image-guided radiotherapy diagnostic biopsies to develop prognostic signatures. Our primary endpoint was the development of a set of prognostic measures capable of stratifying patients for risk of biochemical relapse 5 years after primary treatment.  Findings:   Biochemical relapse was associated with indices of tumour hypoxia, genomic instability, and genomic subtypes based on multivariate analyses. We identified four genomic subtypes for prostate cancer, which had different 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival. Genomic instability is prognostic for relapse in both image-guided radiotherapy (multivariate analysis hazard ratio [HR] 4·5 [95% CI 2·1-9·8]; p=0·00013; area under the receiver operator curve [AUC] 0·70 [95% CI 0·65-0·76]) and radical prostatectomy (4·0 [1·6-9·7]; p=0·0024; AUC 0·57 [0·52-0·61]) patients with prostate cancer, and its effect is magnified by intratumoral hypoxia (3·8 [1·2-12]; p=0·019; AUC 0·67 [0·61-0·73]). A novel 100-loci DNA signature accurately classified treatment outcome in the MSKCC low-risk to intermediate-risk cohort (multivariate analysis HR 6·1 [95% CI 2·0-19]; p=0·0015; AUC 0·74 [95% CI 0·65-0·83]). In the independent MSKCC and Cambridge cohorts, this signature identified low-risk to high-risk patients who were most likely to fail treatment within 18 months (combined cohorts multivariate analysis HR 2·9 [95% CI 1·4-6·0]; p=0·0039; AUC 0·68 [95% CI 0·63-0·73]), and was better at predicting biochemical relapse than 23 previously published RNA signatures.  Interpretation:   This is the first study of cancer outcome to integrate DNA-based and microenvironment-based failure indices to predict patient outcome. Patients exhibiting these aggressive features after biopsy should be entered into treatment intensification trials.

Therefore, we undertook an unbiased analysis to identify RNA biomarkers associated with metastatic progression after prostatectomy.  Methods:   Prostate cancer samples from patients treated with radical prostatectomy at three academic institutions were analysed for gene expression by a high-density Affymetrix GeneChip platform, encompassing more than 1 million genomic loci. In a discovery cohort, all protein-coding genes and known long non-coding RNAs were ranked by fold change in expression between tumours that subsequently metastasised versus those that did not. The top ranked gene was then validated for its prognostic value for metastatic progression in three additional independent cohorts. 95% of the gene expression assays were done in a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments certified laboratory facility. All genes were assessed for their ability to predict metastatic progression by receiver-operating-curve area-under-the-curve analyses. Multivariate analyses were done for the primary endpoint of metastatic progression, with variables including Gleason score, preoperative prostate-specific antigen concentration, seminal vesicle invasion, surgical margin status, extracapsular extension, lymph node invasion, and expression of the highest ranked gene.  Findings:   1008 patients were included in the study: 545 in the discovery cohort and 463 in the validation cohorts. The long non-coding RNA SChLAP1 was identified as the highest-ranked overexpressed gene in cancers with metastatic progression. Validation in three independent cohorts confirmed the prognostic value of SChLAP1 for metastatic progression. On multivariate modelling, SChLAP1 expression (high vs low) independently predicted metastasis within 10 years (odds ratio [OR] 2·45, 95% CI 1·70-3·53; p<0·0001). The only other variable that independently predicted metastasis within 10 years was Gleason score (8-10 vs 5-7; OR 2·14, 95% CI 1·77-2·58; p<0·0001).  Interpretation:   We identified and validated high SChLAP1 expression as significantly prognostic for metastatic disease progression of prostate cancer. Our findings suggest that further development of SChLAP1 as a potential biomarker, for treatment intensification in aggressive prostate cancer, warrants future study.

Our objectives were to explore determinants of PSA-screening participation while simultaneously taking into account factors associated with FOBT. Data were gathered from a cross-sectional study conducted with random sampling of 6191 adults in Osaka city in 2011. Of 3244 subjects (return rate 52.4%), 936 men aged 40-64 years were analyzed using log-binomial regression to explore factors related to PSA-screening participation within 1 year. Only responders for cancer screening, defined as men who participated in either FOBT or PSA-testing, were used as main study subjects. Men who were older (prevalence ratio [PR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 2.17 [1.43, 3.28] for 60-64 years compared with 40-49 years), had technical or junior college education (PR [95% CI] = 1.76 [1.19, 2.59] compared with men with high school or less) and followed doctors' recommendations (PR [95% CI] = 1.50 [1.00, 2.26]) were significantly more likely to have PSA-screening after multiple variable adjustment among cancer-screening responders. Attenuation in PR of hypothesized common factors was observed among cancer-screening responders compared with the usual approach (among total subjects). Using the analytical framework to account for healthy-user bias, we found three factors related to participation in PSA-screening with attenuated association of common factors.

In the case of prostate cancer, one mechanism that contributes to αDG hypoglycosylation is transcriptional down-regulation of LARGE2 (GYLTY1B), a glycosyltransferase that produces the functional (laminin-binding) glycan on αDG, but the mechanism(s) underlying reduction of LARGE2 mRNA remain unclear. Here, we show that αDG hypoglycosylation is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like status. We examined immunoreactivity for both functionally-glycosylated αDG and E-cadherin by flow cytometry and the relative expression of ZEB1 mRNA and the αDG glycosyltransferase LARGE2 mRNA in prostate and other cancer cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR. To study the role of ZEB1 and other transcription factors in the regulation of LARGE2, we employed overexpression and knockdown approaches. Snail- or ZEB1-driven EMT caused αDG hypoglycosylation by repressing expression of the LARGE2 mRNA, with both ZEB1-dependent and -independent mechanisms contributing to Snail-mediated LARGE2 repression. To examine the direct regulation of LARGE2 by Snail and ZEB1 we employed luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Snail and ZEB1 were found to bind directly to the LARGE2 promoter, specifically to E/Z-box clusters. Furthermore, analysis of gene expression profiles of clinical samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas reveals negative correlation of LARGE2 and ZEB1 expression in various cancers. Collectively, our results suggest that LARGE2 is negatively regulated by Snail and/or ZEB1, revealing a mechanistic basis for αDG hypoglycosylation during prostate cancer progression and metastasis.""","""['Qin Huang', 'Michael R Miller', 'James Schappet', 'Michael D Henry']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Loss of LARGE2 disrupts functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan in prostate cancer.', 'Wnt-driven LARGE2 mediates laminin-adhesive O-glycosylation in human colonic epithelial cells and colorectal cancer.', 'Downregulation of dystroglycan glycosyltransferases LARGE2 and ISPD associate with increased mortality in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'The Transcription Factors Zeb1 and Snail Induce Cell Malignancy and Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype in Prostate Cells, Increasing Androgen Synthesis Capacity and Therapy Resistance.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'A novel glycosylation-related gene signature predicts survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Involvement of abnormal dystroglycan expression and matriglycan levels in cancer pathogenesis.', 'Identification of a Glycosyltransferase Signature for Predicting Prognosis and Immune Microenvironment in Neuroblastoma.', 'Differential DNA Methylation by Hispanic Ethnicity Among Firefighters in the United States.', 'Biosynthetic Mechanisms and Biological Significance of Glycerol Phosphate-Containing Glycan in Mammals.']"""

Methods:   Within the most recent Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database we identified clinically non-metastatic, muscle-invasive (T2-T4a) urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder (UCUB) patients, who underwent RC between 1991 and 2009. Mortality at 30- and 90-day after RC was quantified. Multivariable logistic regression analyses tested predictors of 90-day mortality.  Results:   Within 5207 assessable RC patients 30- and 90-day mortality rates were 5.2 and 10.6%, respectively. According to age 65-69, 70-79 and ≥ 80 years, 90-day mortality rates were 6.4, 10.1 and 14.8% (p < 0.001). Additionally, 90-day mortality rates increased with increasing Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI, 0, 1, 2 and ≥ 3): 6.3, 10.3, 12.6 and 15.9% (p < 0.001). 90-day mortality rate in unmarried patients was 13.0 vs. 9.3% in married individuals (p < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, advanced age, higher CCI, low socioeconomic status, unmarried status and non organ-confined stage were independent predictors of 90-day mortality (all p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   The contemporary SEER-Medicare derived 90-day mortality rates are substantially higher than previously reported estimates from centers of excellence, and even exceed previous SEER reports.

Preclinical evidence suggests that activation of PI3K/AKT signaling through loss of PTEN can result in resistance to hormonal treatment in prostate cancer.  Objective:   To explore the antitumor activity of abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients with and without loss of PTEN protein expression.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively identified patients who had received abiraterone and had hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) and/or CRPC tissue available for PTEN immunohistochemical analysis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was overall survival from initiation of abiraterone treatment. Relationship with outcome was analyzed using multivariate Cox regression and log-rank analyses.  Results and limitations:   A total of 144 patients were identified who had received abiraterone post-docetaxel and had available tumor tissue. Overall, loss of PTEN expression was observed in 40% of patients. Matched HSPC and CRPC tumor biopsies were available for 41 patients. PTEN status in CRPC correlated with HSPC in 86% of cases. Loss of PTEN expression was associated with shorter median overall survival (14 vs 21 mo; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.55; p=0.004) and shorter median duration of abiraterone treatment (24 vs 28 wk; HR: 1.6; 95% CI, 1.12-2.28; p=0.009). PTEN protein loss, high lactate dehydrogenase, and the presence of visceral metastases were identified as independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that loss of PTEN expression was associated with worse survival and shorter time on abiraterone treatment. Further studies in larger and prospective cohorts are warranted.  Patient summary:   PTEN is a protein often lost in prostate cancer cells. In this study we evaluated if prostate cancers that lack this protein respond differently to treatment with abiraterone acetate.

The unmet support needs of these men are well documented, and access to psychosocial support remains problematic.  Objectives:   To assess the efficacy of an online psychological intervention for men who have localised PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   We undertook a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the intervention. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: My Road Ahead (MRA) alone (MRA Only), MRA plus access to an online forum (MRA+Forum), and access to the forum alone (Forum).  Intervention:   The intervention was a 10-week self-guided online psychological intervention called My Road Ahead that consisted of six themed modules designed to facilitate improved emotional well-being in the context of PCa as well as a moderated peer forum.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Pre- and postintervention assessments of psychological distress (the 21-question Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale) [1] and the Prostate Cancer-related Quality of Life scale [2] were conducted. Multivariate analysis of variance, regression, and structural equation modelling were used to analyse the data.  Results and limitations:   In total, 142 participants were randomly allocated to one of the three intervention arms. The mean age of participants was 61 yr of age (standard deviation: 7), and 88% had undergone radical prostatectomy. A significant improvement in psychological distress was observed for participants who had access to the combined condition (MRA+Forum) with a moderate effect size (p=0.02; partial η(2)=0.07). In particular, the decline in the mean level of psychological distress was 8.8 units larger for the MRA+Forum group than the Forum group (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-16.7). Although the decline in the mean level of psychological distress was 7.0 units larger for the MRA+Forum group than for the MRA Only group, this difference was not significant (95% CI, 1.1-15.1). Structural equation modelling indicated that reductions in health worry and regret contributed significantly to the reductions in psychological distress for the MRA+Forum condition.  Conclusions:   This study is the first, to our knowledge, that has evaluated a self-guided online psychological intervention tailored to the specific needs of men who have PCa.

Objective:   To evaluate the response of BRCA carriers to conventional treatments for localised PCa by analysing metastasis-free survival (MFS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) following radical prostatectomy (RP) or external-beam radiation therapy (RT).  Design, setting, and participants:   Tumour features and outcomes of 1302 patients with local/locally advanced PCa (including 67 BRCA mutation carriers) were analysed. RP was undergone by 535 patients (35 BRCA); 767 received RT (32 BRCA). Median follow-up was 64 mo.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Median survival and 3-, 5-, and 10-yr survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Generated survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Cox regression analyses were used to assess the prognostic value of BRCA mutations.  Results and limitations:   A total of 67 BRCA carriers and 1235 noncarriers were included. At 3, 5, and 10 yr after treatment, 97%, 94%, and 84% of noncarriers and 90%, 72%, and 50% of carriers were free from metastasis (p<0.001).

However, their continuous release into the environment is a concern as they are often persistent, bioaccumulating and toxic. Information on the impact these compounds have on human health and wildlife is limited and only a few of them have been identified to disrupt hormone receptor functions. In the present study we used in silico modeling to determine the interactions of selected BFRs with the human androgen receptor (AR). Three compounds were found to dock into the ligand-binding domain of the human AR and these were further tested using in vitro analysis. Allyl 2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (ATE), 2-bromoallyl 2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (BATE) and 2,3-dibromopropyl-2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (DPTE) were observed to act as AR antagonists. These BFRs have recently been detected in the environment, in house dust and in aquatic animals. The compounds have been detected at high concentrations in both blubber and brain of seals and we therefore also assessed their impact on the expression of L-type amino acid transporter system (LAT) genes, that are needed for amino acid uptake across the blood-brain barrier, as disruption of LAT gene function has been implicated in several brain disorders. The three BFRs down-regulated the expression of AR target genes that encode for prostate specific antigen (PSA), 5α-reductases and β-microseminoprotein. The potency of PSA inhibition was of the same magnitude as the common prostate cancer drugs, demonstrating that these compounds are strong AR antagonists. Western blot analysis of AR protein showed that ATE, BATE and DPTE decreased the 5α-dihydrotestosterone-induced AR protein levels, further confirming that these BFRs act as AR antagonists. The transcription of the LAT genes was altered by the three BFRs, indicating an effect on amino-acid uptake across cellular membranes and blood-brain barrier. This study demonstrated that ATE, BATE and DPTE are potent AR antagonists and the alterations in LAT gene transcription suggest that these compounds can affect neuronal functions and should be considered as potential neurotoxic and endocrine disrupting compounds.""","""['Joubert Banjop Kharlyngdoh', 'Ajay Pradhan', 'Solomon Asnake', 'Anders Walstad', 'Per Ivarsson', 'Per-Erik Olsson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Environ Int""","""['Androgen receptor modulation following combination exposure to brominated flame-retardants.', 'In silico and biological analysis of anti-androgen activity of the brominated flame retardants ATE, BATE and DPTE in zebrafish.', 'The brominated flame retardants TBP-AE and TBP-DBPE antagonize the chicken androgen receptor and act as potential endocrine disrupters in chicken LMH cells.', 'Are brominated flame retardants endocrine disruptors?', 'New insights into the endocrine disrupting effects of brominated flame retardants.', 'In Vitro characterization of the endocrine disrupting effects of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) on the human androgen receptor.', 'Androgen receptor modulation following combination exposure to brominated flame-retardants.', 'A Rat α-Fetoprotein Binding Activity Prediction Model to Facilitate Assessment of the Endocrine Disruption Potential of Environmental Chemicals.', 'Evaluation and characterization of anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic activities in soil samples along the Second Songhua River, China.']"""

In general, antigen expression directly affects the bioactivity of therapeutic antibodies, and the biologic regulation of STEAP1 is unusually complicated in PCa. Paradoxically, STEAP1 can be induced or repressed by the androgen receptor (AR) in different human PCa models, while also expressed in AR-null PCa. Consequently, there is an urgent need to translate diagnostic strategies to establish which regulatory mechanism predominates in patients to situate the appropriate therapy within standard of care therapies inhibiting AR.  Methods:   To this end, we prepared and evaluated (89)Zr-labeled MSTP2109A ((89)Zr-2109A), a radiotracer for PET derived from a fully humanized monoclonal antibody to STEAP1 in preclinical PCa models.

However, the role of germline variations at the UGT1 locus, encoding half of all human UGTs and primarily involved in estrogen metabolism, remains unexplored. We investigated whether variants of UGT1 are potential prognostic markers. We studied 526 Caucasian men who underwent RP for clinically localized PCa. Genotypes of patients for 34 haplotype-tagged single-nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) and 11 additional SNPs across the UGT1 locus previously reported to mark common variants including functional polymorphisms were determined. The risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) was estimated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. We further investigated whether variants are associated with plasma hormone levels by mass spectrometry. In multivariable models, seven htSNPs were found to be significantly associated with BCR. A greater risk was revealed for four UGT1 intronic variants with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.59-1.88 (P<0.002) for htSNPs in UGT1A10, UGT1A9, and UGT1A6. Conversely, decreased BCR was associated with three htSNPs in introns of UGT1A10 and UGT1A9 (HR=0.56-058; P≤0.01). An unfavorable UGT1 haplotype comprising all risk alleles, with a frequency of 14%, had a HR of 1.68 (95% CI=1.13-2.50; P=0.011). Significant alteration in circulating androsterone levels was associated with this haplotype, consistent with changes in hormonal exposure.

Assessment of risk is opportunistically undertaken in consultation with the GP or urologist. Evaluation of the prostate gland consists of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum level and a digital rectal examination (DRE) of the gland. DRE is an essential part of the assessment that can independently predict prostate cancer in the setting of a normal PSA level.  Aim:   To evaluate the clinical usefulness of the DRE in general practice and urology clinics, and to ascertain its positive predictive value and sensitivity.  Design and setting:   A retrospective analysis study of a cohort of Irish men who underwent TRUS guided biopsy of the prostate in a single Irish tertiary referral centre, despite a normal PSA level. Patients were identified from a Rapid Access Prostate Clinic patient database. Pathological biopsy results were correlated with clinical DRE findings.  Method:   Patient demographics, PSA levels, and DRE findings from a prospectively established database and hospital data systems from May 2009 to October 2013 were analysed.  Results:   Of 103 men referred over a 53-month period with a normal age-adjusted PSA level, 67% were referred on the basis of an abnormal DRE alone. Thirty-five per cent of males with a normal PSA had prostate cancer. DRE alone had a sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 40% respectively in diagnosing prostate cancer, with a positive predictive value of 42%. Seventy-six per cent of these men had high-grade disease.  Conclusion:   DRE is a key part of the assessment for prostate cancer. It can independently identify patients at risk of prostate cancer, with a substantial proportion of these having clinically significant disease requiring treatment. This study reinforces the importance of DRE in the primary care setting in the assessment for prostate cancer. An abnormal DRE, even in the setting of a normal PSA level, necessitates referral.""","""['Anna Lucy Walsh', 'Shane W Considine', 'Arun Z Thomas', 'Thomas H Lynch', 'Rustom P Manecksha']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Gen Pract""","""['Digital rectal examination can detect early prostate cancer.', 'The digital rectal examination (DRE) remains important - outcomes from a contemporary cohort of men undergoing an initial 12-18 core prostate needle biopsy.', 'The role of the digital rectal examination as diagnostic test for prostate cancer detection in obese patients.', 'An evaluation of usefulness of prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in an unscreened population:experience in a Nigerian teaching hospital.', 'Social ecological predictors of prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal examination in black American men.', 'Digital Rectal Examination for Prostate Cancer Screening in Primary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Design of a printed electrochemical strip towards miRNA-21 detection in urine samples: optimization of the experimental procedures for real sample application.', 'Accurate prostate cancer detection based on enrichment and characterization of prostate cancer specific circulating tumor cells.', 'Does a screening digital rectal exam provide actionable clinical utility in patients with an elevated PSA and positive MRI?', 'How to Improve TRUS-Guided Target Biopsy following Prostate MRI.', 'Miniaturized optical fiber probe for prostate cancer screening.']"""

The addition of real-time elastography promises to increase the precision of the outcome of targeted biopsies. We investigated whether real-time elastography improves magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy in patients after previous negative biopsies.  Materials and methods:   Prospectively 121 men underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Using magnetic resonance imaging/real-time elastography fusion every suspicious lesion was characterized according to its tissue density and sampled by 2 fusion guided targeted biopsies. Additionally, all patients underwent 12-core systematic biopsy. The detection rate of clinically significant and insignificant cancers was compared between targeted und systematic biopsies. The accuracy to predict high grade prostate cancer was evaluated for with the PI-RADS scoring system and compared to the magnetic resonance imaging/real-time elastography fusion score.  Results:   Overall prostate cancer was detected in 52 patients (43%). Targeted fusion guided biopsy revealed prostate cancer in 32 men (26.4%) and systematic biopsy in 46 (38%). The proportion of clinically significant cancers was higher for targeted biopsy (90.6%) compared to systematic biopsy (73.9%). The detection rate per core was higher for targeted biopsies (14.7%) compared to systematic biopsies (6.5%, p <0.001).

In this paper, we compare the Hirata-Bruchovsky-Aihara model with the Portz-Kuang-Nagy model, two recently proposed models for intermittent androgen suppression. We fitted these mathematical models to the actual data of 17 patients and examined the dynamical behavior and prediction accuracy of these models.

Importantly, we observe that in human hyperplastic and cancerous prostate glands PIM1 is also markedly elevated in prostate fibroblasts, suggesting an important role for this kinase in epithelial/stromal crosstalk. The ability of PIM1 to regulate the biologic activity of stromal cells is demonstrated by the observation that expression of PIM1 kinase in human prostate fibroblasts increases the level and secretion of the extracellular matrix molecule, collagen 1A1 (COL1A1), the pro-inflammatory chemokine CCL5, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR). PIM1 is found to regulate the transcription of CCL5. In co-cultivation assays where PIM1 over-expressing fibroblasts are grown with BPH1 prostate epithelial cells, PIM1 activity markedly enhances the ability of these fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts and express known markers of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This differentiation can be reversed by the addition of small molecule PIM kinase inhibitors. Western blots demonstrate that PIM1 expression in prostate fibroblasts stimulates the phosphorylation of molecules that regulate 5'Cap driven protein translation, including 4EBP1 and eIF4B.

However, available evidence in prostate cancer is conflicting. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the role of circulating adiponectin and prostate cancer.  Methods and results:   An extensive search was performed on Google, PubMed, Elsevier Science and Springer from the date of the inception of those services to December 2013. Eleven studies with 2,504 patients and 3,565 controls concerning this association were included in our analysis. Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) was used to estimate this association. The pooled analysis showed that circulating adiponectin concentrations were lower in patients with prostate cancer than controls, with a pooled SMD of -0.893 μg/mL (95% CI, -1.345 to -0.440, p=0.000). Dose-response relationships between concentrations of adiponectin and risk of prostate cancer were evaluated. We found that decreased concentrations of adiponectin were associated with a significantly greater risk of prostate cancer (p for nonlinearity = 0.043).  Conclusions:   The results of our analysis indicated that concentration of adiponectin in cancer patients was significantly lower than in controls. Thus, adiponectin may serve as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of this disease. We also found that decreased concentration of adiponectin was associated with a significantly greater risk of prostate cancer. However, more studies in future, especially larger, prospective studies, are needed to confirm this association with underlying biological mechanisms.""","""['Qiaofang Liao', 'Chan Long', 'Zhuojuan Deng', 'Xiaoxia Bi', 'Jun Hu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Biol Markers""","""['Circulating adiponectin levels in various malignancies: an updated meta-analysis of 107 studies.', 'Circulating adiponectin levels and the risk of breast cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Circulating adiponectin and risk of endometrial cancer.', 'No association of plasma levels of adiponectin and c-peptide with risk of aggressive prostate cancer in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort.', 'Circulating adiponectin and leptin and risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Adipokines as Clinically Relevant Therapeutic Targets in Obesity.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Icaritin reduces prostate cancer progression via inhibiting high-fat diet-induced serum adipokine in TRAMP mice model.', 'Adipocytokines: Are they the Theory of Everything?', 'Prognostic biomarkers in renal cell carcinoma: is there a relationship with obesity?']"""

The RNA aptamer-conjugated liposome, termed an aptamosome, was prepared by the post-insertion method, in which RNA aptamer-conjugated micelles were inserted into a liposome. These nanosized (90-100 nm) aptamer-conjugated liposomes specifically bind to LNCaP prostate epithelial cells that express PSMA and thus cause the nanoparticles to have significantly enhanced in vitro cellular binding and uptake as compared with nontargeted nanoparticles that lack the PSMA aptamer. Aptamosomes encapsulated with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) were significantly more toxic to the targeted LNCaP cells than to nontargeted cancer cells. Dox-encapsulating aptamosomes administered to LNCaP xenograft nude mice were selectively retained in tumor tissue. We also demonstrated in vivo anticancer efficacy of the Dox-encapsulating PSMA-aptamosomes on tumor size regression in LNCaP xenograft mice.

The mechanisms regulating the metastatic process confer changes to cell adhesion receptors including the integrin family of receptors. Our group previously discovered that the α6 integrin (ITGA6/CD49f) is post translationally modified by urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), to form the variant ITGA6p. This variant of ITGA6 is a cleaved form of the receptor that lacks the ligand-binding domain. Although it is established that the uPA/uPAR axis drives ITGA6 cleavage, the mechanisms regulating cleavage have not been defined. Intracellular integrin dependent ""inside-out"" signaling is a major regulator of integrin function and the uPA/uPAR axis. We hypothesized that intracellular signaling molecules play a role in formation of ITGA6p to promote cell migration during cancer metastasis. In order to test our hypothesis, DU145 and PC3B1 prostate cancer and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were treated with small interfering RNA targeting actin and the intracellular signaling regulators focal adhesion kinase (FAK), integrin linked kinase (ILK), and paxillin. The results demonstrated that inhibition of actin, FAK, and ILK expression resulted in significantly increased uPAR expression and ITGA6p production. Inhibition of actin increased ITGA6p, although inhibition of paxillin did not affect ITGA6p formation. Taken together, these results suggest that FAK and ILK dependent ""inside-out"" signaling, and actin dynamics regulate extracellular production of ITGA6p and the aggressive phenotype.""","""['Apollo D Kacsinta', 'Cynthia S Rubenstein', 'Isis C Sroka', 'Sangita Pawar', 'Jaime M Gard', 'Raymond B Nagle', 'Anne E Cress']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Suppression of uPAR retards radiation-induced invasion and migration mediated by integrin β1/FAK signaling in medulloblastoma.', 'RNA interference-directed knockdown of urokinase plasminogen activator and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor inhibits prostate cancer cell invasion, survival, and tumorigenicity in vivo.', 'Interleukin-1alpha enhances the aggressive behavior of pancreatic cancer cells by regulating the alpha6beta1-integrin and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor expression.', 'Focal adhesion kinase controls prostate cancer progression via intrinsic kinase and scaffolding functions.', 'The focal adhesion protein Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK) as an important player in breast cancer pathogenesis.', 'Live-cell phenotypic-biomarker microfluidic assay for the risk stratification of cancer patients via machine learning.', 'Cancer Stem Cell Metabolism and Potential Therapeutic Targets.', 'PSMC2 is up-regulated in osteosarcoma and regulates osteosarcoma cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration.', 'Penfluridol Represses Integrin Expression in Breast Cancer through Induction of Reactive Oxygen Species and Downregulation of Sp Transcription Factors.', 'Laminin-binding integrin gene copy number alterations in distinct epithelial-type cancers.']"""

In this study we evaluated the pattern of adverse pathologic features in an identical cohort of African-American (AA) and Caucasian (CS) men with PCa.  Patients and methods:   The overall cohort consisted of 1104 men (224 AA, and 880 CS) who underwent RP between 1990 and 2012. We compared preoperative factors and pathologic outcomes after RP across race groups. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors predictive of adverse pathologic outcomes. The effect of race on adverse pathologic outcomes and biochemical control rate (BCR) was evaluated using multivariate regression model and Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results:   The 10-year BCR was 59% versus 82% in AA and CS men, respectively (P = .003). There was no significant difference in extraprostatic spread (P = .14), positive surgical margin (P = .81), lymph node involvement (P = .71), or adverse pathologic features (P = .16) across race groups. However, among patients with ≥ 1 adverse pathologic features, AA men had higher rate of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) compared with CS men (51% vs. 30%; P = .01). After adjusting for known predictors of adverse pathologic features AA race remained a predictor of SVI.  Conclusion:   AA men have an increased risk of SVI after RP, particularly among men with Gleason ≤ 6 disease. This might represent racial differences in the biology of PCa disease progression, which contribute to poorer outcomes in AA men.""","""['Kosj Yamoah', 'Amy Walker', 'Elaine Spangler', 'Charnita M Zeigler-Johnson', 'Bruce Malkowicz', 'David I Lee', 'Adam P Dicker', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Priti Lal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['African American men with low-grade prostate cancer have increased disease recurrence after prostatectomy compared with Caucasian men.', 'Multivariate analysis of race and adverse pathologic findings after radical prostatectomy.', 'Race is not an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in an equal access medical center.', 'Is active surveillance a suitable option for African American men with prostate cancer?

Moreover, recent reports have involved Id1 in the maintenance of cancer stem cell features in some tumor types. The Id1 gene generates two isoforms through alternative splicing: Id1a and Id1b. We have investigated the role of each isoform in cancer development. Using lentiviral systems we modified the endogenous expression of each of these isoforms in cancer cells and analyzed their biological effect both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of Id1b in murine CT26 and 3LL cells caused a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and reduced proliferation, clonogenicity and phospho-ERK1/2 levels, while increasing p27 levels. High levels of Id1a had an opposite effect and the proportion of cells in the S phase increased significantly. In vivo models confirmed the inhibitory role of Id1b in primary tumor growth and metastasis. Through microarray analysis we found that the cancer stem cell (CSC) markers ALDH1A1 and Notch-1 were up-regulated specifically in Id1b-overexpressing cells. By using qPCR we also found overexpression of Sca-1, Tert, Sox-2 and Oct-4 in these cells. Increased levels of Id1b promoted self-renewal and CSC-like properties, as shown by their high capacity for developing secondary tumorspheres and retaining the PKH26 dye. The acquisition of CSC phenotype was confirmed in human PC-3 cells that overexpressed Id1b.

However, MET protein expression and HGF secretion were not affected by SAHA, suggesting that the SAHA-induced MET activation was not due to MET over-expression or HGF paracrine secretion. However, mRNA and protein expression of the laminin receptor integrin α5β1 was up-regulated by SAHA prior to MET activation. Silencing of integrin α5β1 abolished SAHA-triggered MET phosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of integrin α5β1 in MET activation. Further, the combination of SAHA and XL184 resulted in a synergistic induction of cancer cell apoptosis and a synergistic inhibition of tumor growth.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been found to be an effective treatment for HFNS in women, but cognitions and behavioural reactions to HFNS in men are under-researched. This study describes the development of the HFNS beliefs and behaviour scale for men.  Methods:   HFNS beliefs and behaviour items were generated from a qualitative study, from pilot interviews with men with prostate cancer and HFNS, and from scales used for women. 118 men with prostate cancer, aged above 18, English-speaking, who had minimum of seven HFNS weekly for at least 1 month, completed the initial measure, and measures of HFNS frequency, problem rating, anxiety and depression (HADS). Principal components analyses with orthogonal rotation determined the most coherent solution.  Results:   Exploratory factor analysis culminated in a 17-item HFNS beliefs and behaviour scale for men (HFBBS-Men) with three subscales: (1) HFNS social context and sleep, (2) Calm/Acceptance, (3) Humour/Openness. The subscales had reasonable internal consistency (Cronbach alpha 0.56-0.83).

Uroplakin II (UPII) is a newly described sensitive marker for urothelial carcinoma (UC). The expression profile of UPII in different types of UC and its utility in the diagnostic setting are needed. We evaluated UPII expression in bladder tissue microarrays, including urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (n = 8), low-grade papillary UC (n = 72), noninvasive high-grade papillary UC (n = 77), UC in situ (n = 27), and invasive high-grade UC (INVUC) (n = 122). UPII expression in 52 breast carcinomas and 38 high-grade prostate adenocarcinomas was also assessed. UPII expression was compared with GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) and estrogen receptor for its role in facilitating the differential diagnosis of the above 3 types of malignancy. UPII labeling was seen in 83.0% of UC overall, including 95.7% of noninvasive UC and 65.6% of INVUC. UPII labeling was not found in any breast and prostate carcinomas. In comparison, GATA3 labeling was seen in 91.6% of all UCs, including 96.4% of noninvasive UCs and 85.1% of INVUC, with stronger intensity and extent compared with UPII (P < .005). GATA3 labeled 2 (5%) of 38 high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma. Estrogen receptor nuclear labeling was seen in 13.0% of UCs and 12.5% of prostate carcinomas.

Objective:   To evaluate the prognostic value of multiple parameters in men with bone metastases due to CRPC using a contemporary dataset.  Design, setting, and participants:   The analysis included 1901 patients with metastatic CRPC enrolled in an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial conducted between May 2006 and October 2009.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   We developed multivariate validated Cox proportional hazards models and nomograms to estimate 12-mo and 24-mo survival probabilities and median survival time.  Results and limitations:   The median (95% confidence interval) overall survival was 20 (18, 21) mo. The final model included 12 of the 15 potential prognostic variables evaluated (concordance index 0.72). Seven bone-related variables were associated with longer survival in the final model: alkaline phosphatase ≤143 U/l (p<0.0001); bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) <146 U/l (p<0.0001); corrected urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) ≤50 nmol/mmol (p=0.0008); mild or no pain (Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form [BPI-SF] score ≤4) (p<0.0001); no previous skeletal-related event (SRE; p=0.0002); longer time from initial diagnosis to first bone metastasis (p<0.0001); and longer time from first bone metastasis to randomization (p<0.0001). Other significant predictors of improved survival included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level <10 ng/ml (p<0.0001), hemoglobin >128g/l (p<0.0001), absence of visceral metastases (p<0.0001), Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) score ≤1 (p=0.017), and younger age (p=0.008). Nomograms were generated based on the parameters included in the final validated models (with/without uNTx and BSAP). One limitation was that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, a known prognostic factor, were not available in this study.  Conclusions:   Bone-related parameters are strong prognostic variables for overall survival in patients with bone metastases from CRPC.

Furthermore, the conformational spaces of the compounds were scanned with molecular mechanics method. The geometry optimization, HOMO and LUMO energies, the energy gap of the HOMO-LUMO, dipole moment of the compounds were theoretically calculated by the density functional theory B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level.

Methods:   We searched Pubmed for articles dated before August 16, 2013. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) a cohort or observational study; (2) PM or DM as one of the exposures of interest; (3) cancer as an outcome of interest; and (4) the rate ratio (RR) or standardized incidence ratio (SIR) were available with their 95% CI. We used random-effects or fixed-effects models to calculate the pooled RR according to the heterogeneity test.  Results:   Twenty publications were included. Compared with the general population, the pooled RR for patients with PM, DM, and PM/DM were 1.62 (95% CI 1.19-2.04), 5.50 (4.31-6.70), and 4.07 (3.02-5.12), respectively. The increased risks were more significant in patients within the first year of myositis diagnosis, male patients, and population-based studies (for DM). A significant association was also found between PM or DM and most site-specific malignancies. However, both PM and DM were not associated with stomach and prostate cancers. Significant heterogeneity was found between studies on association between PM/DM and overall malignancy, but not between PM/DM and the majority of site-specific malignancies, suggesting that that inherent malignancy difference may be a major source of heterogeneity.  Conclusion:   The present metaanalysis indicates that PM and DM are significantly associated with increased risks of overall malignancy and most site-specific malignancies. The number of studies on association between PM or DM and some malignancies is too small to draw a firm conclusion.

Material and methods:   We evaluated 4 patients with prostate cancer presenting sentinel nodes in the pararectal and presacral regions on SPECT-CT scan performed in addition to lymphoscintigraphy. These patients underwent lymphadenectomy with robot-assisted laparoscopy together with prostatectomy. All of the excised lymph nodes were sent for histopathology study.

Although progress has been made regarding chemotherapeutic agents, new therapies that combine increased selectivity and efficacy with low resistance are still needed. In the search for new anticancer agents, therapies based on biologically active peptides, in particular, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), have attracted attention for their decreased resistance development and low cytotoxicity. Many AMPs have proved to be tumoricidal agents against human cancer cells, but their mode of action is still controversial. The existence of common properties shared by the membranes of bacteria and tumor cells points to similar lipid-targeting mechanisms in both cases. On the other hand, anticancer peptides (ACPs) also induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis. Human neutrophil peptide-1 (HNP-1) is an endogenous AMP that has been implicated in different cellular phenomena such as tumor proliferation. The presence of HNP-1 in the serum/plasma of oncologic patients turns this peptide into a potential tumor biomarker. The present work reveals the different effects of HNP-1 on the biophysical and nanomechanical properties of solid and hematological tumor cells. Studies on cellular morphology, cellular stiffness, and membrane ultrastructure and charge using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and zeta potential measurements show a preferential binding of HNP-1 to solid tumor cells from human prostate adenocarcinoma when compared to human leukemia cells. AFM also reveals induction of apoptosis with cellular membrane defects at very low peptide concentrations.

We reported earlier that resveratrol, a dietary stilbene found in grapes, can down-regulate MTA1. In the present study, we show that PTEN is inactivated by MTA1 in prostate cancer cells. Further, we show that resveratrol promotes acetylation and reactivation of PTEN via inhibition of the MTA1/HDAC complex, resulting in inhibition of the Akt pathway. In addition, we show that MTA1 knockdown is sufficient to augment acetylation of PTEN indicating a crucial role of MTA1 itself in the regulation of PTEN acetylation contributing to its lipid phosphatase activity. Acetylated PTEN preferentially accumulates in the nucleus where it binds to MTA1. We also show that MTA1 interacts exclusively with PTEN acetylated on Lys¹²⁵ and Lys¹²⁸, resulting in diminished p-Akt levels. Finally, using orthotopic prostate cancer xenografts, we demonstrate that both resveratrol treatment and MTA1 knockdown enhance PTEN levels leading to a decreased p-Akt expression and proliferation index. Taken together, our results indicate that MTA1/HDAC unit is a negative regulator of PTEN which facilitates survival pathways and progression of prostate cancer and that resveratrol can reverse this process through its MTA1 inhibitory function.""","""['Swati Dhar', 'Avinash Kumar', 'Kun Li', 'Guri Tzivion', 'Anait S Levenson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Resveratrol enhances p53 acetylation and apoptosis in prostate cancer by inhibiting MTA1/NuRD complex.', 'Pterostilbene inhibits MTA1/HDAC1 complex leading to PTEN acetylation in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Pterostilbene acts through metastasis-associated protein 1 to inhibit tumor growth, progression and metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'MTA family of proteins in prostate cancer: biology, significance, and therapeutic opportunities.', 'The role of the MTA family and their encoded proteins in human cancers: molecular functions and clinical implications.', 'Inhibition of Cancer Development by Natural Plant Polyphenols: Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Metabolo-epigenetic interplay provides targeted nutritional interventions in chronic diseases and ageing.', 'Gnetin C Intercepts MTA1-Associated Neoplastic Progression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Polyphenols as Potent Epigenetics Agents for Cancer.', 'Disease-associated regulation of gene expression by resveratrol: Special focus on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.']"""

New methods performing inverse optimization of the dose distribution have been developed over the past years. The purpose is to compare GrO and two established inverse methods, inverse planning simulated annealing (IPSA) and hybrid inverse treatment planning and optimization (HIPO), and one new method, enhanced geometric optimization-interactive inverse planning (EGO-IIP), in terms of speed and dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters.  Methods and materials:   For 26 prostate cancer patients treated with a PDR brachytherapy boost, an experienced treatment planner optimized the dose distributions using four different methods: GrO, IPSA, HIPO, and EGO-IIP. Relevant DVH parameters (prostate-V100%, D90%, V150%; urethra-D(0.1cm3) and D(1.0cm3); rectum-D(0.1cm3) and D(2.0cm3); bladder-D(2.0cm3)) were evaluated and their compliance to the constraints. Treatment planning time was also recorded.  Results:   All inverse methods resulted in shorter planning time (mean, 4-6.7 min), as compared with GrO (mean, 7.6 min). In terms of DVH parameters, none of the inverse methods outperformed the others. However, all inverse methods improved on compliance to the planning constraints as compared with GrO.

Focal adhesions (FAs) are integrin-based adhesion complexes that form the link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and are thought to orchestrate cell migration. Understanding the regulation of FAs by (oncogenic) signaling pathways may identify strategies to target pathological cell migration. Here we describe the development of a robust FA tracker that enables the automatic, multi-parametric analysis of FA dynamics, morphology and composition from time-lapse image series generated by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. In control prostate carcinoma cells, this software recapitulates previous findings that relate morphological characteristics of FAs to their lifetime and their cellular location. We then investigated how FAs are altered when cell migration is induced by the metastasis-promoting hormone HGF and subsequently inhibited by activation of the small GTPase Rap1. We performed a detailed analysis of individual FA parameters, which identified FA size, sliding and intensity as primary targets of Rap1. HGF did not have strong effects on any of the FA parameters within the first hours of its addition. Subsequent Bayesian network inference (BNI), using all measured parameters as input, revealed little correlation between changes in cell migration and FA characteristics in this prostate carcinoma cell line. Instead BNI indicated a concerted coordination of cell size and FA parameters. Thus our results did not reveal a direct relation between the regulation of cell migration and the regulation of FA dynamics.""","""['Emma Spanjaard', 'Ihor Smal', 'Nicos Angelopoulos', 'Ingrid Verlaan', 'Alexandre Matov', 'Erik Meijering', 'Lodewyk Wessels', 'Hans Bos', 'Johan de Rooij']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Human placental multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells modulate trophoblast migration via Rap1 activation.', 'Expression of tumour-suppressing chemokine BRAK/CXCL14 reduces cell migration rate of HSC-3 tongue carcinoma cells and stimulates attachment to collagen and formation of elongated focal adhesions in vitro.', 'PAK4: a pluripotent kinase that regulates prostate cancer cell adhesion.', 'Focal adhesions function as a mechanosensor.', 'Control of cell adhesion dynamics by Rap1 signaling.', 'Visualizing Morphogenesis with the Processing Programming Language.', 'A mathematical analysis of focal adhesion lifetimes and their effect on cell motility.', 'FRET efficiency measurement in a molecular tension probe with a low-cost frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope.', 'An automated quantitative analysis of cell, nucleus and focal adhesion morphology.', 'Bioinformatics analysis of dysregulated microRNAs in the nipple discharge of patients with breast cancer.']"""

Transactivation and nuclear localisation of NF-κB is an index of recurrence in prostate cancer. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) exerts similar effects in prostate cancer models involving increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which are related to NF-κB transactivation. Here we studied differential mechanisms of VIP-induced NF-κB transactivation in non-tumour RWPE-1 and tumour LNCaP and PC3 human prostate epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence studies showed that VIP increases translocation of the p50 subunit of NF-κB1 to the nucleus, an effect that was inhibited by curcumin. The signalling transduction pathways involved are different depending on cell transformation degree. In control cells (RWPE1), the effect is mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) activation and does not implicate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathways whereas the opposite is true in tumour LNCaP and PC3 cells. Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) pathway is involved in transformed cells but not in control cells. Curcumin blocks the activating effect of VIP on COX-2 promoter/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and VEGF expression and secretion. The study incorporates direct observation on COX-2 promoter and suggests that VIP effect on VEGF may be indirectly mediated by PGE2 after being synthesised by COX-2, thus amplifying the initial signal. We show that the signalling involved in VIP effects on VEGF is cAMP/PKA in non-tumour cells and cAMP/EPAC/ERK/PI3K in tumour cells which coincides with pathways mediating p50 nuclear translocation. Thus, VIP appears to use different pathways for NF-κB1 (p50) transactivation in prostate epithelial cells depending on whether they are transformed or not. Transformed cells depend on pro-survival and pro-proliferative signalling pathways involving ERK, PI3-K and cAMP/EPAC which supports the potential therapeutic value of these targets in prostate cancer.""","""['Ana B Fernández-Martínez', 'María J Carmena', 'Ana M Bajo', 'Eva Vacas', 'Manuel Sánchez-Chapado', 'Juan C Prieto']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Vasoactive intestinal peptide induces cyclooxygenase-2 expression through nuclear factor-kappaB in human prostate cell lines Differential time-dependent responses in cancer progression.', 'Vasoactive intestinal peptide transactivates the androgen receptor through a protein kinase A-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Vasoactive intestinal peptide increases vascular endothelial growth factor expression and neuroendocrine differentiation in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Growth factor signalling in prostatic growth: significance in tumour development and therapeutic targeting.', 'Lessons from a crab: molecular mechanisms in different memory phases of Chasmagnathus.', 'Epac: A Promising Therapeutic Target for Vascular Diseases: A Review.', 'Activation of VIPR1 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma progression by regulating arginine and pyrimidine metabolism.', 'cAMP Signaling in Cancer: A PKA-CREB and EPAC-Centric Approach.', 'The Role of Neuropeptide-Stimulated cAMP-EPACs Signalling in Cancer Cells.', 'Obesity-related gut hormones and cancer: novel insight into the pathophysiology.']"""

This invasive phenotype of radioresistant cells is an upshot of IR-induced pro-survival and mitogenic signaling in cancer as well as endothelial cells. Here, we demonstrate that a plant flavonoid, silibinin can radiosensitize endothelial cells by inhibiting expression of pro-angiogenic factors. Combining silibinin with IR not only strongly down-regulated endothelial cell proliferation, clonogenicity and tube formation ability rather it strongly (p<0.001) reduced migratory and invasive properties of PCa cells which were otherwise marginally affected by IR treatment alone. Most of the pro-angiogenic (VEGF, iNOS), migratory (MMP-2) and EMT promoting proteins (uPA, vimentin, N-cadherin) were up-regulated by IR in PCa cells. Interestingly, all of these invasive and EMT promoting actions of IR were markedly decreased by silibinin.

Here, we report the outcome with up to 12 years of follow-up of patients who retained a post-RP detectable PSA and received salvage radiation therapy (SRT, arm C).  Methods and materials:   For the study, 388 patients with pT3-4pN0 prostate cancer with positive or negative surgical margins were recruited. After RP, 307 men achieved an undetectable PSA (arms A + B). In 78 patients the PSA remained above thresholds (median 0.6, range 0.05-5.6 ng/mL). Of the latter, 74 consented to receive 66 Gy to the prostate bed, and SRT was applied at a median of 86 days after RP. Clinical relapse-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Patients with persisting PSA after RP had higher preoperative PSA values, higher tumor stages, higher Gleason scores, and more positive surgical margins than did patients in arms A + B. For the 74 patients, the 10-year clinical relapse-free survival rate was 63%. Forty-three men had hormone therapy; 12 experienced distant metastases; 23 patients died. Compared with men who did achieve an undetectable PSA, the arm-C patients fared significantly worse, with a 10-year metastasis-free survival of 67% versus 83% and overall survival of 68% versus 84%, respectively. In Cox regression analysis, Gleason score ≥8 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.8), pT ≥ 3c (HR 2.4), and extraprostatic extension ≥2 mm (HR 3.6) were unfavorable risk factors of progression.  Conclusions:   A persisting PSA after prostatectomy seems to be an important prognosticator of clinical progression for pT3 tumors.

Tumor rotational movement, which is not well understood, can result in significant geometric and dosimetric inaccuracies. The objective of this study was to measure 6 degrees-of-freedom (6 DoF) prostate and lung tumor motion, focusing on the more novel rotation, using kilovoltage intrafraction monitoring (KIM).  Methods and materials:   Continuous kilovoltage (kV) projections of tumors with gold fiducial markers were acquired during radiation therapy for 267 fractions from 10 prostate cancer patients and immediately before or after radiation therapy for 50 fractions from 3 lung cancer patients. The 6 DoF motion measurements were determined from the individual 3-dimensional (3D) marker positions, after using methods to reject spurious and smooth noisy data, using an iterative closest point algorithm.  Results:   There were large variations in the magnitude of the tumor rotation among different fractions and patients. Various rotational patterns were observed. The average prostate rotation angles around the left-right (LR), superior-inferior (SI), and anterior-posterior (AP) axes were 1.0 ± 5.0°, 0.6 ± 3.3°, and 0.3 ± 2.0°, respectively. For 35% of the time, the prostate rotated more than 5° about the LR axis, indicating the need for intrafractional adaptation during radiation delivery. For lung patients, the average LR, SI, and AP rotation angles were 0.8 ± 4.2°, -0.8 ± 4.5°, and 1.7 ± 3.1°, respectively. For about 30% of the time, the lung tumors rotated more than 5° around the SI axis. Respiration-induced rotation was detected in 2 of the 3 lung patients.  Conclusions:   The prostate and lung tumors were found to undergo rotations of more than 5° for about a third of the time. The lung tumor data represent the first 6 DoF tumor motion measured by kV images.

Consequently, the prostate-specific expression and the sharp up-regulation of PCA3 RNA in prostate cancer suggest a unique transcriptional regulation, which possibly can be attributed to promoter polymorphism. In this study, we investigated a short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphism of TAAA in the promoter region of PCA3 gene found in our previous study in prostate cancer (PCa) patients and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) patients, aiming to evaluate the association between the STR and increased risk for PCa.  Material and methods:   120 PCa cases and 120 benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) cases were identified among participants. The region encompassing the TAAA repeat was amplified with a specific primer set we designed and screened by PCR-based cloning and sequencing in paired peripheral blood leukocytes and prostate tissues. Genotype-specific risks were estimated as odds ratios (ORs) associated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted for age by means of unconditional logistic regression.  Results:   5 PCA3 TAAA STR polymorphisms and 8 genotypes were found in both peripheral blood leukocytes and prostate tissues, the carriers with more TAAA repeats were associated with increased risk for PCa than individuals having less TAAA repeats. Interestingly, 18 (15.0%) of 120 PCa patients had more (TAAA)n repeats in prostate tissues than that in peripheral blood leukocytes, and 3 (2.5%) of 120 had less (TAAA)n repeats in prostate tissues.  Conclusions:   The results of this study suggest that short tandem repeat polymorphism of TAAA in the promoter region of PCA3 gene is a risk-increasing factor for prostate cancer in the Chinese population.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small endogenously expressed noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes at the transcriptional or translational level. Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs play an important role in tumorigenesis, are differentially expressed in different cancer types, and can be found in all bodily fluids so-far tested, including urine.  Methods and materials:   This study was undertaken to determine if miRNA could be isolated from the cell-free fraction of freely voided urine of PCa patients and if a miRNA signature could be found that would identify patients with cancer.  Results:   In a first set of proof-of-concept experiments, we isolated RNA from the supernatant of cultured PCa cells, as well as cellular RNA, and compared the expression of cell-free miRNAs vs. cellular miRNAs. We identified miRNA-483-5p, miRNA-1275, and miRNA-1290 among the most abundant cell-free miRNAs. We then tested the expression of these miRNAs in patient urine samples. A total of 18 patients without detectable PCa by transperineal template-saturation biopsy and 71 patients with diagnosed biopsy-proven PCa were retrospectively analyzed. We could confirm that cell-free miRNAs found in cultures of PCa cells can in fact be isolated from freely voided patients' urine. Furthermore, we found that patients with PCa express miR-483-5p in the cell-free urine fraction at a higher level than control patients do.  Conclusions:   The present study is among the first to show that miRNAs can be detected in the cell-free, non-exosome-enriched fraction of urine collected from patients with PCa.

MicroRNAs comprise a novel class of endogenously transcribed small RNAs that can post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of various genes. Given that the mechanism of microRNA target recognition remains elusive, several genes, including DDC, have not yet been identified as microRNA targets. Nevertheless, a number of specifically designed bioinformatic algorithms provide candidate miRNAs for almost every gene, but still their results exhibit moderate accuracy and should be experimentally validated. Motivated by the above, we herein sought to discover a microRNA that regulates DDC expression. By using the current algorithms according to bibliographic recommendations we found that miR-145 could be predicted with high specificity as a candidate regulatory microRNA for DDC expression. Thus, a validation experiment followed by firstly transfecting an appropriate cell culture system with a synthetic miR-145 sequence and sequentially assessing the mRNA and protein levels of DDC via real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Our analysis revealed that miR-145 had no significant impact on protein levels of DDC but managed to dramatically downregulate its mRNA expression. Overall, the experimental and bioinformatic analysis conducted herein indicate that miR-145 has the ability to regulate DDC mRNA expression and potentially this occurs by recognizing its mRNA as a target.""","""['Emmanuel I Papadopoulos', 'Emmanuel G Fragoulis', 'Andreas Scorilas']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Gene""","""['L-DOPA decarboxylase mRNA levels provide high diagnostic accuracy and discrimination between clear cell and non-clear cell subtypes in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Expression analysis and clinical utility of L-Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) in prostate cancer.', 'L-dopa decarboxylase (DDC) gene expression is related to outcome in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Molecular characteristic and physiological role of DOPA-decarboxylase.', 'MicroRNA target prediction and validation.', 'Dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor expression are disturbed in recurrent miscarriages.', 'Large-Scale microRNA Expression Profiling Identifies Putative Retinal miRNA-mRNA Signaling Pathways Underlying Form-Deprivation Myopia in Mice.']"""

This study was aimed to assess potential anti-cancer activity of maysin, a major flavonoid of corn silk (CS, Zea mays L.), in androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells (PC-3).  Main methods:   Maysin was isolated from CS of Kwangpyeongok, a Korean hybrid corn, via methanol extraction and preparative C18 reverse phase column chromatography. Maysin cytotoxicity was determined by either monitoring cell viability in various cancer cell lines by MTT assay or morphological changes. Apoptotic cell death was assessed by annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), expression levels of Bcl-2 and pro-caspase-3 and by terminal transferase mediated dUTP-fluorescein nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Underlying mechanism in maysin-induced apoptosis of PC-3 cells was explored by evaluating its effects on Akt and ERK pathway.  Key findings:   Maysin dose-dependently reduced the PC-3 cell viability, with an 87% reduction at 200 μg/ml. Maysin treatment significantly induced apoptotic cell death, DNA fragmentation, depolarization of MMP, and reduction in Bcl-2 and pro-caspase-3 expression levels. Maysin also significantly attenuated phosphorylation of Akt and ERK. A combined treatment with maysin and other known anti-cancer agents, including 5-FU, etoposide, cisplatin, or camptothecin, synergistically enhanced PC-3 cell death.  Significance:   These results suggested for the first time that maysin inhibits the PC-3 cancer cell growth via stimulation of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic cell death and may have a strong therapeutic potential for the treatment of either chemo-resistant or androgen-independent human prostate cancer.""","""['Jisun Lee', 'Seul Lee', 'Sun-Lim Kim', 'Ji Won Choi', 'Jeong Yeon Seo', 'Doo Jin Choi', 'Yong Il Park']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Neuroprotective effects of corn silk maysin via inhibition of H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death in SK-N-MC cells.', 'Immunostimulating activity of maysin isolated from corn silk in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages.', ""Acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone) exhibits in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity through the suppression of NF-κB/Akt signaling in prostate cancer cells."", 'Role of the Bcl-2 gene family in prostate cancer progression and its implications for therapeutic intervention.', 'Cucurbitacins as inducers of cell death and a rich source of potential anticancer compounds.', 'Bioactive compounds of corn silk and their role in management of glycaemic response.', 'Anti-tumor effect of ginkgetin on human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines by inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting cell apoptosis.', 'Corn Silk (Zea mays L.)

Identifying features that stratify the risk of overall survival is critical for judiciously applying definitive therapy.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 582 consecutive patients with prostate cancer diagnosed with metastasis between May 7, 1998 and August 27, 2011. Patient age, body mass index, ECOG performance status, Charlson comorbidity index, prostate specific antigen, T and N stages, Gleason and ASA® scores, progression to castration resistant prostate cancer, prior local treatments and synchronous second primary malignancies at metastasis were assessed. A synchronous second primary malignancy was defined as a cytologically or histologically proven solid malignancy. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to estimate overall survival by second primary type and evaluate predictive variables.  Results:   A total of 164 patients (28.1%) had a synchronous second primary malignancy, of which colorectal (9.1%), stomach (7.3%) and lung (7.1%) cancers were the most prevalent types. During a median followup of 34.1 months patients without a synchronous second primary malignancy had a significantly higher overall survival rate than those with lung or stomach cancer. However, men without a second malignancy had outcomes comparable to those in men with colorectal cancer. Clinical stage T4 or greater, ASA score 1 or greater and lung or stomach cancer were independent predictors of overall mortality.  Conclusions:   A substantial proportion of patients with metastatic prostate cancer present with a synchronous second primary malignancy.

Materials and methods:   From a university faculty group practice we identified 1,837 men who underwent prostate biopsy between January 1, 1995 and January 1, 2010. Characteristics of repeat biopsy were examined, including the indication for biopsy, the number of repeat biopsies performed, the number of cores obtained and total prostate specific antigen before biopsy. Features of prostate cancer diagnosed on repeat biopsy were examined, including Gleason score, number of positive cores, percent of tumor and treatment choice. Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify prostate cancer predictors.  Results:   Initial biopsy was negative in 1,213 men. In 255 men a total of 798 repeat biopsies were performed. Of the 63 men diagnosed with prostate cancer Gleason score was 6 or less in 33 (52%), 7 in 22 (35%) and 8-9 in 8 (13%). When categorized by Epstein criteria, the rate of clinically insignificant cancer diagnosis decreased substantially by the third and fourth repeat biopsies. Repeat biopsy in men older than 70 years, biopsies including more than 20 cores and the fourth repeat biopsy were associated with an increased likelihood of prostate cancer diagnosis.  Conclusions:   In men selected for multiple repeat biopsies clinically significant cancer is found at each sampling round. Given the continued likelihood of cancer detection even by the fifth biopsy, early consideration of saturation or image guided biopsy may be warranted in the repeat biopsy population.""","""['Nitya E Abraham', 'Neil Mendhiratta', 'Samir S Taneja']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Is race a positive predictor of cancer on repeat prostate biopsy?', 'Prostate cancers diagnosed at repeat biopsy are smaller and less likely to be high grade.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Besides their role in immune response against infections, numerous studies have shown an important role of different TLRs in cancer, indicating these receptors as potential targets for cancer therapy. We previously demonstrated that the activation of TLR3 by the synthetic double-stranded RNA analogue poly I:C induces apoptosis of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer (PCa) LNCaP cells and, much less efficiently, of the more aggressive PC3 cell line. Therefore, in this study we selected LNCaP cells to investigate the mechanism of TLR3-mediated apoptosis and the in vivo efficacy of poly I:C-based therapy. We show that interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) signalling plays an essential role in TLR3-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP cells through the activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Interestingly, hardly any apoptosis was induced by poly I:C in normal prostate epithelial cells RWPE-1. We also demonstrate for the first time the direct anticancer effect of poly I:C as a single therapeutic agent in a well-established human androgen-sensitive PCa xenograft model, by showing that tumour growth is highly impaired in poly I:C-treated immunodeficient mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of PCa xenografts highlights the antitumour role of poly I:C in vivo both on cancer cells and, indirectly, on endothelial cells.

Historically, biopsy protocols have been designed but have provided rather unsatisfactory results. We report the first case of histologic confirmation of a biochemical recurrence in the prostatectomy bed by performing 3-dimensional transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy with fusion to magnetic resonance images.  Materials and methods:   A 66-year-old man who underwent laparoscopic prostatectomy for a localized prostate cancer of Gleason sum 3+3=6 and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 8.9 ng/L was followed up yearly. Postoperative serum PSA value was <0.04 ng/L. Nine years later, the patient developed a biochemical recurrence with an elevation of serum PSA level to 1.27 ng/mL. A 3-T endorectal positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a 5 × 3 mm nodule in the prostatectomy bed in contact with the vesicourethral anastomosis without hypermetabolism. Two biopsies of this nodule were performed by using a 3-dimensional endorectal ultrasonography probe connected to the Koelis navigation system (Urostation; Koelis, Grenoble, France) with fusion to MRI images.  Results:   Histologic findings confirmed the presence of a recurrence of the prostate cancer of Gleason sum 4+3=7 in both biopsies, and the patient was addressed to the radio-oncologist for salvage therapy.  Conclusion:   The use of a transrectal approach with 3-dimensional guidance and MRI fusion allows correct sampling of prostate cancer recurrence nodules in the prostate bed.

Methods:   From July 2008 to July 2010, 2015 patients had urine collected immediately after a TRUS-guided prostate bx. Excluded were men with history of prostate carcinoma (CaP), <6 or ≥24 bx cores, and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≥50 ng/mL, resulting in 1909 included men. PCA3 and PSA messenger ribonucleic acid were quantitated using transcription-mediated amplification. A PCA3 score of ≥35 was considered positive.  Results:   Mean and median ages were 66 years. Mean and median PSA levels were 6.7 and 5.1 ng/mL, respectively. Bxs were benign in 970 (50.8%), CaP in 726 (38%), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) in 124 (6.5%), and atypical in 89 (4.7%). PCA3 test was informative in 1887 (98.8%) patients.

Materials and methods:   We examined serum total PSA (tPSA) and %fPSA annually in a prostate cancer-screening cohort between July 2001 and June 2011. Men with tPSA >4.0 ng/mL or tPSA of 2.0-4.0 ng/mL with %fPSA ≤12% were screened as positive and were recommended to undergo a biopsy. The study population consisted of 6368 men, aged 40-79 years, who had tPSA ≤4.0 ng/mL at initial screening and who subsequently underwent 1 or more screenings. We calculated the cumulative risk and hazard ratio of prostate cancer stratified by the initial %fPSA groups as quartiles of prostate cancer patients.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 36 months, 119 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. The lowest quartile of %fPSA (<13.3%) was associated with a 21.2-fold higher risk of having prostate cancer compared with the highest quartile (>22.2%). For the subset with an initial tPSA ≤1.0 ng/mL, all men diagnosed with cancer had an initial %fPSA ≤33.3% (median). For the subset with tPSA >1.0 ng/mL, men with %fPSA ≤23.0% (median) had significantly higher risk for cancer than those with %fPSA >23.0% (P <.0001). Of the 114 men with prostate cancer in whom pathologic findings were available, 79 (69.3%) had a Gleason score ≥3 + 4 = 7.

Methods:   From November 2008 to October 2012, a total of 233 consecutive patients were treated by a single surgeon experienced in open and laparoscopic procedures. Four subgroups of patients (1: cases 1-59; 2: 60-117; 3: 118-175; and 4: 176-233) were compared. Complications were classified according to the modified Clavien system. Serum creatine kinase, as an indicator of tissue injury, was measured before, during, and for 5 days after surgery. Renal function monitoring was started preoperatively and ended at discharge. Minimum follow-up was 3 months. Variables were compared using chi-square and Wilcoxon tests.  Results:   Overall, 115 complications were reported in 98 of 233 patients (42%) and significantly decreased after 175 procedures (P = .028). Minor complications (Clavien grades 1-2) represented the most frequent events (86 of 115 [75%]), with a significant drop in group 4 (P <.01). Similarly, the rate of positioning injuries (groups 1-4: 31%, 29%, 29%, and 7%, respectively) showed a significant improvement in group 4 (P = .023). Creatine kinase levels significantly decreased with increased experience (group 1 vs groups 2-4: P <.01). Renal function was unaltered postoperatively.  Conclusion:   A surgeon with extensive open and laparoscopic experience presents a safe learning curve in regard to robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. With increasing experience, the rates of overall and positioning-related complications significantly decrease after 175 procedures.

Preoperatively, all patients were evaluated by uroflowmetry, prostate-specific antigen level, and postvoid residual measurement, as well as by the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire. All perioperative data were recorded in a prospective database. Follow-up appointments included the aforementioned measurements and were scheduled at 1 and 6 months postoperatively.  Results:   Ten RASP procedures were successfully performed by the extraperitoneal approach. Mean patient age and prostate volume were 63.1 years (range, 55-74 years) and 129.4 cm(3) (range, 90-170 cm(3)), respectively. Mean operative time was 122.5 minutes (range, 85-140 minutes) and represented the time from the first incision to the closure of the all incisions. The estimated blood loss was minimal (mean value, 230 mL). Transfusions were not necessary. Mean catheterization period was 7.4 days (range, 6-8 days). The symptomatology, as reported by the International Prostate Symptom Score, was improved at the follow-up appointments in comparison with the baseline values. One case of prolonged fever was noted postoperatively and managed by antibiotics.  Conclusion:   The extraperitoneal approach for RASP proved to be efficient in the management of large prostates.

Methods:   Men were identified using our academic institution's prospectively maintained prostate biopsy database. Patients were classified as aspirin (ASA) users, users of other NSAIDs, or nonusers. The primary outcome was any PC on biopsy, and the secondary outcome was clinically significant PC (CSPC; Gleason sum ≥7). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to adjust for a priori defined clinical confounders.  Results:   Of 839 patients, 408 (48.6%) were diagnosed with PC and 201 (24.0%) had CSPC. A higher proportion of ASA users (63.5%) and other NSAID users (61.2%) had PC compared with nonusers (41.9%; P <.001). CSPC was more common among ASA users (34.9%; P <.001) compared with other NSAID users (20.0%) and nonusers (20.9%). In multivariate regression analyses, ASA use (odds ratio [OR] = 2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-3.13; P = .001) and other NSAID use (OR = 2.42; 95% CI = 1.36-431; P = .003) were associated with higher odds of PC detection, whereas ASA use was associated with higher odds of CSPC (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.00-2.62; P = .048).  Conclusion:   In men undergoing biopsy, ASA and other NSAID use were associated with increased probability of detecting PC, whereas ASA use was associated with the risk of detecting CSPC. Although NSAID use might have a protective biological effect against PC, men who develop elevated prostate-specific antigen levels while on NSAIDs may nonetheless be less likely to have an inflammatory etiology and more likely to harbor PC. It may be warranted for clinicians to consider the influence of NSAIDs when evaluating patients being considered for biopsy.""","""['Bimal Bhindi', 'David Margel', 'Robert J Hamilton', 'Kimberly A Fernandes', 'Greg Trottier', 'Karen M Hersey', 'Antonio Finelli', 'John Trachtenberg', 'Alexandre Zlotta', 'Girish S Kulkarni', 'Ants Toi', 'Andrew Evans', 'Theodorus H van der Kwast', 'Neil E Fleshner']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Reply: To PMID 25443907.', 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of prostate cancer in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.', 'A population-based study of daily nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and prostate cancer.', 'Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and prostate cancer in a high-risk population.', 'Postoperative non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colorectal anastomotic leakage.

Technological capacity was conceptualized as a market's ability to provide prostate cancer treatment with new technology, including robotic prostatectomy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).  Methods:   In this retrospective cohort study, we used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database from 2004 to 2009 to identify men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (n = 46,274). We measured technological capacity as the number of providers performing robotic prostatectomy or IMRT per population in a health care market. We used multilevel logistic regression analysis to assess the association of technological capacity with receiving quality care according to a set of nationally endorsed quality measures, while adjusting for patient and market characteristics.  Results:   Overall, our findings were mixed with only subtle differences in quality of care comparing high-tech with low-tech markets. High robotic prostatectomy capacity was associated with better adherence to some quality measures, such as avoiding unnecessary bone scans (79.8% vs 73.0%; P = .003) and having follow-up with urologists (67.7% vs 62.6%; P = .023). However, for most measures, neither high robotic prostatectomy nor high-IMRT capacity was associated with significant increases in adherence rates. In fact, for 1 measure (treatment by a high-volume provider), high-IMRT capacity was associated with lower performance (23.4% vs 28.5%; P <.001).  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that new technology is not clearly associated with higher quality of care.

Methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional study of 323,426 men aged ≥65 years who had a screening PSA test in 2003 at a Veterans Affairs facility. The primary predictor was the use of statin medications at the time of index screening PSA test. The main outcome was the screening PSA value. Poisson regressions were performed to calculate adjusted relative risks for having an abnormal screening PSA result according to statin usage.  Results:   Percentages of men with PSA results exceeding commonly used thresholds of >2.5, >4.0, and >6.5 ng/mL were 21.0%, 7.6%, and 1.6%, respectively. These percentages decreased with statin use, increasing statin dose, duration of statin use, and potency of the statin. For example, after adjusting for age, the percentage of men having a PSA level >4.0 ng/mL ranged from 8.2% in non-statin users to 6.2% in men prescribed with >40 mg of simvastatin dose. Adjusted relative risks of having a PSA level >4.0 ng/mL were 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-0.93), 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91), and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.80-0.87), respectively for men on simvastatin dose of 5-20, >20-40, and >40 mg vs non-statin users.  Conclusion:   Statin use is associated with a reduction in the probability that an older man will have an abnormal screening PSA result, regardless of the PSA threshold. This reduction is more pronounced with higher statin dose, longer statin duration, and higher statin potency.""","""['Ying Shi', 'Kathy Z Fung', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Richard M Hoffman', 'Victoria L Tang', 'Louise C Walter']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Reply: To PMID 25443902.', 'The influence of statin medications on prostate-specific antigen levels.', 'Probability of an abnormal screening prostate-specific antigen result based on age, race, and prostate-specific antigen threshold.', 'Clinician Factors Associated With Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening in Older Veterans With Limited Life Expectancy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen levels in the United States: implications of various definitions for abnormal.', 'Five-year downstream outcomes following prostate-specific antigen screening in older men.', 'The Association of Prediagnostic Statin Use with Aggressive Prostate Cancer from the Multiethnic Cohort Study.', 'Outcomes of Screening for Prostate Cancer Among Men Who Use Statins.', 'Application of Anti-Inflammatory Agents in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Modulating Effects of Benign Prostate Enlargement Medications on Upgrading Predictors in Patients with Gleason 6 at Biopsy.', 'The current evidence on statin use and prostate cancer prevention: are we there yet?']"""

Although new radiation techniques allow high doses to be delivered to the target, the surrounding healthy organs (rectum and bladder) may suffer from irradiation, which might produce undesirable side-effects. Hence, the understanding of the complex toxicity dose-volume effect relationships is crucial to adapt the treatment, thereby decreasing the risk of toxicity. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to classify patients at risk of presenting rectal bleeding based on a Deterministic Multi-way Analysis (DMA) of three-dimensional planned dose distributions across a population. After a non-rigid spatial alignment of the anatomies applied to the dose distributions, the proposed method seeks for two bases of vectors representing bleeding and non bleeding patients by using the Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition of two fourth order arrays of the planned doses. A patient is then classified according to its distance to the subspaces spanned by both bases. A total of 99 patients treated for prostate cancer were used to analyze and test the performance of the proposed approach, named CP-DMA, in a leave-one-out cross validation scheme. Results were compared with supervised (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, K-means, K-nearest neighbor) and unsupervised (recent principal component analysis-based algorithm, and multidimensional classification method) approaches based on the registered dose distribution. Moreover, CP-DMA was also compared with the Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) model. The CP-DMA method allowed rectal bleeding patients to be classified with good specificity and sensitivity values, outperforming the classical approaches.""","""['Auréline Fargeas', 'Laurent Albera', 'Amar Kachenoura', 'Gaël Dréan', 'Juan-David Ospina', 'Julie Coloigner', 'Caroline Lafond', 'Jean-Bernard Delobel', 'Renaud De Crevoisier', 'Oscar Acosta']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Eng Phys""","""['A Novel Classification Method for Prediction of Rectal Bleeding in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Based on a Semi-Nonnegative ICA of 3D Planned Dose Distributions.', 'Functional data analysis in NTCP modeling: a new method to explore the radiation dose-volume effects.', 'Comparison of rectal dose-wall histogram versus dose-volume histogram for modeling the incidence of late rectal bleeding after radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric factors predictive of late toxicity in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Consolidating risk estimates for radiation-induced complications in individual patient: late rectal toxicity.', 'Tensor Regression-based Model to Investigate Heterogeneous Spatial Radiosensitivity After I-125 Seed Implantation for Prostate Cancer.', 'Machine Learning-Based Models for Prediction of Toxicity Outcomes in Radiotherapy.']"""

We primarily considered estimates of lesion volume and location based on computer-aided analysis of ultrasound (US) raw radiofrequency (RF) data acquired during trans-rectal ultrasound. The imaging analysis device used had been shown to accurately detect tumor loci within the prostate in previous studies.  Methods and materials:   US raw RF data were collected from motorized trans-rectal ultrasound of 68 consecutive men with operable prostate cancer.

Methods:   Relying on the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), patients with CaP with bone metastases between 1998 and 2010 were abstracted. Patients who experienced skeletal-related events were identified, and hospital charges were calculated. Generalized linear regression analyses focused on in-hospital mortality.  Results:   Between 1998 and 2010, a weighted estimate of 443,929 CaP visits with bone metastases was recorded. Of these, 15.9% experienced at least 1 SRE. The rate of SRE decreased from 18% to 15.4% (1998-2010, estimated annual percent change [EAPC] =-1.44%, P = 0.005) and the SRE-associated mortality decreased from 8.5% to 4.7% (1998-2010, EAPC =-3.68%, P = 0.004). Nevertheless, the inflation-adjusted charges associated with hospital visits of patients with CaP with bone metastases rose by 92% to $1,512,449,106 (EAPC = +8.82%, P<0.001), and SRE charges rose by 94% to $369,256,799 (EAPC =+7.62%, P<0.001).

Despite the significant worldwide impact of prostate cancer, few data are available specifically addressing satisfaction with treatment-related care.  Patients and methods:   CaPSURE comprises participants from 40 US sites who were monitored during and after their treatment course. Participants who were diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer after 1999 underwent radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy or primary androgen deprivation, and those who also completed the satisfaction questionnaire within 2 years of treatment were included in the present study. Satisfaction was measured using a validated instrument that assesses contact with providers, confidence in providers, communication skills, humanness and overall satisfaction. Multivariable linear regression analysis were performed to evaluate the independent relationships between demographic, clinical, treatment and patient-reported parameters and satisfaction.  Results:   Of the 3056 participants, 1927 (63%) were treated with radical prostatectomy, 843 (28%) were treated with radiation therapy and 286 (9%) were treated with primary androgen deprivation. Multivariable analysis showed that multiple patient-reported factors were independently associated with satisfaction, whereas clinical, demographic and treatment parameters were not. Baseline health-related quality of life, measured by the 36-item short-form health survey, baseline fear of cancer recurrence (all P<0.01) and declines in the sexual (P = 0.03), urinary (P<0.01) and bowel (P = 0.02) function domains of the University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index were all independently associated with satisfaction. Patient-reported outcomes were more strongly associated with satisfaction in the low-risk subgroup.

Methods:   We adopted a retrospective cohort design using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database between 1995 and 2003. Patients with prostate cancer diagnosed between 1995 and 1998 were identified and followed retrospectively for 1 year pre-diagnosis and up to 8 years post diagnosis. In this cohort of patients with prostate cancer, depression during treatment phase (1 year after diagnosis of prostate cancer) or in the follow-up phase was identified using the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision depression-related codes.

Results:   Of the 50,147 patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, 4285 (8.54%) had a diagnosis of depression.

Methods and materials:   Between 1993 and 2010, 1176 patients were treated with conventional fractionation (1.8 Gy per fraction, median 70.2 Gy, n=929) or hypofractionation (2.35-2.90 Gy per fraction, n=247). Data referred to 2004-2010 (when all schemes were in use, n=563; conventional fractionation: 316; hypofractionation: 247) were fitted as a logit function of biological equivalent dose (BED), according to the LQ model with/without including a time factor γ (fixing α/β = 5 Gy). The 3-year risks of severe urethral stenosis, incontinence, and hematuria were considered as endpoints. Best-fit parameters were derived, and the resulting BEDs were taken in multivariable backward logistic models, including relevant clinical variables, considering the whole population.  Results:   The 3-year incidences of severe stenosis, incontinence, and hematuria were, respectively, 6.6%, 4.8%, and 3.3% in the group treated in 2004-2010. The best-fitted α/β values were 0.81 Gy and 0.74 Gy for incontinence and hematuria, respectively, with the classic LQ formula. When fixing α/β = 5 Gy, best-fit values for γ were, respectively, 0.66 Gy/d and 0.85 Gy/d. Sensitivity analyses showed reasonable values for γ (0.6-1.0 Gy/d), with comparable goodness of fit for α/β values between 3.5 and 6.5 Gy. Likelihood ratio tests showed that the fits with/without including γ were equivalent. The resulting multivariable backward logistic models in the whole population included BED, pT4, and use of antihypertensives (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.72) for incontinence and BED, pT4, and year of surgery (AUC = 0.80) for hematuria. Stenosis data could not be fitted: a 4-variable model including only clinical factors (acute urinary toxicity, pT4, year of surgery, and use of antihypertensives) was suggested (AUC = 0.73).

Methods and materials:   A retrospective evaluation was performed in 9 prostate cancer patients who had undergone MR-SIM in addition to CT simulation (CT-SIM). MR-SIM data were used to generate synCT images by using a novel, voxel-based weighted summation approach. A subset of patients was used for weight optimization, and the number of patients to use during optimization was determined. Hounsfield unit (HU) differences between CT-SIM and synCT images were analyzed via mean absolute error (MAE). Original, CT-based treatment plans were mapped onto synCTs. DRRs were generated, and agreement between CT and synCT-generated DRRs was evaluated via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Dose was recalculated, and dose-volume metrics and gamma analysis were used to evaluate resulting treatment plans.  Results:   Full field-of-view synCT MAE across all patients was 74.3 ± 10.9 HU with differences from CTs of 2.0 ± 8.1 HU and 11.9 ± 46.7 HU for soft tissue structures (prostate, bladder, and rectum) and femoral bones, respectively.

Methods and materials:   Ten prostate cancer patients with weekly verification CTs underwent pencil beam scanning with the bilateral single-field uniform dose (SFUD) modality. A typical field had 10-15 energy layers and 500-1000 spots. According to their treatment logs, each layer delivery time was <1 s, with average time to change layers of approximately 8 s. Real-time intrafraction prostate motion was determined from our previously reported prospective study using Calypso beacon transponders. Prostate motion and beam delivering sequence of the worst-case scenario patient were synchronized to calculate the ""true"" dose received by the prostate. The intrafraction effect was examined by applying the worst-case scenario prostate motion on the planning CT, and the residual interfraction effect was examined on the basis of weekly CT scans. The resultant dose variation of target and critical structures was examined to evaluate the interplay effect.  Results:   The clinical target volume (CTV) coverage was degraded because of both effects. The CTV D99 (percentage dose to 99% of the CTV) varied up to 10% relative to the initial plan in individual fractions. However, over the entire course of treatment the total dose degradation of D99 was 2%-3%, with a standard deviation of <2%. Absolute differences between SFUD, intensity modulate proton therapy, and one-field-per-day SFUD plans were small. The intrafraction effect dominated over the residual interfraction effect for CTV coverage. Mean dose to the anterior rectal wall increased approximately 10% because of combined residual interfraction and intrafraction effects, the interfraction effect being dominant.

Methods and materials:   From June 2013 to January 2014, a Web-based survey was sent to 250 American and Canadian academic radiation oncologists who treat prostate cancer. Participants were provided 4 case vignettes in which patients received radiation therapy and developed rectal bleeding and were asked for management plans and to rate the bleeding according to NCI CTC v.4 and RTOG late toxicity grading (scales provided). In 2 cases, participants were also asked whether they would send the patient for colonoscopy. A multilevel, random intercept modeling approach was used to assess sources of variation (case, respondent) in toxicity grading to calculate the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Agreement on a dichotomous grading scale (low grades 1-2 vs high grades 3-4) was also assessed, using the κ statistic for multiple respondents.  Results:   Seventy-two radiation oncologists (28%) completed the survey. Forty-seven (65%) reported having either written or been principal investigator on a study using these scales. Agreement between respondents was moderate (ICC 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.58) when using NCI CTC and fair using the RTOG scale (ICC 0.28, 95% CI 0.20-0.40). Respondents who chose an invasive management were more likely to select a higher toxicity grade (P<.0001). Using the dichotomous scale, we observed moderate agreement (κ = 0.42, 95% CI 0.40-0.44) with the NCI CTC scale, but only slight agreement with the RTOG scale (κ = 0.19, 95% CI 0.17-0.21).  Conclusion:   Low interrater reliability was observed among radiation oncologists grading rectal bleeding using 2 common scales.

Recently, studies have affirmed that ZFX is associated with several human cancers, including lymphoma, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and liver cancer, which suggests ZFX as a potential therapeutic target in cancer. However, the functional role of ZFX in human renal cancer remains unclear. Herein, we detected the expression of ZFX in 42 patients with renal cancer and found the expression of ZFX was specifically upregulated in cancer tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, we employed lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock down ZFX expression in two human renal cell carcinoma cell lines, 786-0 and ACHN. Functional analysis indicated that ZFX silencing significantly inhibited renal cell carcinoma cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, probably because of suppression of CDK4 and cyclin D1, and induced apoptosis via activation of Bax, Caspase 3, and PUMA in a p53-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that knockdown of ZFX by shRNA may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of renal cancer.""","""['Qiang Fang', 'Wei-hua Fu', 'Jing Yang', 'Xing Li', 'Zhan-song Zhou', 'Zhi-weng Chen', 'Jin-hong Pan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Genet""","""['Knockdown of zinc finger protein X-linked inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by activating caspase-3 and caspase-9.', 'Zinc finger protein x-linked (ZFX) contributes to patient prognosis, cell proliferation and apoptosis in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Regulation of cell proliferation and migration in gallbladder cancer by zinc finger X-chromosomal protein.', 'Overexpression of ZFX and its involvement in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.', 'Prognostic value of Zinc-finger protein X-linked in patients with solid tumors.', 'The human inactive X chromosome modulates expression of the active X chromosome.', 'Circ_0000520 contributes to triple-negative breast cancer progression through mediating the miR-1296/ZFX axis.', 'Characterization of the ZFX family of transcription factors that bind downstream of the start site of CpG island promoters.', 'Methyl-indole inhibits pancreatic cancer cell viability by down-regulating ZFX expression.', 'Homoharringtonine enhances the effect of imatinib on chronic myelogenous leukemia cells by downregulating ZFX.']"""

However, the relationships between other aspects of children's socioeconomic position (e.g., occupational class and economic resources) and parental mortality have not been examined. Using the Swedish Multi-generation Register that connects parents to their children, this paper studies the associations of children's various socioeconomic resources (education, occupation, and income) and parents' mortality. The models are adjusted for a range of parental socioeconomic resources and include the resources of the parents' partners. In addition to all-cause mortality, five causes of death are analyzed separately (circulatory disease mortality, overall cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer). The results show net associations between all included indicators of children's socioeconomic position and parents' mortality risk, with the clearest association for education. Children's education is significantly associated with all of the examined causes of death except prostate cancer. Breast cancer mortality is negatively related to offspring's education but not the mothers' own education. To conclude, children's education seems to be a key factor compared with other dimensions of socioeconomic position in the offspring generation. This finding suggests that explanations linked to behavioral norms or knowledge are more plausible than those linked to access to material resources. However, it is possible that children's education - to a greater degree than class and income - captures unmeasured parental characteristics. The cause-specific analyses imply that future research should investigate whether offspring's socioeconomic position is linked to the likelihood of developing diseases and/or the chances of treating them. A broader family perspective in the description and explanations of social inequalities in health that includes the younger generation may increase our understanding of why these inequalities persist across the life course.""","""['Jenny Torssander']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Soc Sci Med""","""[""Children's educational attainment, occupation, and income and their parents' mortality."", ""Adult children's socioeconomic resources and mothers' survival after a breast cancer diagnosis: a Swedish population-based cohort study."", 'Family pediatrics: report of the Task Force on the Family.', 'Intergenerational payoffs of education.', 'Moderating or mediating effects of family characteristics on socioeconomic inequalities in child health in high-income countries - a scoping review.', ""Adult child socio-economic status and older parents' psychosocial outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic."", ""Does Children's Education Improve Parental Health and Longevity?

Materials and methods:   We queried our RP database from 2004 to 2013. Extent of EPE on RP was divided into 3 groups: no EPE, focal EPE (F-EPE; a few extraprostatic cancer glands on 1-2 slides), and nonfocal EPE (NF-EPE). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models determined the influence of EPE on BCRFS.  Results:   A total of 10,750 men underwent RP during the study period. Of these, 7843 men (73.0%) had no EPE, 1258 (11.7%) men had F-EPE, and 1649 men had (15.3%) NF-EPE. Overall BCRFS was worse in men with NF-EPE than those with F-EPE or no EPE. In a multivariate model, F-EPE and NF-EPE were both independently associated with worse BCRFS compared with no EPE (F-EPE: hazard ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.84-3.10; P <.0001; NF-EPE: hazard ratio, 3.57; 95% confidence interval, 2.89-4.40; P <.0001). When stratified by Gleason score in men without seminal vesicle invasion or lymph node metastases, there was no difference in BCRFS for Gleason score <6, 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 3 = 7, and 8 for F-EPE vs no EPE; however, patients with Gleason score of 9-10 with F-EPE had worse BCRFS. Patients with NF-EPE had significantly worse BCRFS for Gleason score <6, 7, and 8 and a trend for worse BCRFS for Gleason score 9-10 compared with no EPE.

Methods:   The Johns Hopkins AS registry is a prospective observational study that has enrolled 982 men since 1994. Including only men who met all National Comprehensive Cancer Network VLR criteria (clinical stage ≤T1, Gleason score ≤6, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level <10 ng/mL, PSA density <0.15 ng/mL/cm(3), positive cores <3, percent cancer per core ≤50), we analyzed a cohort of 654 men (615 Caucasians and 39 AAs). The association of race with reclassification on serial biopsy was assessed with competing-risks regressions.  Results:   AA men on AS were more likely than Caucasians to experience upgrading on serial biopsy (36% vs 16%; adjusted P <.001). Adjusting for PSA level, prostate size, volume of cancer on biopsy, treatment year, and body mass index, AA race was an independent predictor of biopsy reclassification (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.8; P = .003). Examining specific modes of reclassification, AA race was independently associated with reclassification by grade (subdistribution hazard ratio, 3.0; P = .002) but not by volume.

Materials and methods:   Using human CRPC cells (PC3 and DU145), S100A3 expression levels were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. After S100A3-specific small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) treatment, cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and apoptotic cell fractions were evaluated by flow cytometry. The invasive properties of these cells and the expression pattern of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were assessed using transwell migration assays, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and gelatin zymography. Finally, the in vivo efficacy of S100A3 inhibition on human CRPC cells was investigated using human tumor xenograft models in nude mice.  Results:   Human CRPC cells showed overexpression of S100A3, and its suppression reduced cell viability owing to apoptotic cell death. Additionally, S100A3 inhibition decreased the invasiveness of human CRPC cells. Moreover, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were downregulated in PC3, whereas only MMP-9 was downregulated in D145 after S100A3 inhibition. In human CRPC xenograft models, we noted a marked reduction in tumor growth in mice injected with S100A3 short hairpin RNA-transfected PC3 and DU145 cells.  Conclusion:   Human CRPC cells showed upregulation of S100A3 expression, and S100A3 inhibition reduced tumor cell viability. S100A3 inhibition reduced invasion capability with downregulation of MMP expression.

We did a prespecified subgroup analysis from ALSYMPCA to assess the effect of previous docetaxel use on the efficacy and safety of radium-223.  Methods:   In the phase 3, randomised, double-blind ALSYMPCA trial, patients with symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, at least two symptomatic bone metastases, no known visceral metastases, and who were receiving best standard of care were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive six injections of radium-223 (50 kBq/kg intravenously) or matching placebo, with one injection given every 4 weeks. Patients had either received previous docetaxel treatment or were unsuitable for or declined docetaxel; previous docetaxel use (yes or no) was a trial stratification factor. We investigated the effect of previous docetaxel use on radium-223 treatment for the primary endpoint of overall survival, the main secondary efficacy endpoints, and safety. Efficacy analyses were done for the intention-to-treat population; safety analyses were done for the safety population. The trial has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00699751.  Findings:   Randomisation took place between June 12, 2008, and Feb 1, 2011. 526 (57%) of 921 randomly assigned patients had received previous docetaxel treatment (352 in the radium-223 group and 174 in the placebo group) and 395 (43%) had not (262 in the radium-223 group and 133 in the placebo group). Radium-223 prolonged median overall survival compared with placebo, irrespective of previous docetaxel use (previous docetaxel use, hazard ratio [HR] 0·70, 95% CI 0·56-0·88; p=0·002; no previous docetaxel use, HR 0·69, 0·52-0·92; p=0·01). The benefit of radium-223 compared with placebo was seen in both docetaxel subgroups for most main secondary efficacy endpoints; risk for time to time to first symptomatic skeletal event was reduced with radium-223 versus placebo in patients with previous docetaxel use, but the difference was not significant in those with no previous docetaxel use. 322 (62%) of 518 patients previously treated with docetaxel had grade 3-4 adverse events, compared with 205 (54%) of 383 patients without docetaxel. Patients who had previously been treated with docetaxel had a higher incidence of grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia with radium-223 than with placebo (31 [9%] of 347 patients vs five [3%] of 171 patients), whereas the incidence was similar between treatment groups among patients with no previous docetaxel use (seven [3%] of 253 patients vs one [1%] of 130 patients). The incidences of grade 3-4 anaemia and neutropenia were similar between the radium-223 and placebo groups within both docetaxel subgroups.

Less overuse of services, however, may not be reliably associated with less geographic variation.  Objective:   To compare average use and geographic variation in use of cancer-related imaging between fee-for-service Medicare and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.  Design:   Observational analysis of cancer-related imaging from 2003 to 2005 using Medicare and VA utilization data linked to cancer registry data. Multilevel models, adjusted for sociodemographic and tumor characteristics, were used to estimate mean differences in annual imaging use between cohorts of Medicare and VA patients within geographic areas and variation in use across areas for each cohort.  Setting:   40 hospital referral regions.  Patients:   Older men with lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer, including 34,475 traditional Medicare beneficiaries (Medicare cohort) and 6835 VA patients (VA cohort).  Measurements:   Per-patient count of imaging studies for which lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer was the primary diagnosis (each study weighted by a standardized price), and a direct measure of overuse-advanced imaging for prostate cancer at low risk for metastasis.  Results:   Adjusted annual use of cancer-related imaging was lower in the VA cohort than in the Medicare cohort (price-weighted count, $197 vs. $379 per patient; P < 0.001), as was annual use of advanced imaging for prostate cancer at low risk for metastasis ($41 vs. $117 per patient; P < 0.001). Geographic variation in cancer-related imaging use was similar in magnitude in the VA and Medicare cohorts.  Limitation:   Observational study design.

Here we show that expression of ERα is increased in high grade human PCa. Similarly, ERα is elevated in mouse models of aggressive PCa driven by MYC overexpression or deletion of PTEN. Within the prostate of PTEN-deficient mice, there is a progressive pattern of ERα expression: low in benign glands, moderate in tumors within the dorsal, lateral and ventral lobes, and high in tumors within the anterior prostate. This expression significantly correlates with the proliferation marker Ki67. Furthermore, in vitro knockdown of ERα in cells derived from PTEN-deficient tumors causes a significant and sustained decrease in proliferation. Depletion of ERα also reduces the activity of the PI3K and MAPK pathways, both downstream targets of non-genomic ERα action. Finally, ERα knockdown reduces the levels of the MYC protein and lowers the sensitivity of cellular proliferation to glucose withdrawal, which correlates with decreased expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1.

However, the regulatory mechanism of combinatorial Ras and WNT signaling in advanced prostate cancer is still unclear. TCF7, a WNT signaling-related gene, has been implicated as a critical factor in bone metastasis, and here we show that TCF7 is a direct target of miR-34a. In samples of prostate cancer patients, miR-34a levels are inversely correlated with TCF7 expression and a WNT dependent gene signature. Ectopic miR-34a expression inhibited bone metastasis and reduced cancer cell proliferation in a Ras-dependent xenograft model. We demonstrate that miR-34a can directly interfere with the gene expression of the anti-proliferative BIRC5, by targeting BIRC5 3'UTR. Importantly, BIRC5 overexpression was sufficient to reconstitute anti-apoptotic signaling in cells expressing high levels of miR-34a. In prostate cancer patients, we found that BIRC5 levels were positively correlated with a Ras signaling signature expression.

Methods:   Medical records of 458 men treated with definitive RT for high-risk, nonmetastatic prostate cancer at 3 academic referral centers from 1988 to 2009 were examined. Median dose was 76.4 Gy. Men received no ADT (n=105), STADT (<12 mo, n=194), or long-term ADT (LTADT: ≥12 mo, n=160). Univariate and multivariable analysis for freedom from distant metastases (FFDM) and cause-specific survival (CSS) were performed. Median follow-up was 71 months.  Results:   Seven-year FFDM was 83% and CSS was 91%. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir ≤0.2 (HR=0.36; 95% CI, 0.20-0.64) and Gleason score (GS) were associated with FFDM and CSS (all P<0.05). ADT duration was not associated (P>0.05). Those with PSA nadir ≤0.2 ng/mL had improved outcomes. Men with GS 9 disease did poorly despite a PSA nadir ≤0.2 ng/mL and had improved CSS with LTADT (95% vs. 71%, P<0.05).  Conclusions:   Select men with high-risk disease treated with dose-escalated RT may not require LTADT. In men treated with ADT, PSA nadir ≤0.2 is an independent prognostic factor associated with FFDM and CSS. Men without GS 9 may have acceptable outcomes with STADT if PSA nadir is ≤0.2 ng/mL.

We have been exploring an alternative approach using natural agents and two bioactive mushroom extracts isolated from Phellinus linteus (PL), namely PL-ES and PL-I-ES, were of our interest. As anticancer effects of similar extracts have been reported in several cancers, we investigated whether PL-ES and PL-I-ES might have such anticancer activities on a variety of human cancer cells in vitro.  Methods:   Ten different types of human cancer cell lines, including three metastatic prostate, bladder, kidney, lung, breast, stomach, liver, and brain cancer cells, were employed and tested with PL-ES or PL-I-ES. Cell growth/viability, exertion of oxidative stress, and induction of apoptosis were assessed by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay, lipid peroxidation (LPO) assay, and specific enzymatic assay, respectively.  Results:   PL-ES (100 µg/mL) exhibited potent anticancer activity, resulting in a significant (40-80%) growth reduction in all 10 cancer cells at 72 hours. PL-I-ES (100 µg/mL) was effective on only four cancer cells but its higher concentration at 250 µg/mL led to a significant (25-90%) growth reduction in seven cancer cells. LPO assays indicated that such a significant growth reduction by PL-ES (100 µg/mL) or PL-I-ES (100 or 250 µg/mL) could result from cell death due to a cytotoxic effect of oxidative stress (through free radicals). Moreover, enzymatic assays for caspase-3 (Csp-3) and caspase-9 (Csp-9), the pro-apoptotic regulators, showed that both enzymes were significantly activated by PL-ES or PL-I-ES, indicating that cell death due to oxidative stress was more likely associated with apoptosis.  Conclusions:   The present study shows that both PL-ES and PL-I-ES indeed have anticancer effects on a variety of cancer cells, although PL-ES appears to be more potent than PL-I-ES. Such an anticancer effect is presumably attributed to oxidative stress, which will ultimately lead to apoptosis. Therefore, these two bioactive mushroom extracts may have clinical implications in a more effective therapeutic option for a variety of human malignancies.""","""['Sensuke Konno', 'Kevin Chu', 'Nicholas Feuer', 'John Phillips', 'Muhammad Choudhury']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Clin Med Res""","""['Induction of cell death in renal cell carcinoma with combination of D-fraction and vitamin C.', 'Induction of apoptosis in human prostatic cancer cells with beta-glucan (Maitake mushroom polysaccharide).', 'Protective effects of Phellinus linteus extract against iron overload-mediated oxidative stress in cultured rat hepatocytes.', 'A medicinal mushroom: Phellinus linteus.', 'The Key Role of Mitochondrial Apoptotic Pathway in the Cytotoxic Effect of Mushroom Extracts on Cancer Cells.', 'Effect of Smilax spp. and Phellinus linteus combination on cytotoxicity and cell proliferation of breast cancer cells.', 'Culture Conditions for Mycelial Growth and Anti-Cancer Properties of Termitomyces.', 'The Fairy Chemical Imidazole-4-carboxamide Inhibits the Expression of Axl, PD-L1, and PD-L2 and Improves Response to Cisplatin in Melanoma.', 'A review of the therapeutic and biological effects of edible and wild mushrooms.', 'Screening for proteins related to the biosynthesis of hispidin and its derivatives in Phellinus igniarius using iTRAQ proteomic analysis.']"""

The cancer cells were separated from the tumors, and analyzed for their growth rate and clonogenicity in culture. The expression of PCa-targeted genes was also assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The rate of growth of 22Rv1 tumors in sulfur-treated nude mice gradually decreased, and was reduced by 41.99% (P<0.01) after 22 days when compared with that of the control group. In addition, the growth of DU-145 tumors was also suppressed by 75.16% (P<0.05) after 11 weeks. The clonogenicity of the sulfur-treated tumor cells decreased by 36.7% when compared with that of the control cells.

Results:   For the cohort, median age was 69 years. Median follow-up was 66.3 months. Five-year BRFS rate was 84.3% with 71 biochemical relapses and 5-year OS rate was 89.1% with 54 deaths. The concordance-indices for BRFS prediction were 0.588, 0.550 and 0.567 for AJCC7, AJCC6 and D'Amico respectively. Initial PSA, T-stage and AJCC7 were prognostic for BRFS on UVA. Comparison of AJCC7 vs. D'Amico showed no statistical additional value of either classification system although D'Amico was superior when compared to AJCC6 in predicting BRFS. T-stage ≥3 and D'Amico were significant prognostic factors for BRFS on MVA.  Conclusion:   In our local, predominantly Chinese population, neither AJCC6 nor AJCC7 demonstrated a high predictive accuracy for BRFS although AJCC7 has a slightly better predictive ability than AJCC6.""","""['Meihua Wong', 'Connie Yip', 'Huihua Li', 'Terence Tan', 'Ravindran Kanesvaran', 'Balram Chowbay', 'Puay Hoon Tan', 'Min Han Tan', 'Fuh Yong Wong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Ann Acad Med Singap""","""[""Beyond D'Amico risk classes for predicting recurrence after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: the Candiolo classifier."", 'Ten-year biochemical relapse-free survival after external beam radiation and brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer: the Seattle experience.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'An external validation of the Candiolo nomogram in a cohort of prostate cancer patients treated by external-beam radiotherapy.', 'Why the UK Should Consider Gene Expression Testing in Prostate Cancer.', 'Usefulness of the prostate health index in predicting the presence and aggressiveness of prostate cancer among Korean men: a prospective observational study.', 'Diagnostic Performance of %-2proPSA and Prostate Health Index for Prostate Cancer: Prospective, Multi-institutional Study.', 'Validation of American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth staging system among prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Assessment of the prognostic value of the 8th AJCC staging system for patients with clinically staged prostate cancer; A time to sub-classify stage IV?']"""

Normalization, segmentation, and identification of corresponding CNAs for meta-analysis was achieved using established commercial software. Unsupervised analysis identified five genomic subgroups in which approximately 90% of the samples were characterized by abnormal profiles with gains of 8q. The most common loss was 8p (NKX3.1). The CNA distribution in other genomic subgroups was characterized by losses at 2q, 3p, 5q, 6q, 13q, 16q, 17p, 18q, and PTEN (10q), and acquisition of 21q deletions associated with the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion rearrangement. Parallel analysis of advanced and primary tumors in the cohort indicated that genomic deletions of PTEN and the gene fusion were enriched in advanced disease. A supervised analysis of the PTEN deletion and the fusion gene showed that PTEN deletion was sufficient to impose higher levels of CNA. Moreover, the overall percentage of the genome altered was significantly higher when PTEN was deleted, suggesting that this important genomic subgroup was likely characterized by intrinsic chromosomal instability. Predicted alterations in expression levels of candidate genes in each of the recurrent CNA regions characteristic of each subgroup showed that signaling networks associated with cancer progression and genome stability were likely to be perturbed at the highest level in the PTEN deleted genomic subgroup.""","""['Julia L Williams', 'Peter A Greer', 'Jeremy A Squire']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Genet""","""['Genetic alterations in untreated metastases and androgen-independent prostate cancer detected by comparative genomic hybridization and allelotyping.', 'Genetic aberrations in prostate carcinoma detected by comparative genomic hybridization and microsatellite analysis: association with progression and angiogenesis.', 'Chromosomal aberrations in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular cytogenetics of prostate cancer.', 'Chromosomal basis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Prognostic Values of Gene Copy Number Alterations in Prostate Cancer.', 'Chromosome-specific segment size alterations are determinants of prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Harnessing transcriptionally driven chromosomal instability adaptation to target therapy-refractory lethal prostate cancer.', 'Association of self-identified race and genetic ancestry with the immunogenomic landscape of primary prostate cancer.', 'High Levels of DEAH-Box Helicases Relate to Poor Prognosis and Reduction of DHX9 Improves Radiosensitivity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

The technological improvement had a significant clinical outcome for better response and lower toxicity to the surrounding normal tissues. Nowadays the incidence of rectal toxicity has been significantly decreased, especially with image guided radiation therapy (IGRT), whereas the dose escalation to the prostate has driven the clinical practice to the fact that radical radiotherapy for low or intermediate risk prostate cancer is definitely equivalent to surgery. The treatment volume can be reduced by reducing the size of the necessary margins to count for inaccuracies in target position and patient setup. This can be achieved either by improving the daily localization of the target before treatment or by adapting the treatment in response to feedback.

CAP family members are mostly secreted glycoproteins that are highly stable in the extracellular fluid. All members of the superfamily share a common CAP domain of approximately 150 amino acids, which adopts a unique α-β-α sandwich fold. The conserved structure suggests that CAP proteins exert fundamentally similar functions. However, the molecular mode of action of this protein family has remained enigmatic. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three CAP family members designated Pry (pathogen related in yeast), and recent evidence indicates that they act as sterol-binding and export proteins. Expression of the mammalian CAP protein CRISP2, which binds sterols in vitro, complements the sterol export defect of a yeast pry mutant, suggesting that sterol binding and export is conserved among different CAP family members. Collectively, these observations suggest that CAP family members constitute a novel class of secreted extracellular sterol-binding proteins. A ligand-binding activity of the CAP domain could explain many of the biological activities attributed to these proteins. For example, the strong induction of plant pathogenesis-related 1 protein upon exposure to pathogens may serve to inhibit pathogen proliferation by extracting sterols from the pathogen membrane. Similarly, the presence of these proteins in the venom of toxic insects and reptiles or in the secretome of pathogenic fungi might inflict damage by sequestering sterols or related small hydrophobic compounds from the host tissue.""","""['Roger Schneiter', 'Antonio Di Pietro']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biomol Concepts""","""['Prostate secretory protein 94 inhibits sterol binding and export by the mammalian CAP protein CRISP2 in a calcium-sensitive manner.', 'The function of yeast CAP family proteins in lipid export, mating, and pathogen defense.', 'The pathogen-related yeast protein Pry1, a member of the CAP protein superfamily, is a fatty acid-binding protein.', 'A Ligand-Binding Assay to Measure the Affinity and Specificity of Sterol-Binding Proteins In Vitro.', 'The functions of CAP superfamily proteins in mammalian fertility and disease.', 'Identification and Functional Analysis of CAP Genes from the Wheat Stripe Rust Fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici.', 'An informatic workflow for the enhanced annotation of excretory/secretory proteins of Haemonchus contortus.', 'The root pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches secretes modular proteases in pea apoplast during host infection.', 'The function of plant PR1 and other members of the CAP protein superfamily in plant-pathogen interactions.', 'Characterization and functional analyses of wheat TaPR1 genes in response to stripe rust fungal infection.']"""

However, the currently identified testosterone receptor(s) is not believed to underlie the fast signaling, suggesting an orphan pathway. Here we report that an ion channel from the transient receptor potential family, TRPM8, commonly known as the cold and menthol receptor is the major component of testosterone-induced rapid actions. Using cultured and primary cell lines along with the purified TRPM8 protein, we demonstrate that testosterone directly activates TRPM8 channel at low picomolar range. Specifically, testosterone induced TRPM8 responses in primary human prostate cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells, dorsal root ganglion neurons, and hippocampal neurons. Picomolar concentrations of testosterone resulted in full openings of the purified TRPM8 channel in planar lipid bilayers. Furthermore, acute applications of testosterone on human skin elicited a cooling sensation. Our data conclusively demonstrate that testosterone is an endogenous and highly potent agonist of TRPM8, suggesting a role of TRPM8 channels well beyond their well established function in somatosensory neurons.

We previously developed multivariate analysis of transcript splicing (MATS), a statistical method for detecting differential alternative splicing between two RNA-Seq samples. Here we describe a new statistical model and computer program, replicate MATS (rMATS), designed for detection of differential alternative splicing from replicate RNA-Seq data. rMATS uses a hierarchical model to simultaneously account for sampling uncertainty in individual replicates and variability among replicates. In addition to the analysis of unpaired replicates, rMATS also includes a model specifically designed for paired replicates between sample groups. The hypothesis-testing framework of rMATS is flexible and can assess the statistical significance over any user-defined magnitude of splicing change. The performance of rMATS is evaluated by the analysis of simulated and real RNA-Seq data. rMATS outperformed two existing methods for replicate RNA-Seq data in all simulation settings, and RT-PCR yielded a high validation rate (94%) in an RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Our data also provide guiding principles for designing RNA-Seq studies of alternative splicing. We demonstrate that it is essential to incorporate biological replicates in the study design. Of note, pooling RNAs or merging RNA-Seq data from multiple replicates is not an effective approach to account for variability, and the result is particularly sensitive to outliers. The rMATS source code is freely available at rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net/.

Chromosomal translocations fusing ETS factors to promoters of androgen responsive genes have been found in prostate cancers, including the most clinically aggressive forms. ERG and ETV1 are the most commonly translocated ETS proteins. Over-expression of these proteins in prostate cancer cells results in a more invasive phenotype. Inhibition of ETS activity by small molecule inhibitors may provide a novel method for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods and findings:   We recently demonstrated that the small molecule YK-4-279 inhibits biological activity of ETV1 in fusion-positive prostate cancer cells leading to decreased motility and invasion in-vitro. Here, we present data from an in-vivo mouse xenograft model. SCID-beige mice were subcutaneously implanted with fusion-positive LNCaP-luc-M6 and fusion-negative PC-3M-luc-C6 tumors. Animals were treated with YK-4-279, and its effects on primary tumor growth and lung metastasis were evaluated. YK-4-279 treatment resulted in decreased growth of the primary tumor only in LNCaP-luc-M6 cohort. When primary tumors were grown to comparable sizes, YK-4-279 inhibited tumor metastasis to the lungs. Expression of ETV1 target genes MMP7, FKBP10 and GLYATL2 were reduced in YK-4-279 treated animals. ETS fusion-negative PC-3M-luc-C6 xenografts were unresponsive to the compound. Furthermore, YK-4-279 is a chiral molecule that exists as a racemic mixture of R and S enantiomers. We established that (S)-YK-4-279 is the active enantiomer in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrate that YK-4-279 is a potent inhibitor of ETV1 and inhibits both the primary tumor growth and metastasis of fusion positive prostate cancer xenografts. Therefore, YK-4-279 or similar compounds may be evaluated as a potential therapeutic tool for treatment of human prostate cancer at different stages.""","""['Said Rahim', 'Tsion Minas', 'Sung-Hyeok Hong', 'Sarah Justvig', 'Haydar Çelik', 'Yasemin Saygideger Kont', 'Jenny Han', 'Abraham T Kallarakal', 'Yali Kong', 'Michelle A Rudek', 'Milton L Brown', 'Bhaskar Kallakury', 'Jeffrey A Toretsky', 'Aykut Üren']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['ETS factors in prostate cancer.', 'YK-4-279 inhibits ERG and ETV1 mediated prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG fusion by translocation or interstitial deletion is highly relevant in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, but is bypassed in late-stage androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'Distinct classes of chromosomal rearrangements create oncogenic ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer.', 'ETS fusion genes in prostate cancer.', 'TK216 targets microtubules in Ewing sarcoma cells.', 'The DNA/RNA helicase DHX9 contributes to the transcriptional program of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Novel Targeted Therapeutic Strategies for Ewing Sarcoma.', 'ETS factors in prostate cancer.', 'YK-4-279 Attenuates Progression of Pre-Existing Pigmented Lesions to Nodular Melanoma in a Mouse Model.']"""

At the same time, individual epigenetic modifications have physiological functions in normal cells, and cancer cell specificity is considered difficult to achieve using a drug against a single epigenetic modification. To overcome this limitation, a combination of epigenetic modifications specifically or preferentially present in cancer cells is a candidate target. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate (i) the presence of a cancer cell-specific combination of epigenetic modifications by focusing on DNA methylation and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and (ii) the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of DNA demethylation and EZH2 inhibition. Analyses of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 in human colon, breast and prostate cancer cell lines revealed that 24.7±4.1% of DNA methylated genes had both DNA methylation and H3K27me3 (dual modification) in cancer cells, while it was 11.8±7.1% in normal cells. Combined treatment with a DNA demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) and an EZH2 inhibitor, GSK126, induced marked re-expression of genes with the dual modification, including known tumor-suppressor genes such as IGFBP7 and SFRP1, and showed an additive inhibitory effect on growth of cancer cells in vitro. Finally, an in vivo combined treatment with 5-aza-dC and GSK126 inhibited growth of xenograft tumors more efficiently than a single treatment with 5-aza-dC.

Methods:   Using the SEER-Medicare dataset, 3314 patients diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder and treated with RC alone or RC with PLND were identified. After propensity score matching to reduce potential selection bias, all cause mortality (ACM)-free and cancer specific mortality (CSM)-free survival rates were estimated. Multivariable regression models (MVA) addressed the effect of PLND on ACM and CSM. Subgroups analyses according to age and comorbidities were performed.  Results:   After matching, 688 and 688 patients treated with RC alone or RC with PLND remained. The 5-year ACM-free survival rate was 36 after RC alone and 45% after RC with PLND (p < 0001). In MVA, PLND exerted a protective effect on ACM (HR 0.77, p < 0.001). The 5-year CSM-free survival rate was 54 after RC alone and 65% after RC with PLND (p < 0.001). In MVA, PLND exerted a protective effect on CSM (HR 0.71, p < 0.001). Similar results were observed in younger (age ≤75) and healthier (CCI = 0) patients, where PLND exerted a protective effect on ACM (HR 0.64, p = 0.001) and CSM (HR 0.65, p = 0.01). Conversely, in older (age >75) and sicker (CCI ≥1) patients, PLND was not associated with ACM (HR 0.98, p = 0.8) or CSM (HR 1.01, p = 0.9).

Ten nanomolar R1881 triggers p27 Ser10 phosphorylation and its stabilization in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Activation of Rac and its downstream effector DYRK 1B is responsible for p27 Ser10 phosphorylation and cell quiescence. Ten nanomolar androgen also inhibits transformation induced by oncogenic Ras in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Overexpression of an AR mutant unable to interact with filamin A, use of a small peptide displacing AR/filamin A interaction, and filamin A knockdown indicate that the androgen-triggered AR/filamin A complex regulates the pathway leading to p27 Ser10 phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest. As the AR/filamin A complex is also responsible for migration stimulated by 10 nM androgen, our report shows that the androgen-triggered AR/filamin A complex controls, through Rac 1, the decision of cells to halt cell cycle and migration.

Its application is being expanded using adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments. Our objective was to evaluate the changes over time in anorectal function, urinary symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in patients who had TEM surgery for a rectal tumour.  Method:   Between September 2009 and October 2012, a consecutive series of 102 patients underwent TEM at a single institution. Patients were asked to fill out standardized questionnaires at baseline and then at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks after surgery. The QoL among these patients was assessed using one generic (EQ-5D) and two disease-specific [European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29] questionnaires. Anorectal and urinary symptoms were studied using the COlo-REctal Functional Outcome (COREFO) and the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) questionnaires, respectively.  Results:   The response rate was 90% (92/102 patients). Postoperative complications occurred in 14% (13/92) of patients. The general QoL (as assessed using the EQ-5D) was lower 6 and 12 weeks after TEM compared with baseline QoL (P < 0.05) but returned towards baseline after 26 weeks. Anorectal function (determined using the COREFO) was worse 6 weeks postoperatively (P < 0.01) but had normalized by 12 weeks. Urinary function (determined using the I-PSS) was not affected at any time point after surgery. The total COREFO score and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score were correlated with the deterioration in QoL.

Traditional approaches where expression of genes were treated independently suffer from low prediction accuracy and difficulty of biological interpretation. Current research efforts focus on integrating information on protein interactions through biochemical pathway datasets with expression profiles to propose pathway-based classifiers that can enhance disease diagnosis and prognosis. As most of the pathway activity inference methods in literature are either unsupervised or applied on two-class datasets, there is good scope to address such limitations by proposing novel methodologies.  Results:   A supervised multiclass pathway activity inference method using optimisation techniques is reported. For each pathway expression dataset, patterns of its constituent genes are summarised into one composite feature, termed pathway activity, and a novel mathematical programming model is proposed to infer this feature as a weighted linear summation of expression of its constituent genes. Gene weights are determined by the optimisation model, in a way that the resulting pathway activity has the optimal discriminative power with regards to disease phenotypes. Classification is then performed on the resulting low-dimensional pathway activity profile.  Conclusions:   The model was evaluated through a variety of published gene expression profiles that cover different types of disease. We show that not only does it improve classification accuracy, but it can also perform well in multiclass disease datasets, a limitation of other approaches from the literature. Desirable features of the model include the ability to control the maximum number of genes that may participate in determining pathway activity, which may be pre-specified by the user.

Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the prostatectomy Gleason score (pGS), pathological stage and lymph node involvement (LNI) in RP specimens. Preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, biopsy GS (bGS), and preoperative tumor, node, metastasis staging were used as basic variables to predict postoperative pathological characteristics. Preoperative serum lipid profiles were introduced as potential predictors. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine predictive efficacy. Significant differences in pathological characteristics were observed among patients with normal and abnormal total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, with the exception of pGS in the TG group. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that the odds ratio for high levels of TC for LNI compared with normal TC levels was 6.386 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.510-27.010), 3.270 (95% CI: 1.470-7.278) for high levels of TG for pT3-4 disease, and 2.670 (95% CI: 1.134-6.287) for high levels of LDL for pGS. The area under the ROC curve of the models with dyslipidemia was larger than that in models without dyslipidemia, in predicting pathological characteristics.

For Asn453Ser and Arg48Gly polymorphisms, significantly decreased endometrial cancer was observed among Caucasians. For Ala119Ser polymorphism, we found that individuals with the minor variant genotypes had a high risk of prostate cancer. For Leu432Val polymorphism, we found that individuals with the minor variant genotypes had a higher risk of endometrial cancer and lung cancer and had a lower risk of ovarian cancer. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that Leu432Val polymorphism is associated with ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and endometrial cancer risk; Asn453Ser and Arg48Gly polymorphisms are associated with endometrial cancer risk among Caucasians, Ala119Ser polymorphism is associated with prostate cancer risk, and Ala119Ser polymorphism is associated with breast cancer risk in Caucasians.

In recent studies, an elevated plasma fibrinogen level has been associated with poor prognosis in different types of cancer. The present study was performed to analyse the prognostic impact of an elevated fibrinogen level in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   We evaluated data from 268 prostate cancer patients who underwent 3D conformal radiotherapy between 1999 and 2006 at a single tertiary academic center. Cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), and clinical disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were performed for each endpoint.  Results:   Applying receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, the optimal cut-off level for the plasma fibrinogen level was 530 mg dl(-1), respectively. Univariable (HR 3.638, 95 % CI 1.15-11.47, p = 0.027) and multivariable analyses (HR 3.964, 95 % CI 1.06-14.87, p = 0.041) revealed a significant correlation between increased plasma fibrinogen and CSS. Univariable analysis also showed a significant association between the elevated plasma fibrinogen level and decreased OS (HR 3.242, 95 % CI 1.53-6.89, p = 0.002), that remained significant in multivariable analysis (HR 3.215, 95 % CI 1.44-7.19, p = 0.004). No significant associations were found for clinical DFS.  Conclusion:   Although our data show a significant association between an elevated plasma fibrinogen level and poor prostate cancer prognosis, they have to be interpreted cautiously. Limitations of the present study are caused by its retrospective design, the limited accuracy obtained using ROC curve analysis, and potential confounding factors like cardiovascular disease and inflammatory diseases that have not been accounted for.""","""['Eva-Maria Thurner', 'Sabine Krenn-Pilko', 'Uwe Langsenlehner', 'Tatjana Stojakovic', 'Martin Pichler', 'Armin Gerger', 'Karin S Kapp', 'Tanja Langsenlehner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['The elevated C-reactive protein level is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.', 'An elevated preoperative plasma fibrinogen level is associated with poor disease-specific and overall survival in breast cancer patients.', 'Pretreatment plasma fibrinogen as an independent prognostic indicator of prostate cancer patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Prognostic role of pretreatment plasma fibrinogen in patients with solid tumors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prognostic Role of Pretreatment Plasma D-Dimer in Patients with Solid Tumors: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Development and validation of a nomogram based on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and fibrinogen-to-lymphocyte ratio for predicting recurrence of colorectal adenoma.', 'Elevated Serum FGG Levels Prognosticate and Promote the Disease Progression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Preoperative risk stratification using plasma fibrinogen levels can predict lymphovascular invasion and poor prognosis in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma.', 'Grading Evolution and Contemporary Prognostic Biomarkers of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Systemic Coagulation Markers Especially Fibrinogen Are Closely Associated with the Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer in Patients Who Underwent Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Biopsy.']"""

Background:   Patients with initial emergency presentation of malignancy have been documented to have poorer treatment outcomes and shorter survival. Patient level data on this subject is relatively limited with regard to the demographics, diagnoses and the clinical factors that may underlie late presentations.  Methods:   A 15 month audit of the patients presenting with a new diagnosis of malignancy was performed in 2011-2012. Data on demographics, diagnosis and outcome were assembled and analysed. The clinical data on emergency presentations were compared to reference information on the incidence and median age at presentation for each malignancy within the standard population.  Results:   During the study a total of 178 new cancer patients presented via the A and E service. The most frequent diagnoses were lung cancer with 21% of cases and CNS and colorectal cancer each with 9% of cases. There was a higher incidence of emergency new presentations of lung cancer, CNS tumours, ovarian, pancreatic and testicular cancer than in the standard population, whilst breast cancer, bladder cancer and prostate cancer patients were under-represented. The median age at diagnosis was 74 and for a number of malignancies including CNS tumours, breast cancer, colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer the emergency cases presented at significantly greater ages than in the standard population. Overall 27% of patients were unfit or unsuitable for a diagnostic biopsy, this group had only a 3 month median survival compared to 14 months for those suitable for biopsy and treatment.  Conclusion:   Despite a wide range of initiatives, the emergency and late diagnosis of patients with metastatic cancer remains a significant challenge with many patients too advanced and unwell at presentation for active treatment. These patients tend to be older and have malignancies that present with either non-specific symptoms or symptoms requiring acute assessment. Improving the pathways for these patients will be challenging and require additional planning on improving awareness and access for these potentially hard to reach patients.""","""['Philip Savage', 'Rachel Sharkey', 'Teresa Kua', 'Panagiotis Papanastasopoulos', 'Zoe McDonald-Burrows', 'Shazalia Hassan', 'Fay Probst', 'Ali Sanders', 'Hugh Millington']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Aspects of survival from colorectal cancer in Denmark.', 'Pattern of oncologic emergencies seen in adult cancer patients attending the Radiotherapy and Oncology Centre, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria - Nigeria.', 'Emergency first presentation of colorectal cancer predicts significantly poorer outcomes: a review of 356 consecutive Irish patients.', 'Rare extragonadal teratomas in children: complete tumor excision as a reliable and essential procedure for significant survival.

Firstly, we present a novel approach to AUHB-DWR that aims to improve image quality. We formulate the reconstruction of an apparent DW image as a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) in which tissue model diffusion parameters act as hidden states in this random field. The second contribution of this paper is a new generation of fully connected conditional random fields, called the hidden stochastically fully connected conditional random fields (HSFCRF) that allows for efficient inference with significantly reduced computational complexity via stochastic clique structures. The proposed AUHB-DWR algorithms, HCRF and HSFCRF, are evaluated quantitatively in nine different patient cases using Fisher's criteria, probability of error, and coefficient of variation metrics to validate its effectiveness for the purpose of improving intensity delineation between expert identified suspected cancerous and healthy tissue within the prostate gland. The proposed methods are also examined using a prostate phantom, where the apparent ultra-high b-value DW images reconstructed using the tested AUHB-DWR methods are compared with real captured UHB-DWI. The results illustrate that the proposed AUHB-DWR methods has improved reconstruction quality and improved intensity delineation compared with existing AUHB-DWR approaches.""","""['Mohammad Javad Shafiee', 'Shahid A Haider', 'Alexander Wong', 'Dorothy Lui', 'Andrew Cameron', 'Ameen Modhafar', 'Paul Fieguth', 'Masoom A Haider']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Noise-Compensated, Bias-Corrected Diffusion Weighted Endorectal Magnetic Resonance Imaging via a Stochastically Fully-Connected Joint Conditional Random Field Model.', 'High and ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging in prostate cancer: a quantitative analysis.', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging of the prostate: Comparison of b1000 and b2000 image sets for index lesion detection.', 'Monte Carlo bias field correction in endorectal diffusion imaging.', 'Comparison of apparent diffusion coefficient calculation between two-point and multipoint B value analyses in prostate cancer and benign prostate tissue at 3 T: preliminary experience.', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma or Oncocytoma?

The standard of care for this treatment procedure is to acquire transrectal ultrasound images of the prostate in order to devise a plan to deliver sufficient radiation dose to the cancerous tissue. Brachytherapy planning involves delineation of contours in these images, which closely follow the prostate boundary, i.e., clinical target volume. This process is currently performed either manually or semi-automatically, which requires user interaction for landmark initialization. In this paper, we propose a multi-atlas fusion framework to automatically delineate the clinical target volume in ultrasound images. A dataset of a priori segmented ultrasound images, i.e., atlases, is registered to a target image. We introduce a pairwise atlas agreement factor that combines an image-similarity metric and similarity between a priori segmented contours. This factor is used in an atlas selection algorithm to prune the dataset before combining the atlas contours to produce a consensus segmentation.

The expression status and functional relevance of PIAS1 was evaluated in primary tumors, in metastatic lesions, in tissue of patients after docetaxel chemotherapy, and in docetaxel resistant cells. Patient data were complemented by functional studies on PIAS1 knockdown in vitro as well as in chicken chorioallantoic membrane and mouse xenograft in vivo models. PIAS1 was found to be overexpressed in local and metastatic PCa and its expression was further elevated in tumors after docetaxel treatment as well as in docetaxel resistant cells. Furthermore, PIAS1 knockdown experiments revealed an increased expression of tumor suppressor p21 and declined expression of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl1, which caused diminished cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.

Several novel treatments have been adopted by healthcare systems to manage PCa. Most of the observational studies and randomized trials on PCa have concurrently evaluated fewer treatments over short follow-up. Further, preceding decision analytic models on PCa management have not evaluated various contemporary management options. Therefore, a contemporary decision analytic model was necessary to address limitations to the literature by synthesizing the evidence on novel treatments thereby forecasting short and long-term clinical outcomes.  Objectives:   To develop and validate a Markov Monte Carlo model for the contemporary clinical management of PCa, and to assess the clinical burden of the disease from diagnosis to end-of-life.  Methods:   A Markov Monte Carlo model was developed to simulate the management of PCa in men 65 years and older from diagnosis to end-of-life. Health states modeled were: risk at diagnosis, active surveillance, active treatment, PCa recurrence, PCa recurrence free, metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, overall and PCa death. Treatment trajectories were based on state transition probabilities derived from the literature. Validation and sensitivity analyses assessed the accuracy and robustness of model predicted outcomes.  Results:   Validation indicated model predicted rates were comparable to observed rates in the published literature. The simulated distribution of clinical outcomes for the base case was consistent with sensitivity analyses. Predicted rate of clinical outcomes and mortality varied across risk groups. Life expectancy and health adjusted life expectancy predicted for the simulated cohort was 20.9 years (95%CI 20.5-21.3) and 18.2 years (95% CI 17.9-18.5), respectively.  Conclusion:   Study findings indicated contemporary management strategies improved survival and quality of life in patients with PCa.

The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using APT-NPs to deliver micro RNA (miRNA) systemically to PCa cells, to testify their tumor-targeting efficiency, and to observe their biodistribution after systemic administration to a xenograft mouse model of PCa. In addition, the effect of APT depletion and endocytosis inhibitors on cellular uptake was also evaluated quantitatively in LNCaP cells to explore the internalization mechanism of APT-NPs. Finally, blood chemistry, and renal and liver function parameters were measured in the xenograft mouse model of PCa to see whether APT-NPs had any demonstrable toxicity in mice in vivo. The results showed that APT-NPs prolonged the survival duration of the PCa tumor-bearing mice as compared with the unmodified NPs. In addition, they had a potential PCa-targeting effect in vivo.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a member of this cluster, miR-17, on cardiac senescence. We examined the roles of miR-17 in senescence and demonstrated that miR-17-3p attenuates cardiac aging in the myocardium by targeting Par4 (also known as PAWR). This upregulates the downstream proteins CEBPB, FAK, N-cadherin, vimentin, Oct4 and Sca-1 (also known as stem cell antigen-1), and downregulates E-cadherin. Par4 has been reported as a tumor suppressor gene that induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. Repression of Par4 by miR-17-3p enhances the transcription of CEBPB and FAK, which promotes mouse cardiac fibroblast (MCF) epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and self-renewal, resulting in cellular senescence and apoptosis resistance. We conclude that Par4 can bind to the CEBPB promoter and inhibit its transcription. Decreased Par4 expression increases the amount of CEBPB, which binds to the FAK promoter and enhances FAK transcription. Par4, CEBPB and FAK form a senescence signaling pathway, playing roles in modulating cell survival, growth, apoptosis, EMT and self-renewal. Through this novel senescence signaling axis, miR-17-3p represses Par4 expression, acting pleiotropically as a negative modulator of cardiac aging and cardiac fibroblast cellular senescence.""","""['William W Du', 'Xianmin Li', 'Tianbi Li', 'Haoran Li', 'Azam Khorshidi', 'Fengqiong Liu', 'Burton B Yang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['microRNA-125a-3p reduces cell proliferation and migration by targeting Fyn.', 'p16INK4A induces senescence and inhibits EMT through microRNA-141/microRNA-146b-5p-dependent repression of AUF1.', 'MiR-15/16 complex targets p70S6 kinase 1 and controls cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'MiRNA Deregulation in Cardiac Aging and Associated Disorders.', 'Investigating the expression level of miR-17-3p, miR-101-3p, miR-335-3p, and miR-296-3p in the peripheral blood of patients with acute myocardial infarction.', 'MicroRNAs in Age-Related Proteostasis and Stress Responses.', 'Role of noncoding RNAs in cardiac ageing.', 'Identifying MicroRNA Markers That Predict COVID-19 Severity Using Machine Learning Methods.', 'TMAO Upregulates Members of the miR-17/92 Cluster and Impacts Targets Associated with Atherosclerosis.']"""

In breast carcinoma, the CSCs have been identified as a CD44+/CD24- cell population. These rare cells are able to grow as non-adherent sphere-like structures, termed ""mammospheres"", which enables their isolation and expansion in culture. To design efficient strategies for the complete eradication of CSCs, it is important to identify enzymes and proteins that are known as anti-cancer targets, and differ in their properties from those present in the none CSCs. Here we investigated the activity and expression of type I and type II DNA topoisomerases (topo I and topo II) in CSCs and their response to anti-topoisomerase inhibitors.  Methods:   MCF7 breast cancer cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells and 4 T1-Luc-Oct3/4pG mouse mammary carcinoma cells were grown on low-attachment dishes in specific medium and allowed to form spheres. Enrichment of CSC population was verified by immunostaining, flow cytometry or fluorescent microscopy imaging. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared and topoisomerases activity and protein levels were determined. Cell viability was examined by the MTT and Neutral Red assays.  Results:   Unlike the adherent MCF7 cell line, topo I activity is decreased and topo II activity is increased in the CSCs. However, the relative levels of the enzyme proteins were similar in both mammospheres and adherent cells. Topo I activity in mammospheres is regulated, at least in part, by PARP-1, as observed by the recovery of topo I activity after treatment with PARP-1 inhibitor 3-Aminobenzamide. Mammosphere-derived cells show reduced sensitivity to topo I inhibitor, camptothecin, and increased sensitivity to topo II inhibitor etoposide. Intact mammospheres show increased resistance to both drugs. A combined treatment of intact mammospheres with either CPT and gefitinib, or etoposide and erlotinib, increased the anti-cancer effect of both drugs.  Conclusions:   The data of this study suggest that the understanding of biological behavior of essential enzymes such as topoisomerases, in CSCs' progression and early stages of tumor development, is important for developing new strategies for cancer treatment as well as new therapies for advanced disease.""","""['Refael Peleg', 'Marianna Romzova', 'Inga Kogan-Zviagin', 'Ron N Apte', 'Esther Priel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Evodiamine, a dual catalytic inhibitor of type I and II topoisomerases, exhibits enhanced inhibition against camptothecin resistant cells.', 'Topoisomerase I as a target of erlotinib and gefitinib: efficacy of combined treatments with camptothecin.', 'Complex response of breast epithelial cell lines to topoisomerase inhibitors.', 'Recent advances in the development of dual topoisomerase I and II inhibitors as anticancer drugs.', 'DNA topoisomerases targeting anticancer agents and mechanism for acquirement of drug resistance.', 'An integrated multi-omics analysis of topoisomerase family in pan-cancer: Friend or foe?', 'Ki-67, topoisomerase IIα and miR-221 have a limited prostate cancer risk stratification ability on a medium-term follow-up: results of a high-risk radical prostatectomy cohort.', 'Identification and Verification of the Main Differentially Expressed Proteins in Gastric Cancer via iTRAQ Combined with Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.', 'Cellular communication promotes mammosphere growth and collective invasion through microtubule‑like structures and angiogenesis.', 'Gefitinib enhances sensitivity of endometrial cancer cells to progestin therapy via dual-specificity phosphatase 1.']"""

Our analysis included three stages: (1) identifying the linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks and performing genome-wide haplotype association scan, (2) mapping PC-risk haplotypes to PC candidate genes, and (3) prioritizing PC candidate genes based on their similarity to known PC susceptibility genes.

Methods:   A clinical HIFU system (InSightec ExAblate 2000) integrated with a 1.5 T GE MR scanner was used in this study. Suitable ultrasound parameters were investigated to perform nonthermal sonications, keeping the temperature elevation below 4 °C as measured in real time by MR thermometry. LNCaP cells (10(6)) were injected into the prostates of male mice (n = 20). When tumors reached a diameter of about 5 mm in 3D as measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the tumor-bearing mice (n = 8) were treated with pFUS (1 MHz frequency; 25 W acoustic power; 0.1 duty cycle; 60 s duration). A total of 4-6 sonications were used to cover the entire tumor volume under MR image guidance. The animals were allowed to survive for 4 weeks after the treatment. The tumor growth was monitored on high-resolution (0.2 mm) MRI weekly post treatment and was compared with that of the control group (n = 12).  Results:   Significant tumor growth delay was observed in the tumor-bearing mice treated with pFUS. The mean tumor volume for the pFUS treated mice remained the same 1 week after the treatment while the mean tumor volume of the control mice grew 42% over the same time. Two weeks after the pFUS treatment, the control group had a mean tumor volume 40% greater than that of the treated group. There was a greater variation in tumor volume at 4 weeks post treatment for both treated and control mice and a slightly faster tumor growth for the pFUS treated mice.  Conclusions:   The authors' results demonstrated that pFUS may have a great potential for cancer therapy.

However, small molecule kinase inhibitors that target this signaling pathway have limited efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth, primarily due to compensatory survival signals through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Although members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or HER, family of RTKs are strongly implicated in the development and progression of prostate cancer, targeting individual members of this family such as EGFR or HER2 has resulted in limited success in clinical trials. Multiple studies indicate a critical role for HER3 in the development of resistance against both HER-targeted therapies and PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors. In this study, we found that the growth inhibitory effect of GDC-0941, a class I PI3K inhibitor, is markedly reduced in the presence of heregulin. Interestingly, this effect is more pronounced in cells lacking phosphatase and tensin homolog function. Heregulin-mediated resistance to GDC-0941 is associated with reactivation of Akt downstream of HER3 phosphorylation.

Biomechanical material properties are important components of a biomechanical model. In this study, the effect of incorporating tumor-specific material properties in the prostate biomechanical model was investigated to provide insight into the potential impact of material heterogeneity on the prostate deformation calculations. First, a simple spherical prostate and tumor model was used to analytically describe the deformations and demonstrate the fundamental effect of changes in the tumor volume and stiffness in the modeled deformation. Next, using a clinical prostate model, a parametric approach was used to describe the variations in the heterogeneous prostate model by changing tumor volume, stiffness, and location, to show the differences in the modeled deformation between heterogeneous and homogeneous prostate models. Finally, five clinical prostatectomy examples were used in separately performed homogeneous and heterogeneous biomechanical model based registrations to describe the deformations between 3D reconstructed histopathology images and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging, and examine the potential clinical impact of modeling biomechanical heterogeneity of the prostate. The analytical formulation showed that increasing the tumor volume and stiffness could significantly increase the impact of the heterogeneous prostate model in the calculated displacement differences compared to the homogeneous model. The parametric approach using a single prostate model indicated up to 4.8 mm of displacement difference at the tumor boundary compared to a homogeneous model. Such differences in the deformation of the prostate could be potentially clinically significant given the voxel size of the ex vivo MR images (0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm). However, no significant changes in the registration accuracy were observed using heterogeneous models for the limited number of clinical prostatectomy patients modeled and evaluated in this study.""","""['Navid Samavati', 'Deirdre M McGrath', 'Michael A S Jewett', 'Theo van der Kwast', 'Cynthia Ménard', 'Kristy K Brock']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Biomechanical modeling constrained surface-based image registration for prostate MR guided TRUS biopsy.', 'A GPU based high-resolution multilevel biomechanical head and neck model for validating deformable image registration.', 'Model-based registration of ex vivo and in vivo MRI of the prostate using elastography*.', 'A survey of prostate modeling for image analysis.', 'Biomechanical modeling and computer simulation of the brain during neurosurgery.', 'Bladder biomechanics and the use of scaffolds for regenerative medicine in the urinary bladder.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection with a Tactile Resonance Sensor-Measurement Considerations and Clinical Setup.', 'Personalized heterogeneous deformable model for fast volumetric registration.', 'MR elastography to measure the effects of cancer and pathology fixation on prostate biomechanics, and comparison with T 1, T 2 and ADC.']"""

Our aims are, to prospectively analyse the management of urinary retention, the associated difficulties, and complications in our setting, where access to investigative modalities such as Computerize Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging are not available.  Patients and methods:   The study was approved by the University Of Calabar Teaching Hospital ethical committee. A validated Proforma was used to collect data from all patients who were clinically diagnosed with urinary retention based on history, and physical examination, from July 2009 to June 2010. Data collected from the 1st of July 2009 to the 30th of June 2010, include demographics, findings on physical examination, previous medical history and co-morbid conditions.

Such markers can help clinicians identify types of cancer or stages of progression, and they can guide in tailoring specific therapies. Many efforts to identify biomarkers consider genes that mutate between normal and cancerous tissues or changes in protein or RNA expression levels. Here we define location biomarkers, proteins that undergo changes in subcellular location that are indicative of disease. To discover such biomarkers, we have developed an automated pipeline to compare the subcellular location of proteins between two sets of immunohistochemistry images. We used the pipeline to compare images of healthy and tumor tissue from the Human Protein Atlas, ranking hundreds of proteins in breast, liver, prostate, and bladder based on how much their location was estimated to have changed. The performance of the system was evaluated by determining whether proteins previously known to change location in tumors were ranked highly. We present a number of candidate location biomarkers for each tissue, and identify biochemical pathways that are enriched in proteins that change location. The analysis technology is anticipated to be useful not only for discovering new location biomarkers but also for enabling automated analysis of biomarker distributions as an aid to determining diagnosis.""","""['Aparna Kumar', 'Arvind Rao', 'Santosh Bhavani', 'Justin Y Newberg', 'Robert F Murphy']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Automated classification of protein subcellular localization in immunohistochemistry images to reveal biomarkers in colon cancer.', 'Bioimaging-based detection of mislocalized proteins in human cancers by semi-supervised learning.', 'Automated detection of regions of interest for tissue microarray experiments: an image texture analysis.', 'Automated, systematic determination of protein subcellular location using fluorescence microscopy.', 'Analysis of protein biomarkers in human clinical tumor samples: critical aspects to success from tissue acquisition to analysis.', 'A review from biological mapping to computation-based subcellular localization.', 'Automated classification of protein expression levels in immunohistochemistry images to improve the detection of cancer biomarkers.', 'The Studies of Prognostic Factors and the Genetic Polymorphism of Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase C667T in Thymic Epithelial Tumors.', 'Parallel analysis of transcription, integration, and sequence of single HIV-1 proviruses.', 'Bird Eye View of Protein Subcellular Localization Prediction.']"""

The persistence of AR activity via both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent mechanisms (including constitutively active AR splice variants) highlights the unmet need for alternative approaches to block AR signaling in CRPC. We investigated the transcription factor GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2) as a regulator of AR signaling and an actionable therapeutic target in PC. We demonstrate that GATA2 directly promotes expression of both full-length and splice-variant AR, resulting in a strong positive correlation between GATA2 and AR expression in both PC cell lines and patient specimens. Conversely, GATA2 expression is repressed by androgen and AR, suggesting a negative feedback regulatory loop that, upon androgen deprivation, derepresses GATA2 to contribute to AR overexpression in CRPC. Simultaneously, GATA2 is necessary for optimal transcriptional activity of both full-length and splice-variant AR. GATA2 colocalizes with AR and Forkhead box protein A1 on chromatin to enhance recruitment of steroid receptor coactivators and formation of the transcriptional holocomplex. In agreement with these important functions, high GATA2 expression and transcriptional activity predicted worse clinical outcome in PC patients. A GATA2 small molecule inhibitor suppressed the expression and transcriptional function of both full-length and splice-variant AR and exerted potent anticancer activity against PC cell lines.

Evidence for rarer cancers and for type 1 diabetes is limited. We explored the excess risk of site-specific cancer incidence and mortality among people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, compared with the general Australian population.  Research design and methods:   Registrants of a national diabetes registry (953,382) between 1997 and 2008 were linked to national death and cancer registries. Standardized incidence and mortality ratios (SIRs/SMRs) are reported.  Results:   For type 1 diabetes, significant elevated SIRs were observed for pancreas, liver, esophagus, colon and rectum (females only [F]), stomach (F), thyroid (F), brain (F), lung (F), endometrium, and ovary, and decreased SIRs were observed for prostate in males. Significantly increased SMRs were observed for pancreas, liver, and kidney (males only), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, brain (F), and endometrium. For type 2 diabetes, significant SIRs were observed for almost all site-specific cancers, with highest SIRs observed for liver and pancreas, and decreased risks for prostate and melanoma. Significant SMRs were observed for liver, pancreas, kidney, Hodgkin's lymphoma, gallbladder (F), stomach (F), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (F). Cancer risk was significantly elevated throughout follow-up time but was higher in the first 3 months postregistration, suggesting the presence of detection bias and/or reverse causation.

Methods and materials:   We retrospectively analyzed our database of 253 patients with Stage T1-T3 N0M0 PC who underwent brachytherapy with temporary brachytherapy plus EBRT. All patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation for a median of 6 months. Treatment consisted of three pulses of pseudo pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy to a median dose of 18Gy with 50.4Gy in 28 fractions of EBRT. Treatment took place between December 1999 and March 2006.  Results:   At a median of 6-years followup, nPSA value was a predictor of biochemical control. Rising nPSA categories of <0.01, 0.01-<0.05, 0.05-≤0.1, 0.1-≤ 1.0, or >1.0 ng/mL correlated with a deteriorating 5-year biochemical control (nBED) by the Phoenix definition of 100%, 90.0%, 82.5%, 64.3%, and 10%, respectively. A highly statistically significant relationship between nPSA value and subsequent clinical failure is also demonstrated. The relationship between TnPSA and nBED was strongly significant (p<0.0001), with a significantly longer nPSA for patients who had Phoenix nBED. A PSA of <1.5 ng/mL achieved 3-year post radiation therapy was prognostic for biochemical and clinical disease control (p<0.0001).

In this investigation we demonstrate that sulforaphane induces posttranslational modification of histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 in metastatic, androgen receptor-negative PC3 prostate cancer cells. Sulforaphane stimulates ubiquitination and acetylation of SUV39H1 within a C-terminal nuclear localization signal peptide motif and coincides with its dissociation from chromatin and a decrease in global trimethyl-histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) levels. Exogenous SUV39H1 expression leads to an increase in H3K9me3 and decreases sulforaphane-induced apoptotic signaling.

However, the methylation status of protocadherin8 and its clinical significance in prostate cancer remains largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of protocadherin8 methylation in early-stage prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   The promoter methylation status of protocadherin8 in 162 prostate cancer tissues and 47 normal prostate tissues was examined using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Subsequently, the relationships between protocadherin8 methylation and clinicopathological features of prostate cancer patients and biochemical recurrence-free survival of patients were analyzed.  Results:   We found that protocadherin8 methylation occurred frequently in prostate cancer tissues but not in normal prostate tissues. Moreover, protocadherin8 methylation was significantly associated with advanced pathologic stage, higher level of preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA), higher Gleason score, positive lymph node metastasis, and biochemical recurrence. In addition, patients with protocadherin8 methylated have shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival time than patients without. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that protocadherin8 methylation was an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients.

In gastric cancer, it has been demonstrated that periglandular periostin expression is decreased whereas stromal periostin expression is significantly increased as compared with normal gastric tissues. Moreover, periostin produced by stromal myofibroblasts markedly promotes gastric cancer cell growth. These observations suggest that periostin derived from different types of cells may play distinct biological roles in gastric tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the biological functions and related molecular mechanisms of epithelial cell-derived periostin in gastric cancer. Our data showed that periglandular periostin was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues as compared with matched normal gastric mucosa. In addition, its expression in metastatic lymph nodes was significantly lower than that in their primary cancer tissues. Our data also demonstrated that periglandular periostin expression was negatively associated with tumor stage. More importantly, restoration of periostin expression in gastric cancer cells dramatically suppressed cell growth and invasiveness. Elucidation of the mechanisms involved revealed that periostin restoration enhanced Rb phosphorylation and sequentially activated the transcription of E2F1 target gene p14(ARF), leading to Mdm2 inactivation and the stabilization of p53 and E-cadherin proteins. Strikingly, these effects of periostin were abolished upon Rb deletion.

However, the possible links and underlying mechanisms between P2X7 and prostate cancer have not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that P2X7 was highly expressed in some prostate cancer cells. Down-regulation of P2X7 by siRNA significantly attenuated ATP- or BzATP-driven migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and inhibited tumor invasiveness and metastases in nude mice. In addition, silencing of P2X7 remarkably attenuated ATP- or BzATP- driven expression changes of EMT/invasion-related genes Snail, E-cadherin, Claudin-1, IL-8 and MMP-3, and weakened the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 in vitro.

Prostate cancer cells colonize preferentially bone (osteotropism), where they alter the physiological balance between osteoblast-mediated bone formation and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and elicit prevalently an osteoblastic response (osteoinduction). The molecular cues provided by osteoblasts for the survival and growth of bone metastatic prostate cancer cells are largely unknown. We exploited the sufficient divergence between human and mouse RNA sequences together with redefinition of highly species-specific gene arrays by computer-aided and experimental exclusion of cross-hybridizing oligonucleotide probes. This strategy allowed the dissection of the stroma (mouse) from the cancer cell (human) transcriptome in bone metastasis xenograft models of human osteoinductive prostate cancer cells (VCaP and C4-2B). As a result, we generated the osteoblastic bone metastasis-associated stroma transcriptome (OB-BMST). Subtraction of genes shared by inflammation, wound healing and desmoplastic responses, and by the tissue type-independent stroma responses to a variety of non-osteotropic and osteotropic primary cancers generated a curated gene signature (""Core"" OB-BMST) putatively representing the bone marrow/bone-specific stroma response to prostate cancer-induced, osteoblastic bone metastasis. The expression pattern of three representative Core OB-BMST genes (PTN, EPHA3 and FSCN1) seems to confirm the bone specificity of this response. A robust induction of genes involved in osteogenesis and angiogenesis dominates both the OB-BMST and Core OB-BMST. This translates in an amplification of hematopoietic and, remarkably, prostate epithelial stem cell niche components that may function as a self-reinforcing bone metastatic niche providing a growth support specific for osteoinductive prostate cancer cells. The induction of this combinatorial stem cell niche is a novel mechanism that may also explain cancer cell osteotropism and local interference with hematopoiesis (myelophthisis). Accordingly, these stem cell niche components may represent innovative therapeutic targets and/or serum biomarkers in osteoblastic bone metastasis.""","""['Berna C Özdemir', 'Janine Hensel', 'Chiara Secondini', 'Antoinette Wetterwald', 'Ruth Schwaninger', 'Achim Fleischmann', 'Wolfgang Raffelsberger', 'Olivier Poch', 'Mauro Delorenzi', 'Ramzi Temanni', 'Ian G Mills', 'Gabri van der Pluijm', 'George N Thalmann', 'Marco G Cecchini']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prostate cancer cells-osteoblast interaction shifts expression of growth/survival-related genes in prostate cancer and reduces expression of osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts.', 'Discoidin domain receptor 2 facilitates prostate cancer bone metastasis via regulating parathyroid hormone-related protein.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion expression regulates bone markers and enhances the osteoblastic phenotype of prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'The role of tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Mechanism of osteoblastic bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Establishment of cancer-associated fibroblasts-related subtypes and prognostic index for prostate cancer through single-cell and bulk RNA transcriptome.', 'Procoxacin bidirectionally inhibits osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity in bone and suppresses bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Heterogeneity, Activation and Function: Implications for Prostate Cancer.', '""Stromal cells in prostate cancer pathobiology: friends or foes?"".', 'Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence Based on Molecular Detection of Lymph Node Metastasis After Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Here we show that the gene encoding BAZ2A (TIP5), a factor previously implicated in epigenetic rRNA gene silencing, is overexpressed in prostate cancer and is paradoxically involved in maintaining prostate cancer cell growth, a feature specific to cancer cells. BAZ2A regulates numerous protein-coding genes and directly interacts with EZH2 to maintain epigenetic silencing at genes repressed in metastasis. BAZ2A overexpression is tightly associated with a molecular subtype displaying a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Finally, high BAZ2A levels serve as an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in a cohort of 7,682 individuals with prostate cancer.

Data from the literature show promising oncological outcomes with a favourable side-effect profile. The aim of this study was to re-evaluate and bring up to date the follow-up of a previously published, prospective trial on HIFU as the primary treatment for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Between 2004 and 2007, 163 consecutive men with T1-T3N0M0 prostate cancer underwent HIFU with the Sonablate 500. Follow-up included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests every 3 months after treatment and a random prostate biopsy at 6 months. Failure was defined according to positive findings at the 6 month biopsy and biochemical failure was defined according to the Phoenix criteria. Biochemical-free survival, metastasis-free survival and cancer-specific survival were calculated by Kaplan-Meier curves.  Results:   Median follow-up was 72.0 months. Of the 160 evaluable patients, 104 (65%) were biochemically disease free; in low- to intermediate-risk disease, on Kaplan-Meier analysis the 8 year biochemical-non-evidence of disease (bNED), metastasis-free survival and cancer-specific survival rates were 69.6%, 81.3%, 100% and 40.5%, 60.6%, 100%, respectively.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of SGK-1 inhibition in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  Experimental design:   Human head and neck tumors (HTB41/43) were established in athymic mice. Growth rates between mice treated with vehicle (PBS) injection (group 1, n = 5), SGK-1 Inhibitor GSK 650394 (group 2, n = 6), systemic cisplatin (group 3, n = 6), and a combination of SGK-1 Inhibitor and cisplatin (group 4, n = 6) were compared using repeated measures one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Tumor cells were subsequently submitted to further analyses.  Results:   At the end of the experiment mean tumor sizes were 122.33+/-105.86, 76.73+/-36.09, 94.52+/-75.92, and 25.76+/-14.89 mm2 (mean +/- SD) for groups 1 to 4. Groups 2 and 3 showed decreased tumor growth compared to controls (p<0.001). Group 4 displayed even greater growth suppression (p<0.0001). Importantly, group 4 fared better than group 3 (p<0.001). CD44 expression was reduced in group 2 (p<0.05), and to an even greater extent in groups 3 and 4 (p<0.0025). A trend towards reduction of HER 2 expression was noted in group 4.  Conclusions:   SGK-1 inhibition suppresses tumor growth, and in combination with systemic cisplatin exceeds the effect of cisplatin alone.

Nevertheless, a significant fraction of tumors show no appreciable response to the treatment, while the others develop resistance and recur. Despite years of intense research, the mechanisms of taxane resistance in prostate cancer and other malignancies are poorly understood and remain a topic of intense investigation. We have used improved mutagenesis via random insertion of a strong promoter to search for events, which enable survival of prostate cancer cells after Taxol exposure. High-throughput mapping of the integration sites pointed to the PRKAR2A gene, which codes for a type II-α regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, as a candidate modulator of drug response. Both full-length and N-terminally truncated forms of the PRKAR2A gene product markedly increased survival of prostate cancer cells lines treated with Taxol and Taxotere. Suppression of protein kinase A enzymatic activity is the likely mechanism of action of the overexpressed proteins. Accordingly, protein kinase A inhibitor PKI (6-22) amide reduced toxicity of Taxol to prostate cancer cells.

Docetaxel inhibited tumor growth, AR nuclear localization, and AR-regulated gene expression in enzalutamide-naïve tumors, but did not in enzalutamide-resistant tumors, demonstrating in vivo cross-resistance. By contrast, cabazitaxel remained highly effective in enzalutamide-resistant tumors and demonstrated superior antitumor activity compared to docetaxel, independent of the AR pathway. These findings demonstrate that the AR pathway is able to confer in vivo cross-resistance between enzalutamide and docetaxel, but not cabazitaxel, in CRPC.

Objective:   To report a large multi-institutional series of minimally invasive SP (MISP).  Design, setting, and participants:   Consecutive cases of MISP done for the treatment of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) due to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) between 2000 and 2014 at 23 participating institutions in the Americas and Europe were included in this retrospective analysis.  Intervention:   Laparoscopic or robotic SP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Demographic data and main perioperative outcomes were gathered and analyzed. A multivariable analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with a favorable trifecta outcome, arbitrarily defined as a combination of the following postoperative events: International Prostate Symptom Score <8, maximum flow rate >15ml/s, and no perioperative complications.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 1330 consecutive cases were analyzed, including 487 robotic (36.6%) and 843 laparoscopic (63.4%) SP cases. Median overall prostate volume was 100ml (range: 89-128). Median estimated blood loss was 200ml (range: 150-300). An intraoperative transfusion was required in 3.5% of cases, an intraoperative complication was recorded in 2.2% of cases, and the conversion rate was 3%. Median length of stay was 4 d (range: 3-5). On pathology, prostate cancer was found in 4% of cases. Overall postoperative complication rate was 10.6%, mostly of low grade. At a median follow-up of 12 mo, a significant improvement was observed for subjective and objective indicators of BOO. Trifecta outcome was not significantly influenced by the type of procedure (robotic vs laparoscopic; p=0.136; odds ratio [OR]: 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-2.9), whereas operative time (p=0.01; OR: 0.9; 95% CI, 0.9-1.0) and estimated blood loss (p=0.03; OR: 0.9; 95% CI, 0.9-1.0) were the only two significant factors. Retrospective study design, lack of a control arm, and limited follow-up represent major limitations of the present analysis.  Conclusions:   This study provides the largest outcome analysis reported for MISP for BOO/BPE. These findings confirm that SP can be safely and effectively performed in a minimally invasive fashion in a variety of healthcare settings in which specific surgical expertise and technology is available. MISP can be considered a viable surgical treatment in cases of large prostatic adenomas. The use of robotic technology for this indication can be considered in centers that have a robotic program in place for other urologic indications.  Patient summary:   Analysis of a large data set from multiple institutions shows that surgical removal of symptomatic large prostatic adenomas can be carried out with good outcomes by using robot-assisted laparoscopy.""","""['Riccardo Autorino', 'Homayoun Zargar', 'Mirandolino B Mariano', 'Rafael Sanchez-Salas', 'René J Sotelo', 'Piotr L Chlosta', 'Octavio Castillo', 'Deliu V Matei', 'Antonio Celia', 'Gokhan Koc', 'Anup Vora', 'Monish Aron', 'J Kellogg Parsons', 'Giovannalberto Pini', 'James C Jensen', 'Douglas Sutherland', 'Xavier Cathelineau', 'Luciano A Nuñez Bragayrac', 'Ioannis M Varkarakis', 'Daniele Amparore', 'Matteo Ferro', 'Gaetano Gallo', 'Alessandro Volpe', 'Hakan Vuruskan', 'Gaurav Bandi', 'Jonathan Hwang', 'Josh Nething', 'Nic Muruve', 'Sameer Chopra', 'Nishant D Patel', 'Ithaar Derweesh', 'David Champ Weeks', 'Ryan Spier', 'Keith Kowalczyk', 'John Lynch', 'Andrew Harbin', 'Mohan Verghese', 'Srinivas Samavedi', 'Wilson R Molina', 'Emanuel Dias', 'Youness Ahallal', 'Humberto Laydner', 'Edward Cherullo', 'Ottavio De Cobelli', 'David D Thiel', 'Mikael Lagerkvist', 'Georges-Pascal Haber', 'Jihad Kaouk', 'Fernando J Kim', 'Estevao Lima', 'Vipul Patel', 'Wesley White', 'Alexander Mottrie', 'Francesco Porpiglia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Simple Prostatectomy: A Step Too Far for Laparoscopy?', 'Re: Riccardo Autorino, Homayoun Zagar, Mirandolino B.

Materials and methods:   From 2005 to 2013, the records of men who underwent UDS prior to artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) were reviewed. The histories, UDS, endoscopies, and anti-incontinence outcomes of men who failed to demonstrate incontinence on intubated UDS were recorded. In our UDS protocol, the urodynamic urethral catheter was removed and the UDS was repeated to elicit incontinence without the urethral catheter. The valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) was obtained via the rectal catheter in these men.  Results:   All men were status post radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Nineteen percent (32) of the study population (169) had non-demonstrable incontinence on intubated UDS. Mean age at the time of UDS was 62 (range 48-81). All patients demonstrated incontinence on UDS upon removal of the urethral catheter. Their mean VLPP was 79.3 (SD 36.7). Fifty-six percent (18) of these men had an anastomotic stricture (AS) and 37.5% (12) had a history of radiotherapy treatment, of which six also had an AS. Mean pads per day at the time of UDS was 4.6 (SD 2.9). At a mean follow up of 40.7 months (SD 24.7) from AUS placement, mean pads per day was 0.87 (SD 1.2).  Conclusions:   Men who fail to demonstrate incontinence on intubated UDS have a high rate of AS and history of radiotherapy treatment, which is a known cause for urethra fibrosis and scarring.

From commercial and Medicare claims data, we previously developed a tool for determining a patient's likelihood of eventually receiving PPI. We validated this instrument's utility by comparing cohorts receiving surgical (PPI) versus non-surgical ED management at a single institution.  Material and methods:   The prediction model was based on a logistic regression incorporating claims data on demographics, comorbidities and ED therapy. A risk score is calculated from the model as the product of relative risks for the individual variables. The current validation was a retrospective analysis of ED patients seen at this institution from January to December 2012. Inclusion criteria included ED diagnosis and either first-time PPI or non-surgical treatment (controls). Risk scores for patients receiving PPI were compared to those of non-surgical controls.  Results:   We established a cohort of 60 PPI patients (mean age 54.4 ± 9.5) and compared them with 120 non-PPI patients (mean age 53.4 ± 11.2 years). The median score of the PPI cohort was 5.7 (IQR 2.8-9.9) versus the non-PPI cohort's 1.8 (IQR 0.9-5.5) (p < 0.0001). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for predicting eventual PPI was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.79) (p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   The prediction model risk-stratified men who ultimately underwent PPI compared to non-surgically managed controls.

Materials and methods:   We identified 362 patients treated for low risk prostate adenocarcinoma (D'Amico criteria) with a follow up time of at least 36 months. Patients received either: 1) EBRT 76 Gy in 38 fractions (n = 58); 2) hypofractionated EBRT, 45 Gy in 9 once-weekly fractions (n = 74); 3) seed brachytherapy (n = 230). PSAb was defined as a rise >= 0.2 ng/mL with subsequent return to baseline within the first 3 years after treatment. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to assess the association between clinical factors and occurrence of PSAb.  Results:   There was no significant difference between treatment groups (p = 0.349), with an overall PSAb rate of 28.5%. Upon univariate analysis, the following were predictive of a lower PSAb rate: older age (OR = 0.96), higher PSA at diagnosis (OR = 0.87), more positive biopsy cores (OR = 0.98), and a higher Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score (CAPRA of 3 versus 1: OR = 0.33). Multivariate analysis confirmed the significance of fewer positive biopsy cores (OR = 0.99) and a lower CAPRA score (CAPRA 3 versus 1: OR = 0.34). These factors also predicted a shorter time to first PSAb.  Conclusions:   We found comparable rates of PSAb after different regimens of radiotherapy. We hypothesize that it results from late damage to healthy prostatic tissue. This idea is supported by the fact that we found that clinical factors indicative of a lower tumor burden were predictive of a PSAb.""","""['Alexandra Waters', 'Guila Delouya', 'David Donath', 'Carole Lambert', 'Sandra Larrivée', 'Kevin C Zorn', 'Daniel Taussky']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Analysis of the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment to predict for biochemical failure after external beam radiotherapy or prostate seed brachytherapy.', 'The Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score predicts biochemical recurrence in intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) dose escalation or low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen bounce after high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy and hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy.', 'Unusually high prostate-specific antigen bounce after prostate brachytherapy: Searching for etiologic factors.', ""Prostate-specific antigen 'bounce' after permanent 125I-implant brachytherapy in Japanese men: a multi-institutional pooled analysis."", 'Early Prostate-Specific Antigen Kinetics for Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated With Definitive Radiation Therapy.', 'Characteristics of PSA Bounce after Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Prostate specific antigen bounce after intensity-modulated radiation therapy in an Asian population.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Bounce After Dose-Escalated External Beam Radiation Therapy Is an Independent Predictor of PSA Recurrence, Metastasis, and Survival in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Patients.']"""

De novo synthesis of palmitate by FASN is critical for the survival of cancer cells via mechanisms independent of its role as an energy substrate. Besides the plasma membrane and the nucleus, EGFR can also localize at the mitochondria; however, signals that can activate mitochondrial EGFR (mtEGFR) and the functions of mtEGFR of cancer cells remain unknown. The present study characterizes mtEGFR in the mitochondria of cancer cells (prostate and breast) and reveals that mtEGFR can promote mitochondrial fusion through increasing the protein levels of fusion proteins PHB2 and OPA1. Activation of plasma membranous EGFR (pmEGFR) stimulates the de novo synthesis of palmitate through activation of FASN and ATP-citrate lyase (ACLy). In vitro kinase assay with isolated mitochondria shows that palmitate can activate mtEGFR. Inhibition of FASN blocks the mtEGFR phosphorylation and palmitoylation induced by EGF. Mutational studies show that the cysteine 797 is important for mtEGFR activation and palmitoylation. Inhibition of FASN can block EGF induced mitochondrial fusion and increased the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In conclusion, these results suggest that mtEGFR can be activated by pmEGFR through de novo synthesized palmitate to promote mitochondrial fusion and survival of cancer cells.

TGFβ is a multifunctional cytokine and crucial regulator of cell fate, such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is implicated in cancer invasion and progression. TGFβ conveys its signals upon binding to type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors (TβRI/II); phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 promotes their association with Smad4, which regulates expression of targets genes, such as Smad7, p21, and c-Jun. TGFβ also activates the ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which associates with TβRI and activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Snail1 is a key transcription factor, induced by TGFβ that promotes migration and invasion of cancer cells. In this study, we have identified a novel binding site for c-Jun in the promoter of the Snail1 gene and report that the activation of the TGFβ-TRAF6-p38 MAPK pathway promotes both c-Jun expression and its activation via p38α-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63. The TRAF6-dependent activation of p38 also leads to increased stability of c-Jun, due to p38-dependent inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β by phosphorylation at Ser9. Thus, our findings elucidate a novel role for the p38 MAPK pathway in stimulated cells, leading to activation of c-Jun and its binding to the promoter of Snail1, thereby triggering motility and invasiveness of aggressive human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Noopur Thakur', 'Shyam Kumar Gudey', 'Anders Marcusson', 'Jing Yi Fu', 'Anders Bergh', 'Carl-Henrik Heldin', 'Marene Landström']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""[""Invasive cells follow Snail's slow and persistent pace."", 'TRAF6 promotes TGFβ-induced invasion and cell-cycle regulation via Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of Lys178 in TGFβ type I receptor.', 'Non-Smad signaling pathways.', 'ETS1 induces transforming growth factor β signaling and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells.', 'APPL proteins promote TGFβ-induced nuclear transport of the TGFβ type I receptor intracellular domain.', 'Role of Ras and Mapks in TGFbeta signaling.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'A synthetic lethal screen for Snail-induced enzalutamide resistance identifies JAK/STAT signaling as a therapeutic vulnerability in prostate cancer.', 'GOLM1 Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition by Activating TGFβ1/Smad2 Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Global Histone H3 Lysine 4 Trimethylation (H3K4me3) Landscape Changes in Response to TGFβ.', 'Sustained compensatory p38 MAPK signaling following treatment with MAPK inhibitors induces the immunosuppressive protein CD73 in cancer: combined targeting could improve outcomes.']"""

Zoledronic acid (ZOL) is the most potent aminobiphosphonate able to induce cell growth inhibition at very low concentrations. The lack of clear evidence of ZOL-induced anti-cancer effects is likely due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile. The use of nanotechnology-based formulations allows overcoming these limitations in ZOL pharmaco-distribution. Recently, stealth liposomes (LIPOs) and new self-assembly PEGylated nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating ZOL were developed. Both the delivery systems showed promising anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we investigated the cytostatic effect of these novel formulations (LIPOs and NPs) compared with free ZOL on 2 different prostate cancer cell lines, PC 3 and DU 145 and on prostate epithelial primary cells EPN using time lapse video-microscopy (TLVM). In PC3 cells, free ZOL showed a significant anti-proliferative effect but this effect was lower than that induced by LIPOs and NPs encapsulating ZOL; moreover, LIPO-ZOL was more potent in inducing growth inhibition than NP-ZOL. On the other hand, LIPO-ZOL slightly enhanced the free ZOL activity on growth inhibition of DU 145, while the anti-proliferative effect of NP-ZOL was not statistically relevant. These novel formulations did not induce anti-proliferative effects on EPN cells. Finally, we evaluated cytotoxic effects on DU145 where, LIPO-ZOL induced the highest cytotoxicity compared with NP-ZOL and free ZOL.

A new strategy proposed for sustained administration of the GNP in prostate tumors is to load them into routinely used brachytherapy spacers for customizable in situ release after implantation. This in silico study investigated the intratumor biodistribution and corresponding dose enhancement over time due to GNP released from such GNP-loaded brachytherapy spacers (GBS).  Method and materials:   An experimentally determined intratumoral diffusion coefficient (D) for 10-nm nanoparticles was used to estimate D for other sizes by using the Stokes-Einstein equation. GNP concentration profiles, obtained using D, were then used to calculate the corresponding dose enhancement factor (DEF) for each tumor voxel, using dose painting-by-numbers approach, for times relevant to the considered brachytherapy sources' lifetimes. The investigation was carried out as a function of GNP size for the clinically applicable low-dose-rate brachytherapy sources iodine-125 (I-125), palladium-103 (Pd-103), and cesium-131 (Cs-131).  Results:   Results showed that dose enhancement to tumor voxels and subvolumes during brachytherapy can be customized by varying the size of GNP released or eluted from the GBS. For example, using a concentration of 7 mg/g GNP, significant DEF (>20%) could be achieved 5 mm from a GBS after 5, 12, 25, 46, 72, 120, and 195 days, respectively, for GNP sizes of 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 nm and for 80 nm when treating with I-125.  Conclusions:   Analyses showed that using Cs-131 provides the highest dose enhancement to tumor voxels. However, given its relatively longer half-life, I-125 presents the most flexibility for customizing the dose enhancement as a function of GNP size.

However, the underlying mechanism of AR-Vs in CRPC transcriptional regulation has not been defined. A distinct transcriptome enriched with cell cycle genes, e.g. UBE2C, has been associated with AR-Vs, which indicates the possibility of an altered transcriptional mechanism when compared to full-length wild-type AR (ARfl). Importantly, a recent study reported the critical role of p-MED1 in enhancing UBE2C expression through a locus looping pattern, which only occurs in CRPC but not in androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC). To investigate the potential correlation between AR-V and MED1, in the present study we performed protein co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and cell proliferation assays and found that MED1 is necessary for ARv567es induced UBE2C up-regulation and subsequent prostate cancer cell growth. Furthermore, p-MED1 is bound to ARv567es independent of full-length AR; p-MED1 has higher recruitment to UBE2C promoter and enhancer regions in the presence of ARv567es. Our data indicate that p-MED1 serves as a key mediator in ARv567es induced gene expression and suggests a mechanism by which AR-Vs promote the development and progression of CRPC.""","""['Gang Liu', 'Cynthia Sprenger', 'Pin-Jou Wu', 'Shihua Sun', 'Takuma Uo', 'Kathleen Haugk', 'Kathryn Soriano Epilepsia', 'Stephen Plymate']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Phospho-MED1-enhanced UBE2C locus looping drives castration-resistant prostate cancer growth.', 'Transcript Levels of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 and Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 2C in Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Are androgen receptor variants a substitute for the full-length receptor?', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Dynamic phase separation of the androgen receptor and its coactivators key to regulate gene expression.', 'Mediator subunit MED1 differentially modulates mutant thyroid hormone receptor intracellular dynamics in Resistance to Thyroid Hormone syndrome.', 'The potential role of circRNA_004229 in hair/epidermal regulation after MED1 ablation in keratinocytes.', 'Phosphorylated MED1 links transcription recycling and cancer growth.']"""

The secondary objective is to describe the characteristics of the incident cases and to compare them to those of the patients of the national registers of cancer for the period.  Material and methods:   Prospective observational multicentric study from 01/01/2001 to 31/12/2012 of databases in 5 French, public and private hospital centers of urology. The inclusive centers were selected outside departments with cancer register. The collected data were the prostatic biopsies performed in every center and the number of positive biopsies. The biopsies in cases of already known cancer and in re-evaluation were excluded. The data of age and stage (PSA and Gleason grade) were collected. The estimation of the incidence standardized in France is established after a period of observation of 3 years. The data updated in 2009 show a peak of incidence in 2005 then a decrease from 2006 (64,518 cases) until 2009 (53,465 cases). The median age in the diagnosis was of 70 years in 2005.  Results:   Overall, 18,392 prostatic biopsies were included in the analysis. The average rate of positive biopsies was stable over the period 51.41% (IQR 0,02). The total number of cases of positive biopsies increased from 2001 to 2007 (482 cases in 1028 cases) in 2007, then decreased from 2008 to 2012 (649 cases). There was no difference in this variation between the centers. The median age in the diagnosis was of 70 years (EIQ=1.5) in 2001 and 68 years (EIQ=2.75) in 2012. PSA at diagnosis was<10ng/mL in 65% of cases and 10 to 20ng/mL in 22% of cases in 2012. The population of patients of the study differed significantly from that of FRANCIM on the distribution by age ranges (year 2005, P<0.0001 and year 2009, P<0.001), which explains the gap of one year (on 2007 instead of 2006) of the peak of incidental cases.  Conclusion:   The evolution of the number of incidental cases of prostate cancer in France from 2001 to 2012 from hospital data of 5 centers are similar to those of the network of registers representative of the French population.

An unconstrained IPSA optimised treatment plan, using the Oncentra Brachytherapy treatment planning system (version 4.3, Nucletron an Elekta company, Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden), was generated for 20 consecutive HDR prostate brachytherapy patients, with the DTDC set to zero. Successive constrained optimisation plans were also created for each patient by increasing the DTDC parameter by 0.2, up to a maximum value of 1.0. We defined a ""plan modulation index"", to characterise the change of dwell time modulation as the DTDC parameter was increased. We calculated the dose volume histogram indices for the PTV (D90, V100, V150, V200%) and urethra (D10%) to characterise the effect on the resulting dosimetry. The average PTV D90% decreases as the DTDC is applied, on average by only 1.5 %, for a DTDC = 0.4. The measures of high dose regions in the PTV, V150 and V200%, increase on average by less than 5 and 2 % respectively. The net effect of DTDC on the modulation of dwell times has been characterised by the introduction of the plan modulation index. DTDC applied during IPSA optimisation of HDR prostate brachytherapy plans reduce the occurrence of large isolated dwell times within individual catheters. The mechanism by which DTDC works has been described and its effect on the modulation of dwell times has been characterised. The authors recommend using a DTDC parameter no greater than 0.4 to obtain a plan with dwell time modulation comparable to a geometric optimised plan. This yielded on average a 1.5 % decrease in PTV coverage and an acceptable increase in V150%, without compromising the urethral dose.""","""['Ryan L Smith', 'Vanessa Panettieri', 'Craig Lancaster', 'Natasha Mason', 'Rick D Franich', 'Jeremy L Millar']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Australas Phys Eng Sci Med""","""['Study of the effects of dwell time deviation constraints on inverse planning simulated annealing optimized plans of intracavitary brachytherapy of cancer cervix.', 'Plan quality score to evaluate the dwell time deviation restricted inverse planning by simulated annealing and graphically optimized treatment plans for template based interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Robustness of IPSA optimized high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy treatment plans to catheter displacements.', 'Oncentra brachytherapy planning system.', 'Emerging technologies in brachytherapy.', 'Comparative analysis of dosimetric and radiobiological models of IPSA and HIPO algorithms in combined intra-cavitary/interstitial brachytherapy for cervical cancer.', 'Effect of the dwell time deviation constraint on brachytherapy treatment planning for cervical cancer.', 'An audit of high dose-rate prostate brachytherapy treatment planning at six Swedish clinics.', 'Comparison of two inverse planning algorithms for cervical cancer brachytherapy.', 'An Inverse Dose Optimization Algorithm for Three-Dimensional Brachytherapy.']"""

Methods:   The expression of alpha1D-AR and TRPV1 was examined in human PCa tissues by quantitative RT-PCR and in PCa cell lines (DU145, PC3 and LNCaP) by cytofluorimetry. Moreover, alpha(1D)-AR and TRPV1 colocalization was investigated by confocal microscopy in PCa cell lines and by fluorescence microscopy in benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa tissues. Cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU incorporation. Alpha(1D)-AR/TRPV1 knockdown was obtained using siRNA transfection. Signalling pathways were evaluated by measurement of extracellular acidification rate, Ca(2+) flux, IP3 production, western blot and MTT assay.  Results:   The levels of the alpha(1D)-AR and TRPV1 mRNAs are increased in PCa compared to BPH specimens and a high correlation between alpha(1D)-AR and TRPV1 expression levels was found. Moreover, alpha(1D)-AR and TRPV1 are co-expressed in prostate cancer cell lines and specimens. Noradrenaline (NA) induced an alpha(1D)-AR- and TRPV1-dependent protons release and Ca(2+) flux in PC3 cell lines; NA by triggering the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways stimulated PC3 cell proliferation, that was completely inhibited by clopenphendioxan (WS433) and capsazepine (CPZ) combination or by alpha(1D)-AR/TRPV1 double knockdown.

Biopsies for active surveillance or solely targeting magnetic resonance imaging detected lesions were excluded from study. Interventional ARIMA models with step functions were used to examine changes in the number of biopsies performed and cancers detected per month. Low risk prostate cancer was defined as no Gleason pattern 4 or greater, 3 or fewer cores involved, or 1/3 or less of the total number of cores involved, and no core with greater than 50% cancer involvement. Intermediate to high grade prostate cancer was defined as Gleason 7-10.  Results:   A total of 3,408 biopsies were performed and 1,601 (47.0%) prostate cancers were detected (low risk prostate cancer 563 [16.5%], intermediate to high grade prostate cancer 914 [26.8%]). The median number of biopsies per month decreased from 58.0 (IQR 54.5-63.0) before the recommendations to 35.5 (IQR 27.0-41.0) afterward (p=0.003), while the median number of patients undergoing first-time biopsy decreased from 42.5 (IQR 37.5-45.5) to 24.0 (IQR 19.0-32.5, p=0.025).

The purpose of this study is to summarize longterm trends in the cancer burden and to provide up-to-date estimates of incidence and mortality rates after 2011.  Data and methods:   The Czech National Cancer Registry (CNCR) was instituted in 1977 and contains information collected over a 34-year period of standardized registration covering 100% of cancer diagnoses within the entire Czech population. The CNCR analysis is supported by demographic data and by the Death Records Database. An overview of the epidemiology of malignant tumors in the Czech population is available online at www.svod.cz.  Results:   All neoplasms, including nonmelanoma skin cancer, reached a crude incidence rate of almost 802 cases per 100,000 men and 681 cases per 100,000 women in 2011. The annual mortality rate exceeded 258 deaths per 100,000 individuals; in other words, more than 27,000 individuals die of cancer each year. The overall incidence of malignancies has increased with a growth index of +27.6% during the last decade (2001- 2011), while the mortality rate has been stabilized over the time span (growth index in 2001- 2011: - 5.0%). Consequently, the prevalence has significantly increased in the observed period and exceeded 475,000 cases in 2011. In addition to demographic aging of the Czech population, the cancer burden has also increased due to the growing incidence of multiple primary tumors (recently more than 15% of the total incidence). The most frequent diagnoses include colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Although some neoplasms are increasingly diagnosed at an early stage (e. g. the proportion of stage I or II was 75.3% for female breast cancer and 84.2% for skin melanoma), the numbers of early diagnosed cases are generally insufficient, even in the case of highly prevalent cancers such as colorectal carcinoma (only 46.1% of incident cases are diagnosed at stage I or II, according to recent data).  Conclusion:   Population-based data on malignant tumors are available in the Czech Republic. The data survey can help us define national cancer management priorities. The current priority is to achieve a sustained reduction of cases diagnosed at an advanced stage and reduction of the significant regional differences in diagnostic efficiency.""","""['L Dusek', 'J Muzik', 'D Maluskova', 'O Májek', 'T Pavlík', 'J Koptíková', 'B Melichar', 'T Büchler', 'J Fínek', 'D Cibula', 'M Babjuk', 'M Svoboda', 'R Vyzula', 'A Ryska', 'M Ryska', 'J Petera', 'J Abrahámová']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Klin Onkol""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Estimating cancer incidence, prevalence, and the number of cancer patients treated with antitumor therapy in 2015 and 2020 -\u200a analysis of the Czech National Cancer Registry.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in Europe: Estimates for 40 countries and 25 major cancers in 2018.', 'Epidemiology of gallbladder and bile duct malignancies in the Czech Republic.', 'Five-year relative survival by stage of breast and colon cancers in northern Italy.', 'Circulating tumor DNA in Hodgkin lymphoma.', 'Clinicopathological Characteristics and Prognostic Factors in Ovarian Metastases from Right- and Left-Sided Colorectal Cancer.', 'Identification of Germline Mutations in Melanoma Patients with Early Onset, Double Primary Tumors, or Family Cancer History by NGS Analysis of 217 Genes.', 'Novel serum markers HSP60, CHI3L1, and IGFBP-2 in metastatic colorectal cancer.']"""

With the inclusion of anatomy-based inverse planning opti- mizers, HDRB has the advantage of potentially allowing dose escalation. Among the algorithms used, the Inverse Planning Simulated Annealing (IPSA) optimizer is widely employed since it provides adequate dose coverage, minimizing dose to the OAR, but it is known to generate large dwell times in particular positions of the catheter. As an alternative, the Hybrid Inverse treatment Planning Optimization (HIPO) algorithm was recently implemented in Oncentra Brachytherapy V. 4.3. The aim of this work was to compare, with the aid of radiobiological models, plans obtained with IPSA and HIPO to assess their use in our clinical practice. Thirty patients were calculated with IPSA and HIPO to achieve our department's clinical constraints. To evaluate their performance, dosimetric data were collected: Prostate PTV D90(%), V100(%), V150(%), and V200(%), Urethra D10(%), Rectum D2cc(%), and conformity indices. Additionally tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were calculated with the BioSuite software. The HIPO optimization was performed firstly with Prostate PTV (HIPOPTV) and then with Urethra as priority 1 (HIPOurethra). Initial optimization constraints were then modified to see the effects on dosimetric parameters, TCPs, and NTCPs. HIPO optimizations could reduce TCPs up to 10%-20% for all PTVs lower than 74 cm3.

VMAT plan delivery accuracy was determined from analysis of pre- and on-treatment trajectory log files and phantom-based ionization chamber array measurements. The correlation in this combination of measurements for patient-specific QA was investigated. The relationship between delivery errors and plan complexity was investigated as a potential method to further reduce patient-specific QA workload. Thirty VMAT plans from three treatment sites - prostate only, prostate and pelvic node (PPN), and head and neck (H&amp;N) - were retrospectively analyzed in this work. The 2D fluence delivery reconstructed from pretreatment and on-treatment trajectory log files was compared with the planned fluence using gamma analysis. Pretreatment dose delivery verification was also car- ried out using gamma analysis of ionization chamber array measurements compared with calculated doses. Pearson correlations were used to explore any relationship between trajectory log file (pretreatment and on-treatment) and ionization chamber array gamma results (pretreatment). Plan complexity was assessed using the MU/ arc and the modulation complexity score (MCS), with Pearson correlations used to examine any relationships between complexity metrics and plan delivery accu- racy. Trajectory log files were also used to further explore the accuracy of MLC and gantry positions. Pretreatment 1%/1 mm gamma passing rates for trajectory log file analysis were 99.1% (98.7%-99.2%), 99.3% (99.1%-99.5%), and 98.4% (97.3%-98.8%) (median (IQR)) for prostate, PPN, and H&amp;N, respectively, and were significantly correlated to on-treatment trajectory log file gamma results (R = 0.989, p &lt; 0.001). Pretreatment ionization chamber array (2%/2 mm) gamma results were also significantly correlated with on-treatment trajectory log file gamma results (R = 0.623, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, all gamma results displayed a significant correlation with MCS (R &gt; 0.57, p &lt; 0.001), but not with MU/arc. Average MLC position and gantry angle errors were 0.001 ± 0.002 mm and 0.025° ± 0.008° over all treatment sites and were not found to affect delivery accuracy. However, vari- ability in MLC speed was found to be directly related to MLC position accuracy. The accuracy of VMAT plan delivery assessed using pretreatment trajectory log file fluence delivery and ionization chamber array measurements were strongly correlated with on-treatment trajectory log file fluence delivery. The strong corre- lation between trajectory log file and phantom-based gamma results demonstrates potential to reduce our current patient-specific QA. Additionally, insight into MLC and gantry position accuracy through trajectory log file analysis and the strong cor- relation between gamma analysis results and the MCS could also provide further methodologies to both optimize the VMAT planning and QA process.""","""['Christina E Agnew', 'Denise M Irvine', 'Conor K McGarry']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['A method to reconstruct and apply 3D primary fluence for treatment delivery verification.', 'Implementation of phantom-less IMRT delivery verification using Varian DynaLog files and R/V output.', 'Texture analysis on the fluence map to evaluate the degree of modulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Utilising the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training System to Support Undergraduate Teaching of IMRT, VMAT, DCAT Treatment Planning, and QA Concepts.', 'Complexity metrics for IMRT and VMAT plans: a review of current literature and applications.', 'Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: current issues and recent trends.', 'Craniospinal Irradiation: A Dosimetric Comparison Between O-Ring Linac and Conventional C-arm Linac.', 'A method for patient-specific DVH verification using a high-sampling-rate log file in an Elekta linac.', 'Comparison of MLC positioning deviations using log files and establishment of specific assessment parameters for different accelerators with IMRT and VMAT.', 'Error Detectability of Isodose Volumes as ROIs in Prostate Intensity-modulated RT QA.']"""

Methods:   We evaluated 576 men with newly diagnosed PCa (before treatment) and 655 controls in Guadeloupe (French West Indies). Exposure was analyzed according to case-control status. Associations were assessed by unconditional logistic regression analysis, controlling for confounding factors. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation.

We examined trends in inequalities in cancer mortality by educational attainment in Colombia during a period of epidemiological transition and rapid expansion of health insurance coverage.  Methods:   Population mortality data (1998-2007) were linked to census data to obtain age-standardised cancer mortality rates by educational attainment at ages 25-64 years for stomach, cervical, prostate, lung, colorectal, breast and other cancers. We used Poisson regression to model mortality by educational attainment and estimated the contribution of specific cancers to the slope index of inequality in cancer mortality.  Results:   We observed large educational inequalities in cancer mortality, particularly for cancer of the cervix (rate ratio (RR) primary vs tertiary groups=5.75, contributing 51% of cancer inequalities), stomach (RR=2.56 for males, contributing 49% of total cancer inequalities and RR=1.98 for females, contributing 14% to total cancer inequalities) and lung (RR=1.64 for males contributing 17% of total cancer inequalities and 1.32 for females contributing 5% to total cancer inequalities). Total cancer mortality rates declined faster among those with higher education, with the exception of mortality from cervical cancer, which declined more rapidly in the lower educational groups.  Conclusions:   There are large socioeconomic inequalities in preventable cancer mortality in Colombia, which underscore the need for intensifying prevention efforts. Reduction of cervical cancer can be achieved through reducing human papilloma virus infection, early detection and improved access to treatment of preneoplastic lesions.

Therefore, we investigated the association of prostate cancer risks with male pattern baldness at age 30 years, age 45 years, and baseline (median age = 60.5 years) in the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort study.  Methods:   We included 32,583 men who were aged 50-76 years and without prior cancer diagnosis (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) at the start of follow-up. First primary incident prostate cancers were ascertained via linkage to the western Washington Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regressions with adjustment for potential confounders.  Results:   During follow-up (median = 9 years), 2,306 incident prostate cancers were diagnosed. Male pattern baldness at age 30 years, age 45 years, and baseline were not statistically significantly associated with overall or subtypes of prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   This study did not provide support for the hypothesis that male pattern baldness may be a marker for subsequent prostate cancer.

According to the D'Amico grouping and American Urological Association guidelines, cT2c is a high risk, whereas the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the European Urological Association classify cT2c as an intermediate risk. This study assessed whether cT2c tumors without other high-risk factors (clinical stage T2c, not otherwise specified [cT2c-NOS]) behaved as an intermediate or high risk through an analysis of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Two thousand seven hundred fifty-nine men from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) Database and 12,900 men from Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) from 1988-2011 and 1982-2012, respectively, were analyzed. Patients were grouped into low-risk (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] < 10 ng/mL, Gleason sum ≤ 6, and cT1-T2a), intermediate-risk (PSA = 10-20 ng/mL, Gleason sum = 7, or cT2b), and high-risk PC categories (PSA > 20 ng/mL, Gleason sum = 8-10, or cT3). Men with cT2c tumors who were not otherwise at high risk (ie, PSA< 20 ng/mL and Gleason sum < 8) were placed into a separate category termed cT2c-NOS. Associations between cT2c-NOS and intermediate- and high-risk patients and BCR were tested with the log-rank test and Cox proportional analysis models.  Results:   Ninety-nine men (4%) from SEARCH and 202 men (2%) from JHH had tumors classified as cT2c-NOS. The cT2c-NOS patients had a BCR risk similar to that of the intermediate-risk patients (SEARCH, P = .27; JHH, P = .23) but a significantly lower BCR risk in comparison with the high-risk patients (SEARCH, P < .001; JHH, P < .001). When they were specifically compared with intermediate- and high-risk patients, after adjustments for year and center, cT2c-NOS patients had outcomes comparable to those of intermediate-risk patients (SEARCH, P = .53; JHH, P = .54) but significantly better than those of high-risk patients (SEARCH, P = .003; JHH, P < .001).  Conclusions:   Patients with cT2c disease without other high-risk features had outcomes similar to the outcomes of patients with intermediate-risk PC and significantly better than the outcomes of patients with high-risk PC.

We conducted this meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and toxicity of the addition of MTAs to docetaxel-based chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic CRPC.  Methods:   Databases from PubMed, Web of Science, and abstracts presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting up to 31 June 2014 were searched to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies included prospective phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating docetaxel with or without MTAs in patients with metastatic CRPC. The primary aim was to assess overall survival (OS). Secondary aims were to assess progression-free survival (PFS); overall response rates (ORRs), and grade 3-5 toxicities. Statistical analyses were conducted by using either random effects or fixed-effect models according to the heterogeneity of included studies.  Results:   A total of 5886 patients from five phase III RCTs were identified. No statistically significant difference in OS [hazard ratio (HR): 0·98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0·91-1·04, P = 0·44], ORR [relative risk (RR): 1·32, 95% CI: 0·94-1·84, P = 0·11], and PSA response rate (RR: 1·22, 95% CI: 0·86-1·74, P = 0·27) was found between the two groups.

Hence, they can be used as effective radiosensitizers for increasing the efficiency of current radiotherapy. In this work, superparamagnetic zinc ferrite spinel (ZnFe2O4) nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction method and used as radiosensitizers in cancer therapy. The magnetic nanoparticles showed fast separation from solutions (e.g., ~1 min for 2 mg mL(-1) of the nanoparticles in ethanol) by applying an external magnetic field (~1T). The ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles were applied in an in vitro radiotherapy of lymph node carcinoma of prostate cells (as high radioresistant cells) under gamma irradiation of (60)Co source. The nanoparticles exhibited no significant effects on the cancer cells up to the high concentration of 100 μg mL(-1), in the absence of gamma irradiation. The gamma irradiation alone (2Gy dose) also showed no significant effects on the cells. However, gamma irradiation in the presence of 100 μg mL(-1) ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles resulted in ~53% inactivation of the cells (~17 times higher than the inactivation that occurred under gamma irradiation alone) after 24h.

Many applications involve functionalization of the Au NP surface in order to improve biocompatibility, attach targeting ligands or carry drugs. However, changes in cells exposed to Au NPs of different surface chemistries have been observed, and little is known about how Au NPs and their surface coatings may impact cellular gene expression. The gene expression of two model human cell lines, human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and prostate cancer cells (PC3) was interrogated by microarray analysis of over 14,000 human genes. The cell lines were exposed to four differently functionalized Au NPs: citrate, poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), and lipid coatings combined with alkanethiols or PAH. Gene functional annotation categories and weighted gene correlation network analysis were used in order to connect gene expression changes to common cellular functions and to elucidate expression patterns between Au NP samples. Coated Au NPs affect genes implicated in proliferation, angiogenesis, and metabolism in HDF cells, and inflammation, angiogenesis, proliferation apoptosis regulation, survival and invasion in PC3 cells. Subtle changes in surface chemistry, such as the initial net charge, lability of the ligand, and underlying layers greatly influence the degree of expression change and the type of cellular pathway affected.""","""['E M Grzincic', 'J A Yang', 'J Drnevich', 'P Falagan-Lotsch', 'C J Murphy']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Tuning cellular response to nanoparticles via surface chemistry and aggregation.', ""α-Synuclein's adsorption, conformation, and orientation on cationic gold nanoparticle surfaces seeds global conformation change."", 'Self-assembly of gold nanoparticles on poly(allylamine hydrochloride) nanofiber: a new route to fabricate ""necklace"" as single electron devices.', 'Controlled synthesis and biomolecular probe application of gold nanoparticles.', 'Surface tailoring of nanoparticles via mixed-charge monolayers and their biomedical applications.', 'Mechanistic Insights into the Biological Effects of Engineered Nanomaterials: A Focus on Gold Nanoparticles.', 'Droplet microarrays for cell culture: effect of surface properties and nanoliter culture volume on global transcriptomic landscape.', 'Multiparametric Profiling of Engineered Nanomaterials: Unmasking the Surface Coating Effect.', 'Transcriptomics in Toxicogenomics, Part I: Experimental Design, Technologies, Publicly Available Data, and Regulatory Aspects.', 'Low-Dose Silver Nanoparticle Surface Chemistry and Temporal Effects on Gene Expression in Human Liver Cells.']"""

Objectives:   We sought to determine whether NMSC and melanoma are associated with extra-cutaneous cancers and identify modifiable risk factors for such an association.  Methods:   We analysed data from 447,801 adult participants in the 1997-2011 National Health Interview Surveys. Survey logistic regression models were constructed that accounted for the complex sample weights. History of NMSC, melanoma and 27 primary extra-cutaneous cancers was assessed.  Results:   NMSC was associated with increased odds of one (multinomial survey logistic regression, unadjusted odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.43 [2.20-2.68]) or multiple (2.94 [2.21-3.92]) extra-cutaneous malignancies. Melanoma was also associated with increased odds of one (3.25 [2.70-3.90]) or multiple (6.11 [4.34-8.61]) extra-cutaneous malignancies. Extra-cutaneous cancers were more common in younger patients (ages 18-39 and 40-49 years) and Caucasians with NMSC or melanoma (P < 0.0001). Smokers with a history of NMSC or melanoma had even higher odds of extra-cutaneous malignancy at ages 18-39 and 40-49 years compared to smokers without NMSC or melanoma (P < 0.0001). History of NMSC was associated with higher odds of malignancies of the bladder, brain, breast, colon, oesophagus, kidney, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, prostate, soft tissue, throat/pharynx, thyroid and uterus. Melanoma was associated with malignancies of the bladder, breast, colon, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, soft tissue, throat/pharynx, thyroid and uterus. The prevalence of extra-cutaneous cancers increased between 1997 and 2011 in all subjects (4.51% and 5.73%, P < 0.0001), with even higher rates of increase in those with history of NMSC or melanoma.

Methods and materials:   This was an observational, prospective cohort study with follow-up until 5 years after treatment. A total of 704 patients with low or intermediate risk localized prostate cancer were consecutively recruited from 2003 to 2005. The estimation of preferences was conducted using time trade-off, standard gamble, and willingness-to-pay methods. Side effects were measured with the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC), a prostate cancer-specific questionnaire. Tobit models were constructed to assess the impact of treatment and side effects on patients' preferences. Propensity score was applied to adjust for treatment selection bias.  Results:   Of the 580 patients reporting preferences, 165 were treated with radical prostatectomy, 152 with external radiation therapy, and 263 with brachytherapy. Both time trade-off and standard gamble results indicated that the preferences of patients treated with brachytherapy were 0.06 utilities higher than those treated with radical prostatectomy (P=.01). Similarly, willingness-to-pay responses showed a difference of €57/month (P=.004) between these 2 treatments. Severe urinary incontinence presented an independent impact on the preferences elicited (P<.05), whereas no significant differences were found by bowel and sexual side effects.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that urinary incontinence is the side effect with the highest impact on preferences and that brachytherapy and external radiation therapy are more valued than radical prostatectomy.

Methods and materials:   A total of 179 men, median age 69, received definitive IMRT for prostate cancer and completed 2 surveys (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 and a sexual medicines/devices survey) for at least 2 time points. Surveys were prospectively collected at baseline (before all therapy), and 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after IMRT. Median dose was 76 Gy to the prostate. ADT was administered to 59% of patients (median duration 5 months, initiated 2 months before IMRT). Global scores were generated for the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 questions. Longitudinal analysis was performed by constructing a generalized estimation equations model, and clinical variables were tested for association with global scores.  Results:   Overall, there was a significant decline in global sexual score through 2 years. Men receiving ADT had a lower sexual score at 2 and 6 months, but this difference disappeared at 24 months. Analysis of individual sexual symptoms showed no significant difference at 24 months except that men on ADT were less likely to be sexually active (P = .02); this difference was not observed for men receiving short-term ADT only. Longitudinal analysis revealed that duration of ADT was the only factor associated with global sexual score. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors were attempted by roughly half of all men, with 66% experiencing benefit, whereas other aids were attempted by roughly 5% of men.  Conclusions:   Although ADT adversely affected short-term sexual function, there was no significant difference in global score and most sexual symptoms by 24 months.

However, the mechanisms underlying their potential cancer preventative effects are unclear. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) of the free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) family, FFA1/GPR40 and FFA4/GPR120, specifically bind n-3 FAs as agonist ligands. In this study, we examined the effects of n-3 FAs in human prostate cancer cell lines. Initial studies established that the long-chain n-3 FAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid, inhibit proliferation of DU145 cells in response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a mitogenic lipid mediator. When added alone to serum-starved DU145 cells, EPA transiently activates signaling events, including p70S6K phosphorylation. However, when added 15 minutes prior to LPA, EPA suppresses LPA-induced activating phosphorylations of ERK, FAK, and p70S6K, and expression of the matricellular protein CCN1. The rapid onset of the inhibitory action of EPA suggested involvement of a GPCR. Further studies showed that DU145 and PC-3 cells express mRNA and protein for both FFA4 and FFA1. TUG-891 (4-[(4-fluoro-4'-methyl[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-yl)methoxy]-benzenepropanoic acid), a selective agonist for FFA4, exerts inhibitory effects on LPA- and epidermal growth factor-induced proliferation and migration, similar to EPA, in DU145 and PC-3 cells. The effects of TUG-891 and EPA are readily reversible. The FFA1/FFA4 agonist GW9508 (4-[[(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl]amino]-benzenepropranoic acid) likewise inhibits proliferation at doses that block FFA4. Knockdown of FFA4 expression prevents EPA- and TUG-891-induced inhibition of growth and migration. Together, these results indicate that activation of FFA4 initiates signaling events that can inhibit growth factor-induced signaling, providing a novel mechanism for suppression of cancer cell proliferation.""","""['Ze Liu', 'Mandi M Hopkins', 'Zhihong Zhang', 'Chrystal B Quisenberry', 'Louise C Fix', 'Brianna M Galvan', 'Kathryn E Meier']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Positive and Negative Cross-Talk between Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 1, Free Fatty Acid Receptor 4, and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) agonists inhibit proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells.', 'Eicosopentaneoic Acid and Other Free Fatty Acid Receptor Agonists Inhibit Lysophosphatidic Acid- and Epidermal Growth Factor-Induced Proliferation of Human Breast Cancer Cells.', 'The role of free-fatty acid receptor-4 (FFA4) in human cancers and cancer cell lines.', 'Free Fatty Acid Receptors and Cancer: From Nutrition to Pharmacology.', 'PHF8-GLUL axis in lipid deposition and tumor growth of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'The Involvement of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Apoptosis Mechanisms and Their Implications in Cancer.', 'Physicochemical and Biopharmaceutical Controllability of New Self-Assembled Fatty Acid Conjugated Leuprolide for the Enhanced Anticancer Activity.', 'The role of lipid metabolism in cancer radioresistance.', 'From outside to inside and back again: the lysophosphatidic acid-CCN axis in signal transduction.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective cohort design and health care claims (2006 to 2011) from private health plans covering a geographically diverse US population of > 30 million persons annually were used. The study population included adults who underwent myelosuppressive chemotherapy for metastatic cancer of the breast (MBC), colon/rectum (MCRC), lung (MLC), ovaries (MOC), or prostate (MPC). For each patient, the first chemotherapy course and each cycle therein, along with each episode of FN and the consequences thereof, were identified.  Results:   The most common regimens, by cancer type, were paclitaxel (18% of 15,318 patients with MBC); oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (23% of 16,923 patients with MCRC); carboplatin plus paclitaxel (23% of 21,999 patients with MLC); carboplatin plus paclitaxel (49% of 7,433 patients with MOC); and docetaxel (68% of 4,667 patients with MPC). Across cancers, FN occurred in 13.1% to 20.6% of patients during their chemotherapy course, most often required hospitalization (89% to 94%), and most often occurred in the first cycle (23% to 36%). Among hospitalized patients with FN, mean length of stay ranged from 7.0 to 7.5 days, and inpatient mortality ranged from 3.9% to 10.3%; mean FN-related costs during the cycle ranged from $16,291 to $19,456.

In this study the number of new urological cancer cases was extrapolated on the county level for Lower Saxony.  Materials and methods:   The incidence rates for penile (C60), prostate (C61), testis (C62), kidney (C64), renal pelvis/ureter (C65-66) and bladder cancer (C67, D09.0, D41.4) were extrapolated for counties and urban communes from 2010 to 2020 and to 2030 based on the regional population forecast of the State Office for Statistics of Lower Saxony (2009-2031) and gender- and 5-year age-specific incidence rates for Lower Saxony (averaged for 2006-2010).  Results:   From 2010 (n=12.668) to 2020 and 2030, increases of 15% (n = 14.519; men: 15%, women: 10%) and 28% (n=16.201; men: 29%, women: 20%) are expected in urological cancers for Lower Saxony.

RNA sequencing was used to analyze drug-induced gene expression changes. Results were analyzed with χ(2) test. Student's t test and nonparametric Mann-Whitney rank sum U Test. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   AZD1208 inhibited tumorigenesis in tissue recombinants, Myc-CaP, and human PC xenograft models. PIM inhibition decreased c-MYC/Pim1 graft growth by 54.3 ± 39% (P < .001), decreased cellular proliferation by 46 ± 14% (P = .016), and increased apoptosis by 326 ± 170% (P = .039). AZD1208 suppressed multiple protumorigenic pathways, including the MYC gene program. However, it also downregulated the p53 pathway. Hypoxia and radiation induced PIM1 in prostate cancer cells, and AZD1208 functioned as a radiation sensitizer. Recurrent tumors postcastration responded transiently to either AZD1208 or radiation treatment, and combination treatment resulted in more sustained inhibition of tumor growth. Cell lines established from recurrent, AZD1208-resistant tumors again revealed downregulation of the p53 pathway. Irradiated AZD1208-treated tumors robustly upregulated p53, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the effectiveness of combination therapy. Finally, an AZD1208-resistant gene signature was found to be associated with biochemical recurrence in PC patients.  Conclusions:   PIM inhibition is a potential treatment for MYC-driven prostate cancers including CRPC, and its effectiveness may be enhanced by activators of the p53 pathway, such as radiation.""","""['Austin N Kirschner', 'Jie Wang', 'Riet van der Meer', 'Philip D Anderson', 'Omar E Franco-Coronel', 'Max H Kushner', 'Joel H Everett', 'Omar Hameed', 'Erika K Keeton', 'Miika Ahdesmaki', 'Shaun E Grosskurth', 'Dennis Huszar', 'Sarki A Abdulkadir']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Pan-Pim Kinase Inhibitor AZD1208 Suppresses Tumor Growth and Synergistically Interacts with Akt Inhibition in Gastric Cancer Cells.', 'The Dual Inhibition of RNA Pol I Transcription and PIM Kinase as a New Therapeutic Approach to Treat Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'New Mechanistic Insight on the PIM-1 Kinase Inhibitor AZD1208 Using Multidrug Resistant Human Erythroleukemia Cell Lines and Molecular Docking Simulations.', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.', 'PIM1: a promising target in patients with triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Targeting Myc-driven stress addiction in colorectal cancer.', 'Strategies to target the cancer driver MYC in tumor cells.', 'When Just One Phosphate Is One Too Many: The Multifaceted Interplay between Myc and Kinases.', 'The clinical and molecular characteristics of progressive hypothalamic/optic pathway pilocytic astrocytoma.', 'PIM2 Expression Induced by Proinflammatory Macrophages Suppresses Immunotherapy Efficacy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

However, alternative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening strategies for the population may exist, optimizing the effects on mortality reduction, quality of life, overdiagnosis, and costs.  Methods:   Based on data of the ERSPC trial, we predicted the numbers of prostate cancers diagnosed, prostate cancer deaths averted, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, and cost-effectiveness of 68 screening strategies starting at age 55 years, with a PSA threshold of 3, using microsimulation modeling. The screening strategies varied by age to stop screening and screening interval (one to 14 years or once in a lifetime screens), and therefore number of tests.  Results:   Screening at short intervals of three years or less was more cost-effective than using longer intervals. Screening at ages 55 to 59 years with two-year intervals had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $73000 per QALY gained and was considered optimal. With this strategy, lifetime prostate cancer mortality reduction was predicted as 13%, and 33% of the screen-detected cancers were overdiagnosed. When better quality of life for the post-treatment period could be achieved, an older age of 65 to 72 years for ending screening was obtained.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer screening can be cost-effective when it is limited to two or three screens between ages 55 to 59 years. Screening above age 63 years is less cost-effective because of loss of QALYs because of overdiagnosis.""","""['E A M Heijnsdijk', 'T M de Carvalho', 'A Auvinen', 'M Zappa', 'V Nelen', 'M Kwiatkowski', 'A Villers', 'A Páez', 'S M Moss', 'T L J Tammela', 'F Recker', 'L Denis', 'S V Carlsson', 'E M Wever', 'C H Bangma', 'F H Schröder', 'M J Roobol', 'J Hugosson', 'H J de Koning']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Re: Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a simulation study based on ERSPC data.', 'Response.', 'Re: Cost-Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Screening: A Simulation Study Based on ERSPC Data.', 'Re: Cost-Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Screening: A Simulation Study Based on ERSPC Data.', 'Re: Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a simulation study based on ERSPC data.', 'Economic Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening and Selective Treatment Strategies.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Association Between Primary Care Use Prior to Cancer Diagnosis and Subsequent Cancer Mortality in the Veterans Affairs Health System.', 'Cost-effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Screening Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Standard Biopsy Based on the STHLM3-MRI Study.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate Cancer Screening in the UK: A Decision Model Analysis Based on the CAP Trial.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analyses of Lung Cancer Screening Using Low-Dose Computed Tomography: A Systematic Review Assessing Strategy Comparison and Risk Stratification.', 'Unmet Healthcare Needs among College Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for System-Wide and Structural Changes for Service Delivery.']"""

Methods:   We prospectively followed 4459 men initially diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study from 1988 through 2010 and examined whether selenium supplement use (from selenium-specific supplements and multivitamins) after diagnosis was associated with risk of biochemical recurrence, prostate cancer mortality, and, secondarily, cardiovascular disease mortality and overall mortality, using Cox proportional hazards models. All P values were from two-sided tests.  Results:   We documented 965 deaths, 226 (23.4%) because of prostate cancer and 267 (27.7%) because of cardiovascular disease, during a median follow-up of 8.9 years. In the biochemical recurrence analysis, we documented 762 recurrences during a median follow-up of 7.8 years. Crude rates per 1000 person-years for prostate cancer death were 5.6 among selenium nonusers and 10.5 among men who consumed 140 or more μg/day. Crude rates per 1000 person-years were 28.2 vs 23.5 for all-cause mortality and 28.4 vs 29.3 for biochemical recurrence, for nonuse vs highest-dose categories, respectively. In multivariable analyses, men who consumed 1 to 24 μg/day, 25 to 139 μg/day, and 140 or more μg/day of supplemental selenium had a 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73 to 1.91), 1.33 (95% CI = 0.77 to 2.30), and 2.60-fold (95% CI = 1.44 to 4.70) greater risk of prostate cancer mortality compared with nonusers, respectively, P trend = .001. There was no statistically significant association between selenium supplement use and biochemical recurrence, cardiovascular disease mortality, or overall mortality.  Conclusion:   Selenium supplementation of 140 or more μg/day after diagnosis of nonmetastatic prostate cancer may increase risk of prostate cancer mortality.

Purpose:   To evaluate: (i) whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the T2 signal intensity (SI), and a combination of both parameters allow for an improved discrimination of Gleason Score (GS) ≥7 (intermediate and high risk) and GS <7 (low risk) in PCA; and (ii) whether ADC may distinguish between 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 PCA (primary Gleason grades [pGG]).  Material and methods:   Prostatectomy specimens of 66 patients (mean age, 63 ± 5.6 years; 104 PCA foci) with a preceding multiparametric 1.5 T endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included. ADC (b values = 0, 100, 400, 800 s/mm(2)), standardized T2 (T2s), and the ADC/T2s ratio were tested for correlation with GS applying multivariate analysis. ADC cutoff values were calculated for prediction of GS and pGG, and logarithm of the odds (LOGIT) was used to express the probability for GS and pGG. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by ROC analysis.  Results:   We found an almost linear negative relationship of ADC for GS ≥7 (P = 0.002). The effect of ADC for GS ≥7 (adjusted odds ratio = 0.995) was almost identical for peripheral and transition zone PCA (P = 0.013 and P < 0.001, respectively). ADC showed an AUC of 78.9% for discrimination between GS <7 and GS ≥7. An ADC cutoff of <1.005 × 10(-3 )mm(2)/s indicated a GS ≥7 (90.5% sensitivity, 62.5% specificity). Within the group of GS = 7 PCA, an ADC > 0.762 × 10(-3 )mm(2)/s indicated a pGG of 3 (AUC = 69.6%).

Summary answer:   We developed a method to produce a cytocompatible decellularized testicular matrix (DTM) while maintaining the native tissue-specific characteristics and components.  What is known already:   The potential benefits of tissue-specific scaffolds consisting of naturally-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) have been demonstrated using a wide variety of animal and human tissue sources. However, so far, testis scaffolds have never been considered for constructive remodelling purposes.  Study design, size, duration:   Human cadaveric testicular tissue was exposed for 24 or 48 h to 1% Triton X-100 and/or 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Acellular samples were used for further scaffold characterization purposes.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   The extent of decellularization was evaluated by histology. Confirmation of cell removal in DTM was done by a DNA quantification technique. Retention of testicular tissue-specific characteristics was evaluated by mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry, Alcian blue staining and scanning electron microscopy. Soluble toxicity and testicular cell attachment was assessed to check the cytocompatibility of DTM scaffolds.  Main results and the role of chance:   Histological analysis showed that DTM could be obtained by mechanical agitation in 1% SDS for 24 h. The resulting DTM was found to be clear of cells while retaining the typical three-dimensional structure and the major components of the native tissue scaffold, including collagen type I and IV, fibronectin, laminin and glycosaminoglycans. In addition, using proteomic analysis, we revealed numerous additional ECM proteins in DTM, indicating its complex nature. The mass spectrometry data were deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001524. Importantly, we demonstrated that DTM scaffolds are not cytotoxic, as evidenced by MTT assay not showing an aberrant fibroblast proliferation activity after indirect exposure, and support testicular cell attachment and infiltration.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   The functionality of human testicular cells in DTM needs to be investigated.  Wider implications of the findings:   Our results suggest that the insights into the molecular composition of the testicular ECM provide new clues for the unravelling of its important yet poorly understood role in regulating testicular function, and DTM-based bioscaffolds are promising components for the development of human in vitro spermatogenesis as a treatment for various types of male fertility disorders.""","""['Y Baert', 'J-B Stukenborg', 'M Landreh', 'J De Kock', 'H Jörnvall', 'O Söder', 'E Goossens']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Hum Reprod""","""['Preparation of Scaffolds from Decellularized Testicular Matrix.', 'Development of a Cytocompatible Scaffold from Pig Immature Testicular Tissue Allowing Human Sertoli Cell Attachment, Proliferation and Functionality.', 'Development and Characterization of Acellular Extracellular Matrix Scaffolds from Porcine Menisci for Use in Cartilage Tissue Engineering.', 'Research progress of decellularization and application in tissue engineering.', 'Decellularized orthopaedic tissue-engineered grafts: biomaterial scaffolds synthesised by therapeutic cells.', 'Biomaterials for Testicular Bioengineering: How far have we come and where do we have to go?', 'Application of decellularized vascular matrix in small-diameter vascular grafts.', 'Spleen extracellular matrix provides a supportive microenvironment for β-cell function.', 'Distribution of extracellular matrix related proteins in normal and cryptorchid ziwuling black goat testes.', 'Perfusion in Organ-on-Chip Models and Its Applicability to the Replication of Spermatogenesis In Vitro.']"""

Following treatment with LND, each of these tumors exhibits a rapid decrease in intracellular pH, a small decrease in extracellular pH, a concomitant monotonic decrease in nucleoside triphosphate and an increase in inorganic phosphate over a 2-3 h period. We have previously demonstrated that selective intracellular tumor acidification potentiates response of this melanoma model to melphalan (7.5 mg/kg, i.v.), producing an estimated 89% cell kill based on tumor growth delay analysis. We now show that, in both DB-1 melanoma and HCC1806 breast carcinoma, LND potentiates response to doxorubicin, producing 95% cell kill in DB-1 melanoma at 7.5 mg/kg, i.v. doxorubicin and 98% cell kill at 10.0 mg/kg doxorubicin, and producing a 95% cell kill in HCC1806 breast carcinoma at 12.0 mg/kg doxorubicin. Potentiation of doxorubicin may result from cation trapping of the weakly basic anthracycline. Recent experience with the clinical treatment of melanoma and other forms of human cancer suggests that these diseases will probably not be cured by a single therapeutic procedure other than surgery. A multimodality therapeutic approach will be required.

PRK1 regulates cell migration and gene expression through its kinase activity, but does not affect cell proliferation. Transcriptome and interactome analyses uncover that PRK1 regulates expression of migration-relevant genes by interacting with the scaffold protein sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9/JIP4). SPAG9 and PRK1 colocalize in human cancer tissue and are required for p38-phosphorylation and cell migration. Accordingly, depletion of either ETS domain-containing protein Elk-1 (ELK1), an effector of p38-signalling or p38 depletion hinders cell migration and changes expression of migration-relevant genes as observed upon PRK1-depletion. Importantly, a PRK1 inhibitor prevents metastases in mice, showing that the PRK1-pathway is a promising target to hamper prostate cancer metastases in vivo.

Patients were evaluated monthly for serological PSA response and safety. FCH-PET/CT was done at baseline and after 3 to 6 weeks. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models addressed potential predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Declines in PSA level of ≥50% were seen in 21 of 43 (49%) patients. Forty-two patients were evaluable for FCH-PET/CT response. FCH-PET/CT bone flare was observed in 4 of 42 (10%) evaluable patients.

Materials and methods:   Eighty-seven patients with clinically localised prostate cancer scheduled for radical prostatectomy were prospectively enrolled. Multiparametric MRI was performed prior to prostatectomy, and evaluated according to the ESUR MR prostate guidelines by two different readers. An MRI clinical T-stage (cTMRI), an ECE risk score, and suspicion of ECE based on tumour characteristics and personal opinion were assigned. Histopathological prostatectomy results were standard reference.  Results:   Histopathology and cTMRI showed a spearman rho correlation of 0.658 (p < 0.001) and a weighted kappa = 0.585 [CI 0.44;0.73](reader A). ECE was present in 31/87 (36 %) patients.

In the south German region he had at his disposal the most comprehensive endoscopic operation collective and the greatest experience in transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P). From 1948 to 1958 he carried out approximately 13,850 prostate resections with an average adenoma weight of 30 g and a mortality rate of <1%. The technical inadequacies of the resection instruments at that time prompted Hösel to develop a new form of resectoscope, namely the type 782. This resectoscope allowed a fast and complete resection of prostatic adenomas due to the improved visual field and better handling (rotating the operational unit) and also made the transurethral resection of larger prostatic adenomas possible. Therefore, in ""Ulm and around Ulm"" substantially larger prostatic adenomas could be endoscopically treated and open enucleation was not necessary. Prof. Hösel was an international force as a urologist and in Germany was ranked as one of the pioneers in the field of endoscopic prostate surgery.

Adverse body fat distribution, considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is not reflected by the body mass index (BMI).  Objective:   The purpose of this work was to assess anthropometric indices which provide a better estimate of body fat distribution and to evaluate their association with clinical and histopathological parameters of prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   In patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy between March 2011 and March 2013, height, weight, waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference were measured, then the BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were calculated. The relationships between anthropometric measures and indices and clinical and histopathological features of PCA were evaluated with uni- and multivariate analyses.  Results:   In 668 patients available for evaluation, obesity rates were 22.8 %, 50.6% and 30.2 % as defined by BMI ≥ 30, WHR ≥ 1 and WHtR ≥ 0.6, respectively. On univariate analysis, WC and WHtR ≥ 0.6 correlated with tumor volume (TV) > 2.1 cm(2) (p < 0.05), respectively. WC and WHtR were independent predictors of a TV ≥ 2.1 cm(2) (p < 0.05) and a WHtR ≥ 0.6 was an independent predictor of a TV ≥ 2.1 cm(2) (p < 0.018, risk ratio 1.506, 95 % confidence interval 1.072-2.115).

The gene and protein expression levels of NOB1 were detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis in fresh samples of PCa and matched adjacent noncancerous tissues (n=32). NOB1 expression was also assessed using immunohistochemistry in a large number of patients with PCa (n=456) and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues between December 2003 and December 2010. The association between NOB1 expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis was investigated. The expression of NOB1 was found to be higher in the fresh samples of PCa than in the paired adjacent noncancerous tissues at the gene and protein levels. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the positive expression rates of NOB1 in PCa and the paired adjacent noncancerous tissues were 53% (242/456) and 6.1% (28/456), respectively. NOB1 expression was significantly correlated with Gleason score (P<0.001) and distant metastasis (P<0.001). Furthermore, patients with PCa with positive NOB1 expression had lower overall survival and recurrence‑free survival (RFS) compared with those with negative NOB1 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that NOB1 was an independent marker of RFS (hazard ratio, 3.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.41‑6.35; P=0.006).

Stress-induced autophagy is attenuated with CLU silencing in CLU(-/-) mice and human prostate cancer cells. CLU-enhanced cell survival occurs via autophagy-dependent pathways, and is reduced following autophagy inhibition. Combining CLU inhibition with anticancer treatments attenuates autophagy activation, increases apoptosis and reduces prostate cancer growth.

The dysregulation of lncRNA has been implicated in various complex human diseases. Although several computational methods have been developed to predict disease-related lncRNA, this still remains a considerable challenging task. In this study, we tried to construct an lncRNA-lncRNA crosstalk network by examining the significant co-occurrence of shared miRNA response elements on lncRNA transcripts from the competing endogenous RNAs viewpoint. As expected, functional analysis showed that lncRNA sharing significantly enriched interacting miRNAs tend to be involved in similar diseases and have more functionally related flanking gene sets. We further proposed a novel rank-based method, RWRHLD, to prioritize candidate lncRNA-disease associations by integrating three networks (miRNA-associated lncRNA-lncRNA crosstalk network, disease-disease similarity network and known lncRNA-disease association network) into a heterogeneous network and implementing a random walk with restart on this heterogeneous network. We used leave-one-out cross-validation to test the performance of this rank-based method in this study based on known experimentally verified lncRNA-disease associations and obtained a reliable AUC value of 0.871, which is much higher than RWR merely based on an lncRNA network, hypergeometric test and random situation.

PKPs play additional roles in cell signaling processes, such as those controlling the cellular stress response and cell proliferation. A key post-translational process controlling PKP function is phosphorylation. We have discovered that reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger the c-Src kinase-mediated tyrosine (Tyr)-195 phosphorylation of PKP3. This modification is associated with a change in the subcellular distribution of the protein. Specifically, PKP3 bearing phospho-Tyr-195 is released from the desmosomes, suggesting that phospho-Tyr-195 is relevant for the control of desmosome disassembly and function, at least in cells exposed to ROS. Tyr-195 phosphorylation is transient under normal physiological conditions and seems to be strictly regulated, as the activation of particular growth factor receptors results in a modification at this site only when tyrosine phosphatases are inactivated by pervanadate. We have identified Tyr-195 of PKP3 as a phosphorylation target of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Interestingly, this PKP3 phosphorylation also occurs in certain poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas of the prostate, suggesting a possible role in tumor progression. Our study thus identifies a new mechanism controlling PKP3 and hence desmosome function in epithelial cells.""","""['Steffen Neuber', 'Stephanie Jäger', 'Merle Meyer', 'Viktoria Wischmann', 'Peter J Koch', 'Roland Moll', 'Ansgar Schmidt']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Tissue Res""","""['Plakophilin 3 phosphorylation by ribosomal S6 kinases supports desmosome assembly.', 'Phosphorylated guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, induced by pervanadate and Src family kinases localizes to the Golgi and subcortical actin cytoskeleton.', '14-3-3 proteins regulate desmosomal adhesion via plakophilins.', 'Role of c-Src in cellular events associated with colony-stimulating factor-1-induced spreading in osteoclasts.', 'Plakophilins in desmosomal adhesion and signaling.', ""Clostridiumnovyi's Alpha-Toxin Changes Proteome and Phosphoproteome of HEp-2 Cells."", 'Desmosomes as Signaling Hubs in the Regulation of Cell Behavior.', 'Biphasic Mathematical Model of Cell-Drug Interaction That Separates Target-Specific and Off-Target Inhibition and Suggests Potent Targeted Drug Combinations for Multi-Driver Colorectal Cancer Cells.', 'Modifying the Tumour Microenvironment: Challenges and Future Perspectives for Anticancer Plasma Treatments.', 'Different signaling patterns contribute to loss of keratinocyte cohesion dependent on autoantibody profile in pemphigus.']"""

All consecutive patients planned for prostate biopsy were included in the study, and all the procedure was performed by a single surgeon aided by the specialized true targeting software. Initially, the patients underwent PHS to map the abnormal areas within the prostate that were ≥0.2 cm(3). TRUS guided biopsies were performed targeting the abnormal areas with a specialized software. Additionally, routine bisextant biopsies were also taken. The final histopathology of the target cores was compared with the bisextant cores.  Results:   A total of 43 patients underwent combined 'targeted PHS guided' and 'standard 12 core systematic' biopsies. The mean volume of abnormal area detected by PHS is 4.3 cm(3). The overall cancer detection rate was 46.5 % (20/43) with systemic cores and target cores detecting cancer in 44 % (19/43) and 26 % (11/43), respectively. The mean % cancer/core length of the PHS-TT cores were significantly higher than the systematic cores (55.4 vs. 37.5 %. p < 0.05).

Recent efforts to target PSMA for imaging prostate cancer rely on suitably functionalized low-molecular-weight agents. YC-27 is a low-molecular-weight, urea-based agent that enables near-infrared (NIR) imaging of PSMA in vivo.  Experimental design:   We have developed and validated a laparoscopic imaging system (including an optimized light source, LumiNIR) that is capable of imaging small tumor burdens with minimal background fluorescence in real-time laparoscopic extirpative surgery of small prostate tumor xenografts in murine and porcine models.  Results:   In a mouse model, we demonstrate the feasibility of using real-time NIR laparoscopic imaging to detect and surgically remove PSMA-positive xenografts. We then validate the use of our laparoscopic real-time NIR imaging system in a large animal model. Our novel light source, which is optimized for YC-27, is capable of detecting as little as 12.4 pg/mL of the compound (2.48-pg YC-27 in 200-μL agarose). Finally, in a mouse xenograft model, we demonstrate that the use of real-time NIR imaging can reduce positive surgical margins (PSM).

However, prostate cancer cells were accused of using more fatty acid than glucose to meet their bioenergetic demands. The present study was designed to evaluate the involvement of hexokinase and CPT-1 in the cell growth and proliferation of human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3, and LNCaP-FGC-10. Hexokinase and CPT-1 activities were examined in the presence of different concentrations of their inhibitors, lonidamine and etomoxir, to find the concentration of maximum inhibition ([I max]). To assess cell viability and proliferation, dimethylthiazol (MTT) assay was carried out using [I max] for 24, 48, and 72 h on PC3 and LNCaP cells. Apoptosis was determined using annexin-V, caspase-3 activity assay, Hoechst 33258 staining, and evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Moreover, ATP levels were measured following lonidamine and etomoxir exposure. In addition, to define the impact of exogenous fatty acid on the cell growth and proliferation, CPT-1 activity was evaluated in the presence of palmitate (50 μM). Hexokinase and CPT-1 activities were significantly inhibited by lonidamine [600 μM] and etomoxir [100 μM] in both cell lines. Treatment of the cells with lonidamine [600 μM] resulted in a significant ATP reduction, cell viability and apoptosis, caspase-3 activity elevation, MMP reduction, and appearance of apoptosis-related morphological changes in the cells. In contrast, etomoxir [100 μM] just decreased ATP levels in both cell lines without significant cell death and apoptosis. Compared with glucose (2 g/L), palmitate intensified CPT-1 activity in both cell lines, especially in LNCaP cells. In addition, activity of CPT-1 was higher in LNCaP than PC3 cells. Our results suggest that prostate cancer cells may metabolize glucose as a source of bioenergetic pathways. ATP could also be produced by long-chain fatty acid oxidation.

Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 (TXNDC5) is involved in protein folding and chaperone activity, and its overexpression has been reported in multiple malignancies. In the current study, we demonstrated that TXNDC5 is up-regulated following long-term androgen-deprivation treatment (ADT) and is highly overexpressed in CRPC tumors compared with hormone-naive prostate cancer (PCa) cases. Functionally, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that TXNDC5 overexpression promotes the growth of both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant PCa xenografts. Mechanistically, TXNDC5 directly interacts with the AR protein to increase its stability and thus enhances its transcriptional activity. TXDNC5-mediated CRPC growth can be fully abolished by AR inhibition, suggesting TXDNC5 up-regulation as an escape pathway for aberrant AR re-activation and CRPC growth in the milieu of low androgen. Indeed, we found that TXNDC5 is increased by ADT-induced hypoxia through HIF-1α in an miR-200b-dependent manner. Overall, we defined an important role of TXNDC5 in CRPC and further investigations are needed to screen TXNDC5 antagonists as a novel therapeutic approaches to treat PCa patients with CRPC.""","""['L Wang', 'G Song', 'X Chang', 'W Tan', 'J Pan', 'X Zhu', 'Z Liu', 'M Qi', 'J Yu', 'B Han']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Resveratrol inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-mediated androgen receptor signaling and represses tumor progression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transcription of Nrdp1 by the androgen receptor is regulated by nuclear filamin A in prostate cancer.', 'Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor is a survival and proliferation factor for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor co-regulatory networks in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Protein Disulfide Isomerases Function as the Missing Link Between Diabetes and Cancer.', 'METTL3 potentiates progression of cervical cancer by suppressing ER stress via regulating m6A modification of TXNDC5 mRNA.', 'The role and mechanism of TXNDC5 in diseases.', 'PPFIA4 promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer by enhancing mitochondrial metabolism through MTHFD2.', 'The aberrant upregulation of exon 10-inclusive SREK1 through SRSF10 acts as an oncogenic driver in human hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between 1998 and 2010, 754 men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate- (n = 627) and high-risk (n = 127) prostate cancer were treated with prostate brachytherapy at our institution. Patients received either low-dose-rate or high-dose-rate brachytherapy as monotherapy or in combination with supplemental external beam radiotherapy. Two hundred eighty-five patients (37.8%) also received androgen-deprivation therapy. Two hundred seventy-three men (36.2%) were identified as taking statin medication before initiating radiation therapy. Prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival (PSA-RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival were compared using log-rank tests. Associations of patient and treatment characteristics with outcomes were analyzed with univariate and multivariate regression. The median followup was 48 months.  Results:   The 8-year PSA-RFS for intermediate-risk, high-risk, and all patients was 92.2%, 64.1%, and 87.7%, respectively. The 8-year DMFS was 97.1%, 82.9%, and 94.9%, respectively.

Overexpression of the EMT regulator Slug is detected in basal and mesenchymal-type TNBCs and is associated with reduced E-cadherin expression and aggressive disease. The effects of Slug depend, in part, on the interaction of its N-terminal SNAG repressor domain with the chromatin-modifying protein lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1); thus, we investigated whether tranylcypromine [also known as trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine hydrochloride (PCPA) or Parnate], an inhibitor of LSD1 that blocks its interaction with Slug, suppresses the migration, invasion, and metastatic spread of TNBC cell lines. We show here that PCPA treatment induces the expression of E-cadherin and other epithelial markers and markedly suppresses migration and invasion of TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. These effects were phenocopied by Slug or LSD1 silencing. In two models of orthotopic breast cancer, PCPA treatment reduced local tumor growth and the number of lung metastases. In mice injected directly in the blood circulation with MDA-MB-231 cells, PCPA treatment or Slug silencing markedly inhibited bone metastases but had no effect on lung infiltration.

Epithelial staining was quantified and compared against a range of clinicopathologic variables. CHD8 expression was decreased in HGPIN, localized, and metastatic PCa compared to benign (P < .001).

Treatment of cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine reinduced expression.

Cyto- and genotoxicity of three selected flavonoid glycosides (naringin, diosmin and hesperidin) in DU145 prostate cancer cell line were investigated. Flavonoid glycosides decreased cancer cell number and proliferative activity in a different manner. Flavonoid glycosides induced oxidative stress: intracellular total ROS and superoxide production were augmented after flavonoid treatment. Flavonoid glycosides stimulated DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and micronuclei production. Diosmin was found the most potent genotoxic agent in DU145 cells, which, in turn, resulted in its pro-apoptotic activity. The more robust recruitment of 53BP1 was correlated with lower DNA and chromosomal damage after naringin and hesperidin treatment compared with diosmin treatment. Flavonoid glycosides were also found to be DNA hypomethylating agents with an ability to modulate cancer cell epigenome leading to changes in the gene expression patterns.

These isozymes play a central role in steroid hormone physiology by catalyzing the reduction of 3-keto-4-ene-steroids into more active 5α-reduced derivatives, including the conversion of testosterone (T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). A third 5α-reductase (SRD5A3, -type 3), which is overexpressed in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells, has been identified; however, its enzymatic characteristics are practically unknown. Here, we isolated a cDNA encoding hamster Srd5a3 (hSrd5a3) and performed functional metabolic assays to investigate its biochemical properties. The cloned cDNA encodes a 330 amino acid protein that is 87% identical to the homologous protein in mice and 78% to that in humans. However, hSrd5a3 exhibits low sequence homology with its counterparts hSrd5a1 (19%) and hSrd5a2 (17%). A fusion protein consisting of hSrd5a3 and green fluorescent protein provided evidence for cytoplasmic localization in transfected mammalian cells. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that, Srd5a3 mRNA was present in nearly all hamster tissues, with high expression in the cerebellum, Harderian gland and testis. Functional assays expressing hSrd5a3 cDNA in HEK-293 cells revealed that this isozyme is unable to reduce T into DHT. Further expression assays confirmed that similar to testosterone, progesterone, androstenedione and corticosterone are not reduced by hSrd5a3 or human SRD5A3. Together, these results indicate that hSrd5a3 lacks the catalytic activity to transform 3-keto-4-ene-compounds; therefore 5α-reductase type 3 may not be involved in 5α-reduction of steroids.""","""['B Chávez', 'L Ramos', 'R García-Becerra', 'F Vilchis']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Steroids""","""['Cloning and differential expression of steroid 5 alpha-reductase type 1 (Srd5a1) and type 2 (Srd5a2) from the Harderian glands of hamsters.', 'Characterization of 5α-reductase activity and isoenzymes in human abdominal adipose tissues.', 'Novel 5 alpha-steroid reductase (SRD5A3, type-3) is overexpressed in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Pathways and genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism in male pigs: a review and update.', '5alpha-reductase isozymes and androgen actions in the prostate.', 'Over-expression of SRD5A3 and its prognostic significance in breast cancer.', 'Effects on Steroid 5-Alpha Reductase Gene Expression of Thai Rice Bran Extracts and Molecular Dynamics Study on SRD5A2.', 'Ecotype differences in aggression, neural activity and behaviorally relevant gene expression in cichlid fish.', 'The gut microbiota is a major regulator of androgen metabolism in intestinal contents.', ""Transcriptome analysis of differentially expressed genes in rabbits' ovaries by digital gene-expression profiling.""]"""

The CAPRA-S c-index to predict biochemical recurrence, metastasis and cancer specific mortality was 0.80, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively. Metastasis developed in 417 men and 196 men died of prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   The CAPRA-S score was accurate when applied in a European study cohort. It predicted biochemical recurrence, metastasis and cancer specific mortality after radical prostatectomy with a c-index of greater than 0.80.

We investigated the impact of rural status and urologist density on kidney and renal pelvis, bladder and prostate cancer mortality at the county level in Illinois.  Materials and methods:   We stratified the 102 Illinois counties by 2003 RUCCs as urban (36, RUCCs 1 to 3) and rural (66, RUCCs 4 to 9). Area Health Resource Files were used for county demographic data and urologist density. County level age adjusted mortality rates from 1990 to 2010 were derived from National Center for Health Statistics data using SEER*Stat. We examined the associations of urological cancer mortality rates with rural status and urologist density.  Results:   Average urologist density significantly differed between rural and urban counties (1.9 vs 3.4/100,000 population, p < 0.01). The kidney and renal pelvis cancer mortality rate in rural counties was higher than in urban counties while that of prostate cancer was lower (4.9 vs 4.3 and 28.7 vs 32.2/100,000 population, respectively, each p < 0.01). Urologist density correlated with the mortality rate of kidney and renal pelvis cancer (Pearson coefficient -0.33, p < 0.01) but not with the bladder or prostate cancer mortality rate. Multiple regression analysis revealed that rurality and lower urologist density (p = 0.01 and < 0.05) were significantly associated with higher kidney and renal pelvis cancer mortality.  Conclusions:   Rural residence and low urologist density were associated with increased kidney and renal pelvis cancer mortality on the county level in Illinois. Further expansion and testing of evidence-based telemedicine is warranted because remote technical consultation is now technologically feasible, effective, inexpensive and satisfactory to patients.""","""['Thomas P Frye', 'Daniel J Sadowski', 'Whitney E Zahnd', 'Wiley D Jenkins', 'Danuta I Dynda', 'Georgia S Mueller', 'Shaheen R Alanee', 'Kevin T McVary']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Reply by author.', 'Editorial comment.', 'Kidney Cancer in Rural Illinois: Lower Incidence Yet Higher Mortality Rates.', 'Urologist density and county-level urologic cancer mortality.', 'Geographic distribution of urologists throughout the United States using a county level approach.', 'Manuscript title: Geospatial analysis of Cancer risk and residential proximity to coal mines in Illinois.', 'Detection and treatment of prostate cancer: perspective of the urologist.', 'Rural-Urban Disparities in Patient Care Experiences among Prostate Cancer Survivors: A SEER-CAHPS Study.', 'Low Urologist Density Predicts High-Cost Surgical Treatment of Stone Disease.', ""Decomposing Urban and Rural Disparities of Preventable ED Visits Among Patients With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: Evidence of the Availability of Health Care Resources."", 'Under Treatment of Prostate Cancer in Rural Locations.', 'Continuous Rural-Urban Coding for Cancer Disparity Studies: Is It Appropriate for Statistical Analysis?']"""

Methods:   (177)Lu-DOTA-gluBBN was prepared as previously published [1]. Human prostate PC-3 tumor cells were used to determine the binding (Kd) retention and efflux of (177)Lu-DOTA-gluBBN. Pharmacokinetic, imaging, and radiotherapy studies were performed in PC-3 xenografted mice.  Results:   The Kd value of (177)Lu-DOTA-gluBBN was 0.63 nM, with a maximum binding capacity (Bmax) of 669.7 fmol/10(6) cells (4.04×10(5) GRPR/cell). During a 2-hr incubation, 90.1±0.4% of the cell-associated radio-peptide was internalized, and 56.3±7.1% of the internalized radio-peptide was externalized in vitro. High amounts of the radio-peptide were rapidly accumulated in a PC-3 tumor in vivo, and the % ID/g of the tumor was 12.42±2.15 1 hr p.i. The radio-peptide was quickly cleared from the blood, yielding tumor-to-blood ratios of 39.22±17.36 at 1 hr p.i. and 330.67±131.23 at 24hr p.i. In addition, (177)Lu-DOTA-gluBBN was clearly visualized in PC-3 tumors 1 hr p.i. and significantly inhibited the tumor growth (P<0.05).

SBRT could minimize rectal toxicity by reducing the volume of rectum receiving high radiation doses and offers the potential radiobiologic benefits of hypofractionation. This study sought to evaluate the incidence and severity of proctitis following SBRT for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Between February 2008 and July 2011, 269 men with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated definitively with SBRT monotherapy at Georgetown University Hospital. All patients were treated to 35-36.25Gy in 5 fractions delivered with the CyberKnife Radiosurgical System (Accuray). Rectal bleeding was recorded and scored using the CTCAE v.4. Telangiectasias were graded using the Vienna Rectoscopy Score (VRS). Proctitis was assessed via the Bowel domain of the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC)-26 at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months post-SBRT.  Results:   The median age was 69 years with a median prostate volume of 39 cc. The median follow-up was 3.9 years with a minimum follow-up of two years. The 2-year actuarial incidence of late rectal bleeding ≥ grade 2 was 1.5%. Endoscopy revealed VRS Grade 2 rectal telangiectasias in 11% of patients. All proctitis symptoms increased at one month post-SBRT but returned to near-baseline with longer follow-up. The most bothersome symptoms were bowel urgency and frequency. At one month post-SBRT, 11.2% and 8.5% of patients reported a moderate to big problem with bowel urgency and frequency, respectively. The EPIC bowel summary scores declined transiently at 1 month and experienced a second, more protracted decline between 6 months and 18 months before returning to near-baseline at two years post-SBRT. Prior to treatment, 4.1% of men felt their bowel function was a moderate to big problem which increased to 11.5% one month post-SBRT but returned to near-baseline at two years post-SBRT.  Conclusions:   In this single institution cohort, the rate and severity of proctitis observed following SBRT is low. QOL decreased on follow-up; however, our results compare favorably to those reported for patients treated with alternative radiation modalities.

Radiotherapy toxicity and occurrence of symptoms or complications of lymphocele were analyzed. Dosimetric data (IMRT plans) and the modification of lymphocele volume during radiotherapy (cone beam CT [CBCT] scan) were evaluated.  Results:   Between January 2011 and July 2013, in 30 of 308 patients (10%) treated with radiotherapy after prostatectomy, pelvic lymphocele was detected on the simulation CT. The median lymphocele volume was 47 cm(3) (range, 6-467.3 cm(3)). Lymphocele was not included in planning target volume (PTV) in 8 cases (27%). Maximum dose to lymphocele was 57 Gy (range, 5.7-73.3 Gy). Radiotherapy was well tolerated. In all but 2 patients, lymphoceles remained asymptomatic. Lymphocele drainage-because of symptom occurrence-had to be performed in 2 patients during IMRT and in one patient, 7 weeks after IMRT. CBCT at the end of IMRT showed reduction in lymphocele volume and position compared with the initial data (median reduction of 37%), more pronounced in lymphoceles included in PTV.  Conclusion:   Radiotherapy after prostatectomy in the presence of pelvic asymptomatic lymphocele is feasible with acceptable acute and late toxicity. The volume of lymphoceles decreased during radiotherapy and this phenomenon might require intermediate radiotherapy plan evaluation.""","""['Barbara Alicja Jereczek-Fossa', 'Sarah Pia Colangione', 'Cristiana Fodor', 'Stefania Russo', 'Raffaella Cambria', 'Dario Zerini', 'Maria Bonora', 'Agnese Cecconi', 'Barbara Vischioni', 'Andrea Vavassori', 'Deliu Victor Matei', 'Danilo Bottero', 'Antonio Brescia', 'Gennaro Musi', 'Federica Mazzoleni', 'Franco Orsi', 'Guido Bonomo', 'Ottavio De Cobelli', 'Roberto Orecchia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Relationship between pelvic organ-at-risk dose and clinical target volume in postprostatectomy patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Feasibility of IMRT to cover pelvic nodes while escalating the dose to the prostate gland: dosimetric data on 35 consecutive patients.', 'Comparative toxicity and dosimetric profile of whole-pelvis versus prostate bed-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy after prostatectomy.', 'Toxicity assessment of pelvic intensity-modulated radiotherapy with hypofractionated simultaneous integrated boost to prostate for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Dose-volume relationships for acute bowel toxicity in patients treated with pelvic nodal irradiation for prostate cancer.', 'Hemopatch to Prevent Lymphatic Leak after Robotic Prostatectomy and Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Conformal 3D planned radiotherapy for pelvic lymphoceles following surgery for urological cancer: A case study.']"""

The aim was to study changes in prostate volume during treatment by analysing catheter configurations on three subsequent scans.  Methods:   Prostate expansion was determined for 19 patients from the change in spatial distribution of the implanted catheters, using three CT-scans: a planning CT (CT1) and two CTs after 24 and 48 hours (CT2, CT3). An additional 4 patients only received one repeat CT (after 24 hours). The mean radial distance (MRD) of all dwell positions to the geometric centre of all dwell positions used was calculated to evaluate volume changes. From three implanted markers changes in inter-marker distances were assessed. The relative shifts of all dwell positions were determined using catheter- and marker-based registrations. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to compare the results from the different time points.  Results:   The MRDs measured on the two repeat CTs were significantly different from CT1. The mean prostate volume change derived from the difference in MRD was +4.3% (range -9.3% to +15.6%) for CT1-CT2 (p < .05) and +4.4% (range -7.5% to +16.3%) for CT1-CT3 (p < .05). These values represented a mean increase of 1.2 cm(3) in the first 24 hours and 1.5 cm(3) in the subsequent 24 hours. There was no clear sign of prostate expansion from the change in inter-marker distance (CT1-CT2: 0.2 ± 1.8 mm; CT1-CT3: 0.6 ± 2.2 mm). Catheter configuration remained stable; shifts in catheter positions were largest in the C-C direction: 0 ± 1.8 mm for CT1-CT2 and 0 ± 1.4 mm for CT2-CT3.  Conclusions:   The volume changes derived from catheter displacements were small and therefore considered clinically insignificant. Implant configuration remains stable during 2 days of treatment, confirming the safety of this technique.""","""['Anna M Dinkla', 'Bradley R Pieters', 'Kees Koedooder', 'Niek van Wieringen', 'Rob van der Laarse', 'Arjan Bel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Deviations from the planned dose during 48 hours of stepping source prostate brachytherapy caused by anatomical variations.', 'Dosimetric impact of prostate volume change between CT-based HDR brachytherapy fractions.', 'Prostate HDR brachytherapy catheter displacement between planning and treatment delivery.', 'Impact of oedema on implant geometry and dosimetry for temporary high dose rate brachytherapy of the prostate.', 'Evaluation of anatomy-based dwell position and inverse optimization in high-dose-rate brachytherapy of prostate cancer: a dosimetric comparison to a conventional cylindrical dwell position, geometric optimization, and dose-point optimization.', 'Comparison of post-implant dosimetrics between intraoperatively built custom-linked seeds and loose seeds by sector analysis at 24 hours and 1 month for localized prostate cancer.', 'Correlations of post-implant regional dosimetric parameters at 24 hours and one month, with clinical results of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Permanent prostate brachytherapy postimplant magnetic resonance imaging dosimetry using positive contrast magnetic resonance imaging markers.']"""

Developing an understanding in this area can help to identify men who are at high risk of inadequate support and suggest directions for appropriately targeted interventions. Moreover, little is known about how men affected by prostate cancer mobilise social support in their self-management behaviours over time. This is the first study to test the effects of coping and social support on HRQoL and emotional outcome, and assessed the self-management behaviours of men affected by prostate cancer overtime.  Methods:   The study population was 74 prostate cancer patients with a mean age of 67.3 (SD 7.9) years and mixed treatment modalities. The EORTC QLQ-C30, PR25 and HADS were used to assess the dependant variables before treatment and at six months follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS version 17.0 using parametric tests and non-parametric tests.  Results:   A significant decline in quality of life was observed at 6 months post diagnosis (p < 0.001). Perceived social support before radical treatment was the most important social support construct that predicted better global quality of life and less depression at six months, explaining approximately 30% of the variance. Despite men's self-management efforts and use of social support overtime, self-management self-efficacy significantly reduced at six months (p < 0.05).

To study angiogenesis HUVEC clones with decreased fgl-2 mRNA were generated by specific siRNA. To study tumorigenesis SCID mice were implanted with intact (wild type) and fgl-2-silenced PC-3 clones. IFN-γ treated HUVEC expressing increased fgl-2 mRNA exhibited significant capillary sprouting that was not inhibited by hirudin, whereas fgl-2 silencing completely inhibited blood-vessel formation. Tumors (poorly differentiated carcinoma) developed in all 12 mice injected with wild type PC-3 compared with 8/12 mice injected with the fgl-2-silenced PC-3 clone. The tumors developed by fgl-2-silenced PC-3 clones were smaller and less aggressive and contained significantly fewer blood vessels (p<0.05). All tumors' sections were negative for thrombin staining, indicating that FGL-2-induced tumorigenesis was not mediated by thrombin. In fgl-2-silenced tumors there was a decrease in fgl-2 mRNA (p=0.02) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p<0.05) by 80% and a 20%, respectively. The mechanism underlying these processes, studied in PC-3 clones, revealed that fgl-2 silencing was associated with a 65% decrease in FGF-2 mRNA (p<0.01) and a 30% down regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p<0.05). Together, these results suggest that FGL-2 mediates angiogenesis and tumorigenesis not by thrombin-mediated mechanism but rather through FGF-2/ERK signaling pathway.

Patients and methods:   Randomised, controlled trial of 56 men with 1-year follow-up. Three devices were tested for 3 weeks each: sheath drainage system, body-worn urinal (BWU) and penile clamp. Device and pad performance were assessed. Quality of life (QoL) was measured at baseline and follow-up with the King's Health Questionnaire. Stated (intended use) and revealed (actual use) preference for products were assessed. Value-for-money was gathered.  Results:   Substantial and significant differences in performance were found. The sheath was rated as 'good' for extended use (e.g. golf and travel) when pad changing is difficult; for keeping skin dry, not leaking, not smelling and convenient for storage and travel. The BWU was generally rated worse than the sheath and was mainly used for similar activities but by men who could not use a sheath (e.g. retracted penis) and was not good for seated activities. The clamp was good for short vigorous activities like swimming/exercise; it was the most secure, least likely to leak, most discreet but almost all men described it as uncomfortable or painful. The pads were good for everyday activities and best for night-time use; most easy to use, comfortable when dry but most likely to leak and most uncomfortable when wet. There was a preference for having a mixture of products to meet daytime needs; around two-thirds of men were using a combination of pads and devices after testing compared with baseline.  Conclusions:   This is the first trial to systematically compare different continence management devices for men. Pads and devices have different strengths, which make them particularly suited to certain circumstances and activities. Most men prefer to use pads at night but would choose a mixture of pads and devices during the day.

Methods:   Using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data, we identified 149,354 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1991 to 2007. Subjects treated with TRT were stratified by duration of treatment. Weighted propensity score methods were used to adjust for differences between groups. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to assess the effect of injectable TRT exposure on outcomes.  Main outcome measure:   Overall mortality (OM), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and use of salvage androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Results:   Men treated with TRT, regardless of duration, did not experience higher OM or PCSM (all hazard ratio [HR] <1.0, all P ≤ 0.002). We found no difference in use of salvage ADT in the ≤ 30-day and 31-60 day groups compared with no-TRT (HR 1.23 and 1.05, P=0.06 and 0.81, respectively), whereas it was lower for men on long-term TRT (HR 0.70, P=0.04).

Using DAG(+)-specific MPIS, we were able to identify 32 PtdIns, 28 PtdInsP, 30 PtdInsP2, and 3 PtdInsP3 molecular species from bovine brain extracts or prostatic cancer cell lines in an efficient and time-saving manner. Our analysis revealed a large range of fatty acyl compositions in phosphoinositides not obtained previously from mammalian samples. We also developed a method that involves isotopic labeling of endogenous phosphoinositides with deuterated diazomethane (CD2N2) for quantitation of phosphoinositides. CD2N2 was generated in situ through acid-catalyzed H/D exchange and methanolysis of trimethylsilyl diazomethane (TMS-diazomethane). Phosphoinositides, extracted from a PC3 prostatic cancer cell line, were labeled either with CH2N2 or CD2N2 and mixed in known proportions for DAG(+)-specific MPIS-based mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The results indicate that isotopic labeling is capable of providing accurate quantitation of PtdInsP3, PtdInsP2, and PtdInsP with adequate linearity as well as high reproducibility with an average coefficient variation of 18.9%. More importantly, this new methods excluded the need for multiple phosphoinositide internal standards. DAG(+)-specific MPIS and isotopic labeling based MS analysis of phosphoinositides offers unique advantages over existing approaches and presents a powerful tool for research of phosphoinositide metabolism.""","""['Tanxi Cai', 'Qingbo Shu', 'JunJie Hou', 'Peibin Liu', 'Lili Niu', 'Xiaojing Guo', 'Charles C Liu', 'Fuquan Yang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Characterization and relative quantification of phospholipids based on methylation and stable isotopic labeling.', 'A new approach to measuring phosphoinositides in cells by mass spectrometry.', 'Phosphoinositide profiling in complex lipid mixtures using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.', 'Analysis of intact phosphoinositides in biological samples.', 'Phosphoinositides and cytokinesis: the ""PIP"" of the iceberg.', 'Quantification of Dolichyl Phosphates Using Phosphate Methylation and Reverse-Phase Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry.', 'A mass spectrometric method for in-depth profiling of phosphoinositide regioisomers and their disease-associated regulation.', 'The phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthase PgsA utilizes a trifurcated amphipathic cavity for catalysis at the membrane-cytosol interface.', 'Quantitative Analysis of Polyphosphoinositide, Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, and Phosphatidylglycerol Species by Shotgun Lipidomics After Methylation.', 'Enhancing detection and characterization of lipids using charge manipulation in electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry.']"""

We sought to assess pathological features and biochemical recurrence (BCR) in young men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) to determine if there is a difference between black and white men closer to the time of disease initiation.  Methods:   We identified 551 white and 99 black men at a tertiary cancer center who underwent RP at ≤50 years of age. Baseline and pathological features were compared between the two groups. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to examine the association of race and BCR, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to determine biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS).  Results:   There were no differences in median age at surgery, biopsy Gleason score, or comorbidity. Black men had higher preoperative PSA (6.1 ng/ml vs 4.7 ng/ml, p = 0.004), but a greater percentage were cT1c (78% vs 63%), compared to white men. On multivariate analysis, black men demonstrated significantly lower odds of non-organ confined disease (OR 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.81; p = 0.01) and extracapsular extension (ECE) (OR 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.81, p = 0.01), and had no difference in Gleason score upgrading and seminal vesicle invasion compared to white men. There was no significant difference in bRFS in men with organ-confined disease; however, among men with locally advanced disease black men trended towards greater BCR (p = 0.052). Black men had 2-year bRFS of 56% vs 75% in white men.  Conclusions:   In this single institution study, there does not appear to be a racial disparity in outcomes among younger men who receive RP for prostate cancer. Black and white men in our cohort demonstrate similar bRFS with pathologically confirmed organ-confined disease. There may be greater risk of BCR among black men locally advanced disease compared to white men, suggesting that locally advanced disease is biologically more aggressive in black men.""","""['Kelvin A Moses', 'Ling Y Chen', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Melanie Bernstein', 'Karim A Touijer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Race and risk of metastases and survival after radical prostatectomy: Results from the SEARCH database.', 'Race is not an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in an equal access medical center.', 'Prostate cancer biochemical recurrence stage for stage is more frequent among African-American than white men with locally advanced but not organ-confined disease.', 'Pathological outcome and biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy in African-American, Afro-Caribbean (Jamaican) and Caucasian-American men: an international comparison.', 'Incidence of prostate cancer will double by the year 2030: the argument against.', 'Racial disparities in Black men with prostate cancer: A literature review.', 'Racial Differences in Immunological Landscape Modifiers Contributing to Disparity in Prostate Cancer.', 'Racial differences in distribution of fatty acids in prostate cancer and benign prostatic tissues.', 'Tumor characteristics, oncological and functional outcomes after radical prostatectomy in very young men\u2009≤\u200945\xa0years of age.', 'Race and risk of metastases and survival after radical prostatectomy: Results from the SEARCH database.']"""

Although the role of angiogenesis in its progression is well established, the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy is not clearly proved. Whether this could depend on differential responses between tumor and normal endothelial cells has not been tested.  Methods:   We isolated and characterized three lines of endothelial cells from prostate cancer and we tested the effect of Sunitinib and Sorafenib, and the combined treatment with the anti-androgen Casodex, on their angiogenic functions.  Results:   Endothelial cells isolated from prostate tumors showed angiogenic properties and expression of androgen and vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptors. Sunitinib affected their proliferation, survival and motility while Sorafenib only showed a minor effect. At variance, Sunitinib and Sorafenib showed similar cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic effects on normal endothelial cells. Sorafenib and Sunitinib inhibited vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor2 phosphorylation of prostate cancer endothelial cells, while they differentially modulated Akt phosphorylation as no inhibitory effect of Sorafenib was observed on Akt activation. The combined treatment of Casodex reverted the observed resistance to Sorafenib both on cell viability and on Akt activation, whereas it did not modify the response to Sunitinib.

Regulation of microRNA (miRNA) by the VDR appears to be important to mediate its actions, for example, to control cell growth. To identify if and to what extent VDR-regulated miRNA patterns change in prostate cancer progression, we undertook miRNA microarray analyses in 7 cell models representing non-malignant and malignant prostate cells (RWPE-1, RWPE-2, HPr1, HPr1AR, LNCaP, LNCaP-C4-2, and PC-3). To focus on primary VDR regulatory events, we undertook expression analyses after 30 minutes treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3. Across all models, 111 miRNAs were significantly modulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Of these, only 5 miRNAs were modulated in more than one cell model, and of these, only 3 miRNAs were modulated in the same direction. The patterns of miRNA regulation, and the networks they targeted, significantly distinguished the different cell types. Integration of 1α,25(OH)2D3-regulated miRNAs with published VDR ChIP-seq data showed significant enrichment of VDR peaks in flanking regions of miRNAs. Furthermore, mRNA and miRNA expression analyses in non-malignant RWPE-1 cells revealed patterns of miRNA and mRNA co-regulation; specifically, 13 significant reciprocal patterns were identified and these patterns were also observed in TCGA prostate cancer data. Lastly, motif search analysis revealed differential motif enrichment within VDR peaks flanking mRNA compared to miRNA genes. Together, this study revealed that miRNAs are rapidly regulated in a highly cell-type specific manner, and are significantly co-integrated with mRNA regulation.""","""['Prashant K Singh', 'Mark D Long', 'Sebastiano Battaglia', 'Qiang Hu', 'Song Liu', 'Lara E Sucheston-Campbell', 'Moray J Campbell']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['Recruitment of NCOR1 to VDR target genes is enhanced in prostate cancer cells and associates with altered DNA methylation patterns.', 'Epigenetic distortion to VDR transcriptional regulation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate cancer cell type-specific involvement of the VDR and RXR in regulation of the human PTHrP gene via a negative VDRE.', 'Altered SMRT levels disrupt vitamin D3 receptor signalling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Epigenetic corruption of VDR signalling in malignancy.', 'The Role of Estrogens and Vitamin D in Cardiomyocyte Protection: A Female Perspective.', 'Vitamin D-Induced Molecular Mechanisms to Potentiate Cancer Therapy and to Reverse Drug-Resistance in Cancer Cells.', 'Vitamin D Receptor Signaling and Cancer.', 'MicroRNA biomarkers predicting risk, initiation and progression of colorectal cancer.', 'Pan-cancer analyses of the nuclear receptor superfamily.']"""

Recipients contributed sirolimus-exposed time when sirolimus claims were filled, and unexposed time when other immunosuppressant claims were filled without sirolimus. Cox regression was used to estimate associations with overall and specific cancer incidence, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers (not captured in cancer registries). We included 32,604 kidney transplants (5687 sirolimus-exposed). Overall, cancer incidence was suggestively lower during sirolimus use (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70-1.11). Prostate cancer incidence was higher during sirolimus use (HR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.15-3.02).

Results were correlated with histology of the samples.  Results:   Diffusion-weighted images and mean diffusivity maps demonstrated distinct diffusivity differences between breast tissue components. Mean diffusivity (MD) in normal tissue was 0.59 ± 0.24 μm(2) /ms for gland lobule (voxels containing epithelium and intralobular stroma) and 1.23 ± 0.34 μm(2) /ms for interlobular fibrous stroma.

Examination for surgical margins is performed post-operatively with positive margins reported to occur in 6.5-32% of cases. Rapid identification of cancerous tissue during surgery could improve surgical resection. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is an ambient ionization method which produces mass spectra dominated by lipid signals directly from prostate tissue. With the use of multivariate statistics, these mass spectra can be used to differentiate cancerous and normal tissue. The method was applied to 100 samples from 12 human patients to create a training set of MS data. The quality of the discrimination achieved was evaluated using principal component analysis - linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) and confirmed by histopathology. Cross validation (PCA-LDA) showed >95% accuracy. An even faster and more convenient method, touch spray (TS) mass spectrometry, not previously tested to differentiate diseased tissue, was also evaluated by building a similar MS data base characteristic of tumor and normal tissue. An independent set of 70 non-targeted biopsies from six patients was then used to record lipid profile data resulting in 110 data points for an evaluation dataset for TS-MS. This method gave prediction success rates measured against histopathology of 93%.

We tested the association between aspirin and nonaspirin NSAID use on prostate cancer diagnosis in REDUCE, where all men received biopsies at 2 and 4 years largely independent of PSA. REDUCE tested dutasteride for prostate cancer risk reduction in men with a PSA of 2.5 to 10.0 ng/mL and a negative prestudy biopsy.

Results:   Overall, 3,169 men (50%) were nonusers, 1,368 (21%) used aspirin, 1,176 (18%) used NSAIDs, and 677 (11%) used both.

Use of NSAIDs or NSAIDs and aspirin was not associated with total, low-grade, or high-grade prostate cancer, though all ORs were <1 (all P ≥ 0.08). Therefore, we created a dichotomous variable of aspirin and/or NSAID users versus nonusers.

Objectives:   This study was conducted to 1) describe the incidence of various cancers in both PMSP and PBSP, and 2) compare the incidence of various cancers between the two subpopulations.  Materials and methods:   Cancer cases diagnosed between 1990 and 2010 were drawn from the database of Songkhla Cancer Registry. Population denominators were estimated from the 3 population censuses surveyed by the National Statistical Office of Thailand in 1990, 2000, and 2010.  Results:   The age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) of the 5 commonest male cancers among both subpopulations were calculated. In females, a lower incidence of cancers of the cervix and breast in PMSP compared to PBSP, with odds ratios of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.45-0.64) and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.43-0.60) respectively, was observed. In males, the incidence of cancers of the lung, liver, colon-rectum, and some other cancers were significantly different between the two populations in the past, but only prostate cancer showed a lower incidence among males in PMSP in recent years. Independent of sex and year of diagnosis, the incidence of lung, liver, NHL, and colorectal cancers was lower in MPSP compared to BPSP, with odds ratios of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.62-0.88), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.60-0.91), and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56-0.78) respectively.  Conclusions:   The differences in incidence of some cancers and religion- related culture between the two subpopulations need 2 sets of cancer-control plans and goals to fit the unique population context in deep Southern Thailand. This plan can be used in the 3 southernmost provinces of Thailand where the percentage of Muslims is over 85%.""","""['Hutcha Sriplung', 'Surichai Bilheem', 'Tirada Kuntipundee', 'Sarayut Lucian Geater']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Trends in incidence of uterine cancer in Songkhla, Southern Thailand.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Cancer incidence in Thailand, 1995-1997.', 'Epidemiology of head and neck cancer in Thailand.', 'Colon and rectum cancer in Thailand: an overview.', 'Prevalence of Pathogenic Germline Mutations in 13 Hereditary Cancer-Related Genes in Breast Cancer Patients in Narathiwat Province, Thailand.', 'Value of Conventional MRI, DCE-MRI, and DWI-MRI in the Discrimination of Metastatic from Non-Metastatic Lymph Nodes in Rectal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Study.', 'Subtype Specific Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Incidence and Survival Trends: Differences between Endemic and Non-Endemic Populations.', 'Temporal Changes in Head and Neck Cancer Incidence in Thailand Suggest Changing Oropharyngeal Epidemiology in the Region.', 'Differences in prostate tumor characteristics and survival among religious groups in Songkhla, Thailand.']"""

We explored the role of cytoreductive radical prostatectomy in PCA with low volume skeletal metastases in terms of a feasibility study.  Material and methods:   A total of 23 patients with biopsy proven PCA, minimal osseous metastases (≤3 hot spots on bone scan), absence of visceral or extensive lymph node metastases and a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to <1.0 ng/ml after neoadjuvant ADT were included in the feasibility study (group A). The control group (group B) consisted of 38 men with metastatic PCA who were treated by ADT alone. Surgery-related complications, time to castration resistance, symptom-free, cancer-specific and overall survival were analyzed using descriptive statistical analyses.  Results:   The mean age was 61 years (range 42-69 years) and 64 years (47-83) in groups A and B, respectively, with similar patient characteristics in terms of initial PSA level, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage and extent of metastatic disease. The median follow-up was 34.5 months (7-75 months) and 47 months (28-96 months) in groups A and B, respectively. Median time to castration resistance was 40 months (9-65 months) and 29 months (16-59 months) in groups A and B, respectively (p=0.04). Patients in group A experienced significantly better clinical symptom-free (38.6 versus 26.5 months, p=0.032) and cancer-specific survival rates (95.6% versus 84.2%, p=0.043) whereas the overall survival was similar. In group A none of the men underwent palliative surgical procedures for locally progressing PCA compared to 29% in group B.  Conclusions:   Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy is feasible in well-selected men with metastatic PCA who responded well to neoadjuvant ADT.

Lipidomic analysis showed that this compound was in fact able to double the cellular levels of ether lipids in these cells. Furthermore, increased levels of ether lipids were also found in exosomes released by cells containing high levels of these lipids. Interestingly, as measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis, cells containing high levels of ether lipids released more exosomes than control cells, and these exosomes were similar in size to control exosomes. Moreover, silver staining and Western blot analyses showed that the protein composition of exosomes released in the presence of hexadecylglycerol was changed; the levels of some proteins were increased, and the levels of others were reduced.

Tumour molecular profiles may help identify the mechanisms of drug action and identify potential prognostic biomarkers. We performed in vivo transcriptome profiling of pre- and post-treatment prostatic biopsies from patients with advanced hormone-naive prostate cancer treated with docetaxel chemotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with an aim to identify the mechanisms of drug action and identify prognostic biomarkers.  Methods:   RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on biopsies from four patients before and ~22 weeks after docetaxel and ADT initiation. Gene fusion products and differentially-regulated genes between treatment pairs were identified using TopHat and pathway enrichment analyses undertaken. Publically available datasets were interrogated to perform survival analyses on the gene signatures identified using cBioportal.  Results:   A number of genomic rearrangements were identified including the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion and 3 novel gene fusions involving the ETS family of transcription factors in patients, both pre and post chemotherapy. In total, gene expression analyses showed differential expression of at least 2 fold in 575 genes in post-chemotherapy biopsies. Of these, pathway analyses identified a panel of 7 genes (ADAM7, FAM72B, BUB1B, CCNB1, CCNB2, TTK, CDK1), including a cell cycle-related geneset, that were differentially-regulated following treatment with docetaxel and ADT. Using cBioportal to interrogate the MSKCC-Prostate Oncogenome Project dataset we observed a statistically-significant reduction in disease-free survival of patients with tumours exhibiting alterations in gene expression of the above panel of 7 genes (p = 0.015).

In radical prostatectomies, we demonstrated that PTEN and ERG immunostaining may be helpful to resolve this differential diagnosis. Here, we tested whether these markers are diagnostically useful in the needle biopsy setting. Separate or combined immunostains were applied to biopsies containing morphologically identified intraductal carcinoma, PIN, or borderline intraductal proliferations more concerning than PIN but falling short of morphologic criteria for intraductal carcinoma. Intraductal carcinoma occurring with concurrent invasive tumor showed the highest rate of PTEN loss, with 76% (38/50) lacking PTEN and 58% (29/50) expressing ERG. Of biopsies containing isolated intraductal carcinoma, 61% (20/33) showed PTEN loss and 30% (10/33) expressed ERG. Of the borderline intraductal proliferations, 52% (11/21) showed PTEN loss and 27% (4/15) expressed ERG. Of the borderline cases with PTEN loss, 64% (7/11) had carcinoma in a subsequent needle biopsy specimen, compared with 50% (5/10) of PTEN-intact cases. In contrast, none of the PIN cases showed PTEN loss or ERG expression (0/19). On needle biopsy, PTEN loss is common in morphologically identified intraductal carcinoma yet is very rare in high-grade PIN. Borderline intraductal proliferations, especially those with PTEN loss, have a high rate of carcinoma on resampling. If confirmed in larger prospective studies, these results suggest that PTEN and ERG immunostaining may provide a useful ancillary assay to distinguish intraductal carcinoma from high-grade PIN in this setting.""","""['Carlos L Morais', 'Jeong S Han', 'Jennifer Gordetsky', 'Michael S Nagar', 'Ann E Anderson', 'Stephen Lee', 'Jessica L Hicks', 'Ming Zhou', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Rajal B Shah', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Tamara L Lotan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Cytoplasmic PTEN protein loss distinguishes intraductal carcinoma of the prostate from high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'ERG and PTEN status of isolated high-grade PIN occurring in cystoprostatectomy specimens without invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'PIN-like (Ductal) Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PIN-like carcinoma, ductal carcinoma, and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Premalignancy in Prostate Cancer: Rethinking What we Know.', 'Prostate Pathology: What is New in the 2022 WHO Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumors?', 'Single cell analysis of cribriform prostate cancer reveals cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental pathways of aggressive disease.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate as a Cause of Prostate Cancer Metastasis: A Molecular Portrait.', 'Identification of Morphologic Criteria Associated with Biochemical Recurrence in Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.']"""

ERG-positive HGPIN was strongly associated with ERG-positive PCA in the same core compared with ERG-negative HGPIN (P<0.0001).

However, despite the longstanding use of antibodies to target HER2, controversies remain concerning antibody/HER2 trafficking behavior in cancer cells. Understanding this behavior has direct relevance to the mechanism of action and effective design of such antibodies. In the current study, we analyzed the intracellular dynamics of trastuzumab, a marketed HER2-targeting antibody, in a panel of breast and prostate cancer cell lines that have a wide range of HER2 expression levels. Our results reveal distinct post-endocytic trafficking behavior of antibody-HER2 complexes in cells with different HER2 expression levels. In particular, HER2-overexpressing cells exhibit efficient HER2 recycling and limited reductions in HER2 levels upon antibody treatment, and consequently display a high level of antibody persistence on their plasma membrane. By contrast, in cells with low HER2 expression, trastuzumab treatment results in rapid antibody clearance from the plasma membrane combined with substantial decreases in HER2 levels and undetectable levels of recycling. A cell line with intermediate levels of HER2 expression exhibits both antibody recycling and clearance from the cell surface. Significantly, these analyses demonstrate that HER2 expression levels, rather than cell origin (breast or prostate), is a determinant of subcellular trafficking properties.

Such an oxide-free operation improves sensitivity and simplifies sensor design. For a quantitative and selective detection of PSA antigen, anti-PSA antibody was immobilized on the sensor surface. Then, introduction of PSA antigen, into the anti-PSA immobilized sensor surface resulted in a lable-free immunoassary format. Measured off-state current of the device showed a significant decrease as the applied PSA concentration was increased. The minimum detectable concentration of PSA is 1 pg/mL, which is several orders of magnitude below the clinical cut-off level of ~4 ng/mL. In addition, we also provide a systematic theoretical analysis of the sensor platform - including the charge state of protein at the specific pH level, and self-consistent channel transport.

Unlike other population groups, the Druze strive to keep their own traditions and marry mainly inside their own community. During the last decade, cancer morbidity among both Jews and Arabs in Israel has been increasing, while data on the Druze are little known and have not been analyzed and compared to other population groups to date. To compare cancer morbidity rates among Druze, Arabs and Jews in Israel during 1999-2009, gender-specific and age-standardized incidence rates of all site cancers and specific cancers of three population groups (Jews, Arabs and Druze) were received from the Israel National Cancer Registry for the period 1999-2009. Based on these rates, periodical incidence rates were calculated and mutually compared across the groups stratified by gender. As the analysis shows, the Druze had significantly lower cancer rates compared to both Arabs and Jews. Thus, for all site cancers, there were significantly higher cancer rates in Jewish males versus Druze males (RR = 1.39, 95 % CI = 1.16-1.65) and in Jewish females versus Druze females (RR = 1.53, 95 % CI = 1.27-1.85), but not statistically significant for Arab males versus Druze males (RR = 1.12 95 % CI = 0.93-1.35). Lung cancer rates in Arab males were also higher compared to Druze males (RR = 1.84, 95 % CI = 1.13-3.00). Jewish males had statistically significant higher rates of prostate cancer compared to Druze males (RR = 2.47, 95 % CI = 1.55-3.91). For thyroid and colon cancers, risks were not significantly different at the 95 % CI level; however, the risks were significantly different at the 90 % CI level (RR = 3.62, 90 % CI 1.20-11.02 and RR = 1.69, 90 % CI = 1.03-2.77, respectively). Jewish females had significantly higher rates of invasive breast cancer (RR = 2.25, 95 % CI = 1.55-3.25), in situ cervical cancer (RR = 4.01, 95 % CI = 1.27-12.66) and lung cancer (RR = 3.22, 95 % CI = 1.12-9.24) compared to Druze females. We thus observed lower cancer rates among Druze versus Arab and Jewish populations in Israel. A reason for these differences may be due to different nutritional habits. Druze still keep a less processed nutritional lifestyle, than is common in industrial society.

Materials and methods:   Changes in PSA, total ALP and bone ALP (≥30% increase or decrease), and changes on bone scans were assessed before and after six monthly cycles of Ra-223 therapy (50 kBq/kg body weight) in 14 patients with mCRPC with bone metastases and four patients on placebo.  Results:   Post-treatment PSA increased by at least 30% in 11 out of 14 patients and remained stable in three. Total ALP and bone ALP decreased in six and nine patients, respectively.

Conclusions:   These observations support the notion that Ra-223 kills tumour cells in metastases surrounded by highly proliferating osteoblasts, consistent with the reported survival benefit. The radiation effect in small tumour deposits not surrounded by increased osteoblast activity seems, however, insufficient, thus allowing continuous tumour growth.

Here, we investigated associations of the derived NLR (dNLR) and duration of initial androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with survival of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving first-line chemotherapy.  Patients and methods:   Data from the multinational randomized phase III studies VENICE and TAX327 included a total of 2230 men with mCRPC randomized to receive first-line chemotherapy, and were used as training and validation sets, respectively. Associations of dNLR and duration of initial ADT with overall survival (OS) were evaluated by multivariable Cox regression analysis in the training set stratified for performance status and treatment arm. The model was then tested in the validation set. Subsequently, we investigated the treatment effect of docetaxel on OS in subgroups according to dNLR and duration of initial ADT.  Results:   In the training set, both dNLR ≥median (2) and duration of initial ADT <median (15 months) were associated with increased risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.50, P < 0.001 and HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.21-1.64, P < 0.001, respectively] after adjustment for age, alkaline phosphatase, hemoglobin, and pain at baseline. In the validation set, dNLR remained an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.20-1.70, P < 0.001), whereas duration of initial ADT was not (HR 1.16; 95% CI 0.97-1.37, P = 0.10). In subgroup analyses of the TAX327 study, docetaxel improved OS irrespective of dNLR and duration of initial ADT.  Conclusion:   The dNLR was prognostic for OS in men with mCRPC receiving first-line chemotherapy in two randomized phase III trials. A high dNLR (≥2) was associated with shorter survival irrespective of the received treatment. This readily available biomarker may serve for risk stratification in future clinical trials and could be incorporated into prognostic nomograms.

Although CellSearch has been shown to consistently detect clinically relevant CTCs; the ability to only capture EpCAM positive cells has led to speculation that it captures limited subsets of CTCs. In contrast, alternative approaches to CTC isolation are often cited as capturing large numbers of CTCs from patient blood. Not surprisingly the number of cells isolated by alternative approaches show poor correlations when compared to CellSearch, even when accounting for EpCAM presence or absence. In an effort to address this discrepancy, we ran an exploratory method comparison study to characterize and compare the CTC subgroups captured from duplicate blood samples from 30 breast and prostate cancer patients using a microfiltration system (CellSieve™) and CellSearch. We then categorized the CellSieve Cytokeratin(CK)+/CD45-/DAPI+ cells into five morphologically distinct subpopulations for correlative analysis. Like other filtration techniques, CellSieve isolated greater numbers of CK+/CD45- cells than CellSearch. Furthermore, analysis showed low correlation between the total CK+/CD45- cells captured by these two assays, regardless of EpCAM presence. However, subgrouping of CK+/CD45-/DAPI+ cells based on distinct cytokeratin staining patterns and nuclear morphologies elucidated a subpopulation correlative to CellSearch. Using method comparison analyses, we identified a specific CTC morphology which is highly correlative between two distinct capture methods. These data suggests that although various morphologic CTCs with similar phenotypic expressions are present in the blood of cancer patients, the clinically relevant cells isolated by CellSearch can potentially be identified using non-EpCAM dependent isolation. © 2014 The Authors.

The present study used a cDNA microarray to demonstrate that AQP3, a member of the AQP family, was overexpressed in prostate cancer cells. In order to determine the role of AQP3 in prostate cancer, AQP3 expression was silenced by transfection with small interfering RNA, following which wound healing and invasion assays were conducted in DU‑145 and PC‑3 cells. Notably, the results showed that silencing of AQP3 suppressed prostate cancer cell motility and invasion. The possible mechanisms underlying the AQP3‑enhanced motility and invasion of prostate cancer cells was also investigated. Knockdown of AQP3 expression was shown to reduce extracellular signal‑regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation in DU‑145 and PC‑3 cells. Blocking the ERK pathway inhibited AQP3‑mediated motility and invasion of these cells. Finally, the results demonstrated that AQP3 upregulated matrix metalloproteinase‑3 (MMP‑3) expression and secretion in prostate cancer cells via activation of the ERK pathway. In conclusion, the present study suggests that AQP3 induces ERK1/2 activation, thereby increasing MMP‑3 expression and secretion, which in turn promotes prostate cancer cell motility and invasion.

The molecular etiology of this prostate cancer variant is not well understood; however, mutation of the p53 (TP53) tumor suppressor in prostate neuroendocrine cells inactivates the IL8-CXCR2-p53 pathway that normally inhibits cellular proliferation, leading to the development of SCNC. SCNC also overexpresses Aurora kinase A (AURKA) which is considered to be a viable therapeutic target. Therefore, the relationship of these two molecular events was studied, and we show that p53 mutation leads to increased expression of miR-25 and downregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7, resulting in elevated levels of Aurora kinase A. This study demonstrates an intracellular pathway by which p53 mutation leads to Aurora kinase A expression, which is critically important for the rapid proliferation and aggressive behavior of prostatic SCNC.

In prostate cancer, prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) is an androgen-induced prostate-specific lncRNA whose overexpression is highly associated with prostate tumors. PCGEM1's tumorigenic potential has been recently shown to be in part due to its ability to activate androgen receptor (AR). Here, we report a novel function of PCGEM1 that provides growth advantages for cancer cells by regulating tumor metabolism via c-Myc activation. PCGEM1 promotes glucose uptake for aerobic glycolysis, coupling with the pentose phosphate shunt to facilitate biosynthesis of nucleotide and lipid, and generates NADPH for redox homeostasis. We show that PCGEM1 regulates metabolism at a transcriptional level that affects multiple metabolic pathways, including glucose and glutamine metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide and fatty acid biosynthesis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The PCGEM1-mediated gene regulation takes place in part through AR activation, but predominantly through c-Myc activation, regardless of hormone or AR status. Significantly, PCGEM1 binds directly to target promoters, physically interacts with c-Myc, promotes chromatin recruitment of c-Myc, and enhances its transactivation activity. We also identified a c-Myc binding domain on PCGEM1 that contributes to the PCGEM1-dependent c-Myc activation and target induction. Together, our data uncover PCGEM1 as a key transcriptional regulator of central metabolic pathways in prostate cancer cells. By being a coactivator for both c-Myc and AR, PCGEM1 reprograms the androgen network and the central metabolism in a tumor-specific way, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention.""","""['Chiu-Lien Hung', 'Ling-Yu Wang', 'Yen-Ling Yu', 'Hong-Wu Chen', 'Shiv Srivastava', 'Gyorgy Petrovics', 'Hsing-Jien Kung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['The long non-coding RNA PCGEM1 is regulated by androgen receptor activity in vivo.', 'Regulation of androgen receptor splice variant AR3 by PCGEM1.', 'MEF2‑activated long non‑coding RNA PCGEM1 promotes cell proliferation in hormone‑refractory prostate cancer through downregulation of miR‑148a.', ""Long noncoding RNAs and prostate carcinogenesis: the missing 'linc'?"", 'Role of lncRNAs in prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Regulatory roles of lncRNA PANDAR in breast cancer cell proliferation.', 'Rewired Metabolism Caused by the Oncogenic Deregulation of MYC as an Attractive Therapeutic Target in Cancers.', 'c-Myc-induced long noncoding RNA MIRE cooperates with hnRNPK to stabilize ELF2 mRNA and promotes clear cell renal cell carcinogenesis.', 'N6-methyladenosine modified LINC00901 promotes pancreatic cancer progression through IGF2BP2/MYC axis.', 'The impact of RNA binding proteins and the associated long non-coding RNAs in the TCA cycle on cancer pathogenesis.']"""

Long-term follow-up has been lacking. In this study, we report the long-term outcome of a large active surveillance protocol in men with favorable-risk prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   In a prospective single-arm cohort study carried out at a single academic health sciences center, 993 men with favorable- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer were managed with an initial expectant approach. Intervention was offered for a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time of less than 3 years, Gleason score progression, or unequivocal clinical progression. Main outcome measures were overall and disease-specific survival, rate of treatment, and PSA failure rate in the treated patients.  Results:   Among the 819 survivors, the median follow-up time from the first biopsy is 6.4 years (range, 0.2 to 19.8 years). One hundred forty-nine (15%) of 993 patients died, and 844 patients are alive (censored rate, 85.0%). There were 15 deaths (1.5%) from prostate cancer. The 10- and 15-year actuarial cause-specific survival rates were 98.1% and 94.3%, respectively. An additional 13 patients (1.3%) developed metastatic disease and are alive with confirmed metastases (n = 9) or have died of other causes (n = 4). At 5, 10, and 15 years, 75.7%, 63.5%, and 55.0% of patients remained untreated and on surveillance. The cumulative hazard ratio for nonprostate-to-prostate cancer mortality was 9.2:1.

We hypothesized that throughout the early period of minimally invasive surgery, MIRP patients had inferior outcomes as compared with those who had open radical prostatectomy (ORP).  Methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End RESULTS-Medicare dataset and identified men who had ORP and MIRP for prostate cancer from 2003-2009. Study endpoints were receipt of subsequent cancer treatment, and evidence of postoperative voiding dysfunction, erectile dysfunction (ED) and bladder outlet obstruction. We used proportional hazards regression to estimate the impact of surgical approach on each endpoint, and included an interaction term to test for modification of the effect of surgical approach by year of surgery.  Results:   ORP (n=5362) and MIRP (n=1852) patients differed in their clinical and demographic characteristics. Controlling for patient characteristics and surgeon volume, there was no difference in subsequent cancer treatments (hazard ratio (HR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-1.05), although MIRP was associated with a higher risk of voiding dysfunction (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.20-1.43) and ED (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.31-1.56), but a lower risk of bladder outlet obstruction (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.97). There was no interaction between approach and year for any outcome. When stratifying the analysis by year, MIRP consistently had higher rates of ED and voiding dysfunction with no substantial improvement over time.  Conclusions:   MIRP patients had adverse urinary and sexual outcomes throughout the diffusion of minimally invasive surgery.

Open radical prostatectomy series have identified the presence of a positive surgical margin (PSM) as a predictor of long-term recurrence, a measure that is affected by the surgeon׳s skill. We evaluate the effect of PSM parameters on BCR rates from robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, across 3 high-volume institutions.  Methods:   De-identifiable clinicopathological and histopathological data were prospectively collected for 4,001 patients with at least 3 years of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier plots and 3 statistical models were used to evaluate the effect of margin parameters on BCR, via crude rates, traditional multivariable Cox regression, and a propensity-adjusted Cox regression model.  Results:   Overall, 37% of men with a PSM developed BCR compared with 10% of men with negative margins (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.47-2.22). Length ≥3 mm or a multifocal positive margin was associated with a higher risk of BCR compared with negative margin cases. On multivariable Cox regression analysis of the positive margin cohort, only apical margins significantly predicted BCR relative to basal margins (HR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.01-4.09), whereas there was no significant difference in BCR rates for posterolateral margins relative to basal margins (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 0.84-3.11). Propensity-adjusted modeling confirmed a greater effect of apical compared with posterolateral PSM.  Conclusions:   A PSM length ≥3 mm is predictive of BCR, as is to a lesser extent multiple positive margins.

Methods:   Between 2010 and 2013, 342 patients underwent MP-MRI of the prostate (3T, no endorectal coil with axial perfusion and diffusion images). The findings of the images were reported as negative, suspicious, or positive for ECE by a single expert radiologist. Radical prostatectomy specimens were reviewed to confirm the size and the location of ECE and further defined as focal or established ECE. Established ECE included extension that was multifocal or involving more than 5 glands. The accuracy of MRI in localizing focal and established ECE to each zone of the prostate was determined. Regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of ECE.  Results:   We identified 112 patients who underwent prostate MP-MRI and radical prostatectomy. MRI findings considered suspicious or definite for ECE accurately predicted pathologic ECE (P<0.001). MP-MRI identified established ECE but not focal ECE. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MP-MRI for established ECE were 70.7%, 90.6%, 57.1%, and 95.1%, respectively. MRI identified ECE to the left vs. right side as well as each zone of the prostate; however, sensitivity was lowest at the apex. On multivariate analysis, MRI was a significant predictor of ECE that was independent of prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, and clinical stage.

On the other hand, association between human papillomavirus infection and risk of bladder and prostatic cancer remains controversial.  Case presentation:   We report a rare case of a 67-year-old Japanese man with synchronous triple urogenital cancer including bladder small cell carcinoma, prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and penile squamous cell carcinoma, who presented with a history of asymptomatic gross hematuria. Bladder small cell carcinoma and prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma were diagnosed by histopathological examination after transurethral resection of the tumor. Moreover, he was diagnosed with penile carcinoma based on the exfoliative cytodiagnosis of nodular and papillary tumors inside the preputial collar. He was treated with laparoscopic radical cystectomy, urethrectomy, partial penectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection, and ileal conduit urinary diversion. To identify a common pathogenesis, we considered human papillomavirus as an etiologic factor because it is a known risk factor for penile carcinoma. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid bands were detected by polymerase chain reaction in the three tumors. There was a possibility that human papillomavirus was involved in the carcinogenesis of the triple cancer.  Conclusions:   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the synchronous triple urogenital cancer of small cell carcinoma of the bladder, ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate and penile squamous cell carcinoma.

NMR spectroscopy is an excellent technique for analysis of mixtures of organic compounds and gives a detailed chemical fingerprint of most individual components above the detection limit. For the identification of individual metabolites in metabolomics, correlation or covariance between peaks in (1)H NMR spectra has previously been successfully employed. Similar correlation of 2D (1)H-(13)C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation spectra was recently applied to investigate the structure of heparine. In this paper, we demonstrate how a similar approach can be used to identify metabolites in human biofluids (post-prostatic palpation urine).  Results:   From 50 (1)H-(13)C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation spectra, 23 correlation plots resembling pure metabolites were constructed. The identities of these metabolites were confirmed by comparing the correlation plots with reported NMR data, mostly from the Human Metabolome Database.  Conclusions:   Correlation plots prepared by statistically correlating (1)H-(13)C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation spectra from human biofluids provide unambiguous identification of metabolites.

Its incidence is rising, especially in Nigeria. Prompt diagnosis is necessary by histology. Transperineal and transrectal approaches to prostate biopsy are well-documented. Both methods are fraught with complications though, most times minor. Studies carried out to compare both methods were carried out mainly on Caucasians, generating conflicting results. This study aims to compare the complication rates and tissue yield of these two methods in Nigerian men.  Materials and methods:   Seventy-five patients completed the study. Forty-five patients had transperineal prostate biopsy (TPbx), while 30 patients had transrectal prostate biopsy. Pain perception for all patients was determined by visual analog scale; whereas the complications were ascertained by a validated purpose designed questionnaire administered on the 7 th and 30 th day post operatively.  Results:   The risk of rectal bleeding was higher for transrectal prostate biopsy compared to transperineal (Odds ratio: 0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.001-0.450; P = 0.012).

The reactive oxygen species and free radicals mediate connective tissue destruction in periodontitis. In order to counteract the free radical mediated tissue damage, numerous antioxidant mechanisms exist within the host. One such system is heme oxygenase enzymes. Heme oxygenase is the key enzyme involved in catabolism of heme. It cleaves the heme molecule to yield equimolar amounts of biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron. These end products act as important scavengers of reactive oxygen metabolites.

Materials and methods:   The growth and viability of DU-145 cells treated with anthocyanins were assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and apoptosis was assessed by DNA laddering. Immunoblotting was conducted to evaluate differences in the expressions of p53, Bax, Bcl, androgen receptor (AR), and prostate specific antigen (PSA). To study the inhibitory effects of anthocyanins on tumor growth in vivo, DU-145 tumor xenografts were established in athymic nude mice. The anthocyanin group was treated with daily oral anthocyanin (8 mg/kg) for 14 weeks. After 2 weeks of treatment, DU-145 cells (2×10⁶) were inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank to establish tumor xenografts. Tumor dimensions were measured twice a week using calipers and volumes were calculated.  Results:   Anthocyanin treatment of DU-145 cells resulted in 1) significant increase in apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, 2) significant decrease in p53 and Bcl-2 expressions (with increased Bax expression), and 3) significant decrease in PSA and AR expressions. In the xenograft model, anthocyanin treatment significantly inhibit tumor growth.

Following refinement of the education materials based on survey and forum feedback, a statewide videoconference was implemented. Following the videoconference, participants (25 men; 3 women) reported that they would encourage others to learn more about prostate cancer, talk to their doctor about whether or not to get screened for prostate cancer, and recommend the conference to others.

However, none of its high-penetrance susceptibility genes and GWAS-identified variants to date are known to be involved in hormonal pathways. Given the hypothesized etiologic role of gonadotropins, an assessment of how variability in genes involved in the gonadotropin signaling pathway impacts disease risk is warranted.  Methods:   Genetic data from 41 ovarian cancer study sites were pooled and unconditional logistic regression was used to evaluate whether any of the 2185 SNPs from 11 gonadotropin signaling pathway genes was associated with ovarian cancer risk. A burden test using the admixture likelihood (AML) method was also used to evaluate gene-level associations.  Results:   We did not find any genome-wide significant associations between individual SNPs and ovarian cancer risk. However, there was some suggestion of gene-level associations for four gonadotropin signaling pathway genes: INHBB (p=0.045, mucinous), LHCGR (p=0.046, high-grade serous), GNRH (p=0.041, high-grade serous), and FSHB (p=0.036, overall invasive). There was also suggestive evidence for INHA (p=0.060, overall invasive).  Conclusions:   Ovarian cancer studies have limited sample numbers, thus fewer genome-wide susceptibility alleles, with only modest associations, have been identified relative to breast and prostate cancers. We have evaluated the majority of ovarian cancer studies with biological samples, to our knowledge, leaving no opportunity for replication. Using both our understanding of biology and powerful gene-level tests, we have identified four putative ovarian cancer loci near INHBB, LHCGR, GNRH, and FSHB that warrant a second look if larger sample sizes and denser genotype chips become available.""","""['Alice W Lee', 'Jonathan P Tyrer', 'Jennifer A Doherty', 'Douglas A Stram', 'Jolanta Kupryjanczyk', 'Agnieszka Dansonka-Mieszkowska', 'Joanna Plisiecka-Halasa', 'Beata Spiewankiewicz', 'Emily J Myers;Australian Cancer Study (Ovarian Cancer);Australian Ovarian Cancer Study Group;Georgia Chenevix-Trench', 'Peter A Fasching', 'Matthias W Beckmann', 'Arif B Ekici', 'Alexander Hein', 'Ignace Vergote', 'Els Van Nieuwenhuysen', 'Diether Lambrechts', 'Kristine G Wicklund', 'Ursula Eilber', 'Shan Wang-Gohrke', 'Jenny Chang-Claude', 'Anja Rudolph', 'Lara Sucheston-Campbell', 'Kunle Odunsi', 'Kirsten B Moysich', 'Yurii B Shvetsov', 'Pamela J Thompson', 'Marc T Goodman', 'Lynne R Wilkens', 'Thilo Dörk', 'Peter Hillemanns', 'Matthias Dürst', 'Ingo B Runnebaum', 'Natalia Bogdanova', 'Liisa M Pelttari', 'Heli Nevanlinna', 'Arto Leminen', 'Robert P Edwards', 'Joseph L Kelley', 'Philipp Harter', 'Ira Schwaab', 'Florian Heitz', 'Andreas du Bois', 'Sandra Orsulic', 'Jenny Lester', 'Christine Walsh', 'Beth Y Karlan', 'Estrid Hogdall', 'Susanne K Kjaer', 'Allan Jensen', 'Robert A Vierkant', 'Julie M Cunningham', 'Ellen L Goode', 'Brooke L Fridley', 'Melissa C Southey', 'Graham G Giles', 'Fiona Bruinsma', 'Xifeng Wu', 'Michelle A T Hildebrandt', 'Karen Lu', 'Dong Liang', 'Maria Bisogna', 'Douglas A Levine', 'Rachel Palmieri Weber', 'Joellen M Schildkraut', 'Edwin S Iversen', 'Andrew Berchuck', 'Kathryn L Terry', 'Daniel W Cramer', 'Shelley S Tworoger', 'Elizabeth M Poole', 'Sara H Olson', 'Irene Orlow', 'Elisa V Bandera', 'Line Bjorge', 'Ingvild L Tangen', 'Helga B Salvesen', 'Camilla Krakstad', 'Leon F A G Massuger', 'Lambertus A Kiemeney', 'Katja K H Aben', 'Anne M van Altena', 'Yukie Bean', 'Tanja Pejovic', 'Melissa Kellar', 'Nhu D Le', 'Linda S Cook', 'Linda E Kelemen', 'Angela Brooks-Wilson', 'Jan Lubinski', 'Jacek Gronwald', 'Cezary Cybulski', 'Anna Jakubowska', 'Nicolas Wentzensen', 'Louise A Brinton', 'Jolanta Lissowska', 'Hannah Yang', 'Lotte Nedergaard', 'Lene Lundvall', 'Claus Hogdall', 'Honglin Song', 'Ian G Campbell', 'Diana Eccles', 'Rosalind Glasspool', 'Nadeem Siddiqui', 'Karen Carty', 'James Paul', 'Iain A McNeish', 'Weiva Sieh', 'Valerie McGuire', 'Joseph H Rothstein', 'Alice S Whittemore', 'John R McLaughlin', 'Harvey A Risch', 'Catherine M Phelan', 'Hoda Anton-Culver', 'Argyrios Ziogas', 'Usha Menon', 'Susan J Ramus', 'Aleksandra Gentry-Maharaj', 'Patricia Harrington', 'Malcolm C Pike', 'Francesmary Modugno', 'Mary Anne Rossing', 'Roberta B Ness', 'Paul D P Pharoah', 'Daniel O Stram', 'Anna H Wu', 'Celeste Leigh Pearce']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Gynecol Oncol""","""['Association between common germline genetic variation in 94 candidate genes or regions and risks of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Association between invasive ovarian cancer susceptibility and 11 best candidate SNPs from breast cancer genome-wide association study.', 'FSHB -211 G>T is a major genetic modulator of reproductive physiology and health in childbearing age women.', 'Role of common genetic variants in ovarian cancer susceptibility and outcome: progress to date from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC).', 'Network-Based Integration of GWAS and Gene Expression Identifies a HOX-Centric Network Associated with Serous Ovarian Cancer Risk.', 'Metabolic syndrome and breast cancer: a dangerous association for postmenopausal women.', 'Mechanisms of High-Grade Serous Carcinogenesis in the Fallopian Tube and Ovary: Current Hypotheses, Etiologic Factors, and Molecular Alterations.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing the relationship between statin use and risk of ovarian cancer.', 'Association of Anti-Mullerian Hormone, Follicle-Stimulating Hormone, and Inhibin B with Risk of Ovarian Cancer in the Janus Serum Bank.', 'Genome-wide Analysis of Common Copy Number Variation and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Risk.']"""

Objective:   We investigated the joint association between calcium and phosphorus and risk of prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, with a focus on lethal and high-grade disease.  Design:   In total, 47,885 men in the cohort reported diet data in 1986 and every 4 y thereafter. From 1986 to 2010, 5861 cases of prostate cancer were identified, including 789 lethal cancers (fatal or metastatic). We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between calcium and phosphorus intake and prostate cancer, with adjustment for potential confounding.  Results:   Calcium intakes >2000 mg/d were associated with greater risk of total prostate cancer and lethal and high-grade cancers. These associations were attenuated and no longer statistically significant when phosphorus intake was adjusted for. Phosphorus intake was associated with greater risk of total, lethal, and high-grade cancers, independent of calcium and intakes of red meat, white meat, dairy, and fish. In latency analysis, calcium and phosphorus had independent effects for different time periods between exposure and diagnosis. Calcium intake was associated with an increased risk of advanced-stage and high-grade disease 12-16 y after exposure, whereas high phosphorus was associated with increased risk of advanced-stage and high-grade disease 0-8 y after exposure.

However, results from previous epidemiologic studies of fiber intake and prostate cancer are inconsistent, and to our knowledge, no study has comprehensively evaluated the effects of soluble and insoluble fiber on prostate cancer in Asia.  Objective:   The objective was to examine the association between fiber intake and prostate cancer in Japanese men.  Design:   We conducted a population-based prospective study in 43,435 Japanese men aged 45-74 y. Participants responded to a validated questionnaire, which included 138 food items. Follow-up was from 1995 through 2009. HRs and 95% CIs of incidence were calculated according to quartiles of fiber intake.  Results:   During the 11.6-y follow-up, of the 825 men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, 213 had advanced-stage cancer, 582 had organ-localized disease, and 30 had an undetermined stage of disease. Among them, 217 cases were detected by subjective symptoms.

Total fiber and insoluble fiber intake were associated with a decreased risk of advanced cancers detected by subjective symptoms, with multivariate HRs (95% CIs) across increasing quartiles of 1.00, 0.58, 0.62, and 0.44 (0.21, 0.92; P-trend = 0.05) for total fiber and 1.00, 0.60, 0.52, and 0.46 (0.22, 0.93; P-trend = 0.04) for insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber intake showed no association with prostate cancer.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of physical activity after a prostate cancer diagnosis on both overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality in a large cohort.  Methods:   Data from 4,623 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer 1997-2002 and followed-up until 2012 were analyzed. HRs with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between post-diagnosis recreational MET-h/d, time spent walking/bicycling, performing household work or exercising, and time to overall and prostate cancer-specific death. All models were adjusted for potential confounders.  Results:   During the follow-up, 561 deaths of any cause and 194 deaths from prostate cancer occurred. Statistically significantly lower overall mortality rates were found among men engaged in ≥5 recreational MET-h/d (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.77), walking/bicycling ≥20 min/d (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.86), performing household work ≥1 h/d (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59-0.86), or exercising ≥1 h/wk (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.90), compared with less active men within each activity type.

The antidiabetic drug metformin has been shown to display antitumoral properties in prostate cancer cell and animal models; however, its role in the formation of metastases remains poorly documented. Here, we show that metformin reduces the formation of metastases to fewer solid organs in an orthotopic metastatic prostate cancer cell model established in nude mice. As predicted, metformin hampers cell motility in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells and triggers a radical reorganization of the cell cytoskeleton. The small GTPase Rac1 is a master regulator of cytoskeleton organization and cell migration. We report that metformin leads to a major inhibition of Rac1 GTPase activity by interfering with some of its multiple upstream signaling pathways, namely P-Rex1 (a Guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rac1), cAMP, and CXCL12/CXCR4, resulting in decreased migration of prostate cancer cells.

Metastatic growth in the bone is supported by factors secreted by PCa cells that activate signaling networks in the tumor microenvironment that augment tumor growth. To better understand these signaling networks and identify potential targets for therapy of bone metastases, we characterized the secretome of a patient-derived xenograft, MDA-PCa-118b (PCa-118b), generated from osteoblastic bone lesion. PCa-118b induces osteoblastic tumors when implanted either in mouse femurs or subcutaneously. To study signaling molecules critical to these unique tumor/microenvironment-mediated events, we performed mass spectrometry on conditioned media of isolated PCa-118b tumor cells, and identified 26 secretory proteins, such as TGF-β2, GDF15, FGF3, FGF19, CXCL1, galectins, and β2-microglobulin, which represent both novel and previously published secreted proteins. RT-PCR using human versus mouse-specific primers showed that TGFβ2, GDF15, FGF3, FGF19, and CXCL1 were secreted from PCa-118b cells. TGFβ2, GDF15, FGF3, and FGF19 function as both autocrine and paracrine factors on tumor cells and stromal cells, that is, endothelial cells and osteoblasts. In contrast, CXCL1 functions as a paracrine factor through the CXCR2 receptor expressed on endothelial cells and osteoblasts. Thus, our study reveals a complex PCa bone metastasis secretome with paracrine and autocrine signaling functions that mediate cross-talk among multiple cell types within the tumor microenvironment.""","""['Yu-Chen Lee', 'Martina Srajer Gajdosik', 'Djuro Josic', 'James G Clifton', 'Christopher Logothetis', 'Li-Yuan Yu-Lee', 'Gary E Gallick', 'Sankar N Maity', 'Sue-Hwa Lin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cell Proteomics""","""['BMP4 promotes prostate tumor growth in bone through osteogenesis.', 'A 3D in\xa0vitro model of patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft for controlled interrogation of in\xa0vivo tumor-stromal interactions.', 'Loss of TGF-β responsiveness in prostate stromal cells alters chemokine levels and facilitates the development of mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bone lesions.', 'Proteases, growth factors, chemokines, and the microenvironment in prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer cells: a hypothesis supporting the predilection of prostate cancer metastasis and growth in the bone environment.', 'Involvement in Tumorigenesis and Clinical Significance of CXCL1 in Reproductive Cancers: Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Endometrial Cancer, Ovarian Cancer and Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of the Immunomodulatory Effects of a Probiotics and Natural Extract-Based Formulation in Bacterial-Induced Prostatitis.', 'Procoxacin bidirectionally inhibits osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity in bone and suppresses bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'The Importance of CXCL1 in Physiology and Noncancerous Diseases of Bone, Bone Marrow, Muscle and the Nervous System.', 'Advancing Treatment of Bone Metastases through Novel Translational Approaches Targeting the Bone Microenvironment.']"""

Our androgen receptor (AR) conditional transgenic mice developed murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) and prostatic adenocarcinoma lesions recapitulating human prostate cancer development and progression. Role of transgenic AR contributing to malignancy was demonstrated by high degree of transgenic AR expression in atypical and tumor cells in mPIN as well as prostatic adenocarcinoma lesions of the transgenic mice, but not in adjacent normal tissue. Interestingly, reduced PI3K/Akt activation also appeared in these mouse atypical and tumor cells, suggesting an interaction between androgen and PI3K/AKT pathways. In this study, we further investigated this interaction. We showed that the androgen depletion or knockdown of AR expression results in elevated levels of active phosphorylated AKT in prostate cancer cells. Castration of conditional Pten knock-out mice showed increased Akt, phosphorylated Akt, and pS6 expression in the mouse prostate. Using a series of newly generated Ar reporter and Pten knock-out compound mice, we showed that Pten loss directly represses endogenous Ar expression in prostatic epithelial cells. Moreover, Pten loss and PI3K/Akt activation reduced Ar-mediated transcription in purified Pten-null cells.

ERβ was predominantly localized to nuclei of secretory epithelium of prostatic glands. Expression of ERβ was higher in benign glands compared to carcinoma. However, majority of carcinomas retained ERβ expression though at much lower levels. Expression of Ki 67 was higher in carcinoma than benign hyperplasia. There was no correlation between the ERβ status, Ki 67 expression & grade of tumor.

However, it remains unclear whether the pathology indicated SV extent is included into the CTV defined by current guidelines. The purpose of this study is to compare the volume of proximal SV included in CTV defined by EORTC prostate cancer radiotherapy guideline and RTOG0815 protocol with the actual anatomic volume.  Methods:   Radiotherapy planning CT images from 114 patients with intermediate- (36.8%) or high-risk (63.2%) prostate cancer were reconstructed with 1-mm-thick sections. The starting and ending points of SV and the cross sections of SV at 1-cm and 2-cm from the starting point were determined using 3D-view. Maximum (D1H, D2H) and minimum (D1L, D2L) vertical distance from these cross sections to the starting point were measured. Then, CTV of proximal SV defined by actual anatomy, EORTC guideline and RTOG0815 protocol were contoured and compared (paired t test).  Results:   Median length of D1H, D1L, D2H and D2L was 10.8 mm, 2.1 mm, 17.6 mm and 8.8 mm (95th percentile: 13.5mm, 5.0mm, 21.5mm and 13.5mm, respectively).

While for high-risk patients, the proximal 2-cm SV CTV defined by EORTC guideline inadequately included the anatomic proximal 2-cm SV in 17.5% (20/114) cases.  Conclusions:   SV involvement indicated by pathology studies was not completely included in the CTV defined by current guidelines.

While national and international guidelines recommend the extraction of 10-12 cores at initial biopsy, some authors plead to initially perform more extensive biopsy protocols. We assessed the PCA detection and complication rates of different biopsy schemes.  Materials and methods:   We relied on the data of 425 men who underwent their first prostate biopsy from April 2005 to May 2013. Exclusion criteria consisted of PSA > 20 ng/ml, prior surgery of the prostate, or intake of 5-α-reductase inhibitors. Overall 357 underwent a 10- to 12-core biopsy, while 68 patients underwent 20-core biopsy. In case of a negative biopsy in the 10-12 cohort, rebiopsy was performed within 6 months, while in the 20-core group clinical follow-up determined further course of action. Endpoints of the study were the overall PCA detection rate and the rate of severe complications, which were defined as complications requiring hospital admission. The effect of the respective biopsy scheme on the PCA detection rate was assessed using uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis. In the subanalysis, the PCA detection rates between the two groups were compared solely in patients with PSA values ≤10 ng/ml.  Results:   At initial biopsy, the overall PCA detection rate was 50.4% (214/425). In the 10-12 core group, the PCA detection rate at first biopsy was 52.4% (187/357) and rebiopsy detected a further 19 (11.2%) PCA cases, resulting in a cumulative PCA detection rate of 57.7% (206/357). In the 20-core group, the PCA detection rate was 39.7% (27/68). While the different PCA detection rates were not statistically different when the initial biopsies were compared, biopsy scheme reached independent predictor status when the cumulative PCA detection rate of the 10- to 12-core scheme was compared to the 20-core scheme (p=0.01). Comparable results were obtained only when patients with PSA ≤10 ng/ml were considered. The rate of severe complications was statistically higher in the 20-core group (6.1 vs. 2.4%; p=0.01).  Conclusion:   Our data indicate that an initial 20-core biopsy does not lead to a higher PCA detection rate compared to an initial 10- to 12-core biopsy.

In most patients, pain was the first manifestation of the disease, and the spine has been most frequently involved areas. The disease was diagnosed by isotope bone scan in the most cases. The mean survival was 31.1 months for patients with breast cancer, 12.9 months for patients with prostate cancer, 13.7 months for patients with lung cancer and the overall survival was 22.5. There was only a meaningful correlation between sex, type of cancer, radiation dose, and survival in patients. We found that age was more effective than the variable of cancer type in survival of patients with bone metastasis. The prognosis of patients with bone metastasis in our center is fair. There was a significant correlation between sex, type of cancer, radiation dose, and survival. Cox proportional hazards model showed that age was a predictor of death.""","""['Masood Shabani', 'Fariba Binesh', 'Nasim Behniafard', 'Faezeh Nasiri', 'Farimah Shamsi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Clinico-pathologic characterisation of metastatic prostate cancer in the Radiotherapy and Oncology Department, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria-Nigeria: 2006-2009.', 'Non-spine bone metastasis as an initial manifestation of cancer in Korea.', 'Patterns of metastasis and survival in breast cancer patients: a preliminary study in an Iranian population.', 'Role of radiation therapy for osseous metastasis.', 'Bone metastasis from prostate cancer.', 'Palliative local treatment of bone metastases by 125I seed brachytherapy under DynaCT guidance: single-center experience.', 'Different distant metastasis patterns based on tumor size could be found in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer patients: a large, population-based SEER study.', 'Clinical implications of transforming growth factor-beta-induced gene-h3 protein expression in lung cancer.', '125I Seed Implant Brachytherapy for Painful Bone Metastases After Failure of External Beam Radiation Therapy.']"""

Methods:   We compared the sensitivity and specificity of eCQMs created from structured data from electronic health records (EHRs) linked to administrative and cancer registry data to data abstracted from patients' electronic health records. Twenty-nine measures of care were assessed in 15,394 patients with either incident lung or prostate cancer from 2007 and 2008, respectively, and who were treated in the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA).  Results:   It was feasible to develop eCQMs for 11 of 18 (61%) lung cancer measures, 4 (22%) of which were considered to be valid measures of the care constructs. Among prostate cancer measures, 6 of 11 (55%) were feasible, and 4 (36%) were both feasible and valid.

We aimed to investigate the influence of the different surgical techniques on pathologic outcome and biochemical recurrence.  Patients and methods:   A total of 805 patients with a high risk PCa (PSA >20 ng/mL, Gleason Score ≥8, or clinical stage ≥cT2c) were included. A comparison of 407 RRP patients with 398 minimally invasive cases (LRP+RARP) revealed significant confounders. Therefore all 110 RARP cases were propensity score (PS) matched 1:1 with LRP and RRP patients. PS included age, clinical stage, preoperative PSA, biopsy Gleason score, surgeon's experience and application of a nerve sparing technique. Comparison of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was done with the log rank test. Predictors of RFS were analyzed by means of Cox regression models.  Results:   Within the post-matching cohort of 330 patients a pathologic Gleason score < 7, = 7 and > 7 was found in 1.8, 55.5 and 42.7% for RARP, in 8.2, 36.4, 55.5% for LRP and in 0, 60.9 and 39.1% for RRP (p=0.004 for RARP vs. LRP and p=0.398 for RARP vs. RRP). Differences in histopathologic stages were not statistically significant. The overall positive surgical margin rate (PSM) as well as PSM for ≥ pT3 were not different. PSM among patients with pT2 was found in 15.7, 14.0 and 20.0% for RARP, LRP and RRP (statistically not significant). The respective mean 3-year RFS rates were 41.4, 77.9, 54.1% (p<0.0001 for RARP vs. LRP and p=0.686 for RARP vs. RRP). The mean 3-year OS was calculated as 95.4, 98.1 and 100% respectively (statistically not significant).

In this study, we investigated whether a novel BCA3 splice variant exists that lacks only the exon 5-encoding sequence. BCA3 variant splices were subcloned and sequenced using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The preliminary biological functions of the splices were identified using confocal microscopy and a luciferase assay. The absence of exon 3 and exon 5 influenced the subcellular localization of BCA3 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)-dependent gene expression. Exon 3 and exon 5 of BCA3 may function together to provide a nuclear localization signal or transport sequence to enter the nucleus, and exon 3 may contain specific sequence(s) or domain(s) that influence the NF-κB signal cascade.

Relatively few genetic alterations have been identified, likely owing to disease heterogeneity. Here, we show that the transcription factor JUNB/AP-1 limits prostate cancer progression. JUNB expression is increased in low-grade prostate cancer compared with normal human prostate, but downregulated in high-grade samples and further decreased in all metastatic samples. To model the hypothesis that this downregulation is functionally significant, we genetically inactivated Junb in the prostate epithelium of mice. When combined with Pten (phosphatase and tensin homologue) loss, double-mutant mice were prone to invasive cancer development. Importantly, invasive tumours also developed when Junb and Pten were inactivated in a small cell population of the adult anterior prostate by topical Cre recombinase delivery. The resulting tumours displayed strong histological similarity with human prostate cancer. Loss of JunB expression led to increased proliferation and decreased senescence, likely owing to decreased p16(Ink4a) and p21(CIP1) in epithelial cells. Furthermore, the tumour stroma was altered with increased osteopontin and S100 calcium-binding protein A8/9 expression, which correlated with poor prognoses in patients. These data demonstrate that JUNB/AP-1 cooperates with PTEN signalling as barriers to invasive prostate cancer, whose concomitant genetic or epigenetic suppression induce malignant progression.""","""['M K Thomsen', 'L Bakiri', 'S C Hasenfuss', 'H Wu', 'M Morente', 'E F Wagner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Death Differ""","""[""JunB and PTEN in prostate cancer: 'loss is nothing else than change'."", 'Function of JunB in transient amplifying cell senescence and progression of human prostate cancer.', 'Differential p53-independent outcomes of p19(Arf) loss in oncogenesis.', 'COUP-TFII inhibits TGF-β-induced growth barrier to promote prostate tumorigenesis.', 'SMAD4-dependent barrier constrains prostate cancer growth and metastatic progression.', 'Upregulation of miR-153 promotes cell proliferation via downregulation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene in human prostate cancer.', 'Lysyl oxidase-like 4 exerts an atypical role in breast cancer progression that is dependent on the enzymatic activity that targets the cell-surface annexin A2.', 'Conserved transcription factors promote cell fate stability and restrict reprogramming potential in differentiated cells.', 'Differential regulation of TNFα and IL-6 expression contributes to immune evasion in prostate cancer.', 'In Vivo Models for Prostate Cancer Research.', 'Post-prostatic-massage urine exosomes of men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome carry prostate-cancer-typical microRNAs and activate proto-oncogenes.']"""

The purpose of this study is to assess the diagnostic performance of cDWI image sets calculated for high b-values of 1500, 2000, and 3000 s/mm(2).  Materials and methods:   Twenty-eight patients who underwent multiparametric MRI of the prostate and radical prostatectomy consecutively were enrolled in this retrospective study. Using a software developed at our institute, cDWI1500, cDWI2000, and cDWI3000 image sets were generated by fitting a monoexponential model. Index lesions on cDWI image sets were scored by two radiologists in consensus considering lesion conspicuity, suppression of background prostate tissue, distortion, image set preferability, and contrast ratio measurements were performed.  Results:   Lesion detection rates are the same for computed b-values of 2000 and 3000 s/mm(2) and are better than b-values of 1500 s/mm(2). Best lesion conspicuity and best background prostate tissue suppression are provided by cDWI3000 image set. cDWI2000 image set provides the best zonal anatomical delineation and less distortion and was chosen as the most preferred image set. Average contrast ratio measured on these image sets shows almost a linear relation with the b-values.

Survivorship care plans and other educational strategies to prepare cancer survivors to adopt engaged roles in managing long-term follow-up care and health risks are needed. In a sample of cancer survivors, we identified patient characteristics and psychosocial predictors associated with increased follow-up care informational needs. Cross-sectional surveys were administered to early-stage breast and prostate survivors (N = 278; 68 % breast) at least 2 years post treatment from four community hospital programs in New Jersey between May 2012 and July 2013. Patient demographics, medical history, psychosocial characteristics (i.e., worries about the future, fear of disease recurrence, and patient activation), and perceptions of oncology and primary care were assessed. African-American survivors (AOR = 2.69, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.27-5.68) and survivors with higher comorbidity (AOR =1.16, CI 1.01-1.33) were more likely to want additional information to guide follow-up care. Adjusting for race and comorbidities, survivors who wanted more information to guide their follow-up care reported greater worries about the future (p < 0.05) and fears about disease recurrence (p < 0.05) compared to those who did not want additional information.

These were used to predict significant BPO (defined as a Schäfer grade ≥ 3 in PFS).  Results:   A preliminary multivariate model, including IPSS, Qmax at free flow and RU, suggested that only Qmax at free flow was a statistically significant predictor of BPO (P = 0.00) with a predictive accuracy (PA) of 82%. Further development of the multivariate model showed how the inclusion of BWT did not increase PA. Only transitional zone volume (TZV) proved to be an additional statistically significant predictor for BPO (P = 0.00).

As the benefits of primary androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer are controversial, and most prostate cancer survivors are of advanced age with comorbidities, it is important to determine if primary androgen deprivation therapy increases the risk of diabetes and to determine the susceptibility factors.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 12,191 men diagnosed with incident localized prostate cancer during 1995 to 2008, age 35 to 100 years, and without diabetes or receipt of prostatectomy or radiation 1 year after diagnosis. Patients were enrolled in 1 of 3 managed health plans and followed through 2010. Primary androgen deprivation therapy was defined as androgen deprivation therapy within 1 year after diagnosis. Incident diabetes was ascertained using inpatient and outpatient diagnosis codes, diabetes medications and hemoglobin A1c values. We estimated primary androgen deprivation therapy associated diabetes risk using Cox proportional hazard models in conventional and propensity score analyses.  Results:   Diabetes developed in 1,203 (9.9%) patients during followup (median 4.8 years) with incidence rates of 2.5 and 1.6 events per 100 person-years in the primary androgen deprivation therapy and nonprimary androgen deprivation therapy groups, respectively. Primary androgen deprivation therapy was associated with a 1.61-fold increased diabetes risk (95% CI 1.38-1.88). The number needed to harm was 29. The association was stronger in men age 70 or younger than in older men (HR 2.25 vs 1.40, p value for interaction=0.008).  Conclusions:   Primary androgen deprivation therapy may increase diabetes risk by 60% and should be used with caution when managing localized prostate cancer. Because of the consistent association between androgen deprivation therapy and greater diabetes risk across disease states, we recommend routine screening and lifestyle interventions to reduce the risk of diabetes in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy.""","""['Huei-Ting Tsai', 'Nancy L Keating', 'Stephen K Van Den Eeden', 'Reina Haque', 'Andrea E Cassidy-Bushrow', 'Marianne Ulcickas Yood', 'Matthew R Smith', 'Arnold L Potosky']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Uncovering the metabolic complications of androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer--where do we take it next?', 'Influence of age on incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease in prostate cancer survivors receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Diabetes and cardiovascular disease during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Metformin Use is Associated with Improved Survival for Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer on Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: new concepts and concerns.', 'Metabolic complications of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Does Androgen Deprivation for Prostate Cancer Affect Normal Adaptation to Resistance Exercise?', 'Treatment-Emergent Co-Morbidities and Survival in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Receiving Abiraterone or Enzalutamide.', 'The Adverse Effects of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer and the Benefits and Potential Anti-oncogenic Mechanisms of Progressive Resistance Training.', 'Cardiovascular Effects of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer: Contemporary Meta-Analyses.', 'A simple screening score to predict diabetes in cancer patients: A Korean nationwide population-based cohort study.']"""

A qualitative study of patients' responses to the existential threat of cancer""","""Existential concerns about cancer have been studied extensively in palliative care but less so in curative settings. The present report aims to describe ways in which patients viewed the continuity or discontinuity of their identity in the face of the mortal threat of cancer. Twenty-eight patients with breast, prostate or lung cancer attending pre-treatment, treatment or follow-up appointments were interviewed about their emotional experiences following diagnosis. Qualitative analysis followed an inductive, constant comparative approach. Patients spoke of 'getting back to normal', but presented two distinct accounts of 'normality'. Some, particularly those only recently diagnosed, maintained continuity to past identity by upholding previous routines, emphasising resilience and minimising the impact of cancer. Others talked of a new 'normality' discontinuous with their past. Most accounts, however, evidenced elements of continuity and discontinuity, often in ostensibly contradictory ways. We suggest that holding contradictory perspectives simultaneously characterises an intermediate stage of adjustment for some patients: between reliance on continuity with the past in the aftermath of diagnosis and, later, a sense of being a new person, changed by cancer. Practitioners should appreciate that patients' wishes for 'normality' can signify very different responses to cancer, and that holding such contradictory orientations is functional, not aberrant.""","""['P Baker', 'H Beesley', 'I Fletcher', 'J Ablett', 'C Holcombe', 'P Salmon']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Care (Engl)""","""['Life, illness and death--existential reflections of a Swedish sample of patients who have undergone curative treatment for breast or prostatic cancer.', ""'You're putting thoughts into my head': a qualitative study of the readiness of patients with breast, lung or prostate cancer to address emotional needs through the first 18 months after diagnosis."", 'Survivor loneliness of women following breast cancer.', 'The salience of existential concerns across the cancer control continuum.', 'Alleviating existential distress of cancer patients: can relational ethics guide clinicians?', 'Impact of Treatment Modality on Quality of Life Among Uterine Cancer Survivors.', 'Resilience in adults with colorectal cancer: Refining a conceptual model using a descriptive qualitative approach.', 'A social-healthcare pathway to facilitate return to work of cancer survivors in Italy: The UNAMANO project.', ""Men's experiences of radiotherapy treatment for localized prostate cancer and its long-term treatment side effects: a longitudinal qualitative study."", ""La cloche de l'espoir : étude descriptive interprétative de l'expérience des patients atteints de cancer et des proches aidants à la fin du traitement.""]"""

We then correlate entropy values with other measures of complexity associated with Markov chain dynamical systems models of progression. The Markov transition matrix associated with each cancer is associated with a directed graph model where nodes are anatomical locations where a metastatic tumor could develop, and edge weightings are transition probabilities of progression from site to site. The steady-state distribution corresponds to the autopsy data distribution. Entropy correlates well with the overall complexity of the reduced directed graph structure for each cancer and with a measure of systemic interconnectedness of the graph, called graph conductance. The models suggest that grouping cancers according to their entropy values, with skin, breast, kidney, and lung cancers being prototypical high entropy cancers, stomach, uterine, pancreatic and ovarian being mid-level entropy cancers, and colorectal, cervical, bladder, and prostate cancers being prototypical low entropy cancers, provides a potentially useful framework for viewing metastatic cancer in terms of predictability, complexity, and metastatic potential.""","""['Paul K Newton', 'Jeremy Mason', 'Brian Hurt', 'Kelly Bethel', 'Lyudmila Bazhenova', 'Jorge Nieva', 'Peter Kuhn']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['A stochastic Markov chain model to describe lung cancer growth and metastasis.', 'The organization of intrinsic computation: complexity-entropy diagrams and the diversity of natural information processing.', 'New Markov-Shannon Entropy models to assess connectivity quality in complex networks: from molecular to cellular pathway, Parasite-Host, Neural, Industry, and Legal-Social networks.', 'Evolution of probability measures by cellular automata on algebraic topological Markov chains.', 'The Markov blankets of life: autonomy, active inference and the free energy principle.', 'Modeling cancer immunoediting in tumor microenvironment with system characterization through the ising-model Hamiltonian.', 'A Temperature Conditioned Markov Chain Model for Predicting the Dynamics of Mosquito Vectors of Disease.', 'Modeling the Onset of Symptoms of COVID-19.', 'Single cell correlation analysis of liquid and solid biopsies in metastatic colorectal cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells: High-Throughput Imaging of CTCs and Bioinformatic Analysis.']"""

Patients and methods:   In all, 263 consecutive patients with suspicion of prostate cancer were investigated. All patients were evaluated by 3-T multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) applying the European Society of Urogenital Radiology criteria. All patients underwent MRI/US-fusion biopsy transperineally (mean nine cores) and additionally a systematic transrectal biopsy (mean 12 cores).  Results:   In all, 195 patients underwent repeat biopsy and 68 patients underwent first biopsy. The median age was 66 years, median PSA level was 8.3 ng/mL and median prostate volume was 50 mL. Overall, the prostate cancer detection rate was 52% (137/263). MRI/US-fusion biopsy detected significantly more cancer than systematic prostate biopsy (44% [116/263] vs 35% [91/263]; P = 0.002). In repeat biopsy, the detection rate was 44% (85/195) in targeted and 32% (62/195) in systematic biopsy (P = 0.002). In first biopsy, the detection rate was 46% (31/68) in targeted and 43% (29/68) in systematic biopsy (P = 0.527). In all, 80% (110/137) of biopsy confirmed prostate cancers were clinically significant. For the upgrading of Gleason score, 44% (32/72) more clinically significant prostate cancer was detected by using additional targeted biopsy than by systematic biopsy alone. Conversely, 12% (10/94) more clinically significant cancer was found by systematic biopsy additionally to targeted biopsy.  Conclusions:   MRI/US-fusion biopsy was associated with a higher detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer while taking fewer cores, especially in patients with prior negative biopsy. Due to a high portion of additional tumours with Gleason score ≥7 detected in addition to targeted biopsy, systematic biopsy should still be performed additionally to targeted biopsy.""","""['Angelika Borkowetz', 'Ivan Platzek', 'Marieta Toma', 'Michael Laniado', 'Gustavo Baretton', 'Michael Froehner', 'Rainer Koch', 'Manfred Wirth', 'Stefan Zastrow']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Are men who are biopsied without prior prostate magnetic resonance imaging getting substandard care?', 'Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'Comparison of free-hand transperineal mpMRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsy with transperineal 12-core systematic biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a single-center prospective study in China.', 'Critical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal fusion biopsy for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Urinary Zinc Loss Identifies Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Inherited risk assessment and its clinical utility for predicting prostate cancer from diagnostic prostate biopsies.', 'Transrectal Ultrasound in Prostate Cancer: Current Utilization, Integration with mpMRI, HIFU and Other Emerging Applications.', 'Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection with various prostate sampling schemes based on different csPCa definitions.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy techniques compared to transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Materials and methods:   Periprostatic adipose (PPA) and subcutaneous adipose (SQA) tissue from prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were examined ex vivo by proton MR spectroscopy at 14.1T (n = 31). Fractions of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, total unsaturated, and saturated fatty acids, as well as T2 relaxation times were measured from the spectra. Univariate and multivariate analyses based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and support vector machines (SVM) were used to evaluate the association between differential measures of fatty acid levels in the PPA and SQA tissues and Gleason score and extracapsular extension (ECE), which are pathological measures of prostate cancer aggressiveness.  Results:   Both pathological markers for aggressive prostate cancer have separable patterns in the MRS features space. The association between ECE and PPA tissue fatty acid composition is linear (area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 1.00, [1.00, 1.00]), along the Δ(fM /fS ) measure, and is marked by elevated monounsaturated and reduced saturated fatty acids in the PPA tissue relative to SQA. In contrast, the association between Gleason score and PPA tissue fatty acid composition is nonlinear (classifier AROC and 95% CIs: 0.86, [0.71, 1.00]).

The authors prospectively assessed changes in HRQOL before and after a first cancer diagnosis among non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), African Americans (AAs), Hispanics, and Asians in a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries with and without cancer.  Methods:   Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results linked with the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey were used to identify 1778 individuals aged ≥65 years with prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer from 1998 to 2007. The Medical Outcomes Trust Short Form 36 (SF-36) instrument was used to measure HRQOL. By using propensity scores, each patient with cancer (case) was matched to 5 individuals without cancer (noncancer controls), and differences in HRQOL according to race/ethnicity were assessed. Mixed effects analysis of covariance models was used to assess differences in HRQOL, adjusting for baseline HRQOL, demographics, and self-reported comorbid conditions while controlling for each individual's managed care plan. Stratified analyses were used to assess racial/ethnic disparities between cases and noncancer controls.  Results:   Before cancer diagnosis, NHWs had better HRQOL scores than AAs and Hispanics on the Role-Physical and Role-Emotional SF-36 subscales. Cancer diagnosis/treatment negatively impacted individuals' lives regardless of race/ethnicity. However, among cases, gaps between racial/ethnic groups narrowed (compared with controls) before and after cancer diagnosis for some SF-36 HRQOL measures.  Conclusions:   Racial/ethnic HRQOL gaps exist among cancer survivors but may narrow because of exposure to the cancer care system.

Methods and materials:   Between 2003 and 2009, 683 patients with prostate cancer were treated with (125)I prostate brachytherapy without supplemental external beam radiation therapy and were followed up for a median time of 80 months.

Therefore, 2 dosimetric variables (day 1 D90 and day 30 D90) were analyzed for each patient. We investigated the dose effects on biochemical control and toxicity.  Results:   The 7-year biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS) rate for the group overall was 96.4% according to the Phoenix definition. A multivariate analysis found day 1 D90 and day 30 D90 to be the most significant factors affecting BFFS. The cutoff points for day 1 D90 and day 30 D90, calculated from ROC curves, were 163 Gy and 175 Gy, respectively. By use of univariate analysis, various dosimetric cutoff points for day 30 D90 were tested. We found that day 30 D90 cutoff points from 130 to 180 Gy appeared to be good for the entire cohort. Greater D90s were associated with an increase in late genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity ≥ grade 2, but the increase was not statistically significant.  Conclusions:   Improvements in BFFS rates were seen with increasing D90 levels. Day 30 D90 doses of 130 to 180 Gy were found to serve as cutoff levels.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS; One hundred patients from a prospective prostate MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy study were reviewed to identify all patients with clinically significant prostate adenocarcinoma (PCA) detected on MRI-targeted biopsy. Twenty-five PCA tumors were incorporated into a validated TRUS prostate biopsy simulator. Three prostate biopsy experts, each with different levels of experience in prostate MRI and MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy, performed a total of 225 simulated targeted biopsies on the MRI lesions as well as regional biopsy targets. Simulated biopsies performed using cognitive registration with 2D TRUS and 3D TRUS were compared with biopsies performed under MRI-TRUS fusion.  Results:   Two-dimensional and 3D TRUS sampled only 48% and 45% of clinically significant PCA MRI lesions, respectively, compared with 100% with MRI-TRUS fusion. Lesion sampling accuracy did not statistically significantly vary according to operator experience or tumor volume. MRI-TRUS fusion-naïve operators showed consistent errors in targeting of the apex, midgland, and anterior targets, suggesting that there is biased error in cognitive registration. The MRI-TRUS fusion expert correctly targeted the prostate apex; however, his midgland and anterior mistargeting was similar to that of the less-experienced operators.  Conclusion:   MRI-targeted TRUS-guided prostate biopsy using cognitive registration appears to be inferior to MRI-TRUS fusion, with fewer than 50% of clinically significant PCA lesions successfully sampled.

Logistic regression models were used to determine the association of BLNLR counts with prostate specific antigen (PSA) and RECIST responses. The optimal NLR cut-off was established based on the concordance index of different values.  Results:   Data from 755, 654 and 405 patients was available for OS, PSA and RECIST response analysis respectively. Median OS was 14.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.2-14.8]. Median NLR was 2.9 (IQR: 1.9-5.1). BLNLR was associated with survival (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1, P = 0.011) in multivariable analysis (MVA) independently of variables included in the Halabi nomogram, treatment arm and corticosteroid use. The optimal cut-off for a dichotomous NLR was selected at 3.0 based on its higher c-index related to survival. BLNLR ≥3.0 was associated with lower PSA response (40.1% versus 59.9%; P < 0.001) and RECIST response (7.7% versus 15.6%, P = 0.022) in MVA. Conversion from high (≥3) to low (<3) NLR was associated with improved survival (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.51-0.85; P = 0.001) and higher PSA response rates (66.4% versus 33.6%; P = 0.000). Use of corticosteroids at baseline did not modify the association between NLR and survival.  Conclusions:   NLR is a valid prognostic biomarker in CRPC and is associated with survival, PSA and RECIST responses in patients treated with second-line chemotherapy. Changes in NLR counts with treatment may indicate benefit. NLR prognostic value is independent of prior use of corticosteroids.

Methods:   We conducted a before-after study comparing 235 men treated surgically for prostate cancer who received routine follow-up care with 102 men managed in a survivorship clinic characterized by point-of-care QOL reporting and integration of QOL scores (EPIC) following radical prostatectomy. We then assessed baseline and postprostatectomy QOL at 6 and 12 months, as well as patient satisfaction, and compared outcomes between groups.  Results:   Although baseline QOL was comparable, scores were generally higher among the survivorship group at 6 months and 1 year compared with those followed with routine care. In particular, sexual function scores were significantly higher among patients managed in the survivorship clinic (52.2 vs 33.6 at 1 year, P < .01).

In this report, we utilize the peritumoral proteolytic activity of prostate cancer to activate engineered peptide constructs for the treatment and noninvasive imaging of prostate cancer. Using a modular ""propeptide"" approach, a cationic diastereomeric pore-forming peptide domain was linked to an inactivating acidic peptide domain. The inactivating acidic peptide domain was engineered to be a cleavable substrate for the secreted serine protease prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or the transmembrane metalloprotease prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). The propeptides were then evaluated in a direct comparison study. Both the PSA and PSMA activated propeptides were found to be cytotoxic to prostate cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, however, treatment of LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 xenografts with the PSMA propeptide resulted in a pronounced cytostatic effect when compared with xenografts treated with the PSA propeptide or the cationic diastereomeric peptide alone. The PSMA activated propeptide also proved to be an effective optical imaging probe in vivo when labeled with a near-infrared fluorophore.

There is however limited information regarding the spatial distribution of this dose heterogeneity. To this end, we analyzed the magnitude and location of intraprostatic dose heterogeneity in HDR prostate brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   Five consecutive prostate cancer patients treated with HDR were analyzed. Based on CT-simulation images, each prostate was divided into three sections (apex, base, and mid-gland). These were further subdivided into eight symmetrical sections to give a total of 24 sections. Dose-volume histograms were analyzed from V100-V200% for these 24 sections comparing the means of individual regions, left vs right, apex vs base vs mid-gland, lateral vs medial, and anterior vs posterior. A separate analysis on dose as a function of individual region volume was also performed.  Results:   Analyses comparing the 24 regions showed a maximum 62% difference (range, 21.9-83.9%) at V130% and 19.9% (1.9-20.8%) at V200%. Seven regions were significantly decreased and one significantly elevated from V130-V180% when compared with the mean. The means for lateral sections were 1.57-fold higher than medial sections from V110-V200% (p < 0.0001). The dose at the base was significantly higher than the rest of the gland from V120-V200 (V150, 35.6 ± 16.2% vs 20.9 ± 13.1%, p < 0.0001).

The changes in BMD positively correlated with the changes in total testosterone level (correlation 0.18 [95% CI, 0.04-0.27], p = 0.009). The decline in total testosterone level in serum was followed by the decline in BMD value in the studied areas, and vice versa.  Conclusions:   The changes in BMD positively correlated with changes in total testosterone level. The BMD decreases during the androgen suppression and increases during the pause in the treatment. This demonstrates the benefit of intermittent AST in preventing osteoporosis, pathological bone fractures and possibly, bone metastases.""","""['O A Chernichenko', 'V S Sakalo', 'P G Yakovlev', 'A V Sakalo', 'Y V Zhylchuk', 'A Zsolt']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Exp Oncol""","""['Bone mineral density in patients with prostate cancer without bone metastases treated with intermittent androgen suppression.', 'Long-term effects of intermittent androgen suppression on testosterone recovery and bone mineral density: results of a 33-month observational study.', 'The effect of combined androgen blockade on bone turnover and bone mineral densities in men treated for prostate carcinoma: longitudinal evaluation and response to intermittent cyclic etidronate therapy.', 'A Review on the Effects of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) on Bone Health Status in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'First-line treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.

Methods:   XTT cell proliferation assay was used to assess cytotoxicity; DNA fragmentation and caspase 3/7 activity were also measured.  Results:   The combination of TQ and ZA resulted in a significant synergistic cytotoxic activity and DNA fragmentation when compared to any single agent alone, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, TQ and ZA combination increased the caspase 3/7 activity in PC-3 cell line, while this activity could not be demonstrated in DU-145 cell line.

Here, we investigated whether such aberrant ligand-nuclear receptor (NR) interaction is present in prostate cancer LNCaP cells. First, we confirmed that LNCaP cells expressed large amounts of AR at negligible levels of ERα/β or progesterone receptor. Both suppression of PTHrP and activation of prostate-specific antigen genes were observed after independent administration of 17β-estradiol (E2), DHT, or R5020. Consistent with the notion that the LNCaP AR lost its ligand specificity due to a mutation (Thr-Ala877), experiments with siRNA targeting the respective NR revealed that the AR monopolized the role of the mediator of shared hormone-dependent regulation, which was invariably associated with nuclear translocation of this mutant AR. Microarray analysis of gene regulation by DHT, E2, or R5020 disclosed that more than half of the genes downstream of the AR (Thr-Ala877) overlapped in the LNCaP cells. Of particular interest, we realized that the AR (wild-type [wt]) and AR (Thr-Ala877) were equally responsible for the E2-AR interactions. Fluorescence microscopy experiments demonstrated that both EGFP-AR (wt) and EGFP-AR (Thr-Ala877) were exclusively localized within the nucleus after E2 or DHT treatment. Furthermore, reporter assays revealed that some other cancer cells exhibited aberrant E2-AR (wt) signaling similar to that in the LNCaP cells.

The importance of epigenetic mechanisms in prostate cancer carcinogenesis is increasingly evident. In this study, the focus will be on histone modifications and the primary objectives are to map H3K27me3 marks and quantify RAR beta 2, ER alpha, SRC3, RGMA, PGR, and EZH2 gene expressions in prostate cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. In addition, a data analysis was made in connection with the clinicopathological parameters.  Methods:   71 normal specimens and 66 cancer prostate tissues were randomly selected in order to assess the proportion of the repressive H3K27me3 mark and gene expression. H3K27me3 level was evaluated by ChIP-qPCR and mRNA expression using RT-qPCR between prostate cancer and normal tissues. Subsequently, western-blotting was performed for protein detection. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, and Tukey's test was used to correct for multiple comparisons (p-value threshold of 0.05). The principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant factorial analysis (DFA) were used to explore the association between H3K27me3 level and clinicopathological parameters.  Results:   The study demonstrated that H3K27me3 level was significantly enriched at the RAR beta 2, ER alpha, PGR, and RGMA promoter regions in prostate cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. After stratification by clinicopathological parameters, the H3K27me3 level was positively correlated with Gleason score, PSA levels and clinical stages for RAR beta 2, ER alpha, PGR, and RGMA. High H3K27me3 mark was significantly associated with decreased RAR beta 2, ER alpha, PGR and RGMA gene expressions in prostate cancer sample compared to the normal one. Moreover, the results showed that mRNA level of EZH2, AR and SRC3 are upregulated in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate tissues and this correlates positively with Gleason score, PSA levels and clinical stages. Obviously, these observations were confirmed by protein level using western-blot.  Conclusions:   This data clearly demonstrated that H3K27me3 level correlated with aggressive tumor features. Also this study revealed that reverse correlation of RAR beta 2, ER alpha, PGR, and RGMA expressions with EZH2, SRC3, and AR expressions in prostate cancer tissues suggests that these genes are the target of EZH2.

Further analysis on clinical prostate tissues reveals that the binding of AR to these two distinct motifs is involved in prostate carcinogenesis.

To examine the risk of 10-year cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) according to clinical and pathological characteristics of very high-risk cT3b/4 PCa patients treated with RP as the primary treatment option.  Methods:   In a multi-institutional cohort, 266 patients with very high-risk cT3b/4 PCa treated with RP were identified. All patients underwent RP and pelvic lymph-node dissection. Competing-risk analyses assessed 10-year CSM and OCM before and after stratification for age and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI).  Results:   Overall, 34 (13%) patients died from PCa and 73 (28%) from OCM. Ten-year CSM and OCM rates ranged from 5.6% to 12.9% and from 10% to 38%, respectively. OCM was the leading cause of death in all subgroups. Age and comorbidities were the main determinants of OCM. In healthy men, CSM rate did not differ among age groups (10-year CSM rate for ⩽64, 65-69 and ⩾70 years: 16.2%, 11.5% and 17.1%, respectively). Men with a CCI ⩾1 showed a very low risk of CSM irrespective of age (10-year CSM: 5.6-6.1%), whereas the 10-year OCM rates increased with age up to 38% in men ⩾70 years.  Conclusion:   Very high-risk cT3b/4 PCa represents a heterogeneous group. We revealed overall low CSM rates despite the highly unfavorable clinical disease. For healthy men, CSM was independent of age, supporting RP even for older men. Conversely, less healthy patients had the highest risk of dying from OCM while sharing very low risk of CSM, indicating that this group might not benefit from an aggressive surgical treatment. Outcome after RP as the primary treatment option in cT3b/4 PCa patients is related to age and comorbidity status.""","""['F Moltzahn', 'J Karnes', 'P Gontero', 'B Kneitz', 'B Tombal', 'P Bader', 'A Briganti', 'F Montorsi', 'H Van Poppel', 'S Joniau', 'M Spahn']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Re: Predicting Prostate Cancer-specific Outcome After Radical Prostatectomy Among Men with Very High-risk cT3b/4 PCa: A Multi-institutional Outcome Study of 266 Patients.', 'Impact of age and comorbidities on long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional competing-risks analysis.', 'Very long-term survival patterns of young patients treated with radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Cancer-Specific Mortality Among Korean Men with Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated with Radical Prostatectomy Versus Radiotherapy: A Multi-Center Study Using Propensity Scoring and Competing Risk Regression Analyses.', 'Results of surgery for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Importance of radical prostatectomy for patients older than 70 years.', 'Biochemical recurrence after chemohormonal therapy followed by robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in very-high-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Evaluation of cystoprostatectomy on patients with prostate cancer extending to bladder: a retrospective study from single center.', 'Artificial Intelligence Combined With Big Data to Predict Lymph Node Involvement in Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study.', 'Treatment Strategies for High-Risk Localized and Locally Advanced and Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Open and robotic radical prostatectomy.']"""

Patients and methods:   One thousand five hundred seventy-nine men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of AS followed by radiotherapy with an additional 8 weeks of concurrent AS (16 weeks total) or to 28 weeks of AS followed by radiotherapy with an additional 8 weeks of AS (36 weeks total). The trial sought primarily to detect a 33% reduction in the hazard of prostate cancer death in the 28-week assignment. Time-to-event end points are reported for up to 10 years of follow-up.  Results:   There were no between-group differences in baseline characteristics of 1,489 eligible patients with follow-up. For the 8- and 28-week assignments, 10-year disease-specific survival rates were 95% (95% CI, 93.3% to 97.0%) and 96% (95% CI, 94.6% to 98.0%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; P = .45), respectively, and 10-year overall survival rates were 66% (95% CI, 62.0% to 69.9%) and 67% (95% CI, 63.0% to 70.8%; HR, 0.95; P = .62), respectively. For the 8- and 28-week assignments, 10-year cumulative incidences of locoregional progression were 6% (95% CI, 4.3% to 8.0%) and 4% (95% CI, 2.5% to 5.7%; HR, 0.65; P = .07), respectively; 10-year distant metastasis cumulative incidences were 6% (95% CI, 4.0% to 7.7%) and 6% (95% CI, 4.0% to 7.6%; HR, 1.07; P = .80), respectively; and 10-year prostate-specific antigen-based recurrence cumulative incidences were 27% (95% CI, 23.1% to 29.8%) and 27% (95% CI, 23.4% to 30.3%; HR, 0.97; P = .77), respectively.  Conclusion:   Extending AS duration from 8 weeks to 28 weeks before radiotherapy did not improve outcomes. A lower than expected prostate cancer death rate reduced ability to detect a between-group difference in disease-specific survival. The schedule of 8 weeks of AS before radiotherapy plus 8 weeks of AS during radiotherapy remains a standard of care in intermediate-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Thomas M Pisansky', 'Daniel Hunt', 'Leonard G Gomella', 'Mahul B Amin', 'Alexander G Balogh', 'Daniel M Chinn', 'Michael J Seider', 'Marie Duclos', 'Seth A Rosenthal', 'Glenn S Bauman', 'Elizabeth M Gore', 'Marvin Z Rotman', 'Himanshu R Lukka', 'William U Shipley', 'James J Dignam', 'Howard M Sandler']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Personalizing the duration of androgen-deprivation therapy use in the management of intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Recommended duration of androgen suppression of localized pancreatic cancer before radiotherapy is still uncertain.', 'Re: Duration of Androgen Suppression before Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Randomized Clinical Trial 9910.', 'High-dose radiotherapy with short-term or long-term androgen deprivation in localised prostate cancer (DART01/05 GICOR): a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.', 'Sequence of hormonal therapy and radiotherapy field size in unfavourable, localised prostate cancer (NRG/RTOG 9413): long-term results of a randomised, phase 3 trial.', 'Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for prostate volume reduction, lower urinary tract symptom relief and quality of life improvement in men with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer: a randomised non-inferiority trial of degarelix versus goserelin plus bicalutamide.', 'Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Maximal androgen blockade for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Artificial Intelligence Predictive Model for Hormone Therapy Use in Prostate Cancer.', 'Tailored treatment strategies for cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Sequencing of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy of Short Duration With Radiotherapy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer (SANDSTORM): A Pooled Analysis of 12 Randomized Trials.', 'Combining androgen deprivation and radiation therapy in the treatment of localised prostate cancer: Summary of level 1 evidence and current gaps in knowledge.', 'Prostate cancer therapy personalization via multi-modal deep learning on randomized phase III clinical trials.']"""

Previous work from our institution demonstrated that published prostate bed CTV guidelines frequently do not cover the pre-operative MRI defined prostate. Inadequate target delineation may contribute to the high recurrence rates, but increasing target volumes may increase dose to organs at risk.  Methods:   We propose guidelines for delineating post-prostatectomy target volumes based upon an individual's co-registered pre-operative MRI. MRI-based CTVs and PTVs were compared to those created using the RTOG guidelines in 30 patients. Contours were analysed in terms of absolute volume, intersection volume (Jaccard Index) and the ability to meet the RADICALS and QUANTEC rectal and bladder constraints (tomotherapy IMRT plans with PTV coverage of V98% ≥98%).  Results:   CTV MRI was a mean of 18.6% larger than CTV RTOG: CTV MRI mean 138 cc (range 72.3 - 222.2 cc), CTV RTOG mean 116.3 cc (range 62.1 - 176.6 cc), (p < 0.0001). The difference in mean PTV was only 4.6%: PTV MRI mean 386.9 cc (range 254.4 - 551.2), PTV RTOG mean 370 cc (range 232.3 - 501.6) (p = 0.05). The mean Jaccard Index representing intersection volume between CTVs was 0.72 and 0.84 for PTVs. Both criteria had a similar ability to meet rectal and bladder constraints. Rectal DVH: 77% of CTV RTOG cases passed all RADICALS criteria and 37% all QUANTEC criteria; versus 73% and 40% for CTV MRI (p = 1.0 for both). Bladder DVH; 47% of CTV RTOG cases passed all RADICALS criteria and 67% all QUANTEC criteria, versus 57% and 60% for CTV MRI (p = 0.61for RADICALS, p = 0.79 for QUANTEC). CTV MRI spares more of the lower anterior bladder wall than CTV RTOG but increases coverage of the superior lateral bladder walls.  Conclusion:   CTV contours based upon the patient's co-registered pre-operative MRI in the post-prostatectomy setting may improve coverage of the individual's prostate bed without substantially increasing the PTV size or dose to bladder/ rectum compared to RTOG CTV guidelines. Further evaluation of whether the use of pre-operative MRI improves local control rates is warranted.""","""['Jennifer Croke', 'Jillian Maclean', 'Balazs Nyiri', 'Yan Li', 'Kyle Malone', 'Leonard Avruch', 'Cathleen Kayser', 'Shawn Malone']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a comparison of four consensus guidelines and dosimetric evaluation of 3D-CRT versus tomotherapy IMRT.', 'Anatomic variations due to radical prostatectomy.

The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of exposure to bisphosphonate on the incidence of endometrial cancer.  Methods:   The authors used data from the National Cancer Institute's Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, which collected data on all cancers. In year 5, all participants were asked to complete a self-administered supplemental questionnaire (SQX) that included questions regarding bone medication use. For women without a cancer diagnosis at the time of the SQX, the authors identified whether a woman reported current or former use of a nitrogenous bisphosphonate (NBP), defined as ever-use, and compared them with women never exposed to an NBP. Women with missing information were excluded as were women who reported undergoing a hysterectomy. Incidence rates and rate ratios were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Cox proportional hazard ratios were also calculated and adjusted for covariates.  Results:   A total of 29,254 women were included in the current analysis; an additional 77 cases of endometrial cancer have been diagnosed since the SQX. The incidence rate for endometrial cancer among women exposed to NBPs was 8.7 per 10,000 person-years versus 17.7 per 10,000 person-years among never-exposed women (rate ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30-0.80). The effect was similar after adjusting for all the covariates in the Cox proportional hazards analysis, with a hazard ratio of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.34-0.93).  Conclusions:   The results of the current study suggest that use of NBPs may have a protective effect on the incidence of endometrial cancer.

Objective:   To test the hypothesis that vaccine therapy in this early disease setting will be safe and have a biochemical effect that would support future studies of immunotherapy in patients with minimal disease burden.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients who had PSA progression following local therapy were treated with PROSTVAC-V (vaccinia)/TRICOM on cycle 1 followed by PROSTVAC-F (fowlpox)/TRICOM for subsequent cycles in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (step 1). Androgen ablation was added on progression (step 2).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Step 1 primary end points included progression at 6 mo and characterization of change in PSA velocity pretreatment to post-treatment. Step 2 end points included PSA response with combined vaccine and androgen ablation.  Results and limitations:   In step 1, 25 of 40 eligible patients (63%) were progression free at 6 mo after registration (90% confidence interval [CI], 48-75). The median pretreatment PSA velocity was 0.13 log(PSA)/mo, in contrast to median postregistration velocity of 0.09 log(PSA)/mo (p=0.02), which is an increase in median PSA doubling time from 5.3 mo to 7.7 mo. No grade ≥4 treatment-related toxicity was observed. In the 27 patients eligible and treated for step 2, 20 patients achieved a complete response (CR) at 7 mo (CR rate: 74%; 90% CI, 57-87). Although supportive of larger studies in the cooperative group setting, this study is limited by the small number of patients and the absence of a control group as in a phase 3 study.  Conclusions:   A viral PSA vaccine can be administered safely in the multi-institutional cooperative group setting to patients with minimal disease volume alone and combined with androgen ablation, supporting the feasibility of future phase 3 studies in this population.

However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-224 have not been fully elucidated. In the current study, apelin (APLN) was identified as a target gene of miR-224. Forced expression of miR-224 inhibited PCa cell invasion and migration by suppressing the expression of APLN. In addition, the down-regulation of miR-224 was negatively correlated with the up-regulation of APLN mRNA in PCa tissues. Moreover, miR-224 down-regulation was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage (P = .027) and metastasis (P = .001), whereas APLN up-regulation more frequently occurred in PCa tissues with advanced pathologic stage (P = .003), metastasis (P < .001), and prostate-specific antigen failure (P = .001). Furthermore, patients with PCa in the miR-224-low/APLN-high group more frequently had shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival than those in groups with other expression patterns of the 2 molecules. Taken together, our data strongly confirmed for the first time that the dysregulated miR-224/APLN axis may be associated with tumorigenesis and aggressive progression of PCa.

Therefore, the search for new drugs or alternative therapy strategies has been required. Anticancer agents have been developed from plants since the 1950s and natural products still represent an important source of new and promising bioactive molecules. This work describes the cytotoxic effects of SF5 on tumor cells of high prevalence in the world and investigated some mechanisms of its antitumor action. The antitumor screening was performed with human lung carcinoma (A549), human breast (MCF-7) and prostate (PC-3) adenocarcinoma and chronic myeloid and acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines. The acute lymphocytic leukemia Jurkat cells presented high sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of SF5 (inhibition of 85-90%), compared with either the chronic myeloid leukemia K562 or solid tumor cell lines (lung, breast and prostate). SF5 arrested the cell cycle in G1 phase, which may be related with the observed downregulation of mRNA expression of c-Myc transcription factor at 24 h and 36 h. SF5 treatment induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol, leading the Jurkat cells into apoptosis, which was evidenced by the internucleosomal fragmented DNA and increased number of annexin V-FITC positive cells. The SF5 showed high cytotoxicity for lymphocytic leukemia cells and low or none for solid tumor cells, without toxicity for peripheral mononuclear cells of healthy humans. SF5 altered gene expression, arrested the cell cycle and induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, similar to traditional antineoplastic chemotherapeutic drugs.""","""['Thiago Martino', 'Monica F Pereira', 'Carlos R M Gayer', 'Sergio R Dalmau', 'Marsen G P Coelho', 'Kátia C C Sabino']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Nat Prod Commun""","""['Terpenic subfraction of Pterodon pubescens induces apoptosis of K562 leukemic cells by modulating gene expression.', 'Terpenic fraction of Pterodon pubescens inhibits nuclear factor kappa B and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 activation and deregulates gene expression in leukemia cells.', 'Apoptotic events induced by maleimides on human acute leukemia cell lines.', 'The ruthenium complex cis-(dichloro)tetraammineruthenium(III) chloride presents selective cytotoxicity against murine B cell lymphoma (A-20), murine ascitic sarcoma 180 (S-180), human breast adenocarcinoma (SK-BR-3), and human T cell leukemia (Jurkat) tumor cell lines.', 'Ailanthone: A novel potential drug for treating human cancer.', 'Recent progress in micro and nano-encapsulation of bioactive derivatives of the Brazilian genus Pterodon.']"""

Although aberrant ATF3 expression is frequently found in human cancers, the role of ATF3 in tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ATF3 suppresses the development of prostate cancer induced by knockout of the tumor suppressor Pten in mouse prostates. Whereas the oncogenic stress elicited by Pten loss induced ATF3 expression in prostate epithelium, we found that ATF3 deficiency increased cell proliferation and promoted cell survival, leading to early onset of mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and the progression of prostate lesions to invasive adenocarcinoma. Importantly, the loss of ATF3 promoted activation of the oncogenic AKT signaling evidenced by high levels of phosphorylated AKT and S6 proteins in ATF3-null prostate lesions. In line with these in vivo results, knockdown of ATF3 expression in human prostate cancer cells by single guided RNA-mediated targeting activated AKT and increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. Our results thus link ATF3 to the AKT signaling, and suggest that ATF3 is a tumor suppressor for the major subset of prostate cancers harboring dysfunctional Pten.""","""['Z Wang', 'D Xu', 'H-F Ding', 'J Kim', 'J Zhang', 'T Hai', 'C Yan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Depletion of SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase suppresses prostate tumorigenesis via inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis.', 'Cooperation between FGF8b overexpression and PTEN deficiency in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Pten null prostate tumorigenesis and AKT activation are blocked by targeted knockout of ER chaperone GRP78/BiP in prostate epithelium.', 'PTEN, more than the AKT pathway.', 'AKT and cytosolic phospholipase A2α form a positive loop in prostate cancer cells.', 'Combating castration-resistant prostate cancer by co-targeting the epigenetic regulators EZH2 and HDAC.', 'Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing identifies a signature based on macrophage marker genes involved in prostate cancer prognosis and treatment responsiveness.', 'In Vivo Models for Prostate Cancer Research.', 'Post-prostatic-massage urine exosomes of men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome carry prostate-cancer-typical microRNAs and activate proto-oncogenes.', 'ATF3 in atherosclerosis: a controversial transcription factor.']"""

Moreover, flow time in addition to flow distance is correlated with target concentration. We also observed longer flow distances for single-base mismatches compared to the target sequence at the same concentration, indicating that our approach can be used to detect point mutations.

We describe a method for estimating complete prevalence of prostate cancer to provide a measure of the burden of prostate cancer in Australia.  Methods:   Prostate cancer data from the New South Wales (NSW) Central Cancer Registry were used with PIAMOD (Prevalence and Incidence Analysis MODel) software to estimate future prostate cancer prevalence in NSW. We first fitted parametric incidence and survival models then used the modelled incidence and survival estimates to calculate complete prevalence. The estimated and projected prevalence incorporate past observed trends and take into account different assumptions about future survival trends. These models were validated against observed prevalence from the counting method.  Results:   Based on data for 1996-2007, the number of men living with prostate cancer in NSW was estimated to rise by 59% to 73%, from 38,322 in 2007 to 60,910-66,160 in 2017. The increasing incidence rates and the ageing population were the major contributors to this estimated increase. Validation suggested that these projections were reasonable, as the estimated prevalence in 1996-2007 was in good agreement with the corresponding prevalence calculated using the direct counting method, and the incidence models were supported by the recent data on prostate-specific antigen testing.  Conclusions:   As the number of men living with prostate cancer is expected to increase dramatically in the next decade in Australia, representing a significant challenge to the health system, careful planning and development of a healthcare system able to respond to this increased demand is required. These projections are useful for addressing the challenge in meeting the cancer care needs of men with prostate cancer.""","""['Xue Qin Yu', 'Qingwei Luo', 'David P Smith', 'Mark S Clements', ""Dianne L O'Connell""]""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Phase of care prevalence for prostate cancer in New South Wales, Australia: A population-based modelling study.', 'A population-based study of breast cancer prevalence in Australia: predicting the future health care needs of women living with breast cancer.', 'Characteristics of cases with unknown stage prostate cancer in a population-based cancer registry.', 'Prostate Cancer Registries: Current Status and Future Directions.', 'Prostate Cancer in the Arab World: A View From the Inside.', 'Crude probability of death for cancer patients by spread of disease in New South Wales, Australia 1985 to 2014.', 'Factors associated with the use of diet and the use of exercise for prostate cancer by long-term survivors.', 'Yield of prostate cancer screening at a community based clinic in Saudi Arabia.', 'Can exercise delay transition to active therapy in men with low-grade prostate cancer?

The introduction of CuO brings signal amplification because of the conduction band (CB) of both CuO and ZnO are lower than that of CdS, CuO will compete the photo-induced electrons in CB of CdS with ZnO, leading to the decrease of the photocurrent intensity.

Methods:   We used distribution- and anchor-based approaches to establish the MID range for each EPIC-26 domain (urinary, sexual, bowel, and vitality/hormonal) based on a prospective multi-institutional cohort of 1201 men treated for prostate cancer between 2003 and 2006 and followed up for 3 years after treatment. For the anchor-based approach, we compared within-subject and between-subject score changes for each domain to an external ""anchor"" measure of overall cancer treatment satisfaction.  Results:   We found the bowel and vitality/hormonal domains to have the lowest MID range (a 4-6 point change should be considered clinically relevant), whereas the sexual domain had the greatest MID values (10-12). Urinary incontinence appeared to have a greater MID range (6-9) than the urinary irritation/obstruction domain (5-7).  Conclusion:   Using 2 independent approaches, we established the MIDs for each EPIC-26 domain. A definition of these MID values is essential for the researcher or clinician to understand when changes in symptom burden among prostate cancer survivors are clinically relevant.""","""['Ted A Skolarus', 'Rodney L Dunn', 'Martin G Sanda', 'Peter Chang', 'Thomas K Greenfield', 'Mark S Litwin', 'John T Wei;PROSTQA Consortium']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Measuring and predicting prostate cancer related quality of life changes using EPIC for clinical practice.', 'The German version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC): translation, validation and minimal important difference estimation.', 'Development and validation of an abbreviated version of the expanded prostate cancer index composite instrument for measuring health-related quality of life among prostate cancer survivors.', 'A systematic review of expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) quality of life after surgery or radiation treatment.', 'Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires for men who have radical surgery for prostate cancer: a conceptual review of existing instruments.', 'The association of smoking with urinary and sexual function recovery following radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Proton therapy planning and image-guidance strategies within a randomized controlled trial for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'The Longitudinal Course of Prospectively Recorded Patient-reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Surgery and Salvage Radiotherapy.', 'Responsiveness and construct validity of EPIC-26, AQoL-6D and SF-6D following treatment in prostate cancer.', 'Effects of Concentrated Long-Chain Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Supplementation on Quality of Life after Radical Prostatectomy: A Phase II Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial (RCT-EPA).']"""

This study aimed to assess the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass of B cells and explore their interactions with T follicular helper (Tfh) subsets in prostate cancer patients. The percentages of peripheral blood naïve B cells, memory B cells and mature B cells, as well as Tfh1, Tfh2 and Tfh17 cells were analyzed or sorted by FACSAria. The ratios of the different IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) were detected by ELISA, and the expression levels of CXCR3 and CCR6 were measured using RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Meanwhile a co-culture system of B and Tfh cells was to assess the effect of each Tfh subset on the antibody subclass switching of B cells in vitro. We observed higher percentages of 3 Tfh subsets and IgG4+ B cells in the patients with prostate cancer than that in the health controls and proved a positive correlation between Tfh2 and IgG4+ B cells. Then we verified that IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) effectively promoted antibody class switching of B cells, which may be mediated by inducing Tfh2 cells, yet the study was not completely dependent on Tfh cells. The results provide evidence of the B cell response to an immune suppressive environment by evaluating IgG4 antibodies, and established a relationship between IgG4+ B cells and Tfh2 cells.

Herein, deletion of the NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase Sirt1 induced histological features of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia at 7 months of age; these features were associated with increased cell proliferation and enhanced mitophagy. In human prostate cancer, lower Sirt1 expression in the luminal epithelium was associated with poor prognosis. Genetic deletion of Sirt1 increased mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) acetylation of lysine residue 68, thereby enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reducing SOD2 activity. The PARK2 gene, which has several features of a tumor suppressor, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in removal of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy. Increased ROS in Sirt1(-/-) cells enhanced the recruitment of Park2 to the mitochondria, inducing mitophagy. Sirt1 restoration inhibited PARK2 translocation and ROS production requiring the Sirt1 catalytic domain. Thus, the NAD(+)-dependent inhibition of SOD2 activity and ROS by SIRT1 provides a gatekeeper function to reduce PARK2-mediated mitophagy and aberrant cell survival.""","""['Gabriele Di Sante', 'Timothy G Pestell', 'Mathew C Casimiro', 'Sara Bisetto', 'Michael J Powell', 'Michael P Lisanti', 'Carlos Cordon-Cardo', 'Mireia Castillo-Martin', 'Dennis M Bonal', 'Valentina Debattisti', 'Ke Chen', 'Liping Wang', 'Xiaohong He', 'Michael W McBurney', 'Richard G Pestell']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['The role of SIRT1 in cancer: the saga continues.', 'The role of SIRT1 in cancer: the saga continues.', 'Modulation of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and ROS Generation by Nicotinamide in a Manner Independent of SIRT1 and Mitophagy.', 'PARK2-mediated mitophagy is involved in regulation of HBEC senescence in COPD pathogenesis.', 'Molecular Regulation Mechanisms and Interactions Between Reactive Oxygen Species and Mitophagy.', 'Sirt1 and the Mitochondria.', 'Aflatoxin-B1-Exposure-Induced Hepatic Injury Could Be Alleviated by Polydatin through Reducing Oxidative Stress, Inhibiting Inflammation and Improving Mitophagy.', 'Bone regeneration strategies based on organelle homeostasis of mesenchymal stem cells.', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction in hearing loss: Oxidative stress, autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome.', 'Elaiophylin Inhibits Tumorigenesis of Human Lung Adenocarcinoma by Inhibiting Mitophagy via Suppression of SIRT1/Nrf2 Signaling.', ""Mitophagy and reactive oxygen species interplay in Parkinson's disease.""]"""

In prostate cancer, bone metastasis is related to a poorer prognosis. A diagnosis of metastatic bone disease is important in prostate cancer patients prior to therapy. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum value is used both as a screening tool and for staging of prostate cancer.  Aim:   To evaluate whether there is a link between symptoms presented by patients, pain in particular, and the presence, number and location of bone metastases as assessed by bone scan scintigraphy in concordance with PSA values and Gleason scores.  Material:   A group of 186 patients (aged: 68.38±6.16) diagnosed with prostate cancer, from rural and suburban areas of Małopolska province, that was directed for bone scan scintigraphy to the Nuclear Medicine Dept, John Paul II Hospital in Kraków.  Methods:   Analysis of all laboratory findings (including PSA value) and a biopsy were performed. Then, bone scan scintigraphy was done with the use of methylene disphosphonate (MDP) labeled with Tc-99m.  Results:   In patients with a Gleason value≤7 and a PSA value≤20 ng/ml, the cutoff value for a negative bone scan with a confidence interval of 0.95 was established at a PSA value below 10 ng/ml (p<0.01). Correlations were established between PSA value and presence of metastases in bone scan (r=0.45, p=0.05), the number of metastases (r=0.66, p<0.01), and their presence in particular body regions.  Conclusions:   The correlation between PSA value and both presence and number of metastases confirms the usefulness of bone scan scintigraphy in prostate cancer staging.

In addition, other human cancers expressed reduced levels of TTP, suggesting that it may function as a tumor suppressor in several malignancies. To identify genes that may be associated with TTP tumor suppressor functions in human cancer, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma datasets. These analyses defined a signature of 50 genes differentially regulated between high and low TTP-expressing tumors. Notably, patients with low TTP-expressing breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma had decreased survival rates and more aggressive tumors with increased necrosis. In addition, analysis across non-TCGA tumor gene expression databases identified a broad spectrum of human cancers having similarities with the TTP-low tumor gene signature, including pancreatic, bladder, and prostate cancer. TTP has documented roles in regulating mRNAs encoding inflammatory proteins, and pathway analysis identified several inflammatory pathways that are altered in tumors with low TTP expression. Surprisingly, the TTP-low tumor gene signature includes a core component of 20 under-expressed CREB target genes, suggesting that the regulation of CREB activity may be related to the tumor suppressor function of TTP. Thus, reduced levels of TTP are a potential biomarker for human cancers with poor outcome, and targeting the CREB pathway may be a therapeutic route for treating aggressive TTP-low tumors.""","""['Mohammad Fallahi', 'Antonio L Amelio', 'John L Cleveland', 'Robert J Rounbehler']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Tristetraprolin disables prostate cancer maintenance by impairing proliferation and metabolic function.', 'Mammary differentiation induces expression of Tristetraprolin, a tumor suppressor AU-rich mRNA-binding protein.', 'Tristetraprolin mediates the anti-proliferative effects of metformin in breast cancer cells.', 'Roles of Tristetraprolin in Tumorigenesis.', 'The role of RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin in cancer and immunity.', 'AU-Rich Element RNA Binding Proteins: At the Crossroads of Post-Transcriptional Regulation and Genome Integrity.', 'B4GALNT2 Gene Promotes Proliferation, and Invasiveness and Migration Abilities of Model Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Cells by Interacting With HLA-B Protein.', 'Proteogenomic characterization of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'MSK1 promotes cell proliferation and metastasis in uveal melanoma by phosphorylating CREB.', 'The Tristetraprolin Family of RNA-Binding Proteins in Cancer: Progress and Future Prospects.']"""

We determined intra- and inter-assay imprecision as well as dilution linearity using quality controls and serum pools. Furthermore, the stability of the 24 biomarkers examined in this panel was ascertained by testing the influence of different storage temperatures and time span before centrifugation.  Results:   For all markers measured in the synthetic internal quality controls, the intra-assay imprecision ranged between 2.26% and 9.41%, while for 20 of 24 measured markers in the physiological serum pools, it ranged between 1.68% and 12.87%. The inter-assay imprecision ranged between 1.48%-17.12% for 23 biomarkers in synthetic, and between 4.59%-23.88% for 18 biomarkers in physiological quality controls. Here, single markers with very low concentration levels had increased imprecision rates. Dilution linearity was acceptable (70%-130% recovery) for 20 biomarkers. Regarding pre-analytical influencing factors, most markers were stable if blood centrifugation was delayed or if serum was stored for up to 24 h at 4 °C and 25 °C after centrifugation. Comparable results were obtained in serum and plasma for most markers. However, great changes were observed for single markers.

One of the highest PCa-related mortality rates in the world is observed in Latvia.  Materials and methods:   Our study included male patients diagnosed with PCa between 1990 and 2012. We analyzed incidence, prevalence and mortality trends using joinpoint analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year overall survival and cancer-specific survival rates.  Results:   A total of 14,083PCa patients with a mean age of initial PCa diagnosis being 70.1 (SD 8.6) was registered. The standardized incidence rates (per 100,000) increased from 18.9 in 1990 to 74.7 in 2012, while the standardized prevalence rates (per 100,000) increased from 69.9 in 1990 to 437.6 in 2012.

The uptake of new treatments over time (diffusion) has not been well studied. We analyzed the diffusion of docetaxel in metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   We identified metastatic prostate cancer patients diagnosed from 1995 to 2007 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER)-Medicare database. Medicare claims through 2008 were analyzed. We assessed cumulative incidence of docetaxel by socioeconomic, demographic, and comorbidity variables, and compared diffusion patterns to landmark events including release of phase III results and FDA approval dates. We compared docetaxel diffusion patterns in prostate cancer to those in metastatic breast, lung, ovarian, and gastric cancers. To model docetaxel use over time, we used the classic ""mixed influence"" deterministic diffusion model. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   We identified 6561 metastatic prostate cancer patients; 1350 subsequently received chemotherapy. Among patients who received chemotherapy, docetaxel use was 95% by 2008. Docetaxel uptake was statistically significantly slower (P < .01) for patients older than 65 years, blacks, patients in lower income areas, and those who experienced poverty. Eighty percent of docetaxel diffusion occurred prior to the May, 2004 release of phase III results showing superiority of docetaxel over standard-of-care. The maximum increase in the rate of use of docetaxel occurred nearly simultaneously for prostate cancer as for all other cancers combined (in 2000).  Conclusion:   Efforts to increase the diffusion of treatments with proven survival benefits among disadvantaged populations could lead to cancer population survival gains. Docetaxel diffusion mostly preceded phase III evidence for its efficacy in castration-resistant prostate cancer, and appeared to be a cancer-wide-rather than a disease-specific-phenomenon.

However, despite its recognition as a stand-alone molecular target, development of suitable strategies to block its function is hindered because of its nonenzymatic nature. We reported earlier that arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-Lox) plays an important role in the survival and growth of prostate cancer cells, although details of the underlying mechanisms have yet to be characterized. By whole genome gene expression array, we observed that inhibition of 5-Lox severely down-regulates the expression of c-Myc oncogene in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, inhibition of 5-Lox dramatically decreases the protein level, nuclear accumulation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activities of c-Myc. Both the 5-Lox inhibition-induced down-regulation of c-Myc and induction of apoptosis are mitigated when the cells are treated with 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid, a metabolite of 5-Lox, confirming a role of 5-Lox in these processes. c-Myc is a transforming oncogene widely expressed in prostate cancer cells and maintains their transformed phenotype. Interestingly, MK591, a specific 5-Lox inhibitor, strongly affects the viability of Myc-overactivated prostate cancer cells and completely blocks their invasive and soft agar colony-forming abilities, but it spares nontransformed cells where expression of 5-Lox is undetectable. These findings indicate that the oncogenic function of c-Myc in prostate cancer cells is regulated by 5-Lox activity, revealing a novel mechanism of 5-Lox action and suggesting that the oncogenic function of c-Myc can be suppressed by suitable inhibitors of 5-Lox.""","""['Sivalokanathan Sarveswaran', 'Debrup Chakraborty', 'Dhananjay Chitale', 'Rosalie Sears', 'Jagadananda Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Pharmacological and genetic targeting of 5-lipoxygenase interrupts c-Myc oncogenic signaling and kills enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells via apoptosis.', 'Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase triggers apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via down-regulation of protein kinase C-epsilon.', 'Wedelolactone, an Anti-inflammatory Botanical, Interrupts c-Myc Oncogenic Signaling and Synergizes with Enzalutamide to Induce Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

The Women's Health Initiative overturned a half-century of harmful practice in hormone therapy, the National Lung Screening Trial identified the first successful lung cancer screening tool and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial overturned decades-long assumptions. While some trials identify unforeseen safety issues or harms, many fail to demonstrate efficacy. Large trials require substantial resources; to ensure reliable outcomes, we must seek ways to improve the predictive information used as the basis of trials.  Results:   Here we demonstrate a modeling framework for linking knowledge of underlying biological mechanism to evaluate the expectation of trial outcomes. Key features include the ability to propagate uncertainty in biological mechanism to uncertainty in trial outcome and mechanisms for identifying knowledge gaps most responsible for unexpected outcomes. The framework was used to model the effect of selenium supplementation for prostate cancer prevention and parallels the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial that showed no efficacy despite suggestive data from secondary endpoints in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer trial and found increased incidence of high-grade prostate cancer in certain subgroups.  Conclusion:   Using machine learning methods, we identified the parameters of the model that are most predictive of trial outcome and found that the top four are directly related to the rates of reactions producing methylselenol and transporting extracellular selenium into the cell as selenide.

A community jury allows presentation of complex information and may clarify how participants view screening after being well-informed. We examined whether participating in a community jury had an effect on men's knowledge about and their intention to participate in PSA screening.  Design:   Random allocation to either a 2-day community jury or a control group, with preassessment, postassessment and 3-month follow-up assessment.  Setting:   Participants from the Gold Coast (Australia) recruited via radio, newspaper and community meetings.  Participants:   Twenty-six men aged 50-70 years with no previous diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Intervention:   The control group (n=14) received factsheets on PSA screening. Community jury participants (n=12) received the same factsheets and further information about screening for prostate cancer. In addition, three experts presented information on PSA screening: a neutral scientific advisor provided background information, one expert emphasised the potential benefits of screening and another expert emphasised the potential harms. Participants discussed information, asked questions to the experts and deliberated on personal and policy decisions.  Main outcome and measures:   Our primary outcome was change in individual intention to have a PSA screening test. We also assessed knowledge about screening for prostate cancer.  Results:   Analyses were conducted using intention-to-treat. Immediately after the jury, the community jury group had less intention-to-screen for prostate cancer than men in the control group (effect size=-0.6 SD, p=0.05). This was sustained at 3-month follow-up. Community jury men also correctly identified PSA test accuracy and considered themselves more informed (effect size=1.2 SD, p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Evidence-informed deliberation of the harms and benefits of PSA screening effects men's individual choice to be screened for prostate cancer.

Online tracking data from perineal ultrasound is used to validate or reject this model against alternatives. Intra-fraction motion of a prostate was recorded by 4D ultrasound (Elekta Clarity system) during 84 fractions of external beam radiotherapy of six patients. In total, the center of the prostate was tracked for 8 h in intervals of 4 s. Maximum likelihood model parameters were fitted to the data. The null hypothesis of a random walk was tested with the Dickey-Fuller test. The null hypothesis of stationarity was tested by the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test. The increase of variance in prostate position over time and the variability in motility between fractions were analyzed. Intra-fraction motion of the prostate was best described as a stochastic process with an auto-correlation coefficient of ρ = 0.92 ± 0.13. The random walk hypothesis (ρ = 1) could not be rejected (p = 0.27). The static noise hypothesis (ρ = 0) was rejected (p < 0.001). The Dickey-Fuller test rejected the null hypothesis ρ = 1 in 25% to 32% of cases. On average, the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test rejected the null hypothesis ρ = 0 with a probability of 93% to 96%. The variance in prostate position increased linearly over time (r(2) = 0.9 ± 0.1). Variance kept increasing and did not settle at a maximum as would be expected from a stationary process. There was substantial variability in motility between fractions and patients with maximum aberrations from isocenter ranging from 0.5 mm to over 10 mm in one patient alone. In conclusion, evidence strongly suggests that intra-fraction motion of the prostate is a random walk and neither static (like inter-fraction setup errors) nor stationary (like a cyclic motion such as breathing, for example). The prostate tends to drift away from the isocenter during a fraction, and this variance increases with time, such that shorter fractions are beneficial to the problem of intra-fraction motion. As a consequence, fixed safety margins (which would over-compensate at the beginning and under-compensate at the end of a fraction) cannot optimally account for intra-fraction motion. Instead, online tracking and position correction on-the-fly should be considered as the preferred approach to counter intra-fraction motion.""","""['H Ballhausen', 'M Li', 'N-S Hegemann', 'U Ganswindt', 'C Belka']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Shorter treatment times reduce the impact of intra-fractional motion : A\xa0real-time 4DUS study comparing VMAT vs. step-and-shoot IMRT for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'Application of dose compensation in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Intra-fraction motion of the prostate is not increased by patient couch shifts.', 'Seminal vesicle inter- and intra-fraction motion during radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A review.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'Assessment of delivered dose in prostate cancer patients treated with ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy on 1.5-Tesla MR-Linac.', 'The ProMotion LMU dataset (2022 edition), prostate intra-fraction motion recorded by transperineal ultrasound.', 'Intrafraction Prostate Motion Management During Dose-Escalated Linac-Based Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', 'Urethra Sparing With Target Motion Mitigation in Dose-Escalated Extreme Hypofractionated Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy: 7-Year Results From a Phase II Study.']"""

Extending the dwell time optimisation model with a dwell time modulation restriction (DTMR) that limits dwell time differences between neighboring dwell positions has been suggested to eliminate this problem. DTMRs may additionally reduce the sensitivity for uncertainties in dwell positions that inevitably result from catheter reconstruction errors and afterloader source positioning inaccuracies. This study quantifies the reduction of high-dose subvolumes and the robustness against these uncertainties by applying a DTMR to template-based prostate HDR brachytherapy implants. Three different DTMRs were consecutively applied to a linear dose-based penalty model (LD) and a dose-volume based model (LDV), both obtained from literature. The models were solved with DTMR levels ranging from no restriction to uniform dwell times within catheters in discrete steps. Uncertainties were simulated on clinical cases using in-house developed software, and dose-volume metrics were calculated in each simulation. For the assessment of high-dose subvolumes, the dose homogeneity index (DHI) and the contiguous dose volume histogram were analysed. Robustness was measured by the improvement of the lowest D90% of the planning target volume (PTV) observed in the simulations. For (LD), a DTMR yields an increase in DHI of approximately 30% and reduces the size of the largest high-dose volume by 2-5 cc. However, this comes at a cost of a reduction in D90% of the PTV of 10%, which often implies that it drops below the desired minimum of 100%. For (LDV), none of the DTMRs were able to improve high-dose volume measures.

This study aimed to make overall evaluation of the association between these two anesthetic techniques and prognosis of cancer patients undergoing surgery.  Methods:   Related databases such as PubMed and EMbase were searched for eligible studies that evaluated the influence of EGA and GA on the prognosis of cancer patients undergoing surgery. Selected studies were evaluated according to the inclusion criteria by two reviewers respectively, followed by data extraction and quality assessment. The odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the influence strength of EGA and GA on prognosis of cancer patients.  Results:   A total of ten studies involving 3254 patients were included. The overall results demonstrated that there was no significant difference between EGA and GA group (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06, P = 0.187) concerning postoperative recurrence and metastasis rate. In regard to the following two factors: cancer category and time of follow-up, subgroup analysis identified significant differences between EGA and GA in the group of patients with prostate cancer and the group with follow-up less than or equal to two years (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.95, P = 0.027; OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98, P = 0.035; respectively) concerning postoperative recurrence and metastasis rate. However, no significant difference was found in the group of patients with colorectal cancer (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.84-1.33, P = 0.62).  Conclusions:   This meta-analysis showed that EGA might be associated with improvement in prognosis of patients with operable prostate cancer and the cancer patients with follow-up less than or equal to two years. However, no obvious relationship between the improvement in prognosis of colorectal cancer and EGA were detected, comparing to GA.

A connexin (Cx) traverses the membrane four times and has one intracellular and two extracellular loops with the amino and carboxyl termini facing the cytoplasm. The transmembrane and the extracellular loop domains are highly conserved among different Cxs, whereas the carboxyl termini, often called the cytoplasmic tails, are highly divergent. We have explored the role of the cytoplasmic tail of Cx32, a Cx expressed in polarized and differentiated cells, in regulating gap junction assembly. Our results demonstrate that compared with the full-length Cx32, the cytoplasmic tail-deleted Cx32 is assembled into small gap junctions in human pancreatic and prostatic cancer cells. Our results further document that the expression of the full-length Cx32 in cells, which express the tail-deleted Cx32, increases the size of gap junctions, whereas the expression of the tail-deleted Cx32 in cells, which express the full-length Cx32, has the opposite effect. Moreover, we show that the tail is required for the clustering of cell-cell channels and that in cells expressing the tail-deleted Cx32, the expression of cell surface-targeted cytoplasmic tail alone is sufficient to enhance the size of gap junctions. Our live-cell imaging data further demonstrate that gap junctions formed of the tail-deleted Cx32 are highly mobile compared with those formed of full-length Cx32. Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of Cx32 is not required to initiate the assembly of gap junctions but for their subsequent growth and stability. Our findings suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of Cx32 may be involved in regulating the permeability of gap junctions by regulating their size.""","""['Parul Katoch', 'Shalini Mitra', 'Anuttoma Ray', 'Linda Kelsey', 'Brett J Roberts', 'James K Wahl rd', 'Keith R Johnson', 'Parmender P Mehta']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Dileucine-like motifs in the C-terminal tail of connexin32 control its endocytosis and assembly into gap junctions.', 'Suppression of human prostate cancer cell growth by forced expression of connexin genes.', 'Cx29 and Cx32, two connexins expressed by myelinating glia, do not interact and are functionally distinct.', 'Emerging issues of connexin channels: biophysics fills the gap.', 'Connexin domains relevant to the chemical gating of gap junction channels.', 'Remote-refocusing light-sheet fluorescence microscopy enables 3D imaging of electromechanical coupling of hiPSC-derived and adult cardiomyocytes in co-culture.', 'Calmodulin-Mediated Regulation of Gap Junction Channels.', ""What's the Function of Connexin 32 in the Peripheral Nervous System?"", 'Dileucine-like motifs in the C-terminal tail of connexin32 control its endocytosis and assembly into gap junctions.', 'PBX1 attributes as a determinant of connexin 32 downregulation in Helicobacter pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis.']"""

A rare subset of prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) demonstrates aberrant diffuse p63 expression but is negative for high-molecular-weight cytokeratin. Strong p63 staining of the tumor cells can obscure the loss of high-molecular-weight cytokeratin when using a cocktail of basal cell markers and create a diagnostic pitfall. The p63 protein has 6 major isoforms; of these, TAp63 and ΔNp63 (p40) are the best characterized N-terminal variants. In an attempt to aid in the diagnosis of p63-positive PCas, we studied ΔNp63 expression in tumors with aberrant p63. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 31 cores of aberrant p63-positive PCas from 24 patients and on a tissue microarray containing 125 cores of conventional PCas from 40 radical prostatectomy cases using a ΔNp63-specific polyclonal (p40) antibody and a TAp63-specific monoclonal antibody (p63, clone 4A4) that recognizes both TAp63 and ΔNp63. Most of the aberrant p63-positive tumors showed diffuse positivity for p40 (29/31 cores, 93.5%; 23/24 cases, 96%). All 40 conventional PCa (125 cores) were negative for p40 and p63 in the tumor cells. In summary, p40 is expressed in most p63-positive PCas but negative in p63-negative conventional PCas. From a diagnostic perspective, the use of immunohistochemistry for ΔNp63/p40 provides only a small advantage over the more widely used p63 assays.

The expression of this kinase was investigated in prostate cancer clinical specimens. Interestingly, auto-antibodies against SIK2 were increased in the plasma of patients with aggressive disease. Examination of SIK2 in prostate cancer cells found that it functions both as a positive regulator of cell-cycle progression and a negative regulator of CREB1 activity. Knockdown of SIK2 inhibited cell growth, delayed cell-cycle progression, induced cell death, and enhanced CREB1 activity. Expression of a kinase-dead mutant of SIK2 also inhibited cell growth, induced cell death, and enhanced CREB1 activity. Treatment with a small-molecule SIK2 inhibitor (ARN-3236), currently in preclinical development, also led to enhanced CREB1 activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Because CREB1 is a transcription factor and proto-oncogene, it was posited that the effects of SIK2 on cell proliferation and viability might be mediated by changes in gene expression. To test this, gene expression array profiling was performed and while SIK2 knockdown or overexpression of the kinase-dead mutant affected established CREB1 target genes; the overlap with transcripts regulated by forskolin (FSK), the adenylate cyclase/CREB1 pathway activator, was incomplete.  Implications:   This study demonstrates that targeting SIK2 genetically or therapeutically will have pleiotropic effects on cell-cycle progression and transcription factor activation, which should be accounted for when characterizing SIK2 inhibitors.""","""['Hélène Bon', 'Karan Wadhwa', 'Alexander Schreiner', 'Michelle Osborne', 'Thomas Carroll', 'Antonio Ramos-Montoya', 'Helen Ross-Adams', 'Matthieu Visser', 'Ralf Hoffmann', 'Ahmed Ashour Ahmed', 'David E Neal#', 'Ian G Mills#']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['A Novel Compound ARN-3236 Inhibits Salt-Inducible Kinase 2 and Sensitizes Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines and Xenografts to Paclitaxel.', 'SIK2 promotes reprogramming of glucose metabolism through PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α pathway and Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in ovarian cancer.', 'Integrative analysis identifies targetable CREB1/FoxA1 transcriptional co-regulation as a predictor of prostate cancer recurrence.', 'Salt-Inducible Kinase 2: An Oncogenic Signal Transmitter and Potential Target for Cancer Therapy.', 'SIK2: A critical glucolipid metabolic reprogramming regulator and potential target in ovarian cancer.', 'Regulation of Molecular Targets in Osteosarcoma Treatment.', 'Molecular dynamics simulations of the conformational plasticity in the active pocket of salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) multi-state binding with bosutinib.', 'Curcumin-induced antitumor effects on triple-negative breast cancer patient-derived xenograft tumor mice through inhibiting salt-induced kinase-3 protein.', 'The Small-Molecule Inhibitor MRIA9 Reveals Novel Insights into the Cell Cycle Roles of SIK2 in Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'SIKs suppress tumor function and regulate drug resistance in breast cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Records of patients aged 65 years and older with metastatic PCa who received ADT were abstracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database between 1991 and 2009. The primary end points comprised 5-year CV mortality rates. Survival rates were stratified according to age and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Competing-risks Poisson regression methodologies were performed.  Results:   Overall, 9596 patients with metastatic PCa treated with ADT were identified. At baseline, 3049 patients (31.8%) had preexisting CV disease. The 5-year CV mortality rates were 9.8% and 14.8% in the overall population and in patients with preexisting CV disease, respectively. The 5-year CV mortality rates increased with advanced age and higher CCI score. In multivariate competing-risks regression analyses, age, year of diagnosis, CV comorbidities, CCI, and marital status represented independent predictors of CV mortality, after accounting for the risk of dying from other causes (all P ≤ .04). Of those, preexisting CV disease contributed to the highest risk of CV mortality. Our study is limited by its retrospective nature.

Thus, their well-being and quality of life are of great importance. This study investigated patient experiences and psychological well-being in a Finnish national sample of prostate cancer patients who received various types of treatment.  Method:   In a national sample (50%) of prostate cancer patients diagnosed in Finland in 2004, information was collected on the patients' experiences at diagnosis and choice of treatment (e.g. treatment selection, patient satisfaction with care and information, psychological reactions). In 2009, participants were asked about their experiences, and psychological well-being (psychological symptoms, satisfaction with life) was measured. In total, 1239 completed questionnaires (73%) were accepted for the study. Differences between treatments and predictors of psychological well-being were investigated using descriptive statistics and regression analysis.  Results:   Half of the respondents were satisfied with the care and information they received about the cancer and side effects of treatment. Experiences and psychological well-being were most positive among patients who received brachytherapy and poorest among patients who received hormonal therapy. Patients who underwent prostatectomy or brachytherapy were most likely to have been involved in treatment selection. Negative experiences, such as learning of the diagnosis in an impersonal way and dissatisfaction with the information and care received, were predictive of poorer well-being.  Conclusions:   Unmet supportive care and informational needs were common. Experiences and well-being varied between treatments. Patients tended to prefer prostatectomy and brachytherapy. Unmet needs, which would probably be reduced by improvements in care, appear to have a long-lasting impact on patients' psychological well-being.""","""['Ulla-Sisko Lehto', 'Sanni Helander', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Arpo Aromaa']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur J Oncol Nurs""","""[""Patients' satisfaction with different modalities of prostate cancer therapy--a retrospective survey among 634 patients."", ""Patients' perceptions of the negative effects following different prostate cancer treatments and the impact on psychological well-being: a nationwide survey."", 'Regret in men treated for localized prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Psychological recovery and well-being of spouses of patients with prostate cancer 5 years after primary treatment in Finland: a follow-up survey.', 'Does Cancer Type Influence the Impact of Recurrence?

Methods:   We enumerated observed active cancers by cancer site for Olmsted County, MN residents with incident VTE over the 13-year period, 1988-2000 (n = 345 of 1417). We used 1988-2000 Iowa State Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data to estimate the expected age-specific prevalence of cancer by cancer site for all VTE cases; standardized Morbidity Ratios (SMR) for each cancer site were estimated by dividing the observed number of cancers in the VTE incident cohort by the expected number. Relative risk regression was used to model the observed number of cancers of each site, adjusting for the expected value based on SEER prevalence data, using generalized linear regression with a Poisson error and the natural log of the age- and sex-group expected count as an offset.  Results:   For men and women with VTE, all cancer sites had an increased SMR, ranging from 4.1 for head neck cancer to 47.3 for brain cancer. Among women, the SMR for breast, ovarian and other gynecologic cancers were 8.4, 13.0 and 8.4, respectively; for men, prostate cancer SMR was 7.9. Adjusting for age and sex, the relative risk (RR) of cancer in VTE cases was associated with cancer site in a multivariable model (p < 0.001).

In this study, we found that translation of mRNA of MT1-MMP, an oncogene related to tumor metastasis, was well inhibited by miR-520c and miR-373 in several types of human cancer cells. Our experimental data demonstrated that these two microRNAs inhibited the translation of mRNA of MT1-MMP and down-regulated its proteolytic enzyme activities via targeting 3'UTR of mRNA of MT1-MMP, further decreased activating proMMP2 into active MMP2 in fibrosarcoma HT1080, benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial cell BPH-1 and glioblastoma U87GM. More interestingly, from the effects of microRNAs on cell functions, we found that cell growth were all blocked on fibronectin and type IV collagen coated plates and also in three-dimension type I collagen lattice but enhanced only in HT1080 cells on type IV collagen coated plates and in three-dimension type I collagen lattice; cell migration results showed the same effect as that of cell growth.

Methods:   In this exploratory, open label, phase II trial 113 men diagnosed with prostate cancer were randomized to consume six cups daily of brewed GT, BT or water (control) prior to radical prostatectomy (RP). The primary endpoint was prostate tumor markers of cancer development and progression determined by tissue immunostaining of proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bax, Tunel), inflammation (nuclear and cytoplasmic nuclear factor kappa B [NFκB]) and oxidation (8-hydroxydeoxy-guanosine [8OHdG]). Secondary endpoints of urinary oxidation, tea polyphenol uptake in prostate tissue, and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) were evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography and ELISA analysis.  Results:   Ninety three patients completed the intervention. There was no significant difference in markers of proliferation, apoptosis and oxidation in RP tissue comparing GT and BT to water control. Nuclear staining of NFκB was significantly decreased in RP tissue of men consuming GT (P = 0.013) but not BT (P = 0.931) compared to water control.

Elevated DEK expression was found to be an independent clinical risk factor, associated with shorter disease-free survival of hormonal naïve prostate cancer patients. DEK silencing in PC-3 cells led to a marked reduction in cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion.

In the current study, we focused on the clinicopathological significance of ETV4 in Chinese PCa patients and the mechanisms whereby ETV4 overexpression mediates tumor invasion in the prostate. Overall, ETV4 overexpression was identified in 30.4 % (45/148) of PCa cases by immunohistochemistry. Accordingly, ETV4 was rearranged in only 1.6 % (2/128) of PCa patients. Clinically, ETV4 overexpression was significantly correlated with Gleason score (P = 0.045) and pathological tumor stage (P = 0.041). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that ETV4 is an unfavorable independent prognostic factor (P = 0.040). Functional studies further showed that small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of ETV4 significantly decreases proliferation and invasion of PC-3 cell and partially reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro. Notably, ETV4 knockdown significantly downregulated expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR) at messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that ETV4 regulates uPA expression through direct binding to its promoter region. Additionally, ETV4 knockdown was also observed to significantly inhibit expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. In conclusion, for the first time, our study suggested that ETV4 is an independent poor prognostic factor in Chinese PCa patients. Silencing of ETV4 suppresses invasion of PCa cells by inhibiting the expression of uPA/uPAR as well as MMPs. Further studies will be needed to determine whether ETV4 could be regarded as a potential target for the management and prevention of PCa.""","""['Mei Qi', 'Zhiyan Liu', 'Chengwu Shen', 'Lin Wang', 'Jiping Zeng', 'Chunni Wang', 'Congcong Li', 'Weiwei Fu', 'Yi Sun', 'Bo Han']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Specific and redundant activities of ETV1 and ETV4 in prostate cancer aggressiveness revealed by co-overexpression cellular contexts.', 'Expression of urokinase plasminogen activator and its receptor in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients.', 'Association of ets-related transcriptional factor E1AF expression with tumour progression and overexpression of MMP-1 and matrilysin in human colorectal cancer.', 'Therapeutic potential of siRNA-mediated targeting of urokinase plasminogen activator, its receptor, and matrix metalloproteinases.', 'ETV1, 4 and 5: an oncogenic subfamily of ETS transcription factors.', 'Oncogenic role and drug sensitivity of ETV4 in human tumors: a pan-cancer analysis.', 'Dissecting novel mechanisms of hepatitis B virus related hepatocellular carcinoma using meta-analysis of public data.', 'A Radiosensitivity Prediction Model Developed Based on Weighted Correlation Network Analysis of Hypoxia Genes for Lower-Grade Glioma.', 'E26 transformation-specific variant 4 as a tumor promotor in human cancers through specific molecular mechanisms.', 'ETV4 plays a role on the primary events during the adenoma-adenocarcinoma progression in colorectal cancer.']"""

Methods:   A total of 141 patients who had been clinically diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and underwent LDR-brachytherapy were enrolled. Patients were randomized and allocated to two groups (silodosin 8 mg vs. naftopidil 75 mg). The primary endpoint was a change in the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) at 3 months after seed implantation. Secondary endpoints included the recovery rate of IPSS at 12 months after seed implantation, the change in IPSS and overactive bladder symptom score, uroflowmetric parameters, and frequency volume chart (FVC). To determine independent variables that can predict IPSS recovery, logistic regression analysis was carried out.  Results:   The mean change in the IPSS at 3 months after seed implantation in both groups was ⊿10.6 (naftopidil) and ⊿10.4 (silodosin), respectively. There was not a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.728). An increase in urinary frequency and a decrease in total urinated volume and mean voided volume were observed in FVC for 12 months after seed implantation. Multivariate analysis revealed that the urethral dose (UD30) was an independent predictive parameter of IPSS recovery. Patients with UD30 < 200Gy showed a higher recovery rate of IPSS at 12 months after seed implantation.  Conclusion:   There was no significant difference of serial change in IPSS between silodosin and naftopidil during the first year after seed implantation.

In solid cancer entities, one of the major contributors to chemoresistance is the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) protein. Believed to be involved in the induction of MDR1 expression is the presence of anticancer drugs as well as the Y box binding protein 1 (YB-1).  Methods:   Basal as well as drug-induced expression of MDR1 in established PC cell lines was assessed by Western blotting and mass spectrometry. Subsequently, the influence of YB-1 on MDR1 expression was examined via transient overexpression of YB-1.  Results:   While LNCaP and PC-3 cells showed no detectable amounts of MDR1, the resistance factor was found to be expressed in 22Rv1 cells. Despite this difference, all three cell lines demonstrated similar growth behavior in the presence of the first-line chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel. Incubation of 22Rv1 cells with docetaxel, cabazitaxel, and abiraterone did not significantly alter MDR1 expression levels. Furthermore, overexpression of the MDR1 controlling factor YB-1 showed no impact on MDR1 expression levels.  Conclusions:   MDR1 was detectable in the PC cell line 22Rv1. However, this study suggests that MDR1 is of less importance for drug resistance in PC cells than in other types of solid cancer. Furthermore, in contrast to YB-1 properties in other malignancies, MDR1 regulation through YB-1 seems to be unlikely.""","""['Madeleine Saupe', 'Lisa Rauschenberger', 'Melanie Preuß', 'Stefan Oswald', 'Sebastian Fussek', 'Uwe Zimmermann', 'Reinhard Walther', 'Cornelius Knabbe', 'Martin Burchardt', 'Matthias B Stope']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Interaction between docetaxel resistance and castration resistance in prostate cancer: implications of Twist1, YB-1, and androgen receptor.', 'Connection of intracellular protein YB-1 localization in cell cultures of human tumors with multidrug resistance.', 'Serum exosomal P-glycoprotein is a potential marker to diagnose docetaxel resistance and select a taxoid for patients with prostate cancer.', 'The basic and clinical implications of ABC transporters, Y-box-binding protein-1 (YB-1) and angiogenesis-related factors in human malignancies.', 'Multidrug resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Emerging Proteins in CRPC: Functional Roles and Clinical Implications.', 'A comprehensive review of the functions of YB-1 in cancer stemness, metastasis and drug resistance.', 'Mechanisms of Taxane Resistance.', 'Impact of nuclear YAP1 expression in residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy with docetaxel for high-risk localized prostate cancer.', 'miR-425-5p suppresses tumorigenesis and DDP resistance in human-prostate cancer by targeting GSK3β and inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.']"""

The RA activity is mediated primarily by members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) subfamily, namely RARα, RARβ and RARγ, which belong to the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of transcription factors. RARs form heterodimers with members of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) subfamily and act as ligand-regulated transcription factors through binding specific RA response elements (RAREs) located in target genes promoters. RARs also have non-genomic effects and activate kinase signaling pathways, which fine-tune the transcription of the RA target genes. The disruption of RA signaling pathways is thought to underlie the etiology of a number of hematological and non-hematological malignancies, including leukemias, skin cancer, head/neck cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, glioblastoma and neuroblastoma. Of note, RA and its derivatives (retinoids) are employed as potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agents because of their differentiation, anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-oxidant effects. In humans, retinoids reverse premalignant epithelial lesions, induce the differentiation of myeloid normal and leukemic cells, and prevent lung, liver, and breast cancer. Here, we provide an overview of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that regulate the RA and retinoid signaling pathways. Moreover, mechanisms through which deregulation of RA signaling pathways ultimately impact on cancer are examined. Finally, the therapeutic effects of retinoids are reported.""","""['Alessandra di Masi', 'Loris Leboffe', 'Elisabetta De Marinis', 'Francesca Pagano', 'Laura Cicconi', 'Cécile Rochette-Egly', 'Francesco Lo-Coco', 'Paolo Ascenzi', 'Clara Nervi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Aspects Med""","""['Critical role of both retinoid nuclear receptors and retinoid-X-receptors in mediating growth inhibition of ovarian cancer cells by all-trans retinoic acid.', 'Conformationally defined 6-s-trans-retinoic acid analogs. 3.

This study sought to summarise the evidence regarding these relationships using a dose-response meta-analysis approach.  Methods:   In January 2014, we performed electronic searches of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies examining the effect of folate on the incidence of prostate cancer. Only prospective studies that reported effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the incidence of prostate cancer for more than 2 categories of folate were included.  Results:   Overall, we included 10 prospective studies reporting data on 202,517 individuals. High dietary folate intake had little or no effect on prostate cancer risk (risk ratio [RR] = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.95-1.09; P = 0.598). The dose-response meta-analysis suggested that a 100 μg per day increase in dietary folate intake has no significant effect on the risk of prostate cancer (RR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.99-1.02; P = 0.433). However, high serum folate levels were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (RR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.05-1.39; P = 0.008). The dose-response meta-analysis indicated that a 5 nmol/L increment of serum folate levels was also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (RR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.00-1.07; P = 0.042).

Methods and materials:   One hundred patients with transperineal (n = 39) or transrectal (n = 61) placement of 3 gold fiducial markers underwent computed tomography scans on day 0 (after placement) and day 7 (at radiation planning). Each marker was marked as a point of interest in a treatment planning system. An automated point-based algorithm was then used to coregister the day 0 and day 7 images by matching the markers through rigid translations and rotations. The mean distance between fiducial pairs (d¯) was recorded to assess the degree of seed migration. Prostate contours were delineated, and the day 0 prostate volumes were uniformly expanded by 1, 3, and 5 mm. The percentage of the day 7 prostate volume covered by each day 0 prostate with expansion was calculated to assess whether prostate contours, if performed on day 0, would adequately cover the prostate on day 7.  Results:   The average d¯ for all patients was 0.78 ± 0.45 mm; only 1 patient had d¯ > 2 mm. Placement technique, hormonal therapy, prostate size, and marker distance from the capsule were not associated with d¯ (P > .05). The mean percentages of day 7 prostate volumes covered by the day 0 prostate plus 1, 3, and 5 mm were 98.3%, 99.8%, and 100%, respectively. With an expansion of 3 mm, 98% of men had >95% of day 0 volume covered; with an expansion of 5 mm, 100% of men had 100% of the day 0 volume covered.  Conclusions:   There is minimal change in the relative positions of fiducial markers (average d¯ < 1.0 mm) 1 week after placement. A 1- to 3-mm expansion would account for the variation in seed position for the vast majority of cases.

Individual-level covariates included demographics, primary insurance payer, and comorbidity following the Elixhauser Index. Socioeconomic variables were extracted from Census 2000 data and merged to the individual level data. Provider-to-case ratio at county level was alsocomputed. Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess associations between these factors and late-stage diagnosis of prostate cancer. Higher odds of late-stage diagnosis was significantly related to presence of comorbidities, being unmarried, current smoker, uninsured, and diagnosed in not-for-profit hospitals. The study reported that the presence of certain comorbidities, specifically 10 out of the 45, was associated with late-stage prostate cancer diagnosis. Eight out of 10 significant comorbid conditions were associated with greater risk of being diagnosed at late-stage prostate cancer. On the other hand, men who had chronic pulmonary disease, and solid tumor without metastasis, were less likely to be diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer. Late-stage diagnosis was associated with comorbidity, which is often associated with increased health care utilization.

They also had high ratings for the extent to which the cancer experience had raised awareness of their cancer risk and made them consider undergoing screening tests for cancer; ratings were lower for making changes in their health behaviors.  Conclusions:   Family members expressed strong intentions to engage in health-promoting behaviors related to physical activity and nutrition at the post-treatment transition.  Implications for nursing:   Oncology nurses are in a key position to engage family members and patients in behavior change. Nurses should assess family members at the completion of treatment for distress and provide interventions to influence the trajectory of distress in survivorship.""","""['Susan R Mazanec', 'Susan A Flocke', 'Barbara J Daly']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Nurs Forum""","""['The Teachable Moment After Cancer Diagnosis: Perceptions From Oncology Nurses.', 'Health-promotion behaviors and psychological distress in cancer survivors.', 'Are cancer survivors following the national comprehensive cancer network health behavior guidelines?

Design:   Descriptive, qualitative.  Setting:   A tertiary exercise oncology center in Perth, Australia.  Sample:   12 men with prostate cancer participating in a structured, clinic-based group exercise program supervised by accredited exercise physiologists.  Methodologic approach:   Participants completed a demographic and health history questionnaire and a semistructured interview. Thematic content analysis was performed.  Findings:   Participants described physiological and psychological health benefits, which reduced treatment-related side effects and positively affected self-efficacy, and identified exercise physiologists as providing information about the importance of exercise, as well as practical, emotional, and social support. Peer support encouraged discussion of shared experiences and a sense of social connection.  Conclusions:   Results from the current study expand on existing quantitative data to provide evidence of psychosocial benefits among men with prostate cancer involved with supervised exercise programs. The data provide insight into the components of exercise programs that can form a framework for the development of effective supportive care programs.  Interpretation:   Involvement in a structured, clinic-based group exercise program provides men with prostate cancer with considerable benefits. Supervision by qualified exercise physiologists and incorporation of a group approach are critical components of maximizing those benefits.""","""['Prue Cormie', 'Brooke Turner', 'Elizabeth Kaczmarek', 'Deirdre Drake', 'Suzanne K Chambers']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Nurs Forum""","""['""Kicked out into the real world"": prostate cancer patients\' experiences with transitioning from hospital-based supervised exercise to unsupervised exercise in the community.', 'Exercise preferences among men with prostate cancer receiving androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'The lived experience of men diagnosed with prostate cancer.', ""Healthcare providers' perspectives of the supportive care needs of men with advanced prostate cancer."", 'Methodological exemplar of integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence - supportive care for men with prostate cancer: what are the most important components?', 'Perceived facilitators and barriers by esophageal cancer survivors participating in a post-treatment exercise program.', 'The impact of hegemonic masculine ideals on self-esteem in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to ADT-naïve patients.', 'Social support and physical activity for cancer survivors: a qualitative review and meta-study.', 'Process Evaluation of a Nutrition and Lifestyle Behavior Peer Support Program for Adults with Metabolic Syndrome.', 'Effects of exercise interventions on social and cognitive functioning of men with prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.']"""

Patients and methods:   The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify patients treated to osseous metastases from breast, prostate, and lung cancer. Utilization of single-fraction versus multiple-fraction radiation therapy was compared according to demographic, disease-related, and health care system details.  Results:   We included 24,992 patients treated during the period 2005-2011 for bone metastases. Among patients treated to non-spinal/vertebral sites (n=9011), 4.7% received 8 Gy in 1 fraction, whereas 95.3% received multiple-fraction treatment. Over time the proportion of patients receiving a single fraction of 8 Gy increased (from 3.4% in 2005 to 7.5% in 2011). Numerous independent predictors of single-fraction treatment were identified, including older age, farther travel distance for treatment, academic treatment facility, and non-private health insurance (P<.05).  Conclusions:   Single-fraction palliative radiation therapy regimens are significantly underutilized in current practice in the United States. Further efforts are needed to address this issue, such that evidence-based and cost-conscious care becomes more commonplace.""","""['Charles E Rutter', 'James B Yu', 'Lynn D Wilson', 'Henry S Park']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['International patterns of practice in palliative radiotherapy for painful bone metastases: evidence-based practice?', 'Factors affecting the use of single-fraction radiotherapy for the palliation of bone metastases in Australia.', 'Palliation of bone metastases: a survey of patterns of practice among Canadian radiation oncologists.', 'Radiation for bone metastases.', 'Palliative radiotherapy in Canada.', 'Bone metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma: facts and hopes from clinical and translational perspectives.', 'Palliative Radiation for Cancer Pain Management.', 'An Intensive Educational Intervention Significantly Improves the Adoption of Single Fractionation Radiotherapy in Uncomplicated Bone Metastases.', 'Adoption of single fraction radiotherapy for uncomplicated bone metastases in a tertiary centre.', 'Replacing 30\xa0Gy in 10 fractions with stereotactic body radiation therapy for bone metastases: A large multi-site single institution experience 2016-2018.']"""

We have studied the potential anti-turmeric effect of ibuprofen in adenocarcinoma gastric cell line (AGS). The effects of ibuprofen were investigated on cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and expression of stemness marker genes using real-time RT-PCR, DNA laddering, and tube formation assays via ECM gel and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Annexin-V-FLUOS and propidium iodide (PI) were used to stain the apoptotic cells. Our findings indicate that ibuprofen at the concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 μM is able to reduce the cancerous characteristics of the AGS cells by inducing apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and angiogenesis. Real-time RT-PCR showed that ibuprofen altered the expression of several genes including Akt, P53, PCNA, Bax, and Bcl2 in the AGS cells. In addition, reduction in CD44 and OCT3/4 transcript levels revealed that ibuprofen reduces the stemness of the AGS cells and therefore it could be used as a potential anti-tumor drug.""","""['Hassan Akrami', 'Saman Aminzadeh', 'Hossein Fallahi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Ibuprofen reduces cell proliferation through inhibiting Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway in gastric cancer stem cells.', 'Zerumbone inhibits tumor angiogenesis via NF-κB in gastric cancer.', 'Astragalus saponins modulate cell invasiveness and angiogenesis in human gastric adenocarcinoma cells.', 'KRC-408, a novel c-Met inhibitor, suppresses cell proliferation and angiogenesis of gastric cancer.', 'Arsenic sulfide, the main component of realgar, a traditional Chinese medicine, induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Vascular and pulmonary effects of ibuprofen on neonatal lung development.', 'Perspectives of the Application of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs in Cancer Therapy: Attempts to Overcome Their Unfavorable Side Effects.', 'Ibuprofen and diclofenac\xa0differentially affect cell viability, apoptosis and morphology changes of human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines.', 'Decreased plasma levels of PDGF-BB, VEGF-A, and HIF-2α in preterm infants after ibuprofen treatment.', 'Effects of Non-Opioid Analgesics on the Cell Membrane of Skin and Gastrointestinal Cancers.']"""
