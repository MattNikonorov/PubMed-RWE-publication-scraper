Materials and methods:   Ethics board approval was received for this retrospective study of 87 men who underwent 1.5-Tesla conventional prostate MRI with a combination of endorectal and body phased-array coils for suspected prostate cancer before their first systematic 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy. Three radiologists independently analyzed the images, dividing the prostate into 12 regions corresponding to the biopsy scheme and scoring each region for the presence of prostate cancer on a 5-point scale. Results were analyzed by prostate region. ROC analysis was done and descriptive statistics were calculated. The negative predictive value, specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive value were calculated using dichotomized scores (benign tissue = scores of 1 and 2; malignant tissues = scores of 3, 4, and 5).  Results:   Biopsy revealed cancer in 47/87 patients (26 low-grade [Gleason score 6]; 21 high-grade [Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4]), and 184/1044 cores (77 low-grade and 107 high-grade) with a median of 3 positive cores per cancer patient (range 1 – 12). The areas under ROC curves were 0.65 – 0.67 for cancer detection by region overall and 0.75 – 0.76 for the detection of high-grade cancer by region. Statistic figures for the detection of all cancers/high-grade cancers by region were as follows: negative predictive value, 87.4 – 88.2 %/92.6 – 93.1 %; specificity, 72.3 – 79.4 %/71.5 – 79.8 %; sensitivity, 49.5 – 54.8 %/62.6 – 69.2 %; and positive predictive value, 29.3 – 34.0 %/29.4 – 34.7 %.  Conclusion:   In patients with suspected prostate cancer, negative MRI findings indicate the absence of high-grade prostate cancer on subsequent TRUS-guided 12-core biopsy with high probability. However, agreement between conventional 1.5-T endorectal prostate MRI and systematic 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy for the detection of prostate cancer appears to be moderate.""","""['T Franiel', 'H A Vargas', 'Y Mazaheri', 'S Böhmer', 'H Hricak', 'O Akin', 'D Beyersdorff']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Rofo""","""['Role of endorectal prostate MRI in patients with initial suspicion of prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of histological findings obtained combining US/mp-MRI fusion-guided biopsies with systematic US biopsies: mp-MRI role in prostate cancer detection and false negative.', 'Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of prostate voxels identified as suspicious of malignancy on three-dimensional (1)H MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with abnormal digital rectal examination or raised prostate specific antigen level of 4-10 ng/ml.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate carcinoma.']"""

However, no consensus exists regarding the normalization of circulating microRNAs in the quantification, making the results incomparable. We investigated global circulating microRNA profiles to identify a stable endogenous control for quantifying circulating microRNAs using three cohorts (n = 544), including 168 control individuals (healthy subjects and those with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis) and 376 cancer patients (hepatocellular, colorectal, lung, esophageal, gastric, renal, prostate, and breast cancer patients). GeNorm, NormFinder, and coefficient of variability (CV) were used to select the most stable endogenous control, whereas Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was adopted to explore its signaling pathways. Seven candidates (miR-1225-3p, miR-1228, miR-30d, miR-939, miR-940, miR-188-5p, and miR-134) from microarray analysis and four commonly used controls (miR-16, miR-223, let-7a, and RNU6B) from literature were subjected to real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction validation using independent cohorts. MiR-1228 (CV = 5.4%) with minimum M value and S value presented as the most stable endogenous control across eight cancer types and three controls. IPA showed miR-1228 to be involved extensively in metabolism-related signal pathways and organ morphology, implying that miR-1228 functions as a housekeeping gene. Functional network analysis found that ""hematological system development"" was on the list of the top networks that associate with miR-1228, implying that miR-1228 plays an important role in the hematological system.

Methods:   From July 2000 to July 2013, 242 men 71 years old (median) underwent RCP; preoperatively, all patients underwent digital rectal examination (DRE), total and free/total PSA. The bladder was totally examined; moreover, the prostate gland was step-sectioned at 4-mm intervals. The incidence of iPCa that fulfilled criteria for clinically significant iPCa was recorded: tumor volume ≥0.5 mL, Gleason grade ≥4, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node metastasis or positive surgical margins. In the presence of iPCa, the patients underwent PSA evaluation during the follow-up and recurrence was defined as two subsequent rises >0.2 ng/mL.  Results:   Among the 50 (20.6%) out of 242 patients submitted to RCP, an iPCa was found and 18 (36%) of them met criteria for insignificant iPCa; moreover, 30% of the patients had apex involvement. Median total PSA and PSA F/T values were not significantly different in the presence versus the absence of iPCa (2.6 vs 2.7 ng/mL and 26 vs 27%; p > 0.05) and between significant versus insignificant iPCa (p > 0.05). None of the patients during the follow-up (median 58 months; range 6-102 months) had PSA recurrence.  Conclusions:   PSA and PSA F/T values are provided for poor accuracy in distinguishing preoperatively significant from insignificant iPCa; however, the life expectancy of the patients is dramatically influenced by bladder cancer pTN (in our series, none developed PSA failure). In younger men in whom a prostate-sparing cystectomy could be proposed, an accurate preoperative evaluation should be mandatory to rule out significant iPCa at the risk of apex involvement (in our series equal to 30% of the cases).""","""['Pietro Pepe', 'Filippo Fraggetta', 'Antonio Galia', 'Paolo Panella', 'Michele Pennisi', 'Maurizio Colecchia', 'Francesco Aragona']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Incidence, predictive factors and survival outcomes of incidental prostate cancer in patients who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.', 'Incidental prostate cancer in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy.', 'Incidental prostate cancer at radical cystoprostatectomy: implications for apex-sparing surgery.', 'Incidental prostate cancer in radical cystoprostatectomy specimens.', 'Do we use the right criteria for determining the clinical significance of incidental prostate cancer at radical cystoprostatectomy?', 'Evaluation of the residual prostate cancer rate on cystoprostatectomy specimen in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Concomitant bladder cancer and prostate cancer: challenges and controversies.', 'Nanoparticles as Theranostic Vehicles in Experimental and Clinical Applications-Focus on Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Concomitant Gleason Score ≥ 7 prostate cancer is an independent prognosticator for poor survival in nonmetastatic bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy.']"""

Identifying difficult behaviors can help tailor training programs. In the context of developing a physician-IDM program for PCS, we aimed to describe physicians' use of nine key IDM behaviors for the PCS discussion and to examine the relation between the behaviors and physician characteristics. A cross-sectional sample of The American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network completed surveys about their behavior regarding PCS (N = 246; response rate = 58%). The surveys included nine physician key IDM behaviors for PCS and a single-item question describing their general practice style for PCS. The most common IDM behavior was to invite men to ask questions. The two least common reported behaviors concerned patients uncertain about screening (i.e., arrange follow-up and provide additional information for undecided men). Physicians reported difficulty with these two behaviors regardless whether they reported to discuss or not to discuss PCS with patients. Reported use of key IDM behaviors was associated with a general practice style for PCS and being affiliated with a residency-training program. Physician training programs for IDM should include physician skills to address the needs of patients uncertain about screening. Future research should determine if actual behavior is associated with self-reported behavior for the PCS discussion.""","""['Suzanne K Linder', 'Michael A Kallen', 'Patricia Dolan Mullen', 'James M Galliher', 'Paul R Swank', 'Evelyn C Y Chan', 'Robert J Volk']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Are physicians discussing prostate cancer screening with their patients and why or why not?

We demonstrate that astrocytes interact in vitro with prostatic cancers cells derived from different metastatic sites. Astrocytes and their secreted extracellular matrix, stimulate DU145 cell (a brain-derived prostate tumor cell line) proliferation while inhibiting cell death and modulating the expression of several genes related to prostate cancer progression, suggesting the activation of EMT process in these cells. In contrast, DU145 cells and their conditioned medium inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death of astrocytes. On the other hand, the astrocytes were unable to significantly induce an increment of LNCaP cell (a lymph node-derived prostate tumor cell line) proliferative activity. In addition, LNCaP cells were also unable to induce cell death of astrocytes.

In order to discover novel genomic fusion events, we applied whole-genome paired-end sequencing to identify structural alterations present in a primary PCa patient (G089) and in a PCa cell line (PC346C). Overall, we identified over 3800 genomic rearrangements in each of the two samples as compared with the reference genome. Correcting these structural variations for polymorphisms using whole-genome sequences of 46 normal samples, the numbers of cancer-related rearrangements were 674 and 387 for G089 and PC346C, respectively. From these, 192 in G089 and 106 in PC346C affected gene structures. Exclusion of small intronic deletions left 33 intergenic breaks in G089 and 14 in PC346C. Out of these, 12 and 9 reassembled genes with the same orientation, capable of generating a feasible fusion transcript. Using PCR we validated all the reliable predicted gene fusions. Two gene fusions were in-frame: MPP5-FAM71D in PC346C and ARHGEF3-C8ORF38 in G089. Downregulation of FAM71D and MPP5-FAM71D transcripts in PC346C cells decreased proliferation; however, no effect was observed in the RWPE-1-immortalized normal prostate epithelial cells. Together, our data showed that gene rearrangements frequently occur in PCa genomes but result in a limited number of fusion transcripts.

Early-life exposure has been linked to increased risk for precancerous lesions in mammary and prostate glands and the uterus, but no prior study has shown a significant association between BPA exposure and cancer development.  Objective:   We explored the effects of BPA exposure during gestation and lactation on adult incidence of hepatic tumors in mice.  Methods:   Isogenic mice were perinatally exposed to BPA through maternal diets containing one of four environmentally relevant doses of BPA (0, 50 ng, 50 μg, or 50 mg per kilogram of diet), and we followed approximately one male and one female per litter until they were 10 months of age. Animals were tested for known risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma, including bacterial and viral infections.  Results:   We found dose-dependent incidence of hepatic tumors in 10-month-old BPA-exposed mice. Of the offspring examined, 23% presented with hepatic tumors or preneoplastic lesions. We observed a statistically significant dose-response relationship, with an odds ratio for neoplastic and preneoplastic lesions of 7.23 (95% CI: 3.23, 16.17) for mice exposed to 50 mg BPA/kg diet compared with unexposed controls. Observed early disease onset, absence of bacterial or viral infection, and lack of characteristic sexual dimorphism in tumor incidence support a nonclassical etiology.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first report of a statistically significant association between BPA exposure and frank tumors in any organ. Our results link early-life exposure to BPA with the development of hepatic tumors in rodents, and have potential implications for human health and disease.""","""['Caren Weinhouse', 'Olivia S Anderson', 'Ingrid L Bergin', 'David J Vandenbergh', 'Joseph P Gyekis', 'Marc A Dingman', 'Jingyun Yang', 'Dana C Dolinoy']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Environ Health Perspect""","""['Epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis implicates neuronal and inflammatory signaling pathways in adult murine hepatic tumorigenesis following perinatal exposure to bisphenol A.', 'Stat3 is a candidate epigenetic biomarker of perinatal Bisphenol A exposure associated with murine hepatic tumors with implications for human health.', 'Perinatally administered bisphenol a as a potential mammary gland carcinogen in rats.', 'Programming of metabolic effects in C57BL/6JxFVB mice by exposure to bisphenol A during gestation and lactation.', 'Perinatal bisphenol A exposure promotes dose-dependent alterations of the mouse methylome.', 'Low Dose of BPA Induces Liver Injury through Oxidative Stress, Inflammation and Apoptosis in Long-Evans Lactating Rats and Its Perinatal Effect on Female PND6 Offspring.', 'To Waste or Not to Waste: Questioning Potential Health Risks of Micro- and Nanoplastics with a Focus on Their Ingestion and Potential Carcinogenicity.', 'Genome Skimming with Nanopore Sequencing Precisely Determines Global and Transposon DNA Methylation in Vertebrates.', 'Long-term potentiation and depression regulatory microRNAs were highlighted in Bisphenol A induced learning and memory impairment by microRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.', 'An insight into bisphenol A, food exposure and its adverse effects on health: A review.']"""

Hepatic and intestinal biotransformation of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and modifiers of metabolic capacity could be important determinants of bioavailability in serum and tissues. Ginsenosides and their aglycones, mainly 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (aPPD) and 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (aPPT), are routinely ingested as health supplements. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential of ginsenosides and their aglycones to block hepatic and intestinal inactivation of 1α,25(OH)2D3, which is the most potent ligand of vitamin D receptor. In vitro biotransformation reactions were initiated with NADPH regenerating solutions following initial preincubation of pooled human hepatic or intestinal microsomal protein or human recombinant CYP3A4 supersomes with 1α,25(OH)2D3 or midazolam. Formation of hydroxylated metabolites of 1α,25(OH)2D3 or midazolam was analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Co-incubation of 1α,25(OH)2D3 with various ginsenosides (Rg1, Rh2, aPPD, aPPT and total ginsenosides) led to differential inhibition (30-100%) of its hydroxylation. Results suggest that aPPD, aPPT and Rh2 strongly attenuated the hydroxylation of 1α,25(OH)2D3. Follow up inhibition studies with aPPD and aPPT at varying concentrations (0.5-100μM) led to up to 91-100% inhibition of formation of hydroxylated metabolites of 1α,25(OH)2D3 thus preventing inactivation of active vitamin D3. The IC50 values of aPPD or aPPT for the most abundant hydroxylated metabolites of 1α,25(OH)2D3 ranged from 3.3 to 9.0μM in human microsomes. The inhibitory mechanism of aPPD or aPPT for CYP3A4-mediated biotransformation of 1α,25(OH)2D3 was competitive in nature (apparent Ki: 1.7-2.9μM). Similar inhibitory effects were also observed upon addition of aPPD or aPPT into midazolam hydroxylation assay. In summary, our results suggest that ginsenosides, specifically aPPD and aPPT, inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated catabolism of active vitamin D3 in human liver and intestine, potentially providing additional vitamin D-related benefits to patients with cancer, neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases.""","""['Subrata Deb', 'Mei Yieng Chin', 'Hans Adomat', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Abiraterone inhibits 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 metabolism by CYP3A4 in human liver and intestine in vitro.', 'Cytochrome P450 3A-mediated microsomal biotransformation of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in mouse and human liver: drug-related induction and inhibition of catabolism.', 'Identification of human cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the hepatic and intestinal biotransformation of 20(S)-protopanaxadiol.', 'Calcitriol regulates the expression of the genes encoding the three key vitamin D3 hydroxylases and the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 in the human fetal intestine.', '1alpha(OH)D3 One-alpha-hydroxy-cholecalciferol--an active vitamin D analog.

A clear definition of prognostic subgroups is mandatory.  Objective:   To develop a pretreatment prognostic model for PCa-specific survival (PCSS) in high-risk PCa based on combinations of unfavorable risk factors.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study including 1360 consecutive patients with high-risk PCa treated at eight European high-volume centers.  Intervention:   Retropubic radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Two Cox multivariable regression models were constructed to predict PCSS as a function of dichotomization of clinical stage (< cT3 vs cT3-4), Gleason score (GS) (2-7 vs 8-10), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA; ≤ 20 ng/ml vs > 20 ng/ml). The first ""extended"" model includes all seven possible combinations; the second ""simplified"" model includes three subgroups: a good prognosis subgroup (one single high-risk factor); an intermediate prognosis subgroup (PSA >20 ng/ml and stage cT3-4); and a poor prognosis subgroup (GS 8-10 in combination with at least one other high-risk factor). The predictive accuracy of the models was summarized and compared. Survival estimates and clinical and pathologic outcomes were compared between the three subgroups.  Results and limitations:   The simplified model yielded an R(2) of 33% with a 5-yr area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70 with no significant loss of predictive accuracy compared with the extended model (R(2): 34%; AUC: 0.71). The 5- and 10-yr PCSS rates were 98.7% and 95.4%, 96.5% and 88.3%, 88.8% and 79.7%, for the good, intermediate, and poor prognosis subgroups, respectively (p = 0.0003). Overall survival, clinical progression-free survival, and histopathologic outcomes significantly worsened in a stepwise fashion from the good to the poor prognosis subgroups. Limitations of the study are the retrospective design and the long study period.  Conclusions:   This study presents an intuitive and easy-to-use stratification of high-risk PCa into three prognostic subgroups.

Patients and methods:   Between 1993 and 2012, our institution has performed quantitation of prostate cancer DNA ploidy and Ki-67 (MIB-1) on most prostate cancer needle biopsy specimens. The outcomes of 451 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven cancer treated by radical prostatectomy between January 24, 1995, and December 29, 1998, without neoadjuvant hormonal therapy were assessed. Clinical and biopsy information obtained before radical prostatectomy was placed in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to predict local or systemic progression and cancer-specific death. Predictive ability was evaluated using a concordance index.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 12.9 years, 46 patients experienced local or systemic progression, and 18 patients died of prostate cancer. On multivariate analysis, the biopsy features of Ki-67 expression, perineural invasion, and Gleason score were associated with local or systemic progression. Ki-67 expression, perineural invasion, and Gleason score were associated with cancer-specific death with a concordance index of 0.892. After adjusting for perineural invasion and Gleason score, each 1% increase in Ki-67 expression was associated with a 12% increased risk of cancer-specific death (P<.001). Ki-67 expression alone was a strong predictor of cancer-specific outcomes and improved the predictive ability of currently used algorithms.  Conclusion:   This study documents that long-term prostate cancer outcomes are best estimated with a combination of Gleason score, perineural invasion, and Ki-67 expression. Given its low cost, rapid assessment, and strong predictive power, we believe that adding Ki-67 expression to perineural invasion and Gleason score at biopsy should be considered a standard by which all new biomarkers are compared before introducing them into clinical practice.""","""['Matthew K Tollefson', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Eugene D Kwon', 'Christine M Lohse', 'Laureano J Rangel', 'Lance A Mynderse', 'John C Cheville', 'Thomas J Sebo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mayo Clin Proc""","""['Perineural invasion as a predictor of biochemical outcome following radical prostatectomy for select men with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Perineural invasion and MIB-1 positivity in addition to Gleason score are significant preoperative predictors of progression after radical retropubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Can perineural invasion on prostate needle biopsy predict prostate specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy?', 'Multiple measures of carcinoma extent versus perineural invasion in prostate needle biopsy tissue in prediction of pathologic stage in a screening population.', 'Angiogenesis, p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in the progression of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Multiparametric MRI radiomics in prostate cancer for predicting Ki-67 expression and Gleason score: a multicenter retrospective study.', 'Neurons as stromal drivers of nervous system cancer formation and progression.', 'Ki-67, topoisomerase IIα and miR-221 have a limited prostate cancer risk stratification ability on a medium-term follow-up: results of a high-risk radical prostatectomy cohort.', 'The Role of Perineural Invasion in Prostate Cancer and Its Prognostic Significance.', 'Detection of perineural invasion in prostate needle biopsies with deep neural networks.']"""

One of the main reasons for this phenomenon might reside in concerns regarding the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Objective:   To compare perioperative outcomes between patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and those treated with RC alone.  Design, setting, and participants:   Relying on the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare-linked database, 3760 patients diagnosed with MIBC between 2000 and 2009 were evaluated.  Intervention:   RC alone or RC plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Complications occurred within 30 and 90 d after surgery. Heterologous blood transfusions (HBTs), length of stay (LoS), readmission, and perioperative mortality were compared. To decrease the effect of unmeasured confounders associated with treatment selection, propensity score-matched analyses were performed.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 416 (11.1%) of patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Following propensity score matching, 416 (20%) and 1664 (80%) patients treated with RC plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy and RC alone remained, respectively. The 30-d complication, readmission, and mortality rates were 66.0%, 32.2%, and 5.3%, respectively. The 90-d complication, readmission, and mortality rates were 72.5%, 46.6%, and 8.2%, respectively. When patients were stratified according to neoadjuvant chemotherapy status, no significant differences were observed in the rates of complications, HBT, prolonged LoS, readmission, and mortality between the two groups (all p ≥ 0.1). These results were confirmed in multivariate analyses, where the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with higher risk of 30- and 90-d complications, HBT, prolonged LoS, readmission, and mortality (all p ≥ 0.1). Our study is limited by its retrospective nature.  Conclusions:   The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not associated with higher perioperative morbidity or mortality. These results should encourage wider use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy when clinically indicated.

Method:   Fifty patients who completed post-prostatectomy radiotherapy had two expansion margins applied to the planning CT CTV: PTV10 (10 mm isometrically) and PTV5 (5 mm posteriorly, 10 mm all other directions). The CTV was then contoured on 477 pre-treatment CBCTs, and PTV5 and PTV10 coverage of each CBCT-CTVs was assessed. The maximum distance from the planning CT CTV to the combined CTV of all CBCTs including the planning CT CTV was measured for the superior part of the prostate bed, and the inferior part of the prostate bed, for every patient.  Results:   The mean difference between largest and smallest CBCT-CTVs per patient was 18.7 cm(3) (range 6.3-34.2 cm(3)). Out of 477 CBCTs, there were 43 anterior geometric geographical misses for either PTV with a mean volume of 2.25 cm(3) (range 0.01-18.88 cm(3)). For PTV10, there were 26 posterior geometric geographical misses with a mean volume of 1.37 cm(3) (0.01-11.02 cm(3)). For PTV5, there were 46 posterior geometric geographical misses with a mean volume of 3.22 cm(3) (0.01-19.82 cm(3)). The maximum edge-to-edge distance for the superior prostate bed was anterior 19 mm, posterior 16 mm, left and right 7 mm. The maximum edge-to-edge distance for the inferior prostate bed was anterior 4mm, posterior 12 mm, left and right 7 mm.  Conclusion:   This study supports differential margins for the superior and inferior portions of the prostate bed.

Subsequently, compassionate-use programmes (CUPs) and expanded-access programmes (EAPs) were established worldwide, allowing access to cabazitaxel before its commercial availability. Preliminary results of the European CUP/EAP, focusing on the elderly population (aged > or =70 years), are reported.  Patients and methods:   Enrolled patients with progressive mCRPC received cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2) plus 10mg oral prednisone/prednisolone every 3 weeks until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity or physician/patient decision. Safety was analysed by age group (<70, 70-74 and > or =75 years). The influence of selected variables on grade > or =3 neutropenia and/or neutropenic complications was analysed in multivariate analysis.  Results:   746 men were enrolled (<70 years, n=421; 70-74, n=180, > or =75 years, n=145). Number of cabazitaxel cycles, dose reductions for any cause, dose delays possibly related to cabazitaxel adverse events, and tolerability were similar in the three age groups. Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) use was more common in men aged > or =0 years. In multivariate analysis, age > or =75 years, treatment cycle 1, and neutrophil count <4000/mm3 before cabazitaxel injection were associated with increased risk of developing grade > or =3 neutropenia and/or neutropenic complications. Prophylactic use of G-CSF at a given cycle significantly reduced this risk by 30% (odds ratio 0.70, p=0.04).  Conclusion:   The results suggest that cabazitaxel has a manageable safety profile in everyday clinical practice. Prophylactic use of G-CSF, especially at cycle 1 and in men aged > or =75 years, is important and improves tolerability in senior adults treated with cabazitaxel.""","""['Axel Heidenreich', 'Sergio Bracarda', 'Malcolm Mason', 'Haluk Ozen', 'Lisa Sengelov', 'Inge Van Oort', 'Christos Papandreou', 'Sophie Fossa', 'Simon Hitier', 'Miguel Angel Climent;European investigators']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Prednisone plus cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel treatment: a randomised open-label trial.', 'Cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: results of a compassionate use program in the Netherlands.', 'Severe neutropenia during cabazitaxel treatment is associated with survival benefit in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC): A post-hoc analysis of the TROPIC phase III trial.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: changing landscape with cabazitaxel.', 'Taxanes in the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: efficacy and management of toxicity.', 'Feasibility of cabazitaxel in octogenarian prostate cancer patients.', 'Results from Expanded Access Programs: A Review of Academic Literature.', 'Generating Evidence from Expanded Access Use of Rare Disease Medicines: Challenges and Recommendations.', 'Efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel therapy in elderly (≥75\xa0years) patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: A multiinstitutional study.', 'Cabazitaxel versus abiraterone or enzalutamide in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: post hoc analysis of the CARD study excluding chemohormonal therapy for castrate-naive disease.']"""

Methods:   From 1990 to 2009 we performed SSC in 88 patients with non-muscle-invasive BC and in 10 patients with muscle-invasive BC away from the bladder neck. Sixty-one of the 98 patients (1990-2002) underwent cystoadenomectomy with ileocapsuloplasty (ICP), consisting of the anastomosis between the Camey II ileal reservoir and the upper edge of the prostatic capsule. This technique was affected by a relevant percentage of anastomotic stricture (11%). From 2003 to 2009, we performed the endocapsular ileourethral anastomosis (EIUA) in 30 patients, on the basis of the direct anastomosis between the ileal reservoir and the urethral stump inside the prostatic apex. Seven patients were lost to follow-up.  Results:   After a mean follow-up of 102 months, 81 patients (89%) were alive, and 10 patients (11%) had died (8 of disease progression). Early and late complication rates were 25% and 24%, respectively. Complete daytime continence was obtained in 87 patients (95.6%), and nighttime continence was achieved in 34 patients (37%). In the ICP group, stricture of the prostatic fossa affected 7 patients (11%), whereas no neobladder-urethral anastomosis stricture was noticed in the EIUA group. Normal erectile function was preserved in 87 patients (95.6%).  Conclusion:   SSC offers good oncologic and functional results in carefully selected patients.

We have previously reported that the chemopreventive polyphenol Curcumin inhibits the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and -2 leading to diminished formation of breast and prostate cancer metastases. In the present study, we have analyzed the effects of Curcumin on miRNA expression and its correlation to the anti-tumorigenic properties of this natural occurring polyphenol. Using microarray miRNA expression analyses, we show here that Curcumin modulates the expression of a series of miRNAs, including miR181b, in metastatic breast cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that miR181b down-modulates CXCL1 and -2 through a direct binding to their 3'-UTR. Overexpression or inhibition of miR181b in metastatic breast cancer cells has a significant impact on CXCL1 and -2 and is required for the effect of Curcumin on these two cytokines. miR181b also mediates the effects of Curcumin on inhibition of proliferation and invasion as well as induction of apoptosis. Importantly, over-expression of miR181b in metastatic breast cancer cells inhibits metastasis formation in vivo in immunodeficient mice. Finally, we demonstrated that Curcumin up-regulates miR181b and down-regulates CXCL1 and -2 in cells isolated from several primary human breast cancers. Taken together, these data show that Curcumin provides a simple bridge to bring metastamir modulation into the clinic, placing it in a primary and tertiary preventive, as well as a therapeutic, setting.""","""['Emanuel Kronski', 'Micol E Fiori', 'Ottavia Barbieri', 'Simonetta Astigiano', 'Valentina Mirisola', 'Peter H Killian', 'Antonino Bruno', 'Arianna Pagani', 'Francesca Rovera', 'Ulrich Pfeffer', 'Christian P Sommerhoff', 'Douglas M Noonan', 'Andreas G Nerlich', 'Laura Fontana', 'Beatrice E Bachmeier']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Curcumin inhibits prostate cancer metastasis in vivo by targeting the inflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and -2.', 'Curcumin downregulates the inflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and -2 in breast cancer cells via NFkappaB.', 'Curcumin as an Adjunct Therapy and microRNA Modulator in Breast Cancer.', 'The chemopreventive polyphenol Curcumin prevents hematogenous breast cancer metastases in immunodeficient mice.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Anti-metastatic Activity of Curcumin.', 'Novel Insights into the Therapeutic Potential of Curcumin and Derivatives.', 'Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Applications of Curcumin: Update.', 'Curcumin and chemokines: mechanism of action and therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases.', 'Curcumin a Natural Phenol and Its Therapeutic Role in Cancer and Photodynamic Therapy: A Review.', 'Anti-Arthritic and Anti-Cancer Activities of Polyphenols: A Review of the Most Recent In Vitro Assays.']"""

Its role as an anti-cancer agent has drawn significant attention because of its minimal side effects and low cost. However, its mechanism of anti-tumour action has not yet been fully clarified.  Methods:   The effect on cell growth was assessed by cell counting. Western blot was used for analysis of protein levels, Boyden chamber assays for analyses of cell migration and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) followed by western blot, PCR or qPCR for analysis of protein-protein and protein-mRNA interactions.  Results:   Metformin showed an anti-proliferative effect on a wide range of prostate cancer cells. It disrupted the AR translational MID1 regulator complex leading to release of the associated AR mRNA and subsequently to downregulation of AR protein in AR positive cell lines. Inhibition of AR positive and negative prostate cancer cells by metformin suggests involvement of additional targets. The inhibitory effect of metformin was mimicked by disruption of the MID1-α4/PP2A protein complex by siRNA knockdown of MID1 or α4 whereas AMPK activation was not required.  Conclusions:   Findings reported herein uncover a mechanism for the anti-tumor activity of metformin in prostate cancer, which is independent of its anti-diabetic effects. These data provide a rationale for the use of metformin in the treatment of hormone naïve and castration-resistant prostate cancer and suggest AR is an important indirect target of metformin.""","""['Ummuhan Demir', 'Andrea Koehler', 'Rainer Schneider', 'Susann Schweiger', 'Helmut Klocker']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A hormone-dependent feedback-loop controls androgen receptor levels by limiting MID1, a novel translation enhancer and promoter of oncogenic signaling.', 'Metformin represses androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancers by targeting androgen receptor.', 'The interplay of AMP-activated protein kinase and androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'BAG1L: a promising therapeutic target for androgen receptor-dependent prostate cancer.', 'Increased androgen receptor transcription: a cause of castration-resistant prostate cancer and a possible therapeutic target.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Midline 1 Regulates Endothelial Cell ICAM-1 Expression and Neutrophil Adhesion in Abdominal Sepsis.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'TRIM18 is a critical regulator of viral myocarditis and organ inflammation.', 'Metformin and Cancer Hallmarks: Molecular Mechanisms in Thyroid, Prostate and Head and Neck Cancer Models.']"""

Cancer treatment with chemotherapy can result in many unwanted side effects, including peripheral neuropathy if the drugs are potentially neurotoxic. Peripheral neuropathy and other side effects of chemotherapy may lead to an increased risk of fall-related injuries.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using the records of 65,311 patients with breast, colon, lung, or prostate cancer treated with chemotherapy in the SEER-Medicare database from 1994 to 2007. The primary outcome was any fall-related injury defined as a traumatic fracture, dislocation, or head injury within 12 months of the first dose of chemotherapy. The sample population was divided into 3 cohorts based on whether they most frequently received a neurotoxic doublet, single agent, or a non-neurotoxic chemotherapy. Cox proportional-hazards analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics to determine the risk of fall-related injuries among the 3 cohorts.  Results:   The rate of fall-related injuries for patients receiving a doublet of neurotoxic chemotherapy (9.15 per 1000 person-months) was significantly higher than for those receiving a single neurotoxic agent (7.76 per 1000 person-months) or a non-neurotoxic agent (5.19 per 1000 person-months). Based on the Cox proportional-hazards model risk of fall-related injuries was highest for the cohort receiving a neurotoxic doublet after the model was adjusted for baseline characteristics.

Although results of CF-EBRT are well known, the use of SBRT for prostate cancer is a more recent development, and long-term follow-up is not yet available. However, rapid post-treatment PSA decline and low PSA nadir have been linked to improved clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the PSA kinetics between CF-EBRT and SBRT in newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer.  Materials/methods:   75 patients with low to low-intermediate risk prostate cancer (T1-T2; GS 3 + 3, PSA < 20 or 3 + 4, PSA < 15) treated without hormones with CF-EBRT (>70.2 Gy, <76 Gy) to the prostate only, were identified from a prospectively collected cohort of patients treated at the University of California, San Francisco (1997-2012). Patients were excluded if they failed therapy by the Phoenix definition or had less than 1 year of follow-up or <3 PSAs. 43 patients who were treated with SBRT to the prostate to 38 Gy in 4 daily fractions also met the same criteria. PSA nadir and rate of change in PSA over time (slope) were calculated from the completion of RT to 1, 2 and 3 years post-RT.  Results:   The median PSA nadir and slope for CF-EBRT was 1.00, 0.72 and 0.60 ng/ml and -0.09, -0.04, -0.02 ng/ml/month, respectively, for durations of 1, 2 and 3 years post RT. Similarly, for SBRT, the median PSA nadirs and slopes were 0.70, 0.40, 0.24 ng and -0.09, -0.06, -0.05 ng/ml/month, respectively. The PSA slope for SBRT was greater than CF-EBRT (p < 0.05) at 2 and 3 years following RT, although similar during the first year. Similarly, PSA nadir was significantly lower for SBRT when compared to EBRT for years 2 and 3 (p < 0.005).  Conclusion:   Patients treated with SBRT experienced a lower PSA nadir and greater rate of decline in PSA 2 and 3 years following completion of RT than with CF-EBRT, consistent with delivery of a higher bioequivalent dose.

IMPACT (Identification of Men with a genetic predisposition to ProstAte Cancer: Targeted screening in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and controls) is an international consortium of 62 centres in 20 countries evaluating the use of targeted PCa screening in men with BRCA1/2 mutations.  Objective:   To report the first year's screening results for all men at enrollment in the study.  Design, setting and participants:   We recruited men aged 40-69 yr with germline BRCA1/2 mutations and a control group of men who have tested negative for a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation known to be present in their families. All men underwent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing at enrollment, and those men with PSA >3 ng/ml were offered prostate biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PSA levels, PCa incidence, and tumour characteristics were evaluated. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the number of PCa cases among groups and the differences among disease types.  Results and limitations:   We recruited 2481 men (791 BRCA1 carriers, 531 BRCA1 controls; 731 BRCA2 carriers, 428 BRCA2 controls). A total of 199 men (8%) presented with PSA >3.0 ng/ml, 162 biopsies were performed, and 59 PCas were diagnosed (18 BRCA1 carriers, 10 BRCA1 controls; 24 BRCA2 carriers, 7 BRCA2 controls); 66% of the tumours were classified as intermediate- or high-risk disease. The positive predictive value (PPV) for biopsy using a PSA threshold of 3.0 ng/ml in BRCA2 mutation carriers was 48%-double the PPV reported in population screening studies. A significant difference in detecting intermediate- or high-risk disease was observed in BRCA2 carriers. Ninety-five percent of the men were white, thus the results cannot be generalised to all ethnic groups.  Conclusions:   The IMPACT screening network will be useful for targeted PCa screening studies in men with germline genetic risk variants as they are discovered.

We present projections of cancer incidence rates and cases for the period up to 2015-2019 in Switzerland.  Methods:   Projections were based on cancer incidence data estimated from cancer registries for the 1989-2009 periods and demographic projections of the Federal Statistical Office. Age-specific incidence rates were modelled as a function of age, period-birth cohort using NORDPRED.  Results:   Up to 2019 the incidence of all cancers combined is expected to decrease slightly for both sexes. Nevertheless, the overall number of cases is predicted to increase. The number of male cancer cases will increase by 30%, from 20005 in 2005-2009 to 25910/year in 2015-2019. For females the number will increase by 20%, from 16913 to 20359/year in 2015-2019. Changes in the population size and structure will be responsible for most of the increase. Among men, the largest increase is observed for melanoma (+54%), thyroid (+45%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (+43%), and prostate (+37%). Prostate cancer will contribute with 8083 cases, colorectal cancer with 2908 and lung cancer with 2791. For women, cases of lung and oral cavity cancers will increase by +48% and +38%, respectively; those of thyroid by +45% and non-Hodgkin lymphoma by +36%. The sites with the most cancer predicted are breast (5870), colorectal and lung (over 2000 each), melanoma (1341) and corpus uteri (1040). The overall annual cancer burden predicted for 2015-19 is of 46269 new cases in Switzerland.

The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate psychosocial distress in melanoma patients using an expert rating instrument [basic documentation for psycho-oncology short version (PO-Bado SF)]; (ii) determine associated demographic and clinical variables; and (iii) assess the acceptance of using PO-Bado SF as a routine procedure in a skin cancer unit.  Methods:   A cross-sectional group of 696 melanoma patients was recruited. During the routine contact, doctors assessed the patients subjective distress using PO-Bado SF. Sociodemographic data, tumour data, treatment and the course of the disease were extracted from the patients' charts.  Results:   PO-Bado SF was completed in 688 of 696 (99%) participating patients, revealing a high acceptance. In 51 (7%) patients, the PO-Bado SF cut-off score indicated the potential need of psychosocial support. Patients with previous or ongoing radiotherapy, a history of major surgery due to organ metastases, younger age and shorter time since diagnosis were considered significantly more distressed than patients without these criteria. Patients were most distressed by suffering from anxiety/worries and/or tensions. In younger patients emotional variables and other problems like social or family problems were deemed more relevant while functional limitations in daily living were reasons for higher distress in older patients.  Conclusion:   PO-Bado SF is a useful, well-accepted, practical and economic screening tool to identify distressed melanoma patients. Although most melanoma patients seem to cope well with their disease, special attention should be given to young patients in the first years after initial diagnosis and to patients with advanced disease, radiotherapy and major surgery due to their disease.

Rb functions to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, as well as cell death. Therefore, even though Rb inactivation promotes cancer development, this may also open up certain vulnerabilities of cancers that can potentially be targeted with drug intervention. Based on the assumption that cancers that have mutation, deletion, or rearrangement in the Rb locus represent strong loss of Rb function while cancers with WT Rb on average retain some Rb function, we searched Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database to identify cancer drugs that are particularly effective to cancers with Rb genomic alterations. Three mitotic inhibitors were identified from this analysis. We further tested the effects of two mitotic inhibitors, Taxol and STLC, on prostate and breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that the Rb status affects cancer cell sensitivity to these mitotic drugs and that the sensitizing effects of Rb are mediated in part by its regulation of the cell cycle checkpoint protein Mad2. Since the mitotic inhibitors identified in our analysis inhibit mitosis through distinct targets, it is possible that the Rb functional status may serve as a general biomarker for cancer sensitivity to mitotic inhibitors. Because the Rb pathway is inactivated in a large number of human cancers, identification of agents that are particularly effective or ineffective based on the Rb status in cancers can potentially be used generally to matching patients with appropriate treatments to achieve better therapeutic outcome.""","""['Jiong Zhao', 'Zhenyu Zhang', 'Yang Liao', 'Wei Du']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Cancer Res""","""['Functional inactivation of Rb sensitizes cancer cells to TSC2 inactivation induced cell death.', 'Rb inactivation promotes genomic instability by uncoupling cell cycle progression from mitotic control.', 'Hypothesis: Retinoblastoma protein inactivation mediates effects of histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced Wnt hyperactivation in colorectal cancer cells.', 'The rb pathway and cancer therapeutics.', 'Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor and genome stability.', 'Dbf4-Cdc7 (DDK) Inhibitor PHA-767491 Displays Potent Anti-Proliferative Effects via Crosstalk with the CDK2-RB-E2F Pathway.', 'Cross-species identification of PIP5K1-, splicing- and ubiquitin-related pathways as potential targets for RB1-deficient cells.', 'Study of polymorphisms in the TP53 and RB1 genes in children with retinoblastoma in northern Mexico.', 'Drug discovery in advanced prostate cancer: translating biology into therapy.', 'Treatment of Retinoblastoma: The Role of External Beam Radiotherapy.']"""

This program has been recognized as an option for opportunistic screening, particularly in Japan. However, reports on diagnostic accuracy have been limited. We aimed to evaluate the detectability and related properties of this screening program among asymptomatic individuals in a community setting.  Methods:   The study participants were 1,762 residents of Osaka Prefecture, Japan, who underwent opportunistic cancer screening at Higashitemma Clinic for the first time between November 2004 and December 2005. FDG-PET cancer screening was performed with several imaging modalities (e.g., FDG-PET, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography) and fecal occult blood test. Screening records were linked to the Osaka cancer registry within 1 year after the screening to determine sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values.  Results:   After excluding 12 participants with cancer detected before the screening, 33 were identified by the cancer registry to have primary cancers. Of these, the present screening program found that 28 were positive (6 prostate, 5 lung, 5 colorectal, 5 thyroid, 3 liver and 4 others). Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values were 84.8 % (28/33, 95 % confidence interval 69.1-93.3), 86.8 % (1,491/1,718, 85.1-88.3) and 10.1 % (28/277, 6.4-12.9), respectively.

Little is known about how modifiable factors such as social support are associated with active participation in follow-up care. This study tests associations between social support, cancer-related follow-up care use, and self-efficacy for participation in decision-making related to follow-up care (SEDM). We also identified sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with social support among long-term survivors.  Methods:   The FOllow-up Care Use among Survivors study is a cross-sectional, population-based survey of breast, prostate, colon, and gynecologic cancer survivors (n=1522) 4-14 years post-diagnosis. Multivariable regression models were used to test associations between perceived social support (tangible and emotional/informational support modeled separately), follow-up care use (past 2 years), and SEDM, as well as to identify factors associated with perceived support.  Results:   Neither support type was associated with follow-up care use (all p>0.05), although marital status was uniquely, positively associated with follow-up care use (p<0.05). Both tangible support (B for a standard deviation increase (SE)=9.75(3.15), p<0.05) and emotional/informational support (B(SE)=12.61(3.05), p<0.001) were modestly associated with SEDM. Being married, having adequate financial resources, history of recurrence, and better perceived health status were associated with higher perceived tangible and emotional support (all p<0.05).

In this study, we examined the efficacy of the natural compound andrographolide (AP), a diterpenoid lactone isolated from the traditional Chinese and Indian medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata, in reducing breast cancer-induced osteolysis. AP prevented human breast cancer-induced bone loss by suppressing RANKL-mediated and human breast cancer cell-induced osteoclast differentiation. Molecular analysis revealed that AP prevented osteoclast function by inhibiting RANKL-induced NF-κB and ERK signaling pathway in lower dose (20 μM), as well as inducing apoptosis at higher dose (40 μM).

Nestin is thought to regulate tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion and CSC properties. Here, we confirmed nestin expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Immunohistochemical analysis in surgical specimens detected nestin protein expression in the cytoplasm of 20 of 48 adenocarcinoma (AD) cases (41.7%) and 25 of 47 squamous cell carcinoma cases (53.2%). Nestin immunoreactivity significantly correlated with not only tumor size and lymph node metastasis in NSCLC, but also poor survival in surgical patients with AD. High and moderate expression levels of nestin were confirmed in several lung AD cell lines including H1975 and PC-3. Nestin inhibition by shRNA decreased proliferation, migration, invasion and sphere formation in AD cells. Correspondingly, nestin upregulation by nestin gene transfection resulted in the opposite changes. Moreover, Akt inhibitor IV effectively decreased nestin expression via SRY-box containing protein 2 (Sox2) downregulation and overcame the enhanced sphere formation induced by nestin upregulation. Overall, our results show that nestin correlates with the aggressiveness and stemness of AD. Regulation of nestin via Akt/Sox2 is, thus, a promising candidate for novel therapeutic approaches to eradicate CSCs in lung AD.""","""['Kosuke Narita', 'Yoko Matsuda', 'Masahiro Seike', 'Zenya Naito', 'Akihiko Gemma', 'Toshiyuki Ishiwata']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Expression and Comparison of Cbl-b in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Adenocarcinoma.', 'Role of the stem cell-associated intermediate filament nestin in malignant proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Association of SOX2 and Nestin DNA amplification and protein expression with clinical features and overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Rac1 targeting suppresses human non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma cancer stem cell activity.', 'Nestin and other putative cancer stem cell markers in pancreatic cancer.', 'Illuminating the role of lncRNAs ROR and MALAT1 in cancer stemness state of anaplastic thyroid cancer: An exploratory study.', 'The intermediate filament protein nestin serves as a molecular hub for smooth muscle cytoskeletal signaling.', 'Epigenetic Rewiring of Metastatic Cancer to the Brain: Focus on Lung and Colon Cancers.', 'Nestin protein affects the maintenance of stem characteristics of colorectal cancer cells based on p53 dependent pathway.', 'Nestin Modulates Airway Smooth Muscle Cell Migration by Affecting Spatial Rearrangement of Vimentin Network and Focal Adhesion Assembly.']"""

Here we investigate AR-gene amplification in cancers before hormone deprivation therapy.  Methods:   A tissue microarray (TMA) series of 596 hormone-naive prostate cancers (HNPCas) was screened for chromosome X and AR-gene locus-specific copy number alterations using four-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation.  Results:   Both high level gain in chromosome X (≥4 fold; n=4, 0.7%) and locus-specific amplification of the AR-gene (n=6, 1%) were detected at low frequencies in HNPCa TMAs. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation mapping whole sections taken from the original HNPCa specimen blocks demonstrated that AR-gene amplifications exist in small foci of cells (≤ 600 nm, ≤1% of tumour volume). Patients with AR gene-locus-specific copy number gains had poorer prostate cancer-specific survival.  Conclusion:   Small clonal foci of cancer containing high level gain of the androgen receptor (AR)-gene develop before hormone deprivation therapy. Their small size makes detection by TMA inefficient and suggests a higher prevalence than that reported herein.

The presence of NAFLD, BMI, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, and histological findings including Gleason score (GSc) were analyzed in regard to their association with BCR.

Liver X receptors (LXRs) agonists have been recently introduced for PCa treatment. We postulated that LXR may inhibit the carcinogenesis of PCa via the SOCS3 pathway.  Methods:   LNCaP cells were cultured and transfected with SOCS3 small-interfering RNA (SOCS3-siRNA) and control small-interfering RNA (control-siRNA). Then cells were treated with LXR activator (GW3965). The expressions of PCa related transcript factors, e.g. transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activation protein 1(AP1) were detected by western blot assay. In vitro cell proliferation, cell migration, cell invasion and apoptosis were analysed. Nude mice were used for in vivo tumorgenesis.  Results:   In cells treated with control-siRNA, GW3965 enhanced SOCS3 expression and significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3, NF-κB and AP1 expressions, accompanied by dramatically reduced cellular proliferation rate, immigration and invasion of cultured cells. In cells treated with SOCS3-siRNA, the inhibitory effects of LXR activator on the phosphorylation of STAT3 and expressions of NF-κB and AP1 were totally abolished. The cell proliferation rate, immigration and invasion were markedly elevated by SOCS3 gene mutation, even with GW3965 treatment. The in vivo tumorgenesis assay showed that GW3965 significantly reduced the tumor volumes in tumor-bearing nude mice receiving saline injection, but failed to limit the tumor volume in tumor-bearing nude mice receiving SOCS3 antibody injection.

Closo-, nido- and iodo-carborane conjugates were prepared and screened in vitro where the water soluble iodinated cluster had the highest affinity with an IC50 value (73.2 nM) that was comparable to a known PSMA inhibitor 2-(phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid (PMPA, 63.9 nM).

To improve PDT, current research focuses on the development of photosensitizers to specifically target cancer cells. In the past few years, aptamers have been developed to directly deliver cargo molecules into target cells. We conjugated the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (ce6) with a human interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) binding RNA aptamer, AIR-3A yielding AIR-3A-ce6 for application in high efficient PDT. AIR-3A-ce6 was rapidly and specifically internalized by IL-6R presenting (IL-6R(+)) cells. Upon light irradiation, targeted cells were selectively killed, while free ce6 did not show any toxic effect. Cells lacking the IL-6R were also not affected by AIR-3A-ce6. With this approach, we improved the target specificity of ce6-mediated PDT. In the future, other tumor-specific aptamers might be used to selectively localize photosensitizers into cells of interest and improve the efficacy and specificity of PDT in cancer and other diseases.Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2014) 3, e143; doi:10.1038/mtna.2013.70; published online 21 January 2014.""","""['Sven Kruspe', 'Cindy Meyer', 'Ulrich Hahn']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Ther Nucleic Acids""","""['Novel Photosensitizer β-Mannose-Conjugated Chlorin e6 as a Potent Anticancer Agent for Human Glioblastoma U251 Cells.', 'A Basic Study of Photodynamic Therapy with Glucose-Conjugated Chlorin e6 Using Mammary Carcinoma Xenografts.', 'Polylactide-Based Block Copolymeric Micelles Loaded with Chlorin e6 for Photodynamic Therapy: In Vitro Evaluation in Monolayer and 3D Spheroid Models.', 'Charomers-Interleukin-6 Receptor Specific Aptamers for Cellular Internalization and Targeted Drug Delivery.', 'Potential of Photodynamic Therapy Based on Sugar-Conjugated Photosensitizers.', 'Recent advances in aptamer-based targeted drug delivery systems for cancer therapy.', 'A Photosensitized Singlet Oxygen (1O2) Toolbox for Bio-Organic Applications: Tailoring 1O2 Generation for DNA and Protein Labelling, Targeting and Biosensing.', 'Aptamers for Proteins Associated with Rheumatic Diseases: Progress, Challenges, and Prospects of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications.', 'Ligand-Targeted Delivery of Photosensitizers for Cancer Treatment.', 'pH responsive superporogen combined with PDT based on poly Ce6 ionic liquid grafted on SiO2 for combating MRSA biofilm infection.']"""

This finding was confirmed in human prostate cancer cells in which PTEN expression was abolished by RNA interference-mediated attenuation. These results were consistent with clinical evidence that the expression of p300 and AR correlates positively in human prostate cancer specimens. Mechanistically, PTEN inactivation increased AR phosphorylation at serine 81 (Ser81) to promote p300 binding and acetylation of AR, thereby precluding its polyubiquitination and degradation. In support of these findings, in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer in the mouse, we found that p300 was crucial for AR target gene expression.

Clinical and radiological-free progression survival is 9.5 ± 1 months (CI 95%: 7.7-11.3) and biochemical response is 6.8 ± 1 months (CI 95%: 5-8.7). Only the treatment with chemotherapy impaired significantly the response time to AA [6.4 months for radiological-free progression survival (CI 95%: 4.2-8,6) and 4.3 months for biochemical-free progression survival (CI 95%: 2.6-6)]. The incidence of adverse drug events was 36%, all of them grade 1-2/4 and, in no case, suspension or reduction of the dose of AA was needed.  Conclusions:   The treatment with AA has been effective in our series, with a tolerability considerably higher than what other studies published.""","""['P Beardo-Villar', 'M J Ledo-Cepero', 'R Gavira-Moreno', 'M Soto-Delgado', 'J Soto-Villalba', 'J L Alvarez-Ossorio', 'A Juárez-Soto']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Pre-chemotherapy abiraterone acetate.

The fluencies, measured by a 2D detector, were used by COMPASS to forward calculate dose in CT patients and reconstruct dose-volume-histogram (DVH). The gamma analysis was performed, using both the criteria 3%-3-mm and 2%-2 mm, for the whole grid patient and the per-structure volume. A DVH-based analysis was accomplished for target and organs-at-risk (OAR). The correlation between gamma passing rates and DVH discrepancies was performed using Pearson's test. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of whole and per-structure gamma method were calculated. No significant DVH deviation was observed for target and OAR. Weak correlation between gamma passing rates and dosimetric deviations was observed, all significant r-values were negative. The whole gamma method shows lack of sensitivity to detect dosimetric deviations >5%. Instead, a better balance between sensitivity and specificity was obtained employing per structure gamma both with 3%-3 mm and 2%-2 mm criteria.

Methods:   RGD-Glu-6Ahx-RM2] was conjugated to a NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) complexing agent to produce [RGD-Glu-[NO2A]-6-Ahx-RM2], which was purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and characterized by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Radiolabeling of the conjugate with (64)Cu produced [RGD-Glu-[(64)Cu-NO2A]-6-Ahx-RM2 in high radiochemical yield (≥95%). In vivo behavior of the radiolabeled peptide conjugate was investigated in normal CF-1 mice and in the PC-3 human prostate cancer experimental model.  Results:   A competitive displacement receptor binding assay in human prostate PC-3 cells using (125)I-[Tyr(4)]BBN as the radioligand showed high binding affinity of [RGD-Glu-[(nat)Cu-NO2A]-6-Ahx-RM2] conjugate for the GRPr (3.09±0.34 nM). A similar assay in human, glioblastoma U87-MG cells using (125)I-Echistatin as the radioligand indicated a moderate receptor-binding affinity for the αvβ3 integrin (518±37.5 nM). In vivo studies of [RGD-Glu-[(64)Cu-NO2A]-6-Ahx-RM2] showed high accumulation (4.86±1.01 %ID/g, 1h post-intravenous injection (p.i.)) and prolonged retention (4.26±1.23 %ID/g, 24h p.i.) of tracer in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice.

Among these proteins are the tissue-specific claudins, proteins that have recently been suggested as tumor markers for several different types of cancer. An altered claudin expression has been observed in colon, prostatic, ovarian, and breast carcinoma. The aim of this study was to analyze the allele frequencies of three common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes for claudin 1 and claudin 7 in colon cancer (CC) patients and in a control population of healthy blood donors. Pyrosequencing was used to genotype the CLDN1 SNP rs9869263 (c.369C>T), and the CLDN7 SNPs rs4562 (c.590C>T) and rs374400 (c.606T>G) in DNA from 102 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) colon cancer tissue, and 111 blood leukocyte DNA from blood/plasma donors. These results were correlated with clinical parameters such as TNM stage, tumor localization, tumor differentiation, complexity index, sex, and age. We found that there was a significant association between the CLDN1 genotype CC in tumor samples and a higher risk of colon cancer development (OR 3.0, p < 0.001). We also found that the CLDN7 rs4562 (c.590C>T) genotype CT had a higher risk of lymph node involvement (p = 0.031) and a lower degree of tumor differentiation (p = 0.028). In the control population, the allele frequencies were very similar to those in the HapMap cohort for CLDN7. The CLDN1 rs9869263 genotype (c.369C>T) was related to increased risk of colon cancer, and the CLDN7 rs4562 genotype (c.590C>T) was related to tumor differentiation and lymph node involvement in colon carcinoma.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of Polyphenon E, a green tea extract, in reducing the progression of prostate cancer in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. A total of 119 male TRAMP and 119 C57BL/6J mice were treated orally with one of 3 doses of Polyphenon E (200, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day) in drinking water ad libitum replicating human achievable doses. Baseline assessments were performed before treatments. Safety and efficacy assessments during treatments were performed when mice were 12, 22, and 32 weeks old. The number and size of tumors in treated TRAMP mice were significantly decreased compared with untreated animals. In untreated 32 weeks old TRAMP mice, prostate carcinoma metastasis to distant sites was observed in 100% of mice (8/8), compared with 13% of mice (2/16) treated with high-dose Polyphenon E during the same period. Furthermore, Polyphenon E treatment significantly inhibited metastasis in TRAMP mice in a dose-dependent manner (P = 0.0003). Long-term (32 weeks) treatment with Polyphenon E was safe and well tolerated with no evidence of toxicity in C57BL/6J mice. Polyphenon E is an effective chemopreventive agent in preventing the progression of prostate cancer to metastasis in TRAMP mice. Polyphenon E showed no toxicity in these mouse models.

Inorganic lead has been classified as a probable human carcinogen. Lead (Pb) inhibits delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), a gene recently implicated in other genitourinary cancers. The ALAD enzyme is involved in the second step of heme biosynthesis and is an endogenous inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, a master system for protein degradation and a current target of cancer therapy.  Methods:   Using a case-only study design, we assessed potential gene-environment (G × E) interactions between lifetime occupational Pb exposure and 11 tagSNPs within ALAD in black (N = 260) and white (N = 343) prostate cancer cases.  Results:   Two ALAD tagSNPs in high linkage disequilibrium showed significant interaction with high Pb exposure among black cases (rs818684 interaction odds ratio or IOR = 2.73, 95% CI 1.43-5.22, P = 0.002; rs818689 IOR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.15-4.21, P = 0.017) and an additional tagSNP, rs2761016, showed G × E interaction with low Pb exposure (IOR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.84, P = 0.019). Further, the variant allele of rs818684 was associated with a higher Gleason grade in those with high Pb exposure among both blacks (OR 3.96, 95% CI 1.01-15.46, P = 0.048) and whites (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.18-7.39, P = 0.020).

We investigated whether impact + resistance training could stop ADT-related declines in bone mineral density (BMD) among PCS on ADT.  Methods:   We randomized 51 PCS (mean age, 70.2 yr) currently prescribed ADT to participate in 1 yr of impact + resistance training (Prevent Osteoporosis with Impact + Resistance (POWIR)) or in an exercise placebo program of stretching exercise (FLEX). Outcomes were proximal femur (total hip, femoral neck, and greater trochanter) and spine (L1-L4) BMD (g·cm) and bone turnover markers (serum osteocalcin (ng·mL) and urinary deoxypyrodinoline cross-links (nmol·mmol Cr)).  Results:   Retention in the 1-yr study was 84% and median attendance to supervised classes was 84% in POWIR and 74% in FLEX. No study-related injuries were reported. There were no significant differences between groups for average L1-L4 BMD or for BMD at any hip site. When examining individual vertebrae, POWIR has a significant effect on preservation of BMD (-0.4%) at the L4 vertebrae compared with losses (-3.1%) in FLEX (P = 0.03).  Conclusion:   Impact + resistance training was a safe and acceptable form of exercise for older PCS on ADT. Among our limited sample, POWIR did not appear to have a clinically meaningful effect on hip or spine BMD, but some evidence of skeletal adaptation to resistance + impact training in an androgen-deprived state was apparent. Future studies need to be conducted on a larger sample of patients and should consider modifications to POWIR that could further enhance loading across the spine and at the hip to preserve BMD at these clinically relevant sites.""","""['Kerri M Winters-Stone', 'Jessica C Dobek', 'Jill A Bennett', 'Gianni F Maddalozzo', 'Christopher W Ryan', 'Tomasz M Beer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Sci Sports Exerc""","""['Impact + resistance training improves bone health and body composition in prematurely menopausal breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Efficacy of recreational football on bone health, body composition, and physical functioning in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy: 32-week follow-up of the FC prostate randomised controlled trial.', 'Exercise effects on hip bone mineral density in older, post-menopausal breast cancer survivors are age dependent.', 'Osteoporosis in men with prostate carcinoma receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: recommendations for diagnosis and therapies.', 'Effect of Diphosphonates on Bone Mineral Density in Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Exercise and Bone Health in Cancer: Enemy or Ally?', 'Fracture Risk Among Older Cancer Survivors Compared With Older Adults Without a History of Cancer.', 'Effects of a multicomponent resistance-based exercise program with protein, vitamin D and calcium supplementation on cognition in men with prostate cancer treated with ADT: secondary analysis of a 12-month randomised controlled trial.', 'Weight loss for overweight and obese patients with prostate cancer: a study protocol of a randomised trial comparing clinic-based versus Telehealth delivered EXercise and nutrition intervention (the TelEX trial).', 'Quality of Life of Prostate Cancer Survivors Participating in a Remotely Delivered Web-Based Behavioral Intervention Pilot Randomized Trial.']"""

Standard radiological methods:   Modalities include conventional x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound as well as positron emission tomography (PET)-CT and MRI-PET.  Performance:   In whole body imaging CT has a high sensitivity for tumor entities which frequently present as a metastasized cancer illness. According to the current literature CT is diagnostic in 86% of patients with pancreatic carcinoma, in 36% of patients with colon carcinoma and in 74% of patients with lung carcinoma. Additionally a meta-analysis showed that for patients with squamous cell carcinoma and cervical lymph node metastases a positive diagnosis was possible in 22% of the cases using CT, in 36% using MRI and in 28-57% using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT ((18)F-FDG PET-CT). In addition, MRI plays an important role in the localization of primary occult tumors (e.g. breast and prostate) because of its high soft tissue contrast and options for functional imaging.  Achievements:   At the beginning of the diagnostic algorithm stands the search for a possible primary tumor and CT of the neck, thorax and abdomen is most frequently used for whole body staging. Subsequent organ-specific imaging examinations follow, e.g. mammography in women with axillary lymphadenopathy. For histological and immunohistochemical characterization of tumor tissue, imaging is also applied to identify the most accessible and representative tumor manifestation for biopsy. Tumor biopsy may be guided by CT, MRI or ultrasound and MRI also plays a central role in the localization of primary occult tumors because of superior soft tissue contrast and options for functional imaging (perfusion, diffusion), e.g. investigation of breast carcinoma or prostate carcinoma.  Practical recommendations:   Whole body staging stands at the beginning of the diagnostic algorithm in CUP syndrome to localize a potential primary tumor.

The objective was to demonstrate that PCA3D provides better specificity than PCA3 in predicting initial prostate biopsy outcome.  Methods:   Serum and urine samples were obtained from 595 consecutive patients scheduled for initial prostate biopsy. The urinary PCA3 test was performed before biopsy. Additional measures were prostate volume, PSA density (PSAD) and PCA3D. Multivariate logistic regression models including baseline characteristics and the markers were evaluated. The presumed net benefit was assessed through decision curve analyses.  Results:   PSAD and PCA3D performed better than PSA and PCA3 score, respectively. PCA3D provided the best specificity (76 %). The best calculated cutoff for PCA3D was 1. The risk of positive biopsy significantly increased to 70 % if PCA3D ≥ 1 versus 29 % if PCA3D was <1. Using a cutoff at 0.5 for PCA3D, biopsies could have been avoided in up to 52 % of the patients without PCa while missing 15 % of any PCa and 10 % of PCa with Gleason score ≥7. Decision curve analyses showed that PSAD was the best predictor of Gleason score at biopsy while PCA3D best predicted the proportion of invaded cores.  Conclusions:   PCA3D showed a significant increase in specificity when compared with PSA, PSAD and PCA3.

The evaluation was done based on two types of tumor tissues (breast and prostate) and two extraction protocols. The comparison of the 2-D patterns of FFPE extracts obtained by two extraction protocols with the matching frozen tissue extracts showed that only 7-10% of proteins from frozen tissues can be matched to proteins from FFPE tissues. Most of the spots in the 2-D FFPE's maps had pl 4-6, while the percentages of proteins with pl above 6 were 3-5 times lower in comparison to the fresh/frozen tissue. Despite the three-fold lower number of the detected spots in FFPE maps compared to matched fresh/frozen maps, 67-78% of protein spots in FFPE could not be matched to the corresponding spots in the fresh/frozen tissue maps indicating irreversible protein modifications.

Reduction or loss of MST1 expression is implicated in poor cancer prognosis. However, the mechanism leading to MST1 silencing remains elusive. Here, we report that both MYC and EZH2 function as potent suppressors of MST1 expression in human prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated that concurrent overexpression of MYC and EZH2 correlated with the reduction or loss of MST1 expression, as shown by RT-qPCR and immunoblotting. Methylation sensitive PCR and bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing showed that DNA methylation caused MST1 silencing. Pharmacologic and RNAi experiments revealed that MYC and EZH2 silenced MST1 expression by inhibiting its promoter activity, and that EZH2 was a mediator of the MYC-induced silencing of MST1. In addition, MYC contributed to MST1 silencing by partly inhibiting the expression of microRNA-26a/b, a negative regulator of EZH2. As shown by ChIP assays, EZH2-induced DNA methylation and H3K27me3 modification, which was accompanied by a reduced H3K4me3 mark and RNA polymerase II occupancy on the MST1 promoter CpG region, were the underlying cause of MST1 silencing. Moreover, potent pharmacologic inhibitors of MYC or EZH2 suppressed prostate cancer cell growth in vitro, and the knockdown of MST1 caused cells' resistance to MYC and EZH2 inhibitor-induced growth retardation. These findings indicate that MYC, in concert with EZH2, epigenetically attenuates MST1 expression and suggest that the loss of MST1/Hippo functions is critical for the MYC or EZH2 mediation of cancer cell survival.""","""['Gamze Kuser-Abali', 'Ahmet Alptekin', 'Bekir Cinar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['EZH2 dependent H3K27me3 is involved in epigenetic silencing of ID4 in prostate cancer.', 'Yin Yang 1-mediated epigenetic silencing of tumour-suppressive microRNAs activates nuclear factor-κB in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The EZH2- H3K27me3-DNMT1 complex orchestrates epigenetic silencing of the wwc1 gene, a Hippo/YAP pathway upstream effector, in breast cancer epithelial cells.', 'Mutations and deletions of PRC2 in prostate cancer.', 'EZH2, an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer.', 'UHRF1/UBE2L6/UBR4-mediated ubiquitination regulates EZH2 abundance and thereby melanocytic differentiation phenotypes in melanoma.', 'Polyploid giant cancer cells, EZH2 and Myc upregulation in mammary epithelial cells infected with high-risk human cytomegalovirus.', 'The Hippo pathway: an emerging role in urologic cancers.', 'Hippo pathway: Regulation, deregulation and potential therapeutic targets in cancer.', ""Targeting the Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer: What's New?""]"""

Methods:   From January 2006 to March 2013, the 413 patients of prostate cancer who received radical prostatectomy (RP) and their clinical and pathological data had been collected. The median age for the entire cohort was 68 years, which ranged from 48 to 78 years. All patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer before surgery and the Gleason score ranged from 4 to 10 (median 7). Anthropometric measures of abdominal adiposity including anterior abdominal fat, posterior abdominal fat and anteroposterior diameter were measured from the T2 weighted sagittal localization images of MRI scans and subcutaneous adipose tissue and the percentage of visceral adipose tissue were calculated. The patients' clinical and pathologic characteristics across BMI groups were compared used Student's t test for continuous variables or chi-squared test for categorical variables. Moreover, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to address the influence of anthropometric measures of obesity on pathological outcomes.  Results:   The BMI ranged from 14.2 to 34.0 kg/m(2) and the median value was 23.8 kg/m(2). The abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue ranged from 12.6 to 60.3 mm and the median value was 31.4 mm. The percentage of visceral adipose tissue ranged from 71.1% to 92.1% and the median value was 83.8%. In RP specimens, Gleason score ≥ 8 was observed in 141 patients (34.1%), pathological tumor stage was T3a in 69 patients (16.7%) and pathological tumor stage was T3b in 78 patients (18.9%). Positive surgical margin and lymph node involvement were observed in 71(17.2%) and 38(9.2%) patients, respectively. Although univariate analysis showed that BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) was associated with pathological Gleason score ≥ 8 (OR = 1.413, P = 0.035), this positive correlation disappeared in multivariate analysis(P = 0.095). In multivariate analysis, the percentage of visceral adipose tissue was significantly associated with pathological Gleason score (OR = 9.618, P = 0.000), extracapsular extension (OR = 6.750, P = 0.002) and seminal vesicle invasion (OR = 4.419, P = 0.007) after adjusting for patient age, PSA level, clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score.

Non-metastatic PC cases are categorized as low-risk (LR), intermediate-risk (IR) or high-risk (HR) groups based on pretreatment PSA, tumor stage, and Gleason score per 2002 NCCN guidelines.

While too much sunlight exposure causes skin cancer, it is the major source of vitamin D from skin. We propose that these processes can be balanced. Vitamin D signalling (VDS) protects against skin cancer as demonstrated by the susceptibility of the skin to tumor formation in VDR null mice and protection from UVB-induced mutations when VDR agonists are administered. The question is how is protection afforded. Previously, we have focused on the Wnt/β-catenin/hedgehog and DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways. As VDR regulates hundreds of genes with thousands of VDR response elements (VDRE) throughout the genome, and many VDREs are in non-coding regions, we decided to explore long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA). LncRNAs are mRNA-like transcripts ranging from 200 bases ~100 kb lacking significant open reading frames. They are aberrantly expressed in human cancers and involved in a spectrum of tumorigenic/metastatic processes (cell proliferation/apoptosis/angiogenesis). We discovered that VDS regulated the expression of certain lncRNAs in a manner consistent with VDS protection against skin cancer. Given the huge variation in genes actively regulated by 1,25(OH)2 D from different cell types, it is conceivable that our results could apply to personalized medicine based on the distinctive lncRNA profiles. These lncRNAs could also serve as skin cancer biomarkers secreted into the blood or urine via exosomes as demonstrated in other cancer types (breast, prostate).

The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of RARP in this setting.  Patients and methods:   Overall, 1,512 patients with high-risk PCa within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End RESULTS (SEER) Medicare-linked database diagnosed between 2008 and 2009 were abstracted.

Propensity-score matched analyses and logistic regression models fitted with generalized estimating equations for clustering among hospitals were performed.  Results:   Overall, 706 (46.7%) and 806 (53.3%) patients underwent ORP and RARP, respectively. Following propensity-matched analyses, 706 patients remained. No differences were observed in complications (P=0.6), positive surgical margins (P=0.4), or additional therapy after surgery (P=0.2) between patients treated with RARP and ORP; however, RARP was associated with lower rates of transfusions and shorter hospitalization (all P<0.001). In multivariable analyses, patients undergoing RARP were less likely to receive a blood transfusion (P=0.002) or to experience pLOS (P<0.001) compared with men treated with ORP.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of HOX genes in prostate cancer and to establish whether prostate cancer cells are sensitive to killing by HXR9, an inhibitor of HOX function.  Methods:   HOX function was inhibited using the HXR9 peptide. HOX gene expression was assessed by RNA extraction from cells or tissues followed by quantitative PCR, and siRNA was used to block the expression of the HOX target gene, cFos. In vivo modelling involved a mouse flank tumour induced by inoculation with LNCaP cells.  Results:   In this study we show that the expression of HOX genes in prostate tumours is greatly increased with respect to normal prostate tissue. Targeting the interaction between HOX proteins and their PBX cofactor induces apoptosis in the prostate cancer derived cell lines PC3, DU145 and LNCaP, through a mechanism that involves a rapid increase in the expression of cFos, an oncogenic transcription factor.

Case-control studies have been performed to elucidate the role of T3801C in cancer, although the results are conflicting and heterogeneous. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between cancer susceptibility and T3801C (55,963 cases and 76,631 controls from 268 studies) polymorphism in different inheritance models.We used odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to assess the strength of the association. Overall, significantly increased cancer risk was observed in any genetic model (dominant model: odds ratio [OR]=1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.09–1.19; recessive model: OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.12–1.34; CC vs. TT: OR=1.31, 95% CI=1.19–1.45; TC vs. TT: OR=1.12, 95% CI=1.07–1.18; additive model: OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.09–1.19) when all eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. In further stratified and sensitivity analyses, the elevated risk remained for subgroups of cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer. In addition, significantly decreased colorectal cancer risk was also observed. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that the participation of CYP1A1 T3801C is a genetic susceptibility for some cancer types.Moreover, our work also points out the importance of new studies for T3801C association in some cancer types, such as gallbladder cancer, Asians of acute myeloid leukemia, and thyroid cancer, where at least some of the covariates responsible for heterogeneity could be controlled, to obtain a more conclusive understanding about the function of the CYP1A1 T3801C polymorphism in cancer development.""","""['Xiao-Feng He', 'Wu Wei', 'Zhi-Zhong Liu', 'Xu-Liang Shen', 'Xian-Bin Yang', 'Su-Lan Wang', 'Dao-Lin Xie']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Evaluation of association studies and a systematic review and meta-analysis of CYP1A1 T3801C and A2455G polymorphisms in breast cancer risk.', 'Lack of significant association between CYP1A1 T3801C polymorphism and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis involving 25,087 subjects.', 'Significant association between CYP1A1 T3801C polymorphism and cervical neoplasia risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association between the CYP1A1 A2455G polymorphism and risk of cancer: evidence from 272 case-control studies.', 'CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism is associated with prostate cancer susceptibility: evidence from a meta-analysis.', 'Association between the CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism and risk of head and neck cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Evaluation of association studies and a systematic review and meta-analysis of CYP1A1 T3801C and A2455G polymorphisms in breast cancer risk.', 'CYP1A1, CYP2E1 and EPHX1 polymorphisms in sporadic colorectal neoplasms.', 'Cigarette smoking, dietary habits and genetic polymorphisms in GSTT1, GSTM1 and CYP1A1 metabolic genes: A case-control study in oncohematological diseases.', 'The association of CYP1A1 genetic polymorphisms and additional gene-gene interaction with ischemic stroke in the eastern Han of China.']"""

The colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling pathway drives the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to the neoplastic microenvironment and promotes the differentiation of TAMs toward a pro-tumorigenic phenotype. Twelve clinical trials are currently evaluating agents that target the CSF1/CSF1R signaling pathway as a treatment against multiple malignancies, including breast carcinoma, leukemia, and glioblastoma. The blockade of CSF1R signaling has been shown to greatly decrease the number of macrophages in a tissue-specific manner. However, additional mechanistic insights are needed in order to understand how macrophages are depleted and the global effects of CSF1R inhibition on other tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Using BLZ945, a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of CSF1R, we show that CSF1R inhibition attenuates the turnover rate of TAMs while increasing the number of CD8+ T cells that infiltrate cervical and breast carcinomas. Specifically, we find that BLZ945 decreased the growth of malignant cells in the mouse mammary tumor virus-driven polyomavirus middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) model of mammary carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we show that BLZ945 prevents tumor progression in the keratin 14-expressing human papillomavirus type 16 (K14-HPV-16) transgenic model of cervical carcinogenesis.

We previously reported that REIC/Dkk-3-expressing adenovirus vector (Ad-REIC) induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cancer-specific apoptosis in human prostate cancer. In this study, we examined the therapeutic impact of Ad-REIC on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Materials and methods:   We examined the anti-tumor effect of Ad-REIC on 25 NSCLC cell lines in vitro and A549 cells in vivo. Two of these cell lines were artificially established as EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistant sublines.  Results:   Ad-REIC-treatment inhibited the cell viability by 40% or more in 13 (52%) of the 25 cell lines at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 (20 MOI). These cell lines were regarded as being highly sensitive cells. The cell viability of a non-malignant immortalized cell line, OUMS-24, was not inhibited at 200 MOI of Ad-REIC. The effects of Ad-REIC on EGFR-TKI resistant sublines were equivalent to those in the parental cell lines. Here, we demonstrated that Ad-REIC treatment activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in NSCLC cell lines, indicating the induction of ER stress with GRP78/BiP (GRP78) up-regulation and resulting in apoptosis. A single intratumoral injection of Ad-REIC significantly inhibited the tumorigenic growth of A549 cells in vivo. As predictive factors of sensitivity for Ad-REIC treatment in NSCLC, we examined the expression status of GRP78 and coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). We found that the combination of the GRP78 and CAR expressional statuses may be used as a predictive factor for Ad-REIC sensitivity in NSCLC cells.

Confocal microscopy demonstrated structural disruption of both focal adhesions and tight junctions by the downregulation of these gene targets, resulting in decreased cell survival, migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) components in two androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145. Stabilization of cell-ECM interactions by overexpression of talin-1 and/or exposing cells to a fibronectin-rich environment mitigated the effect of DZ-50. Loss of expression of the intracellular focal adhesion signaling effectors talin-1 and integrin linked kinase (ILK) sensitized human prostate cancer to anoikis.

The mechanisms regulating the expression of ECE-1 in cancer cells are poorly understood, hampering the development of novel therapies targeting the endothelin axis. Here we provide evidence that the expression of ECE-1 is markedly inhibited by its 3'UTR, and that alternative polyadenylation (APA) results in the production of ECE-1 transcripts with truncated 3'UTRs which promote elevated protein expression. Abolition of the ECE-1 APA sites reduced protein expression from a reporter vector in prostate cancer cells, suggesting these sites are functional.

We provide a comprehensive annotation of the 77 known risk loci, based upon highly correlated variants in biologically relevant chromatin annotations--we identified 727 such potentially functional SNPs. We also provide a detailed account of possible protein disruption, microRNA target sequence disruption and regulatory response element disruption of all correlated SNPs at r(2) ≥ 0.88%. 88% of the 727 SNPs fall within putative enhancers, and many alter critical residues in the response elements of transcription factors known to be involved in prostate biology. We define as risk enhancers those regions with enhancer chromatin biofeatures in prostate-derived cell lines with prostate-cancer correlated SNPs. To aid the identification of these enhancers, we performed genomewide ChIP-seq for H3K27-acetylation, a mark of actively engaged enhancers, as well as the transcription factor TCF7L2. We analyzed in depth three variants in risk enhancers, two of which show significantly altered androgen sensitivity in LNCaP cells.

Rs4907792 is within a critical residue of a strong consensus androgen response element that is interrupted in the protective allele, resulting in a 56% decrease in its androgen sensitivity, whereas rs10486567 affects both NKX3-1 and FOXA-AR motifs where the risk allele results in a 39% increase in basal activity and a 28% fold-increase in androgen stimulated enhancer activity.

In vivo, AMPK activation is sufficient to reduce PCa growth, whereas the allelic loss of its catalytic subunits fosters PCa development. Importantly, despite mTORC1 blockade, the suppression of de novo lipogenesis is the underpinning mechanism responsible for AMPK-mediated PCa growth inhibition, suggesting AMPK as a therapeutic target especially for lipogenesis-driven PCas.

The prepared DTX-PMs had an average particle size of 25.19±2.36 nm, a zeta potential of 0.64±0.15 mV, a polydispersity index of 0.56±0.03, a drug loading of (8.72±1.05)%, and an encapsulation efficiency of (98.1±8.4)%. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that DTX-PMs could effectively kill LNCap-C4-2B cells and show a dose- and time-dependent efficacy. The hemolysis test showed that DTX-PMs had less hemocytolysis than the commercial product of Duopafei®. A sustained in vitro release behavior and prolonged circulation time in blood vessels were observed in the DTX-PMs. Furthermore, when compared with Duopafei®, the DTX-PMs dramatically reduced the prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and tumor growth of prostate tumor-bearing nude mice in vivo.

This method provides an alternative, accessible surveillance method in the absence of linked individual-level information to extend the work of others by providing both national and subnational standardized, hence comparable, results to address this issue.  Methods:   Canadian Cancer Registry data (2001 to 2006) and 2006 Census data provided dissemination area information regarding the concentration of the foreign-born population and population estimates for rate denominators. Cancer (all cause and cause-specific) incidence rate ratios (age-standardized and by age/sex) were calculated by foreign-born concentration areas at both national and regional levels.  Results:   An inverse gradient was identified between cancer incidence rates and area concentration of foreign-born, with the all-sites cancer rate ranging from a low of 388 per 100,000 among individuals living in areas with a high concentration of foreign-born to a high of 493 per 100,000 among individuals living in areas with a low concentration of foreign-born. This pattern occurred nationally for lung, colorectal, prostate and female breast cancers. However, for liver, nasopharynx, and thyroid cancers, higher cancer rates were observed in areas with a higher versus lower concentration of foreign-born populations.  Conclusion:   The study findings provide suggestive evidence of decreased cancer risk among foreign-born populations for most cancers except nasopharynx, liver and thyroid for which risks were higher.

In this study we compare the toxicity and biochemical progression-free survival between patients treated with daily image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) and 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) without daily image guidance for high risk prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   A total of 503 high risk PCa patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) and endocrine treatment between 2000 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. 115 patients were treated with 3DCRT, and 388 patients were treated with IG-IMRT. 3DCRT patients were treated to 76 Gy and without daily image guidance and with 1-2 cm PTV margins. IG-IMRT patients were treated to 78 Gy based on daily image guidance of fiducial markers, and the PTV margins were 5-7 mm. Furthermore, the dose-volume constraints to both the rectum and bladder were changed with the introduction of IG-IMRT.  Results:   The 2-year actuarial likelihood of developing grade > = 2 GI toxicity following RT was 57.3% in 3DCRT patients and 5.8% in IG-IMRT patients (p < 0.001). For GU toxicity the numbers were 41.8% and 29.7%, respectively (p = 0.011). On multivariate analysis, 3DCRT was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing grade > = 2 GI toxicity compared to IG-IMRT (p < 0.001, HR = 11.59 [CI: 6.67-20.14]). 3DCRT was also associated with an increased risk of developing GU toxicity compared to IG-IMRT.The 3-year actuarial biochemical progression-free survival probability was 86.0% for 3DCRT and 90.3% for IG-IMRT (p = 0.386). On multivariate analysis there was no difference in biochemical progression-free survival between 3DCRT and IG-IMRT.

Weekly docetaxel (DPq1w) is often favored over the standard three-weekly regimen (DPq3w) due to concerns about safety and tolerability in this population.  Materials and methods:   Two subgroup analyses of TAX 327 were conducted. Among patients receiving DPq3w, tolerability and efficacy were compared between three age groups: <65, 65-74 and ≥75 years. For men ≥75 years, these outcomes were compared between DPq3w, DPq1w, and mitoxantrone (MP) arms. Tolerability outcomes included dose delivery, grade 3/4 adverse events and quality of life. Efficacy outcomes included overall survival and tumor response.  Results:   Of 1006 men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the trial, 335 received DPq3w. Among these, 20% were age ≥75 years. For DPq3w, there were non-significant associations of worse tolerability and efficacy with advancing age. Twenty-eight percent of men age ≥75 years had an objective pain response, compared to 38% and 34% of patients 65-74 and <65 years, respectively. There were no significant differences in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (43-48%, p = 0.74) or measurable tumor response (7-17%, p = 0.30) according to age. Among men ≥75 years, DPq3w resulted in more dose reductions than DPq1w (22% versus 8%, p = 0.007), but tolerability was otherwise comparable. Both were associated with more favorable efficacy than mitoxantrone.  Conclusions:   Tolerability and efficacy of DPq3w appear less favorable with advancing age. Compared to DPq1w, DPq3w is associated with better survival outcomes, but similar tolerability, and remains the standard first-line chemotherapy option in mCRPC.

Mailed surveys are well suited to study late-effects in this population, but low response rates can compromise survey validity. This study investigated whether an unconditional $5.00 gift certificate incentive or Priority Mail delivery increased prostate cancer survivors' response to mailed surveys.  Materials and methods:   976 participants (mean age = 66.8 years), 2-8 years post-diagnosis, were randomized to one of four groups: Incentive; Priority Mail; Incentive & Priority Mail; or Control. After an introductory letter, initial study packets were mailed based on randomization; 46 days later, a second study packet was mailed to all non-responders by First-Class Mail.  Results:   The first mailing yielded a significant variation in response rates across groups (χ(2) = 9.34; p = 0.025). Priority Mail (64.7%; p = 0.008) and Incentive & Priority Mail (63.6%; p = 0.016) groups had significantly higher response rates than Controls (52.9%). After the second mailing, the overall response rate increased significantly from 59.6% to 71.4% (p < 0.001); however, response rates no longer differed across groups (range, 69.3% [Incentive group] to 73.9% [Priority Mail group]).  Conclusions:   Long-term prostate cancer survivors' response rates to mailed surveys increased with the use of Priority Mail and a repeat survey mailing, but the unconditional gift certificate incentive was not supported in this population.

Objective:   To examine the impact of ADT on AKI in a large contemporary cohort of patients with nonmetastatic PCa representing the US population.  Design, setting, and participants:   Overall, 69 292 patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic PCa between 1995 and 2009 were abstracted from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database.  Outcomes measurements and statistical analyses:   Patient in both treatment arms (ADT vs. no ADT) were matched using propensity-score methodology. Ten-year AKI rates were estimated. Competing-risks regression analyses tested the association between ADT and AKI, after adjusting for the risk of death during follow-up.  Results and limitations:   Overall, the 10-yr AKI rates were 24.9% versus 30.7% for ADT-naive patients versus those treated with ADT, respectively (p<0.001). When patients were stratified according to the type of ADT, the 10-yr AKI rates were 31.1% versus 26.0% for men treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and bilateral orchiectomy, respectively (p<0.001). In multivariable analyses, the administration of GnRH agonists (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.31; p<0.001), but not bilateral orchiectomy (HR: 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96-1.29; p=0.1), was associated with the risk of experiencing AKI. Our study is limited by its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   ADT is associated with an increased risk of AKI in patients with nonmetastatic PCa. In particular, the administration of GnRH agonists, but not surgical castration, may substantially increase the risk of experiencing AKI. These observations should help provide physicians with better patient selection to reduce the risk of AKI.

We have previously demonstrated that structurally flexible triethanolamine (TEA) core poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers of high generations are effective nanovectors for siRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we have developed arginine-terminated dendrimers with the aim of combining and harnessing the unique siRNA delivery properties of the TEA-core PAMAM dendrimer and the cell-penetrating advantages of the arginine-rich motif. A generation 4 dendrimer of this family (G4Arg) formed stable dendriplexes with siRNA, leading to improved cell uptake of siRNA by comparison with its nonarginine bearing dendrimer counterpart. Moreover, G4Arg was demonstrated to be an excellent nanocarrier for siRNA delivery, yielding potent gene silencing and anticancer effects in prostate cancer models both in vitro and in vivo with no discernible toxicity. Consequently, importing an arginine residue on the surface of a dendrimer is an appealing option to improve delivery efficiency, and at the same time, the dendrimer G4Arg constitutes a highly promising nanovector for efficacious siRNA delivery and holds great potential for further therapeutic applications.""","""['Cheng Liu', 'Xiaoxuan Liu', 'Palma Rocchi', 'Fanqi Qu', 'Juan L Iovanna', 'Ling Peng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Dendrimer Nanovectors for SiRNA Delivery.', 'Structurally flexible triethanolamine-core poly(amidoamine) dendrimers as effective nanovectors to deliver RNAi-based therapeutics.', 'Impact of siRNA overhangs for dendrimer-mediated siRNA delivery and gene silencing.', 'PAMAM dendrimer-based multifunctional conjugate for cancer therapy: synthesis, characterization, and functionality.', 'Poly (amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer mediated delivery of drug and pDNA/siRNA for cancer therapy.', 'Membrane Internalization Mechanisms and Design Strategies of Arginine-Rich Cell-Penetrating Peptides.', 'Lysine-based dendrimer with double arginine residues.', 'PAMAM versus PEI complexation for siRNA delivery: interaction with model lipid membranes and cellular uptake.', 'Dendrimers as Non-Viral Vectors in Gene-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy.', 'Peptide-Assisted Nucleic Acid Delivery Systems on the Rise.']"""

Results:   The overall sensitivity of self-report cancer was 71.1%, and sensitivities showed great variation by cancer site. Higher sensitivities were observed for breast (90.7%), bowel (77.8%) and prostate (77.1%) cancers, whereas the lowest sensitivity was observed for melanoma of the skin (36.9%). Similarly, the kappa coefficient analysis showed substantial agreement for self-reported breast cancer (ĸ=0.79) and moderate agreement for melanoma (ĸ=0.45) against the ACD. Years since cancer diagnosis and older age were associated with false negative reporting and older age was associated with false positive reporting.  Conclusions and implications:   The use of self-reported cancer to collect cancer outcomes has varying reliability, depending on cancer type and population.

Methods:   A population-based record linkage study of 75,482 adult clients residing in New South Wales (NSW) from 2000 to 2007; median age 75 years (interquartile range, 68-79); 57% male. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and mortality ratios (SMRs) for any cancer and by cancer type were calculated, relative to the NSW population.  Results:   The risk of any cancer was slightly increased for males (SIR 1.07, 95%CI 1.04-1.10) but not females (SIR 1.00, 95%CI 0.96-1.04). Males exhibited a significantly elevated risk of prostate cancer (SIR 1.08), cutaneous melanoma (SIR 1.19), head and neck cancer (SIR 1.27) and connective tissue cancer (SIR 1.52). Females did not exhibit excess risk for any cancer type. Risk of cancer death was significantly reduced for any cancer (male SMR 0.78, 95%CI 0.75-0.81; female SMR 0.80, 95%CI 0.76-0.85) and for a range of haematopoietic and solid neoplasms including prostate (SMR 0.57), breast (SMR 0.62) and colon cancer (male SMR 0.67; female SMR 0.71).  Conclusion:   Cancer incidence rates are largely similar, and mortality rates moderately lower, for DVA clients compared to the NSW general population.  Implications:   These risk patterns may reflect service-related history, a healthy-survivor effect, competing risk of death, and/or comprehensive health care entitlements with minimal to no co-payments. Our findings suggest DVA clients are probably accessing cancer screening services.

Methods:   A small interfering RNA was used to knockdown SOX9 expression in a PCa cell line and to analyze the effects of SOX9 inhibition on the expression of HIVEP3 in vitro. Then, HIVEP3 and SOX9 expression patterns in the human PCa tissues were detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   We found that the downregulation of SOX9 could inhibit the expression of HIVEP3 in the PCa cells in vitro. In addition, both HIVEP3 and SOX9 messenger RNA expression levels in the PCa tissues were significantly higher than those in the noncancerous prostate tissues (P=0.006 and P<0.001, respectively). Moreover, the immunohistochemical staining scores of HIVEP3 in the PCa tissues with PSA failure were significantly higher than those without (P=0.042); the increased SOX9 protein expression was more frequently found in the PCa tissues with a high Gleason score (P=0.045) and a high clinical stage (P=0.012). The tumors showing the HIVEP3-high/SOX9-high expression more frequently had PSA failure (P=0.024). When the patients with an HIVEP3 overexpression combined with the SOX9 overexpression, this group had a worse biochemical recurrence-free survival (P<0.001). Furthermore, the multivariate analysis showed that the HIVEP3/SOX9 coexpression was an independent predictor of an unfavorable biochemical recurrence-free survival.  Conclusion:   Our data offer the convincing evidence for the first time that a combined analysis of HIVEP3 and SOX9 may help to predict the tumor progression and prognosis of PCa patients.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP; SREBP-1 and SREBP-2) are key transcription factors controlling lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis via the regulation of genes related to fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Overexpression of SREBPs has been reported to be significantly associated with aggressive pathologic features in human prostate cancer. Our previous results showed that SREBP-1 promoted prostate cancer growth and castration resistance through induction of lipogenesis and androgen receptor (AR) activity. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-prostate tumor activity of a novel SREBP inhibitor, fatostatin. We found that fatostatin suppressed cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation in both androgen-responsive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells. Fatostatin also reduced in vitro invasion and migration in both the cell lines. Further, fatostatin caused G2-M cell-cycle arrest and induced apoptosis by increasing caspase-3/7 activity and the cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP. The in vivo animal results demonstrated that fatostatin significantly inhibited subcutaneous C4-2B tumor growth and markedly decreased serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level compared with the control group. The in vitro and in vivo effects of fatostatin treatment were due to blockade of SREBP-regulated metabolic pathways and the AR signaling network.

The aim of this study is to examine the dyadic effects of coping strategies on the emotional state and QoL of couples dealing with cancer.  Methods:   Ninety-nine couples completed various self-questionnaires to assess psychological and physical QoL, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and coping strategies at the beginning, middle, and end of primary treatment.  Results:   Results obtained with the actor-partner interdependence model showed that coping strategies used by patients or spouses play a key role not only in their own well-being but also in their partners'. Indeed, when patients use problem-focused coping or social support-seeking, they, as well as their spouses, experience fewer anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conversely, patients or spouses who use emotion-focused coping experience higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Finally, and it is a surprising result, when spouses seek social support, patients feel greater anxiety.

The individual genetic loss of the metastasis suppressor, SSeCKS/Gravin/AKAP12 or Rb, genes that are downregulated or deleted in human prostate cancer, results in prostatic hyperplasia. Here, we show that the combined loss of Akap12 and Rb results in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) that fails to progress to malignancy after 18 months. Strikingly, 83% of mice with PIN lesions exhibited metastases to draining lymph nodes, marked by relatively differentiated tumor cells expressing markers of basal (p63, cytokeratin 14) and luminal (cytokeratin 8 and androgen receptor) epithelial cells, although none expressed the basal marker, cytokeratin 5. The finding that PIN lesions contain increased numbers of p63/AR-positive, cytokeratin 5-negative basal cells compared with WT or Akap12-/- prostate lobes suggests that these transitional cells may be the source of the lymph node metastases.

Therefore, we identified the relationships between polymorphisms in CYP24A1 and prostate cancer in a Korean cohort.  Methods:   We evaluated the association between 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP24A1 and prostate cancer in Korean men (272 prostate cancers and 173 controls). BPH patients with high PSA or abnormal digital rectal examination who underwent negative prostate biopsy were enrolled in the control group. Twenty-one SNPs in the CYP24A1 were selected from the International HapMap database and the NCBI database with calculation of minor allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium, preferably including the SNPs that were nonsynonymous and located within exons. We also investigated the association between 21 SNPs in the CYP24A1 gene and known clinical characteristics, such as the PSA level, clinical stage, pathological stage and Gleason score.  Results:   The statistical analysis suggested that five CYP24A1 sequence variants (rs2248461-odds ratio (OR): 0.63, rs2248359-OR: 0.65, rs6022999-OR: 0.65, rs2585428-OR: 0.46, rs4809959-OR: 0.52) had a significant association with prostate cancer risk after multiple comparisons by a method of false discovery rate. Logistic analyses of the CYP24A1 polymorphisms with several prostate cancer-related factors showed that several SNPs were significant: four SNPs to PSA level, three to clinical stage, two to pathological stage and two SNPs to the Gleason score.  Conclusions:   The results of this study suggest that some CYP24A1 gene polymorphisms might be associated with the risk of prostate cancer in Korean men.

The USDA approval of DNA vaccines for several non-human diseases underscores the potential of this type of antigen delivery method as a cost-effective approach for the treatment or prevention of human diseases, including cancer. However, while DNA vaccines have demonstrated safety and immunological effect in early phase clinical trials, they have not consistently elicited robust anti-tumor responses. Hence many recent efforts have sought to increase the immunological efficacy of DNA vaccines, and we have specifically evaluated several target antigens encoded by DNA vaccine as treatments for human prostate cancer. In particular, we have focused on SSX2 as one potential target antigen, given its frequent expression in metastatic prostate cancer. We have previously identified two peptides, p41-49 and p103-111, as HLA-A2-restricted SSX2-specific epitopes. In the present study we sought to determine whether the efficacy of a DNA vaccine could be enhanced by an altered peptide ligand (APL) strategy wherein modifications were made to anchor residues of these epitopes to enhance or ablate their binding to HLA-A2. A DNA vaccine encoding APL modified to increase epitope binding elicited robust peptide-specific CD8+ T cells producing Th1 cytokines specific for each epitope. Ablation of one epitope in a DNA vaccine did not enhance immune responses to the other epitope. These results demonstrate that APL encoded by a DNA vaccine can be used to elicit increased numbers of antigen-specific T cells specific for multiple epitopes simultaneously, and suggest this could be a general approach to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines encoding tumor antigens.""","""['Heath A Smith', 'Brian T Rekoske', 'Douglas G McNeel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Vaccine""","""['Vaccines targeting the cancer-testis antigen SSX-2 elicit HLA-A2 epitope-specific cytolytic T cells.', 'A peptide epitope derived from the cancer testis antigen HOM-MEL-40/SSX2 capable of inducing CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T-cell as well as B-cell responses.', 'HLA-A2-restricted T-cell epitopes specific for prostatic acid phosphatase.', 'The use of HLA class I tetramers to design a vaccination strategy for melanoma patients.', 'Design of multi-epitope, analogue-based cancer vaccines.', 'Cancer testis antigen subfamilies: Attractive targets for therapeutic vaccine (Review).', 'Novel TCR-like CAR-T cells targeting an HLA∗0201-restricted SSX2 epitope display strong activity against acute myeloid leukemia.', 'PD-1 and LAG-3 blockade improve anti-tumor vaccine efficacy.', 'Heterologous vaccination targeting prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) using DNA and Listeria vaccines elicits superior anti-tumor immunity dependent on CD4+ T cells elicited by DNA priming.', 'Trial watch: DNA-based vaccines for oncological indications.']"""

The results revealed that after 72 h of incubation the tested extract reduced the viability of DU 145 and MDA-MB-231 with IC50 equal to 14.5 μg/mL for both cell lines. In contrast, EPE did not inhibit the viability of normal prostate cells. Furthermore, EPE reduced PNT1A and MDA-MB-231 cell invasiveness; at the concentration of 21.75 μg/mL the suppression of invasion reached 92% and 47%, respectively (versus control). Additionally, zymographic analysis revealed that after 48 h of incubation EPE inhibited metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activities in a dose-dependent manner. For PNT1A the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 decreased 4- and 2-fold, respectively, at EPE concentration of 29 μg/mL. In the case of MDA-MB-231 and DU 145 the decrease in MMP-9 activity at EPE concentration of 29 μg/mL was 5.5-fold and almost 1.9-fold, respectively.

CRPC is also characterized by increased insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I responsiveness which induces prostate cancer survival and CLU expression. However, how IGF-I induces CLU expression and whether CLU is required for IGF-mediated growth signaling remain unknown. Here we show that IGF-I induced CLU via STAT3-Twist1 signaling pathway. In response to IGF-I, STAT3 was phosphorylated, translocated to the nucleus and bound to the Twist1 promoter to activate Twist1 transcription. In turn, Twist1 bound to E-boxes on the CLU promoter and activated CLU transcription. Inversely, we demonstrated that knocking down Twist1 abrogated IGF-I induced CLU expression, indicating that Twist1 mediated IGF-I-induced CLU expression. When PTEN knockout mice were crossed with lit/lit mice, the resultant IGF-I deficiency suppressed Twist1 as well as CLU gene expression in mouse prostate glands. Moreover, both Twist1 and CLU knockdown suppressed prostate cancer growth accelerated by IGF-I, suggesting the relevance of this signaling not only in an in vitro, but also in an in vivo.

This raises the possibility of cross-resistance between androgen-directed agents and docetaxel.  Objective:   To evaluate docetaxel efficacy after abiraterone treatment in CRPC patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a single-institution, retrospective analysis in CRPC patients (N=119) who either received abiraterone before docetaxel (AD) (n=24) or did not receive abiraterone before docetaxel (docetaxel-only; n=95). Men initiated docetaxel between December 2007 (the date abiraterone was first used at our center) and May 2013.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary efficacy end points were prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) and clinical/radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) on docetaxel. Differences between groups were assessed using univariate and multivariable analyses.  Results and limitations:   Men in the AD group had a significantly higher risk for progression than those in the docetaxel-only group. Median PSA-PFS was 4.1 mo in the AD group and 6.7 mo in the docetaxel-only group (p=0.002). Median PFS was also shorter in the AD group (4.4 mo vs 7.6 mo; p=0.003). In multivariable analysis, prior abiraterone treatment remained an independent predictor of shorter PSA-PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-8.94; p=0.01) and PFS (HR: 3.62; 95% CI, 1.41-9.27; p=0.008). PSA declines ≥50% were less frequent in the AD group (38% vs 63%; p=0.02). The small size and retrospective nature of this study may have introduced bias.  Conclusions:   Men receiving abiraterone before docetaxel were more likely to progress on docetaxel and less likely to achieve a PSA response than abiraterone-naïve patients. Cross-resistance between abiraterone and docetaxel may explain these findings; however, larger, more definitive studies are still needed to confirm this.  Patient summary:   We examined the efficacy of docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who either did or did not receive prior abiraterone. We found that men receiving abiraterone before docetaxel were less likely to achieve a PSA response and were more likely to progress sooner on docetaxel than abiraterone-untreated patients.

Results:   On average for three patients, the D35% for the bladder was 8% higher in plans based on MVCT images and 7% higher in plans based on hybrid images, compared to the plans based on kVCT images alone. Likewise, the D35% for the rectum was 3% higher than the kVCT based plan for both hybrid and MVCT plans.

However, activating mutations in the Nrf2 pathway have been found to promote tumorigenesis in certain models. Therefore, the role of Nrf2 in cancer remains contentious.  Methods:   We employed a well-characterized model of stepwise human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transformation and breast cancer cell lines to investigate oxidative stress and the role of Nrf2 during tumorigenesis. The Nrf2 pathway was studied by microarray analyses, qRT-PCR, and western-blotting. To assess the contribution of Nrf2 to transformation, we established tumor xenografts with transformed MSC expressing Nrf2 (n = 6 mice per group). Expression and survival data for Nrf2 in different cancers were obtained from GEO and TCGA databases. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   We found an accumulation of reactive oxygen species during MSC transformation that correlated with the transcriptional down-regulation of antioxidants and Nrf2-downstream genes. Nrf2 was repressed in transformed MSC and in breast cancer cells via oncogene-induced activation of the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway. Furthermore, restoration of Nrf2 function in transformed cells decreased reactive oxygen species and impaired in vivo tumor growth (P = 0.001) by mechanisms that included sensitization to apoptosis, and a decreased hypoxic/angiogenic response through HIF-1α destabilization and VEGFA repression. Microarray analyses showed down-regulation of Nrf2 in a panel of human tumors and, strikingly, low Nrf2 expression correlated with poorer survival in patients with melanoma (P = 0.0341), kidney (P = 0.0203) and prostate (P = 0.00279) cancers.

Individual gland units are segmented out by consolidating their lumina with the surrounding layers of epithelium and nuclei. The nuclei objects are segmented by using a marker controlled watershed algorithm. Two new features, Number of Nuclei Layer (N(NL)) and Ratio of Epithelial layer area to Lumen area (R(EL)) have been extracted from the segmented units. The main advantage of this approach is that it can detect individual malignant gland units, irrespective of neighboring histology and/or the spatial extent of the cancer.

The main objective of this work is to employ COrE to quantitatively model disorder of cell/nuclear orientation within local neighborhoods and evaluate whether these measurements of directional disorder are correlated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) in prostate cancer (CaP) patients. COrE has a number of novel attributes that are unique to digital pathology image analysis. Firstly, it is the first rigorous attempt to quantitatively model cell/nuclear orientation. Secondly, it provides for modeling of local cell networks via construction of subgraphs. Thirdly, it allows for quantifying the disorder in local cell orientation via second order statistical features. We evaluated the ability of 39 COrE features to capture the characteristics of cell orientation in CaP tissue microarray (TMA) images in order to predict 10 year BCR in men with CaP following radical prostatectomy. Randomized 3-fold cross-validation via a random forest classifier evaluated on a combination of COrE and other nuclear features achieved an accuracy of 82.7 +/- 3.1% on a dataset of 19 BCR and 20 non-recurrence patients.

We determined that Troglitazone and other members of the Thiazolidinedione family inhibit cell-surface directed lysosome trafficking and cathepsin B secretion through a Rab7-dependent mechanism. Moreover, Rab7 shRNA expressing cells were found to be more invasive in vitro and in vivo. Increased invasiveness was accompanied by elevated expression of the c-Met receptor and prolonged downstream signaling, thereby supporting a role for Rab7 as a mediator of signaling down-regulation.

However, a rising PSA usually announces disease progression long before any clinically apparent symptom. Thus, many men can be safely monitored with PSA measurement alone. To facilitate this process, PSA tracking software was introduced to remotely monitor PSA results, minimising the work required for follow-up.  Methods:   Stable prostate cancer patients were into the PSA tracker. When each PSA test was performed, the result was reviewed. The program automatically generated patient reminder letters, summary reports for clinic use and all correspondence to patients and primary care physicians.  Results:   Since 2006, 65 patients have been entered into the PSA tracker. Median age was 81 (57-94) years. 274 outpatient appointments have been saved, indicating a potential saving of £32,000. More importantly it increased the capacity of the department to assess new patients. For the individual patient, the system has saved them, a median of 3 appointments each.

The technology uses a new class of protein binding reagents called SOMAmers® (slow off-rate modified aptamers) and allows the simultaneous precise measurement of over 1000 proteins. Exosomes were highly purified from the Du145 prostate cancer cell line, by pooling selected fractions from a continuous sucrose gradient (within the density range of 1.1 to 1.2 g/ml), and examined under standard conditions or with additional detergent treatment by the SOMAscan™ array (version 3.0). Lysates of Du145 cells were also prepared, and the profiles were compared. Housekeeping proteins such as cyclophilin-A, LDH, and Hsp70 were present in exosomes, and we identified almost 100 proteins that were enriched in exosomes relative to cells. These included proteins of known association with cancer exosomes such as MFG-E8, integrins, and MET, and also those less widely reported as exosomally associated, such as ROR1 and ITIH4. Several proteins with no previously known exosomal association were confirmed as exosomally expressed in experiments using individual SOMAmer® reagents or antibodies in micro-plate assays. Western blotting confirmed the SOMAscan™-identified enrichment of exosomal NOTCH-3, L1CAM, RAC1, and ADAM9. In conclusion, we describe here over 300 proteins of hitherto unknown association with prostate cancer exosomes and suggest that the SOMAmer®-based assay technology is an effective proteomics platform for exosome-associated biomarker discovery in diverse clinical settings.""","""['Jason Webber', 'Timothy C Stone', 'Evaldas Katilius', 'Breanna C Smith', 'Bridget Gordon', 'Malcolm D Mason', 'Zsuzsanna Tabi', 'Ian A Brewis', 'Aled Clayton']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cell Proteomics""","""['Proteomics analysis of bladder cancer exosomes.', 'Molecular profiling of prostate cancer derived exosomes may reveal a predictive signature for response to docetaxel.', 'Proteomic profiling of exosomes leads to the identification of novel biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Highly multiplexed proteomic platform for biomarker discovery, diagnostics, and therapeutics.', 'Exosomal proteins as potential markers of tumor diagnosis.', 'High-Multiplex Aptamer-Based Serum Proteomics to Identify Candidate Serum Biomarkers of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Heterogeneity, Activation and Function: Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'Surface protein profiling of prostate-derived extracellular vesicles by mass spectrometry and proximity assays.', 'Extracellular Vesicle Antibody Microarray for Multiplexed Inner and Outer Protein Analysis.', 'High Levels of MFG-E8 Confer a Good Prognosis in Prostate and Renal Cancer Patients.']"""

For this, it is essential to obtain a 3D visualization of the implanted seeds and their relative position to the prostate. A method was developed to obtain a robust and precise segmentation of seeds in C-arm images, and this approach was tested using clinical datasets.  Method:   A region-based implicit active contour approach was used to delineate implanted seeds. Then, a template-based matching was employed to segment iodine implants whereas a K-means algorithm is implemented to resolve palladium seed clusters. To validate the method, 55 C-arm images from 10 patients were used for the segmentation of iodine sources, whereas 225 C-arm images from 16 patients were used for the palladium case.  Results:   Compared to manual ground truth segmentation of 6,002 iodine seeds and 15,354 palladium seeds, 98.7 % of iodine sources were automatically detected and declustered showing a false-positive rate of only 1.7 %. A total of 98.7 % of palladium sources were automatically detected and declustered with a false-positive rate of only 2.0 %.  Conclusion:   An automated segmentation method was developed that is able to perform the identification and annotation processes of seeds on par with a human expert.

We demonstrated that the strain index of Pca tissue was significantly higher than that of BPH tissue on the macro-scale but the Young's modulus of the Pca tissues, especially in advanced Pca, was lower than that of BPH tissues on the micro-scale. These two seemingly contradictory results can be explained by the excessive proliferation of tumor cells (Ki-67) and the degradation of scaffold proteins (collagens). These data indicate that alterations of the macro- and micro-mechanical properties of Pca tissues with malignant behavior are contradictory. The mechanical properties of tissues might be useful as a new risk factor for malignancy and metastasis in Pca.

The first recurrent fusion transcript in serous ovarian carcinomas was reported by Salzman et al. in 2011, who used deep paired-end sequencing to detect the fusion gene ESRRA-C11orf20 in 10 out of 67 (15%) serous ovarian carcinomas examined, a finding that holds great promise for our understanding of ovarian tumorigenesis as well as, potentially, for new treatment strategies. We wanted to test how frequent the ESRRA/C11orf20 fusion is in ovarian carcinomas of all subtypes, and therefore examined a series of 230 ovarian carcinomas of which 197 were of the serous subtype and 163 of the 197 were of stages III and IV--that is, the very same carcinoma subset where the fusion transcript had been found. We performed PCR and high-throughput sequencing analyses in search of the fusion transcript. We used the same primers described previously for the detection of the fusion and the same primer combination, but found no ESRRA/C11orf20 fusion in our series. A synthetic DNA plasmid containing the reported ESRRA/C11orf20 fusion was included as a positive control for our PCR experiments. Data from high-throughput sequencing of 23 ovarian carcinomas were screened in search of alternative partner(s) for the ESRRA and/or C11orf20 gene, but none was found. We conclude that the frequency of the ESRRA/C11orf20 gene fusion in serous ovarian carcinomas of stages III and IV must be considerable less than that reported previously (0/163 in our experience compared with 10/67 in the previous study). At the very least, it seems clear that the said fusion cannot be a common pathogenetic event in this tumor type.""","""['Francesca Micci', 'Ioannis Panagopoulos', 'Jim Thorsen', 'Ben Davidson', 'Claes Gøran Tropé', 'Sverre Heim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS Biol""","""['Identification of novel cyclin gene fusion transcripts in endometrioid ovarian carcinomas.', 'ESRRA-C11orf20 is a recurrent gene fusion in serous ovarian carcinoma.', 'Involvement of DPP9 in gene fusions in serous ovarian carcinoma.', 'Morphological subtypes of ovarian carcinoma: a review with emphasis on new developments and pathogenesis.', 'Morphologic features of carcinomas with recurrent gene fusions.', 'Transcriptomic and genomic profiling of early-stage ovarian carcinomas associated with histotype and overall survival.', 'Identification of novel cyclin gene fusion transcripts in endometrioid ovarian carcinomas.', 'Ovarian Cancers: Genetic Abnormalities, Tumor Heterogeneity and Progression, Clonal Evolution and Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Characterization of fusion genes in common and rare epithelial ovarian cancer histologic subtypes.', 'pETM: a penalized Exponential Tilt Model for analysis of correlated high-dimensional DNA methylation data.']"""

This requires reliable and reproducible parameters to effectively control potential cancer progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide a non-invasive means for this purpose.  Purpose:   To assess the value of diffusion-weighted imaging and proton MR spectroscopy for the prediction of prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness.  Material and methods:   In 39 of 64 consecutive patients who underwent endorectal 3-T MRI prior to radical prostatectomy, prostate specimens were analyzed as whole-mount step sections. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), normalized ADC (nADC: tumor/healthy tissue), choline/citrate (CC), and (choline + creatine)/citrate (CCC) ratios were correlated with Gleason scores (GS) from histopathological results. The power to discriminate low (GS ≤ 6) from higher-risk (GS ≥ 7) tumors was assessed with receiver operating characteristics (area under the curve [AUC]). Resulting threshold values were used by a blinded reader to distinguish between aggressive and indolent tumors.  Results:   Ninety lesions (1 × GS = 5, 41 × GS = 6, 36 × GS = 7, 12 × GS = 8) were considered. nADC (AUC = 0.90) showed a higher discriminatory power than ADC (AUC = 0.79). AUC for CC and CCC were 0.73 and 0.82, respectively. Using either nADC < 0.46 or CCC > 1.3, as well as both criteria for aggressive PCa, the reader correctly identified aggressive and indolent tumors in 31 (79%), 28 (72%), and 33 of 39 patients (85%), respectively. Predictions of tumor aggressiveness from TRUS-guided biopsies were correct in 27 of 36 patients (75%).

The molecular mechanisms by which physical activity may exert protective effects in the prostate remain unknown.  Methods:   We examined the associations between self-reported physical activity and gene expression patterns in morphologically normal prostate tissue of 71 men with low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. Differential gene expression, gene set, and pathway analyses were conducted comparing dichotomous groups defined by type, intensity, and amount of physical activity reported.  Results:   Cell cycling and DNA repair pathways were up-regulated in men who participated in ≥ 3 h/week vigorous activity compared with men who did not. In addition, canonical pathways involved in cell signaling and metabolism, the cellular effects of sildenafil (Viagra), and the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response were modulated in men who reported ≥ 3 h/week of vigorous activity. Differential expression analysis at the individual gene level revealed modest differences between men who performed vigorous activity for ≥ 3 h/week and those who did not. There were no differences in prostate gene expression in comparisons with exercise groupings that did not consider both duration and intensity of activity.  Conclusions:   Prostate gene expression and pathway analyses revealed sets of transcripts that may be modulated in normal prostate tissue by participating in ≥ 3 h/week of vigorous activity after diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer.

In this study, we focused on the gene regulatory effect of genistein on microRNA and its target genes in prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   Initially, we investigated the effect of genistein on prostate cancer cells and identified that the expression of miRNA-1260b was decreased by genistein. We performed functional analyses and investigated the relationship between miRNA-1260b expression and prostate cancer patient outcomes. Two target genes (sFRP1 and Smad4) of miR-1260b were identified based on computer algorithm and 3'UTR luciferase assay was carried out to determine direct miRNA regulation of the genes.  Results:   Genistein promoted apoptosis while inhibiting prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion and TCF reporter activity in PC cells. MiR-1260b was highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues and significantly downregulated by genistein in PC cells. After knocking down miR-1260b, cell proliferation, invasion, migration and TCF reporter activity were decreased in PC cells. Western analysis and 3'UTR luciferase assay showed that the two target genes (sFRP1 and Smad4) were directly regulated by miR-1260b. The expression of sFRP1 and Smad4 was significantly decreased in prostate cancer tissues. Genistein also increased expression of these two genes via DNA demethylation and histone modifications.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that genistein exerts its anti-tumour effect via downregulation of miR-1260b that targeted sRRP1 and Smad4 genes in prostate cancer cells.

The first results obtained from prostate cancer patients treated with carbon ion therapy showed good local tumor control and survival rates. In view of this advanced treatment modality we investigated the effects of irradiation with different beam qualities on gene expression changes in the PC3 prostate adenocarcinoma cell line. For this purpose, PC3 cells were irradiated with various doses (0.0, 0.5 and 2.0 Gy) of carbon ions (LET=33.7 keV/µm) at the beam of the Grand Accélérateur National d'Ions Lourds (Caen, France). Comparative experiments with X-rays were performed at the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre. Genome-wide gene expression was analyzed using microarrays. Our results show a downregulation in many genes involved in cell cycle and cell organization processes after 2.0 Gy irradiation. This effect was more pronounced after carbon ion irradiation compared with X-rays. Furthermore, we found a significant downregulation of many genes related to cell motility. Several of these changes were confirmed using qPCR. In addition, recurrence-free survival analysis of prostate cancer patients based on one of these motility genes (FN1) revealed that patients with low expression levels had a prolonged recurrence-free survival time, indicating that this gene may be a potential prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer.

Gemcitabine is a recently developed treatment option. However, the curative effects of gemcitabine are far from satisfactory due to de novo or acquired drug resistance. In a previous study, we reported that intravesical administration of the c-Myc inhibitor KSI-3716 suppresses tumor growth in an orthotopic bladder cancer model. Here, we explored whether KSI-3716 inhibits gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer cell proliferation. As expected from the in vitro cytotoxicity of gemcitabine in several bladder cancer cell lines, gemcitabine effectively suppressed the growth of KU19-19 xenografts in nude mice, although all mice relapsed later. Long-term in vitro exposure to gemcitabine induced gemcitabine-specific resistance. Gemcitabine-resistant cells, termed KU19-19/GEM, formed xenograft tumors even in the presence of 2 mg/kg gemcitabine.

We hypothesize that ERG overexpression is associated with primary drug resistance thereby influencing the outcome in leukemia. We previously reported a cell-line based model of ERG overexpression which induced a potentially chemo-resistant spindle shape cell type. Herein, we report a specific transcriptional gene signature for the observed spindle shaped morphology. Genes significantly over-expressed after ERG induction strongly resembled adhesive mesenchymal-like genes that included integrins (ITGA10, ITGB5, ITGB3, ITGA2B), CD44, and CD24. Interestingly, the mesenchymal-like signature was accompanied by the repression of DNA chromatin remodeling and DNA repair genes, such as CHEK1, EZH2, SUZ12, and DNMT3a. The ERG-induced mesenchymal-like signature positively correlated with TMPRSS2-ERG prostate tissues and invasive breast cancer mRNA expression datasets reflecting a general ERG-driven pattern of malignancy. Furthermore, inhibitors modulating ERG druggable pathways WNT, PKC, and AKT, and chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine revealed ERG-induced drug resistance. In particular, PKC412 treatment enhanced proliferative rates and promoted spindle shape formation in ERG-induced cells. Nilotinib and dasatinib were effective at abolishing ERG-induced cells. Moreover, ERG overexpression also led to an increase in double strand breaks. This report provides mechanistic clues into ERG-driven drug resistance in the poor prognostic group of high ERG expressers, provides insight to improved drug targeted therapies, and provides novel markers for a mesenchymal-like state in acute leukemia.""","""['Liliana H Mochmann', 'Martin Neumann', 'Eva K von der Heide', 'Verena Nowak', 'Anja A Kühl', 'Jutta Ortiz-Tanchez', 'Juliane Bock', 'Wolf K Hofmann', 'Claudia D Baldus']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Genome-wide screen reveals WNT11, a non-canonical WNT gene, as a direct target of ETS transcription factor ERG.', 'ERG promotes T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is transcriptionally regulated in leukemic cells by a stem cell enhancer.', 'ERG transcriptional networks in primary acute leukemia cells implicate a role for ERG in deregulated kinase signaling.', 'Dasatinib: a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.', 'Targeting signaling pathways in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia initiating cells.', ""miR-4482 and miR-3912 aim for 3'UTR of ERG mRNA in prostate cancer."", 'Pipeline for characterizing alternative mechanisms (PCAM) based on bi-clustering to study colorectal cancer heterogeneity.', 'FAT1 expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) modulates proliferation and WNT signaling.', 'ITGB5 promotes innate radiation resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma by promoting DNA damage repair and the MEK/ERK signaling pathway.', 'LncRNA SNHG3 Facilitates the Malignant Phenotype of Cholangiocarcinoma Cells via the miR-3173-5p/ERG Axis.']"""

Pseudopapillary features have not previously been described in high-grade acinar prostate adenocarcinoma. We reviewed our consult cases (2006 to 2013) for cases of high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma, in which the Gleason score was equal to 5+4=9 or 5+5=10, and the differential diagnosis included high-grade urothelial carcinoma. We identified 7 consult cases of high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma with pseudopapillary features, mimicking urothelial carcinoma. Three cases were originally misdiagnosed as urothelial carcinoma. In 3 cases, the outside diagnosis was urothelial carcinoma versus prostate adenocarcinoma, and 1 case had no submitting diagnosis. All cases were transurethral resections, with tumor involving the prostatic urethra in 5 cases and 6 with bladder involvement. Three patients had a known history of prostate adenocarcinoma. The tumors grew in nests and sheets, 1 with microacinar differentiation and another with focal, rare glands. In places, tumors formed papillary-appearing structures with central blood vessels. In most cases, the nuclei were uniform with prominent nucleoli. One case had pleomorphic giant cell features, and another had sarcomatoid features. Necrosis was present in 2 cases. One case had a separate focus of low-grade noninvasive urothelial carcinoma present in the bladder and a better-differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma (Gleason score 4+3=7) involving the prostate on needle biopsy. In all cases, the pseudopapillary areas showed negative immunohistochemical staining for bladder markers including GATA3 (5 cases), p63 (5 cases), CK903 (4 cases), and thrombomodulin (3 cases). All cases showed positivity for prostatic markers including PSA (5 cases), p501s (6 cases), PSMA (4 cases), and NKX3.1 (5 cases). One case showed focal, nonspecific staining for p63, and another showed focal staining for p63 and CK903 in an area with squamous differentiation, contributing to the diagnostic difficulty. In summary, high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma can present in the urinary bladder and prostatic urethra, clinically mimicking urothelial carcinoma. Although high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma typically has relatively uniform cytology, it can have pleomorphic giant cell features overlapping with urothelial carcinoma. The presence of pseudopapillary features in high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma is a newly recognized morphologic overlap that can lead to further diagnostic difficulty in distinguishing the 2 entities. For high-grade tumors involving the prostatic urethra without typical admixed lower-grade prostate adenocarcinoma, immunohistochemical studies for bladder and prostate markers should be carried out.""","""['Jennifer Gordetsky', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Immunohistochemical differentiation of high-grade prostate carcinoma from urothelial carcinoma.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'High-grade foamy gland prostatic adenocarcinoma on biopsy or transurethral resection: a morphologic study of 55 cases.', 'Utility of uroplakin II expression as a marker of urothelial carcinoma.', 'Polyomavirus (BK)-associated pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder: a case report.', 'Pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma of the prostate: clinicopathologic analysis and oncological outcomes.', 'Prostate cancer metastasis mimicking a primary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Low grade urothelial carcinoma mimicking basal cell hyperplasia and transitional metaplasia in needle prostate biopsy.']"""

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is known to induce EMT in a number of cancer cell types; however, the mechanism underlying this transition process is not fully understood. In this study we have demonstrated that TGF-β upregulates the expression of tumor suppressor protein Par-4 (prostate apoptosis response-4) concomitant with the induction of EMT. Mechanistic investigations revealed that exogenous treatment with each TGF-β isoform upregulates Par-4 mRNA and protein levels in parallel levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and IκB-α increase. Disruption of TGF-β signaling by using ALK5 inhibitor, neutralizing TGF-β antibody or phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor reduces endogenous Par-4 levels, suggesting that both Smad and NF-κB pathways are involved in TGF-β-mediated Par-4 upregulation. NF-κB-binding sites in Par-4 promoter have previously been reported; however, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay we showed that Par-4 promoter region also contains Smad4-binding site. Furthermore, TGF-β promotes nuclear localization of Par-4. Prolonged TGF-β3 treatment disrupts epithelial cell morphology, promotes cell motility and induces upregulation of Snail, vimentin, zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 and N-Cadherin and downregulation of Claudin-1 and E-Cadherin. Forced expression of Par-4, results in the upregulation of vimentin and Snail expression together with increase in cell migration. In contrast, small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of Par-4 expression results in decrease of vimentin and Snail expression and prevents TGF-β-induced EMT. We have also uncovered a role of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein in the regulation of endogenous Par-4 levels through inhibition of caspase-mediated cleavage. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Par-4 is a novel and essential downstream target of TGF-β signaling and acts as an important factor during TGF-β-induced EMT.""","""['P Chaudhry', 'F Fabi', 'M Singh', 'S Parent', 'V Leblanc', 'E Asselin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Par-4 mediated Smad4 induction in PDAC cells restores canonical TGF-β/ Smad4 axis driving the cells towards lethal EMT.', 'Vasohibin-2 is required for epithelial-mesenchymal transition of ovarian cancer cells by modulating transforming growth factor-β signaling.', 'TGF-β promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition via NF-κB/NOX4/ROS signal pathway in lung cancer cells.', 'Aberrant Activation Mechanism of TGF-β Signaling in Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition.', 'NF-κB as a regulator of cancer metastasis and therapy response: A focus on epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'miR-24-3p Regulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and the Malignant Phenotype of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma by Regulating ASF1B Expression.', 'Arylquin 1 (Potent Par-4 Secretagogue) Inhibits Tumor Progression and Induces Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Canonical TGFβ Signaling and Its Contribution to Endometrial Cancer Development and Progression-Underestimated Target of Anticancer Strategies.', 'HECTD1 regulates the expression of SNAIL: Implications for epithelial‑mesenchymal transition.', 'Inhibition of CRM1 activity sensitizes endometrial and ovarian cell lines to TRAIL-induced cell death.']"""

These studies did not attempt to model the dynamics of intratumoral heterogeneity involved in the metastatic cascade. An unorthodox look at the phenotypic heterogeneity of prostate cancer cells in vitro enabled us to identify links between Cx43 functions and Snail-1-regulated functional speciation of invasive cells. Incomplete Snail-1-dependent phenotypic shifts accounted for the formation of phenotypically stable subclones of AT-2 cells. These subclones showed diverse predilection for invasive behavior. High Snail-1 and Cx43 levels accompanied high motility and nanomechanical elasticity of the fibroblastoid AT-2_Fi2 subclone, which determined its considerable invasiveness. Transforming growth factor-β and ectopic Snail-1 overexpression induced invasiveness and Cx43 expression in epithelioid AT-2 subclones and DU-145 cells. Functional links between Snail-1 function and Cx43 expression were confirmed by Cx43 downregulation and phenotypic shifts in AT-2_Fi2, DU-145 and MAT-LyLu cells upon Snail-1 silencing. Corresponding morphological changes and Snail-1 downregulation were seen upon Cx43 silencing in AT-2_Fi2 cells. This indicates that feedback loops between both proteins regulate cell invasive behavior. We demonstrate that Cx43 may differentially predispose prostate cancer cells for invasion in a coupling-dependent and coupling-independent manner. When extrapolated to in vivo conditions, these data show the complexity of Cx43 functions during the metastatic cascade of prostate cancer.

We investigated the role of GSK-3 and the existence of an Akt-resistant pathway for GSK-3 activation in prostate cancer cells. Our data show that Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase is responsible for Y216GSK-3 phosphorylation leading to its activation even when Akt is active. Experiments involving mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking cSrc, Yes and Fyn, as well as Src activity modulation in prostate cancer cells with constitutively active (CA-Src) and dominant negative Src (DN-Src) plasmids demonstrated the integral role of Src in Y216GSK-3 phosphorylation and activity modulation. Inhibition of GSK-3 with SB415286 in PC3 cells resulted in impaired motility, proliferation and colony formation. Treatment of PC3 cells with the Src inhibitor dasatinib reduced Y216GSK-3 phosphorylation and inhibited proliferation, invasion and micrometastasis in vitro. Dasatinib treatment of athymic nude mice resulted in impaired growth of PC3 cell tumor xenograft.

We therefore performed RNA sequencing on paired metastatic/non-metastatic PCa xenografts derived from clinical specimens. The most highly up-regulated transcript was LOC728606, a lncRNA now designated PCAT18. PCAT18 is specifically expressed in the prostate compared to 11 other normal tissues (p<0.05) and up-regulated in PCa compared to 15 other neoplasms (p<0.001). Cancer-specific up-regulation of PCAT18 was confirmed on an independent dataset of PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia samples (p<0.001). PCAT18 was detectable in plasma samples and increased incrementally from healthy individuals to those with localized and metastatic PCa (p<0.01). We identified a PCAT18-associated expression signature (PES), which is highly PCa-specific and activated in metastatic vs. primary PCa samples (p<1E-4, odds ratio>2). The PES was significantly associated with androgen receptor (AR) signalling. Accordingly, AR activation dramatically up-regulated PCAT18 expression in vitro and in vivo. PCAT18 silencing significantly (p<0.001) inhibited PCa cell proliferation and triggered caspase 3/7 activation, with no effect on non-neoplastic cells.

Outer-volume suppression of lipid signals was performed using regional saturation (REST) slabs and the quantification of spectra at both TEs was achieved with the quantitation using quantum estimation (QUEST) routine. Metabolite nulling experiments in an additional five patients found that there were negligible macromolecule background signals in prostate spectra at TE = 32 ms. Metabolite visibility was judged using the criterion Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB)/amplitude < 20%, and metabolite concentrations were corrected for relaxation effects and referenced to the data acquired in corresponding water-unsuppressed MRSI scans. For the first time, the prostate metabolites spermine and myo-inositol were quantified individually in vivo, together with citrate, choline and creatine. All five metabolite visibilities were higher in TE = 32 ms MRSI than in TE = 100 ms MRSI. At TE = 32 ms, citrate was visible in 99.0% of lipid-free spectra, whereas, at TE = 100 ms, no metabolite simulation of citrate matched the in vivo peaks. Spermine, choline and creatine were visualised separately in 30.4% more spectra at TE = 32 ms than at TE = 100 ms, and myo-inositol in 72.5% more spectra. T2 values were calculated for spermine (53 ± 16 ms), choline (62 ± 17 ms) and myo-inositol (90 ± 48 ms). Data from the TE = 32 ms spectra showed that the concentrations of citrate and spermine secretions were positively correlated in both the peripheral zone and central gland (R(2) = 0.73 and R(2) = 0.43, respectively), and that the citrate content was significantly higher in the former at 64 ± 22 mm than in the latter at 32 ± 16 mm (p = 0.01).

However, prospective studies that investigated the associations between specific lipid metabolism biomarkers and cancer risk provided inconsistent results. The objective was to investigate the prospective associations between total cholesterol (T-C), HDL-C, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins A1 (apoA1) and B, and triglycerides and overall, breast and prostate cancer risk. Analyses were performed on 7,557 subjects of the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants Study, a nationwide French cohort study.

Materials and methods:   A total of 72 patients with nodal prostate cancer relapse after primary therapy underwent pelvic and/or retroperitoneal salvage lymph node dissection. Salvage was done after whole body positron emission tomography/computerized tomography with (11)C-choline or (18)F-fluoroethylcholine showed positron emission tomography positive lymph nodes but no other detectable metastasis. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in 160 dissected lymph node regions (pelvic left/right and retroperitoneal), 498 subregions (common, external and internal iliac, obturator, presacral, aortic bifurcation, aortal, vena caval and interaortocaval) and 2,122 lymph nodes.  Results:   Lymph node metastasis was present in 32% of resected lymph nodes (681 of 2,122), resulting in 238 positive subregions and 111 positive regions.

Lymph node metastasis site and the radiotracer ((11)C-choline/(18)F-fluoroethylcholine) had no substantial impact on diagnostic accuracy.  Conclusions:   Choline positron emission tomography/computerized tomography detects affected lymph node regions (pelvic left/right and retroperitoneal) in patients with prostate cancer relapse with high accuracy and it seems helpful for guiding salvage lymph node dissection.

Multiple logistic regression was used to predict 30-day unplanned hospital readmissions controlling for demographics, clinical characteristics and comorbidities. Readmission rates of the 5 most common procedures were calculated along with the rate of postoperative complications associated with readmission.  Results:   Outpatient urological surgery had an overall 3.7% readmission rate. The 5 most common procedures were cystourethroscopy and resection of bladder tumor (readmission rate 4.97%), laser prostatectomy (4.27%), transurethral resection of prostate (4.24%), hydrocele excision (1.92%) and sling surgery for urinary incontinence (0.85%).

Materials and methods:   Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) and Medicare data we identified 49,192 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer from 2004 through 2007. Of 7,347 patients who did not receive treatment (ie expectant management) within 12 months of diagnosis we assessed the prevalence of active surveillance (ie repeat prostate biopsy and prostate specific antigen measurement) vs watchful waiting across health care markets. We fit multivariable logistic regression models to examine associations of active surveillance with patient demographics, cancer severity and health care market characteristics.  Results:   During the study interval use of active surveillance vs watchful waiting increased significantly in patients treated expectantly from 9.7% in 2004 to 15.3% in 2007 (p <0.001). Active surveillance was less common in older patients, those with high risk tumors and those with more comorbidities (each p <0.001). Patients who were white and had higher socioeconomic status were more likely to receive active surveillance (each p <0.05). After adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics significant differences in the predicted probability of active surveillance persisted across health care markets (range 2.4% to 30.1%). No significant variation in active surveillance use was associated with specific health care market characteristics, including intensity of end of life care, Medicare reimbursement or provider density.  Conclusions:   Active surveillance has been relatively uncommon in Medicare beneficiaries with localized prostate cancer. Its use relative to watchful waiting varies based on patient demographics, tumor severity and geographic location.""","""['Christopher P Filson', 'Florian R Schroeck', 'Zaojun Ye', 'John T Wei', 'Brent K Hollenbeck', 'David C Miller']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Editorial comment.', 'Expectant management of veterans with early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Population-Based Assessment of Determining Treatments for Prostate Cancer.', 'Population-based assessment of determining predictors for quality of prostate cancer surveillance.', 'Expectant management for men with early stage prostate cancer.', 'Clarifying uncertainty regarding detection and treatment of early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Treatment patterns and survival of low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer in end-stage kidney disease: A retrospective population cohort study.', 'Intensity of observation with active surveillance or watchful waiting in men with prostate cancer in the United States.', 'Associations of multimorbidity and patient-reported experiences of care with conservative management among elderly patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Exploring Variation in the Use of Conservative Management for Low-risk Prostate Cancer in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System.', 'The Development and Validation of Prostate Cancer-specific Physician-Hospital Networks.']"""

Materials and methods:   In this single center, prospective study men older than 40 years with abnormal prostate specific antigen/digital rectal examination and no previous multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging underwent T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging without an endorectal coil. Imaging was allocated alternately to 1.5/3.0 Tesla. Imaging was double reported independently using PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) by specialist radiologists. Transperineal grid directed 30-core biopsy was performed with additional magnetic resonance imaging directed cores for regions of interest outside template locations. Four significant cancer definitions were tested. Chi-square and logistic regression analysis was done. Men undergoing prostatectomy were analyzed.  Results:   Of the 165 men who enrolled in the study 150 were analyzed. Median age was 62.4 years, median prostate specific antigen was 5.6 ng/ml, 29% of patients had an abnormal digital rectal examination and 88% underwent initial biopsy.

However, castration resistance will eventually emerge. In the present study, we have investigated the role of bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in the context of bone metastases.  Methods:   We initially investigated the clinical course of 158 men with advanced CaP who were treated with primary androgen deprivation therapy. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of CRPC in the context of bone metastases, we examined the impact of bone stromal cells on CaP in the absence of androgens using a co-culture model.  Results:   In the 158 patients, we found that the median time to prostate-specific antigen progression was significantly shorter when bone metastases were present (14 months (95% CI, 10.2-17.8 months) vs 57 months (95% CI, 19.4-94.6 months)). These results suggest that bone-tumour interactions may accelerate castration resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vitro co-cultures demonstrated that CaP cells proliferated under an androgen-depleted condition when incubated with bone stromal cells. Mechanistically, gene expression analysis using quantitative polymerase chain reaction arrays showed a dramatic induction of BMP-6 by CaP cell lines in the presence of bone stromal cells. Further studies revealed that WNT5A derived from bone stromal cells induced the expression of BMP-6 by CaP cells; BMP-6 in turn stimulated cellular proliferation of CaP cells in an androgen-deprived media via a physical interaction between Smad5 and β-catenin. Intracellularly, WNT5A increased BMP-6 expression via protein kinase C/NF-κB pathway in CaP cell lines.  Conclusions:   These observations suggest that bone-CaP interaction leads to castration resistance via WNT5A/BMP-6 loop.""","""['G T Lee', 'D I Kang', 'Y-S Ha', 'Y S Jung', 'J Chung', 'K Min', 'T H Kim', 'K H Moon', 'J M Chung', 'D H Lee', 'W-J Kim', 'I Y Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['WNT5A induces castration-resistant prostate cancer via CCL2 and tumour-infiltrating macrophages.', 'Bone morphogenetic protein-6 induces castration resistance in prostate cancer cells through tumor infiltrating macrophages.', 'Role of WNT7B-induced noncanonical pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'The role of intracrine androgen metabolism, androgen receptor and apoptosis in the survival and recurrence of prostate cancer during androgen deprivation therapy.', 'WNT ligands in non-small cell lung cancer: from pathogenesis to clinical practice.', 'Wnt Signaling in the Development of Bone Metastasis.', 'Altered Wnt5a expression affects radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Epigenetic Silencing of BMP6 by the SIN3A-HDAC1/2 Repressor Complex Drives Melanoma Metastasis via FAM83G/PAWS1.', 'Mechanisms of the Osteogenic Switch of Smooth Muscle Cells in Vascular Calcification: WNT Signaling, BMPs, Mechanotransduction, and EndMT.']"""

Disruption of this localisation pattern using dominant-negative protein expression and siRNA knockdown showed that PDE4D7 acts in opposition to proliferative signalling as assessed by electrical impedance-based proliferation assays.  Results:   Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression. PDE4D7 is highly expressed in AS cells and starkly downregulated in AI samples. The significance of this downregulation is underscored by our finding that PDE4D7 contributes a major fraction of cAMP degrading PDE activity tethered at the plasma membrane and that displacement of PDE4D7 from this compartment leads to an increase in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PDE4D7 mRNA expression is not, however, directly regulated by the androgen receptor signalling axis despite an overlapping genomic structure with the androgen responsive gene PART1. PDE4D7, which locates to the plasma membrane, acts to supress aberrant non-steroidal growth signals within the prostate or AS metastasis.  Conclusions:   PDE4D7 expression is significantly downregulated between AS and AI cell phenotypes. This change in expression potentially provides a novel androgen-independent biomarker and manipulation of its activity or its expression may provide therapeutic possibilities and insights into contributory aspects of the complex molecular pathology of prostate cancer.""","""['D J P Henderson', 'A Byrne', 'K Dulla', 'G Jenster', 'R Hoffmann', 'G S Baillie', 'M D Houslay']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Human phosphodiesterase 4D7 (PDE4D7) expression is increased in TMPRSS2-ERG-positive primary prostate cancer and independently adds to a reduced risk of post-surgical disease progression.', 'Creating a potential diagnostic for prostate cancer risk stratification (InformMDx™) by translating novel scientific discoveries concerning cAMP degrading phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7).', 'Cloning and characterization of novel PDE4D isoforms PDE4D6 and PDE4D7.', 'Validation of Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate Phosphodiesterase-4D7 for its Independent Contribution to Risk Stratification in a Prostate Cancer Patient Cohort with Longitudinal Biological Outcomes.', 'The role of ERK2 docking and phosphorylation of PDE4 cAMP phosphodiesterase isoforms in mediating cross-talk between the cAMP and ERK signalling pathways.', 'Ablation of specific long PDE4D isoforms increases neurite elongation and conveys protection against amyloid-β pathology.', 'The CAPRA&PDE4D5/7/9 Prognostic Model Is Significantly Associated with Adverse Post-Surgical Pathology Outcomes.', 'The regulatory role of PDE4B in the progression of inflammatory function study.', 'A cAMP signalosome in primary cilia drives gene expression and kidney cyst formation.', 'PAN-selective inhibition of cAMP-phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) induces gastroparesis in mice.']"""

Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor and reported to prevent the progression of prostate cancer. However, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the suppression of prostate cancer growth by celecoxib and elucidated the biological relevance of the inhibited pathway in prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods:   Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR and cell proliferation assay were used to resolve the mechanism of celecoxib in prostate cancer cell line PC3, LNCaP and their derivatives.  Results:   Celecoxib induced apoptosis and downregulated EP2, CREB and androgen receptor (AR). Moreover, EP2 antagonist downregulated CREB as well as COX-2 and AR, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation. Furthermore, EP2 and CREB knockdown induced AR downregulation, indicating that AR suppression by celecoxib is mediated by EP2/CREB signaling.

In addition, interventions are needed that help to overcome barriers to psychosocial treatment such as limited face-to-face psychosocial support services, a shortage of adequately trained professionals, geographical distance, perceived and personal stigma and a preference for consumer-centric and self-directed learning. My Road Ahead is an online cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention for prostate cancer. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will evaluate the efficacy of this online intervention alone, the intervention in combination with a moderated online forum, and the moderated online forum alone.  Methods/design:   This study utilises a RCT design with three groups receiving: 1) the 6-module My Road Ahead intervention alone; 2) the My Road Ahead intervention plus a moderated online forum; and 3) the moderated online forum alone. It is expected that 150 men with localised prostate cancer will be recruited into the RCT. Online measures will assess men's psychological distress as well as sexual and relationship adjustment at baseline, post-intervention, 3 month follow-up and 6 month follow-up. The study is being conducted in Australia and participants will be recruited from April 2012 to Feb 2014. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of My Road Ahead in reducing psychological distress.  Discussion:   To our knowledge, My Road Ahead is the first self-directed online psychological intervention developed for men who have been treated for localised prostate cancer. The RCT will assess the efficacy of this intervention in improving psychological well-being, sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction and overall quality of life. If successful, this intervention could provide much needed support to men receiving treatment for localised prostate cancer in a highly accessible manner.

Methods:   In silico analyses were used to search for miRNAs being putative regulators of PCa-associated genes. The expression of nine selected miRNAs (hsa-miR-101, -138, -186, -224, -26a, -26b, -374a, -410, -660) as well as of the aforementioned PCa-associated genes was analyzed by quantitative PCR using 50 malignant (Tu) and matched non-malignant (Tf) tissue samples from prostatectomy specimens as well as 30 samples from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Then, correlations between paired miRNA and target gene expression levels were analyzed. Furthermore, the effect of exogenously administered miR-26a on selected target genes was determined by quantitative PCR and Western Blot in various PCa cell lines. A luciferase reporter assay was used for target validation.  Results:   The expression of all selected miRNAs was decreased in PCa tissue samples compared to either control group (Tu vs Tf: -1.35 to -5.61-fold; Tu vs BPH: -1.17 to -5.49-fold). The down-regulation of most miRNAs inversely correlated with an up-regulation of their putative target genes with Spearman correlation coefficients ranging from -0.107 to -0.551. MiR-186 showed a significantly diminished expression in patients with non-organ confined PCa and initial metastases. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-26a reduced the mRNA and protein expression of its potential target gene AMACR in vitro. Using the luciferase reporter assay AMACR was validated as new target for miR-26a.  Conclusions:   The findings of this study indicate that the expression of specific miRNAs is decreased in PCa and inversely correlates with the up-regulation of their putative target genes.

We sought to identify predictors of morbidity after surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) using a large national contemporary population-based cohort.  Methods:   Relying on the American College of Surgeons National Surgical-Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP; 2006-2011) database, we evaluated outcomes after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), laser vaporization of the prostate (LVP), and laser enucleation of the prostate (LEP). Outcomes included blood-transfusion rates, length of stay, complications, reintervention rates, and perioperative mortality. Multivariable logistic-regression analysis evaluated the predictors of perioperative morbidity and mortality.  Results:   Overall, 4794 (65.2%), 2439 (33.1%), and 126 (1.7%) patients underwent TURP, LVP, and LEP, respectively. No significant difference in overall complications (P=0.3) or perioperative mortality (P=0.5) between the three surgical groups was found. LVP was found to be associated with decreased blood transfusions (odds ratio [OR]=0.21; P=0.001), length of stay (OR=0.12; P<0.001) and reintervention rates (OR=0.63; P=0.02). LEP was found to be associated with decreased prolonged length of stay (OR=0.35; P=0.01). Men with advanced age at surgery and non-Caucasians were at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. In contrast, normal preoperative albumin and higher preoperative hematocrit (>30%) levels were the only predictors of lower overall complications and perioperative mortality.  Conclusions:   All three surgical modalities for BPH management were found to be safe. Advanced age and non-Caucasian race were independent predictors of adverse outcomes after BPH surgery. In patients with these attributes, conservative treatment might be a reasonable alternative. Also, preoperative hematocrit and albumin levels represent reliable predictors of adverse outcomes, suggesting that these markers should be evaluated before BPH surgery.""","""['Naeem Bhojani', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Akshay Sood', 'Arun Rai', 'Daniel Pucheril', 'Steven L Chang', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Mani Menon', 'Kola Olugbade Jr', 'Nedim Ruhotina', 'Jesse D Sammon', 'Shyam Sukumar', 'Maxine Sun', 'Khurshid R Ghani', 'Marianne Schmid', 'Briony Varda', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Kevin C Zorn', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Re: Morbidity and mortality after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery: data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.', 'Re: Morbidity and mortality after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery: data from the american college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program.', 'Re: Morbidity and Mortality after Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Surgery: Data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.', 'Laser enucleation of the prostate versus transurethral resection of the prostate: perioperative outcomes from the ACS NSQIP database.', 'Re: Morbidity and Mortality after Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Surgery: Data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.', 'Re: Morbidity and mortality after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery: data from the american college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program.', 'Photoselective vaporisation of the prostate using 80-W and 120-W laser versus transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review with meta-analysis from 2002 to 2012.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update.', 'Serenoa repens for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic enlargement.', 'Short- and long-term risks of photoselective laser vaporization of the prostate: a population-based comparison with transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia surgical treatment trends in the Public Health System in São Paulo, Brazil.', 'The role of intra-operative void score during transurethral resection of prostate as a marker of efficacy: a feasibility study.', 'Mortality after surgery for benign prostate hyperplasia: a nationwide cohort study.']"""

Recently, DNA oxidized abasic sites that are produced by potent antitumor agents were shown to inactivate DNA polymerase β. A library of small molecules whose structures were inspired by the oxidized abasic sites was synthesized and screened for the ability to irreversibly inhibit DNA polymerase β. One candidate (3a) was examined more thoroughly, and modification of its phosphate backbone led to a molecule that irreversibly inactivates DNA polymerase β in solution (IC50 ≈ 21 μM), and inhibits the enzyme's lyase activity in cell lysates. A bisacetate analogue is converted in cell lysates to 3a. The bisacetate is more effective in cell lysates, more cytotoxic in prostate cancer cells than 3a and potentiates the cytotoxicity of methyl methanesulfonate between 2- and 5-fold.

The nCCM is ≈ 22 and 300 nm in diameter at 37 and 22 °C, respectively. The smaller size of the nCCM at 37 °C was found to significantly facilitate its uptake in vitro by human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 cancer cells. However, the intracellular nCCM decreases rapidly (rather than plateaus) after reaching its peak at ≈ 1.5 h during a 3-day incubation of the PC-3 cells with nCCM. Moreover, a mild hyperthermia (with negligible cytotoxicity alone) at 43 °C applied between 1 and 1.5 h during the 3-day incubation not only increases the peak uptake but also alters intracellular distribution of nCCM (facilitating its delivery into cell nuclei), which helps to retain a significantly much higher level of intracellular curcumin. These effects of mild hyperthermia could be due in part to the thermal responsiveness of the nCCM: they are more positively charged at 43 °C and can be more easily attracted to the negatively charged nuclear membrane to enter nuclei as a result of electrostatic interaction. Ultimately, a combination of the thermally responsive nCCM and mild hyperthermia significantly enhances the anticancer capability of nCCM, resulting in a more than 7-fold decrease in its inhibitory concentration to reduce cell viability to 50% (IC50). Further mechanistic studies suggest injury pathways associated with heat shock proteins 27 and 70 should contribute to the enhanced cancer cell destruction by inducing cell apoptosis and necrosis.

Immunodepleting Raptor or PDK from cell lysates of cells treated with α2M* drastically reduced Akt phosphorylation at Thr(308), which was recovered by adding the supernatant of Raptor- or PDK1-depleted cell lysates, respectively. Studies of insulin binding to its receptor on prostate cancer cells yielded similar results. We thus demonstrate that phosphorylating the T-loop Akt residue Thr(308) by PDK1 requires Raptor of the mTORC1 complex as a platform or scaffold protein.""","""['Uma Kant Misra', 'Salvatore Vincent Pizzo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Receptor-recognized α₂-macroglobulin binds to cell surface-associated GRP78 and activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Binding of activated alpha2-macroglobulin to its cell surface receptor GRP78 in 1-LN prostate cancer cells regulates PAK-2-dependent activation of LIMK.', 'Activated α2-Macroglobulin Regulates Transcriptional Activation of c-MYC Target Genes through Cell Surface GRP78 Protein.', 'Ligation of cell surface-associated glucose-regulated protein 78 by receptor-recognized forms of alpha 2-macroglobulin: activation of p21-activated protein kinase-2-dependent signaling in murine peritoneal macrophages.', 'Control of Akt activity and substrate phosphorylation in cells.', 'Crosstalk between circRNAs and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in cancer progression.', 'Role of PI3K/AKT pathway in cancer: the framework of malignant behavior.', 'GRP78 regulates milk biosynthesis and the proliferation of bovinemammaryepithelial cells through the mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Ovostatin 2 knockdown significantly inhibits the growth, migration, and tumorigenicity of cutaneous malignant melanoma cells.', 'ROS-independent Nrf2 activation in prostate cancer.']"""

Although ERG gene rearrangement has been identified in approximately 50% of localized prostate cancers in western countries, the prognostic significance of this critical molecular event remains unknown in Chinese patients. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry, we evaluated ERG, PTEN and EGFR family aberrations in a cohort of 224 Chinese prostate cancer patients diagnosed in transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P). Overall, ERG rearrangement was detected in 23.2% (44/190) cases, of which 54.5% (24/44) showed deletion of the 5'end of ERG. PTEN deletion was identified in 10.8% (19/176) cases. Amplification of EGFR and HER2 genes was present in 1.1% (2/178) and 5.8% (10/173) of cases, respectively. Significant correlation between ERG rearrangement and PTEN deletion was identified in this cohort. EGFR and HER2 aberrations occurred more frequently in PCas without ERG rearrangement than in those with ERG rearrangement, although this did not reach statistical significance. Overall, ERG rearrangement was associated with pre-operative PSA values (P = 0.038) and cancer-related death (P = 0.02), but not with the age, clinical T stage, Gleason score, or Ki-67 labeling index (LI). Notably, multivariate analysis including known prognostic markers revealed ERG rearrangement was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.022). Additionally, ERG rearrangement status was helpful to identify patients with poor prognosis from PCa group with low Ki-67 LI. In summary, we reported that ERG rearrangement was associated with cancer-related death in Chinese PCa patients. Determination of ERG rearrangement status allows stratification of PCa patients into different survival categories.""","""['Mei Qi', 'Xiaoqing Yang', 'Fan Zhang', 'Tao Lin', 'Xiubin Sun', 'Yanjiang Li', 'Huiqing Yuan', 'Yubo Ren', 'Juan Zhang', 'Xiaomin Qin', 'Bo Han']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PTEN genomic deletion is an early event associated with ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'Fluorescence in situ hybridization study shows association of PTEN deletion with ERG rearrangement during prostate cancer progression.', 'Molecular profiling of ETS and non-ETS aberrations in prostate cancer patients from northern India.', 'Emerging Developments in ETS-Positive Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Association Between ERG/PTEN Genes and Pathologic Parameters of Prostate Cancer With an Emphasis on Gleason Score: A Literature Review.', 'Evaluation of ERG Expression in Prostate Adenocarcinoma and Its Prognostic Impact in Patients Survival Rate.', 'The SOX4/miR-17-92/RB1 Axis Promotes Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Prevalence and clinical application of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in Asian prostate cancer patients: a large-sample study in Chinese people and a systematic review.', 'CUL4B promotes gastric cancer invasion and metastasis-involvement of upregulation of HER2.', 'Ethnicity and ERG frequency in prostate cancer.']"""

We previously reported that combined androgen blockade with an alternative non-steroidal antiandrogen is effective for advanced prostate cancer that has relapsed after initial combined androgen blockade.  Methods:   We enrolled 161 patients from 14 medical institutions with histologically confirmed prostate cancer who had been treated with combination therapy and in whom cancer progressed after first-line combined androgen blockade therapy.

We have now extended these studies to evaluate the impact of MSeA on REDD1 (an mTOR inhibitor) in inducing cell death of invasive prostate cancer cells in hypoxia. In both PTEN+ and PTEN- prostate cancer cells we show that MSeA elevates REDD1 and phosphorylation of AKT along with p70S6K in hypoxia. Furthermore, REDD1 induction by MSeA is independent of AKT and the mTOR inhibition in prostate cancer cells causes partial resistance to MSeA-induced growth reduction in hypoxia.

Pretreatment prostate biopsies were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH for ERG rearrangement and overexpression, PTEN deletion, and expression loss. Univariable and multivariable Cox-regression analyses evaluated association of ERG and PTEN status with biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   Within a median follow-up of 73 months, 11% of patients experienced BCR. Of 80 samples with both IHC and FISH performed for ERG, 46 (57.8%) demonstrated rearrangement by FISH and 45 (56.3%) by IHC. Of 77 samples with both IHC and FISH for PTEN, 14 (18.2%) had PTEN deletion by FISH and 22 (28.6%) by IHC. No significant associations were found between ERG, PTEN status, and clinicopathologic features. Patients with concurrent ERG rearrangement and PTEN deletion demonstrated significantly worse relapse-free survival rates compared with those with ERG or PTEN wild type (P < 0.01). In multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for the effects of standard clinicopathologic features, combined ERG rearranged and PTEN deletion was independently associated with BCR (HR = 2.6; P = 0.02).

We aimed to assess the predictive value of the side of DRE abnormality for prostate cancer (PCa) detection and aggressiveness in right-handed urologists.  Methods:   An analysis of a prospective database was carried out that included all consecutive men undergoing prostate biopsies between 2001 and 2012. The main end point was the predictive value of the abnormality side during DRE for cancer detection in clinically suspicious unilateral T2 disease. The diagnostic performance of left- versus right-sided abnormality was also assessed in terms of sensitivity, specificity and negative/positive predictive values.  Results:   Overall, 308 patients had a suspicious unilateral clinical disease (detection rate 57.5%). The cancer detection rate was significantly higher in case of left-sided compared with right-sided clinical T2 stage (odds ratio 2.1). In case of left-sided disease, the number of positive cores, the rate of perineural invasion, the rate of primary grade 4 pattern and the percentage of cancer involvement per core were significantly higher compared with those reported for right-sided disease. The predictive value of abnormality laterality for cancer detection and aggressiveness remained statistically independent in multivariate models. The positive predictive value for cancer detection was 64.6 in case of suspicious left-sided disease versus 46.9 in case of right-sided disease.  Conclusions:   The risks of detecting PCa and aggressive disease on biopsy are significantly higher when DRE reveals a suspicious left-sided clinical disease as compared with right-sided disease. Right-handed physicians should be aware of this variance in diagnostic performance and potential underdetection of left-sided clinical disease, and should improve their examination of the left lobe of the gland by conducting longer exams or changing the patient's position.""","""['G Ploussard', 'N Nicolaiew', 'P Mongiat-Artus', 'S Terry', 'Y Allory', 'F Vacherot', 'C-C Abbou', 'F Desgrandchamps', 'L Salomon', 'A de la Taille']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['The digital rectal examination (DRE) remains important - outcomes from a contemporary cohort of men undergoing an initial 12-18 core prostate needle biopsy.', 'Use of low free to total PSA ratio in prostate cancer screening: detection rates, clinical and pathological findings in Brazilian men with serum PSA levels <4.0 ng/mL.', 'Diagnostic performance of malignant prostatic cells detection in blood for early detection of prostate cancer: comparison to prostatic biopsy.', 'Comparison of digital rectal examination and biopsy results with the radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Digital Rectal Examination for Prostate Cancer Screening in Primary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Epigenetic mechanisms, especially differential DNA methylation at imprinting control regions (termed DMRs), normally ensure the exclusive expression of imprinted genes from one specific parental allele. We therefore wondered to which extent imprinted genes become deregulated in prostate cancer and, if so, whether deregulation is due to altered DNA methylation at DMRs. Therefore, we selected presumptive deregulated imprinted genes from a previously conducted in silico analysis and from the literature and analyzed their expression in prostate cancer tissues by qRT-PCR. We found significantly diminished expression of PLAGL1/ZAC1, MEG3, NDN, CDKN1C, IGF2, and H19, while LIT1 was significantly overexpressed. The PPP1R9A gene, which is imprinted in selected tissues only, was strongly overexpressed, but was expressed biallelically in benign and cancerous prostatic tissues. Expression of many of these genes was strongly correlated, suggesting co-regulation, as in an imprinted gene network (IGN) reported in mice. Deregulation of the network genes also correlated with EZH2 and HOXC6 overexpression. Pyrosequencing analysis of all relevant DMRs revealed generally stable DNA methylation between benign and cancerous prostatic tissues, but frequent hypo- and hyper-methylation was observed at the H19 DMR in both benign and cancerous tissues. Re-expression of the ZAC1 transcription factor induced H19, CDKN1C and IGF2, supporting its function as a nodal regulator of the IGN. Our results indicate that a group of imprinted genes are coordinately deregulated in prostate cancers, independently of DNA methylation changes.""","""['Teodora Ribarska', 'Wolfgang Goering', 'Johanna Droop', 'Klaus-Marius Bastian', 'Marc Ingenwerth', 'Wolfgang A Schulz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['ETS transcription factors control transcription of EZH2 and epigenetic silencing of the tumor suppressor gene Nkx3.1 in prostate cancer.', 'Specific changes in the expression of imprinted genes in prostate cancer--implications for cancer progression and epigenetic regulation.', 'Altered expression of the imprinted transcription factor PLAGL1 deregulates a network of genes in the human IUGR placenta.', 'Expression changes in EZH2, but not in BMI-1, SIRT1, DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer.', 'EZH2, an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer.', 'PLAGL1 is associated with prognosis and cell proliferation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Molecular Basis of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome Spectrum with Associated Tumors and Consequences for Clinical Practice.', 'The Role of Microbial Factors in Prostate Cancer Development-An Up-to-Date Review.', 'The microbiome and prostate cancer.', 'Turkish Validation and Reliability of the EORTC QLQ-CR29 Quality of Life Scale for Colorectal Cancer.']"""

However, Asian-American men comprise a heterogeneous population with distinct health outcomes. We compared prostate cancer risk profiles among the diverse racial and ethnic groups in California.  Materials and methods:   We used data from the California Cancer Registry on 90,845 nonHispanic white, nonHispanic black and Asian-American men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2010. Patients were categorized into low, intermediate and high risk groups based on clinical stage, Gleason score and prostate specific antigen at diagnosis. Using polytomous logistic regression we estimated adjusted ORs for the association of race/ethnicity and nativity with risk group.  Results:   In addition to the nonHispanic black population, 6 Asian-American groups (United States born Chinese, foreign born Chinese, United States born Japanese, foreign born Japanese, foreign born Filipino and foreign born Vietnamese) were more likely to have an unfavorable risk profile compared to nonHispanic white men. The OR for high vs intermediate risk disease ranged from 1.23 (95% CI 1.02-1.49) for United States born Japanese men to 1.45 (95% CI 1.31-1.60) for foreign born Filipino men. These associations appeared to be driven by higher grade and prostate specific antigen rather than by advanced clinical stage at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   In this large, ethnically diverse, population based cohort Asian-American men were more likely to have an unfavorable risk profile at diagnosis. This association varied by racial/ethnic group and nativity, and was not attributable to later stage at diagnosis.

However, with the advent of targeted biopsy, which may be more accurate than conventional biopsy, we reevaluated the likelihood of reclassification upon confirmatory rebiopsy using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion.  Materials and methods:   We identified 113 men enrolled in active surveillance at our institution who met Epstein criteria and subsequently underwent confirmatory targeted biopsy via multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion. Median patient age was 64 years, median prostate specific antigen was 4.2 ng/ml and median prostate volume was 46.8 cc. Targets or regions of interest on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion were graded by suspicion level and biopsied at 3 mm intervals along the longest axis (median 10.5 mm). Also, 12 systematic cores were obtained during confirmatory rebiopsy. Our reporting is consistent with START (Standards of Reporting for MRI-targeted Biopsy Studies) criteria.  Results:   Confirmatory fusion biopsy resulted in reclassification in 41 men (36%), including 26 (23%) due to Gleason grade 6 or greater and 15 (13%) due to high volume Gleason 6 disease. When stratified by suspicion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion, the likelihood of reclassification was 24% to 29% for target grade 0 to 3, 45% for grade 4 and 100% for grade 5 (p=0.001). Men with grade 4 and 5 vs lower grade targets were greater than 3 times more likely to be reclassified (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.1, p=0.006).  Conclusions:   Upon confirmatory rebiopsy using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion men with high suspicion targets on imaging were reclassified 45% to 100% of the time.

Purpose:   To examine associations of work schedule (i.e., rotating shift work, fixed night and fixed afternoon/evening shift work); sleep duration; and insomnia frequency with prostate cancer mortality.  Methods:   The Cancer Prevention Study-II is a large prospective cohort study of U.S. adults. Work schedule, sleep duration, insomnia frequency, and other information was self-reported in 1982.

In 2013, multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Work schedule and insomnia frequency were not associated with risk of fatal prostate cancer.

Large fraction sizes may increase the risk of functional decrements. Treatment-related bother may be more important to a patient than treatment-related dysfunction. This study reports on patient-reported outcomes following SBRT for clinically localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   Between August 2007 and July 2011, 228 consecutive hormone-naïve patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with 35-36.25 Gy SBRT delivered using the CyberKnife Radiosurgical System (Accuray) in 5 fractions. Quality of life was assessed using the American Urological Association Symptom Score (AUA) and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26. Urinary symptom flare was defined as an AUA score 15 or more with an increase of 5 or more points above baseline 6 months after treatment.  Results:   228 patients (88 low-, 126 intermediate- and 14 high-risk) at a median age of 69 (44-90) years received SBRT with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. EPIC urinary and bowel summary scores declined transiently at 1 month and experienced a second, more protracted decline between 9 months and 18 months before returning to near baseline 2 years post-SBRT. 14.5% of patients experienced late urinary symptom flare following treatment. Patients who experienced urinary symptom flare had poorer bowel quality of life following SBRT. EPIC scores for urinary bother declined transiently, first at 1 month and again at 12 months, before approaching pre-treatment scores by 2 years. Bowel bother showed a similar pattern, but the second decline was smaller and lasted 9 months to 18 months. EPIC sexual summary and bother scores progressively declined over the 2 years following SBRT without recovery.  Conclusions:   In the first 2 years, the impact of SBRT on urination and defecation was minimal. Transient late increases in urinary and bowel dysfunction and bother were observed. However, urinary and bowel function and bother recovered to near baseline by 2 years post-SBRT. Sexual dysfunction and bother steadily increased following treatment without recovery.

We aimed to estimate the effect on overdiagnosis of restricting prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing by age and baseline PSA.  Methods:   Estimates of the effects of age on overdiagnosis were based on population based incidence data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. To investigate the relationship between PSA and overdiagnosis, we used two separate cohorts subject to PSA testing in clinical trials (n = 1,577 and n = 1,197) and a population-based cohort of Swedish men not subject to PSA-screening followed for 25 years (n = 1,162).  Results:   If PSA testing had been restricted to younger men, the number of excess cases associated with the introduction of PSA in the US would have been reduced by 85%, 68% and 42% for age cut-offs of 60, 65 and 70, respectively. The risk that a man with screen-detected cancer at age 60 would not subsequently lead to prostate cancer morbidity or mortality decreased exponentially as PSA approached conventional biopsy thresholds. For PSAs below 1 ng/ml, the risk of a positive biopsy is 65 (95% CI 18.2, 72.9) times greater than subsequent prostate cancer mortality.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer overdiagnosis has a strong relationship to age and PSA level.

Patient age, sPSA level, and polymerase chain reaction data were entered through multiple algorithms to determine models most useful for the detection of cancer and predicting aggressiveness.  Results:   In the first algorithm, we distinguished PCa from BPH (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] of 0.78). Another algorithm distinguished patients with the Gleason score (GS) of ≥7 from GS of <7 cancer or BPH (AUROC of 0.88). By incorporating the two algorithms into a scoring system, 75% of the analyzed samples showed concordance between the two models (99% specificity and 68% sensitivity for predicting GS ≥7 in this group).  Conclusion:   A scoring system incorporating two algorithms using urine and plasma biomarkers highly predicts the presence of GS ≥7 PCa in 75% of patients. Our algorithms may assist with both biopsy indication and patient prognosis.""","""['Wanlong Ma', 'Kevin Diep', 'Herbert A Fritsche', 'Neal Shore', 'Maher Albitar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Genet Test Mol Biomarkers""","""['Expression of PCA3 and PSA genes as a biomarker for differential diagnosis of nodular hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Predicting Prostate Biopsy Results Using a Panel of Plasma and Urine Biomarkers Combined in a Scoring System.', 'Urinary Polyamines: A Pilot Study on Their Roles as Prostate Cancer Detection Biomarkers.', 'Prostate-specific antigen and other serum and urine markers in prostate cancer.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'An Overview of the Cytoskeleton-Associated Role of PDLIM5.', 'Biomarkers That Differentiate Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia from Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Glycans as Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'High expression of PDLIM5 facilitates cell tumorigenesis and migration by maintaining AMPK activation in prostate cancer.', 'A Multi-Center Prospective Study to Validate an Algorithm Using Urine and Plasma Biomarkers for Predicting Gleason ≥3+4 Prostate Cancer on Biopsy.']"""

For this reason, ester prodrugs could be a promising approach in chemotherapy. In this study, we focused on the identification and characterization of differentially expressed esterases between non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells.  Methods:   Cellular lysates from LNCaP, DU 145, and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines, tumorigenic RWPE-2 prostate epithelial cells, and non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells were separated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (n-PAGE) and the esterase activity bands visualized using α-naphthyl acetate or α-naphthyl-N-acetylalaninate (ANAA) chiral esters and Fast Blue RR salt. The esterases were identified using nanospray LC/MS-MS tandem mass spectrometry and confirmed by Western blotting, native electroblotting, inhibition assays, and activity towards a known specific substrate. The serine protease/esterase oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH) was overexpressed in COS-7 cells to verify our results.  Results:   The major esterase observed with the ANAA substrates within the n-PAGE activity bands was identified as OPH. OPH (EC 3.4.19.1) is a serine protease/esterase and a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase family. We found that LNCaP lysates contained approximately 40% more OPH compared to RWPE-1 lysates. RWPE-2, DU145 and PC3 cell lysates had similar levels of OPH activity. OPH within all of the cell lysates tested had a chiral preference for the S-isomer of ANAA. LNCaP cells were stained more intensely with ANAA substrates than RWPE-1 cells and COS-7 cells overexpressing OPH were found to have a higher activity towards the ANAA and AcApNA than parent COS-7 cells.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that prodrug derivatives of ANAA and AcApNA could have potential as chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of prostate cancer tumors that overexpress OPH.""","""['Christopher A McGoldrick', 'Yu-Lin Jiang', 'Victor Paromov', 'Marianne Brannon', 'Koyamangalath Krishnan', 'William L Stone']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['In vitro evaluation of novel N-acetylalaninate prodrugs that selectively induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Iterative design of emetine-based prodrug targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV DPPIV using a tandem enzymatic activation strategy.', 'Characterization of a salivary gland-specific esterase in the vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti.', 'Microbial esterases and ester prodrugs: An unlikely marriage for combating antibiotic resistance.', 'Rational design of organophosphorus hydrolase for altered substrate specificities.', 'A carbapenem antibiotic inhibiting a mammalian serine protease: structure of the acylaminoacyl peptidase-meropenem complex.', 'A Triazolium-Anchored Self-Immolative Linker Enables Self-Assembly-Driven siRNA Binding and Esterase-Induced Release.', 'Cryo-EM structure of acylpeptide hydrolase reveals substrate selection by multimerization and a multi-state serine-protease triad.', 'Valproic Acid Prodrug Affects Selective Markers, Augments Doxorubicin Anticancer Activity and Attenuates Its Toxicity in a Murine Model of Aggressive Breast Cancer.', 'Platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolase IB2 dysregulated cell proliferation in ovarian cancer.']"""

Design:   Cross-sectional.  Setting:   National Program of Cancer Registry (NPCR) Breast and Prostate Cancer Patterns of Care study, which re-abstracted medical records from 2004 in seven cancer registries.  Participants:   Individuals with stage 0-III breast cancer.  Measurements:   Multicomponent guideline-concordant management was modeled based on tumor size, node status, and hormone receptor status, according to consensus guidelines. Comorbid conditions and severity were measured using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation Index (ACE-27). Multivariate logistic regression models determined factors associated with guideline-concordant care and included overall ACE-27 scores and 26 separate ACE comorbidity categories, age, race, stage, and source of payment.  Results:   The study sample included 6,439 women (mean age 58.7, range 20-99; 76% white; 44% with no comorbidity; 70% estrogen- or progesterone-receptor positive, or both; 31% human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive). Care was guideline concordant in 60%. Guideline concordance varied according to overall comorbidity burden (70% for none; 61% for minor; 58% for moderate, 43% for severe; P < .05). In multivariate analysis, the presence of hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.30) predicted guideline concordance, whereas dementia (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.24-0.82) predicted lack of guideline concordance.

This complements anatomic imaging, particularly magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, which is sensitive but not specific. Among the potential harms of false positive findings is lowered adherence to recommended surveillance post-therapy and by persons at increased cancer risk. Positron emission tomography (PET) plus computerized tomography (CT) is the molecular imaging modality most widely used in oncology. In up to 40% of cases, PET-CT leads to changes in therapeutic management. Newer PET tracers can detect tumor hypoxia, bone metastases in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer, and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-expressive tumors. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides insight into several metabolites at the same time. Combined with MRI, this yields magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), which does not entail ionizing radiation and is thus suitable for repeated monitoring. Using advanced signal processing, quantitative information can be gleaned about molecular markers of brain, breast, prostate and other cancers. Radiation oncology has benefited from molecular imaging via PET-CT and MRSI. Advanced mathematical approaches can improve dose planning in stereotactic radiosurgery, stereotactic body radiotherapy and high dose-rate brachytherapy. Molecular imaging will likely impact profoundly on clinical decision making in oncology.

Patients and methods:   All patients had failed standard chemotherapy and were offered only palliative care by their referring oncologist. Karnofsky status was between 50 and 80. Life expectancy was estimated to be between 2 and 6 months. Ten consecutive patients with chemoresistant advanced metastatic cancer were offered compassionate metabolic treatment. They were treated with a combination of lipoic acid at 600 mg i.v. (Thioctacid), hydroxycitrate at 500 mg t.i.d. (Solgar) and low-dose naltrexone at 5 mg (Revia) at bedtime. Primary sites were lung carcinoma (n=2), colonic carcinoma (n=2), ovarian carcinoma (n=1), esophageal carcinoma (n=1), uterine sarcoma (n=1), cholangiocarcinoma (n=1), parotid carcinoma (n=1) and unknown primary (n=1). The patients had been heavily pre-treated. One patient had received four lines of chemotherapy, four patients three lines, four patients two lines and one patient had received radiation therapy and chemotherapy. An eleventh patient with advanced prostate cancer resistant to hormonotherapy treated with hydroxycitrate, lipoic acid and anti-androgen is also reported.  Results:   One patient was unable to receive i.v. lipoic acid and was switched to oral lipoic acid (Tiobec). Toxicity was limited to transient nausea and vomiting. Two patients died of progressive disease within two months. Two other patients had to be switched to conventional chemotherapy combined with metabolic treatment, one of when had a subsequent dramatic tumor response. Disease in the other patients was either stable or very slowly progressive. The patient with hormone-resistant prostate cancer had a dramatic fall in Prostate-Specific Antigen (90%), which is still decreasing.  Conclusion:   These very primary results suggest the lack of toxicity and the probable efficacy of metabolic treatment in chemoresistant advanced carcinoma. It is also probable that metabolic treatment enhances the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy. These results are in line with published animal data.

NBS1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 11,152 prostate cancer specimens. NBS1 expression was absent or only weakly detectable in benign prostate. In prostate cancers, NBS1 expression was found in 81.3% of interpretable tumors and was considered strong in 41.3% of cases. NBS1 upregulation was tightly linked to ERG-positive cancers (p<0.0001). Within ERG-negative cancers, strong NBS1 immunostaining was linked to advanced pathological tumor stage, high Gleason grade, and positive nodal status (p<0.0001 each), while high NBS1 immunostaining was only weakly associated with advanced pathological tumor stage in ERG-positive cancers (p=0.0099). A comparison with chromosomal deletions revealed a strong NBS1 upregulation in PTEN-deleted cancers, while deletions of 3p13, 5q21 and 6q15 did not affect NBS1 expression.

In conclusion, our study identifies an association of NBS1 expression with surrogates of genomic instability in prostate cancer including TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements and PTEN deletion.

The objectives of this study were to examine the patterns of cancer among Nordic firefighters, and to compare them with the results from previous studies.  Methods:   Data for this study were drawn from a linkage between the census data for 15 million people from the five Nordic countries and their cancer registries for the period 1961-2005. SIR analyses were conducted with the cancer incidence rates for the entire national study populations used as reference rates.  Results:   A total of 16 422 male firefighters were included in the final cohort. A moderate excess risk was seen for all cancer sites combined, (SIR=1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11). There were statistically significant excesses in the age category of 30-49 years in prostate cancer (SIR=2.59, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.52) and skin melanoma (SIR=1.62, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.23), while there was almost no excess in the older ages. By contrast, an increased risk, mainly in ages of 70 years and higher, was observed for non-melanoma skin cancer (SIR=1.40, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.76), multiple myeloma (SIR=1.69, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.51), adenocarcinoma of the lung (SIR=1.90, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.62), and mesothelioma (SIR=2.59, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.77). By contrast with earlier studies, the incidence of testicular cancer was decreased (SIR=0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.98).

Methods:   The Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation (CEASAR) study is a population-based, prospective cohort study that enrolled 3691 men with incident prostate cancer during 2011 and 2012. Pretreatment function was ascertained using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index-26 (EPIC-26). Data were stratified by age, comorbidity, and timing of baseline survey completion with respect to treatment. Unadjusted and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relations between exposures and pretreatment function.  Results:   After applying exclusion criteria, the study cohort comprised 3072 men. A strikingly high proportion of men reported inability to obtain erections satisfactory for intercourse (45%) and some degree of urinary incontinence (17%) at baseline. Sexual function was particularly age-sensitive, with patients aged ≤60 years reporting summary scores in excess of 30 points higher than patients aged ≥75 years (P < .001). Compared with the healthiest men, highly comorbid patients reported less favorable function in each domain, including urinary incontinence (summary score, 89.5 vs 74.1; P < .001) and sexual function (summary score, 70.8 vs 32.9; P < .001). Although statistically significant differences in summary scores were identified between patients who completed the baseline questionnaire before treatment (52%) versus after treatment (48%), the absolute differences were small (range, 1-3 points).

The gadolinium(III) chelate (B25716/1) is based on the structure of the heptadentate ligand 1,4-bis(hydroxycarbonylmethyl)-6-[bis(hydroxycarbonylmethyl)]amino-6 methylperhydro-1,4-diazepine (AAZTA) covalently conjugated to an analogue of deoxycholic acid. The study was conducted as a comparison with that of an analogous complex based on the octadentate diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ligand B22956/1 (whose albumin binding properties were previously assessed). The structural modification with respect to B22956/1 leads to a system that can host two coordinated water molecules in fast exchange with bulk water with potential higher efficiency as an MRI contrast agent. On interaction with human serum albumin the expected-field-independent-relaxation enhancement is not observed, possibly as a consequence of the displacement of one of the two inner-sphere water molecules of the gadolinium complex. At clinically relevant magnetic fields, however, the plasma relaxivity of B25716/1 is markedly higher than that shown by B22956/1, owing to concomitant synergistic contributions from the electronic correlation time and water molecules in the second coordination sphere. The capability of B25716/1 to enhance tumor regions in magnetic resonance images was assessed in vivo at 3 T on a xenograft tumor mouse model prepared with PC-3 cells.

Scaffolds, seeded with human primary osteoblasts in conjunction with BMP7, were implanted into immunodeficient mice to form humanized tissue engineered bone constructs (hTEBCs) which consequently resulted in the generation of highly vascularized and viable humanized bone. At 12 weeks, PC3 and LNCaP cells were injected into the hTEBCs. Seven weeks later the mice were euthanized. Micro-CT, histology, TRAP, PTHrP and osteocalcin staining results reflected the different characteristics of the two cell lines regarding their phenotypic growth pattern within bone. Microvessel density, as assessed by vWF staining, showed that tumor vessel density was significantly higher in LNCaP injected hTEBC implants than in those injected with PC3 cells (p < 0.001). Interestingly, PC3 cells showed morphological features of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes suggesting a cellular plasticity within this microenvironment. Taken together, a highly reproducible humanized model was established which is successful in generating LNCaP and PC3 tumors within a complex humanized bone microenvironment.

Research on the relationship between the time courses of triptorelin and testosterone is very important, but accurate quantification of triptorelin and testosterone simultaneously in biological specimens is a challenging analytical problem. In the present study, a rapid, sensitive, and selective method for simultaneous determination of triptorelin and testosterone in rat plasma by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed using a ZORBAX RRHD Eclipse Plus C8 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm) with a 0.05% propionic acid/methanol gradient. In view of the polarity difference between the two analytes, two internal standards, i.e., leuprolide and testosterone-(13)C3, were used for individual quantitation of triptorelin and testosterone. Endogenous testosterone was determined by reference to a calibration curve prepared using testosterone-D3 as a surrogate analyte. The method exhibits excellent linearity over three orders of magnitude for each analyte. The lower limit of quantification was 0.01 ng/mL for triptorelin and 0.05 ng/mL for testosterone, with consumption of 100 μL of plasma.

As a result, there has been a trend to treat high-risk disease with methods other than surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term survival following radical prostatectomy (RRP) for non-metastatic Gleason 8-10 prostate adenocarcinoma (CaP).  Methods:   All patients 75 years or less with Gleason 8-10 CaP that underwent RRP were identified from the SEER 18 database. Patients with metastatic disease, those who underwent other modalities of treatment, or with more than one primary cancer, were excluded. Data were analyzed for demographics, stage at presentation, treatment modality, and overall survival and cancer-specific survival.  Results:   A total of 30,379 men met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 62.5 years and 82.5 % of patients were white. A total of 52.8 % of patients had T2 disease, and 73.1 % had node-negative disease, 80.2 % of patients underwent pelvic lymph node dissection, and 12.9 % underwent adjuvant radiation therapy.

Results:   The study cohort comprised 445 men with a mean age of 63 years (40-77 years). Overall, PE-positive cores were found in 174 men (39.1 %) and R1 status was diagnosed in 132 men after RP (29.7 %). In the multivariate analysis, the presence of at least one PE-positive core was correlated with an increased risk of R1 status (OR 2.29, 95 % CI 1.31-4.00, p = 0.003) and was the strongest predictor followed by Gleason score, PSA and percentage of positive cores.

In this study, we addressed the question in prostate cancer cells, including the response to TGF-β, a critical regulator of migration. In cells expressing wild-type CFL, TGF-β treatment increased LIMK-2 activity and cofilin phosphorylation, decreasing filopodia formation. Conversely, constitutively active CFL (SerAla) promoted filipodia formation and cell migration mediated by TGF-β. Notably, in cocultures of prostate cancer epithelial cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, active CFL promoted invasive migration in response to TGF-β in the microenvironment. Further, constitutively active CFL elevated the metastatic ability of prostate cancer cells in vivo. We found that levels of active CFL correlated with metastasis in a mouse model of prostate tumor and that in human prostate cancer, CFL expression was increased significantly in metastatic tumors.

Results:   The detection rate on the initial fusion biopsy was 55.3%; 336 patients had negative findings. Forty-one patients had follow-up fusion biopsies, but only 34 of these were preceded by a repeat mpMRI. The median interval between biopsies was 15 months. Fourteen patients (41%) were positive for cancer on the repeat MRI-US fusion biopsy. Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, PSA density, digital rectal exam findings, lesion diameter, and changes on imaging were comparable between patients with negative and positive rebiopsies.

The expression levels were correlated with clinicopathologic factors and BCR. During the median follow-up period of 55 months, BCR occurred in 70 cases (17.5%). Low expression of AZGP-1 was noted in 76 cases (19.0%), whereas high expression of hCAP-D3, mucin 1, vimentin, and ERG was observed in 205 (51.3%), 81 (20.3%), 33 (8.3%), and 58 (14.5%) cases, respectively.

Herein we present the design, synthesis and evaluation of fifteen novel hydroxychavicol analogs with varying antiproliferative activities in cancer cell lines from two representative tissue types, namely, the prostate and cervix that show very encouraging results compared to the parent compounds. Our long range goal is to develop a structure-activity guided relationship to gain mechanistic insights into novel molecular targets of this class of bioactive molecules for rational drug development. Cytotoxicity-guided experimentation on these novel analogs yielded the following structural factors as the key activity regulators: 1) unlike the hydroxyl substituent at position-4, the position-3 hydroxyl is vital for enhanced activity 2) acetoxyl groups are dispensable for activity as corroborated earlier by others 3) allylic double bonds at 2'C-3'C serve to positively influence antiproliferative activity 4) long saturated side chains at 1'-position negatively regulate antiproliferative activity and 5) maneuvering position-4 with a benzyl group positively impacted the biological activity profile. Most amphiphilic compounds showed moderate to good therapeutic potential as expected on the basis of medicinal chemistry principles. Intriguingly, the most active compound with ten-fold higher activity than the parent molecule was realized by sheer serendipity to employ a silica gel based rearrangement that was further explored using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.

We measured the spectral binding constants (Ks) using purified and modified human CYP17A1 along with the determination constants (Ki) applying a native human CYP17A1 enzyme in yeast microsomes for these compounds as well as for ketoconazole. For Abi, 3-keto-Δ(4)-Abi, 3-keto-5α-Abi, and 3α-hydroxy-5α-Abi, the type 2 spectral changes gave the best fit for a quadratic equation, since in these experiments Ks values were 0.1-2.6nM, much lower than that for ketoconazole and 3α-hydroxy-Δ(4)-Abi (Ks values were 140 and 1660nM, respectively). Inhibition experiments showed mixed inhibition patterns with Ki values of 7-80nM. Abi dissociation from the CYP17A1-Abi complex was incomplete and slow; the t1/2 for dissociation was 1.8h, with 55% of complex remaining after 5h. We conclude that Abi and the 3 related steroidal azoles (3-keto-Δ(4)-Abi, 3-keto-5α-Abi, and 3α-hydroxy-5α-Abi), which also mimic natural substrates, are extraordinarily potent inhibitors of human CYP17A1, whereas the 3α-hydroxy-Δ(4)-Abi is moderately potent and comparable to ketoconazole.""","""['Mariana Garrido#', 'Hwei-Ming Peng#', 'Francis K Yoshimoto', 'Sunil K Upadhyay', 'Eugene Bratoeff', 'Richard J Auchus']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Clinical and biochemical consequences of CYP17A1 inhibition with abiraterone given with and without exogenous glucocorticoids in castrate men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'CYP17A1 exhibits 17αhydroxylase/17,20-lyase activity towards 11β-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-ketoprogesterone metabolites in the C11-oxy backdoor pathway.', 'CYP17A1-independent production of the neurosteroid-derived 5α-pregnan-3β,6α-diol-20-one in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines under serum starvation and inhibition by Abiraterone.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.', 'Assessment of steroidogenesis and steroidogenic enzyme functions.', 'Human cytochrome P450 17A1 structures with metabolites of prostate cancer drug abiraterone reveal substrate-binding plasticity and a second binding site.', 'Steroidogenic cytochrome P450 17A1 structure and function.', 'Synthesis and Biological Evaluations of Electrophilic Steroids Inspired by the Taccalonolides.', 'Expression in Escherichia Coli, Purification, and Functional Reconstitution of Human Steroid 5α-Reductases.', 'Slow-, Tight-Binding Inhibition of CYP17A1 by Abiraterone Redefines Its Kinetic Selectivity and Dosing Regimen.']"""

AR splicing variants, most of which lack the hinge domain, escape SPOP-mediated degradation. Prostate-cancer-associated mutants of SPOP cannot bind to and promote AR destruction. Furthermore, androgens antagonize SPOP-mediated degradation of AR, whereas antiandrogens promote this process.

In this sense, several groups have proposed genetic polymorphisms as potential susceptibility and prognostic biomarkers; however, their validity has not been proven. Thus, the main goal of the present work was to investigate the potential role of single and combined CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 genotypes as modifiers of cancer survival in Chilean patients with prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   A total of 260 histologically confirmed patients were recruited from a voluntary screening, and genomic DNA was obtained from their blood samples for genotyping analyses to detect the CYP1A1*2A polymorphism and GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletions. The progression of illness and mortality were estimated with a median follow-up of 8.82 years. Adjusted estimated genotype risks were evaluated by hazard ratio and 95% CI using the Cox proportional model. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier survival method and log-rank test were used to evaluate patient survival with regard to genotype.  Results:   The 9-year overall and specific survival rates were 67.6% and 36.6% in the GSTT1null group, 67.6% and 58.7% in the GSTM1non-null group, 69.0% and 51.6% in the *1A/*2A group, 63.9% and 61.5% in the *2A/*2A group vs. 76.2% and 62.3% in the GSTT1non-null group, 82.3% and 50% in the GSTM1null group, and 83.7% and 56.3% in the *1A/*1A group, respectively. The hazard ratios and the Kaplan-Meier curve results demonstrate that the GSTM1non-null, GSTT1null, and CYP1A1*2A genotypes are significantly associated with mortality. Our study has two main limitations: a relatively small sample size and a low global mortality percentage (25.4%); thus, we need to continue the follow-up to confirm these findings.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that the GSTM1non-null, GSTT1null, and CYP1A1*2A genotypes may be good prognosis markers, particularly in patients with high-risk tumors.""","""['Cristián A Acevedo', 'Luis A Quiñones', 'Johanna Catalán', 'Dante D Cáceres', 'Juan A Fullá', 'Angela M Roco']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Positive correlation between single or combined genotypes of CYP1A1 and GSTM1 in relation to prostate cancer in Chilean people.', 'Glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 polymorphisms: susceptibility and outcomes in muscle invasive bladder cancer patients.', 'Polymorphisms of CYP1A1, GSTM1, GSTT1, and prostate cancer risk in Turkish population.', 'Study on the relationship between polymorphisms of Cyp1A1, GSTM1, GSTT1 genes and the susceptibility to acute leukemia in the general population of Hunan province.', 'Association between genetic polymorphisms of metabolic enzymes and susceptibility of colorectal cancer.', 'Polymorphisms in Genes Encoding Glutathione Transferase Pi and Glutathione Transferase Omega Influence Prostate Cancer Risk and Prognosis.', 'Clinical significance and biological mechanisms of glutathione S-transferase mu gene family in colon adenocarcinoma.', 'GSTM1 and GSTT1 Polymorphisms and Susceptibility to Prostate Cancer: A Case-Control Study of the Algerian Population.', 'GSTT1 and GSTM1 null variants in Mestizo and Amerindian populations from northwestern Mexico and a literature review.']"""

The aim of this study was to produce the multipurpose, bivalent [DUPA-6-Ahx-((64)Cu-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] radioligand for prostate cancer imaging, where DUPA = (2-[3-(1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-ureido]pentanedioic acid), a small-molecule, PSMA-targeting probe, 6Ahx = 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5-Ava = 5-aminovaleric acid, NODAGA = [2-(4,7-biscarboxymethyl)-1,4,7-(triazonan-1-yl)pentanedioic acid] (a derivative of NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid)), and BBN(7-14)NH2 = bombesin, a GRPr-specific peptide targeting probe.  Methods:   The PSMA/GRPr dual targeting ligand precursor [DUPA-6-Ahx-K-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2], was synthesized by solid-phase and manual peptide synthesis, after which NODAGA was added via manual conjugation to the ε-amine of lysine (K). The new bivalent GRPr/PSMA targeting vector was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), characterized by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and metallated with (64)CuCl2 and (nat)CuCl2. The receptor binding affinity was evaluated in human, prostate, PC-3 (GRPr-positive) and LNCaP (PSMA-positive) cells and the tumor-targeting efficacy determined in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and athymic nude mice bearing PC-3 and LNCaP tumors. Whole-body maximum intensity microPET/CT images of PC-3/LNCaP tumor-bearing mice were obtained 18 h post-injection (p.i.).  Results:   Competitive binding assays in PC-3 and LNCaP cells indicated high receptor binding affinity for the [DUPA-6-Ahx-((nat)Cu-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] conjugate.

Objective:   To compare outcomes in ECOG PS 0-1 and ≥2 in mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone.  Design, setting, and participants:   Cancer registries from three Canadian centres were used to retrospectively identify mCRPC patients (postdocetaxel and docetaxel-naïve) treated with abiraterone. ECOG PS, clinicopathologic characteristics, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, and survival data were collected.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Survival outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to examine the effect of clinicopathologic characteristics on overall survival (OS) and time to PSA progression.  Results and limitations:   A total of 519 patients were identified; 61% (n=318) and 39% (n=201) were ECOG PS 0-1 and ≥2, respectively. ECOG PS 0-1 patients were significantly more likely than PS ≥2 patients to achieve a PSA decline ≥50% from baseline (45% vs 32%; p=0.003, Fisher exact test) and had significantly longer median time to PSA progression (5.2 mo vs 4.1 mo; p=0.023), median treatment duration (7.4 mo vs 4.5 mo; p<0.001), and median OS (20.0 mo vs 9.1 mo; p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, ECOG PS was a significant factor for OS (p<0.001), time to PSA progression (p=0.043), and PSA decline (p=0.002). Potential limitations include the retrospective study design and subjective nature of ECOG PS classification.  Conclusions:   ECOG PS ≥2 mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone have inferior outcomes compared with ECOG 0-1 patients, especially in regard to OS. These data indicate that early initiation of abiraterone prior to a decline in PS may be warranted.

Limited data are available as it has been a routine treatment option for less than 20 years. This study identified cases of SPC in patients who underwent I-125 prostate brachytherapy as monotherapy in a single institution.  Materials and methods:   SPC incidence was retrieved by conducting a UK cancer registry search (Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry and Information Service) for 1805 consecutive patients with localised prostate cancer who received monotherapy with I-125 brachytherapy from 1995 to 2006 at a single public hospital. Of 1730 UK residents, the completeness of the registry match was 91% (1574 patients). The mean age at treatment (interquartile range) of the cohort was 63 (58-68) years with 1100 patients (70%) over the age of 60 years at treatment. The median (range) follow-up was 8 (6-10) years with 487 patients (31%) having 10 years or more.  Results:   In total, 170 patients (10.8%) were diagnosed with second primaries (1 year or more after implant); 20 of these were bladder and 10 rectal cancers. The 10 year cumulative incidences were 14.6, 1 and 0.84% for any second malignancy, bladder and rectal cancer, respectively. Only the standardised incidence rate (SIR) for bladder cancer was higher at 1.54 (95% confidence interval 0.96-2.46) compared with the general population. The SIR for bladder cancer was higher in the first few years after treatment, suggesting that the increased incidence of bladder cancer is due to increased urological surveillance.  Conclusions:   Overall, the incidence of SPC after I-125 is comparable with other published data with no significant excess more than 5 years from treatment.

The increasing age of donors and recipients also increases the risk of developing malignancies, including genitourinary. The aim of this study is to analyze clinical aspects and management of this complication.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1365 patients who underwent renal transplantation between 1977 and 2010 who were 44.6 ± 14.9 years old at the time of transplantation. The median follow-up was 95.6 months (range, 18.0-236.0). Data were analyzed for sex, age, time from transplant to diagnosis, location, clinical stage, immunosuppression, treatment, follow-up, and evolution.  Results:   We diagnosed 25 de novo urologic neoplasms (25/1365; 1.8%) in 24 patients, with a median follow-up of 32 months (range, 12.5-51.8) from the diagnosis. Sixteen were male (66.7%) and 8 female (33.3%), with a median age at diagnosis of 59 years (range, 56.0-65.5). The median time between the transplant and the diagnosis of the malignancy was 69 months (range, 40.0-116.5). There were 11 renal cell carcinomas (RCC; 11/25; 44%), 8 in native kidney and 3 in renal allograft; 9 prostate cancers (PCa; 9/25; 36%), 8 localized and 1 metastatic; and 5 transitional cell carcinomas (TCC; 5/25; 20%), 3 in bladder and 2 in renal allograft pelvis. Treatments performed were similar to those used in the nontransplanted population. RCC were treated with radical nephrectomy when affecting the native kidney, partial nephrectomy when affecting the allograft, or immunotherapy when metastatic. Patients with localized PCa were treated with radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or androgenic deprivation if there were comorbidities, and those metastatic with hormonal deprivation. Bladder TCCs were treated with transurethral resection or radical cystectomy. Pelvis TCCs affecting the allograft were treated with radical nephroureterectomy of the allograft including bladder cuff and pelvic lymphadenectomy.  Conclusions:   There exists an increased incidence of urologic tumors in kidney transplant recipients. Conventional treatments of these tumors are technically feasible. The risk of developing these tumors remains even in the long term. Because of their suitability for curative treatments, it is advisable to perform periodic screening for urologic cancers to achieve an early diagnosis.""","""['V Hevia', 'V Gómez', 'V Díez Nicolás', 'S Alvarez', 'C Gómez Del Cañizo', 'C Galeano', 'A Gomis', 'J M García-Sagredo', 'R Marcen', 'F J Burgos']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Transplant Proc""","""['Urologic malignancies in renal transplant candidates and recipients.', 'Transitional cell carcinoma in renal transplant recipients: a single center experience.', 'De novo urological neoplasms in kidney transplant patients: experience in 1,751 patients.', 'The role of microscopic hematuria in the evaluation of urologic malignancy in renal transplant recipients.', 'De novo urologic tumors in kidney transplant patients.', 'Radical cystectomy, bilateral lymphadenectomy and native ureteral ligation in a patient with history of kidney transplantation.', 'Immunosuppressive treatment and radiotherapy in kidney transplant patients: A systematic review.', 'Current Status of Malignant Tumors after Organ Transplantation.', 'Urological Cancers and Kidney Transplantation: a Literature Review.', 'Radical Cystectomy and Ileal Conduit Diversion for Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma With Sarcomatoid and Squamous Variants After Renal Transplantation.']"""

Methods:   168 patients who underwent RRP were compared to 171 patients who underwent LRP at our institution. Pathological and functional outcomes including postoperative urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction (ED) of the two cohorts were examined.  Results:   Patients had bilateral, unilateral and no nerve sparing technique performed in 83.3%, 1.8% and 14.9% of cases for RRP and 23.4%, 22.8% and 53.8% of cases for LRP, respectively (p < 0.001). Overall positive surgical margin rates were 22.2% among patients who underwent RRP compared to 26.5% of patients who underwent LRP (p = 0.435). Based upon pads/day, urinary continence postoperatively was achieved in 83.2% and 82.8% for RRP and LRP, respectively (p = 0.872). Analysis on postoperative ED was limited due to lack of information on the preoperative erectile status. However, postoperatively there were no differences with respect to ED between the two cohorts (p = 0.151). Based on ICIQ-scores, surgeons with more experience had lower rates of postoperative incontinence irrespective of surgical technique (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001 for continuous and stratified data, respectively).  Conclusions:   RRP and LRP represent effective surgical approaches for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. Pathological outcomes are excellent for both surgical techniques.

The authors propose a BED formalism that includes all the four biological effects (4Rs), and the authors propose how it can be used to calculate appropriate prescription doses for permanent implants with Cs-131.  Methods:   A resensitization correction was added to the BED calculation for permanent implants to account for 4Rs. Using the same BED, the prescription doses with Au-198, I-125, and Pd-103 were converted to the isoeffective Cs-131 prescription doses. The conversion factor F, ratio of the Cs-131 dose to the equivalent dose with the other reference isotope (Fr: with resensitization, Fn: without resensitization), was thus derived and used for actual prescription. Different values of biological parameters such as α, β, and relative biological effectiveness for different types of tumors were used for the calculation.  Results:   Prescription doses with I-125, Pd-103, and Au-198 ranging from 10 to 160 Gy were converted into prescription doses with Cs-131. The difference in dose conversion factors with (Fr) and without (Fn) resensitization was significant but varied with different isotopes and different types of tumors. The conversion factors also varied with different doses. For I-125, the average values of Fr/Fn were 0.51/0.46, for fast growing tumors, and 0.88/0.77 for slow growing tumors. For Pd-103, the average values of Fr/Fn were 1.25/1.15 for fast growing tumors, and 1.28/1.22 for slow growing tumors. For Au-198, the average values of Fr/Fn were 1.08/1.25 for fast growing tumors, and 1.00/1.06 for slow growing tumors. Using the biological parameters for the HeLa/C4-I cells, the averaged value of Fr was 1.07/1.11 (rounded to 1.1), and the averaged value of Fn was 1.75/1.18. Fr of 1.1 has been applied to gynecological cancer implants with expected acute reactions and outcomes as expected based on extensive experience with permanent implants. The calculation also gave the average Cs-131 dose of 126 Gy converted from the I-125 dose of 144 Gy for prostate implants.  Conclusions:   Inclusion of an allowance for resensitization led to significant dose corrections for Cs-131 permanent implants, and should be applied to prescription dose calculation. The adjustment of the Cs-131 prescription doses with resensitization correction for gynecological permanent implants was consistent with clinical experience and observations. However, the Cs-131 prescription doses converted from other implant doses can be further adjusted based on new experimental results, clinical observations, and clinical outcomes.""","""['Wei Luo', 'Janelle Molloy', 'Prakash Aryal', 'Jonathan Feddock', 'Marcus Randall']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['SU-E-T-462: Calculation of Prescribed Dose for Permanent Implant with Cs-131 Using LQ Equation including Resensitization.', 'Prescription dose in permanent (131)Cs seed prostate implants.', 'Implementation and early clinical results utilizing Cs-131 permanent interstitial implants for gynecologic malignancies.', 'Recommendations of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine regarding the impact of implementing the 2004 task group 43 report on dose specification for 103Pd and 125I interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Uncertainties Associated with Clonogenic Assays using a Cs-137 Irradiator and Ir-192 Afterloader: A Comprehensive Compilation for Radiation Researchers.', 'The role of brachytherapy in the management of brain metastases: a systematic review.', 'RNA Nanoparticles Derived from Three-Way Junction of Phi29 Motor pRNA Are Resistant to I-125 and Cs-131 Radiation.']"""

In the presence of inhomogeneous dose distributions produced by intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric arc therapy, this may be a limitation. We present a model to quantify the spatial characteristics of the dose distribution on the rectum through the quantification of the distribution of distances between dose points on the surface of the rectum in three-dimensions. The method allows us to evaluate the hypothesis that distances between lower and higher dose regions on the rectum influence radiation damage repair due to the migration of normal cells into damaged areas, and consequently, the development of radiation-induced toxicity in patients treated with radiation for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We present a method to compute distances between dose points on the surface of the rectum in three dimensions (3D) and to generate distance maps representing the distances between specific dose regions on the rectum. We introduce the concept of the distance dose surface histogram (DDSH), which is computed from the distance maps. The DDSH is a 2D histogram of rectum area on a grid defined by pairwise combinations of dose and distance. Each bin in the DDSH quantifies the area of the rectum exposed to a given dose and at a given distance from other another dose region on the rectum. By summing across the columns and rows of the DDSH, the authors can generate the dose surface histogram (DSH) and distance surface histogram (DiSH) for a particular dose region. The DiSH is a marginal histogram showing the distribution of distances for the dose points in a specific dose region from another region. We computed the DDSH, DiSH, and DSH for 33 patients treated with IMRT for prostate cancer, nine of whom developed late Grade 2 or higher late rectal toxicity.  Results:   We show how even though the total area of the rectum exposed to a given dose may be the same for different patients, the distribution of distances for points receiving that dose can be different depending on the shape and contiguity of the region(s) containing those dose points. We also show that area of the rectum in the region receiving more than 75 Gy and at a distance of 16 to 22 mm from the 50 Gy isodose line was significantly correlated to the development of toxicity (p = 0.004, two sided t-test). This suggests that examining the distance distribution of points in specific dose regions could provide valuable additional information in predicting the risk of a patient developing radiation-induced rectal toxicity.  Conclusions:   We present a new method to quantify the spatial distribution of points in a given region relative to other regions on the rectum. The method provides a means to evaluate the hypothesis that distances between lower and higher dose regions on the rectum influence radiation damage repair due to the migration of normal cells into damaged areas, and may be a contributing factor to the development of radiation-induced toxicity in patients treated with radiation for prostate cancer.""","""['Reshma Munbodh', 'Andrew Jackson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Late toxicity after intensity-modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: an exploration of dose-volume histogram parameters to limit genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity.', 'Acute toxicity after image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy compared to 3D conformal radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Dosimetric and anatomic indicators of late rectal toxicity after high-dose intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Proposed rectal dose constraints for patients undergoing definitive whole pelvic radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'In vitro radiotherapy and chemotherapy alter migration of brain cancer cells before cell death.', 'Image-based Data Mining to Probe Dosimetric Correlates of Radiation-induced Trismus.', 'Investigating rectal toxicity associated dosimetric features with deformable accumulated rectal surface dose maps for cervical cancer radiotherapy.', 'Inter-institutional analysis demonstrates the importance of lower than previously anticipated dose regions to prevent late rectal bleeding following prostate radiotherapy.', 'Prostate external beam radiotherapy combined with high-dose-rate brachytherapy: dose-volume parameters from deformably-registered plans correlate with late gastrointestinal complications.']"""

To date, the tools for quantitative assessment of IMRT beam complexity are still lacking. In this study, The authors have sought to develop metrics to characterize different aspects of beam complexity and investigate the beam complexity for IMRT plans of different disease sites.  Methods:   The authors evaluated the beam complexity scores for 65 step-and-shoot IMRT plans from three sites (prostate, head and neck, and spine) and 26 volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans for the prostate. On the basis of the beam apertures and monitor unit weights of all segments, the authors calculated the mean aperture area, extent of aperture shape irregularity, and degree of beam modulation for each beam. Then the beam complexity values were averaged to obtain the complexity metrics of the IMRT plans. The authors studied the correlation between the beam complexity metrics and the quality assurance (QA) results. Finally, the effects of treatment planning parameters on beam complexity were studied.  Results:   The beam complexity scores were not uniform among the prostate IMRT beams from different gantry angles. The lateral beams had larger monitor units and smaller shape irregularity, while the anterior-posterior beams had larger modulation values. On average, the prostate IMRT plans had the smallest aperture irregularity, beam modulation, and normalized monitor units; the head and neck IMRT plans had large beam irregularity and beam modulation; and the spine stereotactic radiation therapy plans often had small beam apertures, which may have been associated with the relatively large discrepancies between planned and QA measured doses. There were weak correlations between the beam complexity scores and the measured dose errors. The prostate VMAT beams showed greater complexity than the prostate step-and-shoot IMRT beams. In the treatment planning process, the beam complexity increased as the minimum segment area decreased and as the number of optimization iterations and the maximum number of segments increased.  Conclusions:   The proposed metrics were effective in characterizing the beam complexity of different disease sites and for different treatment modalities.

To address this challenge, the authors have proposed a strategy referred to as Multiple Adaptive Planning (MAP). To minimize the number of MAP plans, the authors' previous work only considered the prostate motion in one major direction. After analyzing the pattern of the prostate motion, the authors investigated a practical number of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans needed to accommodate the prostate motion in two major directions simultaneously.  Methods:   Six patients, who received concurrent irradiation of the prostate and PLNs, were selected for this study. Nine MAP-IMRT plans were created for each patient with nine prostate contours that represented the prostate at nine locations with respect to the PLNs, including the original prostate contour and eight contours shifted either 5 mm in a single anterior-posterior (A-P), or superior-inferior (S-I) direction, or 5 mm in both A-P and S-I directions simultaneously. From archived megavoltage cone beam CT (MV-CBCT) and a dual imaging registration, 17 MV-CBCTs from 33 available MV-CBCT from these patients showed large prostate displacements (>3 mm in any direction) with respect to the pelvic bones. For each of these 17 fractions, one of nine MAP-IMRT plans was retrospectively selected and applied to the MV-CBCT for dose calculation. For comparison, a simulated isocenter-shifting plan and a reoptimized plan were also created for each of these 17 fractions. The doses to 95% (D95) of the prostate and PLNs, and the doses to 5% (D5) of the rectum and bladder were calculated and analyzed.  Results:   For the prostate, D95 > 97% of the prescription dose was observed in 16, 16, and 17 of 17 fractions for the MAP, isocenter-shifted, and reoptimized plans, respectively. For PLNs, D95 > 97% of the prescription doses was observed in 10, 3, and 17 of 17 fractions for the three types of verification plans, respectively. The D5 (mean ± SD) of the rectum was 45.78 ± 5.75, 45.44 ± 4.64, and 44.64 ± 2.71 Gy, and the D5 (mean ± SD) of the bladder was 45.18 ± 2.70, 46.91 ± 3.04, and 45.67 ± 3.61 Gy for three types of verification plans, respectively.

Methods:   An electromagnetic transponder-based positioning system (Calypso) was modified to send the target position output to in-house-developed MLC tracking code, which adjusts the leaf positions to optimally align the treatment beam with the real-time target position. Clinical process and quality assurance procedures were developed and performed. The first clinical implementation of electromagnetic transponder-guided MLC tracking was for a prostate cancer patient being treated with dual-arc VMAT (RapidArc). For the first fraction of the first patient treatment of electromagnetic transponder-guided MLC tracking we recorded the in-room time and transponder positions, and performed dose reconstruction to estimate the delivered dose and also the dose received had MLC tracking not been used.  Results:   The total in-room time was 21 min with 2 min of beam delivery. No additional time was needed for MLC tracking and there were no beam holds. The average prostate position from the initial setup was 1.2 mm, mostly an anterior shift. Dose reconstruction analysis of the delivered dose with MLC tracking showed similar isodose and target dose volume histograms to the planned treatment and a 4.6% increase in the fractional rectal V60.

A multi-site replication study""","""Although psychological resilience has been shown to 'buffer' against depression following major stressors, no studies have reported on this relationship within the prostate cancer (PCa) population, many of whom are at elevated risk of depression, health problems and suicide. To investigate the effects of resilience upon anxiety and depression in the PCa population, postal surveys of 425 PCa patients were collected from two sites: 189 PCa patients at site 1 and 236 at site 2. Background data plus responses to depression and resilience scales were collected. Results indicated that total resilience score was a significant buffer against depression across both sites. Resilience had different underlying component factor structures across sites, but only one (common) factor significantly (inversely) predicted depression. Within that factor, only some specific items significantly predicted depression scores, suggesting a focused relationship between resilience and depression. It may be concluded that measures of resilience may be used to screen depression at-risk PCa patients. These patients might benefit from resilience training to enhance their ability to cope effectively with the stress of their diagnosis and treatment. A focus upon specific aspects of overall resilience may be of further benefit in both these processes.""","""['C F Sharpley', 'V Bitsika', 'A C Wootten', 'D R H Christie']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Care (Engl)""","""['Variability over time-since- diagnosis in the protective effect of psychological resilience against depression in Australian prostate cancer patients: implications for patient treatment models.', 'African-centered coping, resilience, and psychological distress in Black prostate cancer patients.', 'Predictors of depression, anxiety and quality of life in patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Variability in anxiety and depression over time following diagnosis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Psychological resilience in sport performers: a review of stressors and protective factors.', 'Which Aspects of Psychological Resilience Moderate the Association between Deterioration in Sleep and Depression in Patients with Prostate Cancer?', 'The mediation role of psychological capital between family relationship and antenatal depressive symptoms among women with advanced maternal age: a cross sectional study.', 'The Importance of Social Support, Optimism and Resilience on the Quality of Life of Cancer Patients.', 'Examining the Relationship between Depression, Anxiety and Stress in Kidney Cancer Patients.', 'Coping Styles for Mediating the Effect of Resilience on Depression Among Medical Students in Web-Based Classes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study.']"""

Conversely, hypoxia is thought to be an etiological factor in the pathogenesis of cavernosal fibrosis and long-term erectile dysfunction. It has been hypothesized that the early penile hypoxia after radical prostatectomy (RP) may lead to fibrosis and consequently a decrease in stretched penile length and long-term erectile dysfunction.  Aim:   The aim of this study was to assess the changes in penile tissue oxygenation with vacuum erection device (VED) use.  Methods:   Twenty men between 2 and 24 months following RP were enrolled prospectively. Each man cycled a VED to achieve full erection 10 consecutive times over a period of approximately 2 minutes without constriction ring.  Main outcome measures:   Tissue oximetry was measured at baseline and immediately after VED using a tissue oximeter at five sites: right thigh, right corpora, glans, left corpora, and left thigh. Additional measurements were captured over the course of an hour.  Results:   Mean age and time from surgery was 58.2 years and 12.6 months, respectively, and the average Sexual Health Inventory for Men score was 7. Use of the VED significantly increased both glanular and corporal oximetry relative to the baseline values for the entire 60 minutes. An initial increase of 55% was seen in corporal oxygenation with VED use.  Conclusions:   This is the first study demonstrating that a single, brief application of the VED without a constriction ring results in significant improvement in penile oxygen saturation. The use of a VED has significant benefits for patients both with regard to cost and invasiveness when compared with other penile rehabilitation protocols.""","""['R Charles Welliver Jr', 'Clay Mechlin', 'Brianne Goodwin', 'Joseph P Alukal', 'Andrew R McCullough']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['A pilot study on the early use of the vacuum erection device after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Optimal strategy for penile rehabilitation after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy based on preoperative erectile function.', 'Predicting participation in and successful outcome of a penile rehabilitation programme using a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor with a vacuum erection device after radical prostatectomy.', 'Vacuum therapy in erectile dysfunction--science and clinical evidence.', 'Application of the vacuum erectile device in penile rehabilitation for erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy.', 'Erectile Dysfunction: Treatments, Advances and New Therapeutic Strategies.', 'A prospective randomized controlled study on scheduled PDE5i and vacuum erectile devices in the treatment of erectile dysfunction after nerve sparing prostatectomy.', 'Indications and characteristics of penile traction and vacuum erection devices.', 'Association between masturbation and functional outcome in the postoperative course after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Adding a vacuum erection device to regular use of Tadalafil improves penile rehabilitation after posterior urethroplasty.']"""

Substantial numbers of patients on active surveillance (AS) are eventually treated.  Material and methods:   Prostate cancer patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in the NCI-AvL (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) received systematic QoL questionnaires preoperatively and postoperatively. Questionnaires included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Module and Prostate Module (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-PR25), International Index of Erectile Function-15 (IIEF-15) and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ-SF). Patients with low-risk prostate cancer who received RARP after an initial period of AS (AS-RARP group) were compared with similar patients who primarily elected surgery (direct-RARP group).  Results:   The AS-RARP group included 29 patients who received RARP after a median period of 15.4 months of AS (range 3.0-18.8 months). Main reasons for deferred radical therapy were repeat biopsy risk reclassification (45%) and prostate-specific antigen progression (38%). The direct-RARP group included 363 patients treated after 3.3 months (range 0.1-45.5 months). RARP generally resulted in clinically relevant unfavourable changes on different QoL domains in both groups. Preoperatively the AS-RARP group showed more favourable scores on multiple QoL domains (physical functioning, p = 0.004; role functioning, p = 0.001; global health, p = 0.043; sexual activity, p = 0.001; sexual functioning, p = 0.029; IIEF-15, p = 0.042). Postoperatively, most of these more favourable scores in the AS-RARP group had changed to scores similar to the direct-RARP group, except for IIEF-15 (p = 0.027) and urinary symptoms (p = 0.001). When using a 12 month treatment delay threshold, a similar but less distinct effect was seen.

Here, we show that retinoic acid (RA) regulates early human prostate epithelial differentiation by activating a tightly coexpressed set of 80 genes (e.g., TMPRSS2). Response kinetics suggested that some of these genes could be direct RA targets, whereas others are probably responding indirectly to RA stimulation. Comparative bioinformatic analyses of published tissue-specific microarrays and a large-scale transcriptomic data set revealed that these 80 genes are not only RA responsive but also significantly coexpressed in many human cell systems.

Experimental design:   Glycosyltransferase expression was profiled in metastasis-derived prostate cancer cell lines and compared with primary epithelium. Prostate cancer cells were examined for HPA- and selectin-binding and adhesion to endothelium. Spontaneous metastasis xenograft models were established to test the lectin HPA-binding sites as a marker of metastatic competence and to evaluate E-selectin-binding sites in vivo. The importance of selectins for metastasis formation was analyzed using Sele(-/-)/Selp(-/-) mice. The clinical relevance of HPA- and E-selectin-binding sites in prostate cancer was determined.  Results:   Glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of common HPA-binding sites are downregulated in prostate cancer cells. An absence of HPA-reactive carbohydrates specifically indicates spontaneous metastatic spread of prostate cancer xenografts in vivo and a poor prognosis of patients with prostate cancer. HPA-binding sites decrease in lymph node metastases compared with corresponding primary tumors. Common selectin ligands are absent on prostate cancer cells, which do not adhere to recombinant selectins or endothelium under shear stress in vitro. Spontaneous metastasis formation is largely independent of selectins in vivo. E-selectin-binding sites are detectable in only 2% of patients with prostate cancer without prognostic significance.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer is characterized by an inverse functional and prognostic importance of HPA-binding sites compared with other adenocarcinomas. Accordingly, this study surprisingly shows that the selectin-selectin ligand axis, which is essential for extravasation and thus metastasis formation in several malignancies, can be circumvented in prostate cancer.""","""['Tobias Lange', 'Mareike Kupfernagel', 'Daniel Wicklein', 'Florian Gebauer', 'Hanna Maar', 'Kathrin Brügge', 'Imke Müller', 'Ronald Simon', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Guido Sauter', 'Udo Schumacher']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Human prostate cancer in a clinically relevant xenograft mouse model: identification of β(1,6)-branched oligosaccharides as a marker of tumor progression.', 'Rolling of human bone-metastatic prostate tumor cells on human bone marrow endothelium under shear flow is mediated by E-selectin.', 'Identification of leukocyte E-selectin ligands, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and E-selectin ligand-1, on human metastatic prostate tumor cells.', 'Selectins promote tumor metastasis.', 'The involvement of Helix pomatia lectin (HPA) binding N-acetylgalactosamine glycans in cancer progression.', 'Tumor cell integrin β4 and tumor stroma E-/P-selectin cooperatively regulate tumor growth in vivo.', 'Tumor cell E-selectin ligands determine partialefficacy of bortezomib on spontaneous lung metastasis formation of solid human tumors in\xa0vivo.', 'Opposing prognostic relevance of junction plakoglobin in distinct prostate cancer patient subsets.', 'Systematic analysis of the human tumor cell binding to human vs. murine E- and P-selectin under static vs. dynamic conditions.', 'Modeling Spontaneous Bone Metastasis Formation of Solid Human Tumor Xenografts in Mice.']"""

In operated renal tumors, positive margins or extracapsular extension show a positive impact of postoperative RT, with a reduction of relapses between 100% and 30%, while, in the case of palliation, treatments with RT at high doses are preferred. In advanced cancers of the upper urinary tract, RT plays a limited role, even if it seems to increase the level of disease control locally and, with the combination of cisplatin, survival rates too. An important reduction in the recurrence is also observed in locally advanced tumors of the urethra, with a recurrence of 60% after surgery, 36% after RT and 25% after pairing of the two. In locally advanced tumors of the penis, RT shows poorer results than surgery, and the addition of postoperative RT does not seem to add any further outcome, except where, in the presence of a positive inguinal dissection, the postoperative RT reduces lymph node recurrences by 60%-11%. Interesting data for the preservation of the organ are reported with reference to the combination with chemotherapy. In the tumors of the testis, it is still disputable whether the treatment of residual masses after chemotherapy may be appropriate, with a view to a possible salvage radiotherapy. In the treatment of the prostate, the role of RT is consolidated and evolving with the progress of dose escalation, the association with hormonal therapy, new technologies, new possibilities of IMRT and proton therapy and various studies on multi-modal approaches (hormone therapy, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy). Cystectomy is the gold standard for the treatment of locally advanced bladder cancer, even though there is a revived interest in multimodal treatments (transurethral resection, chemotherapy, RT) that may allow the organ preservation. Postoperative radiotherapy, which can reduce by 50% to 20%-5% local recurrences that are highly correlated with distance failure and with survival, should be revised in the light of modern RT techniques that can further increase local control levels and reduce the toxicity significantly.""","""['Roberto Bortolus']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['Palliative radiation therapy of symptomatic recurrent bladder cancer.', 'Bladder cancer patterns of pelvic failure: implications for adjuvant radiation therapy.', 'Strategies for the management of recurrent and advanced urologic cancers.

However, information of SALL4 distribution in normal human tissues and non-germ cell tumors is limited. In this study we examined normal human tissues and 3215 tumors for SALL4 expression using a monoclonal antibody 6E3 and automated immunohistochemistry. In a 10-week embryo, SALL4 was expressed in ovocytes, intestine, kidney, and some hepatocytes. In adult tissues, it was only detected in germ cells. SALL4 was consistently expressed in all germ cell tumors except some trophoblastic tumors and mature components of teratomas, in which it was selectively expressed in intestinal-like and some squamous epithelia. In non-germ cell carcinomas, SALL4 was detected in 20% of cases or more of serous carcinoma of the ovary, urothelial high-grade carcinoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma (especially the intestinal type). SALL4 was only rarely (≤ 5%) expressed in mammary, colorectal, prostatic, and squamous cell carcinomas. Many SALL4-positive carcinomas showed poorly differentiated patterns, and some showed positivity in most tumor cells mimicking the expression in germ cell tumors. SALL4 was commonly expressed in rhabdoid tumors of the kidney and extrarenal sites and in the Wilms tumor. Expression of SALL4 was rare in other mesenchymal and neuroendocrine tumors but was occasionally detected in melanoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, epithelioid sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. All hematopoietic tumors were negative. SALL4 is an excellent marker of nonteratomatous germ cell tumors, but it is also expressed in other tumors, sometimes extensively. Such expression may reflect stem cell-like differentiation and must be considered when using SALL4 as a marker for germ cell tumors. Observed lack of other pluripotency factors, OCT4 and NANOG, in SALL4-positive non-germ cell tumors can also be diagnostically helpful.""","""['Markku Miettinen', 'Zengfeng Wang', 'Peter A McCue', 'Maarit Sarlomo-Rikala', 'Janusz Rys', 'Wojciech Biernat', 'Jerzy Lasota', 'Yi-Shan Lee']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Diagnostic utility of SALL4 in primary germ cell tumors of the central nervous system: a study of 77 cases.', 'The zinc-finger transcription factor SALL4 is frequently expressed in human cancers: association with clinical outcome in squamous cell carcinoma but not in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.', 'SALL4 is a novel sensitive and specific marker for metastatic germ cell tumors, with particular utility in detection of metastatic yolk sac tumors.', 'Germ cell tumors of the gonads: a selective review emphasizing problems in differential diagnosis, newly appreciated, and controversial issues.', 'Immunohistochemistry as a diagnostic aid in the evaluation of ovarian tumors.', 'Expression of stem cell markers SALL4, LIN28A, and KLF4 in ameloblastoma.', 'Testicular Germ Cell Tumor Tissue Biomarker Analysis: A Comparison of Human Protein Atlas and Individual Testicular Germ Cell Tumor Component Immunohistochemistry.', 'The new advance of SALL4 in cancer: Function, regulation, and implication.', 'Germinoma Misdiagnosed as Lymphocytic Hypophysitis.', 'Risk Factors for Testicular Cancer: Environment, Genes and Infections-Is It All?']"""

Hence, we sought to determine the GNAS status of incipient IPMNs to better classify these lesions. Incipient IPMNs from 3 institutions were histologically reassessed, manually microdissected, and the genomic DNA was extracted. Using a sensitive digital ligation technique, the mutational status of KRAS at codon 12 and GNAS at codon 201 was determined. We included 21 incipient IPMNs from 7 male and 12 female patients with a median age of 63 years (range, 40 to 76 y). Most patients underwent surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (N = 8) or ampullary adenocarcinoma (N = 3).

We hypothesized that cancer within 0.1 mm of the margin conferred an increased risk for BCR. We determined the risk for BCR on the bass of surgical margin status in a cohort of 1588 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer (PCa) between 1998 and 2011. Surgical margins were categorized as positive, close (<0.1 mm from tumor cells), or negative. Multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) for BCR were determined by margin status. We identified 1588 patients, of whom 193 had PCa recurrence. The margin status was negative in 1058 (67%), close in 232 (15%), and positive in 298 (19%). Cancer that was close to the margin was a significant and independent predictor of BCR (HR 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.32) and was not statistically different than a positive surgical margin (HR 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-2.99).

We established resistant IGR-CaP1 prostate cancer cell lines for different doses of Docetaxel. We investigated gene expression profiles by microarray analyses in these cell lines and generated a signature of 99 highly differentially expressed genes potentially implicated in chemoresistance. We focused on the role of the cell cycle regulator LZTS1, which was under-expressed in the Docetaxel-resistant cell lines, its inhibition resulting from the promoter methylation. Knockdown of LZTS1 in parental cells with siRNA showed that LZTS1 plays a role in the acquisition of the resistant phenotype. Furthermore, we observed that targeting CDC25C, a partner of LZTS1, with the NSC663284 inhibitor specifically killed the Docetaxel-resistant cells. To further investigate the role of CDC25C, we used inhibitors of the mitotic kinases that regulate CDC25C. Inhibition of CHEK1 and PLK1 induced growth arrest and cell death in the resistant cells.

However, anethole didnot decrease the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT while PTEN was silenced. Furthermore, the CXCR4 inhibition of anethole was not caused to proteasomal or lysosomal of CXCR4.

In IAS therapy, drugs are administrated only in on-treatment periods that are separated intermittently by off-treatment periods. The presence of off-treatment periods may be beneficial for maintaining the sensitivity of the tumor cells to androgen deprivation. Thus, IAS can be superior to continuous androgen suppression (CAS) for delaying or possibly preventing relapse of a tumor. IAS therapy usually monitors the level of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is related to the population of tumor cells. Each on-treatment period begins when the PSA level is greater than an upper threshold; treatment results in a decrease in the PSA level. The on-treatment period is suspended when the PSA level falls below a lower threshold; the PSA level then rises again until the beginning of the next on-treatment period. To determine the transitions between on- and off-treatment periods, we propose a new IAS protocol that uses a model-based estimate of the state point in the phase space of the tumor dynamics. We show that the proposed protocol is effective if, in each of the on- and off-treatment periods, the tumor dynamics exhibits a saddle-point instability accompanied by a stable manifold. Mathematical analysis reveals that tumor dynamics can be controlled in a more effective and robust manner with the proposed protocol than with conventional IAS. We also discuss the clinical feasibility of the proposed protocol as an alternative to conventional IAS therapy.""","""['Yasuyuki Suzuki', 'Daichi Sakai', 'Taishin Nomura', 'Yoshito Hirata', 'Kazuyuki Aihara']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['Intermittent androgen suppression in prostate cancer: an update of the Vancouver experience.', 'Hormone release and intermittent hormonal therapy in the LN CaP model of human prostate cancer.', 'Nonlinear system identification for prostate cancer and optimality of intermittent androgen suppression therapy.', 'Intermittent complete androgen blockade in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Mathematical modelling of prostate cancer growth and its application to hormone therapy.', 'International survey of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for non-metastatic prostate cancer in 19 countries.']"""

Methods:   The study population comprised 68 967 cases of cancer diagnosed between 1997 and 2009 in Normandy and collected by the local registries. The social environment was assessed at an aggregated level using the European Deprivation Index (EDI). The association between incidence and socioeconomic status was assessed by a Bayesian Poisson model and the excess of cases was calculated with the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF).  Results:   For lung, lips-mouth-pharynx and unknown primary sites, a higher incidence in deprived was observed for both sexes. The same trend was observed in males for bladder, liver, esophagus, larynx, central nervous system and gall-bladder and in females for cervix uteri.

Cancer stem cells (CSC) contribute to chemoresistance in many solid tumors including gliomas. The function of prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) as a pro-apoptotic protein is well documented in many cancers; however, its role in CSC remains obscure. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of Par-4 in drug-induced cytotoxicity using human glioma stem cell line--HNGC-2 and primary culture (G1) derived from high grade glioma. We show that among the panel of drugs- lomustine, carmustine, UCN-01, oxaliplatin, temozolomide and tamoxifen (TAM) screened, only TAM induced cell death and up-regulated Par-4 levels significantly. TAM-induced apoptosis was confirmed by PARP cleavage, Annexin V and propidium iodide staining and caspase-3 activity. Knock down of Par-4 by siRNA inhibited cell death by TAM, suggesting the role of Par-4 in induction of apoptosis. We also demonstrate that the mechanism involves break down of mitochondrial membrane potential, down regulation of Bcl-2 and reduced activation of Akt and ERK 42/44. Secretory Par-4 and GRP-78 were significantly expressed in HNGC-2 cells on exposure to TAM and specific antibodies to these molecules inhibited cell death suggesting that extrinsic Par-4 is important in TAM-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, TAM decreased the expression of neural stem cell markers--Nestin, Bmi1, Vimentin, Sox2, and Musashi in HNGC-2 cell line and G1 cells implicating its potential as a stemness inhibiting drug. Based on these data and our findings that enhanced levels of Par-4 sensitize the resistant glioma stem cells to drug-induced apoptosis, we propose that Par-4 may be explored for evaluating anti-tumor agents in CSC.""","""['Jayashree C Jagtap', 'Parveen Dawood', 'Reecha D Shah', 'Goparaju Chandrika', 'Kumar Natesh', 'Anjali Shiras', 'Amba S Hegde', 'Deepak Ranade', 'Padma Shastry']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Secretory prostate apoptosis response (Par)-4 sensitizes multicellular spheroids (MCS) of glioblastoma multiforme cells to tamoxifen-induced cell death.', 'Tamoxifen-induced apoptosis of rat C6 glioma cells via PI3K/Akt, JNK and ERK activation.', 'Tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells is mediated by glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) via AKT (Thr308) regulation.', 'Present and potential future adjuvant issues in high-grade astrocytic glioma treatment.', 'The implications of nitric oxide metabolism in the treatment of glial tumors.', ""Prostate apoptosis response-4 and tumor suppression: it's not just about apoptosis anymore."", 'ATM, ATR, CHK1, CHK2 and WEE1 inhibitors in cancer and cancer stem cells.', 'Inhibition of CRM1 activity sensitizes endometrial and ovarian cell lines to TRAIL-induced cell death.', 'TNF-α and IFN-γ Together Up-Regulates Par-4 Expression and Induce Apoptosis in Human Neuroblastomas.', 'Glioblastoma-derived cells in vitro unveil the spectrum of drug resistance capability - comparative study of tumour chemosensitivity in different culture systems.']"""

It is activated by androgens through its ligand-binding domain (LBD), which consists predominantly of 11 α-helices. Upon ligand binding, the last helix is reorganized to an agonist conformation termed activator function-2 (AF-2) for coactivator binding. Several coactivators bind to the AF-2 pocket through conserved LXXLL or FXXLF sequences to enhance the activity of the receptor. Recently, a small compound-binding surface adjacent to AF-2 has been identified as an allosteric modulator of the AF-2 activity and is termed binding function-3 (BF-3). However, the role of BF-3 in vivo is currently unknown, and little is understood about what proteins can bind to it. Here we demonstrate that a duplicated GARRPR motif at the N terminus of the cochaperone Bag-1L functions through the BF-3 pocket. These findings are supported by the fact that a selective BF-3 inhibitor or mutations within the BF-3 pocket abolish the interaction between the GARRPR motif(s) and the BF-3. Conversely, amino acid exchanges in the two GARRPR motifs of Bag-1L can impair the interaction between Bag-1L and AR without altering the ability of Bag-1L to bind to chromatin. Furthermore, the mutant Bag-1L increases androgen-dependent activation of a subset of AR targets in a genome-wide transcriptome analysis, demonstrating a repressive function of the GARRPR/BF-3 interaction. We have therefore identified GARRPR as a novel BF-3 regulatory sequence important for fine-tuning the activity of the AR.""","""['Katja Jehle', 'Laura Cato', 'Antje Neeb', 'Claudia Muhle-Goll', 'Nicole Jung', 'Emmanuel W Smith', 'Victor Buzon', 'Laia R Carbó', 'Eva Estébanez-Perpiñá', 'Katja Schmitz', 'Ljiljana Fruk', 'Burkhard Luy', 'Yu Chen', 'Marc B Cox', 'Stefan Bräse', 'Myles Brown', 'Andrew C B Cato']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Structural features discriminate androgen receptor N/C terminal and coactivator interactions.', 'Distinct recognition modes of FXXLF and LXXLL motifs by the androgen receptor.', 'Allosteric conversation in the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain surfaces.', 'Androgen receptor ligand-binding domain interaction and nuclear receptor specificity of FXXLF and LXXLL motifs as determined by L/F swapping.', 'A conserved surface on the ligand binding domain of nuclear receptors for allosteric control.', 'Visualization of the protein-protein interactions of hormone receptors in hormone-dependent cancer research.', 'The multivalency of the glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain explains its manifold physiological activities.', 'Allosteric Antagonism of the Pregnane X Receptor (PXR): Current-State-of-the-Art and Prediction of Novel Allosteric Sites.', 'Structure-Based Study to Overcome Cross-Reactivity of Novel Androgen Receptor Inhibitors.', 'Epigenetic Coregulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling.']"""

Nuclear p53 accumulation was found in 10.1% of patients including 1.4% with high-level and 8.7% with low-level immunostaining. TP53 sequencing revealed that 17 of 22 (77%) cases with high-level p53 immunostaining, but only 3% (1 of 31) low-level p53 cases carried putative dominant-negative mutations. TP53 deletions occurred in 14.8% of cancers. Both deletions and protein accumulation were linked to unfavorable tumor phenotype and prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence (p<0.0001 each). The combination of both methods revealed subgroups with remarkable differences in their clinical course. Tumors with either TP53 deletion (14%) or low-level p53 positivity (8.7%) had identical risks of PSA recurrence, which were markedly higher than in cancers without p53 alterations (p<0.0001). Tumors with both p53 deletion and low-level p53 positivity (1.5%) had a worse prognosis than patients with only one of these alterations (p<0.0001). Tumors with strong p53 immunostaining or homozygous inactivation through deletion of one allele and disrupting translocation involving the second allele had the worst outcome, independent from clinical and pathological parameters.

In the current study, the authors sought to define patterns of care for patients undergoing genitourinary cancer surgery to identify underserved areas for urologic cancer care in Washington State.  Methods:   The authors accessed the Washington State Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System from 2003 through 2007. They identified patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, radical cystectomy (RC), partial nephrectomy (PN), radical nephrectomy, and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). TURP was included for comparison as a reference procedure indicative of access to urologic care. Hospital service areas (HSAs) are where the majority of local patients are hospitalized; hospital referral regions (HRR) are where most patients receive tertiary care. The authors created multivariate hierarchical logistic regression models to examine patient and HSA characteristics associated with the receipt of urologic oncology care out of the HRR for each procedure.  Results:   Greater than one-half of patients went out of their HRR in 7 HSAs (11%) for radical prostatectomy, 3 HSAs (5%) for radical nephrectomy, 10 HSAs (15%) for PN, and 14 HSAs (22%) for RC. No HSAs had high export rates for TURP. Few patient factors were found to be associated with surgical care out of the HRR. High-export HSAs for PN and RC exhibited lower socioeconomic characteristics than low-export HSAs, adjusting for HSA population, race, and HSA procedure rates for PN and RC.  Conclusions:   Patients living in areas with lower socioeconomic status have a greater need to travel for complex urologic surgery.

The second objective was to analyze the proportions of men who discussed screening with their physicians.  Methods:   Data were extracted from the 2005 and 2010 National Health Interview Surveys. Men aged ≥65 years without prostate cancer were divided into predicted 9-year mortality quartiles. The proportions of men confirming a screening PSA within the prior year were determined. Logistic regression was used to compare screening rates.  Results:   Screening rates for men aged ≥65 years were 48% in 2005 and 48% in 2010 (P = .9). Men ages 65 to 74 years who had <27% predicted 9-year mortality were most commonly screened, with 56% screened in 2010, compared with 34% of men aged ≥75 years with >75% predicted 9-year mortality.

Aim:   To evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic effects of lupeol and casearin G on tumor cells, on phagocytic activity and nitric oxide (NO) production by blood mononuclear cells.  Material and methods:   The cytotoxic effect of these compounds on cell lines MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) and PC-3 (human prostate cancer) was measured by a colorimetric assay (MTS/PMS) and the sulphorhodamine B assay. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from eight healthy volunteers. The effect of these compounds on nitric oxide (NO) production was measured using the Griess reaction. Their effect on phagocytic activity of PBMC was also evaluated.  Results:   Lupeol (≥ 2 mM) resulted in a reduction of both the phagocytic index and the percentage of phagocytic monocytes and macrophages. Treatment of monocytes/macrophages with lupeol (72 µM) and casearin G (4 µM) reduced the production of NO. Neither lupeol (< 969 µM) nor casearin G (< 55 µM) had cytotoxic effects on PBMC.

Methods:   A total of 10,958 patients treated with PADT were enrolled into the present study. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to evaluate the associations of PSA nadir level and TTN with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), adjusting for the pretreatment factors adopted in the Japan Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (J-CAPRA) score.  Results:   Of the 10,958 patients, 3,451 (31.5%) had lymph node and/or distant metastases. The median PSA level was 27.0 ng/ml before treatment, and the nadir PSA level in 6,983 patients (63.7%) reached below 0.2 ng/ml. Disease progression occurred in 4,736 cases, and 2,163 patients died during a mean follow-up period of 3.86 years. Nadir PSA level and TTN were independent prognostic factors, similar to the pretreatment factors adopted in the J-CAPRA score. The probabilities of PFS and OS showed significant differences among the groups categorized by the combination of nadir PSA level and TTN in all J-CAPRA risk stratifications.

The Smart Arc of Pinnacle(3) (Philips), which is the software used in VMAT calculations, can select constant dose rate (CDR) mode. This approach has a low initial cost because the linac upgrade is not required. The objective of this study was to clarify the utility of CDR mode for prostate IMRT. Pinnacle(3) and Clinac 21EX linac (Varian, 10 MV X-rays) were used for planning. The plans were created for 28 patients using a fixed multi-field IMRT (f-IMRT), VMAT and CDR techniques. The dose distribution results were classified into three groups: optimal, suboptimal and reject. For the f-IMRT, VMAT and CDR results, 25, 26 and 21 patients were classified as 'optimal', respectively. Our results show a significant reduction in the achievement rate of 'optimal' for a CDR when the bladder volume is <100 cm(3). The total numbers of monitoring units (MUs) (average ± 1σ) were 469 ± 53, 357 ± 35 and 365 ± 33; the average optimization times were ∼50 min, 2 h and 2 h 40 min, and the irradiation times were ∼280 s, 60 s and 110 s, respectively. CDR can reduce the total MUs and irradiation time compared with f-IMRT, and CDR has a lower initial cost compared with VMAT. Thus, for institutions that do not currently perform VMAT, CDR is a useful option.

Acute rejection is a systemic inflammatory state and may share a common casual pathway for cancer development after transplantation. The increased burden of immunosuppression used in the treatment of acute rejection, particularly the use of T-cell-depleting antibody may further heighten the risk of cancer development. We aimed to determine the association between acute rejection, T-cell-depleting antibody use and cancer risk after kidney transplantation.  Methods:   Using the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), we assessed the risk of incident cancer among those who had experienced rejection stratified by the use of T-cell-depleting antibody using adjusted Cox proportional hazard and competing risk models.  Results:   A total of 7153 kidney transplant recipients between 1997 and 2009 were included. A total of 467 (6.5%) recipients developed cancers. Recipients who experienced acute rejection and treated with T-cell-depleting antibody were at a 1.4-fold increased risk of cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.02-1.99, P=0.039) compared with those who did not experience acute rejection. There was an excess risk of genitourinary tract cancers among recipients who had experienced rejection requiring T-cell-depleting antibody compared with recipients who did not experience acute rejection (HR 2.20, 95% CI 1.33-3.66, P=0.007).

Methods and materials:   Ten patients were considered for this planning study. For external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), planning target volume was created by adding a margin of 5 mm (lateral/anterior-posterior) and 8 mm (superior-inferior) to the clinical target volume. Bladder wall (BW), rectal wall (RW), femoral heads, urethra, and pelvic tissue were considered as organs at risk. For VMAT and IMPT, 78 Gy(relative biological effectiveness, RBE)/2 Gy were prescribed. The IMIT was based on 66 Gy(RBE)/20 fractions. The clinical target volume planning aims for HDR-BT ((192)Ir) and LDR-BT ((125)I) were D(90%) ≥34 Gy in 8.5 Gy per fraction and D(90%) ≥145 Gy. Both physical and RBE-weighted dose distributions for protons and carbon-ions were converted to dose distributions based on 2-Gy(IsoE) fractions. From these dose distributions various dose and dose-volume parameters were extracted.  Results:   Rectal wall exposure 30-70 Gy(IsoE) was reduced for IMIT, LDR-BT, and HDR-BT when compared with VMAT and IMPT. The high-dose region of the BW dose-volume histogram above 50 Gy(IsoE) of IMPT resembled the VMAT shape, whereas all other techniques showed a significantly lower high-dose region. For all 3 EBRT techniques similar urethra D(mean) around 74 Gy(IsoE) were obtained. The LDR-BT results were approximately 30 Gy(IsoE) higher, HDR-BT 10 Gy(IsoE) lower. Normal tissue and femoral head sparing was best with BT.  Conclusion:   Despite the different EBRT prescription and fractionation schemes, the high-dose regions of BW and RW expressed in Gy(IsoE) were on the same order of magnitude.

Discordance for biomarkers expression between primary tumor tissue and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has been widely reported, thus rendering the biological characterization of CTCs an attractive tool for biomarkers assessment and treatment selection. Studies performed in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients using CellSearch, the only FDA-cleared test for CTCs assessment, demonstrated a much lower yield of CTCs in this tumor type compared with breast and prostate cancer, both at baseline and during the course of treatment. Thus, although attractive, the possibility to use CTCs as therapy-related biomarker for colorectal cancer patients is still limited by a number of technical issues mainly due to the low sensitivity of the CellSearch method. In the present study we found a significant discordance between CellSearch and AdnaTest in the detection of CTCs from mCRC patients. We then investigated KRAS pathway activating mutations in CTCs and determined the degree of heterogeneity for KRAS oncogenic mutations between CTCs and tumor tissues. Whether KRAS gene amplification may represent an alternative pathway responsible for KRAS activation was further explored. KRAS gene amplification emerged as a functionally equivalent and mutually exclusive mechanism of KRAS pathway activation in CTCs, possibly related to transcriptional activation.

However, increased fatal cancer in ARB users in a randomized trial and increased breast cancer recurrence rates in ACEI users in a recent observational study have raised concerns about their safety in cancer patients. We investigated whether ACEI or ARB use after breast, colorectal or prostate cancer diagnosis was associated with increased risk of cancer-specific mortality.  Methods:   Population-based cohorts of 9,814 breast, 4,762 colorectal and 6,339 prostate cancer patients newly diagnosed from 1998 to 2006 were identified in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and confirmed by cancer registry linkage. Cancer-specific and all-cause mortality were identified from Office of National Statistics mortality data in 2011 (allowing up to 13 years of follow-up). A nested case-control analysis was conducted to compare ACEI/ARB use (from general practitioner prescription records) in cancer patients dying from cancer with up to five controls (not dying from cancer). Conditional logistic regression estimated the risk of cancer-specific, and all-cause, death in ACEI/ARB users compared with non-users.  Results:   The main analysis included 1,435 breast, 1,511 colorectal and 1,184 prostate cancer-specific deaths (and 7,106 breast, 7,291 colorectal and 5,849 prostate cancer controls). There was no increase in cancer-specific mortality in patients using ARBs after diagnosis of breast (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.06 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84, 1.35), colorectal (adjusted OR = 0.82 95% CI 0.64, 1.07) or prostate cancer (adjusted OR = 0.79 95% CI 0.61, 1.03). There was also no evidence of increases in cancer-specific mortality with ACEI use for breast (adjusted OR = 1.06 95% CI 0.89, 1.27), colorectal (adjusted OR = 0.78 95% CI 0.66, 0.92) or prostate cancer (adjusted OR = 0.78 95% CI 0.66, 0.92).  Conclusions:   Overall, we found no evidence of increased risks of cancer-specific mortality in breast, colorectal or prostate cancer patients who used ACEI or ARBs after diagnosis.

Material and methods:   Between 2004 and 2007, 690 men underwent prostate biopsy and RP at a single university hospital. Of those, 248 patients (35.9%) had low-risk prostate cancer criteria. The endpoints of the study were detection of low-risk (pT2 and Gleason score ≤ 6) or unfavourable (≥ pT3 and/or Gleason score ≥ 7) prostate cancer, and BPFS. The risk of progression was analysed using multivariate Cox regression model and BPFS was established using Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results:   The median follow-up was 60 months (1-112 months). pT3 was detected in 14.1%, and Gleason score ≥ 7 in 32.7% of patients. Unfavourable prostate cancer was detected in 37.5% of patients. Overall biochemical relapse rate was 13.6%. The estimated probability of 3-, 5- and 8-year BPFS for all study patients was 90.6%, 88.1% and 77.9%, respectively. Eight-year BPFS was 83.3% for low-risk prostate cancer and 68.2% for unfavourable prostate cancer (p = 0.007).

Preliminary data on a mechanistic rationale for chemoprevention activity as observed from epidemiological, in vitro and preclinical studies, phase I data of safety in suitable cohorts, duration of intervention based on time to progression of pre-neoplastic disease to cancer and using a valid panel of biomarkers representing the hypothesized carcinogenesis pathway for measuring efficacy must inform the design of clinical trials. Botanicals have been shown to influence multiple biochemical and molecular cascades that inhibit mutagenesis, proliferation, induce apoptosis, suppress the formation and growth of human cancers, thus modulating several hallmarks of carcinogenesis. These agents appear promising in their potential to make a dramatic impact in cancer prevention and treatment, with a significantly superior safety profile than most agents evaluated to date.

Thus, the pivotal role of 1α-hydroxylation in the activation of vitamin D compounds is well known. Here, we examined the metabolism of 25-hydroxy-16-ene-23-yne-vitamin D3 (25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3), a synthetic analog of 25(OH)D3 in a cell-free system and demonstrated that 25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3 is neither activated by CYP27B1 nor inactivated by cytochrome P450 24A1 (CYP24A1). These findings were also confirmed in immortalized normal human prostate epithelial cells (PZ-HPV-7) which are known to express both CYP27B1 and CYP24A1, indicating that the structural modifications featured in 25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3 enable the analog to resist the actions of both CYP27B1 and CYP24A1. To provide intelligible structure-function information, we also performed molecular docking analysis between the analog and CYP27B1. Furthermore, 25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3 was found to suppress the growth of PZ-HPV-7 cells with a potency equivalent to 1α,25(OH)2D3. The antiproliferative activity of 25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3 was found to be vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent as it failed to inhibit the growth of mammary tumor cells derived from VDR-knockout mice. Furthermore, stable introduction of VDR into VDR-knockout cells restored the growth inhibition by 25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3. Thus, we identified 25-hydroxy-16-ene-23-yne-vitamin D3 as a novel non-1α-hydroxylated vitamin D analog which is equipotent to 1α,25(OH)2D3 in its antiproliferative activity. We now propose that the low potency of the intrinsic VDR-mediated activities of 25(OH)D3 can be augmented to the level of 1α,25(OH)2D3 without its activation through 1α-hydroxylation by CYP27B1, but by simply preventing its inactivation by CYP24A1.""","""['Steve Y Rhieu', 'Andrew J Annalora', 'Erika LaPorta', 'JoEllen Welsh', 'Toshimasa Itoh', 'Keiko Yamamoto', 'Toshiyuki Sakaki', 'Tai C Chen', 'Milan R Uskokovic', 'G Satyanarayana Reddy']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Metabolism of vitamin D3 by cytochromes P450.', 'Metabolism and Action of 25-Hydroxy-19-nor-Vitamin D₃ in Human Prostate Cells.', 'Effects of 1,25 and 24,25 Vitamin D on Corneal Epithelial Proliferation, Migration and Vitamin D Metabolizing and Catabolizing Enzymes.', 'A High-Calcium and Phosphate Rescue Diet and VDR-Expressing Transgenes Normalize Serum Vitamin D Metabolite Profiles and Renal Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 Expression in VDR Null Mice.', 'Kinetic studies of 25-hydroxy-19-nor-vitamin D3 and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy-19-nor-vitamin D3 hydroxylation by CYP27B1 and CYP24A1.', 'Vitamin D Receptor Expression in Dogs.', 'Genomic and transcriptomic profiling of resistant CEM/ADR-5000 and sensitive CCRF-CEM leukaemia cells for unravelling the full complexity of multi-factorial multidrug resistance.', 'Commentary: Vitamin D and Pancreatic Cancer: A Pooled Analysis from the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium.', 'Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway affects epigenetic regulation in cancer cells.']"""

We searched PubMed, EMbase, CNKI and Wanfang databases; the last search was performed on January 10th, 2014. Statistical analysis was performed using the Revman4.2 and STATA10.0 softwares. A total of 3,684 cancer cases and 5,232 controls from 11 case-control studies were included for data analysis. In the dominant model analysis, the results suggested a lack of association between the polymorphism and the risk of cancers: OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.83-1.16, P = 0.70. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no significant association was found either for Asians or Caucasians. In the subgroup analysis by cancer types, significant association was found for prostate cancer, but not for bladder cancer, breast cancer and glioma. In summary, the current meta-analysis confirmed that the rs7003908 polymorphism in the XRCC7 gene might be a risk factor for prostate cancer.

The HRH1 predominantly couples to Gαq/11 proteins, leading to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent release of the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) followed by the activation of PKC and the release of [Ca2+]i. In the present study, we identified HRH1 genes from 14 vertebrate genomes and found that HRH1 exists in all types of vertebrates including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. We identified 88 SNPs including 4 available alleles disrupting an existing exonic splicing enhancer and 84 SNPs causing missense mutation, which may impact the effect of histamine on the HRH1 protein. We found that the human HRH1 gene was expressed in many tissues or organs, and predominant expression of HRH1 was shown in the bone marrow, whole blood, lymph node, thymus, brain, cerebellum, retina, spinal cord, heart, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, small intestine, colon, adipocytes, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, thyroid salivary gland, skin, ovary, uterus, placenta, prostate and testis. When searched in the PrognoScan database, human HRH1 was also found to be expressed in bladder cancer, blood cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, eye cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, skin cancer and soft tissue cancer tissues. The relationship between the expression of HRH1 and prognosis was found to vary in different types of cancers, even in the same cancer from different databases. This implies that the function of HRH1 in these tumors may be multidimensional. GR, STAT5A and c-Myb regulatory transcription factor binding sites were identified in the HRH1 gene upstream (promoter) region, which may be involved in the effect of HRH1 in tumors.""","""['Minghai Wang', 'Xiaolong Wei', 'Lianghui Shi', 'Bin Chen', 'Guohai Zhao', 'Haiwei Yang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Integrative genomic analyses of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine and its role in cancer prediction.', ""Integrative genomic analyses of recepteur d'origine nantais and its prognostic value in cancer."", 'Integrative genomic analyses of the RNA-binding protein, RNPC1, and its potential role in cancer prediction.', 'Structure of the histamine H1 receptor gene and transcriptional up-regulation of the H1 receptor.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'Function and Role of Histamine H1 Receptor in the Mammalian Heart.', 'An inflammatory response-related gene signature associated with immune status and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Single B Cell Gene Co-Expression Networks Implicated in Prognosis, Proliferation, and Therapeutic Responses in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Bulk Tumors.', 'Using GPCRs as Molecular Beacons to Target Ovarian Cancer with Nanomedicines.', 'Evaluation of the Differences in the Expression of Biogenic Amine-Related mRNAs and Proteins in Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer.']"""

Bioengineered approaches allow researchers to create sophisticated experimentally and physiologically relevant in vivo models to study interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment under reproducible conditions. The aim of this study was to engineer a morphologically and functionally intact humanized organ bone which can serve as a homing site for human prostate cancer cells. Transplantation of biodegradable tubular composite scaffolds seeded with human mesenchymal progenitor cells and loaded with rhBMP-7 resulted in the development of a chimeric bone construct including a large number of human mesenchymal cells which were shown to be metabolically active and capable of producing extracellular matrix components. Micro-CT analysis demonstrated that the newly formed ossicle recapitulated the morphological features of a physiological organ bone with a trabecular network surrounded by a cortex-like outer structure. This microenvironment was supportive of the lodgement and maintenance of murine haematopoietic cell clusters, thus mimicking a functional organ bone. Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated that luciferase-transduced human PC3 cells reproducibly homed to the humanized tissue engineered bone constructs, proliferated, and developed macro-metastases. This model allows the analysis of interactions between human prostate cancer cells and a functional humanized bone organ within an immuno-incompetent murine host.

Methods:   A 3:1 population-based sample of breast (6,259), prostate (3,609), female colorectal (1,082), and male colorectal (816) cancer survivors from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey were matched to noncancer controls on age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, insurance, and region of the US. The likelihood of flu immunization, physical check-up, cholesterol check, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, diet (5-A-Day), smoking, and alcohol use were compared between groups using binomial logistic regression models.  Results:   Short-term breast cancer survivors were significantly more likely to meet multiple behavioral recommendations, than controls, but the likelihood decreased in the long term. Breast and female colorectal cancer survivors were up to 2.27 (95 % CI 1.90, 2.71) and 1.89 times more likely (95 % CI 1.60, 2.24) to meet the 5-A-Day and BMI recommendations, up to 0.54 times less likely (95 % CI 0.46, 0.64) to drink any alcohol, but were 0.68 times less likely (95 % CI 0.49, 0.95) to meet the physical activity recommendation, compared to prostate and male colorectal cancer survivors.  Conclusions:   Some cancer survivors may engage in better health behaviors shortly after diagnosis, but the majority of cancer survivors do not have better health behaviors than individuals without a history of cancer. However, a consistent pattern of behavioral differences exist between male and female cancer survivors.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Gender differences in health behaviors among cancer survivors may be influenced by perceptions of masculinity/femininity and disease risk.

The accuracy of the needle deflection estimation was determined. The robustness of the approach with variations in needle insertion speed and soft tissue biomechanical properties was investigated.  Methods:   A needle deflection estimation method was developed to determine the amount of needle bending during insertion into deformable tissue by combining a kinematic deflection model with measurements taken from two electromagnetic trackers placed at the tip and the base of the needle. Experimental verification of this method for use in prostate brachytherapy needle insertion procedures was performed. A total of 21 beveled tip, 18 ga, 200 mm needles were manually inserted at various speeds through a template and toward different targets distributed within 3 soft tissue mimicking polyvinyl chloride prostate phantoms of varying stiffness. The tracked positions of both the needle tip and base were recorded, and Kalman filters were applied to fuse the sensory information. The estimation results were validated using ground truth obtained from fluoroscopy images.  Results:   The manual insertion speed ranged from 8 to 34 mm/s, needle deflection ranged from 5 to 8 mm at an insertion depth of 76 mm, and the elastic modulus of the soft tissue ranged from 50 to 150 kPa. The accuracy and robustness of the estimation method were verified within these ranges. When compared to purely model-based estimation, we observed a reduction in needle tip position estimation error by [Formula: see text] % (mean [Formula: see text] SD) and the cumulative deflection error by [Formula: see text] %.

At present, with 11 and 12 years of follow-up significant relative reductions of 21 % and 31 % relating to both end points have been reported. The diagnosis of non-life threatening PCA (over diagnosis) is estimated to be in the range of 50 % and represents the main ""harm"", which prevents the introduction of population-based screening. As a result, the prevention of over diagnosis is now given top research priority. PSA as a screening test has poor performance characteristics including a low specificity. With the cut-off value of 3.0 ng/ml chosen within ERSPC, about 25 % of men aged 55--69 test positively, 75 % have ""negative"" test results, which do not definitely exclude the presence of PCa. Research to establish empirical schemes of follow-up based on PSA levels and other parameters are ongoing worldwide. In the meantime, we are, by approximation, capable to identify over diagnosed PCa detected by screening. Active surveillance can be applied to avoid side effects and expenses of treatment and is, among others, based on the grade of differentiation determined on biopsies. The assignment of the most favorable ""Gleason score 6"" is a crucial decision element.

This chapter discusses research on this subject, mostly from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a cohort which includes 150,000 men recruited in the 1990s in eight European countries. So far the EPIC collaborators have published analyses of the relationship of prostate cancer risk with the intake of a range of foods and nutrients, and with blood-based markers of nutritional factors, on up to nearly 3,000 incident cases of prostate cancer. Most of the results of these analyses have been null, with no clear indication that the risk for prostate cancer is related to intakes of meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, fibre, fat or alcohol or with blood levels of fatty acids, carotenoids, tocopherols, B vitamins, vitamin D, or selenium. There is some evidence from EPIC that risk may be increased in men with a high intake of protein from dairy products, and analyses of hormone levels have shown that risk is higher in men with relatively high blood levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I).

Accumulating evidence indicates that obesity may have a dual effect on PCa: an increased risk of aggressive PCa and a decreased risk of localized PCa. Both occupational and leisure time physical activity have been observed to be associated with a reduced PCa risk. Different dietary factors including coffee have been examined in several epidemiological studies, but results have been mostly inconsistent. However, these inconsistencies can be, at least partly, explained by the fact that the majority of those studies examined total PCa risk only and, in addition, they did not take into account the different genetic characteristics within the study populations. Therefore, the future epidemiological studies should focus on the analysis of PCa subtypes separately in order to examine possible etiological heterogeneity of PCa in relation to some exposures.

The introduction of PSA testing has immensely complicated research in prostate cancer epidemiology and biology and added new clinical and biological domains. As for many cancers, age and ethnic origin are the strongest known risk factors. While migrant studies imply that environment and/or personal life style is important, epidemiological studies have failed to establish any strong leads. Despite the known androgen dependence of prostate cancer, there is little to support that circulating levels of androgens, estrogens or 5-alpha-reductase are associated with risk of developing the disease. However, a consistent finding is a positive association with levels of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1). Prostate cancer is one of the cancers most strongly related to inherited susceptibility, even when taking into account that family history of prostate cancer triggers PSA testing among relatives. A number of somatic genetic alterations (amplifications, deletions, point mutations, translocations) are associated with prostate cancer risk. Findings for alterations in FASN, HPN, AMACR and MYC have been fairly consistent. Recent research shows that the notion of ""hormone-independent prostate cancer"" has to be revised: most prostate cancers remain dependent on androgen receptor signalling also after progression despite traditional androgen deprivation therapy. Traditional markers of stage and type of disease still play a major role for prognostication and treatment decisions. Prostate cancer is one of the few cancers where patients have been recommended watchful waiting or active surveillance. This provides opportunities for studies of natural history of the disease. The understanding of prostate cancer aetiology and natural history has progressed slowly. However, the current situation is positively challenging and opens up possibilities for fruitful research.""","""['Lars Holmberg', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Recent Results Cancer Res""","""['Epidemiological fundamentals of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Patterns of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in Australian men: the influence of family history.', 'Comprehensive assessment of candidate genes and serological markers for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-1 is associated with regulation of the luteinizing hormone production in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for localized prostate cancer.', 'Perspective: prostate cancer susceptibility genes.', 'Glucose, lipids and gamma-glutamyl transferase measured before prostate cancer diagnosis and secondly diagnosed primary tumours: a prospective study in the Swedish AMORIS cohort.', 'Role of vitamin D receptor gene Cdx2 and Apa1 polymorphisms in prostate cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis.', 'Unemployment and prostate cancer mortality in the OECD, 1990-2009.', 'Functional status declines among cancer survivors: trajectory and contributing factors.', 'The role of biomarkers in the assessment of prostate cancer risk prior to prostate biopsy: which markers matter and how should they be used?']"""

Objective:   We evaluated the association of long-term Cd exposure, as measured in urine, with cancer mortality in American Indians from Arizona, Oklahoma, and North and South Dakota who participated in the Strong Heart Study during 1989-1991.  Methods:   The Strong Heart Study was a prospective cohort study of 3,792 men and women 45-74 years of age who were followed for up to 20 years. Baseline urinary Cd (U-Cd) was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We assessed cancer events by annual mortality surveillance.  Results:   The median (interquintile range) U-Cd concentration was 0.93 (0.55, 1.63) μg/g creatinine. After adjusting for sex, age, smoking status, cigarette pack-years, and body mass index, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing the 80th versus the 20th percentiles of U-Cd were 1.30 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.55) for total cancer, 2.27 (95% CI: 1.58, 3.27) for lung cancer, and 2.40 (95% CI: 1.39, 4.17) for pancreatic cancer mortality. For all smoking-related cancers combined, the corresponding HR was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.96). Cd was not significantly associated with liver, esophagus and stomach, colon and rectum, breast, prostate, kidney, or lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer mortality. On the basis of mediation analysis, we estimated that the percentage of lung cancer deaths due to tobacco smoking that could be attributed to Cd exposure was 9.0% (95% CI: 2.8, 21.8).

To better understand the pathophysiology of bone metastasis, we have established and validated a 3D indirect co-culture model to investigate the paracrine interactions between prostate cancer (PCa) cells and human osteoblasts. Co-culture of the human PCa, LNCaP cells embedded within polyethylene glycol hydrogels with human osteoblasts in the form of a tissue engineered bone construct (TEB), resulted in reduced proliferation of LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells in both monoculture and co-culture were responsive to the androgen analog, R1881, as indicated by an increase in the expression (mRNA and/or protein induction) of androgen-regulated genes including prostate specific antigen and fatty acid synthase. Microarray gene expression analysis further revealed an up-regulation of bone markers and other genes associated with skeletal and vasculature development and a significant activation of transforming growth factor β1 downstream genes in LNCaP cells after co-culture with TEB. LNCaP cells co-cultured with TEB also unexpectedly showed similar changes in classical androgen-responsive genes under androgen-deprived conditions not seen in LNCaP monocultures. The molecular changes of LNCaP cells after co-culturing with TEBs suggest that osteoblasts exert a paracrine effect that may promote osteomimicry and modulate the expression of androgen-responsive genes in LNCaP cells. Taken together, we have presented a novel 3D in vitro model that allows the study of cellular and molecular changes occurring in PCa cells and osteoblasts that are relevant to metastatic colonization of bone.

While glutathione and heme oxygenase-1 are not involved in α-tocopheryl succinate-induced adaptive response to paraquat,  Nad(p)h:   quinone oxidoreductase seems to be responsible, at least in part, for the lack of the additional response. Silencing the gene and/or the inhibition of  Nad(p)h:   quinone oxidoreductase activity counteracts the α-tocopheryl succinate-induced adaptive response. In conclusion, the adaptive response to α-tocopheryl succinate shows that the activation of Nrf2 can promote the survival of cancer cells in an unfavourable environment.""","""['Ilaria Bellezza', 'Silvia Grottelli', 'Leonardo Gatticchi', 'Anna Lisa Mierla', 'Alba Minelli']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation via HO-1 activation underlies α-tocopheryl succinate toxicity.', 'Cytoprotective effect of alpha-lipoic acid on paraquat-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells via activation of nuclear factor erythroid related factor-2 pathway.', 'Bilirubin mediated oxidative stress involves antioxidant response activation via Nrf2 pathway.', 'Antioxidant action of ellagic acid ameliorates paraquat-induced A549 cytotoxicity.', 'Gamma-tocopheryl quinone, not alpha-tocopheryl quinone, induces adaptive response through up-regulation of cellular glutathione and cysteine availability via activation of ATF4.', 'Pharmacological Potential of Betulin as a Multitarget Compound.', 'Effect of α-Tocopheryloxy Acetic Acid on the Infection of Mice with Plasmodium berghei ANKA In Vivo and Humans with P. falciparum In Vitro.', 'Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and apoptosis induction and inhibition of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response in human prostate cancer PC3 cells by Brassica oleracea var. acephala: An in vitro study.', 'Prophylactic Effect of Lactobacillus fermentum TKSN02 on Gastric Injury Induced by Hydrochloric Acid/Ethanol in Mice Through Its Antioxidant Capacity.', 'Flavonoids Activation of the Transcription Factor Nrf2 as a Hypothesis Approach for the Prevention and Modulation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Severity.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of total testosterone (tT), free testosterone (fT), the fraction (%) of fT to tT (%fT), and bioavailable testosterone (bioT) in serum to improve the diagnostic validity of the serum (-2)pro-PSA-based Prostate Health Index (PHI).  Design and methods:   Total and free PSA (tPSA, fPSA), (-2)pro-PSA, testosterone, and sex-hormone-binding globulin were measured by automated immunoassays from serum of 193 men scheduled for prostate biopsy (99 PCa, 94 without PCa). fT and bioT were calculated using an online calculator. Statistical analyses were performed by non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis), binary logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.  Results:   Compared with the non-malignant controls, PCa patients had significantly higher tPSA concentrations and PHI values, but lower %fPSA values and lower concentrations of tT, fT, and bioT. PCa could be differentiated from controls by PHI, tT, fT, bioT, and %fPSA. PHI showed the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC=0.73) that was increased further by the inclusion of bioT or tT in a binary logistic regression model. The AUC of PHI in patients with tT concentrations of <8nmol/L (indicating biochemical hypogonadism) was significantly larger than that in patients with higher tT values (0.86 vs. 0.70; P=0.024).  Conclusions:   The PHI-based discrimination between PCa patients and non-malignant controls could be improved by the simultaneous determination of testosterone.

The predictive value of the nomograms was assessed by means of calibration curves, discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and probability density functions). The clinical utility was evaluated through Vickers' decision curves and thresholds were chosen through probability density functions.  Results:   The calibration curves showed a minimal underestimation in low probabilities (<20%), a minimal overestimation in high probabilities (>50%) in the HUMS nomogram and a regular minimal overestimation in the PT-2012. Their AUC of 0.7285 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7010-0.7559) and 0.7288 (95%CI 0.7013-0.7562) respectively, show an adequate discrimination ability for both predictive models in the IVO cohort.

Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were used to predict OS after chemotherapy initiation.  Results:   In univariable analyses, the NLR as a discrete variable (optimal threshold 3.0) was significantly associated with OS (P = 0.001). In multivariable analyses, a lower NLR (≤3.0) was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (P = 0.002).

The purpose of this intervention was to assess whether using thinner seeds reduces post-implant swelling with permanent prostate brachytherapy.  Methods:   Eighteen consecutive patients eligible for prostate seed brachytherapy underwent seed implantation using iodine-125 (I-125) thin seeds. Operative time, dosimetry, prostate swelling and toxicity were assessed and compared with standard I-125 stranded seed controls, sourced from the department's brachytherapy database.  Results:   A learning curve was noted with the thin seeds in terms of greater bending and deviation of needles from their intended path. This translated into significantly longer total operative time (88 vs 103 minutes; P = 0.009, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1-24.3) and time per needle insertion (2.6 vs 3.7 minutes; P < 0.001, 95% CI 0.5-1.3) for the thin seeds. Day 30 prostate volumes were significantly smaller in the thin seed group compared with standard seeds (40.9 cc vs 46.8 cc; P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.5-5.6). The ratio of preoperative transrectal ultrasound to day 30 post-implant CT volume was also smaller in the thin seed group (1.2 ± 0.1 for standard seeds vs 1.1 ± 0.1 for thin seeds). Post-implant dosimetric parameters were comparable for both groups. No significant differences were seen in acute urinary morbidity or quality of life between the two groups.

To evaluate the effect of personal and family history of certain cancers and cancer treatments on the risk of BE, we analyzed data from a Veterans Affairs case-control study that included 264 men with definitive BE (cases) and 1486 men without BE (controls). Patients with history of esophageal or gastric cancer were excluded. Patients underwent elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy or a study esophagogastroduodenoscopy concurrently with screening colonoscopy to determine BE status. Personal and family history of several types of cancer was obtained from self-reported questionnaires, supplemented and verified by electronic medical-record reviews. We estimated the association between personal and family history of cancer or radiation/chemotherapy, and BE. Personal history of oropharyngeal cancer (1.5% vs. 0.4%) or prostate cancer (7.2% vs. 4.4%) was more frequently present in cases than controls. The association between BE and prostate cancer persisted in multivariable analyses (adjusted odds ratio 1.90; 95% confidence interval 1.07-3.38, P = 0.028) while that with oropharyngeal cancer (adjusted odds ratio 3.63; 95% confidence interval 0.92-14.29, P = 0.066) was attenuated after adjusting for retained covariates of age, race, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia, and proton pump inhibitor use. Within the subset of patients with cancer, prior treatment with radiation or chemotherapy was not associated with BE. There were no significant differences between cases and controls in the proportions of subjects with several specific malignancies in first- or second-degree relatives. In conclusion, the risk of BE in men may be elevated with prior personal history of oropharyngeal or prostate cancer. However, prior cancer treatments and family history of cancer were not associated with increased risk of BE. Further studies are needed to elucidate if there is a causative relationship or shared risk factors between prostate cancer and BE.""","""['N Khalaf', 'D Ramsey', 'J R Kramer', 'H B El-Serag']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Dis Esophagus""","""[""Statin use is associated with a decreased risk of Barrett's esophagus."", ""Oral bisphosphonates and the risk of Barrett's esophagus: case-control analysis of US veterans."", ""Family History of Colorectal or Esophageal Cancer in Barrett's Esophagus and Potentially Explanatory Genetic Variants."", ""Hiatal hernia and the risk of Barrett's esophagus."", ""Barrett's esophagus and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma."", ""Barrett's esophagus: results from an Italian cohort with tight endoscopic surveillance."", ""Barrett's esophagus with high grade dysplasia is associated with non-esophageal cancer.""]"""

Various molecular, pathological and transgenic mouse studies suggest that TSPY is a Y-located proto-oncogene contributing to the initiation/progression in human cancers, including germ cell tumors and various somatic cancers, such as prostate and liver cancer, and melanoma. The TgTSPY9 transgenic mouse line harbors a 8.2-kb human TSPY structural gene, which is tandemly integrated in the mouse Y chromosome, and expressed in a similar pattern as that of the endogenous gene in the human genome. This mouse model of human TSPY gene offers an opportunity to examine its behavior and potential contribution in various mouse models of human diseases, such as human cancers. We had investigated the expression of such TSPY-transgene in the LADY mouse model of prostate cancer, harboring a SV40 T antigen gene directed by a rat probasin promoter; and compared the expression pattern with those of endogenous TSPY gene and biomarkers in human prostate cancer specimens.  Results:   By introducing the Y-located TSPY-transgene to the LADY mice, we had examined the expression pattern of the human TSPY during prostatic oncogenesis in this mouse model of prostate cancer. Our results showed that the TSPY-transgene was activated in selected areas of the hypercellular stroma but not in the intraepithelial cells/neoplasia in the prostates of TgTSPY9/LADY mice. Using a specific biomarker, FOXA1, for epithelial cells, we demonstrated that TSPY-positive cells proliferated exclusively in the cancerous stroma in the LADY model at late stages of tumorigenesis. In contrast, in the human situation, TSPY was predominantly co-expressed with FOXA1 in the epithelial cells of PIN lesions and FOXA1 and another cancer biomarker, AMACR, in the adenocarcinoma cells in clinical prostate cancer samples of various degrees of malignancy.  Conclusions:   Our data show that human TSPY could be abnormally activated during prostatic oncogenesis, and could possibly contribute to the heterogeneity of prostate cancer. The differential expression patterns of the human TSPY between the LADY mouse model and clinical prostate cancer suggest potential limitations of current mouse models for studies of either TSPY behavior in diseased conditions or prostate cancer development.""","""['Tatsuo Kido', 'Stephanie Schubert', 'Shingo Hatakeyama', 'Chikara Ohyama', 'Jörg Schmidtke', 'Yun-Fai Chris Lau']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Biosci""","""['Battle of the sexes: contrasting roles of testis-specific protein Y-encoded (TSPY) and TSPX in human oncogenesis.', 'Expression pattern of a gonadoblastoma candidate gene suggests a role of the Y chromosome in prostate cancer.', 'Gonadoblastoma Y locus genes expressed in germ cells of individuals with dysgenetic gonads and a Y chromosome in their karyotypes include DDX3Y and TSPY.', 'Gonadoblastoma locus and the TSPY gene on the human Y chromosome.', 'The Y-located gonadoblastoma gene TSPY amplifies its own expression through a positive feedback loop in prostate cancer cells.', 'Y chromosome in health and diseases.', 'A Novel Nanofiber Hydrogel Loaded with Platelet-Rich Plasma Promotes Wound Healing Through Enhancing the Survival of Fibroblasts.', 'Battle of the sexes: contrasting roles of testis-specific protein Y-encoded (TSPY) and TSPX in human oncogenesis.', 'Prostate cancer susceptibility and growth linked to Y chromosome genes.', 'Y-chromosomal genes affecting male fertility: A review.']"""

However, not every process of cancer development is associated with competition for resources. During hematogenous transport, cancer cells are exposed to high levels of oxygen and nutrients. Does energy metabolism of cancer cells change as a function of exposure to the bloodstream? Could such changes be exploited to improve the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC)? These questions have clinical significance, but have not yet been sufficiently examined.  Methods:   The energy metabolism was examined as a function of incubation in nutrient-rich plasma in prostate metastatic cancer cells LNCaP and non-transformed prostate epithelial cells RWPE1. Uptake kinetics of a fluorescent glucose analog (2-NBD) and lipophilic dyes (DiD & Bodipy) were measured in both cell lines, as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).  Results:   LNCaP cells exhibited hyper-acetylation of low molecular weight proteins compared to RWPE1 cells. Following plasma incubation, protein lysine acetylation profile was unchanged for LNCaP cells while significantly altered for RWPE1 cells. O-linked glycosylated protein profiles were different between LNCaP and RWPE1 cells and varied in both cell lines with plasma incubation. Maximal respiration or glycolytic capacities was unchanged in LNCaP cells and impaired in RWPE1 cells following plasma incubation. However, the uptake rates of 2-NBD and DiD were insufficient for discrimination of LNCaP, or RWPE1 cells from PBMC. On the other hand, both RWPE1 and LNCaP cells exhibited intracellular lipid bodies following plasma incubation; whereas, PBMC did not. The presence of lipid bodies in LNCaP cells permitted retention of Bodipy dye and allowed discrimination of LNCaP cells from PBMC with flow cytometry.  Conclusions:   Despite clear differences in energy metabolism, metastatic prostate cancer cells could not be efficiently distinguished from non-transformed prostate epithelial cells using fluorescent glucose or lipid uptake kinetics. However, metastatic prostate cancer cells in plasma could be clearly distinguished from blood nucleated cells due to the presence of intracellular lipid bodies. Fluorescent labeling of lipid bodies permitted a simple and sensitive means for high throughput detection of metastatic prostate cancer cells in human plasma.""","""['Ranjana Mitra', 'Oscar B Goodman', 'Thuc T Le']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Detection of lipid-rich prostate circulating tumour cells with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy.', 'Enrichment and mutation detection of circulating tumor cells from blood samples.', 'In vitro detection of prostate cancer circulating cells by immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and RT-PCR PSA.', 'Chemoaffinity capture of pre-targeted prostate cancer cells with magnetic beads.', 'Circulating tumor cells: advances in detection methods, biological issues, and clinical relevance.', 'A ""Weird"" Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation as a Metabolic ""Secret"" of Cancer.', 'Single-Cell Chemistry of Photoactivatable Platinum Anticancer Complexes.', 'The Mitochondrial Citrate Carrier SLC25A1/CIC and the Fundamental Role of Citrate in Cancer, Inflammation and Beyond.', 'DGAT1 Inhibitor Suppresses Prostate Tumor Growth and Migration by Regulating Intracellular Lipids and Non-Centrosomal MTOC Protein GM130.', 'The implications of signaling lipids in cancer metastasis.']"""

CSCs exhibit a spectrum of biological, biochemical, and molecular features that are consistent with a stem-like phenotype, including growth as non-adherent spheres (clonogenic potential), ability to form a new tumor in xenograft assays, unlimited self-renewal, and the capacity for multipotency and lineage-specific differentiation. PKCδ is a novel class serine/threonine kinase of the PKC family, and functions in a number of cellular activities including cell proliferation, survival or apoptosis. PKCδ has previously been validated as a synthetic lethal target in cancer cells of multiple types with aberrant activation of Ras signaling, using both genetic (shRNA and dominant-negative PKCδ mutants) and small molecule inhibitors. In contrast, PKCδ is not required for the proliferation or survival of normal cells, suggesting the potential tumor-specificity of a PKCδ-targeted approach.  Methods:   shRNA knockdown was used validate PKCδ as a target in primary cancer stem cell lines and stem-like cells derived from human tumor cell lines, including breast, pancreatic, prostate and melanoma tumor cells. Novel and potent small molecule PKCδ inhibitors were employed in assays monitoring apoptosis, proliferation and clonogenic capacity of these cancer stem-like populations. Significant differences among data sets were determined using two-tailed Student's t tests or ANOVA.  Results:   We demonstrate that CSC-like populations derived from multiple types of human primary tumors, from human cancer cell lines, and from transformed human cells, require PKCδ activity and are susceptible to agents which deplete PKCδ protein or activity. Inhibition of PKCδ by specific genetic strategies (shRNA) or by novel small molecule inhibitors is growth inhibitory and cytotoxic to multiple types of human CSCs in culture. PKCδ inhibition efficiently prevents tumor sphere outgrowth from tumor cell cultures, with exposure times as short as six hours. Small-molecule PKCδ inhibitors also inhibit human CSC growth in vivo in a mouse xenograft model.

In SMCB, the size of cancer burden was highest for men with lung cancer (SMCB=18) and for women with breast cancer (SMCB=14) in MDR (more developed regions) compared to the size of burden in LDR (lower developed regions) (lung, SMCB=11, breast, SMCB=8). For men, the size of cancer burden by region was highest in EURO (SMCB=18, lung), followed by WPRO (SMCB=16, lung), PAHO (SMCB=14, prostate), AFRO (SMCB=8, prostate) and SEARO (SMCB=7, lung). Moreover, for women, the size of cancer burden was greatest in EURO (SMCB=14, breast), followed by PAHO (SMCB=13, breast), AFRO (SMCB=11, cervix uteri), EMRO (SMCB=9, breast) or SEARO (SMCB=8, cervix uteri) and WPRO (SMCB=7, lung).

Methods:   We determined the expressions of Cx26, Cx32 and Cx43 in the paraffin samples from 31 cases of PCa and 23 cases of BPH by SABC immunohistochemical staining, and analyzed the relationship of their expressions with the clinical and pathological parameters of PCa and BPH using the semiquantitative method.  Results:   The positive expressions of Cx26 in BPH and PCa were 82.6% and 74.2%, respectively (chi2 = 0.541, P > 0.05), those of Cx32 were 78.3% and 61.3% (chi2 = 1.763, P > 0.05), and those of Cx43 were 87.0% and 38.7% (chi2 = 12.730, P < 0.01). The staining intensities of Cx26 and Cx43 were negatively correlated with the malignant phenotype of PCa (rCx26 = -0.476, P < 0.01; rCx43 = -0.484, P < 0.01), but not the expression of Cx32 (r = -0.242, P > 0.05). The three Cxs exhibited no correlation with the age and serum PSA level of the patients (P > 0.05), nor among their expressions (P > 0.05).  Conclusion:   Cx26, Cx32 and Cx43 are expressed in different degrees in BPH and PCa tissues. Cx43 plays a role in the occurrence and progression of PCa, and may serve as a new marker of PCa besides PSA as well as a new target in the biotherapy of PCa.

Loss of imprinting(LOI) of Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) during aging is important in tumorigenesis, yet the regulatory mechanisms driving this event are largely unknown. In this study oxidative stress, measured by increased NF-κB activity, induces LOI in both cancerous and noncancerous human prostate cells. Decreased expression of the enhancer-blocking element CCCTC-binding factor(CTCF) results in reduced binding of CTCF to the H19-ICR (imprint control region), a major factor in the allelic silencing of IGF2. This ICR then develops increased DNA methylation. Assays identify a recruitment of the canonical pathway proteins NF-κB p65 and p50 to the CTCF promoter associated with the co-repressor HDAC1 explaining gene repression. An IκBα super-repressor blocks oxidative stress-induced activation of NF-κB and IGF2 imprinting is maintained. In vivo experiments using IκBα mutant mice with continuous NF-κB activation demonstrate increased IGF2 LOI further confirming a central role for canonical NF-κB signaling. We conclude CTCF plays a central role in mediating the effects of NF-κB activation that result in altered imprinting both in vitro and in vivo.

The inputs to the controller block are the frequency, rotation rate, and applied power level of an interstitial applicator, and the output is the boundary temperature during treatment. The time-varying gains of the new controller are updated over time using Lyapunov-based stability analysis. The robustness of the new controller to changes in the parameters of the tissue is investigated and compared to a constant gain controller through simulation studies.

The OAR values (median; 95 % confidence interval, CI) were: rectum: D30 % = 60.7 Gy (59.40-62.04 Gy) and 48.2 Gy (46.40-52.72 Gy), D60 % = 34.1 Gy (28.50-38.92 Gy) and 27.7 Gy (21.80-31.51 Gy); bladder: D30 % = 57.3 Gy (45.83-64.53 Gy) and 46.4 Gy (33.23-61.48 Gy), D50 % = 16.4 Gy (11.89-42.38 Gy) and 17.2 Gy (10.97-27.90 Gy), for DA and RA, respectively. Treatment times were very similar, whereas the monitor units (MU) were 550 ± 29 versus 277 ± 3 for RA and DA, respectively.  Conclusion:   Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) show improvements in OAR sparing with RA. However, the RA technique is associated with almost double the number of MUs compared to DA. Regarding the PTV, DA is slightly superior in terms of D2 % and dose homogeneity. On the whole, the results suggest that RA be the favorable technique.""","""['R Cambria', 'F Cattani', 'B A Jereczek-Fossa', 'F Pansini', 'D Ciardo', 'S Vigorito', 'S Russo', 'D Zerini', 'L Cozzi', 'R Orecchia']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Volumetric-modulated arc therapy vs. c-IMRT in esophageal cancer: a treatment planning comparison.', 'Comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and forward-planning dynamic arc therapy techniques for prostate cancer.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy for the treatment of a large planning target volume in thoracic esophageal cancer.', 'Postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a comparison of four consensus guidelines and dosimetric evaluation of 3D-CRT versus tomotherapy IMRT.', 'Relationship between pelvic organ-at-risk dose and clinical target volume in postprostatectomy patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Impact of image guidance on toxicity and tumour outcome in moderately hypofractionated external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Early and late toxicity profiles of patients receiving immediate postoperative radiotherapy versus salvage radiotherapy for prostate cancer after prostatectomy.', 'On correlations in IMRT planning aims.', 'Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy of benign skull-base tumors: a dosimetric comparison of volumetric modulated arc therapy with Rapidarc® versus non-coplanar dynamic arcs.', 'Planning for mARC treatments with the Eclipse treatment planning system.']"""

Androgen ablation therapy induces expression of constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants that drive disease progression. Taxanes are a standard of care therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC); however, mechanisms underlying the clinical activity of taxanes are poorly understood. Recent work suggests that the microtubule network of prostate cells is critical for androgen receptor nuclear translocation and activity. In this study, we used a set of androgen receptor deletion mutants to identify the microtubule-binding domain of the androgen receptor, which encompasses the DNA binding domain plus hinge region. We report that two clinically relevant androgen receptor splice variants, ARv567 and ARv7, differentially associate with microtubules and dynein motor protein, thereby resulting in differential taxane sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. ARv7, which lacks the hinge region, did not co-sediment with microtubules or coprecipitate with dynein motor protein, unlike ARv567. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of ARv7 was unaffected by taxane treatment. In contrast, the microtubule-interacting splice variant ARv567 was sensitive to taxane-induced microtubule stabilization. In ARv567-expressing LuCap86.2 tumor xenografts, docetaxel treatment was highly efficacious, whereas ARv7-expressing LuCap23.1 tumor xenografts displayed docetaxel resistance. Our results suggest that androgen receptor variants that accumulate in CRPC cells utilize distinct pathways of nuclear import that affect the antitumor efficacy of taxanes, suggesting a mechanistic rationale to customize treatments for patients with CRPC, which might improve outcomes.""","""['Maria Thadani-Mulero#', 'Luigi Portella#', 'Shihua Sun', 'Matthew Sung', 'Alexandre Matov', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Eva Corey', 'David M Nanus', 'Stephen R Plymate', 'Paraskevi Giannakakou']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Androgen receptor splice variants circumvent AR blockade by microtubule-targeting agents.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Taxane-induced blockade to nuclear accumulation of the androgen receptor predicts clinical responses in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Minnelide Inhibits Androgen Dependent, Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Growth by Decreasing Expression of Androgen Receptor Full Length and Splice Variants.', 'Impact of taxanes on androgen receptor signaling.', 'Crosstalk between Microtubule Stabilizing Agents and Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of FKBP52 on cell proliferation and hormone-dependent cancers.', 'Mechanistic Investigation of the Androgen Receptor DNA-Binding Domain and Modulation via Direct Interactions with DNA Abasic Sites: Understanding the Mechanisms Involved in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Osteopontin and Cancer: Insights into Its Role in Drug Resistance.', 'Inhibition of Mps1 kinase enhances taxanes efficacy in castration resistant prostate cancer.']"""

We first conducted dose measurements in a water phantom. X-ray source model parameters used in gCTD are obtained through a commissioning process. gCTD accuracy is demonstrated by comparing calculations with measurements in water and in CTDI phantoms. Twenty-five brain cancer patients are used to study dose in a standard-dose head protocol, and 25 prostate cancer patients are used to study dose in pelvis protocol and pelvis spotlight protocol. Mean dose to each organ is calculated. Mean dose to 2% voxels that have the highest dose is also computed to quantify the maximum dose. It is found that the mean dose value to an organ varies largely among patients. Moreover, dose distribution is highly non-homogeneous inside an organ. The maximum dose is found to be 1-3 times higher than the mean dose depending on the organ, and is up to eight times higher for the entire body due to the very high dose region in bony structures. High computational efficiency has also been observed in our studies, such that MC dose calculation time is less than 5 min for a typical case.""","""['Davide Montanari', 'Enrica Scolari', 'Chiara Silvestri', 'Yan Jiang Graves', 'Hao Yan', 'Laura Cervino', 'Roger Rice', 'Steve B Jiang', 'Xun Jia']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Personalized assessment of kV cone beam computed tomography doses in image-guided radiotherapy of pediatric cancer patients.', 'Fast Monte Carlo simulation for patient-specific CT/CBCT imaging dose calculation.', 'Implementation of full/half bowtie filter models in a commercial treatment planning system for kilovoltage cone-beam CT dose estimations.', 'Imaging dose from cone beam computed tomography in radiation therapy.', 'Kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography imaging dose estimation and optimization: Need of daily cone-beam computed tomography.', 'Small animal photon counting cone-beam CT on a preclinical radiation research platform to improve radiation dose calculation accuracy.', 'Improving dose calculation accuracy in preclinical radiation experiments using multi-energy element resolved cone-beam CT.', 'Validation of a deterministic linear Boltzmann transport equation solver for rapid CT dose computation using physical dose measurements in pediatric phantoms.', 'Deterministic linear Boltzmann transport equation solver for patient-specific CT dose estimation: Comparison against a Monte Carlo benchmark for realistic scanner configurations and patient models.', 'On the improvement of CBCT image quality for soft tissue-based SRS localization.']"""

The purpose of this study was to use second-generation sequencing technology to assess the frequency of deleterious mutations in 22 tumour suppressor genes in familial PrCa and estimate the relative risk of PrCa if these genes are mutated.  Methods:   Germline DNA samples from 191 men with 3 or more cases of PrCa in their family were sequenced for 22 tumour suppressor genes using Agilent target enrichment and Illumina technology. Analysis for genetic variation was carried out by using a pipeline consisting of BWA, Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and ANNOVAR. Clinical features were correlated with mutation status using standard statistical tests. Modified segregation analysis was used to determine the relative risk of PrCa conferred by the putative loss-of-function (LoF) mutations identified.  Results:   We discovered 14 putative LoF mutations in 191 samples (7.3%) and these mutations were more frequently associated with nodal involvement, metastasis or T4 tumour stage (P=0.00164). Segregation analysis of probands with European ancestry estimated that LoF mutations in any of the studied genes confer a relative risk of PrCa of 1.94 (95% CI: 1.56-2.42).  Conclusions:   These findings show that LoF mutations in DNA repair pathway genes predispose to familial PrCa and advanced disease and therefore warrants further investigation.

Patients and methods:   We collected data on patients who were admitted to our hospital for prostate cancer in the last thirteen years and of those in studies in the literature. The associations of clinical characteristics with survival were evaluated using Cox regression models.  Results:   This study included 94 patients (5 admitted to our hospital and 89 from studies in the literature) of prostate cancer with rectal involvement. 11 patients in the group of synchronous rectal involvement at first cancer diagnosis (n = 58) and 23 patients in the group of metachronous diagnosis of rectal involvement (n = 29) died at the latest follow up. The estimated overall survival rate (% ± SE) at 1, 3, and 5 years were 68.3 ± 5.3%, 54.4 ± 7.2%, and 38.1 ± 11.1%, respectively. In the Cox univariate analysis, Asian prostate cancer (p = 0.001) was associated with better survival, while rectal bleeding (p = 0.043), metachronous presentation of development of rectal involvement (p = 0.000), prior hormonal therapy (p = 0.000) and extrarectal metastases (p = 0.054) were associated with poor survival. In multivariate analysis, prior hormone therapy (HR = 14.540, p = 0.000) and rectal bleeding (HR = 2.195, p = 0.041) retained independent poor prognostic values. There were 13 patients survived for more than 3 years, the longest survival time was 96 months. Total pelvic extenteration (TPE) combined with hormonal therapy in 12 hormone-untreated prostate cancer give us six of thirteen long-term survivors for more than 3 years in this series.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that rectal involvement does not necessarily predict a worse outcome when presenting as a previously hormone-untreated disease and that the prognosis was worse when presenting as a hormone relapsed disease. Prior hormone therapy and rectal bleeding were associated independently with a significantly poor overall survival in prostate cancer patients with rectal involvement. TPE combined with hormonal therapy appears to confer better overall survival in hormonally untreated patients.

The current experiments were designed to investigate the effects of Zyflamend on the expression of class I and II histone deacetylases, a family of enzymes known to be over expressed in a variety of cancers.  Methods:   CWR22Rv1 cells, a castrate-resistant prostate cancer cell line, were treated with Zyflamend and the expression of class I and II histone deacetylases, along with their downstream target the tumor suppressor gene p21, was investigated. Involvement of p21 was confirmed with siRNA knockdown and over expression experiments.  Results:   Zyflamend down-regulated the expression of all class I and II histone deacetylases where Chinese goldthread and baikal skullcap (two of its components) appear to be primarily responsible for these results. In addition, Zyflamend up regulated the histone acetyl transferase complex CBP/p300, potentially contributing to the increase in histone 3 acetylation. Expression of the tumor suppressor gene p21, a known downstream target of histone deacetylases and CBP/p300, was increased by Zyflamend treatment and the effect on p21 was, in part, mediated through Erk1/2. Knockdown of p21 with siRNA technology attenuated Zyflamend-induced growth inhibition. Over expression of p21 inhibited cell growth and concomitant treatment with Zyflamend enhanced this effect.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that the extracts of this polyherbal combination increase histone 3 acetylation, inhibit the expression of class I and class II histone deacetylases, increase the activation of CBP/p300 and inhibit cell proliferation, in part, by up regulating p21 expression.""","""['E-Chu Huang', 'Yi Zhao', 'Guoxun Chen', 'Seung Joon Baek', 'Michael F McEntee', 'Steven Minkin', 'John P Biggerstaff', 'Jay Whelan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Complement Altern Med""","""['Concurrent regulation of LKB1 and CaMKK2 in the activation of AMPK in castrate-resistant prostate cancer by a well-defined polyherbal mixture with anticancer properties.', 'Zyflamend, a combination of herbal extracts, attenuates tumor growth in murine xenograft models of prostate cancer.', 'Zyflamend reduces the expression of androgen receptor in a model of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Zyflamend-mediated inhibition of human prostate cancer PC3 cell proliferation: effects on 12-LOX and Rb protein phosphorylation.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors: signalling towards p21cip1/waf1.', 'Epigenetic effects of herbal medicine.', 'Synergistic effects of natural products in combination with anticancer agents in prostate cancer: A scoping review.', 'Zyflamend induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells via modulation of the JNK pathway.', 'Zyflamend, a unique herbal blend, induces cell death and inhibits adipogenesis through the coordinated regulation of PKA and JNK.', 'Concurrent regulation of LKB1 and CaMKK2 in the activation of AMPK in castrate-resistant prostate cancer by a well-defined polyherbal mixture with anticancer properties.']"""

Multiparametric MRI depicted 45 of 50 cancer lesions (90.0%) in the peripheral zone and 8 of 11 (72.7%) in the transitional zone. Significant differences between the two modalities were found for the transitional zone and anterior part in prostates with volumes greater than 40 cm3 (p<0.05). Detection rates for high-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score≥4 and 3) and cancer lesions with volumes greater than 0.5 cm3 were high for both methods (93.8% and 80.5% for RTE, 87.5% and 92.7% for multiparametric MRI). Volumetric measurements of prostate cancer were more reliable with T2-weighted MRI than with RTE (Spearman rank correlation, 0.72 and 0.46).  Conclusion:   RTE and multiparametric MRI depicted high-risk prostate cancer with high sensitivity. However, multiparametric MRI seems to have advantages in tumor volume assessment and for the detection of prostate cancer in the transitional zone and anterior part within prostates larger than 40 cm3.""","""['Daniel Junker', 'Georg Schäfer', 'Conrad Kobel', 'Christian Kremser', 'Jasmin Bektic', 'Werner Jaschke', 'Friedrich Aigner']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Fusion of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Real-Time Elastography to Visualize Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Analysis using Whole Mount Sections after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Real-time sonoelastography compared to magnetic resonance imaging using four different modalities at 3.0 T in the detection of prostate cancer: strength and weaknesses.', 'Multiparametric 3T MRI in the evaluation of intraglandular prostate cancer: correlation with histopathology.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Advanced ultrasound in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Strain Elastography-Targeted Biopsy: Does Prostate Volume Affect Prostate Cancer Detection?', 'Stiffness of prostate gland measured by transrectal real-time shear wave elastography for detection of prostate cancer: a feasibility study.', 'Prostate cancer rates in patients with initially negative elastography-targeted biopsy vs. systematic biopsy.', 'Transrectal real-time tissue elastography targeted biopsy coupled with peak strain index improves the detection of clinically important prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Eighty consecutive patients (57 with central gland cancer and 23 without central gland cancer) were included in this study. All patients underwent T2-weighted imaging and DTI at 3 T, followed by surgery. For predicting central gland cancer, experienced and less-experienced radiologists independently analyzed T2-weighted imaging and combined T2-weighted imaging and DTI, respectively. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured for central gland cancers and BPH foci of stromal and glandular hyperplasia. Statistical analyses were performed using McNemar test, linear mixed model, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and kappa statistics.  Results:   For predicting central gland cancers, the area under the curve (Az) of combined T2-weighted imaging and DTI for the experienced (0.915) and less-experienced reader (0.753) was superior to that of T2-weighted imaging (0.723 vs 0.664; p<0.001). The mean ADC and FA values were 0.77×10(-3) mm2/s and 0.35, respectively, for central gland cancers, 1.22×10(-3) mm2/s and 0.26, respectively, for stromal hyperplasia foci, and 1.59×10(-3) mm2/s and 0.21, respectively, for glandular hyperplasia foci, and the values differed significantly. For differentiating central gland cancer from stromal hyperplasia foci and glandular hyperplasia foci, Az values of ADC versus FA were 0.989 and 1.0 versus 0.818 and 0.916, respectively, and the difference was statistically different.  Conclusion:   DTI at 3 T is useful for distinguishing central gland cancers from BPH foci, with significantly different ADC and FA values.

In 45 normal peripheral-zone ROIs and 65 prostate cancer ROIs (14 in the central gland), ADC values were estimated by use of several combinations of two or five b values and a monoexponential model. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to characterize the effectiveness of ADC values in distinguishing prostate cancer from normal-tissue ROIs, and we calculated Spearman rank-order correlation between ADC values and the Gleason score.  Results:   ADC values were often significantly different (p<0.001) when estimated from different combinations of two or five b values. However, except when both b values were less than or equal to 200 mm2/s or greater than or equal to 1500 mm2/s, the AUC value for distinguishing prostate cancer from normal-tissue ROIs was similar (0.88-0.93). The correlation coefficients between ADC values and the Gleason score were between -0.30 and -0.68.  Conclusion:   The choice of b values can significantly affect ADC estimates.

Materials and methods:   This study included 42 consecutive patients with biochemical recurrence after external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). At the time of biopsy, the mean age±SD was 67±6 years, median serum prostate-specific antigen level was 4.0±3.0 ng/mL, and mean elapsed time between EBRT and biopsy was 5.6±2.8 years. MRI examination included high-resolution axial T2-weighted and DWI sequences and was classified as either negative or positive. Transrectal ultrasound-guided targeted biopsies were obtained from all patients with positive findings on MRI using a soft image fusion system. Random sextant biopsies were obtained from both lobes in patients with negative findings on MRI and from the lobe contralateral to the MRI target in patients with positive findings on MRI. The biopsy results were classified as negative or positive and defined as the criterion standard.  Results:   MRI findings were positive in 40 of 42 (95%) patients, and the overall positive biopsy rate was 79% (33 of 42 patients). Targeted biopsies were positive in 33 of 40 (83%) patients.

There are a few reports of hem-o-lok clip migration into the bladder or vesico-urethral anastomosis and only four cases of hem-o-lok clip migration resulting into bladder neck contracture. Herein, we describe the first case, to our knowledge, of hem-o-lok clip migration leading to severe bladder neck contracture and subsequent stress urinary incontinence.  Case presentation:   A 62-year-old Caucasian man underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for a T1c Gleason 8 prostate cancer. One month after surgery the patient was fully continent; however, three months later, he presented with acute urinary retention requiring suprapubic drainage. Urethroscopy showed a hem-o-lok clip strongly attached to the area between the vesico-urethral anastomosis and the urethral sphincter and a severe bladder neck contracture behind it. Following cold-knife urethral incision and clip removal, the bladder neck contracture was widely resected. At 3-month follow-up, the patient voided spontaneously with a peak flow rate of 9.5 ml/sec and absence of post-void residual urine, but leaked 240 ml urine at the 24-hour pad test. To date, at 1-year follow-up, his voiding situation remains unchanged.

Microarray technologies have been widely used to characterize aberrant miRNA expression patterns in cancer. Nevertheless, the miRNAs expression signatures identified for a same cancer differs among laboratories due to the cancer heterogeneity. In addition, how the deregulated miRNAs coordinately contribute to the tumourigenic process of prostate cancer remains elusive.  Results:   We evaluated five outlier detection algorithms that take into account the heterogeneity of cancer samples. ORT was selected as the best method and applied to four prostate cancer associated microRNA expression datasets. After microRNA target prediction and pathway enrichment mapping, 38 Gene Ontology terms, 16 KEGG pathways and 99 GeneGO pathways are found putative prostate cancer associated. Comparison with our previous studies, we identified two putative novel pathways important in prostate cancer. The two novel pathways are 1) ligand-independent activation of ESR1 and ESR2 and 2) membrane-bound ESR1: interaction with growth factors signalling.  Conclusions:   We proved that expression signatures of at the pathway level well address the cancer heterogeneity and are more consistent than at the miRNA/gene levels.

Given that SDC is biologically similar to breast and prostate cancer, anti-androgenic receptor (AR) and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapies have the potential to exert effects, not only on patients with breast and prostate cancer but also on those with SDC.  Methods:   The expression levels of HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Ki-67, and AR were assessed in 32 patients with SDC, and their correlations with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed retrospectively. SDC was classified into five subtypes using a method similar to that used for breast cancer.  Results:   Anti-AR, HER2, and EGFR were positive in 23 (71.9 %), 14 (43.8 %), and 26 (81.3 %) cases, respectively. One or more of these 3 factors were positive in 30 (93.8 %) cases. The Ki-67 labeling index was greater than 15 % in all cases. While molecular status did not correlate with OS, EGFR and AR positivity were significantly associated with DFS in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that EGFR was the only independent predictor of DFS.  Conclusions:   The statuses of some molecules are useful to predict DFS in patients with SDC. Ki-67 overexpression suggests that cytotoxic agents are effective for SDC. Since the majority of SDCs express AR, HER2, and/or EGFR, assessing and targeting these molecules are promising strategies to improve the prognosis of unresectable, metastatic or recurrent SDC, and a classification system according to the molecular expression status may be useful to select appropriate therapy.""","""['Tatsuo Masubuchi', 'Yuichiro Tada', 'Shin-ichiro Maruya', 'Yoshiyuki Osamura', 'Shin-etsu Kamata', 'Kouki Miura', 'Chihiro Fushimi', 'Hideaki Takahashi', 'Daisuke Kawakita', 'Seiji Kishimoto', 'Toshitaka Nagao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Impact of postoperative radiotherapy and HER2/new overexpression in salivary duct carcinoma : A\xa0monocentric clinicopathologic analysis.', 'The clinicopathological significance of the adipophilin and fatty acid synthase expression in salivary duct carcinoma.', 'A clinicopathological study and prognostic factor analysis of 177 salivary duct carcinoma patients from The Netherlands.', 'Role of HER2 in Prognosis of Salivary Duct Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Salivary Duct Carcinoma: An Update on Morphologic Mimics and Diagnostic Use of Androgen Receptor Immunohistochemistry.', 'Prognostic value and clinicopathological roles of the tumor immune microenvironment in salivary duct carcinoma.', 'Clinicopathologic Factors and Their Association with\xa0Outcomes of Salivary Duct Carcinoma: A Multicenter Experience.', 'The Therapeutic Landscape of Salivary Gland Malignancies-Where Are We Now?', 'Noteworthy Factors to Decide Therapeutic Strategy for Carcinoma ex Pleomorphic Adenoma of Parotid Gland: A Preliminary Study Statistical Analysis of 22 Cases from Single Institution.', 'Identification of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers in salivary duct carcinoma via comprehensive molecular profiling.']"""

Prostate cancer risk was inversely associated with total dietary fiber intake (HR of quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.81; P = 0.001), insoluble (HR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.78; P = 0.001), and legume (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.95; P = 0.04) fiber intakes. In contrast, we found no association between prostate cancer risk and soluble (P = 0.1), cereal (P = 0.7), vegetable (P = 0.9), and fruit (P = 0.4) fiber intakes. In conclusion, dietary fiber intake (total, insoluble, and from legumes but not soluble or from cereals, vegetables, and fruits) was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk, consistent with mechanistic data.""","""['Mélanie Deschasaux', 'Camille Pouchieu', 'Mathilde His', 'Serge Hercberg', 'Paule Latino-Martel', 'Mathilde Touvier']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Nutr""","""['Associations between fruit, vegetable and legume intakes and prostate cancer risk: results from the prospective Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) cohort.', 'Prospective association between alcohol intake and hormone-dependent cancer risk: modulation by dietary fiber intake.', 'Prospective association between dietary folate intake and skin cancer risk: results from the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants cohort.', 'Dietary Patterns and Breast, Colorectal, Lung, and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review Internet.', 'Cereal grains, legumes and diabetes.', 'Healthy dietary patterns, foods, and risk of glioma: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'Adherence to plant-based dietary patterns in relation to glioma: a case-control study.', ""Dietary patterns with combined and site-specific cancer incidence in Alberta's Tomorrow Project cohort."", 'Oxidative Stress, Diet and Prostate Cancer.', 'Dietary Nutrient Patterns and Prostate Cancer Risk: A Case-Control Study from Iran.']"""

In the conventional technique, the bladder neck was transected first. In the modified ultradissection, the lateral border of the bladder neck was dissected and then the bladder neck was transected while the detrusor muscle of the bladder was well visualized. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes and PSM rates were analyzed retrospectively for pT2 patients (n＝217), focusing on a comparison of those undergoing conventional (n＝113) and modified ultradissection (n＝104) techniques. There was no difference between the conventional and modified ultradissection group in mean age, BMI, PSA, prostate volume, biopsy Gleason score, and D'Amico prognostic criteria distributions. The mean operative time was shorter (p＜0.001) and the estimated blood loss was less (p＜0.01) in the modified ultradissection group. The PSM rate for the bladder neck was significantly reduced by modified ultradissection, from 6.2% to 0% (p＜0.05).

We found that ctDNA was detectable in >75% of patients with advanced pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal, bladder, gastroesophageal, breast, melanoma, hepatocellular, and head and neck cancers, but in less than 50% of primary brain, renal, prostate, or thyroid cancers. In patients with localized tumors, ctDNA was detected in 73, 57, 48, and 50% of patients with colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast adenocarcinoma, respectively. ctDNA was often present in patients without detectable circulating tumor cells, suggesting that these two biomarkers are distinct entities. In a separate panel of 206 patients with metastatic colorectal cancers, we showed that the sensitivity of ctDNA for detection of clinically relevant KRAS gene mutations was 87.2% and its specificity was 99.2%. Finally, we assessed whether ctDNA could provide clues into the mechanisms underlying resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor blockade in 24 patients who objectively responded to therapy but subsequently relapsed. Twenty-three (96%) of these patients developed one or more mutations in genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

Predictive biomarkers play an important role in this respect being already useful in management of breast cancer and melanoma. For example, HER-2/neu (HER-2) overexpression selects for breast cancer patients to be treated with trastuzumab, and BRAFV600E mutations select for melanoma patients to be treated with vemurafenib. Identification of factors associated with T cell responsiveness to vaccination remains critical. Pre-existent immunity and circulating suppressor cells may regulate the levels of vaccine-specific T cell immunity after vaccination. The identification of immunologic endpoints to immunotherapy would thus considerably help guide the development of immunotherapy-based clinical trials. This commentary is based on a retrospective analysis we performed of data from prostate cancer patients vaccinated and boosted with the AE37 vaccine. The aim of these exploratory analyses was to identify factors useful in predicting which patients are more likely to respond to the treatment under study.

Additionally, the spatial distribution of organ-confined prostate cancer between PBx and rPBx was evaluated.  Results:   Prostate cancer diagnosed on PBx was mostly localised to the apical portion and the peripheral zone of the prostate. Prostate cancer diagnosed on rPBx was more frequently found in the anterior portion and the base of the prostate. Organ-confined prostate cancer foci were mostly localised in the dorsolateral zone of the prostate in men at PBx, whereas men at rPBx had more prostate cancer foci in the anterior portion.

Despite a significant morbidity and mortality to a lesser extent, the etiology of prostate cancer remains largely unknown. Indeed, the only well-established risk factors to date are age, ethnicity and a family history of prostate cancer. We present, here, the rationale and design of the EPIdemiological study of Prostate CAncer (EPICAP), a population-based case-control study specifically designed to investigate the role of environmental and genetic factors in prostate cancer. The EPICAP study will particularly focused on the role of circadian disruption, chronic inflammation, hormonal and metabolic factors in the occurrence of prostate cancer.  Methods/design:   EPICAP is a population-based case-control study conducted in the département of Hérault in France. Eligible cases are all cases of prostate cancers newly diagnosed in 2012-2013 in men less than 75 years old and residing in the département of Hérault at the time of diagnosis. Controls are men of the same age as the cases and living in the département of Hérault, recruited in the general population.The sample will include a total of 1000 incident cases of prostate cancer and 1000 population-based controls over a 3-year period (2012-2014).The cases and controls are face-to-face interviewed using a standardized computed assisted questionnaire. The questions focus primarily on usual socio-demographic characteristics, personal and family medical history, lifestyle, leisure activities, residential and occupational history. Anthropometric measures and biological samples are also collected for cases and controls.  Discussion:   The EPICAP study aims to answer key questions in prostate cancer etiology: (1) role of circadian disruption through the study of working hours, chronotype and duration/quality of sleep, (2) role of chronic inflammation and anti-inflammatory drugs, (3) role of hormonal and metabolic factors through a detailed questionnaire, (4) role of individual genetic susceptibility of genes involved in biological pathways of interest. The EPICAP study will also allow us to study prognostic factors and tumor aggressiveness.Taken together, the EPICAP study will provide a comprehensive framework to go further in the understanding of prostate cancer occurrence and its prognosis.""","""['Florence Menegaux', 'Antoinette Anger', 'Hasina Randrianasolo', 'Claire Mulot', 'Pierre Laurent-Puig', 'François Iborra', 'Jean-Pierre Bringer', 'Benoit Leizour', 'Rodolphe Thuret', 'Pierre-Jean Lamy', 'Xavier Rébillard', 'Brigitte Trétarre;EPICAP Study Group']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Prostatitis, other genitourinary infections and prostate cancer risk: Influence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs?

Among low-risk tumours (stage cT1 and s-PSA 4-10 ng/mL) Gleason score 7-10 increased from 16% in 1998 to 40% in 2011 (P trend < 0.001), mean 19% and 33% before and after 2005 (P < 0.001). Among high-risk tumours (stage T3 and s-PSA 20-50 ng/mL) Gleason score 7-10 increased from 65% in 1998 to 94% in 2011 (P trend < 0.001), mean 78% and 90% before and after 2005 (P < 0.001). A Gleason score of 2-5 was reported in 27% in 1998 and 1% in 2011. Gleason score 5 decreased sharply after 2005 and Gleason score 2-4 was almost abandoned.  Conclusions:   There has been a gradual shift towards higher Gleason grading, which started before 2005 but became more evident after the ISUP 2005 revision. Among low-stage tumours reporting of Gleason score 7-10 was more than doubled during the study period. When corrected for stage migration upgrading is considerable over recent decades. This has clinical consequences for therapy decisions such as eligibility for active surveillance. Grading systems need to be as stable as possible to enable comparisons over time and to facilitate the interpretation of the prognostic impact of grade.""","""['Daniela Danneman', 'Linda Drevin', 'David Robinson', 'Pär Stattin', 'Lars Egevad']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Population based study of predictors of adverse pathology among candidates for active surveillance with Gleason 6 prostate cancer.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Pathological and biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy in men with low-risk prostate cancer meeting the Prostate Cancer International: Active Surveillance criteria.', 'The impact of the 2005 international society of urological pathology consensus conference on standard Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma in needle biopsies.', 'Implications of the International Society of Urological Pathology modified Gleason grading system.', 'Looking for a Simplified Diagnostic Model to Identify Potentially Lethal Cases of Prostate Cancer at Initial Diagnosis: An ImGO Pilot Study.', 'Temporal changes in cause-specific death in men with localised prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: a population-based, nationwide study.', 'Exploration on Gleason score variation trend of patients with prostate carcinoma from 1996 to 2019: a retrospective single center study.', 'Prostate cancer grading, time to go back to the future.', 'Prognostic features of Annexin A2 expression in prostate cancer.']"""

A fraction of these are live CTCs with potential of metastatic colonization whereas others are at various stages of apoptosis making them likely to be less relevant to understanding the disease. Isolation and characterization of live CTCs may augment information yielded by standard enumeration to help physicians to more accurately establish diagnosis, choose therapy, monitor response, and provide prognosis. We previously reported on a group of near-infrared (NIR) heptamethine carbocyanine dyes that are specifically and actively transported into live cancer cells. In this study, this viable tumor cell-specific behavior was utilized to detect live CTCs in prostate cancer patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 40 patients with localized prostate cancer together with 5 patients with metastatic disease were stained with IR-783, the prototype heptamethine cyanine dye. Stained cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis to identify live (NIR(+)) CTCs from the pool of total CTCs, which were identified by EpCAM staining. In patients with localized tumor, live CTC counts corresponded with total CTC numbers. Higher live CTC counts were seen in patients with larger tumors and those with more aggressive pathologic features including positive margins and/or lymph node invasion. Even higher CTC numbers (live and total) were detected in patients with metastatic disease. Live CTC counts declined when patients were receiving effective treatments, and conversely the counts tended to rise at the time of disease progression. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of applying of this staining technique to identify live CTCs, creating an opportunity for further molecular interrogation of a more biologically relevant CTC population.""","""['Chen Shao', 'Chun-Peng Liao', 'Peizhen Hu', 'Chia-Yi Chu', 'Lei Zhang', 'Matthew H T Bui', 'Christopher S Ng', 'David Y Josephson', 'Beatrice Knudsen', 'Mourad Tighiouart', 'Hyung L Kim', 'Haiyen E Zhau', 'Leland W K Chung', 'Ruoxiang Wang', 'Edwin M Posadas']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Limited prognostic value of preoperative circulating tumor cells for early biochemical recurrence in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Analogous detection of circulating tumor cells using the AccuCyte® -CyteFinder® system and ISET system in patients with locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Nanoroughened adhesion-based capture of circulating tumor cells with heterogeneous expression and metastatic characteristics.', 'Detection of circulating tumor cells from peripheral blood in prostate cancer.', 'Circulating tumor cells: advances in detection methods, biological issues, and clinical relevance.', 'A cisplatin conjugate with tumor cell specificity exhibits antitumor effects in renal cancer models.', 'Deep learning assisted holography microscopy for in-flow enumeration of tumor cells in blood.', 'Accurate prostate cancer detection based on enrichment and characterization of prostate cancer specific circulating tumor cells.', 'Novel DZ-SIM Conjugate Targets Cancer Mitochondria and Prolongs Survival in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Detection of live breast cancer cells in bright-field microscopy images containing white blood cells by image analysis and deep learning.']"""

Using The Cancer Genome Atlas, overexpression of the GABA synthetic enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1), was found to be associated with decreased disease free-survival in prostate adenocarcinoma and decreased overall survival in clear cell renal cell carcinomas. Furthermore, GAD1 was found to be expressed in castrate-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, but not androgen-responsive cell lines. Using a novel fluorescence-coupled enzymatic microplate assay for GABA mediated through reduction of resazurin in a prostate neuroendocrine carcinoma (PNEC) cell line, acid microenvironment-induced stress increased GABA levels while alkaline microenvironment-induced stress decreased GABA through modulation of GAD1 and glutamine synthetase (GLUL) activities. Moreover, glutamine but not glucose deprivation decreased GABA through modulation of GLUL. Consistent with evidence in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms that GABA synthesis mediated through GAD1 may play a crucial role in surviving stress, GABA may be an important mediator of stress survival in neoplasms.

Increasing evidences show that autophagy involves in the development of neuroendocrine (NE) tumors, including PCa. To clarify the effect of autophagy on NED, androgen-sensitive PCa LNCaP cells were examined. Treatment of LNCaP cells with IL-6 resulted in an induction of autophagy. In the absence of androgen, IL-6 caused an even stronger activation of autophagy. Similar result was identified in NED induction. Inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) markedly decreased NED. This observation was confirmed by beclin1 and Atg5 silencing experiments. Further supporting the role of autophagy in NED, we found that LC3 was up-regulated in PCa tissue that had relapsed after androgen-deprivation therapy when compared with their primary tumor counterpart. LC3 staining in relapsed PCa tissue showed punctate pattern similar to the staining of chromogranin A (CgA), a marker for NED cells. Moreover, autophagy inhibition induced the apoptosis of IL-6 induced NE differentiated PCa cells. Consistently, inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of beclin1 or Atg5 sensitized NE differentiated LNCaP cells to etoposide, a chemotherapy drug. To identify the mechanisms, phosphorylation of IL-6 downstream targets was analyzed. An increase in phospho-AMPK and a decrease in phospho-mTOR were found, which implies that IL-6 regulates autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Most important to this study is the discovery of REST, a neuronal gene-specific transcriptional repressor that is involved in autophagy activation. REST was down-regulated in IL-6 treatment. Knockdown experiments suggest that REST is critical to NED and autophagy activation by IL-6. Together, our studies imply that autophagy is involved in PCa progression and plays a cytoprotective role when NED is induced in PCa cells by IL-6 treatment.

All five compounds were screened for cytotoxic activities on LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell-lines. Among the five compounds, the new alkaloid, subditine (1), demonstrated the most potent cell growth inhibition activity and selective against LNCaP with an IC50 of 12.24±0.19 µM and PC-3 with an IC50 of 13.97±0.32 µM, compared to RWPE human normal epithelial cell line (IC50 = 30.48±0.08 µM). Subditine (1) treatment induced apoptosis in LNCaP and PC-3 as evidenced by increased cell permeability, disruption of cytoskeletal structures and increased nuclear fragmentation. In addition, subditine (1) enhanced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as reflected by increased expression of glutathione reductase (GR) to scavenge damaging free radicals in both prostate cancer cell-lines. Excessive ROS could lead to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase 9, 3/7 activation. Further Western blot analyses showed subditine (1) induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl expression, whereas p53 was up-regulated in LNCaP (p53-wild-type), but not in PC-3 (p53-null).

Yet, recent trends suggest that PET is increasingly used for follow-up among patients with cancer. This study investigates whether information-seeking behaviors predicted self-reported utilization of PET for routine surveillance in patients with colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted annual surveys for 3 years in a cohort of Pennsylvania cancer survivors diagnosed with colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer in 2005. The outcome was self-reported PET receipt for routine surveillance among 944 patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic disease (stages 0-III). Predictors included cancer-related information seeking from nonmedical sources and providers. Weighted multiple logistic regression analyses were performed.  Results:   In this population, 11% of patients reported receiving at least one PET scan for routine follow-up in a 12-month period several years after diagnosis. Seeking cancer-related information from nonmedical sources was associated with higher odds of subsequent reported PET use [OR, 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-12.1; P = 0.032], after adjusting for potential confounders. Patient engagement with physicians about cancer-related information was not a significant predictor.  Conclusions:   Overall reported PET utilization for routine surveillance of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer is low. However, we found a significant association with information seeking from nonmedical sources but not from providers.

Here, we identified syndecan-1 as a key molecule maintaining the stability of prostate cancer TICs. Holoclones harbouring the biological properties of stemness were derived from single-cell cultures of the PC3 human prostate cancer cell line. These holoclones over-expressed syndecan-1, but showed reduced expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX) and synthesis of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen radicals. Stable RNA-mediated silencing of syndecan-1 gene expression up-regulated NOX-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species and reduced the survival of holoclones in vitro. Syndecan-1 down-regulation also strongly reduced the number of CD133(+)/CD44(+) primitive cancer cells and tumour growth in vivo. Interestingly, syndecan-1 gene knockdown significantly enhanced the tumour-suppressive effects of docetaxel by inhibiting the docetaxel-induced increase in CD133(+)/CD44(+) cells in vivo. In the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model of prostate cancer, early intervention with a syndecan-1 inhibitor (OGT2115) or syndecan-1 RNAi reduced the incidence of adenocarcinoma and the number of c-kit(+)/CD44(+) cells in cancer foci.

Treatment and prognosis of prostate cancer necessitate management of long-term consequences of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), including accelerated bone loss resulting in osteoporosis. Osteoporotic fractures are associated with excess morbidity and mortality.  Material and methods:   Patients with prostate cancer awaiting initiation of ADT were consecutively included. Half of the patients had localized disease and were referred for curative intended radiation, and the remaining patients had disseminated disease. Blood samples were collected, a questionnaire was administered and a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan was performed before initiating ADT. The patients were included between January 2010 and March 2012. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. None of the patients had received prior androgen deprivation or osteoporosis treatment.  Results:   In total, 105 individuals were included. The mean age of the participants was 70 years (range 53-91 years, SD 6.3). The median prostate-specific antigen level was 30.5 g/l (1-5714 g/l). The average Gleason score was 7.8 (range 5-10, SD 1.1). Fifty patients had localized prostate cancer and the other 55 patients had disseminated disease. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 10% and the prevalence of osteopenia was 58% before ADT. There was no significant difference between the two subgroups concerning osteoporosis. Smoking use was the only factor that was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of osteoporosis in the study population.

Objective:   To investigate SPOP mutations across diverse cohorts and validate a series of assays employing high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis and Sanger sequencing for mutational analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material.  Design setting and participants:   720 prostate cancer samples from six international cohorts spanning Caucasian, African American, and Asian patients, including both prostate-specific antigen-screened and unscreened populations, were screened for their SPOP mutation status. Status of SPOP was correlated to molecular features (ERG rearrangement, PTEN deletion, and CHD1 deletion) as well as clinical and pathologic features.  Results and limitations:   Overall frequency of SPOP mutations was 8.1% (4.6% to 14.4%), SPOP mutation was inversely associated with ERG rearrangement (P<.01), and SPOP mutant (SPOPmut) cancers had higher rates of CHD1 deletions (P<.01). There were no significant differences in biochemical recurrence in SPOPmut cancers. Limitations of this study include missing mutational data due to sample quality and lack of power to identify a difference in clinical outcomes.  Conclusion:   SPOP is mutated in 4.6% to 14.4% of patients with prostate cancer across different ethnic and demographic backgrounds.

A novel strategy to overcome resistance is to directly target the apoptotic pathway in cancer cells. Apigenin, an anticancer agent, selectively toxic to cancer cells induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through mechanisms which are not fully explored. In the present study we provide novel insight into the mechanisms of apoptosis induction by apigenin. Treatment of androgen-refractory human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells with apigenin resulted in dose-dependent suppression of XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and survivin protein levels. Apigenin treatment resulted in significant decrease in cell viability and apoptosis induction with the increase of cytochrome C in time-dependent manner. These effects of apigenin were accompanied by decrease in Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 and increase in the active form of Bax protein. The apigenin-mediated increase in Bax was due to dissociation of Bax from Ku70 which is essential for apoptotic activity of Bax. Apigenin treatment resulted in the inhibition of class I histone deacetylases and HDAC1 protein expression, thereby increasing the acetylation of Ku70 and the dissociation of Bax resulting in apoptosis of cancer cells. Furthermore, apigenin significantly reduced HDAC1 occupancy at the XIAP promoter, suggesting that histone deacetylation might be critical for XIAP downregulation. These results suggest that apigenin targets inhibitor of apoptosis proteins and Ku70-Bax interaction in the induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and in athymic nude mouse xenograft model endorsing its in vivo efficacy.""","""['Sanjeev Shukla', 'Pingfu Fu', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Apoptosis""","""['Plant flavone apigenin inhibits HDAC and remodels chromatin to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells: in vitro and in vivo study.', 'Maspin increases Ku70 acetylation and Bax-mediated cell death in cancer cells.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors sensitize lung cancer cells to hyperthermia: involvement of Ku70/SirT-1 in thermo-protection.', 'DeubiKuitylation: a novel DUB enzymatic activity for the DNA repair protein, Ku70.', 'Bax-induced apoptosis shortens the life span of DNA repair defect Ku70-knockout mice by inducing emphysema.', 'An Update on the Therapeutic Anticancer Potential of Ocimum sanctum L.: ""Elixir of Life"".', 'The Involvement of Natural Polyphenols in Molecular Mechanisms Inducing Apoptosis in Tumor Cells: A Promising Adjuvant in Cancer Therapy.', 'Agri-Food By-Products in Cancer: New Targets and Strategies.', 'Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss.

Methods:   Primary NMIUC tissue specimens (n = 162) were analyzed by qPCR. Immunohistochemical staining was also performed on 63 subsets of NMIUC tissues. The present study was also undertaken in order to verify the effect of DHCR24 on human urothelial carcinoma cells.  Results:   The mRNA expression levels of DHCR24 were significantly higher for patients in with higher grades of tumors than for those with lower grades of tumors (P = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed significant differences in the time to progression between low- and high-mRNA expression groups (log-rank test, P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the level of DHCR24 expression is an independent predictor of progression (hazard ratio, 5.464; 95 % confidence interval, 1.746-17.099; P = 0.004). The results of immunohistochemical staining were generally concordant with mRNA expression levels. Enforced expression of DHCR24 caused proliferation, adhesion, and migration, while DHCR24 loss resulted in slower proliferation and a reduction in cell viabilities compared with control cells.

Questions and methods:   There are a number of reasons why cancer screening tests might not be covered by insurers. The main reasons are because the test does not have any clear benefits, and because the harms outweigh the benefits. This article describes the fundamental difficulties of, and the requirements imposed on, benefit assessments of cancer screening tests.  Results:   Cancer screening tests that are available as individual out-of-pocket health services are always potentially harmful, while their benefit is either not clear or contested, or there is clearly no benefit.  Discussion:   Health-care providers who offer cancer screening tests are required to provide interested people with relevant information on the related benefits, harms, and uncertainties of the tests, so as to enable an informed decision.

Implementation of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test as an early detection tool has led to a significant reduction of prostate cancer mortality in the USA. Apart from an earlier detection of clinically relevant tumors, regular PSA testing increases the risk of over-detection and over-treatment of clinically indolent tumors. In our view, a reliable stratification of indolent tumors in active surveillance programs is the key in avoiding or reducing overtreatment of early diagnosed prostate cancers.

In this report, we investigated the role of glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2) in CRPC. GPX2 expression was analyzed in rat and human CRPC cells. Next, we determined the proliferation rate and level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in GPX2-small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected CRPC cells. For in vivo analysis, siRNA-transfected cells were subcutaneously implanted into normal and castrated nude mice. Further, immunohistochemical and prognostic analyses of GPX2 were performed using human specimens. Silencing of GPX2 caused significant growth inhibition and increased intracellular ROS in both rat (PCai1) and human (PC3) CRPC cells. Flow cytometry and western blot analyses revealed that the decrease in proliferation rate of the GPX2-silenced cells was due to cyclin B1-dependent G2/M arrest. Furthermore, knockdown of Gpx2 inhibited tumor growth of PCai1 cells in castrated mice. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that expression of GPX2 was significantly higher in residual cancer foci after neoadjuvant hormonal therapy than in hormone naive cancer foci. Moreover, patients with high GPX2 expression in biopsy specimen had significantly lower prostate-specific antigen recurrence-free survival and overall survival than those with no GPX2 expression.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the survival benefit associated with IMRT in patients with PCa.  Patients and methods:   Overall, 42 483 patients with PCa treated with IMRT or initial observation between 2001 and 2007 within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare were evaluated. Patients in both treatment arms were matched using propensity-score methodology. After propensity-score matching, 19 064 patients remained in our analyses. Eight-year cancer-specific mortality (CSM) rates were estimated, and the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. Competing risks regression analyses tested the relationship between treatment type and CSM.  Results:   Overall, the 8-year CSM rates were 3.4% and 4.1% for patients treated with IMRT versus initial observation, respectively (P < 0.001). The corresponding 8-year NNT was 142. In patients with low/intermediate-risk disease, IMRT was not associated with lower CSM rates compared with observation (P = 0.7). In patients with high-risk disease, the 8-year CSM rates for IMRT versus observation were 5.8% versus 10.5%, respectively (P < 0.001). The corresponding NNT was 21. When high-risk patients were stratified according to age (<73 versus ≥73), and Charlson comorbidity index (≤1 versus >1) the 8-year CSM rates for IMRT versus observation were 4.3% versus 9.4% and 6.9% versus 11.9% and 5.3% versus 11.4% and 6.1% versus 10.1%, respectively (all Ps < 0.001). The corresponding NNTs were 19, 21, 16, and 25, respectively. In multivariate analyses, the protective effect of IMRT was more evident in high-risk patients with younger age and lower comorbidities.

Radiation safety aspects were evaluated for a single comprehensive cancer center clinical phase 1, open-label, single ascending-dose study for three cohorts at 50, 100, or 200 kBq kg⁻¹ body weight. Ten patients received administrations, and six patients completed the study with 1 y follow-up. Dose rates from patients administered ²²³Ra dichloride were typically less than 2 μSv h⁻¹ MBq⁻¹ on contact and averaged 0.02 μSv h⁻¹ MBq⁻¹ at 1 m immediately following administration. Removal was primarily by fecal excretion, and whole body effective half-lives were highly dependent upon fecal compartment transfer, ranging from 2.5-11.4 d. Radium-223 is safe and straightforward to administer using conventional nuclear medicine equipment. For this clinical study, few radiation protection limitations were recommended post-therapy based on facility evaluations. Specific precautions are dependent on local regulatory authority guidance.

Material and methods:   Results on a total of 3145 prostate cancer patients receiving brachytherapy (BT) as part or all of their treatment were collected from 10 institutions, and subjected to linear-quadratic (LQ) modelling of dose response and fractionation parameters.  Results:   Treatments with BT components of less than 25Gy, 3-4 BT fractions, doses per BT fraction up to 6Gy, and treatment times of 3-7weeks, all gave outcomes expected from LQ projections of the external-beam-alone data (α/β=1.42Gy). However, BT doses higher than 30Gy, 1-2 fractions, 9 fractions (BT alone), doses per fraction of 9-15Gy, and treatment in only 1week (one example), gave local control levels lower than the expected levels by up to ∼35%.  Conclusions:   There are various potential causes of the lower-than-projected control levels for some schedules of brachytherapy: it seems plausible that cold spots in the brachytherapy dose distribution may be contributory, and the applicability of the LQ model at high doses per fraction remains somewhat uncertain.

Materials and methods:   Between 1989 and 2007, 1711 men with clinically localized prostate cancer and complete family history who had received RT (median RT dose=74Gy) without androgen deprivation therapy were analyzed. FH was defined as any prostate cancer in a first degree relative. For the biochemical failure (BF) outcome, this sample size has 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.56 for positive versus negative FH.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 71 months, there was no significant difference in the distribution of Gleason score (GS) or prostate specific antigen (PSA) based on FH. A positive FH was not an independent predictor of BF, distant metastasis (DM), prostate cancer specific mortality (PCSM), or overall mortality (OM) in Cox proportional multivariable analysis. On further analysis in a Cox proportional multivariable analysis, men with two or more first degree relatives with prostate cancer had a significantly higher likelihood of BF and DM than those with no FH, although there was no difference in PCSM or OM. Men with a positive FH (23%) were more likely to be younger, have a lower PSA, and non-palpable disease. There was no interaction between a positive FH and neither race nor treatment era (pre-PSA vs. PSA era).  Conclusions:   A positive FH is not a prognostic factor following RT and should not alter standard treatment recommendations. Patients with two or more first degree relatives with prostate cancer had a higher likelihood of BF and DM, but there was no effect on survival. There was no interaction between a positive FH and African American race or treatment era.

The aims of this study were to quantify prostate bed movement and determine what amount of bladder or rectum size variation creates the potential for geographic miss.  Methods and materials:   The Cone Beam CT (CBCT) images (n=377) of forty patients who received post-prostatectomy IMRT with daily on-line alignment to bony anatomy were reviewed. Prostate bed movement was estimated using the location of surgical clips in the upper and lower sections of the PTV and correlated with rectal and bladder filling (defined as changes in the cross sectional diameter at defined levels). The number of potential geographic misses caused by bladder and rectum variation was calculated assuming a uniform CTV to PTV expansion of 1cm except 0.5 cm posteriorly.  Results:   Variations in bladder filling of >2 cm larger, ±1 cm, or >2 cm smaller occurred in 3.4%, 56.2%, and 15.1% of images respectively with potential geographic misses in the upper prostate bed of 61.5%, 9.9% and 26.3% respectively. Variations in rectal filling in the upper prostate bed of >1.5 cm larger, 1.5 cm larger to 1cm smaller, and >1cm smaller occurred in 17.2%, 75.6%, and 7.2% of images respectively. These variations resulted in geographic misses in the upper prostate bed in 29.2%, 12.3%, and 63.0% of images respectively. Variations in bladder and rectal filling in the lower prostate bed region had minimal impact on geographic misses.  Conclusions:   Bladder and rectal size changes at treatment affect prostate bed coverage, especially in the upper aspect of the prostate bed. The greatest potential for geographic miss occurred when either the bladder increased in size or when the rectum became smaller. Ensuring a full bladder and empty rectum at simulation will minimise this risk.

One of the actively investigated approaches to DCE MRI analysis involves pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling to extract quantitative parameters that may be related to microvascular properties of the tissue. It is well-known that the prescribed arterial blood plasma concentration (or Arterial Input Function, AIF) input can have significant effects on the parameters estimated by PK modeling. The purpose of our study was to investigate such effects in DCE MRI data acquired in a typical clinical PCa setting. First, we investigated how the choice of a semi-automated or fully automated image-based individualized AIF (iAIF) estimation method affects the PK parameter values; and second, we examined the use of method-specific averaged AIF (cohort-based, or cAIF) as a means to attenuate the differences between the two AIF estimation methods. Two methods for automated image-based estimation of individualized (patient-specific) AIFs, one of which was previously validated for brain and the other for breast MRI, were compared. cAIFs were constructed by averaging the iAIF curves over the individual patients for each of the two methods. Pharmacokinetic analysis using the Generalized kinetic model and each of the four AIF choices (iAIF and cAIF for each of the two image-based AIF estimation approaches) was applied to derive the volume transfer rate (K(trans)) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction (ve) in the areas of prostate tumor. Differences between the parameters obtained using iAIF and cAIF for a given method (intra-method comparison) as well as inter-method differences were quantified. The study utilized DCE MRI data collected in 17 patients with histologically confirmed PCa. Comparison at the level of the tumor region of interest (ROI) showed that the two automated methods resulted in significantly different (p<0.05) mean estimates of ve, but not of K(trans). Comparing cAIF, different estimates for both ve, and K(trans) were obtained. Intra-method comparison between the iAIF- and cAIF-driven analyses showed the lack of effect on ve, while K(trans) values were significantly different for one of the methods. Our results indicate that the choice of the algorithm used for automated image-based AIF determination can lead to significant differences in the values of the estimated PK parameters. K(trans) estimates are more sensitive to the choice between cAIF/iAIF as compared to ve, leading to potentially significant differences depending on the AIF method. These observations may have practical consequences in evaluating the PK analysis results obtained in a multi-site setting.""","""['Andriy Fedorov', 'Jacob Fluckiger', 'Gregory D Ayers', 'Xia Li', 'Sandeep N Gupta', 'Clare Tempany', 'Robert Mulkern', 'Thomas E Yankeelov', 'Fiona M Fennessy']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis of prostate cancer DCE-MRI at 3T: comparison of two arterial input functions on cancer detection with digitized whole mount histopathological validation.', 'Patient-specific pharmacokinetic parameter estimation on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of prostate: Preliminary evaluation of a novel AIF-free estimation method.', 'Assessment of repeatability and treatment response in early phase clinical trials using DCE-MRI: comparison of parametric analysis using MR- and CT-derived arterial input functions.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and pharmacokinetic models in prostate cancer.', 'DCE-MRI in hepatocellular carcinoma-clinical and therapeutic image biomarker.', 'Development and validation of a point-based scoring system for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis and disease outcome in breast cancer using clinicopathological and multiparametric MRI features.', 'Technical Advancements in Abdominal Diffusion-weighted Imaging.', 'Quantitative parameters of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to predict lymphovascular invasion and survival outcome in breast cancer.', 'Eye-specific quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI analysis for patients with intraocular masses.', 'Use of Indicator Dilution Principle to Evaluate Accuracy of Arterial Input Function Measured With Low-Dose Ultrafast Prostate Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI.']"""

Here, we compare the radiation doses in different prostate sectors between the preimplant planning images and the postimplant dosimetry.  Methods and materials:   Two hundred fifteen consecutive patients treated for prostate cancer by (125)I seed brachytherapy were assessed. Pretreatment plans using transrectal ultrasound images of the prostate were compared with the dose calculated on posttreatment MRI and CT scans obtained 1 month after seed implantation. Twelve sectors were generated by dividing the prostate base, midgland, and apex into four quadrants each. Pretreatment and posttreatment dosimetry were compared between the 12 different sectors of the prostate.  Results:   Average V100 (percentage of prostate volume that receives 100% of the prescribed dose) in the preimplant planning images of the prostate was 99.9 ± 0.25% compared with postimplant V100 of 94.8 ± 3.77% (p < 0.0001). Prostate V100 in the postimplant dosimetry was >91% in all sectors, except the anterior base sector, in which it was 64.87 ± 20.96%. Average 1-month D90 (the dose to 90% of the prostate volume) was 114.5 ± 10.55%. D90 at 1 month compared with preimplant planning was lower in the prostate base and higher in the prostate apex (p < 0.001).

Furthermore, PAGE4 is developmentally regulated with dynamic expression patterns in the developing prostate and is also a stress-response protein that is upregulated in response to cellular stress. PAGE4 interacts with c-Jun, which is activated by the stress-response kinase JNK1, and plays an important role in the development and pathology of the prostate gland. Here, we have identified homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1), also a component of the stress-response pathway, as a kinase that phosphorylates PAGE4 at T51. We show that phosphorylation of PAGE4 is critical for its transcriptional activity since mutating this T residue abolishes its ability to potentiate c-Jun transactivation. In vitro single molecule FRET indicates phosphorylation results in compaction of (still) intrinsically disordered PAGE4. Interestingly, however, while our previous observations indicated that the wild-type nonphosphorylated PAGE4 protein interacted with c-Jun [Rajagopalan , K. et al. ( 2014 ) Biochim, Biophys. Acta 1842 , 154 -163], here we show that phosphorylation of PAGE4 weakens its interaction with c-Jun in vitro. These data suggest that phosphorylation induces conformational changes in natively disordered PAGE4 resulting in its decreased affinity for c-Jun to promote interaction of c-Jun with another, unidentified, partner. Alternatively, phosphorylated PAGE4 may induce transcription of a novel partner, which then potentiates c-Jun transactivation. Regardless, the present results clearly implicate PAGE4 as a component of the stress-response pathway and uncover a novel link between components of this pathway and prostatic development and disease.""","""['Steven M Mooney', 'Ruoyi Qiu', 'John J Kim', 'Elizabeth J Sacho', 'Krithika Rajagopalan', 'Dorhyun Johng', 'Takumi Shiraishi', 'Prakash Kulkarni', 'Keith R Weninger']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochemistry""","""['The Stress-response protein prostate-associated gene 4, interacts with c-Jun and potentiates its transactivation.', 'Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4), an intrinsically disordered cancer/testis antigen, is a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'Phosphorylation-induced conformational dynamics in an intrinsically disordered protein and potential role in phenotypic heterogeneity.', 'Phosphorylation-induced Conformational Ensemble Switching in an Intrinsically Disordered Cancer/Testis Antigen.', 'Cancer/Testis Antigens: ""Smart"" Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate and Other Cancers.', 'Illuminating Intrinsically Disordered Proteins with Integrative Structural Biology.', 'Single-photon smFRET.

Objective:   To identify dietary patterns in adult population in Córdoba (Argentina) and to estimate their effects on the risk of colon-rectal (CRC), urothelial (UC), breast (BC) and prostate (PC) cancers.  Methods:   Four case control studies were conducted, 2006-2012 for CRC, PC, BC and UC. To identify the dietary patterns, a Principal Components Factor Analysis was conducted. A multilevel logistic regression was adjusted for the risk analyses.  Results:   Characteristic dietary patterns in the whole population, and in women and men independently, were identified. In the whole population South Cone and Sweet Beverages patterns behaved as promoters for CRC and UC while the Prudent Pattern had a protective effect. Female South Cone, Rural and Starchy patterns were associated to a higher BC risk. Prudent Pattern lowered BC risk. In men, South Cone, Sweet Beverages and Typical Measured patterns promoted PC.  Conclusion:   It is necessary to promote a regular intake of vegetables, fruits and diary products (although a moderate intake for men), and to reduce red meat (especially fat meat), processed meat, starchy vegetables, wine and sweet beverages intakes, to prevent the occurrence of cancer. In men, it is recommended a moderate intake of egg.

To overcome this limitation we have developed and tested a system for co-registration of in-vivo MRI, ex-vivo MRI and histology.  Materials and methods:   Three men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (ages 54-72, PSA levels 5.1-7.7 ng/ml) were prospectively enrolled in this study. All patients underwent 3T multi-parametric MRI that included T2W, DCE-MRI, and DWI prior to robotic-assisted prostatectomy. Ex-vivo multi-parametric MRI was performed on fresh prostate specimen. Excised prostates were then sliced at regular intervals and photographed both before and after fixation. Slices were perpendicular to the main axis of the posterior capsule, i.e., along the direction of the rectal wall. Guided by the location of the urethra, 2D digital images were assembled into 3D models. Cancer foci, extra-capsular extensions and zonal margins were delineated by the pathologist and included in 3D histology data. A locally-developed software was applied to register in-vivo, ex-vivo and histology using an over-determined set of anatomical landmarks placed in anterior fibro-muscular stroma, central. transition and peripheral zones. The mean root square distance across corresponding control points was used to assess co-registration error.  Results:   Two specimens were pT3a and one pT2b (negative margin) at pathology. The software successfully fused in-vivo MRI. ex-vivo MRI fresh specimen and histology using appropriate (rigid and affine) transformation models with mean square error of 1.59 mm.

However, the cellular mechanism of this activity remains unclear. Therefore, in this pilot study, we assessed the functional activity of PPA tissue secretions and established a biochemical profile of PPA as compared to subcutaneous adipose (SQA) tissues from lean, overweight and obese PCa patients.  Methods:   Adipose tissues were collected from PCa patients undergoing surgical prostate removal. Tissues were analyzed by histologic and magnetic resonance (MR) techniques. Explant tissue culture secretions were used in proliferation assays on PCa and endothelial cells.  Results:   PPA secretions obtained from obese patients were significantly more pro-proliferative in both PCa and endothelial cells as compared to PPA obtained from lean or overweight men and SQA tissues. Consistent with this, PPA microvessel density was increased, and the T2 relaxation time was decreased, compared to SQA tissues, and we observed a modest, inverse correlation between the T2 and tumor stage. Moreover, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, obtained using MR spectroscopy, showed a modest, inverse correlation with Gleason score.  Conclusions:   These pilot data show that PPA stimulates PCa cell proliferation and angiogenesis and that obesity intensifies this activity, thus generating a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the worse prognosis observed in obese PCa patients.

Results:   The data collected in the years 2005-07 show that the top 5 forms of cancers in women were breast (ASR: 36.4 per 100,000), cervical (15.0), thyroid (6.7), colon-rectum (5.8), and ovarian (5.3); the top 5 cancers in men were lung (25.9), prostate (13.5), bladder (8.7), colon-rectum (8.1) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (7.2). Tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues represented 11% of all cancers (skin excluded); some presented unusual sex ratios. For breast, cervical, colorectal and thyroid cancer, respectively 57%, 42%, 28% and 60% of the cases were under 50 years of age. This was attributable to particularly low numbers of cases recorded among old people, and the young age of the general population; the observed age-specific incidences under age 50 were not higher than in western countries. Cancers at young ages were particularly common in women: 67% of the cases were under 50.

In particular, the AR plays a critical role in the biology and pathology of the prostate gland. AR activity inhibits breast growth and has pleiotropic actions in breast cancer that are subtype-dependent. Expression of AR splice variants (ARVs) and their role in prostate carcinogenesis has been elucidated in recent studies. We hypothesised that ARVs are also expressed in breast cancers and other hormone sensitive tissues. Herein, the expression of five previously identified ARV transcripts with documented transcriptional capacity (AR-V1, -V3, -V4, -V7, and -V9) was examined in 6 breast (MFM223, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-231, ZR75.1, MCF-7, T47D), two prostate (VCaP, LNCaP), and one liver (HepG2) cancer cell lines, a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293), and a panel of RNAs representing 21 different human tissues. Four ARVs (V1, V3, V7, V9) were detected to some degree in almost all cell lines and tissues. In addition, four novel ARVs containing a cryptic exon 9 (CE9) were detected in MDA-MB-453 and VCaP cells. Sequencing of ARV amplicons revealed a single nucleotide substitution within CE3 in lung and placental tissue samples that could be translated as an Ile (ATT)>Val (GTT) substitution in the AR-V7 variant protein. Collectively, these data provides insight into the potential complexity of AR transcriptional splicing events in breast cancer cell lines and diverse human tissues, thereby establishing a rationale for further exploration of ARVs in breast cancer and other human pathologies.""","""['Dong Gui Hu', 'Theresa E Hickey', 'Connie Irvine', 'Dhilushi Dodampege Wijayakumara', 'Lu Lu', 'Wayne D Tilley', 'Luke A Selth', 'Peter I Mackenzie']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants expressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer require full-length androgen receptor.', 'Expression of androgen receptor splice variants in clinical breast cancers.', 'Identification of an exon 3 deletion splice variant androgen receptor mRNA in human breast cancer.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Co-expression and clinical utility of AR-FL and AR splice variants AR-V3, AR-V7 and AR-V9 in prostate cancer.', 'Drugging the Undruggable: Targeting the N-Terminal Domain of Nuclear Hormone Receptors.', 'Antagonizing CD105 and androgen receptor to target stromal-epithelial interactions for clinical benefit.', 'Adaptation to Hypoxia May Promote Therapeutic Resistance to Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor variant-7 regulation by tenascin-c induced src activation.']"""

We recorded feasibility of first-line chemotherapy (planned number of cycles in patients without metastases and three to six cycles depending on tumor site in patients with metastases), surgery (patient alive 30 days after successfully performed planned surgical procedure), radiotherapy (planned dose delivered), and hormonal therapy (planned drug dose given), and we recorded overall 1-year survival.  Results:   Main tumor sites were colorectal (28.6%), breast (23.1%), and prostate (10.9%), and 47% of patients had metastases. Planned cancer treatment was feasible in 65.7% of patients with metastases; this proportion was 59.0% for chemotherapy, 82.6% for surgery, 100% for radiotherapy, and 85.2% for hormonal therapy. In the group without metastases, feasibility proportions were 86.8% overall, 72.4% for chemotherapy, 95.7% for surgery, 96.4% for radiotherapy, and 97.9% for hormonal therapy. Factors independently associated with chemotherapy feasibility were good functional status defined as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status <2 (p < .0001) or activities of daily living >5 (p = .01), normal mobility defined as no difficulty walking (p = .01) or no fall risk (p = .007), and higher creatinine clearance (p = .04).  Conclusion:   Feasibility rates were considerably lower for chemotherapy than for surgery, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Therefore, utilization of limited geriatric oncology resources may be optimized by preferential referral of elderly cancer patients initially considered for chemotherapy to geriatric oncology clinics.""","""['Marie Laurent', 'Elena Paillaud', 'Christophe Tournigand', 'Philippe Caillet', 'Aurélie Le Thuaut', 'Jean-Léon Lagrange', 'Olivier Beauchet', 'Hélène Vincent', 'Muriel Carvahlo-Verlinde', 'Stéphane Culine', 'Sylvie Bastuji-Garin', 'Florence Canouï-Poitrine;ELCAPA Study Group']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Geriatric assessment is associated with completion of chemotherapy, toxicity, and survival in older adults with cancer.', 'Geriatric assessment findings independently associated with clinical depression in 1092 older patients with cancer: the ELCAPA Cohort Study.', 'Preliminary report on prospective, multicenter, open research of selective surgery after expandable stent combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of obstructive left hemicolon cancer.', 'Do age and comorbidity impact treatment allocation and outcomes in limited stage small-cell lung cancer? a community-based population analysis.', 'Efaproxiral: GSJ 61, JP 4, KDD 86, RS 4, RSR 13.', ""'ADVANCE' (a pilot trial) ADjuVANt chemotherapy in the elderly: Developing and evaluating lower-toxicity chemotherapy options for older patients with breast cancer."", 'The Impact of Cognitive Impairment on Treatment Toxicity, Treatment Completion, and Survival among Older Adults Receiving Chemotherapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Prevalence and prognostic impact of cachexia among older patients with cancer: a nationwide cross-sectional survey (NutriAgeCancer).', 'Patient assessment and feasibility of treatment in older patients with cancer: results from the IN-GHO® Registry.', 'Medication Reconciliation Associated with Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in Older Patients with Cancer: ChimioAge Study.']"""

As a consequence, significant effort is being invested in the development of AKR1C3-selective inhibitors.  Methods:   We report the screening of an in-house drug library to identify known drugs that selectively inhibit AKR1C3 over the closely related isoforms AKR1C1, 1C2 and 1C4. This screen initially identified tetracycline as a potential AKR1C3-selective inhibitor. However, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance studies identified that the active agent was a novel breakdown product (4-methyl(de-dimethylamine)-tetracycline (4-MDDT)).  Results:   We demonstrate that, although 4-MDDT enters AML cells and inhibits their AKR1C3 activity, it does not recapitulate the anti-leukaemic actions of the pan-AKR1C inhibitor medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Screens of the NCI diversity set and an independently curated small-molecule library identified several additional AKR1C3-selective inhibitors, none of which had the expected anti-leukaemic activity. However, a pan AKR1C, also identified in the NCI diversity set faithfully recapitulated the actions of MPA.  Conclusions:   In summary, we have identified a novel tetracycline-derived product that provides an excellent lead structure with proven drug-like qualities for the development of AKR1C3 inhibitors.

However, epidemiologic studies have been conflicting.  Objective:   To evaluate the association between MetS and the odds of PCa diagnosis in men referred for biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients without prior PCa diagnosis undergoing prostate biopsy were identified from a large prostate biopsy cohort (in Toronto, Canada). The definition of MetS was based on the most recent interim joint consensus definition, requiring any three of five components (obesity, elevated blood pressure, diabetes or impaired fasting glucose, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and hypertriglyceridemia). Both the individual components of MetS and the cumulative number of MetS components were evaluated.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcomes were PCa detection overall, clinically significant PCa (CSPC; defined as any Gleason pattern ≥ 4, >50% involvement of a single biopsy core, or more than one of three total number of cores involved), and intermediate- or high-grade PCa (I-HGPC; Gleason 7-10). Tests for trend and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.  Results and limitations:   Of 2235 patients, 494 (22.1%) had MetS. No individual MetS component was independently associated with PCa. However, increasing number of MetS components was associated with higher PCa grade (p<0.001), as well as progressively higher odds of PCa outcomes (three or more; ie, MetS) compared with no MetS components: Odds ratios were 1.54 for PCa overall (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.04; p=0.002), 1.56 for CSPC (95% CI, 1.17-2.08; p=0.002), and 1.56 for I-HGPC (95% CI, 1.16-2.10; p=0.003) in multivariable analyses. The main limitation is the retrospective design.  Conclusions:   Although the individual MetS components are not independently associated with PCa outcomes, MetS is significantly associated with higher odds of PCa diagnosis, CSPC, and I-HGPC. There is a biologic gradient between the number of MetS components and the risk of PCa, as well as cancer grade.

Objective:   Determine whether alcohol affects PCa risk among men taking the 5-ARI dutasteride.  Design, settings, and participants:   Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events was a 4-yr, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare PCa after dutasteride administration (0.5mg/d) with placebo. Participants had a baseline prostate-specific antigen between 2.5 and 10.0 ng/ml and a recent negative prostate biopsy. Alcohol intake was determined by baseline questionnaire, and participants underwent a prostate biopsy to determine PCa status at 2 yr and 4 yr of follow-up.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between alcohol intake and low-grade (Gleason <7) and high-grade (Gleason >7) PCa.  Results and limitations:   Of 6374 participants in our analysis, approximately 25% reported no alcohol consumption, 49% were moderate drinkers (one to seven drinks per week), and 26% were heavy drinkers (more than seven drinks per week). Alcohol intake was not associated with low- or high-grade PCa in the placebo arm and was not associated with low-grade PCa among men taking dutasteride. In contrast, men randomized to dutasteride and reporting more than seven drinks per week were 86% more likely to be diagnosed with high-grade PCa (p=0.01). Among alcohol abstainers, dutasteride was associated with significantly reduced risk of high-grade PCa (OR: 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.90), but dutasteride was no longer associated with reduced high-grade PCa among men reporting high alcohol intake (OR: 0.99; 95% CI, 0.67-1.45).  Conclusions:   Alcohol consumption negated a protective association between dutasteride and high-grade PCa.

However, the anti-cancer properties of this species of the Teucrium genus have not been investigated previously. In this study, we have used a highly invasive prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, which is an appropriate cell system to study anti-tumor properties of plants. A methanolic extract obtained from T persicum potently inhibited viability of PC-3 cells. The viability of SW480 colon and T47D breast cancer cells was also significantly decreased in the presence of the T persicum extract. Flow cytometry suggested that the reduction of cell viability was due to induction of apoptosis. In addition, the results of wound healing and gelatin zymography experiments supported anti-cell invasion activity of T persicum. Interestingly, sublethal concentrations of T persicum extract induced an epithelial-like morphology in a subpopulation of cells with an increase in E-Cadherin and β-Catenin protein levels at the cell membrane.

For enhancing anticancer efficiency with minimum side effects, combination therapy is envisioned. The current manuscript reports for the first time the development of a methylene blue (MB) bound nanoplatform, which is capable of delivering targeted diagnostic and combined synergistic photothermal and photodynamic treatment of cancer. Experimental data found that, once the nanoparticle binds with the target cell surface, it can detect LNCaP human prostate cancer cell selectively using fluorescence imaging. Our result shows that the therapeutic actions can be controlled with external NIR light. No cytotoxicity was observed in the absence of NIR light.

Methods:   A cost-effectiveness model was developed from the perspective of the UK National Health Service evaluating monthly injection of degarelix against 3-monthly leuprorelin therapy plus anti-androgen flare cover for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced (locally advanced or metastatic) hormone-dependent prostate cancer. A Markov process model was constructed using the patient population characteristics and efficacy information from the CS21 Phase III clinical trial and associated extension study (CS21A). The intention-to-treat (ITT) population and a high-risk sub-group with a PSA level >20 ng/mL were modeled.  Results:   In the base-case analysis using the patient access scheme (PAS) price, degarelix was dominant compared to leuprorelin with cost savings of £3633 in the ITT population and £4310 in the PSA > 20 ng/mL sub-group. The chance of being cost-effective was 95% in the ITT population and 96% in the PSA > 20 ng/mL sub-group at a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In addition, degarelix remained dominant when PSA progression was assumed equal and only the benefits of preventing testosterone flare were taken into account. Treatment with degarelix also remained dominant in both populations when the list price was used. The additional investment required to treat patients with degarelix could be offset in 19 months for the ITT population and 13 months for the PSA > 20 ng/mL population. The model was most sensitive to the hazard ratio assumed for PSA progression between degarelix and leuprorelin and the quality-of-life (utility) of patients receiving palliative care.  Conclusion:   Degarelix is likely to be cost-effective compared to leuprorelin plus anti-androgen flare cover in the first-line treatment of advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.""","""['Dawn Lee', 'Joshua Porter', 'Daniel Gladwell', 'Nic Brereton', 'Sandy K Nielsen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Med Econ""","""['Cost-effectiveness analysis comparing degarelix with leuprolide in hormonal therapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of degarelix for advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.', 'The efficacy and safety of degarelix: a 12-month, comparative, randomized, open-label, parallel-group phase III study in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Degarelix for Treating Advanced Hormone-Dependent Prostate Cancer: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone: an update review of the antagonists versus agonists.', 'Degarelix vs. leuprorelin for the treatment of prostate cancer in China: A cost-utility analysis.', 'Relugolix: a novel androgen deprivation therapy for management of patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness of docetaxel in high-volume hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Treatments for Metastatic Prostate Cancer (mPC): A Review of Costing Evidence.', 'Degarelix versus luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists for the treatment of prostate cancer.']"""

Here, the effect of TRAP1 ablation on cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, and mitochondrial function was determined in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, the prognostic value of TRAP1 was evaluated in patients with NSCLC. These results demonstrate that TRAP1 knockdown reduces cell growth and clonogenic cell survival. Moreover, TRAP1 downregulation impairs mitochondrial functions such as ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine methylester) uptake, but it does not affect mitochondrial density or mitochondrial morphology. The effect of TRAP1 silencing on apoptosis, analyzed by flow cytometry and immunoblot expression (cleaved PARP, caspase-9, and caspase-3) was cell line and context dependent. Finally, the prognostic potential of TRAP1 expression in NSCLC was ascertained via immunohistochemical analysis which revealed that high TRAP1 expression was associated with increased risk of disease recurrence (univariate analysis, P = 0.008; multivariate analysis, HR: 2.554; 95% confidence interval, 1.085-6.012; P = 0.03).

The assumption is that any bias introduced into the estimation of expected survival, and hence, into the estimate of relative survival, will be negligible. However, empirical studies of potential bias have yet to be published.  Data and methods:   Data are from the Canadian Cancer Registry with mortality follow-up through record linkage to the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database. Period method relative survival ratios (RSRs) for 2005-2007 were derived using life tables centred on the 2006 Census of Population to estimate expected survival. The analysis was repeated using life tables from 5 and 10 years earlier.  Results:   Deriving expected survival from life tables 5 years out of date resulted in increases in RSRs for all cancers. These increases became greater with lengthening survival duration. For example, increases in 1-, 5- and 10-year RSRs were 0.2, 0.8 and 1.7 percentage units, respectively, for all cancers combined. Increases in 5-year survival were highest for prostate (2.0) and bladder cancer (1.6); among males (1.2); and among people aged 75 to 99 at diagnosis (1.9). Differences were approximately double when life tables 10 years out of date were used.

Residual energy-adjusted total flavonoids (for fifth quintile vs. first quintile, relative risk = 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.23; P for trend = 0.02) and several subclasses were positively associated with overall prostate cancer risk, mostly limited to the top quintile and the first 2 years of follow-up. The associations for total flavonoids, flavan-3-ols, and proanthocyanidins with high-grade prostate cancer risk varied by follow-up time. During follow-up from 2002 to 2009, we observed suggestive inverse trends with higher total flavonoids (P for trend = 0.05) and proanthocyanidins (P for trend = 0.04) with high-grade prostate cancer, but not with advanced prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   We have retrospectively evaluated (18)F-CH PET/CT scans of 325 consecutive PC patients enrolled in the period November 2009 to December 2012 previously treated with radical intent and referred to our centre to perform (18)F-CH PET/CT for biochemical relapse. Two different groups of patients were evaluated. group A included the whole sample of 325 patients (mean age 70 years, range: 49-86) who presented trigger PSA between 0.1 and 80 ng/ml (mean 5.5 ng/ml), and group B included 187 patients (mean age 70 years, range 49-86) with medium-low levels of trigger PSA ranging between 0.5 and 5 ng/ml (mean PSA 2.1 ng/ml); group B was chosen in order to obtain a more homogeneous group of patients in terms of PSA values also excluding both very low and very high PSA levels avoiding the ""a priori"" higher probability of negative or positive PET scan, respectively. At the time of examination, 139 patients from group A and 72 patients from group B were under ADT: these patients were considered to be hormone-resistant PC patients because from their oncologic history (>18 months) an increase of PSA levels emerged despite the ongoing ADT. The relationship between (18)F-CH PET/CT findings and possible clinical predictors was investigated using both univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses, including trigger PSA and ADT.  Results:   Considering the whole population, overall DR of (18)F-CH PET was 58.2 % (189/325 patients). In the whole sample of patients (group A), both at the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, trigger PSA and ADT were significantly correlated with the DR of (18)F-CH PET (p < 0.05). Moreover, the DR in patients under ADT (mean PSA 7.8 ng/ml) was higher than in patients not under ADT (mean PSA 3.9 ng/ml), (DR was 70.5 % and 48.9 %, respectively; p < 0.001), therefore, demonstrating the existence of a significant correlation between the DR of (18)F-CH PET and ADT. In group B patients only trigger PSA resulted a reliable predictor of the (18)F-CH positivity, since ADT was not correlated to the DR of (18)F-CH PET (p = 0.061). Also in group B the DR of (18)F-CH PET in patients under ADT was higher than in patients not under ADT (65.3 % and 51.3 %, respectively) but the difference was not significant without a statistically significant correlation in the Mann Whitney test (p = 0.456) therefore, suggesting the lack of correlation between DR (18)F-CH PET/CT and ADT.  Conclusion:   Similarly to previous published studies, in our series the overall DR of (18)F-CH PET/CT was 58 % and was significantly correlated to trigger PSA. The most important finding of the present study is that ADT does not negatively influence DR of (18)F-CH PET/CT in PC patients with biochemical relapse; therefore, it can be suggested that it is not necessary to withdraw ADT before performing (18)F-CH PET/CT.""","""['Sotirios Chondrogiannis', 'Maria Cristina Marzola', 'Alice Ferretti', 'Gaia Grassetto', 'Anna Margherita Maffione', 'Lucia Rampin', 'Stefano Fanti', 'Francesco Giammarile', 'Domenico Rubello']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Role of ¹⁸F-choline PET/CT in suspicion of relapse following definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of 18F-choline PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence: influence of androgen deprivation therapy and correlation with PSA kinetics.', 'Early biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy: which prostate cancer patients may benefit from a restaging 11C-Choline PET/CT scan before salvage radiation therapy?', 'Imaging of prostate cancer with PET/CT and radioactively labeled choline derivates.', 'New acquisition protocol of 18F-choline PET/CT in prostate cancer patients: review of the literature about methodology and proposal of standardization.', 'Molecular Imaging Assessment of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'A Retrospective Comparative Study of Sodium Fluoride (NaF-18)-PET/CT and Fluorocholine (F-18-CH) PET/CT in the Evaluation of Skeletal Metastases in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Using a Volumetric 3-D Radiomics Analysis.', 'Diagnostic Performance of 18FFluorocholine and 68GaGa-PSMA PET/CT in Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Study.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on 68Ga-PSMA tracer uptake in non-metastatic prostate cancer patients.', 'Prostate cancer imaging: when the game gets tough, the hard one gets done!']"""

Although certification is not required by law, a comprehensive and close to home medical care in certified centres is required for all patients with cancer. We analysed whether Germany already provides a spatially inclusive and comprehensive supply with certified centres for the most common cancers for women and men.  Methods:   Based on the central place concept ""coverage"" is defined as accessibility within 30 min by car for over 90% of the population. Using a software-supported route searching procedure we calculated 30- and 60-minutes-driving time zones around all breast and prostate cancre centers. We aggregated the population shares of all 5 digit postcode areas within the defined driving time zone and compared these areas to those outside the radius. The results are depicted as cartographic information.  Results:   Nationwide 84% of the female populations over 18 years can reach the next breast centre within 30 min by car. In particular in the states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg several areas do not provide sufficient access to breast centres. Using a travel time threshold of 60 min leads to an accessibility rate of 99%. 56% of the male population have access to a prostate cancer centre within half an hour by car. Again, the biggest coverage problems exist especially in eastern Germany. Within a radius of 60 min, the accessibility of prostate cancer centres increases to 94%.  Conclusions:   In Germany, some regions do not provide a spatially inclusive and comprehensive supply with organ cancer centers. However, it must be remembered that comprehensive access to care cannot be pursued as the only goal of health policy. Instead, the trade-off between justice, health and patients' interests and economic performance and adequate funding must be considered.""","""['D Lewers', 'M Geraedts']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Gesundheitswesen""","""['Psycho-oncological care in certified cancer centres--a nationwide analysis in Germany.', 'A Quantitative Analysis of the Relationship Between Radiation Therapy Use and Travel Time.', 'Geographical access to radiation therapy in North Queensland: a retrospective analysis of patient travel to radiation therapy before and after the opening of an additional radiotherapy facility.', 'Multidisciplinary breast centres in Germany: a review and update of quality assurance through benchmarking and certification.', 'Travel times of patients to ambulatory care physicians in Germany.', 'Increase in uro-oncological health care needs due to demographic change: Extrapolation of cancer incidence numbers through 2030 as a basis for directed regional planning.']"""

Methods:   We mailed a self-administered survey instrument to a random sample of 1366 specialists in the U.S. Respondents were asked for treatment recommendations and survival that varied by PSA levels and Gleason scores and estimate QOL outcomes. Pearson's chi-square and multivariable regression models were used to test for differences in each outcome.  Results:   Response rates were similar for radiation oncologists (52.6%) and urologists (52.3%; P=0.92). Across all risk strata, urologists were more likely to recommend surgery than were radiation oncologists, for conditions ranging from PSA>20 and Gleason score 8-10 (35.2 vs. 0.2%; P<0.001) to PSA 4-10 and Gleason score 7 (87.5 vs. 20.9%; P<0.001).

From low- to high-risk prostate cancer, radiation oncologists and urologists perceived their treatment as being better for improving survival (all P<0.001). Each specialty also viewed their treatment as having less urinary incontinence (all P<0.001).  Conclusions:   Radiation oncologists and urologists both prefer the treatment modalities they offer, perceive them to be more effective and to lead to a better QOL.

The predictive role of these markers relative to bone-targeted therapy is unknown. We prospectively evaluated the prognostic and predictive value of bone biomarkers in sera from CRPC patients treated on a placebo-controlled phase III trial of docetaxel with or without the bone targeted endothelin-A receptor antagonist atrasentan (SWOG S0421).  Methods:   Markers for bone resorption (N-telopeptide and pyridinoline) and formation (C-terminal collagen propeptide and bone alkaline phosphatase) were assayed in pretreatment and serial sera. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fit for overall survival. Models were fit with main effects for marker levels and with/without terms for marker-treatment interaction, adjusted for clinical variables, to assess the prognostic and predictive value of atrasentan. Analysis was adjusted for multiple comparisons. Two-sided P values were calculated using the Wald test.  Results:   Sera from 778 patients were analyzed. Elevated baseline levels of each of the markers were associated with worse survival (P < .001). Increasing marker levels by week nine of therapy were also associated with subsequent poor survival (P < .001). Patients with the highest marker levels (upper 25th percentile for all markers) not only had a poor prognosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.41 to 7.65; P < .001) but also had a survival benefit from atrasentan (HR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.15 to 0.71; median survival = 13 [atrasentan] vs 5 months [placebo]; P interaction = .005).  Conclusions:   Serum bone metabolism markers have statistically significant independent prognostic value in CRPC.

Aims:   The aim of this study was to assess usefulness of using the p63 and p504s to solve this problem. Although the use of p63 and p504s is now well established in differentiation between preneoplastic and neoplastic prostatic lesions, their usefulness in tiny tissue material is, however, not fully studied.  Methods:   The study included a spectrum of 30 prostatic needle biopsies (5 BCH, 10 HGPIN, 10 indefinite luminal proliferations where BCH and HGPIN could not be distinguished from each other and 5 adenocarcinomas). H&E stained sections were examined for histopathological features. Other sections were stained immunohistochemically with p63 and p504s.  Results:   The mean age of patients was 69 (SD=7.6) years. PSA range was 1.3-2.7 ng/ml. Ultrasongraphic findings were unremarkable. All BCH showed p504s-/p63+ pattern, All HGPIN had p504s+/p63+ pattern while carcinomas were p504s+/p63-. After immunostaining combined with histopathological features; the 10 indefinite specimens could be diagnosed as 4 BCH and 6 HGPIN.

Residual tissue androgens are consistently detected within CRPC tumors and play a critical role in facilitating AR-mediated signaling pathways which lead to disease progression. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are the major androgens detected in tumors. They are produced through three biosynthesis pathways: Δ(4), Δ(5), and backdoor pathways. Both androgens bind to and stimulate AR activation. The current study investigates the effects of pomegranate extracts (POM) and their ability to inhibit androgen biosynthesis using PCa cell lines (22RV1 and LNCaP) in vitro as well as the PTEN knockout mouse model representing prostate cancer. Steroids were extracted using ethyl acetate or solid phase extraction, and then analyzed by UPLC/MS/MS. The results showed that POM (0-12μg/mL) reduced the production of testosterone, DHT, DHEA, androstenedione, androsterone, and pregnenolone in both cell lines. In addition our in vivo data supports this observation with a reduction in serum steroids determined after 20 weeks of POM treatment (0.17 g/L in drinking water). In accordance with these results, Western blotting of cell lysates and tPSA analysis determined that PSA was significantly decreased by the treatment of POM. Interestingly, AKR1C3 and AR levels were shown to be increased in both cell lines, perhaps as a negative feedback effect in response to steroid inhibition. Overall, these results provide mechanistic evidence to support the rationale for recent clinical reports describing efficacy of POM in CRPC patients.""","""['Dong-Sheng Ming', 'Steven Pham', 'Subrata Deb', 'Mei Yieng Chin', 'Geetanjali Kharmate', 'Hans Adomat', 'Elham Hosseini Beheshti', 'Jennifer Locke', 'Emma Tomlinson Guns']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Intracrine androgen biosynthesis in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Identification of an anabolic selective androgen receptor modulator that actively induces death of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Profiling adrenal 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolites in prostate cancer cells, tissue and plasma: UPC2-MS/MS quantification of 11β-hydroxytestosterone, 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-dihydrotestosterone.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen biosynthesis in castration-resistant prostate cancer: Advances in studies.', 'Pomegranate-specific natural compounds as onco-preventive and onco-therapeutic compounds: Comparison with conventional drugs acting on the same molecular mechanisms.', 'A standardized pomegranate fruit extract ameliorates thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis in rats via AGE-RAGE-ROS signaling.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Research Models of Prostate Cancer: A Brief Overview.', 'Extraction of Polyphenols and Valorization of Fibers from Istrian-Grown Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.).', 'Slow-, Tight-Binding Inhibition of CYP17A1 by Abiraterone Redefines Its Kinetic Selectivity and Dosing Regimen.']"""

Much effort is focused on optimizing this androgen deprivation strategy by improving hormone depletion and AR antagonism. However we found that bicalutamide, a clinically used antiandrogen, actually resembles a selective AR modulator (SARM), as it partially regulates 24% of endogenously 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-responsive genes in AR(+) MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells. These data suggested that passive blocking of all AR functions is not required for PCa therapy. Hence, we adopted an active strategy that calls for the development of novel SARMs, which induce a unique gene expression profile that is intolerable to PCa cells. Therefore, we screened 3000 SARMs for the ability to arrest the androgen-independent growth of AR(+) 22Rv1 and LNCaP PCa cells but not AR(-) PC3 or DU145 cells. We identified only one such compound; the 4-aza-steroid, MK-4541, a potent and selective SARM. MK-4541 induces caspase-3 activity and cell death in both androgen-independent, AR(+) PCa cell lines but spares AR(-) cells or AR(+) non-PCa cells. This activity correlates with its promoter context- and cell-type dependent transcriptional effects. In rats, MK-4541 inhibits the trophic effects of DHT on the prostate, but not the levator ani muscle, and triggers an anabolic response in the periosteal compartment of bone. Therefore, MK-4541 has the potential to effectively manage prostatic hypertrophic diseases owing to its antitumor SARM-like mechanism, while simultaneously maintaining the anabolic benefits of natural androgens.""","""['Azriel Schmidt', 'Robert S Meissner', 'Michael A Gentile', 'Michael J Chisamore', 'Evan E Opas', 'Angela Scafonas', 'Tara E Cusick', 'Carlo Gambone', 'Brenda Pennypacker', 'Paul Hodor', 'James J Perkins', 'Chang Bai', 'Damien Ferraro', 'David J Bettoun', 'Hilary A Wilkinson', 'Stephen E Alves', 'Osvaldo Flores', 'William J Ray']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['A novel selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) MK-4541 exerts anti-androgenic activity in the prostate cancer xenograft R-3327G and anabolic activity on skeletal muscle mass & function in castrated mice.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Co-targeting AR and HSP90 suppresses prostate cancer cell growth and prevents resistance mechanisms.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor antagonists for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Transcription Factors in Cancer Development and Therapy.', 'Selective androgen receptor modulators: the future of androgen therapy?', 'Discovery of Novel Androgen Receptor Ligands by Structure-based Virtual Screening and Bioassays.', 'Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators: Current Knowledge and Clinical Applications.', 'Combination of curcumin and bicalutamide enhanced the growth inhibition of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells through SAPK/JNK and MEK/ERK1/2-mediated targeting NF-κB/p65 and MUC1-C.']"""

Here, we examined the role of two epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators, the adherens junction protein E-cadherin and its transcriptional repressor SNAI1, in regulating the aggressiveness of PCA cells.  Methods:   The growth rate of human prostate carcinoma PC3 cells with stable knock-down of E-cadherin (ShEC-PC3) and respective control cells (Sh-PC3) was compared in MTT and clonogenic assays in cell culture and in nude mouse xenograft model in vivo. Stemness of ShEC-PC3 and Sh-PC3 cells was analyzed in prostasphere assay. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to study protein expression changes following E-cadherin and SNAI1 knock-down. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique was employed to knock- down SNAI1 protein expression in ShEC-PC3 cells.  Results:   ShEC-PC3 cells exerted higher proliferation rate both in cell culture and in athymic nude mice compared to Sh-PC3 cells. ShEC-PC3 cells also formed larger and a significantly higher number of prostaspheres suggesting an increase in the stem cell-like population with E-cadherin knock-down. Also, ShEC-PC3 prostaspheres disintegration, in the presence of serum and attachment, generated a bigger mass of proliferating cells as compared to Sh-PC3 prostaspheres. Immunoblotting/IHC analyses showed that E-cadherin knock-down increases the expression of regulators/biomarkers for stemness (CD44, cleaved Notch1 and Egr-1) and EMT (Vimentin, pSrc-tyr416, Integrin β3, β-catenin, and NF-κB) in cell culture and xenograft tissues. The expression of several bone metastasis related molecules namely CXCR4, uPA, RANKL and RunX2 was also increased in ShEC-PC3 cells. Importantly, we observed a remarkable increase in SNAI1 expression in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, prostaspheres and xenograft tissues of ShEC-PC3 cells. Furthermore, SNAI1 knock-down by specific siRNA strongly inhibited the prostasphere formation, clonogenicity and invasiveness, and decreased the level of pSrc-tyr416, total Src and CD44 in ShEC-PC3 cells. Characterization of RWPE-1, WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14 and DU-145 cells further confirmed that low E-cadherin is associated with higher SNAI1 expression and prostasphere formation.

Many studies utilize methods to detect differential regulation of miRNA expression. It is prohibitively expensive to examine all potentially dysregulated miRNAs and traditionally, researchers have focused their efforts on the most extremely dysregulated miRNAs. These methods may overlook the contribution of less differentially expressed but more functionally relevant miRNAs. The purpose of this study was to outline a method that not only utilizes differential expression but ranks miRNAs based on the functional relevance of their targets. This work uses a networks based approach to determine the sum node degree for all experimentally verified miRNA targets to identify potential regulators of prostate cancer initiation, progression and metastasis.  Results:   Here, we present a method for identifying functionally relevant miRNAs that contribute to prostate cancer development. This paper shows that miRNAs preferentially regulate highly connected, central proteins within a protein-protein interaction network. Known targets of miRNAs differentially regulated during prostate cancer progression are enriched in pathways with known involvement in tumorigenesis. To demonstrate the applicability of our method, we utilized a unique model of prostate cancer progression to identify five miRNAs that may contribute to the oncogenic state of the cell. Three of these miRNAs have been shown by other studies to have a role in cancer but their exact role in prostate cancer remains undefined.  Conclusion:   Developing methods to determine which miRNAs to carry forward into biological and biochemical analyses is important as traditional approaches often overlook miRNAs that contribute to oncogenesis.

However, the majority of the associated PCa SNPs, including those in linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks, are generally not located in protein coding regions. The systematical investigation of the functional roles of these SNPs, especially the non-coding SNPs, becomes very necessary and helpful to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of PCa.  Results:   In this work, we proposed a comprehensive framework at network level to integrate the SNP annotation, target gene assignment, gene ontology (GO) classification, pathway enrichment analysis and regulatory network reconstruction to illustrate the molecular functions of PCa associated SNPs. By LD expansion, we first identified 1828 LD SNPs using 49 reported GWAS SNPs as a start. We carefully annotated these 1828 LD SNPs via either UCSC known genes, UCSC regulation elements, or expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) data. As a result, we found 1154 SNPs were functionally annotated and obtained 205 unique PCa genes for further enrichment analysis. The enriched GO biological processes and pathways were found mainly related to regulation of cell death, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and metabolic process, which have been proved essential to cancer development. We constructed PCa genes specific transcription regulatory networks, finding several important genetic regulators for PCa, such as IGF-1/IGF-2 receptors, SP1, CREB1, and androgen receptor (AR).  Conclusions:   A comprehensive framework was proposed for integrative and systematic analysis of PCa SNPs, the analysis can provide essential information for the understanding of the regulatory function of GWAS SNPs in PCa, and will facilitate the discovery of novel candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of PCa.""","""['Junfeng Jiang', 'Weirong Cui', 'Wanwipa Vongsangnak', 'Guang Hu', 'Bairong Shen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Systematic enrichment analysis of potentially functional regions for 103 prostate cancer risk-associated loci.', 'Functional annotation of risk loci identified through genome-wide association studies for prostate cancer.', 'TAGOOS: genome-wide supervised learning of non-coding loci associated to complex phenotypes.', 'Association of prostate cancer risk with SNPs in regions containing androgen receptor binding sites captured by ChIP-On-chip analyses.', 'Mechanistic insights into genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide association analysis reveals regulation of at-risk loci by DNA methylation in prostate cancer.', 'Data-driven translational prostate cancer research: from biomarker discovery to clinical decision.', 'An Integrative Genomics Approach for Associating Genome-Wide Association Studies Information With Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer Phenotypes.', 'Enrichment of putative PAX8 target genes at serous epithelial ovarian cancer susceptibility loci.', 'eQTL analysis links inflammatory bowel disease associated 1q21 locus to ECM1 gene.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-cancer activity ofBall Moss.  Methods:   The anti-proliferation activity of the crude methanolic extract of the T recurvata was evaluated in vitro in five different histogenic cancer cell lines (prostate cancer - PC-3, breast cancer Kaposi sarcoma, B-16 melanoma and a B-cell lymphoma from a transgenic mouse strain) using the trypan blue assay. The crude extract was also evaluated in vivo in tumour-bearing mice. Immunohistochemistry staining with Apoptag was used for histology and determination of apoptosis.  Results:   The crude methanolic extract of T recurvata demonstrated anti-proliferation activity against all the cell lines, killing > 50% of the cells at a concentration of 2.5 microg/ml. Kaposi sarcoma xenograft tumours were inhibited by up to 75% compared to control in the in vivo study (p < 0.05). There was evidence of DNA fragmentation and a decrease in cell viability on histological studies. The methanolic extract showed no toxic effect in the mice at a dose of 200 mg/kg.

Our study for Jagged1 expression in 218 prostate cancer tissue samples also supports this conclusion. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of Jagged1 in promoting the progression of prostate cancer is still unclear. Through cell proliferation examination, androgen receptor (AR) was found to promote the oncogenic function of Jagged1 to enhance the cell proliferation rate by comparing four prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, LAPC4, DU145, and PC3, which was further validated through analyzing the survival of 118 patients treated with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with different expression levels of Jagged1 and AR. More importantly, our data showed that Jagged1 combined with AR could increase the phosphorylation level of Akt and, in turn, phosphorylated Akt plays an important role in regulating the expression level of cyclin B1 by interacting with AR and increasing the transcriptional activity of AR.

Design:   Observational study.  Setting:   Sweden, 1996-2010.  Participants:   34,515 men primarily treated for prostate cancer with surgery (n=21,533) or radiotherapy (n=12,982). Patients were categorised by risk group (low, intermediate, high, and metastatic), age, and Charlson comorbidity score.  Main outcome measures:   Cumulative incidence of mortality from prostate cancer and other causes. Competing risks regression hazard ratios for radiotherapy versus surgery were computed without adjustment and after propensity score and traditional (multivariable) adjustments, as well as after propensity score matching. Several sensitivity analyses were performed.  Results:   Prostate cancer mortality became a larger proportion of overall mortality as risk group increased for both the surgery and the radiotherapy cohorts. Among patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer the adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio for prostate cancer mortality favoured surgery (1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.49 to 2.08, for radiotherapy v prostatectomy), whereas there was no discernible difference in treatment effect among men with metastatic disease. Subgroup analyses indicated more clear benefits of surgery among younger and fitter men with intermediate and high risk disease. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the main findings.  Conclusions:   This large observational study with follow-up to 15 years suggests that for most men with non-metastatic prostate cancer, surgery leads to better survival than does radiotherapy.

We investigated the effects of shikonin on the growth of prostate cancer cells. We observed that shikonin decreased the expression of AR at both the mRNA and the protein levels in LNCaP and 22RV1 human prostate cancer cells.

In this study, we monitored the abundance of potential non-invasive markers of prostate carcinoma such as amino acid sarcosine, involved in the metabolism of amino acids and methylation processes, ongoing during the progression of prostate carcinoma. in addition, other potential prostate tumor markers were studied. The most significant markers, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and free PSA (fPSA), already used in clinical diagnosis, were analyzed using an immunoenzymometric assay. Whole amino acid profiles were also determined to evaluate the status of amino acids in patient urine samples and to elucidate the possibility of their utilization for prostate carcinoma diagnosis. To obtain the maximum amount of information, the biochemical parameters were determined using various spectrophotometric methods. All results were subjected to statistical processing for revealing different correlations between the studied parameters. We observed alterations in most of the analyzed substances. Based on the results obtained, we concluded that the specificity of prostate carcinoma diagnosis could be improved by determination of common urine metabolites, since we compiled a set of tests, including the analysis of sarcosine, proline, PSA and uric acid in the urine.

Its tumor-suppressor activity has been shown to depend on the propeptide region. Previous studies have reported that the expression levels of lysyl oxidase propeptide (LOX-PP) are associated with cancer of the breast, pancreas, lung, prostate and gastrointestinal system. However, to date, the exact effects and molecular mechanisms of LOX-PP in hepatocellular carcinoma progression are still unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of LOX-PP in human hepatocellular carcinoma. First, 42 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) were collected, and the expression of LOX-PP in these samples was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The clinicopathological characteristics of all patients were recorded. Next, in in vitro studies, recombinant adenovirus LOX (ad-LOX-PP) was used to infect hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines to determine the function of LOX-PP. To determine whether ad-LOX-PP affects hepatocellular carcinoma cell survival, cell viability was examined by CCK-8 assay, and cell cycle progression was assessed by flow cytometry. We also investigated the effects of LOX-PP on the expression of cell cycle regulators (cyclin D1 and cyclin E) by western blot analysis. The migration and invasion capacities of hepatocellular carcinoma cells were observed by wound-healing and tranwell invasion assays. To further investigate how LOX-PP affects migration levels of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were assessed by western blot analysis. Additionally, markers of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathway were detected to further confirm the mechanisms of LOX-PP. As a result, reduced expression of LOX-PP was found in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, when compared with that in the ANCTs (15 vs. 83%, P<0.01), and its expression was associated with tumor stage and distant metastasis (each P<0.05). Proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells was significantly decreased in the ad-LOX-PP group as indicated by CCK-8 assay. LOX-PP significantly reduced the expression of Ki-67, while prominent increases in the rate of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were observed. Similarly, cell migration was significantly inhibited in the ad-LOX-PP group as evidenced by transwell invasion and wound-healing assays. The expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were attenuated in the ad-LOX-PP group, suggesting that LOX-PP inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration via down-regulation of MMPs expression. When LOX-PP expression was potentiated by an adenovirus containing LOX-PP, the expression of p-ERK was significantly downregulated, indicating that LOX-PP inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and induces its apoptosis probably through downregulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway.""","""['Ying Zheng', 'Xuemei Wang', 'Haidong Wang', 'Wei Yan', 'Quan Zhang', 'Xin Chang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Functions and Mechanisms of Pro-Lysyl Oxidase Processing in Cancers and Eye Pathologies with a Focus on Diabetic Retinopathy.', 'Expression of lysyl oxidase in human osteosarcoma and its clinical significance: a tumor suppressive role of LOX in human osteosarcoma cells.', 'Mechanism of lysyl oxidase (LOX) in breast cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Human breast cancer cell metastasis is attenuated by lysyl oxidase inhibitors through down-regulation of focal adhesion kinase and the paxillin-signaling pathway.', 'Paradoxical roles for lysyl oxidases in cancer--a prospect.', 'Mechanistic insight into lysyl oxidase in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis.', 'Functions and Mechanisms of Pro-Lysyl Oxidase Processing in Cancers and Eye Pathologies with a Focus on Diabetic Retinopathy.', 'Roles of Lysyl Oxidase Family Members in the Tumor Microenvironment and Progression of Liver Cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis of key genes associated with ceRNA networks in nasopharyngeal carcinoma based on bioinformatics analysis.', 'Effects of High Glucose-Induced Lysyl Oxidase Propeptide on Retinal Endothelial Cell Survival: Implications for Diabetic Retinopathy.']"""

In this study, we examine the effectiveness of vaccination using interleukin (IL)-15-expressing tumor cells and also examine their ability to upregulate immune responses to tumor antigens. We demonstrated that the coexpression of IL-15 with its receptor, IL-15Rα, increased the cell-surface expression and secretion of IL-15. We show that a gene transfer approach using recombinant adenovirus to express IL-15 and IL-15Rα in murine TRAMP-C2 prostate or TS/A breast tumors induced antitumor immune responses. From this, we developed a vaccine platform, consisting of TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells or TS/A breast cancer cells coexpressing IL-15 and IL-15Rα that inhibited tumor formation when mice were challenged with tumor. Inhibition of tumor growth led to improved survival when compared with animals receiving cells expressing IL-15 alone or unmodified tumor cells. Animals vaccinated with tumor cells coexpressing IL-15 and IL-15Rα showed greater tumor infiltration with CD8(+) T and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as increased antitumor CD8(+) T-cell responses.

Despite the absence of prospective randomized studies, salvage lymph node dissection (LND) has been proposed as an alternative treatment option.  Objective:   To examine long-term outcomes of salvage LND in patients with nodal recurrent PCa documented by 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan.  Design, setting, and participants:   Overall, 59 patients affected by biochemical recurrence (BCR) with 11C-choline PET/CT scan with pathologic activity treated between 2002 and 2008 were included.  Intervention:   Pelvic and/or retroperitoneal salvage LND.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Biochemical response (BR) was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <0.2 ng/ml at 40 d after surgery. BCR for those who achieved BR was defined as a PSA >0.2 ng/ml. Clinical recurrence (CR) was defined as a positive PET/CT scan after salvage LND in the presence of a rising PSA. Kaplan-Meier curves assessed time to BCR, CR, and cancer-specific mortality (CSM). Cox regression analyses were fitted to assess predictors of CR.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up after salvage LND was 81.1 mo. Overall, 35 patients (59.3%) achieved BR. The 8-yr BCR-free survival rate in patients with complete BR was 23%. Overall, the 8-yr CR- and CSM-free survival rates were 38% and 81%, respectively. In multivariable analyses evaluating preoperative variables, PSA at salvage LND represented the only predictor of CR (p=0.03). When postoperative variables were considered, BR and the presence of retroperitoneal lymph node metastases were significantly associated with the risk of CR (all p ≤ 0.04). Our study is limited by the lack of a control group.  Conclusions:   Salvage LND may represent a therapeutic option for patients with BCR after RP and nodal pathologic uptake at 11C-choline PET/CT scan. Although most patients progressed to BCR after salvage LND, roughly 40% of them experienced CR-free survival.  Patient summary:   Salvage lymph node dissection may represent a therapeutic option for selected patients with nodal recurrence after radical prostatectomy.

However, there is no evidence that such men are consistently advised by GPs and patients experience substantial unmet need for reassurance and advice.  Objective:   The intent of the study was to evaluate a brief, email-based educational program for GPs to manage standardized patients presenting with symptoms or side effects months or years after prostate cancer treatment.  Methods:   GPs viewed six pairs of video vignettes of actor-patients depicting men who had been treated for prostate cancer. The actor-patients presented problems that were attributable to the treatment of cancer. In Phase 1, GPs indicated their diagnosis and stated if they would prescribe, refer, or order tests based on that diagnosis. These responses were compared to the management decisions for those vignettes as recommended by a team of experts in prostate cancer. After Phase 1, all the GPs were invited to participate in an email-based education program (Spaced Education) focused on prostate cancer. Participants received feedback and could compare their progress and their performance with other participants in the study. In Phase 2, all GPs, regardless of whether they had completed the program, were invited to view another set of six video vignettes with men presenting similar problems to Phase 1. They again offered a diagnosis and stated if they would prescribe, refer, or order tests based on that diagnosis.  Results:   In total, 64 general practitioners participated in the project, 57 GPs participated in Phase 1, and 45 in Phase 2. The Phase 1 education program was completed by 38 of the 57 (59%) participants. There were no significant differences in demographics between those who completed the program and those who did not. Factors determining whether management of cases was consistent with expert opinion were number of sessions worked per week (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.90), site of clinical practice (remote practice, OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.01-5.03), number of patients seen per week (150 patients or more per week, OR 10.66, 95% CI 3.40-33.48), and type of case viewed. Completion of the Spaced Education did impact whether patient management was consistent with expert opinion (not completed, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.5-1.56).  Conclusions:   The management of standardized patients by GPs was particularly unlikely to be consistent with expert opinion in the management of impotence and bony metastasis. There was no evidence from this standardized patient study that Spaced Education had an impact on the management of patients in this context. However, the program was not completed by all participants.

Here, we investigated whether PSMA serves as a novel regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling by employing PSMA knockdown model and PI3K pharmacological inhibitor (LY294002) in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   PSMA knockdown had been stably established by transfecting with lentivirus-mediated siRNA in our previous study. Then, LNCaP cells were divided into interference, non-interference, and blank groups. We first testified the efficacy of PSMA knockdown in our LNCaP cell line. Then, we compared the expression of PSMA and total/activated Akt by Western blotting in the above three groups with or without LY294002 treatment. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry was performed to confirm the changes of activated Akt (p-Akt, Ser473) in groups. Besides, cell proliferation, migration, and cell cycle were measured by CCK-8 assay, Transwell analysis, and Flow cytometry respectively.  Results:   After PSMA knockdown, the level of p-Akt (Ser473) but not of total-Akt (Akt1/2) was significantly decreased when compared with the non-interference and blank groups. However, LY294002 administration significantly reduced the expression of p-Akt (Ser473) in all the three groups. The results of immunocytochemistry further confirmed that PSMA knockdown or LY294002 treatment was associated with p-Akt (Ser473) down-regulation. Decrease of cell proliferation, migration, and survival were also observed upon PSMA knockdown and LY294002 treatment.  Conclusions:   Taken together, our results reveal that PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibition may serve as a novel molecular mechanism in LNCaP prostate cancer cells of PSMA knockdown and suggest that Akt (Ser473) may play a critical role as a downstream signaling target effector of PSMA in this cellular model.""","""['Zhenghui Guo', 'Yiming Lai', 'Tao Du', 'Yiming Zhang', 'Jieqing Chen', 'Liangkuan Bi', 'Tianxin Lin', 'Hao Liu', 'Wei Wang', 'Kewei Xu', 'Chun Jiang', 'Jinli Han', 'Caixia Zhang', 'Wen Dong', 'Jian Huang', 'Hai Huang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Chin Med J (Engl)""","""['The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the prostate specific membrane antigen/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (PSMA/GCPII) in cancer and neurological disease.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA): a novel modulator of p38 for proliferation, migration, and survival in prostate cancer cells.', 'PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer.', 'The proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, and its interference with bFGF signaling and PSMA in prostate cancer cells.', 'GCPII imaging and cancer.', 'Rationale for Prostate-Specific-Membrane-Antigen-Targeted Radionuclide Theranostic Applied to Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma.', 'Chemically programmable bacterial probes for the recognition of cell surface proteins.', 'New Prostate Cancer Targets for Diagnosis, Imaging, and Therapy: Focus on Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', 'The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the prostate specific membrane antigen/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (PSMA/GCPII) in cancer and neurological disease.', 'Alterations in androgen deprivation enhanced prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression in prostate cancer cells as a target for diagnostics and therapy.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the expression level of AKR1C3 and the progression of PCa.  Methods:   Sixty human prostate needle biopsy tissue specimens and ten LNCaP xenografts from intact or castrated male mice were included in the study. The relationship between the level of AKR1C3 expression by immunohistochemistry and evaluation factors for PCa progression, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score (GS) and age, were analyzed.  Results:   Low immunoreactivity of AKR1C3 was detected in normal prostate epithelium, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Positive staining was gradually increased with an elevated GS in PCa epithelium and LNCaP xenografts in mice after castration. The Spearman's r values (rs) of AKR1C3 to GS and PSA levels were 0.396 (P = 0.025) and -0.377 (P = 0.036), respectively, in PCa biopsies. The rs of AKR1C3 to age was 0.76 (P = 0.011). No statistically significant difference was found with other variables.

The PTI-1 mRNA has a very eccentric structure as the 5'UTR is similar to prokaryotic 23S rRNA, while the major open reading frame and the 3'UTR corresponds to a part of the mRNA encoding human translation elongation factor eEF1A1. Thus, the largest open reading frame encodes a truncated version of eEF1A1 lacking the first 67 amino acids, while having three unique N-terminal amino acids. Previously, the UTRs were shown to be a prerequisite for the transforming capacity of the PTI-1 transcript. In this study, we have investigated the possible role of the UTRs in regulating protein expression and localization.  Methods:   The protein expression profiles of a number of PTI-1 mRNA variants were studied in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the oncogenic potentials of the same PTI-1 mRNAs were determined by monitoring the capacities of stably transfected cells expressing these mRNAs to induce tumors in nude mice and form foci in cell culture. Finally, the cellular localizations of PTI-1 proteins expressed from these mRNAs were determined by fluorescence microscopy.  Results:   The PTI-1 mRNA was found to give rise to multiple protein products that potentially originate from translation initiation at downstream, inframe AUGs within the major open reading frame. At least one of the truncated protein variants was also found to be oncogenic. However, the UTRs did not appear to influence the amount and identities of these truncated protein products. In contrast, our localization studies showed that the UTRs of the transcript promote a nuclear localization of the encoded protein(s).  Conclusions:   Translation of the PTI-1 mRNA results in multiple protein products of which (a) truncated variant(s) may play a predominant role during cellular transformation. The PTI-1 UTRs did not seem to play a role in translation regulation, but appeared to contribute to a nuclear localization of the PTI-1 protein(s). This indicates that the PTI-1 protein(s) exert(s) its/their oncogenic function inside the nucleus.""","""['Louise D Dahl', 'Thomas J Corydon', 'Liina Ränkel', 'Karen Margrethe Nielsen', 'Ernst-Martin Füchtbauer', 'Charlotte R Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Cell Int""","""['Deconstructing PTI-1: PTI-1 is a truncated, but not mutated, form of translation elongatin factor 1A1, eEF1A1.', ""Both the 5' and 3' noncoding regions of the thyrotropin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid influence the level of receptor protein expression in transfected mamalian cells."", 'Identification of the human prostatic carcinoma oncogene PTI-1 by rapid expression cloning and differential RNA display.', 'Translational infidelity and human cancer: role of the PTI-1 oncogene.', ""The role of the 5' untranslated region of an mRNA in translation regulation during development."", 'GBAS Regulates the Proliferation and Metastasis of Ovarian Cancer Cells by Combining with eEF1A1.', 'Localization and Functional Roles of Components of the Translation Apparatus in the Eukaryotic Cell Nucleus.', 'Improved Identification of Small Open Reading Frames Encoded Peptides by Top-Down Proteomic Approaches and De Novo Sequencing.', 'CagA orchestrates eEF1A1 and PKCδ to induce interleukin-6 expression in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells.', 'Improved Identification and Analysis of Small Open Reading Frame Encoded Polypeptides.']"""

Patients and methods:   In all, 2375 consecutive LRPs were evaluated between 1999 and 2013. Of the 1751 patients enrolled with complete follow-up data (>24 months), patients were divided into three groups according to clinical stage of prostate cancer using Tumour-Node-Metastasis (TNM) classification. Group 1 consisted of patients with cT1 stage prostate cancer, group 2 those with cT2, and group 3 those with cT3. Demographic, postoperative, and long-term data of patients were recorded and statistical analyses were performed.  Results:   The mean (SD) age was 63.6 (6.2) years. The mean (SD) follow-up was 104 (28.4) months. There were 417 patients in group 1, 842 patients in group 2, and 492 patients in group 3. The mean prostate-specific antigen level, biopsy Gleason score, tumour volume, body mass index, and age, were all higher in group 3 (P < 0.001). Nerve-sparing techniques were used more in group 1 than in the other groups (P < 0.001). Extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, Gleason score, positive surgical margin (PSM), and rate of adjuvant hormone and radiotherapies were highest in group 3. However, urinary continence was similar in all groups. Group 1 contained the most patients with an erection sufficient for intercourse. Group 1 had the best cancer-specific survival rate, whereas overall survival (OS) rates and complications were similar in all groups.  Conclusion:   LRP seems effective and safe for patients with cT3 prostate cancer with similar OS rates as for those with cT1 and cT2; however, additional therapies may have contributed to these rates. LRP can be considered for the treatment of patients with cT3 prostate cancer.""","""['Ali S Gözen', 'Yigit Akin', 'Mutlu Ates', 'Marcel Hruza', 'Jens Rassweiler']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Long-term oncological and continence outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single-centre experience.', 'Impact of body mass index on outcomes of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with long-term follow-up.', 'Radical prostatectomy for clinically advanced (cT3) prostate cancer since the advent of prostate-specific antigen testing: 15-year outcome.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with node-positive prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Here we report on the fabrication and atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization of a core-shell nanocomposite consisting of a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) coated with riboflavin receptor-targeting poly(amido amine) dendrimer. We designed this nanocomposite for potential applications such as a cancer targeted imaging material based on its surface plasmon resonance properties conferred by AuNP. We employed AFM as a technique for probing the binding interaction between the nanocomposite and riboflavin binding protein (RfBP) in solution. AFM enabled precise measurement of the AuNP height distribution before (13.5 nm) and after chemisorption of riboflavin-conjugated dendrimer (AuNP-dendrimer; 20.5 nm). Binding of RfBP to the AuNP-dendrimer caused a height increase to 26.7 nm, which decreased to 22.8 nm when coincubated with riboflavin as a competitive ligand, supporting interaction of AuNP-dendrimer and its target protein. In summary, physical determination of size distribution by AFM imaging can serve as a quantitative approach to monitor and characterize the nanoscale interaction between a dendrimer-covered AuNP and target protein molecules in vitro.""","""['Amanda B Witte', 'Abigail N Leistra', 'Pamela T Wong', 'Sophia Bharathi', 'Kevin Refior', 'Phillip Smith', 'Ola Kaso', 'Kumar Sinniah', 'Seok Ki Choi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Phys Chem B""","""['Force spectroscopy of multivalent binding of riboflavin-conjugated dendrimers to riboflavin binding protein.', 'New insights into the structure of PAMAM dendrimer/gold nanoparticle nanocomposites.', 'Direct synthesis and morphological characterization of gold-dendrimer nanocomposites prepared using PAMAM succinamic acid dendrimers: preliminary study of the calcification potential.', 'In vitro and in vivo applications of 3D dendritic gold nanostructures.', 'Metallodendrimers and dendrimer nanocomposites.', 'Riboflavin-Targeted Drug Delivery.', 'Mechanisms and implications of dual-acting methotrexate in folate-targeted nanotherapeutic delivery.']"""
