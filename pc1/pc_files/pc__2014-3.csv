Methods:   To evaluate the pathogenic role of this indigenous bacterium, we screened for the bacterium in radical prostatectomy specimens using enzyme immunohistochemistry with a novel P. acnes-specific monoclonal antibody (PAL antibody), together with an anti-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) antibody. We examined formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of radical prostatectomy specimens from 28 patients with prostate cancer and 18 age-matched control patients with bladder cancer, but without prostate cancer.  Results:   Immunohistochemistry with the PAL antibody revealed small round bodies within some non-cancerous glandular epithelium and stromal macrophages in most prostate samples. Prostate cancer samples had higher frequencies of either cytoplasmic P. acnes or nuclear NF-κB expression of glandular epithelium and higher numbers of stromal macrophages with P. acnes than control samples. These parameters were also higher in the peripheral zone than in the transitional zone of the prostate, especially in prostate cancer samples. Nuclear NF-κB expression was more frequent in glands with P. acnes than in glands without P. acnes. The number of stromal macrophages with the bacterium correlated with the grade of chronic inflammation in both the PZ and TZ areas and with the grade of acute inflammation in the TZ area.  Conclusions:   Immunohistochemical analysis with a novel monoclonal antibody for detecting P. acnes in the prostate suggested that intraepithelial P. acnes infection in non-cancerous prostate glands and inflammation caused by the bacterium may contribute to the development of prostate cancer.""","""['Yuan Bae', 'Takashi Ito', 'Tadatsune Iida', 'Keisuke Uchida', 'Masaki Sekine', 'Yutaka Nakajima', 'Jiro Kumagai', 'Tetsuji Yokoyama', 'Hiroshi Kawachi', 'Takumi Akashi', 'Yoshinobu Eishi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Frequency of Propionibacterium acnes Infection in Prostate Glands with Negative Biopsy Results Is an Independent Risk Factor for Prostate Cancer in Patients with Increased Serum PSA Titers.', 'Propionibacterium acnes associated with inflammation in radical prostatectomy specimens: a possible link to cancer evolution?', 'Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of Propionibacterium acnes isolates from radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Links between Propionibacterium acnes and prostate cancer.', 'P. acnes-Driven Disease Pathology: Current Knowledge and Future Directions.', 'Bacterial-Mediated Tumor Therapy: Old Treatment in a New Context.', 'Potential Association of Cutibacterium acnes with Sarcoidosis as an Endogenous Hypersensitivity Infection.', 'Relationship between pyroptosis-mediated inflammation and the pathogenesis of prostate disease.', 'Microbiome and Prostate Cancer: A Novel Target for Prevention and Treatment.', 'Endogenous Propionibacterium acnes Promotes Ovarian Cancer Progression via Regulating Hedgehog Signalling Pathway.']"""

HR-MALDI-IMS in negative mode in a mass range of m/z 500-1000 was performed on optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound-embedded human prostate tissue samples obtained from patients with prostate cancer at the time of radical prostatectomy. HR-MALDI-IMS analysis of the 14 samples in the discovery set identified 26 molecules as highly expressed in the prostate. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) showed that these molecules included 14 phosphatidylinositols (PIs), 3 phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) and 3 phosphatidic acids (PAs). Among the PIs, the expression of PI(18:0/18:1), PI(18:0/20:3) and PI(18:0/20:2) were significantly higher in cancer tissue than in benign epithelium. A biomarker algorithm for prostate cancer was formulated by analyzing the expression profiles of PIs in cancer tissue and benign epithelium of the discovery set using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The sensitivity and specificity of this algorithm for prostate cancer diagnosis in the 24 validation set samples were 87.5 and 91.7%, respectively. In conclusion, HR-MALDI-IMS identified several PIs as being more highly expressed in prostate cancer than benign prostate epithelium.

Exome sequencing detected 2188 and 3840 mutations in LNCaP and C4-2B cells, respectively, of which 1784 were found in both cell lines. Surprisingly, the parental LNCaP cells have over 400 mutations that were not found in the C4-2B genome. More than half of the mutations found in the exomes were confirmed by analyzing the RNA-seq data, and we observed that the expressed genes are more prone to mutations than non-expressed genes. The transcriptomes also revealed that 457 genes show increased expression and 246 genes show decreased expression in C4-2B compared to LNCaP cells. By combining the list of C4-2B-specific mutations with the list of differentially expressed genes, we detected important changes in the focal adhesion and ECM-receptor interaction pathways. Integration of these pathways converges on the myosin light chain kinase gene (MLCK) which might contribute to the metastatic potential of C4-2B cells. In conclusion, we provide extensive databases for mutated genes and differentially expressed genes in the LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines.

A clear-cut mechanism for its observed function(s) has not been previously identified. We found significant upregulation of AGR-2 expression in a bone metastatic prostate cancer cell line, PC3, following culturing in bone marrow-conditioned medium. Substantial AGR-2 expression was also confirmed in prostate cancer tissue specimens in patients with bone lesions. By developing stable clones of PC3 cells with varying levels of AGR-2 expression, we identified that abrogation of AGR-2 significantly reduced cellular attachment to fibronectin, collagen I, collagen IV, laminin I and fibrinogen. Loss of cellular adhesion was associated with sharp decrease in the expression of α4, α5, αV, β3 and β4 integrins. Failure to undergo apoptosis following detachment is a hallmark of epithelial cancer metastasis. The AGR-2-silenced PC3 cells showed higher resistance to Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis- inducing ligand (TRAIL) induced apoptosis in vitro. This observation was also supported by significantly reduced Caspase-3 expression in AGR-2-silenced PC3 cells, which is a key effector of both extrinsic and intrinsic death signaling pathways.

These colonies are believed to be derived from stem cells, transit-amplifying cells and differentiated cells respectively. More recently, this approach has been extended to cancer cell lines. However, we observed that meroclones from the prostate cancer cell line DU145 produce holoclones, a paradoxical observation as meroclones are thought to be derived from transit-amplifying cells. The purpose of this study was to confirm this observation and determine if both holoclones and meroclones from cancer cell lines contain stem cells. We demonstrated that both holoclones and meroclones can be serially passaged indefinitely, are highly proliferative, can self-renew to form spheres, are serially tumorigenic and express stem cell markers. This study demonstrates that the major difference between holoclones and meroclones derived from a cancer cell line is the proportion of stem cells within each colony, not the presence or absence of stem cells.

In these studies, effects of calcitriol and a less-calcemic vitamin D analog, QW-1624F2-2 (QW), were tested in vivo, using the aggressive autochthonous transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. To study prevention of androgen-stimulated prostate cancer, vehicle, calcitriol (20 µg/kg), or QW (50 µg/kg) were administered to 4 week-old TRAMP mice intraperitoneal (i.p.) 3×/week on a MWF schedule for 14 weeks. Calcitriol and QW slowed progression of prostate cancer as indicated by reduced urogenital tract (p = 0.0022, calcitriol; p = 0.0009, QW) and prostate weights (p = 0.0178, calcitriol; p = 0.0086, QW). However, only calcitriol increased expression of the pro-differentiation marker, cadherin 1 (p = 0.0086), and reduced tumor proliferation (p = 0.0467). By contrast, neither vitamin D analog had any effect on castration resistant prostate cancer in mice treated pre- or post-castration. Interestingly, although vitamin D showed inhibitory activity against primary tumors in hormone-intact mice, distant organ metastases seemed to be enhanced following treatment (p = 0.0823). Therefore, TRAMP mice were treated long-term with calcitriol to further examine effects on metastasis. Calcitriol significantly increased the number of distant organ metastases when mice were treated from 4 weeks-of-age until development of palpable tumors (20-25 weeks-of-age)(p = 0.0003). Overall, data suggest that early intervention with vitamin D in TRAMP slowed androgen-stimulated tumor progression, but prolonged treatment resulted in development of a resistant and more aggressive disease associated with increased distant organ metastasis.""","""['Adebusola Alagbala Ajibade', 'Jason S Kirk', 'Ellen Karasik', 'Bryan Gillard', 'Michael T Moser', 'Candace S Johnson', 'Donald L Trump', 'Barbara A Foster']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Characterization of Vitamin D insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Characterization of the autochthonous transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) as a model to study effects of castration therapy.', 'Inhibition of prostate cancer metastasis in vivo: a comparison of 1,23-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) and EB1089.', 'Vitamin D in Prostate Cancer.', 'Vitamin D and prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin D, Th17 Lymphocytes, and Breast Cancer.', 'Vitamin D Metabolites in Nonmetastatic High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients with and without Zoledronic Acid Treatment after Prostatectomy.', 'Single-cell analyses unravel cell type-specific responses to a vitamin D analog in prostatic precancerous lesions.', 'Anti-Tumor Effects of Ginsenoside 20(S)-Protopanaxadiol and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Combination in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Calcitriol in the Presence of Conditioned Media from Metastatic Breast Cancer Cells Enhances Ex Vivo Polarization of M2 Alternative Murine Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages.']"""

We assessed the joint effect of two loci on rs4242382 at 8q24 and rs10486567 at 7p15.2 to this end. We analyzed the data from a Finnish family-based genetic study, which was composed of 947 men including 228 cases in 75 families, to evaluate the respective effects of the two loci on the disease penetrance; in particular, the occurrence and number of prostate cancer cases within a family were utilized to evaluate the interactions between the two loci under the additive and multiplicative Poisson regression models.

The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the nutritional status and eating habits of men diagnosed and treated for one of the above diseases. MATERIAL AND METODS: The nutritional status of 30 male patients with clinically confirmed and treated disease of the prostatic gland, including 15 men (aged 51-75 years) with BPH and 15 men (aged 51-73 years) with PC, was evaluated based on their BMI, WC, WHR, and WHtR parameters. In turn, the energy and nutritive value of 90 daily food rations (DFRs) was evaluated. Finally, calculations were made for the Key's index of diet atherogenicity, resultant Glycemic Index (GI) and Glycemic Load (GL).  Results:   Higher values of the BMI, WC, WHR and WHtR parameters were noted in the men with PC, they were also characterized by a higher incidence of peripheral subcutaneous obesity and visceral obesity. The DFRs of the men were characterized by a low energy value and by a low intake of available carbohydrates, dietary fi ber, K, Ca, Mg, vitamins D and C, and fl uids at a simultaneously high intake of total and animal protein, cholesterol, Na, P, Fe, Cu as well as vitamins B2 and PP. The contribution of energy derived from the basic nutrients diverged from the recommended values. In addition, the DFRs were characterized by high values of Key's index and 24-h GL. Differences in meeting the RDA for selected nutrients between the analysed groups of men were statistically significant.  Conclusions:   The improper nutritional status of the men may result from their incorrect nutritional habits which fail to improve their health status, and even predispose them to the development of some diet-dependent diseases. In view of that, both correction of diets of the surveyed men, as well as their health-promoting nutritional education in the aspect of prostate diseases seem necessary.""","""['Zuzanna Goluch-Koniuszy', 'Magda Rygielska', 'Ilona Nowacka']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Sci Pol Technol Aliment""","""['Simple obesity in children.

Methods:   Systematic searches of PubMed and several other databases up to June 2013 were retrieved. All epidemiologic studies regarding coffee consumption and prostate cancer risk were included, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the strength of the association.  Results:   Twelve case-control studies involving 7,909 prostate cancer cases and 9,461 controls and nine cohort studies involving 455,123 subjects were included in our analysis. Compared with the lowest category, the unstratified highest category of coffee consumption showed a significance reduction in prostate cancer risk of a fixed-effects model (OR 0.91, CI 0.86-0.97). A borderline significant influence was also found when the stratified highest category (US ≥ 4, Europe ≥ 5) of coffee consumption was compared with the reference category (OR 0.96, CI 0.92-1.00), but no relationships were observed for the other two categories. In another analysis conducted by coffee consumption and prostate cancer stage and Gleason grade, our results showed a significant inverse association in all categories of prostate cancer except Gleason <7 grade in a fixed-effects model; the results remained the same, except for advanced prostate cancer, in a random-effects model.

TRUS‑MR‑Dbs were performed on patients with suspected PCa by MRI in addition to TRUS‑Gbs. Only patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) were included in the comparative analysis. TRUS‑biopsy was directed to those areas within suspicious regions with a minimum apparent diffusion coefficient obtained by DWI or with a maximum (choline + creatine)/citrate ratio obtained by MRS. The highest Gleason grades (HGGs) and the Gleason scores (GSs) of specimens were identified. The biopsies and RP results were evaluated using a McNemar test or χ2 analyses using Fisher' exact tests. MRI results were positive in 254 (49.0%) of the 518 patients. TRUS‑MR‑Db detected 165/254 (65.0%) cancer cases and TRUS‑Gb detected 190/518 (36.7%) cancer cases. Forty patients underwent RP. The TRUS‑MR‑Dbs method demonstrated a higher concordance rate (CR) with RP (89.6%) than TRUS‑Gbs (72.9%, P=0.008) for the overall HGG. The CRs with RP for TRUS‑MR‑Dbs vs. those for TRUS‑Gbs were 100 vs. 85.7% (P=0.5), 87.5 vs. 68.8% (P=0.031) and 50 vs. 50% (P=1) for HGG3, HGG4 and HGG5, respectively. The HGG CRs with RP for DWI‑directed biopsies (DWI-Dbs) vs. MRS-directed biopsies (MRS-Dbs) were 77.1 vs. 50.0% (P=0.015) for the overall tumors, 80.0 vs. 40.0% (P=0.003) for peripheral zone tumors and 69.2 vs. 76.9% (P=1) for transition zone tumors. A total of 37 (77.1%) and 25 (52.1%; P=0.007) tumors were assigned accurate GS for TRUS‑MR‑Dbs and TRUS‑Gbs, respectively. The results revealed that TRUS‑MR‑Dbs improved the prediction of PCa aggressiveness and that DWI-Dbs had a superior performance when compared with MRS‑Dbs in the peripheral zone.""","""['Jie Zhang', 'Jianjun Xiu', 'Yin Dong', 'Muwen Wang', 'Xue Han', 'Yejun Qin', 'Zhaoqin Huang', 'Shifeng Cai', 'Xianshun Yuan', 'Qingwei Liu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Prospective assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness using 3-T diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsies versus a systematic 10-core transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsy cohort.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Localising prostate cancer: comparison of endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and 3D-MR spectroscopic imaging with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transectal ultrasound image-fusion biopsies accurately characterize the index tumor: correlation with step-sectioned radical prostatectomy specimens in 135 patients.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

The linkage of TR4 functions in cancer progression, however, remains unclear. Using three different mouse models, we found TR4 could prevent or delay prostate cancer (PCa)/prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia development. Knocking down TR4 in human RWPE1 and mouse mPrE normal prostate cells promoted tumorigenesis under carcinogen challenge, suggesting TR4 may play a suppressor role in PCa initiation. Mechanism dissection in both in vitro cell lines and in vivo mice studies found that knocking down TR4 led to increased DNA damage with altered DNA repair system that involved the modulation of ATM expression at the transcriptional level, and addition of ATM partially interrupted the TR4 small interfering RNA-induced tumorigenesis in cell transformation assays. Immunohistochemical staining in human PCa tissue microarrays revealed ATM expression is highly correlated with TR4 expression.

Here, we investigated the antitumor activity of glionitrin A and its underlying molecular mechanisms in human prostate cancer DU145 cells. Glionitrin A showed significant cytotoxicity, promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Glionitrin A-treated cells exhibited elevated levels of phospho-histone 2AX (Ser139), a marker of DNA damage, and accumulated in both S phase and G2/M phase due to the activation of checkpoints associated with the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated-Rad3-related Chk1/2 pathway downstream of p53-binding protein 1 phosphorylation at Ser1778. In addition, glionitrin A induced apoptosis through both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. Glionitrin A activated caspase-8, -9 and -3 and also released endonuclease G from the mitochondria to the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner. Our in vivo study performed in nude mice bearing xenografts of DU145 cells showed that glionitrin A dramatically reduced the tumor volume by an average of 38.2% (5 mg/kg, per os (p.o.)) and 71.3% (10 mg/kg, p.o.) at 27 d after the beginning of treatment.

The electrochemical performance of the nanowire-based immunosensor array were characterized by (1) differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) to evaluate the specific recognition of PSA, (2) impedance and cyclic voltammetry to observe surface resistance and electroactivity, and (3) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to demonstrate the three-dimensional architecture. The vertically-aligned geometric organization of Ppy provides a novel platform to improve the anti-PSA loading capacity. Overall, enhanced electrochemical performance of the proposed immunosensor has been demonstrated by its linear response over PSA concentrations ranging from 10 fg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) and a detection limit of 0.3 fg mL(-1), indicating that the strategy proposed here has great potential for clinical applications.""","""['Jeong-Mi Moon', 'Yon Hui Kim', 'Youngnam Cho']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['An ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of prostate-specific antigen based on conductivity nanocomposite with halloysite nanotubes.', 'A label-free electrochemiluminescence immunosensor based on EuPO4 nanowire for the ultrasensitive detection of Prostate specific antigen.', 'Electrochemical immunosensor for prostate-specific antigens using a label-free second antibody based on silica nanoparticles and polymer brush.', 'Investigation of SPR and electrochemical detection of antigen with polypyrrole functionalized by biotinylated single-chain antibody: a review.', 'Site-directed antibody immobilization techniques for immunosensors.', 'Current Update on Biomarkers for Detection of Cancer: Comprehensive Analysis.', 'Nanobiosensing with Arrays and Ensembles of Nanoelectrodes.', 'Aberrant sialylation of a prostate-specific antigen: Electrochemical label-free glycoprofiling in prostate cancer serum samples.', 'Can glycoprofiling be helpful in detecting prostate cancer?']"""

In breast cancer, CXCR4 signalling has been reported to be a mediator of metastasis, and is linked to poor prognosis. However its role in normal and malignant breast stem cell function has not been investigated. Anoikis resistant (AR) cells were collected from immortalised (MCF10A, 226L) and malignant (MCF7, T47D, SKBR3) breast cell lines and assessed for stem cell enrichment versus unsorted cells. AR cells had significantly higher mammosphere forming efficiency (MFE) than unsorted cells. The AR normal cells demonstrated increased formation of 3D structures in Matrigel compared to unsorted cells. In vivo, SKBR3 and T47D AR cells had 7- and 130-fold enrichments for tumour formationrespectively, compared with unsorted cells. AR cells contained significantly elevated CXCR4 transcript and protein levels compared to unsorted cells. Importantly, CXCR4 mRNA was higher in stem cell-enriched CD44+/CD24- patient-derived breast cancer cells compared to non-enriched cells. CXCR4 stimulation by its ligand SDF-1 reduced MFE of the normal breast cells lines but increased the MFE in T47D and patient-derived breast cancer cells. CXCR4 inhibition by AMD3100 increased stem cell activity but reduced the self-renewal capacity of the malignant breast cell line T47D. CXCR4+ FACS sorted MCF7 cells demonstrated a significantly increased MFE compared with CXCR4- cells. This significant increase in MFE was further demonstrated in CXCR4 over-expressing MCF7 cells which also had an increase in self-renewal compared to parental cells. A greater reduction in self-renewal following CXCR4 inhibition in the CXCR4 over-expressing cells compared with parental cells was also observed. Our data establish for the first time that CXCR4 signalling has contrasting effects on normal and malignant breast stem cell activity. Here, we demonstrate that CXCR4 signalling specifically regulates breast cancer stem cell activities and may therefore be important in tumour formation at the sites of metastases.""","""['Matthew P Ablett', ""Ciara S O'Brien"", 'Andrew H Sims', 'Gillian Farnie', 'Robert B Clarke']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Effect of fibroblasts on breast cancer cell mammosphere formation and regulation of stem cell-related gene expression.', 'BAG3 promotes stem cell-like phenotype in breast cancer by upregulation of CXCR4 via interaction with its transcript.', 'Effects of human mesenchymal stem cells on ER-positive human breast carcinoma cells mediated through ER-SDF-1/CXCR4 crosstalk.', 'CXCR4 and cancer.', 'Mammary stem cells and breast cancer--role of Notch signalling.', 'Targeting Cancer Stem Cells as the Key Driver of Carcinogenesis and Therapeutic Resistance.', 'CXCR4 and CXCR7 signaling promotes tumor progression and obesity-associated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells.', 'Single-Cell Transcriptomics Identifies Heterogeneity of Mouse Mammary Gland Fibroblasts With Distinct Functions, Estrogen Responses, Differentiation Processes, and Crosstalks With Epithelium.', 'Chemokines network in bone metastasis: Vital regulators of seeding and soiling.', 'ENTREP/FAM189A2 encodes a new ITCH ubiquitin ligase activator that is downregulated in breast cancer.']"""

Through both overexpression and knockdown approaches, we found that in addition to its effects on the E2F pathway, the cell proliferation specific transcription factor FOXM1 stimulated CDC6 transcription in cooperation with AR. We have identified a forkhead box motif in the CDC6 proximal promoter that is occupied by FOXM1 and is sufficient to drive FOXM1-regulated transcription. Indirectly, FOXM1 elevated AR protein levels and AR dependent transcription. Furthermore, FOXM1 and AR proteins physically interact. Using synchronized cultures, we observed that CDC6 expression is elevated near S phase of the cell cycle, at a time coinciding with elevated FOXM1 and AR expression and CDC6 promoter occupancy by both AR and FOXM1 proteins. Androgen increased the binding of AR protein to CDC6 promoter, and AR and FOXM1 knockdown decreased AR binding. These results provided new evidence for the regulatory mechanism of aberrant CDC6 oncogene transcription by FOXM1 and AR, two highly expressed transcription factors in PCa cells. Functionally, the cooperation of FOXM1 and AR accelerated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation by affecting CDC6 gene expression. Furthermore, siomycin A, a proteasome inhibitor known to inhibit FOXM1 expression and activity, inhibited PCa cell proliferation and its effect was additive to that of bicalutamide, an antiandrogen commonly used to treat PCa patients.""","""['Youhong Liu', 'Zhicheng Gong', 'Lunquan Sun', 'Xiong Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Androgen regulates Cdc6 transcription through interactions between androgen receptor and E2F transcription factor in prostate cancer cells.', 'FOXM1 promotes the progression of prostate cancer by regulating PSA gene transcription.', 'A novel androgen receptor-binding element modulates Cdc6 transcription in prostate cancer cells during cell-cycle progression.', 'Role of androgen receptor in prostate cancer cell cycle regulation: interaction with cell cycle regulatory proteins and enzymes of DNA synthesis.', 'FoxM1: at the crossroads of ageing and cancer.', 'Combination of androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide with the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib in triple negative breast cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of N-Acetyltransferase 10 Suppresses the Progression of Prostate Cancer through Regulation of DNA Replication.', 'Forkhead Box Transcription Factors: Double-Edged Swords in Cancer.', 'Novel Oncogenic Transcription Factor Cooperation in RB-Deficient Cancer.', 'Systems Biomedicine of Primary and Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Reveals Potential Therapeutic Targets.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of AR on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress signaling in human hepatoma. AR and GRP78 expressions were examined in human liver tissue panels. Human hepatoma cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA targeting AR and cells over-expressing AR were generated. The expressions of ER-stress molecules and AR were measured by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The effect of AR on ER-stress responsive gene expression was examined by reporter assay. Strong positive correlation between AR mRNA and GRP78 mRNA was observed in stage I/II-HCCs. AR enhanced ER-stress responsive element activities and GRP78 expression, and regulated ER-stress response in hepatocytes. Sorafenib strongly induced significant apoptosis in HepG2 cells by the inhibition of AR and inhibition of the downstream GRP78. AR seems a co-regulator of GRP78 especially in earlier-stage HCC.

We finally assessed the accuracy of the revised GS in biopsy to predict indolent cancer in the prostatectomy specimens.  Results:   The mean GS increased from 6 to 7 after histological revision in biopsy and prostatectomy specimens. Histological revision determined a significant decrease of patients with GS ≤ 6 and an increase of those with GS ≥ 7 (all P < .001).

These results suggest that TSPY could efficiently amplify its expression and oncogenic functions through a positive feedback loop, and contribute to the overall tumorigenic processes when it is expressed in various human cancers.""","""['Tatsuo Kido', 'Yun-Fai Chris Lau']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Gonadoblastoma locus and the TSPY gene on the human Y chromosome.', 'Expression pattern of a gonadoblastoma candidate gene suggests a role of the Y chromosome in prostate cancer.', 'Gonadoblastoma Y locus genes expressed in germ cells of individuals with dysgenetic gonads and a Y chromosome in their karyotypes include DDX3Y and TSPY.', 'The Y-located proto-oncogene TSPY exacerbates and its X-homologue TSPX inhibits transactivation functions of androgen receptor and its constitutively active variants.', 'Gonadoblastoma, testicular and prostate cancers, and the TSPY gene.', 'Epigenetic modification-dependent androgen receptor occupancy facilitates the ectopic TSPY1 expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Potential dual functional roles of the Y-linked RBMY in hepatocarcinogenesis.', 'Dosage regulation, and variation in gene expression and copy number of\xa0human Y chromosome ampliconic genes.', 'The Y-linked proto-oncogene TSPY contributes to poor prognosis of the male hepatocellular carcinoma patients by promoting the pro-oncogenic and suppressing the anti-oncogenic gene expression.', 'Testis-specific protein, Y-linked 1 activates PI3K/AKT and RAS signaling pathways through suppressing IGFBP3 expression during tumor progression.']"""

We examined the impact of age on sexual and urinary function and bother during the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Participants enrolled in CaPSURE™ reported sexual and urinary scores before and after radical prostatectomy using UCLA-PCI. Repeated measures mixed models were used to compare the change in health related quality of life with time between men who were younger (age 60 years or less) and older (age greater than 60 years). Logistic regression models were used to assess associations between age and clinically meaningful health related quality of life decreases (worsening). Models were adjusted for clinical characteristics.  Results:   Of 1,806 patients younger men reported higher sexual and urinary function scores at each time point and higher sexual function decrease rates at 1 year than older men (81% vs 75%, p<0.01). Younger men also had higher sexual bother decrease rates 1 year (74% vs 61%, p<0.01) and 2 years (62% vs 56%, p=0.02) after radical prostatectomy. On multivariate analysis age was associated with changes in sexual function and bother from baseline through 2 years (each p<0.01). Younger men had higher adjusted odds of sexual function decreases at 1 year (OR 1.15/5 years, 95% CI 1.01-1.30, p=0.03) but not at 2 years. Younger age was associated with lower odds of worsening sexual bother at 2 years (OR 0.79/5 years, 95% CI 0.67-0.94, p<0.01). Urinary function and bother decrease rates were similar by age. Secondary analyses of the age/health related quality of life interaction showed that men were at greater risk for health related quality of life decreases if baseline scores were above average regardless of age.  Conclusions:   Younger men reported higher sexual and urinary function overall, and experienced greater decreases in sexual function immediately after radical prostatectomy than older men. While the 2 groups experienced similar relative sexual function decreases at 2 years, younger men had worse interim decreases at 1 year. Providers should consider these findings when discussing treatment timing, particularly with younger men diagnosed with early stage, low grade disease.""","""['Jonathan S Brajtbord', 'Sanoj Punnen', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Christopher J Welty', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Urinary and sexual quality of life 1 year following robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Quality of life in young men after radical prostatectomy.', 'Life after radical prostatectomy: a longitudinal study.', 'Quality of life following radical prostatectomy.', 'A systematic review of expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) quality of life after surgery or radiation treatment.', 'Impact of Urinary Incontinence on the Quality of Life After Open Retropubic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Age-stratified outcomes after radical prostatectomy in a randomized setting (LAP-01): do younger patients have more to lose?', 'Health-Related Quality of Life following Cytoreductive Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with De-Novo Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Predictors of erectile dysfunction after transperineal template prostate biopsy.', 'Is Ki67 prognostic for aggressive prostate cancer?

To examine this issue further urologists in MUSIC assessed statewide prostate biopsy practice patterns and variation in prostate cancer detection.  Materials and methods:   MUSIC is a statewide, physician led collaborative designed to improve prostate cancer care. From March 2012 through June 2013 at 17 MUSIC practices standardized clinical and pathological data were collected on a total of 3,015 men undergoing first-time prostate biopsy. We examined pathological biopsy outcomes according to patient characteristics and across MUSIC practices.  Results:   The average cancer detection rate was 52% with significant variability across MUSIC practices (range 43% to 70%, p<0.0001). Of all patients biopsied 27% were older than 69 years, ranging from 19% to 36% at individual practices. Men with prostate specific antigen less than 4 ng/ml comprised an average of 26% of the study population (range 10% to 37%). The detection rate in patients older than 69 years ranged from 42% to 86% at individual practices (p=0.0008). In the 793 patients with prostate specific antigen less than 4 ng/ml the cancer detection rate ranged from 22% to 58% across individual practices (p=0.0065). The predicted probability of cancer detection varied significantly across MUSIC practices even after adjusting for patient age, prostate specific antigen, prostate size, family history and digital rectal examination findings (p<0.0001).  Conclusions:   While overall detection rates are higher than previously reported, the cancer yield of prostate biopsy varies widely across urology practices in Michigan.

Objective:   To determine surgical, oncologic, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes following RALP and RRP in a nationwide cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified 903 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2000 and 2010 who underwent radical prostatectomy using RALP (n=282) or RRP (n=621) as primary treatment.  Intervention:   Radical prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We compared patients undergoing RALP or RRP across a range of perioperative, oncologic, and HRQOL outcomes.  Results and limitations:   Use of RALP increased during the study period, constituting 85.2% of study subjects in 2009, up from 4.5% in 2003. Patients undergoing RALP compared to RRP were less likely to have a lymph node dissection (51.5% vs 85.4%; p<0.0001), had less blood loss (207.4 ml vs 852.3 ml; p<0.0001), were less likely to receive blood transfusions (4.3% vs 30.3%; p<0.0001), and had shorter hospital stays (1.8 d vs 2.9 d; p<0.0001). Surgical, oncologic, and HRQOL outcomes did not differ significantly among the groups. In multivariate logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in 3- or 5-yr recurrence-free survival comparing RALP versus RRP (hazard ratios: 0.98 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.46-2.08] and 0.75 [95% CI, 0.18-3.11], respectively).  Conclusions:   In a nationwide cohort of patients undergoing surgical treatment for prostate cancer, RALP was associated with shorter hospital stay, and lower blood loss and transfusion rates than RRP. Surgical oncologic and HRQOL outcomes were similar between groups.  Patient summary:   We studied men throughout the United States with prostate cancer who underwent surgical removal of the prostate. We found that robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy resulted in shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, and fewer blood transfusions than radical retropubic prostatectomy.

Patients and methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with CLPC diagnosed from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2003, as documented in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Treatment-stratified, risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were constructed.  Results:   During the study period, CLPC was diagnosed in 294,160 patients. Of these patients, 123,850 (42.1%) underwent surgery and 101,627 (34.5%) underwent radiotherapy, whereas 68,683 (23.3%) received no treatment. Overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates for Asians (85.6% and 67.6%, respectively), Hispanics (85.9% and 69.0%, respectively), and whites (83.9% and 65.7%, respectively) were higher than for blacks (81.5% and 61.7%, respectively) (P<.001). Prostate cancer-specific survival also varied significantly by race (P<.001). A risk-adjusted model stratified by primary treatment modality revealed that blacks had worse overall survival than whites (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.33-1.41; P<.001), whereas Asians had better survival compared with whites (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76-0.83; P<.001). After the effects of treatment were accounted for, Hispanics had similar overall survival compared with whites (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-1.01; P=.10).  Conclusion:   Blacks with CLPC have poorer survival than whites, whereas Asians have better survival, even after risk adjustment and stratification by treatment.

Preliminary findings reported after 5 years of follow-up showed that escalated-dose conformal radiotherapy improved biochemical progression-free survival. Based on the sample size calculation, we planned to analyse overall survival when 190 deaths occurred; this target has now been reached, after a median 10 years of follow-up.  Methods:   RT01 was a phase 3, open-label, international, randomised controlled trial enrolling men with histologically confirmed T1b-T3a, N0, M0 prostate cancer with prostate specific antigen of less than 50 ng/mL. Patients were randomly assigned centrally in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer-based minimisation algorithm stratifying by risk of seminal vesicle invasion and centre to either the control group (64 Gy in 32 fractions, the standard dose at the time the trial was designed) or the escalated-dose group (74 Gy in 37 fractions). Neither patients nor investigators were masked to assignment. All patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for 3-6 months before the start of conformal radiotherapy, which continued until the end of conformal radiotherapy. The coprimary outcome measures were biochemical progression-free survival and overall survival. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. Treatment-related side-effects have been reported previously. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN47772397.  Findings:   Between Jan 7, 1998, and Dec 20, 2001, 862 men were registered and 843 subsequently randomly assigned: 422 to the escalated-dose group and 421 to the control group. As of Aug 2, 2011, 236 deaths had occurred: 118 in each group. Median follow-up was 10·0 years (IQR 9·1-10·8). Overall survival at 10 years was 71% (95% CI 66-75) in each group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·99, 95% CI 0·77-1·28; p=0·96). Biochemical progression or progressive disease occurred in 391 patients (221 [57%] in the control group and 170 [43%] in the escalated-dose group). At 10 years, biochemical progression-free survival was 43% (95% CI 38-48) in the control group and 55% (50-61) in the escalated-dose group (HR 0·69, 95% CI 0·56-0·84; p=0·0003).  Interpretation:   At a median follow-up of 10 years, escalated-dose conformal radiotherapy with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy showed an advantage in biochemical progression-free survival, but this advantage did not translate into an improvement in overall survival. These efficacy data for escalated-dose treatment must be weighed against the increase in acute and late toxicities associated with the escalated dose and emphasise the importance of use of appropriate modern radiotherapy methods to reduce side-effects.

This study helps to inform the interface between aging-related health decline and the survival state among older men with prostate cancer, which is an important yet understudied public health issue.  Methods:   Hierarchical linear models were used to analyze the cross-sectional data from the nationally representative population-based Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Using propensity score matching, survivors (respondents with prostate cancer history) and controls (respondents without a history of any cancer) (N = 193 pairs) were matched based on 7 sociodemographic and health-related factors. QOL was measured using the mental and physical component scores of the SF-12 (SF-36.org). Health status included comorbidities, activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADL, and depressed mood.  Results:   In bivariate analyses, survivors reported worse physical (42.72 vs 45.45 respectively; P = .0040) and mental QOL (51.59 vs 53.73 respectively; P = .0295) and more comorbidities (3.25 vs 2.78 respectively; P = .0139) than controls. In multivariate analyses, for both survivors and controls, better physical QOL was associated with fewer comorbidities (P <.0001), no need help with ADL (P = .0011) and IADL (P = .0162), and less depressed mood (P <.0001); better mental QOL was associated with no need help with IADL (P = .0005) and less depressed mood (P <.0001).  Conclusion:   QOL of older men is affected by physical, functional, and psychological factors rather than prostate cancer history.

In this prospective study, between November 2012 and June 2013, 36 consecutive patients suitable for non-nerve-sparing RARP were alternatively assigned to either CORPUS surgery or Rocco's standard reconstruction.  Technical considerations:   In the CORPUS group, fibers of the bilateral portions of the puborectalis muscle were used to create a sort of posterior hammock for the urethra. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire, Short Form Questionnaire (ICIQ-SF) and International Prostate Symptom Score were collected for all patients preoperatively and then ICIQ-SF at 1 day and both tests at 30 days after catheter removal after RARP. Intraoperative and/or postoperative complications were evaluated. Pearson chi-square test compared urinary continence according to ICIQ-SF at 1 and 30 days. Statistical significance was set at P <.05.  Conclusion:   Fifty percent of CORPUS patients were continent immediately after catheter removal and 83% after 30 days. In controls, the respective percentages were 16% and 61%. The differences were statistically significant in both cases. The International Prostate Symptom Score at 30 days did not show obstructive symptoms in either group. One limitation of this study is the low number of cases, ""superselected"" to evaluate the true effect of CORPUS reconstruction.

Background:   A diagnosis of prostate cancer and subsequent treatment result in a significant number of men experiencing some impairment to their sexual function. There is scant research into the impact of changed sexual function on these men's masculinity, sexuality, intimate relationships and their needs regarding counselling and supportive care.  Design:   Internet-based survey.  Methods:   Focus groups and couple interviews were used to improve validity for questionnaire items designed to provide insight into men's experiences of prostate cancer in areas such as sexual function and relationships. The questionnaire included both closed and open-ended questions and had the option for the wife or partner to complete a section.  Results:   Qualitative research revealed 17 specific categories within three key themes: sexual dysfunction, loss of libido and masculinity. The questionnaire found, unexpectedly, the majority of men said that they had sufficient emotional and psychological support. Wives/partners confirmed cancer had impacted on their partner's feelings of masculinity (71%), compared to 42% of men who felt that this was the case. Predictors of loss of libido, erectile dysfunction and 'feeling less of a man' were developed. Univariate predictors included hormone therapy, regrets about treatment choice, cancer having impacted on masculinity and distress during the last week.  Conclusions:   Men are not able to clearly identify the challenges prostate cancer brings especially changes to their masculinity.  Relevance to clinical practice:   The findings strongly suggest that for men with prostate cancer, nursing assessments of men's sexual health be augmented by information gained from their partners; further, these assessments should be augmented with a careful exploration of these men's psyche guided by the knowledge that masculinity influences perceptions of self (being a man) and help seeking.""","""[""Peter K O'Shaughnessy"", 'Colin Ireland', 'Lemuel Pelentsov', 'Laws A Thomas', 'Adrian J Esterman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""['The prostate cancer journey: results of an online survey of men and their partners.', ""Men's experiences of sexuality after cancer: a material discursive intra-psychic approach."", ""Erectile dysfunction and constructs of masculinity and quality of life in the multinational Men's Attitudes to Life Events and Sexuality (MALES) study."", 'The psychosocial aspects of sexual recovery after prostate cancer treatment.', 'Including partners into the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a review of the literature to provide a model of care.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'Focusing on sexual rehabilitation besides penile rehabilitation following radical prostatectomy is important.', 'Relationship communication and the course of psychological outcomes among couples coping with localised prostate cancer.', 'Antidepressant prescriptions and associated factors in men with prostate cancer and their female partners.', ""The Ecology of Patients' Sexual Health Adjustment After Prostate Cancer Treatment: The Influence of the Social and Healthcare Environment.""]"""

Methods:   Twenty five patients with prostate cancer (median age 66 (62-67) years) who had presented at the Urology Outpatient Clinic were prospectively included in the study. Also, 30 volunteer controls (median age 63 (60-70) years) were enrolled for comparison. Serum total PSA, intact PTH, calcium, aldosterone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were detected in a selected group of patients with prostate cancer.  Results:   The vitamin D levels were lower in PCa patients in line with some of the previous studies, supporting the role of vitamin D in prostate cancer. We also observed a positive correlation between PTH and PSA both in PCa patients and the controls.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicate that like age and race, PSA is associated with PTH. The role of PTH, as a master of calcium homeostasis, seems to be neglected in prostate carcinogenesis, concerning a very few number of studies pertaining to the subject in the literature (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 19).""","""['O Aydin', 'E Eren', 'S Yalcinkaya', 'N Yilmaz', 'M Eroglu', 'H Y Ellidag']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Bratisl Lek Listy""","""['Deficiency of vitamin D and elevated aldosterone in prostate hyperplasia.', 'The relation of serum parathyroid hormone and serum calcium to serum levels of prostate-specific antigen: a population-based study.', 'Vitamin D, PTH, and calcium and tumor aggressiveness in prostate cancer: a prospective nested case-control study.', 'Prostate cancer, serum parathyroid hormone, and the progression of skeletal metastases.', 'Prospective evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and systematic biopsy for detecting prostate cancer in Japanese patients with normal rectal examinations and intermediate prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Predicting clinically significant prostate cancer based on pre-operative patient profile and serum biomarkers.']"""

Objective:   The study is to determine the prostatic weight and document the histopathologic patterns, frequency, and age distribution of clinically asymptomatic prostatic lesions seen at autopsy in LUTH, Lagos, Nigeria over a 12 month period (January to December 2009).  Methods:   Consisted of hospital case files and prostate glands harvested en bloc from all autopsies in men aged 20 years and above who died of other causes other than clinically diagnosed prostate disease in LUTH within the study period. After en block removal, the prostate glands were fixed in formalin, weighed, sectioned at 3-5mm intervals, processed and embedded in paraffin. Whole mount serial sections were stained with H& E and examined.  Results:   Only 145 prostate glands were suitable for histological evaluation. There was an increasing prostatic weight with age. The distribution of identified prostatic lesions showed 75 (51.7%) having no histological diagnosis. Acute and chronic prostatitis accounted for 2 (2.9%) each, benign prostatic hyperplasia alone, 52 (74.2%) while benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) associated with chronic prostatitis accounted for 7 (10%). Latent prostate cancerwas found in 7 (10%) of the cases.  Conclusion:   Prostate weight increased with age. Acute prostatitis was found to be commoner in the younger age groups, particularly below 50 years while chronic prostatitis was seen more in the older men and was largely associated with BPH. BPH was found to be the commonest lesion.

Particularly, the model is personalized with two steps, backward pruning that discards obsolete population-based knowledge, and forward learning that incorporates patient-specific characteristics. By effectively combining the patient-specific characteristics with the general population statistics, the incrementally learned appearance model can localize the prostate of the specific patient much more accurately.

The key to the success of different medical image analysis algorithms is heavily dependent on how we represent the input data, namely features used to characterize the input image. In the literature, feature engineering remains as an active research topic, and many novel hand-crafted features are designed such as Haar wavelet, histogram of oriented gradient, and local binary patterns. However, such features are not designed with the guidance of the underlying dataset at hand. To this end, we argue that the most effective features should be designed in a learning based manner, namely representation learning, which can be adapted to different patient datasets at hand. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to achieve this goal. Specifically, a stacked independent subspace analysis (ISA) network is adopted to learn the most effective features in a hierarchical and unsupervised manner. The learnt features are adapted to the dataset at hand and encode high level semantic anatomical information.

Due to the curse of dimensionality, building classifiers with large numbers of features requires feature selection (which may require a large training set) or dimensionality reduction (DR). DR methods map the original high-dimensional features in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which limits the potential for feature transparency or interpretability. Although methods exist for variable selection and ranking on embeddings obtained via linear DR schemes (e.g., principal components analysis (PCA)), similar methods do not yet exist for nonlinear DR (NLDR) methods. In this work we present a simple yet elegant method for approximating the mapping between the data in the original feature space and the transformed data in the kernel PCA (KPCA) embedding space; this mapping provides the basis for quantification of variable importance in nonlinear kernels (VINK). We show how VINK can be implemented in conjunction with the popular Isomap and Laplacian eigenmap algorithms. VINK is evaluated in the contexts of three different problems in digital pathology: (1) predicting five year PSA failure following radical prostatectomy, (2) predicting Oncotype DX recurrence risk scores for ER+ breast cancers, and (3) distinguishing good and poor outcome p16+ oropharyngeal tumors.

Methods:   Prospective data before and after NaF PET were collected from referring and interpreting physicians.

Results:   In adjusted analyses, we found that patients with high care density--indicating high levels of patient-sharing among their providers--had significantly lower rates of hospitalization (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75-1.00) and higher odds of an eye examination for diabetes (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.66) compared to patients with low care density. High care density was not associated with emergency department visits, avoidable outcomes, lipid profile following an angina diagnosis, or odds of glycosylated hemoglobin testing for diabetes. Patients with high care density had significantly lower total costs of care over 24 months (beta coefficient -$2,116, 95% CI -$3,107 to -$1,125) along with lower inpatient and outpatient costs.  Conclusion:   Cancer survivors treated by physicians who share more patients with one another tend to have some higher aspects of quality and lower cost care.  Implications of cancer survivors:   If validated, care density may be a useful indicator for monitoring care coordination among cancer survivors and potentially targeting interventions that seek to improve care delivery.""","""['Craig Evan Pollack', 'Kevin D Frick', 'Robert J Herbert', 'Amanda L Blackford', 'Bridget A Neville', 'Antonio C Wolff', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Craig C Earle', 'Claire F Snyder']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['Relationship Between Quality of Comorbid Condition Care and Costs for Cancer Survivors.', 'Patient sharing among physicians and costs of care: a network analytic approach to care coordination using claims data.', 'Comorbid condition care quality in cancer survivors: role of primary care and specialty providers and care coordination.', 'Survivorship care plan preferences of cancer survivors and health care providers: a systematic review and quality appraisal of the evidence.', 'Systematic reviews of the effectiveness of day care for people with severe mental disorders: (1) acute day hospital versus admission; (2) vocational rehabilitation; (3) day hospital versus outpatient care.', 'Patient Care Satisfaction and Emergency Room Utilization among Young Adult Colorectal Cancer Survivors during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Lessons Learned.', 'Realist Review of Care Models That Include Primary Care for Adult Childhood Cancer Survivors.', 'Association of Physician Referrals with Timely Cancer Care Using Tumor Registry and Claims Data.', 'Teaming up in primary care: Membership boundaries, interdependence, and coordination.', ""Providers' mediating role for medication adherence among cancer survivors.""]"""

Design:   A cross-sectional, retrospective program evaluation using a mixed-methods approach.  Setting:   An outpatient oncology rehabilitation program housed in an urban, hospital-based comprehensive cancer center in Alaska.  Sample:   102 cancer survivors who had completed a 10-week oncology rehabilitation program (mean time since completion was 2.5 years).  Methods:   Participants completed a mailed, 28-item retrospective survey to collect perceived activity level recalled at various points in time as well as program perceptions. Open-ended questions elicited narrative comments about motivators and barriers. The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) SF-36® was completed before and after the program.  Main research variables:   Health-related quality of life, perceived health status, activity level, motivators, barriers, and program perceptions.  Findings:   A small increase in level of activity from precancer to the current time (postrehabilitation) (z = -3.1, p < 0.01) was reported.

We investigated the tissue kinetics of a small molecule inhibitor of PSMA ((S)-2-(3-((S)-1-carboxy-5-(3-(4-[(124)I]iodophenyl)ureido)pentyl)ureido)pentanedioicacid; MIP-1095) using PET/CT to estimate radiation dosimetry for the potential therapeutic use of (131)I-MIP-1095 in men with mCRPC. We also report preliminary safety and efficacy of the first 28 consecutive patients treated under a compassionate-use protocol with a single cycle of (131)I-MIP-1095.  Methods:   Sixteen patients with known prostate cancer underwent PET/CT imaging after i.v. administration of (124)I-MIP-1095 (mean activity: 67.4 MBq). Each patient was scanned using PET/CT up to five times at 1, 4, 24, 48 and 72 h post injection. Volumes of interest were defined for tumor lesions and normal organs at each time point followed by dose calculations using the OLINDA/EXM software. Twenty-eight men with mCRPC were treated with a single cycle of (131)I-MIP-1095 (mean activity: 4.8 GBq, range 2 to 7.2 GBq) and followed for safety and efficacy. Baseline and follow up examinations included a complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, and measurement of serum PSA.  Results:   I-124-MIP-1095 PET/CT images showed excellent tumor uptake and moderate uptake in liver, proximal intestine and within a few hours post-injection also in the kidneys. High uptake values were observed only in salivary and lacrimal glands. Dosimetry estimates for I-131-MIP-1095 revealed that the highest absorbed doses were delivered to the salivary glands (3.8 mSv/MBq, liver (1.7 mSv/MBq) and kidneys (1.4 mSv/MBq). The absorbed dose calculated for the red marrow was 0.37 mSv/MBq. PSA values decreased by >50 % in 60.7 % of the men treated. Of men with bone pain, 84.6 % showed complete or moderate reduction in pain. Hematological toxicities were mild. Of men treated, 25 % had a transient slight to moderate dry mouth. No adverse effects on renal function were observed.  Conclusion:   Based on the biodistribution and dose calculations of the PSMA-targeted small molecule (124)I-MIP-1095 therapy with the authentic analog (131)I-MIP-1095 enables a targeted tumor therapy with unprecedented doses delivered to the tumor lesions.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that has been linked with prostate cancer pathogenesis by multiple studies. However, the direct functional roles of IL-6 in prostate cancer growth and progression have been unclear. In the present study, we show that IL-6 is produced in distant metastases of clinical prostate cancers. IL-6-activated signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells induced a robust 7-fold increase in metastases formation in nude mice. We further show that IL-6 promoted migratory prostate cancer cell phenotype, including increased prostate cancer cell migration, microtubule reorganization, and heterotypic adhesion of prostate cancer cells to endothelial cells. IL-6-driven metastasis was predominantly mediated by Stat3 and to lesser extent by ERK1/2. Most importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of Jak1/2 by AZD1480 suppressed IL-6-induced signaling, migratory prostate cancer cell phenotypes, and metastatic dissemination of prostate cancer in vivo in nude mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the cytokine IL-6 directly promotes prostate cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo via Jak-Stat3 signaling pathway, and that IL-6-driven metastasis can be effectively suppressed by pharmacologic targeting of Jak1/2 using Jak1/2 inhibitor AZD1480.

However, optimal screening strategies have not been determined to date and it is uncertain whether lighter smokers than those examined in the NLST may also benefit from screening. To address these questions, it is necessary to first develop LC natural history models that can reproduce NLST outcomes and simulate screening programs at the population level.  Methods:   Five independent LC screening models were developed using common inputs and calibration targets derived from the NLST and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Imputation of missing information regarding smoking, histology, and stage of disease for a small percentage of individuals and diagnosed LCs in both trials was performed. Models were calibrated to LC incidence, mortality, or both outcomes simultaneously.  Results:   Initially, all models were calibrated to the NLST and validated against PLCO. Models were found to validate well against individuals in PLCO who would have been eligible for the NLST. However, all models required further calibration to PLCO to adequately capture LC outcomes in PLCO never-smokers and light smokers. Final versions of all models produced incidence and mortality outcomes in the presence and absence of screening that were consistent with both trials.  Conclusions:   The authors developed 5 distinct LC screening simulation models based on the evidence in the NLST and PLCO. The results of their analyses demonstrated that the NLST and PLCO have produced consistent results.

We have demonstrated a low rate of biochemical relapses in a patient series with very low pre-SRT PSA levels after a median follow-up of 42 months. Here, we present an update of that study.  Patients and methods:   Overall, 151 patients were analyzed. A biochemical relapse after SRT was diagnosed when the PSA exceeded the post-SRT nadir by 0.2 ng/ml with subsequent increase. Parameters with significant impact on biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS), PCSS, and overall survival (OS) in univariate analysis were included in a multiple Cox regression analysis.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 82 months, 18 patients (12%) had died with 10 (6.6%) deaths being PC-related. A biochemical progression was diagnosed in 83 patients (55%). Univariate analysis revealed a significant impact of pre-SRT PSA level, Gleason score, and PSA doubling time (PSADT) on BPFS and for initial tumor stage and Gleason score on OS. Multivariate analysis confirmed the impact of pre-SRT PSA level, Gleason score, and PSADT on BPFS and tumor stage on OS.  Conclusion:   In this update, the rate of biochemical relapses increased compared with our previous data. Compared to similar studies, we found a remarkably low rate of PC-related deaths. Our data support early initiation of SRT.

This prospective study evaluated the impact of the CCP report on physician treatment recommendations for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Physicians ordering the CCP test in clinical practice completed surveys regarding treatment recommendations before and after they received and discussed the test results with patients. Clinicians also rated the influence of the test result on treatment decisions. Treatment selections were confirmed via third-party audit of patient charts following final survey responses.  Results:   Overall, 65% of cases showed a change between intended treatment pre- and post-CCP test reporting. Pre-CCP testing, 164 of 305 cases received a recommendation for interventional treatment. Post-CCP test, interventional therapy was recommended for 103 of these cases, a reduction of 37.2%. Conversely, 141 of 305 cases were recommended pre-CCP testing for non-interventional treatment; 108 of these remained with non-interventional treatment while 33 shifted to interventional options, a 23.4% increase. There was a 49.5% reduction in surgical interventions and a 29.6% reduction in radiation treatment. A third-party audit identified 80.2% concordance between the post-CCP testing treatment recommendation and actual treatment. Re-assignment to intervention or non-intervention generally correlated with the result of the CCP report. Study limitations included physician selection of patients for testing, no evaluation of patient input in therapeutic choice, and other potential treatment decision factors not queried by the survey.  Conclusion:   Based on responses of ordering physicians, the CCP report adds meaningful new information to risk assessment for localized prostate cancer patients. Test results led to changes in treatment with reductions and increases in interventional treatment that were directionally aligned with prostate cancer risk specified by the test.""","""['E David Crawford', 'Mark C Scholz', 'Ashok J Kar', 'Jeffrey E Fegan', 'Abebe Haregewoin', 'Rajesh R Kaldate', 'Michael K Brawer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Curr Med Res Opin""","""['Prolaris Cell Cycle Progression Test for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Clinical utility of a biopsy-based cell cycle gene expression assay in localized prostate cancer.', 'Impact of the Cell Cycle Progression Test on Physician and Patient Treatment Selection for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic Value of the Cell Cycle Progression Score in Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Prognostic value of a cell-cycle progression score in men with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance after MRI-guided prostate biopsy--a pilot study.', 'NetRank Recovers Known Cancer Hallmark Genes as Universal Biomarker Signature for Cancer Outcome Prediction.', 'Biomarkers for prostate cancer detection and risk stratification.', 'Biomarkers for Predicting Abiraterone Treatment Outcome and Selecting Alternative Therapies in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.', 'Clinical proteomics for prostate cancer: understanding prostate cancer pathology and protein biomarkers for improved disease management.']"""

Our study sought to determine whether dogs could be trained to discriminate the odour of urine from men with prostate cancer from controls, using rigorous testing procedures and well-defined samples from a major research hospital.  Methods:   We attempted to train ten dogs by initially rewarding them for finding and indicating individual prostate cancer urine samples (Stage 1). If dogs were successful in Stage 1, we then attempted to train them to discriminate prostate cancer samples from controls (Stage 2). The number of samples used to train each dog varied depending on their individual progress. Overall, 50 unique prostate cancer and 67 controls were collected and used during training. Dogs that passed Stage 2 were tested for their ability to discriminate 15 (Test 1) or 16 (Tests 2 and 3) unfamiliar prostate cancer samples from 45 (Test 1) or 48 (Tests 2 and 3) unfamiliar controls under double-blind conditions.  Results:   Three dogs reached training Stage 2 and two of these learnt to discriminate potentially familiar prostate cancer samples from controls. However, during double-blind tests using new samples the two dogs did not indicate prostate cancer samples more frequently than expected by chance (Dog A sensitivity 0.13, specificity 0.71, Dog B sensitivity 0.25, specificity 0.75). The other dogs did not progress past Stage 1 as they did not have optimal temperaments for the sensitive odour discrimination training.  Conclusions:   Although two dogs appeared to have learnt to select prostate cancer samples during training, they did not generalise on a prostate cancer odour during robust double-blind tests involving new samples. Our study illustrates that these rigorous tests are vital to avoid drawing misleading conclusions about the abilities of dogs to indicate certain odours. Dogs may memorise the individual odours of large numbers of training samples rather than generalise on a common odour. The results do not exclude the possibility that dogs could be trained to detect prostate cancer. We recommend that canine olfactory memory is carefully considered in all future studies and rigorous double-blind methods used to avoid confounding effects.""","""['Kevin R Elliker', 'Barbara A Sommerville', 'Donald M Broom', 'David E Neal', 'Sarah Armstrong', 'Hywel C Williams']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""[""Prostate cancer: eNose--man's new best friend?"", ""Prostate cancer: eNose--man's new best friend?"", 'Olfactory detection of prostate cancer by dogs sniffing urine: a step forward in early diagnosis.', 'Study of the art: canine olfaction used for cancer detection on the basis of breath odour.

However, the biochemical pathways of doxazosin action is still unclear. Aforementioned drugs should lead to decrease of prostate volume, although this effect was never observed in patients suffering from BPH after treatment with α1-antagonists. Probably, it is connected with cancer stem cells' resistance on chemotherapeutic agents. The aim of this study was to compare incidence of apoptosis induced by doxazosin in progenitor and differentiated cells isolated from human prostate epithelium.  Material and methods:   For this purpose tissue specimens were obtained from 10 patients suffering from BPH, the primary cultures of prostate epithelium were established and CD133 MicroBeads sorting was prepared. Both, CD133(+)/CD133(-) co-cultures and CD133(+) cells were incubated with different concentration of doxazosin for 12 h. Cell viability and apoptosis was estimated with Annexin V-FITC.  Results:   12 h incubation of CD133(+)/CD133(-) co-cultures with doxazosin resulted in increase of apoptotic cells, while in CD133(+) cultures no changes were observed. Correlation between apoptotic cell number and doxazosin concentration in CD133(+)/ CD133(-) co-cultures group was high (R = 0.99).  Conclusion:   Doxazosin induced apoptosis in co-cultures of progenitor and differentiated epithelial cells.

Material and methods:   The investigation was performed in 20 paraffin-embedded needle biopsy specimens from routine diagnostic prostate cancer biopsies. The specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunostained with anti-AT1 and anti-AT2 antibodies. For visualization of primary antibodies, the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase technique was applied. The expression of both receptor proteins was evaluated quantitatively using image analysis method.  Results:   The positive immunostaining with both anti- AT1 and anti-AT2 antibodies can be found in stromal as well as epithelial structures. The results of quantitative evaluation showed the positive correlation between AT1 and AT2 expressions in neoplastic epithelium and overexpression of both AT1 and AT2 in neoplastic epithelium of Gleason grade 2, but not in cancerous structures of Gleason grades 3-5.  Conclusions:   The data on AT1 and AT2 receptor expressions may suggest the involvement of RAS in prostate cancerogenesis.

Whereas high doses of radiation (>10 Gy) can lead to lymphopenia, lower radiation doses (2-4 Gy) represent a valid treatment option in some hematological cancers, triggering clinically relevant immunological changes. Based on our earlier observations, we hypothesized that lower radiation doses have a direct positive effect on T cells. In this study, we show that 0.6-2.4 Gy radiation enhances proliferation and IFN-γ production of PBMC or purified T cells induced by stimulation via the TCR. Radiation with 1.2 Gy also lowered T cell activation threshold and broadened the Th1 cytokine profile. Although radiation alone did not activate T cells, when followed by TCR stimulation, ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation increased above that induced by stimulation alone. These changes were followed by an early increase in glucose uptake. Naive (CD45RA(+)) or memory (CD45RA(-)) T cell responses to stimulation were boosted at similar rates by radiation. Whereas increased Ag-specific cytotoxic activity of a CD8(+) T cell line manifested in a 4-h assay (10-20% increase), highly significant (5- to 10-fold) differences in cytokine production were detected in 6-d Ag-stimulation assays of PBMC, probably as a net outcome of death of nonstimulated and enhanced response of Ag-stimulated T cells. T cells from patients receiving pelvic radiation (2.2-2.75 Gy) also displayed increased cytokine production when stimulated in vitro.

Here we describe a cross-talk between phosphatases that may preserve levels of activated/phosphorylated Akt and confer aggressive growth of cancer cells. In prostatic cancer cells, but not in non-transformed cells or in prostate stem cells, we found that the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) overexpression down-regulated PH domain and leucine-rich repeat phosphatase (PHLPP) and that PHLPP overexpression down-regulated PTEN. We also show that silencing PTEN by siRNA increased the levels of PHLPPs. This cross-talk facilitated invasive migration and was mediated by epigenetic alterations, including activation of miR-190, miR-214, polycomb group of proteins, as well as DNA methylation. A role for the purinergic receptor P2X4, previously associated with wound healing, was indicated. We also show that TGF-β1 induced cross-talk concomitant with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in stem cells. The cross-talk emerged as an integrated part of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

The efficacy and feasibility of HTT in terms of acute toxicity were assessed.  Methods:   We enrolled 83 PCa patients (mean age 68 years, range 51 - 82 years) with biochemical recurrence after radical primary treatment (mean serum PSA 7.61 ng/ml, range 0.37 - 187.00 ng/ml; PSA0) who showed pathological findings on (11)C-choline PET/CT only at the LN site. (11)C-Choline PET/CT was performed for restaging and then for radiation treatment planning (PET/CT0). Of the 83 patients, 8 experienced further LN relapse, of whom 5 were retreated once and 3 were retreated twice (total 94 radiotherapy treatments). All pelvic and/or abdominal LNs positive on PET/CT0 were treated with high doses using SIB. Doses were in the range 36 - 74 Gy administered in 28 fractions. After the end of HTT (mean 83 days, range 16 - 365 days), serum PSA was measured in all patients (PSA1) and compared with PSA0 to evaluate early biochemical response. In 47 patients PET/CT was repeated (PET/CT1) to assess metabolic responses at the treated areas. Toxicity criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) were used to assess acute toxicity.  Results:   PET/CT0 revealed pathological LNs in the pelvis in 49 patients, pathological LNs in the abdomen in 15 patients pathological LNs in both the pelvis and abdomen in 18 patients, and pathological LNs in the pelvis or abdomen and other sites in 12 patients. All these sites were treated with HTT. With respect to PSA0, PSA1 (mean 6.28 ng/ml, range 0.00 - 220.46 ng/ml) showed a complete biochemical response after 66 of the 94 HTT treatments, a partial response after 12 treatments, stable disease after 1 treatment and progression of disease after 15 treatments.

Pro-apoptotic nCLU and anti-apoptotic sCLU have opposite effects and are differentially expressed in normal and cancer cells; however, their regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional level are not yet known. Here, we examined the transcriptional regulation of nCLU in response to hypoxia. We identified three putative hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the human CLU promoter between positions -806 and +51 bp. Using a luciferase reporter, electrophoretic gel mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we further showed that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) bound directly to these sites and activated transcription. Exposure to the hypoxiamimetic compound CoCl₂, incubation under 1% O₂ conditions, or overexpression of HIF-1α enhanced nCLU expression and induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer PC3M cells. However, LNCaP prostate cancer cells were resistant to hypoxia-induced cell death. Methylation-specific PCR analysis revealed that the CLU promoter in PC3M cells was not methylated; in contrast, the CLU promoter in LNCap cells was methylated.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have suggested that some genetic susceptibility variants are associated with multiple complex traits (pleiotropy).  Objective:   We investigated whether common risk variants identified in cancer GWAS may also increase the risk of developing NHL as the first primary cancer.  Methods:   As part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) consortium, 113 cancer risk variants were analyzed in 1,441 NHL cases and 24,183 controls from three studies (BioVU, Multiethnic Cohort Study, Women's Health Initiative) for their association with the risk of overall NHL and common subtypes [diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)] using an additive genetic model adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity. Study-specific results for each variant were meta-analyzed across studies.  Results:   The analysis of NHL subtype-specific GWAS SNPs and overall NHL suggested a shared genetic susceptibility between FL and DLBCL, particularly involving variants in the major histocompatibility complex region (rs6457327 in 6p21.33: FL OR=1.29, p=0.013; DLBCL OR=1.23, p=0.013; NHL OR=1.22, p=5.9 × E-05). In the pleiotropy analysis, six risk variants for other cancers were associated with NHL risk, including variants for lung (rs401681 in TERT: OR per C allele=0.89, p=3.7 × E-03; rs4975616 in TERT: OR per A allele=0.90, p=0.01; rs3131379 in MSH5: OR per T allele=1.16, p=0.03), prostate (rs7679673 in TET2: OR per C allele=0.89, p=5.7 × E-03; rs10993994 in MSMB: OR per T allele=1.09, p=0.04), and breast (rs3817198 in LSP1: OR per C allele=1.12, p=0.01) cancers, but none of these associations remained significant after multiple test correction.

In this particular study, a rosemary extract standardized to carnosic acid was evaluated for its potential in disrupting the endoplasmic reticulum machinery to decrease the viability of prostate cancer cells and promote degradation of the androgen receptor. Two human prostate cancer cell lines, 22Rv1 and LNCaP, and prostate epithelial cells procured from two different patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were treated with standardized rosemary extract and evaluated by flow cytometry, MTT, BrdU, Western blot and fluorescent microscopy. A significant modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins was observed in cancer cells while normal prostate epithelial cells did not undergo endoplasmic reticulum stress. This biphasic response suggests that standardized rosemary extract may preferentially target cancer cells as opposed to ""normal"" cells. Furthermore, we observed standardized rosemary extract to decrease androgen receptor expression that appears to be regulated by the expression of CHOP/GADD153. Using a xenograft tumor model we observed standardized rosemary extract when given orally to significantly suppress tumor growth by 46% compared to mice not receiving standardized rosemary extract. In the last several years regulatory governing bodies (e.g. European Union) have approved standardized rosemary extracts as food preservatives. These results are especially significant as it is becoming more likely that individuals will be receiving standardized rosemary extracts that are a part of a natural preservative system in various food preparations. Taken a step further, it is possible that the potential benefits that are often associated with a ""Mediterranean Diet"" in the future may begin to extend beyond the Mediterranean diet as more of the population is consuming standardized rosemary extracts.""","""['Sakina M Petiwala', 'Saba Berhe', 'Gongbo Li', 'Angela G Puthenveetil', 'Ozair Rahman', 'Larisa Nonn', 'Jeremy J Johnson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Selective modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers in prostate cancer cells by a standardized mangosteen fruit extract.', 'Carnosic acid promotes degradation of the androgen receptor and is regulated by the unfolded protein response pathway in vitro and in vivo.', 'Anticancer Effects of Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.)

Patients and methods:   In 55 patients who had undergone MRI-guided biopsy of the prostate, we retrospectively matched every biopsy core with the corresponding lesion in previously acquired endorectal multiparametric MRI including T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) at 1.5 T. Two readers blinded to the results of the biopsy evaluated each biopsied lesion according to the PI-RADS scoring system. The results of the targeted biopsy were used as a reference standard. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed for statistical analysis.  Results:   A total of 113 lesions in the 55 patients were evaluated; 30 lesions were malignant. When evaluated according to the criteria of the PI-RADS scoring system, DCE-MRI revealed a lower area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.76) compared with T2WI (0.88; P=0.06) and DWI (0.93; P=0.004). A sum score combining T2WI, DWI, and DCE-MRI yielded an AUC of 0.93, whereas a sum score combining only T2WI and DWI yielded an AUC of 0.95. In central gland lesions, T2WI showed a numerically higher AUC compared with DWI (0.98 and 0.95), whereas, in peripheral zone lesions, DWI was superior (AUC of 0.93 and 0.73; P=0.04). An approach assigning a PI-RADS score for T2WI to central gland lesions and for DWI to peripheral zone lesions yielded an AUC of 0.96 and was numerically superior compared with any sequence alone and sum scores combining T2WI and DWI as well as T2WI, DWI, and DCE-MRI.  Conclusions:   The PI-RADS scoring system shows a good diagnostic performance for the detection of prostate cancer when using a sum score. However, DCE-MRI does not seem to add significant value when evaluated according to the recommended criteria. Assigning a score for T2WI to central gland lesions and for DWI to peripheral zone lesions might be sufficient for stratification of patients for further diagnostic workup.""","""['Alexander D J Baur', 'Andreas Maxeiner', 'Tobias Franiel', 'Ergin Kilic', 'Alexander Huppertz', 'Carsten Schwenke', 'Bernd Hamm', 'Tahir Durmus']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['MR-sequences for prostate cancer diagnostics: validation based on the PI-RADS scoring system and targeted MR-guided in-bore biopsy.', 'Usefulness of prebiopsy multifunctional and morphologic MRI combined with free-to-total prostate-specific antigen ratio in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Peripheral zone prostate cancer localization by multiparametric magnetic resonance at 3 T: unbiased cancer identification by matching to histopathology.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Use of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) for Prostate Cancer Detection with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Diagnostic Meta-analysis.', 'A narrative review of biparametric MRI (bpMRI) implementation on screening, detection, and the overall accuracy for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer in PI-RADS scores 1 and 2 version 2.1: a comparison to previous PI-RADS versions.', 'Is dynamic contrast enhancement still necessary in multiparametric magnetic resonance for diagnosis of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Cancer Detection Rates of Systematic and Targeted Prostate Biopsies after Biparametric MRI.', 'Effect of Echo Times on Prostate Cancer Detection on T2-Weighted Images.']"""

We evaluated feasibility, safety and activity of a neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy (NCHT) with 3-weekly full dose docetaxel and complete androgen blockade (CAB) in locally advanced and high-risk prostate cancer patients (LAPC) undergoing RP.  Methods:   Patients (n = 30) were selected by Kattans' preoperative score and received trimestral buserelin 9,45 mg, bicalutamide 50 mg/day and 3 cycles docetaxel (75 mg/m²) followed by RP. Primary endpoints were biochemical (PSA) and local downstaging. Secondary endpoints included toxicity and operability assessments, pathological complete response (pCR), time to PSA progression, 5-year biochemical recurrence free survival (bRFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Median baseline PSA was 25.8 ng/ml (2.1-293), and the predicted probability of 5-year bRFS was 10% (0-55). NCHT induced PSA-reduction was 97.3% (81.3-99.9%; p < 0.001) and post-RP 96.7% of patients were therapy responders, with undetectable PSA-values. Post- vs. pretreatment MRI indicated a median tumor volume reduction of 46.4% (-31.3-82.8; p < 0.001). A pathological downstaging was observed in 48.3%. Severe hematologic toxicities (≥CTC3) were frequent with 53.8% leucopenia, 90% neutropenia and 13.3% febrile neutropenia. RP was performed in all patients. While resectability was hindered in 26.7%, continence was achieved in 96.7%. Pathologic analyses revealed no pCR. Lymph node- and extracapsular involvement was observed in 36.7% and 56.7% with 33.3% positive surgical margins. After a median of 48.6 (19.9-87.8) months, 55.2% of therapy responders experienced PSA-recurrence. The estimated median time to PSA-progression was 38.6 months (95%CI 30.9-46.4) and 85.3 months (95%CI 39.3-131.3) for OS. The 5-year bRFS was improved to 40%, but limiting for interpretation adjuvant treatment was individualized.

Monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 can drive such adaptation permitting the transport across plasma membrane of different monocarboxylic acids involved in energy metabolism.  Methods:   Role of MCTs in tumor-stroma metabolic relationship was investigated in vitro and in vivo using transformed prostate epithelial cells, carcinoma cell lines and normal fibroblasts. Moreover prostate tissues from carcinoma and benign hypertrophy cases were analyzed for individuating clinical-pathological implications of MCT1 and MCT4 expression.  Results:   Transformed prostate epithelial (TPE) and prostate cancer (PCa) cells express both MCT1 and MCT4 and demonstrated variable dependence on aerobic glycolysis for maintaining their proliferative rate. In glucose-restriction the presence of L-lactate determined, after 24 h of treatment, in PCa cells the up-regulation of MCT1 and of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1), and reduced the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase respect to untreated cells. The blockade of MCT1 function, performed by si RNA silencing, determined an appreciable antiproliferative effect when L-lactate was utilized as energetic fuel. Accordingly L-lactate released by high glycolytic human diploid fibroblasts WI-38 sustained survival and growth of TPE and PCa cells in low glucose culture medium. In parallel, the treatment with conditioned medium from PCa cells was sufficient to induce glycolytic metabolism in WI-38 cells, with upregulation of HIF-1a and MCT4. Co-injection of PCa cells with high glycolytic WI-38 fibroblasts determined an impressive increase in tumor growth rate in a xenograft model that was abrogated by MCT1 silencing in PCa cells. The possible interplay based on L-lactate shuttle between tumor and stroma was confirmed also in human PCa tissue where we observed a positive correlation between stromal MCT4 and tumor MCT1 expression.  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrated that PCa progression may benefit of MCT1 expression in tumor cells and of MCT4 in tumor-associated stromal cells. Therefore, MCTs may result promising therapeutic targets in different phases of neoplastic transformation according to a strategy aimed to contrast the energy metabolic adaptation of PCa cells to stressful environments.""","""['Patrizia Sanità', 'Mattia Capulli', 'Anna Teti', 'Giuseppe Paradiso Galatioto', 'Carlo Vicentini', 'Paola Chiarugi', 'Mauro Bologna', 'Adriano Angelucci']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Targeting lactate production and efflux in prostate cancer.', 'CD147 subunit of lactate/H+ symporters MCT1 and hypoxia-inducible MCT4 is critical for energetics and growth of glycolytic tumors.', 'Organized metabolic crime in prostate cancer: The coexpression of MCT1 in tumor and MCT4 in stroma is an independent prognosticator for biochemical failure.', 'The expression of lactate transporters (MCT1 and MCT4) in heart and muscle.', 'Lactate shuttle: from substance exchange to regulatory mechanism.', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'Metabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer contributes to the intratumor heterogeneity of PET-CT.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Lactate: The Mediator of Metabolism and Immunosuppression.']"""

Methods:   Between 1989 and 1999, we randomly assigned 695 men with early prostate cancer to watchful waiting or radical prostatectomy and followed them through the end of 2012. The primary end points in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4 (SPCG-4) were death from any cause, death from prostate cancer, and the risk of metastases. Secondary end points included the initiation of androgen-deprivation therapy.  Results:   During 23.2 years of follow-up, 200 of 347 men in the surgery group and 247 of the 348 men in the watchful-waiting group died. Of the deaths, 63 in the surgery group and 99 in the watchful-waiting group were due to prostate cancer; the relative risk was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.77; P=0.001), and the absolute difference was 11.0 percentage points (95% CI, 4.5 to 17.5). The number needed to treat to prevent one death was 8. One man died after surgery in the radical-prostatectomy group. Androgen-deprivation therapy was used in fewer patients who underwent prostatectomy (a difference of 25.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 17.7 to 32.3). The benefit of surgery with respect to death from prostate cancer was largest in men younger than 65 years of age (relative risk, 0.45) and in those with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (relative risk, 0.38). However, radical prostatectomy was associated with a reduced risk of metastases among older men (relative risk, 0.68; P=0.04).  Conclusions:   Extended follow-up confirmed a substantial reduction in mortality after radical prostatectomy; the number needed to treat to prevent one death continued to decrease when the treatment was modified according to age at diagnosis and tumor risk.

Interfraction bladder volume variation was also determined.  Methods:   BS-V was recorded before and after planning CT or CBCT. The percentage differences between the readings using the two imaging modalities, standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals were determined. Data were analysed for the whole patient cohort and separately for the older BladderScan™ BVI3000 and newer BVI9400 model. Interfraction bladder volume variation was determined from the percentage difference between the CT-V and CBCT-V. Treatment duration, incorporating the time needed for BS and CBCT, was recorded.  Results:   Fourteen patients were enrolled, producing 133 data sets for analysis. BS-V was taken using the BVI9400 in four patients (43 data sets). The mean BS-V was 253.2 mL, and the mean CT-V or CBCT-V was 199 cm(3). The mean percentage difference between the two modalities was 19.7% (SD 42.2; 95%CI 12.4 to 26.9). The BVI9400 model produced more consistent readings, with a mean percentage difference of -6.2% (SD 27.8; 95% CI -14.7 to -2.4%). The mean percentage difference between CT-V and CBCT-V was 31.3% (range -48% to 199.4%). Treatment duration from time of first BS reading to CBCT was, on average, 12 min (range 6-27).  Conclusions:   The BS produces bladder volume readings of an average 19.7% difference from CT-V or CBCT-V and can potentially be used to screen for large interfraction bladder volume variations in radiotherapy to prostatic bed. The observed interfraction bladder volume variation suggests the need to improve bladder volume consistency. Incorporating the BS into practice is feasible.""","""['K A Ung', 'R White', 'M Mathlum', 'V Mak-Hau', 'R Lynch']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Interfractional variation in bladder volume and its impact on cervical cancer radiotherapy: Clinical significance of portable bladder scanner.', 'Anatomic variations due to radical prostatectomy.

Agents targeting the Eph-ephrin system might emerge as new tools useful for the inhibition of different components of cancer progression. Even if different classes of small molecules targeting Eph-ephrin interactions have been reported, their use is hampered by poor chemical stability and low potency. Stable and potent ligands are crucial to achieve robust pharmacological performance.  Experimental approach:   UniPR129 (the L-homo-Trp conjugate of lithocholic acid) was designed by means of computational methods, synthetized and tested for its ability to inhibit the interaction between the EphA2 receptor and the ephrin-A1 ligand in an elisa binding study. The ability of UniPR129 to disrupt EphA2-ephrin-A1 interaction was functionally evaluated in a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line and its anti-angiogenic effect was tested in vitro using cultures of HUVECs.  Key results:   UniPR129 disrupted EphA2-ephrin-A1 interaction with Ki = 370 nM in an elisa binding assay and with low micromolar potency in cellular functional assays, including inhibition of EphA2 activation, inhibition of PC3 cell rounding and disruption of in vitro angiogenesis, without cytotoxic effects.  Conclusions and implications:   The discovery of UniPR129 represents not only a major advance in potency compared with the existing Eph-ephrin antagonists but also an improvement in terms of cytotoxicity, making this molecule a useful pharmacological tool and a promising lead compound.""","""['I Hassan-Mohamed', 'C Giorgio', 'M Incerti', 'S Russo', 'D Pala', 'E B Pasquale', 'I Zanotti', 'P Vicini', 'E Barocelli', 'S Rivara', 'M Mor', 'A Lodola', 'M Tognolini']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Pharmacol""","""['Pharmacological evaluation of new bioavailable small molecules targeting Eph/ephrin interaction.', 'Lithocholic acid is an Eph-ephrin ligand interfering with Eph-kinase activation.', 'Structure-activity relationships and mechanism of action of Eph-ephrin antagonists: interaction of cholanic acid with the EphA2 receptor.', 'The EphA2 receptor and ephrinA1 ligand in solid tumors: function and therapeutic targeting.', 'The Functions of EphA1 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase in Several Tumors.', 'Optimization of the Lead Compound NVP-BHG712 as a Colorectal Cancer Inhibitor.', 'Targefrin: A Potent Agent Targeting the Ligand Binding Domain of EphA2.', 'Hunting for Novel Routes in Anticancer Drug Discovery: Peptides against Sam-Sam Interactions.', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitors Targeting the Eph-Ephrin System with a Focus on Amino Acid Conjugates of Bile Acids.', 'Identification of a Quinone Derivative as a YAP/TEAD Activity Modulator from a Repurposing Library.']"""

Nevertheless, an increase by 1% yearly has been recorded in the last three years, thereby making early diagnosis of prostate cancer crucial for controlling its incidence. Differentiating between benign and malignant lesions has been a diagnostic dilemma, especially in prostate pathology. This is compounded by unavailability of modern tests in certain regions of developing nations.  Methods:   A cohort of one hundred seventy six prostatomegaly patients used in the current study was obtained both retrospectively and prospectively at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi, Wardha, Maharashtra, India. Details of the patients were recorded which included their age. The samples were then cut into 5 sections, each of 5micron thickness. One section was preserved and the other 4 sections were subjected to Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E), Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS), Alcian Blue and AgNOR stains. Degree of differentiation was estimated and correlated with the Gleason score and the outcome of the stainings.  Results:   Majority of benign prostatic hyperplasia and all primary carcinoma patients were in their sixth to eighth decade of life. While all the benign lesions were negative, 6 out of 9 primary prostate carcinomas were positive for Alcian Blue stain. Majority of both benign and malignant lesions were positive for Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) stain. In terms of Argyrophilic Nucleolar Organiser Region (AgNOR) count per nucleus, the value in benign lesions was observed to be half the count observed in malignant lesions per nucleus.  Conclusion:   Although the potential use of the orthodox stains individually may not serve the purpose to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions, together they may have the potential to identify relatively more malignant cases. This may be helpful especially in low socio-economic countries and rural areas where molecular based tests may not yet be available.""","""['Anchit Khanna', 'Rani Patil', 'Abhay Deshmukh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Diagn Res""","""['Argyrophilic nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) in breast lesions.', 'Nucleolar organizer regions (NOR) in hyperplastic and neoplastic prostate disease.', 'Role of cyclin D1 immunoreactivity and AgNOR staining in the evaluation of benign and malignant lesions of the prostate.', 'Significance of mucin stain in differentiating benign and malignant lesions of prostate.', 'Hyalinization as a histomorphological risk predictor in oral pathological lesions.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the prostate: intraindividual comparison of gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol.', 'CIP2A is a candidate therapeutic target in clinically challenging prostate cancer cell populations.']"""

Objective:   To describe the experiences and attitudes of primary care providers within the Alaska Tribal Health System (ATHS) regarding the care of prostate cancer survivors.  Design:   In late October 2011, we emailed a 22-item electronic survey to 268 ATHS primary care providers regarding the frequency of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) monitoring for a hypothetical prostate cancer survivor; who should be responsible for the patient's life-long prostate cancer surveillance; who should support the patient's emotional and medical needs as a survivor; and providers' level of comfort addressing recurrence monitoring, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, androgen deprivation therapy, and emotional needs. We used simple logistic regression to examine the association between provider characteristics and their responses to the survivorship survey items.  Results:   Of 221 individuals who were successfully contacted, a total of 114 responded (52% response rate). Most ATHS providers indicated they would order a PSA test every 12 months (69%) and believed that, ideally, the hypothetical patient's primary care provider should be responsible for his life-long prostate cancer surveillance (60%). Most providers reported feeling either ""moderately"" or ""very"" comfortable addressing topics such as prostate cancer recurrence (59%), erectile dysfunction (64%), urinary incontinence (63%), and emotional needs (61%) with prostate cancer survivors. These results varied somewhat by provider characteristics including female sex, years in practice, and the number of prostate cancer survivors seen in their practice.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that most primary care providers in Alaska are poised to assume the care of prostate cancer survivors locally. However, we also found that large minorities of providers do not feel confident in their ability to manage common issues in prostate cancer survivorship, implying that continued access to specialists with more expert knowledge would be beneficial.""","""['Jon C Tilburt', 'Stacy Kelley', 'Christine A DeCourtney', 'Katherine M Humeniuk', 'Jerilyn Latini', 'Simon P Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Circumpolar Health""","""['Behavioral health aides in rural Alaska: their experience in caring for Alaska Native cancer survivors.', 'Evaluating long-term patient-centered outcomes following prostate cancer treatment: findings from the Michigan Prostate Cancer Survivor study.', 'Primary care perspectives on prostate cancer survivorship: implications for improving quality of care.', 'Survivorship: adult cancer survivors.', 'Primary Care of the Prostate Cancer Survivor.', 'Anxiety-Related Issues in Cancer Survivorship.', 'Cancer survivorship services for indigenous peoples: where we stand, where to improve?

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of serum levels of PSA and free PSA (fPSA) with prognosis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), extent of CAD and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute coronary syndromes.  Materials and methods:   Sixty-seven male patients who were diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes were included. All patients were assessed according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) classification [ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST elevation (NSTE)-ACS groups, separately], the Global Registry of Acute Cardiac Events (GRACE) (difference between PSA and fPSA) risk score and the Killip classification. All patients underwent angiography. The degree of stenosis was scored using the Gensini score to assess the extent of CAD.  Results:   Serum PSA, fPSA, fPSA/PSA levels, and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin-PSA (ACT-PSA) (difference between PSA and fPSA) results were found to be moderately correlated with the TIMI and GRACE risk scores, which are predictors of short- and mid-term prognosis.

There were no significant differences between patients with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and those without MACEs at the 6-month follow-up in terms of PSA, fPSA, fPSA/PSA, and ACT-PSA results.  Conclusion:   There may be a relationship between serum PSA and fPSA levels and prognosis of ACS and extent of CAD. It should be kept in mind that additional biomarkers could be used together with current scoring systems in risk classification in cases for which clinical decision-making is challenging.

The omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA) and lipophilic statins affect metastasis-like behaviour in CaP cells, regulating the critical metastatic step of CaP migration to the bone marrow stroma.  Methods:   Microscopic analysis and measurement of adhesion and invasion of CaP cells through bone marrow endothelial cells (BMEC) was undertaken with AA stimulation and/or simvastatin (SIM) treatment. Amoeboid characteristics of PC-3, PC3-GFP and DU-145 were analysed by western blotting and Rho assays.  Results:   The CaP cell lines PC-3, PC3-GFP and DU-145 share the ability to migrate across a BMEC layer. Specific amoeboid inhibition decreased transendothelial migration (TEM). AA stimulates amoeboid characteristics, driven by Rho signalling. Selective knock-down of components of the Rho pathway (RhoA, RhoC, Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) and ROCK2) showed that Rho signalling is crucial to TEM. Functions of these components were analysed, regarding adhesion to BMEC, migration in 2D and the induction of the amoeboid phenotype by AA. TEM was reduced by SIM treatment of PC3-GFP and DU-145, which inhibited Rho pathway signalling.  Conclusions:   AA-induced TEM is mediated by the induction of a Rho-driven amoeboid phenotype.

Animal studies found that BPA contributes to development of prostate cancer, but human data are scarce. Our study examined the association between urinary BPA levels and Prostate cancer and assessed the effects of BPA on induction of centrosome abnormalities as an underlying mechanism promoting prostate carcinogenesis. The study, involving 60 urology patients, found higher levels of urinary BPA (creatinine-adjusted) in Prostate cancer patients (5.74 µg/g [95% CI; 2.63, 12.51]) than in non-Prostate cancer patients (1.43 µg/g [95% CI; 0.70, 2.88]) (p = 0.012). The difference was even more significant in patients <65 years old. A trend toward a negative association between urinary BPA and serum PSA was observed in Prostate cancer patients but not in non-Prostate cancer patients. In vitro studies examined centrosomal abnormalities, microtubule nucleation, and anchorage-independent growth in four Prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2, 22Rv1, PC-3) and two immortalized normal prostate epithelial cell lines (NPrEC and RWPE-1). Exposure to low doses (0.01-100 nM) of BPA increased the percentage of cells with centrosome amplification two- to eight-fold. Dose responses either peaked or reached the plateaus with 0.1 nM BPA exposure. This low dose also promoted microtubule nucleation and regrowth at centrosomes in RWPE-1 and enhanced anchorage-independent growth in C4-2. These findings suggest that urinary BPA level is an independent prognostic marker in Prostate cancer and that BPA exposure may lower serum PSA levels in Prostate cancer patients. Moreover, disruption of the centrosome duplication cycle by low-dose BPA may contribute to neoplastic transformation of the prostate.""","""['Pheruza Tarapore', 'Jun Ying', 'Bin Ouyang', 'Barbara Burke', 'Bruce Bracken', 'Shuk-Mei Ho']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Bisphenol A and its analogues disrupt centrosome cycle and microtubule dynamics in prostate cancer.', 'Bisphenol A Disrupts HNF4α-Regulated Gene Networks Linking to Prostate Preneoplasia and Immune Disruption in Noble Rats.', 'Bisphenol A promotes human prostate stem-progenitor cell self-renewal and increases in vivo carcinogenesis in human prostate epithelium.', 'Evidence that bisphenol A (BPA) can be accurately measured without contamination in human serum and urine, and that BPA causes numerous hazards from multiple routes of exposure.', 'A review of the carcinogenic potential of bisphenol A.', 'Re-evaluation of the risks to public health related to the presence of bisphenol A (BPA) in foodstuffs.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Mechanisms of BPA Degradation and Toxicity Resistance in Rhodococcus equi.', 'Effects of perinatal exposure to bisphenol A on induction of prostate cancer in Sprague Dawley rats by MNU and testosterone.', 'GPER1 links estrogens to centrosome amplification and chromosomal instability in human colon cells.']"""

In articulated registration (ART), whole-body skeletons are registered by auto-segmenting individual bones, then rigidly aligning them. Performance and robustness of the ART in lesion matching were evaluated and compared to other commonly used registration techniques. Sixteen prostate cancer patients were treated either with molecular targeted therapy or chemotherapy. Ten out of the 16 patients underwent the double baseline whole-body [F-18]NaF PET/CT scans for test-retest (TRT) evaluation. Twelve of the 16 patients underwent pre- and mid-treatment [F-18]NaF PET/CT scans. Skeletons at different time points were registered using ART, rigid, and deformable (DR) registration algorithms. The corresponding lesions were contoured and identified on successive PET images based on including the voxels with the standardized uptake value over 15. Each algorithm was evaluated for its ability to accurately align corresponding lesions via skeleton registration. A lesion matching score (MS) was measured for each lesion, which quantified the per cent overlap between the lesion's two corresponding contours. Three separate sensitivity studies were conducted to investigate the robustness of ART in matching: sensitivity of lesion matching to various contouring threshold levels, effects of imperfections in the bone auto-segmentation and sensitivity of mis-registration. The performance of ART (MS = 82% for both datasets, p ≪ 0.001) in lesion matching was significantly better than rigid (MS(TRT)=53%, MS(Response)= 46%) and DR (MS(TRT)=46%, MS(Response)=45%) algorithms. Neither varying threshold levels for lesion contouring nor imperfect bone segmentation had significant (p~0.10) impact on the ART matching performance as the MS remained unchanged. Despite the mis-registration reduced MS for ART, as low as 67% (p ≪ 0.001), the performance remained to be superior to the rigid and DR algorithms. ART is not only robust to contouring threshold levels for bone lesions, but also outperforms rigid and DR algorithms in lesion matching.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate an articulated registration algorithm for the whole-body skeleton registration in human patients.

Sixteen patients (weight = 80-117 kg, height = 168-191 cm) with advanced prostate cancer underwent the pre- and mid-treatment PET/CT scans over a course of cancer therapy. Skeletons were extracted from the CT images by thresholding (HU>150). Skeletons were registered using the articulated, rigid, and deformable registration algorithms to account for position and postural variability between scans. The inter-observers agreement in the atlas creation, the agreement between the manually and atlas-based segmented bones, and the registration performances of all three registration algorithms were all assessed using the Dice similarity index-DSIobserved, DSIatlas, and DSIregister. Hausdorff distance (dHausdorff) of the registered skeletons was also used for registration evaluation. Nearly negligible inter-observers variability was found in the bone atlases creation as the DSIobserver was 96 ± 2%. Atlas-based and manual segmented bones were in excellent agreement with DSIatlas of 90 ± 3%. Articulated (DSIregsiter = 75 ± 2%, dHausdorff = 0.37 ± 0.08 cm) and deformable registration algorithms (DSIregister = 77 ± 3%, dHausdorff = 0.34 ± 0.08 cm) considerably outperformed the rigid registration algorithm (DSIregsiter = 59 ± 9%, dHausdorff = 0.69 ± 0.20 cm) in the skeleton registration as the rigid registration algorithm failed to capture the skeleton flexibility in the joints. Despite superior skeleton registration performance, deformable registration algorithm failed to preserve the local rigidity of bones as over 60% of the skeletons were deformed. Articulated registration is superior to rigid and deformable registrations by capturing global flexibility while preserving local rigidity inherent in skeleton registration. Therefore, articulated registration can be employed to accurately register the whole-body human skeletons, and it enables the treatment response assessment of various bone diseases.""","""['Stephen Yip', 'Timothy Perk', 'Robert Jeraj']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Use of articulated registration for response assessment of individual metastatic bone lesions.', 'Sensitivity study of voxel-based PET image comparison to image registration algorithms.', 'Propagation of target and organ at risk contours in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using deformable image registration.', 'Image Registration in Longitudinal Bone Assessment Using Computed Tomography.', 'A Series of Engravings Representing the Bones of the Human Skeleton, &c.', 'Biomechanical Morphing for Personalized Fitting of Scoliotic Torso Skeleton Models.', 'Whole-Body 18F-Fluoride PET SUV Imaging to Monitor Response to Dasatinib Therapy in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases: Secondary Results from ACRIN 6687.', 'Impact of Anatomic Location of Bone Metastases on Prognosis in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Quantification of bone flare on 18F-NaF PET/CT in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Feasibility of Deep Learning-Based PET/MR Attenuation Correction in the Pelvis Using Only Diagnostic MR Images.']"""

Manual segmentation, as performed nowadays, is a time consuming process and prone to errors due to the a high intra- and inter-expert variability. This paper introduces a new automatic method for prostate, rectum and bladder segmentation in planning CT using a geometrical shape model under a Bayesian framework. A set of prior organ shapes are first built by applying principal component analysis to a population of manually delineated CT images. Then, for a given individual, the most similar shape is obtained by mapping a set of multi-scale edge observations to the space of organs with a customized likelihood function. Finally, the selected shape is locally deformed to adjust the edges of each organ. Experiments were performed with real data from a population of 116 patients treated for prostate cancer. The data set was split in training and test groups, with 30 and 86 patients, respectively. Results show that the method produces competitive segmentations w.r.t standard methods (averaged dice = 0.91 for prostate, 0.94 for bladder, 0.89 for rectum) and outperforms the majority-vote multi-atlas approaches (using rigid registration, free-form deformation and the demons algorithm).""","""['Fabio Martínez', 'Eduardo Romero', 'Gaël Dréan', 'Antoine Simon', 'Pascal Haigron', 'Renaud de Crevoisier', 'Oscar Acosta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Object-constrained meshless deformable algorithm for high speed 3D nonrigid registration between CT and CBCT.', 'Locally-constrained boundary regression for segmentation of prostate and rectum in the planning CT images.', 'Propagation of target and organ at risk contours in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using deformable image registration.', 'An atlas-based electron density mapping method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-alone treatment planning and adaptive MRI-based prostate radiation therapy.', 'A semiautomatic segmentation method for prostate in CT images using local texture classification and statistical shape modeling.', 'Systematic Review of Tumor Segmentation Strategies for Bone Metastases.', 'Automatic multi-organ segmentation in computed tomography images using hierarchical convolutional neural network.', 'CT Male Pelvic Organ Segmentation via Hybrid Loss Network With Incomplete Annotation.', 'Application of U-shaped convolutional neural network in auto segmentation and reconstruction of 3D prostate model in laparoscopic prostatectomy navigation.', 'CT male pelvic organ segmentation using fully convolutional networks with boundary sensitive representation.']"""

The total rate of genitourinary tract infection after prostate biopsy was 0.76%, while that following transrectal procedure was 0.83% and following transperineal procedure was 0.57%, which were not significantly different. In contrast, febrile infection associated with a fever (≥38 °C) occurred significantly more frequently after transrectal (0.71%) than transperineal (0.16%) approach (P = 0.04). Notably, in infectious cases, Escherichia coli was most frequently isolated. Of the 9 E. coli strains isolated by urine culture, 6 (66.7%) produced extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and 7 (77.8%) showed levofloxacin resistance. Similarly, of 6 E. coli strains isolated by blood culture, 4 (66.7%) produced ESBL and 6 (100%) showed levofloxacin resistance. When the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) with levofloxacin for the patients undergoing transrectal or transperineal biopsy was compared between a single dose (500 mg) and that given for 2 or more days, no significant difference was observed for the rate of infection (transrectal: 0.82% vs. 1.04%, p = 0.94; transperineal: 0.30% vs. 0.46%, p = 0.68). Although a single dose of levofloxacin for AMP is sufficient to prevent genitourinary infection after transrectal or transperineal prostate biopsy, and recommended in this era of increased multi-drug resistant pathogens, the increase in fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli and ESBL-producing E. coli has emerged as a profound problem for surveillance.""","""['Yoshikazu Togo', 'Tatsuhiko Kubo', 'Rikiya Taoka', 'Yoshiki Hiyama', 'Teruhisa Uehara', 'Jiroh Hashimoto', 'Yuichiro Kurimura', 'Satoshi Takahashi', 'Taiji Tsukamoto', 'Jun Miyazaki', 'Hiroyuki Nishiyama', 'Shinichiro Kira', 'Hiroshi Kiyota', 'Satoshi Yazawa', 'Naoya Niwa', 'Hiroshi Hongo', 'Mototsugu Oya', 'Taku Kato', 'Mitsuru Yasuda', 'Takashi Deguchi', 'Kiyohito Ishikawa', 'Kiyotaka Hoshinaga', 'Minori Matsumoto', 'Katsumi Shigemura', 'Kazushi Tanaka', 'Soichi Arakawa', 'Masato Fujisawa', 'Koichiro Wada', 'Shinya Uehara', 'Toyohiko Watanabe', 'Hiromi Kumon', 'Kanao Kobayashi', 'Akio Matsubara', 'Masahiro Matsumoto', 'Takehiko Sho', 'Ryoichi Hamasuna', 'Tetsuro Matsumoto', 'Hiroshi Hayami', 'Masayuki Nakagawa', 'Shingo Yamamoto']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Infect Chemother""","""['Impact of selective media for detecting fluoroquinolone-insusceptible/extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli before transrectal prostate biopsy.', 'Outbreak of fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli infections after transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate.', 'Selective culture of Escherichia coli to prevent infective complications of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: Clinical efficacy and analysis of characteristics of quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli.', 'Levofloxacin resistant Escherichia coli sepsis following an ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy: report of four cases and review of the literature.', 'Infectious complications following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: new challenges in the era of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli.', 'Sepsis rates after template prostate biopsy with single-dose prophylactic antibiotic.', 'Role of Prophylactic Antibiotics in Transperineal Prostate Biopsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Positive Culture Prior to Transperineal Prostate Biopsy Was Not Associated with Post-Biopsy Febrile Urinary Tract Infection Development.', 'Current routines for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to transrectal prostate biopsy: a national survey to all urology clinics in Sweden.', 'Comparison of levofloxacin-based prophylaxis regimens for transrectal prostate biopsy: a prospective randomized single-center study.']"""

Digital rectal examination is based on manually palpating the prostate tissue via the rectum. This test lacks sufficient accuracy required for early diagnosis which is necessary for effective management of prostate cancer. To develop an effective prostate cancer diagnostic technique, the authors propose an imaging technique that maps the distribution of the relative prostate tissue's elasticity modulus. Unlike digital rectal examination, this technique is quantitative, capable of accurately detecting small prostate lesions that cannot be sensed by manual palpation, and its accuracy is independent of the physician's experience.  Methods:   The proposed technique is a quasistatic elastography technique which uses ultrasound imaging to acquire tissue displacements resulting from transrectal ultrasound mechanical stimulation. The system involves a standard ultrasound imaging unit with accessibility to its radiofrequency data. The displacements are used as data for the tissue elasticity reconstruction. This reconstruction does not require tissue segmentation and is based on physics governing tissue mechanics. It is formulated using an inverse problem framework where elastic tissue deformation equations are fully inverted using an iterative scheme where each iteration involves stress calculation followed by elastic modulus updating until convergence is achieved.In silico and tissue mimicking phantom studies were conducted to validate the proposed technique, followed by a clinical pilot study involving two prostate cancer patients with whole-mount histopathology analysis on prostatectomy specimens to confirm a cancer location.  Results:   The phantom studies demonstrated robustness and reasonably high accuracy of the proposed method. Obtained Young's modulus ratios indicated reconstruction errors of less than 12%. Reconstructed elastic modulus images of the two clinical cases were compared to whole-mount histopathology slides where cancerous areas were identified. This comparison indicated marked tissue stiffening in the cancer area with reasonably accurate consistency observed between cancerous lesions identified by histopathology and high stiffness areas of the elastography images.  Conclusions:   Results obtained from the phantom and patient studies indicate that the proposed method is reasonably accurate for detecting cancerous lesions. The proposed system does not require any additional hardware attachment for mechanical stimulation or data acquisition while the elasticity reconstruction algorithm can be easily implemented, leading to a low cost system that can be potentially utilized as an effective clinical tool for prostate cancer diagnosis.""","""['Seyed Reza Mousavi', 'Ali Sadeghi-Naini', 'Gregory J Czarnota', 'Abbas Samani']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Ultrasound Elastography of the Prostate Using an Unconstrained Modulus Reconstruction Technique: A Pilot Clinical Study.', 'A regularization-free elasticity reconstruction method for ultrasound elastography with freehand scan.', 'A novel shape-similarity-based elastography technique for prostate cancer assessment.', 'A novel fast full inversion based breast ultrasound elastography technique.', 'Imaging and estimation of tissue elasticity by ultrasound.', 'The Role of Affordable, Point-of-Care Technologies for Cancer Care in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Review and Commentary.', 'Ultrasound Elastography of the Prostate Using an Unconstrained Modulus Reconstruction Technique: A Pilot Clinical Study.', 'Relative Elastic Modulus Imaging Using Sector Ultrasound Data for Abdominal Applications: An Evaluation of Strategies and Feasibility.', 'A regularization-free elasticity reconstruction method for ultrasound elastography with freehand scan.']"""

Methods:   The simulations included a 3D finite element method based biothermal model, and acoustic field calculations for the ExAblate ERUS phased array (2.3 MHz, 2.3 × 4.0 cm(2), ∼1000 channels) using the rectangular radiator method. Array beamforming strategies were investigated to deliver protracted, continuous-wave hyperthermia to focal prostate cancer targets identified from representative patient cases. Constraints on power densities, sonication durations and switching speeds imposed by ExAblate hardware and software were incorporated in the models. Preliminary experiments included beamformed sonications in tissue mimicking phantoms under MR temperature monitoring at 3 T (GE Discovery MR750W).  Results:   Acoustic intensities considered during simulation were limited to ensure mild hyperthermia (Tmax < 45 °C) and fail-safe operation of the ExAblate array (spatial and time averaged acoustic intensity ISATA < 3.4 W/cm(2)). Tissue volumes with therapeutic temperature levels (T > 41 °C) were estimated. Numerical simulations indicated that T > 41 °C was calculated in 13-23 cm(3) volumes for sonications with planar or diverging beam patterns at 0.9-1.2 W/cm(2), in 4.5-5.8 cm(3) volumes for simultaneous multipoint focus beam patterns at ∼0.7 W/cm(2), and in ∼6.0 cm(3) for curvilinear (cylindrical) beam patterns at 0.75 W/cm(2). Focused heating patterns may be practical for treating focal disease in a single posterior quadrant of the prostate and diffused heating patterns may be useful for heating quadrants, hemigland volumes or even bilateral targets. Treatable volumes may be limited by pubic bone heating. Therapeutic temperatures were estimated for a range of physiological parameters, sonication duty cycles and rectal cooling. Hyperthermia specific phasing patterns were implemented on the ExAblate prostate array and continuous-wave sonications (∼0.88 W/cm(2), 15 min) were performed in tissue-mimicking material with real-time MR-based temperature imaging (PRFS imaging at 3.0 T). Shapes of heating patterns observed during experiments were consistent with simulations.

The purpose of this study was to develop a general strategy that allows for automatically, prospectively, and objectively determining the optimal patient-specific CT simulation protocols based on radiation-therapy goals, namely, maintenance of contouring quality and integrity while minimizing patient CT simulation dose.  Methods:   The authors proposed a general prediction strategy that provides automatic optimal CT simulation protocol selection as a function of patient size and treatment planning task. The optimal protocol is the one that delivers the minimum dose required to provide a CT simulation scan that yields accurate contours. Accurate treatment plans depend on accurate contours in order to conform the dose to actual tumor and normal organ positions. An image quality index, defined to characterize how simulation scan quality affects contour delineation, was developed and used to benchmark the contouring accuracy and treatment plan quality within the predication strategy. A clinical workflow was developed to select the optimal CT simulation protocols incorporating patient size, target delineation, and radiation dose efficiency. An experimental study using an anthropomorphic pelvis phantom with added-bolus layers was used to demonstrate how the proposed prediction strategy could be implemented and how the optimal CT simulation protocols could be selected for prostate cancer patients based on patient size and treatment planning task. Clinical IMRT prostate treatment plans for seven CT scans with varied image quality indices were separately optimized and compared to verify the trace of target and organ dosimetry coverage.  Results:   Based on the phantom study, the optimal image quality index for accurate manual prostate contouring was 4.4. The optimal tube potentials for patient sizes of 38, 43, 48, 53, and 58 cm were 120, 140, 140, 140, and 140 kVp, respectively, and the corresponding minimum CTDIvol for achieving the optimal image quality index 4.4 were 9.8, 32.2, 100.9, 241.4, and 274.1 mGy, respectively. For patients with lateral sizes of 43-58 cm, 120-kVp scan protocols yielded up to 165% greater radiation dose relative to 140-kVp protocols, and 140-kVp protocols always yielded a greater image quality index compared to the same dose-level 120-kVp protocols. The trace of target and organ dosimetry coverage and the γ passing rates of seven IMRT dose distribution pairs indicated the feasibility of the proposed image quality index for the predication strategy.  Conclusions:   A general strategy to predict the optimal CT simulation protocols in a flexible and quantitative way was developed that takes into account patient size, treatment planning task, and radiation dose. The experimental study indicated that the optimal CT simulation protocol and the corresponding radiation dose varied significantly for different patient sizes, contouring accuracy, and radiation treatment planning tasks.""","""['Hua Li', 'Lifeng Yu', 'Mark A Anastasio', 'Hsin-Chen Chen', 'Jun Tan', 'Hiram Gay', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Daniel A Low', 'Sasa Mutic']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automatic selection of tube potential for radiation dose reduction in CT: a general strategy.', 'Synthetic CT: simulating low dose single and dual energy protocols from a dual energy scan.', 'Effect of automatic tube voltage selection on image quality and radiation dose in abdominal CT angiography of various body sizes: a phantom study.', 'A CT-aided PC-based physical treatment planning of TBI: a method for dose calculation.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'Task-based image quality assessment in radiation therapy: initial characterization and demonstration with computer-simulation study.', 'A comparative study based on image quality and clinical task performance for CT reconstruction algorithms in radiotherapy.']"""

Methods:   Contours for the targets and organs at risk (OARs) from daily diagnostic-quality CTs acquired with in-room CT (CTVision, Siemens) were generated by populating the planning contours using an autosegmentation tool based on deformable registration (ABAS, Elekta) with manual editing for ten prostate-bed patients treated with postoperative daily CT-guided IMRT. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) obtained by maximizing the overlap of contours for a structure between the daily and plan contours was used to quantify the organ deformation between the plan and daily CTs. Three interfractional-variation-correction schemes, the current standard practice of IGRT repositioning, a previously developed online adaptive RT (ART), and the full reoptimization, were applied to these daily CTs and a number of dose-volume quantities for the targets and organs at risk were compared for their effectiveness to account for the interfractional variations.  Results:   Large interfractional organ deformations in prostate-bed irradiation were seen. The mean DSCs for CTV, rectum, and bladder were 86.6 ± 5.1% (range from 61% to 97%), 77.3% ± 7.4% (range from 55% to 90%), and 75.4% ± 11.2% (range from 46% to 96%), respectively. The fractional and cumulative dose-volume quantities for CTV and PTV: V100 (volume received at least 100% prescription dose), and rectum and bladder: V45Gy and V60Gy (volume received at least 45 or 60 Gy), were compared for the repositioning, adaptive, reoptimization, and original plans. The fractional and cumulative dosimetric results were nearly the same. The average cumulative CTV V100 were 88.0%, 98.4%, 99.2%, and 99.3% for the IGRT, ART, reoptimization, and original plans, respectively. The corresponding rectal V45Gy (V60Gy) were 58.7% (27.3%), 48.1% (20.7%), 43.8% (16.1%), and 44.9% (16.8%). The results for bladder were comparable among three schemes. Paired two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed and it was found that ART and reoptimization provide better target coverage and better OAR sparing, especially rectum sparing.

This phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of earlier treatment with zoledronic acid in men with castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Men with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and bone metastases whose androgen-deprivation therapy was initiated within 6 months of study entry were randomly assigned in a blinded 1:1 ratio to receive zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 4 weeks) or a placebo. After their disease progressed to castration-resistant status, all patients received open-label treatment with zoledronic acid. The primary end point was time to first SRE, defined as radiation to bone, clinical fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, or death as a result of prostate cancer. Target accrual was 680 patients. Primary analysis was planned after 470 SREs. The study was discontinued prematurely (645 patients; 299 SREs) after the corporate supporter withdrew study drug supply.  Results:   Early zoledronic acid was not associated with increased time to first SRE. The median time to first SRE was 31.9 months in the zoledronic acid group (95% CI, 24.2 to 40.3) and 29.8 months in the placebo group (95% CI, 25.3 to 37.2; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0 to 1.17; one-sided stratified log-rank P = .39). Overall survival was similar between the groups (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.12; P = .29). Rates of adverse events were similar between the groups.

In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms of recombinant GLIPR1 protein (glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1-transmembrane domain deleted [GLIPR1-ΔTM]) uptake by prostate cancer cells and the efficacy of systemic GLIPR1-ΔTM administration in a prostate cancer xenograft mouse model. GLIPR1-ΔTM was selectively internalized by prostate cancer cells, leading to increased apoptosis through reactive oxygen species production and to decreased c-Myc protein levels. Interestingly, GLIPR1-ΔTM was internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis in association with Hsc70. Systemic administration of GLIPR1-ΔTM significantly inhibited VCaP xenograft growth. GLIPR1-ΔTM showed no evidence of toxicity following elimination from mouse models 8 hr after injection.

Familial risk is a known risk factor for many cancers, but an unbiased estimation of the PAF for familial risk requires a large study population to include rare cancers. PAFs and their corresponding standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for familial relative risk among first-degree relatives (FDRs) and second-degree relatives (SDRs) diagnosed with the same (concordant) invasive or in situ cancers. Calculations were based on the Swedish Family-Cancer Database considering 8,148,737 individuals. To assess environmental effects, PAFs were also calculated for concordant cancers among spouses. Almost all cancers showed a significant familial risk. The highest PAFs were found for the common cancers of the prostate (13.94%), breast (7.46%) and colorectum (6.78%) among the FDRs. In the FDRs, the overall PAF for any concordant cancer was 4.20%, but in the SDRs, it was only 0.34%. The overall PAFs for in situ cancers were 0.86% and 0.56% for the FDRs and SDRs, respectively. The overall independent familial PAF was 5.96% for the invasive and in situ cancers in the FDRs and SDRs. The cancers between spouses yielded an overall PAF of 0.14%. For esophageal cancer, the risk among spouses was higher than the familial risk.

The aim of this work was to evaluate whether the biologically effective dose (BED), and in particular the duration of radiotherapy, intended as overall treatment time, has an effect on biochemical failure rates and to develop a nomogram useful to predict the 6-year probability of biochemical failure.  Patients and methods:   A total of 670 patients with T1-3 N0 prostate cancer were treated with external beam definitive radiotherapy, to a total dose of 72-79.2 Gy in 40-44 fractions. The computed BED values were treated with restricted cubic splines. Variables were checked for colinearity using Spearman's test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate freedom from biochemical relapse (FFBR) rates. The Cox regression analysis was used to identify prognostic factors of biochemical relapse in the final most performing model and to create a nomogram. Concordance probability estimate and calibration methods were used to validate the nomogram.  Results:   Neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation was administered to 475 patients (70%). The median follow-up was 80 months (range 20-129 months). Overall, the 6-year FFBR rate was 88.3%. BED values were associated with higher biochemical failure risk.

Following adjustment for age, education, alcohol consumption and BMI, for current compared with never smokers, highly significant and strongly elevated estimates were found for total (HR=1.79, 95% CI 1.59-2.02), tobacco-related (HR=2.52, 95% CI 2.16-2.95), upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) (HR=5.77, 95% CI 2.73-12.21), lung (HR=10.47, 95% CI 6.74-16.25), bladder (HR=3.31, 95% CI 1.71-6.41) and liver (HR=4.64, 95% CI 1.53-14.08) cancer. Findings suggest a lower risk of prostate cancer in current smokers. In addition, the occurrence of lung and UADT cancer was significantly elevated in men in the lowest educational attainment category. If smoking had not occurred, ∼23% of total cancer, 37% of tobacco-related, 77% of lung, 58% of UADT, 43% of liver and 45% of bladder cancer cases could have been prevented in this cohort of men.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that serum eEF2 IgG Ab levels were significantly higher in colorectal and gastric cancer patients compared to healthy individuals. Immunohistochemistry experiments showed that the eEF2 protein was overexpressed in the majority of lung, esophageal, pancreatic, breast and prostate cancers, HNSCC, glioblastoma multiforme and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Knockdown of eEF2 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) significantly inhibited the growth in four eEF2-expressing cell lines, PC14 lung cancer, PCI6 pancreatic cancer, HT1080 fibrosarcoma and A172 glioblastoma cells, but not in eEF2-undetectable MCF7 cells. Furthermore, eEF2-derived 9-mer peptides, EF786 (eEF2 786-794 aa) and EF292 (eEF2 292-300 aa), elicited cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from an HLA-A*24:02- and an HLA-A*02:01-positive healthy donor, respectively, in an HLA-A-restricted manner.

Tumor cells reestablish migratory behaviors employed during nonneoplastic processes such as embryonic development, leukocyte trafficking and wound healing.

Individual bone scan disease burden, quantified by counting bone metastasis number, was correlated with clinical outcome using specific threshold points of 1-4, 5-20 and >20 detectable lesions.  Results:   Patients with a higher metastasis number had a shorter PFS and OS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-2.4; P < 0.001).

In human, the gene encoding TP53INP1 is expressed at very high level in some pathological situations, such as inflammation and prostate cancer (PC). TP53INP1 overexpression in PC seems to be a worse prognostic factor, particularly predictive of biological cancer relapse, making TP53INP1 a relevant specific target for molecular therapy of Castration Resistant (CR) PC. In that context, detection of TP53INP1 in patient biological fluids is a promising diagnostic avenue. We report here successful development of a new Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) detecting TP53INP1, taking advantage of molecular tools (monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and recombinant proteins) generated in the laboratory during the course of basic functional investigations devoted to TP53INP1.

We established several LNCaP subclones with distinct insensitivities to androgen deprivation from a parental LNCaP cell line. In the resulting clones, the sensitivity to androgen-deprivation negatively correlated with their PSA expression levels. In two of these clones, an androgen insensitive clone, LNCaP-cl1, and an androgen sensitive clone, LNCaP-cl5, the DNA copy number differed significantly, indicating that these clones contain genetically distinct cells. LNCaP-cl1 had higher PSA expression but lower invasiveness and tumor growth potential than LNCaP-cl5. The expression levels of two genes that are known to be regulated by miR-21, an androgen-regulated microRNA, Sprouty1 (SPRY1) and Jagged1 (JAG1) were significantly lower in LNCaP-cl1 than in LNCaP-cl5. Knocking down SPRY1 in LNCaP cells enhanced PSA expression and cell proliferation. JAG1 administration in LNCaP cells enhanced cell invasion and JAG1 knockdown in PC3 cells suppressed cell invasion and tumor formation. These results indicated that the expression differences in SPRY1 and JAG1 may contribute to the phenotypic differences between the LNCaP-cl1 and LNCaP-cl5 clones. In tissue samples, SPRY1 expression levels were significantly lower in prostate cancer patients with PSA recurrence after surgical treatment (P = 0.0076) and JAG1 expression levels were significantly higher in Gleason sum (GS) 8-9 disease than in GS 5-6 (P = 0.0121).

There is growing recognition of the potential role of primary care in cancer follow-up. This paper describes the protocol for a phase II multisite randomised controlled trial of a novel model of shared care for the follow-up of men after completing treatment for low-moderate risk prostate cancer.  Methods and analysis:   The intervention is a shared care model of follow-up visits in the first 12 months after completing treatment for prostate cancer with the following specific components: a survivorship care plan, general practitioner (GP) management guidelines, register and recall systems, screening for distress and unmet needs and patient information resources. Eligible men will have completed surgery and/or radiotherapy for low-moderate risk prostate cancer within the previous 8 weeks and have a GP who consents to participate. Ninety men will be randomised to the intervention or current hospital follow-up care. Study outcome measures will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months and include anxiety, depression, unmet needs, prostate cancer-specific quality of life and satisfaction with care. Clinical processes and healthcare resource usage will also be measured. The principal emphasis of the analysis will be on obtaining estimates of the treatment effect size and assessing feasibility in order to inform the design of a subsequent phase III trial.  Ethics and dissemination:   Ethics approval has been granted by the University of Western Australia and from all hospital recruitment sites in Western Australia and Victoria.

Methods:   In a prospective, randomized trial conducted between 1995 and 2001, 206 men with intermediate-risk or high-risk PC were randomized to receive 70 Gy with or without 6 months of androgen-suppression therapy (AST). The subgroup of 197 patients with information available on the percentage of positive biopsies formed the cohort. Fine and Gray regression analysis was used to assess whether men with high-risk PC versus unfavorable intermediate-risk PC had an increased risk of PCSM.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 14.3 years, there were 127 deaths (64.5%), including 22 deaths (17.3%) from PC. There were no PC deaths in the favorable intermediate-risk group. There was an increase in the risk of PCSM among men with high-risk PC versus unfavorable intermediate-risk PC, but the difference was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-3.83; P = .30) after adjusting for age, randomized treatment arm, and comorbidity.  Conclusions:   The lack of PC deaths among men with favorable intermediate-risk PC suggests that adding AST may not reduce their risk of PCSM; whereas many men with unfavorable intermediate-risk PC are at risk for harboring occult PC with Gleason scores from 8 to 10 and, if proven, would benefit from long-term AST. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions should be considered to identify PC with Gleason scores from 8 to 10 in these men.""","""['Florence K Keane', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Danjie Zhang', 'Marian J Loffredo', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Andrew A Renshaw', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Re: The likelihood of death from prostate cancer in men with favorable or unfavorable intermediate-risk disease.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy and the risk of death from prostate cancer among men with favorable or unfavorable intermediate-risk disease.', 'Age, Comorbidity, and the Risk of Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality in Men With Biopsy Gleason Score 4+3: Implications on Patient Selection for Multiparametric MRI.', 'Short-course androgen deprivation therapy and the risk of death from high-risk prostate cancer in men undergoing external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy.', 'Risk Group and Death From Prostate Cancer: Implications for Active Surveillance in Men With Favorable Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'The Impact of Gleason Grade 3 as a Predictive Factor for Biochemical Recurrence after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study in Japan (The MSUG94 Group).', 'Grade and stage misclassification in intermediate unfavorable-risk prostate cancer radiotherapy candidates.', 'Results of the IROCA international clinical audit in prostate cancer radiotherapy at six comprehensive cancer centres.', 'Effect of Androgen Deprivation on Long-term Outcomes of Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Stratified as Favorable or Unfavorable: A Secondary Analysis of the RTOG 9408 Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Circulating blood miRNAs for prostate cancer risk stratification: miRroring the underlying tumor biology with liquid biopsies.']"""

Eotaxin-1 (CCL11), a member of the CC chemokine family, is elevated in many types of human cancer. Here, to reveal the molecular mechanisms of eotaxin-1 in prostate cancer cell invasion, the expression of eotaxin-1 receptors [CC chemokine receptor (CCR)2, CCR3 and CCR5] were silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA). The ERK pathway was inhibited by the specific MEK inhibitor U0126. The role of eotaxin-1 and the CCR3-ERK pathway in prostate cancer cell invasion was assessed by invasion and migration assays. MMP-3 expression was detected by real-time PCR and ELISA assay. The results demonstrated that eotaxin-1 promoted the invasion and migration of DU-145 cells, and increased ERK1/2 activation and MMP-3 expression. Knockdown of CCR3 inhibited the invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells, and attenuated the eotaxin-1-induced ERK1/2 activation and MMP-3 expression. Furthermore, inactivation of the ERK pathway suppressed the eotaxin‑1-promoted invasion and migration, and decreased MMP-3 expression in the prostate cancer cells. Together, the present study suggests that eotaxin-1 increases MMP-3 expression via the CCR3-ERK pathway, thereby promoting prostate cancer cell invasion and migration. Thus, therapies that block eotaxin-1 and CCR3 may be effective interventions for prostate cancer.""","""['Feng Zhu', 'Pei Liu', 'Jun Li', 'Yan Zhang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Upregulated expression of CCR3 in osteoarthritis and CCR3 mediated activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes.', 'p21WAF1 mediates the IL-15-induced migration and invasion of human bladder cancer 5637 cells via the ERK1/2/NF-κB/MMP-9 pathway.', 'Over-expression of lipocalin 2 promotes cell migration and invasion through activating ERK signaling to increase SLUG expression in prostate cancer.', 'ADAM17 targets MMP-2 and MMP-9 via EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway activation to promote prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'CXCR4 promotes oral squamous cell carcinoma migration and invasion through inducing expression of MMP-9 and MMP-13 via the ERK signaling pathway.', 'Cytochalasin B-Induced Membrane Vesicles from TRAIL-Overexpressing Mesenchymal Stem Cells Induce Extrinsic Pathway of Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Mouse Model.', 'Senescence of Tumor Cells in Anticancer Therapy-Beneficial and Detrimental Effects.', 'White adipose tissue-derived factors and prostate cancer progression: mechanisms and targets for interventions.', 'Molecular Clustering Analysis of Blood Biomarkers in World Trade Center Exposed Community Members with Persistent Lower Respiratory Symptoms.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Tumor Aggressiveness in Head and Neck Cancer through Chemokine Ligand 11 and C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 3 Signaling Circuit.']"""

As such, there is an urgent need for the identification and evaluation of new markers for early diagnosis and disease prognosis. Studies have shown a link between PCa, lipids and lipid metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the concentrations and distribution of serum lipids in patients with PCa as compared with serum from controls.  Method:   Using Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) lipid profiling, we analyzed serum phospholipids from age-matched subjects who were either newly diagnosed with PCa or healthy (normal).  Results:   We found that cholester (CE), dihydrosphingomyelin (DSM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), egg phosphatidylcholine (ePC) and egg phosphatidylethanolamine (ePE) are the 5 major lipid groups that varied between normal and cancer serums. ePC 38:5, PC 40:3, and PC 42:4 represent the lipids species most prevalent in PCa as compared with normal serum. Further analysis revealed that serum ePC 38:5 ≥0.015 nmoles, PC 40.3 ≤0.001 nmoles and PC 42:4 ≤0.0001 nmoles correlated with the absence of PCa at 94% prediction. Conversely, serum ePC 38:5 ≤0.015 nmoles, PC 40:3 ≥0.001 nmoles, and PC 42:4 ≥0.0001 nmoles correlated with the presence of PCa.  Conclusion:   In summary, we have demonstrated that ePC 38:5, PC 40:3, and PC 42:4 may serve as early predictive serum markers for the presence of PCa.""","""['Nima Patel', 'Robert Vogel', 'Kumar Chandra-Kuntal', 'Wayne Glasgow', 'Uddhav Kelavkar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['NMR spectroscopy of filtered serum of prostate cancer: A new frontier in metabolomics.', 'Association between PSA density and pathologically significant prostate cancer: The impact of prostate volume.', 'The digital rectal exam, prostate-specific antigen and transrectal echography in the diagnosis of prostatic cancer.', 'Prostatic specific antigen and bone scan in the diagnosis and follow-up of prostate cancer.

Methods:   Between May and December 2012, a questionnaire containing 16 items was sent to 600 GPs and ISs in the federal state Brandenburg and in Berlin (Germany). The independent influence of several criteria on the decision of GPs and ISs to apply PSA-based early PCa detection was assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis (MLRA).  Results:   392 evaluable questionnaires were collected (return rate 65%). 81% of the physicians declared that they apply PSA testing for early PCa detection; of these, 58 and 15% would screen patients until the age of 80 and 90 years, respectively. In case of a pathological PSA level, 77% would immediately refer the patient to a urologist, while 13% would re-assess elevated PSA levels after 3-12 months. Based on MLRA, the following criteria were independently associated with a positive attitude towards PSA-based early PCa detection: specialisation (application of early detection more frequent for GPs and hospital-based ISs) (OR 3.12; p < 0.001), physicians who use exclusively GP or IS education (OR 3.95; p = 0.002), and physicians who recommend yearly PSA assessment after the age of 50 (OR 6.85; p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   GPs and ISs frequently apply PSA-based early PCa detection. In doing so, 13% would initiate specific referral to a urologist in case of pathological PSA values too late.

Extended antibiotic prophylaxis beyond 24 hours may contribute to hospital acquired infections such as Clostridium difficile colitis. We evaluated practice patterns of antibiotic prophylaxis in genitourinary cancer surgery and assessed the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on hospital acquired C. difficile infections.  Materials and methods:   We identified 59,184 patients treated with radical prostatectomy, 27,921 who underwent partial or radical nephrectomy, and 5,425 treated with radical cystectomy for prostate, kidney and bladder cancers, respectively, from the Premier Perspective Database (Premier Inc., Charlotte, North Carolina) from 2007 to 2012. We constructed hierarchical linear regression models to identify patient and hospital factors associated with extended antibiotic prophylaxis. We evaluated the association between extended antibiotic prophylaxis and C. difficile infections for patients who underwent partial or radical nephrectomy and radical cystectomy with multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   Surgery specific models demonstrated that hospital identity was associated with a substantial proportion of the variation in extended antibiotic prophylaxis (20% to 35% for radical prostatectomy, partial or radical nephrectomy, and radical cystectomy). Postoperative C. difficile colitis occurred in 0.02% of patients treated with radical prostatectomy, 0.23% of those treated with partial or radical nephrectomy and 1.7% of those treated with radical cystectomy. On multivariate analysis extended antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with higher odds of C. difficile infection after partial or radical nephrectomy (OR 3.79, 95% CI 2.46-5.84) and radical cystectomy (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.12-2.39).

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 36 cases restaged within 3 months of the initial diagnosis of micropapillary nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Early radical cystectomy within a 3-month landmark after restaging transurethral bladder tumor resection or conservative treatment with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin, surveillance or deferred radical cystectomy was offered according to surgeon and patient preference. The cumulative incidence of cancer specific mortality and metastasis was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in the cumulative incidence of cancer specific mortality and metastasis between the groups were tested using the log rank test.  Results:   Median patient age was 68 years (IQR 63-77). The male-to-female ratio was 3:1. At restaging all patients had cT1 disease or less. Early radical cystectomy was performed in 15 patients (42%) while 21 (58%) underwent conservative treatment. Median followup after landmark in cancer specific survivors was 3.1 years (IQR 1.1-5.9). The 5-year cumulative incidence of cancer specific mortality was 17% in the early radical cystectomy group and 25% in the conservative management group for an absolute difference of 7% (95% CI -26-41, p = 0.8). The 5-year cumulative incidence of metastasis was 21% and 34%, respectively, with an absolute difference of 13% (95% CI -23-49, p = 0.9). The extent of the micropapillary component was not significantly associated with cancer specific mortality (p = 0.4) or metastasis (p = 0.9).

Objective:   To examine population-based, comparative effectiveness of RARP versus ORP pertaining surgical margin status and use of additional cancer therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective observational study of 5556 RARP and 7878 ORP cases from 2004 to 2009 from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked data.  Intervention:   RARP versus ORP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Propensity-based analyses were performed to minimize treatment selection biases. Generalized linear regression models were computed for comparison of RP surgical margin status and use of additional cancer therapy (radiation therapy [RT] or androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]) by surgical approach.  Results and limitations:   In the propensity-adjusted analysis, RARP was associated with fewer positive surgical margins (13.6% vs 18.3%; odds ratio [OR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.75), largely because of fewer RARP positive margins for intermediate-risk (15.0% vs 21.0%; OR: 0.66; 95% CI, 0.59-0.75) and high-risk (15.1% vs 20.6%; OR: 0.70; 95% CI, 0.63-0.77) disease. In addition, RARP was associated with less use of additional cancer therapy within 6 mo (4.5% vs 6.2%; OR: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69-0.81), 12 mo (OR: 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.86), and 24 mo (OR: 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78) of surgery. Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study and the absence of prostate-specific antigen levels to determine biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   RARP is associated with improved surgical margin status relative to ORP for intermediate- and high-risk disease and less use of postprostatectomy ADT and RT. This has important implications for quality of life, health care delivery, and costs.

Materials and methods:   Nineteen patients who underwent diffusion weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging using multiple b-values and were pathologically confirmed with PCa were enrolled in this study. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was derived using a monoexponential model, while diffusion coefficient (D) and kurtosis (K) were determined using a DK model. Differences between the ADC, D and K values of benign PZ and PCa, as well as those of tumor lesions with Gleason scores of 6, 7 and ≥8 were assessed. Correlations between parameters D and K in PCa were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. ADC, D and K values were correlated with Gleason scores of 6, 7 and ≥8, respectively.  Results:   ADC and D values were significantly (p<0.001) lower in PCa (0.79±0.14μm(2)/ms and 1.56±0.23μm(2)/ms, respectively) compared to benign PZ (1.23±0.19μm(2)/ms and 2.54±0.24μm(2)/ms, respectively). K values were significantly (p<0.001) greater in PCa (0.96±0.20) compared to benign PZ (0.59±0.08). D and K showed fewer overlapping values between benign PZ and PCa compared to ADC. There was a strong negative correlation between D and K values in PCa (Pearson correlation coefficient r=-0.729; p<0.001). ADC and K values differed significantly in tumor lesions with Gleason scores of 6, 7 and ≥8 (p<0.001 and p=0.001, respectively), although no significant difference was detected for D values (p=0.325).

We sought to examine the effects of surgeon variation on functional and oncologic outcomes for patients undergoing RP for prostate cancer in a European center.  Methods:   The study comprised 1,280 men who underwent open retropubic RP performed by one of nine surgeons at an academic institution in Sweden between 2001 and 2008. Potency and continence outcomes were measured preoperatively and 18 months postoperatively by patient-administered questionnaires. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value > 0.2 ng/mL with at least one confirmatory rise. Multivariable random effect models were used to evaluate heterogeneity between surgeons, adjusting for case mix (age, PSA, pathological stage and grade), year of surgery, and surgical experience.  Results:   Of 679 men potent at baseline, 647 provided data at 18 months with 122 (19%) reporting potency. We found no evidence for heterogeneity of potency outcomes between surgeons (P = 1). The continence rate for patients at 18 months was 85%, with 836 of the 979 patients who provided data reporting continence. There was statistically significant heterogeneity between surgeons (P = 0.001). We did not find evidence of an association between surgeons' adjusted probabilities of functional recovery and 5-year probability of freedom from BCR.  Conclusions:   Our data support previous studies regarding a large heterogeneity among surgeons in continence outcomes for patients undergoing RP. This indicates that some patients are receiving sub-optimal care. Quality assurance measures involving performance feedback, should be considered. When surgeons are aware of their outcomes, they can improve them to provide better care to patients.""","""['Sigrid Carlsson', 'Anders Berglund', 'Daniel Sjoberg', 'Ali Khatami', 'Johan Stranne', 'Svante Bergdahl', 'Pär Lodding', 'Gunnar Aus', 'Andrew Vickers', 'Jonas Hugosson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Surgeon heterogeneity significantly affects functional and oncological outcomes after radical prostatectomy in the Swedish LAPPRO trial.', 'Cancer control and functional outcomes after radical prostatectomy as markers of surgical quality: analysis of heterogeneity between surgeons at a single cancer center.', 'Evaluation of combined oncologic and functional outcomes after robotic-assisted laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy: trifecta rate of achieving continence, potency and cancer control.', 'Systematic review of methods for reporting combined outcomes after radical prostatectomy and proposal of a novel system: the survival, continence, and potency (SCP) classification.', 'Functional results of various surgical techniques for radical prostatectomy.', 'Learning curve for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in a large prospective multicentre study.', 'Association of surgeon and hospital volume with short-term outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Nationwide, population-based study.', 'Surgeon heterogeneity significantly affects functional and oncological outcomes after radical prostatectomy in the Swedish LAPPRO trial.', 'Single institution followed by national implementation of systematic surgical quality control and feedback for radical prostatectomy: a 20-year journey.', 'Functional and Oncologic Outcomes Between Open and Robotic Radical Prostatectomy at 24-month Follow-up in the Swedish LAPPRO Trial.']"""

Some postulate that immune modulation after allogeneic BT predisposes to recurrence and death, but autologous superiority is not established. This study assessed whether BT is associated with long-term prostate cancer recurrence and survival with a large single-institutional radical prostatectomy (RP) database.  Study design and methods:   Between 1994 and 2012, a total of 11,680 patients had RP with available outcome and transfusion data. A total of 7443 (64%) had complete covariate data. Clinical variables associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were identified with Cox proportional hazards models for three groups: no BT (reference, 27.7%, n = 2061), autologous BT only (68.8%, n = 5124), and any allogeneic BT (with or without autologous, 3.5%, n = 258).  Results:   Median (range) follow-up was 6 (1-18) years. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly decreased OS (but not BRFS or PCSS) in the allogeneic group versus autologous and no BT groups (p = 0.006). With univariate analysis, any allogeneic BT had a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.29 (range, 1.52-3.46; p < 0.0001) for OS, whereas autologous BT was not significant (HR, 1.04 [range, 0.82-1.32], p = 0.752). In multivariable models, neither autologous nor allogeneic BT was independently associated with BRFS, CSS, or OS, and a dose response was not observed for allogeneic units and BRFS.  Conclusion:   Although allogeneic but not autologous BT was associated with decreased long-term OS, after adjustment for confounding clinical variables, BT was not independently associated with OS, BRFS, or CSS regardless of transfusion type. Notably, no association was observed between allogeneic BT and cancer recurrence.

Methods:   The DIL location was predicted in 23 patients using a histopathologically verified model combining diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, T2 maps and three-dimensional MR spectroscopic imaging. The DIL defined prior to neoadjuvant hormone downregulation was firstly registered to MRI-acquired post-hormone therapy and subsequently to CT radiotherapy scans. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment was planned for an 8-Gy focal boost with 74-Gy dose to the remaining prostate. Areas under the dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for prostate, bladder and rectum, the tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) were compared with those of the uniform 74-Gy IMRT plan.  Results:   Deliverable IMRT plans were feasible for all patients with identifiable DILs (20/23).

However, how SPINK1 contributes to PCa invasion and metastasis is largely unknown.  Methods:   Fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were utilized to detect ERG rearrangement, SPINK1 expression, and EGFR aberrations in a cohort of 211 PCa patients with radical prostatectomy. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to study the transcript and protein expression levels. Cellular distribution of E-cadherin and vimentin were observed by immunofluorescence. Cellular function was evaluated by siRNA, transwell, and wound healing assay, respectively.  Results:   SPINK1-induced Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in benign prostate RWPE cells, manifested by acquisition of mesenchymal morphology, alternation of EMT markers as well as migration and invasion capabilities. Knockdown of SPINK1 in 22RV1 PCa cells results in up-regulation of E-cadherin and down-regulation of vimentin. SPINK1-induced EMT is mediated by EGFR, in which MAPK/MEK/ERK pathway is mainly involved. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) might be an important down-stream molecule of SPINK1-EGFR axis. Clinically, SPINK1 and EGFR were significantly co-overexpressed in a cohort of Chinese PCa patients (n > 200). SPINK1 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in Chinese PCas (P = 0.025).

The pool of zinc available to the body is known to significantly decrease with age. It is suggested that dietary Zn supplementation protects against oxidative damage and reduces the risk of cancer. Zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate were the most frequently mentioned in per os administration in studies on Zn supplementation. The major aim of the study was to compare the bioavailability of different Zn compounds (sulfate, gluconate and citrate) in the prostate after their daily administration to male rats at three different doses (3.0; 15.0; and 50.0 mg Zn/kg b.w.) for 30 days. The results show that bioavailability in the prostate differs significantly between individual zinc preparations. A significantly elevated Zn concentration in the dorso-lateral lobe of the prostate, compared to controls, was found in the rats supplemented with two compounds only: zinc gluconate and zinc citrate.

FPV is also highly amenable to genetic engineering, with a large cloning capacity and many nonessential sites available for integration, meaning that in recombinant form, several transgenes can be expressed simultaneously. Recombinant FPV has proven an effective prophylactic vaccine vector for other diseases of birds, as well as other animal species (Brun et al., Vaccine 26:6508-6528, 2008). These vectors do not integrate into the host genome nor do they undergo productive replication in mammalian cells; thus they have a proven and impeccable safety profile and have been progressed as prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine vectors for use in humans (Beukema et al., Expert Rev Vaccines 5:565-577, 2006; Lousberg et al., Expert Rev Vaccines 10:1435-1449, 2011). Furthermore, repeated immunization with FPV does not blunt subsequent vaccine responses, presumably because it is replication-defective, and thus larger doses can be routinely administered (Brun et al., Vaccine 26:6508-6528, 2008). This strengthens the case for FPV as a viable platform vaccine vector, as it means it can be used repeatedly in an individual to achieve different immunological outcomes. Here we describe in detail the construction of a recombinant variant of FPV expressing the prostate tumor-associated antigen prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) in conjunction with the immunostimulatory cytokine, interleukin-2 (IL-2), which, if undertaken under the appropriate regulatory conditions and with approvals in place, would theoretically be amenable to clinical trial applications.""","""['Paul M Howley', 'Kerrilyn R Diener', 'John D Hayball']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Prospects and limitations of recombinant poxviruses for prostate cancer immunotherapy.', 'Selection of recombinant fowlpox virus coexpressing HIV-1 gag-gp120 and IL-6.', 'Field and vaccine strains of fowlpox virus carry integrated sequences from the avian retrovirus, reticuloendotheliosis virus.', 'Analyses of recombinant vaccinia and fowlpox vaccine vectors expressing transgenes for two human tumor antigens and three human costimulatory molecules.', 'Fowlpox virus as a recombinant vaccine vector for use in mammals and poultry.', 'The evolution of poxvirus vaccines.']"""

In this study, we examined the pathological features of DN and re-evaluated the validity of the ""DN"" concept in multifocal PCa. A total of 201 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens were totally submitted and examined. All independent cancer foci were recorded with prognostically important pathological parameters.

However, in a significant number of cases (11.3 %), the largest TV, the highest GS, and EPE did not concur in the same tumor nodules.

Methods:   Patients with prostate cancer were treated with intravenous docetaxel (60-75 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks and oral atrasentan (10 mg) daily starting on day 3 of cycle 1 and then given continuously. The pharmacokinetics of both drugs were evaluated individually (cycle 1, day 1 for docetaxel; day 21 for atrasentan) and in combination (cycle 2, day 1 for both drugs). Pharmacogenomics of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) were also explored.  Results:   Paired pharmacokinetic data sets for both drugs were evaluable in 21 patients. Atrasentan was rapidly absorbed and plasma concentrations varied over a fourfold range at steady state within a typical patient. The median apparent oral clearance of atrasentan was 17.4 L/h in cycle 1 and was not affected by docetaxel administration (p = 0.9). Median systemic clearance of docetaxel was 51.1 L/h on the first cycle and significantly slower (p = 0.01) compared with that obtained during co-administration of atrasentan, 61.6 L/h. Docetaxel systemic clearance in cycle 1 was 70.0 L/h in patients homozygous for a variant allele in AAG compared with 44.5 L/h in those with at least one wild-type allele (p = 0.03).  Conclusion:   Genetic polymorphism in AAG may explain some inter-patient variability in docetaxel pharmacokinetics.

In this metastatic location, many carcinoma cells display a reversion of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that marks dissemination in the primary tumor mass. This mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transition (MErT) is thought to help seeding and colonization by protecting against cell death. We have previously shown that hepatocyte coculture induces the re-expression of E-cadherin via abrogation of autocrine EGFR signaling pathway in prostate cancer (PCa) cells and that this confers a survival advantage. Herein, we show that hepatocytes educate PCa to undergo MErT by modulating the activity of p38 and ERK1/2. Hepatocytes inhibited p38 and ERK1/2 activity in prostate cancer cells, which allowed E-cadherin re-expression. Introduction of constitutively active MEK6 and MEK1 to DU145 cells cocultured with hepatocytes abrogated E-cadherin re-expression. At least a partial phenotypic reversion can be achieved by suppression of p38 and ERK1/2 activation in DU145 cells even in the absence of hepatocytes. Interestingly, these mitogen-activated protein kinase activities were also triggered by re-expressed E-cadherin leading to p38 and ERK1/2 activity in PCa cells; these signals provide protection to PCa cells upon challenge with chemotherapy and cell death-inducing cytokines. We propose that distinct p38/ERK pathways are related to E-cadherin levels and function downstream of E-cadherin allowing, respectively, for hepatocyte-mediated MErT and tumor cell survival in the face of death signals.""","""['Bo Ma', 'Alan Wells']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Over-expression of TM4SF1 improves cell metastasis and growth by activating ERK1/2 signaling pathway in human prostate cancer.', 'Grape seed extract inhibits EGF-induced and constitutively active mitogenic signaling but activates JNK in human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells: possible role in antiproliferation and apoptosis.', 'Hepatocyte induced re-expression of E-cadherin in breast and prostate cancer cells increases chemoresistance.', 'Role of p38 MAP kinase in cancer stem cells and metastasis.', 'Dissecting the effects of androgen deprivation therapy on cadherin switching in advanced prostate cancer: A molecular perspective.', 'Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors promotes renal cancer progression through MCPIP1 tumor-suppressor downregulation and c-Met activation.', 'Interferon-γ increases sensitivity to chemotherapy and provides immunotherapy targets in models of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Molecular Mechanism of Aerobic Exercise Improving Vascular Remodeling in Hypertension.', 'Akt isoforms differentially provide for chemoresistance in prostate cancer.', 'Thorny ground, rocky soil: Tissue-specific mechanisms of tumor dormancy and relapse.']"""

An US phantom, implanted with x-ray fiducial markers was placed on a motion platform and translated in 3D using five real prostate motion traces acquired using the Calypso system. Motion traces were representative of all types of motion as classified by studying Calypso data for 22 patients. The phantom was imaged using a 3D swept linear-array probe (to mimic trans-perineal imaging) and, subsequently, the kV x-ray imaging system on CyberKnife. A 3D cross-correlation block-matching algorithm was used to track speckle in the ultrasound data. Fiducial and US data were each compared with known phantom displacement. Trans-perineal 3D-US imaging could track superior-inferior (SI) and anterior-posterior (AP) motion to ≤0.81 mm root-mean-square error (RMSE) at a 1.7 Hz volume rate. The maximum kV x-ray tracking RMSE was 0.74 mm, however the prostate motion was sampled at a significantly lower imaging rate (mean: 0.04 Hz). Initial elevational (right-left; RL) US displacement estimates showed reduced accuracy but could be improved (RMSE <2.0 mm) using a correlation threshold in the ultrasound tracking code to remove erroneous inter-volume displacement estimates. Mechanically-swept 3D-US can track the major components of intra-fraction prostate motion accurately but exhibits some limitations. The largest US RMSE was for elevational (RL) motion. For the AP and SI axes, accuracy was sub-millimetre. It may be feasible to track prostate motion in 2D only. 3D-US also has the potential to improve high tracking accuracy for all motion types.

Patients and methods:   Between April 2012 and February 2013, 36 patients undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer were enrolled to receive either placebo or famotidine. The patients received external-beam radiotherapy up to 70 Gy at daily fractions of 1.8-2 Gy (5 days/week). Oral famotidine 40 mg (80 mg/day) or placebo was administered twice daily (4 and 3 h prior to each radiotherapy fraction). Bowel and bladder acute toxicities were evaluated weekly during radiotherapy and once thereafter according to RTOG grading criteria.  Results:   Famotidine was well tolerated. No grade III or higher acute toxicities were noted in the two groups.

On biopsy, PNI is 1 of the 4 pathognomonic features of PCa; it is associated with an increased risk for extraprostatic extension, and its finding can affect therapy. From January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013, 3120 cases of PCa were seen by the Genitourinary Pathology Consultation Service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Of these, 418 (13.4%) had PNI. During this interval, we prospectively identified an unusual pattern of PNI, which we have termed ""pseudohyperplastic PNI,"" which was defined by a ""gland-within-gland"" morphology, wherein the centrally located gland was wrapped around a nerve. Pseudohyperplastic PNI was found in 9 (2.1%) cases, with an additional 3 cores from 2 patients biopsied at our institution with this finding also included. Of the 12 cores with pseudohyperplastic PNI, the Gleason scores were 6 in 11 cores and 4+3=7 in the remaining core. In 6 cases, the only focus of PNI in the entire case was pseudohyperplastic. In 7 of the 12 foci, the central gland wrapping around the nerve appeared to ""float"" unattached within the surrounding gland closely resembling a benign hyperplastic gland or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). In the remaining 5 foci, the central PNI was focally attached to the outer gland. In 11 of 12 foci, there was no to mild cytologic atypia. One focus of pseudohyperplastic PNI had prominent nucleoli in a large gland with tufting architecture and foamy cytoplasm. Of the 9 consult cases, pseudohyperplastic PNI was missed in 5, and in all 5 cases PNI was initially not diagnosed in the entire case. In 2 of these cases with missed pseudohyperplastic PNI, PCa was not diagnosed at the outside institution. In 1 of the cases biopsied at our institution, pseudohyperplastic PNI was misdiagnosed as HGPIN. In addition to the morphology of cancer appearing to float within a surrounding gland, other features that contribute to the difficulty of recognizing the focus as cancer are: (1) lack of adjacent cancer in about one half of the foci; (2) larger glands than typical cancer surrounding the PNI in a minority of cases; (3) tufting of the gland surrounding the PNI in a few cases; (4) atrophic or foamy gland features in some cases; and (5) lack of prominent cytologic atypia in most cases. Although this pattern of PNI that mimics either a benign hyperplastic gland or HGPIN is uncommon, accurately recognizing it as carcinoma can have both diagnostic and prognostic implications.""","""['Jeffrey S So', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['High-grade foamy gland prostatic adenocarcinoma on biopsy or transurethral resection: a morphologic study of 55 cases.', 'Pseudohyperplastic prostatic adenocarcinoma on needle biopsy and simple prostatectomy.', 'Pseudohyperplastic prostate carcinoma: histologic patterns and differential diagnosis.', 'Pseudohyperplastic prostate adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells mimicking hyperplastic colonic polyp and associated high grade foamy gland carcinoma.

The assay strategy was achieved on a sensing interface that was formed by hybridization of methylene blue (MB)-labeled antibody-DNA probe (MB-DNA1-Ab1) with ferrocene (Fc)-labeled DNA capture probe (Fc-P) modified gold electrode. On the interface the target protein could trigger the formation of immunocomplex between MB-DNA1-Ab1 and detection antibody-DNA probe (Ab2-DNA2) and subsequently the proximity hybridization of DNA1-DNA2, which led to the departure of MB-DNA1-Ab1 from the interface. The remained Fc-P could form a hairpin structure to take Fc group to electrode surface. Therefore, the recognition of target protein to Ab1 and Ab2 resulted in both the ""signal-off"" of MB and the ""signal-on"" of Fc for dual-signal electrochemical ratiometric readout.

Abnormal miRNA function has been implicated in various human cancers including prostate cancer (PCa). Altered miRNA expression may serve as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, limited data are available on the role of cancer-specific miRNAs. Integrative computational bioinformatics approaches are effective for the detection of potential outlier miRNAs in cancer.  Methods:   The human miRNA-mRNA target network was reconstructed by integrating multiple miRNA-mRNA interaction datasets. Paired miRNA and mRNA expression profiling data in PCa versus benign prostate tissue samples were used as another source of information. These datasets were analyzed with an integrated bioinformatics framework to identify potential PCa miRNA signatures. In vitro q-PCR experiments and further systematic analysis were used to validate these prediction results.  Results:   Using this bioinformatics framework, we identified 39 miRNAs as potential PCa miRNA signatures. Among these miRNAs, 20 had previously been identified as PCa aberrant miRNAs by low-throughput methods, and 16 were shown to be deregulated in other cancers. In vitro q-PCR experiments verified the accuracy of these predictions. miR-648 was identified as a novel candidate PCa miRNA biomarker. Further functional and pathway enrichment analysis confirmed the association of the identified miRNAs with PCa progression.  Conclusions:   Our analysis revealed the scale-free features of the human miRNA-mRNA interaction network and showed the distinctive topological features of existing cancer miRNA biomarkers from previously published studies. A novel cancer miRNA biomarker prediction framework was designed based on these observations and applied to prostate cancer study. This method could be applied for miRNA biomarker prediction in other cancers.""","""['Wenyu Zhang', 'Jin Zang', 'Xinhua Jing', 'Zhandong Sun', 'Wenying Yan', 'Dongrong Yang', 'Bairong Shen', 'Feng Guo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Biomarker microRNAs for prostate cancer metastasis: screened with a network vulnerability analysis model.', 'Meta-analysis of miRNA expression profiles for prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Construction and analysis of mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and TF regulatory networks reveal the key genes associated with prostate cancer.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Prostate Cancer Biomarkers.', 'miRNAs as novel biomarkers in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'A novel platform using homobifunctional hydrazide for enrichment and isolation of urinary circulating RNAs.', 'A Novel Strategy for Identifying NSCLC MicroRNA Biomarkers and Their Mechanism Analysis Based on a Brand-New CeRNA-Hub-FFL Network.', 'Identification of key miRNAs in prostate cancer progression based on miRNA-mRNA network construction.', 'Communication between cells: exosomes as a delivery system in prostate cancer.']"""

Muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE) has been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis without affecting normal prostate epithelial cells. We investigated novel molecular mechanisms by which Snail promotes EMT in prostate cancer cells via Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and whether it can be antagonized by MSKE.  Methods:   ARCaP and LNCaP cells overexpressing Snail were utilized to examine levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically, superoxide, in vitro using Dihydroethidium (DHE) or HydroCy3 dyes. Mitosox staining was performed to determine whether the source of ROS was mitochondrial in origin. We also investigated the effect of Muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE) on EMT marker expression by western blot analysis. Migration and cell viability using MTS proliferation assay was performed following MSKE treatments.  Results:   Snail overexpression in ARCaP and LNCaP cells was associated with increased concentration of mitochondrial superoxide, in vitro. Interestingly, MSKE decreased superoxide levels in ARCaP and LNCaP cells. Additionally, MSKE and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) reverted EMT as evidenced by decreased vimentin levels and re-induction of E-cadherin expression in ARCaP-Snail cells after 3 days, concomitant with reduced cell migration. MSKE also decreased Stat-3 activity in ARCaP-Snail cells.  Conclusions:   This study shows that superoxide species may play a role in Snail transcription factor-mediated EMT. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of Snail with various antioxidants such as MSKE may prove beneficial in abrogating EMT and ROS-mediated tumor progression in human prostate cancer.""","""['Liza J Burton', 'Petrina Barnett', 'Basil Smith', 'Rebecca S Arnold', 'Tamaro Hudson', 'Kousik Kundu', 'Niren Murthy', 'Valerie A Odero-Marah']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Complement Altern Med""","""['Val16A SOD2 Polymorphism Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Antagonized by Muscadine Grape Skin Extract in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Muscadine grape skin extract can antagonize Snail-cathepsin L-mediated invasion, migration and osteoclastogenesis in prostate and breast cancer cells.', 'Snail-mediated regulation of reactive oxygen species in ARCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'The novel role of Yin Yang 1 in the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in cancer via the dysregulated NF-κB/Snail/YY1/RKIP/PTEN Circuitry.', 'Mediterranean Diet Food Components as Possible Adjuvant Therapies to Counteract Breast and Prostate Cancer Progression to Bone Metastasis.', 'Studies of hormonal regulation, phenotype plasticity, bone metastasis, and experimental therapeutics in androgen-repressed human prostate cancer (ARCaP) model.', 'Val16A SOD2 Polymorphism Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Antagonized by Muscadine Grape Skin Extract in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Grape Powder Supplementation Attenuates Prostate Neoplasia Associated with Pten Haploinsufficiency in Mice Fed High-Fat Diet.', 'Restoring E-cadherin Expression by Natural Compounds for Anticancer Therapies in Genital and Urinary Cancers.']"""

Because SBRT may deliver a greater biologic dose of radiation than IMRT, toxicity could be increased. Studies comparing treatment cost to the Medicare program and toxicity are needed.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective study by using a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries age ≥ 66 years who received SBRT or IMRT as primary treatment for prostate cancer from 2008 to 2011. Each SBRT patient was matched to two IMRT patients with similar follow-up (6, 12, or 24 months). We calculated the cost of radiation therapy treatment to the Medicare program and toxicity as measured by Medicare claims; we used a random effects model to compare genitourinary (GU), GI, and other toxicity between matched patients.  Results:   The study sample consisted of 1,335 SBRT patients matched to 2,670 IMRT patients. The mean treatment cost was $13,645 for SBRT versus $21,023 for IMRT. In the 6 months after treatment initiation, 15.6% of SBRT versus 12.6% of IMRT patients experienced GU toxicity (odds ratio [OR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.53; P = .009). At 24 months after treatment initiation, 43.9% of SBRT versus 36.3% of IMRT patients had GU toxicity (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.63; P = .001). The increase in GU toxicity was due to claims indicative of urethritis, urinary incontinence, and/or obstruction.  Conclusion:   Although SBRT was associated with lower treatment costs, there appears to be a greater rate of GU toxicity for patients undergoing SBRT compared with IMRT, and prospective correlation with randomized trials is needed.""","""['James B Yu', 'Laura D Cramer', 'Jeph Herrin', 'Pamela R Soulos', 'Arnold L Potosky', 'Cary P Gross']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Stereotactic body radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: less cost at the expense of more genitourinary toxicity is a concerning but testable hypothesis.', 'Prostate cancer: radiotherapy-treating patients in a fast-moving field.', 'Regarding relative toxicities of stereotactic body radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Perils of comparing toxicities between stereotactic body radiation and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer on the basis of incomplete demographic registries.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer: the need to assess patient-reported outcomes.', 'Toxicity of stereotactic body radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a potential comparison bias.', 'Reply to K.

We assessed the prognostic value of CTCs for overall survival (OS) and disease response in S0421, a phase III trial of docetaxel plus prednisone with or without atrasentan.  Patients and methods:   CTCs were enumerated at baseline (day 0) and before cycle two (day 21) using CellSearch. Baseline counts and changes in counts from day 0 to 21 were evaluated for association with OS, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and RECIST response using Cox regression as well as receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis, and regression trees.  Results:   Median day-0 CTC count was five cells per 7.5 mL, and CTCs < versus ≥ five per 7.5 mL were significantly associated with baseline PSA, bone pain, liver disease, hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and subsequent PSA and RECIST response. Median OS was 26 months for < five versus 13 months for ≥ five CTCs per 7.5 mL at day 0 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.74 [adjusting for covariates]). ROC curves had higher areas under the curve for day-0 CTCs than for PSA, and IDI analysis showed that adding day-0 CTCs to baseline PSA and other covariates increased predictive accuracy for survival by 8% to 10%. Regression trees yielded new prognostic subgroups, and rising CTC count from day 0 to 21 was associated with shorter OS (HR, 2.55).  Conclusion:   These data validate the prognostic utility of CTC enumeration in a large docetaxel-based prospective cohort. Baseline CTC counts were prognostic, and rising CTCs at 3 weeks heralded significantly worse OS, potentially serving as an early metric to help redirect and optimize therapy in this clinical setting.""","""['Amir Goldkorn', 'Benjamin Ely', 'David I Quinn', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Louis M Fink', 'Tong Xu', 'Przemyslaw Twardowski', 'Peter J Van Veldhuizen', 'Neeraj Agarwal', 'Michael A Carducci', 'J Paul Monk rd', 'Ram H Datar', 'Mark Garzotto', 'Philip C Mack', 'Primo Lara Jr', 'Celestia S Higano', 'Maha Hussain', 'Ian Murchie Thompson Jr', 'Richard J Cote', 'Nicholas J Vogelzang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['The end of the beginning: circulating tumor cells as a biomarker in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination of circulating tumor cell enumeration and tumor marker detection in predicting prognosis and treatment effect in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Serum biomarkers of bone metabolism in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with skeletal metastases: results from SWOG 0421.', 'Circulating tumor cell telomerase activity as a prognostic marker for overall survival in SWOG 0421: a phase III metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer trial.', 'Docetaxel and atrasentan versus docetaxel and placebo for men with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (SWOG S0421): a randomised phase 3 trial.', 'Circulating tumor cells as a biomarker predictive of sensitivity to docetaxel chemotherapy in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Circulating tumour cells for early detection of clinically relevant cancer.', 'Clinical Validation of a Size-Based Microfluidic Device for Circulating Tumor Cell Isolation and Analysis in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Utilization of Circulating Tumor Cells in the Management of Solid Tumors.', 'Baseline CTC Count as a Predictor of Long-Term Outcomes in High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Correlation between mesenchymal circulating tumor cells and prognosis of urologic malignancies: a single-center retrospective analysis.']"""

Materials and methods:   Seventy patients underwent phased-array coil 3T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before prostatectomy. A uropathologist mapped locations and Gleason 4 percentage (G4%) of Gleason 7 tumors. Two radiologists independently reviewed ADC maps, aware of tumor locations but not G4%, and placed a volume-of-interest (VOI) on all slices including each lesion on the ADC map to obtain whole-lesion mean ADC and ADC entropy. Entropy reflects textural variation and increases with greater macroscopic heterogeneity. Performance for characterizing Gleason 7 tumors was assessed with mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression.  Results:   Among 84 Gleason 7 tumors (G4% 5%-85%, median 30%; 59 Gleason 3+4, 25 Gleason 4+3), ADC entropy was significantly higher in Gleason 4+3 than Gleason 3+4 tumors (R1: 5.27 ± 0.61 vs. 4.62 ± 0.78, P = 0.001; R2: 5.91 ± 0.32 vs. 5.57 ± 0.56, P = 0.004); mean ADC was not significantly different between these groups (R1: 0.90 ± 0.15*10(-3) cm(2) /s vs. 0.98 ± 0.21*10(-3) cm(2) /s, P = 0.075; R2: 1.06 ± 0.19*10(-3) cm(2) /s vs. 1.14 ± 0.16*10(-3) cm(2) /s, P = 0.083). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for differentiating groups was significantly higher with ADC entropy than mean ADC for one observer (R1: 0.74 vs. 0.57, P = 0.027; R2: 0.69 vs. 0.61, P = 0.329). For R1, correlation with G4% was moderate for ADC entropy (r = 0.45) and weak for mean ADC (r = -0.25). For R2, correlation with G4% was moderate for ADC entropy (r = 0.41) and mean ADC (r = -0.32). For both readers, ADC entropy (P = 0.028-0.003), but not mean ADC (P = 0.384-0.854), was a significant independent predictor of G4%.

TM includes naïve fibroblasts that are recruited by nascent neoplastic lesion and altered into 'cancer-associated fibroblasts' (CAFs) that promote PCA. A better understanding and targeting of interaction between PCA cells and fibroblasts and inhibiting CAF phenotype through non-toxic agents are novel approaches to prevent PCA progression. One well-studied cancer chemopreventive agent is silibinin, and thus, we examined its efficacy against PCA cells-mediated differentiation of naïve fibroblasts into a myofibroblastic-phenotype similar to that found in CAFs. Silibinin's direct inhibitory effect on the phenotype of CAFs derived directly from PCA patients was also assessed. Human prostate stromal cells (PrSCs) exposed to control conditioned media (CCM) from human PCA PC3 cells showed more invasiveness, with increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and vimentin expression, and differentiation into a phenotype we identified in CAFs. Importantly, silibinin (at physiologically achievable concentrations) inhibited α-SMA expression and invasiveness in differentiated fibroblasts and prostate CAFs directly, as well as indirectly by targeting PCA cells. The observed increase in α-SMA and CAF-like phenotype was transforming growth factor (TGF) β2 dependent, which was strongly inhibited by silibinin. Furthermore, induction of α-SMA and CAF phenotype by CCM were also strongly inhibited by a TGFβ2-neutralizing antibody. The inhibitory effect of silibinin on TGFβ2 expression and CAF-like biomarkers was also observed in PC3 tumors. Together, these findings highlight the potential usefulness of silibinin in PCA prevention through targeting the CAF phenotype in the prostate TM.""","""['Harold J Ting', 'Gagan Deep', 'Anil K Jain', 'Adela Cimic', 'Joseph Sirintrapun', 'Lina M Romero', 'Scott D Cramer', 'Chapla Agarwal', 'Rajesh Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Beneficial effects of the naturally occurring flavonoid silibinin on the prostate cancer microenvironment: role of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and immune cell recruitment.', 'Silibinin inhibits fibronectin induced motility, invasiveness and survival in human prostate carcinoma PC3 cells via targeting integrin signaling.', 'Silibinin inhibits prostate cancer cells- and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by targeting NFATc1, NF-κB, and AP-1 activation in RAW264.7 cells.', 'Prostate cancer prevention by silibinin.', 'A cancer chemopreventive agent silibinin, targets mitogenic and survival signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells via autophagy : Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate cancer development.', 'Immunotherapy for lung cancer combining the oligodeoxynucleotides of TLR9 agonist and TGF-β2 inhibitor.', 'Anti-prostate cancer protection and therapy in the framework of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine - comprehensive effects of phytochemicals in primary, secondary and tertiary care.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of Silymarin in Cancer Treatment: Facts, Hypotheses, and Questions.']"""

CPD and NO levels are upregulated by testosterone (T) and prolactin (PRL) to promote survival of prostate cancer (pCa) cells. This study evaluated CPD immunostaining and T/PRL regulation of CPD and NO levels in benign and malignant prostate tissues/cells to determine the role of CPD in pCa.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tissue microarrays (TMA) were used to determine CPD immunostaining in prostate specimens. QPCR and immunoblotting were used to quantify CPD mRNA/protein expression in prostate cells. NO production was measured using 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate assay.  Results:   CPD staining increased from 8.9 ± 3.8% (Mean ± SEM, n = 15) of benign epithelial cell area to 30.9 ± 2.9% (n = 30) of tumor cell area in one set of TMAs (P = 0.0008) and from 5.9 ± 0.9% (n = 45) of benign epithelial cell area to 18.8 ± 1.9% (n = 55) of tumor area in another (P < 0.0001). IHC of prostate tissues (≥50 mm(2)) confirmed increased CPD staining, from 13.1 ± 2.9% in benign (n = 16) to 29.5 ± 4.4% in pCa (n = 31, P = 0.0095). T and/or PRL increased CPD expression in several pCa but not benign cell lines. T and PRL acted synergistically to increase NO production, which was abolished only when receptor antagonists flutamide and Δ1-9-G129R-hPRL were used together.  Conclusions:   CPD immunostaining and T/PRL-stimulated CPD expression were higher in pCa than benign tissues/cells. Elevated CPD increased NO production, which was abolished when both AR and PRLR were inhibited.

Small molecule based inhibitors of PSMA have promised to provide sensitive detection of primary and metastatic prostate tumors. Although significant progress has been made, many of the radiolabeled imaging agents exhibit non-specific background binding. Prevailing tracer designs focus on high affinity urea-based inhibitors with strategically placed hydrophobic patches that interact favorably with the substrate tunnel of PSMA. We hypothesized that a novel PSMA inhibitor design incorporating highly negatively charged linkers may minimize non-specific binding and decrease overall background.  Methods:   Through iterative redesign, we generated a series of PSMA inhibitors with highly negatively charged linkers that connect to urea inhibitors and bulky radionuclide chelates. We then performed in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies with the radiolabeled tracers.  Results:   The tracers derived from our iterative redesign have affinities for PSMA comparable to the ""parent"" urea ligand Cys-C(O)-Glu. Using a fluorine-18 labeled PSMA targeting tracer, we found that these highly negatively charged molecules exhibit rapid renal excretion with minimal non-specific binding. The biodistribution data at 2 hr showed 4.6%ID/g PC3-PIP tumor uptake with spleen, liver, bone, and blood background levels of 0.1%, 0.17%, 0.1%, and 0.04%, respectively.

The role of CD44 variant 6 (CD44v6) in CaP progression and therapeutic resistance is still uncertain. Here, we investigated the roles of CD44v6 in CaP metastasis and chemo/radioresistance. Expression of CD44v6 in metastatic CaP cell lines, human primary CaP tissues and lymph node metastases was assessed using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively.  Methods:   Knock down (KD) of CD44v6 was performed in PC-3M, DU145, and LNCaP cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and confirmed by confocal microscope, Western blot and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell growth was evaluated by proliferation and colony formation assays. The adhesive ability and invasive potential were assessed using a hyaluronic acid (HA) adhesion and a matrigel chamber assay, respectively. Tumorigenesis potential and chemo-/radiosensitivity were measured by a sphere formation assay and a colony assay, respectively.  Results:   Over-expression of CD44v6 was found in primary CaP tissues and lymph node metastases including cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells. KD of CD44v6 suppressed CaP proliferative, invasive and adhesive abilities, reduced sphere formation, enhanced chemo-/radiosensitivity, and down-regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway proteins in vitro.  Conclusions:   Our findings demonstrate that CD44v6 is an important cancer stem cell-like marker associated with CaP proliferation, invasion, adhesion, metastasis, chemo-/radioresistance, and the induction of EMT as well as the activation PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Wnt signaling pathways, suggesting that CD44v6 is a novel therapeutic target to sensitize CaP cells to chemo/radiotherapy.""","""['Jie Ni', 'Paul J Cozzi', 'Jing L Hao', 'Julia Beretov', 'Lei Chang', 'Wei Duan', 'Sarah Shigdar', 'Warick J Delprado', 'Peter H Graham', 'Joseph Bucci', 'John H Kearsley', 'Yong Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'CD44 variant 6 is associated with prostate cancer growth and chemo-/radiotherapy response in vivo.', 'Acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell phenotypes is associated with activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'Emerging roles of radioresistance in prostate cancer metastasis and radiation therapy.', 'CD147/EMMPRIN and CD44 are potential therapeutic targets for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems targeting cancer cell surfaces.', 'Generation of peptides using phage display technology for cancer diagnosis and molecular imaging.', 'Mutant Allele of CD44 (rs8193C>T) and Pum2 Regulatory Element as A Prognosis Factor of Prostate Neoplasms: A Case-Control and In Silico Studies.', 'CD44v6+ Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Maintain Stemness Properties through Met/cJun/Nanog Signaling.', 'The emerging role of exosomes in radiotherapy.']"""

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and AR share several transcriptional targets, including the anti-apoptotic genes serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) and Map kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1)/dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1). Because GR expression increases in a subset of primary prostate cancer (PC) following androgen deprivation therapy, we sought to determine whether GR activation can contribute to resistance to AR-directed therapy. We studied CWR-22Rv1 and LAPC4 AR/GR-expressing PC cell lines following treatment with combinations of the androgen R1881, AR antagonist MDV3100, GR agonist dexamethasone, GR antagonists mifepristone and CORT 122928, or the SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394. Cell lines stably expressing GR (NR3C1)-targeted shRNA or ectopic SGK1-Flag were also studied in vivo. GR activation diminished the effects of the AR antagonist MDV3100 on tumor cell viability. In addition, GR activation increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) secretion and induced SGKI and MKP1/DUSP gene expression. Glucocorticoid-mediated cell viability was diminished by a GR antagonist or by co-treatment with the SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394. In vivo, GR depletion delayed castrate-resistant tumor formation, while SGK1-Flag-overexpressing PC xenografts displayed accelerated castrate-resistant tumor initiation, supporting a role for SGK1 in GR-mediated CRPC progression. We studied several PC models before and following treatment with androgen blockade and found that increased GR expression and activity contributed to tumor-promoting PC cell viability. Increased GR-regulated SGK1 expression appears, at least in part, to mediate enhanced PC cell survival. Therefore, GR and/or SGK1 inhibition may be useful adjuncts to AR blockade for treating CRPC.""","""['Masis Isikbay', 'Kristen Otto', 'Steven Kregel', 'Jacob Kach', 'Yi Cai', 'Donald J Vander Griend', 'Suzanne D Conzen', 'Russell Z Szmulewitz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Development of a small-molecule serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 antagonist and its evaluation as a prostate cancer therapeutic.', 'Development and exploitation of a novel mutant androgen receptor modelling strategy to identify new targets for advanced prostate cancer therapy.', 'Serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 expression in primary human prostate cancers.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Induction of SGK1 via glucocorticoid-influenced clinical outcome of triple-negative breast cancer patients.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Glucocorticoid regulation of cancer development and progression.', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor and β-Catenin Interact in Prostate Cancer Cells and Their Co-Inhibition Attenuates Tumorsphere Formation, Stemness, and Docetaxel Resistance.']"""

We investigated sub-cellular distribution of apigenin, it's binding to DNA and protective effects against H2O2-induced DNA damage using transformed human prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells and prostate cancer LNCaP, PC-3 and DU145 cells. Exposure of cells to apigenin exhibited higher accumulation in RWPE-1 and LNCaP cells, compared to PC-3 and DU145 cells. The kinetics of apigenin uptake in LNCaP cells was estimated with a Km value of 5 µmole/L and Vmax of 190 pmoles/million cells/h. Sub-cellular fractionation demonstrated that nuclear matrix retains the highest concentration of apigenin (45.3%), followed by cytosol (23.9%), nuclear membranes (17.9%) and microsomes (12.9%), respectively. Spectroscopic analysis of apigenin with calf-thymus DNA exhibited intercalation as the dominant binding mode to DNA duplex. Apigenin exposure resulted in significant genoprotective effects in H2O2-stressed RWPE-1 cells by reduction in reactive oxygen species levels. In addition, apigenin exposure suppressed the formation of 8-hydroxy-2' deoxyguanosine and protected exposed cells from apoptosis. Our studies demonstrate that apigenin is readily taken up by normal prostatic epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells, and is incorporated into their nuclei, where its intercalation with nucleic acid bases may account for its antioxidant and chemopreventive activities.""","""['Haripaul Sharma', 'Rajnee Kanwal', 'Natarajan Bhaskaran', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Protection against oxidative DNA damage and stress in human prostate by glutathione S-transferase P1.', 'Apigenin drives the production of reactive oxygen species and initiates a mitochondrial mediated cell death pathway in prostate epithelial cells.', 'Protection of androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells from oxidative stress-induced DNA damage by overexpression of clusterin and its modulation by androgen.', 'The defense mechanisms in mammalian cells against oxidative damage in nucleic acids and their involvement in the suppression of mutagenesis and cell death.', 'Antioxidant vitamins and cancer risk: is oxidative damage to DNA a relevant biomarker?', 'Phytochemical Analysis, Antimutagenic and Antiviral Activity of Moringa oleifera L.

The definition of BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP) bears important implications for patient counseling and management; however, there remains a significant debate regarding the appropriate definition.  Methods:   The study cohort consisted of 3619 men who underwent RP for localized prostate cancer from 1989 to 2007, with data abstracted from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) registry. Patients were stratified into three risk groups according to Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment post-Surgical (CAPRA-S) score. Three single threshold PSA cut-points for BCR were evaluated (PSA > or =0.05, > or =0.2 and > or =0.4 ng ml(-1)) as well as a variable cut-point defined by risk group. After reaching the cut-points, patients were followed for further PSA progression.  Results:   The proportion of patients with BCR differed by cut-point and risk group, ranging from 7 to 37% (low risk), 22 to 58% (intermediate risk) and 60 to 86% (high risk). The positive-predictive value (PPV) for predicting further PSA progression was 49% for the PSA > or =0.05 ng ml(-1), 62% for the PSA > or =0.2 ng ml(-1), 65% for the PSA > or =0.4 ng ml(-1) and 68% for the risk-adjusted definition. Five-year progression-free survival was 39% for the risk-adjusted definition compared with 45-52% for the other definitions of BCR.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that a variable definition of BCR determined by clinicopathologic risk may improve the identification of early recurrence after RP without increasing the overdiagnosis of BCR. By using a risk-adjusted BCR definition, clinicians can better predict future PSA progression and more appropriately counsel patients regarding salvage therapies.""","""['T M Morgan', 'M V Meng', 'M R Cooperberg', 'J E Cowan', 'V Weinberg', 'P R Carroll', 'D W Lin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Optimal definition of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy depends on pathologic risk factors: identifying candidates for early salvage therapy.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes in patients with clinically high-risk prostate cancer treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from a multi-institutional study of 1100 patients.', 'Markers and meaning of primary treatment failure.', 'Natural history of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: risk assessment for secondary therapy.', 'Event-free survival after radical prostatectomy according to prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography and European Association of Urology biochemical recurrence risk groups.', 'Genomic Heterogeneity Within Individual Prostate Cancer Foci Impacts Predictive Biomarkers of Targeted Therapy.', 'Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage Radiation Therapy Following Radical Prostatectomy for Men with Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

The expression levels of components of the NF-κB pathway (p65 and IκBα) were evaluated at the mRNA level in infected PC-3 cells at different time points (1, 6, 12 and 24 h) after infection. The expression levels of inflammation-related genes, components of the Toll-like receptor pathway and genes involved in NF-κB activation were analyzed in infected and uninfected cells using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We detected a significant increase (p < 0.001) in inflammation-related cytokines in infected PC-3 cells. During infection, PC-3 cells elicited a proinflammatory response, as shown by NF-κB activation, TLR2 and TLR4 upregulation and the increased expression of inflammation-related genes. Furthermore, we observed significant upregulation of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VEGF, which are two biomarkers correlated with tumor progression and immune system evasion. The present study suggests that human prostate cancer epithelial cells are susceptible to C. trachomatis infection and upregulate proinflammatory markers during infection.""","""['Hanen Sellami', 'Najwane Said-Sadier', 'Abir Znazen', 'Radhouane Gdoura', 'David M Ojcius', 'Adnene Hammami']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cell Probes""","""['Expression of TLR 2, TLR 4 and iNOS in cervical monocytes of Chlamydia trachomatis-infected women and their role in host immune response.', 'Differential regulation of inflammatory cytokine secretion by human dendritic cells upon Chlamydia trachomatis infection.', 'Susceptibility of prostate epithelial cells to Chlamydia muridarum infection and their role in innate immunity by recruitment of intracellular Toll-like receptors 4 and 2 and MyD88 to the inclusion.', 'Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the male genital tract: an update.', 'TLRs: linking inflammation and breast cancer.', 'Better In Vitro Tools for Exploring Chlamydia trachomatis Pathogenesis.', 'Chlamydia trachomatis L2/434/Bu Favors Hypoxia for its Growth in Human Lymphoid Jurkat Cells While Maintaining Production of Proinflammatory Cytokines.', 'Multiple pathogens and prostate cancer.', 'In Vitro Modelling of Chlamydia trachomatis Infection in the Etiopathogenesis of Male Infertility and Reactive Arthritis.', 'Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes as a Novel Treatment for Female Infertility Caused by Bacterial Infections.']"""

There can be large glands with straight luminal borders. These tumors are not only difficult to diagnose but they are also difficult to grade as Gleason scoring system does not account for this histologic pattern. Some of these tumors have shown extraprostatic extension and it has been recommended that pseudohyperplastic adenocarcinoma should not be regarded as a low grade cancer.

Methods and materials:   We examined 30 consecutive low dose rate prostate cases performed by standard intraoperative technique of planning followed by needle placement/seed deposition and compared them to 30 consecutive low dose rate prostate cases performed by the HELP technique.

Methods:   Incidence data were collected from 21 local registries and correspond to invasive cancers diagnosed between 1975 and 2009. Mortality data for the same period were provided by the Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale. The national incidence estimates were based on the use of mortality as a correlate of incidence. The observed incidence and mortality data were modeled using an age-period-cohort model. The numbers of incident cases and deaths for 2010-2012 are the result of short-term projections.  Results:   In 2012, the study estimated that 355,000 new cases of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 148,000 deaths from cancer occurred in France. The incidence trend was not linear over the study period. After a constant increase from 1980 onwards, the incidence of cancer in men declined between 2005 and 2012. This recent decrease is largely related to the reduction in the incidence of prostate cancer. In women, the rates stabilized, mainly due to a change in breast cancer incidence. Mortality from most cancer types declined over the study period. A combined analysis of incidence and mortality by cancer site distinguished cancers with declining incidence and mortality (e.g., stomach) and cancers with increasing incidence and mortality (e.g., lung cancer in women). Some other cancers had rising incidence but declining mortality (e.g., thyroid).

Methods and materials:   Dose-volume constraints were defined delivering a prescription dose of 8.5Gy for CTV1 (whole prostate) and 15Gy for CTV2 (peripheral zone). A total of 38 implants of 20 patients were inversely planned using the constraints and dose indices (D90 CTV1,2; V200 CTV1,2; D2 cc rectum; D0.1 cc urethra; dose nonhomogeneity ratio; and conformal index) compared against those derived from conventional planning (CP).  Results:   The inversely planned (IP) treatment plans showed similar target volume coverage than by CP. The value of D90 CTV1 for CP was 5.62Gy and 5.63Gy for IPs. For CTV2, the D90 was also similar between both methods: 11.03Gy and 10.89Gy, respectively. Only V200 CTV2 was found to be significantly lower for CP than for IP: 5.76% vs. 8.14% (p<0.01). Values for D0.1 cc urethra were found to be: 9.57Gy and 9.02Gy, respectively. Rectal dosimetry: D2 cc Rectum was quite stable with 6.04Gy and 6.12Gy for CP and IP, respectively. The conformal index and dose nonhomogeneity ratio values for CTV1 and CTV2 for both planning types were very similar.

Results of that work also posed the hypothesis that the OVOLs impact MET in a range of cancers. We now test this hypothesis by developing a model, OVOL Induced MET (OI-MET), and sub-model (OI-MET-TF), to characterize differential gene expression in MET common to prostate cancer (PC) and breast cancer (BC).  Results:   In the OI-MET model, we identified 739 genes differentially expressed in both the PC and BC models. For this gene set, we found significant enrichment of annotation for BC, PC, cancer, and MET, as well as regulation of gene expression by AP1, STAT1, STAT3, and NFKB1. Focusing on the target genes for these four TFs plus the OVOLs, we produced the OI-MET-TF sub-model, which shows even greater enrichment for these annotations, plus significant evidence of cooperation among these five TFs. Based on known gene/drug interactions, we prioritized targets in the OI-MET-TF network for follow-on analysis, emphasizing the clinical relevance of this work. Reflecting these results back to the OI-MET model, we found that binding motifs for the TF pair AP1/MYC are more frequent than expected and that the AP1/MYC pair is significantly enriched in binding in cancer models, relative to non-cancer models, in these promoters. This effect is seen in both MET models (solid tumors) and in non-MET models (leukemia). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the OVOLs impact cancer susceptibility by regulating MET, and extend the hypothesis to include mechanisms not specific to MET.  Conclusions:   We find significant evidence of the OVOL, AP1, STAT1, STAT3, and NFKB1 TFs having important roles in MET, and more broadly in cancer. We prioritize known gene/drug targets for follow-up in the clinic, and we show that the AP1/MYC TF pair is a strong candidate for intervention.""","""['Hernan Roca', 'Manjusha Pande', 'Jeffrey S Huo', 'James Hernandez', 'James D Cavalcoli', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Richard C McEachin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Syst Biol""","""['Transcription factors OVOL1 and OVOL2 induce the mesenchymal to epithelial transition in human cancer.', 'PC-TraFF: identification of potentially collaborating transcription factors using pointwise mutual information.', 'The ETS factor ESE3/EHF represses IL-6 preventing STAT3 activation and expansion of the prostate cancer stem-like compartment.', 'Epithelial mesenchymal transition Transcription Factor (TF): The structure, function and microRNA feedback loop.', 'OVOL1/2: Drivers of Epithelial Differentiation in Development, Disease, and Reprogramming.', 'Single-cell resolution of MET- and EMT-like programs in osteoblasts during zebrafish fin regeneration.', 'Shavenbaby and Yorkie mediate Hippo signaling to protect adult stem cells from apoptosis.', 'Cellular responses to human cytomegalovirus infection: Induction of a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) phenotype.', 'MicroRNA and Transcription Factor Gene Regulatory Network Analysis Reveals Key Regulatory Elements Associated with Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Discovery and validation of information theory-based transcription factor and cofactor binding site motifs.']"""

For our analyses, intermediate-risk PCa was designated as unfavourable intermediate-risk PCa if it met at least one of the following two criteria: biopsy Gleason score 4 + 3 and/or presence of ≥ 2 intermediate-risk criteria. All other men with intermediate-risk PCa were designated as having favourable intermediate-risk disease. Postoperative outcomes, including biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, were calculated and compared using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   In multivariable analysis, biopsy Gleason score 4 + 3 and multiple (≥ 2) intermediate-risk criteria were observed to be independent predictors of BCR risk among men in the intermediate-risk group undergoing RP. The favourable intermediate-risk group had a significantly higher 5-year BCR-free survival compared with the unfavourable intermediate-risk group (87.5 vs 66.5%; P < 0.001). The unfavourable intermediate-risk group had significantly higher 5-year BCR-free survival than the high-risk group (66.5 vs 47.9%; P < 0.001) while the favourable intermediate-risk group had significantly lower 5-year BCR-free survival than the low-risk group (87.5 vs 93.5%; P = 0.002).

Continence rates at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after operation were evaluated with the urinary function domain of the University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index. The desirable urine loss ratio for continent condition at 12 months after the operation was calculated. As desirable target urine loss ratio continence at 12 months was determined by using logistic analysis.  Results:   Continence rates of all patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery were 13%, 37.8%, 58.9%, and 85.8%, respectively. Continence rates of patients who achieved ≤1% of urine loss ratio within 7 days or ≤5% urine loss ratio within 3 days after catheter removal was 100% at 12 months.

Patients and methods:   In all, 140 474 patients diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer between 1995 and 2009 within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database were abstracted. Patients treated with ADT and those not receiving ADT were matched using propensity score methodology. The 10-year CAD, AMI, and SCD rates were estimated. Competing-risks regression analyses tested the association between the type of ADT (GnRH agonists vs bilateral orchidectomy) and CAD, AMI, and SCD, after adjusting for the risk of dying during follow-up.  Results:   Overall, the 10-year rates of CAD, AMI, and SCD were 25.9%, 15.6%, and 15.8%, respectively. After stratification according to ADT status (ADT-naïve vs GnRH agonists vs bilateral orchidectomy), the CAD rates were 25.1% vs 26.9% vs 23.2%, the AMI rates were 14.8% vs 16.6% vs 14.8%, and the SCD rates were 14.2% vs 17.7% vs 16.4%, respectively. In competing-risks multivariable regression analyses, the administration of GnRH agonists (all P < 0.001), but not bilateral orchidectomy (all P ≥ 0.7), was associated with higher risk of CAD, AMI, and SCD.

Propensity-score matching was performed using seven preoperative variables, and postoperative variables were compared between the groups.  Results:   A total of 581 patients who had undergone RALP were evaluated in the present study. Although preoperative characteristics were different before propensity-score matching, these differences were resolved after matching. There were no significant differences in mean length of hospital stay, estimated blood loss, intra- and postoperative complication rates, pathological stage of disease, Gleason scores, tumour volumes and positive surgical margins between the conventional RALP and Retzius-sparing RALP groups.

Nestin is important for neuronal survival and is a regulator of myogenesis but its function in malignancy is ambiguous. We show that nestin downregulation leads to a redistribution of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (pFAK, also known as PTK2) to focal adhesions and alterations in focal adhesion turnover. Nestin downregulation also leads to an increase in the protein levels of integrin α5β1 at the cell membrane, activation of integrin β1 and an increase in integrin clustering. These effects have striking consequences for cell invasion, as nestin downregulation leads to a significant increase in pFAK- and integrin-dependent matrix degradation and cell invasion.

Methods:   The study population consisted of all men aged 50 to 74 years residing in eight counties in Sweden with an early increase in prostate cancer incidence and six counties with a late increase during two time periods. Incidence of metastatic prostate cancer was investigated in the period from 2000 to 2009, and prostate cancer-specific mortality and excess mortality were investigated in the period from 1990 to 1999 and the period from 2000 to 2009 by calculating rate ratios for high- vs low-incidence counties and rate ratios for the period from 2000 to 2009 vs the period from 1990 to 1999 within these two groups.

We also examined expression of miR-133b in prostate cancer tissues, and evaluated the prognostic significance of miR-133b, as well as its target gene RB1CC1 in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.  Experimental design:   miR-133b mimics (miR-133bm) and anti-miR-133b were transfected into LNCaP and PC-3 cells. CCK-8 was used to look at cell proliferation, flow cytometric analysis was carried out to study cell cycle, and apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 activity. miR-133b expression was assessed by real-time reverse transcription PCR and in situ hybridization in prostatic cell lines and 178 prostate tissue samples, respectively. The protein level of RB1CC1 was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry in prostatic cell lines and prostate tissue samples, respectively.  Results:   Overexpression of miR-133b in LNCaP cells boosted cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression, but inhibited apoptosis; in contrast, miR-133bm promoted cell apoptosis, but suppressed cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression in PC-3 cells. In LNCaP cells, silencing of RB1CC1, a target of miR-133b, inhibited cell apoptosis, and promoted cell-cycle progression. Moreover, miR-133b expression was significantly inversely correlated with RB1CC1 expression in prostate cancer tissues.

However, the specific function of hypoxia in cancer cell invasion is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of hypoxia in invasion of prostate cancer PC3 cells and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. We found that hypoxia significantly increased the invasive activity of PC3 cells, via up-regulation of the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and the autocrine production of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). More important, TNF-α cooperated with HIF-1α in promoting stabilization of Snail, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin expression, which lead to the up-regulation of invasiveness-associated genes MMP-9, fibronectin and vimentin. Snail silencing by specific siRNA significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced invasion of PC3 cells, indicating an essential role of Snail in conferring the malignant phenotype to cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that hypoxia promoted the invasiveness of prostate cancer PC3 cells via HIF-1α- and TNF-α-induced stabilization of Snail, suggesting a signaling mechanism involving HIF-1α/TNF-α/Snail that mediates invasiveness hypoxic tumor cells in the absence of neoangiogenesis.""","""['Lei Lv', 'Jingdong Yuan', 'Tao Huang', 'Chuanhua Zhang', 'Zhineng Zhu', 'Liang Wang', 'Guosong Jiang', 'Fuqing Zeng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Biol Rep""","""['Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha mediates epidermal growth factor-induced down-regulation of E-cadherin expression and cell invasion in human ovarian cancer cells.', 'HIF-1α induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer stem cells through the Snail pathway.', 'Hypoxia suppresses E-cadherin and enhances matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression favoring esophageal carcinoma migration and invasion via hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha activation.', 'Molecular responses to hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and beyond.', 'Anti-Cancer Activity of Phytochemicals Targeting Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 Alpha.', 'Identification of gene signatures related to hypoxia and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer to aid immunotherapy and prognosis.', 'Hypoxia signaling in human health and diseases: implications and prospects for therapeutics.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition: The history, regulatory mechanism, and cancer therapeutic opportunities.', 'Acidic and Hypoxic Microenvironment in Melanoma: Impact of Tumour Exosomes on Disease Progression.', 'Exosomes in the Tumor Microenvironment: From Biology to Clinical Applications.']"""

Results:   Secretion of dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, and cortisol were drastically decreased by all test compounds at concentrations that did not affect cell viability.

The most efficient CYP17A1 inhibitors were the synthetic analogs RSVTA, RSVDA, and RSVTM. Inhibition by RSVTM was more selective on the 17,20-lyase activity than hydroxylase activity of CYP17A1. Treatment of cells with all compounds, except RSVTM, caused increased estradiol levels, which could be explained by the demonstrated inhibition of estrogen sulfate conjugation, catalyzed by SULT1E1.  Conclusions:   Our results on CYP17A1 inhibition of RSV and RSV analogs suggest a novel mechanism for chemoprevention of prostate cancer by resveratrol and the analogs. Especially RSVTM, which has a preferential inhibition on the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A1, may be a promising candidate for prostate cancer chemoprevention.""","""['Agneta Oskarsson', 'Carmela Spatafora', 'Corrado Tringali', 'Åsa Ohlsson Andersson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Resveratrol, piceatannol and analogs inhibit activation of both wild-type and T877A mutant androgen receptor.', 'Orteronel (TAK-700), a novel non-steroidal 17,20-lyase inhibitor: effects on steroid synthesis in human and monkey adrenal cells and serum steroid levels in cynomolgus monkeys.', 'Assessment of the potential of polyphenols as a CYP17 inhibitor free of adverse corticosteroid elevation.', 'The role of CYP17A1 in prostate cancer development: structure, function, mechanism of action, genetic variations and its inhibition.', 'Assessment of steroidogenesis and steroidogenic enzyme functions.', 'Plant Natural Compounds in the Treatment of Adrenocortical Tumors.', 'Distribution and metabolism of 14C-resveratrol in human prostate tissue after oral administration of a ""dietary-achievable"" or ""pharmacological"" dose: what are the implications for anticancer activity?', 'Grape Powder Supplementation Attenuates Prostate Neoplasia Associated with Pten Haploinsufficiency in Mice Fed High-Fat Diet.', 'Resveratrol Inhibits Key Steps of Steroid Metabolism in a Human Estrogen-Receptor Positive Breast Cancer Model: Impact on Cellular Proliferation.', 'Resveratrol inhibits androgen production of human adrenocortical H295R cells by lowering CYP17 and CYP21 expression and activities.']"""

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or their fragments are excellent tools for immuno-positron emission tomography (PET). In this study, PSMA-specific mAb 3/F11 and its recombinant fragments were compared for the imaging of prostate cancer in xenografts.  Methods:   Recombinant anti-PSMA antibody fragments D7-Fc and D7-CH3 were constructed by genetically fusing the binding domains of mAb 3/F11 (D7) to the human IgG3 CH3 or CH2-CH3 (Fc) domain. The fragments and the mAb 3/F11 were DOTA conjugated, tested in vitro, and radiolabeled with (64) Cu. PSMA-positive C4-2 and PSMA-negative DU 145 prostate cancer xenografts were used for PET-MR imaging and for ex vivo biodistribution.  Results:   The constructs showed strong and specific binding to PSMA-positive C4-2 cells in vitro which did not decrease after DOTA conjugation. Both tested fragments showed stable accumulation in PSMA-positive C4-2 tumors at all measured time points but reduced uptake compared to the full-length antibody. Other organs and PSMA-negative tumors showed a very low tracer uptake only 3 hr after injection, with the exception of the kidneys, which demonstrated high radioactivity uptake due to rapid renal clearance of the mAb fragments.  Conclusion:   Stable tumor uptake and fast serum clearance of the tested radiolabeled fragments was observed in this preclinical study compared to the full length mAb. Since the fragments show rapid and specific tumor uptake, the tested fragments might serve as tools for theranostic imaging with suitable isotopes for radioimmunotherapy.""","""['Stefan Wiehr', 'Patrick Bühler', 'Dorothee Gierschner', 'Philipp Wolf', 'Anna-Maria Rolle', 'Christian Kesenheimer', 'Bernd J Pichler', 'Ursula Elsässer-Beile']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['PET imaging of prostate cancer xenografts with a highly specific antibody against the prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Comparative immuno-Cerenkov luminescence and -PET imaging enables detection of PSMA+ tumors in mice using 64Cu-radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies.', 'High-resolution animal PET imaging of prostate cancer xenografts with three different 64Cu-labeled antibodies against native cell-adherent PSMA.', 'Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of genetically-engineered antibodies.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen as Target for Neuroimaging of Central Nervous System Tumors.', 'Translational immunoPET imaging using a radiolabeled GD2-specific antibody in neuroblastoma.', 'The Need to Pair Molecular Monitoring Devices with Molecular Imaging to Personalize Health.', 'ImmunoPET: Concept, Design, and Applications.', 'Novel Monoclonal Antibodies Recognizing Human Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) as Research and Theranostic Tools.', 'The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the prostate specific membrane antigen/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (PSMA/GCPII) in cancer and neurological disease.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 1,200 RP patients completed the Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale-Psychometric (PORPUS-P; range 0-100, higher is better), a prostate cancer-specific HRQoL measure, prior to RP and at 0-3 (T1), 3-9 (T2), 9-18 (T3) and 18-30 (T4) months post-RP. HRQoL changes were examined using paired t tests and a mixed-effect growth curve model. Multivariable analyses were performed to investigate demographic and treatment factors predicting the change in HRQoL.  Results:   Mean baseline PORPUS-P score, 83.1, fell to 66.5 (p < 0.001) at T1. Over time HRQoL improved but did not return to baseline (T4 mean 76.4, p < 0.001). Domain analysis revealed that sexual function (p < 0.001), sexual drive (p < 0.001), energy (p = 0.001) and bladder control (p < 0.001) failed to return to baseline at T4. Sexual function demonstrated the greatest impairment overall. The multivariable model revealed Black men experienced greater losses in global HRQoL compared with White men (coefficient -2.77, 95% CI -5.00 to -0.54, p = 0.015). High baseline HRQoL, pro-erectile aid use and bilateral nerve-sparing were significantly associated with smaller reductions in HRQoL post-RP.  Conclusion:   Overall HRQoL, sexual drive, sexual function, energy and bladder control do not return to preoperative levels within 30 months post-RP.

We found that rottlerin, a natural plant polyphenol, suppressed LRP6 expression and phosphorylation, and inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of rottlerin on LRP6 expression/phosphorylation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling were confirmed in human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cells. Mechanistically, rottlerin promoted LRP6 degradation, but had no effects on LRP6 transcriptional activity. In addition, rottlerin-mediated LRP6 down-regulation was unrelated to activation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

Finally, we demonstrated that rottlerin was able to suppress the expression of cyclin D1 and survivin, two targets of both Wnt/β-catenin and mTORC1 signaling, in prostate and breast cancer cells, and displayed remarkable anticancer activity with IC(50) values between 0.7 and 1.7 μM for prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cells.

The nature of this communication that allows metastatic cells to intravasate and travel through the circulation and to extravasate to colonize different organs is poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated one of the first steps in this process—the proximity and physical interaction of endothelial and metastatic cells. To do this, we developed a cell separator chamber that allows endothelial and metastatic cells to grow side by side. We have shown in our previous studies that V-ATPases at the cell surface (pmV-ATPase) are involved in angiogenesis and metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that the physical proximity/interaction between endothelial and metastatic cells expressing pmV-ATPase will increase its activity in both cell types, and such activity in turn will increase pmV-ATPase expression on the membranes of both cell types. To determine pmV-ATPase activity we measured the proton fluxes (JH+) across the cell membrane. Our data indicated that interaction between endothelial and metastatic cells elicited a significant increase of JH+ via pmV-ATPase in both cell types. Bafilomycin, a V-ATPase inhibitor, significantly decrease JH+. In contrast, JH+ of the non-metastatic cells were not affected by the endothelial cells and vice-versa. Altogether, our data reveal that one of the early consequences of endothelial and metastatic cell interaction is an increase in pmV-ATPase that helps to acidify the extracellular medium and favors protease activity.

Cytotoxicity of the BCH-containing liposomes was evaluated with neutral red, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS), and lactate dehydrogenase assays. Colony formation assays were utilized to evaluate the decrease in cell survival due to high-linear energy transfer (LET) particles resulting from (10)B thermal neutron capture.  Results:   BCH delivery by means of encapsulation in a lipid bilayer resulted in a boron uptake of 35.2 ± 4.3 μg/10(9) cells, with minimal cytotoxic effects. PC-3 cells treated with BCH and exposed to a 9.4 × 10(11) n/cm(2) thermal neutron fluence yielded a 20-25% decrease in clonogenic capacity. The decreased survival is attributed to the generation of high-LET α particles and (7)Li nuclei that deposit energy in densely ionizing radiation tracks.

Results:   Eight of the 56 patients had pelvic lymph node metastases (6 were high risk and 2 were intermediate risk according to the D'Amico's criteria).

Moreover, a significant decrease in mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (SMAD3), a key component of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathway, was induced by PTTG1 overexpression. Since SMAD3 is a ubiquitous cell-cycle inhibitor, our data suggest that PTTG1 may promote the proliferation of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting SMAD3-mediated TGFβ signaling. To identify a causal link, we expressed SMAD3 in PTTG1-overexpressing PC3 cells and found that SMAD3 expression inhibited the augmented cancer cell proliferation by PTTG1 overexpression. Furthermore, SMAD3 inhibition by short hairpin RNA (ShRNA) completely rescued the cancer cell proliferation in PTTG1 ShRNA-treated PC3 cells.

Such downregulation of DNA repair has been proposed to sensitize hypoxic cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of DNA repair. Here, we showed that prostate cancer cells with mutant p53 were resistant to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, veliparib (2-[(2R)-2-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl]-1H-benzimidazole-4-carboxamide, dihydrochloride; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), and the DNA-damaging topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin-11 (CPT-11) or SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) under hypoxia. Upregulation of Rad51 by E2F1 upon DNA damage under hypoxia contributed to such resistance, which was reversed by either inhibiting RAD51 transcription with small interfering RNA or by expressing wild-type p53 in the p53 null prostate cancer line. Accumulation of endogenous p53 but not E2F1 and suppressed RAD51 transcription was observed in prostate cancer line with wild-type p53 after DNA damage under hypoxia. Combining veliparib with CPT-11 significantly enhanced DNA damage and apoptosis under both hypoxic and normoxic culture conditions. Such enhanced DNA damage and antitumor activities were seen in the presence of Rad51 upregulation and confirmed in vivo with PC3 mouse xenografts. These data illustrate a dynamic regulation of Rad51 by E2F1 and p53 in prostate cancer cells' response to hypoxia and DNA damage.

Upregulation of RUNX2 in cell lines correlates with increased invasiveness and the capacity to form osteolytic disease in models of breast and prostate cancer. However, most studies have analysed the effects of this gene in a limited number of cell lines and its role in primary breast cancer has not been resolved. Using a human tumour tissue microarray, we show that high RUNX2 expression is significantly associated with oestrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/HER2-negative breast cancers and that patients with high RUNX2 expression have a poorer survival rate than those with negative or low expression. We confirm RUNX2 as a gene that has a potentially important functional role in triple-negative breast cancer. To investigate the role of this gene in breast cancer, we made a transgenic model in which Runx2 is specifically expressed in murine mammary epithelium under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter. We show that ectopic Runx2 perturbs normal development in pubertal and lactating animals, delaying ductal elongation and inhibiting lobular alveolar differentiation. We also show that the Runx2 transgene elicits age-related, pre-neoplastic changes in the mammary epithelium of older transgenic animals, suggesting that elevated RUNX2 expression renders such tissue more susceptible to oncogenic changes and providing further evidence that this gene might have an important, context-dependent role in breast cancer.""","""['Laura McDonald', 'Nicola Ferrari', 'Anne Terry', 'Margaret Bell', 'Zahra M Mohammed', 'Clare Orange', 'Alma Jenkins', 'William J Muller', 'Barry A Gusterson', 'James C Neil', 'Joanne Edwards', 'Joanna S Morris', 'Ewan R Cameron', 'Karen Blyth']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Dis Model Mech""","""['RUNX2 in mammary gland development and breast cancer.', 'A role for Runx2 in normal mammary gland and breast cancer bone metastasis.', 'Runx2 is a novel regulator of mammary epithelial cell fate in development and breast cancer.', 'Development of hyperplasias, preneoplasias, and mammary tumors in MMTV-c-erbB-2 and MMTV-TGFalpha transgenic rats.', 'Positive association between nuclear Runx2 and oestrogen-progesterone receptor gene expression characterises a biological subtype of breast cancer.', 'Runx2 activates hepatic stellate cells to promote liver fibrosis via transcriptionally regulating Itgav expression.', 'RUNX2 promotes gastric cancer progression through the transcriptional activation of MGAT5 and MMP13.', 'The RUNX/CBFβ Complex in Breast Cancer: A Conundrum of Context.', 'Phenotypic heterogeneity driven by plasticity of the intermediate EMT state governs disease progression and metastasis in breast cancer.', 'Bone Metastatic Breast Cancer: Advances in Cell Signaling and Autophagy Related Mechanisms.']"""

HnRNP K and AR expression were analyzed immunohistochemically in 105 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy. The association between the expression of hnRNP K and/or AR and PSA progression or death was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. The expression of hnRNP K was also investigated in vitro using the BPH-1 cell line and two different LNCaP populations that recapitulate the progression of PCa towards a more aggressive disease. AR and hnRNP K were differentially expressed between cancer and normal prostate tissues. A strong association with a good prognosis was evident in PCa exhibiting high percentage of AR-positive cells (>75%) (p≤0.005) and more interestingly, the combination of high AR and low cytoplasmic hnRNP K expression emerged as the most significant independent prognostic marker for PSA failure-free survival, in a multivariate analysis (p≤0.001). In vitro, a higher expression of hnRNP K and pERK was associated with higher PSA levels, suggesting a relationship between hnRNP K phosphorylation and AR-regulated genes.

Disturbances in the balance between these two physiological processes may lead to cell dysfunction or to cell death. Induction of cell death is the prime goal of prostate cancer chemotherapy. Our previous study demonstrated that androgens increase the expression of a mitochondrial protein involved in fission and facilitate an apoptotic response to CGP37157 (CGP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium efflux, in prostate cancer cells. However, the regulation and role of mitochondrial fusion proteins in the death of these cells have not been examined. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the effect of CGP on a key mitochondrial fusion protein, mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), and the role of Mfn1 in prostate cancer cell apoptosis. We used various prostate cancer cell lines and western blot analysis, qRT-PCR, siRNA, M30 apoptosis assay and immunoprecipitation techniques to determine mechanisms regulating Mfn1. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with CGP resulted in selective degradation of Mfn1. Mfn1 ubiquitination was detected following immunoprecipitation of overexpressed Myc-tagged Mfn1 protein from CGP-treated cells, and treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin, as well as siRNA-mediated knockdown of the E3 ubiquitin ligase March5, protected Mfn1 from CGP-induced degradation. These data indicate the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in CGP-induced degradation of Mfn1. We also demonstrated that downregulation of Mfn1 by siRNA enhanced the apoptotic response of LNCaP cells to CGP, suggesting a likely pro-survival role for Mfn1 in these cells.

Novel therapeutic options, which are currently being evaluated in patient studies, include TRAIL and the broccoli-derived isothiocyanate sulforaphane. Although neither agent targets normal cells, TRAIL induces apoptosis in most cancer cells, and sulforaphane eliminates CSCs. In this study, the established AIPC cell lines DU145 and PC3, with enriched CSC features, and primary patient-derived prostate CSCs were treated with sulforaphane and recombinant soluble TRAIL. We examined the effects of these drugs on NF-κB activity, self-renewal and differentiation potential, and stem cell signaling via spheroid- and colony-forming assays, FACS and western blot analyses, immunohistochemistry, and an antibody protein array in vitro and after xenotransplantation. We largely found a stronger effect of sulforaphane on CSC properties compared to TRAIL, though the agents acted synergistically when applied in combination. This was associated with the inhibition of TRAIL-induced NF-κB binding; CXCR4, Jagged1, Notch 1, SOX 2, and Nanog expression; ALDH1 activity inhibition; and the elimination of differentiation and self-renewal potential. In vivo, tumor engraftment and tumor growth were strongly inhibited, without the induction of liver necrosis or other obvious side effects.

In recent years, increased expression level of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) has been found to be the culprit of enhanced aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. However, there is no agent inhibiting aerobic glycolysis by targeting PKM2. In this study, we found that Oleanolic acid (OA) induced a switch from PKM2 to PKM1, and consistently, abrogated Warburg effect in cancer cells. Suppression of aerobic glycolysis by OA is mediated by PKM2/PKM1 switch. Furthermore, mTOR signaling was found to be inactivated in OA-treated cancer cells, and mTOR inhibition is required for the effect of OA on PKM2/PKM1 switch. Decreased expression of c-Myc-dependent hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA1 was responsible for OA-induced switch between PKM isoforms. Collectively, we identified that OA is an antitumor compound that suppresses aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells and there is potential that PKM2 may be developed as an important target in aerobic glycolysis pathway for developing novel anticancer agents.""","""['Jia Liu', 'Ning Wu', 'Leina Ma', 'Ming Liu', 'Ge Liu', 'Yuyan Zhang', 'Xiukun Lin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PKM2 promotes glucose metabolism and cell growth in gliomas through a mechanism involving a let-7a/c-Myc/hnRNPA1 feedback loop.', 'Dietary-phytochemical mediated reversion of cancer-specific splicing inhibits Warburg effect in head and neck cancer.', 'HnRNP proteins controlled by c-Myc deregulate pyruvate kinase mRNA splicing in cancer.', 'PKM2, cancer metabolism, and the road ahead.', 'PKM2 contributes to cancer metabolism.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Overview of Cancer Metabolism and Signaling Transduction.', 'Natural products targeting glycolytic signaling pathways-an updated review on anti-cancer therapy.', 'Targeting Glucose Metabolism Enzymes in Cancer Treatment: Current and Emerging Strategies.', 'Myeloid-Specific Pyruvate-Kinase-Type-M2-Deficient Mice Are Resistant to Acute Lung Injury.']"""

The detection rate of PCa from biopsy is typically below 30%, especially among patients with PSA levels at 4–10 ng ml−1. In the past several years, additional biomarkers, such as Prostate Health Index, PCA3 and genetic risk score (GRS) derived from multiple PCa risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to provide added value to PSA in discriminating prostate biopsy outcomes. However, the adoption rate of these novel biomarkers in clinics is low, largely due to poor understanding of the added value of novel biomarkers. To address this matter, we developed a chart to visually present (i) expected detection rates of PCa from biopsy with respect to PSA levels, and more importantly, (ii) a range of PCa detection rates at the same PSA levels when novel biomarkers are considered. This chart, called the Xu's chart for prostate biopsy, is not a formal risk prediction model; rather, a simple visual tool for urologists to communicate with their patients an initial evaluation of PCa detection rate based on their PSA levels and a possible recommendation for additional biomarkers. A more comprehensive evaluation of PCa risk using existing risk assessment tools such as nomograms can be followed once additional biomarkers are measured. The current version of the chart is only a prototype and should be further developed to include the detection rate of aggressive PCa, and validated in larger studies.""","""['Jianfeng Xu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Defining prostate cancer risk before prostate biopsy.', 'Biopsy diagnosis of prostatic cancer--current areas of concern.', 'Management of rising prostate-specific antigen following a negative biopsy.', 'PSA 2010--the beginning of a new era in early detection of prostate cancer.', 'Comment on Grond, A., M.

Between the years, 2007-13, 1486 men underwent prostate biopsy at Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. The study population was divided into two groups for analysis according to total PSA (tPSA) range (4 ng ml-1 < tPSA ≤ 20 ng ml-1 and tPSA > 20 ng ml-1 ). PV, age, tPSA, digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) results were also included in the analysis. Although the positive biopsy rates decreased in both tPSA range groups, the downtrend was more pronounced in the 4 ng ml-1 < tPSA ≤ 20 ng ml-1 group; therefore, we focused on 853 men in this group with increasing PV. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only DRE was found to be associated with PCa in four PV groups (P < 0.05) and tPSA did not show a good predictive ability when PV exceeded 50 ml (P > 0.05). Further, it may suggest that with increasing PV, the cancer detection rate decreased in men with different tPSA, DRE and TRUS nodule statuses (all P values for trends were <0.001).

Methods and materials:   All treatment plans were created by the superposition/convolution (SC) algorithm of SmartArc (Pinnacle V9.2, Philips). The beam information was converted into the format of the Monaco V3.3 (Elekta), which uses the X-ray voxel-based MC (XVMC) algorithm. The dose distribution was independently recalculated in the Monaco. The dose for the planning target volume (PTV) and the organ at risk (OAR) were analyzed via comparisons with those of the treatment plan.Before performing an independent absorbed-dose calculation, the validation was conducted via irradiation from 3 different gantry angles with a 10- × 10-cm2 field. For the independent absorbed-dose calculation, 15 patients with cancer (prostate, 5; lung, 5; head and neck, 3; rectal, 1; and esophageal, 1) who were treated with single-arc VMAT were selected. To classify the cause of the dose difference between the Pinnacle and Monaco TPSs, their calculations were also compared with the measurement data.  Result:   In validation, the dose in Pinnacle agreed with that in Monaco within 1.5%. The agreement in VMAT calculations between Pinnacle and Monaco using phantoms was exceptional; at the isocenter, the difference was less than 1.5% for all the patients. For independent absorbed-dose calculations, the agreement was also extremely good. For the mean dose for the PTV in particular, the agreement was within 2.0% in all the patients; specifically, no large difference was observed for high-dose regions. Conversely, a significant difference was observed in the mean dose for the OAR. For patients with prostate cancer, the mean rectal dose calculated in Monaco was significantly smaller than that calculated in Pinnacle.  Conclusions:   There was no remarkable difference between the SC and XVMC calculations in the high-dose regions. The difference observed in the low-dose regions may have arisen from various causes such as the intrinsic dose deviation in the MC calculation, modeling accuracy, and CT-to-density table used in each planning system It is useful to perform independent absorbed-dose calculations with the MC algorithm in intensity-modulated radiation therapy commissioning.""","""['Akihiro Haga', 'Taiki Magome', 'Shigeharu Takenaka', 'Toshikazu Imae', 'Akira Sakumi', 'Akihiro Nomoto', 'Hiroshi Igaki', 'Kenshiro Shiraishi', 'Hideomi Yamashita', 'Kuni Ohtomo', 'Keiichi Nakagawa']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Assessment of Monte Carlo algorithm for compliance with RTOG 0915 dosimetric criteria in peripheral lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'The commissioning and validation of Monaco treatment planning system on an Elekta VersaHD linear accelerator.', 'Basic Research on Comparative Evaluation of Calculated Dose Distribution Using Monte Carlo Algorithm-equipped Treatment Planning Systems in Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy.', 'Experimental evaluation of a GPU-based Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm in the Monaco treatment planning system.', 'VMAT Optimization and Dose Calculation in the Presence of Metallic Hip Prostheses.', 'Accuracy Evaluation of Collapsed Cone Convolution Superposition Algorithms for the Nasopharynx Interface in the Early Stage of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Correlation between the γ passing rates of IMRT plans and the volumes of air cavities and bony structures in head and neck cancer.', 'Performance Evaluation of Algorithms in Lung IMRT: A comparison of Monte Carlo, Pencil Beam, Superposition, Fast Superposition and Convolution Algorithms.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy for small lung tumors in the University of Tokyo Hospital.']"""

We examined whether variants in vitamin E-related genes were associated with risk of prostate cancer in a nested case-control study using 483 prostate cancer cases and 542 matched controls of European ancestry from a large U.S. multicenter trial that had available measurements of serum vitamin E concentrations and genotyping of 3 genome-wide association study meta-analysis-identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with circulating vitamin E. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age, family history of prostate cancer, and serum total cholesterol. Findings suggest lower prostate cancer risk for men whose genotypes reflect higher vitamin E (i.e., α-tocopherol) status. An SNP (rs964184) near budding-site selection protein 13 (yeast) (BUD13), zinc finger protein 259 (ZNF259), and apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) on 11q23.3 was significantly associated with prostate cancer risk (per-allele OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.98; P-trend = 0.03).

Top hits were subsequently docked to available IAP crystal structures as a secondary screening followed by validation using in vitro biologic assays.

Membranous expression of HER3 is associated with trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer and the transition to androgen independence in prostate cancer. Imaging of HER3 expression in malignant tumors may provide important diagnostic information that can influence patient management. Affibody molecules with low picomolar affinity to HER3 were recently selected. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of HER3 imaging using radiolabeled Affibody molecules.  Methods:   A HER3-binding Affibody molecule, Z08699, with a HEHEHE-tag on N-terminus was labeled with (99m)Tc(CO)3 using an IsoLink kit. In vitro and in vivo binding specificity and the cellular processing of the labeled binder were evaluated. Biodistribution of (99m)Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-Z08699 was studied over time in mice bearing HER3-expressing xenografts.  Results:   HEHEHE-Z08699 was labeled with (99m)Tc(CO)3 with an isolated yield of >80 % and a purity of >99 %. Binding of (99m)Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-Z08699 was specific to BT474 and MCF7 (breast cancer), and LS174T (colon cancer) cells. Cellular processing showed rapid binding and relatively quick internalization of the receptor/Affibody molecule complex (70 % of cell-associated radioactivity was internalized after 24 h). The tumor targeting was receptor mediated and the excretion was predominantly renal. Receptor-mediated uptake was also found in the liver, lung, stomach, intestine, and salivary glands. At 4 h pi, tumor-to-blood ratios were 7 ± 3 for BT474, and 6 ± 2 for LS174T xenografts. LS174T tumors were visualized by microSPECT 4 h pi.

PRL exerts its effect by dimerizing its receptor (PRLR) on the plasma membrane and regulating gene expression through the JAK-Stat signal pathway. We have previously described a natural variant of the PRLR in which the S2 subdomain of the extracellular domain is missing (Delta S2). Delta S2 PRLRs are dimerized in the absence of PRL and have constitutive activity in the promotion of breast cancer cell growth. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), as one of the histone-modifying enzymes, is a key factor regulating gene expression by epigenetic modification. We hypothesized that these constitutive activated Delta S2 PRLRs played a pathogenic role in breast cancer in part through alterations in the expression of EZH2 and the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine 27 (H3K27Me3).  Methods:   In order to verify the clinical significance and to establish the link between Delta S2 PRLR expression and epigenetic change, EZH2, H3K27Me3, and Delta S2 PRLR were detected in both normal and cancerous human breast tissues. Also, overexpression of Delta S2 PRLR in breast epithelial cells was achieved by infection with adenovirus carrying the cDNA. Western blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP assay) and acid histone extraction were applied to detect the expression of EZH2 and the trimethylation of histone 3, respectively.  Results:   In breast tissue, higher EZH2 expression and higher H3K27Me3 were found associated with higher Delta S2 expression in breast cancer samples. In breast epithelial cells, overexpression of Delta S2 PRLR increased EZH2 methyltransferase mRNA and protein, induced EZH2 methyltransferase recruitment to chromatin, increased the trimethylation of H3K27Me3, and decreased the expression of p53 gene.  Conclusions:   Delta S2 PRLR plays an important pathogenic role in breast cancer through epigenetic modification. Elevated expression of Delta S2 PRLR, achieved by alternate splicing of the pre-mRNA of the full-length form, is a new mechanism contributing to human breast cancer.""","""['Dunyong Tan', 'Peizhi Tang', 'Jianjun Huang', 'Jie Zhang', 'Weihua Zhou', 'Ameae M Walker']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Chin Med J (Engl)""","""['Histone trimethylation of the p53 gene by expression of a constitutively active prolactin receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Downregulation of Ezh2 methyltransferase by FOXP3: new insight of FOXP3 into chromatin remodeling?', 'Histone 3 Trimethylation of IGFBP-7 Gene Promoter by Expression of D5 Stat5a in Breast Epithelial Cells.', 'Aberrations of EZH2 in cancer.', 'Targeting histone methyltransferase EZH2 as cancer treatment.', 'Network analysis of common genes related to esophageal, gastric, and colon cancers.']"""

Since the primary prostate cancer diagnostic method, prostate biopsy, has limited accuracy in cancer diagnosis and malignant tissues have shown significantly different electrical properties from normal or benign tissues, MREIT has potential application in prostate cancer detection. The feasibility of utilizing MREIT in detecting prostate cancer was evaluated via a series of well-designed computer simulations in the present study. MREIT techniques with three different electrode configurations (external, trans-rectal, and trans-urethral electrode arrays) and two different reconstruction algorithms (J-substitution algorithm and harmonic Bz algorithm) were successfully developed. The performance of different MREIT techniques were evaluated and compared based on the imaging accuracy of the reconstructed conductivity distribution in the prostate. Without the presence of noise, the external MREIT achieves a better imaging accuracy than the two endo-MREIT (trans-rectal and trans-urethral) techniques, while the trans-urethral MREIT achieves the best imaging accuracy in noisy environments. We also found that the J-substitution reconstruction algorithm consistently offered better imaging accuracy than the harmonic Bz algorithm. When Gaussian distributed random noise with a standard deviation of 0.25 nT was added, the relative errors (RE) between the reconstructed and target conductivity distributions inside the prostate were observed to be 14.18% and 17.35% by the trans-urethral MREIT with the J-substitution and harmonic Bz algorithms respectively. The lower REs of 9.64% and 11.17% were achieved respectively when the standard deviation of noise was reduced to 0.05 nT.

Methods and materials:   The concept for the combined ART is to perform online ART only for the fractions with obvious interfraction variations and to deliver the ART plan for that online fraction as well as the subsequent fractions until the next online fraction needs to be adapted. To demonstrate the idea, the daily computed tomographic (CT) data acquired during image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) with an in-room CT (CTVision, Siemens Healthcare, Amarillo, TX) for 6 representative patients (including 2 prostate, 1 head-and-neck, and 1 pancreatic cancer, 1 adrenal carcinoma, and 1 craniopharyngioma patients) were analyzed. Three types of plans were generated based on the following selected daily CTs: (1) IGRT repositioning plan, generated by applying the repositioning shifts to the original plan (representing the current IGRT practice); (2) Re-Opt plan, generated with full-scope optimization; and (3) ART plan, either online ART plan generated with an online ART tool (RealArt, Prowess Inc, Concord, CA) or offline ART plan generated with shifts from the online ART plan. Various dose-volume parameters were compared with measure dosimetric benefits of the ART plans based on daily dose distributions and the cumulative dose maps obtained with deformable image registration.  Results:   In general, for all the cases studied, the ART (with 3-5 online ART) and Re-Opt plans provide comparable plan quality and offer significantly better target coverage and normal tissue sparing when compared with the repositioning plans.

With the advent of newer radiation delivery systems like volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), the impact of changing photon energy is readdressed.  Methods and materials:   Sixty-five patients treated for prostate cancer at our institution from 2011 to 2012 underwent CT simulation. A target volume encompassing the prostate and entire seminal vesicles was treated to 50.4 Gy, followed by a boost to the prostate and proximal seminal vesicles to a total dose of 81 Gy. The VMAT plans were generated for 6-MV and 10-MV photons under identical optimization conditions using the Eclipse system version 8.6 (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). The analytical anisotropic algorithm was used for all dose calculations. Plans were normalized such that 98% of the planning target volume (PTV) received 100% of the prescribed dose. Dose-volumetric data from the treatment planning system was recorded for both 6-MV and 10-MV plans, which were compared for both the entire cohort and subsets of patients stratified according to the anterior-posterior separation.  Results:   Plans using 10-MV photons had statistically significantly lower relative integral dose (4.1%), gradient measure (4.1%), skin Dmax (16.9%), monitor units (13.0%), and bladder V(30) (3.1%) than plans using 6-MV photons (P < .05). There was no difference in rectal dose, high-dose-region bladder dose, PTV coverage, or conformity index. The benefit of 10-MV photons was more pronounced for thicker patients (anterior-posterior separation >21 cm) for most parameters, with statistically significant differences in bladder V(30), bladder V(65), integral dose, conformity index, and monitor units.  Conclusions:   The main dosimetric benefits of 10-MV as compared with 6-MV photons are seen in thicker patients, though for the entire cohort 10-MV plans resulted in a lower integral dose, gradient measure, skin Dmax, monitor units, and bladder V(30), possibly at the expense of higher rectum V(81).""","""['Malcolm D Mattes', 'Cyril Tai', 'Alvin Lee', 'Hani Ashamalla', 'N C Ikoro']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Dosimetric effect of photon beam energy on volumetric modulated arc therapy treatment plan quality due to body habitus in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Intensity modulated proton and photon therapy for early prostate cancer with or without transperineal injection of a polyethylen glycol spacer: a treatment planning comparison study.', 'Dosimetric study of uniform scanning proton therapy planning for prostate cancer patients with a metal hip prosthesis, and comparison with volumetric-modulated arc therapy.', 'Which photon energy for intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arctherapy in 2019?.', 'Proton versus photon-based radiation therapy for prostate cancer: emerging evidence and considerations in the era of value-based cancer care.', 'VMAT for prostate cancer with 6-MV and 10-MV photons: Impact of beam energy on treatment plan quality and model-based secondary cancer risk estimates.', 'Evaluation of mixed energy partial arcs for volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of nominal photon energies on normal tissue sparing in knowledge-based radiotherapy treatment planning for rectal cancer patients.', 'Dosimetric influence of photon beam energy and number of arcs on volumetric modulated arc therapy in carcinoma cervix: A planning study.', 'The dosimetric significance of using 10 MV photons for volumetric modulated arc therapy for post-prostatectomy irradiation of the prostate bed.']"""

Areas covered:   Sipuleucel-T is an autologous active cellular immunotherapy that has demonstrated improved survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The IMPACT trial led to the FDA approval of sipuleucel-T as first-line treatment for men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC. Additional immunotherapies in cancer have shown promising results in clinical studies. These include ProstVac, which is a poxvirus vaccine targeting prostate-specific antigen, and cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 and programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1). The combination of sipuleucel-T with both androgen deprivation therapy and androgen signaling agents has demonstrated robust and augmented immune responses. The responses to immunotherapy are often seen via different parameters compared with other therapies, including increased T-cell activation and antibody response.

There are challenges in assessing comorbidity using linked databases such as statewide hospital administrative data and state cancer registry. The objective was to compile a comprehensive list of clinically relevant comorbid conditions for patients with prostate cancer using registry and statewide diagnosis databases.  Methods:   Florida Cancer Data System cases were linked with the inpatient/ outpatient diagnosis information. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Index was used as a reference. Conditions not captured by Elixhauser were identified, and grouped into clinically meaningful categories. Descriptive analysis was performed on comorbidity conditions and major study population variables. Associations of comorbidity with selected demographic and disease characteristics were examined.  Results:   Twenty-nine Elixhauser and 16 additional categories were examined within the 1 record per patient data set. Statistically significant association was found between comorbidity with race, stage, and age. Blacks had a higher mean number of conditions compared to whites. A higher proportion of blacks had at least 1 comorbid condition compared to whites. Additional conditions identified by this research capture more comorbidities for white men. Distinct trends towards larger number of comorbidities with older age at diagnosis and advanced disease stage were observed.  Conclusions:   The Elixhauser Comorbidity Index captured the majority of comorbidities in the study population while the additional conditions identified by this research add more information.

Human prostate cancer xenografts with increased (64)Cu radioactivity were visualized previously by PET using (64)CuCl2 as a radiotracer ((64)CuCl2 PET). This study aimed to determine whether the increased tumor (64)Cu radioactivity was due to increased cellular uptake of (64)Cu mediated by human copper transporter 1 (hCtr1) or simply due to nonspecific binding of ionic (64)CuCl2 to tumor tissue. In addition, the functional role of hCtr1 in proliferation of prostate cancer cells and tumor growth was also assessed.  Methods:   A lentiviral vector encoding short-hairpin RNA specific for hCtr1 (Lenti-hCtr1-shRNA) was constructed for RNA interference-mediated knockdown of hCtr1 expression in prostate cancer cells. The degree of hCtr1 knockdown was determined by Western blot, and the effect of hCtr1 knockdown on copper uptake and proliferation were examined in vitro by cellular (64)Cu uptake and cell proliferation assays. The effects of hCtr1 knockdown on tumor uptake of (64)Cu were determined by PET quantification and tissue radioactivity assay. The effects of hCtr1 knockdown on tumor growth were assessed by PET/CT and tumor size measurement with a caliper.  Results:   RNA interference-mediated knockdown of hCtr1 was associated with the reduced cellular uptake of (64)Cu and the suppression of prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro. At 24 h after intravenous injection of the tracer (64)CuCl2, the (64)Cu uptake by the tumors with knockdown of hCtr1 (4.02 ± 0.31 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g] in Lenti-hCtr1-shRNA-PC-3 and 2.30 ± 0.59 %ID/g in Lenti-hCtr1-shRNA-DU-145) was significantly lower than the (64)Cu uptake by the control tumors without knockdown of hCtr1 (7.21 ± 1.48 %ID/g in Lenti-SCR-shRNA-PC-3 and 5.57 ± 1.20 %ID/g in Lenti-SCR-shRNA-DU-145, P < 0.001) by PET quantification. Moreover, the volumes of prostate cancer xenograft tumors with knockdown of hCtr1 (179 ± 111 mm(3) for Lenti-hCtr1-shRNA-PC-3 or 39 ± 22 mm(3) for Lenti-hCtr1-shRNA-DU-145) were significantly smaller than those without knockdown of hCtr1 (536 ± 191 mm(3) for Lenti- SCR-shRNA-PC-3 or 208 ± 104 mm(3) for Lenti-SCR-shRNA-DU-145, P < 0.01).

Two isogenic human prostate cancer cell lines, differing in their metastatic potential [LNCaP (poorly metastatic) and LNCaP-LN3 (highly metastatic)], were studied. Metabolite ratios from NMR spectral integrals acquired at a field strength of 9.4 T using a 5-mm broadband probe with an NMR-compatible bioreactor were compared in the presence and absence of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor DCA. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes were assessed by zymography. Following the treatment of cells with 50 mm DCA, there was a significant reduction in the lactate/choline, lactate/creatine, lactate/alanine and the combined lactate/(choline + creatine + alanine) ratios in LNCaP-LN3 cells relative to LNCaP cells. No significant changes in metabolite ratios were found in LNCaP cells following DCA treatment. As expected, LDH zymography assays showed an absence of the LDH-B subunit in LNCaP-LN3 cells, whereas both LDH-A and LDH-B subunits were present in LNCaP cells. DCA was shown to significantly modify the metabolite ratios in highly metastatic LNCaP-LN3 cells, but not in poorly metastatic LNCaP cells. This effect was probably related to the absence of the LDH-B subunit in LNCaP-LN3 cells, and could have a bearing on cancer treatment with DCA and related compounds.""","""['Mithun Kailavasan', 'Ishtiaq Rehman', 'Steven Reynolds', 'Adriana Bucur', 'Gillian Tozer', 'Martyn Paley']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['In-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy of lactate as a non-invasive biomarker of dichloroacetate activity in cancer and non-cancer central nervous system disorders.', 'Lactate dehydrogenase-B is silenced by promoter hypermethylation in human prostate cancer.', 'Androgen-responsive and nonresponsive prostate cancer cells present a distinct glycolytic metabolism profile.', 'The effect of dichloroacetate in canine prostate adenocarcinomas and transitional cell carcinomas in vitro.', 'Dichloroacetate and cancer: new home for an orphan drug?', 'In-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy of lactate as a non-invasive biomarker of dichloroacetate activity in cancer and non-cancer central nervous system disorders.', 'Stress Hormone Corticosterone Controls Metabolic Mitochondrial Performance and Inflammatory Signaling of In Vitro Cultured Sertoli Cells.', 'Heterogeneous Expression and Subcellular Localization of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pharmacometabolomics Applied to Personalized Medicine in Urological Cancers.', 'MRI and MRS of intact perfused cancer cell metabolism, invasion, and stromal cell interactions.']"""

Activities are ongoing to investigate the opportunity to supplement SEER treatment data with other data sources.  Methods:   Using the linked SEER-Medicare data, we examined the validity of the SEER data to identify receipt of chemotherapy and radiation therapy among those aged 65 and older diagnosed from 2000 to 2006 with bladder, female breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreas, or prostate cancer and hormone therapy among men diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 65 or older. Treatment collected by SEER was compared with treatment as determined by Medicare claims, using Medicare claims as the gold standard. The κ, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values were calculated for the receipt of each treatment modality.  Results:   The overall sensitivity of SEER data to identify chemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapy receipt was moderate (68%, 80%, and 69%, respectively) and varied by cancer site, stage, and patient characteristics. The overall positive predictive value was high (>85%) for all treatment types and cancer sites except chemotherapy for prostate cancer.

Given the widespread use of PADT and the potential risks of serious adverse effects, accurate mortality data are needed to inform treatment decisions.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study using comprehensive utilization and cancer registry data from three integrated health plans. All men were newly diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer. Men who were diagnosed between 1995 and 2008, were not treated with curative intent therapy, and received follow-up through December 2010 were included in the study (n = 15,170). We examined all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality as our main outcomes. We used Cox proportional hazards models with and without propensity score analysis.  Results:   Overall, PADT was associated with neither a risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.11) nor prostate-cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.19) after adjusting for all sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. PADT was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality but not prostate-cancer-specific mortality. PADT was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality only among the subgroup of men with a high risk of cancer progression (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97).  Conclusion:   We found no mortality benefit from PADT compared with no PADT for most men with clinically localized prostate cancer who did not receive curative intent therapy. Men with higher-risk disease may derive a small clinical benefit from PADT.

The association between PSA response (< or =50% baseline) and undetectable androgens (week 12 androgen level below LLOQ) was analyzed using logistic regression.  Results:   A significantly greater reduction in serum androgens was observed with abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone (all P < or = 0.0003), reaching undetectable levels for testosterone (47.2% versus 0%, respectively).

However, in prostate cancer, the expression of DSGb5 has not yet been fully assessed. In this study, we investigated DSGb5 expression in prostate tissues and the relationship between DSGb5 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   A total of 130 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at our hospital between January 2005 and December 2007 were analyzed in this study. The expression of DSGb5 in prostatectomy specimens was examined by immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibody 5F3 (anti-DSGb5). Associations between 5F3 expression and clinicopathological findings were investigated and the factors that affected PSA failure-free survival were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox regression model.  Results:   When immunoreactivities of 5F3 were measured, negative to strong staining was observed in prostate cancer tissue, whereas strong staining was observed in benign prostate glands. These expression patterns suggest that DSGb5 may act as a differentiation antigen in cancerization. The PSA failure-free survival was significantly higher in the 5F3 intact expression group than in the 5F3 reduced expression group (log-rank P=0.0220). On multivariate analysis, 5F3 intact expression showed significantly worse PSA failure-free survival following RP.

Previous studies indicated that in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) bearing the leukemia promoting PML/RARα fusion protein, let-7c expression seems to be controlled by the host gene promoter, in which canonical Retinoic Acid Responsive Elements (RAREs) are bound by PML/RARα in an all transretinoic acid (ATRA)-sensitive manner. Here, let-7c transcriptional regulation was further investigated and a novel intronic promoter upstream of the pre-miRNA was identified. This new promoter has transcriptional activity strongly indicating that at least two promoters need to be considered for let-7c transcription: the distal host gene and the proximal intronic promoter. Therefore, epigenetic modifying enzymes and histone acetylation and methylation status were analyzed on both let-7c promoters. It was demonstrated that ATRA treatment leads to let-7c upregulation inducing a more open chromatin conformation of the host gene promoter, with an enrichment of epigenetic marks that correlate with a more active transcriptional state. Conversely, the epigenetic marks on the intronic promoter are not significantly affected by ATRA treatment. Interestingly, in solid tumors such as prostate and lung adenocarcinoma it was found that both host and intronic promoters are functional. These data suggest that while the host gene promoter may control let-7c expression in AML, in a nonleukemic tumor context instead the intronic promoter contributes or preferentially regulates let-7c transcription.  Implications:   Alternative promoter usage represents a regulatory mechanism of let-7c expression in different tissues.

With the continuous formulation of all perfusion parameters, it is possible to use standard gradient-based optimization algorithms in the approximation of the tissue concentration time sequences. This new six-parameter model is investigated by comparing Monte-Carlo simulations with theoretically derived covariance matrices. The covariance-matrix approach is extended from the usual analysis of the primary perfusion parameters of the pharmacokinetic model to the analysis of the perfusion parameters derived from the primary ones.

Appropriate preclinical models are lacking. The therapeutic efficacy of the multikinase inhibitor cabozantinib was assessed in an orthotopic xenograft model of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) bone metastasis using noninvasive, multimodality functional imaging.  Methods:   NOD/SCID mice were injected intratibially with luciferase-expressing ERG (v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog) rearranged VCaP human prostate carcinoma cells. The response of VCaP xenografts (n = 7 per group) to cabozantinib was investigated using bioluminescence imaging and anatomical and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging. This enabled quantitation of tumor volume and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Bone uptake of technetium-methylene diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-MDP) was assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography. Ex vivo micro computed tomography was used to quantify bone volume and correlated with appropriate histopathology. Statistical significance was determined using the two-sided Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Results:   VCaP xenografts were predominantly osteosclerotic with some osteolytic activity. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis confirmed retention of ERG oncogene rearrangements. Cabozantinib induced a statistically significant 52% reduction in tumor luminance (P = .02) and stasis in tumor volume after 15 days of treatment. Tumor ADC statistically significantly increased with cabozantinib and was associated with extensive necrosis (after 10 days, mean tumor ADC ± SD = 556±43×10(-6) mm(2)/s vs pretreatment ADC = 485±43×10(-6) mm(2)/s; P = .02 ). Tumor-associated uptake of (99m)Tc-MDP was statistically significantly reduced after 3 days of treatment (P = .02), sustained over 15 days treatment, and associated with a statistically significant (P = .048) reduction in bone growth on the tibial cortex, yet a highly statistically significant (P = .001) increase in trabecular bone volume.  Conclusions:   The intratibial VCaP model faithfully emulates clinical disease.

TM expression was determined in prostate cancer cells (DU-145 and PC-3 cells) using real-time PCR and Western blotting. TM expression was manipulated in prostate cancer cells using TM-specific shRNA and an overexpression system. The proliferation, adhesion, and migratory ability of prostate cancer cells expressing various TM levels were determined using the x'Celligence biosensor system and a transwell migration assay. Higher levels of TM transcription and translation were found in DU-145 cells and were negatively correlated with the low migratory ability of DU-145 cells. After silencing TM expression in DU-145 cells, cell growth decreased, but cell adhesion and migration dramatically increased. TM overexpression in PC-3 cells reduced their metastatic ability. We investigated the possible mechanisms of this phenomenon and determined that the enhanced cell migration was mediated through the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin.

In this study, the modified BBN peptide with a new hydrophilic linker was labeled with (68)Ga for PET imaging of GRPR-expressing PC-3 prostate cancer xenograft model. GRPR antagonists, MATBBN (Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Asp-Asn-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-NHCH2CH3) and ATBBN (D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-NHCH2CH3), were conjugated with 1,4,7-triazacyclononanetriacetic acid (NOTA) and labeled with (68)Ga. Partition coefficient and in vitro stability were also determined. GRPR binding affinity of both tracers was investigated by competitive radioligand binding assay. The in vivo receptor targeting potential and pharmacokinetic of (68)Ga-NOTA-MATBBN were also evaluated in PC-3 prostate tumor model and compared with those of (68)Ga-NOTA-ATBBN. NOTA-conjugated BBN analogs were labeled with (68)Ga within 20 min with a decay-corrected yield ranging from 90 to 95 % and a radiochemical purity of more than 98 %. The specific activity of (68)Ga-NOTA-MATBBN and (68)Ga-NOTA-ATBBN was at least 16.5 and 11.9 GBq/μmol, respectively. The radiotracers were stable in phosphate-buffered saline and human serum. (68)Ga-NOTA-MATBBN was more hydrophilic than (68)Ga-NOTA-ATBBN, as indicated by their log P values (-2.73 ± 0.02 vs. -1.20 ± 0.03). The IC50 values of NOTA-ATBBN and NOTA-MATBBN were similar (102.7 ± 1.18 and 124.6 ± 1.21 nM). The accumulation of (68)Ga-labeled GRPR antagonists in the subcutaneous PC-3 tumors could be visualized via small animal PET. The tumors were clearly visible, and the tumor uptakes of (68)Ga-NOTA-MATBBN and (68)Ga-NOTA-ATBBN were determined to be 4.19 ± 0.32, 4.00 ± 0.41, 2.93 ± 0.35 and 4.70 ± 0.40, 4.10 ± 0.30, 3.14 ± 0.30 %ID/g at 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively. There was considerable accumulation and retention of (68)Ga-NOTA-ATBBN in the liver and intestines. In contrast, the abdominal area does not have much retention of (68)Ga-NOTA-MATBBN. Biodistribution data were in accordance with the PET results, showing that (68)Ga-NOTA-MATBBN had more favorable pharmacokinetics and higher tumor to background ratios than those of (68)Ga-NOTA-ATBBN. At 1 h postinjection, the tumor to liver and intestine of (68)Ga-NOTA-MATBBN were 8.05 ± 0.56 and 21.72 ± 3.47 and the corresponding values of unmodified counterpart were 0.85 ± 0.23 and 3.45 ± 0.43, respectively. GRPR binding specificity was demonstrated by reduced tumor uptake of radiolabeled tracers after coinjection of an excess of unlabeled BBN peptides. (68)Ga-NOTA-MATBBN exhibited GRPR-targeting properties both in vitro and in vivo. The favorable characterizations of (68)Ga-NOTA-MATBBN such as convenient synthesis, specific GRPR targeting, high tumor uptake, and satisfactory pharmacokinetics warrant its further investigation for clinical cancer imaging.""","""['Donghui Pan', 'Yu Ping Xu', 'Rong Hua Yang', 'Lizhen Wang', 'Fei Chen', 'Shineng Luo', 'Min Yang', 'Yongjun Yan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Synthesis and characterization of a high-affinity NOTA-conjugated bombesin antagonist for GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.', 'PET imaging of prostate tumors with 18F-Al-NOTA-MATBBN.', 'PET of tumors expressing gastrin-releasing peptide receptor with an 18F-labeled bombesin analog.', '99mTc(v)O-Gly-Gly-Cys-Orn-Orn-Orn-Bombesin2-14.', '3-Cyano-4-18Ffluoro-benzoyl-Ala(SO3H)-Ala(SO3H)-Ava-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-NMeGly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', 'Targeting HER2-positive gastric cancer with a novel 18F-labeled ZHER2:342 probe.', 'A Comprehensive Review of Non-Covalent Radiofluorination Approaches Using Aluminum 18Ffluoride: Will 18FAlF Replace 68Ga for Metal Chelate Labeling?', 'Prostate Cancer Theranostics Targeting Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptors.', 'PET of HER2 Expression with a Novel 18FAl Labeled Affibody.', 'PET Tracers Beyond FDG in Prostate Cancer.']"""

High efficacy of osteodex has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The present study investigates whether osteodex is also efficacious on soft tissue tumor lesions.  Materials and methods:   Twelve female nude mice were injected with MDA-MB-231 cells orthotopically. Osteodex was administered i.v. at 2.5 mg/kg, once per week for five weeks. Tumor volumes were measured during the treatment period, the animals were sacrificed, and samples collected for proteomic analysis.  Results:   The non-treated mice developed multiple tumors greater than 4 cm with pronounced ulceration, while the treated mice had tumors smaller than 1 cm, without ulceration. While general condition of treated mice was good, non-treated animals were in poor condition. Sixteen out of 300 identified proteins were differentially expressed, with statistically significant expression changes of more than two-fold differences between treated and non-treated groups. These proteins were identified using non-gel based nano-liquid chromatography coupled with a Synapt G2 instrument.

The aims of the present study were to determine the efficacy somatostatin analogue octreotide (OCT) combined with a low dose of docetaxel (DTX) using castration resistant prostate cancer cells and to investigate the involved molecular mechanisms in vitro. The anti-proliferative and synergism potential effects were determined by MTT assay. Induction of apoptosis was analyzed employing annexing V and propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. VEGFA, CASP9, CASP3 and ABCB1 gene expression was evaluated by RT-PCR and Q-RT-PCR analysis. OCT in combination with DTX treatments on DU145 cell migration was also evaluated. Investigation revealed that combined administration of DTX and OCT had significant, synergistically greater cytotoxicity than DTX or OCT treatment alone. The combination of the two drugs caused a more marked increase in apoptosis and resulted in greater suppression of invasive potential than either individual agent. There was obvious increase in caspase 3 expression in the OCT alone and two-drug combined treatment groups, however, VEGFA expression was markedly suppressed in them. These results support the conclusion that somatostatin analogues combined with docetaxel may enhance the chemotherapy efficacies through multiple mechanisms in castration-resistant PCa cell line.

Experimental data indicate that 1 fits into the major groove without disrupting the helical structure of the B-DNA in contrast to the free phendione which intercalates within the base pairs of DNA. Upon irradiation, complex 1 promotes the cleavage of plasmid pBR322 DNA from supercoiled form I to nicked form II via a proton coupled electron transfer mechanism.

The type I transmembrane protein with epidermal growth factor and two follistatin motifs 2 (TMEFF2) is expressed mainly in brain and prostate and its expression is deregulated in prostate cancer. We have previously shown that TMEFF2 can function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell migration and invasion of prostate cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this inhibition are not clear. In this study we demonstrate that TMEFF2 affects cell adhesion and migration of prostate cancer cells and that this effect correlates with changes in integrin expression and RhoA activation. Deletion of a 13 basic-rich amino acid region in the cytoplasmic domain of TMEFF2 prevented these effects. Overexpression of TMEFF2 reduced cell attachment and migration on vitronectin and caused a concomitant decrease in RhoA activation, stress fiber formation and expression of αv, β1 and β3 integrin subunits. Conversely, TMEFF2 interference in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells resulted in an increased integrin expression. Results obtained with a double TRAMP/TMEFF2 transgenic mouse also indicated that TMEFF2 expression reduced integrin expression in the mouse prostate. In summary, the data presented here indicate an important role of TMEFF2 in regulating cell adhesion and migration that involves integrin signaling and is mediated by its cytoplasmic domain.""","""['Xiaofei Chen', 'Joshua M Corbin', 'Greg J Tipton', 'Li V Yang', 'Adam S Asch', 'Maria J Ruiz-Echevarría']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Analysis of TMEFF2 allografts and transgenic mouse models reveals roles in prostate regeneration and cancer.', 'Activin B induces human endometrial cancer cell adhesion, migration and invasion by up-regulating integrin β3 via SMAD2/3 signaling.', 'TMEFF2 and SARDH cooperate to modulate one-carbon metabolism and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor metastasis suppressor functions of Ets transcription factor through integrin β3-mediated signaling pathway.', 'EGFRvIII/integrin β3 interaction in hypoxic and vitronectinenriching microenvironment promote GBM progression and metastasis.', 'A Data Science Approach for the Identification of Molecular Signatures of Aggressive Cancers.', 'LncRNA PAINT is associated with aggressive prostate cancer and dysregulation of cancer hallmark genes.', 'TMEFF2: A Transmembrane Proteoglycan with Multifaceted Actions in Cancer and Disease.', 'TMEFF2 inhibits pancreatic cancer cells proliferation, migration, and invasion by suppressing phosphorylation of the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Exposure to an Environmentally Relevant Phthalate Mixture During Prostate Development Induces MicroRNA Upregulation and Transcriptome Modulation in Rats.']"""

Preliminary data in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) suggested a benefit of the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozantinib to pain palliation.  Objective:   Prospective evaluation of cabozantinib's benefits on pain and narcotic use in mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a nonrandomized expansion (NRE) cohort (n=144) of a phase 2 randomized discontinuation trial in docetaxel-refractory mCRPC patients. Pain and interference of symptoms with sleep and general activity were electronically self-reported daily for 7-d intervals at baseline and regularly scheduled throughout the study. Mean per-patient scores were calculated for each interval. Narcotic use was recorded daily during the same intervals.  Intervention:   Open-label cabozantinib (100mg or 40mg).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The following stringent response definition was used: clinically meaningful pain reduction (≥30% improvement in mean scores from baseline) confirmed at a later interval without concomitant increases in narcotics. Only patients with moderate or severe baseline pain were analyzed.  Results and limitations:   Sixty-five patients with moderate or severe baseline pain were evaluable. Of these, 27 (42%) experienced pain palliation according to the stringent response definition. Thirty-seven patients (57%) had clinically meaningful pain relief at two consecutive intervals, reported ≥6 wk apart in the majority. Forty-four patients (68%) had palliation at one or more intervals; 36 (55%) decreased narcotics use during one or more intervals. Clinically meaningful pain reduction was associated with significant (p ≤ 0.001) improvements in sleep quality and general activity. A limitation of this study was its open-label design.  Conclusions:   Cabozantinib demonstrated clinically meaningful pain palliation, reduced or eliminated patients' narcotic use, and improved patient functioning, thus meriting prospective validation in phase 3 studies.  Patient summary:   We evaluated the potential of cabozantinib to improve symptoms in patients with metastatic prostate cancer that no longer responds to standard therapies.

Surgery is most often the recommended treatment for PCa, but radical prostatectomy can cause significant urinary adverse effects. Therefore, finding effective biochemical treatments for PCa remains a necessity. Aurora kinase A has been shown to be involved in PCa progression, thus making it a good target for PCa therapy. miRNAs are important regulators of gene expression, with some miRNAs specifically involved in carcinogenesis. Therefore, herein, we identified miRNAs targeted to aurora kinase A and examined their effects on the growth of PCa. We used primary samples from PCa patients and PCa cell lines as research subjects. We demonstrate that miR-199a-3p is down-regulated in PCa tissues compared with normal prostate tissues, with the expression pattern inversely correlated with the expression pattern of aurora kinase A. We find that miR-199a-3p agomir inhibits aurora kinase A and attenuates xenograft tumor growth of PCa. Moreover, we demonstrate that down-regulation of miR-199a-3p results from enhancement of the methylation of miR-199a gene in PCa.

The current analysis focused on the relationship between bladder DVH/DSH and the risk of International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS)⩾15/20 at the end of radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   Planning and relevant clinical parameters were prospectively collected, including DVH/DSH, LQ-corrected (DVHc/DSHc) and weekly (DVHw/DSHw) histograms. Best parameters were selected by the differences between patients with/without IPSS⩾15/20 at the end of radiotherapy. Logistic uni- and backward multi-variable (MVA) analyses were performed.  Results:   Data of 247 patients were available (CONV: 116, HYPO: 131). Absolute DVHw/DSHw and DVHc/DSHc predicted the risk of IPSS⩾15 at the end of radiotherapy (n=77/247); an MVA model including baseline IPSS, anti-hypertensive, T stage, the absolute surface receiving ⩾8.5Gy/week and ⩾12.5Gy/week was developed (AUC=0.78, 95% CI: 0.72-0.83). Similar AUC values were found if replacing DSHw with DVHw/DVHc/DSHc parameters. The impact of dose-volume/surface parameters remained when excluding patients with baseline IPSS⩾15 and in HYPO. IPSS⩾20 at the end of radiotherapy (n=27/247) was mainly correlated to baseline IPSS and T stage.

We also evaluated the role of magnetic resonance imaging.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1,262 patients who underwent 12-core biopsy, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and radical prostatectomy at a single center between September 2007 and June 2012. A total of 382 men with low risk prostate cancer by the D'Amico criteria were included in study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors predicting unfavorable pathological outcomes.  Results:   Median patient age was 65 years and median preoperative prostate specific antigen was 4.6 ng/ml. Gleason sum was upgraded in 212 patients (55.5%). In 249 patients (65.1%) prostate cancer was identified on 3 Tesla T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging without dynamic contrast imaging. The lesion was in the anterior and posterior of the prostate in 42.9% and 57.0% of cases, respectively. Unfavorable pathological results were found postoperatively in 29.6% of patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age (OR 1.072, p<0.001), number of positive cores (OR 1.373, p<0.001) and an anterior index tumor site on magnetic resonance imaging (OR 2.121, p=0.017) were significant predictors of unfavorable final pathological results (pT3 or greater, or tumor upgrading to Gleason 3+4 plus tumor volume 15% or greater, or upgrading to Gleason 4+3 or greater).

Complimenting these techniques, volumetric image guidance has supported increased positional accuracy. In addition, 3-dimensional image guidance has also allowed for assessment of potential dosimetric variation that can be attributed to a deformation of either internal or external structures, such as rectal distension or body contour. Compounding these issues is the variation of tissue density through which the new field position passes and also the variation of dose across a modulated beam. Despite the growing level of interest in this area, there are only a limited number of articles that examine the effect of a variation in beam path length, particularly across a modulated field. IMRT and volumetric-modulated radiation therapy (VMAT) fields are dynamic in nature, and the dose gradient within these fields is variable. Assessment of variation of path length away from the beam׳s central axis and across the entire field is vital where there is considerable variation of dose within the field, such as IMRT and VMAT. In these cases, reliance on the traditional central axis to focus skin distances is no longer appropriate.

This study's aims were to validate multicriteria optimization (MCO) in RayStation (v2.4, RaySearch Laboratories, Sweden) against standard intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) optimization in Oncentra (v4.1, Nucletron BV, the Netherlands) and characterize dose differences due to conversion of navigated MCO plans into deliverable multileaf collimator apertures. Step-and-shoot IMRT plans were created for 10 patients with localized prostate cancer using both standard optimization and MCO. Acceptable standard IMRT plans with minimal average rectal dose were chosen for comparison with deliverable MCO plans. The trade-off was, for the MCO plans, managed through a user interface that permits continuous navigation between fluence-based plans. Navigated MCO plans were made deliverable at incremental steps along a trajectory between maximal target homogeneity and maximal rectal sparing. Dosimetric differences between navigated and deliverable MCO plans were also quantified. MCO plans, chosen as acceptable under navigated and deliverable conditions resulted in similar rectal sparing compared with standard optimization (33.7 ± 1.8 Gy vs 35.5 ± 4.2 Gy, p = 0.117). The dose differences between navigated and deliverable MCO plans increased as higher priority was placed on rectal avoidance. If the best possible deliverable MCO was chosen, a significant reduction in rectal dose was observed in comparison with standard optimization (30.6 ± 1.4 Gy vs 35.5 ± 4.2 Gy, p = 0.047). Improvements were, however, to some extent, at the expense of less conformal dose distributions, which resulted in significantly higher doses to the bladder for 2 of the 3 tolerance levels. In conclusion, similar IMRT plans can be created for patients with prostate cancer using MCO compared with standard optimization. Limitations exist within MCO regarding conversion of navigated plans to deliverable apertures, particularly for plans that emphasize avoidance of critical structures. Minimizing these differences would result in better quality treatments for patients with prostate cancer who were treated with radiotherapy using MCO plans.""","""['Conor K McGarry', 'Rasmus Bokrantz', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Alan R Hounsell']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Maximizing dosimetric benefits of IMRT in the treatment of localized prostate cancer through multicriteria optimization planning.', 'Efficiency gains for spinal radiosurgery using multicriteria optimization intensity modulated radiation therapy guided volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Multicriteria optimization enables less experienced planners to efficiently produce high quality treatment plans in head and neck cancer radiotherapy.', 'Multicriteria plan optimization in the hands of physicians: a pilot study in prostate cancer and brain tumors.', 'Multicriteria optimization informed VMAT planning.', 'ICON-P - A double-blind evaluation of quality improvements with individualized CONstraints from low-cost knowledge-based radiation therapy planning in prostate cancer.', 'Artificial intelligence guided physician directive improves head and neck planning quality and practice Uniformity: A prospective study.', 'Site-agnostic 3D dose distribution prediction with deep learning neural networks.', 'Multi-criteria optimization for planning volumetric-modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Tree-based exploration of the optimization objectives for automatic cervical cancer IMRT treatment planning.']"""

Objective:   To examine the association between ERG expression at diagnosis and the risk of progression during AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   This study included 265 patients followed on AS with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements, clinical examinations, and 10-12 core rebiopsies from 2002 to 2012 in a prospectively maintained database. ERG immunohistochemical staining was performed on diagnostic paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed sections with a ready-to-use kit (anti-ERG, EPR3864). Men were characterised as ERG positive if a minimum of one tumour focus demonstrated ERG expression.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Overall AS progression was defined as clinical progression: increased clinical tumour category ≥cT2b by digital rectal examination and ultrasound, and/or histopathologic progression: upgrade of Gleason score, more than three positive cores or bilateral positive cores, and/or PSA progression: PSA doubling time <3 yr. Risk of progression was analysed using multiple cause-specific Cox regression and stratified cumulative incidences (Aalen-Johansen method). Curatively intended treatment, watchful waiting, and death without progression were treated as competing events.  Results and limitations:   A total of 121 of 142 ERG-negative and 96 of 123 ERG-positive patients had complete diagnostic information. In competing risk models, the ERG-positive group showed significantly higher incidences of overall AS progression (p<0.0001) and of the subgroups PSA progression (p<0.0001) and histopathologic progression (p<0.0001). The 2-yr cumulative incidence of overall AS progression was 21.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3-29.1) in the ERG-negative group compared with 58.6% (95% CI, 48.7-68.5) in the ERG-positive group. ERG positivity was a significant predictor of overall AS progression in multiple Cox regression (hazard ratio: 2.45; 95% CI, 1.62-3.72; p<0.0001). The main limitation of this study is its observational nature.  Conclusions:   In our study, ERG positivity at diagnosis can be used to estimate the risk of progression during AS.

Materials and methods:   Patients with localized prostate cancer who received primary radiotherapy with curative intent between 1999 and 2000 were identified in the British Columbia Tumour Registry. Exclusion criteria included patient age >72 years, prostate-specific antigen>40 ng/ml, and clinical stage T4 at diagnosis. Data on clinicopathologic features, primary therapy, prostate-specific antigen kinetics, and salvage therapy were collected retrospectively. Radiation failure was defined as biochemical recurrence according to the Phoenix criteria or by initiation of salvage therapy.  Results:   Of 1,782 patients treated in the study period, 1,067 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 257 failed radiation therapy. Radiation therapy failure was managed with observation (>12 mo) in 126 patients and ADT in 119. Of the observed patients, 66 subsequently received ADT. Five patients (1.8%) received LST (3 radical prostatectomy and 2 brachytherapy).  Conclusions:   Only 2% of patients relapsing after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer received LST.

In this analysis, we comprehensively evaluate the GS as a prognostic factor for mPCa in the era of the updated Gleason grading system.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for patients with mPCa, GS 6 to 10, diagnosed from 2006 to 2008. GS and primary-secondary Gleason pattern variations were analyzed for overall survival and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS).  Results:   A total of 4,654 patients were evaluable. At 4 years, the overall survival rates were 51%, 45%, 34%, 25%, and 15% and PCSS rates were 69%, 57%, 44%, 33%, and 21% for GS 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively. Survival differences for GS 7 vs. 8, 8 vs. 9, and 9 vs. 10 were highly significant on both univariate and multivariate analyses accounting for age, prostate-specific antigen level, and T stage (all P<0.001). Gleason pattern 5 was an independent prognostic factor, both overall for patients with GS 6 to 10 and on primary-secondary Gleason pattern comparisons within the GS 8 (4+4 vs. 3+5 and 5+3) and GS 9 (4+5 vs. 5+4) subgroups. No survival differences were observed between 3+4 vs. 4+3. Overall, lower prostate-specific antigen level, younger age, and lower GS were associated with improved survival, with GS being the strongest prognostic factor for PCSS.  Conclusions:   In this large population-based cohort, stratified survival outcomes were observed for GS 6 to 10, with sequential comparisons of GS 7 to 10, and the presence and extent of Gleason pattern 5 representing independent prognostic factors in the metastatic setting.""","""['Chad G Rusthoven', 'Julie A Carlson', 'Timothy V Waxweiler', 'Norman Yeh', 'David Raben', 'Thomas W Flaig', 'Brian D Kavanagh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Gleason stratifications prognostic for survival in men receiving definitive external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Presence of high grade tertiary Gleason pattern upgrades the Gleason sum score and is inversely associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival.', 'Might men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer benefit from definitive treatment of the primary tumor?

The remainder of the gland was divided into 12 quadrant-shaped regions that were sampled using two slices. Eight equidistant points were marked directly on the coverslip over each fragment. The points inside the tumoral areas were counted and expressed as both the percentage of prostate gland involvement by carcinoma (PGI) and the tumor volume (TV). A significant correlation between the preoperative PSA levels and each of the three quantitative estimations were observed, with improved correlations with the PGI and TV values obtained using the point-count method (viz. number of slices involved (NSI) (r=0.32), PGI (r=0.39) and TV (r=0.44)). With the data sets stratified into three categories, all three methods correlated with multiple parameters, including Gleason scores ≥7, primary Gleason scores ≥4, perineural/angiolymphatic invasion, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion and positive margins.

The overall survival rate is <5% after five years. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is one of the most important risk factors for PCA. A major difficulty is to distinguish between CP and PCA at both clinical and morphologic level. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the expression profiles for 14-3-3 zeta and CCL20 to histologically discriminate between PCA and CP.  Methods:   In PCA (n=138) and CP (n=36) tissue samples, the expression of 14-3-3 zeta and CCL20 was examined by immunohistochemistry. Associations between expression profiles of 14-3-3 zeta and CCL20 expression in PCA, CP as well as MANT (matched adjacent normal tissue) (n=138) and clinicopathologic variables were analyzed.  Results:   The expression of CCL20 and 14-3-3 zeta was significantly higher in PCA than in CP and MANT. For CP compared to MANT, no significant differences were observed for expression profiles of both 14-3-3 zeta and CCL20.

In the present investigation we aimed to understand whether and how the paradigmatic membrane-targeted synthetic phospholipid analog erufosine is relevant for tumor cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, cell survival and migration. The antineoplastic action of erufosine was analyzed with glioblastoma and prostate cancer cells adhering to fibronectin or collagen I using proliferation, adhesion and migration assays. The composition of adhesion contacts containing activated β1 integrins was studied using immunofluorescence. The importance of β1 integrins for the observed effects was analyzed in fibroblasts proficient or deficient in β1 integrin expression. Adhesion to collagen I and fibronectin increased the death threshold in serum-deprived tumor cells. Moreover, β1 integrin-deficient cells were more sensitive to erufosine-treatment compared to β1 integrin proficient cells suggesting a role of β1 integrins for matrix-mediated death resistance. Most importantly, erufosine disturbed the maturation of the cell adhesion complexes containing paxillin, activated β1 integrins and phosphorylated FAK, leading to a reduction of survival signals and inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and migration.

NVP-BEZ235 selectively induced apoptotic cell death in the prostate cancer cell line DU145, which harbors wild-type PTEN; however, in the PC3 cell line, which is PTEN-null, treatment with NVP-BEZ235 resulted in autophagic cell death.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic data of 174 patients with a follow-up of at least 3 years after RP for clinically localized prostate cancer. None of the patients received neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy. Subjects were categorized according to PSA level 3 months after RP (3M-PSA): <0.010 ng/mL (group 1; n = 119) or 0.010-0.100 ng/mL (group 2; n = 55). BCR was defined as two consecutive rises in PSA level ≥0.2 ng/mL.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 69.5 months (range 36-113 months), 32 (18.4 %) patients experienced BCR. The median time to BCR was 16 months (range 4-98 months) after RP. The 5-year BCR-free survival rate was 92.6 and 57.4 % in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Patients in group 1 had a significantly higher BCR-free survival rate than those in group 2 (log-rank P < 0.001).

Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of LAPTM4B-35 protein in 180 PCa tissues in comparison with 180 normal benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) specimens. The correlation between the expression of the LAPTM4B-35 protein and the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with PCa was analyzed.  Results:   Statistical analysis showed that LAPTM4B-35 expression was significantly elevated in PCa compared with the BPH controls. High LAPTM4B-35 staining was present in 71.11% of all the cases with PCa. The overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 was significantly associated with the lymph node metastasis, seminal vesicle invasion, PCa stage, higher Gleason score, higher preoperative PSA, and biochemical recurrence (BCR). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the high expression of LAPTM4B-35 was related to the poor overall survival and BCR-free survival of patients with PCa.

PARP trapping is drug-specific, with olaparib exhibiting a greater ability than veliparib, whereas both compounds are potent catalytic PARP inhibitors. Here, we evaluated the combination of olaparib or veliparib with therapeutically relevant DNA-targeted drugs, including the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, the alkylating agent temozolomide, the cross-linking agent cisplatin, and the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide at the cellular and molecular levels. We determined PARP-DNA trapping and catalytic PARP inhibition in genetically modified chicken lymphoma DT40, human prostate DU145, and glioblastoma SF295 cancer cells. For camptothecin, both PARP inhibitors showed highly synergistic effects due to catalytic PARP inhibition, indicating the value of combining either veliparib or olaparib with topoisomerase I inhibitors. On the other hand, for temozolomide, PARP trapping was critical in addition to catalytic inhibition, consistent with the fact that olaparib was more effective than veliparib in combination with temozolomide. For cisplatin and etoposide, olaparib only showed no or a weak combination effect, which is consistent with the lack of involvement of PARP in the repair of cisplatin- and etoposide-induced lesions. Hence, we conclude that catalytic PARP inhibitors are highly effective in combination with camptothecins, whereas PARP inhibitors capable of PARP trapping are more effective with temozolomide.

Results:   A total of 444 and 2698 LC patients with and without a history of a PM were identified (prevalence of 14.1%). PM were most often located in breast (15.5%), prostate (14.9%), bladder (9.0%) and kidney (8.8%). Compared to never smokers, patients with nicotine consumption had more often a cancer history of prostate, gastrointestinal, and the head-neck region. The median interval until diagnosis of LC was 72.2 months (range 0-537 months) with most LC diagnosed 5 years after PM diagnosis. With a similar distribution of histology, stage and localization compared to controls, NSCLC patients with PM and stage IV disease showed a favorable overall survival (p < 0.0001).

Clinicopathological variables including proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and prostate-specific antigen and its derivatives were analyzed to predict the positive prostate biopsy results using univariate and multivariate analyses. Furthermore, the presence of tumor in each of the 12 prostate sectors by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were evaluated and compared with prostate biopsy results in each of the 12 prostate sectors in order to evaluate the local cancer distribution in the prostate after high-intensity focused ultrasound.

Patients receiving external-beam radiotherapy or who used phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor pre- or post-treatment were excluded. Prostate-specific antigen bounce was defined as an increase of ≥0.2 ng/mL and ≥0.4 ng/mL above an initial prostate-specific antigen nadir followed by a subsequent decline to or below the initial nadir without treatment. Clinical and dosimetric factors involved in prostate-specific antigen bounce were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis with the forced entry method.  Results:   The median age was 66 years (range 51-80 years), and prostate-specific antigen bounce on a prostate-specific antigen rise of ≥0.2 ng/mL occurred in 47 of the 116 participants (40.5%).

Patients with prostate-specific antigen bounce were younger and had higher sexual function before treatment (P = 0.003) than those who not show prostate-specific antigen bounce. Regression analysis results showed that young age and a high level of pretreatment sexual function were significant predictive factors for prostate-specific antigen bounce (P = 0.028 and P = 0.048).

Patients can be cured only when the tumor has not metastasized outside the prostate. However, treatment with curative intent fails in a significant number of men, often resulting in untreatable progressive disease with a fatal outcome. Oncolytic adenovirus therapy may be a promising adjuvant treatment to reduce local failure or the outgrowth of micrometastatic disease. Within the European gene therapy consortium GIANT, we have developed a novel prostate-specific oncolytic adenovirus: Ad[I/PPT-E1A]. This adenovirus specifically kills prostate cells via prostate-specific replication. This article describes the clinical development of Ad[I/PPT-E1A] with particular reference to the preclinical safety assessment of this novel virus. The preclinical safety assessment involved an efficacy study in a human orthotopic xenograft mouse model, a specificity study in human primary cells, and a toxicity study in normal mice. These studies confirmed that Ad[I/PPT-E1A] efficiently kills prostate tumor cells in vivo, is not harmful to other organs, and is well tolerated in mice after systemic delivery. The safety, as well as the immunological effects of Ad[I/PPT-E1A] as a local adjuvant therapy, will now be studied in a phase I dose-escalating trial in patients with localized prostate cancer who are scheduled for curative radical prostatectomy and can be used as an updated paradigm for similar therapeutic viruses.""","""['Ellen Schenk', 'Magnus Essand', 'Robert Kraaij', 'Rachel Adamson', 'Norman J Maitland', 'Chris H Bangma']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Hum Gene Ther Clin Dev""","""['Antitumor effects of oncolytic adenovirus armed with PSA-IZ-CD40L fusion gene against prostate cancer.', 'In vitro primary cell culture as a physiologically relevant method for preclinical testing of human oncolytic adenovirus.', 'Increased therapeutic efficacy of the prostate-specific oncolytic adenovirus AdI/PPT-E1A by reduction of the insulator size and introduction of the full-length E3 region.', 'Adenovirus-based therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Tropism and transduction of oncolytic adenovirus vectors in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Glioblastoma Therapy: Rationale for a Mesenchymal Stem Cell-based Vehicle to Carry Recombinant Viruses.', 'Development of a New Hyaluronic Acid Based Redox-Responsive Nanohydrogel for the Encapsulation of Oncolytic Viruses for Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Delivery and Biosafety of Oncolytic Virotherapy.', 'Oncolytic alphavirus SFV-VA7 efficiently eradicates subcutaneous and orthotopic human prostate tumours in mice.', 'Oncolytic adenovirus-mediated therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

To study which ω-3 PUFAs are more effective in prostate cancer prevention, and whether the mechanisms of action are conserved between them, we investigated the effect of DHA, EPA and ALA on the human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP. Different trends of inhibition of PC-3 cell proliferation were observed for the three ω-3 PUFA, with DHA having the most pronounced effects on cell proliferation, while ALA had the minimum effects of the three ω-3 PUFAs. All the ω-3 PUFAs decreased fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA. Concerning genes involved in inflammation, cell cycle and apoptosis, DHA regulated the most genes in all categories, followed by EPA and then ALA. In addition, DHA and EPA increased the gene expression of the pro-apoptotic protein activating transcription factor 3 mRNA. Moreover, these two fatty acids significantly induced apoptosis.

CZ48 has been tested against 29 human tumor lines grown in nude mice as xenografts. Of the tested tumor lines, 28 were found to be responsive to CZ48, by regression or significant inhibition. The total response rate was 97%. However, the effective dose required to achieve the positive response varied from 100 to 2000 mg/kg/day depending on the tumor type. Thus, the sensitivity of tumors to CZ48 treatment varied from tumor to tumor. The most sensitive CLO-breast carcinoma achieved regression when treated with 100 mg/kg/day, while PC3-prostate carcinoma required as high as 1000 mg/kg/day to achieve a definitive response. To determine the reason for these differences in sensitivities among the tumors, we treated 9 human xenografts grown in nude mice with 1000 mg/kg/day CZ48 until saturation and measured the local concentrations of the parental CZ48 as well as the corresponding metabolite camptothecin (CPT) in the tumors with the established high-performance liquid chromatography procedure.

Biomarkers of tobacco exposure may reduce misclassification and provide insight into metabolic variability that potentially influences carcinogenesis. Our aim was to identify metabolites that represent smoking habits and individual variation in tobacco metabolism, and investigate their association with colorectal cancer. In a nested case-control study of 255 colorectal cancers and 254 matched controls identified in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial, baseline serum was used to identify metabolites by ultra-high-performance liquid-phase chromatography and mass spectrometry, as well as gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.

Self-reported current smoking of any tobacco (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.02-3.54) and current cigarette smoking (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 0.75-3.04) were associated with elevated colorectal cancer risks, although the latter was not statistically significant.

The androgen receptor (AR)-binding transcription factor RUNX2 has been linked to prostate cancer progression but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully defined. In this study, we investigated the genome-wide influence of RUNX2 on androgen-induced gene expression and AR DNA binding in prostate cancer cells. RUNX2 inhibited the androgen response partly by promoting the dissociation of AR from its target genes such as the tumor suppressor NKX3-1. However, AR activity persists in the presence of RUNX2 at other AR target genes, some of which are cooperatively stimulated by androgen and RUNX2 signaling. These genes are associated with putative enhancers co-occupied by AR and RUNX2. One such gene, the invasion-promoting Snail family transcription factor SNAI2, was co-activated by AR and RUNX2. Indeed, these two transcription factors together, but neither alone stimulated prostate cancer cell invasiveness, which could be abolished by SNAI2 silencing. Furthermore, an immunohistochemical analysis of SNAI2 in archived primary prostate cancer specimens revealed a correlation with the RUNX2 histoscore, and simultaneous strong staining for SNAI2, RUNX2, and AR (but not any pair alone) was associated with disease recurrence.

Previously, we reported an induction of Spermidine/Spermine N(1) -Acetyl Transferase (SSAT) by androgen-activated androgen receptor (AR)-JunD protein complex that leads to over-production of ROS in PCa cells. In our current research, we identify small molecules that specifically block AR-JunD in this ROS-generating metabolic pathway.  Methods:   A high throughput assay based on Gaussia Luciferase reconstitution was used to identify inhibitors of the AR-JunD interaction. Selected hits were further screened using a fluorescence polarization competitor assay to eliminate those that bind to the AR Ligand Binding Domain (LBD), in order to identify molecules that specifically target events downstream to androgen activation of AR. Eleven molecules were selected for studies on their efficacy against ROS generation and growth of cultured human PCa cells by DCFH dye-oxidation assay and DNA fluorescence assay, respectively. In situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA), SSAT promoter-luciferase reporter assay, and western blotting of apoptosis and cell cycle markers were used to study mechanism of action of the lead compound.  Results:   Selected lead compound GWARJD10 with EC(50) 10 μM against ROS production was shown to block AR-JunD interaction in situ as well as block androgen-induced SSAT gene expression at IC(50) 5 μM.

Study COU-AA-302 evaluated abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus prednisone alone in mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with progressive mCRPC without prior chemotherapy.  Objective:   Report the prespecified third interim analysis (IA) of efficacy and safety outcomes in study COU-AA-302.  Design, setting, and participants:   Study COU-AA-302, a double-blind placebo-controlled study, enrolled patients with mCRPC from April 2009 to June 2010. A total of 1088 patients were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1).  Intervention:   Patients were randomised 1:1 to abiraterone 1000mg plus prednisone 5mg twice daily by mouth versus prednisone.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Co-primary end points were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). Median times to event outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using the Cox model, and treatment comparison used the log-rank test. The O'Brien-Fleming Lan-DeMets α-spending function was used for OS. Adverse events were summarised descriptively.  Results and limitations:   With a median follow-up duration of 27.1 mo, improvement in rPFS was statistically significant with abiraterone treatment versus prednisone (median: 16.5 vs 8.2 mo; HR: 0.52 [95% CI, 0.45-0.61]; p<0.0001). Abiraterone improved OS (median: 35.3 vs 30.1 mo; HR: 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66-0.95]; p=0.0151) but did not reach the prespecified statistical efficacy boundary (α-level: 0.0035). A post hoc multivariate analysis for OS using known prognostic factors supported the primary results (HR: 0.74 [95% CI, 0.61-0.89]; p=0.0017), and all clinically relevant secondary end points and patient-reported outcomes improved. While the post hoc nature of the long-term safety analysis is a limitation, the safety profile with longer treatment exposure was consistent with prior reports.  Conclusions:   The updated IA of study COU-AA-302 in patients with mCRPC without prior chemotherapy confirms that abiraterone delays disease progression, pain, and functional deterioration and has clinical benefit with a favourable safety profile, including in patients treated for ≥24 mo.  Trial registration:   Study COU-AA-302, ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00887198.  Patient summary:   The updated results of this ongoing study showed that disease progression was delayed in patients with advanced prostate cancer who were treated with abiraterone acetate and prednisone, and there was a continued trend in prolongation of life compared with patients treated with prednisone alone.

Methods:   Between 2005 and 2012 the records of the 401 patients who underwent RP with a diagnosis of PCa were examined. Of these patients, 173 were found to be candidates of AS. The inclusion criteria were as follows; clinical stage T2a or less, PSA<10ng/ml, 2 or fewer cores involved with cancer, no single core with 50% or greater maximum involvement of cancer, and no Gleason grade greater than 3 in the specimen.  Results:   Univariate analyzes revealed that patients with advanced stage disease have higher prostate specific antigen density (PSAD), higher maximum percent (max%) in positive cores and higher RP tumor volumes. In multivariate analyzes PSAD, max% in positive cores and RP tumor volumes were statistically significant determinants for advanced stage disease. ROC analyzes revealed that the RP tumor volume is a good test on advanced stage disease.  Conclusions:   Decreasing the cutoff values for PSAD and max% in positive cores should be considered for AS inclusion criteria. If we could calculate the tumor volume before RP, we can minimize the treatment failures (over or undertreatment) of PCa.

We analyzed the efficacy and tolerability of 3- weekly and weekly docetaxel in a Turkish cohort of CRPC patients with a special emphasis on the elderly patients.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective analyses of 45 patients who received either 3- weekly or weekly docetaxel in a single urologic oncology clinic was performed. Response to therapy, toxicity and overall survival rates were evaluated.  Results:   The mean age of patients was 70.0 (±8.8) years. Complete or partial PSA response was obtained in 45% of patients. The median overall survival was 20,0 months (SE 6.46; 95% CI 7,3-32,6). Absence of metastasis, time to CRPC>10 months, DP 75mg/m2 once every three weeks and PSA<50% at the end of the third cycle were associated with better overall survival. There was no significant survival difference between the patients aged 75 or older versus younger ones. The most common hematological toxicity was leukopenia which was dose limiting in only one patient.  Conclusion:   Administration of standart 3-weekly docetaxel is well tolerated in this relatively old cohort of Turkish CRPC patients and weekly administration can be a reasonable alternative in frail patients not only to prolong survival but also to palliate disease symptoms.""","""['N Mangir', 'L Türkeri']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Efficacy and toxicity of abiraterone and docetaxel in octogenarians with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Feasibility of tri-weekly docetaxel-based chemotherapy for elderly patients (age 75 and older) with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Oncological outcome of docetaxel-based chemotherapy for Japanese men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Practical guide to the use of chemotherapy in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: changing landscape with cabazitaxel.', 'An Improved In Vivo Methodology to Visualise Tumour Induced Changes in Vasculature Using the Chick Chorionic Allantoic Membrane Assay.']"""

To date, it has been described in bone cancer, SHH-medulloblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia, amongst others, however there are still no formal or automated methods for detecting or annotating it in high throughput sequencing data. As such, findings of chromothripsis are difficult to compare and many cases likely escape detection altogether.  Results:   We introduce ShatterProof, a software tool for detecting and quantifying chromothriptic events. ShatterProof takes structural variation calls (translocations, copy-number variations, short insertions and loss of heterozygosity) produced by any algorithm and using an operational definition of chromothripsis performs robust statistical tests to accurately predict the presence and location of chromothriptic events. Validation of our tool was conducted using clinical data sets including matched normal, prostate cancer samples in addition to the colorectal cancer and SCLC data sets used in the original description of chromothripsis.  Conclusions:   ShatterProof is computationally efficient, having low memory requirements and near linear computation time.

The acquisition of cell motility is a key property of metastatic tumor cells and is a prerequisite for invasion. Rho GTPases regulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization and the cellular responses required for cell motility and invasion. Diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), an enzyme that phosphorylates diacylglycerol to yield phosphatidic acid, regulates the activity of the Rho GTPases Rac1 and RhoA. DGKζ mRNA is highly expressed in several different colon cancer cell lines, as well as in colon cancer tissue relative to normal colonic epithelium, and thus may contribute to the metastatic process.  Methods:   To investigate potential roles of DGKζ in cancer metastasis, a cellular, isogenic model of human colorectal cancer metastatic transition was used. DGKζ protein levels, Rac1 and RhoA activity, and PAK phosphorylation were measured in the non-metastatic SW480 adenocarcinoma cell line and its highly metastatic variant, the SW620 line. The effect of DGKζ silencing on Rho GTPase activity and invasion through Matrigel-coated Transwell inserts was studied in SW620 cells. Invasiveness was also measured in PC-3 prostate cancer and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells depleted of DGKζ.  Results:   DGKζ protein levels were elevated approximately 3-fold in SW620 cells compared to SW480 cells. There was a concomitant increase in active Rac1 in SW620 cells, as well as substantial increases in the expression and phosphorylation of the Rac1 effector PAK1. Similarly, RhoA activity and expression were increased in SW620 cells. Knockdown of DGKζ expression in SW620 cells by shRNA-mediated silencing significantly reduced Rac1 and RhoA activity and attenuated the invasiveness of SW620 cells in vitro. DGKζ silencing in highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and PC-3 prostate cancer cells also significantly attenuated their invasiveness.  Conclusion:   Elevated DGKζ expression contributes to increased Rho GTPase activation and the enhanced motility of metastatic cancer cells. These findings warrant further investigation of the clinical relevance of DGKζ upregulation in colon and other cancers.

By a retrospective study, we aim to ascertain the impact of the use of fiducial-based IGRT on lymph node planned target volume (PTV) coverage.  Methods:   30 consecutive IMRT prostate and pelvic node plans were reviewed, and dose was recalculated with 1-mm increment movements in anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, right and left directions up to 10 mm. All patients were treated with a full bladder after drinking 450-750 ml of water and empty rectum with the use of sodium citrate enemas daily. Dose-volume histogram parameters were recorded at each position, specifically nodal PTV V95%, V99% and V100%. A local IGRT database was used to identify the likelihood of a particular bony to fiducial offset in all directions. The combined data were used to calculate the percentage risk of underdosing the lymph node PTV on any given fraction.  Results:   The likelihood of an offset in the left, right and anterior directions occurring and resulting in a failure to cover the PTV was <0.25%. The likelihood of a posterior offset occurring and resulting in inadequate coverage was slightly higher but remained <1%.  Conclusion:   This study confirms the safety of fiducial-based image-guided IMRT (IG-IMRT) with a strict bowel and bladder protocol, allowing a reduction of the clinical target volume to PTV margin of the prostate volume and consequent reduction in rectal toxicity.

This study examined the risk of a new primary cancer following an initial skin cancer and assessed risk factors associated with second primary cancers.  Methods:   All invasive cutaneous malignant melanomas (CMM, N = 28 069) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC, N = 24 620) diagnosed in Norway during 1955-2008 were included. Rates of new primary cancers in skin cancer survivors were compared to rates of primary malignancies in the general population using standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Discrete-time logistic regression models were applied to individual-level data to estimate cancer risk among those with and without a prior skin cancer, accounting for residential region, education, income, parenthood, marital status and parental cancer status, using a 20% random sample of the entire Norwegian population as reference. Further analyses of the skin cancer cohort were undertaken to determine risk factors related to subsequent cancers.  Results:   During follow-up, 9608 new primary cancers occurred after an initial skin cancer. SIR analyses showed 50% and 90% increased risks for any cancer after CMM and SCC, respectively (p < 0.01). The logistic regression model suggested even stronger increase after SCC (130%). The highest risk was seen for subsequent skin cancers, but several non-skin cancers were also diagnosed in excess: oral, lung, colon, breast, prostate, thyroid, leukemia, lymphoma and central nervous system. Factors that were associated with increased risk of subsequent cancers include male sex, older age, lower residential latitude, being married and low education and income. Parental cancer did not increase the risk of a subsequent cancer after SCC, but was a significant predictor among younger CMM survivors.  Conclusions:   Our results provide information on shared environmental and genetic risk factors for first and later cancers and may help to identify individuals at high risk for subsequent cancers, which will be important as skin cancer incidence continues to rise.""","""['Trude E Robsahm', 'Margaret R Karagas', 'Judy R Rees', 'Astri Syse']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Incidence of invasive cancers following cutaneous malignant melanoma.', 'Risks of different skin tumour combinations after a first melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma in Dutch population-based cohorts: 1989-2009.', 'Long-term Change in the Risk of Skin Cancer After Organ Transplantation: A Population-Based Nationwide Cohort Study.', 'Ultraviolet radiation and malignant melanoma.', 'Risk of subsequent cutaneous malignancy in patients with prior melanoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Use of antihypertensive drugs and risk of cutaneous melanoma: a nationwide nested case-control study.', 'Common genetic polymorphisms contribute to the association between chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-melanoma skin cancer.', 'Use of Immunomodulating Drugs and Risk of Cutaneous Melanoma: A Nationwide Nested Case-Control Study.', 'Sunscreen application technique amongst patients with a history of skin cancer.', 'Premalignant lesions, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Objective:   We compared the impact of a technology-assisted symptom monitoring system versus usual care on HRQOL and doctor/patient communication in early-stage prostate cancer (PCa) survivors.  Methods:   Men (N = 94) were on average 62-years old, mostly African American (AA; 61.7%), and 10-19 months post-treatment. They were randomized to symptom monitoring plus feedback (SM + F; n = 49) or usual care (UC; n = 45). SM+F participants completed a 12-item telephoneassisted monitoring intervention. All participants completed a baseline and 2 follow-up interviews.  Results:   Among the SM+F participants, perceptions of the monitoring system were positive: 97.1% endorsed it as easy/very easy to use and 85% felt all patients could benefit from it. At baseline, men reported favorable general and cancer-specific HRQOL and doctor/patient communication, but poorer urinary and sexual function. Although there was no overall impact of the intervention, post hoc exploratory analyses indicated that among AA men, those who received SM+F improved relative to UC on doctor/patient communication (P < .05), general HRQOL (P < .06), and sexual function (P < .05).  Limitations:   Variability in survivor follow-up care, limited access to eligible participants, and minimal physician training in the use of reports likely decreased physician investment.  Conclusion:   Overall, PCa survivors were receptive to this monitoring system. Exploratory analyses suggest that this technology-assisted monitoring system may be of particular benefit to African American men. Additional studies with larger samples, more intervention time-points, and increased physician training are needed to strengthen the intervention's impact.""","""['Kimberly M Davis', 'David Dawson', 'Scott Kelly', 'Sara Red', 'Sofiya Penek', 'John Lynch', 'Sean Collins', 'Barlow Lynch', 'Michael Porrazzo', 'Michael Bass', 'Kathryn L Taylor']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Support Oncol""","""['Health-Related Quality of Life, Psychological Distress, and Sexual Changes Following Prostate Cancer: A Comparison of Gay and Bisexual Men with Heterosexual Men.', 'Long-term health-related quality of life after primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: results from the CaPSURE registry.', 'A Remote Medication Monitoring System for Chronic Heart Failure Patients to Reduce Readmissions: A Two-Arm Randomized Pilot Study.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life among long-term (≥5\xa0years) prostate cancer survivors by primary intervention: a systematic review.', 'Oncological surgery follow-up and quality of life: meta-analysis.', 'Optimal assessment of quality of life for patients with prostate cancer.', 'Patient-reported outcome measurement implementation in cancer survivors: a systematic review.', 'Routine provision of feedback from patient-reported outcome measurements to healthcare providers and patients in clinical practice.', 'Patient outcomes, patient experiences and process indicators associated with the routine use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in cancer care: a systematic review.']"""

This study was to confirm that miR-494-3p might be a potentially post-transcriptional regulator of CXCR4 and over-expression of miR-494 might suppress prostate cancer progression and metastasis.  Materials and methods:   We firstly postulated the post-transcriptional regulation of CXCR4 by miR-494-3p through bioinformatics analysis, and then it was demonstrated that miR-494-3p could regulate the CXCR4 mRNA post-transcriptionally by binding to the predicted site by dual reporter gene assays. The biological effect of miR-494-3p on prostate cancer cells proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion was measured by MTT, TUNEL, flow cytometry, migration, and invasion assays.  Results:   It was shown that the mRNA and protein expression levels of CXCR4 were significantly up-regulated in PC-3 and DU145, whereas barely detected in LNCaP and RWPE-1. However, the CXCR4 protein levels were inversely related to the mature miR-494-3p expression levels in RWPE-1 and prostate cancer cells. The constitutive over-expression of miR-494-3p could down-regulate the protein level of CXCR4 in PC-3 and DU145. MiR-494-3p also could bind to the seed sequences in the 3'-UTR of the CXCR4 gene. Artificial over-expression of miR-494-3p could inhibit the growth, promote the apoptosis, and inhibit the migration and invasion of PC-3 and DU145 cells in vivo.  Conclusions:   Our results suggested that miR-494-3p might play crucial role in prostate cancer by post-transcriptional regulation to CXCR4 mRNA.

Methods:   We performed a population-based cohort study including incident cancer patients diagnosed from 1 October 2007 to 30 September 2008 in two regions in Denmark. Fourteen months after diagnosis, participants completed a questionnaire measuring different aspects and dimensions of rehabilitation. Individual information on comorbidity was based on hospital contacts from 1994 and until diagnosis, subsequently classified according to the Charlson comorbidity index. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the association between comorbidity and outcomes for rehabilitation. Analyses were conducted overall and stratified for gender, age and cancer type.  Results:   A total of 3,439 patients responded (70%). Comorbidity at all levels was statistically significant associated with a physical rehabilitation need, and moderate to severe comorbidity was statistically significant associated with a need in the emotional, family-oriented and financial areas as well as participation in physical-related rehabilitation activities. Stratified analyses showed that significant results in most cases were related to being older than 65 years or having colorectal or prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Comorbidity at all levels was significantly associated with needs for physical rehabilitation. Moderate to severe comorbidity was further associated with other areas of need and participation in physical area activities. This should be taken into account when planning rehabilitation interventions for cancer survivors.

This article describes the distribution of common comorbid conditions by disease site and by patient and facility characteristics in patients who received radiation therapy as part of treatment for cancer of the breast, cervix, lung, prostate, and stomach, and investigates the association of comorbidities with treatment decisions.  Materials and methods:   Stratified two-stage cluster sampling provided a random sample of radiation oncology facilities. Eligible patients were randomly sampled from each participating facility for each disease site, and data were abstracted from medical records. The Adult Comorbidity Evaluation Index (ACE-27) was used to measure comorbid conditions and their severity. National estimates were calculated using SUDAAN statistical software.  Results:   Multivariable logistic regression models predicted the dependent variable ""treatment changed or contraindicated due to comorbidities."" The final model showed that ACE-27 was highly associated with change in treatment for patients with severe or moderate index values compared to those with none or mild (P < .001). Two other covariates, age and medical coverage, had no (age) or little (medical coverage) significant contribution to predicting treatment change in the multivariable model. Disease site was associated with treatment change after adjusting for other covariates in the model.  Conclusions:   ACE-27 is highly predictive of treatment modifications for patients treated for these cancers who receive radiation as part of their care. A standardized tool identifying patients who should be excluded from clinical performance measures allows more accurate use of these measures.""","""['Jean B Owen', 'Najma Khalid', 'Alex Ho', 'Lisa A Kachnic', 'Ritsuko Komaki', 'May Lin Tao', 'Adam Currey', 'J Frank Wilson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Oncol Pract""","""['Patterns of radiation therapy practice for patients treated for intact cervical cancer in 2005 to 2007: a quality research in radiation oncology study.', 'The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program risk calculator does not adequately stratify risk for patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Patterns of brachytherapy practice for patients with carcinoma of the cervix (1996-1999): a patterns of care study.', 'Effect of age and comorbidity in postmenopausal breast cancer patients aged 55 years and older.', 'Management of Prostate Cancer in Elderly Patients: Recommendations of a Task Force of the International Society of Geriatric Oncology.', 'Comorbidity Assessment in Skin Cancer Patients: A Pilot Study Comparing Medical Interview with a Patient-Reported Questionnaire.']"""

Our aim was to assess the role of ZIP4 in invasiveness, migration and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prognostic value of ZIP4 in HCC after liver transplantation was evaluated.  Methods:   The role of ZIP4 in HCC was investigated by overexpressing ZIP4 in BEL7402 and HepG2 cells and inhibiting ZIP4 in HuH-7 and HepG2 cells, using overexpression and shRNA plasmids in vitro studies. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate ZIP4 expression in HCC tissues from 60 patients undergoing liver transplantation, 36 cirrhotic tissue samples, and 6 normal tissue samples. Prognostic significance was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.  Results:   Specific suppression of ZIP4 reduced cell migration and invasiveness, whereas ZIP4 overexpression caused increases in cell migration and invasiveness. Furthermore, overexpression of ZIP4 resulted in increased expression of pro-metastatic genes (MMP-2, MMP-9) and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic genes (caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax). In contrast, suppression of ZIP4 resulted in an opposite effect. ZIP4 was more highly expressed in tumor tissues than non-tumor tissues (P < 0.0001). ZIP4 expression was significantly associated with tumor recurrence (P = 0.002), tumor node metastasis stage (P = 0.044), Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (P = 0.042), and tumor size (P = 0.022). Univariate analysis showed that ZIP4 expression was significantly associated with overall survival (P = 0.020) and tumor-free survival (P = 0.049). Multivariate analysis revealed that ZIP4 was an independent predictor of overall survival (P = 0.037) after liver transplantation.

It has extensively been shown to inhibit tumor growth in nude mice bearing human xenografts of hematopoietic, breast, lung, ovarian, brain, and prostate origin. However, high tumor-suppressive Nos dosages encumber the development of oral controlled-release formulations because of a short biological half-life (<2 h), poor absorption, low aqueous solubility, and extensive first-pass metabolism. Here, we present the design, fabrication, optimization, characterization, and biological evaluation of estrone-conjugated noscapine-loaded gelatin nanoparticles (Nos-ES-GN) for targeting estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Gelatin nanoparticles (GN) were a uniformly compact size, stable at physiological pH, and showed a drug entrapment efficiency of 66.1±5.9 and 65.2±5.6% for Nos-GN and Nos-ES-GN, respectively. The secondary structure of gelatin nanocoacervates was predicted using circular dichroism and in-silico molecular modeling. Our data suggest that ethanol-fabricated GN retained the α-helical content of gelatin, whereas acetone favored the formation of random coils. The conjugation of estrone to Nos-GN did not affect the release rate of the drug, and both formulations followed first-order release kinetics with an initial burst, followed by a slow release. The IC50 value of Nos-ES-GN was 21.2 μmol/l, which was ∼50% lower than the free drug (43.3 μmol/l), suggesting targeted drug delivery. Our cell uptake study carried out in an estrogen-receptor-positive (MCF-7) and negative (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines showed greater accumulation of Nos-ES-GN in MCF-7 cells instead of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data indicated that estrone-conjugated nanoparticles may potentially be used for targeting breast cancer cells.""","""['Jitender Madan', 'Sushma R Gundala', 'Yoganjaneyulu Kasetti', 'Prasad V Bharatam', 'Ritu Aneja', 'Anju Katyal', 'Upendra K Jain']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Long-circulating poly(ethylene glycol)-grafted gelatin nanoparticles customized for intracellular delivery of noscapine: preparation, in-vitro characterization, structure elucidation, pharmacokinetics, and cytotoxicity analyses.', 'Enhanced noscapine delivery using uPAR-targeted optical-MR imaging trackable nanoparticles for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Estrogen-anchored pH-sensitive liposomes as nanomodule designed for site-specific delivery of doxorubicin in breast cancer therapy.', 'Implications of nanoscale based drug delivery systems in delivery and targeting tubulin binding agent, noscapine in cancer cells.', 'Improved anti-tumoral capacity of mixed and pure anti-oestrogens in breast cancer cell xenografts after their administration by entrapment in colloidal nanosystems.', 'Acute and Subacute Toxicity Assessment of Andrographolide-2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin Complex via Oral and Inhalation Route of Administration in Sprague-Dawley Rats.', 'Application of Nanoparticles in the Treatment of Lung Cancer With Emphasis on Receptors.', 'Receptor-Mediated Targeted Delivery of Surface-ModifiedNanomedicine in Breast Cancer: Recent Update and Challenges.', 'Dendritic cell engineering for selective targeting of female reproductive tract cancers.', 'Nanoparticles Based on Linear and Star-Shaped Poly(Ethylene Glycol)-Poly(ε-Caprolactone) Copolymers for the Delivery of Antitubulin Drug.']"""

Previously, we reported promotion of castration-resistance upon downregulation of PPP2CA (encoding catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), α-isoform); however, its role in PCa growth and metastasis remained undetermined.  Methods:   PPP2CA was overexpressed/silenced in PCa cells by stable transfection. Gene expression was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses, and transcriptional activity measured by luciferase-based promoter-reporter assay. Effect on PCa phenotype was studied in vitro and in orthotopic mouse model, and immunohistochemical/histological analyses performed to assess proliferation/apoptosis and confirm metastatic lesions.  Results:   An inverse association of PPP2CA expression was observed with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and aggressive PCa phenotype. PPP2CA restoration resulted in decreased nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of β-catenin/NF-κB, and restitution of their activity abrogated PPP2CA-induced EMT reversal and suppression of PCa invasiveness. Akt mediated PPP2CA loss-induced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin/NF-κB through inactivation of Gsk3-β and IκB-α, respectively. Animal studies revealed a suppressive effect of PPP2CA expression on PCa growth and metastasis.

Here, we determined that exposure of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to the cytokine IL-6 activates the oncogenic STAT3 transcription factor, which directly represses the MIR34A gene via a conserved STAT3-binding site in the first intron. Repression of MIR34A was required for IL-6-induced EMT and invasion. Furthermore, we identified the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which mediates IL-6-dependent STAT3 activation, as a conserved, direct miR-34a target.

Often, RAS/ERK signaling is activated by mutation of the RAS or RAF oncogenes, and PI3K/AKT is activated by loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN. In prostate cancer, PTEN deletions are common, but, unlike other carcinomas, RAS and RAF mutations are rare. We have previously shown that over-expression of ""oncogenic"" ETS transcription factors, which occurs in about one-half of prostate tumors due to chromosome rearrangement, can bypass the need for RAS/ERK signaling in the activation of a cell migration gene expression program. In this study we test the role of RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling in the function of oncogenic ETS proteins.  Results:   We find that oncogenic ETS expression negatively correlates with RAS and RAF mutations in prostate tumors. Furthermore, the oncogenic ETS transcription factors only increased cell migration in the absence of RAS/ERK activation. In contrast to RAS/ERK, it has been reported that oncogenic ETS expression positively correlates with PI3K/AKT activation. We identified a mechanistic explanation for this finding by showing that oncogenic ETS proteins required AKT signaling to activate a cell migration gene expression program through ETS/AP-1 binding sequences. Levels of pAKT correlated with the ability of oncogenic ETS proteins to increase cell migration, but this process did not require mTORC1.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that oncogenic ETS rearrangements cause a cell migration gene expression program to switch from RAS/ERK control to PI3K/AKT control and provide a possible explanation for the high frequency of PTEN, but not RAS/RAF mutations in prostate cancer.""","""['Nagarathinam Selvaraj', 'Justin A Budka', 'Mary W Ferris', 'Travis J Jerde', 'Peter C Hollenhorst']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['RAS/ERK pathway transcriptional regulation through ETS/AP-1 binding sites.', 'PTEN expression controls cellular response to cetuximab by mediating PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF/MAPK downstream signaling in KRAS wild-type, hormone refractory prostate cancer cells.', 'Ran is a potential therapeutic target for cancer cells with molecular changes associated with activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways.', 'A minireview: the role of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways in thyroid follicular cell-derived neoplasm.', 'Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR inhibitors: rationale and importance to inhibiting these pathways in human health.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'The prognosis analysis of RFWD2 inhibiting the expression of ETV1 in colorectal cancer.', 'Role of PI3K/Akt pathway in Benzidine-induced proliferation in SV-40 immortalized human uroepithelial cell.', 'Schlafen 11 expression in human acute leukemia cells with gain-of-function mutations in the interferon-JAK signaling pathway.', 'Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling differentially regulate oncogenic ERG mediated transcription in prostate cells.']"""

Results:   Overall, the percentage of agreement of PCa laterality between BP and RP was 60% (K = 0.27, p < 0.001). However, the RP confirmation of unilaterality at BP was obtained in just 33% of the cases.

Three independent readers blinded to clinical and pathological data assigned a prostate cancer suspicion grade based on qualitative imaging analysis. Final pathology results of prostates with and without cancer served as the reference standard. Primary outcomes were the sensitivity and specificity of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging for detecting significant prostate cancer with significance defined as a largest diameter of the index lesion of 1 cm or greater, extraprostatic extension, or Gleason score 7 or greater on final pathology assessment. Secondary outcomes were interreader agreement assessed by the Fleiss κ coefficient and image reading time.  Results:   Of the 111 patients 93 had prostate cancer, which was significant in 80 and insignificant in 13, and 18 had no prostate cancer on final pathology results. The sensitivity and specificity of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging for detecting significant PCa was 89% to 91% and 77% to 81%, respectively, for the 3 readers. Interreader agreement was good (Fleiss κ 0.65 to 0.74). Median reading time was between 13 and 18 minutes.  Conclusions:   Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (3 Tesla) is a noninvasive technique that allows for the detection of significant prostate cancer with high probability without contrast medium or an endorectal coil, and with good interreader agreement and a short reading time.

Recent evidence suggests that baseline prostate specific antigen is strongly predictive of the long-term risk of aggressive prostate cancer. We compared the usefulness of risk stratifying early screening by race, family history and prostate specific antigen at age 45 years.  Materials and methods:   Using estimates from the literature we calculated the proportion of men targeted for early screening using family history, black race or prostate specific antigen as the criterion for high risk. We calculated the proportion of prostate cancer deaths that would occur in those men by age 75 years.  Results:   Screening based on family history involved 10% of men, accounting for 14% of prostate cancer deaths. Using black race as a risk criterion involved 13% of men, accounting for 28% of deaths. In contrast, 44% of prostate cancer deaths occurred in the 10% of men with the highest prostate specific antigen at age 45 years. In no sensitivity analysis for race and family history did the ratio of risk group size to number of prostate cancer deaths in that risk group approach that of prostate specific antigen.  Conclusions:   Basing decisions for early screening on prostate specific antigen at age 45 years provided the best ratio between men screened and potential cancer deaths avoided. Given the lack of evidence that race or family history affects the relationship between prostate specific antigen and risk, prostate specific antigen based risk stratification would likely include any black men or men with a family history who are destined to experience aggressive disease.

Radiation biological considerations are based on the assumption that the α/β value for prostate cancer cells is 1.5 Gy, so that a biologically more effective dose could be administered due to hypofractionation without increasing risks of late effects of bladder (α/β = 4.0) and rectum (α/β = 3.9).

There is sound theoretical rationale and emerging evidence that exercise may be an innovative therapy to counteract sexual dysfunction in men with prostate cancer. Furthermore, despite the multidimensional aetiology of sexual dysfunction, there is a paucity of research investigating the efficacy of integrated treatment models. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to: 1) examine the efficacy of exercise as a therapy to aid in the management of sexual dysfunction in men with prostate cancer; 2) determine if combining exercise and brief psychosexual intervention results in more pronounced improvements in sexual health; and 3) assess if any benefit of exercise and psychosexual intervention on sexual dysfunction is sustained long term.  Methods/design:   A three-arm, multi-site randomised controlled trial involving 240 prostate cancer survivors will be implemented. Participants will be randomised to: 1) 'Exercise' intervention; 2) 'Exercise + Psychosexual' intervention; or 3) 'Usual Care'. The Exercise group will receive a 6-month, group based, supervised resistance and aerobic exercise intervention. The Exercise + Psychosexual group will receive the same exercise intervention plus a brief psychosexual self-management intervention that addresses psychological and sexual well-being. The Usual Care group will maintain standard care for 6 months. Measurements for primary and secondary endpoints will take place at baseline, 6 months (post-intervention) and 1 year follow-up. The primary endpoint is sexual health and secondary endpoints include key factors associated with sexual health in men with prostate cancer.  Discussion:   Sexual dysfunction is one of the most prevalent and distressing consequences of prostate cancer. Despite this, very little is known about the management of sexual dysfunction and current health care services do not adequately meet sexual health needs of survivors. This project will examine the potential role of exercise in the management of sexual dysfunction and evaluate a potential best-practice management approach by integrating pharmacological, physiological and psychological treatment modalities to address the complex and multifaceted aetiology of sexual dysfunction following cancer.

The mechanism by which genistein and daidzein have an inhibiting action on DNA methylation is not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soy phytoestrogens and the natural estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2) to determine whether one of the estrogen receptors is mobilized for the action of these compounds on DNA methylation. We also made a comparative study with a DNA methylation inhibitor (5-azacytidine) and a DNA methylation activator (budesonide). Three prostate cell lines, PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP, were treated with 40 μM genistein, 110 μM daidzein, 2 μM budesonide, 2 μM 5-azacytidine, and 10 μM E2. In these 3 human prostate cancer cell lines, we performed methylation quantification using methyl-profiler-DNA-methylation analysis. Soy phytoestrogens and E2 induced a demethylation of all the promoter regions studied except for those that were unmethylated in control cells. Our results showed that E2 induces, like soy phytoestrogen, a decrease in DNA methylation in prostate cancer cell lines. This action may be mediated through ERβ.""","""['Mawussi Adjakly', 'Marjolaine Ngollo', 'André Lebert', 'Aslihan Dagdemir', 'Frédérique Penault-Llorca', 'Jean-Paul Boiteux', 'Yves-Jean Bignon', 'Laurent Guy', 'Dominique Bernard-Gallon']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Nutr Cancer""","""['DNA methylation and soy phytoestrogens: quantitative study in DU-145 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Genome-wide DNA methylation modified by soy phytoestrogens: role for epigenetic therapeutics in prostate cancer?', 'Soy phytoestrogens modify DNA methylation of GSTP1, RASSF1A, EPH2 and BRCA1 promoter in prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms underlying the dualistic mode of action of major soy isoflavones in relation to cell proliferation and cancer risks.', 'Prostate cancer: The main risk and protective factors-Epigenetic modifications.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Isoflavones with an Emphasis on Daidzein.', 'Dietary Compounds as Epigenetic Modulating Agents in Cancer.', '17β-Estradiol and 17α-Ethinyl Estradiol Exhibit Immunologic and Epigenetic Regulatory Effects in NZB/WF1 Female Mice.', 'Our Environment Shapes Us: The Importance of Environment and Sex Differences in Regulation of Autoantibody Production.', 'Risks and benefits related to alimentary exposure to xenoestrogens.']"""

ICT2588 is a peptide-conjugated prodrug of the vascular disrupting agent (VDA) azademethylcolchicine developed to be selectively hydrolyzed by matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14) within the tumor. In this report, we extend our previous proof-of-concept studies and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this agent against models of human colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancer. In all tumor types, ICT2588 was superior to azademethylcolchicine and was greater or comparable to standard clinically used agents for the respective tumor type. Prodrug activation in clinical human lung tumor homogenates relative to stability in human plasma and liver was observed, supporting clinical translation potential. A major limiting factor to the clinical value of VDAs is their inherent cardiovascular toxicity. No increase in plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels, an indicator of systemic vascular dysfunction and acute cardiovascular toxicity, was detected with ICT2588, thereby supporting the tumor-selective activation and reduced potential of ICT2588 to cause cardiovascular toxicity.

Our study aimed at evaluating the correlation of periprostatic fat (PF) on magnatic resonance imaging (MRI) and adipocytokines with prostate cancer aggressiveness.  Patients and method:   A total of 184 patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) were analyzed retrospectively; different fat measurements on MRI slices and levels of adipocytokines were compared with the clinical and pathologic factors using SSPS ver.13.0.  Result:   The PF rates showed a statistically significant variation (p=0.019, 0.025) among groups, that is to say, more adipose tissue was distributed in periprostatic areas of high risk patients. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age revealed a statistically association between the PF, the ratio and the risk of having high-risk disease (p=0.031, 0.024). The levels of IL-6, leptin and c-reactive protein (CRP) significantly increased with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer, and also with PF and its ratio. The strongest correlation was seen between IL-6 and PF (Pearson r coefficient=0.67, P<0.001). No association was observed between adipocytokines and BMI.

Methods:   120 patients suspicious for prostate cancer underwent TRTE. Targeted biopsies were carried out after 12-core systematic biopsy. Epithelia were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and Victoria blue and Ponceau S were used to stain elastic-collagen fibers, and picric acid-sirius red for visualization of collagen type I (Col1) and III (Col3). Smooth muscles were visualized by immunohistochemistry. All image analyses were performed in a blind manner using Image Pro Plus 6.0, and the area ratios of epithelium, elastic fibers, collagen fibers and Col1/Col3 were determined.  Results:   42 patients with typical elastograms were included in the final data analysis. Significant differences were detected between the benign and malignant groups in the area ratios of epithelium (P = 0.01), smooth muscles and Col1/Col3 (P = 0.04, P = 0.02, respectively). There were no significant differences in the area ratios of epithelium, smooth muscle and elastic fibers between the stiff and soft lesion groups.

Sorafenib is also known to bind to protein (>99.5%), suggesting protein binding may be involved in sorafenib pharmacokinetic variability. Albumin is a major drug-binding protein. In this study, we examined the effect of albumin on sorafenib-induced cytotoxicity using two in vitro culture cell lines, human hepatoma Huh-7 cells and androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells. The cells were cultured and incubated, and cytotoxicity was assessed. Results were confirmed by western blotting. The presence of exogenous albumin markedly blocked the sorafenib-induced cytotoxicity in the two cell lines. Albumin concentration, the change of pharmacological signal transduction as Raf-B, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and phosphorylation of MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 were found to be decreased by sorafenib. Co-incubation of warfarin, a representative coumarin anticoagulant and potent binding activity, with albumin enhanced the cytotoxic effects by sorafenib. These mechanisms depend on the high binding proper ties of sorafenib and exogenous albumin. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of endo genous albumin expression on sorafenib-induced cytotoxicity using the siRNA knockdown system or transfected expression vector assay. However, the cytotoxic effects by sorafenib showed little change either with the knockdown or overexpression of albumin. Our results suggest that particular care should be taken with albuminemia or the combined use of drugs with a high affinity for albumin, such as warfarin, and sorafenib in the treatment of cancer patients.

This research defines chronic cancer, explores patient experiences and reviews patients' support needs against those described in the 2007 Department of Health Generic Choice Model for Long-term Conditions (DoH-GCM).  Design:   Semistructured interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and data explored for emergent themes. The a priori themes from DoH-GCM were applied: clinical support; self-care and self-management; supporting independence; psychological support; and social and economic factors.  Results:   56 patients >12 months postdiagnosis of advanced cancer were recruited from five clinics at a Yorkshire cancer centre: breast (n=11); renal (n=11); colorectal/gastrointestinal (n=12); gynaecological (n=12); and prostate (n=10). Most patients aspired to living normal lives. Challenges included frequent and lengthy hospital appointments, long-term symptom control and uncertainty. Only renal and prostate patients reported routine access to specialist nursing. Uptake of support services was varied and there was generally poor understanding of support pathways for non-medical problems and issues occurring when patients were not receiving active treatment. There was variation in coping strategies and ability of patients to attain a positive outlook on life.  Conclusions:   For patients to do well in this cancer phase requires good self-management of symptoms plus taking an active role in accessing appropriate services as needed.

The aim of this study was to examine cancer mortality trends in the population of central Serbia in the period from 2002 to 2011.  Methods:   The descriptive epidemiological method was used. The mortality from all malignant tumors (code C00-C96 of the International Disease Classification) was registered. The source of mortality data was the published material of the Cancer Registry of Serbia. The source of population data was the census of 2002 and 2011 and the estimates for inter-census years. Non-standardized, age-adjusted and age-specific mortality rates were calculated. Age adjustment of mortality rates was performed by the direct method of standardization. Trend lines were estimated using linear regression.  Results:   During 2002-2011, cancer caused about 20% of all deaths each year in central Serbia. More men (56.9%) than women (43.1%) died of cancer. The average mortality rate for men was 1.3 times higher compared to women. A significant trend of increase of the age-adjusted mortality rates was recorded both for males (p<0.001) and for females (p=0.02). Except gastric cancer, the age-adjusted mortality rates in men were significantly increased for lung cancer (p=0.02), colorectal cancer (p<0.05), prostate cancer (p=0.01) and pancreatic cancer (p=0.01).

In this study, we attempted to clarify whether the levels of HAI-1 could be a useful marker in patients with prostate cancer (Pca).  Methods:   HAI-1 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HAI-1 mRNA was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 48 patients with Pca and 20 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The association between HAI-1 and clinicopathological features and survival were analyzed.  Results:   A high level of HAI-1 protein and mRNA expression was detected in BPH compared to Pca specimens. The HAI-1 expression inversely correlated with Gleason score and pathological stage (p<0.05). It was significantly stronger in N0M0 tumors than in N+ or M+ tumors (p<0.05). Furthermore, low HAI-1 expression was a significant predictor for poor prognosis when compared with high HAI-1 expression (disease-free survival/DFS rate, p=0.0487; overall survival/ OS rate; p=0.0492).

Aberrant activation of WNT signaling is strongly implicated in the progression of cancer and controls CSCs properties. In this study we hypothesized that when cells were maintained as spheroids, the structure of CSCs could show differentiation between CSCs and non- CSCs.  Methods:   CD133+/CD44+ cancer-initiating cells were isolated from DU-145 human prostate cancer cell line monolayer cultures, propagated as tumor spheroids and compared with the remaining heterogeneous cancer cells bulk population. The expression levels of WNT1, FZD1, ADAR, APC, AXIN, BTRC, FRAT1 and PPARD genes were measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array assay and the protein expression levels of WNT1, FZD and AXIN by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   The expression levels of WNT pathway-related molecules were found to increase in both CSCs and non- CSCs when CSCs were maintained as spheroids. However, different expression profiles were observed when CSCs and non-CSCs were compared. In spheroids, the expression levels of FZD1, APC, ADAR, WNT1, PPARD genes in CSCs decreased when compared to non-CSCs. Interestingly, when CSCs from spheroids were compared with CSCs from monolayers the most significant decrease was observed in FZD1 and increase in APC genes.  Conclusion:   It is possible to assume that intracellular signaling of WNT-related molecules in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm might play an important role but it is independent from increased ligand expression and this expression strongly differentiate CSCs and non-CSCs population. This unexpected expression could be important for CSCs behavior and targeting this pathway could have therapeutic implications in cancer.""","""['Gamze Goksel', 'Ayhan Bilir', 'Ruchan Uslu', 'Hakan Akbulut', 'Ummu Guven', 'Gulperi Oktem']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['Cancer stem cell differentiation: TGFβ1 and versican may trigger molecules for the organization of tumor spheroids.', 'JAK/STAT pathway interacts with intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) while prostate cancer stem cells form tumor spheroids.', 'Phenotypic subpopulations of metastatic colon cancer stem cells: genomic analysis.', 'Targeting CD133 antigen in cancer.', 'CD90 a potential cancer stem cell marker and a therapeutic target.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Previous studies have shown that overexpression of NF-κB2/p52 (p52) in prostate cancer cells promotes cell growth and leads to castration resistance through aberrant activation of androgen receptor (AR). In addition, these cells become resistant to enzalutamide. In this study, we investigated the effects of p52 activation on glucose metabolism and on response to enzalutamide therapy. Data analysis of gene expression arrays showed that genes including GLUT1 (SLC2A1), PKM2, G6PD, and ME1 involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism were altered in LNCaP cells overexpressing p52 compared with the parental LNCaP cells. We demonstrated an increased amount of glucose flux in the glycolysis pathway, as well as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) upon p52 activation. The p52-overexpressing cells increase glucose uptake and are capable of higher ATP and lactate production compared with the parental LNCaP cells. The growth of p52-overexpressing cells depends on glucose in the culture media and is sensitive to glucose deprivation compared with the parental LNCaP cells. Targeting glucose metabolism by the glucose analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose synergistically inhibits cell growth when combined with enzalutamide, and resensitizes p52-overexpressing cells to enzalutamide treatment. These results suggest that p52 modulates glucose metabolism, enhances glucose flux to glycolysis and PPPs, thus facilitating fast proliferation of the cells. Co-targeting glucose metabolism together with AR axis synergistically inhibits cell growth and restores enzalutamide-resistant cells to enzalutamide treatment.""","""['Yuanyuan Cui', 'Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Chengfei Liu', 'Wei Lou', 'Chad T Schwartz', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['NF-κB2/p52 induces resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer: role of androgen receptor and its variants.', 'NF-κB2/p52:c-Myc:hnRNPA1 Pathway Regulates Expression of Androgen Receptor Splice Variants and Enzalutamide Sensitivity in Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: AR aberrations and resistance to abiraterone or enzalutamide.', 'Androgen receptor aberrations in the era of abiraterone and enzalutamide.', 'Quantitative proteomics identified a novel invasion biomarker associated with EMT in pituitary adenomas.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Modulating Glycolysis to Improve Cancer Therapy.', 'Glucose-Functionalized Silver Nanoparticles as a Potential New Therapy Agent Targeting Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer cells.', 'Emerging role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in the mechanism of action and resistance to anticancer therapies.']"""

Methods:   This retrospective cohort study of community-based Medicare beneficiaries used the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (1997–2007). Dependent variables comprised use and spending on SCMs for three medication classes: opioids, antidepressants/sedative/hypnotics (ASH), and antiemetics. Independent variables of interest were supplemental insurance coverage, cancer site, and treatment. Multivariate models determined factors affecting receipt of, and spending on, SCMs. We also compared SCM use and spending among beneficiaries with and without cancer in order to understand what portion of SCM use and spending could be attributed to cancer as opposed to other comorbid conditions.  Results:   A total of 1,836 Medicare beneficiaries with cancer and 9,898 beneficiaries without cancer were eligible for the study. Beneficiaries with cancer were more likely to receive opioids, ASH, and antiemetics compared to non-cancer beneficiaries. Adjusted annual payments for antiemetics were on average $637 higher in with cancer versus without cancer (p<0.01), while ASH payments were $184 lower (p<0.01). Opioid spending was similar among cancer and non-cancer users. Relative to colon cancer, beneficiaries with prostate cancer were least likely to receive any of the three SCM classes. Receipt of antineoplastic treatment increased the probability of use of all three classes of SCMs. Insurance coverage did not influence the use of or spending on opioids or antiemetics, but was associated with both outcomes for ASH. The use of all three SCM classes was significantly lower during years before Part D implementation of the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit and was higher after implementation of Part D.

To induce controlled hyperthermia, culture plates were placed on a flat copper surface of a circulating water manifold that maintained the specimens within ±0.1°C of a target temperature. Hyperthermia protocols included various combinations of temperature, ranging from 37°C to 57°C, and exposure times of up to 2 h. The majority of protocols were focused on temperature and time permutations, where the response gradient was greatest. Post-treatment analysis by flow cytometry analysis was used to measure the incidences of apoptosis (annexin V-FITC stain), necrosis (propidium iodide (PI) stain), and HSP70 transcription (GFP expression).

Methods:   HBD-1 expression in tissues at different stages of oral carcinogenesis, as well as OSCC cell lines was examined. HBD-1 was overexpressed in HSC-3, UM1, SCC-9 and SCC-25 cells and subjected to cell growth, apoptosis, migration and invasion assays. Tissue microarray constructed with tissues from 175 patients was used to examine clinicopathological significance of hBD-1 expression in OSCC.  Results:   HBD-1 expression decreased from oral precancerous lesions to OSCC and was lower in OSCC with lymph node metastasis than those without metastasis. In vitro, the expression of hBD-1 was related to the invasive potential of OSCC cell lines. Induction of exogenous expression of hBD-1 inhibited migration and invasion of OSCC cells, probably by regulation of RhoA, RhoC and MMP-2; but had no significant effect on proliferation or apoptosis. In a cohort of patients with primary OSCC, cases with no expression of hBD-1 had more chance to be involved in lymph node metastasis. Eventually, the positive expression of hBD-1 was associated with longer survival of patients with OSCC, and multivariate analysis and ROC curve analysis confirmed hBD-1 positivity to be an independent prognostic factor of OSCC, especially OSCC at early stage.  Conclusions:   Overall, these data indicated that hBD-1 suppressed tumor migration and invasion of OSCC and was likely to be a prognostic biomarker and a potential target for treatment of OSCC.""","""['Qi Han', 'Ruinan Wang', 'Chongkui Sun', 'Xin Jin', 'Dongjuan Liu', 'Xin Zhao', 'Lili Wang', 'Ning Ji', 'Jing Li', 'Yu Zhou', 'Ling Ye', 'Xinhua Liang', 'Lu Jiang', 'Ga Liao', 'Hongxia Dan', 'Xin Zeng', 'Qianming Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Human β-Defensins in Diagnosis of Head and Neck Cancers.', 'Loss of human beta-defensin 1, 2, and 3 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'RUNX3 plays a tumor suppressor role by inhibiting cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis in oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Human beta-defensin-1, -2, and -3 exhibit opposite effects on oral squamous cell carcinoma cell proliferation.', 'Tumour Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Role of Defensins in Tumor Biology.', 'Human β-Defensins in Diagnosis of Head and Neck Cancers.', 'The Expression of Defensin-Associated Genes May Be Correlated With Lymph Node Metastasis of Early-Stage Tongue Cancer.', '8-Gene signature related to CD8+ T cell infiltration by integrating single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Bladder Tissue Microbiome Composition in Patients of Bladder Cancer or Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Related Human Beta Defensin Levels.']"""

Previous studies suggest that anticoagulant (AC) use may improve treatment outcomes in PC patients. We hypothesized that AC therapy confers a freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) and overall survival (OS) benefit when administered with radiotherapy in patients with high-risk PC.  Materials and methods:   Analysis was performed on 74 high-risk PC patients who were treated with radiotherapy from 2005 to 2008 at UT Southwestern. Of these patients, 43 were on AC including aspirin (95.6%), clopidogrel (17.8%), warfarin (20%), and multiple ACs (31.1%). Associations between AC use and FFBF, OS, distant metastasis, and toxicity were analyzed.  Results:   Median follow-up was 56.6 mo for all patients. For patients taking any AC compared with no AC, there was improved FFBF at 5 years of 80% vs. 62% (P = 0.003), and for aspirin the FFBF was 84% vs. 65% (P = 0.008). Aspirin use was also associated with reduced rates of distant metastases at 5 years (12.2% vs. 26.7%, P = 0.039). On subset analysis of patients with Gleason score (GS) 9-10 histology, aspirin resulted in improved 5-year OS (88% vs. 37%, P = 0.032), which remained significant on multivariable analysis (P<0.05).  Conclusions:   AC use was associated with a FFBF benefit in high-risk PC which translated into an OS benefit in the highest risk PC patients with GS 9-10, who are most likely to experience mortality from PC. This hypothesis-generating result suggests AC use may represent an opportunity to augment current therapy.""","""['Corbin D Jacobs', 'Stephen G Chun', 'Jingsheng Yan', 'Xian-Jin Xie', 'David A Pistenmaa', 'Raquibul Hannan', 'Yair Lotan', 'Claus G Roehrborn', 'Kevin S Choe', 'D W Nathan Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Aspirin use and the risk of prostate cancer mortality in men treated with prostatectomy or radiotherapy.', 'Improved outcomes after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: Anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, and platelet count as key factors in disease progression.', 'Long-term results of adjuvant versus early salvage postprostatectomy radiation: A large single-institutional experience.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'The role of warfarin and aspirin in secondary prevention of stroke.', 'Aspirin use is associated with improvement in distant metastases outcome in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.', 'Aspirin Use Is Associated With Improved Outcomes in Inflammatory Breast Cancer Patients.', 'Aspirin and cancer survival: a systematic review and meta-analyses of 118 observational studies of aspirin and 18 cancers.', 'Integration of machine learning and genome-scale metabolic modeling identifies multi-omics biomarkers for radiation resistance.', 'Inflammatory cell-associated tumors.

Previously, we described an inverse association between RKIP and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression in gastric adenocarcinoma patients. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism by which RKIP regulates STAT3 activity in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. RKIP over expression inhibited c-Src auto-phosphorylation and activation, as well as IL-6-, JAK1 and 2-, and activated Raf-mediated STAT3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation and subsequent activation. In MDA-231 breast cancer cells that stably over express RKIP, IL-6 treatment blocked STAT3 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation. Conversely, in RKIP knockdown MDA-231 cells: STAT3 phosphorylation and activation increased in comparison to parental MDA-231 cells. RKIP over expression resulted in constitutive physical interaction with STAT3 and blocked c-Src and STAT3 association. The treatment of DU145 prostate, but not PC3 prostate or MDA-231 breast, cancer cell lines with ENMD-1198 or MKC-1 dramatically increased expression of RKIP. Overexpression of RKIP sensitized PC3 and MDA-231 cells to MTI-induced apoptosis. Moreover, MTI treatment resulted in a decrease in Src-mediated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation, an effect that was significantly enhanced by RKIP over expression. In stable RKIP over expressing MDA-231 cells, tumor xenograft growth induced by activated STAT3 is inhibited. RKIP synergizes with MTIs to induce apoptosis and inhibit STAT3 activation of breast and prostate cancer cells.

Here, we used PCR Array analysis to determine the gene and microRNA expression profiles in human prostate cancer cell lines transduced with AT2R recombinant adenovirus. Our results demonstrated that AT2R over expression leads to up-regulation of 6 apoptosis-related genes (TRAIL-R2, BAG3, BNIPI, HRK, Gadd45a, TP53BP2), 2 cytokine genes (IL6 and IL8) and 1 microRNA, and down-regulation of 1 apoptosis-related gene TNFSF10 and 2 cytokine genes (BMP6, BMP7) in transduced DU145 cells. HRK was identified as an up-regulated gene in AT2R-transduced PC-3 cells by real-time RT-PCR. Next, we utilized siRNAs to silence the up-regulated genes to further determine their roles on AT2R overexpression mediated apoptosis. The results showed downregulation of Gadd45a reduced the apoptotic effect by ∼30% in DU145 cells, downregulation of HRK reduced AT2R-mediated apoptosis by more than 50% in PC-3 cells, while downregulation of TRAIL-R2 enhanced AT2R-mediated apoptosis more than 4 times in DU145 cells. We also found that the effects on AT2R-mediated apoptosis caused by downregulation of Gadd45a, TRAIL-R2 and HRK were independent in activation of p38 MAPK, p44/42 MAPK and p53.

LPA stimulates H2O2 production which is required for growth. However, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the spatial and temporal regulation of H2O2-dependent signaling and the way in which signals are transmitted following receptor activation. Herein, we describe the use of two reagents, DCP-Bio1 and DCP-Rho1, to evaluate the localization of active protein oxidation after LPA stimulation by detection of nascent protein sulfenic acids. We found that LPA stimulation causes internalization of LPA receptors into early endosomes that contain NADPH oxidase components and are sites of H2O2 generation. DCP-Rho1 allowed visualization of sulfenic acid formation, indicative of active protein oxidation, which was stimulated by LPA and decreased by an LPA receptor antagonist. Protein oxidation sites colocalized with LPAR1 and the endosomal marker EEA1. Concurrent with the generation of these redox signaling-active endosomes (redoxosomes) is the H2O2- and NADPH oxidase-dependent oxidation of Akt2 and PTP1B detected using DCP-Bio1. These new approaches therefore enable detection of active, H2O2-dependent protein oxidation linked to cell signaling processes.

Inhibition of cancer cell proliferation was detected by 1-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT) assay and cell cycle analysis. Liquid colony formation and tumor spheroid formation assays were used to evaluate their effect on cancer cell clonogenicity. Real-time PCR was performed to test the mRNA level of cancer stem cell related genes. We found that Disulfiram or copper alone did not potently inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro. However, the presence of copper significantly enhanced inhibitory effect of Disulfiram on NSCLC cell growth, indicating a synergistic effect between Disulfiram and copper. Cell cycle analysis showed that Disulfiram/copper complex caused NSCLC cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. Furthermore, Disulfiram/copper significantly increased the sensitivity of cisplatin in NSCLC cells tested by MTT assay. Liquid colony formation assay revealed that copper dramatically increased the inhibitory effect of Disulfiram on NSCLC cell colony forming ability.

We also sought to determine the effect, if any, of factors affecting bRFS for patients who did not achieve pPSA<0.5 ng/mL.  Methods and materials:   A total of 105 patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant ADT (median = 3.9 mo) and external beam RT had pPSA data available and met the inclusion criteria. Pretreatment and treatment characteristics were included in a Cox proportional hazards model to determine effect on bRFS.  Results:   Median follow-up was 5.4 years. On multivariable analysis, pPSA≥0.5 ng/mL was associated with worsened bRFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.7, P = 0.013). For the subgroup of patients with at most 1 high-risk factor, pPSA remained a statistically significant prognostic factor. For patients within this subgroup who had pPSA≥0.5 ng/mL, the addition of pelvic RT was associated with a trend toward improved outcome (HR = 0.609, P = 0.083).  Conclusion:   For patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer receiving neoadjuvant ADT, achieving pPSA<0.5 ng/mL was associated with improved rates of bRFS. Additionally, pPSA measurement may identify patients who may be able to benefit from escalated treatment such as pelvic RT.""","""['Andrew M McDonald', 'Rojymon Jacob', 'Eddy S Yang', 'Michael C Dobelbower', 'Sean Vanlandingham', 'John B Fiveash']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Extreme-risk prostate adenocarcinoma presenting with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)>40 ng/ml: prognostic significance of the preradiation PSA nadir.', 'Biochemical response to androgen deprivation therapy before external beam radiation therapy predicts long-term prostate cancer survival outcomes.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Prognostic value of biochemical response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation before external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review of the literature.', 'Optimal duration of androgen deprivation therapy following radiation therapy in intermediate- or high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer: A systematic review and metaanalysis.', 'A prospective study of the effect of testosterone escape on preradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen kinetics in prostate cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

However, the contribution of inflammation to the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer remains largely unknown. Based on observations that aberrant expression of the proinflammatory protein tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is associated with development of drug resistance and metastatic phenotype in multiple cancer types, we determined TG2 expression in prostate cancer cells. Herein we report that human prostate cancer cell lines with low expression of androgen receptor (AR) had high basal levels of TG2 expression. Also, overexpression of TG2 negatively regulated AR mRNA and protein expression and attenuated androgen sensitivity of prostate cancer cells. TG2 expression in prostate cancer cells was associated with increased invasion and resistance to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, TG2 activated nuclear factor (NF)-κB and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. TG2/NF-κB-mediated decrease in AR expression resulted from transcriptional repression involving cis-interaction of NF-κB in a complex with TG2 with the 5'-untranslated region of AR. Negative regulation of AR could be partially abrogated by repression of TG2 or NF-κB (p65/RelA) by gene-specific small interfering RNA. These results suggested that a novel pathway links androgen dependence with TG2-regulated inflammatory signalling and hence may make TG2 a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Amy Lee Han', 'Santosh Kumar', 'Jansina Y Fok', 'Amit K Tyagi', 'Kapil Mehta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['RELA is sufficient to mediate interleukin-1 repression of androgen receptor expression and activity in an LNCaP disease progression model.', 'NF-κB Blockade with Oral Administration of Dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT), Delays Prostate Cancer Resistance to Androgen Receptor (AR) Inhibition and Inhibits AR Variants.', 'Interplay of nuclear factor-kappaB and B-myb in the negative regulation of androgen receptor expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha.', 'Tissue transglutaminase-mediated chemoresistance in cancer cells.', 'Transglutaminase 2 and NF-κB: an odd couple that shapes breast cancer phenotype.', 'Canonical and truncated transglutaminase-2 regulate mucin-1 expression and androgen independency in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Clinical Aspects and Targeted Therapies.', 'Hypoxia-mediated stabilization of HIF1A in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia promotes cell plasticity and malignant progression.', 'The Biological and Biomechanical Role of Transglutaminase-2 in the Tumour Microenvironment.', 'Search for Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers of Prostate Inflammation-Related Disorders: Role of Transglutaminase Isoforms as Potential Candidates.']"""

Genes differentially expressed between normal and tumorous tissues are usually considered to be cancer associated. We recently demonstrated that the analysis of interindividual variation in gene expression can be useful for identifying cancer associated genes. The goal of this study was to identify the best microarray data-derived predictor of known cancer associated genes.  Results:   We found that the traditional approach of identifying cancer genes--identifying differentially expressed genes--is not very efficient. The analysis of interindividual variation of gene expression in tumor samples identifies cancer-associated genes more effectively. The results were consistent across 4 major types of cancer: breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate. We used recently reported cancer-associated genes (2011-2012) for validation and found that novel cancer-associated genes can be best identified by elevated variance of the gene expression in tumor samples.  Conclusions:   The observation that the high interindividual variation of gene expression in tumor tissues is the best predictor of cancer-associated genes is likely a result of tumor heterogeneity on gene level. Computer simulation demonstrates that in the case of heterogeneity, an assessment of variance in tumors provides a better identification of cancer genes than does the comparison of the expression in normal and tumor tissues. Our results thus challenge the current paradigm that comparing the mean expression between normal and tumorous tissues is the best approach to identifying cancer-associated genes; we found that the high interindividual variation in expression is a better approach, and that using variation would improve our chances of identifying cancer-associated genes.""","""['Ivan P Gorlov', 'Ji-Yeon Yang', 'Jinyoung Byun', 'Christopher Logothetis', 'Olga Y Gorlova', 'Kim-Anh Do', 'Christopher Amos']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Beyond comparing means: the usefulness of analyzing interindividual variation in gene expression for identifying genes associated with cancer development.', 'Microarray-based analysis of whole-genome DNA methylation profiling in early detection of breast cancer.', 'Robust multi-tissue gene panel for cancer detection.', 'Application of expression genomics for predicting treatment response in cancer.', 'National Oncology Forum: perspectives for the year 2000.', 'Identification of differentially distributed gene expression and distinct sets of cancer-related genes identified by changes in mean and variability.', 'A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'A multi-omics approach for identifying important pathways and genes in human cancer.', 'Integration of copy number and transcriptomics provides risk stratification in prostate cancer: A discovery and validation cohort study.', 'An Independent Filter for Gene Set Testing Based on Spectral Enrichment.']"""

Subjects and methods:   PROtEuS (Prostate Cancer and Environment Study), a population-based case-control study set amongst the mainly French-speaking population in Montréal, Canada, was used to address study objectives. The study included 1590 pathologically confirmed prostate cancer cases diagnosed in a Montréal French hospital between 2005 and 2009, and 1618 population controls ascertained from the French electoral list, frequency-matched to cases by age. In-person interviews elicited information on sociodemographic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between circumcision, age at circumcision and prostate cancer risk, adjusting for age, ancestry, family history of prostate cancer, prostate cancer screening history, education, and history of sexually transmitted infections.  Results:   Circumcised men had a slightly lower risk, albeit not statistically significant, of developing prostate cancer than uncircumcised men (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76-1.04). Circumcision was found to be protective in men circumcised aged ≥36 years (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30-0.98). A weaker protective effect was seen among men circumcised within 1 year of birth (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72-1.04). The strongest protective effect of circumcision was recorded in Black men (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.86, P-value for interaction 0.02) but no association was found with other ancestral groups.  Conclusion:   Our findings provide novel evidence for a protective effect of circumcision against prostate cancer development, especially in those circumcised aged ≥36 years; although circumcision before the age of 1 year may also confer protection. Circumcision appeared to be protective only among Black men, a group that has the highest rate of disease.

Apo2 ligand (Apo2L)/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) treatment (TR) is known to induce autophagy. Here we investigated whether SQSTM1/p62 (p62) overexpression, as a marker of autophagic flux, was related to aggressiveness of human prostate cancer (PCa) and whether autophagy regulated the treatment response in sensitive but not resistant PCa cell lines.  Methods:   Immunostaining and immunoblotting analyses of the autophagic markers p62 [in PCa tissue microarrays (TMAs) and PCa cell lines] and LC3 (in PCa cell lines), transmission electron microscopy, and GFP-mCherry-LC3 were used to study autophagy induction and flux. The effect of autophagy inhibition using pharmacologic (3-methyladenine and chloroquine) and genetic [(short hairpin (sh)-mediated knock-down of ATG7 and LAMP2) and small interfering (si)RNA-mediated BECN1 knock-down] approaches on TR-induced cell death was assessed by clonogenic survival, sub-G1 DNA content, and annexinV/PI staining by flow cytometry. Caspase-8 activation was determined by immunoblotting.  Results:   We found that increased cytoplasmic expression of p62 was associated with high-grade PCa, indicating that autophagy signaling might be important for survival in high-grade tumors. TR-resistant cells exhibited high autophagic flux, with more efficient clearance of p62-aggregates in four TR-resistant PCa cell lines: C4-2, LNCaP, DU145, and CWRv22.1. In contrast, autophagic flux was low in TR-sensitive PC3 cells, leading to accumulation of p62-aggregates. Pharmacologic (chloroquine or 3-methyladenine) and genetic (shATG7 or shLAMP2) inhibition of autophagy led to cell death in TR-resistant C4-2 cells. shATG7-expressing PC3 cells, were less sensitive to TR-induced cell death whereas those shLAMP2-expressing were as sensitive as shControl-expressing PC3 cells. Inhibition of autophagic flux using chloroquine prevented clearance of p62 aggregates, leading to caspase-8 activation and cell death in C4-2 cells. In PC3 cells, inhibition of autophagy induction prevented p62 accumulation and hence caspase-8 activation.  Conclusions:   We show that p62 overexpression correlates with advanced stage human PCa. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of autophagy in PCa cell lines indicate that autophagic flux can determine the cellular response to TR by regulating caspase-8 activation. Thus, combining various autophagic inhibitors may have a differential impact on TR-induced cell death.""","""['Kamini Singh', 'Arishya Sharma', 'Maria C Mir', 'Judith A Drazba', 'Warren D Heston', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Donna Hansel', 'Brian P Rubin', 'Eric A Klein', 'Alexandru Almasan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['p62/SQSTM1 is required for cell survival of apoptosis-resistant bone metastatic prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Downmodulation of dimethyl transferase activity enhances tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'The bifunctional autophagic flux by 2-deoxyglucose to control survival or growth of prostate cancer cells.', 'p62 works as a hub modulation in the ageing process.', 'The role of cell signaling in the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis in the regulation of tumor cell survival in response to sorafenib and neratinib.', 'Antioxidative Role of Heterophagy, Autophagy, and Mitophagy in the Retina and Their Association with the Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Etiopathogenesis.', 'SDF-1α Promotes Chondrocyte Autophagy through CXCR4/mTOR Signaling Axis.', 'Drug Repurposing: A New Hope in Drug Discovery for Prostate Cancer.', 'TRAIL Triggers CRAC-Dependent Calcium Influx and Apoptosis through the Recruitment of Autophagy Proteins to Death-Inducing Signaling Complex.', 'Cell Survival and Cell Death at the Intersection of Autophagy and Apoptosis: Implications for Current and Future Cancer Therapeutics.']"""

Patients with and without non-OC disease were compared for differences in preoperative clinical and pathologic characteristics, including three biopsy-based measures of tumor volume (number of cores with cancer, percentage of cores with cancer, and maximum percent core involvement with cancer). After evaluating the different preoperative variables in univariate analyses, a multivariable logistic regression model was generated, and bootstrap estimates of the risk of non-OC disease were calculated.  Results:   In total, 556 patients with PNI were analyzed, 279 (50.2%) of whom were found to have non-OC prostate cancer. In univariate analyses, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, clinical T stage, biopsy Gleason sum, and the three biopsy-based measures of tumor volume were significantly associated with non-OC disease. Of the three measures of tumor volume, the best fit to the data and highest degree of model discrimination were obtained using maximum percent core involvement with cancer.

Methods:   Retrospective data were accessed from 122 men with serum samples drawn at a median of 0.5 months after starting ADT for metastatic prostate cancer. MCP-1, IL-1-β, IL-2, IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-α levels were measured by multiplex electrochemiluminescence assays. A multivariable Cox model assessed the association of time to CRPC and overall survival by the protein levels and adjusted for clinical variables (age and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels at start of ADT, race, ECOG status, and extent of metastases). Associations were reported as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).  Results:   Median follow-up and overall survival were 44 and 42.2 months, respectively. ECOG performance status (≥1 vs. 0) was negatively associated with overall survival [HR = 2.8 (1.1-7.0), P = 0.03], and PSA nadir < 0.2 was predictive of longer time to development of CRPC [HR = 0.3 (0.2-0.5), P < 0.0001].

Hyaluronan (HA) is a high molecular weight polyanionic carbohydrate produced by synthases (HAS1 through HAS3) and fragmented by oxidative/nitrosative stress and hyaluronidases (HYAL1 through HYAL4, SPAM1) common in PCa microenvironments. HA and HA fragments interact with receptors CD44 and hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR), resulting in increased tumor aggressiveness in experimental PCa models. This study evaluated the association of HA-related molecules with BF after prostatectomy in GS7 tumors.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays were constructed from a 96-patient cohort. HA histochemistry and HAS2, HYAL1, CD44, CD44v6, and HMMR immunohistochemistry were quantified using digital pathology techniques.  Results:   HA in tumor-associated stroma and HMMR in malignant epithelium were significantly and marginally significantly associated with time to BF in univariate analysis, respectively. After adjusting for clinicopathologic features, both HA in tumor-associated stroma and HMMR in malignant epithelium were significantly associated with time to BF. Although not significantly associated with BF, HAS2 and HYAL1 positively correlated with HMMR in malignant epithelium. Cell culture assays demonstrated that HMMR bound native and fragmented HA, promoted HA uptake, and was required for a promigratory response to fragmented HA.

Methods:   Between June 1, 1997, and October 31, 2011, 2,346 patients with biopsy-detected PCA underwent RP. According to D'Amico, 1,767 patients presented low-/intermediate-risk PCA, and 579 presented high-risk PCA. We compared the incidence of OFTC between low-/intermediate-risk and high-risk patients, and between high-risk patients with different risk factor constellations. Furthermore, overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and biochemical progression-free survival (BFS) were calculated for low-/intermediate-risk and high-risk patients with and without OFTC.  Results:   High-risk patients were less likely to harbor OFTC (17.3 vs. 58.2 %; p < 0.001). That means, however, that nearly one in five patients with clinically high-risk PCA indeed had OFTC. Particularly, the subgroup with PSA >20 ng/ml or cT2c-3 tumor as sole high-risk factor showed a considerable proportion of OFTC in 30.2 and 26.1 % of cases, respectively. While the entire high-risk group had shorter OS, CSS and BFS than the low-/intermediate-risk group, high-risk patients with OFTC had comparably good OS, CSS and BFS as low-/intermediate-risk patients with OFTC.  Conclusions:   Nearly, one in five patients assumed to have high-risk PCA indeed had OFTC. Particularly, patients with PSA >20 ng/ml or cT2c-3 tumor as sole high-risk factor were often misclassified.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 9,635 RPs performed at our center between 2002 and 2011. Of these, 47 % were conducted with NeuroSAFE. Proportions of NS and SM status were assessed. Subsequently, a score for oncological safe NS (safe-R) was developed; Safe-R was categorized as 3 (for negative SM and bilateral NS), 2 (for negative SM and unilateral NS), 1 (for negative SM without NS), and 0 (for patients with positive SM), respectively. The impact of NeuroSAFE on safe-R was analyzed by chi-square test and confirmed by multinomial logistic regression, adjusting for preoperative risk factors.  Results:   Applying NeuroSAFE resulted in enhanced safe-R score, indicating lower rates of positive SM and higher rates of NS, across all risk categories (all p < 0.001). For example in high-risk patients, NeuroSAFE resulted in lower proportions of safe-R 0 (27.6 vs. 33.6 %) and higher proportions of safe-R 3 (32.4 vs. 17.1 %, p < 0.001). Linkage between the NeuroSAFE approach and safe-R was confirmed after multinomial logistic adjustment for preoperative risk factors.

Materials and methods:   Between 2004 and 2011, 78 T1-4N0M0 prostate cancer patients at high risk of lymph node involvement (70 patients with a Roach index ≥ 15%; 57 with T-stage ≥ 3a; 40 with Gleason score ≥ 8) underwent WPRT to a median normofractionated dose of 50.4 Gy (range 48.0-50.4 Gy) with conformal three-dimensional techniques for most patients. A 24 Gy boost (4 Gy/six fractions, twice weekly) was delivered to the prostate with IMRT. The total median delivered dose was 74.4 Gy, equivalent to 85.2 Gy in 2 Gy/fractions (α/β = 1.5 Gy). All patients underwent androgen deprivation for a total median time of 10.8 months. The maximum gastrointestinal and genitourinary acute and late toxicity scores were recorded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system.  Results:   All patients completed treatment as planned. Only 1% of patients presented with grade 3 genitourinary or gastrointestinal acute toxicity and none scored ≥ grade 4. With a median follow-up of 57 months, the 5 year probability of late grade ≥2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity-free survival was 79.1 ± 4.8% and 84.1 ± 4.5%, respectively. The 5 year biochemical disease-free survival, local relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival were 84.5 ± 4.5%, 96.0 ± 2.8% and 86.4 ± 4.4%, respectively. A pre-radiotherapy prostate-specific antigen ≤0.3 ng/ml was associated with a better 5 year biochemical disease-free survival (P = 0.036) and distant metastasis-free survival (P = 0.049).  Conclusions:   The use of a hypofractionated IMRT boost after WPRT may allow a minimally invasive dose escalation to successfully treat patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer at high risk of lymph node involvement.

Men were nearly twice as likely to have a colonoscopy (OR=1.94, 95% CI=1.89-1.99) as women. A personal screening history, presence of comorbidities, and family history of cancer predicted higher screening utilization across modalities, but to different degrees across ethnic groups.

TRUSGB leads to sampling errors causing delayed diagnosis, overdetection of indolent PCa, and misclassification. Advances in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) suggest that imaging and selective magnetic resonance (MR)-guided biopsy (MRGB) may be superior to TRUSGB.  Objective:   To compare the diagnostic efficacy of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pathway with TRUSGB.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 223 consecutive biopsy-naive men referred to a urologist with elevated prostate-specific antigen participated in a single-institution, prospective, investigator-blinded, diagnostic study from July 2012 through January 2013.  Intervention:   All participants had mpMRI and TRUSGB. Men with equivocal or suspicious lesions on mpMRI also underwent MRGB.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was PCa detection. Secondary outcomes were histopathologic details of biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens, adverse events, and MRI reader performance. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive values (NPVs), and positive predictive values were estimated and basic statistics presented by number (percentage) or median (interquartile range).  Results and limitations:   Of 223 men, 142 (63.7%) had PCa. TRUSGB detected 126 cases of PCa in 223 men (56.5%) including 47 (37.3%) classed as low risk. MRGB detected 99 cases of PCa in 142 men (69.7%) with equivocal or suspicious mpMRI, of which 6 (6.1%) were low risk. The MRGB pathway reduced the need for biopsy by 51%, decreased the diagnosis of low-risk PCa by 89.4%, and increased the detection of intermediate/high-risk PCa by 17.7%. The estimated NPVs of TRUSGB and MRGB for intermediate/high-risk disease were 71.9% and 96.9%, respectively. The main limitation is the lack of long follow-up.

The multi-step androgen synthesis pathway originates from cholesterol, which can be obtained by cells from several major sources including intracellular synthesis through an enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). The inhibition of this enzyme by the use of statins has been investigated in prostate cancer as a possible therapeutic target for blocking the de novo androgen synthesis resulting in decreased tumor growth. However, the effectiveness of statins in CRPC has not been investigated.  Methods:   Castration-resistant C4-2 and androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells were treated with Simvastatin for 48 hours. Dose-dependent responses to Simvastatin were analyzed using cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. Cellular growth curve was generated using haemocytometer. HMGCR activity was assessed using 14C-acetic acid detected by thin layer chromatography, and the protein expression was quantified using western blot analysis. Intracellular cholesterol and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).  Results:   Significant decrease in cell viability and growth curve observed at 75 μM of Simvastatin compared to no treatment group in the castration-resistant C4-2 cells. HMGCR activity was significantly decreased up to 50% and 70% at 50 μM and 75 μM of Simvastatin respectively compared to the vehicle control in C4-2 cells. Simvastatin did not affect the protein expression. 80% decrease in the amount of total intracellular cholesterol levels was observed in 75 μM Simvastatin treatment group compared to vehicle control. PSA secretion levels were significantly reduced in the C4-2 cell line at 50 μM and 75 μM of Simvastatin compared to vehicle control.  Conclusion:   The inhibition of HMGCR via Simvastatin lowered the viability of castration-resistant C4-2 cells. Simvastatin's ability to limit the endogenous supply of cholesterol contributes to the effects seen in cell viability.""","""['Jenny Hanbi Kim', 'Michael E Cox', 'Kishor M Wasan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Lipids Health Dis""","""['Combination therapy with novel androgen receptor antagonists and statin for castration-resistant\xa0prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Oral simvastatin administration delays castration-resistant progression and reduces intratumoral steroidogenesis of LNCaP prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Resveratrol inhibits the mevalonate pathway and potentiates the antiproliferative effects of simvastatin in rat theca-interstitial cells.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Furthermore, the phosphorylated level of p38 in PC-3 cells was activated through the FN treatment, whereas the endogenous Akt phosphorylation was blocked.

Objective:   To investigate the relationships between male androgenetic alopecia, androgen receptor (AR) gene polymorphism (SNP rs6152) and clinical characteristics of BPH and prostate cancer.  Methods:   Overall, 309 male subjects with prostate disease (BPH or CaP) were examined. We evaluated the standard grades of AGA (I-VII) by Hamilton-Norwood classification and 195 patients were also assessed by phototrichogram. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and testosterone levels were also measured. Polymorphism rs6152 of the AR was evaluated from blood samples by PCR-RFLP. Data were statistically evaluated.  Results:   The expected positive correlation between age and AGA grade and the expected negative correlation between hair density and age and between anagen/telogen and AGA were found. A statistically significant difference between patients with A and G alleles in terms of AGA grade was found. The predominant G allele was more frequent in patients with higher grade of alopecia and in patients with significantly higher PSA. There was no correlation between diagnosis (BPH or CaP) and polymorphism. Patients with prostate inflammation had a statistically significant higher grade of AGA, together with higher PSA.  Conclusions:   We confirmed that the AR gene polymorphism (SNP rs6152 G>A) is associated with the development of AGA and higher PSA levels in patients with BPH but not cancer.

However, it is an uncommon procedure, because of problems related to the organization and cooperation among urologists, radiotherapists and physics, to the competition of alternative therapies, to dogmatic and educational beliefs, and to the poor knowledge of this technique.   Methods:   Between May1999 and July 2013, 400 patients with low and medium risk CaP underwent I 125 BT using a ""real-time"" approach. The seeds implantation was performed using a Mick applicator in the first 190 patients and the ""QuickLink"" technique in the last 210 cases. Oncologic results were reported for the first 250 cases with a mean follow-up of 10 years, while functional outcomes and complications were assessed in 350 patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year.   Results:   A good quality implantation was assessed in 90% of the patients (D90>145 Gy). A biochemical failure was assessed, based on Phoenix criteria, in 12 patients (4.8%). Out of these patients, 10 underwent prostate biopsy (the other 2 patients showed a systemic disease). The biopsy showed a CaP in 6/10 patients who underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy (4 patients) and external radiotherapy (2 patients) respectively. The remaining 4/10 patients with negative biopsy were treated with total androgen blockade (3 patients) and watchful waiting (1 patient) respectively. Functional results showed an incidence of postoperative irritative disorders in 70% of the patients during the first six months and a good recovery of erectile function in 78.8% and 68.2% of the patients after one and five years from BT respectively.

Materials and methods:   A total of 70 patients who underwent sPLND during RP were scanned retrospectively. The scanned parameters were levels of serum PSA, the total weight of the removed prostate, the amount as a percentage of the tumor in the prostate tissue, the stage of the tumor, the total Gleason score (GS) and the number of standard pelvic lymph nodes that were removed from both right and left sides.  Results:   The average age of the patients was 59 years. A positive correlation was found between the total GS and the number of lymph nodes; while this correlation was significant (p = 0.0038), there was no significant difference between lymph nodes counts and other scanned parameters. The average pelvic lymph node numbers of patients with GS of 6-7 and 8 were 10.4-11.5 and 13.2, respectively. Lymph nodes metastases were found in 3 (4.2 %) patients whose average pelvic lymph node number was 17.3.

Enhanced secretions of cytokines and growth factors by cancer associated fibroblasts in prostate tumors create a favorable microenvironment for cancer cells to grow and metastasize. Our previous work showed that the progesterone receptor (PR) was expressed specifically in prostate stromal fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. However, the expression levels of PR and its impact to tumor microenvironment in prostate tumors are poorly understood.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry assays are applied to human prostate tissue biopsies. Cell migration, invasion and proliferation assays are performed using human prostate cells. Real-time PCR and ELISA are applied to measure gene expression at molecular levels.  Results:   Immunohistochemistry assays showed that PR protein levels were decreased in cancer associated stroma when compared with paired normal prostate stroma. Using in vitro prostate stromal cell models, we showed that conditioned media collected from PR positive stromal cells inhibited prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, but had minor suppressive impacts on cancer cell proliferation. PR suppressed the secretion of stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and interlukin-6 (IL-6) by stromal cells independent to PR ligands. Blocking PR expression by siRNA or supplementation of exogenous SDF-1 or IL-6 to conditioned media from PR positive stromal cells counteracted the inhibitory effects of PR to cancer cell migration and invasion.  Conclusions:   Decreased expression of the PR in cancer associated stroma may contribute to the elevated SDF-1 and IL-6 levels in prostate tumors and enhance prostate tumor progression.""","""['Yue Yu', 'Jennifer Suehyun Lee', 'Ning Xie', 'Estelle Li', 'Antonio Hurtado-Coll', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Michael Cox', 'Stephen Plymate', 'Martin Gleave', 'Xuesen Dong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Expression and function of the progesterone receptor in human prostate stroma provide novel insights to cell proliferation control.', 'Progesterone receptor expression during prostate cancer progression suggests a role of this receptor in stromal cell differentiation.', 'Tumor-derived CXCL8 signaling augments stroma-derived CCL2-promoted proliferation and CXCL12-mediated invasion of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells.', 'Progesterone receptor in the prostate: A potential suppressor for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Cellular Constituents of the Prostate Stroma: Key Contributors to Prostate Cancer Progression and Therapy Resistance.', 'The potential of tumour microenvironment markers to stratify the risk of recurrence in prostate cancer patients.', 'Genome-wide association study identifies a role for the progesterone receptor in benign prostatic hyperplasia risk.', 'Impact of nuclear YAP1 expression in residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy with docetaxel for high-risk localized prostate cancer.', 'In Vitro Vascular Network Modified to Function as Culture Platform and Angiogenic Induction Potential Test for Cancer Cells.', 'Structure and Function of the Nuclear Receptor Superfamily and Current Targeted Therapies of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Celastrol (3-hydroxy-24-nor-2oxo-1(10),3,5,7-friedelatetrane-29-oic acid), also named as tripterine, is extracted from root of Chinese traditional herb Tripterygiumwilfordii Hook f with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. In this study, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms of celastrol on cell proliferation and IL-6 gene expression in prostate carcinoma cells. 3H-thymidine incorporation and flow cytometric analysis indicated that celastrol treatments arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, thus attenuating cell proliferation in prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells; moreover, celastrol induced cell apoptosis at higher dosage. Knockdown of IL-6 attenuated the anti-proliferative effect of celastrol on PC-3 cells. Results from ELISA and 5'-deletion transient gene expression assays indicated that celastrol treatment decreased IL-6 secretion and gene expression, and this effect is dependent on the NF-κB response element within IL-6 promoter area since mutation of the NF-κB response element from AAATGTCCCATTTTCCC to AAATGTTACATTTTCCC by site-directed mutagenesis abolished the inhibition of celastrol on the IL-6 promoter activity. Celastrol also attenuated the activation of PMA and TNFα on the gene expression and secretion of IL-6 in PC-3 cells. Immunoblot assays revealed that celastrol treatment downregulated the expressions of IKKα, p50 and p65, supporting the 5'-deletion transient gene expression assay result that celastrol blocked IL-6 expression through the NF-κB pathway in PC-3 cells.

Thus, we evaluated the association of circulating C-peptide, which is a marker of insulin secretion, and leptin, which is secreted in response to insulin and influences insulin sensitivity, with prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   We identified prostate cancer cases (n = 1,314) diagnosed a mean of 5.4 years after blood draw and matched controls (n = 1,314) in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Plasma C-peptide and leptin concentrations were measured by ELISA.

Methods:   DSC3 gene expression level in available PCa microarray dataset was examined using the Oncomine database. DSC3 transcript expression in prostate cell line panel and an independent tissue cohort (n = 52) was estimated by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Epigenetic status of DSC3 gene promoter in PCa was investigated by uploading three dataset (ENCODE Infinium 450K array data and two methylation sequencing) in UCSC genome browser. While pyrosequencing analysis measured promoter DNA methylation, Q-PCR estimates were obtained for DSC3 transcript re-expression after 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) treatment. Clinical relevance of DSC3 expression was studied by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Finally, functional studies monitoring cell proliferation, migration and invasion were performed in prostate cell lines after siRNA mediated DSC3 knockdown or following 5-Aza induced re-expression. EMT markers Vimentin and E-cadherin expression was measured by Western Blot.  Results:   Microarray data analyses revealed a significant decrease in DSC3 transcript expression in PCa, compared to benign samples. Q-PCR analysis of an independent cohort revealed DSC3 transcript down-regulation, both in PCa cell lines and tumor tissues but not in their benign counterpart. Examination of available NGS and Infinium data identified a role for epigenetic regulation DSC3 mRNA reduction in PCa. Pyrosequencing confirmed the increased DSC3 promoter methylation in cancer cell lines and restoration of transcript expression upon 5-Aza treatment further corroborated this epigenetic silencing mechanism. Importantly Kaplan-Meier analysis of an outcome cohort showed an association between loss of DSC3 expression and significantly increased risk of biochemical recurrence. Functional studies indicate a role for epithelial-mesenchymal transition in DSC3 regulated cell migration/invasion.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our data suggests that DNA methylation contributes to down-regulation of DSC3 in prostate cancer, and loss of DSC3 predicts poor clinical outcome.""","""['Jincheng Pan', 'Yu Chen', 'Chengqiang Mo', 'Daohu Wang', 'Junxing Chen', 'Xiaopeng Mao', 'Shengjie Guo', 'Jintao Zhuang', 'Shaopeng Qiu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Epigenetic silencing of DSC3 is a common event in human breast cancer.', 'DSC3 expression is regulated by p53, and methylation of DSC3 DNA is a prognostic marker in human colorectal cancer.', 'Adiponectin as a potential tumor suppressor inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition but frequently silenced in prostate cancer by promoter methylation.', 'The p53 target gene desmocollin 3 acts as a novel tumor suppressor through inhibiting EGFR/ERK pathway in human lung cancer.', 'Prognostic DNA methylation markers for prostate cancer.', 'Bioinformatic miRNA-mRNAs Analysis Revels to miR-934 as a Potential Regulator of the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'The genomic landscape of pediatric renal cell carcinomas.', 'Desmosomes as Signaling Hubs in the Regulation of Cell Behavior.', 'DNA methylation signatures associated with prognosis of gastric cancer.', 'Differential gene expression profile between progressive and de novo muscle invasive bladder cancer and its prognostic implication.']"""

Methods:   The analysis included patients diagnosed with rectal cancer from 1992 to 2010 and who were registered in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Standardized incidence ratios assessed the location of second primary cancers by the receipt and sequence of radiation therapy. A Cox proportional hazards model examined the predictors for patients who developed second primary cancers.  Results:   The hazard ratio for developing any type of second primary was 12 % higher in patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy, Hazard Ratio and 95 % confidence interval, HR 95 % CI 1.12 (1.0, 1.2), and 33 % lower for patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy, HR 95 % CI 0.75 (0.7, 0.8), relative to patients who did not receive radiation therapy. The location of the second cancer varied by both the receipt and sequence of radiation therapy. Secondary rectal cancers were reduced 170 % after postoperative radiation and 103 % after preoperative radiation, compared to the non-receipt of radiation therapy. The impact of radiation therapy on secondary colon cancers was not as marked. Rectal cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy are at a higher risk of thyroid cancers and leukemia, but males have a lower risk of prostate cancer.

Androgen deprivation or treatment with androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitor (ARSI), Enzalutamide (MDV-3100, ENZA) or bicalutamide induced autophagy in androgen-dependent and in castration-resistant CaP (castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)) cell lines. The autophagic cascade triggered by AR blockage, correlated with the increased light chain 3-II/I ratio and ATG-5 expression. Autophagy was observed in a subpopulation of C4-2B cells that developed insensitivity to ENZA after sustained exposure in culture. Using flow cytometry and clonogenic assays, we showed that inhibiting autophagy with clomipramine (CMI), chloroquine or metformin increased apoptosis and significantly impaired cell viability. This autophagic process was mediated by AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation and the suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through Raptor phosphorylation (Serine 792). Furthermore, small interfering RNA targeting AMPK significantly inhibited autophagy and promoted cell death in CaP cells acutely or chronically exposed to ENZA or androgen deprivation, suggesting that autophagy is an important survival mechanism in CRPC. Lastly, in vivo studies with mice orthotopically implanted with ENZA-resistant cells demonstrated that the combination of ENZA and autophagy modulators, CMI or metformin significantly reduced tumor growth when compared with control groups (P<0.005). In conclusion, autophagy is as an important mechanism of resistance to ARSI in CRPC. Antiandrogen-induced autophagy is mediated through the activation of AMPK pathway and the suppression of mTOR pathway. Blocking autophagy pharmacologically or genetically significantly impairs prostate cancer cell survival in vitro and in vivo, implying the therapeutics potential of autophagy inhibitors in the antiandrogen-resistance setting.""","""['H G Nguyen', 'J C Yang', 'H-J Kung', 'X-B Shi', 'D Tilki', 'P N Lara Jr', 'R W DeVere White', 'A C Gao', 'C P Evans']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Combined N-terminal androgen receptor and autophagy inhibition increases the antitumor effect in enzalutamide sensitive and enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Co-targeting hexokinase 2-mediated Warburg effect and ULK1-dependent autophagy suppresses tumor growth of PTEN- and TP53-deficiency-driven castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with enzalutamide.', 'Research progress on pharmacological effects and mechanisms of cepharanthine and its derivatives.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Identification of bicalutamide resistance-related genes and prognosis prediction in patients with prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs as the critical regulators of autophagy-mediated cisplatin response in tumor cells.', 'Microbiota-Derived Natural Products Targeting Cancer Stem Cells: Inside the Gut Pharma Factory.']"""

Knockdown of endogenous Dlg5 markedly increased prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Our studies, for the first time, demonstrate the interaction between Dlg5 and Girdin, an actin-binding Akt substrate.

Small interfering RNA directed against Girdin and wortmannin treatment, which was found to reduce Girdin phosphorylation, impaired the effect of Dlg5 depletion on cell migration.

However, mechanism(s) leading to androgen-independent AR nuclear localization are poorly understood. Since the N-terminal domain (NTD) of AR plays a role in transactivation under androgen-depleted conditions, we investigated the role of the NTD in AR nuclear localization in CRPC. Deletion mutagenesis was used to identify amino acid sequences in the NTD essential for its androgen-independent nuclear localization in C4-2, a widely used CRPC cell line. Deletion mutants of AR tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the 5'-end were generated and their signal distribution was investigated in C4-2 cells by fluorescent microscopy. Our results showed that the region of a.a. 294-556 was required for androgen-independent AR nuclear localization whereas a.a. 1-293 mediates Hsp90 regulation of AR nuclear localization in CRPC cells. Although the region of a.a. 294-556 does not contain a nuclear import signal, it was able to enhance DHT-induced import of the ligand binding domain (LBD).

Using the Pten null murine prostate cancer model, we show an expansion of Gr-1(+) CD11b(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) occurring intraprostatically immediately following epithelium-specific Pten deletion without expansion in hematopoietic tissues. This MDSC expansion is accompanied by sustained immune suppression. Prostatic Gr-1(+) CD11b(+) cells, but not those isolated from the spleen of the same tumor-bearing mice, suppress T cell proliferation and express high levels of Arginase 1 and iNOS. Mechanistically, the loss of PTEN in the epithelium leads to a significant upregulation of genes within the inflammatory response and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways, including Csf1 and Il1b, two genes known to induce MDSC expansion and immunosuppressive activities. Treatment of Pten null mice with the selective CSF-1 receptor inhibitor GW2580 decreases MDSC infiltration and relieves the associated immunosuppressive phenotype. Our study indicates that epithelium-associated tumor-initiating events trigger the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and promote localized MDSC expansion and immune suppression, thereby promoting tumor progression.""","""['Alejandro J Garcia', 'Marcus Ruscetti', 'Teresita L Arenzana', 'Linh M Tran', 'Daniella Bianci-Frias', 'Elysia Sybert', 'Saul J Priceman', 'Lily Wu', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Stephen T Smale', 'Hong Wu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['In vivo suppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells is limited to the inflammatory site.', 'Critical Role of Mast Cells and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ in the Induction of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells by Marijuana Cannabidiol In Vivo.', 'Hierarchy of immunosuppressive strength among myeloid-derived suppressor cell subsets is determined by GM-CSF.', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in Trypanosoma cruzi Infection.', 'Myeloid suppressor cells in cancer: recruitment, phenotype, properties, and mechanisms of immune suppression.', 'Cancer immune exclusion: breaking the barricade for a successful immunotherapy.', 'BHLHE22 drives the immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment and associated bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Reversal of Lactate and PD-1-mediated Macrophage Immunosuppression Controls Growth of PTEN/p53-deficient Prostate Cancer.', 'Mechanisms driving the immunoregulatory function of cancer cells.', 'Antagonistic Functions of Androgen Receptor and NF-κB in Prostate Cancer-Experimental and Computational Analyses.']"""

Materials and methods:   A cohort of 166 patients cumulatively treated between September, 2009 and November, 2012 qualified for study, each undergoing total-gland cryoablation (TGC) for prostate cancer. The initial 100 patients accrued submitted to TGC alone. PRW was administered to the final 66 patients. Preemptive warming is achieved by inserting a cryoprobe midline through perineal skin into anterior rectal wall under ultrasound guidance. The activated probe generates warmth as the ice ball encroaches on rectum. Prospective, post-ablative grading of rectal pain was measured at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 by using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Recurrent prostate cancer was gauged by Phoenix criterion (nadir+2 ng/ml). The Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test were used to compare clinical characteristics of therapeutic subsets. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied for comparison of cancer recurrence risk by group.  Results:   Rectal pain (all grades) was experienced by patients treated with (62%) and without (74%) PRW. Although such pain typically resolved with time, it was milder (general lineal model, p=0.023) and less prolonged (median: 0.75 vs 1.5 months; log-rank test, p=0.002) in patients receiving PRW than in controls. Of note, PRW did not heighten cancer recurrence risk (hazard ratio=1.3 [95% CI, 0.3-5.0]).

Methods and materials:   Clinical VMAT plans were delivered with the TrueBeam linac for 8 patients with prostate cancer. The real-time target motion during dose delivery was determined based on the 2-dimensional fiducial localization using an onboard electronic portal imaging device. The target shift in each image was correlated with the control point with the same gantry angle in the VMAT plan. An in-house-developed Monte Carlo simulation tool was used to calculate the 3-dimensional dose distribution for each control point individually, taking into account the corresponding real-time target motion (assuming a nondeformable target with no rotation). The delivered target dose was then estimated by accumulating the dose from all control points in the plan. On the basis of this information, dose-volume histograms and 3-dimensional dose distributions were calculated to assess their degradation from the planned dose caused by target motion. Thirty-two prostate motion trajectories were analyzed.  Results:   The minimum dose to 0.03 cm(3) of the gross tumor volume (D0.03cc) was only slightly degraded after taking motion into account, with a minimum value of 94.1% of the planned dose among all patients and fractions. However, the gross tumor volume receiving prescription dose (V100%) could be largely affected by motion, dropping below 60% in 1 trajectory. We did not observe a correlation between motion magnitude and dose degradation.  Conclusions:   Prostate motion degrades the delivered dose to the target in an unpredictable way, although its effect is reduced over multiple fractions, and for most patients the degradation is small. Patients with greater prostate motion or those treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy would benefit from real-time prostate tracking to reduce the margin.""","""['Juan Diego Azcona', 'Lei Xing', 'Xin Chen', 'Karl Bush', 'Ruijiang Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Electromagnetic guided couch and multileaf collimator tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator.', 'Potential benefits of dosimetric VMAT tracking verified with 3D film measurements.', 'Optimizing fiducial visibility on periodically acquired megavoltage and kilovoltage image pairs during prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Automatic prostate tracking and motion assessment in volumetric modulated arc therapy with an electronic portal imaging device.', 'Time-resolved dose distributions to moving targets during volumetric modulated arc therapy with and without dynamic MLC tracking.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'Reducing PTV margins for prostate SBRT with motion compensation and gating techniques.', 'Sequential monoscopic image-guided motion compensation in tomotherapy stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of transperineal ultrasound on perineal skin dose in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Delivered dose quantification in prostate radiotherapy using online 3D cine imaging and treatment log files on a combined 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging and linear accelerator system.']"""

Fixed time intervals between imaging/correction (15, 60, 180, and 360 seconds) were simulated, as well as adaptive timing (ie, the time interval reduced from 60 to 15 seconds in case prostate motion exceeded 3 mm or 2° in consecutive images). The simulated extent of robot corrections was also varied: no corrections, translational corrections only, and translational corrections combined with rotational corrections up to 5°, 10°, and perfect rotational correction. The correction strategies were evaluated for treatment plans with a 0-mm or 3-mm margin around the clinical target volume (CTV). We recorded CTV coverage (V100%) and dose-volume parameters of the peripheral zone (boost), rectum, bladder, and urethra.  Results:   Planned dose parameters were increasingly preserved with larger extents of robot corrections. A time interval between corrections of 60 to 180 seconds provided optimal preservation of CTV coverage. To achieve 98% CTV coverage in 98% of the treatments, translational and rotational corrections up to 10° were required for the 0-mm margin plans, whereas translational and rotational corrections up to 5° were required for the 3-mm margin plans. Rectum and bladder were spared considerably better in the 0-mm margin plans. Adaptive timing did not improve delivered dose.  Conclusions:   Intrafraction prostate motion substantially affected the delivered dose but was compensated for effectively by robot corrections using a time interval of 60 to 180 seconds.

Methods and materials:   Men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in a trial that randomized men to either conventionally fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (CIMRT, 75.6 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions) or to dose-escalated hypofractionated IMRT (HIMRT, 72 Gy in 2.4-Gy fractions). Late (≥90 days after completion of radiation therapy) genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were prospectively evaluated and scored according to modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria.  Results:   101 men received CIMRT and 102 men received HIMRT. The median age was 68, and the median follow-up time was 6.0 years. Twenty-eight percent had low-risk, 71% had intermediate-risk, and 1% had high-risk disease. There was no difference in late GU toxicity in men treated with CIMRT and HIMRT. The actuarial 5-year grade ≥2 GU toxicity was 16.5% after CIMRT and 15.8% after HIMRT (P=.97). There was a nonsignificant numeric increase in late GI toxicity in men treated with HIMRT compared with men treated with CIMRT. The actuarial 5-year grade ≥2 GI toxicity was 5.1% after CIMRT and 10.0% after HIMRT (P=.11). In men receiving HIMRT, the proportion of rectum receiving 36.9 Gy, 46.2 Gy, 64.6 Gy, and 73.9 Gy was associated with the development of late GI toxicity (P<.05).

The tweet rate nearly doubled within 2 h of both announcements. Fewer than 10% of tweets expressed an opinion about screening, and the majority of these were pro-screening during both periods. By contrast, anti-screening articles were tweeted more frequently in both the draft and finalised study periods. Between the draft and the finalised recommendations, the proportion of anti-screening tweets and anti-screening article links increased (P = 0.03 and P < 0.01, respectively).  Conclusions:   There was increased Twitter activity surrounding the USPSTF draft and finalised recommendations. The percentage of anti-screening tweets and articles appeared to increase, perhaps due to the interval public comment period. Despite this, most tweets did not express an opinion, suggesting a missed opportunity in this important arena for advocacy.""","""['Vinay Prabhu', 'Ted Lee', 'Stacy Loeb', 'John H Holmes', 'Heather T Gold', 'Herbert Lepor', 'David F Penson', 'Danil V Makarov']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Twitter response to the 2018 US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on prostate cancer screening.', 'Using Twitter to Assess the Public Response to the United States Preventive Services Task Force Guidelines on Lung Cancer Screening with Low Dose Chest CT.', 'Tweet content related to sexually transmitted diseases: no joking matter.', 'Geographic Differences in Cannabis Conversations on Twitter: Infodemiology Study.', ""Impact of the United States Preventive Services Task Force 'D' recommendation on prostate cancer screening and staging."", 'Prostate Cancer Screening and the Associated Controversy.', 'Trustworthy Health-Related Tweets on Social Media in Saudi Arabia: Tweet Metadata Analysis.', 'Incorporating Digital Tools to Improve Clinical Trial Infrastructure: A White Paper From the Digital Engagement Committee of SWOG.', 'Recent Patterns in Shared Decision Making for Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing in the United States.', 'Substantial utilization of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram in the prostate cancer community.', 'Public Response to Obamacare on Twitter.']"""

Furthermore, the impact of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction on PD was assessed. Anxiety, depression and PD were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in 329 prostate cancer patients before surgery as well as 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. These results were compared with those of a male German general population reference group. Adjustment to disease was assessed using the Perceived Adjustment to Chronic Illness Scale. Patients reported low levels of PD at all points of assessment similar to population norms of age-matched German men. Persistent PD was seen in about 8% of the patients and 20% had PD at least two of the measurement points. Relevant predictors for PD after surgery were urinary symptoms and baseline PD. Adjustment to disease was highest before surgery and had significantly reduced at 3 and 6 months after surgery. In general, men are resilient to the experience of localised prostate cancer and adjust well psychologically after surgery. However, between 8% and 20% of patients could possibly benefit from mental health support.""","""['N Köhler', 'M Friedrich', 'L Gansera', 'S Holze', 'R Thiel', 'S Roth', 'U Rebmann', 'J-U Stolzenburg', 'M C Truss', 'D Fahlenkamp', 'H-J Scholz', 'E Brähler']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Care (Engl)""","""['Long-term quality-of-life outcomes after radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting: the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-4 randomised trial.', 'Physical and emotional predictors of depression after radical prostatectomy.', ""Prospective study of men's psychological and decision-related adjustment after treatment for localized prostate cancer."", 'Psychological and psychosocial effects of prostate cancer.', 'Understanding urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: a nursing framework.', 'Adjustable continence therapy (proACT) for the treatment of male stress urinary incontinence post-prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2023 update).', 'Grand Challenge in Medical and Surgical Rehabilitation: From Mechanisms to Evidence Based Rehabilitation Programs.', 'Resilience in older adults with cancer: A scoping literature review.', 'Assessing the Impact of Decision Aid Use on Post Prostatectomy Patient Reported Outcomes.', 'Cognitive and Psychological Impacts of Different Treatment Options for Prostate Cancer: A Critical Analysis.']"""

Methods:   From a group of 1172 patients consisting of 592 (50.5%) robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and 580 (49.5%) open radical prostatectomy cases carried out between 1992 and 2008, 175 robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy cases were matched with an equal number of open radical prostatectomy cases by propensity scoring based on patient age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score and clinical tumor stage. Competing-risks survival analyses were used to evaluate oncological outcomes, including rates of positive surgical margin, biochemical-recurrence, adjuvant therapy, cancer-specific survival, overall survival and metastasis-free survival during the mean follow up of 58.4 months.  Results:   Positive surgical margin rates were comparable between robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open radical prostatectomy cohorts (19.4% vs 21.8%), with comparable rates for all pathological stages and risk subgroups. Positive surgical margin rates according to location were comparable, with the apical margin being the most common location. Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy recovered higher lymph node yields compared with open radical prostatectomy (12.5 vs 3.8; P < 0.001). The robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and the open radical prostatectomy groups showed equal oncological outcomes regarding 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival (log-rank P = 0.651), metastasis-free survival (log-rank P = 0.876), cancer-specific survival (log-rank P = 0.076) and overall survival (log-rank P = 0.648), respectively. Between groups, there was no difference in the rate of adjuvant therapy, time to first adjuvant therapy failure or in the rate of subsequent secondary treatment.

Methods:   Patients diagnosed with DM between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 were identified from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) within the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) programme. Using Cox regression models, we assessed the association between prescribed TZDs and cancer risk, TZDs' dose effect and the association between TZDs and specific cancer types. Hazard ratios (HR) were adjusted for potential confounders (age, gender, income, Charlson score index, metformin and insulin use).  Results and discussion:   The adjusted HRs for those prescribed TZD were 0·74 (95% CI 0·43-1·26, P = 0·27), 0·39 (95% CI 0·33-0·45, P < 0·001) and 0·49 (95% CI 0·27-0·89, P = 0·02), respectively, relative to non-DM patients, DM patients prescribed other anti-DM drugs besides TZDs and DM patients not prescribed any anti-DM drugs. In addition, the effects of TZDs were shown to be significantly dose dependent (P for trend < 0·001). The risk of breast, brain, colorectal, ear-nose-throat, kidney, liver, lung, lymphatic, prostate, stomach, and uterus cancer was significantly lower in those prescribed TZDs.

In this study, we examine the association between the surgical approach and functional outcomes after BNSRP.  Patients and methods:   The study included 609 patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) or open radical prostatectomy (ORP) between June 2008 and January 2011. Erectile function recovery was defined as an International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain (IIEF-EF) score ≥22. Urinary continence recovery was defined as being completely pad-free over a 24-hour period. Patients were stratified according to their probability of postoperative erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, according to previously published predictive models. Multivariable logistic regression tested the association between the surgical approach and functional outcomes recovery in the overall population after stratifying patients according to their risk of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence.  Results:   Patients treated with RARP had higher 2-year erectile function (52.1% vs 67.8%; P<0.001) and urinary continence (72.0% vs 87.4%; P<0.001) recovery rates as compared to their ORP counterparts. After stratification according to the erectile dysfunction risk, RARP led to higher erectile function recovery rates in the low- and intermediate-risk erectile dysfunction groups (all P<0.001).This did not hold true, however, in patients at high risk of erectile dysfunction (P=0.5). Similarly, when patients were stratified according to their urinary incontinence risk, RARP was associated with a higher probability of urinary continence recovery in the very low, low, and intermediate risk groups only (all P<0.001). This did not hold true, however, in the group of men at high risk of postoperative urinary incontinence (P=0.8).  Conclusions:   RARP leads to higher urinary continence and erectile function recovery rates compared with ORP. Not all patients benefit from this approach to the same extent, however. Accurate preoperative patient selection would result in substantial savings for the health care system.""","""['Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Andrea Gallina', 'Emanuele Zaffuto', 'Vito Cucchiara', 'Damiano Vizziello', 'Shahrokh Shariat', 'Francesco Cantiello', 'Rocco Damiano', 'Giorgio Guazzoni', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Bilateral nerve sparing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is associated with faster continence recovery but not with erectile function recovery compared with retropubic open prostatectomy: the need for accurate selection of patients.', 'Nerve-sparing approach during radical prostatectomy is strongly associated with the rate of postoperative urinary continence recovery.', 'Significance of erection hardness score as a diagnostic tool to assess erectile function recovery in Japanese men after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients: A System Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Most of patients with localized prostate cancer will be treated in the future? | Opinion: Yes.', 'Comprehensive approach for post-prostatectomy incontinence in the era of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The Effect of the Vesical Adaptation Response to Diuresis on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms after Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: A Pilot Proof of Concept Study.', 'Novel Technologies in Urologic Surgery: a Rapidly Changing Scenario.', 'Non-surgically related causes of erectile dysfunction after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.']"""

Materials and methods:   Seventy-six patients with suspected prostate cancer underwent T2-weighted imaging and DWI at 3 T using a phased-array coil, followed by radical prostatectomy. For prediction of ECE, the prostate was divided into six sectors. Two experienced radiologists analyzed T2-weighted images alone and in combination with DWI in consensus and rated the likelihood of ECE on a five-point scale. Tumor ADC values were measured, and the results were compared between patients with and without ECE.  Results:   Of the 456 sectors studied, 74 (16%) were positive for ECE in 31 patients. For prediction of ECE, the specificity and accuracy of combined T2-weighted imaging and DWI were 94.5% and 91.7%, respectively, superior to those of T2-weighted imaging alone (87.2% and 81.2%, respectively) (p < 0.001). On receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve (Az) of combined T2-weighted imaging and DWI (Az = 0.900) was significantly greater than that of T2-weighted imaging alone (Az = 0.828) (p < 0.001).

It is well known that hypoxia substantially reduces radiation sensitivity of cells both in vitro and in vivo. Given that contemporary management of men with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer includes the use of neoadjuvant androgen suppression and radiation, AD-induced hypoxia in the prostate could result in suboptimal therapeutic results. Given this concern, we fully investigate possible AD-induced hypoxia in the ventral prostate (VP) of adult rats by two independent methods.  Methods:   Tissue pO2 levels in the VP of adult Spraque-Dawley rats were evaluated prior to and at various time points following castration by two independent techniques. First, an Oxylab tissue oxygen monitor with a 240 μm probe was used for quantitative monitoring of global VP oxygenation. Second, fluorescence immunohistochemistry using the hypoxia marker EF5, known to be metabolically activated by hypoxic cells, was used to evaluate cell-to-cell variation in hypoxia at various days post-castration.  Results:   Neither the oxygen probe nor EF5 method demonstrate any substantive change in pO2 levels in the rat VP at any time point post-castration.  Conclusions:   We find no evidence that the rat VP becomes hypoxic at any point following castration using an animal model that closely mimics the human prostate. These data are in contrast to previous reports suggesting prostatic hypoxia occurs following AD and provide assurance that our present therapeutic strategy of neoadjuvant AD followed by radiation is not compromised by AD-induced tissue hypoxia.""","""['Sietze Regter', 'Mohammad Hedayati', 'Yonggang Zhang', 'Haoming Zhou', 'Susan Dalrymple', 'Cameron J Koch', 'John T Isaacs', 'Theodore L DeWeese']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Changes in the androgen levels in the ventral prostate of spontaneously hypertensive rats after castration.', 'Biomarker analysis demonstrates a hypoxic environment in the castrated rat ventral prostate gland.', 'Androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells transiently respond to castration treatment when growing in an androgen-dependent prostate environment.', 'Advances in the studies of androgen metabolism and de novo androgen synthesis in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hypoxia drives prostate tumour progression and impairs the effectiveness of therapy, but can also promote cell death and serve as a therapeutic target.', 'Signaling Pathways That Control Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Metformin can inhibit the progression of cancer. However, whether FoxM1 plays a role in EMT in prostate cancer (PCa) and whether metformin can suppress EMT through FoxM1 in PCa remain unresolved issues. In this study, we investigated the expression levels of the FoxM1 protein in 62 PCa and 39 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) samples and found that the expression levels of FoxM1 were higher in the PCa tissues (66.1%) compared with the BPH tissues (28.2%) (p<0.05). We observed that FoxM1 was expressed in the PCa cell lines and that metformin suppressed cell proliferation and the expression of FoxM1. We induced EMT in the PCa cells by the addition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and verified the process by examining EMT-related gene (E-cadherin, vimentin and Slug) expression. In addition, the knockdown of FoxM1 by shRNA in the PCa cells reversed EMT and markedly reduced cell migration. These results indicate that metformin suppresses EMT by inhibiting FoxM1.

No widely applicable, noninvasive method currently exists for specifically detecting tumor cell death after cytotoxic treatment and thus for predicting treatment outcomes.  Methods:   We have further characterized the targeting of the murine monoclonal antibody DAB4 specifically to dead tumor cells in vitro, in vivo, and in clinical samples. We found that sustained DAB4 binding to treated cells was closely associated with markers of intrinsic apoptosis and DNA double-strand break formation. In a competition binding assay, DAB4 bound EL4 murine thymic lymphoma cells in preference to the normal counterpart of murine thymocytes. Defective in vivo clearance of apoptotic cells augmented in vivo accumulation of DAB4 in tumors particularly after chemotherapy but was unchanged in normal tissues. Tumor targeting of DAB4 was selective for syngeneic murine tumors and for human tumor xenografts of prostate cancer (PC-3) and pancreatic cancer (Panc-1) before and more so after chemotherapy. Furthermore, DAB4 was shown to bind to dead primary acute lymphoblastic leukemic blasts cultured with cytotoxic drugs and dead epithelial cancer cells isolated from peripheral blood of small cell lung carcinoma patients given chemotherapy.  Conclusion:   Collectively, these results further demonstrate the selectivity of DAB4 for chemotherapy-induced dead tumor cells. This postchemotherapy selectivity is related to a relative increase in the availability of DAB4-binding targets in tumor tissue rather than in normal tissues. The in vitro findings were translated in vivo to human xenograft models and to ex vivo analyses of clinical samples, providing further evidence of the potential of DAB4 as a marker of tumor cell death after DNA-damaging cytotoxic treatment that could be harnessed as a predictive marker of treatment responses.""","""['Fares Al-Ejeh', 'Alexander H Staudacher', 'Douglas R Smyth', 'Jocelyn M Darby', 'Delphine Denoyer', 'Chris Tsopelas', 'Rodney J Hicks', 'Michael P Brown']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['In vivo targeting of dead tumor cells in a murine tumor model using a monoclonal antibody specific for the La autoantigen.', 'APOMAB, a La-specific monoclonal antibody, detects the apoptotic tumor response to life-prolonging and DNA-damaging chemotherapy.', 'Chemotherapy synergizes with radioimmunotherapy targeting La autoantigen in tumors.', 'The La antigen is over-expressed in lung cancer and is a selective dead cancer cell target for radioimmunotherapy using the La-specific antibody APOMAB®.', 'APOMAB Antibody-Drug Conjugates Targeting Dead Tumor Cells are Effective In Vivo.', 'The RNA-binding protein La/SSB associates with radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks in lung cancer cell lines.', 'Positron Emission Tomographic Imaging of Tumor Cell Death Using Zirconium-89-Labeled APOMAB® Following Cisplatin Chemotherapy in Lung and Ovarian Cancer Xenograft Models.', 'Improved non-invasive positron emission tomographic imaging of chemotherapy-induced tumor cell death using Zirconium-89-labeled APOMAB®.', 'Biodistribution and imaging of an hsp90 ligand labelled with 111In and 67Ga for imaging of cell death.', 'Updated developments on molecular imaging and therapeutic strategies directed against necrosis.']"""

Interactions between cancer associated carbohydrate Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (TF-Ag) and endothelium-expressed galectin-3 (Gal-3) have been identified as the leading molecular mechanism initiating tumor/endothelial cell adhesion in several types of cancer. However, it is unknown how these rather weak and transient carbohydrate/lectin mediated interactions are stabilized. Here, using Western blot and LC tandem mass spectrometry analyses of pull-downs utilizing TF-Ag loaded gold nanoparticles, we identified Gal-3, endothelial integrin α3β1, Src kinase, as well as 5 additional molecules mapping onto focal adhesion pathway as parts of the macromolecular complexes formed at the endothelial cell membranes downstream of TF-Ag/Gal-3 interactions. In a modified parallel flow chamber assay, inhibiting α3β1 integrin greatly reduced the strength of tumor/endothelial cell interactions without affecting the initial cancer cell adhesion. Further, the macromolecular complex induced by TF-Ag/Gal-3/α3β1 interactions activates Src kinase, p38, and ERK1/2, pathways in endothelial cells in a time- and α3β1-dependent manner. We conclude that, following the initial metastatic cell attachment to endothelial cells mediated by TF-Ag/Gal-3 interactions, endothelial integrin α3β1 stabilizes tumor/endothelial cell adhesion and induces the formation of macromolecular signaling complex activating several major signaling pathways in endothelial cells.""","""['Olga V Glinskii', 'Feng Li', 'Landon S Wilson', 'Stephen Barnes', 'Kate Rittenhouse-Olson', 'Joseph J Barchi Jr', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Vladislav V Glinsky']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Galectin-3 promotes lamellipodia formation in epithelial cells by interacting with complex N-glycans on alpha3beta1 integrin.', 'Peptides specific to the galectin-3 carbohydrate recognition domain inhibit metastasis-associated cancer cell adhesion.', 'Galectin-3 interaction with Thomsen-Friedenreich disaccharide on cancer-associated MUC1 causes increased cancer cell endothelial adhesion.', 'The role of TF- and Tn-antigens in breast cancer metastasis.', 'Physiological and pathological roles of alpha3beta1 integrin.', 'Isolipoic acid-linked gold nanoparticles bearing the thomsen friedenreich tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen: Stability and in vitro studies.', 'Therapeutic efficacy of the humanized JAA-F11 anti-Thomsen-Friedenreich antibody constructs H2aL2a and H3L3 in human breast and lung cancer xenograft models.', 'Changes in dynamics of tumor/endothelial cell adhesive interactions depending on endothelial cell growth state and elastic properties.', 'A Stable Gold Nanoparticle-Based Vaccine for the Targeted Delivery of Tumor-Associated Glycopeptide Antigens.', 'Evidence for Quantum Chemical Effects in Receptor-Ligand Binding Between Integrin and Collagen Fragments - A Computational Investigation With an Impact on Tissue Repair, Neurooncolgy and Glycobiology.']"""

We investigated supercritical extract of neem leaves (SENL) for the following: molecular targets in vitro, in vivo efficacy to inhibit tumor growth, and bioactive compounds that exert antitumor activity. Treatment of LNCaP-luc2 prostate cancer cells with SENL suppressed dihydrotestosterone-induced androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen levels. SENL inhibited integrin β1, calreticulin, and focal adhesion kinase activation in LNCaP-luc2 and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Oral administration of SENL significantly reduced LNCaP-luc2 xenograft tumor growth in mice with the formation of hyalinized fibrous tumor tissue, reduction in the prostate-specific antigen, and increase in AKR1C2 levels. To identify the active anticancer compounds, we fractionated SENL by high-pressure liquid chromatography and evaluated 16 peaks for cytotoxic activity. Four of the 16 peaks exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against prostate cancer cells. Mass spectrometry of the isolated peaks suggested the compounds with cytotoxic activity were nimbandiol, nimbolide, 2',3'-dihydronimbolide, and 28-deoxonimbolide. Analysis of tumor tissue and plasma samples from mice treated with SENL indicated 28-deoxonimbolide and nimbolide as the bioactive compounds.

Metronomic chemotherapy stabilizes various cancers through antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory effects. We evaluate the activity of metronomic oral cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in metastatic CRPC patients, and assess predictive factors for clinical outcomes.  Patients and methods:   Twenty-four patients with metastatic CRPC received an oral cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone regimen. Of those, 11 patients (45.8%) had been exposed and resistant to previous docetaxel chemotherapy. Six patients had refused to receive docetaxel chemotherapy, and 7 patients could not receive the therapy because of deteriorated performance status. All patients had already shown resistance to continuous dexamethasone therapy. Demographic and clinical data were collected prospectively.  Results:   A total of 16 patients (66.7%) experienced a reduction in PSA levels, and PSA decrease ≥ 50% was observed in 8 patients (33.3%). The median PSA progression-free and overall survival were 5.0 months and 19.0 months, respectively. The favorable PSA decrease had no associations with the progression-free and overall survival, but 7 patients (29.2%) in whom response had exceeded 8 months achieved long overall survival of 28 months in median.

Methods:   After an assessment of specificity validation focused on intra- and inter-operator reproducibility utilising a novel modification of incurred sample reanalysis (ISR). β-Content γ-confidence tolerance intervals (BCTI) and Cohen's Kappa (κ) were employed in statistical analysis of results.  Results:   In a first set of IHC reproducibility experiments, almost perfect agreement was recorded (κ=0.94) when two different operators scored CTC as overall positive or negative for AR. However, BCTI analysis identified a specific bias in scoring staining intensity, where one operator favoured moderate over strong assignments, whereas the reverse was the case with the second operator. After a period of additional training involving deployment of a panel of standardised images, a second set of validation experiments were conducted. These showed correction of the inter-operator bias by BCTI with κ for scoring intensity increasing from 0.59 to 0.81, indicative of almost perfect agreement.  Conclusions:   By application of BCTI to the validation of IHC, operator bias and therefore poor reproducibility can be identified, characterised and corrected to achieve a level of error normally associated with a quantitative biomarker assay, such as an ELISA.

Patients and methods:   Since January 2009, six patients had an open salvage radical prostatectomy with a lymph node dissection and without neurovascular bundles preservation for a low-dose I125 brachytherapy failure. Local recurrence was confirmed by trans-rectal biopsy or TURP. All the patients had PSA increase or lower urinary tract symptoms. Bone scan and pelvis MRI were performed to detect a locally advanced disease, a lymph node involvement or the presence of bone metastasis. Pathology reports and PSA level at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were analyzed.  Results:   Salvage radical prostatectomy with lymph node dissection was performed in all patients without major complications. The PSA level was below 0.1 ng/mL in five out of six patients at 1 and 3 months. The only case of persistent PSA is treated by androgen deprivation in a pT3b N1 patient.  Conclusion:   Salvage radical prostatectomy after brachytherapy failure was feasible with a limited perioperative morbidity.

While the format, focus and benefits of attending PCSGs have been reported little is known about primary physicians' (PPs) perceptions of these groups. This article describes Canadian primary physicians' views about face-to-face and web-based PCSGs.  Methods:   Canadian based primary physicians (n = 140) attending a 2012 Continuing Medical Education Conference participated in a pilot survey questionnaire study. The 56-item questionnaire used in this study included six sets of attitudinal items to measure primary physicians' beliefs about positive and negative influences of PCSGs, reasons for attending PCSGs, the attributes of effective PCSGs, and the value of face-to-face and web-based PCSGs.  Results:   Results showed that PCSGs were positively valued, particularly for information sharing, education and psychosocial support. Poor inclusivity, privacy, and accessibility were identified as potential barriers, and recommendations were made for better marketing and web-based PCSGs to increase engagement with potential attendees.  Conclusions:   Findings suggest PPs highly valued the role and potential benefits of PCSGs. Information provision and an educational role were perceived as key benefits amid the need to improve local and provincial marketing of PCSGs. The potential for web-based PCSGs to help in the support of PCa patients was also recognized.""","""['Bernard M Garrett', 'John L Oliffe', 'Joan L Bottorff', 'Michael McKenzie', 'Christina S Han', 'John S Ogrodniczuk']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Fam Pract""","""[""Prostate cancer support groups: Canada-based specialists' perspectives."", ""Canadian Nurses' Perspectives on Prostate Cancer Support Groups: A Survey Study."", 'Heterosexual couples and prostate cancer support groups: a gender relations analysis.', 'How prostate cancer support groups do and do not survive: British Columbian perspectives.', 'Prostate Cancer Support Groups: The Unadvertised Camaraderie.', 'Self-help friendliness in cancer care: A cross-sectional study among self-help group leaders in Germany.', ""Family doctors' attitudes toward peer support programs for type 2 diabetes and/or coronary artery disease: an exploratory survey among German practitioners.""]"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 37 patients who underwent 3T multiparametric MRI (T2-weighted imaging [T2WI], diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]/apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE] imaging) were included. A radiologist traced the borders of suspicious lesions on T2WI and ADC and assigned a suspicion score of between 2 and 5, while a uropathologist traced the borders of tumours on histopathological photographs. Software was used to co-register MRI and three-dimensional digital reconstructions of radical prostatectomy specimens and to compute imaging and histopathological volumes. Agreement in volumes between MRI and histology was assessed using Bland-Altman plots and stratified by tumour characteristics.  Results:   Among 50 tumours, the mean differences (95% limits of agreement) in MRI relative to histology were -32% (-128 to +65%) on T2WI and -47% (-143 to +49%) on ADC. For all tumour subsets, volume underestimation was more marked on ADC maps (mean difference ranging from -57 to -16%) than on T2WI (mean difference ranging from -45 to +2%). The 95% limits of agreement were wide for all comparisons, with the lower 95% limit ranging between -77 and -143% across assessments. Volume underestimation was more marked for tumours with a Gleason score ≥7 or a MRI suspicion score 4 or 5.  Conclusion:   Volume estimates of prostate cancer using MRI tended to substantially underestimate histopathological volumes, with a wide variability in extent of underestimation across cases.

We sought to determine whether statin use was associated with improved clinical outcome in men treated with brachytherapy for prostate cancer.  Materials/methods:   A database of men with prostate cancer treated with permanent Iodine-125 brachytherapy between January 1999 and February 2009 was retrospectively analyzed. Standard guidelines (i.e., American Brachytherapy Society selection criteria) were used for selecting patients for brachytherapy. Biochemical failure was defined using the Phoenix definition.  Results:   From a total of 247 men with prostate adenocarcinoma treated with brachytherapy, 174 patients (70 %) were identified as using statin medications, either during initial visit or during follow-up. Median PSA follow-up was 51 months after date of implant (range 9.4-140.35). Overall biochemical failure rate was 7.3 % (18 patients). On univariate analysis, statin use was associated with significantly improved freedom from biochemical failure [hazard ratio (HR) 0.28; 95 % CI 0.10-0.72; p < 0.01 by log-rank test]. In multivariate Cox analysis performed with the variables statin use, pretreatment PSA, clinical T stage, Gleason score, and D90 or V100, statin use remained significantly associated with improved freedom from biochemical failure (HR 0.288; 95 % CI 0.086-0.886; p = 0.0299).

Methods:   This was an open-label, randomized phase II multi-center study. Eligible patients had rising PSA on androgen deprivation therapy, minimal symptoms and were chemotherapy-naïve. Protocol therapy was either vandetanib 300 mg oral daily plus bicalutamide 50 mg oral daily (Arm A) or bicalutamide 50 mg oral daily alone (Arm B) with cross-over to vandetanib monotherapy at progression. The primary endpoint was PSA response (≥ 50 % decline from baseline).  Results:   Thirty-nine patients were recruited, 19 in Arm A and 20 in Arm B. PSA response was comparable in Arm A and Arm B (18 vs. 19 %). Time to PSA progression was 3.16 months (95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.09, not reached (NR)) for Arm A and 3.09 months (95 % CI: 1.22, NR) for Arm B. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was more common in Arm A compared to Arm B (42 vs. 5 %; p = 0.019). Treatment with vandetanib was associated with a reduction in soluble VEGFR-2 levels after two cycles but an increase in plasma VEGF levels.

We aimed to assess trends in cancer survival in the first two decades following these changes.  Material and methods:   We used population-based data from the Lithuanian Cancer Registry and period analysis techniques to examine trends in one-, 2-5- and five-year relative survival between 1995-1999 and 2005-2009 for 24 common cancers in Lithuania.  Results:   Between 1995-1999 and 2005-2009, five-year relative survival increased significantly for 20 of 24 cancers, and for 10 cancers the increase exceeded 10% units. Five-year relative survival estimates reached 46%, 69% and 91% for colorectal, breast and prostate cancer in 2005-2009, respectively, while patients with testicular cancer, Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had a five-year relative survival of 77%, 75% and 50%, respectively.  Conclusion:   We found a rapid increase in survival for most forms of common cancers in Lithuania between 1995 and 2009. Nevertheless, several cancers with effective therapies exhibit considerable gaps compared with Northern and Western European countries. Despite ongoing rises in survival, mortality declines are not yet manifesting for important common cancers such as breast and colorectal cancer. Rapid incidence rises suggest that increases in survival for prostate and thyroid cancers are massively influenced by early detection-related effects. Improving the availability of effective therapies, and carefully planned early detection programs may help to increase cancer survival in Lithuania in the future.""","""['Agne Krilaviciute', 'Giedre Smailyte', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Adam Gondos']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Recent trends in cancer survival across Europe between 2000 and 2004: a model-based period analysis from 12 cancer registries.', 'Recent cancer survival in Europe: a 2000-02 period analysis of EUROCARE-4 data.', 'Recent trends of cancer in Europe: a combined approach of incidence, survival and mortality for 17 cancer sites since the 1990s.', 'Survival for eight major cancers and all cancers combined for European adults diagnosed in 1995-99: results of the EUROCARE-4 study.', 'Cancer incidence, mortality and survival trends in Canada, 1970-2007.', 'Global pattern and trends of colorectal cancer survival: a systematic review of population-based registration data.', 'Bladder cancer trends in Latvia during 1990-2017: incidence, mortality, and survival rates.', 'Trends in Mortality Rates of Corpus Uteri and Ovarian Cancer in Lithuania, 1987-2016.', 'Testicular cancer incidence predictions in Europe 2010-2035: A rising burden despite population ageing.', 'Prostate cancer incidence and mortality in the Baltic states, Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.']"""

Methods and materials:   A ""Plan Quality Metric"" (PQM) with 14 submetrics, each with a unique value function, was defined for a prostate treatment plan, serving as specific goals of a hypothetical ""virtual physician."" The exact PQM logic was distributed to a population of treatment planners (to remove ambiguity of plan goals or plan assessment methodology) as was a predefined computed tomographic image set and anatomic structure set (to remove anatomy delineation as a variable). Treatment planners used their clinical treatment planning system (TPS) to generate their best plan based on the specified goals and submitted their results for analysis.  Results:   One hundred forty datasets were received and 125 plans accepted and analyzed. There was wide variability in treatment plan quality (defined as the ability of the planners and plans to meet the specified goals) quantified by the PQM. Despite the variability, the resulting PQM distributions showed no statistically significant difference between TPS employed, modality (intensity modulated radiation therapy versus arc), or education and certification status of the planner. The PQM results showed negligible correlation to number of beam angles, total monitor units, years of experience of the planner, or planner confidence.  Conclusions:   The ability of the treatment planners to meet the specified plan objectives (as quantified by the PQM) exhibited no statistical dependence on technologic parameters (TPS, modality, plan complexity), nor was the plan quality statistically different based on planner demographics (years of experience, confidence, certification, and education). Therefore, the wide variation in plan quality could be attributed to a general ""planner skill"" category that would lend itself to processes of continual improvement where best practices could be derived and disseminated to improve the mean quality and minimize the variation in any population of treatment planners.""","""['Benjamin E Nelms', 'Greg Robinson', 'Jay Markham', 'Kyle Velasco', 'Steve Boyd', 'Sharath Narayan', 'James Wheeler', 'Mark L Sobczak']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Inter-planner variation in treatment-plan quality of plans created with a knowledge-based treatment planning system.', 'Reducing inter- and intra-planner variability in radiotherapy plan output with a commercial knowledge-based planning solution.', 'Operating a treatment planning system using a deep-reinforcement learning-based virtual treatment planner for prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'SU-E-T-604: Inter Planner Dosimetric Variations in IMRT.', 'A Special Report on 2019 International Planning Competition and a Comprehensive Analysis of Its Results.', 'Plan Quality Analysis of Automated Treatment Planning Workflow With Commercial Auto-Segmentation Tools and Clinical Knowledge-Based Planning Models for Prostate Cancer.', 'Benchmarking Automated Machine Learning-Enhanced Planning With Ethos Against Manual and Knowledge-Based Planning for Locally Advanced Lung Cancer.', 'Scorecards: Quantifying Dosimetric Plan Quality in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', 'Simultaneous dose distribution and fluence prediction for nasopharyngeal carcinoma IMRT.', 'Standardization of knowledge-based volumetric modulated arc therapy planning with a multi-institution model (broad model) to improve prostate cancer treatment quality.']"""
