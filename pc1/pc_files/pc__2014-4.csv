Patients and methods:   Retrospective study of patients with clinically localised prostate cancer undergoing HIFU at a single centre between December 1997 and September 2009. Whole-gland treatment was applied. Patients also included if they had previously undergone transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). TURP was also conducted simultaneously to HIFU.

Matriptase mediates its biological effects both via as yet undefined substrates and pathways, and also by proteolytic cleavage of a variety of well-defined protein substrates, several of which it shares with the closely-related protease hepsin. Development of targeted therapeutic strategies will require discrimination between these proteases. Here we have investigated cyclic microproteins of the squash Momordica cochinchinensis trypsin-inhibitor family (generated by total chemical synthesis) and found MCoTI-II to be a high-affinity (Ki 9 nM) and highly selective (> 1,000-fold) inhibitor of matriptase. MCoTI-II efficiently inhibited the proteolytic activation of pro-hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) by matriptase but not by hepsin, in both purified and cell-based systems, and inhibited HGF-dependent cell scattering. MCoTI-II also selectively inhibited the invasion of matriptase-expressing prostate cancer cells. Using a model of epithelial cell tight junction assembly, we also found that MCoTI-II could effectively inhibit the re-establishment of tight junctions and epithelial barrier function in MDCK-I cells after disruption, consistent with the role of matriptase in regulating epithelial integrity. Surprisingly, MCoTI-II was unable to inhibit matriptase-dependent proteolytic activation of prostasin, a GPI-anchored serine protease also implicated in epithelial homeostasis. These observations suggest that the unusually high selectivity afforded by MCoTI-II and its biological effectiveness might represent a useful starting point for the development of therapeutic inhibitors, and further highlight the role of matriptase in epithelial maintenance.""","""['K Gray', 'S Elghadban', 'P Thongyoo', 'K A Owen', 'R Szabo', 'T H Bugge', 'E W Tate', 'R J Leatherbarrow', 'V Ellis']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Thromb Haemost""","""['Pericellular activation of hepatocyte growth factor by the transmembrane serine proteases matriptase and hepsin, but not by the membrane-associated protease uPA.', 'High-affinity cyclic peptide matriptase inhibitors.', 'Engineering a potent inhibitor of matriptase from the natural hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type-1 (HAI-1) protein.', 'Recent progress on inhibitors of the type II transmembrane serine proteases, hepsin, matriptase and matriptase-2.', 'The matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade in epithelial development and pathology.', 'Insights into the synthesis strategies of plant-derived cyclotides.', 'Membrane-anchored serine proteases as regulators of epithelial function.', 'Cell surface-anchored serine proteases in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Peptide-based protease inhibitors from plants.', 'Blocking the proteolytic activity of zymogen matriptase with antibody-based inhibitors.']"""

A multicomponent intervention was piloted in this population. Changes in OP knowledge, self-efficacy, health beliefs, and engagement in HBBs were evaluated.  Methods:   A pre-post pilot study was performed in a convenience sample of men recruited from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Men were sent personalized letters explaining their dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results and fracture risk assessment with an OP-related education booklet. Participants completed questionnaires assessing OP knowledge, self-efficacy, health beliefs, and current engagement in HBBs at baseline (T1) and 3 months post-intervention (T2). Paired t tests and McNemar's test were used to assess changes in outcomes.  Results:   A total of 148 men completed the study. There was an increase in OP knowledge (9.7 ± 4.3 to 11.4 ± 3.3, p < 0.0001) and feelings of susceptibility (16.5 ± 4.3 to 17.4 ± 4.7, p = 0.015), but a decrease in total self-efficacy (86.3 ± 22.9 to 81.0 ± 27.6, p = 0.007) from baseline to post-intervention. Men made appropriate changes in their overall daily calcium intake (p ≤ 0.001), and there was uptake of vitamin D supplementation from 44 % (n = 65) to 68 % (n = 99) (p < 0.0001). Men with bone loss (osteopenia or OP) had a greater change in susceptibility (1.9 ± 4.3 vs. -0.22 ± 4.2, p = 0.005) compared to men with normal bone density.

Methods:   Questionnaires were mailed in 2005 to 2006 to breast, prostate, colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancer survivors (4 to 14 years after diagnosis), sampled from California SEER cancer registries.  Results:   Most survivors (n = 1,490) reported recent follow-up care (68.7%), generally from oncology specialists only (47.4%) or shared between oncology and primary care providers (PCPs; 27.6%). Most survivors reported follow-up care advice (79.9%); fewer reported late-effects advice or receipt of a treatment summary (41.7% and 19.9%, respectively). Survivors who identified a PCP as their main follow-up care physician were as likely as those identifying an oncology specialist to rate their care as high quality (odds ratio [OR], 2.56; 95% CI, 0.98 to 6.74); however, survivors who could not identify a main follow-up care provider were less likely to report high-quality care (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.50). Compared with follow-up care by an oncology specialist only, care by a PCP only was associated with a lower quality-of-care rating (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.91), but there was no significant difference in quality rating by survivors when care was shared by an oncology specialist and PCP compared with an oncology specialist only.

Ipilimumab, which blocks the T cell inhibitory molecule CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4), induces hypophysitis in about 4% of patients through unknown mechanisms. We first established a model of secondary hypophysitis by repeated injections of a CTLA-4 blocking antibody into SJL/J or C57BL/6J mice, and showed that they developed lymphocytic infiltration of the pituitary gland and circulating pituitary antibodies. We next assessed the prevalence of pituitary antibodies in a cohort of 20 patients with advanced melanoma or prostate cancer, 7 with a clinical diagnosis of hypophysitis, before and after ipilimumab administration. Pituitary antibodies, negative at baseline, developed in the 7 patients with hypophysitis but not in the 13 without it; these antibodies predominantly recognized thyrotropin-, follicle-stimulating hormone-, and corticotropin-secreting cells. We then hypothesized that the injected CTLA-4 antibody could cause pituitary toxicity if bound to CTLA-4 antigen expressed ""ectopically"" on pituitary endocrine cells. Pituitary glands indeed expressed CTLA-4 at both RNA and protein levels, particularly in a subset of prolactin- and thyrotropin-secreting cells. Notably, these cells became the site of complement activation, featuring deposition of C3d and C4d components and an inflammatory cascade akin to that seen in type II hypersensitivity. In summary, the study offers a mechanism to explain the pituitary toxicity observed in patients receiving ipilimumab, and highlights the utility of measuring pituitary antibodies in this form of secondary hypophysitis.""","""['Shintaro Iwama', 'Alessandra De Remigis', 'Margaret K Callahan', 'Susan F Slovin', 'Jedd D Wolchok', 'Patrizio Caturegli']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Sci Transl Med""","""['Hypophysitis Secondary to Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4 Blockade: Insights into Pathogenesis from an Autopsy Series.', 'Prevalence of hypophysitis in a cohort of patients with metastatic melanoma and prostate cancer treated with ipilimumab.', 'Long-term follow-up of ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis, a common adverse event of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody in melanoma.', 'Hypophysitis: increasingly complex clinicopathological spectrum!.', 'Current update on hypophysitis.', 'Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Colitis: From Pathogenesis to Management.', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors promising role in cancer therapy: clinical evidence and immune-related adverse events.', 'Induction of Hypopituitarism Following Ipilimumab/Nivolumab Therapy Followed by Radiation in the Treatment of Metastatic Scalp Melanoma.', 'Progress and Challenges of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Hypophysitis.', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors: maximizing benefit whilst minimizing toxicity.']"""

Therefore, novel mechanism and target-based approaches are needed for the management of this neoplasm. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation correlates with human prostate cancer progression and metastasis. However, the role of mTOR in prostate cancer is not well-established. Here, we demonstrate that mTOR is over-expressed in both clinical tissue specimens and cultured human prostate cancer cells when compared to normal prostate tissues, respectively. Further, mTOR gene knockdown via lentivirus mediated mTOR specific shRNA resulted in a significant decrease in the viability and growth of prostate cancer cells without affecting normal human prostate cells. In addition, mTOR inhibition resulted in a significant i) decrease in 4EBP1, S6K, PI3K and AKT protein, ii) increase in PARP protein of prostate cancer cells. Most importantly, mTOR inhibition triggered apoptosis and suppressed pancreatic carcinoma growth in vivo in a mouse xenograft model.

As research has demonstrated the beneficial effect of exercise for cancer management, a growing number of patients with cancer are undertaking structured exercise programs.  Purpose:   This study aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of formal exercise testing in clinical settings as it is becoming increasingly used as a screening tool and for exercise prescription purposes.  Methods:   One hundred and twelve patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) took part in a physician-supervised multistage maximal stress test (Bruce protocol). Sixty patients had been on ADT for <3 months (acute), whereas 52 had been on ADT for >3 months (chronic).  Results:   Of these men, 85% were able to meet the criteria for the attainment of V˙O2max, whereas three positive tests (3.2%) were observed. The three participants who recorded a positive stress test underwent further medical examination and were subsequently cleared of clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Apart from the relatively low V˙O2max (24.7 ± 6.0 mL·kg·min, 10th-15th percentile), compared with normative data in healthy age-matched controls, the cardiovascular response to exercise was similar in this cancer population. Moreover, treatment duration did not seem to influence cardiovascular responses to exercise. This early evidence suggests that risk of adverse events during maximal exercise testing is relatively low in this population and certainly no higher than that in ages-matched, apparently healthy individuals.  Conclusions:   Maximal exercise testing was demonstrated to be feasible and safe, providing a direct assessment of V˙O2max.

AR protein levels are controlled by the AR-PMEPA1 negative feedback loop through NEDD4-E3 ligase. Reduced expression of PMEPA1 observed in prostate tumors, suggests that loss of PMEPA1 may play critical roles in prostate tumorigenesis. This study focuses on epigenetic mechanisms of reduced PMEPA1 expression in the cancer of the prostate (CaP). Benign (n = 77) and matched malignant (n = 77) prostate epithelial cells were laser capture micro-dissected from optimum cutting temperature embedded frozen prostate sections from 42 Caucasian American (CA) and 35 African American (AA) cases. Purified DNA specimens were analyzed for CpG methylation of the PMEPA1 gene. PMEPA1 mRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Analysis of PMEPA1 methylation and mRNA expression in the same tumor cell populations indicated a significant inverse correlation between mRNA expression and methylation in CaP (P = 0.0115). We noted higher frequency of CpG methylation within the evaluated first intronic region of the PMEPA1 gene in prostate tumors of CA men as compared with AA. In CaP cell lines, PMEPA1 expression was induced and AR protein levels were diminished in response to treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine). Cell culture-based studies demonstrated that decitabine restores PMEPA1 expression in AR-positive CaP cell lines.

Twenty high-risk prostate cancer patients were included in a prospective trial evaluating sentinel nodes on pelvic SPECT acquisition. To be eligible for the dosimetric study, patients had to present with pararectal sentinel nodes usually not included in the clinical target volume encompassing the pelvic lymph nodes. Radiotherapy-plans including the prostate, the seminal vesicles, and the pelvic lymph nodes with the pararectal sentinel nodes were optimized for 6 eligible patients. IMXT and IMPT were delivered with 7 and 3 beams respectively and VMAT with 2 arcs. Results were assessed with Dose-Volume Histograms and predictive normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) models between the three competing treatment modalities aiming to deliver a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy daily fractions. Target coverage was optimized with IMPT when compared to IMXT and VMAT. Coverage of the sentinel node was slightly better with IMXT (D98% 5 57.3 ± 5.1 Gy) when compared with VMAT (D98% 5 56.2 ± 4.1 Gy). The irradiation of rectal, bladder, small bowel, and femoral heads volumes was significantly reduced with IMPT when compared to IMXT and VMAT. NTCPs rates for rectal and bladder ≥ grade-3 late toxicity were better with IMPT (0.4 ± 0.0% and 0.0 ± 0.0%) compared with IMXT (4.6 ± 3.3% and 1.4 ± 1.1%), and VMAT (4.5 ± 4.0% and 1.6 ± 1.6%), respectively. Acceptable dose-volume distributions and low rectal and urinary NTCPs were estimated to geometrically complex pelvic volumes such as the ones proposed in this study using IMXT, VMAT and IMPT.

To optimize the CAR design, we used antigen-recognition domains derived from mouse or human antibodies, and intracellular signaling domains containing one or two T cell costimulatory elements, in addition to CD3zeta. Comparing multiple constructs established that the CAR based on human monoclonal antibody Ha1-4.117 had the greatest reactivity in vitro. To further analyze this CAR, we developed a human pancreatic cancer xenograft model and adoptively transferred CAR-engineered T cells into animals with established tumors. CAR-engineered human lymphocytes induced significant antitumor activity, and unlike what has been described for other CARs, a second-generation CAR (containing CD28 cosignaling domain) induced a more potent antitumor effect than a third-generation CAR (containing CD28 and 41BB cosignaling domains).

We investigated the functional impact of irradiated PCa cells with a modulated costimulatory profile on responder T-cell activity. We used three PCa cell lines (DU145, PC3, and LNCaP) and two epithelial cell lines from noncancerous prostate and lung tissue. After 72 hours of EBRT, surface expression of four immunostimulatory molecules (CD70, CD275/ICOSL, CD134L/OX40L, and CD137L/41BBL) and two immunosuppressive markers (CTLA-4/CD152 and PD-L1/CD274) were evaluated by flow cytometry. We evaluated the impact of several radiation doses and the longevity of modulated expression. We examined the functional impact of radiation-induced modulation of cancer cells by cytotoxic T cells (CTL) cytotoxicity and ELISPOT assay for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production. Last, we evaluated whether IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression could be reversed by EBRT. After 10 Gy EBRT, expression of OX40L and 41BBL increased in all three PCa cell lines; expression of CD70 and ICOSL increased in PC3 cells. Conversely, a decrease in PD-L1 expression in DU145 and PC3 cells was detectable up to 144 hours after EBRT. No PD-L1 was detected in LNCaP. Epithelial cells from normal prostate were not modulated by radiation. CTL cytolytic activity and IFN-γ production were enhanced by interaction with irradiated PCa cells. Finally, EBRT failed to prevent IFN-γ-induced upregulation of PD-L1. We demonstrate that a single dose of EBRT increased surface expression of costimulatory molecules and decreased the expression of coinhibitory molecules in human PCa cell lines. Changes in irradiated tumor cells led to functional enhancement of T-cell activity, despite EBRT failing to reduce IFN-γ-induced expression of PD-L1. These data suggest that combining radiotherapy with T-cell stimulating immunotherapy may be an attractive strategy for cancer treatment.""","""['Michael B Bernstein', 'Charlie T Garnett', 'Huogang Zhang', 'Anna Velcich', 'Max M Wattenberg', 'Sofia R Gameiro', 'Shalom Kalnicki', 'James W Hodge', 'Chandan Guha']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['PD-L1 partially protects renal tubular epithelial cells from the attack of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.', 'Turning T cells on: epigenetically enhanced expression of effector T-cell costimulatory molecules on irradiated human tumor cells.', 'ILT4 inhibition prevents TAM- and dysfunctional T cell-mediated immunosuppression and enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in NSCLC with EGFR activation.', 'CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer immunotherapy: A review.', 'Roles of PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway: Signaling, Cancer, and Beyond.', 'Immunogenomic profiles associated with response to life-prolonging agents in prostate cancer.', 'Silk-Gel Powered Adenoviral Vector Enables Robust Genome Editing of PD-L1 to Augment Immunotherapy across Multiple Tumor Models.', 'Targets of Immune Escape Mechanisms in Cancer: Basis for Development and Evolution of Cancer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.', 'PROTEIN KINASE C ALPHA IS A CENTRAL NODE FOR TUMORIGENIC TRANSCRIPTIONAL NETWORKS IN HUMAN PROSTATE CANCER.', 'Radiation-induced PD-L1 expression in tumor and its microenvironment facilitates cancer-immune escape: a narrative review.']"""

Aim:   To determine the potentially paradoxical effect of rosmarinic acid, typically being radioprotective when applied to non-tumorous cells, yet conversely displaying a sensitizing action when applied to metastatic B16F10 melanoma cells.  Materials and methods:   The genoprotective effect was studied by means of micronucleus tests for anti-mutagenic activity in which the reduction in the frequency of micronuclei was evaluated using cytokinesis-blocked human lymphocytes. The radioprotective effect was studied via a cell viability test in PNT2 (human prostate epithelium) and B16F10 melanoma cells.  Results:   Rosmarinic acid exhibits a significant genoprotective capacity (p<0.001) against X-rays with a protection factor of 58%, and a dose reduction factor of 7.2. Cell survival obtained after exposure to 10 Gy of X-rays showed a protection factor of 47.5%, thus eliminating 29.1% of radiation-induced cell death in normal prostate epithelial cells (p<0.001). However, in metastatic B16F10 melanoma cells, rosmarinic acid acted not as a radioprotector, but as a sensitizing agent, increasing cellular death by 42% (p<0.001), with an enhancement ratio of 2.36.  Conclusion:   Rosmarinic acid has an increased capacity for producing radio-induced damage, and thus a paradoxical damaging effect in melanoma cells.

SIRs were decreased for esophageal (0.50), liver (0.62) and lung (0.78) cancers, and the three sources of data agreed in the direction of the effect. The increased risks for testicular, renal, prostate and endocrine cancers may be explained by immunological mechanisms. Excess risk for these cancer accounts for a significant population attributable fraction.

With the introduction of new agents for anti-androgen therapy as well as alternate mechanisms of action, new therapeutic options before and after docetaxel chemotherapy have arisen (Ohlmann et al. in World J Urol 30(4):495-503, 2012). The question regarding the occurrence of an enzalutamide withdrawal syndrome (EWS) has not been evaluated yet. In this study, we assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response after discontinuation of enzalutamide.  Methods:   In total 31 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) underwent an enzalutamide withdrawal and were evaluated. Data were gathered from 6 centres in Germany. Patients with continuous oral administration of enzalutamide with rising serum PSA levels were evaluated, starting from enzalutamide withdrawal until subsequent therapy was initiated, follow-up ended or death of the patient occurred. Statistical evaluation was performed applying one-sided binomial testing using R-statistical software, version 3.0.1.  Results:   Mean withdrawal follow-up was 6.5 weeks (range 1-26.1 weeks). None of the 31 patients showed a PSA decline. Mean relative PSA rise over all patients was 73.9 % (range 0.5-440.7 %) with a median of 44.9 %.  Conclusions:   If existent, an AAWS is at least very rare for enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC after taxane-based chemotherapy and does not play a clinical role in this setting. This may be attributed to the different pharmacodynamics of enzalutamide. Longer duration of therapy or a longer withdrawal interval may reveal a rare EWS in the future.""","""['Christoph A J von Klot', 'Mario W Kramer', 'Alena Böker', 'Thomas R W Herrmann', 'Inga Peters', 'Markus A Kuczyk', 'Uwe Ligges', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Margitta Retz', 'Sebastian C Schmid', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Christian Schwentner', 'Tilmann Todenhöfer', 'Michael Stöckle', 'Carsten-Henning Ohlmann', 'Ines Azone', 'René Mager', 'Georg Bartsch', 'Axel Haferkamp', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'Charlotte Piper', 'Axel S Merseburger']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Is there an antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome with enzalutamide?', 'Abiraterone acetate after progression with enzalutamide in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a multi-center retrospective analysis.', 'Enzalutamide in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A retrospective Korean multicenter study in a real-world setting.', 'Antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome (AAWS) in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', ""Spontaneous Remission of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Coley's Toxin Revisited?"", 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonists and challenges in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Reproductive toxicity of linuron following gestational exposure in rats and underlying mechanisms.', 'Enzalutamide: a review of its use in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'An update on enzalutamide in the treatment of prostate cancer.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   Stratified, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study with 1:1 randomization at 76 community-based and tertiary medical sites in the United States and Canada. Two hundred forty-two participants with intact erectile function scheduled to receive radiotherapy for prostate cancer were recruited between November 2009 and February 2012 with follow-up through March 2013.  Interventions:   One hundred twenty-one participants were assigned 5 mg of tadalafil daily and 121 were assigned placebo for 24 weeks starting with external radiotherapy (63%) or brachytherapy (37%). Participant-reported International Index of Erectile Function response before radiotherapy and at weeks 2 and 4, between weeks 20 and 24, between weeks 28 and 30, and 1 year thereafter. Participants and partners could respond also to the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire and to the Locke Marital Adjustment Test before radiotherapy, between weeks 20 and 24 and weeks 28 and 30, and at 1 year.  Main outcomes and measures:   Primary outcome was off-drug spontaneous erectile function 28 to 30 weeks after radiotherapy started. Secondary end points were spontaneous erection at 1 year; overall sexual function and satisfaction; marital adjustment; and partner-reported satisfaction and marital adjustment at 28 to 30 weeks and 1 year, predictors of tadalafil response; and adverse events.  Results:   Among 221 evaluable participants, 80 (79%; 95% CI, 70%-88%) assigned to receive tadalafil retained erectile function between weeks 28 and 30 compared with 61 (74%; 95% CI, 63%-85%) assigned to receive placebo (P = .49); an absolute difference of 5% (95% CI, -9% to 19%).

Tadalafil was not associated with significantly improved overall sexual function or satisfaction; a significant difference was not observed in any domain subscale. Partners of men assigned tadalafil noted no significant effect on sexual satisfaction, and marital adjustment was not significantly improved in participants or partners.  Conclusions and relevance:   Among men undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer, daily use of tadalafil compared with placebo did not result in improved erectile function.

However, their topographical anatomy and fiber components have remained unclear.  Methods:   Using histological sections from ten elderly donated cadavers, we investigated the topographical anatomy and composite fibers of the NIAS using immunohistochemistry for S100 protein, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH).  Results:   At the 2-3 o'clock position in the lower rectum, the NIAS originated from nerves at the posterolateral corner of the prostate in males or in the lower paracolpium in females. The nerves ran inferiorly along the internal aspect of the levator ani muscle, and joined branches of the myenteric plexus at a level slightly above the epithelial junction. The NIAS contained both nNOS-positive parasympathetic nerve fibers and TH-positive sympathetic fibers, but VIP-positive fibers were few in number.  Conclusions:   The origin of the NIAS at the posterolateral corner of the prostate as well as in the lower paracolpium might be sacrificed or damaged during radical prostatectomy or tension-free vaginal tape insertion. Low anterior resection of rectal cancer will most likely render damage to the NIAS because of its intersphincteric course. Although the nerve composition of the NIAS is characterized by a higher proportion of sympathetic nerve fibers than the myenteric plexus in the large intestine, their role is unclear.

In the present study, the effect of 6-SHO on the growth of prostate cancer cells was investigated. 6-SHO effectively reduced survival and induced apoptosis of cultured human (LNCaP, DU145, and PC3) and mouse (HMVP2) prostate cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that 6-SHO reduced constitutive and interleukin (IL)-6-induced STAT3 activation and inhibited both constitutive and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activity in these cells. In addition, 6-SHO decreased the level of several STAT3 and NF-κB-regulated target genes at the protein level, including cyclin D1, survivin, and cMyc and modulated mRNA levels of chemokine, cytokine, cell cycle, and apoptosis regulatory genes (IL-7, CCL5, BAX, BCL2, p21, and p27). 6-SHO was more effective than two other compounds found in ginger, 6-gingerol, and 6-paradol at reducing survival of prostate cancer cells and reducing STAT3 and NF-κB signaling. 6-SHO also showed significant tumor growth inhibitory activity in an allograft model using HMVP2 cells.

Methods:   The proposed models were evaluated for prostate cancer diagnosis. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and concentration-time curves were calculated in each voxel. The simultaneous generation of parametric maps related to permeability and dispersion was obtained through model fitting. A preliminary validation was carried out through comparison with the histology in 15 patients referred for radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Cancer localization was accurate with both dispersion models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve greater than 0.8. None of the compared parameters, aimed at assessing vascular permeability and perfusion, showed better results.  Conclusions:   A new DCE-MRI method is proposed to characterize the microvascular architecture through the assessment of intravascular dispersion, without the need for separate arterial-input-function estimation. The results are promising and encourage further research.""","""['Massimo Mischi', 'Simona Turco', 'Cristina Lavini', 'Kyveli Kompatsiari', 'Jean J M C H de la Rosette', 'Marcel Breeuwer', 'Hessel Wijkstra']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['Prostate cancer localization by novel magnetic resonance dispersion imaging.', 'Quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis of prostate cancer DCE-MRI at 3T: comparison of two arterial input functions on cancer detection with digitized whole mount histopathological validation.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of tumors: preclinical validation of parametric images.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of the prostate.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and pharmacokinetic models in prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacokinetic modeling of PSMA-targeted nanobubbles for quantification of extravasation and binding in mice models of prostate cancer.', 'Influence of maternal and infant factors on CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in umbilical cord blood.', 'Super-Resolution Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Methodology for the Identification of In Vivo Vascular Dynamics in 2D.', 'Dynamics of angiogenesis and cellularity in rabbit VX2 tumors using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate gender specific differences in persistence with BIS in MBD for the first time in this regard.  Patients and methods:   Out of the original database of 16 million patients, we extracted first-time metastatic cancer related BIS prescriptions from January 2001 to December 2011 in patients diagnosed with MBD following breast cancer (BC) or prostate cancer (PC). Patients were matched (1 : 1) in accordance to age. For persistence analyses, 1,007 patients with metastatic BC and PC were available.  Results:   After 1 year of follow-up, 35.3% of BC and 26.6% of PC patients treated with BIS discontinued their treatment (p < 0.001). The differences were irrespective of increased refill gaps and route of BIS administration. The multivariate hazard ratios of the Cox regression models for 1-year risk of BIS discontinuation (adjusting for multiple variables) showed no increased risk for treatment discontinuation for BC vs. PC patients (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 - 1.17). The use of co-medications decreased, regional and insurance aspects increased the risk of treatment discontinuation (HR of 0.88, 1.50, and 1.42).  Conclusions:   Although apparent in the primary analysis, we found no significant difference in the gender specific persistency after 12 months of first BIS treatment in MBD. Only co-medication, geographical and insurance aspects were associated with differences in discontinuation rates.

Based on our prior genome-wide interrogation of human prostate cancer tissues to identify genes over-expressed in cancer and absent in the periphery, we targeted SIM2 as a prototype autologous tumor antigen for these studies. Using humanized transgenic mice we found that the 9aa HLA-A*0201 epitope, SIM2(237-245), was effective at inducing an antigen specific response against SIM2-expressing prostate cancer cell line, PC3. Immunization with a multi-epitope peptide harboring both MHC-I and MHC-II restricted epitopes induced an IFN-γ response in CD8 T cells to the HLA-A*0201-restricted SIM2(237-245) epitope, and an IL-2 response by CD4 T cells to the SIM2(240-254) epitope. This peptide was also effective at inducing CD8+ T-cells that responded specifically to SIM2-expressing tumor cells.

Cucurbitacin B (CuB) is a naturally occurring compound that is found abundantly in cucumbers and other vegetables, and it is known to exert anti-cancer activities (primarily via apoptosis-induction) in several human cancers. However, its chemopreventive potential for prostate cancer has not yet been investigated. Here, we reported that CuB significantly and specifically inhibited prostate cancer cell growth with low IC50 (~0.3 μM; PC-3 and LNCaP), accompanied by marked apoptosis (Caspase 3/7 activation, PARP cleavage, increase of Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 (Alexa488)+ cells and accumulation of Sub-G0/G1 population), whereas normal human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) were CuB-insensitive. Using a chemopreventive model, pre-treatment of mice with CuB (2 weeks before PC-3 prostate cancer cell implantation) significantly reduced the rate of in vivo tumor-formation. A 79% reduction in tumor size (accompanied by marked in situ apoptosis) was observed in the CuB-treated group (with no noticeable toxicity) vs. controls at day 31. Strikingly, mechanistic investigations demonstrated that CuB drove dose-dependent inhibition of ATP citrate lyase phosphorylation (ACLY; an important enzyme for cancer metabolism) both in vitro and in the CuB-chemopreventive mouse model. Importantly, ACLY over-expression abrogated CuB's apoptotic effects in prostate cancer cells, confirming ACLY as a direct target of CuB. Thus, CuB harbors potent chemopreventive activity for prostate cancer, and we revealed a novel anti-tumor mechanism of CuB via inhibition of ACYL signaling in human cancer.""","""['Yajuan Gao', 'Mohammad Shyful Islam', 'Jiang Tian', 'Vivian Wai Yan Lui', 'Dong Xiao']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Cucurbitacin B potently suppresses non-small-cell lung cancer growth: identification of intracellular thiols as critical targets.', 'Cucurbitacin B inhibits breast cancer metastasis and angiogenesis through VEGF-mediated suppression of FAK/MMP-9 signaling axis.', 'Tirucallic acids are novel pleckstrin homology domain-dependent Akt inhibitors inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) inhibitors: An anti-cancer strategy at the crossroads of glucose and lipid metabolism.', 'Zinc as an anti-tumor agent in prostate cancer and in other cancers.', 'Cucurbitacin C as an effective anti-cancer agent: unveiling its potential role against cholangiocarcinoma and mechanistic insights.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Apoptotic and antimetastatic effect of cucurbitacins in cancer: recent trends and advancement.', 'CUCUME: An RNA methylation database integrating systemic mRNAs signals, GWAS and QTL genetic regulation and epigenetics in different tissues of Cucurbitaceae.', 'Cucurbitacins as potential anticancer agents: new insights on molecular mechanisms.']"""

Recent studies have implicated estrogen, acting either alone or synergistically with androgens in the development of castrate resistant prostate cancer. Several in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as a limited number of clinical trials, have highlighted the potential of selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as raloxifene (Ral) for the treatment of castrate resistant prostate cancer. However, the poor oral bioavailability and metabolism of selective estrogen receptor modulators limit their efficiency in clinical application. To overcome these limitations, we have used styrene co-maleic acid (SMA) micelle to encapsulate raloxifene. Compared to free drug, SMA-Ral micelles had 132 and 140% higher cytotoxicity against PC3 and DU 145 prostate cell lines, respectively. SMA-Ral effectively inhibits cell cycle progression, increases apoptosis, and alters the integrity of tumor spheroid models. In addition, the micellar system induced changes in expression and localization of estrogen receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and downstream effectors associated with cell proliferation and survival. Finally, SMA-Ral treatment decreased migration and invasion of castrate resistant prostate cancer cell lines. In conclusion, SMA-Ral micelles can potentially benefit new strategies for clinical management of castrate resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Sebastien Taurin', 'Hayley Nehoff', 'Thalita van Aswegen', 'Rhonda J Rosengren', 'Khaled Greish']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['A combination of sorafenib and nilotinib reduces the growth of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Raloxifene nanomicelles reduce the growth of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Antitumor activity of raloxifene-targeted poly(styrene maleic acid)-poly (amide-ether-ester-imide) co-polymeric nanomicelles loaded with docetaxel in breast cancer-bearing mice.', 'Could in-vitro studies on Ishikawa cell lines explain the endometrial safety of raloxifene?

Interestingly, Alternol-induced cell death was completely abolished by reactive oxygen species scavengers N-acetylcysteine and dihydrolipoic acid. We also demonstrated that the proapoptotic Bax protein was activated after Alternol treatment and was critical for Alternol-induced apoptosis.

Methods:   Electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched between January 1966 and April 2013 to identify eligible studies. Pooled relative ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to assess the influence of aspirin use on prostate cancer risk. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   A total of 24 observational studies including 14 case-control studies and 10 cohort studies were eligible for this meta-analysis. Regular aspirin use was associated with reduction in overall and advanced prostate cancer risk (pooled RR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.81-0.92; pooled RR 0.83, 95 % CI 0.75-0.91, respectively). When we restricted our analyses to studies with long-time regular aspirin use (equal or more than 4 years), reverse association became stronger (pooled RR 0.82, 95 % CI 0.72-0.93; pooled RR 0.70, 95 % CI 0.55-0.90, respectively).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that regular, especially long-time regular aspirin use may reduce the risk of overall and advanced prostate cancer. Considering the limitation of included studies, further well-designed large-scaled cohort studies and RCTs are required to draw more definitive conclusions.""","""['Tian-Bao Huang', 'Yang Yan', 'Zhui-Feng Guo', 'Xiao-Long Zhang', 'Huan Liu', 'Jiang Geng', 'Xu-Dong Yao', 'Jun-Hua Zheng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Associations between aspirin use and the risk of cancers: a meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'Aspirin use and lung cancer risk: a possible relationship?

The purpose of this study was to determine if T2 signal intensity (SI) differs from conventional adenocarcinoma (CCa).  Materials and methods:   A retrospective study of patients who underwent preoperative MRI and prostatectomy between 2009 and 2012 was performed. T2 SI ratios (SIR) for tumour (T) to obturator internus muscle (M) and normal peripheral zone (PZ) were compared. Two radiologists evaluated the central gland/PZ to detect tumours and compared diagnostic accuracy.  Results:   T2 SIR for DCa were 3.60 (T/M), 0.66 (T/PZ); 2.68 (T/M), 0.47 (T/PZ) for Gleason 9; 2.50 (T/M), 0.47 (T/PZ) for Gleason 7/8 and 3.95 (T/M), 0.73 (T/PZ) for Gleason 6 tumours. There was a difference in T2 T/M and T/PZ SIR between DCa and Gleason 9 (p = 0.003, p = 0.004) and Gleason 7/8 (p = 0.006, p = 0.002), but no difference in SIR between DCa and Gleason 6 tumours. The sensitivity for tumour detection was 0-27 % for DCa, 64-82 % for Gleason 9, 44-88 % for Gleason 7-8 and 0-20 % for Gleason 6. There was a difference in the sensitivity of detecting Gleason 9 and 7/8 tumours when compared to DCa (p = 0.004, p = 0.001).  Conclusions:   DCa resembles Gleason score 6 tumour at T2-weighted MRI, which underestimates tumour grade and renders the tumour occult.  Key points:   Prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma is aggressive, resembling endometrial carcinoma at histopathology. Prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma resembles Gleason score 6 tumour at T2-weighted MRI. MRI grading may underestimate ductal adenocarcinoma based on increased T2 signal.""","""['Nicola Schieda', 'Niamh Coffey', 'Previn Gulavita', 'Omran Al-Dandan', 'Wael Shabana', 'Trevor A Flood']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Multi-parametric (mp) MRI of prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Assessment of biologic aggressiveness of prostate cancer: correlation of MR signal intensity with Gleason grade after radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System versions 1 and 2 for the Detection of Peripheral Zone Gleason Score 3 + 4 = 7 Cancers.', 'Prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a mini review.', 'The impact of the 2005 international society of urological pathology consensus conference on standard Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma in needle biopsies.', 'Reliability of prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2.1 for excluding clinically significant prostate cancer using a 1.5 tesla scanner.', 'Landmarks in the evolution of prostate biopsy.', 'Pure ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate protruding into the prostatic urethra: A case report of MRI findings and literature review.', 'Evaluation of the T2-weighted (T2W) adrenal MRI calculator to differentiate adrenal pheochromocytoma from lipid-poor adrenal adenoma.', 'MRI Finding of Prostatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.']"""

The aim of this prospective study was to validate, through laparoscopic surgery, the accuracy of the isotopic sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique correlated with hyperextensive pelvic resection (extended pelvic lymphadenectomy dissection) in patients with localized PC, candidates for local curative treatment.  Methods:   A transrectal ultrasound-guided injection of (99m)Tc-sulfur rhenium colloid (0.3 mL/100 MBq) in each prostatic lobe was performed the day before surgery. Detection was performed intraoperatively with a laparoscopic probe, followed by extensive resection. SLN counts were performed in vivo and confirmed ex vivo. Histologic analysis was performed by hematoxylin-phloxine-safran staining, followed by immunohistochemistry if the SLN was free of metastasis.  Results:   Two hundred three patients with PC at intermediate or high risk of lymph node metastases were included. The intraoperative detection rate was 96% (195/203). Thirty-five patients had lymph node metastases, 19 only in the SLN. The false-negative rate was 8.5% (3/35). Unilateral surgical SLN detection did not validate bilateral pelvic lymph node status, and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy dissection was necessary on the opposite side of detection to minimize the false-negative rate (2.8% [1/35]). A significant metastatic sentinel invasion in the common iliac region existed (9.3%) but was always associated with other metastatic node areas. The internal iliac region was the primary metastatic site (40.7%). Finally, this series invalidated any justification for a standard or limited dissection, which would have missed 51.9% and 74.1% of lymph node metastases, respectively.  Conclusion:   The radioisotope SLN identification method up to the common iliac region is successful to identify sentinel nodes during laparoscopic surgery per hemipelvis to be acceptably considered as an isolated procedure and should be validated for intermediate- and high-risk patients.""","""['Caroline Rousseau', 'Thierry Rousseau', 'Loïc Campion', 'Jacques Lacoste', 'Geneviève Aillet', 'Eric Potiron', 'Marie Lacombe', 'Georges Le Coguic', 'Cédric Mathieu', 'Françoise Kraeber-Bodéré']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection for clinically localized prostate carcinoma: results obtained in the first 70 patients.', 'Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node (SLN) versus extensive pelvic dissection for clinically localized prostate carcinoma.', 'Laparoscopic radioisotope-guided sentinel lymph node dissection in staging of prostate cancer.', 'Advances in sentinel node dissection in prostate cancer from a technical perspective.', 'Sentinel node approach in prostate cancer.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Patients: Results From an Injection Technique Targeting the Index Lesion in the Prostate Gland.', 'Haute Couture or Ready-to-Wear?

Methods:   Urine samples were obtained from candidates of prostate biopsy (PB). Exclusion criteria were a history of urothelial carcinoma or other malignant disease, urine infection, fasting for <12 h before PB or ingestion of alcohol or foods that might alter the urine smell in the last 24 h. The initial part of the voided urine and the midstream were collected separately in two sterile containers. Both samples were analyzed by the EN immediately after the collection. All patients underwent a standard transperineal, transrectal-ultrasound-guided PB. The pathological results were compared with the outcomes of the EN. Sensitivity and specificity of EN were assessed.  Results:   Forty-one men were included in the study. Fourteen out of the 41 patients were positive for PCa. Midstream urine did not correlate significantly neither with a positive nor with a negative PB. Instead, significantly different results on the initial part of the urine stream between positive and negative PBs were obtained. The EN correctly recognized 10 out of the 14 cases (that is, sensitivity 71.4% (confidence interval (CI) 42-92%)) of PCa while four were false negatives. Moreover, the device recognized as negative 25 out of the 27 (that is, specificity 92.6% (CI 76-99%)) samples of negative PBs, with only two false positives.

However, the unique clinical features of prostate cancer have considerably limited the study of prostate CSCs from fresh human tumor samples. We recently reported the isolation of prostate CSCs directly from human tissues by virtue of their HLA class I (HLAI)-negative phenotype. Prostate cancer cells are harvested from surgical specimens and mechanically dissociated. A cell suspension is generated and labeled with fluorescently conjugated HLAI and stromal antibodies. Subpopulations of HLAI-negative cells are finally isolated using a flow cytometer.

Therefore, it would be beneficial to better predict which patients with early-stage prostate cancer would progress or recur after primary definitive treatment. In addition, many studies indicate that activation of NF-κB signaling correlates with prostate cancer progression; however, the precise underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Our studies show that activation of NF-κB signaling via deletion of one allele of its inhibitor, IκBα, did not induce prostatic tumorigenesis in our mouse model. However, activation of NF-κB signaling did increase the rate of tumor progression in the Hi-Myc mouse prostate cancer model when compared with Hi-Myc alone. Using the nonmalignant NF-κB-activated androgen-depleted mouse prostate, a NF-κB-activated recurrence predictor 21 (NARP21) gene signature was generated. The NARP21 signature successfully predicted disease-specific survival and distant metastases-free survival in patients with prostate cancer.

The objective of this study was to examine the long-term impact of sexual dysfunction on spouses or partners of prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   A total of 742 spouses of prostate cancer survivors was mailed surveys by the Michigan Public Health Institute, of which 379 were returned (51%). Nine surveys were excluded owing to study ineligibility. Spouses responding to the survey completed a combination of modified items from the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire and researcher-developed items.  Results:   Over 75% of spouses reported a decline in sex life quality after treatment. Communication about sexual issues between survivors and their health care providers was rated as good to excellent by 54.7% of partners, whereas 35.1% reported it as fair to poor. Approximately 60% of physicians initially recommended some form of sexual treatment. However, despite the persistence of sexual dysfunction, only 7% of the prostate cancer survivors were currently receiving treatment. Only 4.1% of health care providers referred the survivor to a sex therapist.  Conclusions:   Physicians need to understand the importance of the open, ongoing communication with prostate cancer survivors about sexual issues because sexual dysfunction seems to continue indefinitely after completion of treatment. Research on the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in restoring sexual health is critically needed for this population, especially as first-line sexual aids and medications are often not satisfactory solutions.""","""['Tammy Z Movsas', 'Raphael Yechieli', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'May Darwish-Yassine']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Life after prostate cancer treatment: a mixed methods study of the experiences of men with sexual dysfunction and their partners.', 'Prostate cancer patients and their partners: differences in satisfaction indices and psychological variables.', ""Sexual, psychological and dyadic qualities of the prostate cancer 'couple'."", 'Sexual rehabilitation and cancer survivorship: a state of art review of current literature and management strategies in male sexual dysfunction among prostate cancer survivors.', 'Predictors of Patient and Partner Satisfaction Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Marital status and perceived stress in men with advanced prostate cancer: A randomized-controlled trial of cognitive behavioral stress management.', 'Social Support and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Gay and Bisexual Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Non-pharmacological and non-surgical strategies to promote sexual recovery for men with erectile dysfunction.', 'Psychosocial perspectives on sexual recovery after prostate cancer treatment.']"""

We report the clinical manifestations, management, and prognostic characteristics in 17 Chinese patients.  Methods:   Medical records and biopsies of 17 patients who had been treated at a large university hospital in China between March 2005 and January 2012 were reviewed.  Results:   Of the 17 patients, 14 were men. They had lesions on the scrotum and the penis. Of the three women, two had vulvar and one had inguinal lesions. All patients underwent Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). Three men had metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes and underwent an extensive local excision with inguinal lymphadenectomy. Eight patients who had positive excision margins received additional radiation therapy. The mean follow-up duration was 54 months (4-85 months). One patient had two recurrences. Three had metastasis to the inguinal lymph node. One had metastasis to the bone and concomitant prostate cancer. Two patients died of the disease.  Conclusion:   A striking difference in presentation of EMPD in Chinese compared with Caucasians is the male predominance and location on the penis and scrotum. Mohs micrographic surgery followed by radiotherapy is an effective treatment.

Methods and materials:   Ten prostate datasets were selected. DILs were defined using T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Four plans were produced for each dataset: (1) no boost to DILs; (2) boost to DILs, no seminal vesicles in prescription; (3) boost to DILs, proximal seminal vesicles (proxSV) prescribed intermediate dose; and (4) boost to DILs, proxSV prescribed higher dose. The prostate planning target volume (PTV) prescription was 42.7 Gy in 7 fractions. DILs were initially prescribed 115% of the PTV(Prostate) prescription, and PTV(DIL) prescriptions were increased in 5% increments until organ-at-risk constraints were reached. TCP and NTCP calculations used the LQ-Poisson Marsden, and Lyman-Kutcher-Burman models respectively.  Results:   When treating the prostate alone, the median PTV(DIL) prescription was 125% (range: 110%-140%) of the PTV(Prostate) prescription. Median PTV(DIL) D50% was 55.1 Gy (range: 49.6-62.6 Gy). The same PTV(DIL) prescriptions and similar PTV(DIL) median doses were possible when including the proxSV within the prescription. TCP depended on prostate α/β ratio and was highest with an α/β ratio = 1.5 Gy, where the additional TCP benefit of DIL boosting was least. Rectal NTCP increased with DIL boosting and was considered unacceptably high in 5 cases, which, when replanned with an emphasis on reducing maximum dose to 0.5 cm(3) of rectum (Dmax(0.5cc)), as well as meeting existing constraints, resulted in considerable rectal NTCP reductions.  Conclusions:   Boosting DILs in the context of SABR is technically feasible but should be approached with caution. If this therapy is adopted, strict rectal constraints are required including Dmax(0.5cc). If the α/β ratio of prostate cancer is 1.5 Gy or less, then high TCP and low NTCP can be achieved by prescribing SABR to the whole prostate, without the need for DIL boosting.""","""['Louise J Murray', 'John Lilley', 'Christopher M Thompson', 'Vivian Cosgrove', 'Josh Mason', 'Jonathan Sykes', 'Kevin Franks', 'David Sebag-Montefiore', 'Ann M Henry']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['A planning study of focal dose escalations to multiparametric MRI-defined dominant intraprostatic lesions in prostate proton radiation therapy.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for primary prostate cancer with selective intraprostatic boost determined by 18F-choline PET/CT.', 'Effect on therapeutic ratio of planning a boosted radiotherapy dose to the dominant intraprostatic tumour lesion within the prostate based on multifunctional MR parameters.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices during prostate external-beam radiation therapy: A review.', 'RECENT ADVANCES IN RADIOTHERAPY MODALITIES FOR PROSTATE CANCER.', 'Radiotherapy planning in a prostate cancer phantom model with intraprostatic dominant lesions using stereotactic body radiotherapy with volumetric modulated arcs and a simultaneous integrated boost.', 'Visualizing the urethra by magnetic resonance imaging without usage of a catheter for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Voxel-level Classification of Prostate Cancer on Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Improving Accuracy Using Four-Compartment Restriction Spectrum Imaging.', 'Deformable MR-CBCT prostate registration using biomechanically constrained deep learning networks.', ""Detectability of fiducials' positions for real-time target tracking system equipping with a standard linac for multiple fiducial markers.""]"""

Methods and materials:   One pelvis phantom and 10 patients with prostate cancer treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy were studied. To minimize the effect of organ deformation and different Hounsfield unit values between planning CT (PCT) and CBCT, we modified CBCT (mCBCT) with DIR by using the MLT (mCBCT(MLT)) and HM (mCBCT(HM)) algorithms. To evaluate the accuracy of the dose calculation, we compared dose differences in dosimetric parameters (mean dose [D(mean)], minimum dose [D(min)], and maximum dose [D(max)]) for planning target volume, rectum, and bladder between PCT (reference) and CBCTs or mCBCTs. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of organ deformation compared with DIR and rigid registration (RR). We determined whether dose differences between PCT and mCBCTs were significantly lower than in CBCT by using Student t test.  Results:   For patients, the average dose differences in all dosimetric parameters of CBCT with DIR were smaller than those of CBCT with RR (eg, rectum; 0.54% for DIR vs 1.24% for RR). For the mCBCTs with DIR, the average dose differences in all dosimetric parameters were less than 1.0%.  Conclusions:   We evaluated the accuracy of the dose calculation in CBCT, mCBCT(MLT), and mCBCT(HM) with DIR for 10 patients. The results showed that dose differences in D(mean), D(min), and D(max) in mCBCTs were within 1%, which were significantly better than those in CBCT, especially for the rectum (P<.05).

Early lessons from the RAVES 0803 trial""","""Aims:   Maintaining clinical trial screening logs and reporting data from such logs are given importance due to the relevance of a trial's patient population to the generalisability of its findings. However, screening logs may not always reflect a clinical trial's true target population. The aim of the present study was to define and compare 'apparent recruitment' to a trial as captured in a clinical trial screening log with 'true recruitment', which considers all potentially eligible patients. The Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) 0803 RAVES clinical trial was used to examine the above.  Materials and methods:   A prospective, surgical database was interrogated for the 12 month period to identify patients potentially eligible for the TROG 0803 RAVES trial. Information on whether patients were referred to a RAVES trial recruitment site and reasons for non-referral were obtained.  Results:   Of 92 men undergoing radical prostatectomy, 28 met the RAVES clinical trial eligibility criteria. Fifteen of the 28 eligible men were assessed at a RAVES trial site, with five being ultimately recruited to RAVES (33% 'apparent recruitment fraction' as captured by the site's trial screening log). The 'true recruitment fraction' was 5/28 (18%).  Conclusion:   Screening logs at a recruiting trial site may underestimate the trial's target population and overestimate recruitment.

It blocks initiation and post-initiation progression of carcinogenesis. Mechanism study in human prostate cancer cells revealed that PEITC is a dual inhibitor of aberrant DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylases, reactivating silenced genes and regulating the androgen-mediated growth of tumor cells. The identity of the cellular organelle that initially interacts with PEITC has not been fully described.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer LNCaP cells were exposed to PEITC and the effects on cellular fine structure examined by transmission electron microscopic studies. Alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release were evaluated as early events of apoptosis, and the TUNEL method for quantifying apoptotic cells. Mitochondria were isolated for determining their protein expression.  Results:   Ultrastructural analyses have revealed condensed mitochondria and a perturbed mitochondrial cristae structure, which assumed a rounded and dilated shape within 4-hours of PEITC contact, and became more pronounced with longer PEITC exposure. They presented as the most prominent intracellular alterations in the early hours. Mitochondria structure alterations were demonstrated, for the first time, with the isothiocyanates. An increase in the number of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and vacuoles were also noted that is consistent with the presence of autophagy. Early events of apoptosis were detected, with cytochrome c released along with the appearance of mitochondrial alteration. Mitochondrial membrane potential was disrupted within 18 hours of PEITC exposure, preceding the appearance of apoptotic cells with DNA strand breaks. In parallel, the expression of the mitochondrial class III ß-tubulin in the outer membrane, which associates with the permeability transition pore, was significantly reduced as examined with isolated mitochondria.  Conclusion:   Mitochondria may represent the organelle target of the isothiocyanates, indicating that the isothiocyanates may be mitochondria-interacting agents to inhibit carcinogenesis.""","""['Chengsen Xue', 'Hilda A Pasolli', 'Irene Piscopo', 'Daniel J Gros', 'Christina Liu', 'Yamei Chen', 'Jen Wei Chiao']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Cell Int""","""['Epigenetic reactivation of RASSF1A by phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) and promotion of apoptosis in LNCaP cells.', 'Phenethyl isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells is mediated by reactive oxygen species-dependent disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential.', 'Atg5 regulates phenethyl isothiocyanate-induced autophagic and apoptotic cell death in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate cancer chemopreventive activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate through epigenetic regulation (review).', 'A principal mechanism for the cancer chemopreventive activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate is modulation of carcinogen metabolism.', 'Reviewing the Prospective Pharmacological Potential of Isothiocyanates in Fight against Female-Specific Cancers.', 'Effects of Supplementation of Brassica Juncea Seed Extract in Drinking Water on Intestinal Histomorphometry, Bacteriology, and Serum Biochemistry Parameters of Broiler Chicken.', 'MnSOD Lysine 68 acetylation leads to cisplatin and doxorubicin resistance due to aberrant mitochondrial metabolism.', 'Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Effects of Curcumin Analogue (2E,6E)-2,6-Bis(2,3-Dimethoxybenzylidine) Cyclohexanone (DMCH) on Human Colon Cancer Cells HT29 and SW620 In Vitro.', '6-(Methylsulfonyl) hexyl isothiocyanate as potential chemopreventive agent: molecular and cellular profile in leukaemia cell lines.']"""

Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify differences in physician characteristics for each outcome.  Results:   Survey response rates were similar for radiation oncologists and urologists (44% vs 46%; P=.46).

No such tables are available for locally advanced (cT3a) PCa.  Objective:   To construct tables predicting pathologic outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP) for patients with cT3a PCa with the aim to help guide treatment decisions in clinical practice.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study including 759 consecutive patients with cT3a PCa treated with RP between 1987 and 2010.  Intervention:   Retropubic RP and pelvic lymphadenectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients were divided into pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and biopsy Gleason score (GS) subgroups. These parameters were used to construct tables predicting pathologic outcome and the presence of positive lymph nodes (LNs) after RP for cT3a PCa using ordinal logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   In the model predicting pathologic outcome, the main effects of biopsy GS and pretreatment PSA were significant. A higher GS and/or higher PSA level was associated with a more unfavorable pathologic outcome. The validation procedure, using a repeated split-sample method, showed good predictive ability. Regression analysis also showed an increasing probability of positive LNs with increasing PSA levels and/or higher GS. Limitations of the study are the retrospective design and the long study period.  Conclusions:   These novel tables predict pathologic stage after RP for patients with cT3a PCa based on pretreatment PSA level and biopsy GS.

Here we report its interaction with the Notch pathway and its involvement in PC progression.  Methods:   Stable PTOV1 knockdown or overexpression were performed by lentiviral transduction. Protein interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation, pull-down and/or immunofluorescence. Endogenous gene expression was analyzed by real time RT-PCR and/or Western blotting. Exogenous promoter activities were studied by luciferase assays. Gene promoter interactions were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP). In vivo studies were performed in the Drosophila melanogaster wing, the SCID-Beige mouse model, and human prostate cancer tissues and metastasis. The Excel package was used for statistical analysis.  Results:   Knockdown of PTOV1 in prostate epithelial cells and HaCaT skin keratinocytes caused the upregulation, and overexpression of PTOV1 the downregulation, of the Notch target genes HEY1 and HES1, suggesting that PTOV1 counteracts Notch signaling. Under conditions of inactive Notch signaling, endogenous PTOV1 associated with the HEY1 and HES1 promoters, together with components of the Notch repressor complex. Conversely, expression of active Notch1 provoked the dismissal of PTOV1 from these promoters. The antagonist role of PTOV1 on Notch activity was corroborated in the Drosophila melanogaster wing, where human PTOV1 exacerbated Notch deletion mutant phenotypes and suppressed the effects of constitutively active Notch. PTOV1 was required for optimal in vitro invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth of PC-3 cells, activities counteracted by Notch, and for their efficient growth and metastatic spread in vivo. In prostate tumors, the overexpression of PTOV1 was associated with decreased expression of HEY1 and HES1, and this correlation was significant in metastatic lesions.  Conclusions:   High levels of the adaptor protein PTOV1 counteract the transcriptional activity of Notch. Our evidences link the pro-oncogenic and pro-metastatic effects of PTOV1 in prostate cancer to its inhibitory activity on Notch signaling and are supportive of a tumor suppressor role of Notch in prostate cancer progression.""","""['Lide Alaña', 'Marta Sesé', 'Verónica Cánovas', 'Yolanda Punyal', 'Yolanda Fernández', 'Ibane Abasolo', 'Inés de Torres', 'Cristina Ruiz', 'Lluís Espinosa', 'Anna Bigas', 'Santiago Ramón Y Cajal', 'Pedro L Fernández', 'Florenci Serras', 'Montserrat Corominas', 'Timothy M Thomson', 'Rosanna Paciucci']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Integrative genomic analyses on HES/HEY family: Notch-independent HES1, HES3 transcription in undifferentiated ES cells, and Notch-dependent HES1, HES5, HEY1, HEY2, HEYL transcription in fetal tissues, adult tissues, or cancer.', 'The role of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 in cancer progression.', 'Hypoxia potentiates Notch signaling in breast cancer leading to decreased E-cadherin expression and increased cell migration and invasion.', 'Notch signaling modulates hypoxia-induced neuroendocrine differentiation of human prostate cancer cells.', 'How the NOTCH pathway contributes to the ability of osteosarcoma cells to metastasize.', 'SGK2, 14-3-3, and HUWE1 Cooperate to Control the Localization, Stability, and Function of the Oncoprotein PTOV1.', 'Drosophila Accessory Gland: A Complementary In Vivo Model to Bring New Insight to Prostate Cancer.', 'PTOV1 promotes cisplatin-induced chemotherapy resistance by activating the nuclear factor kappa B pathway in ovarian cancer.', 'A Molecular Test for Quantifying Functional Notch Signaling Pathway Activity in Human Cancer.', 'High expression of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 (PTOV1) is a potential prognostic biomarker for cervical cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   The study included 523 patients with high-risk PCa, as defined by d'Amico classification, undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) and bilateral lymph node dissection in one of two academic centres between 1990 and 2013. Specimen-confined disease was defined as pT2-pT3a node-negative PCa with negative surgical margins. The receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained to quantify the overall accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) of the model in predicting specimen-confined disease. A calibration curve was then constructed to illustrate the relationship between the risk estimates obtained by the model (x-axis) and the observed proportion of specimen-confined disease (y-axis). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival.  Results:   Patients' median age and PSA level were 64 years and 21 ng/mL, respectively. The definition of high-risk PCa was based on PSA level only in 38.3%, a biopsy Gleason score >7 in 34.5%, a clinical stage >T2b in 6.9%, or a combination of these two or three factors in 20.3% of patients. Positive surgical margins were observed in 43.6%, with a rate of 14.8% in pT2 cancers and lymph node metastasis in 12.1% of patients. pT stage was pT0 in 0.9%, pT2 in 28.9%, pT3a in 37.5% and pT3b-4 in 32.7% of patients. Overall, 44.4% of patients (N = 232) had specimen-confined disease. PSA and cT stage were independently predictive of specimen-confined disease. The median (range) 2-, 5-, and 8-year BCR-free survival rates were significantly higher in specimen-confined disease as compared with non-specimen-confined disease: 80.87 (73.67-86.29) vs 37.55 (30.64-44.44)%, 63.53 (52.37-72.74) vs 26.93 (19.97-34.36)% and 55.08 (41.49-66.74) vs 19.52 (12.50-27.70)%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Of those, 155 patients with at least one repeat biopsy and no progression criteria at the time of the diagnosis were included for statistical analyses. Patients were followed every 3-6 months for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement and physical examination. Patients were offered repeat prostatic biopsy every year. Disease progression was defined as the presence of one or more of the following criteria: ≥ 3 positive cores, >50% of cancer in at least one core, and a predominant Gleason pattern of 4.  Results:   For the 155 patients, the mean (sd) age at diagnosis was 67(7) years; the median (interquartile range) follow-up was 5.4(3.6-9.5) years.

Extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) is a preferred staging tool; however, it may underestimate the incidence of nodal involvement.  Methods:   Eighty patients with estimated risk of lymphadenopathy above 5 % based on Briganti nomogram had Tc-99m-labeled nanocolloid injected into the prostate. Planar lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography/CT were performed to localize SLNs. Radioguided SLN dissection was followed by backup ePLND comprising external iliac, obturator and internal iliac regions. All SLNs were serially sectioned every 150 μm and examined using hematoxylin and eosin; immunohistochemical staining was applied every 300 μm.  Results:   A total of 335 SLNs were detected, and 17 % were located outside ePLND template. Nodal metastases were diagnosed in 32 patients (40 %). Without radioguided SLN localization, solitary metastases posteriorly to the branches of the internal ilaic vessels, in pararectal and common iliac regions would not have been removed in five of 32 patients (16 %).

Methods:   We evaluated the risk of developing second benign brain tumors among 2,038,074 1-year minimum cancer survivors compared to expected risk in the general population between 1973 and 2007 in nine population-based cancer registries in the NCI's surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program. Excess risk was estimated using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for all second benign brain tumors and specifically for second meningiomas and acoustic neuromas diagnosed during 2004-2008.  Results:   1,025 patients were diagnosed with a second primary benign brain tumor, of which second meningiomas composed the majority (n = 745). Statistically significant increases in risk of developing a second meningioma compared to the general population were observed following first cancers of the brain [SIR = 19.82; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 13.88-27.44], other central nervous system (CNS) (SIR = 9.54; CI 3.10-22.27), thyroid (SIR = 2.05; CI 1.47-2.79), prostate (SIR = 1.21; CI 1.02-1.43), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (SIR = 42.4; CI 23.18-71.13). Statistically significant decreases in risk were observed following first cancers of the uterine corpus (SIR = 0.63; CI 0.42-0.91) and colon (SIR = 0.56; CI 0.37-0.82). Differences in risk between patients initially treated with radiotherapy versus non-irradiated patients were statistically significant for second meningioma after primary cancers of the brain (p Het < 0.001) and ALL (p Het = 0.02).

With this goal in mind, we individually and collectively appraised common genetic polymorphisms related to estradiol metabolic pathways to find prostate cancer prognostic markers.  Methods:   The genetic profiles of 526 men with organ-confined prostate cancer were examined to find common genetic polymorphisms related to estradiol metabolic pathways and these findings were replicated in a cohort of 213 men with more advanced disease (follow-up time for both cohorts, >7.4 years). Specifically, we examined 71 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in SULT2A1, SULT2B1, CYP1B1, COMT, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A43, NQO1, and NQO2 and assessed the impact of the SNPs alone and in combination on prostate cancer progression and on circulating hormone levels.  Results:   According to a multivariate analysis, CYP1B1 (rs1800440), COMT (rs16982844), and SULT2B1 (rs12460535, rs2665582, rs10426628) were significantly associated with prostate cancer progression and hormone levels. Remarkably, by combining the SNP information with previously identified HSD17B2 markers, the patients could be stratified into four distinct prognostic subgroups. The most prominent association was observed for the eight-marker combination [CYP1B1 (rs1800440), SULT2B1 (rs12460535, rs2665582, and rs10426628), and HSD17B2 (rs4243229, rs1364287, rs2955162, and rs1119933)].  Conclusion:   This study identified specific germline variations in estradiol metabolism-related pathways, namely CYP1B1, SULT2B1, and HSD17B2, as novel prognostic markers that are cumulatively associated with increased risk of prostate cancer progression.

Design:   Population based cohort study.  Setting:   General male population of Sweden taking part in a screening trial in Gothenburg or participating in a cardiovascular study, the Malmö Preventive Project.  Participants:   The screened group consisted of 1756 men aged 57.5-62.5 participating in the screening arm of the Gothenburg randomized prostate cancer screening trial since 1995. The unscreened group consisted of 1162 men, born in 1921, participating in the Malmö Preventive Project, with PSA levels measured retrospectively in stored blood samples from 1981.  Intervention:   PSA screening versus no screening.  Main outcome measures:   Incidence rate ratios for the effect of screening on prostate cancer diagnosis, metastasis, and death by PSA levels at age 60.  Results:   The distribution of PSA levels was similar between the two cohorts. Differences in benefits by baseline PSA levels were large. Among men with baseline levels measured, 71.7% (1646/2295) had a PSA level <2 ng/mL. For men aged 60 with PSA level <2 ng/mL, there was an increase in incidence of 767 cases per 10,000 without a decrease in prostate cancer mortality. For men with PSA levels ≥ 2 ng/mL, the reduction in cancer mortality was large, with only 23 men needing to be screened and six diagnosed to avoid one prostate cancer death by 15 years.  Conclusions:   The ratio of benefits to harms of PSA screening varies noticeably with blood PSA levels at age 60. For men with a PSA level <1 ng/mL at age 60, no further screening is recommended. Continuing to screen men with PSA levels >2 ng/mL at age 60 is beneficial, with the number needed to screen and treat being extremely favourable. Screening men with a PSA level of 1-2 ng/mL is an individual decision to be based on a discussion between patient and doctor.""","""['Sigrid Carlsson', 'Melissa Assel', 'Daniel Sjoberg', 'David Ulmert', 'Jonas Hugosson', 'Hans Lilja', 'Andrew Vickers']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMJ""","""['PSA screening for prostate cancer.', 'A targeted approach reduces prostate cancer-specific (PSA) screening harms while preserving benefits.', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer Starting at Age 50-54 Years.

All-site cancer mortality increased with decreasing levels of education regardless of sex and country of birth (p for trend <0.001). We also compared cancer mortality rates among foreign-born (13.9%) and Sweden-born (86.1%) individuals and determined the effect of education level and sex estimated by mortality rate ratios (MRRs) using multivariable Poisson regression. All-site cancer mortality was slightly higher among foreign-born than Sweden-born men (MRR = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.07), but similar mortality risks was found among foreign-born and Sweden-born women. Men born in Angola, Laos, and Cambodia had the highest cancer mortality risk. Women born in all countries except Iceland, Denmark, and Mexico had a similar or smaller risk than women born in Sweden. Cancer-specific mortality analysis showed an increased risk for cervical and lung cancer in both sexes but a decreased risk for colon, breast, and prostate cancer mortality among foreign-born compared with Sweden-born individuals.

However, PSA can be used as a tool to risk assess disease progression in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic enlargement (LUTS/BPE). The aim of this study was to canvas the opinions of West of Scotland Urologists regarding the use of PSA in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.  Methods:   A questionnaire-based survey was sent to all the Consultants and Trainees in the West of Scotland.  Results:   Survey response rate was 45% (47/105). In patients <70 years, 93% would perform a PSA testing in patients symptomatic of LUTS/BPE, but only 17% would offer PSA screening to asymptomatic patients. In patients >70 years, only 48% of urologists would perform a PSA if patients were symptomatic and none would offer PSA screening. In terms of self-testing, 59% of urologists would have a PSA test if symptomatic and 31% of urologists would have PSA screening.

To test this hypothesis and develop novel potent GAEL analogs, we synthesized GAELS which contain D-galacto- and D-manno-configured 2-amino-2-deoxy sugar moieties (2-NH2-Gal or 2-NH2-Man) and investigated their cytotoxicity against human epithelial cancer cell lines and cancer stem cells derived from BT-474 breast cancer cells. Within the class of D-galacto-configured GAELs, we prepared both O- and S-glycosidic linkages as well as their corresponding α- and β-anomers and screened against breast (BT-474, JIMT-1 and BT-549), pancreas (MiaPaCa2) and prostate cancer (DU145, PC3) cancer cell lines. The α-anomeric 2-NH2-Gal-based lipid 1 was the most active of all the compounds tested with CC50 values of 4.4-8 μM and is the most active GAEL synthesized to date. The β-anomer 2 was 4->5-fold less active than 1. Replacement of the α-O-glycosidic by an α-S-glycosidic linkage resulted in a 2-4-fold reduction in activity, while the β-S-glycolipid 4 was inactive. In comparison, α-configured 2-NH2-Man-based glycerolipid 5 displayed very little activity with CC50 > 30 μM. The effect of the most active GAELs, 1, 6, or 7, on cancer stem cell viability revealed that all three inhibited the formation of tumorspheres from BT-474 cancer stem cell lines, caused the disintegration of preformed tumorspheres and resulted in total loss of cell viability of the cancer stem cells at concentrations of 20 μM. In contrast, the related antitumor ether lipid gold standard, edelfosine that is in clinical development was much less effective in preventing tumorsphere formation and affecting the viability of the cancer stem cells. Taken together our study demonstrates that α-GAEL anomers are more potent than their corresponding β-anomers and that the nature of the CHO moiety as well as the glycosidic bond significantly affects activity.

A group of genes that encode the cancer/testis or cancer germline antigens have been proposed as ideal targets for immunotherapy due to their high expression in multiple cancer types and their restricted expression in immunoprivileged normal tissues. In the present work we report the isolation and characterization of human T cell receptors (TCRs) with specificity for synovial sarcoma X breakpoint 2 (SSX2), a cancer/testis antigen expressed in melanoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancer, among other tumors. We isolated seven HLA-A2 restricted T cell receptors from natural T cell clones derived from tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes of two SSX2-seropositive melanoma patients, and selected four TCRs for cloning into retroviral vectors. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) transduced with three of four SSX2 TCRs showed SSX241-49 (KASEKIFYV) peptide specific reactivity, tumor cell recognition and tetramer binding. One of these, TCR-5, exhibited tetramer binding in both CD4 and CD8 cells and was selected for further studies. Antigen-specific and HLA-A*0201-restricted interferon-γ release, cell lysis and lymphocyte proliferation was observed following culture of TCR engineered human PBL with relevant tumor cell lines. Codon optimization was found to increase TCR-5 expression in transduced T cells, and this construct has been selected for development of clinical grade viral vector producing cells.

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a seminal role in prostate development and homeostasis, and dysregulation of this pathway is intimately linked to prostate cancer pathogenesis and progression. Here, we identify the cytosolic NLR-related protein NWD1 as a novel modulator of AR signaling. We determined that expression of NWD1 becomes elevated during prostate cancer progression, based on analysis of primary tumor specimens. Experiments with cultured cells showed that NWD1 expression is up-regulated by the sex-determining region Y (SRY) family proteins. Gene silencing procedures, in conjunction with transcriptional profiling, showed that NWD1 is required for expression of PDEF (prostate-derived Ets factor), which is known to bind and co-regulate AR. Of note, NWD1 modulates AR protein levels. Depleting NWD1 in PCa cell lines reduces AR levels and suppresses activity of androgen-driven reporter genes. NWD1 knockdown potently suppressed growth of androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells, thus showing its functional importance in an AR-dependent tumor cell model. Proteomic analysis suggested that NWD1 associates with various molecular chaperones commonly related to AR complexes.

Historically the function of uPAR in cancer cell invasion is strictly related to its property to promote uPA-dependent proteolysis of extracellular matrix and to open a path to malignant cells. These features are typical of mesenchymal motility. Here we show that the full-length form of uPAR is required when prostate and melanoma cancer cells convert their migration style from the ""path generating"" mesenchymal to the ""path finding"" amoeboid one, thus conferring a plasticity to tumor cell invasiveness across three-dimensional matrices. Indeed, in response to a protease inhibitors-rich milieu, prostate and melanoma cells activated an amoeboid invasion program connoted by retraction of cell protrusions, RhoA-mediated rounding of the cell body, formation of a cortical ring of actin and a reduction of Rac-1 activation. While the mesenchymal movement was reduced upon silencing of uPAR expression, the amoeboid one was almost completely abolished, in parallel with a deregulation of small Rho-GTPases activity. In melanoma and prostate cancer cells we have shown uPAR colocalization with β1/β3 integrins and actin cytoskeleton, as well integrins-actin co-localization under both mesenchymal and amoeboid conditions. Such co-localizations were lost upon treatment of cells with a peptide that inhibits uPAR-integrin interactions. Similarly to uPAR silencing, the peptide reduced mesenchymal invasion and almost abolished the amoeboid one. These results indicate that full-length uPAR bridges the mesenchymal and amoeboid style of movement by an inward-oriented activity based on its property to promote integrin-actin interactions and the following cytoskeleton assembly.""","""['Francesca Margheri', 'Cristina Luciani', 'Maria Letizia Taddei', 'Elisa Giannoni', 'Anna Laurenzana', 'Alessio Biagioni', 'Anastasia Chillà', 'Paola Chiarugi', 'Gabriella Fibbi', 'Mario Del Rosso']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Cell signaling by urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor induces stem cell-like properties in breast cancer cells.', 'RNA interference-directed knockdown of urokinase plasminogen activator and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor inhibits prostate cancer cell invasion, survival, and tumorigenicity in vivo.', 'Mature and progenitor endothelial cells perform angiogenesis also under protease inhibition: the amoeboid angiogenesis.', 'Mechanism of tumor cell-induced extracellular matrix degradation--inhibition of cell-surface proteolytic activity might have a therapeutic effect on tumor cell invasion and metastasis.', 'Role of urokinase receptor in tumor progression and development.', 'Therapeutic targeting of anoikis resistance in cutaneous melanoma metastasis.', 'Modulation of Cellular Function by the Urokinase Receptor Signalling: A Mechanistic View.', 'Roles of the Na+/H+ Exchanger Isoform 1 and Urokinase in Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion.', 'Molecular mechanism of albumin in suppressing invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The Urokinase Receptor: A Multifunctional Receptor in Cancer Cell Biology.

Fragile elderly patients may particularly benefit from noninvasive and well tolerable immunotherapeutic approaches. Preclinical studies have revealed that the immune-regulatory cytokine IL-27 may exert anti-tumor activities in a variety of tumor types without discernable toxicity. We, thus, investigated whether IL-27 may function as anti-tumor agent in human (h) PCa and analyzed the rationale for its clinical application. In vitro, IL-27 treatment significantly inhibited proliferation and reduced the angiogenic potential of hPCa cells by down-regulating the pro-angiogenesis-related genes fms-related tyrosine kinase (FLT)1, prostaglandin G/H synthase 1/cyclooxygenase-1 (PTGS1/COX-1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)3. In addition, IL-27 up-regulated the anti-angiogenesis-related genes such as CXCL10 and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 (TIMP3). In vivo, IL-27 reduced proliferation and vascularization in association with ischemic necrosis of tumors developed after PC3 or DU145 cell injection in athymic nude mice. In patients' prostate tissues, IL-27R was expressed by normal epithelia and low grade PCa and lost by high tumor grade and stages. Nevertheless, IL-27R was expressed by CD11c(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) leukocytes infiltrating the tumor and draining lymph nodes. These data lead to the conclusion that i) IL-27's anti-PCa potential may be fully exploited in patients with well-differentiated, localized IL-27R positive PCa, since in this case it may act on both cancerous epithelia and the tumor microenvironment; ii) PCa patients bearing high grade and stage tumor that lack IL-27R may benefit, however, from IL-27's immune-stimulatory properties.""","""['Emma Di Carlo', 'Carlo Sorrentino', 'Alessia Zorzoli', 'Serena Di Meo', 'Maria Grazia Tupone', 'Emanuela Ognio', 'Gabriella Mincione', 'Irma Airoldi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Interleukin-27 re-educates intratumoral myeloid cells and down-regulates stemness genes in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Targeting Interleukin(IL)-30/IL-27p28 signaling in cancer stem-like cells and host environment synergistically inhibits prostate cancer growth and improves survival.', 'CEP-7055: a novel, orally active pan inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases with potent antiangiogenic activity and antitumor efficacy in preclinical models.', 'Th17 cells inhibit CD8+ T cell migration by systematically downregulating CXCR3 expression via IL-17A/STAT3 in advanced-stage colorectal cancer patients.', 'The tumor innate immune microenvironment in prostate cancer: an overview of soluble factors and cellular effectors.', 'IL-27/IL-27RA signaling may modulate inflammation and progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia via suppressing the LPS/TLR4 pathway.', 'A Double-Edged Sword Role of Cytokines in Prostate Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Interleukin-30 feeds breast cancer stem cells via CXCL10 and IL23 autocrine loops and shapes immune contexture and host outcome.', 'IL-27 Mediates PD-L1 Expression and Release by Human Mesothelioma Cells.', 'Association between the serum concentrations and mutational status of IL-8, IL-27 and VEGF and the expression levels of the hERG potassium channel gene in patients with colorectal cancer.']"""

Marchantin M (Mar M) was identified through a screening process of these compounds as a potent anti-inflammatory agent based on its capacity to inhibit LPS-induced IL6, IL1β and CCL2 expression in HUVECs and PBMCs without affecting cell proliferation. Since Mar M has been found to exhibit anticancer activity, we observed that Mar M treatment also resulted in decreases in the expressions of IL6, IL1β and TNFα in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) cells. This effect was further confirmed in other cancer cell lines that express high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, inactivation of NF-κB, a critical transcription factor controlling many pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions, was observed in Mar M-treated PCa cells as evidenced by decreased phosphor-p65 and subsequently phosphor-STAT3. Mar M also suppressed phosphorylation of IKBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB in the cytosol.

Patients and methods:   Patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy for clinically localized disease from January to August 2012 were prospectively followed and those with available preoperative serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were included. Men with a known diagnosis of VitD deficiency or taking VitD supplementation were excluded. Cox regression analysis was performed to determine whether preoperative VitD level is predictive of adverse pathologic outcomes.  Results:   One hundred consecutive men were included. Mean age was 62 (range, 42-79) years and mean VitD level was 26 (range, 6-57) ng/mL. Overall, 65 men (65%) had suboptimal levels of VitD (< 30 ng/mL), and 32 (32%) had deficiency (< 20 ng/mL). There was no significant correlation between VitD and age (P = .5). In logistic regression analysis, VitD level was not predictive of pathologic Gleason (P = .11), pathologic stage (P = .7), or positive margin status (P = .8).  Conclusion:   The association between VitD and prostate cancer has been controversial and data suggesting an increased risk of aggressive cancer in men with low levels of VitD have been inconsistent. We found that baseline preoperative VitD level was not associated with any adverse pathologic features. However, VitD deficiency is a common finding in this population, although unrelated to patient age. These results represent the first time the correlation between VitD and prostate cancer has been evaluated in a cohort of men undergoing radical prostatectomy.""","""['William T Berg', 'Edan Y Shapiro', 'Michael B Rothberg', 'Ari Bergman', 'Kyle Scarberry', 'Chris Wambi', 'Trushar Patel', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Associations Between Serum Vitamin D and Adverse Pathology in Men Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative plasma levels of transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) strongly predict progression in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical and pathologic outcome after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer patients with a preoperative Gleason sum of 8 to 10.', 'Trends in vitamin D level and risk of vitamin D deficiency after gastrectomy for gastric cancer: A retrospective study of a single high-volume center experience.', 'Genetic Factors and Molecular Mechanisms of Vitamin D and Obesity Relationship.', 'Associations Between Serum Vitamin D and Adverse Pathology in Men Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Here, we propose to use model predictive control for scheduling intermittent androgen suppression.

Adipose-derived stromal cells (AdSCs) are known to exhibit extensive proliferation potential and can undergo multilineage differentiation, sharing similar characteristics to bone marrow-derived MSCs. However, as the effect of AdSCs on tumor growth has not been studied sufficiently, we assessed the degree to which AdSCs affect the proliferation of prostate cancer (PCa) cell. Human AdSCs exerted an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and androgen-nonresponsive (PC3) human PCa cells, while normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) did not, and in fact promoted PCa cell proliferation to a degree. Moreover, AdSCs induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells and PC3 cells, activating the caspase3/7 signaling pathway. cDNA microarray analysis suggested that AdSC-induced apoptosis in both LNCaP and PC3 cells was related to the TGF-β signaling pathway. Consistent with our in vitro observations, local transplantation of AdSCs delayed the growth of tumors derived from both LNCaP- and PC3-xenografts in immunodeficient mice. This is the first preclinical study to have directly demonstrated that AdSC-induced PCa cell apoptosis may occur via the TGF-β signaling pathway, irrespective of androgen-responsiveness. Since autologous AdSCs can be easily isolated from adipose tissue without any ethical concerns, we suggest that therapy with these cells could be a novel approach for patients with PCa.""","""['Kiyoshi Takahara', 'Masaaki Ii', 'Teruo Inamoto', 'Kazumasa Komura', 'Naokazu Ibuki', 'Koichiro Minami', 'Hirofumi Uehara', 'Hajime Hirano', 'Hayahito Nomi', 'Satoshi Kiyama', 'Michio Asahi', 'Haruhito Azuma']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Restoration of transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway in human prostate cancer cells suppresses tumorigenicity via induction of caspase-1-mediated apoptosis.', 'Characterization of in vitro cultured bone marrow and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells and their ability to express neurotrophic factors.', 'microRNA-145 Mediates the Inhibitory Effect of Adipose Tissue-Derived Stromal Cells on Prostate Cancer.', 'Effect of Breast Cancer and Adjuvant Therapy on Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells: Implications for the Role of ADSCs in Regenerative Strategies for Breast Reconstruction.', 'Biomedical application of low molecular weight heparin/protamine nano/micro particles as cell- and growth factor-carriers and coating matrix.', 'The Role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Exosomes in Tumor Development and Targeted Antitumor Therapies.', 'The Crosstalk Between Adipose-Derived Stem or Stromal Cells (ASC) and Cancer Cells and ASC-Mediated Effects on Cancer Formation and Progression-ASCs: Safety Hazard or Harmless Source of Tropism?', 'The Antitumor Activity of hAMSCs Secretome in HT-29 Colon Cancer Cells Through Downregulation of EGFR/c-Src/IRTKS Expression and p38/ERK1/2 Phosphorylation.', 'Impact of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells on dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans cells in an indirect co-culture: an in vitro study.', ""An In Vitro Comparison of Anti-Tumoral Potential of Wharton's Jelly and Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Exhibited by Cell Cycle Arrest in Glioma Cells (U87MG).""]"""

Results:   Original (Gleason score ≤6, PSA density ≤0.15, ≤2 positive cores, and maximum core involvement ≤50%) and modified Epstein criteria (Gleason score ≤6, PSA density ≤0.15, ≤2 positive cores, and unilateral cancer) had the highest negative predictive values-correct classification of insignificant cancer. Among cancers predicted to be insignificant in Caucasians, 29.9% cases using the original and 27% cases using the modified Epstein criteria had significant cancer at RP.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed PCa detection in 561 men who underwent first repeat SPBx after initial negative biopsy between March 2002 and April 2012. We divided the patients on the basis of the number of cores retrieved on initial biopsy (group 1, initial negative SPBx [n = 81] and group 2, initial negative extended prostate biopsy [n = 480]). The yield of repeat SPBx was compared between the 2 groups. Insignificant PCa and low-risk PCa were defined according to Epstein criteria and D'Amico risk criteria, respectively.  Results:   PCa detection on first repeat SPBx was 43.1% lower in group 1 (19.8% vs 34.8%; P = .008). Moreover, lower rate of significant PCa (31.3% vs 74.3%; P <.001) and intermediate- and/or high-risk PCa (25.0% vs 50.9%; P = .048) in group 1. Multivariate analysis confirmed that initial negative SPBx decreased PCa detection on first repeat SPBx (odds ratio = 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.78).  Conclusion:   Men whose initial biopsy was per transrectal saturation technique were less likely to have cancer identified during repeat biopsy. Furthermore, PCa diagnosed after negative initial SPBx was much more likely to be clinically insignificant.

Three prospectively randomized trials demonstrated an advantage for adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) compared with a wait-and-see (WS) policy.  Objective:   To determine the efficiency of ART after a 10-yr follow-up in the ARO 96-02 study.  Design, setting, and participants:   After RP, 388 patients with pT3 pN0 prostate cancer (PCa) were randomized to WS or three-dimensional conformal ART with 60 Gy. The present analysis focuses on intent-to-treat patients who achieved an undetectable prostate-specific antigen after RP (ITT2 population)--that is, 159 WS plus 148 ART men.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) (events: biochemical recurrence, clinical recurrence, or death). Outcomes were compared by log-rank test. Cox regression analysis served to identify variables influencing the course of disease.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 111 mo for ART and 113 mo for WS. At 10 yr, PFS was 56% for ART and 35% for WS (p<0.0001). In pT3b and R1 patients, the rates for WS even dropped to 28% and 27%, respectively. Of all 307 ITT2 patients, 15 died from PCa, and 28 died for other or unknown reasons. Neither metastasis-free survival nor overall survival was significantly improved by ART. However, the study was underpowered for these end points. The worst late sequelae in the ART cohort were one grade 3 and three grade 2 cases of bladder toxicity and two grade 2 cases of rectum toxicity. No grade 4 events occurred.  Conclusions:   Compared with WS, ART reduced the risk of (biochemical) progression with a hazard ratio of 0.51 in pT3 PCa. With only one grade 3 case of late toxicity, ART was safe.

Clinically meaningful differences in mean QOL scores were defined as those exceeding half the standard deviation of the baseline mean value. Changes from baseline were compared within groups at the first post-treatment follow-up (2-3 months from the start of treatment) and at 12 months and 24 months.  Results:   At the first post-treatment follow-up, patients who received 3DCRT and IMRT, but not those who received PBT, reported a clinically meaningful decrement in bowel QOL. At 12 months and 24 months, all 3 cohorts reported clinically meaningful decrements in bowel QOL. Patients who received IMRT reported clinically meaningful decrements in the domains of urinary irritation/obstruction and incontinence at the first post-treatment follow-up. At 12 months, patients who received PBT, but not those who received IMRT or 3DCRT, reported a clinically meaningful decrement in the urinary irritation/obstruction domain. At 24 months, none of the 3 cohorts reported clinically meaningful changes in urinary QOL.  Conclusions:   Patients who received 3DCRT, IMRT, or PBT reported distinct patterns of treatment-related QOL. Although the timing of toxicity varied between the cohorts, patients reported similar modest QOL decrements in the bowel domain and minimal QOL decrements in the urinary domains at 24 months. Prospective randomized trials are needed to further examine these differences.""","""['Alexander Gottschalk']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Patient-reported outcomes after 3-dimensional conformal, intensity-modulated, or proton beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Patient-reported outcomes after 3-dimensional conformal, intensity-modulated, or proton beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Comparing bowel and urinary domains of patient-reported quality of life at the end of and 3 months post radiotherapy between intensity-modulated radiotherapy and proton beam therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Radiotherapy Treatments for Head and Neck Cancer Update Internet.', 'Comparative toxicity outcomes of proton-beam therapy versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer in the postoperative setting.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Proton beam and prostate cancer: An evolving debate.', 'Comparative effectiveness study of patient-reported outcomes after proton therapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Proton beam therapy and localised prostate cancer: current status and controversies.']"""

Methods:   This randomised, phase 3, controlled trial recruited patients aged 75 years or younger with untreated cT0-3 prostate cancer (WHO performance status 0 or 1) from 37 institutions across Europe. Eligible patients were randomly assigned centrally (1:1) to postoperative irradiation (60 Gy of conventional irradiation to the surgical bed for 6 weeks) or to a wait-and-see policy until biochemical progression (increase in prostate-specific antigen>0·2 μg/L confirmed twice at least 2 weeks apart). We analysed the primary endpoint, biochemical progression-free survival, by intention to treat (two-sided test for difference at α = 0.05, adjusted for one interim analysis) and did exploratory analyses of heterogeneity of effect. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00002511.  Findings:   1005 patients were randomly assigned to a wait-and-see policy (n = 503) or postoperative irradiation (n = 502) and were followed up for a median of 10·6 years (range 2 months to 16·6 years). Postoperative irradiation significantly improved biochemical progression-free survival compared with the wait-and-see policy (198 [39·4%] of 502 patients in postoperative irradiation group vs 311 [61·8%] of 503 patients in wait-and-see group had biochemical or clinical progression or died; HR 0·49 [95% CI 0·41-0·59]; p<0·0001). Late adverse effects (any type of any grade) were more frequent in the postoperative irradiation group than in the wait-and-see group (10 year cumulative incidence 70·8% [66·6-75·0] vs 59·7% [55·3-64·1]; p = 0.001).  Interpretation:   Results at median follow-up of 10·6 years show that conventional postoperative irradiation significantly improves biochemical progression-free survival and local control compared with a wait-and-see policy, supporting results at 5 year follow-up; however, improvements in clinical progression-free survival were not maintained. Exploratory analyses suggest that postoperative irradiation might improve clinical progression-free survival in patients younger than 70 years and in those with positive surgical margins, but could have a detrimental effect in patients aged 70 years or older.

Material and methods:   In total, 852 men with advanced prostate cancer were enrolled to receive goserelin acetate for 24 weeks. Of these, 554 patients whose prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decreased to less than 10 ng/ml or by at least 50% (<20 ng/ml at baseline) were randomized to IAD or CAD. In the IAD arm, ADT was resumed for at least 24 weeks whenever PSA increased to greater than 20 ng/ml or above baseline.  Results:   Median follow-up time was 65 months. Median times from randomization to progression, death, prostate cancer death and treatment failure in M0 and M1 patients were 46.8 and 21.4, 57.6 and 40.3, 59.5 and 40.7, and 41.9 and 20.0 months, respectively (p < 0.001). No significant differences emerged between IAD and CAD. ADT showed a beneficial effect on pain, activity limitation and social functioning in M1 patients, and a deleterious effect on physical capacity in M0 patients and on sexual functioning in both groups. IAD offered extra benefit for activity limitation, social functioning and recovery of sexual functioning.

Methods:   The study sample consisted of 2205 consecutive patients selected for radical prostatectomy with a mean age of 64 years and a mean follow-up of 9.2 years (median: 8.6). Seventy-four patients with incomplete tumor-related data were excluded. In addition to age and tumor-related parameters, six comorbidity classifications and the body mass index were assessed as possible predictors of overall mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves and Mantel-Haenszel hazard ratios were used for univariate analysis. The impact of different causes of death was analyzed by competing risk analysis. Cox proportional hazard models were calculated to analyze combined effects of variables.  Results:   Age, Gleason score, tumor stage, Charlson score, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class and body mass index were identified a significant predictors of overall mortality in the multivariate analysis regardless whether two-sided and three-sided stratifications were used. Competing risk analysis revealed that the excess mortality in patients with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or higher was attributable to competing mortality including second cancers, but not to prostate cancer mortality.

However, there are two main challenges: (1) Large inter-subject prostate shape variations; (2) Inhomogeneous prostate appearance. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical prostate MR segmentation method, with the main contributions lying in the following aspects: First, the most salient features are learnt from atlases based on a subclass discriminant analysis (SDA) method, which aims to find a discriminant feature subspace by simultaneously maximizing the inter-class distance and minimizing the intra-class variations. The projected features, instead of only voxel-wise intensity, will be served as anatomical signature of each voxel. Second, based on the projected features, a new multi-atlases sparse label fusion framework is proposed to estimate the prostate likelihood of each voxel in the target image from the coarse level. Third, a domain-specific semi-supervised manifold regularization method is proposed to incorporate the most reliable patient-specific information identified by the prostate likelihood map to refine the segmentation result from the fine level. Our method is evaluated on a T2 weighted prostate MR image dataset consisting of 66 patients and compared with two state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves the highest segmentation accuracies than other methods under comparison.""","""['Shu Liao', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Yinghuan Shi', 'Ambereen Yousuf', 'Ibrahim Karademir', 'Aytekin Oto', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Inf Process Med Imaging""","""['Deformable segmentation of 3D MR prostate images via distributed discriminative dictionary and ensemble learning.', 'Automatic hippocampus segmentation of 7.0 Tesla MR images by combining multiple atlases and auto-context models.', '3D automatic segmentation and reconstruction of prostate on MR images.', 'A magnetic resonance spectroscopy driven initialization scheme for active shape model based prostate segmentation.', 'The Evidence for Using Artificial Intelligence to Enhance Prostate Cancer MR Imaging.', 'Fully automated multiorgan segmentation of female pelvic magnetic resonance images with coarse-to-fine convolutional neural network.', 'Automated Segmentation of Tissues Using CT and MRI: A Systematic Review.', 'SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING FOR PELVIC MR IMAGE SEGMENTATION BASED ON MULTI-TASK RESIDUAL FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS.', 'STRAINet: Spatially Varying sTochastic Residual AdversarIal Networks for MRI Pelvic Organ Segmentation.', 'Accuracy Validation of an Automated Method for Prostate Segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging.']"""

Immunotherapy for cancer was first started to be practised in the NIH and cell based immunotherapy for cancer is in practice for the past three decades. ([1, 2]) There are several literatures from various countries on the successful application of cell based Immunotherapies for various solid tumours and haematological malignancies. ([3-8]) Our team's association with immune cells started when I was working on RNA transcriptome analysis to understand the immune system in HIV carriers which in turn required in vitro expansion of human Natural Killer (NK) cells. ([9]) This led to the customization of protocols which has resulted in successful in vitro expansion, activation of NK cells and T cells for Immunotherapy. The purpose of Biotherapy institute of Japan (BIJ) is to support research and clinical application of immune cells like NK cells, γδT cells, αβT cells, Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and Dendritic cells (DC) for application as Autologous Immune Enhancement Therapy (AIET) to fight against cancer. AIET using NK cells, CTLs, DCs etc have been administered for more than 5000 patients since 2004 till date by BIJ.  Principle of aiet:   For AIET using NK cells, the process involves separation of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of the patient followed by selective NK cell expansion using the expansion kit (BINKIT, BIJ, JAPAN) without feeder layers and then infusion of the expanded-activated NK cells. ([10,11]) As reports suggest that the activity of peripheral blood NK cells are lower in cancer patients compared to normal individuals([12]) and as in vitro expansion of NK cells increases the cytotoxic ability 5 to 10 fold, ([13]) the NK cells are expanded in vivo and then infused to the patient in AIET. We are also working on combination immunotherapy using NK cells and CTLs and also NK cells and peptide pulsed DCs. The principle behind combining NK cells and CTLs is a dual advantage approach combining the innate immune system and adaptive immune system wherein the CTLs will kill the MHC expressing cancer cells while NK cells will kill the MHC non-expressing cancer cells also. ([10]) In case of NK cells and DCs, DCs will in turn activate the CTLs thereby giving rise to the dual advantage mentioned above. We have recently suggested that the AIET using expanded NK cells, particularly in combination with monoclonal antibody drugs, may be very useful tool for cancer immunotherapy. ([14].)  Our experience:   In our studies in NOG SCID mice, activated NK cells were shown to reduce the size of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231) ([15]) and the volume of ascites also inhibiting lung metastasis of pleural effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells. ([16]) In a primary lung adenocarcinoma patient where AIET was administered in combination with Hyperthermia, the CEA values decreased from 4.8 ng/ml to 1.6 ng/ml, the SLX decreased from 30 U/ml to 27 U/ml, the IAP reduced from 300 μg/ml to 221 μg/ml along with resolution of the lung lesions in four months. A 55 year old woman treated for invasive ductal carcinoma of breast presented with metastasis to the lungs. She was then treated with trastuzumab in combination with multiple injections of activated natural killer (NK) cells (at two week intervals) following which the tumor markers decreased. Progression free survival was 10 months. ([11]) Fifty-two patients with advanced cancers in organs like lung, breast, colon, prostate, liver, kidney, ovary etc, refractory to conventional therapy when treated with a combination of hyperthermia and NK cell-and CTL-based immune cell therapy with low-dose chemotherapy, in 18 of 52 patients, objective responses was observed including one complete response (CR) and 17 partial responses (PR) evaluated according to to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. Sixteen patients had stable disease (SD), whereas 18 had progressive disease (PD). Disease control rate was 66% including CR, PR and SD. After treatment for six months, the objective responses and disease control rate were 25% and 52%, respectively. There were no adverse effects in any of these patients. ([17].)  Conclusion:   Cancer has to be tackled with a multipronged approach and combining NK cell and CTL cell based AIET with conventional modalities of treatments such as Surgery, Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy as well as other modalities like Hyperthermia, Proton Beam therapy and low dose chemotherapy is effective even in advanced cancers which are refractory to conventional therapeutic modalities.""","""['H Terunuma']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Stem Cells Regen Med""","""['Autologous Immune Enhancement Therapy for cancer using NK cells and CTLs without feeder layers; our six year experience in India.', 'NK cell-based autologous immune enhancement therapy (AIET) for cancer.', 'Autologous immune enhancement therapy in recurrent ovarian cancer with metastases: a case report.', 'Natural killer-dendritic cell cross-talk in cancer immunotherapy.', 'CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer immunotherapy: A review.', 'Shuterin Enhances the Cytotoxicity of the Natural Killer Leukemia Cell Line KHYG-1 by Increasing the Expression Levels of Granzyme B and IFN-γ through the MAPK and Ras/Raf Signaling Pathways.', 'Evaluating the Safety and Quality of Life of Colorectal Cancer Patients Treated by Autologous Immune Enhancement Therapy (AIET) in Vinmec International Hospitals.', 'Phase I Clinical Trial Using Autologous Ex Vivo Expanded NK Cells and Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes for Cancer Treatment in Vietnam.', 'Metastatic and triple-negative breast cancer: challenges and treatment options.', 'Ex vivo expansion of human peripheral blood natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes from lung cancer patients.']"""

The antiandrogen flutamide is often used as part of the initial treatment of PC. Data on the effect of flutamide on and methylcholine incorporation into PC-3 cells are lacking in the experimental and literature work.  Objectives:   The aims of this study were to assess whether human PC-3 cells are susceptible to flutamide and whether the drug modulates the uptake of [methyl-(3)H]-choline into these cells.  Methods:   PC-3 cells were treated for 3 days with flutamide (≤100 nmol/L), inhibiting growth by 20% to 70% with control cells included. Two viability tests (cytotoxic analyses), the thiazole blue assay and the trypan blue exclusion method, were used to determine the median inhibitory concentration for flutamide (10 nmol/L). Control and flutamide-treated cells were incubated with [methyl-(3)H]-choline for 10 minutes and then in nonradioactive medium for 10 minutes to simulate the rapid blood clearance of [methyl-(11)C]-choline tracer that occurs within 5 to 20 minutes, and then extracted using organic and aqueous solvents to determine the intracellular distribution of the tracer. Protein assay and flow-cytometry analysis were used to determine protein content and DNA synthesis in both control and treated cells. The uptake of [methyl-(3)H]-choline was normalized to protein content and expressed as mean (SD) dpm/1Jg protein (n = 6).  Results:   PC-3 cell proliferation was inhibited with flutamide treatment. After treatment of PC-3 cells with flutamide 10 nmol/L for 3 days, cells accumulated DNA during the S phase. Mean (SD) [methyl-(3)H]-choline uptake was found to be significantly lower with flutamide 10-nmol/L-treated cells compared with control cells (65.95 [0.72] vs 114.21 [0.57] dpm/1Jg protein; P < 0.001); the difference between the 5-nmol/L-treated cells and controls was nonsignificant.  Conclusions:   In this pilot study, flutamide inhibited tumor cell growth and proliferation and decreased (modulated) the uptake of [methyl-(3)H]-choline into androgen receptor-negative PC-3 cells.

Here, we evaluated the potential of dual-modality imaging of prostate cancer with the monoclonal antibody D2B, directed against an extracellular domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). For these studies, D2B was labeled both with (111)In and with the NIRF dye IRDye800CW.  Methods:   D2B was conjugated with N-hydroxysuccinimide-IRDye800CW and p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (ITC-DTPA) and subsequently radiolabeled with (111)In. For biodistribution and NIRF imaging, (111)In-DTPA-D2B-IRDye800CW (2 μg, 0.55 MBq/mouse) was injected intravenously into BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous PSMA-expressing LNCaP tumors (right flank) and PSMA-negative PC3 tumors (left flank). The biodistribution was determined at 1, 2, 3, and 7 d after injection. In addition, micro-SPECT/CT and NIRF imaging with (111)In-DTPA-D2B-IRDye800CW (3 μg, 8.5 MBq/mouse) was performed on mice with intraperitoneally growing LS174T-PSMA tumors.  Results:   (111)In-DTPA-D2B-IRDye800CW specifically accumulated in subcutaneous PSMA-positive LNCaP tumors (45.8 ± 8.0 percentage injected dose per gram at 168 h after injection), whereas uptake in subcutaneous PSMA-negative PC3 tumors was significantly lower (6.6 ± 1.3 percentage injected dose per gram at 168 h after injection). Intraperitoneal LS174T-PSMA tumors could be visualized specifically with both micro-SPECT/CT and NIRF imaging at 2 d after injection, and the feasibility of image-guided resection of intraperitoneal tumors was demonstrated in this model.  Conclusion:   Dual-labeled (111)In-DTPA-D2B-IRDye800CW enables specific and sensitive detection of prostate cancer lesions in vivo with micro-SPECT/CT and NIRF imaging. In addition to preoperative micro-SPECT/CT imaging to detect tumors, NIRF imaging enables image-guided surgical resection.

Binding characteristics were evaluated through ELISA and flow cytometry. Selected nanobodies were radiolabeled with (99m) Tc at their hexahistidine tail, after which cell binding capacity and internalization were evaluated on PSMA(pos) LNCaP and PSMA(neg) PC3 cell lines. In vivo tumor targeting was analyzed in both LNCaP and PC3 xenografted mice through SPECT/microCT and tissue sampling. A panel of 72 generated clones scored positive on ELISA, all contributing to three nanobody groups, of which group 3 dominated with 70 clones. ELISA and FACS analysis led to the selection of two dominant nanobodies. (99m) Tc-labeled PSMA6 and PSMA30 both showed specific binding on LNCAP cells, but not on PC3 cells. (99m) Tc-PSMA30 internalized significantly more in LNCaP cells compared to (99m) Tc-PSMA6. Higher absolute tumor uptake and tumor-to-normal organ ratios were observed for (99m) Tc-PSMA30 compared with (99m) Tc-PSMA6 and a (99m) Tc-control nanobody in LNCaP but not in PC3 tumor-bearing mice.

However, some data suggest that standard methods of assessing depression in males via the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) may omit several extra key symptoms of male depression. Therefore, this study tested the comparative effects of standard MDD-based diagnostic criteria for depression and criteria for 'male depression' in a sample of men diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Method:   191 men diagnosed with prostate cancer completed a postal survey questionnaire containing questions about background variables, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression (PHQ9) and the Gotland Male Depression Scale (GMDS). Comparisons were made of the relative prevalence of depression according to these scales, plus a scale that combined the PHQ9 and GMDS extra items for male depression  Results:   Although there were significant correlations between total PHQ9 and GMDS scores, over one-third of variance in the GMDS was not accounted for by the PHQ9, and sensitivity of the PHQ9 against the GMDS showed that about 24% of those patients identified as depressed on the GMDS would not be similarly identified on the PHQ9. Different prevalence rates from the two scales suggested that they were assessing different sets of symptoms of depression. A combined PHQ9-GMDS scale of 15 items was used to produce a profile of male depression in these patients.  Conclusion:   Adequate and reliable assessment of depression in men diagnosed with prostate cancer may require use of additional symptoms to those listed for MDD, and treatment planning and delivery could be more precise and effective using this methodology.""","""['Christopher F Sharpley', 'Vicki Bitsika', 'David R H Christie']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Do prostate cancer patients suffer more from depressed mood or anhedonia?', 'Are somatic symptoms a legitimate part of the depression profile in prostate cancer patients?', 'Validity of Gotland Male Depression Scale for male depression in a community study: the Sudurnesjamenn study.', 'Interventions that may reduce depressive symptoms among prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in cancer patients: a review.', 'Gender Differences in Coping, Depression, and Anxiety in Patients with Non-Metastatic Lung Cancer.', 'Gender Differences in Psychosocial, Religious, and Spiritual Aspects in Coping: A Cross-Sectional Study with Cancer Patients.', 'A Hypothesis of Gender Differences in Self-Reporting Symptom of Depression: Implications to Solve Under-Diagnosis and Under-Treatment of Depression in Males.', 'Deterioration in Sleep Quality Affects Cognitive Depression in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Depression and prostate cancer: implications for urologists and oncologists.']"""

Studies of prostate cancer cells and stromal cells from both prostate and bone, the major site for prostate cancer metastasis, showed that cancer cells and a subset of stromal cells increased production of perlecan in response to cytokines present in the tumor microenvironment. In silico analysis of the HSPG2 promoter revealed two conserved NFκB binding sites, in addition to the previously reported SMAD3 binding sites. By systematically transfecting cells with a variety of reporter constructs including sequences up to 2.6 kb from the start site of transcription, we identified an active cis element in the distal region of the HSPG2 promoter, and showed that it functions in regulating transcription of HSPG2. Treatment with TNF-α and/or TGFβ1 identified TNF-α as a major cytokine regulator of perlecan production. TNF-α treatment also triggered p65 nuclear translocation and binding to the HSPG2 regulatory region in stromal cells and cancer cells. In addition to stromal induction of perlecan production in the prostate, we identified a matrix-secreting bone marrow stromal cell type that may represent the source for increases in perlecan in the metastatic bone marrow environment. These studies implicate perlecan in cytokine-mediated, innate tissue responses to cancer cell invasion, a process we suggest reflects a modified wound healing tissue response co-opted by prostate cancer cells.""","""['Curtis R Warren', 'Brian J Grindel', 'Lewis Francis', 'Daniel D Carson', 'Mary C Farach-Carson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Erratum: Transcriptional Activation by NFκB Increases Perlecan/HSPG2 Expression in the Desmoplastic Prostate Tumor Microenvironment.

Effective control programs require adequate information on the size, nature, and evolution of the health problem that they pose.  Methods:   We present estimates of the incidence and mortality of cancer in Africa in 2012, derived from ""GLOBOCAN 2012,"" published by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  Results:   There were 847,000 new cancer cases (6% of the world total) and 591,000 deaths (7.2% of the world total) in the 54 countries of Africa in 2012, with about three quarters in the 47 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. While the cancer profiles often differ markedly between regions, the most common cancers in men were prostate (16.4% of new cancers), liver (10.7%), and Kaposi sarcoma (6.7%); in women, by far the most important are cancers of the breast (27.6% of all cancers) and cervix uteri (20.4%).  Conclusions:   There are still deficiencies in surveillance systems, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and, specifically, of their most vital component, population-based cancer registries. With the number of annual cancer cases and deaths likely to increase by at least 70% by 2030, there is a pressing need for a coordinated approach to improving the extent and quality of services for cancer control in Africa, and better surveillance systems with which they can be planned and monitored.

Until now, there are neither data on the approach of German GP-IS in practicing this nor have data been classified in the context of available international literature on this topic.  Materials and methods:   Between May and December 2012, a questionnaire containing 16 items was sent to 600 GP-IS in Brandenburg and Berlin. The response rate was 65% (392/600). Six indicator questions (IQ1-6) were selected and results were set in the context of available international data. The quality of present studies was evaluated by the Harden criteria.  Results:   Of the 392 responding physicians, 317 (81%) declared that they would use PSA testing for early detection of PCA (IQ1) and, thus, formed the study group. Of these GP-IS, 38% consider an age between 41 and 50 years as suitable for testing begin (IQ2), while 53% and 14% of the GP-IS perform early detection until the age of 80 and 90 years, respectively (IQ3). A rigid PSA cut-off of 4 ng/ml is considered to be reasonable by 47% of the involved GP-IS, whereas 16% prefer an age-adjusted PSA cut-off (IQ4). Patients with pathological PSA levels were immediately referred to a board-certified urologist by 69% of the GP-IS. On the other hand, 10% first would independently control elevated PSA levels themselves after 3-12 months (IQ5). Furthermore, 14% of the interviewed physicians consider a decrease of PCA-specific mortality by PSA screening as being proven (IQ6). Knowledge regarding PCA diagnostics is mainly based on continuous medical education for GP-IS (33%), personal contact with urologists (6%), and guideline studies (4%). While 53% indicated more than one education source, 4% did not obtain any PCA-specific training. The results provided by this questionnaire evaluating response of German GP-IS to six selected indicator questions fit well into the international context; however, further studies with sufficient methodical quality are required.  Conclusions:   Despite current findings and controversial recommendations of the two large PCA screening studies on this issue, German GP-IS still frequently use PCA screening by PSA measurement. Primary strategies of early detection as well as follow-up after assessment of pathologically elevated PSA levels poorly follow international recommendations.

Here we show that doxorubicin induces the firing of dense clusters of neoreplication origins that lead to clusters of stalled replication forks in gene-rich parts of the genome, particularly on expressed genes. Genes that overlap with these clusters of stalled forks are actively dechromatinized, unwound, and repressed by an ATR-dependent checkpoint pathway. The ATR checkpoint pathway causes a histone chaperone normally associated with the replication fork, ASF1a, to degrade through a CRL1(βTRCP)-dependent ubiquitination/proteasome pathway, leading to the localized dechromatinization and gene repression. Therefore, a globally active checkpoint pathway interacts with local clusters of stalled forks to specifically repress genes in the vicinity of the stalled forks, providing a new mechanism of action of chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin. Finally, ASF1a-depleted cancer cells are more sensitive to doxorubicin, suggesting that the 7%-10% of prostate adenocarcinomas and adenoid cystic carcinomas reported to have homozygous deletion or significant underexpression of ASF1a should be tested for high sensitivity to doxorubicin.""","""['Jun-Sub Im', 'Mignon Keaton', 'Kyung Yong Lee', 'Pankaj Kumar', 'Jonghoon Park', 'Anindya Dutta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Genes Dev""","""['TopBP1 and DNA polymerase alpha-mediated recruitment of the 9-1-1 complex to stalled replication forks: implications for a replication restart-based mechanism for ATR checkpoint activation.', 'Human DDK rescues stalled forks and counteracts checkpoint inhibition at unfired origins to complete DNA replication.', 'ASF1a Promotes Non-homologous End Joining Repair by Facilitating Phosphorylation of MDC1 by ATM at Double-Strand Breaks.', 'ATR kinase inhibition induces unscheduled origin firing through a Cdc7-dependent association between GINS and And-1.', 'The ATR pathway: fine-tuning the fork.', 'Dynamic switching of crotonylation to ubiquitination of H2A at lysine 119 attenuates transcription-replication conflicts caused by replication stress.', 'Walking a tightrope: The complex balancing act of R-loops in genome stability.', 'Epigenetics in prostate cancer treatment.', 'A regulatory phosphorylation site on Mec1 controls chromatin occupancy of RNA polymerases during replication stress.', 'Transcription-Replication Collisions-A Series of Unfortunate Events.']"""

In order to overcome this problem and for proof of concept we incorporated a novel unique peptide sequence of ten amino acids as epitope (E-Tag) into the binding domains of two novel chimeric antigen receptors (ECARs) directed against either prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) or CD33 for the treatment of acute myeloide leukemia (AML). The epitope tag then was utilized for expanding ECAR engrafted T cells by triggering the modified T cells via a monoclonal antibody directed against the E-Tag (Emab). Moreover, the E-Tag served as an efficient selection epitope for immunomagnetic isolation of modified T cells to high purity. ECAR engrafted T cells were fully functional and mediated profound anti-tumor effects in the respective models of PCa or AML both in vitro and in vivo.

We propose a pattern recognition system with an incremental learning ensemble algorithm using support vector machines (SVM) tackling this problem employing multimodal MR images and a texture-based information strategy. The proposed system integrates anatomic, texture, and functional features. The data set was preprocessed using B-Spline interpolation, bias field correction and intensity standardization. First- and second-order angular independent statistical approaches and rotation invariant local phase quantization (RI-LPQ) were utilized to quantify texture information. An incremental learning ensemble SVM was implemented to suit working conditions in medical applications and to improve effectiveness and robustness of the system. The probability estimation of cancer structures was calculated using SVM and the corresponding optimization was carried out with a heuristic method together with a 3-fold cross-validation methodology. We achieved an average sensitivity of 0.844 ± 0.068 and a specificity of 0.780 ± 0.038, which yielded superior or similar performance to current state of the art using a total database of only 41 slices from twelve patients with histological confirmed information, including cancerous, unhealthy non-cancerous and healthy prostate tissue. Our results show the feasibility of an ensemble SVM being able to learn additional information from new data while preserving previously acquired knowledge and preventing unlearning. The use of texture descriptors provides more salient discriminative patterns than the functional information used. Furthermore, the system improves selection of information, efficiency and robustness of the classification. The generated probability map enables radiologists to have a lower variability in diagnosis, decrease false negative rates and reduce the time to recognize and delineate structures in the prostate.""","""['José Fernando García Molina', 'Lei Zheng', 'Metin Sertdemir', 'Dietmar J Dinter', 'Stefan Schönberg', 'Matthias Rädle']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Kernel-based learning from both qualitative and quantitative labels: application to prostate cancer diagnosis based on multiparametric MR imaging.', 'Absolute cosine-based SVM-RFE feature selection method for prostate histopathological grading.', 'Classification of incidental carcinoma of the prostate using learning vector quantization and support vector machines.', 'Automated detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution ex vivo MRI.', 'Histological classification of prostatic cancer.', 'Cluster Analysis of Cell Nuclei in H&E-Stained Histological Sections of Prostate Cancer and Classification Based on Traditional and Modern Artificial Intelligence Techniques.', 'Incremental Learning in Modelling Process Analysis Technology (PAT)-An Important Tool in the Measuring and Control Circuit on the Way to the Smart Factory.', 'CT-Based Quantitative Analysis for Pathological Features Associated With Postoperative Recurrence and Potential Application Upon Artificial Intelligence: A Narrative Review With a Focus on Chronic Subdural Hematomas.', 'Radiomic features for prostate cancer detection on MRI differ between the transition and peripheral zones: Preliminary findings from a multi-institutional study.', 'Computer-aided Detection of Prostate Cancer with MRI: Technology and Applications.']"""

Plant-derived phenolic compounds attenuate prostate cancer growth in preclinical models by several mechanisms, which is in line with epidemiological findings suggesting that consumption of plant-based diets is associated with low risk of prostate cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of a novel lignan-stilbenoid mixture in PC-3M-luc2 human prostate cancer cells in vitro and in orthotopic xenografts. Lignan and stilbenoid -rich extract was obtained from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) knots. Pine knot extract as well as stilbenoids (methyl pinosylvin and pinosylvin), and lignans (matairesinol and nortrachelogenin) present in pine knot extract showed antiproliferative and proapoptotic efficacy at ≥ 40 μM concentration in vitro. Furthermore, pine knot extract derived stilbenoids enhanced tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induced apoptosis already at ≥ 10 μM concentrations. In orthotopic PC-3M-luc2 xenograft bearing immunocompromized mice, three-week peroral exposure to pine knot extract (52 mg of lignans and stilbenoids per kg of body weight) was well tolerated and showed anti-tumorigenic efficacy, demonstrated by multivariate analysis combining essential markers of tumor growth (i.e. tumor volume, vascularization, and cell proliferation). Methyl pinosylvin, pinosylvin, matairesinol, nortrachelogenin, as well as resveratrol, a metabolite of pinosylvin, were detected in serum at total concentration of 7-73 μM, confirming the bioavailability of pine knot extract derived lignans and stilbenoids. In summary, our data indicates that pine knot extract is a novel and cost-effective source of resveratrol, methyl pinosylvin and other bioactive lignans and stilbenoids. Pine knot extract shows anticarcinogenic efficacy in preclinical prostate cancer model, and our in vitro data suggests that compounds derived from the extract may have potential as novel chemosensitizers to TRAIL.

However, the effectiveness of these therapies is limited, thus necessitating the development of alternative approaches. The present study focused on analyzing the role of pterostilbene (PTER)-isothiocyanate (ITC) conjugate--a novel class of hybrid compound synthesized by appending an ITC moiety on PTER backbone--in regulating the functions of androgen receptor (AR), thereby causing apoptosis of PCa cells. The conjugate molecule caused 50% growth inhibition (IC50) at 40 ± 1.12 and 45 ± 1.50 μM in AR positive (LNCaP) and negative (PC-3) cells, respectively. The reduced proliferation of PC-3 as well as LNCaP cells by conjugate correlated with accumulation of cells in G2/M phase and induction of caspase dependent apoptosis. Both PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways played an important and differential role in conjugate-induced apoptosis of these PCa cells. While the inhibitor of Akt (A6730) or Akt-specific small interference RNA (siRNA) greatly sensitized PC-3 cells to conjugate-induced apoptosis, on the contrary, apoptosis was accelerated by inhibition of ERK (by PD98059 or ERK siRNA) in case of LNCaP cells, both ultimately culminating in the expression of cleaved caspase-3 protein. Moreover, anti-androgenic activity of the conjugate was mediated by decreased expression of AR and its co-activators (SRC-1, GRIP-1), thus interfering in their interactions with AR. All these data suggests that conjugate-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis are partly mediated by the down regulation of AR, Akt, and ERK signaling. These observations provide a rationale for devising novel therapeutic approaches for treating PCa by using conjugate alone or in combination with other therapeutics.""","""['Kumar Nikhil', 'Shruti Sharan', 'Ajanta Chakraborty', 'Partha Roy']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Role of isothiocyanate conjugate of pterostilbene on the inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation and tumor growth in Ehrlich ascitic cell induced tumor bearing mice.', 'Targeting the Vav3 oncogene enhances docetaxel-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of androgen receptor phosphorylation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells under chronic hypoxia.', 'Brassinin induces apoptosis in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells through the suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6K1 signaling cascades.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'The role of cyclins in the development and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Pterostilbene-isothiocyanate reduces miR-21 level by impeding Dicer-mediated processing of pre-miR-21 in 5-fluorouracil and tamoxifen-resistant human breast cancer cell lines.', 'Involvement of Cdkal1 in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus and microvascular diabetic complications: a review.', 'Suppressive Effect and Molecular Mechanism of Houttuynia cordata Thunb.

Lysosomes are vulnerable organelles to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-induced injuries, with the potential to initiate and or facilitate apoptosis subsequent to release of proteases such as cathepsin D (CD) into the cytosol. We therefore hypothesized that camalexin reduces cell viability in PCa cells via alterations in expression and activity of CD. Cell viability was evaluated by MTS cell proliferation assay in LNCaP and ARCaP Epithelial (E) cells, and their respective aggressive sublines C4-2 and ARCaP Mesenchymal (M) cells, whereby the more aggressive PCa cells (C4-2 and ARCaPM) displayed greater sensitivity to camalexin treatments than the lesser aggressive cells (LNCaP and ARCaPE). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed CD relocalization from the lysosome to the cytosol subsequent to camalexin treatments, which was associated with increased protein expression of mature CD; p53, a transcriptional activator of CD; BAX, a downstream effector of CD, and cleaved PARP, a hallmark for apoptosis.

Materials and methods:   A total of 1,669 men with a median age of 66 years who had T1-T3 prostate cancer were treated with prostate brachytherapy and followed a mean of 10 years. Treatments were implant alone, implant plus hormone therapy, or external beam irradiation or implant plus hormone therapy plus external beam irradiation. Hormone therapy was administered in 898 men (53.8%) for a median of 6 months. Cause specific and all-cause survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method with comparisons made by logistic regression and Cox proportions hazard rates.  Results:   The 15-year cause specific survival rate was 94.1%. Cause specific survival in the 3 NCCN® risk groups was 96.3%, 97.5% and 85.2% (p <0.001). Hormone therapy did not positively impact cause specific survival. The 15-year all-cause survival rate was 57%. Cox regression revealed age (HR 1.09, p <0.001), hormone therapy (HR 1.04, p = 0.032), diabetes (HR 1.86, p = 0.013), atrial fibrillation (HR 2.90, p = 0.041), smoking (HR 1.42, p = 0.030) and emphysema (HR 8.20, p = 0.040) as significant associations. At 15 years hormone therapy decreased all-cause survival from 60.3% to 54.9% (p = 0.009). All-cause survival was not reduced when hormone therapy was limited to 6 months or less (p = 0.005). This difference was present in men 66 years old or younger (p = 0.017) and in older men (p = 0.05).  Conclusions:   Prostate brachytherapy yields favorable 15-year cause specific survival, especially in patients at high risk.

Herein we report that prostate cancer (PC) cell microenvironment subverts PC patient adipose-derived stem cells (pASCs) to undergo neoplastic transformation. Unlike normal ASCs, the pASCs primed with PC cell conditioned media (CM) formed prostate-like neoplastic lesions in vivo and reproduced aggressive tumors in secondary recipients. The pASC tumors acquired cytogenetic aberrations and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and expressed epithelial, neoplastic, and vasculogenic markers reminiscent of molecular features of PC tumor xenografts. Our mechanistic studies revealed that PC cell-derived exosomes are sufficient to recapitulate formation of prostate tumorigenic mimicry generated by CM-primed pASCs in vivo. In addition to downregulation of the large tumor suppressor homolog2 and the programmed cell death protein 4, a neoplastic transformation inhibitor, the tumorigenic reprogramming of pASCs was associated with trafficking by PC cell-derived exosomes of oncogenic factors, including H-ras and K-ras transcripts, oncomiRNAs miR-125b, miR-130b, and miR-155 as well as the Ras superfamily of GTPases Rab1a, Rab1b, and Rab11a.

This study investigated the effects of family history of PCa on psychosocial distress and perceived psychosocial treatment need. Data were gathered within the German national research project ""Familial Prostate Cancer"". 4.123 PCa survivors who had undergone prostatectomy at least 4 years ago received a questionnaire set. 3.623 of the respondents [68.3 % sporadic, sporadic prostate cancer (SPCa); 31.7 % familial, familial prosate cancer (FPCa)] filled in measures of cancer-specific distress (QSC-R10), depression (PHQ-2), and anxiety (GAD-2). Perceived psychosocial treatment need was assessed using a single item. The prevalence of psychosocial distress did not differ between SPCa and FPCa survivors (cancer-specific distress: 16.2 vs. 16.7 %; depression: 5.8 vs. 6.4 %; anxiety: 6.6 vs. 5.8 %; ps ≥ .397). Similarly, psychosocial treatment need did not differ between SPCa (11.8 %) and FPCa (13.1 %) cases (p = .303). However, family history moderated the effect of cancer-specific distress on treatment need (OR 2.67, 95 % CI 1.43-4.96, p = .002). Exploratory analyses for the hereditary subtype (HPCa) revealed that cancer-specific distress was lower in HPCa survivors who had only daughters compared to survivors without any children or with at least one son. No such effect was observed in SPCa survivors (p = .040). PCa survivors with a positive family history do not experience increased psychosocial distress.

However the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon still need to be elucidated. Aim of this study is to dissect molecular mechanisms regulating the radiosensitizing properties of P529 in a wide panel of prostate cancer models.  Methods:   Six tumor cell lines and xenograft models were used for in vitro and in vivo studies. Clonogenic survival, apoptotic, autophagic, and senescence assays were used to examine the effects of ionizing radiation (IR) alone and in combination with P529. CRM1, survivin, GSK-3β, and DNA-DSBs expression and modulation, upon P529 and RT, were monitored by western blot. In vivo treatment response upon P529, irradiation or combination of P529 with IR was monitored by tumor volume, time to progression (TTP), and immunohistochemical analysis.  Results:   P529 treatment induced significantly more apoptosis and DNA double-strand break (DSB) when combined with radiotherapy resulting in cellular radiosensitization and growth delay of irradiated tumor xenografts. Upon P529 treatment Rad51, DNA-PKcs, and Ku70 protein expression was downregulated, indicating delayed DNA double-strand damage repair. The radiosensitizing properties of P529 were partially linked to GSK-3β, cyclin-D1, and c-myc modulation with associated inhibition of CRM1-mediated nuclear export of survivin. Importantly, autophagy and tumor senescence were involved in the enhanced P529 radioresponse.  Conclusions:   Impaired DNA double-strand damage repair, inhibition of CRM1-mediated nuclear export of survivin, modulation of cyclin-D1 and c-myc with associated pro-apoptotic and autophagic and senescent events explain the radiosensitizing properties of P529 in preclinical models of prostate cancer.""","""['Giovanni Luca Gravina', 'Francesco Marampon', 'David Sherris', 'Francesca Vittorini', 'Ernesto Di Cesare', 'Vincenzo Tombolini', 'Andrea Lenzi', 'Emmanuele A Jannini', 'Claudio Festuccia']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor, Palomid 529, reduces tumor growth and sensitizes to docetaxel and cisplatin in aggressive and hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells.', 'Keloid disease can be inhibited by antagonizing excessive mTOR signaling with a novel dual TORC1/2 inhibitor.', 'The novel Akt inhibitor Palomid 529 (P529) enhances the effect of radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Disrupting the mTOR signaling network as a potential strategy for the enhancement of cancer radiotherapy.', 'The role of survivin for radiation oncology: moving beyond apoptosis inhibition.', 'Anticancer effects of ABTL0812, a clinical stage drug inducer of autophagy-mediated cancer cell death, in glioblastoma models.', 'Therapeutic strategies of glioblastoma (GBM): The current advances in the molecular targets and bioactive small molecule compounds.', 'When to perform vertebroplasty?

Identifying factors predicting clinical response could guide patient selection and therapeutic optimization.  Experimental design:   Patients (N = 41) with melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), colorectal carcinoma, or castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated on an early-phase trial of anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) at one institution and had evaluable pretreatment tumor specimens. Immunoarchitectural features, including PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 expression, patterns of immune cell infiltration, and lymphocyte subpopulations, were assessed for interrelationships and potential correlations with clinical outcomes.  Results:   Membranous (cell surface) PD-L1 expression by tumor cells and immune infiltrates varied significantly by tumor type and was most abundant in melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC. In the overall cohort, PD-L1 expression was geographically associated with infiltrating immune cells (P < 0.001), although lymphocyte-rich regions were not always associated with PD-L1 expression. Expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells and immune infiltrates was significantly associated with expression of PD-1 on lymphocytes. PD-L2, the second ligand for PD-1, was associated with PD-L1 expression. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression correlated with objective response to anti-PD-1 therapy, when analyzing either the specimen obtained closest to therapy or the highest scoring sample among multiple biopsies from individual patients. These correlations were stronger than borderline associations of PD-1 expression or the presence of intratumoral immune cell infiltrates with response.  Conclusions:   Tumor PD-L1 expression reflects an immune-active microenvironment and, while associated other immunosuppressive molecules, including PD-1 and PD-L2, is the single factor most closely correlated with response to anti-PD-1 blockade.

Methods:   Global microRNA profiling was performed on docetaxel-resistant and sensitive cell lines to identify candidate circulating microRNA biomarkers.

Results:   Fourteen microRNAs were associated with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response or overall survival, according to Mann-Whitney U or log-rank tests. Non-responders to docetaxel and patients with shorter survival generally had high pre-docetaxel levels of miR-200 family members or decreased/unchanged post-docetaxel levels of miR-17 family members. Multivariate Cox regression with bootstrapping validation showed that pre-docetaxel miR-200b levels, post-docetaxel change in miR-20a levels, pre-docetaxel haemoglobin levels and visceral metastasis were independent predictors of overall survival when modelled together.

Ninety-five surgical samples were in parallel analysed. Correlation with histopathological variables, PSA and radiotherapy outcome was assessed. Dose-response experiments were performed in PC3 and DU145 cancer cell lines.  Results:   High MIB1 index (noted in 25% of cases) was directly related to Gleason score (P<0.0001), T3-stage (P=0.0008) and PSA levels (P=0.03).

The specific cell types of origin and the spatial/temporal patterns of reactive stroma initiation are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated human tumor tissue arrays by using multiple labeled, quantitative, spectral deconvolution microscopy. We report here a novel CD34/vimentin dual-positive reactive fibroblast that is observed in the cancer microenvironment of human breast, colon, lung, pancreas, thyroid, prostate, and astrocytoma. Recruitment of these cells occurred in xenograft tumors and Matrigel plugs in vivo and was also observed in stromal nodules associated with human benign prostatic hyperplasia. Because spatial and temporal data suggested the microvasculature as a common site of origin for these cells, we analyzed microvasculature fragments in organ culture. Interestingly, fibroblasts with identical phenotypic properties and markers expanded radially from microvasculature explants. We propose the concept of reactive microvasculature for the evolution of reactive stroma at sites of epithelial disruption common in both benign and malignant disorders. Data suggest that the reactive stroma response is conserved among tissues, in normal repair, and in different human cancers.

Subjects and methods:   We compared the genotypes of four PSA-SNPs between 964 Caucasian and 363 African-American men without known prostate cancer (PCa). We adjusted the PSA values based on an individual's PSA-SNP carrier status, and calculated the percentage of men that would meet commonly used PSA thresholds for biopsy (≥ 2.5 or ≥ 4.0 ng/mL) before and after genetic correction. Potentially unnecessary and delayed biopsies were defined as those men who were below and above the biopsy threshold after genetic correction, respectively.  Results:   Overall, 349 (96.1%) and 354 (97.5%) African-American men had measured PSA levels <2.5 and <4.0 ng/mL.

Conclusions:   There are significant differences in the influence of the PSA-SNPs between African-American and Caucasian men without known PCa, as genetic correction resulted in an increased proportion of African-American men crossing the threshold for biopsy.

Testosterone deficiency is also associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Restoring testosterone to physiological concentrations has beneficial effects on many of these symptoms; however, it is not known whether these effects can be sustained in the long term.  Aims:   To investigate whether treatment with testosterone undecanoate (TU) has a long-term and sustained effect on parameters affected by the MetS in men with LOH and ED, to determine whether long-term testosterone treatment can improve the overall health-related quality of life in these men, and to establish the safety of long-term testosterone treatment.  Methods:   Two hundred sixty-one patients (mean age 59.5 ± 8.4 years) diagnosed with LOH and ED were treated with long-acting TU in a prospective, observational, and longitudinal registry study. Men received intramuscular injections of 1,000 mg TU at day 1, at week 6, and every 3 months thereafter.  Main outcome measures:   Parameters affected by the MetS, including obesity parameters (body weight, waist circumference, and body mass index [BMI]), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, glucose, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), and blood pressure, as well as total testosterone levels and health-related quality of life, were assessed.  Results:   We found TU significantly improved obesity parameters (body weight, waist circumference, and BMI) and lowered total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c , and blood pressure over the 5-year study. HDL cholesterol was increased. TU treatment resulted in a sustained improvement in erectile function and muscle and joint pain, which contributed to an improvement in long-term health-related quality of life. Furthermore, we found a relationship between health-related quality of life and waist circumference. Finally, we found no evidence that long-term treatment with TU increases the risk of prostate carcinoma.

Patients and methods:   All patients, regardless of their biopsy history, who were referred for clinical suspicion of PCa (i.e elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and abnormal digital rectal examination) underwent 3T multiparametric-MRI (mpMRI) screening; and those with suspicious lesions in the anterior region of the prostate were identified. Patients then received a FGB of all suspicious lesions in addition to a systematic 12-core extended sextant TRUS-guided biopsy. We conducted a lesion-based analysis comparing cancer detection rates of anterior targets using FGB vs systematic cores taken from the same anatomic sextant within the prostate. Lengths of cancer in the most involved core were also compared between the two biopsy techniques used. Patients with only anterior targets were analysed separately.  Results:   Of 499 patients undergoing FGB, 162 had a total of 241 anterior lesions. The mean age, PSA level and prostate volume in this group were 62 years, 12.7 ng/dL, and 57 mL, respectively. In total, PCa was diagnosed in 121 anterior lesions (50.2%) identified on mpMRI. Sixty-two (25.7%) of these anterior lesions were documented as positive for cancer on systematic 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy cores, while 97 (40.2%) were positive on the targeted FGB cores (P = 0.001). In lesions that were positive on both FGB and TRUS biopsy, the most involved core was 112% longer on FGB (3.7 vs 1.6 mm, P ≤ 0.01). Forty-two patients had only anterior lesions on mpMRI; of these, 24 (57.1%) were found to have cancer on the FGB + TRUS biopsy platform. Six patients were positive on FGB only and 13 were positive on both biopsy techniques; however, 7/13 patients were upgraded to a higher Gleason score after FGB. All five patients positive on TRUS biopsy only were candidates for active surveillance.

The aims of this study were to verify if the AMACR inhibitor trifluoroibuprofen (TFIP) had anticancer effects and to determine the best route for in vivo administration.  Materials and methods:   In vitro effects of TFIP were verified by using three non-tumour prostate epithelial cell lines, a series of eight PCa cell lines and six cell derivatives. In vivo experiments were performed using PC3 and 22rv1 xenografts grown in nude mice with TFIP administered intraperitoneally or by oral gavage.  Results:   AMACR was expressed in PCa cell lines but was absent in normal and BPH cells. Although androgen-independent (AI) cell lines originating from androgen-dependent (AD) LnCaP cells displayed increased AMACR expression, the levels of this enzyme were higher in AI with respect to AD cell lines. TFIP induced: (1) down-modulation of AMACR expression; (2) suppression of the survival Akt/mTOR signalling pathway and (3) down-modulation of cyclin D1 and survivin with G2/M arrest and apoptosis. TFIP exhibited antitumour effects independently of the administration method. Nevertheless, oral administration was associated with acute toxicity at doses >75 mg/Kg/day. A dose of 75 mg/Kg administered biweekly reduced the toxicity whereas limited toxic effects were observed at 50 mg/Kg/day. Intraperitoneal administration of 75-100 mg/Kg/day was not toxic.  Conclusions:   AMACR is a good pharmacological target for treatment of PCa and TFIP is a suitable anticancer compound with parenteral administration being the preferred route.""","""['Claudio Festuccia', 'Giovanni Luca Gravina', 'Andrea Mancini', 'Paola Muzi', 'Ernesto Di Cesare', 'Ralph Kirk', 'Matthew Smith', 'Shaun Hughes', 'Robert Gibson', 'Lu-Yun Lian', 'Enrico Ricevuto', 'Andrew J Carnell']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Novel 2-arylthiopropanoyl-CoA inhibitors of α-methylacyl-CoA racemase 1A (AMACR; P504S) as potential anti-prostate cancer agents.', 'Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase as an androgen-independent growth modifier in prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of monoclonal antibody (P504S) and polyclonal antibody to alpha methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) in the work-up of prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic utility of alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S) on prostate needle biopsy.', 'Discovery and clinical application of a novel prostate cancer marker: alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S).', 'Racemases and epimerases operating through a 1,1-proton transfer mechanism: reactivity, mechanism and inhibition.', 'Current Knowledge on the Function of α-Methyl Acyl-CoA Racemase in Human Diseases.', 'Peroxisome Metabolism in Cancer.', 'Suppression of α-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase by miR200c inhibits prostate adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and migration.', 'Detection of fusion transcripts in the serum samples of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Causes for this disparity are unknown. The authors of this report examined the receipt of cancer treatment among AI/AN patients compared with white patients.  Methods:   This was a retrospective cohort study of 338,204 patients who were diagnosed at age ≥65 years with breast, colon, lung, or prostate cancer between 1996 and 2005 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. Nationally accepted guidelines for surgical and adjuvant therapy and surveillance were selected as metrics of optimal, guideline-concordant care. Treatment analyses compared AI/ANs with matched whites.  Results:   Across cancer types, AI/ANs were less likely to receive optimal cancer treatment and were less likely to undergo surgery (P ≤ .025 for all cancers). Adjuvant therapy rates were significantly lower for AI/AN patients with breast cancer (P < .001) and colon cancer (P = .001). Rates of post-treatment surveillance also were lower among AI/ANs and were statistically significantly lower for AI/AN patients with breast cancer (P = .002) and prostate cancer (P < .001). Nonreceipt of optimal cancer treatment was associated with significantly worse survival across cancer types. Disease-specific survival for those who did not undergo surgery was significantly lower for patients with breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62), colon cancer (HR, 0.74), prostate cancer (HR, 0.52), and lung cancer (HR, 0.36). Survival rates also were significantly lower for those patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (HR, 0.56), colon cancer (HR, 0.59), or prostate cancer (HR, 0.81; all 95% confidence intervals were <1.0).  Conclusions:   Fewer AI/AN patients than white patients received guideline-concordant cancer treatment across the 4 most common cancers.

It focuses on the dose received by the surfaces of the main organs at risk, namely the bladder and rectum. We have proposed both a surface-constrained dose accumulation approach and its extensive evaluation. Our approach relied on the nonrigid registration (NRR) of daily acquired CBCT images on the planning CT image. This proposed NRR method was based on a Demons-like algorithm, implemented in combination with mutual information metric. It allowed for different levels of geometrical constraints to be considered, ensuring a better point to point correspondence, especially when large deformations occurred, or in high dose gradient areas. The three following implementations: 1) full iconic NRR; 2) iconic NRR constrained with landmarks (LCNRR); 3) NRR constrained with full delineation of organs (DBNRR). To obtain reference data, we designed a numerical phantom based on finite-element modeling and image simulation. The methods were assessed on both the numerical phantom and real patient data in order to quantify uncertainties in terms of dose accumulation. The LCNRR method appeared to constitute a good compromise for dose monitoring in clinical practice.""","""['Guillaume Cazoulat', 'Antoine Simon', 'Aurelien Dumenil', 'Khemara Gnep', 'Renaud de Crevoisier', 'Oscar Acosta', 'Pascal Haigron']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Evaluation of on-board kV cone beam computed tomography-based dose calculation with deformable image registration using Hounsfield unit modifications.', 'Object-constrained meshless deformable algorithm for high speed 3D nonrigid registration between CT and CBCT.', 'Testicular doses in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'A novel approach for establishing benchmark CBCT/CT deformable image registrations in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of nonrigid registration models for interfraction dose accumulation in radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of an Open Source Registration Package for Automatic Contour Propagation in Online Adaptive Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Implementing Radiation Dose-Volume Liver Response in Biomechanical Deformable Image Registration.', 'Evaluation of deformable image registration methods for dose monitoring in head and neck radiotherapy.', 'Impact of head and neck cancer adaptive radiotherapy to spare the parotid glands and decrease the risk of xerostomia.']"""

The DynaLog files of a Varian Millennium MLC, recorded during an IMRT treatment, can be processed using a MATLAB-based code in order to generate the actual fluence for each beam and so recalculate the actual patient dose distribution using the Eclipse treatment planning system. The accuracy of the DynaLog-based dose reconstruction procedure was assessed by introducing ten intended errors to perturb the fluence of the beams of a reference plan such that ten subsequent erroneous plans were generated. In-phantom measurements with an ionization chamber (ion chamber) and planar dose measurements using an EPID system were performed to investigate the correlation between the measured dose changes and the expected ones detected by the reconstructed plans for the ten intended erroneous cases. Moreover, the method was applied to 20 cases of clinical plans for different locations (prostate, lung, breast, and head and neck). A dose-volume histogram (DVH) metric was used to evaluate the impact of the delivery errors in terms of dose to the patient. The ionometric measurements revealed a significant positive correlation (R² = 0.9993) between the variations of the dose induced in the erroneous plans with respect to the reference plan and the corresponding changes indicated by the DynaLog-based reconstructed plans. The EPID measurements showed that the accuracy of the DynaLog-based method to reconstruct the beam fluence was comparable with the dosimetric resolution of the portal dosimetry used in this work (3%/3 mm). The DynaLog-based reconstruction method described in this study is a suitable tool to perform a patient-specific IMRT QA. This method allows us to perform patient-specific IMRT QA by evaluating the result based on the DVH metric of the planning CT image (patient DVH-based IMRT QA).""","""['Juan F Calvo-Ortega', 'Tony Teke', 'Sandra Moragues', 'Miquel Pozo', 'Joan Casals-Farran']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Evaluation of MLC leaf positioning accuracy for static and dynamic IMRT treatments using DAVID in vivo dosimetric system.', 'Implementation of phantom-less IMRT delivery verification using Varian DynaLog files and R/V output.', 'Investigation of error detection capabilities of phantom, EPID and MLC log file based IMRT QA methods.', 'A method to reconstruct and apply 3D primary fluence for treatment delivery verification.', 'Patient-specific tumor and respiratory monitoring phantom design for quality controls of stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy in lung cancer cases.', 'A method for patient-specific DVH verification using a high-sampling-rate log file in an Elekta linac.', 'Insensitivity of machine log files to MLC leaf backlash and effect of MLC backlash on clinical dynamic MLC motion: An experimental investigation.', 'An Investigation of Multileaf Collimator Performance Dependence on Gantry Angle Using Machine Log Files.', 'Assessment of log-based fingerprinting system of Mobius3D with Elekta linear accelerators.', 'Validation of virtual water phantom software for pre-treatment verification of single-isocenter multiple-target stereotactic radiosurgery.']"""

In total, 16 static and 16 volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) fields were planned using four different energies. Isocenter dose was measured with a pinpoint chamber in homogeneous phantoms to investigate the dose prediction by the Delta(4DVH) Anatomy algorithm for static fields. Dose distributions of VMAT fields were measured using GAFCHROMIC film. Gravitational gantry errors up to 10° were introduced into all VMAT plans to study the potential of detecting errors. Additionally, 20 clinical treatment plans were verified. For static fields, the Delta(4DVH) Anatomy predicted the isocenter dose accurately, with a deviation to the measured phantom dose of 1.1% ± 0.6%. For VMAT fields the predicted Delta(4DVH) Anatomy dose in the isocenter plane corresponded to the measured dose in the phantom, with an average gamma agreement index (GAI) (3 mm/3%) of 96.9± 0.4%. The Delta(4DVH) Anatomy detected the induced systematic gantry error of 10° with a relative GAI (3 mm/3%) change of 5.8% ± 1.6%.

The jaw-tracking static arc (JTSA) plans were generated with fields that closed the jaws of each SA field into the multileaf collimators (MLCs) aperture.

For prostate patients, the organs far from the target showed larger sparing (3.7%-8.1% on average) in JTSA than the organs adjacent to the target (1.1%-1.5%). For the H&amp;N plans, the mean dose reductions for all organs ranged from 4.3% to 11.9%.

We propose a feature-selection search engine that explores previously treated cases of similar anatomy, returning the optimal plan configurations and attainable DVH constraints. Using an institutional database of 83 previously treated cases of prostate carcinoma treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy, the search procedure first finds the optimal isocenter position with an optimization procedure, then ranks the anatomical similarity as the mean distance between targets. For the best matching plan, the planning information is reformatted to the DICOM format and imported into the treatment planning system to suggest isocenter, arc directions, MLC patterns, and optimization constraints that can be used as starting points in the optimization process. The approach was tested to create prospective treatment plans based on anatomical features that match previously treated cases from the institution database. By starting from a near-optimal solution and using previous optimization constraints, the best matching test only required simple optimization steps to further decrease target inhomogeneity, ultimately reducing time spend by the therapist in planning arcs' directions and lengths.""","""['Eduard Schreibmann', 'Tim Fox']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Multicriteria optimization informed VMAT planning.', 'Vector-model-supported approach in prostate plan optimization.', 'VMAT optimization with dynamic collimator rotation.', 'Impact of database quality in knowledge-based treatment planning for prostate cancer.', 'Incorporating geometric ray tracing to generate initial conditions for intensity modulated arc therapy optimization.', 'Data-Driven Dose-Volume Histogram Prediction.', 'Outcome-based multiobjective optimization of lymphoma radiation therapy plans.', 'Tree-based exploration of the optimization objectives for automatic cervical cancer IMRT treatment planning.', 'Deep Learning-Based Fluence Map Prediction for Pancreas Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With Simultaneous Integrated Boost.', 'Offline Quality Assurance for Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Treatment Plans for NRG-HN001 Head and Neck Clinical Trial Using Knowledge-Based Planning.']"""

To improve plan quality and reduce treatment time for our in-house treatment planning system, we implemented a new DAO approach without using a global objective function (GFO). An index concept is introduced as an inverse form of back-projection used in the CT multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART). The index, introduced for IMRT optimization in this work, is analogous to the multiplicand in MART. The index is defined as the ratio of the optima over the current. It is assigned to each voxel and beamlet to optimize the fluence map. The indices for beamlets and segments are used to optimize multileaf collimator (MLC) segment shapes and segment weights, respectively. Preliminary data show that without sacrificing dosimetric quality, the implementation of the DAO reduced average IMRT treatment time from 13 min to 8 min for the prostate, and from 15 min to 9 min for the head and neck using our in-house treatment planning system PlanUNC.

All patients underwent pretreatment kV-CBCT imaging. The various tumor sites were divided into four categories; 21 brain (438 fractions), 35 head-and-neck tumors (H&amp;N, 933 fractions), 19 thorax and abdomen tumors (T&amp;A, 313 fractions), and 17 prostate cancer tumors (546 fractions). Overall distributions of setup corrections in all directions, frequencies of 3D vector lengths, institution-specific setup error, and PTV margins were analyzed. The longitudinal distribution for the T&amp;A site represented an asymmetric offset in the negative direction. Rotational distributions were comparable for all treatment sites, and the prostate site had the narrowest distribution of ≤ ± 2°. The cumulative frequencies of 3D vector length of ≥ 7 mm were rare for brain lesions and H&amp;N, but more common for T&amp;A and prostate lesions at 25.6% and 12.1%, respectively.

The largest magnitude of systematic error and random error for the brain lesions and H&amp;N was 1.4 mm in the translational directions, and 3.3 mm for T&amp;A and prostate lesions. The PTV margins required in this analysis are ≤ 4 mm for the brain lesions and H&amp;N in all translational directions, but ranged from 4 to 10 mm for T&amp;A and prostate lesions.

We found that the nitric oxide synthase NOS1 is upregulated in CXCL14-expressing CAF and in fibroblasts stimulated with CXCL14. Induction of Nos1 was associated with oxidative stress and occurred together with activation of NRF2 and HIF1α signaling in CXCL14-expressing CAF.

Material and methods:   A total of 46 male patients (median age, 65 years; range, 49-73 years) with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent an en bloc computed tomography perfusion (CTP) scan of the prostate before surgery. The perfusion parameters mean transit time (MTT), blood flow (BF), and blood volume (BV), as well as the microvessel density (MVD) of surgical specimens were determined. Differences in CTP parameters and MVD among postsurgical Gleason score (sGS) and postsurgical combined Gleason grade (sGG) groups were analyzed. Spearman correlation coefficients were determined between CTP parameters and presurgical biopsy-derived Gleason score (bGS), presurgical biopsy-derived combined Gleason grade (bGG), sGS, sGG, MVD, and pathological tumor stage. A linear regression analysis was carried out for exogenous variables BF, BV, MTT, bGS, and presurgical biopsy-derived combined Gleason grade and endogenous variables sGS, sGG, MVD, and T stage. A receiver operating characteristics analysis was performed to analyze the discriminating performance of CTP parameters and bGS between intermediate- and high-grade tumors.  Results:   The mean perfusion parameters within the prostate tissue were as follows: BF, 39.1 ± 13.4 mL/100 mL min; BV, 4.9 ± 2.4 mL/100 mL; and MTT, 8.9 ± 3.7 seconds. The mean MVD of the tumor tissue was 144.3 ± 55.6/mm. Computed tomography perfusion parameters and MVD were significantly higher in patients with high-grade tumors compared with those with intermediate-grade tumors (P < 0.01 for BF, BV, and MVD). Only BV and MVD were significantly different among sGS and sGG groups. Moderate correlations were found between BF and sGS (0.38) and between BV and sGS (0.43). Linear relations of BV to sGS and to sGG were found. Blood volume (area under the curve, 0.86) was superior to bGS (area under the curve, 0.75) in discriminating high-grade from intermediate-grade tumors.  Conclusion:   Computed tomography perfusion parameters derived by en bloc perfusion of the prostate are higher in high-grade tumors compared with intermediate-grade tumors. Blood flow and BV correlate with the definitive Gleason score. Blood volume predicts high-grade tumors better than does the Gleason score of biopsy specimens.

In normal cells, the activation of TRPV2 channels by growth factors, hormones, and endocannabinoids induces a translocation of the receptor from the endosomal compartment to the plasma membrane, which results in abrogation of cell proliferation and induction of cell death. Consequently, loss or inactivation of TRPV2 signaling (e.g., glioblastomas), induces unchecked proliferation, resistance to apoptotic signals and increased resistance to CD95-induced apoptotic cell death. On the other hand, in prostate cancer cells, Ca2+-dependent activation of TRPV2 induced by lysophospholipids increases the invasion of tumor cells. In addition, the progression of prostate cancer to the castration-resistant phenotype is characterized by de novo TRPV2 expression, with higher TRPV2 transcript levels in patients with metastatic cancer. Finally, TRPV2 functional expression in tumor cells can also depend on the presence of alternative splice variants of TRPV2 mRNA that act as dominant-negative mutant of wild-type TRPV2 channels, by inhibiting its trafficking and translocation to the plasma membrane. In conclusion, as TRP channels are altered in human cancers, and their blockage impair tumor progression, they appear to be a very promising targets for early diagnosis and chemotherapy.""","""['Sonia Liberati', 'Maria Beatrice Morelli', 'Consuelo Amantini', 'Valerio Farfariello', 'Matteo Santoni', 'Alessandro Conti', 'Massimo Nabissi', 'Stefano Cascinu', 'Giorgio Santoni']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Advances in transient receptor potential vanilloid-2 channel expression and function in tumor growth and progression.', 'The TRPV2 cation channels: from urothelial cancer invasiveness to glioblastoma multiforme interactome signature.', 'TRPV2: A Cancer Biomarker and Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Type-2(TRPV2) Ion Channels in Neurogenesis andGliomagenesis: Cross-Talk between TranscriptionFactors and Signaling Molecules.', 'Role of cationic channel TRPV2 in promoting prostate cancer migration and progression to androgen resistance.', 'Identification of a novel eighteen-gene signature of recurrent metastasis neuroblastoma.', 'Mechanosensitive Ion Channels and Their Role in Cancer Cells.', 'Coexpression of TRPML1 and TRPML2 Mucolipin Channels Affects the Survival of Glioblastoma Patients.', 'Transient receptor potential channels in multiple myeloma.', 'Cationic Channel TRPV2 Overexpression Promotes Resistance to Cisplatin-Induced Apoptosis in Gastric Cancer Cells.']"""

Materials and methods:   ORF proteins were mined using bioinformatics and proteomic tools to predict motifs and domains, and cancer relevance was established using cancer genome, transcriptome and proteome analysis tools.  Results:   A novel testis-restricted ORF protein present in chromosome X called CXorf66 was detected in the serum, plasma and neutrophils. This gene is termed secreted glycoprotein in chromosome X (SGPX). The SGPX gene is up-regulated in cancer of the brain, lung and in leukemia, and down-regulated in liver and prostate cancer. Brain cancer in female patients exhibited elevated copy numbers of the SGPX gene.  Conclusion:   The SGPX gene is a putative novel cancer biomarker.

Methods and materials:   We retrospectively analyzed 57 patients who had mp-MRI and core needle biopsy during diagnostic prostate cancer evaluation. The MRI sequences were scored for suspicion of cancer with a previously described system. Distributions of mp-MRI scores were compared across National Comprehensive Cancer Network prostate cancer risk groups. The mp-MRI-identified lesions were compared with the location of positive core needle biopsies to assess mp-MRI localization of true lesions.  Results:   The mp-MRI scoring system identified lesions in 84% (48/57) of the patients, including 100% (12/12) in the high-risk group. Scores assigned to lesions in patients in intermediate- and high-risk groups were statistically higher than those in the low-risk group, with a relative risk of 6.72 (95% confidence interval: 2.32-19.51, p<0.001) of having an aggressive score assigned in high-risk patients compared with the low-risk patients. In comparing the localization data from core needle biopsy, 68% of the patients had an MRI-identified lesion in or within one adjacent sextant of the same prostate hemigland, including 85% of aggressive lesions.  Conclusions:   Use of mp-MRI at the time of diagnosis can identify intraprostatic lesions and assign suspicion for high-risk disease. These data show that high-risk patients are more likely to have suspicious imaging-identified lesions that correlate to the location of biopsy-proven prostate cancer. At this time, the use of mp-MRI to define focal targets represents a complementary tool to patient evaluation for focal therapy strategies.""","""['Erik S Anderson', 'Daniel J A Margolis', 'Shane Mesko', 'Robyn Banerjee', 'Pin-Chieh Wang', 'D Jeffrey Demanes', 'Patrick Kupelian', 'Mitchell Kamrava']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Transperineal biopsies of MRI-detected aggressive index lesions in low-\xa0and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients: Implications for treatment decision.', 'Analysis of histological findings obtained combining US/mp-MRI fusion-guided biopsies with systematic US biopsies: mp-MRI role in prostate cancer detection and false negative.', 'Location of Prostate Cancers Determined by Multiparametric and MRI-Guided Biopsy in Patients With Elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen Level and at Least One Negative Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Biopsy.', 'An update on prostate biopsy in the era of magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Phase 1 Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Neoadjuvant to Radical Prostatectomy for Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Detection of Dominant Intra-prostatic Lesions in Patients With Prostate Cancer Using an Artificial Neural Network and MR Multi-modal Radiomics Analysis.', 'Multimodal Imaging in Focal Therapy Planning and Assessment in Primary Prostate Cancer.', 'Early Outcome of Prostate Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) Incorporating a Simultaneous Intra-Prostatic MRI Directed Boost.']"""

Here, we report a critical role for Lunatic Fringe (Lfng), which encodes an O-fucosylpeptide 3-ß-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase known to modify epidermal growth factor repeats of Notch receptor proteins, in regulation of prostate epithelial differentiation and proliferation, as well as in prostate tumor suppression. Deletion of Lfng in mice caused altered Notch activation in the prostate, associated with elevated accumulation of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 intracellular domains, decreased levels of the putative Notch3 intracellular fragment, as well as increased expression of Hes1, Hes5, and Hey2. Loss of Lfng resulted in expansion of the basal layer, increased proliferation of both luminal and basal cells, and ultimately, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The Lfng-null prostate showed down-regulation of prostatic tumor suppressor gene NKX3.1 and increased androgen receptor expression. Interestingly, expression of LFNG and NKX3.1 were positively correlated in publically available human prostate cancer data sets. Knockdown of LFNG in DU-145 prostate cancer cells led to expansion of CD44(+)CD24(-) and CD49f(+)CD24(-) stem/progenitor-like cell population associated with enhanced prostatosphere-forming capacity.

The aim of this study was to determine the degree of distortion on DWI using a state-of-the-art clinical protocol and to explore the main contributors to geometric distortion.  Materials and methods:   Forty consecutive patients underwent 3T MRI of the prostate with an endorectal coil filled with air (n = 20) or barium sulfate (n = 20). Distortion was measured as the maximum displacement of the outer boundary of the prostate on DWI relative to T2-weighted imaging. The effects of phase-encoding direction, receiver bandwidth, and parallel imaging were then assessed in a prostate phantom on two MRI scanners from different manufacturers.  Results:   There was no statistical difference in the mean displacement of the prostate on DWI between the air cohort (1.8 ± 1.2 mm, range 0-4.2 mm) and barium cohort (1.8 ± 2.2 mm, range 0-9 mm). Displacement of the prostate was observed in the phase-encoding direction. Phantom experiments demonstrated a horizontal displacement of 6.0 mm in the phase-encoding direction, which decreased with the use of parallel imaging and higher bandwidth. Geometric distortion was similar for all b values and across manufacturers.  Conclusions:   Geometric distortion on DWI of the prostate is common in the phase-encoding direction and does not improve with inflating the coil with barium sulfate. Strategies to reduce this artifact include the use of higher bandwidth and accelerated imaging. Correction of this phenomenon should improve localization of prostate cancer, particularly important for targeted prostate biopsies or focal therapies.""","""['Francisco Donato Jr', 'Daniel N Costa', 'Qing Yuan', 'Neil M Rofsky', 'Robert E Lenkinski', 'Ivan Pedrosa']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Acad Radiol""","""['Segmented diffusion-weighted imaging of the prostate: Application to transperineal in-bore 3T MR image-guided targeted biopsy.', 'Exploratory study of geometric distortion correction of prostate diffusion-weighted imaging using B0 map acquisition.', 'Small Field-of-view single-shot EPI-DWI of the prostate: Evaluation of spatially-tailored two-dimensional radiofrequency excitation pulses.', 'Diffusion-weighted MRI of the prostate.', 'MR imaging of the prostate: 1.5T versus 3T.', 'The future of PSMA PET and WB MRI as next-generation imaging tools in prostate cancer.', 'Diffusion and quantification of diffusion of prostate cancer.', 'Accelerated Segmented Diffusion-Weighted Prostate Imaging for Higher Resolution, Higher Geometric Fidelity, and Multi-b Perfusion Estimation.', 'Technical challenges of quantitative chest MRI data analysis in a large cohort pediatric study.', 'Model-based reconstruction framework for correction of signal pile-up and geometric distortions in prostate diffusion MRI.']"""

But, the optimal management of these patients after radical prostatectomy is an issue which has been debated continuously. The object of this study was to determine the necessity of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) by reviewing the outcomes of observation without ART after radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients with pathologic indications for ART according to the American Urological Association (AUA)/American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guideline.  Methods:   From a prospectively maintained database, 163 patients were eligible for inclusion in this study. These men had a pathological stage pT2-3 N0 with undetectable PSA level after RP and met one or more of the three following risk factors: capsular perforation, positive surgical margins, or seminal vesicle invasion. We excluded the patients who had received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy or adjuvant treatment, or had less than 24 months of follow-up. To determine the factors that influenced biochemical recurrence-free (BCR), univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed.  Results:   Among the 163 patients, median follow-up was 50.5 months (24.0-88.2 months). Of those men under observation, 27 patients had BCR and received salvage radiotherapy (SRT). The multivariate Cox analysis showed that BCR was marginally associated with pre-operative serum PSA (P = 0.082), and the pathologic GS (HR, 4.063; P = 0.001) was an independent predictor of BCR. More importantly, in 87 patients with pre-operative PSA < 6.35 ng/ml and GS ≤ 7, only 3 developed BCR.  Conclusions:   Of the 163 patients who qualified for ART based on the current AUA/ASTRO guideline, only 27 (16.6%) developed BCR and received SRT. Therefore, using ART following RP using the current recommendation may be an overtreatment in an overwhelming majority of the patients.""","""['Jung Hun Kang', 'Yun-Sok Ha', 'Sung Kim', 'Jihyeong Yu', 'Neal Patel', 'Jaspreet S Parihar', 'Amirali Hassanzadeh Salmasi', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Refining the American Urological Association and American Society for Radiation Oncology guideline for adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy using the pathologic Gleason score.', 'Adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy after prostatectomy: AUA/ASTRO Guideline.', 'Adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy after prostatectomy: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline endorsement.', 'Patterns of Care Related to Post-Operative Radiotherapy for Patients with Prostate Cancer among Canadian Radiation Oncologists and Urologists.', 'Adjuvant vs. salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'A Recursive Partitioning Analysis Demonstrating Risk Subsets for 8-Year Biochemical Relapse After Margin-Positive Radical Prostatectomy Without Adjuvant Hormone or Radiation Therapy.', 'Outcomes of pathologically localized high-grade prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Management of prostate cancer: NYU Case of the Month, July 2017.', 'Effect of Preoperative Risk Group Stratification on Oncologic Outcomes of Patients with Adverse Pathologic Findings at Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Refining the American Urological Association and American Society for Radiation Oncology guideline for adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy using the pathologic Gleason score.']"""

The goal of this study was to investigate some of the MRS-detectable metabolic consequences of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition. We investigated PC3 prostate cancer, MCF-7 breast cancer and A375 melanoma cells, and determined that, consistent with previous studies, MRS-detectable levels of phosphocholine decreased significantly in all cell lines (to 63%, 50% and 18% of the control, respectively) following MEK inhibition with U0126. This effect was mediated by a decrease in the expression of choline kinase α, the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline. In contrast, the impact of MEK inhibition on glycolysis was cell line dependent. A375 cells, which express mutant BRAF, demonstrated significant decreases in glucose uptake (to 36% of control) and lactate production (to 42% of control) in line with positron emission tomography data. In contrast, in PC3 and MCF-7 cells, increases in glucose uptake (to 198% and 192% of control, respectively) and lactate production (to 177% and 212% of control, respectively) were observed, in line with a previous hyperpolarized (13) C MRS study. This effect is probably mediated by the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway and AMP-activated protein kinase.

However, not all people with cancer identify as a survivor, and underlying factors and correlates are yet to be well-explored empirically.  Methods:   Study 1 surveyed men in a prostate cancer peer support network (n = 514), exploring psychosocial variables related to adopting a survivor identity. Study 2 interviewed 160 women with breast cancer in an online support group and collected observational data, assessing how survivor identity relates to perceptions of and participation in online support groups.  Results:   For men, survivor identity (35 %) was related to lower levels of threat appraisal (p = .000), more deliberate rumination (p = .042), gaining greater understanding of cancer experience through peers (p = .041) and a higher, though marginally significant, level of posttraumatic growth (p = .052). Women adopting a survivor identity (50 %) had higher rates of online support group posts (p = .048), a greater feeling of mattering to the group (p = .002), rated the group as more helpful (p = .004 to .01) and had less difficulty in relating to the group (p = .002) than women not identifying as a survivor.

Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference technique was employed to silence the expression of EpCAM in prostate cancer cell LNCaP and construct a stable transfected cell line. In vitro assay was conducted to analyze the effect of EpCAM expression on the expressions of Androgen receptor (AR), Prostate specific antigen (PSA), and cellular proliferation and invasion. EpCAM was found significantly expressed higher in prostate cancer tissues than in normal adjacent tissues. In three cell lines (DU-145, PC-3, and LNCaP), the expression of EpCAM in LNCaP, androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, was significantly higher than that in the other two. As EpCAM was silenced in LNCaP, the expression levels of AR and PSA obviously descended, and cellular abilities of proliferation and invasion were obviously inhibited.The overexpression of EpCAM has correlation with the genesis of prostate cancer, especially androgen-dependent prostate cancer.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed pre-biopsy MRI findings and correlated the same with subsequent radical prostatectomy pathology reports in all patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2010 and 2012. Specifically, comparison was made between MRI and pathologic stage. Age, serum prostate-specific antigen level and Gleason score were recorded.  Results:   MRI detected signal abnormalities in 50 out of 88 PCA patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Of these, 12 had ECE and 7 had SVI on final histology. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for detecting ECE were 75 and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for detecting SVI were 16.7 and 100%, respectively. The positive predictive values for determining ECE and SVI were 100% and negative predictive values were 96.2 and 90.6%, respectively.  Conclusions:   MRI may be reliable for excluding ECE and SVI in PCA patients where the lesion is visible on MRI. It has a good diagnostic ability for ECE, but is less accurate for identifying SVI.

PSA and testosterone levels were measured after discontinuation of therapy. PSA > 4.0 ng/ml was defined as PSA relapse in this study.  Results:   Mean age at discontinuation of hormone therapy was 78.7 years (range, 66-90). Mean duration of follow-up after discontinuation of therapy was 25.5 months. PSA non-relapse rate was quite high (87.1%). 4 of the 31 patients showed PSA relapse, after 12-24 months. Testosterone level exceeded castration level (< 1.0 ng/ml) in 3 patients, each of whom developed PSA relapse.  Conclusions:   During follow-up, the PSA relapse rate was relatively low.

Therefore, in targeted anti-cancer therapy development, intervention at the level of cancer-specific transcription is of high interest. The steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) is highly expressed in breast, endometrial, and prostate cancer. It is present in various transcription complexes, including those containing nuclear hormone receptors. We examined the effects of a peptide that contains the LXXLL-motif of the human SRC-1 nuclear receptor box 1 linked to the cell-penetrating transportan 10 (TP10), hereafter referred to as TP10-SRC1LXXLL, on proliferation and estrogen-mediated transcription of breast cancer cells in vitro. Our data show that TP10-SRC1LXXLL induced dose-dependent cell death of breast cancer cells, and that this effect was not affected by estrogen receptor (ER) status. Surprisingly TP10-SRC1LXXLL severely reduced the viability and proliferation of hormone-unresponsive breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, the regulation of the endogenous ERα direct target gene pS2 was not affected by TP10-SRC1LXXLL in estrogen-stimulated MCF-7 cells. Dermal fibroblasts were similarly affected by treatment with higher concentrations of TP10-SRC1LXXLL and this effect was significantly delayed. These results suggest that the TP10-SRC1LXXLL peptide may be an effective drug candidate in the treatment of cancers with minimal therapeutic options, for example ER-negative tumors.""","""['Kairit Tints', 'Madis Prink', 'Toomas Neuman', 'Kaia Palm']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Decursin and decursinol angelate inhibit estrogen-stimulated and estrogen-independent growth and survival of breast cancer cells.', 'The modulatory role of low concentrations of bisphenol A on tamoxifen-induced proliferation and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.', 'GGNBP2 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting estrogen receptor α activity in breast cancer cells.', 'The DHEA metabolite 7β-hydroxy-epiandrosterone exerts anti-estrogenic effects on breast cancer cell lines.', 'Structure and function of the pS2 gene and estrogen receptor in human breast cancer cells.', 'The role of cell-penetrating peptides in potential anti-cancer therapy.', 'Delivery of Various Cargos into Cancer Cells and Tissues via Cell-Penetrating Peptides: A Review of the Last Decade.', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides and Transportan.', 'Activation of AKT signaling via small molecule natural compound prevents against osteoblast apoptosis and osteonecrosis of the femoral head.', 'Obesity Mediates Apoptosis and Extracellular Matrix Metabolic Imbalances via MAPK Pathway Activation in Intervertebral Disk Degeneration.']"""

Materials and methods:   A panel of microRNAs was profiled in the plasma of 70 patients and the urine of 33 patients collected prior to radical prostatectomy. Expression of microRNAs was correlated to the clinical endpoints at a follow-up time of 3.9 years to identify microRNAs that may predict clinical response after radical prostatectomy. A machine learning approach was applied to test the predictive ability of all microRNAs profiled in urine, plasma, and a combination of both, and global performance assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Validation of urinary expression of miRNAs was performed on a further independent cohort of 36 patients.  Results:   The best predictor in plasma using eight miRs yielded only moderate predictive performance (AUC = 0.62). The best predictor of high-risk disease was achieved using miR-16, miR-21 and miR-222 measured in urine (AUC = 0.75). This combination of three microRNAs in urine was a better predictor of high-risk disease than any individual microRNA. Using a different methodology we found that this set of miRNAs was unable to predict high-volume, high-grade disease.  Conclusions:   Our initial findings suggested that plasma and urinary profiling of microRNAs at radical prostatectomy may allow prognostication of prostate cancer behaviour. However we found that the microRNA expression signature failed to validate in an independent cohort of patients using a different platform for PCR. This highlights the need for independent validation patient cohorts and suggests that urinary microRNA signatures at radical prostatectomy may not be a robust way to predict the course of clinical disease after definitive treatment for prostate cancer.""","""['Nikhil Sapre', 'Matthew K H Hong', 'Geoff Macintyre', 'Heather Lewis', 'Adam Kowalczyk', 'Anthony J Costello', 'Niall M Corcoran', 'Christopher M Hovens']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Diagnostic and Prognostic MicroRNA Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer in Cell-free Urine.', 'Detection of miRNAs in urine of prostate cancer patients.', 'The utility of urine-circulating miRNAs for detection of prostate cancer.', 'miRNAs as novel biomarkers in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Urine microRNAs as potential noninvasive biomarkers in urologic cancers.', 'A Diagnostic Classifier Based on Circulating miRNA Pairs for COPD Using a Machine Learning Approach.', 'Exosomal microRNAs in cancer: Potential biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets for immune checkpoint molecules.', 'The diagnostic and prognostic value of the miR-17-92 cluster in hepatocellular carcinoma: A meta-analysis.', 'Prognostic value of miR-21 for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Urinary exosome microRNA signatures as a noninvasive prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer.']"""

The α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) immunostain, a marker of neoplastic prostatic epithelial cells, may be used to evaluate these limited tumor cases, in needle biopsy, with a reported sensitivity ranging to a low of 80%. The use of the ERG immunostain in evaluating prostate cancer is becoming more common, but the utility of this marker in direct comparison with AMACR has not been examined. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether the ERG immunostain adds diagnostic value to AMACR expression in evaluating untreated prostate cancer foci measuring <1 mm in core needle biopsy. We identified 129 blocks from 113 patients with continuous tumor foci measuring <1 mm on core needle biopsy. ERG and AMACR immunostaining analyses were performed on serial sections from the blocks, and expression was assessed by intensity and proportion scores assigned to each stain. Sixty-five of the selected blocks from 63 patients retained tumor foci measuring <1 mm after obtaining deeper sections. Of these 65 tumor foci, 36 were positive for AMACR alone, 28 were positive for AMACR and ERG, and 1 was positive for ERG alone. AMACR had a sensitivity of 99%, and ERG had a sensitivity of 45%. Most cases displayed strong AMACR expression, and only 7 of 65 foci (11%) exhibited weak or negative AMACR expression. Of these 7 foci with weak or negative AMACR expression, only 2 foci were ERG positive. This is the first study to our knowledge that examines the diagnostic utility of ERG expression in comparison with AMACR expression in minimal usual acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate in core needle biopsy. Our findings suggest that AMACR should be the first-line positive marker for confirmation of a diagnosis of minimal adenocarcinoma of the prostate, when needed. ERG immunohistochemistry is potentially indicated only in uncommon cases of minimal adenocarcinoma when AMACR staining is negative or weak, and in these cases ERG is informative in only a minority (29%) of cases. Evidence-based utilization of diagnostic markers, without their routine overutilization, such as ERG expression in minimal adenocarcinoma, that do not provide added diagnostic value in most cases, is an important principle in application of immunohistochemistry in this era of cost-consciousness.""","""['Caitlin Andrews', 'Peter A Humphrey']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Foamy gland carcinoma of the prostate in needle biopsy: incidence, Gleason grade, and comparative α-methylacyl-CoA racemase vs. ERG expression.', 'Immunohistochemical stains for p63 and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, versus a cocktail comprising both, in the diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma: a comparison of the immunohistochemical staining of 430 foci in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy tissues.', 'Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase: a variably sensitive immunohistochemical marker for the diagnosis of small prostate cancer foci on needle biopsy.', 'Application of alpha-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Diagnostic utility of alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S) on prostate needle biopsy.', 'Diagnostic utility of immunohistochemical markers alpha methyl acyl coA racemase (AMACR) and Ets related gene (ERG) in prostate cancer.', 'The Role of AMACR, CD10, TMPRSS2-ERG, and p27 Protein Expression Among Different Gleason Grades of Prostatic Adenocarcinoma on Needle Biopsy.', 'Histopathology of Prostate Cancer.', 'Discovering Pair-wise Synergies in Microarray Data.', 'A New Combinatorial Optimization Approach for Integrated Feature Selection Using Different Datasets: A Prostate Cancer Transcriptomic Study.']"""

NUMB, well-known tumor suppressor gene, is a novel interacting partner of TRPV6. We show that NUMB and TRPV6 have a reciprocal positive regulatory relationship in PC-3 cells. We repeated this experiment in two other prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and LNCaP. Interestingly, there were no significant changes in TRPV6 expression following NUMB knockdown in DU145. We revealed that the presence or absence of PTEN was the cause of NUMB-TRPV6 function. Loss of PTEN caused a positive correlation of TRPV6-NUMB expression.

The prognostic significance of large cribriform Gleason pattern 4 (LC) in conjunction with IDC has not been previously investigated. The aim of our study was to determine the impact of IDC and LC on biochemical recurrence-free rate (bRFR) in a contemporary prostatectomy cohort.  Methods:   Prostate cancers of 246 prostatectomies, median follow-up 130.6 months, were graded with the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) 2005 modified Gleason score (GS) and assessed for the presence of LC and/or IDC. In 57 cases with LC and/or IDC, immunostaining was performed to distinguish LC and IDC. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate 5-year bRFR probabilities. Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   Multivariable analysis showed that the presence of any amount of LC or IDC had a highly significant prognostic effect on bRFR (HR 2.98, 95% CI: 1.68-5.28, p=0.0002) after adjusting for GS, surgical margin status and pathological stage. Although IDC alone tended to be associated with a worse prognosis, LC and IDC did not appear to be associated with a difference in bRFR when analysed separately.  Conclusion:   We demonstrate that the presence of any amount of LC/IDC is a significant prognostic factor after adjusting for Gleason score and T stage in determining patient outcome and we advocate including the presence of either in routine pathology reporting.""","""['Dominique Trudel', 'Michelle R Downes', 'Jenna Sykes', 'Ken J Kron', 'John Trachtenberg', 'Theodorus H van der Kwast']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Presence of high grade tertiary Gleason pattern upgrades the Gleason sum score and is inversely associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival.', 'Prognostic Significance of Percentage and Architectural Types of Contemporary Gleason Pattern 4 Prostate Cancer in Radical Prostatectomy.', 'High Gleason grade carcinoma at a positive surgical margin predicts biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy and may guide adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'The impact of the 2005 international society of urological pathology consensus conference on standard Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma in needle biopsies.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate Gland: Recent Advances.', 'Leukocytic Infiltration of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate: An Exploratory Study.', 'A DNA copy number alteration classifier as a prognostic tool for prostate cancer patients.', 'Prostate Cancer Morphologies: Cribriform Pattern and Intraductal Carcinoma Relations to Adverse Pathological and Clinical Outcomes-Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Prostate Pathology: What is New in the 2022 WHO Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumors?', 'Construction and validation of a clinical predictive nomogram for intraductal carcinoma of the prostate based on Chinese multicenter clinical data.']"""

Modern postprocessing workstations allow automated volume measurement of data sets acquired. However, there are challenges in the use of lung volume as an indicator of pulmonary disease when it is obtained from routine CT. Intra-individual variation and methodologic aspects have to be considered. Our goal was to assess the reliability of volumetric measurements in routine CT lung scans.  Materials and methods:   Forty adult cancer patients whose lungs were unaffected by the disease underwent routine chest CT scans in 3-month intervals, resulting in a total number of 302 chest CT scans. Lung volume was calculated by automatic volumetry software. On average of 7.2 CT scans were successfully evaluable per patient (range 2-15). Intra-individual changes were assessed.  Results:   In the set of patients investigated, lung volume was approximately normally distributed, with a mean of 5283 cm(3) (standard deviation = 947 cm(3), skewness = -0.34, and curtosis = 0.16). Between different scans in one and the same patient the median intra-individual standard deviation in lung volume was 853 cm(3) (16% of the mean lung volume).  Conclusions:   Automatic lung segmentation of routine chest CT scans allows a technically stable estimation of lung volume. However, substantial intra-individual variations have to be considered. A median intra-individual deviation of 16% in lung volume between different routine scans was found.""","""['Matthias Haas', 'Bernd Hamm', 'Stefan M Niehues']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Acad Radiol""","""['Semi-automatic volumetric measurement of lung cancer using multi-detector CT effects of nodule characteristics.', 'Computer analysis of computed tomography scans of the lung: a survey.', 'Morphological segmentation and partial volume analysis for volumetry of solid pulmonary lesions in thoracic CT scans.', 'Emphysema quantification and lung volumetry in chest X-ray equivalent ultralow dose CT - Intra-individual comparison with standard dose CT.', 'Review of automatic pulmonary lobe segmentation methods from CT.', 'Quantitative analysis of pulmonary perfusion with dual-energy CT angiography: comparison of two quantification methods in patients with pulmonary embolism.', 'Automated estimation of total lung volume using chest radiographs and deep learning.', 'Building Large-Scale Quantitative Imaging Databases with Multi-Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning: Initial Experience with Whole-Body Organ Volumetric Analyses.', 'Is lung density associated with severity of COVID-19?', 'High throughput image labeling on chest computed tomography by deep learning.']"""

However, detectability of prostate calcification with megavoltage helical computed tomography (MVCT) has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the detectability of prostate calcification and to investigate how to predict detectability of calcification with MVCT.  Materials and methods:   Thirty patients with prostate cancer who were scheduled for helical tomotherapy were included in this study. The detectability of prostate calcification on MVCT was evaluated by comparing against kilovoltage multidetector-row CT (KVCT) as the standard of reference. Maximum signal intensity (SImax), area (A) of calcification, and the product of both (SImax·A) were compared between undetectable and detectable calcifications. Then, the threshold values of SImax, A, and SImax·A were decided to achieve 100% sensitivity on MVCT.  Results:   KVCT identified 49 calcifications in 28 of 30 patients. MVCT detected 19 (39%) of 49 calcifications in 15 (50%) of 30 patients. The minimum threshold values of SImax, A, and SImax·A to detect prostate calcifications were 953 HU, 20.98 mm(2), and 7784 HU mm(2), respectively. Using the threshold values of SImax, A, and SImax·A, 20% (10/49), 18% (9/49), and 35% (17/49) of calcifications were in the detection range, respectively.  Conclusions:   MVCT can depict about one-third of prostate calcifications detectable on KVCT.

Although the underlying mechanisms are less clear, gene regulatory abilities of coactivators can bridge the transcription functions of AR and NF-κB. The present study shows that MYST1 (MOZ, YBF2 and SAS2, and TIP60 protein 1) costimulates AR and NF-κB functions in PCa cells. We demonstrate that activation of NF-κB promotes deacetylation of MYST1 by sirtuin 1. Further, the mutually exclusive interactions of MYST1 with sirtuin 1 vs AR regulate the acetylation of lysine 16 on histone H4. Notably, in AR-lacking PC3 cells and in AR-depleted LNCaP cells, diminution of MYST1 activates the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase 3 that leads to apoptosis. In contrast, in AR-transformed PC3 cells (PC3-AR), depletion of MYST1 induces cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) N1A/p21, which results in G2M arrest. Concomitantly, the levels of phospho-retinoblastoma, E2F1, CDK4, and CDK6 are reduced. Finally, the expression of tumor protein D52 (TPD52) was unequivocally affected in PC3, PC3-AR, and LNCaP cells. Taken together, the results of this study reveal that the functional interactions of MYST1 with AR and NF-κB are critical for PCa progression.""","""['Anbalagan Jaganathan', 'Pratima Chaurasia', 'Guang-Qian Xiao', 'Marc Philizaire', 'Xiang Lv', 'Shen Yao', 'Kerry L Burnstein', 'De-Pei Liu', 'Alice C Levine', 'Shiraz Mujtaba']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Lysine Acetyltransferases and Their Role in AR Signaling and Prostate Cancer.', 'Interplay of nuclear factor-kappaB and B-myb in the negative regulation of androgen receptor expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha.', 'Tip60 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation by translocation of androgen receptor into the nucleus.', 'Identification of a negative regulatory cis-element in the enhancer core region of the prostate-specific antigen promoter: implications for intersection of androgen receptor and nuclear factor-kappaB signalling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Expression and function of androgen receptor coactivators in prostate cancer.', 'MOF negatively regulates estrogen receptor α signaling via CUL4B-mediated protein degradation in breast cancer.', 'Epigenetic Coregulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Lysine Acetyltransferases and Their Role in AR Signaling and Prostate Cancer.', 'Inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide advanced androgen receptor expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition progress in prostatitis and prostate cancer.', 'Deacetylation of Transcription Factors in Carcinogenesis.']"""

The natural ligands of TR4 remained unclear until the recent discoveries of several energy/lipid sensors including the polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and their synthetic ligands, thiazolidinediones, used for treatment of diabetes. TR4 is widely expressed throughout the body and particularly concentrated in the testis, prostate, cerebellum, and hippocampus. It has been shown to play important roles in cerebellar development, forebrain myelination, folliculogenesis, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, muscle development, bone development, and prostate cancer progression. Here we provide a comprehensive summary of TR4 signaling including its upstream ligands/activators/suppressors, transcriptional coactivators/repressors, downstream targets, and their in vivo functions with potential impacts on TR4-related diseases. Importantly, TR4 shares similar ligands/activators with another key nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, which raised several interesting questions about how these 2 nuclear receptors may collaborate with or counteract each other's function in their related diseases. Clear dissection of such molecular mechanisms and their differential roles in various diseases may help researchers to design new potential drugs with better efficacy and fewer side effects to battle TR4 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ involved diseases.""","""['Shin-Jen Lin', 'Yanqing Zhang', 'Ning-Chun Liu', 'Dong-Rong Yang', 'Gonghui Li', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Subfertility with defective folliculogenesis in female mice lacking testicular orphan nuclear receptor 4.', 'Differential roles of PPARγ vs TR4 in prostate cancer and metabolic diseases.', 'TR2 and TR4 Orphan Nuclear Receptors: An Overview.', 'Roles of testicular orphan nuclear receptors 2 and 4 in early embryonic development and embryonic stem cells.', 'Loss of testicular orphan receptor 4 impairs normal myelination in mouse forebrain.', 'Structures of human TR4LBD-JAZF1 and TR4DBD-DNA complexes reveal the molecular basis of transcriptional regulation.', 'The Role of Glucocorticoid Receptor in the Pathophysiology of Pituitary Corticotroph Adenomas.', 'Disruption of mitochondrial quality control genes promotes caspase-resistant cell survival following apoptotic stimuli.', 'Beta-catenin inhibits TR4-mediated lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via induction of Slug.', 'Nuclear Receptors as Regulators of Pituitary Corticotroph Pro-Opiomelanocortin Transcription.']"""

However, PCa status within Africa is largely unknown. We address the clinical presentation of PCa within Black South African men.  Methods:   Over 1,000 participants with or without PCa have enrolled in the Southern African Prostate Cancer Study (SAPCS). Using genome-wide profiling we establish a unique within Africa population substructure. Adjusting for age, clinical variables were assessed, compared against Black Americans and between rural and urban localities while addressing potential socio-demographic confounders.  Results:   We report a significant difference in the distribution of prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels skewed towards higher PSA levels in the PCa cases (83.0% present with a PSA ≥ 20 µg/L; median PSA = 98.8 µg/L) relative to men with no detectable PCa (18.5% present with a PSA ≥ 20 µg/L; median PSA = 9.1 µg/L). Compared with Black Americans, Black South Africans presented with significantly more aggressive disease defined by Gleason score >7 (17% and 36%, respectively) and PSA ≥ 20 µg/L (17.2% and 83.2%, respectively). We report exasperated disease aggression defined by Gleason score >7 (P = 0.0042) and poorly differentiated tumor grade (P < 0.0001) within rural versus urban localities.  Conclusion:   Black South African men present with higher PSA levels and histopathological tumor grade compared with Black Americans, which is further escalated in men from rural localities. Our data suggests that lack of PSA testing may be contributing to an aggressive PCa disease phenotype within South African men.""","""['Elizabeth A Tindall', 'L Richard Monare', 'Desiree C Petersen', 'Smit van Zyl', 'Rae-Anne Hardie', 'Alpheus M Segone', 'Philip A Venter', 'M S Riana Bornman', 'Vanessa M Hayes']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Enhancing public awareness and practice of prostate cancer screening among African men: A scoping review.', 'Baseline Prostate-specific Antigen Level in Midlife and Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Black Men.', 'Addressing the contribution of previously described genetic and epidemiological risk factors associated with increased prostate cancer risk and aggressive disease within men from South Africa.', 'Mining laboratory data to describe prostate specific antigen testing and prostate cancer in Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'Prostate-specific antigen concentration in young men: new estimates and review of the literature.', 'Knowledge and Attitudes towards Prostate Cancer and Screening among Males in Limpopo Province, South Africa.', 'Knowledge, attitude and practice on screening and early diagnosis of prostate cancer of primary health care providers in the Free State.', 'Enhancing public awareness and practice of prostate cancer screening among African men: A scoping review.', 'The profile of Black South African men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the Free State, South Africa.', 'Prostate Cancer Disparities and Management in Southern Africa: Insights into Practices, Norms and Values.']"""

Methods:   Study participants were selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) system database. The PD with a routine treatment cohort contained 38 902 patients. For each treatment cohort participant, two age- and sex-matched comparison (control) cohort participants were randomly selected. Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of PD with treatment on the subsequent risk of cancer.  Results:   The overall risk of developing cancer was significantly lower in the treatment cohort than in the patients without treatment (adjusted Hazard ratio = 0.72, 95% confidence interval = 0.68-0.76).

Methods:   The clinical data and pathological feature of 504 patients who underwent RCP for bladder cancer from January 1999 to March 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Whole mount serial section of the RCP specimens were cut transversely at 3-4 mm intervals and examined in same pathological institution.  Results:   Thirty-four out of 504 patients (6.8%) had incidental prostate cancer with a mean age of 70.3 years. 12 cases (35.2%) were diagnosed as significant disease. 4 cases were found to have apex involvement of adenocarcinoma of the prostate while in 5 cases the prostate stroma invasion by urothelial carcinoma were identified (one involved prostate apex). The mean follow-up time was 46.4±33.8 months. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 3 patients but no prostate cancer-related death during the follow-up. There was no statistical significance in cancer specific survival between the clinically significant and insignificant cancer group.  Conclusions:   The prevalence of incidental prostate cancer in RCP specimens in Chinese patients was remarkably lower than in western people. Most of the incidental prostate cancer was clinically insignificant and patient's prognosis was mainly related to the bladder cancer. Sparing the prostate apex was potentially associated with a 1.0% risk of leaving significant cancer of the prostate or urothelial carcinoma.""","""['Jiahua Pan', 'Wei Xue', 'Jianjun Sha', 'Hu Yang', 'Fan Xu', 'Hanqing Xuan', 'Dong Li', 'Yiran Huang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Relevance of prostate cancer in patients with synchronous invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma: a monocentric retrospective analysis.', 'Incidental prostate cancer in Asian men: high prevalence of incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma in Chinese patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy for treatment of bladder cancer and selection of candidates for prostate-sparing cystectomy.', 'Clinically significant prostate cancer found incidentally in radical cystoprostatectomy specimens.', 'Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma in patients with bladder cancer and their implications in the clinical practice.', 'Concomitant pathology in the prostate in cystoprostatectomy specimens: a prospective study and review.', 'Neobladder ""Function"": Tips and Tricks for Surgery and Postoperative Management.', 'Endorectal power Doppler/grayscale ultrasound-guided biopsies vs. multiparametric MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided biopsies in males with high risk of prostate cancer: A prospective cohort study.', 'Assessment of 5-year overall survival in bladder cancer patients with incidental prostate cancer identified at radical cystoprostatectomy.', 'Comparisons between magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy and standard biopsy in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: A prospective cohort study.', 'Clinical Significance of Incidental Prostatic Carcinoma on Radical Cystectomy Histology Specimens: a Clinicopathological and Survival Analysis.']"""

We previously showed that GnRH agonists exert an antitumor activity in CRPC cells; however, a link between GnRH receptors and the apoptotic machinery remains to be defined. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether, in CRPC cells, GnRH agonists might affect the expression/activity of apoptosis-related proteins and might sensitize, or resensitize, cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. We demonstrated that, in p53-positive DU145 cells, GnRH agonists: a) increase the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax; this effect is mediated by the phosphorylation (activation) of p53, triggered by the p38 MAPK; b) potentiate the antiproliferative/proapoptotic activity of docetaxel; c) resensitize docetaxel-resistant cells to the antitumor activity of the cytotoxic drug. These data indicate that GnRH agonists sensitize and, more importantly, resensitize DU145 CRPC cells to chemotherapy in a p53-dependent manner. To confirm the crucial role of p53 in the activity of GnRH agonists, experiments were performed in p53-null PC3 cells. We found that GnRH agonists fail to increase Bax expression and do not potentiate the cytotoxic activity of docetaxel.

Mitochondrion-associated protein LRPPRC interacts with MAP1S that interacts with LC3 and bridges autophagy components with microtubules and mitochondria to affect autophagy flux. Dysfunction of LRPPRC and MAP1S is associated with poor survival of ovarian cancer patients. Furthermore, elevated levels of LRPPRC predict shorter overall survival in patients with prostate adenocarcinomas or gastric cancer. To understand the role of LRPPRC in tumor development, previously we reported that LRPPRC forms a ternary complex with Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 to inhibit autophagy. Here we further show that LRPPRC maintains the stability of Parkin that mono-ubiquitinates Bcl-2 to increase Bcl-2 stability to inhibit autophagy. Under mitophagy stress, Parkin translocates to mitochondria to cause rupture of outer mitochondrial membrane and bind with exposed LRPPRC. Consequently, LRPPRC and Parkin help mitochondria being engulfed in autophagosomes to be degraded. In cells under long-term mitophagy stress, both LRPPRC and Parkin become depleted coincident with disappearance of mitochondria and final autophagy inactivation due to depletion of ATG5-ATG12 conjugates.

To date, functional studies of AR-Vs have been focused mainly on their ability to regulate gene expression independent of the full-length AR (AR-FL). Here, we showed that AR-V7 and ARv567es, two major AR-Vs, both facilitated AR-FL nuclear localization in the absence of androgen and mitigated the ability of the antiandrogen enzalutamide to inhibit AR-FL nuclear trafficking. AR-V bound to the promoter of its specific target without AR-FL, but co-occupied the promoter of canonical AR target with AR-FL in a mutually-dependent manner. AR-V expression attenuated both androgen and enzalutamide modulation of AR-FL activity/cell growth, and mitigated the in vivo antitumor efficacy of enzalutamide. Furthermore, ARv567es levels were upregulated in xenograft tumors that had acquired enzalutamide resistance. Collectively, this study highlights a dual function of AR-Vs in mediating castration resistance. In addition to trans-activating target genes independent of AR-FL, AR-Vs can serve as a ""rheostat"" to control the degree of response of AR-FL to androgen-directed therapy via activating AR-FL in an androgen-independent manner.

The derivatives were prepared by derivatization of the appropriate heterocyclic amines which were used as electrophiles to attack the coumarin ring. The structures were characterized by spectroscopic techniques including IR, NMR, 2D-NMR and MS. These derivatives were further characterized especially in terms of a potential cytotoxic and apoptogenic effect in several cancer cell lines including the breast and prostate cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, PC-3, LNCaP, and the monocytic leukemia cell line U937. Cell viability was determined after 48 h and 72 h of treatment with the novel compounds by MTT assay and the 50% inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) were determined. Out of the 8 novel compounds screened for reduced cell viability, 4c, 4d and 4e were found to be the most promising and effective ones having EC50 values that were several fold reduced when compared to the reference substance 4-hydroxycoumarin.

The breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, the prostate cancer LNCaP cells, and U937 cells were most sensitive, MCF-7 cells were less sensitive, and PC-3 cells were more resistant. Reduced cell viability was accompanied by increased apoptosis as shown by PARP-1 cleavage and reduced activity of the survival protein kinase Akt.

RAW264.7 macrophage migration was induced by conditioned media (CM) from various PCa cells in proportion to the cellular level of CCN3 expression and was inhibited by an anti-CCN3 neutralizing antibody.

Finally, PCa-secreted CCN3 stimulated RAW264.7 cells and promoted angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM), and increased tumor growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis in a PCa xenograft mouse model.

In this work, a novel multi-region segmentation approach is proposed to simultaneously segment the prostate and its two major sub-regions from only a single 3D T2-weighted (T2w) MR image, which makes use of the prior spatial region consistency and incorporates a customized prostate appearance model into the segmentation task. The formulated challenging combinatorial optimization problem is solved by means of convex relaxation, for which a novel spatially continuous max-flow model is introduced as the dual optimization formulation to the studied convex relaxed optimization problem with region consistency constraints. The proposed continuous max-flow model derives an efficient duality-based algorithm that enjoys numerical advantages and can be easily implemented on GPUs. The proposed approach was validated using 18 3D prostate T2w MR images with a body-coil and 25 images with an endo-rectal coil. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of efficiently and accurately extracting both the prostate zones: CG and PZ, and the whole prostate gland from the input 3D prostate MR images, with a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.3±3.2% for the whole gland (WG), 82.2±3.0% for the CG, and 69.1±6.9% for the PZ in 3D body-coil MR images; 89.2±3.3% for the WG, 83.0±2.4% for the CG, and 70.0±6.5% for the PZ in 3D endo-rectal coil MR images. In addition, the experiments of intra- and inter-observer variability introduced by user initialization indicate a good reproducibility of the proposed approach in terms of volume difference (VD) and coefficient-of-variation (CV) of DSC.""","""['Wu Qiu', 'Jing Yuan', 'Eranga Ukwatta', 'Yue Sun', 'Martin Rajchl', 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Efficient 3D multi-region prostate MRI segmentation using dual optimization.', 'Automated segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on T2-weighted (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map MR images using U-Nets.', 'Prostate segmentation: an efficient convex optimization approach with axial symmetry using 3-D TRUS and MR images.', 'Spatially varying accuracy and reproducibility of prostate segmentation in magnetic resonance images using manual and semiautomated methods.', 'MR Imaging of Prostate Zonal Anatomy.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Pelvic Cancers Using Deep Learning: State-of-the-Art Approaches and Challenges.', 'Fully automated multiorgan segmentation of female pelvic magnetic resonance images with coarse-to-fine convolutional neural network.', 'Prostate zonal segmentation in 1.5T and 3T T2W MRI using a convolutional neural network.', 'Molecular imaging and fusion targeted biopsy of the prostate.', 'Computer-aided Detection of Prostate Cancer with MRI: Technology and Applications.']"""

Methods:   Data from 1268 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2000 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were classified according to age (<70 or ≥70 years) at the time of prostatectomy. After matching pre-operative factors (i.e. prostate specific antigen, positive biopsy cores, Gleason score, clinical stage and D'Amico risk group), 333 patients were chosen from each group.  Results:   The percentage of pathological stage ≥T3 in those of age <70 and ≥70 years was 30.3 and 33.0%, respectively (P = 0.51).

Whether the presence of differing GSs at biopsy (eg, 4+3 and 3+3), which we term ComboGS, improves the prognosis that would be predicted based on the highest GS (eg, 4+3) because of decreased upgrading is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the odds of upgrading at time of radical prostatectomy (RP) and the risk of PCSM when ComboGS was present versus absent.  Patients and methods:   Logistic and competing risks regression were performed to assess the effect that ComboGS had on the odds of upgrading at time of RP in the index (n = 134) and validation cohorts (n = 356) and the risk of PCSM after definitive therapy in a long-term cohort (n = 666), adjusting for known predictors of these end points. We calculated and compared the area under the curve using a receiver operating characteristic analysis when ComboGS was included versus excluded from the upgrading models.  Results:   ComboGS was associated with decreased odds of upgrading (index: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.50; P = .003; validation: AOR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.51; P < .001) and added significantly to the predictive value of upgrading for the in-sample index (P = .02), validation (P = .003), and out-of-sample prediction models (P = .002).

Alternatively these patients could be closely monitored and treated only in case of disease progression (active surveillance). The aim of this paper is to develop a decision-analytic model comparing the cost-utility of active surveillance (AS) and radical prostatectomy (PE) for a cohort of 65 year old men with newly diagnosed low risk prostate cancer.  Methods:   A Markov model comparing PE and AS over a lifetime horizon was programmed in TreeAge from a German societal perspective. Comparative disease specific mortality was obtained from the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group trial. Direct costs were identified via national treatment guidelines and expert interviews covering in-patient, out-patient, medication, aids and remedies as well as out of pocket payments. Utility values were used as factor weights for age specific quality of life values of the German population. Uncertainty was assessed deterministically and probabilistically.  Results:   With quality adjustment, AS was the dominant strategy compared with initial treatment. In the base case, it was associated with an additional 0.04 quality adjusted life years (7.60 QALYs vs. 7.56 QALYs) and a cost reduction of €6,883 per patient (2011 prices). Considering only life-years gained, PE was more effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €96,420/life year gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of developing metastases under AS and utility weights under AS are a major sources of uncertainty. A Monte Carlo simulation revealed that AS was more likely to be cost-effective even under very high willingness to pay thresholds.  Conclusion:   AS is likely to be a cost-saving treatment strategy for some patients with early stage localised prostate cancer. However, cost-effectiveness is dependent on patients' valuation of health states. Better predictability of tumour progression and modified reimbursement practice would support widespread use of AS in the context of the German health care system. More research is necessary in order to reliably quantify the health benefits compared with initial treatment and account for patient preferences.""","""['Florian Koerber', 'Raphaela Waidelich', 'Björn Stollenwerk', 'Wolf Rogowski']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['The cost-effectiveness of active surveillance compared to watchful waiting and radical prostatectomy for low risk localised prostate cancer.', 'Observation versus initial treatment for men with localized, low-risk prostate cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis.', 'A decision analysis comparing 3 active surveillance protocols for the treatment of patients with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Systematic review and economic modelling of the relative clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery for removal of the prostate in men with localised prostate cancer.', ""Surveillance of Barrett's oesophagus: exploring the uncertainty through systematic review, expert workshop and economic modelling."", ""A Meal Replacement Program for the Treatment of Obesity: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis from the Swiss Payer's Perspective."", 'Active Surveillance Strategies for Low-Grade Prostate Cancer: Comparative Benefits and Cost-effectiveness.', 'Real-world Evidence to Estimate Prostate Cancer Costs for First-line Treatment or Active Surveillance.', 'Incorporating Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Biomarkers in Active Surveillance Protocols - Results From the Prospective Stockholm3 Active Surveillance Trial (STHLM3AS).', 'Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.']"""

To examine this hypothesis, androgen-dependent LNCaP cells were infected with XMRV and tested for changes in certain cell growth properties. We found that XMRV-infected LNCaP cells can proliferate in the absence of the androgen dihydrotestosterone.

Radionuclide targeting of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with 111In-labeled capromab pendetide (ProstaScint) is a clinical option for prostate cancer staging. We propose the use of 124I-labeled capromab to decrease the retention of radioactivity in healthy organs (due to the non-residualizing properties of the radiolabel). The use of 124I as a label should increase imaging sensitivity due to the advantages of PET as an imaging modality. Capromab targets the intracellular domain of PSMA; accumulation of radioactivity in the tumor should not depend on internalization of the antigen/antibody complex. Capromab was iodinated, and its targeting properties were compared with indium labeled counterpart in LNCaP xenografts in dual isotope mode. PSMA-negative xenografts (PC3) were used as a negative control. Radioiodinated capromab bound to PSMA specifically.

We have recently developed a promising drug delivery system, in which the anticancer drug daunorubicin (Dau) was attached via oxime bond to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone-III (GnRH-III) derivative used as a targeting moiety (Glp-His-Trp-Lys(Ac)-His-Asp-Trp-Lys(Da = Aoa)-Pro-Gly-NH2; Glp = pyroglutamic acid, Ac = acetyl; Aoa = aminooxyacetyl). This bioconjugate exerted in vitro cytostatic/cytotoxic effect on human breast, prostate and colon cancer cells, as well as significant in vivo tumor growth inhibitory effect on colon carcinoma bearing mice. In our previous studies, H-Lys(Dau = Aoa)-OH was identified as the smallest metabolite produced in the presence of rat liver lysosomal homogenate, which was able to bind to DNA in vitro. To get a deeper insight into the mechanism of action of the bioconjugate, changes in the protein expression profile of HT-29 human colon cancer cells after treatment with the bioconjugate or free daunorubicin were investigated by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Our results indicate that several metabolism-related proteins, molecular chaperons and proteins involved in signaling are differently expressed after targeted chemotherapeutic treatment, leading to the conclusion that the bioconjugate exerts its cytotoxic action by interfering with multiple intracellular processes.""","""['Verena Natalie Schreier', 'Lilla Pethő', 'Erika Orbán', 'Andreas Marquardt', 'Brindusa Alina Petre', 'Gábor Mező', 'Marilena Manea']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Enhanced cellular uptake and in vitro antitumor activity of short-chain fatty acid acylated daunorubicin-GnRH-III bioconjugates.', 'Improved in vivo antitumor effect of a daunorubicin - GnRH-III bioconjugate modified by apoptosis inducing agent butyric acid on colorectal carcinoma bearing mice.', 'GnRH-III based multifunctional drug delivery systems containing daunorubicin and methotrexate.', 'lGnRH-III -- a promising candidate for anticancer drug development.', 'AEZS-108 : a targeted cytotoxic analog of LHRH for the treatment of cancers positive for LHRH receptors.', 'Apoptotic Effects of Drug Targeting Conjugates Containing Different GnRH Analogs on Colon Carcinoma Cells.', 'Overcharging Effect in Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectra of Daunomycin-Tuftsin Bioconjugates.', 'Advances in Development of New Treatment for Leishmaniasis.']"""

Response rates with chemotherapy are modest and disease progression is usually observed within months of stopping treatment.  Case presentation:   We present a case of a 72-year-old White man of British origin with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer with bulky lymphadenopathy and a serum prostate-specific antigen of 295 μg/L. He received treatment with docetaxel chemotherapy plus prednisolone, but received just 3 cycles before treatment was stopped due to toxicity and lack of response (prostate-specific antigen was 276 μg/L 4 weeks after the last dose and there was a confirmed stable appearance on computed tomography scan). Unexpectedly, at follow-up 4 months later, the patient was clinically better; his prostate-specific antigen had dramatically improved to 4.1 μg/L and a re-staging computed tomography scan revealed complete resolution of his bulky lymphadenopathy. At the time, he was receiving a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue but no other disease-modulating treatment. He remains well and asymptomatic, with his most recent serum prostate-specific antigen measuring 0.14 μg/L, 18 months after last receiving chemotherapy.

Results:   Treatment with different deuterium concentrations of DDW alone did not impose any significant inhibitory effects on growth of cell lines. Paclitaxel significantly decreased the survival fractions of all cell lines. DDW augmented paclitaxel inhibitory effects on breast, prostate, stomach cancer and glioblastoma cell lines, with influence being more pronounced in breast and prostate cases.  Conclusions:   DDW per se does not appear to have inhibitory effects on the assessed tumor cell lines as well as normal fibroblasts.

Materials and methods:   This study was done by face to face questionnaire in the 27th National Nephrology Congress to determine if the physicians dealing with chronic renal failure, hemodialysis or renal transplanted patients, recommend cancer screening or not and the methods of screening for cervix, prostate, breast and colon cancer.  Results:   One hundred and fifty six physicians were included in the survey. A total of 105 (67%) participants were male and the age of responders was 48 ± 9 years. About 29% were specialists in nephrology, 28% internal medicine, and 5% were other areas of expertise. Some 48% of participants were hemodialysis certified general practitioners. Patients were grouped as compensated chronic renal failure, hemodialysis or renal transplanted. Of the 156 responders, 128 (82%) physicians recommended breast cancer screening and the most recommended subgroup was hemodialysis patients (15%). The most preferred methods of screening were combinations of mammography, self breast examination and physician breast examination. 112 (72%) physicians recommended cervix cancer screening, and the most preferred method of screening was pap-smear. Colon cancer screening was recommended by 102 (65%) physicians and prostate screening by 109 (70%) physicians. The most preferred methods of screening were fecal occult blood test and PSA plus rectal digital test, respectively.

This study investigated the expression of RABEX-5 in prostate cancer by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and evaluated its association with clinicopathological variables, including prostate cancer patient prognosis.  Methods:   A total of 180 patients with primary prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy were enrolled. Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was utilized to investigate mRNA expression level of RABEX-5 in 180 paired prostate cancer/adjacent non-cancerous tissues. RABEX-5 mRNA expression was divided into high expression group and low expression group and correlations between RABEX-5 mRNA and clinicopathological factors were then evaluated. Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to analyze the association between RABEX-5 mRNA expression and prognosis of patients with prostate cancer.  Results:   Our study showed that RABEX-5 mRNA was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues. The data indicated that high expression of RABEX-5 mRNA was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001), clinical stage (P = 0.004), biochemical recurrence (P = 0.009), preoperative prostate-specific antigen (P < 0.001), and Gleason score (P < 0.001). High RABEX-5 mRNA expression was a significant predictor of poor biochemical recurrence free survival and overall survival both in univariate and multivariate analysis.  Conclusion:   This is to our knowledge the first report investigating tumor RABEX-5 mRNA expression level in prostate cancer.

Postoperative complications, blood transfusions, prolonged length of stay (pLOS), readmission, additional cancer therapies, and costs of care within the first year after surgery were compared between the two surgical approaches. To decrease the effect of unmeasured confounders, instrumental variable analysis was performed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were then performed.  Results:   Overall, 2,439 patients (41.2%) and 3,476 patients (58.8%) underwent ORP and RARP, respectively. In multivariable analyses, patients undergoing RARP had similar odds of overall complications, readmission, and additional cancer therapies compared with patients undergoing ORP. However, RARP was associated with a higher probability of experiencing 30- and 90-day genitourinary and miscellaneous medical complications (all P ≤ .02). Additionally, RARP led to a lower risk of experiencing blood transfusion and of having a pLOS (all P < .001). Finally, first-year reimbursements were greater for patients undergoing RARP compared with ORP (P < .001).  Conclusion:   RARP and ORP have comparable rates of complications and additional cancer therapies, even in the postdissemination era. Although RARP was associated with lower risk of blood transfusions and a slightly shorter length of stay, these benefits do not translate to a decrease in expenditures.""","""['Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Jesse D Sammon', 'Steven L Chang', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Jim C Hu', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Simon P Kim', 'Ramdev Konijeti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Shyam Sukumar', 'Mani Menon', 'Maxine Sun', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Limitations of assessing value in robotic surgery for prostate cancer: what data should patients and physicians use to make the best decision?', 'Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy: results from the nationwide inpatient sample.', 'Is robot-assisted radical prostatectomy safe in men with high-risk prostate cancer?

Older men and men with significant comorbidity may be more susceptible to the harms of ADT, therefore we aimed to determine whether these men benefit from ADT.  Methods:   The adult comorbidity evaluation-27 index categorized severity of comorbidity in 636 men treated for IR-PrCa with dose-escalated EBRT (>75 Gy). The cohort was dichotomized at median age of 70. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis evaluated the association of ADT with failure-free survival (FFS) for each age and comorbidity subgroup.  Results:   A total of 48% of men were 70 years and above. After adjustment for tumor characteristics, the addition of ADT to EBRT was associated with improved FFS for both men below 70 years of age (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.99; P=0.046) and men 70 years and above (AHR 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.91; P=0.035). ADT improved FFS for men below 70 years who had no or mild comorbidity (AHR 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09-0.73; P=0.011) but not for men below 70 years who had moderate or severe comorbidity (AHR 1.62; 95% CI, 0.35-7.49; P=0.537). Similarly, in men 70 years and above, there was a trend for improved FFS with ADT in healthy men (AHR 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-1.08; P=0.058) but not in men with moderate to severe comorbidity (AHR 0.38; 95% CI, 0.06-2.56; P=0.318).

Results:   There were U-shaped associations of vitamin D with total cancer risk: compared with the first quintile, HRs were 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-1.03; P = 0.092], 0.74 (95% CI, 0.59-0.92; P = 0.008), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.69-1.07; P = 0.181), and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.78-1.21; P = 0.823), for the second through fifth quintiles, respectively.

Transgenic expression of 15-LOX2 in the mouse prostate surprisingly causes hyperplasia. Here we first provide evidence that 15-LOX2-induced prostatic hyperplasia does not progress to PCa even in p53(+/-) or p53(-/-) background. More important, by generating 15-LOX2; Hi-Myc double transgenic (dTg) mice, we show that 15-LOX2 expression inhibits Myc-induced PCa development, such that in the 3-month- and 6-month-old dTg mice, there is a significant reduction in prostate intraneoplasia (PIN) and PCa prevalent in age-matched Hi-Myc prostates. The dTg prostates show increased cell senescence and expression of several senescence-associated molecules, including p27, phosphorylated Rb, and Rb1cc1. We further show that in HPCa, 15-LOX2 and c-Myc manifest reciprocal protein expression patterns. Moreover, RB1CC1 accumulates in senescing normal human prostate (NHP) cells, and in both NHP and RWPE-1 cells, the 15-LOX2 metabolic products 15(S)-HPETE and 15(S)-HETE induce RB1CC1. We finally show that unlike 15-LOX2, RB1CC1 is not lost but rather frequently overexpressed in PCa samples. RB1CC1 knockdown in PC3 cells enhances clonal growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.

The unique properties of metastases are critical to understand to improve treatments of the disease that remains in patients after debulking surgery. We sought to identify the genetic and phenotypic landscape of metastatic progression of EOC to understand how metastases compare to primary tumors. DNA copy number and mRNA expression differences between matched primary human tumors and omental metastases, collected at the same time during debulking surgery before chemotherapy, were measured using microarrays. qPCR and immunohistochemistry validated findings. Pathway analysis of mRNA expression revealed metastatic cancer cells are more proliferative and less apoptotic than primary tumors, perhaps explaining the aggressive nature of these lesions. Most cases had copy number aberrations (CNAs) that differed between primary and metastatic tumors, but we did not detect CNAs that are recurrent across cases. A six gene expression signature distinguishes primary from metastatic tumors and predicts overall survival in independent datasets. The genetic differences between primary and metastatic tumors, yet common expression changes, suggest that the major clone in metastases is not the same as in primary tumors, but the cancer cells adapt to the omentum similarly.

Our objectives were to assess 30-day outcomes after TURP and PVP with respect to trainee involvement using an independent national surgical database.  Methods:   Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) data (2005-2011), 7893 men were identified who underwent TURP or PVP. Regression models were constructed to assess associations between surgical approach, risk-adjusted morbidity and individual complications. Relationships between operative approach, operative duration and duration of stay were also examined and subdivided based upon trainee level.  Results:   Of 7893 patients, 4950 (62.7%) underwent TURP and 2943 (37.3%) underwent PVP. TURP patients were older, more likely to have diabetes, cancer, history of steroid use and preoperative transfusion compared with PVP patients, who were more likely to have coronary artery disease or bleeding disorders. Risk-adjusted overall morbidity was similar; however, PVP was associated with less pneumonia (0.2% vs 0.5%, P<0.015), bleeding requiring transfusion (0.5% vs 1.8%, P<0.001) and return to the operating room (1.5% vs 2.2%, P<0.022). PVP patients also had shorter length of stay (0.8 vs 2.1 days, P<0.001). There were no significant differences in outcomes when a trainee was involved. Operative duration was similar for TURP and PVP when performed by an attending alone (52 vs 52 min, P<0.001), but was longer with trainee involvement, regardless of post-graduate year (PGY) level (P<0.001). Comparison of operative duration among trainee subgroups demonstrated longer operative times for the PGY 6-9 subgroup performing PVP when compared with other subgroups (P<0.003).

Since PGs are only emitted while the beam is on, the feasibility of using PGs for online treatment verification depends greatly on the design of highly efficient detectors. The purpose of this work is to characterize how PG detection changes as a function of distance from the patient as a means of guiding the design and usage of clinical PG imaging detectors. Using a Monte Carlo model (GEANT4.9.4) we studied the detection rate (PGs per incident proton) of a high purity germanium detector for both the total PG emission and the characteristic 6.13 MeV PG emission from (16)O emitted during proton irradiation. The PG detection rate was calculated as a function of distance from the isocenter of the proton treatment nozzle for: (1) a water phantom irradiated with a proton pencil beam and (2) a prostate patient irradiated with a scanning beam proton therapy treatment field (lateral field size: ∼6 cm × 6 cm, beam range: 23.5 cm). An analytical expression of the PG detection rate as a function of distance from isocenter, detector size, and proton beam energy was then developed. The detection rates were found to be 1.3 × 10(-6) for oxygen and 3.9 × 10(-4) for the total PG emission, respectively, with the detector placed 11 cm from isocenter for a 40 MeV pencil beam irradiating a water phantom. The total PG detection rate increased by ∼85 ± 3% for beam energies greater than 150 MeV. The detection rate was found to be approximately 2.1 × 10(-6) and 1.7 × 10(-3) for oxygen and total PG emission, respectively, during delivery of a single pencil beam during a scanning beam treatment for prostate cancer. The PG detection rate as a function of distance from isocenter during irradiation of a water phantom with a single proton pencil beam was described well by the model of a point source irradiating a cylindrical detector of a known diameter over the range of beam energies commonly used for proton therapy. For the patient studies, it was necessary to divide the point source equation by an exponential factor in order to correctly predict the falloff of the PG detection rate as a function of distance from isocenter.""","""['Jerimy C Polf', 'Dennis Mackin', 'Eunsin Lee', 'Stephen Avery', 'Sam Beddar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Imaging of prompt gamma rays emitted during delivery of clinical proton beams with a Compton camera: feasibility studies for range verification.', 'Measurement of characteristic prompt gamma rays emitted from oxygen and carbon in tissue-equivalent samples during proton beam irradiation.', 'The effects of Doppler broadening and detector resolution on the performance of three-stage Compton cameras.', 'Proton therapy verification with PET imaging.', 'Proton beam and prostate cancer: An evolving debate.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Specific Cellular DNA Damage Response and Repair Induced by the Mixed Radiation Field During Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.', 'PIBS: Proton and ion beam spectroscopy for in vivo measurements of oxygen, carbon, and calcium concentrations in the human body.', 'Compact Method for Proton Range Verification Based on Coaxial Prompt Gamma-Ray Monitoring: a Theoretical Study.', 'A Monte Carlo feasibility study for neutron based real-time range verification in proton therapy.', 'Assessment of Geant4 Prompt-Gamma Emission Yields in the Context of Proton Therapy Monitoring.']"""

A relatively high number of CTCs has been correlated with disease progression and poorer prognosis. This study was designed to assess innate immune system function, known to be responsible for the immune defense against developing neoplasms, in metastatic cancer patients with CTCs. Our aim is to provide a link between indication of poorer prognosis, represented by the number of CTCs to the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells, an important component of the innate immune system, and to represent a promising expanded approach to management of metastatic cancer patients with CTCs. Seventy-four patients, with metastatic breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer, were recruited for this study. Using a flow cytometric assay, we measured natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity against K562 target cells; and CTCs were enumerated using the CellSearch System. Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 expression was also determined by flow cytometry. We found that within each of our three metastatic cancer patient groups, NK cell cytotoxic activity was decreased in patients with a relatively high number of CTCs in peripheral blood compared to patients with a relatively low number of CTCs. In the breast and prostate cancer group, patients with CTCs greater than 5 had decreased NK cell cytotoxicity when compared to patients with less than 5 CTCs. In the colorectal cancer group, we found that 3 or more CTCs in the blood was the level at which NK cell cytotoxicity is diminished. Additionally, we found that the toll-like receptors 2 and 4 expression was decreased in intensity in all the metastatic cancer patients when compared to the healthy controls. Furthermore, within each cancer group, the expression of both toll-like receptors was decreased in the patients with relatively high number of CTCs, i.e. greater than 5 for the breast and prostate cancer group and greater than 3 for the colorectal cancer group, compared to the patients with relatively low number, i.e. less than 5 or 3, respectively.

Previous research found that a single comprehensive oxidative balance score (OBS) that includes individual pro- and anti-oxidant exposures may be associated with various conditions (including prostate cancer) in the absence of associations with the individual factors. We investigated an OBS-incident prostate cancer association among 43,325 men in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort.  Methods:   From 1999-2007, 3386 incident cases were identified. Twenty different components, used in two ways (unweighted or weighted based on literature reviews), were incorporated into the OBS, and the resulting scores were then expressed as three types of variables (continuous, quartiles, or six equal intervals). Multivariable-adjusted rate ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   We hypothesized that the OBS would be inversely associated with prostate cancer risk; however, the rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) comparing the highest with the lowest OBS categories ranged from 1.17 (1.04-1.32) to 1.39 (0.90-2.15) for all cases, 1.14 (0.87-1.50) to 1.59 (0.57-4.40) for aggressive disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III/IV or Gleason score 8-10), and 0.91 (0.62-1.35) to 1.02 (1.02-1.04) for nonaggressive disease.

Methods and materials:   We analyzed 213 patients treated with I125 seed brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer. BMI and rectal dosimetry data for all patients were available. Data on visceral and subcutaneous fat distribution at the level of the iliac crest (n = 140) as well as the distribution of periprostatic and subcutaneous fat at the symphysis pubis level were obtained (n = 117). Fat distribution was manually contoured on CT on day 30 after brachytherapy. The correlation between BMI, fat distribution and rectal dose (R100 (in cc), R150 (cc), D2 (Gy)) was analyzed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Differences in rectal dose between tertiles of body fat distribution were calculated using nonparametric tests.  Results:   Periprostatic adipose was only weakly correlated with BMI (r = 0.0.245, p = 0.008) and only weakly correlated with the other fat measurements (r = 0.31-0.37, p < 0.001). On the other hand, BMI was correlated with all other fat measurements (≥0.58, p < 0.001). All the other fat measurements were strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.5-0.87, p < 0.001). Patients with an R100 of >1.3 cc (23% of patients) had less visceral fat (p = 0.004), less subcutaneous fat at the level of the iliac crest (p = 0.046) and a lower BMI (26.8 kg/m2 vs. 28.5 kg/m2, p = 0.02) than patients with an R100 of <1.3 cc. Results were very similar when comparing an R100 of >1.0 cc (34% of patients) across the tertiles. None of the tested linear regression models were predictive (max 12%) of dose to the rectum.

Patients and methods:   Between January 2000 and December 2011, 160 patients underwent AMS 800 AUS implantation in our institution. We excluded neurological and traumatic causes, implantation on ileal conduit diversion, penoscrotal urethral cuff position and those lost to follow-up. In all, 122 patients were included in the study, 61 with prior RT and 61 without prior RT. All patients underwent the same surgical technique by two different surgeons. All AUS were implanted with a bulbar urethral cuff position. The mean (range) follow-up was 37.25 (1-126) months.  Results:   In the patients without prior RT and those with prior RT, revision rates were 32.8% vs 29.5%, respectively (P = 0.59). The median time to first revision was 11.7 months. Early complications were similar in the two groups (4.9% vs 6.5%, P = 1). Erosion rates were not significantly different (4.9% vs 13.1%, P = 0.13). However, infection and explantation were more prevalent in patients with prior RT [two (3.2%) vs 10 (16.3%), P = 0.018 and three (4.9%) vs 12 (19.6%), P = 0.016, respectively].

The specific objective of this retrospective study was to analyze the longitudinal trends of prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and survival in Shanghai from 2000 to 2009.  Methods:   A retrospective population-based cohort study was performed using data from a central district (Putuo) and a suburban district (Jiading) of Shanghai. Records of all prostate cancer cases reported to the Shanghai Cancer Registry from 2000 to 2009 for the two districts were reviewed. Prostate cancer outcomes were ascertained by matching cases with individual mortality data (up to 2010) from the National Death Register. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze factors associated with prostate cancer survival.  Results:   A total of 1022 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed from 2000 to 2009. The average age of patients was 75 years. A rapid increase in incidence occurred during the study period. Compared with the year 2000, 2009 incidence was 3.28 times higher in Putuo and 5.33 times higher in Jiading. Prostate cancer mortality declined from 4.45 per 105 individuals per year in 2000 to 1.94 per 105 in 2009 in Putuo and from 5.45 per 105 to 3.5 per 105 in Jiading during the same period. One-year and 5-year prostate cancer survival rates were 95% and 56% in Putuo, and 88% and 51% in Jiading, respectively. Staging of disease, Karnofsky Performance Scale Index, and selection of chemotherapy were three independent factors influencing the survival of prostate cancer patients.  Conclusions:   The prostate cancer incidence increased rapidly from 2000 to 2009, and prostate cancer survival rates decreased in urban and suburban Chinese populations.

Patients and methods:   Between December 2005 and August 2010, 1103 men underwent 3D14PBx at our institutions and were analysed prospectively. Biopsy criteria included a PSA level of 2.5-20 ng/mL or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, or both. The primary endpoint of the study was diagnostic performance and the secondary endpoint was safety. We applied recursive partitioning to the entire study cohort to delineate the unique contribution of each sampling site to overall and clinically significant cancer detection.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 503 of the 1103 patients (45.6%). Age, family history of prostate cancer, DRE, PSA, percentage of free PSA and prostate volume were associated with the positive biopsy results significantly and independently. Of the 503 cancers detected, 39 (7.8%) were clinically locally advanced (≥cT3a), 348 (69%) had a biopsy Gleason score (GS) of ≥7, and 463 (92%) met the definition of biopsy-based significant cancer. Recursive partitioning analysis showed that each sampling site contributed uniquely to both the overall and the biopsy-based significant cancer detection rate of the 3D14PBx method. The overall cancer-positive rate of each sampling site ranged from 14.5% in the transrectal far lateral base to 22.8% in the transrectal far lateral apex. As of August 2010, 210 patients (42%) had undergone radical prostatectomy, of whom 55 (26%) were found to have pathologically non-organ-confined disease, 174 (83%) had prostatectomy GS ≥7 and 185 (88%) met the definition of prostatectomy-based significant cancer.  Conclusions:   This is the first prospective analysis of the diagnostic performance of an extended biopsy method, which is a simplified version of the somewhat redundant super-extended three-dimensional 26-core biopsy.

Our institutional radical prostatectomy database (1992-2012) was queried and the results were stratified into D'Amico low-, intermediate- and high risk, PSA-incongruent intermediate-risk and PSA-incongruent high-risk cases. Prostate cancer (PCa) features and outcomes were evaluated using appropriate comparative tests. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, race and year of surgery.  Results:   Of the total cohort of 17 608 men, 1132 (6.4%) had PII-risk disease and 183 (1.0%) had PIH-risk disease. Compared with the low-risk group, the odds of upgrading at radical prostatectomy (RP) were 2.20 (95% CI 1.93-2.52; P < 0.001) for the PII group and 3.58 (95% CI 2.64-4.85; P < 0.001) for the PIH group, the odds of extraprostatic disease at RP were 2.35 (95% CI 2.05-2.68; P < 0.001) for the PII group and 6.68 (95% CI 4.89-9.15; P < 0.001) for the PIH group, and the odds of positive surgical margins were 1.97 (95% CI 1.67-2.33; P < 0.001) for the PII group and 3.54 (95% CI 2.50-4.95, P < 0.001) for the PIH group. Compared with low-risk disease, PII-risk disease was associated with a 2.85-, 2.99- and 3.32-fold greater risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastasis and PCa-specific mortality, respectively, and PIH-risk disease was associated with a 5.32-, 6.14- and 7.07-fold greater risk of BCR, metastasis and PCa-specific mortality, respectively (P ≤ 0.001 for all comparisons). For the PII group, the higher risks of positive surgical margins, upgrading, upstaging and BCR were dependent on PSA density (PSAD): men in the PII group who had a PSAD <0.15 ng/mL/g were not at higher risk compared with those in the low-risk group. Men in the PII group with a PSAD ≥0.15 ng/mL/g and men in the PIH group were more likely to have an anterior component of the dominant tumour (59 and 64%, respectively) compared with those in the low- (35%) and intermediate-risk group (39%) and those in the PII-risk group with PSAD <0.15 ng/mL/g (29%).  Conclusions:   Men with PSA >20 ng/mL or men with PSA >10 and ≤20 ng/mL with a PSAD ≥0.15 ng/mL/g, but otherwise low-risk PCa, are at greater risk of adverse pathological and oncological outcomes and may be inappropriate candidates for active surveillance. These men are at greater risk of having anterior tumours that are undersampled at biopsy, so if treatment is deferred, ancillary testing such as anterior zone sampling or magnetic resonance imaging should be strongly encouraged.

However, the association between Hb and serum estradiol is incompletely known.  Objective:   To determine whether estradiol is associated with anemia/Hb and established determinants of Hb in elderly men without prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   The MrOS (Osteoporotic Fractures in Men) is a population-based study (n = 918; median age, 75.3 y; range, 70-81 y).  Main outcome measures:   We evaluated total estradiol in relation to Hb and adjusted for potential confounders (ie, age, body mass index [BMI], erythropoietin [EPO], total T, cystatin C, and iron and B-vitamin status).  Results:   Estradiol correlated negatively with age (r = -0.14; P < .001). Hb correlated (age adjusted) positively with estradiol (r = 0.21; P < .001) and T (r = 0.10; P < .01). Independent predictors for Hb in multivariate analyses were estradiol, EPO, BMI, transferrin saturation, cystatin C, and free T4, but not T. After exclusion of subjects with Hb <130 g/L and/or T < 8 nmol/L (n = 99), the correlation between Hb and T was no longer significant, whereas the associations between Hb and estradiol remained. After adjusting for age, BMI, and EPO, men with lower estradiol levels were more likely to have Hb in the lowest quartile of values (odds ratio per SD decrease in estradiol = 1.61 [95% confidence interval, 1.34-1.93]). Anemic subjects (Hb < 130 g/L) had lower mean estradiol than nonanemic subjects (67.4 vs 79.4 pmol/L; P < .001).  Conclusions:   Estradiol correlated positively and independently with Hb.

The therapeutic index can be improved through use of nanocarrier systems to target cancer cells efficiently. We developed a unique strategy to deliver a platinum(IV) drug to prostate cancer cells by constructing glutathione-stabilized (Au@GSH) gold nanoparticles. Glutathione (GSH) has well-known antioxidant properties, which lead to cancer regression. Here, we exploit the advantages of both the antioxidant properties and high surface-area-to-volume ratio of Au@GSH NPs to demonstrate their potential for delivery of a platinum(IV) drug by targeting the neuropilin-1 receptor (Nrp-1). A lethal dose of a platinum(IV) drug functionalized with the Nrp-1-targeting peptide (CRGDK) was delivered specifically to prostate cancer cells in vitro. Targeted peptide ensures specific binding to the Nrp-1 receptor, leading to enhanced cellular uptake level and cell toxicity. The nanocarriers were themselves nontoxic, but exhibited high cytotoxicity and increased efficacy when functionalized with the targeting peptide and drug. The uptake of drug-loaded nanocarriers is dependent on the interaction with Nrp-1 in cell lines expressing high (PC-3) and low (DU-145) levels of Nrp-1, as confirmed through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy. The nanocarriers have effective anticancer activity, through upregulation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) protein (p50 and p65) expression and activation of NF-κB-DNA-binding activity.

Material and methods:   Forty-six consecutive patients with CRPC following first line hormone therapy who were treated with flutamide as secondary hormone therapy were prospectively assessed with a median follow-up of 21 months. Serum chromogranin A (CgA), as a marker of NED, was measured using an immunoradiometric assay.  Results:   Of the 46 patients, 22 (48%) responded to the secondary hormone therapy as a 50% or more reduction from baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) with a median response duration of 9.2 months. The PSA response group was correlated with significantly favorable cancer-specific survival (CSS) (92% vs 59% at 5 years, p = 0.0146) compared with the non-response group. Above-normal CgA levels at study entry were detected in 15 patients (33%), but no association with CSS was identified. Data on CgA kinetics were available in 35 patients. The CgA levels before and at 3 months during the treatment were similar. However, eight patients (23%) with an increase in CgA level of a quarter or more from baseline had a tendency for worse CSS (63% vs 84% at 5 years, p = 0.0507) compared with the remaining patients.  Conclusion:   Within limitations, in this study secondary hormone therapy with flutamide was effective for CRPC following first line hormone therapy.

Here, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were investigated regarding their impact on cellular function, cellular uptake and ability to sensitize cancer cells of urological origin to the conventional chemotherapeutics cisplatin and carboplatin. CNFs and CNTs (1-200 microg/ml) showed a low to moderate impairment of cellular function with CNFs being more deleterious than CNTs. Inhibition of cellular viability by the nanomaterials was about 20% at most. In combinatory treatments, CNFs and CNTs markedly enhanced the effects of cisplatin and carboplatin on cellular viability by 1.2- to 2.8-fold in prostate, bladder and cisplatin-resistant prostate cancer cells in comparison to the individual effects of the chemotherapeutics. Particularly the cell viability-diminishing effect of CNFs alone and in combination with the chemotherapeutics was more pronounced with dispersions prepared with human serum albumin than with phospholipid-polyethylene glycol. Albumin might mediate the cellular uptake of carbon nanomaterials which was underlined by the co-localization of albumin and carbon nanomaterials along the cellular surface as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy.

Methods:   We adopted 109 items as the quality indicators of high-precision radiotherapy to prepare a questionnaire. In April 2012, we started to publicly open the questionnaire on the website, requesting every institution with radiotherapy machines for response. The response ratio was 62.1% (490 out of 789 institutions responded).  Results:   Two or more radiotherapy technologists per linear accelerator managed linear accelerator operation in ∼90% of the responded institutions while medical physicists/radiotherapy quality managers were engaged in the operation in only 64.9% of the institutions. Radiotherapy certified nurses also worked in only 18.4% of the institutions. The ratios of the institutions equipped for stereotactic radiotherapy of lung tumor, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and image-guided radiotherapy were 43.3, 32.6 and 46.8%, respectively. In intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning, radiation oncologists were usually responsible for delineation while medical physicists/radiotherapy quality managers or radiotherapy technologists set up beam in 33.3% of the institutions. The median time required for quality assurance of intensity-modulated radiotherapy at any site of brain, head and neck and prostate was 4 h. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy quality assurance activity had to be started after clinical hours in >60% of the institutions.

In this study NOTA-conjugated MATBBN was labeled by the Al(18)F method and the potential of (18)F-Al-NOTA-MATBBN for prostate tumor PET imaging was also evaluated. NOTA-MATBBN was radiolabeled with (18) F using Al(18)F complexes. Partition coefficient, in vitro stability and GRPR binding affinity were also determined. PET studies were performed with (18)F-Al-NOTA-MATBBN in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice. (18)F-Al-NOTA-MATBBN can be produced within 30 min with a decay-corrected yield of 62.5 ± 2.1% and a radiochemical purity of >98%. The logP octanol-water value for the Al(18)F-labeled BBN analog was -2.40 ± 0.07 and the radiotracer was stable in phosphate-buffered saline and human serum for 2 h. The IC50 values of displacement for the (18)F-Al-NOTA-MATBBN with MATBBN was 126.9 ± 2.75 nm. The PC-3 tumors were clearly visible with high contrast after injection of the labeled peptide. At 60 min post-injection, the tumor uptakes for (18)F-Al-NOTA-MATBBN and (18)F-FDG were 4.59 ± 0.43 and 1.98 ± 0.35% injected dose/g, and tumor to muscle uptake radios for two tracers were 6.77 ± 1.10 and 1.78 ± 0.32, respectively.

This study identified factors associated with 25-OH vitamin D levels and whether vitamin D supplementation with 800 IU/day raised vitamin D levels in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Data sources:   We recruited 108 men treated with ADT for ≥9 months from eight cancer and urology practices. Sections of the NHANES 2005-2006 questionnaire and Canadian Fitness Survey were completed identifying age, ethnicity, length of ADT use, calcium supplementation ≥1000 IU mg/day, body mass index, exercise, alcohol and tobacco use, and vitamin D supplementation ≥800 IU/daily. Blood was collected for 25-OH vitamin D analysis.  Conclusions:   The majority of men (66%) had blood levels of 25-OH vitamin D <32 ng/mL.

However, because of intrinsic and acquired resistances to taxanes, their therapeutical efficiencies are modest, bringing only a few months of survival benefit. Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) promotes cancer cell resistance to various anticancer treatments, including taxanes. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism of taxane resistance by YB-1 and examined overcoming resistance by targeting YB-1 signaling.  Methods:   Gene and protein expression levels were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. We evaluated the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to taxanes using cytotoxicity assays.  Results:   Natural taxane paclitaxel from Taxus brevifolia activated the Raf-1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, leading to an activation of ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK)/YB-1 signaling. Activated Raf-1/ERK pathway was blunted by YB-1 knockdown in prostate cancer cells, indicating regulation between Raf-1/ERK signaling and YB-1. In addition, ERK or RSK was activated in taxane-resistant prostate cancer cells, resulting in YB-1 activation. YB-1 knockdown as well as RSK inhibition using RSK-specific siRNA or the small molecule inhibitor SL0101 successfully blocked activation of YB-1, leading to suppression of prostate cancer growth and sensitization to paclitaxel.

While NEDD9 plays a crucial role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the functional mechanism underlying NEDD9-mediated EMT in prostate cancer (PCa) remains uncertain.  Methods:   The expression levels of NEDD9 and its downstream molecules in PC-3, LNCaP, and VCaP cells exposed to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were determined by western blotting. The invasion of these cells with ectopic overexpression of NEDD9 or silencing of NEDD9 expression was measured by transwell invasion assay. Human tissue samples comprising 45 PCa specimens and ten specimens of normal prostatic tissue were used for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of NEDD9 expression.  Results:   Both NEDD9 and its downstream signaling molecules associated with EMT were strongly induced by TGF-β in PCa cells. PC-3 cells with stable overexpression of NEDD9 had a mesenchymal phenotype and significantly enhanced cell invasion, despite their decreased cell proliferation. Knockdown of endogenous NEDD9 expression completely diminished TGF-β-triggered tumor invasion in several PCa cell lines. The IHC data revealed a significant positive correlation between the NEDD9 staining score and tumor aggressiveness (e.g., Gleason grade, serum PSA level). The NEDD9 staining score in primary PCa with bone metastasis was significantly higher than that in PCa without metastasis.

Partners' distress in this context leads to psychological morbidity which is poorly understood. Given the prevalence of prostate cancer diagnoses in older men, partners' distress represents a public health concern. This study elucidates an important aspect of partners' distress which has hitherto been undocumented. It can lead to further research and health-care provisions that will support couples in prostate cancer survivorship towards improved mental health and health outcomes.  Purpose:   Partner sexual function has been viewed as a factor in men's erectile function recovery after prostatectomy for prostate cancer. However, patients' and partners' perceptions on the role of the partner in couples' sexual recovery has not been studied. We wanted to understand those perceptions and to see whether their perceptions were congruent.  Methods:   Men and partners were recruited from a previous study and interviewed separately about the role of the partner. Interview transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory with the help of NVivo software.  Results:   Ten men and nine partners participated; most were more than 1 year past surgery. Men were 62, and partners were 58 years old on average. Nine men had erectile dysfunction. Six female partners were post-menopausal, and a participating male partner had post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction. Men and partners agreed that partners provide emotional and logistical support. Both perceived the partner's own sexual interest, not function, as critical to the couple's sexual recovery. Some men felt pressured by partners' initiative, feeling insecure about sexual performance. Men were unaware of partners' sexual needs or needs for support. Partners expressed those needs but were unsure of what kind of support they needed.

Although β-catenin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations are well established and are known to drive tumorigenesis, discoveries of mutations in other components of the pathway lagged, which hinders the understanding of cancer mechanisms. Here we report that δ-catenin (gene designation: CTNND2), a primarily neural member of the β-catenin superfamily that promotes canonical Wnt/β-catenin/LEF-1-mediated transcription, displays exonic mutations in human prostate cancer and promotes cancer cell survival adaptation and metabolic reprogramming. When overexpressed in cells derived from prostate tumor xenografts, δ-catenin gene invariably gives rise to mutations, leading to sequence disruptions predicting functional alterations. Ectopic δ-catenin gene integrating into host chromosomes is locus nonselective. δ-Catenin mutations promote tumor development in mouse prostate with probasin promoter (ARR2PB)-driven, prostate-specific expression of Myc oncogene, whereas mutant cells empower survival advantage upon overgrowth and glucose deprivation. Reprogramming energy utilization accompanies the downregulation of glucose transporter-1 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage while preserving tumor type 2 pyruvate kinase expression. δ-Catenin mutations increase β-catenin translocation to the nucleus and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) expression. Therefore, introducing δ-catenin mutations is an important milestone in prostate cancer metabolic adaptation by modulating β-catenin and HIF-1α signaling under glucose shortage to amplify its tumor-promoting potential.""","""['J Nopparat', 'J Zhang', 'J-P Lu', 'Y-H Chen', 'D Zheng', 'P D Neufer', 'J M Fan', 'H Hong', 'C Boykin', 'Q Lu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Intratumor δ-catenin heterogeneity driven by genomic rearrangement dictates growth factor dependent prostate cancer progression.', 'Hypoxia induced δ-Catenin to enhance mice hepatocellular carcinoma progression via Wnt signaling.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'Interaction of the Wnt/β-catenin and RAS-ERK pathways involving co-stabilization of both β-catenin and RAS plays important roles in the colorectal tumorigenesis.', 'Roles and regulation of Wnt signaling and beta-catenin in prostate cancer.', 'p120-catenin subfamily members have distinct as well as shared effects on dendrite morphology during neuron development in vitro.', 'The Driverless Triple-Wild-Type (BRAF, RAS, KIT) Cutaneous Melanoma: Whole Genome Sequencing Discoveries.', 'Delta-catenin attenuates medulloblastoma cell invasion by targeting EMT pathway.', 'Delta-Catenin as a Modulator of Rho GTPases in Neurons.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.']"""

In prostate cancer, several lncRNAs have been nominated as critical actors in disease pathogenesis. Among these, expression of PCGEM1 and PRNCR1 has been identified as a possible component in disease progression through the coordination of androgen receptor (AR) signaling (Yang et al., Nature 2013, see ref. [1]). However, concerns regarding the robustness of these findings have been suggested. Here, we sought to evaluate whether PCGEM1 and PRNCR1 are associated with prostate cancer. Through a comprehensive analysis of RNA-sequencing data (RNA-seq), we find evidence that PCGEM1 but not PRNCR1 is associated with prostate cancer. We employ a large cohort of >230 high-risk prostate cancer patients with long-term outcomes data to show that, in contrast to prior reports, neither gene is associated with poor patient outcomes. We further observe no evidence that PCGEM1 nor PRNCR1 interact with AR, and neither gene is a component of AR signaling. Thus, we conclusively demonstrate that PCGEM1 and PRNCR1 are not prognostic lncRNAs in prostate cancer and we refute suggestions that these lncRNAs interact in AR signaling.""","""['John R Prensner', 'Anirban Sahu', 'Matthew K Iyer', 'Rohit Malik', 'Benjamin Chandler', 'Irfan A Asangani', 'Anton Poliakov', 'Ismael A Vergara', 'Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'Robert B Jenkins', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The long non-coding RNA PCGEM1 is regulated by androgen receptor activity in vivo.', 'lncRNA-dependent mechanisms of androgen-receptor-regulated gene activation programs.', 'Long and noncoding RNAs (lnc-RNAs) determine androgen receptor dependent gene expression in prostate cancer growth in vivo.', ""Long noncoding RNAs and prostate carcinogenesis: the missing 'linc'?"", 'Long non-coding RNA: A newly deciphered ""code"" in prostate cancer.', 'Cuproptosis-related lncRNA predict prognosis and immune response of lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Long non-coding RNA-PCGEM1 contributes to prostate cancer progression by sponging microRNA miR-129-5p to enhance chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 expression.', 'LncRNA PCGEM1 in Human Cancers: Functions, Mechanisms and Promising Clinical Utility.', 'PRNCR1: a long non-coding RNA with a pivotal oncogenic role in cancer.', 'How Protein Methylation Regulates Steroid Receptor Function.']"""

Cancer screening services are, however, only used by a small part of the population and utilization rates vary widely amongst the 402 German districts. This study examines to which extent geographic variation in the use of cancer screening can be explained by accessibility of these services and by spillover effects between adjacent areas, while controlling for a wide range of covariates. District level data on cancer screening utilization rates were calculated for breast, cervical, prostate, skin, and colorectal cancers using German data provided by the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung - KBV) between 2008 and 2011. We estimated the impact of health service variables on cancer screening utilization using spatial and non-spatial regression models. Spatial autocorrelation in the residuals was estimated using Moran's I statistic. After controlling for socioeconomic and other regional covariates, screening rates for breast, prostate, skin, and colorectal cancers are significantly higher in areas with higher physician density. The utilization of Pap-tests, skin cancer screening and colonoscopies is inversely related with average travel time to physicians. The coefficients for the spatial lag are significant and positive in all models. The positive spatial lags indicate that screening utilization rates are determined by knowledge spillovers between neighboring districts. In terms of public policy, our study demonstrates the potential to increase the use of cancer screening services through improving knowledge regarding cancer screening and by ensuring patient access to cancer screening services.""","""['Verena Vogt', 'Martin Siegel', 'Leonie Sundmacher']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Soc Sci Med""","""['Role of mammography accessibility, deprivation and spatial effect in breast cancer screening participation in France: an observational ecological study.', 'Variation of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer screening activity in Switzerland: Influence of insurance, policy and guidelines.', 'Exploring implications of Medicaid participation and wait times for colorectal screening on early detection efforts in Connecticut--a secret-shopper survey.', 'How to enhance physician and public acceptance and utilisation of colon cancer screening recommendations.', 'Travel times of patients to ambulatory care physicians in Germany.', 'Regional differences in health screening participation between before and during COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Role of mammography accessibility, deprivation and spatial effect in breast cancer screening participation in France: an observational ecological study.', 'Diagnose earlier, live longer?

While EAF2 and its partner ELL have been shown to be members of protein complexes involved in RNA polymerase II transcriptional elongation, the biologic roles for EAF2 especially with regards to the development of cancer remains poorly understood. We have previously identified the eaf-1 gene in Caenorhabditiselegans as the ortholog of EAF2, and shown that eaf-1 interacts with the ELL ortholog ell-1 to control development and fertility in worms. To identify genetic pathways that interact with eaf-1, we screened RNAi libraries consisting of transcription factors, phosphatases, and chromatin-modifying factors to identify genes which enhance the effects of eaf-1(tm3976) on fertility. From this screen, we identified lin-53, hmg-1.2, pha-4, ruvb-2 and set-6 as hits. LIN-53 is the C. elegans ortholog of human retinoblastoma binding protein 4/7 (RBBP 4/7), which binds to the retinoblastoma protein and inhibits the Ras signaling pathway. We find that lin-53 showed a synthetic interaction with eaf-1(tm3976) where knockdown of lin-53 in an eaf-1(tm3976) mutant resulted in sterile worms. This phenotype may be due to cell death as the treated worms contain degenerated embryos with increased expression of the ced-1:GFP cell death marker. Further we find that the interaction between eaf-1 and lin-53/RBBP4/7 also exists in vertebrates, which is reflected by the formation of a protein complex between EAF2 and RBBP4/7. Finally, overexpression of either human EAF2 or RBBP4 in LNCaP cells induced the cell death while knockdown of EAF2 in LNCaP enhanced cell proliferation, indicating an important role of EAF2 in controlling the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells.

We also studied the descriptive validity of the grading system of Ellison et al for post-prostatectomy incontinence and baseline predictors of post-prostatectomy incontinence at 12 months.  Materials and methods:   This national prospective study included 844 patients treated with radical prostatectomy between 2005 and 2009. Adverse effects, including urinary dysfunction and bother, were reported by 735 patients (88%) using the EPIC-50 and UCLA-PCI validated questionnaires at baseline and 12-month followup. Linear regression analysis was done to examine baseline predictors and the degree of post-prostatectomy incontinence at followup.  Results:   At 12 months after radical prostatectomy 74% of patients reported post-prostatectomy incontinence, of whom 40% used pads daily, 34% reported occasional dribbling without pads and 26% had total urinary control. When defined as total incontinence/no urinary control, severe post-prostatectomy incontinence was reported by 3% of the men but 25% had severe post-prostatectomy incontinence according to the stratification of Ellison et al. Of patients with preoperative incontinence 14% improved postoperatively. Predictors of post-prostatectomy incontinence were age 65 years or greater, not working, sexual dysfunction and incontinence preoperatively. The latter 2 remained the strongest predictors on multivariate analysis. Prostate cancer related variables were not associated with post-prostatectomy incontinence.  Conclusions:   The prevalence of post-prostatectomy incontinence varied considerably according to the definition applied. In our opinion incontinence may be reported as any leakage and not only as pad use with grading done on a symptom scale.

The objective of this study was to examine recent survival trends in Estonia and to quantify the effect on survival estimates of the temporary disruption of the Estonian Cancer Registry (ECR) practices in 2001-2007 when death certificates could not be used for case ascertainment.  Patients and methods:   ECR data on all adult cases of 16 common cancers diagnosed in Estonia during 1995-2008 and followed up for vital status until 2009 were used to estimate relative survival ratios (RSR). We used cohort analysis for patients diagnosed in 1995-1999 and 2000-2004; and period hybrid approach to obtain the most recent estimates (2005-2009). We compared five-year RSRs calculated from data sets with and without death certificate initiated (DCI) cases.  Results:   A total of 64328 cancer cases were included in survival analysis. Compared with 1995-1999, five-year age-standardized RSR increased 20 percent units for prostate cancer, reaching 76% in 2005-2009. A rise of 10 percent units or more was also seen for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (five-year RSR 51% in 2005-2009), and cancers of rectum (49%), breast (73%) and ovary (37%). The effect of including/excluding DCI cases from survival analysis was small except for lung and pancreatic cancers.  Conclusions:   Relative survival continued to increase in Estonia during the first decade of the 21st century, although for many cancers, a gap between Estonia and more affluent countries still exists. Cancer control efforts should aim at the reduction of risk factors amenable to primary prevention, but also at the improvement of early diagnosis and ensuring timely and optimal care to all cancer patients.""","""['K Innos', 'A Baburin', 'T Aareleid']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Age-specific cancer survival in Estonia: recent trends and data quality.', 'Time trends in population-based breast cancer survival in Estonia: analysis by age and stage.', 'Trends in incidence and survival of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Estonia: a population-based study.', 'Trends in cancer patient survival in Estonia before and after the transition from a Soviet republic to an open-market economy.', 'Prostate cancer incidence, mortality and survival trends in Estonia, 1995-2014.', 'Childhood cancer incidence and survival trends in Estonia (1970-2016): a nationwide population-based study.', ""Critical Points for Interpreting Patients' Survival Rate Using Cancer Registries: A Literature Review."", 'Divergent trends in lung cancer incidence by gender, age and histological type in Estonia: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Age-specific cancer survival in Estonia: recent trends and data quality.', 'Sex differences in cancer survival in Estonia: a population-based study.']"""

Experimental design:   Tissue was obtained from 358 men diagnosed with prostate cancer at transurethral resection of the prostate due to obstructive voiding problems, of which 260 were then followed with watchful waiting. Tissue microarrays of both malignant and non-malignant tissues were stained with an antibody against S100A9. The number of stained inflammatory cells was scored and related to clinical outcome and histopathological parameters of known prognostic value.  Results:   A high number of inflammatory cells expressing S100A9 in both malignant and surrounding non-malignant tissues were associated with significantly shorter cancer-specific survival. This association remained significant when Gleason score and local tumour stage were analysed together with S100A9 in a Cox regression model.

Materials and methods:   LNCaP cells (5 × 102) were cultured in microtiter plate modules and treated with gallic acid, tannic acid and quercetin (1, 5 and 10 μM), rutin and morin (25, 50 and 75 μM) and resveratrol (5, 10 and 25 μM). To address the extent of proliferation at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, a colorimetric immunoassay method was used. An activity caspase 3/7 detection assay was used to disclose apoptosis at 24, 48 and 72 hours. AR mARN levels were determined by real time RT-PCR.  Results:   All polyphenols studied significantly inhibited (P<.05) cell proliferation compared to control. However, there were moderate differences between them. Resveratrol was the strongest inhibitor at different times and doses. Also, caspase-3 and caspase-7 activity was significantly higher (P<.05) than control in the presence of all the compounds, but the earlier response was achieved by resveratrol. Resveratrol, quercetin and morin were the only nutrients that significantly inhibited AR mRNA expression. Again resveratrol produced the highest inhibition (90-250 times less than control), followed by morin (67-100 times) and quercetin (55-91 times).  Conclusions:   All polyphenols studied showed important antiproliferative effects and induced apoptosis when added to LNCaP cells culture. We confirm that resveratrol, morin and quercetin may achieve such effect through reduced expression of AR.

Standardization between methods should alleviate this burden. Our objective was to assess the necessity of dual reporting for total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) when changing methods that have been calibrated against the World Health Organization PSA reference material.  Design and methods:   Following an initial validation where 40 patient samples were divided and analyzed on the Roche E-modular (current method) and Abbott ARCHITECT (new method) for tPSA, a crossover period ensued with dual reporting of tPSA over 54days (n=1110 samples with both tPSA results reported). Passing & Bablok regression was performed, with agreement during the crossover period also determined by two methods. Method#1: if the percent difference between the result pair was ≤0.33×the intraindividual biological variation (0.33×CVi=6.0%) for tPSA; and Method#2: if the Roche tPSA result was within an acceptable analytical range based on Abbott's maximum allowable imprecision for the tPSA assay (CV≤8%) to determine if there was a range of optimal agreement that might not require dual reporting.  Results:   During the crossover period, Passing & Bablok regression yielded the following relationship: Abbott tPSA=1.04(95% CI: 1.03 to 1.04)×(Roche tPSA)-0.02(95% CI: -0.03 to -0.02). Only 52% (95%CI: 49 to55) of the results were in agreement by Method#1 whereas 95% (95% CI: 92 to 97) of the results between 3.3 and 19μg/L were found to have acceptable agreement based on Method#2.

Methods and materials:   We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using the National Cancer Data Base, a nationwide oncology outcomes database in the United States. We identified 98,755 men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 2006 and 2011 who received definitive EBRT and classified patients into National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk groups. We defined dose-escalated EBRT as total prescribed dose of ≥75.6 Gy. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined the association of patient, clinical, and demographic characteristics with the use of dose-escalated EBRT.  Results:   Overall, 81.6% of men received dose-escalated EBRT during the study period. The use of dose-escalated EBRT did not vary substantially by NCCN risk group. Use of dose-escalated EBRT increased from 70.7% of patients receiving treatment in 2006 to 89.8% of patients receiving treatment in 2011. On multivariable analysis, year of diagnosis and use of intensity modulated radiation therapy were significantly associated with receipt of dose-escalated EBRT.  Conclusions:   Our study results indicate that dose-escalated EBRT has been widely adopted by radiation oncologists treating prostate cancer in the United States. The proportion of patients receiving dose-escalated EBRT increased nearly 20% between 2006 and 2011. We observed high utilization rates of dose-escalated EBRT within all disease risk groups. Adoption of intensity modulated radiation therapy was strongly associated with use of dose-escalated treatment.""","""['Samuel Swisher-McClure', 'Nandita Mitra', 'Kaitlin Woo', 'Marc Smaldone', 'Robert Uzzo', 'Justin E Bekelman']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Dose-Escalated Irradiation and Overall Survival in Men With Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Variations in patterns of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy use based on dose escalation with external beam radiotherapy vs. brachytherapy boost for prostate cancer.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Dose escalated external beam radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and conventional dose external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: do we need both?', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Prospective Randomized Phase II Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) vs. Conventional Fractionated Radiotherapy (CFRT) for Chinese Patients with Early-Stage Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Long-term clinical outcomes after 12-fractionated carbon-ion radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Dose Escalation for Prostate Adenocarcinoma: A Long-Term Update on the Outcomes of a Phase 3, Single Institution Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy is more effective and safe for localized prostate cancer patients: a meta-analysis.', 'Randomized Phase III Noninferiority Study Comparing Two Radiotherapy Fractionation Schedules in Patients With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.']"""

In several investigations glycopeptide antibiotics like bleomycin and antifungal agents like itraconazole have shown direct positive results whereas antifungal polyenes such as amphotericin B have been shown to potentiate the effects of antitumor agents. After having investigated the fluorescence-marked antibacterial glycopeptides vancomycin and ramoplanin on various malignant and healthy human cells in previous studies, the present work is focused on the antifungal polyene nystatin. We coupled nystatin to the fluorescent dye fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). After confirming the correct mass by mass spectrometry the effect of the conjugate on nine different human cell lines (two benign and seven tumor cell lines) was examined. The character of the uptake was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and the uptake was quantified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The addition of propidium iodide (PI) allowed for detection and quantification of cell membrane disruption caused by the fluorescein-nystatin conjugate. Uptake of the conjugate was found to vary among the nine cell lines investigated. Conjugate uptake was strongest after 6 hours in most cell lines. Only the two prostate carcinoma cell lines PC3 and LNCaP showed further increase in uptake after long-time (24h) incubation. PI staining in general correlated well with the conjugate FITC staining values. The Colo205 colon carcinoma cell line and the U373 and LN18 glioblastoma cell lines exhibited very low conjugate uptake and PI staining.

We identified the COP9 signalosome subunit 4 (CSN4) as a novel interacting partner for sGCα1. Importantly, the CSN4-sGCα1 interaction inhibits sGCα1 proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this, disruption of CSN4 led to a significant decrease in prostate cancer cell proliferation, which was significantly but not completely rescued by sGCα1 overexpression, opening the possibility of an additional target of CSN4. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation experiments showed that p53 is found in the CSN4-sGCα1 cytoplasmic protein complex. However, in contrast to sGCα1, p53 protein stability was compromised by CSN4, leading to prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation. Interestingly, we observed that CSN4 was overexpressed in prostate tumors, and its protein level correlates directly with sGCα1 and inversely with p53 proteins, mimicking what was observed in prostate cancer cells. Our data further showed that CSN4 silencing decreased CSN5 protein levels and suggest that the CSN4 effects on sGCα1 and p53 proteins are mediated by CSN5. Lastly, our study showed that caseine kinase-2 (CK2) was involved in regulating p53 and sGCα1 protein stability as determined by both disruption of CK2 expression and inhibition of its kinase activity. Collectively, our study has identified a novel endogenous CSN4-CSN5-CK2 complex with sGCα1and p53 that oppositely controls the stability of these 2 proteins and provides prostate cancer cells an important mechanism for survival and proliferation.""","""['Meenakshi Bhansali', 'Lirim Shemshedini']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Soluble guanylyl cyclase α1 and p53 cytoplasmic sequestration and down-regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen regulation of soluble guanylyl cyclasealpha1 mediates prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'A peptide against soluble guanylyl cyclase α1: a new approach to treating prostate cancer.', 'Roles of COP9 signalosome in cancer.', 'JAB1/CSN5 and the COP9 signalosome.

The mechanism underlying NO-mediated dysregulation of this circuit was investigated, namely, NO-mediated inhibition of the activity of the transcription factors NF-κB, Snail, and YY1. We hypothesized that one mechanism of NO-mediated inhibition may invoke the NO-induced S-nitrosylation of these transcription factors. We demonstrate in metastatic and EMT+ human prostate carcinoma cell lines that treatment with NO results in the S-nitrosylation of NF-κB (p50), Snail, and YY1 and inhibits their activities, resulting in the reversal of the EMT phenotype into a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition phenotype.

Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent prognostic impact of clinical factors on biochemical and clinical outcomes [biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), clinical relapse-free survival (cRFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS)].  Results:   Median follow-up was 54 months. Actuarial bRFS, cRFS, CSS and OS at 5 years were, respectively, 64, 86.2, 94.5 and 96.3 %. On multivariate analysis, nadir PSA (nPSA) after SRT was significantly associated with bRFS (HR 15, p = 0.001) and cRFS (HR 9, p = 0.001), while CSS was associated with RT dose (≥70 Gy; HR 1.9 p = 0.023), pre-RT PSA (<1.5 vs. ≥1.5 ng/mL; HR 1.3, p = 0.008) and age (>75 years; HR 1.2, p = 0.05).

We previously reported that over-expression of EP4 was one of the mechanisms responsible for progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer, and an EP4 antagonist ONO-AE3-208 in vivo suppressed the castration-resistant progression regulating the activation of androgen receptor. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of EP4 with prostate cancer metastasis and the efficacy of ONO-AE3-208 for suppressing the metastasis. The expression levels of EP4 mRNA were evaluated in prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, and PC3. EP4 over-expressing LNCaP was established, and their cell invasiveness was compared with the control LNCaP (LNCaP/mock). The in vitro cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of these cells were examined under different concentrations of ONO-AE3-208. An in vivo bone metastatic mouse model was constructed by inoculating luciferase expressing PC3 cells into left ventricle of nude mice. Their bone metastasis was observed by bioluminescent imaging with or without ONO-AE3-208 administration. The EP4 mRNA expression levels were higher in PC3 than in LNCaP, and EP4 over-expression of LNCaP cells enhanced their cell invasiveness. The in vitro cell invasion and migration were suppressed by ONO-AE3-208 in a dose-dependent manner without affecting cell proliferation. The in vivo bone metastasis of PC3 was also suppressed by ONO-AE3-208 treatment. EP4 expression levels were correlated with prostate cancer cell invasiveness and EP4 specific antagonist ONO-AE3-208 suppressed cell invasion, migration, and bone metastasis, indicating that it is a potential novel therapeutic modality for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Song Xu', 'Zhengyu Zhang', 'Osamu Ogawa', 'Takeshi Yoshikawa', 'Hiromasa Sakamoto', 'Noboru Shibasaki', 'Takayuki Goto', 'Liming Wang', 'Naoki Terada']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Biochem Biophys""","""['Identification of EP4 as a potential target for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer using a novel xenograft model.', 'Inhibitory effect of ONO-AE3-208 on the formation of bone metastasis of prostate cancer in mice.', 'Host and direct antitumor effects and profound reduction in tumor metastasis with selective EP4 receptor antagonism.', 'EP4 as a Therapeutic Target for Aggressive Human Breast Cancer.', 'Cannabinoids and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of Animal Studies.', 'Quantification of Grapiprant and Its Stability Testing under Changing Environmental Conditions.', ""Paeoniflorin-6'O-benzene sulfonate suppresses ﬁbroblast-like synoviocytes proliferation and migration in rheumatoid arthritis through regulating GRK2-Gβγ interaction."", 'The NSAID glafenine rescues class 2 CFTR mutants via cyclooxygenase 2 inhibition of the arachidonic acid pathway.', 'Prostaglandin Pathways: Opportunities for Cancer Prevention and Therapy.', 'Prostaglandin E2 breaks down pericyte-endothelial cell interaction via EP1 and EP4-dependent downregulation of pericyte N-cadherin, connexin-43, and R-Ras.']"""

To explore the expression, regulation and function of DACH1 in human esophageal cancer, 11 esophageal cancer cell lines, 10 cases of normal esophageal mucosa, 51 cases of different grades of dysplasia and 104 cases of primary esophageal squamous cancer were employed. Methylation specific PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blot, flow cytometry, small interfering RNAs, colony formation techniques and xenograft mice model were used. We found that DACH1 expression was regulated by promoter region hypermethylation in esophageal cancer cell lines. 18.8% (6 of 32) of grade 1, 42.1% (8 of 19) of grade 2 and grade 3 dysplasia (ED2,3), and 61.5% (64 of 104) of esophageal cancer were methylated, but no methylation was found in 10 cases of normal esophageal mucosa. The methylation was increased in progression tendency during esophageal carcinogenesis (P<0.01). DACH1 methylation was associated with poor differentiation (P<0.05) and late tumor stage (P<0.05). Restoration of DACH1 expression inhibited cell growth and activated TGF-β signaling in KYSE150 and KYSE510 cells. DACH1 suppressed human esophageal cancer cell tumor growth in xenograft mice. In conclusion, DACH1 is frequently methylated in human esophageal cancer and methylation of DACH1 is involved in the early stage of esophageal carcinogenesis.

Furthermore, SOX2 expression was correlated with the expression of proliferation and apoptosis-related proteins in primary HNSCC samples. SOX2 amplification was detected in 21% of primary HNSCC and mostly observed in a concordant manner between primary tumors and corresponding metastatic tissues. Overall, SOX2 amplification resulted in protein overexpression and was mutually exclusive with human papillomavirus infection. SOX2 protein overexpression was associated with clinicopathological parameters of worse outcome. Functionally, SOX2 induced the expression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 and enhanced resistance to apoptosis-inducing agents including cisplatin, indicating SOX2 as a mediator of therapy resistance in human HNSCC.

Materials and methods:   Eligibility criteria of the active surveillance prostate cancer database (1997 to 2012) at our tertiary center includes prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, cT2 or less, no Gleason grade 4 or 5, 3 or fewer positive cores, no core with greater than 50% involvement, patient age 75 years or less and 1 or more biopsies after initial diagnostic biopsy. We excluded from analysis men with fewer than 10 cores at diagnostic biopsy and/or confirmatory biopsy greater than 24 months after diagnostic biopsy. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was performed selectively to investigate incongruity between prostate specific antigen and biopsy findings. Pathological progression was defined by grade and/or volume (greater than 50% of core involved). Transition zone progression was subdivided into exclusively transition zone and combined transition zone (transition and peripheral zones). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine predictors of transition zone progression.  Results:   A total of 392 men were considered in analysis. Median followup was 45.5 months. At each biopsy during active surveillance (confirmatory biopsy to biopsy 5+) there were transition zone positive cores in 18.6% to 26.7% of cases, all transition zone progression in 5.9% to 11.1% and exclusively transition zone progression in 2.7% to 6.7%. Volume related progression was noted more frequently than grade related progression (24 vs 9 cases). Predictors of only transition zone progression were the maximum percent in a single core (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.30-3.04, p = 0.002) and cancer on magnetic resonance imaging (HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.23-8.27, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Across multiple active surveillance biopsies 2.7% to 6.7% of men had only transition zone progression.

Methods:   Targeted knockdown by interferon RNA was applied on two prostate cancer and Hela cell lines to examine the inverse correlation expression of E2F1 and ICAM-1. ICAM-1 promoter reporter and ChIP assays were used for analysis of the molecular basis of transcriptional regulation of E2F1 on ICAM-1. Co-IP assays were employed for testing the protein interaction between E2F1 and NF-κB. Tumor xenograft mice model with E2F1 and ICAM-1-knockdown prostate cancer cells were used to investigate the effects of E2F1 and ICAM-1 on antitumor immunity.  Results:   E2F1 knockdown by a specific short hairpin RNA increased gene transcription and protein expression of ICAM-1. By using wild type and a series of mutant ICAM-1 promoter luciferase constructs, the NF-κB binding sites were found to be important for E2F1 regulation of ICAM-1 promoter. Targeted knockdown of E2F1 did not affect expression and phosphorylation of NF-κB and IκBα, but facilitated NF-κB binding to the ICAM-1 promoter, subsequently induced ICAM-1 transcription and production in prostate carcinoma cells. Furthermore, knockdown of E2F1 inhibited tumor growth of prostate cancer in vivo through increasing the susceptibility of tumor cells to ICAM-1-mediated anti-tumor immunity including enhancement of monocyte adhesion, leucocytes infiltration, as well as cytotoxicity against tumor cells.

An accurate risk classification to identify CRPC patient groups for which DTX would be effective is urgently warranted. The Armstrong risk classification (ARC), which classifies CRPC patients into 3 groups, is superior; however, its usefulness remains unclear, and further external validation is required before clinical use. This study aimed to examine the clinical significance of the ARC through external validation in DTX-treated Japanese CRPC patients.  Methods:   CRPC patients who received 2 or more DTX cycles were selected for this study. Patients were classified into good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups according to the ARC. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses and overall survival (OS) were calculated and compared between the risk groups. A multivariate analysis was performed to clarify the relationship between the ARC and major patient characteristics.  Results:   Seventy-eight CRPC patients met the inclusion criteria. Median PSA levels at DTX initiation was 20 ng/mL. Good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups comprised 51 (65%), 17 (22%), and 10 (13%) patients, respectively. PSA response rates ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% were 33%, 41%, and 30%, and 18%, 41%, and 20% in the good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups, respectivcixely, with no significant differences (p = 0.133 and 0.797, respectively). The median OS in the good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups were statistically significant (p < 0.001) at 30.1, 14.2, and 5.7 months, respectively.

Changes in the prevalence of risk factors and diagnostic techniques may have affected more recent risks.  Methods:   We examined the incidence of second primary cancer among adults in the West of Scotland, UK, diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2004 (n = 57,393). We used National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results and International Agency for Research on Cancer definitions of multiple primary cancers and estimated indirectly standardised incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   There was a high incidence of cancer during the first 60 days following diagnosis (SIR = 2.36, 95% CI = 2.12 to 2.63). When this period was excluded the risk was not raised, but it was high for some patient groups; in particular women aged <50 years with breast cancer (SIR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.58 to 2.78), patients with bladder (SIR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.67) and head & neck (SIR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.67 to 2.21) cancer. Head & neck cancer patients had increased risks of lung cancer (SIR = 3.75, 95% CI = 3.01 to 4.62), oesophageal (SIR = 4.62, 95% CI = 2.73 to 7.29) and other head & neck tumours (SIR = 6.10, 95% CI = 4.17 to 8.61). Patients with bladder cancer had raised risks of lung (SIR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.62 to 2.88) and prostate (SIR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.72 to 3.30) cancer.

However, the mechanism of YB-1 activation remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism and role of YB-1 activation in relation to castration resistance as well as enzalutamide resistance, with a view to developing a novel therapeutic concept for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treatment.  Methods:   The expression and phosphorylation levels of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1), YB-1 and AR were examined by quantitative PCR and Western blotting using prostate cancer cells. In addition, the effects of YB-1 inhibition using specific siRNA and small molecule inhibitor SL0101 on AR expression as well as combination treatment with enzalutamide and SL0101 were examined.  Results:   We found that androgen deprivation, as well as treatment with the next-generation anti-androgen enzalutamide, induced RSK1 and YB-1 activation followed by AR induction, which could be reversed by YB-1 shutdown and RSK inhibitor SL0101. SL0101 and enzalutamide exerted a synergistic tumor-suppressive effect on cell proliferation in androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells, as well as castration-resistant C4-2 cells. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of RSK1 and YB-1 were elevated in castration- and enzalutamide-resistant cells, compared with their parental cells.

Several adipokines have been implicated as putative mediating factors between obesity and prostate cancer. Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), a member of the cytoplasmic fatty acid binding protein multigene family, was recently identified as a novel adipokine. Although FABP4 is released from adipocytes and mean circulating concentrations of FABP4 are linked with obesity, effects of exogenous FABP4 on prostate cancer progression are unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of exogenous FABP4 on human prostate cancer cell progression. FABP4 treatment promoted serum-induced prostate cancer cell invasion in vitro. Furthermore, oleic acid promoted prostate cancer cell invasion only if FABP4 was present in the medium. These promoting effects were reduced by FABP4 inhibitor, which inhibits FABP4 binding to fatty acids. Immunostaining for FABP4 showed that exogenous FABP4 was taken up into DU145 cells in three-dimensional culture. In mice, treatment with FABP4 inhibitor reduced the subcutaneous growth and lung metastasis of prostate cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the number of apoptotic cells, positive for cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, was increased in subcutaneous tumors of FABP4 inhibitor-treated mice, as compared with control mice. These results suggest that exogenous FABP4 might promote human prostate cancer cell progression by binding with fatty acids. Additionally, exogenous FABP4 activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, independently of binding to fatty acids. Thus, FABP4 might be a key molecule to understand the mechanisms underlying the obesity-prostate cancer progression link.""","""['Hisanori Uehara', 'Tetsuyuki Takahashi', 'Mina Oha', 'Hirohisa Ogawa', 'Keisuke Izumi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Oleanolic acid inhibits cell survival and proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo through the PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Id-1 promotes tumorigenicity and metastasis of human esophageal cancer cells through activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Angiogenin interacts with ribonuclease inhibitor regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in bladder cancer cells.', 'The peritumoural adipose tissue microenvironment and cancer.

DDRs play an important role in various cellular functions and disease processes, including malignant progression. Compared to other RTKs, DDRs have relatively long juxtamembrane domains, which are believed to contribute to receptor function. Despite this possibility, the function and mechanism of the juxtamembrane domain of DDRs have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane 2 (JM2) region of DDR2 contributed to receptor dimerization, which is critical for receptor activation in response to collagen stimulation. A collagen-binding assay showed that JM2 was required for efficient binding of collagen to the discoidin (DS) domain. Immunohistochemical analysis of DDR2 expression using a tissue microarray demonstrated that DDR2 was overexpressed in several carcinoma tissues, including bladder, testis, lung, kidney, prostate and stomach. In H1299 cells, inhibition of DDR2 activity by overexpressing the juxtamembrane domain containing JM2 suppressed collagen-induced colony formation, cell proliferation and invasion via the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Taken together, our results suggest that JM2-mediated dimerization is likely to be essential for DDR2 activation and cancer progression.

Despite these advances that provide temporary respite, resistance to enzalutamide occurs frequently. Androgen receptor (AR) splice variants such as AR-V7 have recently been shown to drive castration-resistant growth and resistance to enzalutamide. This study was designed to identify inhibitors of AR variants and test its ability to overcome resistance to enzalutamide.  Experimental design:   The drug screening was conducted using luciferase activity assay to determine the activity of AR-V7 after treatment with the compounds in the Prestwick Chemical Library, which contains about 1,120 FDA-approved drugs. The effects of the identified inhibitors on AR-V7 activity and enzalutamide sensitivity were characterized in CRPC and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Niclosamide, an FDA-approved antihelminthic drug, was identified as a potent AR-V7 inhibitor in prostate cancer cells. Niclosamide significantly downregulated AR-V7 protein expression by protein degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway. Niclosamide also inhibited AR-V7 transcription activity and reduced the recruitment of AR-V7 to the PSA promoter. Niclosamide inhibited prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, the combination of niclosamide and enzalutamide resulted in significant inhibition of enzalutamide-resistant tumor growth, suggesting that niclosamide enhances enzalutamide therapy and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in CRPC cells.  Conclusions:   Niclosamide was identified as a novel inhibitor of AR variants. Our findings offer preclinical validation of niclosamide as a promising inhibitor of AR variants to treat, either alone or in combination with current antiandrogen therapies, patients with advanced prostate cancer, especially those resistant to enzalutamide.""","""['Chengfei Liu#', 'Wei Lou#', 'Yezi Zhu', 'Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Chad T Schwartz', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Correction: Niclosamide Inhibits Androgen Receptor Variants Expression and Overcomes Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: Niclosamide jumps the hurdle of enzalutamide resistance.', 'Niclosamide enhances abiraterone treatment via inhibition of androgen receptor variants in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Niclosamide and Bicalutamide Combination Treatment Overcomes Enzalutamide- and Bicalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Current status of androgen receptor-splice variant 7 inhibitor niclosamide in castrate-resistant prostate-cancer.', 'Niclosamide (NA) overcomes cisplatin resistance in human ovarian cancer.', 'Critical role of antioxidant programs in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Niclosamide Analogs as Therapeutic Agents for Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Molluskicidal nanoemulsion of Neomitranthes obscura (DC.)

Objectives:   Our first aim was to identify metabolites that are biomarkers of usual dietary intake. Second, among serum metabolites correlated with diet, we evaluated metabolite reproducibility and required sample sizes to determine the potential for metabolomics in epidemiologic studies.  Design:   Baseline serum from 502 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was analyzed by using ultra-high-performance liquid-phase chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Usual intakes of 36 dietary groups were estimated by using a food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary biomarkers were identified by using partial Pearson's correlations with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between samples collected 1 y apart in a subset of 30 individuals were calculated to evaluate intraindividual metabolite variability.  Results:   We detected 412 known metabolites. Citrus, green vegetables, red meat, shellfish, fish, peanuts, rice, butter, coffee, beer, liquor, total alcohol, and multivitamins were each correlated with at least one metabolite (P < 1.093 × 10(-6); r = -0.312 to 0.398); in total, 39 dietary biomarkers were identified. Some correlations (citrus intake with stachydrine) replicated previous studies; others, such as peanuts and tryptophan betaine, were novel findings. Other strong associations included coffee (with trigonelline-N-methylnicotinate and quinate) and alcohol (with ethyl glucuronide). Intraindividual variability in metabolite levels (1-y ICCs) ranged from 0.27 to 0.89. Large, but attainable, sample sizes are required to detect associations between metabolites and disease in epidemiologic studies, further emphasizing the usefulness of metabolomics in nutritional epidemiology.  Conclusions:   We identified dietary biomarkers by using metabolomics in an epidemiologic data set. Given the strength of the associations observed, we expect that some of these metabolites will be validated in future studies and later used as biomarkers in large cohorts to study diet-disease associations.

Men aged over 18 years, with hormone-naive prostate cancer for whom hormone therapy was indicated, and who had non-castration levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 2 ng/mL or greater at screening, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0, received oral enzalutamide 160 mg/day. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an 80% or greater decline in PSA at week 25. All analyses included all patients who had received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01302041.  Findings:   67 men were enrolled into the study. 62 patients (92.5%, 95% CI 86.2-98.8) had a decline in PSA of 80% or greater at week 25. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events up to week 25 were gynaecomastia (n=24), fatigue (n=23), nipple pain (n=13), and hot flush (n=12), all of which were of mild to moderate severity. Nine patients had a treatment-emergent adverse event of grade 3 or higher, most of which were reported in one patient each, except for pneumonia (grade 3, two patients) and hypertension (grade 3, four patients). Five patients reported serious adverse events, none of which were deemed to be treatment related.

Thus, in the present study, we elucidated the antitumor activity of hUCMSCs in PC-3 prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   hUCMSCs were isolated from Wharton jelly of umbilical cord and characterized via induction of differentiations, osteogenesis, and adipogenesis. Antitumor effects of UCMSCs on tumor growth were evaluated in a co-culture condition with PC-3 prostate cancer cells. PC-3 cells were subcutaneously (sc) injected into the left flank of nude mice, and UCMSCs were sc injected into the right flank of the same mouse.  Results:   We found that hUCMSCs inhibited the proliferation of PC-3 cells in the co-culture condition. Furthermore, co-culture of hUCMSCs induced the cleavage of caspase 9/3 and PARP, activated c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and Bax, and attenuated the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and the expression of survival genes such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Survivin, Mcl-1, and cIAP-1 in PC-3 cells in Western blotting assay. Conversely, we found that treatment of specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 suppressed the cleavages of caspase 9/3 and PARP induced by hUCMSCs in PC-3 cells by Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay. The homing of hUCMSCs to, and TUNEL-positive cells on, the K562 xenograft tumor region were detected in Nu/nu-BALB/c mouse.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that UCMSCs inhibit tumor growth and have the antitumor potential for PC-3 prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Ihn Han', 'Miyong Yun', 'Eun-Ok Kim', 'Bonglee Kim', 'Min-Hyung Jung', 'Sung-Hoon Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Stem Cell Res Ther""","""['Retraction Note: Umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells induce apoptosis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells through activation of JNK and downregulation of PI3K/AKT signaling.', ""Microvesicles derived from human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells attenuate bladder tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo."", 'The in vitro and in vivo effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells on the growth of breast cancer cells.', 'Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes exert antiapoptosis effect via activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway on H9C2 cells.', 'Research Progress on the Osteogenesis-Related Regulatory Mechanisms of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells.', 'The optimal transplantation strategy of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in spinal cord injury: a systematic review and network\xa0meta-analysis based on animal studies.', 'The Role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Exosomes in Tumor Development and Targeted Antitumor Therapies.', 'Methods and criteria for validating the multimodal functions of perinatal derivatives when used in oncological and antimicrobial applications.', 'Umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation decreases incidence of liver cancer in end-stage liver disease patients: a retrospective analysis over 5 years.', 'Exosomal miR-21-5p derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells promote osteosarcoma cell proliferation and invasion by targeting PIK3R1.', 'Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of human gastric cancer HGC-27 cells.']"""

Recent studies have demonstrated a role for the α6 integrin (ITGA6/CD49f) in maintaining stem cell compartments within normal bone marrow and in residency of tumors metastatic to bone. In this study, we tested a function-blocking antibody specific for ITGA6, called J8H, to determine if preexisting cancer lesions in bone could be slowed and/or animal survival improved. Human prostate tumors were established by intracardiac injection into male SCID mice and treatment with J8H antibody was initiated after 1 week. Tumor progression was monitored by micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging of skeletal lesions. Animals that received weekly injections of the anti-ITGA6 antibody showed radiographic progression in only 40% of osseous tumors (femur or tibia), compared with control animals, where 80% of the lesions (femur or tibia) showed progression at 5 weeks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a significant survival advantage for J8H-treated animals. Unexpectedly, CT image analysis revealed an increased proportion of bone lesions displaying a sclerotic rim of new bone formation, encapsulating the arrested lytic lesions in animals that received the anti-ITGA6 antibody treatment. Histopathology of the sclerotic lesions demonstrated well-circumscribed tumor within bone, surrounded by fibrosis.

Survival rates based on population data do not, however, guarantee standardized benchmarks for comparison of different patient populations, which is especially true when compared populations differ considerably in age structure and representation of clinical stages. In this paper, we present and compare statistical methods for standardization of cancer survival rates.  Patients and methods:   Using data of the Czech National Cancer Registry, we estimated 5-year overall and relative survival estimates for periods 2001- 2005 and 2006- 2010. To demonstrate the effect of standardization, we calculated crude and age -standardized survival rates as well as survival rates standardized for both age and clinical stage.  Results:   Our results show that the particular standardization method influences resulting 5-year overall and relative survival rates regarding both within and between time periods comparisons. In addition, our results document a recent improvement in 5-year relative survival between periods 2001- 2005 and 2006- 2010 for 19 of 20 evaluated diagnoses.

Here we report that serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 3 (SGK3), a Ser/Thr kinase functioning downstream of PI3K, is an AR transcriptional target and promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation. SGK3 expression is up-regulated by androgen DHT via AR. We identified an AR-binding region at the sgk3 locus, which confers androgen responsiveness of sgk3 promoters. Interestingly, we found that androgen/AR-dependent SGK3 expression requires estrogen receptor (ER) (including both isoforms, ERα and ERβ). Depletion of ER blocked DHT-induced SGK3 expression. Functionally, knockdown of SGK3 expression significantly decreased LNCaP prostate cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting G1 to S phase cell cycle progression. We further provided evidence that SGK3 promotes p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) activation and increases cyclin D1 levels. In summary, our study identifies SGK3 as an AR target and provides a novel androgen-induced cell proliferation mechanism mediated by the AR-SGK3-p70S6K-cyclin D1 pathway in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Yuanzhong Wang', 'Dujin Zhou', 'Shiuan Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Contributions of SGK3 to transporter-related diseases.', 'Androgens induce prostate cancer cell proliferation through mammalian target of rapamycin activation and post-transcriptional increases in cyclin D proteins.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Growth Suppression of HPr-1AR and PC3-Lenti-AR Prostate Epithelial Cells.', 'Androgen receptor functions as a negative transcriptional regulator of DEPTOR, mTOR inhibitor.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Contributions of SGK3 to transporter-related diseases.', 'Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase 3 Facilitates Myocardial Repair After Cardiac Injury Possibly Through the Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'TXNIP Links Anticipatory Unfolded Protein Response to Estrogen Reprogramming Glucose Metabolism in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Free CA125 promotes ovarian cancer cell migration and tumor metastasis by binding Mesothelin to reduce DKK1 expression and activate the SGK3/FOXO3 pathway.', 'Feedback Activation of SGK3 and AKT Contributes to Rapamycin Resistance by Reactivating mTORC1/4EBP1 Axis via TSC2 in Breast Cancer.']"""

However, recent work suggests that UTF1 is also expressed in somatic cells and that its expression may increase during carcinogenesis. To further clarify the expression profile of UTF1, we evaluated UTF1 expression levels immunohistochemically in eight normal human epithelia (from breast, prostate, endometrium, bladder, colon, oesophagus, lung and kidney) and their corresponding tumours as well as in several epithelial cell lines. We showed UTF1 staining in normal and tumour epithelial tissues, but with varying intensities according to the tissue location. In vitro analyses also revealed that UTF1 is expressed in somatic epithelial cell lines even in the absence of Oct4A and Sox2, its two main known regulators. The comparison of UTF1 levels in normal and tumoral tissues revealed significant overexpression in endometrial and prostatic adenocarcinomas, whereas lower intensity of the staining was observed in renal and colic tumours, suggesting a potential tissue-specific function of UTF1. Altogether, these results highlight a potential dual role for UTF1, acting either as an oncogene or as a tumour suppressor depending on the tissue.

Based on the levels of PSA, the subjects were divided into four groups: 0 -1.0, 1.1 -2. 0, 2.1 -3. 0, and 3.1 -4.0 microg/L. The diagnostic values of DRE, TRUS, f-PSA/t-PSA, and PSAD were assessed in those with different PSA levels. According to the age, the subjects were again divided into five groups: C49 yr, 50 -59 yr, 60 -69 yr, 70 -79 yr, and > 80 yr.

We examined changes in ESA use and blood transfusions over time.  Methods:   The SEER-Medicare database was used to identify patients age ≥ 65 years with breast, lung, prostate, ovary, or colon cancer, diagnosed between 2000 and 2007, who had a chemotherapy claim after their cancer diagnosis. We calculated the mean number of ESA claims per patient per year. Follow-up claims were available through 2008. We used multivariable logistic regression models to analyze the association of ESA use and extended ESA use with clinical and demographic variables.  Results:   Among 121,169 patients identified, 46,063 (38%) received an ESA. ESA use increased from 12.4% to 16.2% by 2006 and then decreased to 7.9% by 2008. Similarly, the mean number of ESA claims per patient decreased steadily over the entire timeframe. The annual percentage of patients undergoing transfusion remained relatively constant (9% to 10%). In a Cox proportional hazards time-dependent model, ESA use was positively associated with black race (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.15), metropolitan location (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.21), metastatic disease (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.41), female sex (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.20), > one comorbidity (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.32), and tumor type. The number of denied claims increased over time.  Conclusion:   Our study demonstrated a rapid decline in the percentage of patients treated with ESAs after changes to reimbursement policy, but not after warnings about use.

Here, we investigated the regulation and biomarker potential of the GABRE∼miR-452∼miR-224 genomic locus.  Experimental design:   GABRE/miR-452/miR-224 transcriptional expression was quantified in 80 nonmalignant and 281 prostate cancer tissue samples. GABRE∼miR-452∼miR-224 promoter methylation was determined by methylation-specific qPCR (MethyLight) in 35 nonmalignant, 293 prostate cancer [radical prostatectomy (RP) cohort 1] and 198 prostate cancer tissue samples (RP cohort 2). Diagnostic/prognostic biomarker potential of GABRE∼miR-452∼miR-224 methylation was evaluated by ROC, Kaplan-Meier, uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Functional roles of miR-224 and miR-452 were investigated in PC3 and DU145 cells by viability, migration, and invasion assays and gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of posttransfection transcriptional profiling data.  Results:   GABRE∼miR-452∼miR-224 was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer compared with nonmalignant prostate tissue and had highly cancer-specific aberrant promoter hypermethylation (AUC = 0.98). Functional studies and GSEA suggested that miR-224 and miR-452 inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC3 and DU145 cells by direct/indirect regulation of pathways related to the cell cycle and cellular adhesion and motility. Finally, in uni- and multivariate analyses, high GABRE∼miR-452∼miR-224 promoter methylation was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence in RP cohort 1, which was successfully validated in RP cohort 2.  Conclusion:   The GABRE∼miR-452∼miR-224 locus is downregulated and hypermethylated in prostate cancer and is a new promising epigenetic candidate biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

The role of KLF9 in prostate cancer (PCa), however, has not yet been investigated.  Methods:   The expression of KLF members, AKT- and apoptosis-related proteins were analyzed by Western blot or qRT-PCR. Tet-On inducible KLF9 expression was established for the evaluation of the effects of KLF9 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry.  Results:   KLF9 was induced in a time-dependent manner in flutamide-caused apoptosis, and knockdown of KLF9 significantly decreased flutamide-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in LNCaP cells. The levels of KLF9 were relatively lower in PCa cell lines, particularly in androgen-independent cell lines compared with those in nontumorous prostate epithelial cell lines. Overexpression of KLF9 dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and cell apoptosis in the androgen-independent cell lines, PC3 and DU145. Intriguingly, KLF9 expression severely suppressed the activation of AKT and its downstream targets. AKT reactivation partially rescued the KLF9-mediated inhibitory effects on the proliferation of PCa cells. More importantly, we found that KLF9 overexpression efficiently inhibited the xenograft tumor growth of PCa cells.

Combinatorial approaches to antibody discovery have facilitated access to unique antibodies by surpassing the diversity limitations of the natural repertoire, exploitation of immune repertoires from multiple species, and tailoring selections to isolate antibodies with desirable biophysical attributes. The V-gene repertoire of the chicken does not utilize highly diverse sequence and structures, which is in stark contrast to the mechanism employed by humans, mice, and primates. Recent exploitation of the avian immune system has generated high quality, high affinity antibodies to a wide range of antigens for a number of therapeutic, diagnostic and biotechnological applications. Furthermore, extensive examination of the amino acid characteristics of the chicken repertoire has provided significant insight into mechanisms employed by the avian immune system. A paucity of avian antibody crystal structures has limited our understanding of the structural consequences of these uniquely chicken features. This paper presents the crystal structure of two chicken single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies generated from large libraries by phage display against important human antigen targets, which capture two unique CDRL1 canonical classes in the presence and absence of a non-canonical disulfide constrained CDRH3.

Further mechanistic experiments demonstrated that SSd arrested the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase via upregulation of p53 and p21 and induced apoptosis by modulating B‑cell lymphoma 2 family proteins, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and activation of caspase‑3. In conclusion the present study indicated that SSd induced apoptosis in DU145 cells by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Therefore, SSd may become a leading candidate drug for the therapy of prostate carcinoma.""","""['Min Yao', 'Jingbo Yang', 'Lanqing Cao', 'Lian Zhang', 'Shanshan Qu', 'Hongwen Gao']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['A novel trifluoromethyl benzopyran induces G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells.', 'Silymarin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.', 'Tubeimoside-1 induces oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest in human prostate carcinoma cells in vitro.', 'Therapeutic Application of Natural Medicine Monomers in Cancer Treatment.', 'Natural compound Alternol as a novel therapeutic for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Targeting ER Stress with Saikosaponin A to Overcome Resistance under Radiation in Gastric Cancer Cells.', 'Chemotherapeutic Potential of Saikosaponin D: Experimental Evidence.', 'Saikosaponin D improves chemosensitivity of glioblastoma by reducing the its stemness maintenance.', 'Saikosaponin D: review on the antitumour effects, toxicity and pharmacokinetics.', 'Saikosaponin D Inhibits the Proliferation and Promotes the Apoptosis of Rat Hepatic Stellate Cells by Inducing Autophagosome Formation.']"""

We performed a network meta-analysis to identify the optimal radiation regimen.  Methods:   We systematically reviewed data from 27 randomised controlled trials and could group seven radiation regimens as follows: low- and high-dose radiation therapy (LDRT and HDRT), LDRT+ short- or long-term androgen deprivation therapy (LDRT+SADT and LDRT+LADT), HDRT+SADT, hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT), and HFRT+SADT. The main outcomes were overall mortality (OM), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure, cancer-specific mortality, and adverse events.  Results:   For the network meta-analysis of 27 trials, LDRT+LADT and LDRT+SADT were associated with decreased risk of OM as compared with LDRT alone as was LDRT+LADT compared with HDRT. Apart from HFRT, all other treatments were associated with decreased risk of PSA failure as compared with LDRT. HFRT+SADT was associated with decreased risk of cancer-specific mortality as compared with HFRT, LDRT+SADT, HDRT, and LDRT.  Conclusions:   HFRT+SADT therapy might be the most efficacious treatment but with worst toxicity for localised or locally advanced prostate cancer, and HDRT showed excellent efficacy but more adverse events.""","""['Z Zhu', 'J Zhang', 'Y Liu', 'M Chen', 'P Guo', 'K Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['High dose versus conventional dose in external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis of long-term follow-up.', 'A randomized trial comparing hypofractionated and conventionally fractionated three-dimensional external-beam radiotherapy for localized prostate adenocarcinoma : a report on acute toxicity.', 'Surrogate endpoints for prostate cancer-specific mortality after radiotherapy and androgen suppression therapy in men with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer: an analysis of two randomised trials.', 'Higher-than-conventional radiation doses in localized prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'A Review on the Current Treatment Paradigm in High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Factor Analysis and Psychometric Properties Adaption of Chinese Version of the Decisional Engagement Scale (DES-10).', 'Assessment of non-inferiority with meta-analysis: example of hypofractionated radiation therapy in breast and prostate cancer.', 'Host Inflammatory Biomarkers of Disease Severity in Pediatric Community-Acquired Pneumonia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Shared decision-making in prostate cancer patients.']"""

Methods:   The GemOx was preclinically tested for cytotoxic activity in human prostate cancer cell lines. Clinically, patients with CRPC who failed prior docetaxel were treated with gemcitabine 1000 mg m(-2) and oxaliplatin 100 mg m(-2) intravenously every 2 weeks and prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily. The primary end point was the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate.  Results:   The GemOx displayed synergistic effects based on Chou and Talalay analysis.

Here, a dilute-and-shoot form of LC-electrospray ionization-MS requiring half a microliter of blood plasma was employed to simultaneously quantify the relative abundance of these oxidized proteoforms in samples stored at -80 °C, -20 °C, and room temperature and exposed to multiple freeze-thaw cycles and other adverse conditions in order to assess the possibility that protein oxidation may occur as a result of poor sample storage or handling. Samples from a healthy donor and a participant with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes started at the same low level of protein oxidation and behaved similarly; significant increases in albumin oxidation via S-cysteinylation were found to occur within hours at room temperature and days at -20 °C. Methionine oxidation of apoA-I took place on a longer time scale, setting in after albumin oxidation reached a plateau. Freeze-thaw cycles had a minimal effect on protein oxidation. In matched collections, protein oxidation in serum was the same as that in plasma. Albumin and apoA-I oxidation were not affected by sample headspace or the degree to which vials were sealed. ApoA-I, however, was unexpectedly found to oxidize faster in samples with lower surface-area-to-volume ratios. An initial survey of samples from patients with inflammatory conditions normally associated with elevated oxidative stress-including acute myocardial infarction and prostate cancer-demonstrated a lack of detectable apoA-I oxidation. Albumin S-cysteinylation in these samples was consistent with known but relatively brief exposures to temperatures above -30 °C (the freezing point of blood plasma).

Methods:   A 1-day prevalence survey was carried out in 154 French hospital wards. Malnutrition was defined as a body mass index (BMI) <18.5 in patients <75 years old or <21 in patients ≥75 years old and/or body weight loss >10% since disease onset. Oral food intake was measured using a visual analog scale.  Results:   Nutrition status was collected for 1903 patients (1109 men and 794 women, 59.3 ± 13.2 years). Cancer was local in 25%, regional in 31%, and metastatic in 44% of patients. Performance status was 0 or 1 in 49.8%, 2 in 23.7%, 3 or 4 in 19.6% and not available in 6.5% of patients.

Methods:   We carried out systematic literature reviews in the PubMed database to identify manuscripts which contained information regarding either the development process or metric properties of prostate cancer-specific quality of life instruments. Each instrument was evaluated by two experts, independently, using the Evaluating Measures of Patient-Reported Outcomes (EMPRO) tool. An overall and seven attribute-specific EMPRO scores were calculated (range 0-100, worst to best): measurement model, reliability, validity, responsiveness, interpretability, burden and alternative forms.  Results:   Eight instruments and 57 manuscripts (2-15 per instrument) were identified. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) was the best rated (overall EMPRO score 83.1 points). Good results were also obtained by University of California Los Angeles-Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI), Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale (PORPUS) and Prostate Cancer Quality of Life Instrument (PC-QoL) with 77.3, 70.5 and 64.8 points, respectively.

Patients and methods:   A total of 64 prostate cancer specimens, 24 frozen and 40 paraffin-embedded sections, were obtained from patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localized cancer. Real-time RT-PCR was used for mRNA quantification of CXCR4 and SDF-1 in the tumor center (T), tumor front (F) and distant peritumoral tissue (D). Immunohistochemical analysis was used to investigate the expression patterns of CXCR4, E-cadherin and β-catenin. Clinical records of these patients were studied for follow-up data, and the prognostic value of these molecules' expression was statistically assessed.  Results:   CXCR4 mRNA and protein were significantly increased at the tumor front as compared to distant tissue or tumor center. In comparison, SDF-1 mRNA level gradually increased from the tumor center to the distant peritumoral tissue. High CXCR4 at the tumor front was associated with high Gleason score. Low SDF-1 at the tumor front was associated with locally advanced cancer and disease recurrence.

Methods:   Prostate cancer cases (N = 191) detected on a for-cause (clinically indicated) or end-of-study (protocol directed) biopsy, and frequency-matched controls (N = 209), defined as negative for cancer on an end-of-study biopsy, were sampled from the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.

Logistic regression was used to estimate associations.  Results:   Of note, 86.2% of cases and 78.2% of controls had at least one biopsy core (of three assessed) with inflammation in benign areas, most of which was chronic. Men who had at least one biopsy core with inflammation had 1.78 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-3.06] times the odds of prostate cancer compared with men who had zero cores with inflammation. The association was stronger for high-grade disease (Gleason sum 7-10, N = 94; OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.06-4.71). These patterns were present when restricting to cases and controls in whom intraprostatic inflammation was the least likely to have influenced biopsy recommendation because their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was low (<2 ng/mL at biopsy).

The study included 7,824 Asian prostate cancer patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 and reported to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relation of place of birth (foreign born vs. US born) to three outcomes: prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, and T classification, adjusting for age, marital status, Rural-Urban Continuum Code, and SEER registry. All outcome variables were binary using different cutoffs: ≥ 4, ≥ 10 and ≥ 20 ng/ml for PSA; ≥ 7 and ≥ 8 for Gleason score; and ≥ T2 and ≥ T3 for T classification. Elevated PSA was more common among foreign born Asian men regardless of the cut point used. In the analysis comparing foreign born versus US born patients by ethnic group, the association with PSA was most pronounced at cut point of ≥ 20 ng/ml for Chinese men (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.02-2.75), and at cut point of ≥ 4 ng/ml for Japanese men (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.20-6.21).

There was no difference in clinical T classification between foreign-born and US-born Asian men. Inclusion of cases with missing place of birth or restriction of data to those who underwent radical prostatectomy did not substantially change the results.

In PCa patients with high PSA, it is unclear whether PSA itself can be a prognostic factor.  Methods:   Of 642 patients who were diagnosed as PCa, 90 patients with PSA > 100 ng/mL were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into three groups according to PSA level: very high (>1,000 ng/mL), moderately high (200-1,000 ng/mL), and slightly high (100-200 ng/mL).  Results:   There were no significant differences in overall survival or PCa-specific survival (PCaSS) among the three groups. Regardless of PSA level, high M stage and GS significantly reduced PCaSS. When the risk classification was made using M stage and GS (high risk = M1 and GS ≥ 9, low risk = M0 and GS < 9, and intermediate risk = others), PCaSS was significantly different among high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups with 5-year survival rates of 58.2, 80.6, and 100 %, respectively. Although there were no differences in treatment performed during the castration-resistant stage, patients undergoing alternative anti-androgen and zoledronic acid treatment had better PCaSS after being castration-resistant.

Although T cells traffic to cancer lesions in large numbers, they are unable to generate a therapeutic response because of the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, arming T cells with a cytotoxic agent that is capable of killing cancer cells independent of these immunosuppressive signals is a rational approach to enhance their potency. Essentially, the T cells would serve as a cell-based vector, or ""Trojan Horse,"" to selectively deliver a protoxin to disseminated prostate cancer lesions. The selective delivery of a protoxin using T cells represents an ideal method to maximize their therapeutic potency through a ""field effect."" Because systemically infused T cells are expected to traffic to sites of inflammation other than cancer, an additional level of specificity may be needed to prevent toxicity to nontarget tissues. Toward this goal, genetic engineering can be used to make protoxin expression dependent upon T-cell recognition of the prostate-specific membrane antigen by a chimeric antigen receptor. Furthermore, selective activation of the protoxin using a tissue- or tumor-specific protease, such as PSA, can promote further specificity. Thus, T-cell potency can be enhanced by targeted protoxin secretion and greater specificity achieved using combinatorial antigen recognition and protoxin activation.""","""['W Nathaniel Brennen', 'Charles G Drake', 'John T Isaacs']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Engineering T Cells to Express Tumoricidal MDA-7/IL24 Enhances Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Safe engineering of CAR T cells for adoptive cell therapy of cancer using long-term episomal gene\xa0transfer.', 'Challenges and Prospects of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell Therapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Engineering Strategies to Enhance TCR-Based Adoptive T Cell Therapy.', 'Advanced generation anti-prostate specific membrane antigen designer T cells for prostate cancer immunotherapy.', 'Trial Watch: Adoptive cell transfer for oncological indications.', 'Antitumor effector B cells directly kill tumor cells via the Fas/FasL pathway and are regulated by IL-10.']"""

In order to improve documentation, harmonization and standardization based on existing forms and medical concepts are needed. Systematic analysis of forms can contribute to standardization building upon new methods for automated comparison of forms. Objectives of this research are quantification and comparison of data elements for breast and prostate cancer to discover similarities, differences and reuse potential between documentation sets. In addition, common data elements for each entity should be identified by automated comparison of forms.  Materials and methods:   A collection of 57 forms regarding prostate and breast cancer from quality management, registries, clinical documentation of two university hospitals (Erlangen, Münster), research datasets, certification requirements and trial documentation were transformed into the Operational Data Model (ODM). These ODM-files were semantically enriched with concept codes and analyzed with the compareODM algorithm. Comparison results were aggregated and lists of common concepts were generated. Grid images, dendrograms and spider charts were used for illustration.  Results:   Overall, 1008 data elements for prostate cancer and 1232 data elements for breast cancer were analyzed. Average routine documentation consists of 390 data elements per disease entity and site. Comparisons of forms identified up to 20 comparable data elements in cancer conference forms from both hospitals. Urology forms contain up to 53 comparable data elements with quality management and up to 21 with registry forms. Urology documentation of both hospitals contains up to 34 comparable items with international common data elements. Clinical documentation sets share up to 24 comparable data elements with trial documentation. Within clinical documentation administrative items are most common comparable items. Selected common medical concepts are contained in up to 16 forms.  Discussion:   The amount of documentation for cancer patients is enormous. There is an urgent need for standardized structured single source documentation. Semantic annotation is time-consuming, but enables automated comparison between different form types, hospital sites and even languages. This approach can help to identify common data elements in medical documentation. Standardization of forms and building up forms on the basis of coding systems is desirable. Several comparable data elements within the analyzed forms demonstrate the harmonization potential, which would enable better data reuse.  Conclusion:   Identifying common data elements in medical forms from different settings with systematic and automated form comparison is feasible.""","""['Rainer Krumm', 'Axel Semjonow', 'Joke Tio', 'Heike Duhme', 'Thomas Bürkle', 'Jörg Haier', 'Martin Dugas', 'Bernhard Breil']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Biomed Inform""","""['Semantic enrichment of medical forms - semi-automated coding of ODM-elements via web services.', 'Interoperability in clinical research: from metadata registries to semantically annotated CDISC ODM.', 'Analyses of medical data models - identifying common concepts and items in a repository of medical forms.', 'Clinical data mining and research in the allergy office.', 'Digitizing paper electrocardiograms: Status and challenges.', 'Standardized Description of the Feature Extraction Process to Transform Raw Data Into Meaningful Information for Enhancing Data Reuse: Consensus Study.', 'Design and methodological characteristics of studies using observational routinely collected health data for investigating the link between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases: protocol for a meta-research study.', 'Examining the Landscape of Prognostic Factors and Clinical Outcomes for Cancer Control.', 'Common data elements of breast cancer for research databases: A systematic review.', 'EMR-integrated minimal core dataset for routine health care and multiple research settings: A case study for neuroinflammatory demyelinating diseases.']"""

Nano-formulations have potential to minimise the adverse effects of chemotherapy. We present here a liposomal formulation encapsulating both the anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR) and emetine (Eme) for enhanced cytotoxic effect against AML cells. Eme could be loaded into the PEGylated liposomes together with DNR by the acid precipitation principle, with a loading efficiency of Eme at about 50% of that of DNR. The liposome surface was modified with folate to enhance drug loading into cells, giving higher cytotoxic activity. Both intracellular drug loading and cytotoxic activity could be further increased by anti-folate treatment of AML cells with methotrexate (MTX). The combination of DNR and Eme also increased drug loading in MTX-treated cells compared to DNR alone. Liposomes with both DNR and Eme were particularly efficient against AMLs with deficient p53. In conclusion, we have produced a multi-functional liposomal anti-leukaemic drug formulation designed to overcome some of the problems in anthracycline chemotherapy: (1) Combination of DNR and Eme to diminish drug resistance. (2) Using PEGylated stealth liposomes to minimise adverse side-effects. (3) Molecules on the liposomal surface target proteins on AML-cells ensure selectivity, which was enhanced by priming the leukaemia cells with MTX.""","""['Lene Myhren', 'Ida Mostrøm Nilssen', 'Valérie Nicolas', 'Stein Ove Døskeland', 'Gillian Barratt', 'Lars Herfindal']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Pharm Biopharm""","""['Preparation, therapeutic efficacy and intratumoral localization of targeted daunorubicin liposomes conjugating folate-PEG-CHEMS.', 'Development of synthetic peptide-modified liposomes with LDL receptor targeting capacity and improved anticancer activity.', 'In vivo antitumor activity of folate receptor-targeted liposomal daunorubicin in a murine leukemia model.', 'The use of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) in acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Immunoliposomes in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Therapy: An Overview of Possible Targets and Obstacles.', 'Development and application of nanomaterials, nanotechnology and nanomedicine for treating hematological malignancies.', 'New prodrugs and analogs of the phenazine 5,10-dioxide natural products iodinin and myxin promote selective cytotoxicity towards human acute myeloid leukemia cells.', 'Targeting Approaches of Nanomedicines in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'Recent Treatment Advances and the Role of Nanotechnology, Combination Products, and Immunotherapy in Changing the Therapeutic Landscape of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'A novel poly-oxygenated flavone glucoside from aerial parts of the Brazilian plant Neoglaziovia variegata (Bromeliaceae).']"""

Antibody microarrays allow for high-throughput and high-sensitivity detection of multiple proteins simultaneously, providing a powerful tool for biomarker screening. Here, we selected 46 patients with PCa and 42 controls with BPH, and compared the serum levels of different cytokines in PCa and BPH patients using antibody microarrays. The results indicated that serum levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and CC chemokine ligand 18 (CCL-18) were remarkably higher in PCa patients than those in BPH patients, while serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6 (IGFBP-6) and Fas receptor (Fas), also called tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (TNFRSF6), were significantly lower. M-CSF and Fas/TNFRSF6 have been reported to be associated with PCa pathogenesis, and thus were used as positive controls in the present study. CCL-18 is a chemokine primarily involved in recruitment of the adaptive immune system, while IGFBP-6 has been reported to inhibit proliferation of PCa cells. Serum levels of these four cytokines could distinguish PCa from BPH with high sensitivity and high specificity. Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was above 0.925 and 0.835 for CCL-18 and IGFBP-6, respectively, implying their high diagnostic value.

The immunohistochemical analysis in normal tissue revealed specific AGR3 expression in intrahepatic bile duct cholangiocytes which was not present in liver hepatocytes. Consequently we analyzed AGR3 expression in 74 representative samples of puncture biopsies, tissue excisions and resection specimens from which 48 samples were diagnosed as HCC and 26 as ICC. Our results showed AGR3 expression negative and weakly positive respectively in hepatocellular carcinomas compared to stronger AGR3 positivity in cholangiocellular carcinomas. AGR3 expression statistically significantly correlated to acid mucopolysaccharide expression and negatively correlated to glypican-3 expression. We conclude that according to receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis AGR3 expression is relatively specific for ICC and is potentially linked to mucosecretion, which may indicate potential implication in treatment resistance.""","""['Veronika Brychtova', 'Vita Zampachova', 'Roman Hrstka', 'Pavel Fabian', 'Jiri Novak', 'Marketa Hermanova', 'Borivoj Vojtesek']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['Evaluation of immunohistochemical markers for differential diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Upregulation of Glypican-3 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma but downregulation in cholangiocarcinoma indicates its differential diagnosis value in primary liver cancers.', 'Identification of novel candidate tumour marker genes for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma--different prognosis, pathogenesis and therapy.', 'Biomarkers of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: diagnosis and response to therapy.', 'Over-expression of Anterior Gradient 3 Is Associated With Tumor Progression and Poor Survival in Gastric Cancer.', 'Anterior gradient proteins in gastrointestinal cancers: from cell biology to pathophysiology.', 'Clinical Value of Machine Learning-Based Ultrasomics in Preoperative Differentiation Between Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: A Multicenter Study.', 'The Anterior GRadient (AGR) family proteins in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'AGR3 Regulates Airway Epithelial Junctions in Patients with Frequent Exacerbations of COPD.']"""

In humans, TXA(2) signals through the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the T prostanoid receptor, two structurally related receptors transcriptionally regulated by distinct promoters, Prm1 and Prm3, respectively, within the TP gene. Focusing on TPα, the current study investigated its expression and transcriptional regulation through Prm1 in prostate and breast cancers. Expression of TPα correlated with increasing prostate and breast tissue tumor grade while the TXA(2) mimetic U46619 promoted both proliferation and migration of the respective prostate (PC3) and breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231) derived-carcinoma cell lines. Through 5' deletional and genetic reporter analyses, several functional upstream repressor regions (URRs) were identified within Prm1 in PC3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells while site-directed mutagenesis identified the tumor suppressors Wilms' tumor (WT)1 and hypermethylated in cancer (HIC) 1 as the trans-acting factors regulating those repressor regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies confirmed that WT1 binds in vivo to multiple GC-enriched WT1 cis-elements within the URRs of Prm1 in PC3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, ChIP analyses established that HIC1 binds in vivo to the HIC1((b))cis-element within Prm1 in PC3 and MCF-7 cells but not in the MDA-MB-231 carcinoma line. Collectively, these data establish that WT1 and HIC1, both tumor suppressors implicated in prostate and breast cancers, transcriptionally repress TPα expression and thereby provide a strong genetic basis for understanding the role of TXA2 in the progression of certain human cancers.""","""['Garret L Keating', 'Helen M Reid', 'Sarah B Eivers', 'Eamon P Mulvaney', 'B Therese Kinsella']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['The role of WT1 in breast cancer: clinical implications, biological effects and molecular mechanism.', 'Regulated expression of the TPβ isoform of the human T prostanoid receptor by the tumour suppressors FOXP1 and NKX3.1: Implications for the role of thromboxane in prostate cancer.', ""The Wilms' tumour suppressor protein WT1 acts as a key transcriptional repressor of the human thromboxane A2 receptor gene in megakaryocytes."", 'Differential expression of the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the human T Prostanoid receptor during chronic inflammation of the prostate: Role for FOXP1 in the transcriptional regulation of TPβ during monocyte-macrophage differentiation.', 'Transcriptional Regulation of the Human Thromboxane A2 Receptor Gene by Wilms’ Tumour (WT)1.', 'The Role and Regulation of Thromboxane A2 Signaling in Cancer-Trojan Horses and Misdirection.', 'Prostaglandin Pathways: Opportunities for Cancer Prevention and Therapy.', 'Role of Nurr1 in Carcinogenesis and Tumor Immunology: A State of the Art Review.', 'The role of WT1 in breast cancer: clinical implications, biological effects and molecular mechanism.', 'Oxidized Products of α-Linolenic Acid Negatively Regulate Cellular Survival and Motility of Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

Genetic and lifestyle factors have been implicated. Better understanding of prostate cancer rates in West African men would help clarify why black American men have such high rates since the groups share genetic ancestry and yet have different lifestyles and screening practices. To estimate the prostate cancer burden in West African men we performed a population based screening study with biopsy confirmation in Ghana.  Materials and methods:   We randomly selected 1,037 healthy men 50 to 74 years old from Accra, Ghana for prostate cancer screening with prostate specific antigen testing and digital rectal examination. Men with a positive screen result (positive digital rectal examination or prostate specific antigen greater than 2.5 ng/ml) underwent transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies.  Results:   Of the 1,037 men 154 (14.9%) had a positive digital rectal examination and 272 (26.2%) had prostate specific antigen greater than 2.5 ng/ml, including 166 with prostate specific antigen greater than 4.0 ng/ml. A total of 352 men (33.9%) had a positive screen by prostate specific antigen or digital rectal examination and 307 (87%) underwent biopsy. Of these men 73 were confirmed to have prostate cancer, yielding a 7.0% screen detected prostate cancer prevalence (65 patients), including 5.8% with prostate specific antigen greater than 4.0 ng/ml.  Conclusions:   In this relatively unscreened population in Africa the screen detected prostate cancer prevalence is high, suggesting a possible role of genetics in prostate cancer etiology and the disparity in prostate cancer risk between black and white American men.

Materials and methods:   A total of 3,258 participants who underwent biopsy (including 1,902 men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer) were identified from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial. The associations of body mass index with prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer were examined using logistic regression, adjusting for age, race, body mass index adjusted prostate specific antigen, digital rectal examination, family history of prostate cancer, biopsy history, prostate specific antigen velocity, and time between study entry and the last biopsy. The prediction models were compared with our previously developed body mass index adjusted Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial prostate cancer risk calculator.  Results:   Of the study subjects 49.1% were overweight and 29.3% were obese. After adjustment, among men without a known family history of prostate cancer, increased body mass index was not associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer (per one-unit increase in logBMI OR 0.83, p=0.54) but was significantly associated with a higher risk of high grade prostate cancer (ie Gleason score 7 or greater prostate cancer) (OR 2.31, p=0.03). For men with a known family history of prostate cancer the risks of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer increased rapidly as body mass index increased (prostate cancer OR 3.73, p=0.02; high grade prostate cancer OR 7.95, p=0.002). The previously developed risk calculator generally underestimated the risks of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Body mass index provided independently predictive information regarding the risks of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer after adjusting for other risk factors.

Objective:   We aim to determine the impact of race on the risk of upgrading, upstaging, and positive surgical margins (PSM) at radical prostatectomy (RP) among men eligible for active surveillance.  Design, setting, and participants:   We studied men with low-risk PCa treated with RP at two centers. Low clinical risk was defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. Outcome variables were upgrading, upstaging, and PSMs at surgery. Associations between race and the outcomes were evaluated with logistic regression adjusted for age, relationship status, diagnostic prostate-specific antigen level, percentage of positive biopsy cores, surgical approach, year of diagnosis, and clinical site.  Results and limitations:   Of 9304 men diagnosed with PCa, 4231 were low risk and underwent RP within 1 yr. Men were categorized as AA (n=273; 6.5%), Caucasian (n=3771; 89.1%), or other racial/ethnic group (Other; n=187; 4.4%). AA men had a significantly younger mean age (58.7 yr; standard deviation: ±7.06), and fewer (85%) were married or had a partner. Upgrading (34%) and upstaging (13%) rates did not significantly differ among the groups. The PSM rate was significantly higher in AA men (31%) than in the Caucasian (21%) and Other (20%) groups (p<0.01). We found an association between race group and PSM rate (p<0.03), with higher odds of PSMs in AA men versus Caucasian men (odds ratio [OR]: 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.47). No statistically significant associations between race and rates of upgrading and upstaging were found. This study was limited by the relatively low proportion of AA men in the cohort.  Conclusions:   Among clinically low-risk men who underwent RP, AA men had a higher likelihood of PSMs compared with Caucasian men. We did not find statistically significantly different rates of upgrading and upstaging between the race groups.  Patient summary:   We analyzed two large groups of men with what appeared to be low-risk prostate cancer based on the initial biopsy findings.

Sulforaphane inhibits histone deacetylases, leading to the transcriptional activation of genes including tumor suppressor genes. The compound has attracted considerable attention in the chemoprevention of prostate cancer. Here we tested the hypothesis that sulforaphane is not specific for tumor suppressor genes but also activates loci such as long terminal repeats (LTRs), which might impair genome stability. Studies were conducted using chemically pure sulforaphane in primary human IMR-90 fibroblasts and in broccoli sprout feeding studies in healthy adults. Sulforaphane (2.0 μM) caused an increase in LTR transcriptional activity in cultured cells. Consumption of broccoli sprouts (34, 68 or 102 g) by human volunteers caused a dose dependent elevation in LTR mRNA in circulating leukocytes, peaking at more than a 10-fold increase. This increase in transcript levels was associated with an increase in histone H3 K9 acetylation marks in LTR 15 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects consuming sprouts.

Results:   The number of patients annually seen/treated ranged from 285 to 5000. Breast, cervix, head and neck, gastrointestinal and prostate cancer were the top five cancers overall. Eight (53%) institutions were without linear accelerators, four (27%) had a single one, whereas one institution each had two, three and four linear accelerators. The number of cobalt machines ranged from 0 to 2 (median 1). Most centres still prefer to use fractionated radiotherapy regimens over single-fraction regimens in bone metastasis, although most centres are now using single-fraction radiotherapy in retreatments. Radiotherapy in brain metastasis and metastatic spinal cord compression mostly conform to worldwide standards. Lung and liver metastases are rarely irradiated, largely as a consequence of the lack of modern radiotherapy technology. Locally advanced disease in various tumour sites was mostly palliated, in agreement with current evidence-based practices.

Methods:   Study patients are men with inherited and/or early-onset prostate cancer enrolled in the University of Michigan Prostate Cancer Genetics Project. Men enrolled in Prostate Cancer Genetics Project were surveyed to determine statin medication use history from 1999 to 2009. Diagnosis and treatment data were taken from medical records. BCR was defined as a single increase in prostate-specific antigen level to ≥0.4 ng/mL after treatment with RRP. Statin use was modeled as a time-dependent variable, and BCR after RRP was both examined using crude Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for known clinical prognostic factors.  Results:   A total of 539 men treated with RRP were included in this study. Of these, 47.9% of men used statin medications, and 115 (21%) men experienced a recurrence. Ever-statin use was not associated with risk of recurrence in crude models (hazards ratio=1.04, 95% confidence interval=0.72-1.49, P value=.86) or in models adjusted for clinical characteristics (hazards ratio=1.06, 95% confidence interval=0.68-1.64, P value=.81). Furthermore, no association was observed when comparing men with high-Gleason grade cancers with those with low-Gleason grade cancers.

However, new more specific biomarkers allowing a better differentiation of cancer from non-malignant prostate diseases are necessary. Glycosylation of PSA gives rise to different forms of the protein which can be separated into several isoforms by analytical techniques, such as CE. Because PSA glycosylation is influenced by pathological conditions, the CE pattern of PSA isoforms could be different in prostate cancer than in non-malignant prostate diseases. To study this CE pattern of PSA, prior purification of the protein from the biological fluid is mandatory. In this study an immunoaffinity chromatography method which allows PSA purification without altering the CE pattern is developed. An in-house prepared column produced with commercial anti-PSA antibodies is employed. The use of 1 M propionic acid as elution agent provides higher than 40% recovery of high purity PSA. CE analysis of PSA immunopurified from seminal plasma of a healthy individual shows the same 8 peaks as the commercially available PSA standard. Sample preparation only requires dilution with phosphate buffered saline prior to immunoaffinity purification. High repeatability for the sample preparation step was achieved (RSD% for percentage of corrected peak area in the range 0.6-5.3 for CE analysis of three independently purified seminal plasma aliquots compared to range 0.8-4.9 for a given aliquot analyzed three times by CE).

In addition, patients with certain types of cancer are more prone to bone injury. However, studies are needed that examine the role of cancer site and metastasis on the relationship between cancer and death following traumatic injury.  Methods:   A total of 4201 cancer patients from 2000 to 2009 in the Illinois Hospital Discharge and Illinois Trauma Registry, and 4201 patients without cancer met eligibility criteria (e.g., fell and were injured; 50-96 years old). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between cancer and death following traumatic injury, including models stratified by cancer site and metastasis.  Results:   The demographic characteristics, prevalence of comorbid conditions, and injury severity and type did not differ substantially between patients with and without diagnoses for cancer. In the main adjusted model, patients with cancer were more likely to die during the course of hospitalization after a fall than those without cancer (OR=2.58; CI 95%: 1.91-3.49). Patients with metastatic malignancies had a higher risk of in-hospital death than patients without metastasis (adjusted OR=3.59 and OR=2.18, respectively). Patients with diagnoses for all specific cancer sites, except prostate and breast, were also significantly more likely to die.

Results:   The study of each protein separately among sera PSA levels showed that PSMA expression and angiogenic activity have the highest intensity in PC patients with serum PSA levels>20 ng/mL. Nevertheless, the lowest tissue PSA expression was found in PC patients with this latter sera PSA group. The most relevant results showed that in PC patients (PSA+, PSMA+) and (PSA-, PSMA+) profile were found to be inversely related to sera PSA levels. In PC patients, a high immunoexpression of (PSA+, PSMA+) profile has detected in the sera PSA group>20 ng/mL; whereas a high immunoexpression of (PSA-, PSMA+) profile was detected in the sera PSA group between 0 and 4 ng/mL.

The evolution of PC to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) represents real problems of clinical management, in consequence to the limited therapeutic options. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play an important role in gene expression and function regulation. The increased evidence that miRNAs are involved in cancer development and progression has made them potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and aggressiveness. Our purpose was to identify a miRNA expression profile associated with the development of CRPC. We firstly observed a miRNA expression profile differentially expressed between the castration-resistant (CR) PC3 cell line and the hormone-sensitive LnCaP cell line, where miR-7, miR-221, and miR-222 were upregulated in PC3 (11.3-fold increase, P = 0.012; 11.3-fold increase, P = 0.002; 8.6-fold increase, P = 0.002, respectively). We also observed that the trend of miR-1233 expression levels was higher in PC3 (3.7-fold increase, P = 0.057). These miRNAs differentially expressed in vitro were studied in a peripheral whole-blood samples from PC patients. We observed that patients presenting an early CR acquisition (≤ 20 months) had higher expression levels of miR-7 and miR-221 (P = 0.034 and P = 0.036, respectively). Furthermore, we found that patients diagnosed with high-Gleason score tumors and presenting simultaneous higher miR-7 expression levels have a significant reduce time to CR compared with patients who present lower miR-7 expression levels (11 vs. 51 months, log-rank test P = 0.004). We also found that patients diagnosed with high-Gleason score tumors and higher expression levels of miR-221 have an early CRPC compared to patients with lower miR-221 expression levels (10 vs. 46 months, log-rank test P = 0.012). We observed a significantly lower overall survival in patients with higher peripheral whole-blood expression levels of miR-7 (28 vs. 116 months, log-rank test P = 0.001). Our results suggest that miR-7 and miR-221 peripheral whole-blood expression levels can be potential predictive biomarkers of CRPC development.""","""['Juliana I Santos', 'Ana L Teixeira', 'Francisca Dias', 'Joaquina Maurício', 'Francisco Lobo', 'António Morais', 'Rui Medeiros']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Upregulation of miR-3195, miR-3687 and miR-4417 is associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exosomal miR-1290 and miR-375 as prognostic markers in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA expression signature of castration-resistant prostate cancer: the microRNA-221/222 cluster functions as a tumour suppressor and disease progression marker.', 'Non-coding RNAs in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', 'Role of MicroRNA-7 (MiR-7) in Cancer Physiopathology.', 'MicroRNA-7 as a Potential Biomarker for Prognosis in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Expression of microRNAs 16, 20a, 150 and 155 in anal squamous intraepithelial lesions from high-risk groups.', 'Association of microRNA-7 and its binding partner CDR1-AS with the prognosis and prediction of 1st-line tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   From December 2008 to February 2010, 92 prostate cancer patients scheduled for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (77 Gy in 35 fractions) using fiducial marker-based position verification were randomly assigned to receive magnesium oxide (500 mg twice a day) or placebo during radiotherapy.

Results:   There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in translation and rotation of the prostate between treatment fractions, except for the rotation around the cranial caudal axis. However, the difference was less than 1° and therefore considered not clinically relevant. There was no significant difference in the amount of rectal filling and rectal air pockets between the treatment arms.

Specific attention was given to pancreatic cancer, the only major neoplasm showing unfavorable trends in both sexes.  Patients and methods:   Population and death certification data from stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, prostate, leukemias and total cancers were obtained from the World Health Organisation database and Eurostat. Figures were derived for the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. Projected 2014 numbers of deaths by age group were obtained by linear regression on estimated numbers of deaths over the most recent time period identified by a joinpoint regression model.  Results:   In the EU in 2014, 1,323,600 deaths from cancer are predicted (742,500 men and 581,100 women), corresponding to standardized death rates of 138.1/100,000 men and 84.7/100,000 women, falling by 7% and 5%, respectively, since 2009. In men, predicted rates for the three major cancers (lung, colorectum and prostate cancer) are lower than in 2009, falling by 8%, 4% and 10%, respectively. In women, breast and colorectal cancers had favorable trends (-9% and -7%), but female lung cancer rates are predicted to rise 8%. Pancreatic cancer is the only neoplasm with a negative outlook in both sexes. Only in the young (25-49 years), EU trends become more favorable in men, while women keep registering slight predicted rises.  Conclusions:   Cancer mortality predictions for 2014 confirm the overall favorable cancer mortality trend in the EU, translating to an overall 26% fall in men since its peak in 1988, and 20% in women, and the avoidance of over 250,000 deaths in 2014 compared with the peak rate.

Progression to CRPC after androgen ablation therapy is predominantly driven by deregulated androgen receptor (AR) signalling. Despite the success of recently approved therapies targeting AR signalling, such as abiraterone and second-generation anti-androgens including MDV3100 (also known as enzalutamide), durable responses are limited, presumably owing to acquired resistance. Recently, JQ1 and I-BET762 two selective small-molecule inhibitors that target the amino-terminal bromodomains of BRD4, have been shown to exhibit anti-proliferative effects in a range of malignancies. Here we show that AR-signalling-competent human CRPC cell lines are preferentially sensitive to bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibition. BRD4 physically interacts with the N-terminal domain of AR and can be disrupted by JQ1 (refs 11, 13). Like the direct AR antagonist MDV3100, JQ1 disrupted AR recruitment to target gene loci. By contrast with MDV3100, JQ1 functions downstream of AR, and more potently abrogated BRD4 localization to AR target loci and AR-mediated gene transcription, including induction of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and its oncogenic activity. In vivo, BET bromodomain inhibition was more efficacious than direct AR antagonism in CRPC xenograft mouse models. Taken together, these studies provide a novel epigenetic approach for the concerted blockade of oncogenic drivers in advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Irfan A Asangani', 'Vijaya L Dommeti', 'Xiaoju Wang', 'Rohit Malik', 'Marcin Cieslik', 'Rendong Yang', 'June Escara-Wilke', 'Kari Wilder-Romans', 'Sudheer Dhanireddy', 'Carl Engelke', 'Mathew K Iyer', 'Xiaojun Jing', 'Yi-Mi Wu', 'Xuhong Cao', 'Zhaohui S Qin', 'Shaomeng Wang', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Prostate cancer: novel targeting of androgen signalling in CRPC.', 'Prostate cancer: BETting on epigenetic therapy.', 'BETting on a new prostate cancer treatment.', 'What is the next generation therapeutic strategy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BET bromodomain inhibitors--a novel epigenetic approach in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'What is the next generation therapeutic strategy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BET Bromodomain Inhibitors Enhance Efficacy and Disrupt Resistance to AR Antagonists in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploitation of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Transcription Factor Dependencies by the Novel BET Inhibitor ABBV-075.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Etiology of super-enhancer reprogramming and activation in cancer.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Natural compounds ursolic acid and digoxin exhibit inhibitory activities to cancer cells in RORγ-dependent and -independent manner.', 'Targeting bromodomain-containing proteins: research advances of drug discovery.']"""

Materials and methods:   In this study, 282 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer who received RP underwent pretreatment MRI using a phased-array coil at 3 T, including T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). MRI variables included apparent tumor presence on combined imaging sequences, extracapsular extension, and tumor size on DWI or DCE-MRI. Clinical variables included baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical stage, and Gleason score at biopsy. The relationship between clinical and imaging variables and biochemical recurrence was evaluated using Cox regression analysis.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 26 months, biochemical recurrence developed in 61 patients (22%). Univariate analysis revealed that all the imaging and clinical variables were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, however, baseline PSA level (p = 0.002), Gleason score at biopsy (p = 0.024), and apparent tumor presence on combined T2WI, DWI, and DCE-MRI (p = 0.047) were the only significant independent predictors of biochemical recurrence. Of the independent predictors, apparent tumor presence on combined T2WI, DWI, and DCE-MRI showed the highest hazard ratio (2.38) compared with baseline PSA level (hazard ratio, 1.05) and Gleason score at biopsy (hazard ratio, 1.34).  Conclusion:   The apparent tumor presence on combined T2WI, DWI, and DCE-MRI of pretreatment MRI is an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence after RP.

Exposure to lifestyle (changes in dietary habits), environmental factors (exposure to organochlorine pesticides) and modifications in diagnostic and screening procedures, are favored etiological hypotheses. The aim of the present study is to describe and interpret prostate cancer incidence trends over the past 25 years (1981-2005) in Martinique.  Methods:   Data on incident prostate cancer cases from 1981 to 2005 were obtained from the population-based Martinique Cancer Registry. World age-standardised incidence rates were calculated and an age-period-cohort model was used to determine average annual variations for prostate cancer during the study period. Age and period effects were assessed, employing the method proposed by Clayton and Schifflers. Relative changes in prostate cancer incidence, at five-year intervals between 1981 and 2005, were also studied with an organochlorine pesticide exposure index, built as a proxy of the relative intensity of chlordecone use on the island between 1973 and 1993.  Results:   Prostate cancer incidence was found to increase by 5.07% annually between 1981 and 2005. Compared to 1981-1985, prostate cancer relative risk, in men aged 50-74 years and 75 years and above was respectively 5.98% and 3.07% from 2001 to 2005. An inverse association between population pesticide exposure levels and prostate cancer risk was also highlighted, with highest prostate cancer incidences observed in urban zones showing the lowest soil contamination levels by the chlordecone pesticide (zone 1).  Conclusion:   No conclusive association was found between the intensity of pesticide use and the subsequent rise in prostate cancer incidence. However, it remains necessary to develop and reinforce continuous monitoring of prostate cancer incidence and mortality trends on the island. Further studies are also needed in order to consider other risk factors such as modifications in diagnostic and screening procedures over the last 25 years.""","""['Moustapha Dieye', 'Rishika Banydeen', 'Jonathan Macni', 'Stephane Michel', 'Jacqueline Veronique-Baudin', 'Annie Sasco', 'Patrick Escarmant', 'Clarisse Joachim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Res Notes""","""['Why pesticides could be a common cause of prostate and breast cancers in the French Caribbean Island, Martinique.

In randomized trials, dose escalation was correlated with better biochemical control but also with higher rectal toxicity. A prospective multicenter phase II study was carried out to evaluate the safety, clinical and dosimetric effects of the hydrogel prostate-rectum spacer. Here we present the 12 months toxicity results of this trial.  Methods:   Fifty two patients with localized prostate cancer received a transperineal PEG hydrogel injection between the prostate and rectum, and then received IMRT to a dose of 78 Gy. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity were recorded during treatment and at 3, 6 and 12 months following irradiation by using the RTOG/EORTC criteria. Additionally, proctoscopy was performed 12 months after treatment and the results were scored using the Vienna Rectoscopy Scale (VRS).  Results:   Of the patients treated 39.6% and 12.5% experienced acute Grade 1 and Grade 2 GI toxicity, respectively. There was no Grade 3 or Grade 4 acute GI toxicity experienced in the study. Only 4.3% showed late Grade 1 GI toxicity, and there was no late Grade 2 or greater GI toxicity experienced in the study. A total of 41.7%, 35.4% and 2.1% of the men experienced acute Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU toxicity, respectively. There was no Grade 4 acute GU toxicity experienced in the study. Late Grade 1 and Grade 2 GU toxicity was experienced in 17.0% and 2.1% of the patients, respectively. There was no late Grade 3 or greater GU toxicity experienced in the study. Seventy one percent of the patients had a VRS score of 0, and one patient (2%) had Grade 3 teleangiectasia. There was no evidence of ulceration, stricture or necrosis at 12 months.

Material and methods:   In this article, we want to show the number of patients diagnosed and treated due to prostate cancer in the Cantonal Hospital Bihac, Bosnia and Herzegovina, over a two year period. After examining the medical records, we selected 70 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Average age was 70.9 years (51-91 years). The total PSA ranged from 1.6 to 3332 ng/ml. For each patient is determined the PSA ratio f/t PSA, with an average value of 0.13 (0.02 to 0.627).  Results:   From the data analysis, we concluded that nearly half of the patients (30 patients), came to the urology clinic with advanced disease.

Methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare and Texas Cancer Registry-Medicare databases to analyze claims data for 13,488 patients dying as a result of lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, melanoma, and pancreas cancers from 2000 to 2009. Logistic regression modeling was used to conduct adjusted analyses regarding influence of demographic, clinical, and health services variables on receipt of types of RT. Costs were calculated in 2009 US dollars.  Results:   The proportion of patients treated with two-dimensional RT decreased from 74.9% of those receiving RT in the last 30 days of life in 2000 to 32.7% in 2009 (P < .001). Those receiving three-dimensional RT increased from 27.2% in 2000 to 58.5% in 2009 (P < .001). The proportion of patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy in the last 30 days of life increased from 0% in 2000 to 6.2% in 2009 (P < .001), and those undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery increased from 0% in 2000 to 5.0% in 2009 (P < .001). The adjusted mean costs of per-patient RT services delivered in the last 30 days of life were higher in the years 2007 to 2009.

Methods:   In all, 28 patients with prostate cancer were enrolled in this study. After the placement of an endorectal balloon, the planning target volume (PTV) was treated to a dose of 70 Gy in 35 fractions. A simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) of 76 Gy (2.17 Gy per fraction and per day) was delivered to a smaller target volume. All patients underwent daily prostate-aligned IGRT by megavoltage CT (MVCT). Retrospectively, three different setup approaches were evaluated by comparison to the prostate alignment: setup by skin alignment, endorectal balloon alignment, and automatic registration by bones.  Results:   A total of 2,940 setup deviations were analyzed in 980 fractions. Compared to prostate alignment, skin mark alignment was associated with substantial displacements, which were ≥ 8 mm in 13%, 5%, and 44% of all fractions in the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical directions, respectively. Endorectal balloon alignment yielded displacements ≥ 8 mm in 3%, 19%, and 1% of all setups; and ≥ 3 mm in 27%, 58%, and 18% of all fractions, respectively. For bone matching, the values were 1%, 1%, and 2% and 3%, 11%, and 34%, respectively.  Conclusion:   For prostate radiotherapy, setup by skin marks alone is inappropriate for patient positioning due to the fact that, during almost half of the fractions, parts of the prostate would not be targeted successfully with an 8-mm safety margin. Bone matching performs better but not sufficiently for safety margins ≤ 3 mm. Endorectal balloon matching can be combined with bone alignment to increase accuracy in the vertical direction when prostate-based setup is not available. Daily prostate alignment remains the gold standard for high-precision radiotherapy with small safety margins.""","""['Kilian Schiller', 'Alessia Petrucci', 'Hans Geinitz', 'Tibor Schuster', 'Hanno Specht', 'Severin Kampfer', 'Marciana Nona Duma']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer: Analysis of interfractional errors and acute toxicity.', 'Dosimetric implications of inter- and intrafractional prostate positioning errors during tomotherapy : Comparison of gold marker-based registrations with native MVCT.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy and the dosimetric impact of inter- and intrafractional motion on the planning target volume for prostate cancer patients.', 'Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'PTV margin definition in hypofractionated IGRT of localized prostate cancer using cone beam CT and orthogonal image pairs with fiducial markers.', 'Toxicity of dose-escalated radiotherapy up to 84\xa0Gy for prostate cancer.', 'Definitive, intensity modulated tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost for prostate cancer patients - Long term data on toxicity and biochemical control.', 'A comparison of interfraction setup error, patient comfort, and therapist acceptance for 2 different prostate radiation therapy immobilization devices.', 'The impact of androgen deprivation therapy on setup errors during external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Individualized radiotherapy by combining high-end irradiation and magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

In the current study, we investigated the effect of docetaxel and sunitinib on CEP/CEC kinetics and clinical response in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.  Patients and methods:   Chemonaive patients with CRPC were enrolled in this study to receive either sunitinib (37.5 mg/d), in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m2) or docetaxel alone. CEP and CEC kinetics were analyzed for every cycle. The primary objective was to compare CEP/CEC pharmacodynamics between both treatment arms. We also investigated if CEC/CEP spikes, induced by MTD docetaxel, are suppressed by sunitinib in patients treated with docetaxel/sunitinib relative to docetaxel monotherapy.  Results:   A total of 27 patients were enrolled. We observed a significant increase of CEP/CEC (total/viable) counts over time within each cycle (coefficients 0.29233, 0.22092 and 0.26089, respectively; p<0.001). However, no differences between the treatment groups, in terms of CEP and CEC kinetics, were detected. In the docetaxel monotherapy arm 4 (30%) patients responded to therapy with a 50% PSA decline, while 9 (64%) patients showed a PSA decline in the combination group (n.s.). The median PFS in the docetaxel monotherapy group was 3.1 months (2.6-3.6 months, 95% CI) and 6.2 months (4.9-7.4 months, 95% CI; p = 0.062) in the combination arm. Sunitinib/docetaxel was reasonably well tolerated and toxicity manageable.  Conclusion:   In summary, no significant differences in CEC and CEP kinetics between the treatment arms were observed, although a highly significant increase of CEPs/CECs within each cycle over time was detected. These results mirror the challenge we have to face when employing anti-angiogenic strategies in CRPC. Additional preclinical research is needed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. However, docetaxel/sunitinib therapy resulted in a better response in terms of PSA decline and a trend towards improved PFS.

Understanding all molecular mechanisms contributing to uncontrolled growth is important to obtain effective treatment strategies for hormone refractory prostate cancers (HRPC). The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) affects a number of biological processes including cell growth and differentiation. Several studies have revealed that exogenous AhR ligands inhibit cellular proliferation but recent evidence suggests AhR may possess intrinsic functions that promote cellular proliferation in the absence of exogenous ligands.  Methods/results:   qRT-PCR and western blot analysis was used to determine AhR mRNA and protein expression in hormone sensitive LNCaP cells as well as hormone refractory DU145, PC3 and PC3M prostate cancer cell lines. LNCaP cells express AhR mRNA and protein at a much lower level than the hormone refractory cell models. Cellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry revealed nuclear localization of AhR in the established hormone refractory cell lines while LNCaP cells are devoid of nuclear AhR protein. qRT-PCR analysis used to assess basal CYP1B1 levels and a xenobiotic responsive element binding assay confirmed ligand independent transcriptional activity of AhR in DU145, PC3 and PC3M cells. Basal CYP1B1 levels were decreased by treatment with specific AhR inhibitor, CH223191. An in vitro growth assay revealed that CH223191 inhibited growth of DU145, PC3 and PC3M cells in an androgen depleted environment. Immunohistochemical staining of prostate cancer tissues revealed increased nuclear localization of AhR in grade 2 and grade 3 cancers compared to the well differentiated grade 1 cancers.  Conclusions:   Together, these results show that AhR is constitutively active in advanced prostate cancer cell lines that model hormone refractory prostate cancer. Chemical ablation of AhR signaling can reduce the growth of advanced prostate cancer cells, an effect not achieved with androgen receptor inhibitors or growth in androgen depleted media.""","""['Oliver Richmond', 'Maryam Ghotbaddini', 'Cidney Allen', 'Alice Walker', 'Shokouh Zahir', 'Joann B Powell']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Inhibition of constitutive aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling attenuates androgen independent signaling and growth in (C4-2) prostate cancer cells.', '6-(3,4-Dihydro-1H-isoquinoline-2-yl)-N-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl) nicotinamide-26 (DIMN-26) decreases cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis and downregulation of androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Repression of activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor-induced transcriptional activation by 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone in human prostate cancer LNCaP and human breast cancer T47D cells.', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor: Its Regulation and Roles in Transformation and Tumorigenesis.', 'Species-Specific Differences in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Responses: How and Why?', 'Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and cancer: new perspectives on an old relationship.', 'Identification and validation of a lipid metabolism gene signature for predicting biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Indole-3-Carbinol, a Phytochemical Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor-Ligand, Induces the mRNA Overexpression of UBE2L3 and Cell Proliferation Arrest.', 'Autocrine Canonical Wnt Signaling Primes Noncanonical Signaling through ROR1 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'How the AHR Became Important in Cancer: The Role of Chronically Active AHR in Cancer Aggression.']"""

The fungal metabolite galiellalactone, a STAT3 signaling inhibitor, inhibits the growth, both in vitro and in vivo, of prostate cancer cells expressing active STAT3 and induces apoptosis of prostate cancer stem cell-like cells expressing phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3). However, the molecular mechanism of this STAT3-inhibiting effect by galiellalactone has not been clarified. A biotinylated analogue of galiellalactone (GL-biot) was synthesized to be used for identification of galiellalactone target proteins. By adding streptavidin-Sepharose beads to GL-biot-treated DU145 cell lysates, STAT3 was isolated and identified as a target protein. Confocal microscopy revealed GL-biot in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of DU145 cells treated with GL-biot, appearing to co-localize with STAT3 in the nucleus. Galiellalactone inhibited STAT3 binding to DNA in DU145 cell lysates without affecting phosphorylation status of STAT3. Mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant STAT3 protein pretreated with galiellalactone revealed three modified cysteines (Cys-367, Cys-468, and Cys-542). Here we demonstrate with chemical and molecular pharmacological methods that galiellalactone is a cysteine reactive inhibitor that covalently binds to one or more cysteines in STAT3 and that this leads to inhibition of STAT3 binding to DNA and thus blocks STAT3 signaling without affecting phosphorylation. This further validates galiellalactone as a promising direct STAT3 inhibitor for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Nicholas Don-Doncow', 'Zilma Escobar', 'Martin Johansson', 'Sven Kjellström', 'Victor Garcia', 'Eduardo Munoz', 'Olov Sterner', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Rebecka Hellsten']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['The STAT3 Inhibitor Galiellalactone Effectively Reduces Tumor Growth and Metastatic Spread in an Orthotopic Xenograft Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'Galiellalactone is a novel therapeutic candidate against hormone-refractory prostate cancer expressing activated Stat3.', 'The STAT3 inhibitor galiellalactone inhibits the generation of MDSC-like monocytes by prostate cancer cells and decreases immunosuppressive and tumorigenic factors.', 'STAT3 inhibition with galiellalactone effectively targets the prostate cancer stem-like cell population.', 'The STAT3 Inhibitor Galiellalactone Reduces IL6-Mediated AR Activity in Benign and Malignant Prostate Models.', 'Eupalinolide J Inhibits Cancer Metastasis by Promoting STAT3 Ubiquitin-Dependent Degradation.', 'Synthetic and Naturally Occurring Heterocyclic Anticancer Compounds with Multiple Biological Targets.', 'The Importance of 6-Aminohexanoic Acid as a Hydrophobic, Flexible Structural Element.', 'Trefoil Factor 3 Inhibits Thyroid Cancer Cell Progression Related to IL-6/JAK/STAT3 Signaling Pathway.', 'Inhibition of STAT3 augments antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 treatment against prostate cancer.']"""

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being performed for local staging of prostate cancer, and due to the close anatomical relationship to the prostate, penile enhancement is often depicted in prostate MRI.  Aim:   To evaluate the associations between quantitative perfusion-related parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI of the penis and self-reported sexual function in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 50 patients who underwent DCE-MRI for prostate cancer staging before prostatectomy. The following perfusion-related parameters were calculated: volume transfer constant (K(trans)), rate constant (k(ep)), extracellular-extravascular volume fraction (v(e)), contrast enhancement ratio (CER), area under the gadolinium curve after 180 seconds (AUC180), and slope of the time/signal intensity curve of the corpora cavernosa. Associations between perfusion-related parameters and self-reported sexual function were evaluated using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test.  Main outcome measures:   Patient responses to the sexual function domain of the Prostate Quality of Life survey.  Results:   Five of the six DCE-MRI parameters (K(trans), v(e), CER, AUC180, and slope) were significantly associated with the overall score from the sexual domain of the survey (P = 0.0020-0.0252). CER, AUC180, and slope were significantly associated with the answers to all six questions (P = 0.0020-0.0483), ve was significantly associated with the answers to five of six questions (P = 0.0036-0.1029), and K(trans) was significantly associated with the answers to three of six questions (P = 0.0252-0.1023). k(ep) was not significantly associated with the overall survey score (P = 0.7665) or the answers to any individual questions (P = 0.4885-0.8073).  Conclusion:   Penile DCE-MRI parameters were significantly associated with self-reported sexual function in patients with prostate cancer.

Some observed associations of SNPs with prostate cancer might arise from associations of these SNPs with circulating prostate-specific antigen (PSA) because PSA values are used to select controls.  Methods:   We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of screen-detected prostate cancer (ProtecT: 1,146 cases and 1,804 controls); meta-analyzed the results with those from the previously published UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study (1,854 cases and 1,437 controls); investigated associations of SNPs with prostate cancer using either ""low"" (PSA < 0.5 ng/mL) or ""high"" (PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL, biopsy negative) PSA controls; and investigated associations of SNPs with PSA.  Results:   The ProtecT GWAS confirmed previously reported associations of prostate cancer at three loci: 10q11.23, 17q24.3, and 19q13.33. The meta-analysis confirmed associations of prostate cancer with SNPs near four previously identified loci (8q24.21,10q11.23, 17q24.3, and 19q13.33). When comparing prostate cancer cases with low PSA controls, alleles at genetic markers rs1512268, rs445114, rs10788160, rs11199874, rs17632542, rs266849, and rs2735839 were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, but the effect-estimates were attenuated to the null when using high PSA controls (Pheterogeneity in effect-estimates < 0.04). We found a novel inverse association of rs9311171-T with circulating PSA.  Conclusions:   Differences in effect-estimates for prostate cancer observed when comparing low versus high PSA controls may be explained by associations of these SNPs with PSA.

High levels of RAD51 expression can lead to the formation of genotoxic RAD51 protein complexes on undamaged chromatin. We developed a therapeutic approach that exploits this potentially toxic feature of malignancy, using compounds that stimulate the DNA-binding activity of RAD51 to promote cancer cell death. A panel of immortalized cell lines was challenged with the RAD51-stimulatory compound RS-1. Resistance to RS-1 tended to occur in cells with higher levels of RAD54L and RAD54B, which are Swi2/Snf2-related translocases known to dissociate RAD51 filaments from dsDNA. In PC3 prostate cancer cells, RS-1-induced lethality was accompanied by the formation of microscopically visible RAD51 nuclear protein foci occurring in the absence of any DNA-damaging treatment.

A key challenge in creating CL-DNA complexes for application is that their transfection efficiency (TE) is adversely affected by serum. In particular, little is known about the effects of a high serum content on TE, even though this may provide design guidelines for application in vivo.  Methods:   We prepared CL-DNA complexes in which we varied the neutral lipid [1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine, glycerol-monooleate (GMO), cholesterol], the headgroup charge and chemical structure of the cationic lipid, and the ratio of neutral to cationic lipid; we then measured the TE of these complexes as a function of serum content and assessed their cytotoxicity. We tested selected formulations in two human cancer cell lines (M21/melanoma and PC-3/prostate cancer).  Results:   In the absence of serum, all CL-DNA complexes of custom-synthesized multivalent lipids show high TE. Certain combinations of multivalent lipids and neutral lipids, such as MVL5(5+)/GMO-DNA complexes or complexes based on the dendritic-headgroup lipid TMVLG3(8+) exhibited high TE both in the absence and presence of serum. Although their TE still dropped to a small extent in the presence of serum, it reached or surpassed that of benchmark commercial transfection reagents, particularly at a high serum content.  Conclusions:   Two-component vectors (one multivalent cationic lipid and one neutral lipid) can rival or surpass benchmark reagents at low and high serum contents (up to 50%, v/v).

Although heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 and Hsp70 are key players in this process, multiple Hsp70- and Hsp90-associated cochaperones associate with receptor-chaperone complexes to regulate receptor folding and activation. Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha (SGTA) was recently characterized as an Hsp70 and Hsp90-associated cochaperone that specifically regulates androgen receptor activity. However, the specificity of SGTA for additional members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily and the mechanism by which SGTA regulates receptor activity remain unclear. Here we report that SGTA associates with and specifically regulates the androgen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors and has no effect on the mineralocorticoid and estrogen receptors in both yeast and mammalian cell-based reporter assays. In both systems, SGTA knockdown/deletion enhances receptor activity, whereas SGTA overexpression suppresses receptor activity. We demonstrate that SGTA binds directly to Hsp70 and Hsp90 in vitro with similar affinities yet predominately precipitates with Hsp70 from cell lysates, suggesting a role for SGTA in early, Hsp70-mediated folding. Furthermore, SGTA expression completely abrogates the regulation of receptor function by FKBP52 (52-kDa FK506-binding protein), which acts at a later stage of the chaperone cycle.

We performed a series of co-transfections using mammalian expression vectors encoding specific glycosyltransferases. We thereby identified branching enzymes and FUT1 (required for Fucα1→2Gal linkage) as being essential for F77 antigen formation. When immortalized normal prostate 267B1 cells were transfected with FUT1 alone, cells showed weak expression of F77 antigen. By contrast, cells co-transfected with FUT1 plus either GCNT1, GCNT2, or GCNT3 (an enzyme required to form GlcNAcβ1→6Gal/GalNAc) showed robust F77 antigen expression, suggesting that F77 specifically binds to Fucα1→2Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Gal/GalNAc. RT-PCR for FUT1, GCNT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 showed that F77-positive cell lines indeed express transcripts encoding FUT1 plus one GCNT. F77-positive prostate cancer cells transfected with siRNAs targeting FUT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 showed significantly reduced F77 antigen, confirming the requirement of these enzymes for epitope synthesis. We also found that hypoxia induces F77 epitope expression in immortalized prostate RWPE1 cells, which express F77 antigen moderately under normoxia but at an elevated level under hypoxia. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated up-regulation of FUT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 transcripts in RWPE1 cells under hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia up-regulates glycosyltransferase expression required for F77 antigen synthesis.

The paucity of knowledge about the molecular mechanism involved in acquiring of metastatic behavior by primary tumor cells and non-availability of reliable phenotype-discriminating biomarkers are stumbling blocks in the management of CaP disease. Here, we determine the role and translational relevance of ROBO1 (an organogenesis-associated gene) in human CaP. Employing CaP-progression models and prostatic tissues of Caucasian and African-American patients, we show that ROBO1 expression is localized to cell-membrane and significantly lost in primary and metastatic tumors. While Caucasians exhibited similar ROBO1 levels in primary and metastatic phenotype, a significant difference was observed between tumor phenotypes in African-Americans. Epigenetic assays identified promoter methylation of ROBO1 specific to African-American metastatic CaP cells. Using African-American CaP models for further studies, we show that ROBO1 negatively regulates motility and invasiveness of primary CaP cells, and its loss causes these cells to acquire invasive trait. To understand the underlying mechanism, we employed ROBO1-expressing/ROBO1-C2C3-mutant constructs, immunoprecipitation, confocal-microscopy and luciferase-reporter techniques. We show that ROBO1 through its interaction with DOCK1 (at SH3-SH2-domain) controls the Rac-activation. However, loss of ROBO1 results in Rac1-activation which in turn causes E-Cadherin/β-catenin cytoskeleton destabilization and induction of cell migration. We suggest that ROBO1 is a predictive biomarker that has potential to discriminate among CaP types, and could be exploited as a molecular target to inhibit the progression of disease as well as treat metastasis in high-risk populations such as African-Americans.""","""['Aijaz Parray', 'Hifzur R Siddique', 'Jacquelyn K Kuriger', 'Shrawan K Mishra', 'Johng S Rhim', 'Heather H Nelson', 'Hiroyuki Aburatani', 'Badrinath R Konety', 'Shahriar Koochekpour', 'Mohammad Saleem']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Identifying and treating ROBO1-ve /DOCK1+ve prostate cancer: An aggressive cancer subtype prevalent in African American patients.', 'Slit-2 facilitates interaction of P-cadherin with Robo-3 and inhibits cell migration in an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line.', 'Angiomotin is a novel component of cadherin-11/β-catenin/p120 complex and is critical for cadherin-11-mediated cell migration.', 'Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines initiate multiple prostate cancer biologic pathways of cellular proliferation, heterogeneity and metastasis in a racially diverse population and underlie the genetic/biologic mechanism of racial disparity: Update.', 'Clinical Characteristics of Multiple Sclerosis in African-Americans.', 'Race and prostate cancer: genomic landscape.', 'Refining colorectal cancer classification and clinical stratification through a single-cell atlas.', 'miR-152-3p impedes the malignant phenotypes of hepatocellular carcinoma by repressing roundabout guidance receptor 1.', 'ROBO1 protein expression is independently associated with biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy in Asian patients.', 'High SEC61G expression predicts poor prognosis in patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 420 impotent/ED patients (International Index of Erectile Function-score <15) with organ-confined prostate cancer were treated with bilateral-NS [intrafascial-RP (239) or interfascial-RP (181)] in our institution. Intrafascial-RP was indicated for biopsy Gleason score ≤6 and PSA ≤10 ng/ml while interfascial-RP for Gleason score ≤7 and higher serum PSA. Seventy-seven patients with bilateral non-NS-RP were taken for comparison. No patient received pre-/postoperative radiation/hormonal therapy or had prostatic enlargement surgery. UI was assessed 3, 12 and 36 months postoperatively by third party. Continence was defined as no pads/day, safety 1 pad/day as separate group, 1-2 pads/day as ""mild-incontinence"" and >2 pads/day as ""incontinence"".  Results:   All groups had comparable perioperative criteria without significant preoperative morbidities. International Prostate Symptom Score showed severe symptoms in 5 % of patients without correlation to UI. UI-recovery increased until 36 months. Full continence was reported from 56 versus 62 and 53 % patients after intrafascial-RP versus interfascial-RP and wide excision at 3 months, respectively (p = 0.521). Corresponding figures at 12 months were 70 versus 61 versus 51 % (p = 0.114) and at 36 months 85 versus 75 versus 65 % (p = 0.135), respectively. After 12 and 36 months, there was tendency to better UI-results in advantage of NS-technique; best results were achieved in intrafascial-RP group. UI-recovery was age-dependant. Advantage was found in NS-group compared with non-NS-group in older patients (>70 years, p = 0.052).  Conclusions:   Impotent/ED patients have higher chances of recovering full continence after NS-RP.

In this study, we carried out a quantitative analysis of phenolic acids in the ethyl acetate extract of 12 honeys collected from various regions in Greece. Our findings indicate that protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid are the major phenolic acids of the honeys examined. Conifer tree honey (from pine and fir) contained significantly higher concentrations of protocatechuic and caffeic acid (mean: 6640 and 397 µg/kg honey respectively) than thyme and citrus honey (mean of protocatechuic and caffeic acid: 437.6 and 116 µg/kg honey respectively). p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was the dominant compound in thyme honeys (mean: 1252.5 µg/kg honey). We further examined the antioxidant potential (ORAC assay) of the extracts, their ability to influence viability of prostate cancer (PC-3) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cells as well as their lowering effect on TNF- α-induced adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells (HAEC). ORAC values of Greek honeys ranged from 415 to 2129 µmol Trolox equivalent/kg honey and correlated significantly with their content in protocatechuic acid (p<0.001), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p<0.01), vanillic acid (p<0.05), caffeic acid (p<0.01), p-coumaric acid (p<0.001) and their total phenolic content (p<0.001). Honey extracts reduced significantly the viability of PC-3 and MCF-7 cells as well as the expression of adhesion molecules in HAEC. Importantly, vanillic acid content correlated significantly with anticancer activity in PC-3 and MCF-7 cells (p<0.01, p<0.05 respectively). Protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid and total phenolic content correlated significantly with the inhibition of VCAM-1 expression (p<0.05, p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively). In conclusion, Greek honeys are rich in phenolic acids, in particular protocatechuic and p-hydroxybenzoic acid and exhibit significant antioxidant, anticancer and antiatherogenic activities which may be attributed, at least in part, to their phenolic acid content.""","""['Eliana Spilioti', 'Mari Jaakkola', 'Tiina Tolonen', 'Maija Lipponen', 'Vesa Virtanen', 'Ioanna Chinou', 'Eva Kassi', 'Sofia Karabournioti', 'Paraskevi Moutsatsou']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Relationships between the Content of Phenolic Compounds and the Antioxidant Activity of Polish Honey Varieties as a Tool for Botanical Discrimination.', 'Evaluation of Egyptian honeys and their floral origins: phenolic compounds, antioxidant activities, and antimicrobial characteristics.', 'Anatolian honey is not only sweet but can also protect from breast cancer: Elixir for women from artemis to present.', 'Monofloral Honeys as a Potential Source of Natural Antioxidants, Minerals and Medicine.', 'Recent Advances in the Analysis of Phenolic Compounds in Unifloral Honeys.', 'Design, Preparation, and Physicochemical Characterisation of Alginate-Based Honey-Loaded Topical Formulations.', 'The Potential Use of Honey as a Neuroprotective Agent for the Management of Neurodegenerative Diseases.', 'Evaluation of the effects of a honey‑based gel on blood redox biomarkers and the physiological profile of healthy adults: A pilot study.', 'Honey: A Promising Therapeutic Supplement for the Prevention and Management of Osteoporosis and Breast Cancer.', 'Citrus Honey Ameliorates Liver Disease and Restores Gut Microbiota in Alcohol-Feeding Mice.']"""

Methods:   Information on 43 patients undergoing decompressive surgery and rehabilitation for MSCC was reviewed, including primary tumor, age, pre- and postoperative ambulation status, mobility subcategory of the Spinal Cord Injury Measure (mSCIM) and the Tokuhashi score. Differences between groups were analyzed by the nonparametric χ(2) test, and correlation coefficients (Spearman's rho) were computed.  Results:   Preoperative ambulation (p < 0.001), the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (p < 0.001) and the type of operation (p = 0.02) influenced the postoperative functional outcome. Any positive change in the mSCIM was influenced by preoperative ambulation (p < 0.001).

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors as sunitinib malate are used in cancer therapy, emerging studies report compromised cytotoxicity when used as monotherapy and thus combinations with other anti-cancer agents is recommended. Chloroquine is a clinically available anti-malarial agent which has been shown to exhibit anti-cancer activity. In the current study, we questioned whether chloroquine can modulate sunitinib cytotoxicity. We found that chloroquine synergistically augmented sunitinib cytotoxicity on human breast (MCF-7 and T-47D), cervical (Hela), colorectal (Caco-2 and HCT116), hepatocellular (HepG2), laryngeal (HEp-2) and prostate (PC3) cancer cell lines as indicated by combination and concentration reduction indices. These results were also consistent with that of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) Swiss albino mice models as confirmed by tumor volume, weight, histopathological examination and PCNA expression. Sunitinib induced autophagy via upregulating beclin-1 expression which was blocked by chloroquine as evidenced by accumulated SQTSM1/p62 level. Furthermore, chloroquine augmented sunitinib-induced apoptosis by decreasing survivin level and increasing caspase 3 activity. Chloroquine also enhanced the antiangiogenic capacity of sunitinib as indicated by decreased CD34 expression and peritoneal/skin angiogenesis. Sunitinib when combined with chloroquine also increased reactive nitrogen species production via increasing inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide level whilst reduced reactive oxygen species production by increasing GSH level, activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase and reducing lipid peroxides compared to sunitinib-only treated group. Taken together, these findings suggest that chloroquine enhanced sunitinib cytotoxicity in a synergistic manner via inducing apoptosis while switching off autophagic and angiogenic machineries.

Methods and materials:   MVCT-NMAR was applied to images from 5 patients: 3 with dual hip prostheses, 1 with a single hip prosthesis, and 1 with dental fillings. The corrected images were evaluated for visualization of tissue structures and their interfaces and for radiation therapy dose calculations. They were compared against the corresponding images corrected by the commercial orthopedic metal artifact reduction algorithm in a Phillips CT scanner.  Results:   The use of MVCT images for correcting kVCT images in the MVCT-NMAR technique greatly reduces metal artifacts, avoids secondary artifacts, and makes patient images more useful for correct dose calculation in radiation therapy. These improvements are significant, provided the MVCT and kVCT images are correctly registered. The remaining and the secondary artifacts (soft tissue blurring, eroded bones, false bones or air pockets, CT number cupping within the metal) present in orthopedic metal artifact reduction corrected images are removed in the MVCT-NMAR corrected images. A large dose reduction was possible outside the planning target volume (eg, 59.2 Gy to 52.5 Gy in pubic bone) when these MVCT-NMAR corrected images were used in TomoTherapy treatment plans without directional blocks for a prostate cancer patient.

Patients and methods:   In this retrospective, multi-institutional study, we analysed the clinical records of 131 consecutive patients who underwent either retropubic or robot-assisted RP for miPCa at two referral centres from January 2000 to December 2011. miPCa was defined as a neoplastic lesion present in ≤10% of core with biopsy Gleason score not applicable or biopsy Gleason score 6.  Results:   There were 17 (13%) pT3-4 prostate cancers and a single case (0.8%) of pN+ tumour. Moreover, 31 (24.1%) patients had a Gleason score of >6 in the RP specimen. Therefore, unfavourable pathological features (pT3-4/N+ and/or Gleason score >6) were present in 40 (30.5%) patients.

In addition, we estimated the budget impact when a robotic system is preferred over an arc-based or fixed-gantry system. Costs of SBRT were $6333/patient (robotic), $4368/patient (arc-based) and $4443/patient (fixed-gantry). When daily hours of operation were varied, the cost of robotic SBRT varied from $9324/patient (2 hours daily) to $5250/patient (10 hours daily). This was comparable to the costs of 39 fraction standard regimen which were $5935/patient (arc-based) and $7992/ patient (fixed-gantry). In settings of moderate to high patient volume, robotic SBRT is cost effective compared to the standard regimen. If SBRT can be delivered with equivalent efficacy and safety, the arc-based system would be the most cost effective system.""","""['Waseem Sharieff', 'Jeffrey N Greenspoon', 'Ian Dayes', 'Tom Chow', 'James Wright', 'Himu Lukka']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Cost-effectiveness analysis of SBRT versus IMRT for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'The technique and cost of radiosurgery for the treatment of 1-3 brain metastases.', 'Hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer - first Nordic clinical experience.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'A comparison of robotic arm versus gantry linear accelerator stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Robot-Assisted Surgery vs Robotic Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer: A Cost-Utility Analysis.', 'Practical considerations for prostate hypofractionation in the developing world.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Prostate Cancer in Men With a High Baseline International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS ≥ 15).', 'Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: When and for Whom?', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Primary Prostate Cancer.']"""

This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of intimate spouses or partners of men diagnosed and/or treated for prostate cancer to better understand the personal impact of prostate cancer on the partner.  Methods:   Twenty-seven partners participated in this study. Six focus groups were convened, and one in-depth interview was undertaken to explore the practical impact of prostate cancer on the intimate spouse/partner. All discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed and then coded using a thematic approach.  Results:   Six themes emerged: (a) The influence of the man's response to prostate cancer on the partner, (b) The need to be involved in treatment and medical decision making, (c) Supporting a man who is experiencing a loss of masculinity, (d) Degree of congruence between each partner's coping responses, (e) Constrained communication, and (f) Changed roles and increased practical management.  Conclusions:   It is clear that prostate cancer impacts substantially on many areas of partner well-being. An effective intervention provided to this population seems warranted and may lead to improvements in partner well-being, assist the couple in lessening the impact of prostate cancer and its treatment on their relationship, and assist in the man's recovery.""","""['A C Wootten', 'J M Abbott', 'D Osborne', 'D W Austin', 'B Klein', 'A J Costello', 'D G Murphy']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Impaired sexual function and prostate cancer: a mixed method investigation into the experiences of men and their partners.', 'Prostate cancer treatment decisions: a focus group exploration.', ""'What is this active surveillance thing?'

We developed a new actively shielded electromagnetic transducer, designed to enable quick deployment and positioning within the scanner. The shielding of the transducer was optimized using simulations. We also employed a new rapid pulse sequence that encodes the three-dimensional displacement field in the prostate gland using a fractionally encoded steady-state gradient echo sequence, thereby shortening the acquisition time to a clinically acceptable 8-10 min. The methods were tested in two phantoms and seven human subjects (six volunteers and one patient with prostate cancer). The MRE acquisition time for 24 slices, with an isotropic resolution of 2 mm and eight phase offsets, was 8 min, and the total scan, including positioning and set-up, was performed in 15-20 min. The phantom study demonstrated that the transducer does not interfere with the acquisition process and that it generates displacement amplitudes that exceed 100 µm even at frequencies as high as 300 Hz. In the in vivo human study, average wave amplitudes of 30 µm (46 µm at the apex) were routinely achieved within the prostate gland at 70 Hz. No pain or discomfort was reported. Results in a single patient suggest that MRE can identify cancer tumors, although this result is preliminary.

However, protein kinases are now currently identified as potent targets for treating cancer, and MARK4L, a Ser/Thr kinase in the Par-1 family, is one such kinase that is expressed primarily in the testis and is involved in the regulation of spermatid polarity during spermatogenesis. It is also associated with Wnt-induced prostate carcinogenesis, making it a promising target for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics as part of alternative therapies to counter prostate cancer. In the present work, we predicted the three dimensional structure for the kinase domain of MARK4 and analyzed its structural properties. The results illuminate the presence of the unusual DFG Asp-in/αC helix-out conformation along with the absence of an additional hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the ATP binding site in its inactive state. These structural features accentuate the need for new specific therapeutics against MARK4. Hence, a robust ligand-based pharmacophore model AARRR.9 was developed based on the three dimensional chemical features of 9-oxo-9H-acridin-10-yl derivatives which possess a high specificity towards MARK kinases. A pharmacophore based search identified six potent compounds with a better specificity and binding efficiency to MARK4 bearing stable interactions with key residues K88, A138, D199 and E106, thereby making them tough ATP competitors. The closure of the catalytic cleft observed in the ligand bound complexes and its independency to the movement of the T-loop makes them promising candidates in hampering the role of MARK4 in prostate cancer.""","""['Pranitha Jenardhanan', 'Jayakanthan Mannu', 'Premendu P Mathur']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Biosyst""","""['Designing New Kinase Inhibitor Derivatives as Therapeutics Against Common Complex Diseases: Structural Basis of Microtubule Affinity-Regulating Kinase 4 (MARK4) Inhibition.', 'Structure-based investigation of MARK4 inhibitory potential of Naringenin for therapeutic management of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.', 'PKR-inhibitor binds efficiently with human microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4.', 'Microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4: structure, function, and regulation.', 'Microtubule-affinity regulating kinase 4: A potential drug target for cancer therapy.', 'A Network-Guided Approach to Discover Phytochemical-Based Anticancer Therapy: Targeting MARK4 for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'MARK2 regulates chemotherapeutic responses through class IIa HDAC-YAP axis in pancreatic cancer.', 'Discovery of 4-(2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy)benzohydrazide derivatives as prospective microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 inhibitors.', ""MAP/Microtubule Affinity Regulating Kinase 4 Inhibitory Potential of Irisin: A New Therapeutic Strategy to Combat Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Use of Molecular\xa0Modeling to Study\xa0Spermatogenesis: An Overview Using Proteins in Sertoli Cells.']"""

This prospective trial investigates positron emission tomography (PET) with [(18)F]fluoroethylcholine (FEC) combined with endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of primary prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   Patients with prostate cancer based on needle biopsy findings, scheduled for radical prostatectomy, were assessed by FEC-PET and MRI in identical positioning. After prostatectomy, imaging results were compared with histologic whole-mount sections, and the PET/MRI lesion-based semiquantitative FEC uptake was compared with biopsy Gleason scores and postoperative histology.  Results:   PET/MRI showed a patient-based sensitivity of 95% (36/38; 95% confidence interval (CI), 82%-99%). The analysis of 128 prostate lesions demonstrated a sensitivity/specificity/positive predictive value/negative predictive value/accuracy of 67%/35%/59%/44%/54% (P = 0.8295) for MRI and 85%/45%/68%/69%/68% (P = 0.0021) for PET, which increased to 84%/80%/85%/78%/82% (P < 0.0001) by combined FEC-PET/MRI in lesions >5 mm (n = 98). For lesions in patients with Gleason >6 tumors (n = 43), MRI and PET achieved 73%/31%/71%/33%/60% (P = 1.0000) and 90%/62%/84%/73%/81% (P = 0.0010), which were improved to 87%/92%/96%/75%/88% (P < 0.0001) by combined PET/MRI. Applying semiquantitative PET analysis, carcinomas with Gleason scores >6 were distinguished from those with Gleason ≤ 6 with a specificity of 90% and a positive predictive value of 83% (P = 0.0011; needle biopsy 71%/60%, P = 0.1071).  Conclusions:   In a prospective diagnostic trial setting, combined FEC-PET/MRI achieved very high sensitivity in the detection of the dominant malignant lesion of the prostate, and markedly improved upon PET or MRI alone.

Methods:   ALDH3A1 expression was analysed in various PC cell lines. Xenograft tumours and 54 primary and metastatic PC tumours were stained using immunohistochemistry for ALDH3A1 expression.  Results:   In comparison with the non-stem counterparts, a robust upregulation of ALDH3A1 was observed in DU145-derived PC stem cells (PCSCs). As DU145 PCSCs produced xenograft tumours with more advanced features compared with those derived from DU145 cells, higher levels of ALDH3A1 were detected in the former; a dramatic elevation of ALDH3A1 occurred in DU145 cell-derived lung metastasis compared with local xenograft tumours. Furthermore, while ALDH3A1 was not observed in prostate glands, ALDH3A1 was clearly present in PIN, and further increased in carcinomas.

The observation that 16 of 19 foci with homogeneous ERG positivity had focal PTEN alterations but none of 10 foci with PTEN alterations had focal ERG positivity (P<0.0001) suggests that PTEN alterations typically develop subsequent to ERG fusions. We demonstrate a high level of intratumoral heterogeneity of PTEN alterations with deletions and rearrangements that challenges potential PTEN routine diagnosis testing in biopsies.

The present research, attempts to support the hypothesis that PSMA expression in prostate cancer stem cell-like (CSC) cell populations may be correlated with nanog and other transcription factors in different stages of prostate carcinomas.  Materials and methods:   To provide more accurate evidence of the above, a population of prostate CSCs was isolated and analyzed using different protocols. The first method was based in the ability of CSCs to form spherical colonies in semi-suspension of a culture. A qPCRbased protocol and a flow cytometric analysis protocol were chosen to test the presence of stemness markers and PSMA in the selected populations.  Results:   The formation of micro-sphere in semi-suspension has been pointed out. In the other panels of the test, the linear correlation between PSMA and nanog in gene and protein level was shown. However, the statistical analysis including the coefficient of variationand standard deviation's values) has proved that there were differences in PSMA expression between cancer cells and CSCs.

Materials and methods:   A total of 683 daily megavoltage CT (MVCT) or kilovoltage CT (kvCBCT) images of 30 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy were evaluated. Daily image-guidance was performed and setup errors in three translational axes recorded. The NAL protocol was simulated by using the mean shift calculated from the first five fractions and implemented on all subsequent treatments. Using the imaging data from the remaining fractions, the daily residual error (RE) was determined. The proportion of fractions where the RE was greater than 3,5 and 7 mm was calculated, and also the actual PTV margin that would be required if the offline protocol was followed.  Results:   Using the NAL protocol reduced the systematic but not the random errors.

The PTV margins calculated based on residual errors were 5mm, 5mm and 13 mm in the ML, SI and AP directions respectively.  Conclusion:   Offline correction using the NAL protocol resulted in unacceptably high residual errors in the AP direction, due to random uncertainties of rectal and bladder filling.

We identified the chromatin remodeling protein, ING4, as a crucial switch downstream of Myc and Pten that is required for human prostate epithelial differentiation. Myc-induced transient expression of ING4 is required for the differentiation of basal epithelial cells into luminal cells, while sustained ING4 expression induces apoptosis. ING4 expression is lost in >60% of human primary prostate tumors. ING4 or Pten loss prevents epithelial cell differentiation, which was necessary for tumorigenesis. Pten loss prevents differentiation by blocking ING4 expression, which is rescued by ING4 re-expression. Pten or ING4 loss generates tumor cells that co-express basal and luminal markers, indicating prostate oncogenesis occurs through disruption of an intermediate step in the prostate epithelial differentiation program. Thus, we identified a new epithelial cell differentiation switch involving Myc, Pten, and ING4, which when disrupted leads to prostate tumorigenesis. Myc overexpression and Pten loss are common genetic abnormalities in prostate cancer, whereas loss of the tumor suppressor ING4 has not been reported. This is the first demonstration that transient ING4 expression is absolutely required for epithelial differentiation, its expression is dependent on Myc and Pten, and it is lost in the majority of human prostate cancers. This is the first demonstration that loss of ING4, either directly or indirectly through loss of Pten, promotes Myc-driven oncogenesis by deregulating differentiation. The clinical implication is that Pten/ING4 negative and ING4-only negative tumors may reflect two distinct subtypes of prostate cancer.""","""['Penny L Berger', 'Sander B Frank', 'Veronique V Schulz', 'Eric A Nollet', 'Mathew J Edick', 'Brittany Holly', 'Ting-Tung A Chang', 'Galen Hostetter', 'Suwon Kim', 'Cindy K Miranti']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Miz1, a Novel Target of ING4, Can Drive Prostate Luminal Epithelial Cell Differentiation.', 'Loss of Nkx3.1 leads to the activation of discrete downstream target genes during prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Combined MYC Activation and Pten Loss Are Sufficient to Create Genomic Instability and Lethal Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'The emerging role of inhibitor of growth 4 as a tumor suppressor in multiple human cancers.', 'Inhibitor of growth-4 is a potential target for cancer therapy.', 'ING4 Promotes Stemness Enrichment of Human Renal Cell Carcinoma Cells Through Inhibiting DUSP4 Expression to Activate the p38 MAPK/type I IFN-Stimulated Gene Signaling Pathway.', 'ING Tumour Suppressors and ING Splice Variants as Coregulators of the Androgen Receptor Signalling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Aberrant CREB1 activation in prostate cancer disrupts normal prostate luminal cell differentiation.', 'Effect of 7,12-Dimethylbenz(α)anthracene on the Expression of miR-330, miR-29a, miR-9-1, miR-9-3 and the mTORC1 Gene in CBA/Ca Mice.', 'Androgen receptor-induced integrin α6β1 and Bnip3 promote survival and resistance to PI3K inhibitors in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

TAK-448 is an investigational oligopeptide analog of the fully active 10-amino acid C terminus of kisspeptin-54. This phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of TAK-448 in healthy subjects and patients with prostate cancer (PC).  Design:   Healthy subjects aged 50 years or older received TAK-448 sc as a single-bolus or 2-hour infusion (0.01-6 mg/d; part A) and as a 14-day sc administration (0.01-1 mg/d; part B). In a subsequent, open-label, phase 1 study in PC patients aged 40-78 years, TAK-448 was given as a 1-month depot formulation.  Results:   Eighty-two healthy subjects received TAK-448; 30 received placebo. Grades 1-2 adverse events were reported in 26% of subjects during TAK-448 treatment. All dosing regimens resulted in dose-proportional exposures. The maximum observed plasma concentration occurred after 0.25-0.5 hours, and median terminal elimination half-life was 1.4-5.3 hours. T increased approximately 1.3- to 2-fold by 48 hours after a single bolus or 2 hour injections, whereas during the 14-day infusion, at doses above 0.1 mg/d, T dropped to below-baseline values by 60 hours and reached a subsequently sustained below-castration level by day 8. In PC patients, T decreased to less than 20 ng/dL in four of five patients dosed with 12 or 24 mg TAK-448 sc-depot injections. The prostate-specific antigen decreased greater than 50% in all patients dosed with 24 mg.

As such, LAT family members are commonly upregulated in cancer in order to fuel increased protein translation and cell growth. To identify potential LAT-specific inhibitors, we established a function-based high-throughput screen using a prefractionated natural product library. We identified and purified two novel monoterpene glycosides, ESK242 and ESK246, sourced from a Queensland collection of the plant Pittosporum venulosum. Using Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing individual LAT family members, we demonstrated that ESK246 preferentially inhibits leucine transport via LAT3, while ESK242 inhibits both LAT1 and LAT3. We further show in LNCaP prostate cancer cells that ESK246 is a potent (IC50 = 8.12 μM) inhibitor of leucine uptake, leading to reduced mTORC1 signaling, cell cycle protein expression and cell proliferation.

The detection limit was enhanced by ∼12-fold compared with that of an ICTS that used QDs encapsulated by commercial 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (QDs@MUA) as the signal-generating reagent. At the same time, the possible clinical utility of this approach was demonstrated by measurements recorded from PSA-positive patient specimens. Our data suggest that the QD nanobeads-based ICTS platform is not only rapid and low-cost but also highly sensitive and specific for use in quantitative point-of-care diagnostics; thus, it holds promise for becoming a part of routine medical testing for the early cancer of detection.""","""['Xue Li', 'Wenbin Li', 'Qiuhua Yang', 'Xiaoqun Gong', 'Weisheng Guo', 'Chunhong Dong', 'Junqing Liu', 'Lixue Xuan', 'Jin Chang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Quantum dot-based immunochromatography test strip for rapid, quantitative and sensitive detection of alpha fetoprotein.', 'Fluorescent Ru(phen)3(2+)-doped silica nanoparticles-based ICTS sensor for quantitative detection of enrofloxacin residues in chicken meat.', 'Development of a quantum dot-based immunochromatography test strip for rapid screening of oxytetracycline and 4-epi-oxytetracycline in edible animal tissues.', 'Beyond PSA: utility of novel tumor markers in the setting of elevated PSA.', 'Update on screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen.', 'Portable Plasmonic Paper-Based Biosensor for Simple and Rapid Indirect Detection of CEACAM5 Biomarker via Metal-Enhanced Fluorescence.', 'Highly portable quantitative screening test for prostate-specific antigen at point of care.', 'Photoluminescent Molecules and Materials as Diagnostic Reporters in Lateral Flow Assays.', 'Lateral Flow Immunoassay with Quantum-Dot-Embedded Silica Nanoparticles for Prostate-Specific Antigen Detection.', 'Machine Learning Approach to Enhance the Performance of MNP-Labeled Lateral Flow Immunoassay.']"""

While the implanted seeds can be easily identified on a computed tomography image, distinguishing the prostate and surrounding soft tissues is not as straightforward. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superior anatomical delineation, but the seeds appear as dark voids and are difficult to identify, thus creating a conundrum. Cobalt dichloride-N-acetyl-cysteine (C4) has previously been shown to be promising as an encapsulated contrast agent marker. We performed spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and spin-spin relaxation time (T2) measurements of C4 solutions with varying cobalt dichloride concentrations to determine the corresponding relaxivities, r1 and r2. These relaxation parameters were investigated at different field strengths, temperatures and orientations. T1 measurements obtained at 1.5 and 3.0 T, as well as at room and body temperature, showed that r1 is field-independent and temperature-independent. Conversely, the T2 values at 3.0 T were shorter than at 1.5 T, while the T2 values at body temperature were slightly higher than at room temperature. By examining the relaxivities with the C4 vials aligned in three different planes, we found no orientation-dependence. With these relaxation characteristics, we aim to develop pulse sequences that will enhance the C4 signal against prostatic stroma. Ultimately, the use of C4 as a positive contrast agent marker will encourage the use of MRI to obtain an accurate representation of the radiation dose delivered to the prostate and surrounding normal anatomical structures.""","""['Tze Yee Lim', 'R Jason Stafford', 'Rajat J Kudchadker', 'Madhuri Sankaranarayanapillai', 'Geoffrey Ibbott', 'Arvind Rao', 'Karen S Martirosyan', 'Steven J Frank']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A biodistribution and toxicity study of cobalt dichloride-N-acetyl cysteine in an implantable MRI marker for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Anisotropy characterization of I-125 seed with attached encapsulated cobalt chloride complex contrast agent markers for MRI-based prostate brachytherapy.', 'A novel MRI marker for prostate brachytherapy.', 'A comprehensive review of prostate cancer brachytherapy: defining an optimal technique.', 'The impact of technological advances on the evolution of 3D conformal brachytherapy for early prostate cancer.', 'Fully Balanced SSFP Without an Endorectal Coil for Postimplant QA of MRI-Assisted Radiosurgery (MARS) of Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Study.', 'Permanent prostate brachytherapy postimplant magnetic resonance imaging dosimetry using positive contrast magnetic resonance imaging markers.', 'Pulse sequence considerations for simulation and postimplant dosimetry of prostate brachytherapy.', 'Development of a magnetic resonance imaging protocol to visualize encapsulated contrast agent markers in prostate brachytherapy recipients: initial patient experience.', 'Trends in targeted prostate brachytherapy: from multiparametric MRI to nanomolecular radiosensitizers.']"""

This leads to an unwanted dose contribution, which can be considerable for tissues outside of the target volume regarding the long term health of cancer patients. Due to the high biological effectiveness of neutrons in regards to cancer induction, small neutron doses can be important. This study quantified the neutron doses for different radiation therapy modalities. Most of the reports in the literature used neutron dose measurements free in air or on the surface of phantoms to estimate the amount of neutron dose to the patient. In this study, dose measurements were performed in terms of neutron dose equivalent inside an anthropomorphic phantom. The neutron dose equivalent was determined using track etch detectors as a function of the distance to the isocenter, as well as for radiation sensitive organs. The dose distributions were compared with respect to treatment techniques (3D-conformal, volumetric modulated arc therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for photons; spot scanning and passive scattering for protons), therapy machines (Varian, Elekta and Siemens linear accelerators) and radiation quality (photons and protons). The neutron dose equivalent varied between 0.002 and 3 mSv per treatment gray over all measurements. Only small differences were found when comparing treatment techniques, but substantial differences were observed between the linear accelerator models. The neutron dose equivalent for proton therapy was higher than for photons in general and in particular for double-scattered protons. The overall neutron dose equivalent measured in this study was an order of magnitude lower than the stray dose of a treatment using 6 MV photons, suggesting that the contribution of the secondary neutron dose equivalent to the integral dose of a radiotherapy patient is small.""","""['R A Hälg', 'J Besserer', 'M Boschung', 'S Mayer', 'A J Lomax', 'U Schneider']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Whole-body dose equivalent including neutrons is similar for 6 MV and 15 MV IMRT, VMAT, and 3D conformal radiotherapy.', 'In vivo and phantom measurements of the secondary photon and neutron doses for prostate patients undergoing 18 MV IMRT.', 'Out-of-field photon and neutron dose equivalents from step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetry of clinical neutron and proton beams: an overview of recommendations.', 'The Impact of Neutrons in Clinical Proton Therapy.', 'The application of graphene/h-BN metamaterial in medical linear accelerators for reducing neutron leakage in the treatment room.', 'Validation of a Monte Carlo Framework for Out-of-Field Dose Calculations in Proton Therapy.', 'Peripheral Organ Equivalent Dose Estimation Procedure in Proton Therapy.', 'Spot-scanning proton therapy for targets with adjacent cardiac implantable electronic devices - Strategies for breast and head & neck cancer.', 'Modelling and measurements of distributions in an adult human phantom undergoing proton scanning beam radiotherapy: lung- and prostate-located tumours.']"""

The purpose of this report is to present an overview of both published studies and new data in the evaluation of immune responses to the PSA-TRICOM vaccine platform, currently in phase III testing. Of 104 patients tested for T-cell responses, 57% (59/104) demonstrated a ≥ 2-fold increase in PSA-specific T cells 4 weeks after vaccine (median 5-fold increase) compared with pre-vaccine, and 68% (19/28) of patients tested mounted post-vaccine immune responses to tumor-associated antigens not present in the vaccine (antigen spreading). The PSA-specific immune responses observed 28 days after vaccine (i.e., likely memory cells) are quantitatively similar to the levels of circulating T cells specific for influenza seen in the same patients. Measurements of systemic immune response to PSA may underestimate the true therapeutic immune response (as this does not account for cells that have trafficked to the tumor) and does not include antigen spreading. Furthermore, although the entire PSA gene is the vaccine, only one epitope of PSA is evaluated in the T-cell responses. Because this therapeutic vaccine is directed at generating a cellular/Th1 immune response (T-cell costimulatory molecules and use of a viral vector), it is not surprising that less than 0.6% of patients (2/349) tested have evidence of PSA antibody induction following vaccine. This suggests that post-vaccine PSA kinetics were not affected by PSA antibodies. An ongoing phase III study will evaluate the systemic immune responses and correlation with clinical outcomes.""","""['James L Gulley', 'Ravi A Madan', 'Kwong Y Tsang', 'Caroline Jochems', 'Jennifer L Marté', 'Benedetto Farsaci', 'Jo A Tucker', 'James W Hodge', 'David J Liewehr', 'Seth M Steinberg', 'Christopher R Heery', 'Jeffrey Schlom']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Res""","""['A national multicenter phase 2 study of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) pox virus vaccine with sequential androgen ablation therapy in patients with PSA progression: ECOG 9802.', 'Identification by digital immunohistochemistry of intratumoral changes of immune infiltrates after vaccine in the absence of modifications of PBMC immune cell subsets.', 'Phase I study of a multitargeted recombinant Ad5 PSA/MUC-1/brachyury-based immunotherapy vaccine in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).', 'Prostate cancer vaccines in clinical trials.', 'Prostvac-VF: a vector-based vaccine targeting PSA in prostate cancer.', 'Flutamide With or Without PROSTVAC in Non-metastatic Castration Resistant (M0) Prostate Cancer.', 'Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as an endpoint in cancer vaccine trials.', 'Vaccines as treatments for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer immunotherapy: a review of recent advancements with novel treatment methods and efficacy.', 'Aptamers as Theragnostic Tools in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The AR-regulated network is activated when AR binds enhancer elements and modulates specific enhancer-promoter looping. Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), which codes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a well-known AR-regulated gene and its upstream enhancers produce bidirectional enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), termed KLK3e. Here, we demonstrate that KLK3e facilitates the spatial interaction of the KLK3 enhancer and the KLK2 promoter and enhances long-distance KLK2 transcriptional activation. KLK3e carries the core enhancer element derived from the androgen response element III (ARE III), which is required for the interaction of AR and Mediator 1 (Med1). Furthermore, we show that KLK3e processes RNA-dependent enhancer activity depending on the integrity of core enhancer elements. The transcription of KLK3e was detectable and its expression is significantly correlated with KLK3 (R(2) = 0.6213, P < 5 × 10(-11)) and KLK2 (R(2) = 0.5893, P < 5 × 10(-10)) in human prostate tissues.

Subsequently, repeated biopsies are necessary to monitor such patients. Thus, in addition to the already established clinicopathological criteria, there is a considerable demand for new, objective decision criteria to more accurately select AS candidates. Recently, a novel RNA expression signature derived from 31 cell-cycle progression (CCP) genes has been shown to be a strong predictor of outcome in patients after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. This is a qualitative pilot study to evaluate the prognostic value of the CCP-score (CCP-S) for the first time in men managed with AS after MRI-guided prostate biopsy (MRI-GB).  Patients and methods:   Nine patients previously diagnosed with prostate cancer during an ongoing, prospective trial assessing MRI-GB with additional TRUS-GB and were subsequently managed with AS. CCP-S were retrospectively derived from biopsy specimens. The CCP-S is defined as the expression level of 31 CCP genes, normalized to 15 housekeeping genes, and is clinically validated in a range between -1.3 and 4.7. To assess the estimated 10-year mortality risk (without curative treatment), the CCP-S from each patient was combined with the individual CAPRA (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment) score (CAPRA-S).  Results:   Median patient age was 72 (range=58-77) years. Mean pre-biopsy PSA level was 6.33±1.94 (range 4.23-9.97) ng/ml. Eight cases had Gleason score 6 (3+3) and one cancer had Gleason score 7 (3+4). Median CCP-S was -0.9 (range=-1.5 to 0.0). Combining CCP-S with CAPRA-S [CAPRA-S: 1 (n=4), 2 (n=4), 3 (n=1)] the estimated 10-year mortality risk was not calculable for three patients because their CCP-S [CCP-S -1.4 (n=2) and -1.5 (n=1)] was outside the validated range. For the other 6 patients the estimated 10-year mortality ranged from 1.0-3.0%.  Conclusion:   The CCP-S confirms accurate staging of AS patients detected by MRI-based biopsy strategies and may significantly reduce inaccurate staging of AS patients and subsequent unnecessary re-biopsies.

Dosimetric verification of the converted mARC plans with step-and-shoot plans shows deviations below 1 % in absolute point dose; in the 3D dose distribution, over 95 % of the points pass the 3D gamma criteria (3 % deviation in local dose and 3 mm distance to agreement for doses > 20 % of the maximum). Patient specific verification of the mARC dose distribution with the calculations has a similar pass rate. Treatment times range between 2 and 5 min for a single arc.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first report of clinical application of the mARC technique. The mARC offers the possibility to save significant amounts of time, with single-arc treatments of only a few minutes achieving comparable dose distribution to IMRT plans taking up to twice as long.""","""['Yvonne Dzierma', 'Frank G Nuesken', 'Stephanie Kremp', 'Jan Palm', 'Norbert P Licht', 'Christian Rübe']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['mARC vs. IMRT radiotherapy of the prostate with flat and flattening-filter-free beam energies.', 'A novel implementation of mARC treatment for non-dedicated planning systems using converted IMRT plans.', 'Two years experience with quality assurance protocol for patient related Rapid Arc treatment plan verification using a two dimensional ionization chamber array.', 'mARC prostate treatment planning with Varian Eclipse for flat vs. FFF beams.', 'Which IMRT?

The kinetics of acetate incorporation into tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and into lipids suggest that detection of tumors with [1-(11)C]acetate PET could be improved by imaging at later time points.  Methods:   The uptake and metabolism of [1-(11)C], [1-(13)C], and [1-(14)C]acetate were measured in mouse prostate and lung cancer models to investigate the time course of (11)C label incorporation into tumor metabolites.  Results:   Radioactivity in the lipid fraction, as compared with the aqueous fraction, in extracts of C4-2B human prostate xenografts peaked at 90 min after [1-(14)C]acetate injection, which coincided with peak (13)C label incorporation into the fatty acids palmitate and stearate. Contrast between the tumor and tissues, such as blood and muscle, increased in PET images acquired over a period of 120 min after [1-(11)C]acetate injection, and Patlak plots were linear from 17.5 min after injection. Similar results were obtained in a genetically engineered K-ras(G12D); p53(null) lung cancer model, in which the mean tumor-to-lung ratio at 90 min after [1-(14)C]acetate injection was 4.4-fold higher than at 15 min.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that when imaging de novo fatty acid synthesis with [1-(11)C]acetate it is preferable to measure uptake at later time points, when the effects of perfusion and (11)C incorporation into tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and bicarbonate are declining. The data presented here suggest that future clinical PET scans of tumors should be acquired later than 30 min, when tracer accumulation due to de novo fatty acid synthesis prevails.""","""['David Y Lewis', 'Joan Boren', 'Greg L Shaw', 'Robert Bielik', 'Antonio Ramos-Montoya', 'Timothy J Larkin', 'Carla P Martins', 'David E Neal', 'Dmitry Soloviev', 'Kevin M Brindle']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Biodistribution and positron emission tomography imaging of 11C-acetate in murine model of lung carcinoma.', '(11)Cacetate PET Imaging is not Always Associated with Increased Lipogenesis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Mice.', 'Feasibility of 11C-acetate PET/CT for imaging of fatty acid synthesis in the atherosclerotic vessel wall.', 'Application of C-11-acetate positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging in prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.', 'Positron emission tomography for prostate, bladder, and renal cancer.', 'Radiosynthesis, Preclinical, and Clinical Positron Emission Tomography Studies of Carbon-11 Labeled Endogenous and Natural Exogenous Compounds.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Building the Bridge: Molecular Imaging Biomarkers for 21st Century Cancer Therapies.', 'Targeting ACSS2 with a Transition-State Mimetic Inhibits Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Growth.', 'Imaging Metabolically Active Fat: A Literature Review and Mechanistic Insights.']"""

Previously, we discovered the mechanism of CRHR-mediated apoptosis of mouse prostate cancer cell line (RM-1) to be a change of Bcl-2:Bax ratio, and CRH was found to inhibit transforming growth factor β migration of breast cancer cells via CRHRs. In the present study, we investigated cytosolic calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) bridging CRHR activations and Bcl-2:Bax ratio and the effect of CRHR activation on cell migration. Silencing of cPLA2 attenuated a CRHR1 agonist, CRH-induced apoptosis, and the decrease of the Bcl-2:Bax ratio, whereas silencing of cPLA2 aggravated CRHR2 agonist, Urocortin 2 (Ucn2)-inhibited apoptosis, and the increase of the Bcl-2:Bax ratio. CRH in a time- and concentration-dependent manner increased cPLA2 expression mainly through interleukin 1β (IL1β) upregulation. Ucn2 decreased cPLA2 expression through neither tumor necrosis factor α nor IL1β. CRH-suppressed decay of cPLA2 mRNA and Ucn2 merely suppressed its production. Overexpression of CRHR1 or CRHR2 in HEK293 cells correspondingly upregulated or downregulated cPLA2 expression after CRH or Ucn2 stimulation respectively. In addition, both CRH and Ucn2 induced migration of RM-1 cells. Our observation not only established a relationship between CRHRs and cell migration but also for the first time, to our knowledge, demonstrated that cPLA2 participates in CRHR1-induced apoptosis and CRHR2-inhibited apoptosis.""","""['Lai Jin', 'Chuanhua Li', 'Rong Li', 'Zongxing Sun', 'Xianjun Fang', 'Shengnan Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Mol Endocrinol""","""['Urocortin affects migration of hepatic cancer cell lines via differential regulation of cPLA2 and iPLA2.', 'Urocortin increased endothelial ICAM1 by cPLA2-dependent NF-κB and PKA pathways in HUVECs.', 'CRH suppressed TGFβ1-induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition via induction of E-cadherin in breast cancer cells.', 'Potential uses of corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonists.', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Family and Their Receptors in the Cardiovascular System.', 'Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Hormones Impair Pig Fertilization and Preimplantation Embryo Development via Inducing Oviductal Epithelial Apoptosis: An In Vitro Study.', 'Pituitary corticotroph identity and receptor-mediated signaling: a transcriptomics perspective.', 'Urocortin-1 Is Chondroprotective in Response to Acute Cartilage Injury via Modulation of Piezo1.', 'CRHR2/Ucn2 signaling is a novel regulator of miR-7/YY1/Fas circuitry contributing to reversal of colorectal cancer cell resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis.', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor 2 Signaling Promotes Mucosal Repair Responses after Colitis.']"""

Prospective randomized comparison with ciprofloxacin""","""Objective:   Prostate biopsy is the standardized diagnostic method for prostate cancer. However, although there is not a standardized protocol, there are recommendations in order to reduce the incidence of complications. The objective of the present work is to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prostate biopsy by comparing two antibiotic regimes: two doses of fosfomycin-trometamol 3g (FMT) every 48 hours with 10 doses of oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours during 5 days.  Material and methods:   Randomized prospective study was performed with 671 patients who had undergone to walking transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. Patients of group A (n=312) were treated with ciprofloxacin, and patients of group B (n=359) with FMT. Efficacy and tolerability of two prophylactic regimes were compared. Urine culture was carried out at 2 weeks after biopsy. Initially, patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria were not treated with antibiotics; urine culture was repeated after 1 month, persistent bacteriuria was treated according to antibiogram.  Results:   No differences between groups were found in age (P=.78), cancer presence (P=.9) or number of biopsy cylinders (P=.93). The mean number of cores obtained was 11.3 ± 3.25 (range 6-20). Digestive intolerance was observed for 9 patients (2.9%) of group A and 10 patients (2.8%) in group B. One patient (.3%) of group A showed severe allergic reaction. In total, 167 patients (24.6%) had complications: 16 (2.4%) fever, 47 (6.9%) hemospermia, 81 (11.9%) hematuria, 7 (1%) rectal bleeding and 16 (2.4%) urinary retention. No statistically differences between groups were observed (27.6% vs. 22.6%; P=.17). However, hemospermia was more frequent in group A (9.9% vs. 4.5%; P=.006). Bacteriuria after biopsy was detected in 44 patients (6.6%), being more frequent in group B patients (4.2% vs. 8.6%; P=.02) although a higher number of second treatment cycles were not needed (53.9% vs. 29%; P=.17). The likelihood of resistance to ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteriuria in A was greater than that of FMT in B (69.2% vs. 41.9%; P=.0004).  Conclusions:   Antibiotic prophylaxis with FMT (2 doses of 3g) in prostate biopsy is an alternative as effective and safe as ciprofloxacin (10 doses of 500 mg), which carries lower rate of resistance. According to our experience, this drug is a safe, well-tolerated, and easily manageable prophylactic option, facilitating patient compliance.

Both cold cup biopsies and transurethral (TUR) loop biopsies have been used to evaluate the status of the prostatic urethra. We report our 20 year experience with preoperative and intro-operative prostatic urethral biopsies in order to determine relative efficacy and associated treatment implications.  Materials and methods:   The Columbia University urologic oncology database was reviewed and yielded 234 men who underwent preoperative endoscopic biopsies of the prostatic urethra before RC between 1990 and 2010. Two techniques were described: 1) cold cup biopsy, and 2) TUR loop biopsy. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for these respective techniques relative to the final pathological status of the prostatic urethra (PU) in the RC specimen.  Results:   Of the 234 urethral biopsies 115 (49.1%) were cold cup and 96 (41.1%) were TUR loop biopsies. In the remaining 9.8% of patients, the technique could not be determined. Eighty-one preoperative biopsies (34.6%) revealed involvement of the urethra. No differences were observed in predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity between the two preoperative techniques. The negative predictive value (NPV) was higher than positive predictive value (PPV) for both preoperative approaches. Thirty-eight patients (16.2%) had a urethral frozen section analysis done intra-operatively. Only 1 patient (3%) had an abnormality on frozen section, being the negative predictive value (NPV) higher than the positive predictive value (PPV) for the test's ability to predict the status of the final urethral margin. Urethrectomy was performed at cystectomy in 52 patients with a positive biopsy; 15 (28.8%) of these patients ultimately had a negative PU on final pathology. Only 2/182 (1%) of the patients with an intact urethra presented with a urethral recurrence with a median follow up of 30.5 months.  Conclusions:   Preoperative prostatic urethral biopsy does not adequately predict final prostatic urethral status at radical cystectomy. No differences in predictive capacity could be detected with either cold cup biopsy or TUR biopsy. Intra-operative biopsy of the prostatic urethra is predictive of a negative urethral margin.

Therefore, inhibition of HIF-mediated transcription has potential in the treatment of cancer. One attractive strategy for inhibiting HIF activity is the disruption of the HIF-1α/p300 complex, as p300 is a crucial coactivator of hypoxia-inducible transcription. Several members of the epidithiodiketopiperazine (ETP) family of natural products have been shown to disrupt the HIF-1α/p300 complex in vitro; namely, gliotoxin, chaetocin, and chetomin. Here, we further characterized the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiangiogenic and antitumor effects of these ETPs using a preclinical model of prostate cancer. In the rat aortic ring angiogenesis assay, gliotoxin, chaetocin, and chetomin significantly inhibited microvessel outgrowth at a GI50 of 151, 8, and 20 nM, respectively. In vitro co-immunoprecipitation studies in prostate cancer cell extracts demonstrated that these compounds disrupted the HIF-1α/p300 complex. The downstream effects of inhibiting the HIF-1α/p300 interaction were evaluated by determining HIF-1α target gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels.

Abiraterone potently inhibits both reactions catalyzed by CYP17, the 17α-hydroxylase (hydroxylase) reaction as well as the 17,20-lyase (lyase) transformation. CYP17 hydroxylase inhibition prevents the synthesis of adrenal glucocorticoids and causes an accumulation of circulating mineralocorticoids. As a consequence of potent CYP17 hydroxylase inhibition (i.e., lack of lyase selectivity), AA must be co-administered with the cortisol replacement prednisone and patients may experience the effects of mineralocorticoid excess syndrome (MES). Herein, we describe rationally-designed, CYP17 lyase-selective inhibitors that could prove safer and more effective than abiraterone. Using proprietary methodology, the high-affinity pyridine or imidazole metal-binding group found in current clinical CYP17 inhibitors was replaced with novel, less avid, metal-binding groups in concert with potency-enhancing molecular scaffold modifications. This process produced a unique series of CYP17 lyase-selective inhibitors that included the oral agent 6 (VT-464), now in Phase 2 prostate cancer clinical trials.

However, little attention has been paid to the issue of treatment suitability for older people. Does existing treatment need to be adapted as subjects age, and does it make a difference if treatment is only started when the subject is already older?  Aim:   To assess the necessity of adapting cross-sex hormone administration for elderly transsexual people.  Main outcome measures:   Risks/benefits of continued use of cross-sex hormones with regard to bone health, cardiovascular risks, and malignancies.  Methods:   Due to lack of data on the subject population, sex hormone treatment of other conditions in older non-transsexual people has been taken as the best available analogy to determine the extent to which these might be applicable to comparable transsexual persons. Findings in transsexual people receiving cross-sex hormone treatment sometimes modified the above approach of applying guidelines for the elderly to the aging transsexual population.  Results:   Testosterone administration to female-to-male transsexual persons (FtoM) carries little risk with regard to cardiovascular disease and cancer. For those with high hematocrit or cardiac insufficiency the dose can be reduced. Administration of estrogens to male-to-female transsexual persons (MtoF), particularly when combined with progestins, does significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (almost a twofold incidence compared with the general population). This may require dose adjustment or changing from oral to safer transdermal estrogens. Tumors of the breasts, prostate and pituitary may occur. In FtoM, breast cancer can occur even after breast ablation. Older subjects can commence cross-sex hormone treatment without disproportionate risks.  Conclusion:   Cross-sex hormones may be continued into old age but monitoring for cardiovascular disease and malignancies, both of the old and new sex, is recommended. MtoF will have more health complications in old age than FtoM requiring adaptations of treatment.""","""['Louis Gooren', 'Paul Lips']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Cardiovascular disease in transsexual persons treated with cross-sex hormones: reversal of the traditional sex difference in cardiovascular disease pattern.', 'Five new cases of breast cancer in transsexual persons.', 'Long-term evaluation of cross-sex hormone treatment in transsexual persons.', 'Endocrine treatment of transsexual people: a review of treatment regimens, outcomes, and adverse effects.', 'Endocrine treatment of aging transgender people.', 'IDEA Group Consensus Statement on Medical Management of Adult Gender Incongruent Individuals Seeking Gender Affirmation as Male.', ""Transgender women's experiences and beliefs about hormone therapy through and beyond mid-age: An exploratory UK study."", 'Health considerations for transgender women and remaining unknowns: a narrative review.', 'Optimizing HIV prevention and care for transgender adults.', 'Strategies for improving the lives of US women aged 40 and above living with HIV/AIDS: an evidence map.']"""

Methods:   Two-hundred eighty-six metastatic prostate cancer patients who received PADT from 1998 to 2005 in Nara Uro-Oncology Research Group were enrolled. The log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards model were used to determine the predictive factors for prognosis; rate of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and overall survival.  Results:   The median age, follow-up period and PSA level at diagnosis were 73 years, 47 months and 174 ng/mL, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate was 63.0%. The multivariable analysis showed that Gleason score (Hazard ratio [HR]:1.362; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], 1.023-1.813), nadir PSA (HR:6.332; 95% C.I., 4.006-9.861) and time from PADT to nadir (HR:4.408; 95% C.I., 3.099-6.271) were independent prognostic factors of the incidence of CRPC. The independent parameters in the multivariate analysis that predicted overall survival were nadir PSA (HR:5.221; 95% C.I., 2.757-9.889) and time from PADT to nadir (HR:4.008; 95% C.I., 2.137-7.517).

The relationship between MRI signal intensity and cellular iron concentration for many new formulations, particularly MNPs having magnetic properties designed for heating in hyperthermia, is lacking. In this study, we examine the correlation between MRI T2 relaxation time and iron content in cancer cells loaded with various MNP formulations.  Materials and methods:   Human prostate carcinoma DU-145 cells were loaded with starch-coated bionised nanoferrite (BNF), iron oxide (Nanomag® D-SPIO), Feridex™, and dextran-coated Johns Hopkins University (JHU) particles at a target concentration of 50 pg Fe/cell using poly-D-lysine transfection reagent. T2-weighted MRI of serial dilutions of these labelled cells was performed at 9.4 T and iron content quantification was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Clonogenic assay was used to characterise cytotoxicity.  Results:   No cytotoxicity was observed at twice the target intracellular iron concentration (∼100 pg Fe/cell). ICP-MS revealed highest iron uptake efficiency with BNF and JHU particles, followed by Feridex and Nanomag-D-SPIO, respectively. Imaging data showed a linear correlation between increased intracellular iron concentration and decreased T2 times, with no apparent correlation among MNP magnetic properties.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that for the range of nanoparticle concentrations internalised by cancer cells the signal intensity of T2-weighted MRI correlates closely with absolute iron concentration associated with the cells.

The exclusive use of FGFR1 GCN for predicting FGFR TKI sensitivity assumes increased GCN is the only mechanism for biologically relevant increases in FGFR1 signaling. Herein, we tested whether FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression may serve as better biomarkers of FGFR TKI sensitivity in lung cancer.  Experimental design:   Histologically diverse lung cancer cell lines were submitted to assays for ponatinib sensitivity, a potent FGFR TKI. A tissue microarray composed of resected lung tumors was submitted to FGFR1 GCN, and mRNA analyses and the results were validated with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung cancer data.  Results:   Among 58 cell lines, 14 exhibited ponatinib sensitivity (IC50 values ≤ 50 nmol/L) that correlated with FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression, but not with FGFR1 GCN or histology. Moreover, ponatinib sensitivity associated with mRNA expression of the ligands, FGF2 and FGF9. In resected tumors, 22% of adenocarcinomas and 28% of SCCs expressed high FGFR1 mRNA. Importantly, only 46% of SCCs with increased FGFR1 GCN expressed high mRNA. Lung cancer TCGA data validated these findings and unveiled overlap of FGFR1 mRNA positivity with KRAS and PIK3CA mutations.  Conclusions:   FGFR1 dependency is frequent across various lung cancer histologies, and FGFR1 mRNA may serve as a better biomarker of FGFR TKI response in lung cancer than FGFR1 GCN.

The source of these androgens is highly controversial, with three competing models proposed. We, therefore, wished to determine the androgenic potential of human benign and malignant (hormone-naïve and treated) prostate tissue when incubated with various precursors and examine concomitant changes in enzyme expression.  Experimental design:   Freshly harvested prostate tissue [benign, hormone-naïve, and hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC)] was incubated in excess concentrations of cholesterol, progesterone, DHEA, androstenedione, or testosterone for 96 hours, and steroid concentrations in the conditioned media measured by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Changes in the expression of androgen synthetic and/or degradative enzymes were determined by expression microarray and qPCR. Significant changes were confirmed in an independent dataset.  Results:   Of the precursor molecules tested, only incubation with androstenedione gave rise to significant concentrations of signaling androgens. Although this was observed in all tissue types, it occurred to a significantly greater degree in hormone-refractory compared with hormone-naïve cancer. Consistent with this, gene set enrichment analysis of the expression microarray data revealed significant upregulation of 17HSD17B activity, with overexpression of the canonical enzyme AKR1C3 confirmed by qPCR in the same samples and in a publicly available expression dataset. Importantly, we found no evidence to support a significant contribution from either the ""backdoor"" or ""5-α dione"" pathway.

Experimental design:   RNAi screening was used to identify genes whose depletion is detrimental to Pim1-overexpressing cells. Our finding was validated using shRNA or PLK1-specific inhibitor BI 2536. Xenograft studies were performed using both PLK1-knockdown cells and BI 2536 to investigate the effects of PLK1 inhibition on tumorigenesis in Pim1-overexpressing cells. Finally, PLK1 and PIM1 expression patterns in human prostate tumors were examined by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays.  Results:   We identified the mitotic regulator polo-like kinase (PLK1) as a gene whose depletion is particularly detrimental to the viability of Pim1-overexpressing prostate cancer. Inhibition of PLK1 by shRNA or BI 2536 in Pim1-overexpressing prostate cancer xenograft models resulted in a dramatic inhibition of tumor progression. Notably, Pim1-overexpressing cells were more prone to mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis due to PLK1 inhibition than control cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PLK1 led to the reduction of MYC protein levels both in vitro and in vivo. Our data also suggest that PIM1 and PLK1 physically interact and PIM1 might phosphorylate PLK1. Finally, PLK1 and PIM1 are frequently co-expressed in human prostate tumors, and co-expression of PLK1 and PIM1 was significantly correlated to higher Gleason grades.

Such registration is challenging due to physical changes of the specimen during excision and fixation, and misalignment of the histological slices during preparation and digital scanning. In this work, we consider a multi-slice to volume registration method in which a stack of sparse, unaligned 2-D whole-mount histological slices is registered to a 3-D volumetric imaging of the prostate. We propose a particle filtering framework to contend with the high dimensionality of the search space and multimodal nature of the optimization. Such framework allows modeling of the uncertainty in the pose of the slices and in the imaged information, in order to derive optimal registration parameters in a Bayesian approach. Intensity-, region-, and point-based similarity metrics were incorporated into the registration algorithm to account for different imaging modalities.

It has demonstrated anti-tumour activity in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models.  Material and methods:   This first-in-man phase I/II study utilised a 3 + 3 dose escalation design starting at 30 mg ASP9521/day, with the aim of defining a maximum tolerated dose, as defined by the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities. Eligible patients received ASP9521 orally for 12 weeks. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and anti-tumour activity were assessed.  Results:   Thirteen patients (median age: 68 years; range 52-76) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressing after chemotherapy were included; 12 patients discontinued treatment at or before week 13, mainly due to disease progression. The most common adverse events were grade 1/2 and included asthenia (N = 5), constipation (N = 4), diarrhoea (N = 3), back pain (N = 3) and cancer pain (N = 3). PK demonstrated a half-life (t1/2) ranging from 16 to 35 h, rapid absorption and dose proportionality. No biochemical or radiological responses were identified; neither endocrine biomarker levels nor circulating tumour cell counts were altered by ASP9521. Given the lack of observable clinical activity, the study was terminated without implementing a planned 12-week dose expansion part at selected doses or a planned food-effect study part.

However, some patients exhibit favorable pathological features or experience long-term PSA-free survival after radical prostatectomy (RP). We retrospectively examined the ability of preoperative characteristics to predict pathological and oncological outcomes in high-risk Pca patients who underwent RP.  Methods:   We examined data of 1,268 consecutive Pca patients treated with RP alone at 4 hospitals from the Michinoku Urological Cancer Study Group database. Preoperative predictors included age, PSA level, biopsy Gleason score, clinical T stage, and PSA density (PSAD). The outcome measures pathological T stage and PSA-free survival were evaluated by multivariate analysis.  Results:   We identified 380 high-risk Pca patients, of which 44 % patients had extracapsular extension. Logistic regression analysis indicated that PSAD was an independent predictor of adverse pathologic stage. The 5-year PSA-free survival rates were 82.9 % for patients with PSAD ≤0.468 ng mL(-1) cm(-2) and 50.7 % for those with PSAD >0.468 ng mL(-1) cm(-2) (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that PSAD, cT, and the number of preoperative high-risk Pca criteria were independent predictors of PSA-free survival.

Methods:   The prevalence of MDD risk among cancer survivors (breast, prostate, bladder, colorectal, lung, and endometrial/uterine cancers) and those without cancer was estimated using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS) linked database (n = 9,282 with cancer/n = 289,744 without cancer). Risk for MDD was measured using three items from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, and HRQOL was measured by the SF-36. UI was defined as self-reported leakage of urine causing a problem in previous 6 months. Factors associated with MDD were investigated using logistic regression, and the impact of co-occurring MDD and UI on HRQOL scores was determined using linear regression.  Results:   The prevalence of MDD risk ranged from 19.2 % for prostate to 34.1 % for lung. Lung cancer diagnosis was associated with risk of MDD. Being ≥5 years from diagnosis was associated with decreased risk of MDD (prevalence odds ratio (POR) = 0.82, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0.71, 0.95). The coexistence of both UI and MDD was associated with a decrease across HRQOL subscales; including 40 points on role-emotional (RE) score.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used as a modality to detect prostate cancer. Therefore, computer-aided detection of prostate cancer in MRI images has become an active area of research. In this paper we investigate a fully automated computer-aided detection system which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we detect initial candidates using multi-atlas-based prostate segmentation, voxel feature extraction, classification and local maxima detection. The second stage segments the candidate regions and using classification we obtain cancer likelihoods for each candidate. Features represent pharmacokinetic behavior, symmetry and appearance, among others. The system is evaluated on a large consecutive cohort of 347 patients with MR-guided biopsy as the reference standard. This set contained 165 patients with cancer and 182 patients without prostate cancer. Performance evaluation is based on lesion-based free-response receiver operating characteristic curve and patient-based receiver operating characteristic analysis. The system is also compared to the prospective clinical performance of radiologists. Results show a sensitivity of 0.42, 0.75, and 0.89 at 0.1, 1, and 10 false positives per normal case. In clinical workflow the system could potentially be used to improve the sensitivity of the radiologist. At the high specificity reading setting, which is typical in screening situations, the system does not perform significantly different from the radiologist and could be used as an independent second reader instead of a second radiologist. Furthermore, the system has potential in a first-reader setting.""","""['Geert Litjens', 'Oscar Debats', 'Jelle Barentsz', 'Nico Karssemeijer', 'Henkjan Huisman']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Automatic computer-aided detection of prostate cancer based on multiparametric magnetic resonance image analysis.', 'A fully automatic computer aided diagnosis system for peripheral zone prostate cancer detection using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients with persistently elevated PSA and tumor-negative biopsy in ambulatory care: performance of MR imaging in a multi-reader environment.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate - technique and clinical applications.', 'Interpretation and reporting multiparametric prostate MRI: a primer for residents and novices.', 'Anatomically guided self-adapting deep neural network for clinically significant prostate cancer detection on bi-parametric MRI: a multi-center study.', 'Value of handcrafted and deep radiomic features towards training robust machine learning classifiers for prediction of prostate cancer disease aggressiveness.', 'Multi-resolution super learner for voxel-wise classification of prostate cancer using multi-parametric MRI.', 'Current Technologies for Detection of COVID-19: Biosensors, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT): Review.', 'PI-RADSAI: introducing a new human-in-the-loop AI model for prostate cancer diagnosis based on MRI.']"""

The transcription/translation regulatory Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is known to be associated with cancer metastasis. We observed that YB-1 expression increased with tumor grade and showed an inverse relationship with E-cadherin in a human PCa tissue array. Forced YB-1 expression induced a mesenchymal morphology that was associated with down regulation of epithelial markers. Silencing of YB-1 reversed mesenchymal features and decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion in PCa cells. YB-1 is activated directly via Akt mediated phosphorylation at Ser102 within the cold shock domain (CSD). We next identified fisetin as an inhibitor of YB-1 activation. Computational docking and molecular dynamics suggested that fisetin binds on the residues from β1 - β4 strands of CSD, hindering Akt's interaction with YB-1. Calculated free binding energy ranged from -11.9845 to -9.6273 kcal/mol. Plasmon Surface Resonance studies showed that fisetin binds to YB-1 with an affinity of approximately 35 µM, with both slow association and dissociation.

The costs were presented in 2011 Canadian dollars.  Results:   A convenience sample of 37 patients from 2 hospital outpatient oncology clinics in Ontario and Quebec participated in the study. Nineteen patients were diagnosed with breast cancer and 18 with prostate cancer. The average patient age was 66 years, and patients had been diagnosed with cancer and metastatic bone disease for 8 years and 3 years, respectively. The times and costs associated with the administration of bisphosphonates for the 28 patients who did not receive concurrent chemotherapy during the scheduled clinic visits are also reported. The mean infusion time for patients receiving zoledronic acid was 20.6 minutes. With the use of ambulatory infusion devices, the mean infusion time of pamidronate was 23 minutes (limited to observations of patients who were seated during administration). In contrast, the mean infusion time using regular infusion devices was 162 minutes. The mean labor cost for administering zoledronic acid was $20. The mean labor cost for administering pamidronate was $10 using ambulatory infusion devices and $68 using regular infusion devices.  Conclusion:   The time burden to cancer patients with metastatic bone disease who receive intravenous bisphosphonates and the costs to the health care system are substantial, especially when regular infusion devices are used.""","""['Feng Xie', 'Robert B Hopkins', 'Natasha Burke', 'Mohdhar Habib', 'Carlo De Angelis', 'Mark Pasetka', 'Angie Giotis', 'Ron Goeree']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Hosp Pract (1995)""","""['Patient management, and time and health care resource utilization associated with the use of intravenous bisphosphonates for patients with metastatic bone disease: a Delphi study.', 'Economic evaluation of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Cost-effectiveness of oral ibandronate versus IV zoledronic acid or IV pamidronate for bone metastases in patients receiving oral hormonal therapy for breast cancer in the United Kingdom.', 'Zoledronic acid: a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in the management of bone metastases.', 'Bisphosphonates for cancer patients: why, how, and when?', 'The Purpose of Time-Motion Studies (TMSs) in Healthcare: A Literature Review.', 'Burden of Treatment among Elderly Patients with Cancer: A Scoping Review.']"""

Here we demonstrate that cholesterol increases Ca(2+) entry via the TRPM7 channel, which promoted proliferation of prostate cells by inducing the activation of the AKT and/or the ERK pathway. Additionally, cholesterol mediated Ca(2+) entry induced calpain activity that showed a decrease in E-cadherin expression, which together could lead to migration of prostate cancer cells. An overexpression of TRPM7 significantly facilitated cholesterol dependent Ca(2+) entry, cell proliferation and tumor growth. Whereas, TRPM7 silencing or inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by statin showed a significant decrease in cholesterol-mediated activation of TRPM7, cell proliferation, and migration of prostate cancer cells. Consistent with these results, statin intake was inversely correlated with prostate cancer patients and increase in TRPM7 expression was observed in samples obtained from prostate cancer patients. Altogether, we provide evidence that cholesterol-mediated activation of TRPM7 is important for prostate cancer and have identified that TRPM7 could be essential for initiation and/or progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Yuyang Sun', 'Pramod Sukumaran', 'Archana Varma', 'Susan Derry', 'Abe E Sahmoun', 'Brij B Singh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Increase in serum Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio promotes proliferation of prostate cancer cells by activating TRPM7 channels.', 'TGFβ-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells is mediated via TRPM7 expression.', 'Downregulation of TRPM7 suppressed migration and invasion by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells.', 'Oncogenic role and therapeutic target of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 channel in malignancy.', 'Function and regulation of the channel-kinase TRPM7 in health and disease.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Cardiovascular toxicity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors during cancer treatment: Potential involvement of TRPM7.', 'The interplay between physical cues and mechanosensitive ion channels in cancer metastasis.', 'Cholesterol-Lowering Phytochemicals: Targeting the Mevalonate Pathway for Anticancer Interventions.', 'CD44 Expression Intensity Marks Colorectal Cancer Cell Subpopulations with Different Extracellular Vesicle Release Capacity.']"""

Notably the impact of body mass index on long-term survival after treatment is unclear. We performed a retrospective cohort study on a large series of men who underwent radical prostatectomy to assess the impact of obesity on long-term biochemical recurrence-free survival, prostate cancer specific survival and overall survival.  Materials and methods:   Between 1982 and 2012, 11,152 men underwent radical prostatectomy at a single tertiary referral center. Patients were stratified according to body mass index as normal weight (body mass index less than 25 kg/m(2)), overweight (body mass index 25 to less than 30 kg/m(2)), mild obesity (body mass index 30 to less than 35 kg/m(2)) and moderate/severe obesity (body mass index 35 kg/m(2) or greater), comprising 27.6%, 56.0%, 14.1% and 2.3% of the cohort, respectively. Covariates included age, preoperative prostate specific antigen, surgery year, Gleason score, pathological stage, surgical margin and race. Predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival, prostate cancer specific survival and overall survival were identified using Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   Median followup was 5 years (range 1 to 27). Actuarial 20-year biochemical recurrence-free survival for mild and moderate/severe obesity was 65% and 51%, respectively, compared to 76% for normal weight men (p ≤0.001). In a multivariate model obesity was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival (mild HR 1.30, p = 0.002; moderate/severe HR 1.45, p = 0.028) and overall survival (mild HR 1.41, p = 0.003; moderate/severe HR 1.81, p = 0.033). However, only mild obesity was significantly associated with prostate cancer specific survival (HR 1.51, p = 0.040), whereas moderate/severe obesity was not (HR 1.58, p = 0.356).

Staging, grading and prostate specific antigen level at surgery are helpful but still imperfect predictors of recurrence. For this reason there is an imperative need for additional biomarkers that add to the prediction of currently used prognostic factors.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated the extent of promoter methylation of genes previously reported as aberrantly methylated in prostate cancer (AIM1, APC, CCND2, GPX3, GSTP1, MCAM, RARβ2, SSBP2 and TIMP3) by quantitative fluorogenic methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We used cancer tissue from a nested case-control study of 452 patients surgically treated for prostate cancer. Recurrence cases and controls were compared and the association between methylation extent and recurrence risk was estimated by logistic regression adjusting for patient age at prostatectomy, prostatectomy year, stage, grade, surgical margins and preprostatectomy prostate specific antigen. All statistical tests were 2-sided with p ≤0.05 considered statistically significant.  Results:   The extent of GSTP1 methylation was higher in patients with recurrence than in controls (p = 0.01), especially patients with early disease, ie organ confined or limited extraprostatic extension (p = 0.001). After multivariate adjustment GSTP1 promoter methylation at or above the median was associated with an increased risk of recurrence, including in men with early disease (each p = 0.05).  Conclusions:   Greater GSTP1 promoter methylation in cancer tissue was independently associated with the risk of recurrence in patients with early prostate cancer.

Numerous studies show that survival estimates by physicians are inaccurate. We determined how well men undergoing radical prostatectomy for cancer are prognosticated by comparing observed and expected survival.  Materials and methods:   We performed an observational cohort study using population based data sets to identify each man in Ontario, Canada between 1992 and 2011 who was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent radical prostatectomy within 6 months. Observed 10-year survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Two expected 10-year survival rates were calculated using 1) population life tables and 2) the ADG® score, an accurate, validated index that predicts mortality risk based on patient comorbidities.  Results:   A total of 36,045 men with a median age of 62 years were included in the study. Median observation time was 8.1 years. Observed 10-year survival was 88.9% (95% CI 88.4-89.3), significantly greater than the expected 10-year survival of 83.3% according to life tables and 76.0% according to ADG score. The observed-to-expected death ratio was 0.66 (range 0.64-0.68) and 0.46 (range 0.45-0.48) using life tables and the ADG score, respectively.  Conclusions:   Ontario men who undergo radical prostatectomy for cancer have 10-year survival that significantly exceeds that of the population and individuals with similar comorbidities. This indicates that physicians and patients involved in deciding who should undergo radical prostatectomy have done an excellent job at identifying patients with prostate cancer with high survival.

Here, our aim was to identify deregulated proteins in TNBC with potential therapeutic applications. Proteomics profiling of TNBC and normal breast tissues through two-dimensional electrophoresis and ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry revealed the existence of 16 proteins (RhoGDI-2, HSP27, SOD1, DJ1, UBE2N, PSME1, FTL, SH3BGRL, and eIF5A-1) with increased abundance in carcinomas. We also evidenced for the first time the deregulation of COX5, MTPN and DB1 proteins in TNBC that may represent novel tumor markers. Particularly, we confirmed the overexpression of the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI-2) in distinct breast cancer subtypes, as well as in metastatic cell lines derived from lung, prostate, and breast cancer. Remarkably, targeted disruption of RhoGDI-2 by RNA interference induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and facilitated caspase-3 and -9 activation in two breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, suppression of RhoGDI-2 resulted in a robust sensitization of breast cancer cells to cisplatin therapy. In conclusion, we identified novel proteins deregulated in TNBC, and confirmed the overexpression of RhoGDI-2. We propose that RhoGDI-2 inhibition may be exploited as a potential therapeutic strategy along cisplatin-based chemotherapy in breast cancer.  Biological significance:   There are no useful biomarkers neither targeted therapeutic modalities for triple-negative breast cancer, which highly contributes to the poor prognosis of this breast cancer subtype. In this work, we used two-dimensional electrophoresis and ESI-MS/MS spectrometry to identify novel deregulated proteins in breast cancer tissues. Particularly, our results showed that RhoGDI-2, a protein that has been associated to metastasis and poor survival in human cancers, is overexpressed in different subtypes of breast tumors, as well as in metastatic cell lines derived from lung, prostate, and breast cancer.

It results in increased perineural space cancer cell growth and decreased apoptosis and induces nerve growth. Tissue microarrays were constructed from 640 radical prostatectomy specimens with prostate cancer. The perineural diameter was measured as previously described. Multiple biomarkers have been previously performed on this tissue microarray cohort, and all data were kept in the same database. The biomarker results database was queried for correlations between perineural invasion diameter and tissue biomarkers. Increased perineural invasion diameter correlated with increased proliferation of prostate cancer cells and with apoptosis. It also correlated with proteins involved in survival pathways such as nuclear factor κB, c-Myc, phosphorylated AKT, and its downstream effector FHKR, but not with GSK. Unlike nerve density, it did not correlate with decreased PTEN expression. Increased perineural invasion diameter was associated with higher levels of hormonal receptors such as androgen receptor, but not estrogen receptor. Also associated with perineural invasion diameter were coregulators and corepressors including SRC1 and TIF2. Perineural invasion diameter had the strongest correlation with tumor volume (ρ = 0.579, P = .000), not identified with nerve density. These data demonstrate that perineural invasion has the same biologic correlations as neural density. However, we found a distinct and very strong correlation with increased tumor volume.

Coumestrol significantly suppressed SPHK1 activity and accumulation of HIF-1α in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in hypoxic PC-3 cells. In addition, coumestrol inhibited the phosphorylation status of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK 3β) signaling involved in cancer metabolism. Furthermore, SPHK1 siRNA transfection, sphigosine kinase inhibitor (SKI), reactive oxygen species (ROS) enhanced the inhibitory effect of coumestrol on the accumulation of HIF-1α and the expression of pAKT and pGSK 3β in hypoxic PC-3 cells by combination index.

Because mixed lineage kinase (MLK) and one of its downstream effectors (extracellular signal-regulated kinases [ERK]) have previously been implicated in some aspects of prostate epithelial differentiation, we conducted further studies in which LNCaP cells were cotreated with dimethyl sulfoxide (control), PD98059 (ERK inhibitor), or MLK inhibitor during transfection with Ad-SLFN12 for 72 h.  Results:   Treatment of LNCaP or PC-3 cells with Ad-SLFN12 reduced PSA expression by 56.6±4.6% (P<0.05) but increased DPP4 transcript level by 4.8±1.0 fold (P<0.05) versus Ad-GFP-treated controls. Further studies in LNCaP cells showed that Ad-SLFN12 overexpression increased the ratio of the mature E-cadherin protein to its precursor protein. Furthermore, SLFN12 overexpression promoted DPP4 expression either when MLK or ERK was blocked. ERK inhibition did not reverse SLFN12-induced changes in PSA, E-cadherin, or DPP4.  Conclusions:   SLFN12 may regulate differentiation in prostate epithelial cells, at least in part independently of ERK or MLK. Understanding how SLFN12 influences prostatic epithelial differentiation may ultimately identify targets to influence the phenotype of prostatic malignancy.""","""['Pavlo L Kovalenko', 'Marc D Basson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Surg Res""","""['Structural, molecular, and functional insights into Schlafen proteins.', 'The correlation between the expression of differentiation markers in rat small intestinal mucosa and the transcript levels of schlafen 3.', 'Schlafen12 Reduces the Aggressiveness of Triple Negative Breast Cancer through Post-Transcriptional Regulation of ZEB1 That Drives Stem Cell Differentiation.', 'S100A16 promotes cell proliferation and metastasis via AKT and ERK cell signaling pathways in human prostate cancer.', 'Schlafen 12 Interaction with SerpinB12 and Deubiquitylases Drives Human Enterocyte Differentiation.', 'Schlafen 12 Slows TNBC Tumor Growth, Induces Luminal Markers, and Predicts Favorable Survival.', '14-weeks combined exercise epigenetically modulated 118 genes of menopausal women with prediabetes.', 'Structural, molecular, and functional insights into Schlafen proteins.', 'SLFN12 Over-expression Sensitizes Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells to Chemotherapy Drugs and Radiotherapy.', 'Structural and biochemical characterization of human Schlafen 5.']"""

Bone represents the major site of metastasis for prostate cancer (CaP) cells, which rely on bone-derived factors to support their proliferation and resistance to therapeutics. In the present work we have found that conditioned medium (CM) from the MC3T3 osteoblastic cell line or primary murine and human osteoblast-like cells, as well as co-culture with MC3T3 stimulate proliferation of CaP lines in S1P-dependent manner. In addition, osteoblastic-derived S1P induces resistance of CaP cells to therapeutics including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. When S1P release from osteoblastic cells is decreased (inhibition of SphK1, knock-down of SphK1 or the S1P transporter, Spns2 by siRNA) or secreted S1P neutralized with anti-S1P antibody, the proliferative and survival effects of osteoblasts on CaP cells are abolished. Because of the paracrine nature of the signaling, we studied the role of the S1P receptors expressed on CaP cells in the communication with S1P secreted by osteoblasts. Strategies aimed at down-regulating S1P1, S1P2 or S1P3 (siRNA, antagonists), established the exclusive role of the S1P/S1P1 signaling between osteoblasts and CaP cells. Bone metastases from CaP are associated with osteoblastic differentiation resulting in abnormal bone formation. We show that the autocrine S1P/S1P3 signaling is central during differentiation to mature osteoblasts by regulating Runx2 level, a key transcription factor involved in osteoblastic maturation. Importantly, differentiated osteoblasts exhibited enhanced secretion of S1P and further stimulated CaP cell proliferation in a S1P-dependent manner. By establishing the dual role of osteoblast-borne S1P on both osteoblastic differentiation and CaP cell proliferation and survival, we uncover the importance of S1P in the bone metastatic microenvironment, which may open a novel area of study for the treatment of CaP bone metastasis by targeting S1P.""","""['Leyre Brizuela', 'Claire Martin', 'Pauline Jeannot', 'Isabelle Ader', 'Cécile Gstalder', 'Guillaume Andrieu', 'Magalie Bocquet', 'Jean-Michel Laffosse', 'Anne Gomez-Brouchet', 'Bernard Malavaud', 'Roger A Sabbadini', 'Olivier Cuvillier']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Sphingosine-1-phosphate/S1PR2-mediated signaling triggers Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and thereby induces Runx2 expression in osteoblasts.', 'Role of Sphingosine Kinase 1 and S1P Transporter Spns2 in HGF-mediated Lamellipodia Formation in Lung Endothelium.', 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate-induced Flk-1 transactivation stimulates mouse embryonic stem cell proliferation through S1P1/S1P3-dependent β-arrestin/c-Src pathways.', 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling and biological activities in the cardiovascular system.', 'The role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in regulation of osteoclastic and osteoblastic cells.', 'The Ying and Yang of Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Signalling within the Bone.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 agonist induces bone formation in rat apicoectomy and alveolar bone defect model.', 'Role of Sphingolipids in Multiple Myeloma Progression, Drug Resistance, and Their Potential as Therapeutic Targets.', 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate hinders the osteogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells in association with AKT signaling pathways.']"""

Although operative time has been used as a metric to evaluate RP surgeon learning curves, the effect of RP operative times on outcomes remains understudied.  Materials and methods:   We used US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data to identify 7534 men aged≥66 years diagnosed with prostate cancer during 2003-2007 who underwent RP for localized prostate cancer through 2009. We categorized RP operative time into quartiles (short, intermediate, long, and very long) and used propensity score analyses to assess its impact on perioperative complications, mortality, length of hospitalization, readmissions, emergency room visits, and costs.  Results:   Quartiles ranged from 0 to 172 minutes for short, 173 to 214 minutes for intermediate, 215 to 268 minutes for long, and ≥269 minutes for very long RP operative times. After propensity score adjustment, longer operative time was associated with more surgery-related complications (short, 12.0%; intermediate, 12.3%; long, 14.4%; and very long, 22.8%; P<.001), longer median (interquartile range) length of stay in days (short, 2 [2-3]; intermediate, 2 [2-3]; long, 2 [1-3]; and very long, 2 [1-3]; P<.001), and higher median costs (short, $10,647; intermediate, $10,957; long, $11,405; and very long, $11,966; P<.001).

The results of these 2 methods were compared. Immunohistochemistry staining for p504s and p63 was performed on sections from 42 patients with a primary diagnosis of ASAP. Meanwhile, digital still images were taken from hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of cases and were sent to an expert uropathologist, blind to IHC staining interpretations. The results of IHC staining were compared with diagnostic interpretations of the consultant pathologist. In 13 cases, the focus of concern was not detectable on IHC slides. In the remaining 29 cases, IHC showed a benign and malignant expression pattern in 17 and 9 patients, respectively. In 3 cases, IHC findings were inconclusive and retained the diagnosis of ASAP. The consultant pathologist diagnosed 11 cases of benign and 7 cases of malignant processes. He retained the diagnosis of ASAP in 11 cases. There was high concordance between the results of IHC and electronic consultation in the group of benign cases. All 11 cases with the diagnosis of benignancy by electronic consultation showed a benign IHC pattern. Among 7 cases with the diagnosis of malignancy by the consultant pathologist, 5 were classified as malignant, 1 as benign, and 1 as inconclusive IHC groups. Considering problems with IHC staining of prostate needle biopsy, including loss of focus of interest, expert consultation using still images can provide very useful diagnostic information.

The Toronto cohort contained a higher proportion of early stage cases (P = .019) and a smaller proportion of cases from the proximal stomach (P < .001). Overall, immunohistochemical loss of BAF250a was observed in 22.5% of gastric adenocarcinomas from the Vancouver group and 20% from Toronto. In both cohorts, loss of BAF250a was positively associated with loss of mismatch repair protein expression (P < .0001 and P = .035, respectively). Loss of BAF250a expression was independently associated with poor overall survival in the Toronto cohort (P = .0015), whereas no significant association with survival was observed in the Vancouver cohort. BAF250a loss was not significantly associated with any additional clinical parameters in either cohort. HER2 amplification was confirmed as a negative prognostic factor in both cohorts.

Our previously published data showed that nerve density and the number of neurons in the parasympathetic ganglia are increased in prostate cancer (PCa) and associated with aggressive disease. Tissue microarrays were constructed from 640 radical prostatectomy specimens with PCa. Anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) antibodies were used to identify and quantify nerve density. Protein expression was objectively analyzed using deconvolution imaging, image segmentation, and image analysis. Data were correlated with clinicopathological variables and tissue biomarkers available in our database. Nerve density, as measured by PGP 9.5 expression, had a weak but significant positive correlation with the lymph node status (ρ = 0.106; P = .0275). By Cox univariate analysis, PGP 9.5 was a predictor of time to biochemical recurrence, but not on multivariate analysis. Increased nerve density correlated with increased proliferation of PCa cells. It also correlated with expression of proteins involved in survival pathways (Phosphorylated alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, NFκB, GSK-2, PIM-2, c-Myc, SKP-2, SRF, P27n, PTEN), with increased levels of hormonal regulation elements (androgen receptor, estrogen receptor α), and coregulators and repressors (SRC-1, SRC-2, AIB-1, DAX). Axonogenesis is a recently described phenomenon of paramount importance in the biology of PCa. Although the degree of axonogenesis is predictive of aggressive behavior in PCa, it does not add to the information present in current models on multivariate analysis.

Methods:   The Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study (PCOS) enrolled 3533 men in whom prostate cancer had been diagnosed in 1994 or 1995. The current cohort comprised 1655 men in whom localized prostate cancer had been diagnosed between the ages of 55 and 74 years and who had undergone either surgery (1164 men) or radiotherapy (491 men). Functional status was assessed at baseline and at 2, 5, and 15 years after diagnosis. We used multivariable propensity scoring to compare functional outcomes according to treatment.  Results:   Patients undergoing prostatectomy were more likely to have urinary incontinence than were those undergoing radiotherapy at 2 years (odds ratio, 6.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92 to 20.29) and 5 years (odds ratio, 5.10; 95% CI, 2.29 to 11.36). However, no significant between-group difference in the odds of urinary incontinence was noted at 15 years. Similarly, although patients undergoing prostatectomy were more likely to have erectile dysfunction at 2 years (odds ratio, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.93 to 6.17) and 5 years (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.63), no significant between-group difference was noted at 15 years.

In the present study, we investigated the early complications of RP developing within 90 days in our institute according to the Martin criteria.  Methods:   Between January 2003 and November 2011, patients with organ-confined adenocarcinoma of the prostate who received RP in our institute were retrospectively reviewed. The operation was done as open RP, or minimally invasive RP, including laparoscopic RP and robot-assisted laparoscopic RP (RaLP). The preoperative, operative, postoperative, and pathological parameters were recorded for analysis. Definitions of complications were adopted from previous reports. Surgical and medical complications developed within 90 days postoperatively were identified respectively; severity of each complication was classified according to Clavien-Dindo classification. Clavien-Dindo classification grade III or higher complications were viewed as major complications.  Results:   A total of 359 patients were included; 280 (78%) underwent open RP, 45 (12.5%) received laparoscopic RP, and 34 (9.5%) had RaLP. The overall complication rate was 40.1%, and the major complication rate was 13.1%. There was no surgical mortality. Diarrhea requiring conservative treatment (13.6%), minor urine leakage (9.5%), and gout attack (4.2%) were the leading complications. Minimally invasive RP had higher rates of lymph leakage (p = 0.015) and upper-extremity neuropathy (p = 0.048). Body mass index >25 kg/m(2) and use of neoadjuvant hormone therapy were predictors for overall and major complications, whereas diabetes mellitus also predicted the development of major complications. Besides lower case volume and learning curve for RaLP, patients' higher age at surgery and higher risk for disease progression compared to the Western series may be responsible for the higher complication rates.

And as a result, the sensitive detection of sarcosine can be realized by the naked eye observation and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, using Pd NPs as catalyst and TMB as the substrate of the simulation enzyme catalytic reaction. Under the optimal condition, the catalytic system of Pd NPs mimic enzyme can be used for the detection of sarcosine. It has been found that the color change could be clearly observed with the naked eyes, and the absorbance intensity at 653 nm showed a fine linear fitting with the concentration of sarcosine in the range from 0.01 μM to 50 μM, and the detection limit (3σ/S) for sarcosine was calculated to be 5.0 nM. In order to evaluate the feasibility and reliability, the method was also used for analyzing concentrations of sarcosine in human urine samples from diagnosed prostate cancer patients and healthy donors. It is expected to provide a convenient and efficient method for indirect evaluation for the diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma (PCa).""","""['Jianming Lan', 'Wenming Xu', 'Qiping Wan', 'Xi Zhang', 'Jia Lin', 'Jinghua Chen', 'Jianzhong Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['A Rapid Method for the Detection of Sarcosine Using SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs for Prostate Cancer Sensing.', 'β-Cyclodextrin coated porous Pd@Au nanostructures with enhanced peroxidase-like activity for colorimetric and paper-based determination of glucose.', 'A colorimetric aptasensor for sulfadimethoxine detection based on peroxidase-like activity of graphene/nickel@palladium hybrids.', 'Glutathione-stabilized palladium nanozyme for colorimetric assay of silver(I) ions.', 'Quantitative analysis of sarcosine with special emphasis on biosensors: a review.', 'Exploration of nanozymes in viral diagnosis and therapy.', 'Amperometric Miniaturised Portable Enzymatic Nanobiosensor for the Ultrasensitive Analysis of a Prostate Cancer Biomarker.', 'Investigation on the Peroxidase-like Activity of Vitamin B6 and Its Applications in Colorimetric Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide and Total Antioxidant Capacity Evaluation.', 'Long chain ionic liquid-assisted synthesis of PS/Pd beads and hierarchical porous Pd-SiO2.', 'Colorimetric detection of hydrogen peroxide and glucose by exploiting the peroxidase-like activity of papain.']"""

Analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0828""","""Purpose:   Missing data are a significant problem in clinical trials, particularly for quality of life (QOL), which cannot be obtained retrospectively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of an electronic web-based strategy for QOL data collection in a cooperative group radiation oncology trial setting.  Methods and materials:   Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0828 was a prospective National Cancer Institute cooperative group companion study of RTOG-0415, a randomized study of conventional versus hypofractionated radiation. Forty-nine English-speaking patients with favorable risk prostate cancer who enrolled on RTOG-0415 consented to using web-based technology for completing QOL. In RTOG-0415, using paper forms, the 6-month QOL compliance rate was 52%. The purpose of RTOG-0828 was to test the feasibility of a web-based strategy with the goal of increasing the 6-month QOL completion rate by 25% (from 52% to 77%) for a relative improvement of ~50%. The web-based tool used in this study was VisionTree Optimal Care (VTOC; VisionTree Software, Inc, San Diego, CA), a Health-Insurance-Portability-Accountability-Act secure, online technology that allows real-time tracking and e-mail reminders. The primary endpoint was the 6-month compliance rate for the validated QOL instrument, Expanded Prostate Index Composite.  Results:   The QOL completion rate at baseline was 98%. Compared with the prior 52% QOL completion rate at 6 months using paper forms, the QOL web-based completion rate at 6 months was 90% (2-sided P value < .001). At 12 months, the EPIC completion rate was 82% (compared with 36% using paper forms).  Conclusions:   This RTOG study suggests that a web-based strategy to collect QOL appears to be feasible in the cooperative group radiation oncology trial setting and is associated with an increase in the 6-month QOL compliance rate compared with the prior method of using paper forms. The RTOG plans to further test this strategy in a head-and-neck cancer trial across all participating RTOG sites.""","""['Benjamin Movsas', 'Daniel Hunt', 'Deborah Watkins-Bruner', 'W Robert Lee', 'Heather Tharpe', 'Desiree Goldstein', 'Joan Moore', 'Ian S Dayes', 'Sara Parise', 'Howard Sandler']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Intrarectal amifostine during external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer produces significant improvements in Quality of Life measured by EPIC score.', 'Long-Term Patient-Reported Outcomes From a Phase 3 Randomized Prospective Trial of Conventional Versus Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Utilizing Digital Health to Collect Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer: Single-Arm Pilot Trial.', 'Acute and Late Adverse Events Associated With Radical Radiation Therapy Prostate Cancer Treatment: A Systematic Review of Clinician and Patient Toxicity Reporting in Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'RTOG GU Radiation oncology specialists reach consensus on pelvic lymph node volumes for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Comparative validity and reliability of the WeChat-based electronic and paper-and-pencil versions of the PISQ-12 for collecting participant-reported data in Chinese.', 'Characteristics of Participation in Patient-Reported Outcomes and Electronic Data Capture Components of NRG Oncology Clinical Trials.', 'Clinical Outcome Assessments Toolbox for Radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Telemedicine and prostate cancer survivorship: a narrative review.', 'eRAPID electronic patient self-Reporting of Adverse-events: Patient Information and aDvice: a pilot study protocol in pelvic radiotherapy.']"""
