Here, we integrate a microfluidic coculture platform with multi-photon imaging based techniques to assess both phenotypic cell behavior and FAD fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime in the same cell. This platform combines two independent assays normally performed with two different cell populations into a single device, allowing us to simultaneously assess both phenotypic cell behavior and enzyme activity. We observed that the osteotropic prostate cancer cell line (C4-2B), when in a coculture with bone marrow stromal cells (MC3T3-E1), has increased protrusive phenotype and increased total and protein-bound FAD compared to its parent cell line (LNCaP). We hypothesized that an increase in ROS-generating APAO activity may be responsible for these effects, and found that the effects were decreased in the presence of the antioxidant N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC). This suggests that an ROS-related signaling mechanism at the bone metastatic site may be correlated with and play a role in increased invasion of metastasizing prostate cancer cells. The studies performed using this combined platform will lead to new insights into the mechanisms that drive prostate cancer metastasis.""","""['Lauren L Bischel#', 'Benjamin P Casavant#', 'Pamela A Young', 'Kevin W Eliceiri', 'Hirak S Basu', 'David J Beebe']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Integr Biol (Camb)""","""['Multiphoton FLIM imaging of NAD(P)H and FAD with one excitation wavelength.', 'Loss of let-7 microRNA upregulates IL-6 in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells triggering a reactive stromal response to prostate cancer.', 'Investigation of Mitochondrial Metabolic Response to Doxorubicin in Prostate Cancer Cells: An NADH, FAD and Tryptophan FLIM Assay.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Reactive oxygen species regulate hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, migration and development, as well as their bone marrow microenvironment.', 'Bone/cartilage organoid on-chip: Construction strategy and application.', 'Bone-on-a-chip: microfluidic technologies and microphysiologic models of bone tissue.', 'A metastasis-on-a-chip approach to explore the sympathetic modulation of breast cancer bone metastasis.', 'Modeling the Tumor Microenvironment and Pathogenic Signaling in Bone Sarcoma.', 'Review of 3D Cell Culture with Analysis in Microfluidic Systems.']"""

Mounting evidence indicates that ErbB4, unlike EGFR or ErbB2, functions as a tumor suppressor in many human malignancies. Previous analyses of the constitutively-dimerized and -active ErbB4 Q646C mutant indicate that ErbB4 kinase activity and phosphorylation of ErbB4 Tyr1056 are both required for the tumor suppressor activity of this mutant in human breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer cell lines. However, the cytoplasmic region of ErbB4 possesses additional putative functional motifs, and the contributions of these functional motifs to ErbB4 tumor suppressor activity have been largely underexplored. Here we demonstrate that ErbB4 BH3 and LXXLL motifs, which are thought to mediate interactions with Bcl family proteins and steroid hormone receptors, respectively, are required for the tumor suppressor activity of the ErbB4 Q646C mutant. Furthermore, abrogation of the site of ErbB4 cleavage by gamma-secretase also disrupts the tumor suppressor activity of the ErbB4 Q646C mutant. This last result suggests that ErbB4 cleavage and subcellular trafficking of the ErbB4 cytoplasmic domain may be required for the tumor suppressor activity of the ErbB4 Q646C mutant. Indeed, here we demonstrate that mutants that disrupt ErbB4 kinase activity, ErbB4 phosphorylation at Tyr1056, or ErbB4 cleavage by gamma-secretase also disrupt ErbB4 trafficking away from the plasma membrane and to the cytoplasm. This supports a model for ErbB4 function in which ErbB4 tumor suppressor activity is dependent on ErbB4 trafficking away from the plasma membrane and to the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and/or the nucleus.""","""['Richard M Gallo', 'Ianthe N Bryant', 'Christopher P Mill', 'Steven Kaverman', 'David J Riese nd']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther Oncol""","""['Ligand stimulation of ErbB4 and a constitutively-active ErbB4 mutant result in different biological responses in human pancreatic tumor cell lines.', 'Phosphorylation of ErbB4 on Tyr1056 is critical for inhibition of colony formation by prostate tumor cell lines.', 'Constitutively active ErbB4 and ErbB2 mutants exhibit distinct biological activities.', 'The Yin and Yang of ERBB4: Tumor Suppressor and Oncoprotein.', 'ErbB Receptors and Cancer.', 'Fatty acid synthase affects expression of ErbB receptors in epithelial to mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells and invasive ductal carcinoma.']"""

We investigated the prospective associations between vitamin D status and the total and specific type of cancer in three cohorts from the general Danish population.  Methods:   A total of 12,204 individuals 18 to 71 years old were included. The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured at baseline, and information about cancer was obtained from the Danish Cancer Registry.  Results:   During the 11.3-year median follow-up time, there were 1,248 incident cancers. HRs [95% confidence intervals (CI)] per 10 nmol/L higher baseline vitamin D level were: for all cancers (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.04), all cancers excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, NMSC (HR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.03), head and neck cancer (HR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84-1.12), colorectal cancer (HR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.88-1.02), cancer of bronchus and lung (HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.05), breast cancer (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.09), cancer of the uterus (HR = 1.10; 95% CI, 0.95-1.27), prostate cancer (HR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.93-1.08), cancer of the urinary organs (HR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90-1.14), NMSC (HR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), and malignant melanoma (HR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95-1.17).

Methods:   The PORPUS was adapted into Spanish using forward and back translations and cognitive debriefing. PORPUS was administered jointly with the SF-36 and the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) to 480 Spanish prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. The Spanish PORPUS scores' distribution and reliability were examined and compared with the original instrument. To evaluate construct validity, relationships were assessed between PORPUS and other instruments (testing hypotheses of the original PORPUS study), and among known groups defined by side effect severity.  Results:   Reliability coefficient was 0.76 (similar to the original PORPUS' 0.81). Spanish PORPUS items presented correlations ranging 0.57-0.88 with the corresponding EPIC domains, as in the original PORPUS study (0.60-0.83). Both PORPUS-P and PORPUS-U showed significant differences and large effect sizes (0.94-1.90) when comparing severe versus no problem groups on urinary, bowel, sexual and hormonal side effects defined by EPIC.

Method:   Self-reports of anxiety and depression on standardized scales of GAD and major depressive disorder (MDD) were collected from 156 PCa patients across two recruitment sites in Australia. Patients who were currently receiving HT were compared with patients not receiving HT for their severity and symptom profiles on GAD and MDD.  Results:   Participants receiving HT had significantly higher GAD and MDD total scores than patients who were not receiving HT. In addition, the symptom profiles of these two HT subgroups were differentiated by significantly higher scores on the key criteria for GAD and MDD plus fatigue and sleeping difficulties but not the remaining symptoms of GAD and MDD. However, there were no significant differences between HT subgroups for the degree of functional impairment experienced by these symptoms.  Conclusion:   Although these data confirm the association between HT and anxiety/depression, the range of GAD and MDD symptoms influenced is relatively restricted. Moreover, functional ability does not appear to be impaired by HT. These findings clarify the ways in which HT affects PCa patients and suggests that a simple total scale score for anxiety and depression may not be as helpful in designing treatment as consideration of the symptomatic profiles of PCa patients receiving HT.""","""['Christopher F Sharpley', 'Vicki Bitsika', 'Addie C Wootten', 'David R H Christie']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Fatigue in female patients with major depression: the effect of comorbid anxiety disorders.', 'Assessing remission in major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder clinical trials with the discan metric of the Sheehan disability scale.', 'Impact of escitalopram treatment on Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire scores in major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.', 'Difficulties in the diagnosis and treatment of major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety symptoms.', 'The importance of anxiety in both major depression and bipolar disorder.', 'Systematic review of sleep and sleep disorders among prostate cancer patients and caregivers: a call to action for using validated sleep assessments during prostate cancer care.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and distress: - a cross-sectional nationwide survey in men with prostate cancer in Sweden.', 'Cognitive Impacts of Estrogen Treatment in Androgen-Deprived Males: What Needs to be Resolved.', 'Art therapy based on appreciation of famous paintings and its effect on distress among cancer patients.', 'Association of Androgen Deprivation Therapy With Depression in Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Cediranib and dasatinib are multi-kinase inhibitors targeting VEGFR and Src respectively. Phase II studies of cediranib and dasatinib in CRPC have shown single agent activity.  Methods:   Docetaxel-pretreated CRPC patients were randomized to arm A: cediranib alone (20 mg/day) versus arm B: cediranib (20 mg/day) plus dasatinib (100 mg/day) given orally on 4-week cycles. Primary endpoint was 12-week progression-free survival (PFS) as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2). Patient reported outcomes were evaluated using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and Present Pain Intensity (PPI) scales. Correlative studies of bone turnover markers (BTM), including bone alkaline phosphate (BAP) and serum beta-C telopeptide (B-CTx) were serially assayed. Results A total of 22 patients, 11 per arm, were enrolled. Baseline demographics were similar in both arms. Median number of cycles =4 in arm A (range 1-12) and 2 in arm B (range 1-9). Twelve-week PFS was 73 % in arm A versus 18 % in arm B (p = 0.03). Median PFS in months (arm A versus B) was: 5.2 versus 2.6 (95 % CI: 1.9-6.5 versus 1.4-not reached). Most common grade 3 toxicities were hypertension, anemia and thrombocytopenia in arm A and hypertension, diarrhea and fatigue in arm B. One treatment-related death (retroperitoneal hemorrhage) was seen in arm A. FACT-P and PPI scores did not significantly change in either arm. No correlation between BTM and PFS was seen in either arm.  Conclusions:   Although limited by small numbers, this randomized study showed that the combination of VEGFR and Src targeted therapy did not result in improved efficacy and may be associated with a worse outcome than VEGFR targeted therapy alone in patients with CRPC.

The vicious cycle of bone degradation and formation driven by metastatic prostate cells in bone yields factors that drive cancer growth. Mechanistic insights into this vicious cycle have suggested new therapeutic opportunities, but complex temporal and cellular interactions in the bone microenvironment make drug development challenging. We have integrated biologic and computational approaches to generate a hybrid cellular automata model of normal bone matrix homeostasis and the prostate cancer-bone microenvironment. The model accurately reproduces the basic multicellular unit bone coupling process, such that introduction of a single prostate cancer cell yields a vicious cycle similar in cellular composition and pathophysiology to models of prostate-to-bone metastasis. Notably, the model revealed distinct phases of osteolytic and osteogenic activity, a critical role for mesenchymal stromal cells in osteogenesis, and temporal changes in cellular composition. To evaluate the robustness of the model, we assessed the effect of established bisphosphonate and anti-RANKL therapies on bone metastases. At approximately 100% efficacy, bisphosphonates inhibited cancer progression while, in contrast with clinical observations in humans, anti-RANKL therapy fully eradicated metastases. Reducing anti-RANKL yielded clinically similar results, suggesting that better targeting or dosing could improve patient survival.

Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) is a member of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family and is activated by collagen binding. This study aimed to investigate the function and detailed mechanism of DDR2 in prostate cancer bone dissemination. Herein we found that DDR2 was strongly expressed in bone-metastatic prostate cancer cells and tissues compared to that in normal controls. Enhanced expression of constitutively activated DDR2 led to elevation in motility and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells, whereas knockdown of DDR2 through specific shRNA caused a dramatic repression. Knockdown of DDR2 in prostate cancer cells resulted in significant decrease in the proliferation, differentiation and function of osteoblast. Over-expression of DDR2 in prostate cancer cells resulted in notable acceleration of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, whereas knockdown of DDR2 exhibited the opposite effects. An intrabone injection bone metastasis animal model demonstrated that DDR2 promoted osteolytic metastasis in vivo. Molecular evidence demonstrated that DDR2 regulated the expression, secretion, and promoter activity of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), via modulating Runx2 phosphorylation and transactivity. DDR2 was responsive to TGF-β and involved in TGF-β-mediated osteoclast activation and bone resorption. In addition, DDR2 facilitated prostate cancer cells adhere to type I collagen. This study reveals for the first time that DDR2 plays an essential role in prostate cancer bone metastasis.

ITCH is a HECT domain-containing E3 ligase that promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of several proteins, including p73, p63, c-Jun, JunB, Notch and c-FLIP, thus affecting cell fate. Accordingly, ITCH depletion potentiates the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs, revealing ITCH as a potential pharmacological target in cancer therapy. Using high throughput screening of ITCH auto-ubiquitylation, we identified several putative ITCH inhibitors, one of which is clomipramine--a clinically useful antidepressant drug. Previously, we have shown that clomipramine inhibits autophagy by blocking autophagolysosomal fluxes and thus could potentiate chemotherapy in vitro. Here, we found that clomipramine specifically blocks ITCH auto-ubiquitylation, as well as p73 ubiquitylation. By screening structural homologs of clomipramine, we identified several ITCH inhibitors and putative molecular moieties that are essential for ITCH inhibition. Treating a panel of breast, prostate and bladder cancer cell lines with clomipramine, or its homologs, we found that they reduce cancer cell growth, and synergize with gemcitabine or mitomycin in killing cancer cells by blocking autophagy.

Here, we test the hypothesis whether melatonin in the nanomolar range is effective in exerting antitumour activity in vivo and examine the correlation with the hypoxia signalling mechanism, which may be a major molecular mechanism by which melatonin antagonizes cancer. To test this hypothesis, LNCaP human prostate cancer cells were xenografted into seven-wk-old Foxn1nu/nu male mice that were treated with melatonin (18 i.p. injections of 1 mg/kg in 41 days). Saline-treated mice served as control. We found that the melatonin levels in plasma and xenografted tissue were 4× and 60× higher, respectively, than in control samples. Melatonin tended to restore the redox imbalance by increasing expression of Nrf2. As part of the phenotypic response to these perturbations, xenograft microvessel density was less in melatonin-treated animals, indicative of lower angiogenesis, and the xenograft growth rate was slower (P < 0.0001). These changes were accompanied by a reduced expression of Ki67, elevated expression of HIF-1α and increased phosphorylation of Akt in melatonin than saline-treated mice. We conclude that the beneficial effect of melatonin in reducing cancer growth in vivo was evident at melatonin plasma levels as low as 4 nm and was associated with decreased angiogenesis. Higher HIF-1α expression in xenograft tissue indicates that the antitumour effect cannot be due to a postulated antihypoxic effect, but may stem from lower angiogenesis potential.""","""['Rita Paroni', 'Laura Terraneo', 'Francesca Bonomini', 'Elena Finati', 'Eleonora Virgili', 'Paola Bianciardi', 'Gaia Favero', 'Franco Fraschini', 'Russel J Reiter', 'Rita Rezzani', 'Michele Samaja']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Pineal Res""","""['In vivo hyperoxia induces hypoxia-inducible factor-1α overexpression in LNCaP tumors without affecting the tumor growth rate.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, P276-00, inhibits HIF-1α and induces G2/M arrest under hypoxia in prostate cancer cells.', 'Chronic systemic hypoxia promotes LNCaP prostate cancer growth in vivo.', 'Ellagitannin-rich pomegranate extract inhibits angiogenesis in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'Suppression of LNCaP prostate cancer xenograft tumors by a prostate-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase, prostatic acid phosphatase.', 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'The Oxygen Cascade from Atmosphere to Mitochondria as a Tool to Understand the (Mal)adaptation to Hypoxia.', 'Melatonin decreases androgen-sensitive prostate cancer growth by suppressing SENP1 expression.', 'Melatonin is a potential oncostatic agent to inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation through multiple pathways.', 'Melatonin-A New Prospect in Prostate and Breast Cancer Management.']"""

However, the relationship between these two phenotypes is still not well understood. Here we sought to identify shared genetic loci between PCA and CVD risk factors.  Methods:   We applied a genetic epidemiology method based on conjunction false discovery rate (FDR) that combines summary statistics from different genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and allows identification of genetic overlap between two phenotypes. We evaluated summary statistics from large, multi-centre GWA studies of PCA (n=50 000) and CVD risk factors (n=200 000) [triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, waist-hip ratio and type 2 diabetes (T2D)]. Enrichment of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PCA and CVD risk factors was assessed with conditional quantile-quantile plots and the Anderson-Darling test. Moreover, we pinpointed shared loci using conjunction FDR.  Results:   We found the strongest enrichment of P-values in PCA was conditional on LDL and conditional on TG. In contrast, we found only weak enrichment conditional on HDL or conditional on the other traits investigated. Conjunction FDR identified altogether 17 loci; 10 loci were associated with PCA and LDL, 3 loci were associated with PCA and TG and additionally 4 loci were associated with PCA, LDL and TG jointly (conjunction FDR <0.01). For T2D, we detected one locus adjacent to HNF1B.  Conclusions:   We found polygenic overlap between PCA predisposition and blood lipids, in particular LDL and TG, and identified 17 pleiotropic gene loci between PCA and LDL, and PCA and TG, respectively.

Methods:   Different isomers of the β-amino-carbonyl compounds were obtained by chiral separation. The bioactivities of the isomers were evaluated by AR nuclear translocation, mammalian two-hybrid, competitive receptor binding and cell proliferation assays. The expression of genes downstream of AR was analyzed with real-time PCR. The therapeutic effects on tumor growth in vivo were observed in male SCID mice bearing LNCaP xenografts.  Results:   Compound 21 was previously identified as an AR modulator by the high-throughput screening of a diverse compound library. In the present study, the two isomers of compound 21, termed compounds 21-1 and 21-2, were characterized as partial AR agonists in terms of androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation, prostate-specific antigen expression and cell proliferation. Further structural modifications led to the discovery of a androgen receptor antagonist (compound 6012), which blocked androgen receptor nuclear translocation, androgen-responsive gene expression and androgen-dependent LNCaP cell proliferation. Four stereoisomers of compound 6012 were isolated, and their bioactivities were assessed. The pharmacological effects of 6012, including AR binding, androgen-induced AR translocation, NH2- and COOH-terminal interaction, growth inhibition of LNCaP cells in vitro and LNCaP xenograft growth in nude mice, were mainly restricted to isomer 6012-4 (1R, 3S).

Materials and methods:   A genome wide association study was performed in 1850 patients from the RAPPER study: 1217 received adjuvant breast radiotherapy and 633 had radical prostate radiotherapy. Genotype associations with both overall and individual endpoints of toxicity were tested via univariable and multivariable regression. Replication of potentially associated SNPs was carried out in three independent patient cohorts who had radiotherapy for prostate (516 RADIOGEN and 862 Gene-PARE) or breast (355 LeND) cancer.  Results:   Quantile-quantile plots show more associations at the P<5×10(-7) level than expected by chance (164 vs. 9 for the prostate cases and 29 vs. 4 for breast cases), providing evidence that common genetic variants are associated with risk of toxicity. Strongest associations were for individual endpoints rather than an overall measure of toxicity in all patients. However, in general, significant associations were not validated at a nominal 0.05 level in the replication cohorts.  Conclusions:   This largest GWAS to date provides evidence of true association between common genetic variants and toxicity. Associations with toxicity appeared to be tumour site-specific.

This study sought to determine the priorities, values and concerns of men who were 'fully informed' about the benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening; and empirically examine the value of a community jury in eliciting public values on PSA screening.  Setting:   Community jury was convened on the Gold Coast, Queensland (Australia) to consider PSA screening benefits and harms, and whether government campaigns on PSA screening should be conducted.  Participants:   27 men (volunteers) aged 50-70 with no personal history of prostate cancer and willing to attend jury 6-7 April 2013: 12 were randomly allocated to jury (11 attended).  Outcome measures:   A qualitative analysis was conducted of the jury deliberations (audio-recorded and transcribed) to elicit the jury's views and recommendations. A survey determined the impact of the jury process on participants' individual testing decisions compared with control group.  Results:   The jury concluded governments should not invest in programmes focused on PSA screening directed at the public because the PSA test did not offer sufficient reassurance or benefit and could raise unnecessary alarm. It recommended an alternative programme to support general practitioners to provide patients with better quality and more consistent information about PSA screening. After the jury, participants were less likely to be tested in the future compared with the controls, but around half said they would still consider doing so.  Conclusions:   The jury's unanimous verdict about government programmes was notable in the light of their divergent views on whether or not they would be screened themselves in the future. Community juries provide valuable insights into the priorities and concerns of men weighing up the benefits and harms of PSA screening.

However, these promoters are androgen dependent, and after castration or androgen ablation therapy, they become much less active or sometimes inactive. Importantly, the disease will inevitably progress from androgen-dependent (ADPC) to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), at which treatments fail and high mortality ensues. Therefore, it is critical to develop a targeted gene therapy strategy that is effective in both ADPC and CRPC to eradicate recurrent prostate tumors. The human telomerase reverse transcriptase-VP16-Gal4-WPRE integrated systemic amplifier composite (T-VISA) vector we previously developed, which targets transgene expression in ovarian and breast cancer, is also active in prostate cancer. To further improve its effectiveness based on androgen response in ADPC progression, the ARR2 element (two copies of androgen response region from rat probasin promoter) was incorporated into T-VISA to produce AT-VISA. Under androgen analog (R1881) stimulation, the activity of AT-VISA was increased to a level greater than or comparable to the cytomegalovirus promoter in ADPC and CRPC cells, respectively. Importantly, AT-VISA demonstrated little or no expression in normal cells. Systemic administration of AT-VISA-BikDD encapsulated in liposomes repressed prostate tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival in orthotopic animal models as well as in the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate model, indicating that AT-VISA-BikDD has therapeutic potential to treat ADPC and CRPC safely and effectively in preclinical setting.""","""['Xiaoming Xie', 'Yanan Kong', 'Hailin Tang', 'Lu Yang', 'Jennifer L Hsu', 'Mien-Chie Hung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Targeted expression of BikDD eliminates breast cancer with virtually no toxicity in noninvasive imaging models.', 'Targeted expression of BikDD combined with metronomic doxorubicin induces synergistic antitumor effect through Bax activation in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Correlation between the expression of Pim-1 and androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Drug discovery in advanced prostate cancer: translating biology into therapy.', 'Lipid-based nucleic acid therapeutics with in vivo efficacy.', 'Cell membrane breakage and triggering T cell infiltration are involved in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter-driven novel peptide KK-64 for liver cancer gene therapy.', 'Improvement of DNA Vector Delivery of DOTAP Lipoplexes by Short-Chain Aminolipids.', 'BIK ubiquitination by the E3 ligase Cul5-ASB11 determines cell fate during cellular stress.', 'Reducing off target viral delivery in ovarian cancer gene therapy using a protease-activated AAV2 vector platform.']"""

At a mean follow-up of 22.7 months, 116 patients (63%) recovered EF. Overall, EF recovery rates at 1- and 2- year follow-up were 47.3% and 65.4%, respectively. Overall, 43 (23.4%) patients used one or more PDE5-Is per week. Preoperative EF was the only predictor of the use of one or more PDE5-Is per week after BNSRP. This held true even after adjusting our analyses for age at surgery, body mass index and EF at 1 month after surgery. Particularly, patients fully potent before surgery had roughly 2.1-fold higher probability of using one or more pills per week compared with their counterparts with some degree of preoperative erectile dysfunction (ED; odds ratio: 2.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.03-4.37).

The recently introduced dynamic running-start-stop (RSS) delivery allows smaller jaw opening at the superior and inferior ends of the target when a sharp penumbra is needed. This study compared the dosimetric performance of RSS delivery with the fixed jaw HT delivery.  Methods:   Twenty patient cases were selected and deidentified prior to treatment planning, including 16 common clinical cases (brain, head and neck (HN), lung, and prostate) and four special cases of whole brain with hippocampus avoidance (WBHA) that require a high degree of dose modulation. HT plans were generated for common clinical cases using the fixed 2.5 cm jaw width (HT2.5) and WBHA cases using 1.0 cm (HT1.0). The jaw widths for RSS were preset with a larger size (RSS5.0 vs HT2.5 and RSS2.5 vs HT1.0). Both delivery techniques were planned based on identical contours, prescriptions, and planning objectives. Dose indices for targets and critical organs were compared using dose-volume histograms, BOT, and monitor units.  Results:   The average BOT was reduced from 4.8 min with HT2.5 to 2.5 min with RSS5.0. Target dose homogeneity with RSS5.0 was shown comparable to HT2.5 for common clinical sites. Superior normal tissue sparing was observed in RSS5.0 for optic nerves and optic chiasm in brain and HN cases. RSS5.0 demonstrated improved dose sparing for cord and esophagus in lung cases, as well as penile bulb in prostate cases. The mean body dose was comparable for both techniques. For the WBHA cases, the target homogeneity was significantly degraded in RSS2.5 without distinct dose sparing for hippocampus, compared to HT1.0.  Conclusions:   Compared to the fixed jaw HT delivery, RSS combined with a larger jaw width provides faster treatment delivery and improved cranial-caudal target dose conformity. The target coverage achieved by RSS with a large jaw width is comparable to the fixed jaw HT delivery for common cancer sites, but may deteriorate for cases where complex geometry is present in the middle part of the target.""","""['Yi Rong', 'Yu Chen', 'Lu Shang', 'Li Zuo', 'Weiguo Lu', 'Quan Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Helical tomotherapy versus single-arc intensity-modulated arc therapy: a collaborative dosimetric comparison between two institutions.', 'Investigation of pitch and jaw width to decrease delivery time of helical tomotherapy treatments for head and neck cancer.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Utility of VMAT: Aspect of Clinical Application.', 'Tomotherapy for cranio-spinal irradiation.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: clinical outcome and dosimetric comparison of Hi-ART vs. Radixact.', 'Dosimetric comparison between VMAT plans using the fast-rotating O-ring linac with dual-layer stacked MLC and helical tomotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy versus tomotherapy for late T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Investigation of absolute dose calibration accuracy for TomoTherapy using real water.', 'Comparison of Different Combinations of Irradiation Mode and Jaw Width in Helical Tomotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.']"""

I-RSBT is a promising technique for reducing urethra, rectum, and bladder dose relative to conventional interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT).  Methods:   A wire-mounted 62 GBq(153)Gd source is proposed with an encapsulated diameter of 0.59 mm, active diameter of 0.44 mm, and active length of 10 mm. A concept model I-RSBT needle/catheter pair was constructed using concentric 50 and 75 μm thick nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol) tubes. The needle is 16-gauge (1.651 mm) in outer diameter and the catheter contains a 535 μm thick platinum shield. I-RSBT and conventional HDR-BT treatment plans for a prostate cancer patient were generated based on Monte Carlo dose calculations. In order to minimize urethral dose, urethral dose gradient volumes within 0-5 mm of the urethra surface were allowed to receive doses less than the prescribed dose of 100%.  Results:   The platinum shield reduced the dose rate on the shielded side of the source at 1 cm off-axis to 6.4% of the dose rate on the unshielded side. For the case considered, for the same minimum dose to the hottest 98% of the clinical target volume (D(98%)), I-RSBT reduced urethral D(0.1cc) below that of conventional HDR-BT by 29%, 33%, 38%, and 44% for urethral dose gradient volumes within 0, 1, 3, and 5 mm of the urethra surface, respectively. Percentages are expressed relative to the prescription dose of 100%. For the case considered, for the same urethral dose gradient volumes, rectum D(1cc) was reduced by 7%, 6%, 6%, and 6%, respectively, and bladder D(1cc) was reduced by 4%, 5%, 5%, and 6%, respectively. Treatment time to deliver 20 Gy with I-RSBT was 154 min with ten 62 GBq (153)Gd sources.  Conclusions:   For the case considered, the proposed(153)Gd-based I-RSBT system has the potential to lower the urethral dose relative to HDR-BT by 29%-44% if the clinician allows a urethral dose gradient volume of 0-5 mm around the urethra to receive a dose below the prescription.

Methods:   Monte Carlo methodology was employed to model radiation therapy with typical anteroposterior and posteroanterior para-aortic fields on an anthropomorphic phantom simulating an average adult. The radiation dose received by all main and remaining organs that defined by the ICRP publication 103 and excluded from the treatment volume was calculated. The effect of field dimensions on each organ dose was determined. Additional therapy simulations were generated by introducing shielding blocks to protect the kidneys from primary radiation. The gonadal dose was employed to assess the risk of heritable effects for irradiated male patients of reproductive potential. The lifetime attributable risks (LAR) of radiotherapy-induced cancer were estimated using gender- and organ-specific risk coefficients for patient ages of 20, 30, 40, and 50 years old. The risk values were compared with the respective nominal risks.  Results:   Para-aortic irradiation to 20 Gy resulted in out-of-field organ doses of 5.0-538.6 mGy. Blocked field treatment led to a dose change up to 28%. The mean organ dose variation by increasing or decreasing the applied field dimensions was 18.7% ± 3.9% and 20.8% ± 4.5%, respectively.

Here an interpolation method is described enabling unrestricted seed placement while preserving the computational efficiency of the original method.  Methods:   The Iodine-125 seed dose kernel was sampled and selected values were modified to optimize interpolation accuracy for clinically relevant doses. For each seed, the kernel was shifted to the nearest grid point via convolution with a unit impulse, implemented in the Fourier domain. The remaining fractional shift was performed using a piecewise third-order Lagrange filter.  Results:   Implementation of the interpolation method greatly improved FT-based dose calculation accuracy. The dose distribution was accurate to within 2% beyond 3 mm from each seed. Isodose contours were indistinguishable from explicit TG-43 calculation. Dose-volume metric errors were negligible. Computation time for the FT interpolation method was essentially the same as Boyer's method.  Conclusions:   A FT interpolation method for permanent prostate brachytherapy TG-43 dose calculation was developed which expands upon Boyer's original method and enables unrestricted seed placement. The proposed method substantially improves the clinically relevant dose accuracy with negligible additional computation cost, preserving the efficiency of the original method.""","""['Derek Liu', 'Ron S Sloboda']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Prostate brachytherapy postimplant dosimetry: seed orientation and the impact of dosimetric anisotropy in stranded implants.', 'Comparison of seed loading approaches in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Quantifying the effect of seed orientation in postplanning dosimetry of low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Review of intraoperative imaging and planning techniques in permanent seed prostate brachytherapy.', 'Modified uniform seed loading for prostate brachytherapy: rationale, design, and evaluation.']"""

We also detected a low NTM1 reactive antibodies titer in healthy HIV negative sera and showed that antibody levels can be significantly increased with vigorous physical activity. However, the immune system seems to be unresponsive or tolerant to this peptide, implicating that the NTM1 sequence encompasses or overlaps a certain innate immune epitope. The aim of this study was to present evidences that NTM1 - binding antibodies - are components of innate immune humoral response, by confirming their presence in sera of newborn babies. For this purpose we collected a set of 225 innate antigen sequences reported in the literature and screened it for candidate antigens with the highest sequence and spectral similarity to NTM1 derived from HIV-1 gp120.  Methods:   Sera from 18 newborns were tested using ELISA, with peptide NTM1. Sequences from innate antigen database were aligned by an EMBOSS Water bioinformatics tool.  Results:   We identified NTM1 reactive antibodies in sera of HIV negative newborn babies. Further, in order to identify which of already known innate antigens are the most similar to NTM1 peptide we screened innate immune antigen sequence database collected from the literature. This screening revealed that the most similar sequence are ribonucleoproteins RO60, in addition to previously identified N-terminus of vasoactive intestinal peptide.  Conclusion:   The results of this study confirm the hypothesis that NTM1 recognizing antibodies are a part of humoral innate immune response. Further, computational similarity screening revealed a vasoactive intestinal peptide and RO60 as the most similar sequences and the strongest candidate antigens. In the light of the presented results, it is appealing that testing blood reactivity at birth, with specific innate antigens, particularly a vasoactive intestinal peptide, can reveal the potential to develop or boost protective immune response in breast and prostate cancer and HIV infection later in life.""","""['Ana Djordjević Vujicić', 'Branislava Gemović', 'Veljko Veljković', 'Sanja Glisić', 'Nevena Veljković']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Vojnosanit Pregl""","""['Natural autoantibodies cross-react with a peptide derived from the second conserved region of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120.', 'Aerobic exercise training as a potential source of natural antibodies protective against human immunodeficiency virus-1.', 'Binding of glycoprotein 120 and peptides from the HIV-1 envelope by autoantibodies in mice with experimentally induced systemic lupus erythematosus and in patients with the disease.', 'Peptides from the principal neutralizing and CD4-binding domain: similar immunoreactive properties and structure pattern.', 'Natural autoantibodies: the other side of the immune system.']"""

Because GWAS identify genetic markers that may be indirectly associated with disease, fine-mapping based on sequence analysis provides important insights into patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and is critical in defining the optimal variants to nominate for biological follow-up.  Methods:   To catalog variation in individuals of African ancestry, we resequenced a region (250 kb; chr8:128,050, 768–128, 300,801, hg19) containing several prostate cancer susceptibility loci as well as a locus associated with CLL.

Using genotypes derived from sequencing, we refined the LD and recombination hotspots within the region and determined a set of tag SNPs to be used in future fine-mapping studies. Based on LD, we annotated putative risk loci and their surrogates using ENCODE data, which should help guide laboratory studies.

Structure and composition of HS, generated by HS-biosynthetic system through non-template-driven process, are significantly altered in cancer tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of HS-metabolic machinery in prostate carcinogenesis. Transcriptional patterns of HS-metabolic enzymes (EXT1, EXT2, NDST1, NDST2, GLCE, 3OST1/HS3ST1, SULF1, SULF2, HPSE) were determined in normal, benign, and cancer human prostate tissues and cell lines (PNT2, LNCaP, PC3, DU145). Stability of the HS-metabolic system patterns under the pressure of external or internal stimuli was studied. Overall impairment of transcriptional activity of HS-metabolic machinery was detected in benign prostate hyperplasia, while both significant decrease in the transcriptional activity and changes in the expression patterns of HS metabolism-involved genes were observed in prostate tumors. Prostate cancer cell lines possessed specific transcriptional patterns of HS metabolism-involved genes; however, expression activity of the system was similar to that of normal prostate PNT2 cells. HS-metabolic system was able to dynamically react to different external or internal stimuli in a cell type-dependent manner. LNCaP cells were sensitive to the external stimuli (5-aza-deoxycytidin or Trichostatin A treatments; co-cultivation with human fibroblasts), whereas PC3 cells almost did not respond to the treatments. Ectopic GLCE over-expression resulted in transcriptional activation of HS-biosynthetic machinery in both cell lines, suggesting an existence of a self-regulating mechanism for the coordinated transcription of HS metabolism-involved genes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate impairment of HS-metabolic system in prostate tumors in vivo but not in prostate cancer cells in vitro, and suggest that as a potential microenvironmental biomarker for prostate cancer diagnostics and treatment.""","""['Anastasia V Suhovskih', 'Alexandra Y Tsidulko', 'Olesya S Kutsenko', 'Anna V Kovner', 'Svetlana V Aidagulova', 'Ingemar Ernberg', 'Elvira V Grigorieva']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Heparan Sulfate Biosynthetic System Is Inhibited in Human Glioma Due to EXT1/2 and HS6ST1/2 Down-Regulation.', 'Tissue-specificity of heparan sulfate biosynthetic machinery in cancer.', 'Proteoglycan expression correlates with the phenotype of malignant and non-malignant EBV-positive B-cell lines.', 'The heparanome--the enigma of encoding and decoding heparan sulfate sulfation.', 'Heparan Sulfate: Biosynthesis, Structure, and Function.', 'HS3ST1 Promotes Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Progression by Targeting the SPOP/FADD/NF-κB Pathway.', 'A heparan-sulfate-bearing syndecan-1 glycoform is a distinct surface marker for intra-tumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells.', 'Prognostic Value of a Ten-Gene Signature in HNSCC Patients Based on Tumor-Associated Macrophages Expression Profiling.', 'Prospective Evaluation of Chondroitin Sulfate, Heparan Sulfate and Hyaluronic Acid in Prostate Cancer.', 'Heparan Sulfate Biosynthetic System Is Inhibited in Human Glioma Due to EXT1/2 and HS6ST1/2 Down-Regulation.']"""

OH-LAAO demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against PC-3 cells with IC50 of 0.05 µg/mL after 72 h incubation in vitro. It induced apoptosis as evidenced with an increase in caspase-3/7 cleavages and an increase in annexin V-stained cells. To examine its in vivo anti-tumor activity, we treated PC-3 tumor xenograft implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient NU/NU (nude) mice with 1 µg/g OH-LAAO given intraperitoneally (i.p.). After 8 weeks of treatment, OH-LAAO treated PC-3 tumors were markedly inhibited, when compared to the control group (P <0.05). TUNEL staining analysis on the tumor sections showed a significantly increase of apoptotic cells in the LAAO-treated animals. Histological examinations of the vital organs in these two groups showed no significant differences with normal tissues, indicating no obvious tissue damage. The treatment also did not cause any significant changes on the body weight of the mice during the duration of the study.

First, bone metastases are common in many solid tumours, notably those arising from the breast, prostate and lung, as well as multiple myeloma, and may cause major morbidity including fractures, severe pain, nerve compression and hypercalcaemia. Through optimum multidisciplinary management of patients with bone metastases, including the use of bone-targeted treatments such as potent bisphosphonates or denosumab, it has been possible to transform the course of advanced cancer for many patients resulting in a major reduction in skeletal complications, reduced bone pain and improved quality of life. Secondly, many of the treatments we use to treat cancer patients have effects on reproductive hormones, which are critical for the maintenance of normal bone remodelling. This endocrine disturbance results in accelerated bone loss and an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures that can have a significant negative impact on the lives of the rapidly expanding number of long-term cancer survivors. Finally, the bone marrow micro-environment is also intimately involved in the metastatic processes required for cancer dissemination, and there are emerging data showing that, at least in some clinical situations, the use of bone-targeted treatments can reduce metastasis to bone and has potential impact on patient survival.""","""['R Coleman', 'J J Body', 'M Aapro', 'P Hadji', 'J Herrstedt;ESMO Guidelines Working Group']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['Impact of Bone-Targeted Treatments on Skeletal Morbidity and Survival in Breast Cancer.', 'Bone sarcomas: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.', 'Bisphosphonates for breast cancer.', 'SEOM Clinical Guideline for bone metastases from solid tumours (2016).', 'Understanding treatments for bone loss and bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer: a practical review and guide for the clinician.', 'Quantitative ultrasound of the calcaneus (QUS): A valuable tool in the identification of patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer requiring screening for osteoporosis.', 'A Comprehensive Review of Interventional Clinical Trials in Patients with Bone Metastases.', 'A novel multifunctional radioprotective strategy using P7C3 as a countermeasure against ionizing radiation-induced bone loss.', 'How has the field of metastatic breast cancer in bones evolved over the past 22 years?', 'Efficacy and safety of CT-guided 125I seed implantation by coplanar template as a salvage therapy for vertebral metastases after failure of external beam radiation therapy: a retrospective study.']"""

In the present study, fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to isolate PCSCs from LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide was used to measure the cell viability.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to explore the detailed mechanism underlying ABCC1 expression. Our results revealed that the sorted PCSCs showed enhanced chemoresistance ability than matched non-PCSCs. Protein level of activated form of NOTCH1(ICN1) was significantly higher in PCSCs. Inhibition of NOTCH1 with shRNA could decrease ABCC1 expression, and improve chemosensitivity in PCSCs. Finally, ChIP-PCR showed ICN1 could directly bind to the promoter region of ABCC1.

Results:   There was high reliability between CPET for V˙O2peak (r = 0.92; P < 0.001; ICC, 0.900), ventilatory threshold (r = 0.88; P < 0.001; ICC, 0.927), minute ventilation-carbon dioxide production relation (V˙E/V˙CO2) (r = 0.86; P < 0.001; ICC, 0.850), and peak heart rate (r = 0.95; P < 0.001; ICC, 0.944). However, high within-subject variability was observed for all CPET parameters (mean coefficient of variation, 4.7%). Compared with those for test 1, significantly higher mean values were observed for V˙O2peak (27.0 ± 5.6 vs 28.1 ± 5.3 mL·kg·min, P < 0.05), ventilatory threshold (1.91 ± 0.5 vs 1.97 ± 0.4 L·min, P < 0.05), and V˙E/V˙CO2 (31.3 ± 5.8 vs 32.8 ± 3.4, P < 0.05) in test 2.  Conclusions:   These findings indicate the presence of significant, and potentially clinically important, variability in CPET procedures in men with clinically localized prostate cancer and have important implications for the application and use of CPET to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to improve aerobic capacity in the oncology setting.""","""['Jessica M Scott', 'Whitney E Hornsby', 'Amy Lane', 'Aarti A Kenjale', 'Neil D Eves', 'Lee W Jones']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Sci Sports Exerc""","""['Test-Retest Reliability of Maximal and Submaximal Gas Exchange Variables in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease.', 'Test-retest reliability and four-week changes in cardiopulmonary fitness in stroke patients: evaluation using a robotics-assisted tilt table.', 'Cardiopulmonary exercise testing early after stroke using feedback-controlled robotics-assisted treadmill exercise: test-retest reliability and repeatability.', 'Cardiopulmonary exercise testing in the functional and prognostic evaluation of patients with pulmonary diseases.', 'Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test Parameters in Athletic Population: A Review.', 'Effects and tolerability of exercise therapy modality on cardiorespiratory fitness in lung cancer: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Effects of supervised aerobic exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness and patient-reported health outcomes in colorectal cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy-a pilot study.', 'The Siconolfi step test: a valid and reliable assessment of cardiopulmonary fitness in older men with prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy of Exercise Therapy on Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Patients With Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Physiological Effort in Submaximal Fitness Tests Predicts Weight Loss in Overweight and Obese Men with Prostate Cancer in a Weight Loss Trial.']"""

Here, the role of the mitochondrial protein voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1), a master gatekeeper regulating the flux of metabolites and ions between mitochondria and the cytoplasm, in regulating the growth of several cancer cell lines was investigated by silencing VDAC1 expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA). A single siRNA specific to the human VDAC1 sequence at nanomolar concentrations led to some 90% decrease in VDAC1 levels in the lung A549 and H358, prostate PC-3, colon HCT116, glioblastoma U87, liver HepG2, and pancreas Panc-1 cancer cell lines. VDAC1 silencing persisted 144 hours post-transfection and resulted in profound inhibition of cell growth in cancer but not in noncancerous cells, with up to 90% inhibition being observed over 5 days that was prolonged by a second transfection. Cells expressing low VDAC1 levels showed decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and adenoside triphosphate (ATP) levels, suggesting limited metabolite exchange between mitochondria and cytosol. Moreover, cells silenced for VDAC1 expression showed decreased migration, even in the presence of the wound healing accelerator basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). VDAC1-siRNA inhibited cancer cell growth in a Matrigel-based assay in host nude mice. Finally, in a xenograft lung cancer mouse model, chemically modified VDAC1-siRNA not only inhibited tumor growth but also resulted in tumor regression. This study thus shows that VDAC1 silencing by means of RNA interference (RNAi) dramatically inhibits cancer cell growth and tumor development by disabling the abnormal metabolic behavior of cancer cells, potentially paving the way for a more effective pipeline of anticancer drugs.""","""['Tasleem Arif', 'Lilia Vasilkovsky', 'Yael Refaely', 'Alexander Konson', 'Varda Shoshan-Barmatz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Ther Nucleic Acids""","""['Silencing VDAC1 Expression by siRNA Inhibits Cancer Cell Proliferation and Tumor Growth In\xa0Vivo.', 'VDAC1 is a molecular target in glioblastoma, with its depletion leading to reprogrammed metabolism and reversed oncogenic properties.', 'The mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in tumor cells.', 'Downregulation of voltage-dependent anion channel-1 expression by RNA interference prevents cancer cell growth in vivo.', 'Metabolic Reprograming Via Silencing of Mitochondrial VDAC1 Expression Encourages Differentiation of Cancer Cells.', 'Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 As an Emerging Drug Target for Novel Anti-Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 Expression in Oral Malignant and Premalignant Lesions.', 'Apoptotic proteins with non-apoptotic activity: expression and function in cancer.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'Pro-Apoptotic and Anti-Cancer Activity of the Vernonanthura Nudiflora Hydroethanolic Extract.', 'MCU Upregulation Overactivates Mitophagy by Promoting VDAC1 Dimerization and Ubiquitination in the Hepatotoxicity of Cadmium.']"""

Despite this, being young as it applies to prostate cancer is not yet clearly defined with varied chronological approaches applied. However, men's responses to health crises are closely bound to life course and masculinities from which social roles emerge. This paper applied qualitative methodology (structured focus groups and semistructured interviews with expert informants) using interpretative phenomenological analysis to define what it means to be young and have prostate cancer. Structured focus groups were held with 26 consumer advisors (men diagnosed with prostate cancer who provide support to other men with prostate cancer or raise community awareness) and health professionals. As well, 15 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and in their 40s, 50s, or 60s participated in semi-structured interviews. Participants discussed the attributes that describe a young man with prostate cancer and the experience of being young and diagnosed with prostate cancer. Chronological definitions of a young man were absent or inconsistent. Masculine constructions of what it means to be a young man and life course characteristics appear more relevant to defining young as it applies to prostate cancer compared with chronological age. These findings have implications for better understanding the morbidities associated with this illness, and in designing interventions that are oriented to life course and helping young men reconstruct their identities after prostate cancer.""","""['Suzanne K Chambers', 'Anthony Lowe', 'Melissa K Hyde', 'Leah Zajdlewicz', 'Robert A Gardiner', 'David Sandoe', 'Jeff Dunn']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['The Connections Between Work, Prostate Cancer Screening, Diagnosis, and the Decision to Undergo Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prostate cancer awareness, case-finding, and early diagnosis: Interviews with undiagnosed men in Australia.', ""Health help-seeking by men in Brunei Darussalam: masculinities and 'doing' male identities across the life course."", ""Men's Views on Depression: A Systematic Review and Metasynthesis of Qualitative Research."", 'A qualitative metasynthesis exploring the impact of prostate cancer and its management on younger, unpartnered and gay men.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'Using the Framework Method for the Analysis of Qualitative Dyadic Data in Health Research.', 'Body image, self-esteem, and sense of masculinity in patients with prostate cancer: a qualitative meta-synthesis.', 'Erectile dysfunction, masculinity, and psychosocial outcomes: a review of the experiences of men after prostate cancer treatment.', 'Trajectories of quality of life, life satisfaction, and psychological adjustment after prostate cancer.']"""

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the mechanistic action of PMA in prostate cancer cells with regard to AR. We showed that PMA decreased E2F1 as well as AR expression in androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells. Furthermore, PMA activated JNK and p53 signaling, resulting in the induction of cellular apoptosis. In LNCaP cells, androgen deprivation and a novel anti-androgen enzalutamide (MDV3100) augmented cellular apoptosis induced by PMA. Moreover, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) C4-2 cells were more sensitive to PMA compared with LNCaP cells and were sensitized to PMA by enzalutamide. Finally, the expression of PKC, E2F1, and AR was diminished in PMA-resistant cells, indicating that the gain of independence from PKC, E2F1, and AR functions leads to PMA resistance. In conclusion, PMA exerted its anti-cancer effects via the activation of pro-apoptotic JNK/p53 and inhibition of pro-proliferative E2F1/AR in prostate cancer cells including CRPC cells. The therapeutic effects of PMA were augmented by androgen deletion and enzalutamide in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, as well as by enzalutamide in castration-resistant cells.

Materials and methods:   Eighty-three patients had a FCH PET/CT at time of biochemical failure. Of 65 patients with positive findings, 33 had positive nodes. This analysis included 31 patients who had undergone prior prostate-only radiotherapy with or without a prior radical prostatectomy. Each FCH positive node was assigned to a lymph node station with respect to the CTV defined by the RTOG guidelines (CTVRTOG). 3D mapping was performed after each node was manually placed in a reference planning CT scan after automatic co-registration of the two scans based on bone anatomy. Eighteen patients (58%) underwent focal salvage FCH PET-guided stereotactic radiotherapy with no hormones.  Results:   Fourteen patients (45.2%) had a relapse outside the CTVRTOG. Of the 17 patients with a positive node inside the CTVRTOG, 15 had a single node (88.2%) while seven patients out of the 13 evaluable patients (53.9%) who had a relapse outside the CTVRTOG had ⩾2 positive nodes on FCH PET/CT (OR=8.75, [95% CI: 1.38-54.80], p=0.020).

In this study, we evaluated the potential of statine-based bombesin antagonists, conjugated to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) through oligoethyleneglycol spacers, labeled with (177)Lu and we determined the effect of polyethyleneglycol (PEG) spacer length on in vitro and in vivo properties.  Methods:   The bombesin antagonists were synthesized on solid phase using Fmoc chemistry; the spacers Fmoc-dPEGx-OH (x=2, 4, 6 and 12) and the DOTA(tBu)3 were coupled using a standard procedure. The peptides were labeled with (177)Lu and evaluated in vitro (lipophilicity, serum stability, internalization and binding affinity assays). Biodistribution studies were performed in PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice.  Results:   The solid-phase synthesis was straightforward with an overall yield ranging from 30% to 35% based on the first Fmoc cleavage. The hydrophilicity increased with spacer length (logD: -1.95 vs -2.22 of PEG2 and PEG12 analogs, respectively). There is a tendency of increased serum stability by increasing the spacer length (T1/2=246±4 and 584±20 for PEG2 and PEG6 analogs, respectively) which seems to reverse with the PEG12 analog. The IC50 values are similar with the only significant difference of the PEG12 analog. The (177)Lu-labeled PEG4 and PEG6 conjugates showed similar pharmacokinetic with high tumor uptake and excellent tumor-to-kidney ratios (7.8 and 9.7 at 4h for the PEG4 and PEG6 derivatives, respectively). The pancreas uptake was relatively high at 1h but it shows fast washout (0.46%±0.02% IA/g and 0.29%±0.08% IA/g already at 4h).  Conclusion:   Among all the studied analogs the PEG4 and PEG6 showed significantly better properties.

Results:   With 100 mg/d AA, mean predose androstenedione fell from 764 to 254 ng/dL (26.7-8.9 nmol/L). At 250 mg/d AA, mean androstenedione normalized in five participants (83%) and decreased from 664 to 126 ng/dL (23.2-4.4 nmol/L), meeting the primary end point. Mean androstenedione declined further during day 6 to 66 and 38 ng/dL (2.3 and 1.3 nmol/L) at 100 and 250 mg/d, respectively. Serum T and urinary metabolites declined similarly. Abiraterone exposure was strongly negatively correlated with mean androstenedione. Hypertension and hypokalemia were not observed.

To achieve this, mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells were isolated and cocultured to form a vascularized bone analogue. Endothelial cells were found to exert osteopotentiating effects on mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, and reciprocal effects by the stromal cells were found to stimulate vasculogenic responses, suggesting the possible utility of this system to elicit three-way interactions between endothelial, mesenchymal, and prostate cancer cells. We further developed the use of fluorescently labeled cells which could be used to concurrently track cellular migration, proliferation, and morphometric analysis. We demonstrate the concurrent, real-time visualization of prostate cancer and endothelial cells, which may be useful for evaluation of spatiotemporal changes at a single-cell level.

In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) a gene expression classification has described different subgroups including a luminal androgen subtype. The AR can be controlled by several mechanisms like the activation of membrane tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling pathways. However little is known in TNBC about how the AR is modulated by these mechanisms and the potential therapeutic strategists to inhibit its expression.  Methods:   We used human samples to evaluate the expression of AR by western-blot and phospho-proteomic kinase arrays that recognize membrane tyrosine kinase receptors and downstream mediators. Western-blots in human cell lines were carried out to analyze the expression and activation of individual proteins. Drugs against these kinases in different conditions were used to measure the expression of the androgen receptor. PCR experiments were performed to assess changes in the AR gene after therapeutic modulation of these pathways.  Results:   AR is present in a subset of TNBC and its expression correlates with activated membrane receptor kinases-EGFR and PDGFRβ in human samples and cell lines. Inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in TNBC cell lines decreased notably the expression of the AR. Concomitant administration of the anti-androgen bicalutamide with the EGFR, PDGFRβ and Erk1/2 inhibitors, decreased the amount of AR compared to each agent given alone, and had an additive anti-proliferative effect. Administration of dihydrotestosterone augmented the expression of AR that was not modified by the inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR or Erk1/2 pathways. AR expression was posttranscriptionally regulated by PI3K or Erk1/2 inhibition.  Conclusion:   Our results describe the expression of the AR in TNBC as a druggable target and further suggest the combination of bicalutamide with inhibitors of EGFR, PDGFRβ or Erk1/2 for future development.""","""['María D Cuenca-López', 'Juan C Montero', 'Jorge C Morales', 'Aleix Prat', 'Atanasio Pandiella', 'Alberto Ocana']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['PIK3CA mutations in androgen receptor-positive triple negative breast cancer confer sensitivity to the combination of PI3K and androgen receptor inhibitors.', 'Response to mTOR and PI3K inhibitors in enzalutamide-resistant luminal androgen receptor triple-negative breast cancer patient-derived xenografts.', 'Antiproliferative Effect of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Mesenchymal Stem-Like Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Biology in Triple Negative Breast Cancer: a Case for Classification as AR+ or Quadruple Negative Disease.', 'Role of the androgen receptor in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Diverse role of androgen action in human breast cancer.', 'Potential Therapeutic Targets for Luminal Androgen Receptor Breast Cancer: What We Know so Far.', 'Anti-Androgenic Therapies Targeting the Luminal Androgen Receptor of a Typical Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Modulating the Activity of Androgen Receptor for Treating Breast Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor as an Emerging Feasible Biomarker for Breast Cancer.']"""

Still, the addition of molecular targeting to the treatment regime has not led to a curative breakthrough. Combined mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has been shown not only to enhance anti-tumour potential, but also to prevent resistance development seen under mono-drug therapy. This investigation was designed to evaluate whether cross-communication exists between mTOR signalling and epigenetic events regulated by HDAC. DU-145 prostate cancer cells were treated with insulin-like growth factor (IGF) to activate the Akt-mTOR cascade or with the HDAC-inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) to induce histone H3 and H4 acetylation (aH3, aH4). Subsequently, mTOR, Rictor, Raptor, p70s6k, Akt (all: total and phosphorylated), H3 and H4 (total and acetylated) were analysed by western blotting. Both techniques revealed a link between mTOR and the epigenetic machinery. IGF activated mTOR, Rictor, Raptor, p70s6k and Akt, but also enhanced aH3 and aH4. Inversely, IGFr blockade and knock-down blocked the Akt-mTOR axis, but simultaneously diminished aH3 and aH4. VPA treatment up-regulated histone acetylation, but also activated mTOR-Akt signalling. HDAC1 and 2 knock-down revealed that the interaction with the mTOR system is initiated by histone H3 acetylation. HDAC-mTOR communication, therefore, is apparent whereby tumour-promoting (Akt/mTOR(high), aH3/aH4(low)) and tumour-suppressing signals (Akt/mTOR(low) , aH3/aH4(high)) are activated in parallel. Combined use of an HDAC- and mTOR inhibitor might then diminish pro-tumour effects triggered by the HDAC- (Akt/mTOR(high)) or mTOR inhibitor (aH3/aH4(low)) alone.""","""['Jasmina Makarević', 'Nassim Tawanaie', 'Eva Juengel', 'Michael Reiter', 'Jens Mani', 'Igor Tsaur', 'Georg Bartsch', 'Axel Haferkamp', 'Roman A Blaheta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Resistance after chronic application of the HDAC-inhibitor valproic acid is associated with elevated Akt activation in renal cell carcinoma in vivo.', 'Acetylation of histone H3 prevents resistance development caused by chronic mTOR inhibition in renal cell carcinoma cells.', 'Inhibition of mTOR signalling potentiates the effects of trichostatin A in human gastric cancer cell lines by promoting histone acetylation.', ""Deciphering the enigmatic crosstalk between prostate cancer and Alzheimer's disease: A current update on molecular mechanisms and combination therapy."", ""Crosstalk between epigenetics and mTOR as a gateway to new insights in pathophysiology and treatment of Alzheimer's disease."", 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Allyl-, Butyl- and Phenylethyl-Isothiocyanate Modulate Akt-mTOR and Cyclin-CDK Signaling in Gemcitabine- and Cisplatin-Resistant Bladder Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Plant-Derived Sulforaphane Suppresses Growth and Proliferation of Drug-Sensitive and Drug-Resistant Bladder Cancer Cell Lines In Vitro.', 'Early phase clinical studies of AR-42, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for neurofibromatosis type 2-associated vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas.', 'Epigenetic Regulation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression through the mTOR Signaling Pathway.']"""

Preclinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment suppresses androgen levels and causes shrinkage of androgen-dependent organs, such as the prostate gland. Early reports of clinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment leads to reduced prostate-specific antigen levels, a marker of prostate cancer tumor burden, and more complete suppression of androgen synthesis than conventional androgen deprivation therapies that act in the testes alone. Treatment with single-agent orteronel has been well tolerated with fatigue as the most common adverse event, while febrile neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity in a combination study of orteronel with docetaxel.

However, the precise requirement of c-kit for intraosseous growth of PCa and its relation to BRCA2 expression remain unexplored. Here, we show that c-kit expression promotes migration and invasion of PCa cells. Alongside, we found that c-kit expression in PCa cells parallels BRCA2 downregulation. Gene rescue experiments with human BRCA2 transgene in c-kit-transfected PCa cells resulted in reduction of c-kit protein expression and migration and invasion, suggesting a functional significance of BRCA2 downregulation by c-kit. The inverse association between c-kit and BRCA2 gene expressions in PCa cells was confirmed using laser capture microdissection in experimental intraosseous tumors and bone metastases of PCa patients. Inhibition of bone-induced c-kit expression in PCa cells transduced with lentiviral short hairpin RNA reduced intraosseous tumor incidence and growth.

Materials and methods:   Nanobubbles carrying AR siRNA were prepared using poly-L-lysine and electrostatic adsorption methods. Using C4-2 cell activity as a testing index, the optimal irradiation parameters (including the nanobubble number/cell number ratio, mechanical index [MI], and irradiation time) were determined and used for transfection of three human prostate cancer cell lines (C4-2, LNCaP, and PC-3 cells). The AR expression levels were investigated with RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Additionally, the effects of the nanobubbles and control microbubbles named SonoVue were assessed via imaging in a C4-2 xenograft model. Finally, the growth and AR expression of seven groups of tumor tissues were assessed using the C4-2 xenograft mouse model.  Results:   The nanobubbles had an average diameter of 609.5±15.6 nm and could effectively bind to AR siRNA. Under the optimized conditions of a nanobubble number/cell number ratio of 100∶1, an MI of 1.2, and an irradiation time of 2 min, the highest transfection rates in C4-2, LNCaP, and PC-3 cells were 67.4%, 74.0%, and 63.96%, respectively. In the C4-2 and LNCaP cells, treatment with these binding nanobubbles plus ultrasonic irradiation significantly inhibited cell growth and resulted in the suppression of AR mRNA and protein expression. Additionally, contrast-enhanced ultrasound showed that the nanobubbles achieved stronger signals than the SonoVue control in the central hypovascular area of the tumors. Finally, the anti-tumor effect of these nanobubbles plus ultrasonic irradiation was most significant in the xenograft tumor model compared with the other groups.

Methods:   In total, 128 men with known liver cirrhosis were prospectively evaluated using the validated German version of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire. In parallel, all men underwent a detailed examination including medical history; physical examination; Child-Pugh liver function score (CPS) assessment; and measurement of blood levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), total and free testosterone, sexual hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), prolactin, luteotropic hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  Results:   Mean patient age and mean IPSS was 56 ± 9 years and 8 ± 6, respectively. Mild (IPSS: 1-7), moderate (IPSS: 8-19), and severe (IPSS: 20-35) LUTS were present in 60.2 % (77/128), 31.3 % (40/128), and 7.0 % (9/128) of the patients, respectively. Storage symptoms increased with the CPS (p = 0.04). Voiding symptoms and overall IPSS did not differ between the CPS groups (p = 0.93 and p = 0.67). No correlation was found between ascites volume and IPSS, storage symptoms, voiding symptoms, or quality of life (QoL) (p = 0.46, p = 0.26, p = 0.81, p = 0.87). From CPS groups A to C, mean PSA levels (p = 0.04), total and free testosterone levels (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001), and SHBG levels decreased (p = 0.03); however, prolactin levels increased (p = 0.03). LH and FSH levels did not differ between the CPS groups (p = 0.15 and p = 0.35).  Conclusions:   Men with liver cirrhosis commonly have LUTS, with a predominance of storage symptoms.

Afterward, HSP27- and miR-1-triggered Ebp1 protein expression was monitored by Western blotting.  Results:   AR-positive LNCaP cells and AR-negative PC-3 cells possessed diverse basal expression levels of Ebp1.

Mortality from PCa is caused by the movement of cancer cells from the primary organ to form metastatic tumors at distant sites. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is known to increase human PCa cell invasion and its overexpression is associated with metastatic disease. The role of HSP27 in driving PCa cell movement from the prostate to distant metastatic sites is unknown. Increased HSP27 expression increased metastasis as well as primary tumor mass. In vitro studies further examined the mechanism of HSP27-induced metastatic behavior. HSP27 did not affect cell detachment, adhesion, or migration, but did increase cell invasion. Cell invasion was dependent upon matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), whose expression was increased by HSP27. In vivo, HSP27 induced commensurate changes in MMP-2 expression in tumors. These findings demonstrate that HSP27 drives metastatic spread of cancer cells from the prostate to distant sites, does so across a continuum of expression levels, and identifies HSP27-driven increases in MMP-2 expression as functionally relevant. These findings add to prior studies demonstrating that HSP27 increases PCa cell motility, growth and survival.

Although early disease is often efficiently managed therapeutically, available options for advanced disease are mostly ineffective. Aberrant DNA methylation associated with gene-silencing of cancer-related genes is a common feature of PCa. Therefore, DNA methylation inhibitors might constitute an attractive alternative therapy. Herein, we evaluated the anti-cancer properties of hydralazine, a non-nucleoside DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) inhibitor, in PCa cell lines. In vitro assays showed that hydralazine exposure led to a significant dose and time dependent growth inhibition, increased apoptotic rate and decreased invasiveness. Furthermore, it also induced cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. These phenotypic effects were particularly prominent in DU145 cells. Following hydralazine exposure, decreased levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b mRNA and DNMT1 protein were depicted. Moreover, a significant decrease in GSTP1, BCL2 and CCND2 promoter methylation levels, with concomitant transcript re-expression, was also observed. Interestingly, hydralazine restored androgen receptor expression, with upregulation of its target p21 in DU145 cell line. Protein array analysis suggested that blockage of EGF receptor signaling pathway is likely to be the main mechanism of hydralazine action in DU145 cells. Our data demonstrate that hydralazine attenuated the malignant phenotype of PCa cells, and might constitute a useful therapeutic tool.""","""['Inês Graça', 'Elsa J Sousa', 'Pedro Costa-Pinheiro', 'Filipa Q Vieira', 'Jorge Torres-Ferreira', 'Maria Gabriela Martins', 'Rui Henrique', 'Carmen Jerónimo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Anti-tumoral effect of the non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitor RG108 in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Increased levels of DNA methyltransferases are associated with the tumorigenic capacity of prostate cancer cells.', 'Hydralazine and Panobinostat Attenuate Malignant Properties of Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Cell signaling and regulators of cell cycle as molecular targets for prostate cancer prevention by dietary agents.', 'Non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor and vitamin D agonist are involved in suppressing invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells.', 'Recent advances in epigenetic anticancer therapeutics and future perspectives.', 'Inhibitors of DNA Methylation.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'miR-148a, miR-152 and miR-200b promote prostate cancer metastasis by targeting DNMT1 and PTEN expression.', 'Hydralazine and Enzalutamide: Synergistic Partners against Prostate Cancer.']"""

IMRT dose distributions for prostate and head and neck (HN) cancer patients were calculated with an analytical anisotropic algorithm in an Eclipse (Varian Medical Systems) treatment planning system (TPS) and by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The MC dose distributions were calculated with EGSnrc/BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc user codes under conditions identical to those for the TPS. The prescribed doses were 76 Gy/38 fractions with five-field IMRT for the prostate and 33 Gy/17 fractions with seven-field IMRT for the HN. TPS dose distributions were verified by the gamma passing rates for the whole calculated volume, PTV or CTV, and OARs by use of 3D gamma analysis with reference to MC dose distributions. The acceptance criteria for the 3D gamma analysis were 3/3 and 2 %/2 mm for a dose difference and a distance to agreement. The gamma passing rates in PTV and OARs for the prostate IMRT plan were close to 100 %. For the HN IMRT plan, the passing rates of 2 %/2 mm in CTV and OARs were substantially lower because inhomogeneous tissues such as bone and air in the HN are included in the calculation area. 3D gamma analysis for individual structures is useful for IMRT dose verification.""","""['Yuuki Tomiyama', 'Fujio Araki', 'Takeshi Oono', 'Kazunari Hioki']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Radiol Phys Technol""","""['Monte Carlo evaluation of tissue heterogeneities corrections in the treatment of head and neck cancer patients using stereotactic radiotherapy.', 'Correlation between the γ passing rates of IMRT plans and the volumes of air cavities and bony structures in head and neck cancer.', 'Preliminary study of clinical application on IMRT three-dimensional dose verification-based EPID system.', 'The use of non-standard CT conversion ramps for Monte Carlo verification of 6 MV prostate IMRT plans.', 'PTV-based IMPT optimization incorporating planning risk volumes vs robust optimization.', 'Dosimetric Evaluation of the QFix kVueTM Calypso Couch Top.', 'Accuracy of dose calculation algorithms for virtual heterogeneous phantoms and intensity-modulated radiation therapy in the head and neck.']"""

Previous linkage studies have reported a putative prostate cancer susceptibility locus at chromosome 17q21-22. SPOP (Speckle-type POZ protein) maps to the 17q21-22 candidate linkage region and is one of the most frequently mutated genes in sporadic prostate cancers.  Methods:   We performed targeted next generation sequencing to analyze 2009 exons from 202 genes in a candidate linkage region on chromosome 17q21-22 using 94 unrelated familial prostate cancer cases from the University of Michigan Prostate Cancer Genetics Project (n=54) and Johns Hopkins University (n=40) including the exons and UTRs of SPOP.  Results:   We identified a novel SPOP missense mutation (N296I) in a man with prostate cancer diagnosed at age 43. This mutation completely segregates with prostate cancer affection status among the men in this family. The N296I mutation resides within the evolutionarily conserved Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, Broad-complex (BTB) domain, involved in recruiting targets to Cul3 for degradation. Analysis of the prostate tumor from this individual verified the presence of heterozygous N296I as well as an ERG fusion.

Yet, the mechanisms that underlie NPM1 mediated phenotype remain elusive in the prostate. To better understand NPM1 functions in prostate cancer cells, we sought to characterize its impact on prostate cancer cells behaviour and decipher the mechanisms by which it may act. Here we show that NPM1 favors prostate tumour cell migration, invasion and colony forming. Furthermore, knockdown of NPM1 leads to a decrease in the growth of LNCaP-derived tumours grafted in Nude mice in vivo. Such oncogenic-like properties are found in conjunction with a positive regulation of NPM1 on the ERK1/2 (Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinases 1/2) kinase phosphorylation in response to EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) stimulus, which is critical for prostate cancer progression following the setting of an autonomous production of the growth factor.

However, its significance in early onset prostate cancer (PCA) is not characterized.  Materials and methods:   ERG protein expression was investigated in a cohort of 121 men diagnosed with localized PCA at <50 years of age with a mean follow-up time of 65.7 months. ERG was correlated to patients' outcome and clinical-pathological parameters using univariate and multivariate analysis.  Results:   ERG expression was detected in 76/118 (64.4 %) analyzable patients' samples and showed interfocal heterogeneity (differences between foci) in 17/118 (14.4 %) patients. There was significant association between ERG expression and Gleason score (p = 0.022), but not with any other clinical-pathologic parameter, including pre-surgical PSA levels, tumor volume, pathological stage, surgical margin or lymph-vascular invasion. ERG had significant effect on the rate of biochemical relapse following radical prostatectomy, with ERG positive patients showing higher relapse rates vs. ERG negative patients (p = 0.007). However, considering time till biochemical relapse post-radical prostatectomy, ERG expression showed positive insignificant trends (p = 0.071). Notably, and of great significance, in this cohort of early onset disease, none of the ERG negative PCA patients exhibited biochemical relapse.  Conclusion:   The study results suggest that ERG expression may be of added prognostic value in localized prostate cancer in patients with early onset PCA. However, the issue of ERG interfocal heterogeneity observed may require the evaluation of several tumor foci to assess ERG status per case.

Using an antibody to HIBCH, immunohistochemical analysis documented strong expression of the protein. Together, these data suggest that an augmented antibody response to HIBCH, an antigen that was expressed by the patient's prostate cancer, could have contributed to the clinical response.

The search for anti-cancer drugs has then become urgent. It depends on the studies of natural and chemical synthesis products. The antitumor action of LQB-118, a pterocarpanquinone structurally related to lapachol, has been demonstrated to induce mechanisms linked to leukemia cell apoptosis. This work investigated some mechanisms of the in vitro antitumor action of LQB-118 on prostate cancer cells. LQB-118 reduced the expression of the c-Myc transcription factor, downregulated the cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 mRNA levels and upregulated the p21 cell cycle inhibitor. These effects resulted in cell cycle arrest in the S and G2/M phases and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.

Recent studies have highlighted the role that Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP) isoforms play both in immune responses as well as in the development of prostate cancer and melanoma, suggesting that the discovery of selective ligands could have potential therapeutic value. Thus far, the N-methyl-substituted indololactone 1 is the agonist with the highest reported potency and selectivity for RasGRP relative to PKC.

These structural variations were studied to explore the interaction of the active complex (C1 domain-ligand) with cellular membranes, which is believed to be an important factor for selectivity in the activation of DAG-responsive C1 domain containing signaling proteins. All compounds were potent and selective activators of RasGRP when compared to PKCα with selectivities ranging from 6 to 65 fold. However, the parent compound 1 was appreciably more selective than any of the other isomers. In intact cells, modest differences in the patterns of translocation of the C1 domain targets were observed.

Objective:   To investigate rescreening intervals according to baseline PSA <3 ng/ml stratified by any and aggressive prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   From 1998 to 2012, data from 4350 men aged 55-70 yr were analyzed from a population-based prospective screening study (median follow-up: 11.6 yr).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was detection of aggressive PCa (Gleason score 7-10). Cox regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between covariates.  Results and limitations:   Baseline PSA of <1.0 ng/ml, 1-1.9 ng/ml, and 2-2.9 ng/ml was present in 2416 men (55.5%: group 1), 1371 men (31.6%: group 2), and 563 men (12.9%: group 3), respectively. Stratified according to these PSA groups, aggressive PCa was detected in 25 patients (1.0%), 80 patients (5.8%), and 34 patients (6.0%), respectively. During 4 yr, these numbers were 0.0%, 0.29%, and 1.8%, whereas during 8 yr, the numbers were 0.2%, 1.4%, and 2.5%, respectively. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, the only independent risk factor for aggressive PCa was baseline PSA (hazard ratio [HR]: 6.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.82-9.61; p<0.0001, group 2 vs group 1; and HR: 7.33; 95% CI, 4.29-12.52; p<0.0001, group 3 vs group 1).

Talins directly bind integrins and are essential for integrin activation. We previously showed that β1 integrins are activated in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) cells, increasing PCa metastasis to lymph nodes and bone. However, how β1 integrins are activated in PCa cells is unknown. In this study, we identified a novel mechanism of β1 integrin activation. Using knockdown experiments, we first demonstrated that talin1, but not talin2, is important in β1 integrin activation. We next showed that talin1 S425 phosphorylation, but not total talin1 expression, correlates with metastatic potential of PCa cells. Expressing a non-phosphorylatable mutant, talin1(S425A), in talin1-silenced PC3-MM2 and C4-2B4 PCa cells, decreased activation of β1 integrins, integrin-mediated adhesion, motility and increased the sensitivity of the cells to anoikis. In contrast, reexpression of the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant talin1(S425D) led to increased β1 integrin activation and generated biologic effects opposite to talin1(S425A) expression. In the highly metastatic PC3-MM2 cells, expression of a non-phosphorylatable mutant, talin1(S425A), in talin1-silenced PC3-MM2 cells, abolished their ability to colonize in the bone following intracardiac injection, while reexpression of phosphorylation-mimicking mutant talin1(S425D) restored their ability to metastasize to bone. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that talin S425 phosphorylation is significantly increased in human bone metastases when compared with normal tissues, primary tumors or lymph node metastases. We further showed that p35 expression, an activator of Cdk5, and Cdk5 activity were increased in metastatic tumor cells, and that Cdk5 kinase activity is responsible for talin1 phosphorylation and subsequent β1 integrin activation. Together, our study reveals Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of talin1 leading to β1 integrin activation is a novel mechanism that increases metastatic potential of PCa cells.""","""['J-K Jin', 'P-C Tien', 'C-J Cheng', 'J H Song', 'C Huang', 'S-H Lin', 'G E Gallick']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Targeting constitutively activated β1 integrins inhibits prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Talin1 promotes tumor invasion and metastasis via focal adhesion signaling and anoikis resistance.', 'Talin2-mediated traction force drives matrix degradation and cell invasion.', 'Roles of Talin2 in Traction Force Generation, Tumor Metastasis and Cardiovascular Integrity.', 'The tale of two talins - two isoforms to fine-tune integrin signalling.', 'BCKDK regulates breast cancer cell adhesion and tumor metastasis by inhibiting TRIM21 ubiquitinate talin1.', 'PFKFB3 downregulation aggravates Angiotensin II-induced podocyte detachment.', 'The role of integrin family in bone metabolism and tumor bone metastasis.', 'Cancer cell-derived CD69 induced under lipid and oxygen starvation promotes ovarian cancer progression through fibronectin.', 'Protein Kinase D2 and D3 Promote Prostate Cancer Cell Bone Metastasis by Positively Regulating Runx2 in a MEK/ERK1/2-Dependent Manner.']"""

Using ChIP-seq, we find that androgen stimulation results in a 6-fold increase in the number of H3T11P-marked regions and induces WDR5 colocalization to one third of H3T11P-enriched promoters, thus establishing a genome-wide relationship between H3T11P and recruitment of WDR5. Accordingly, PKN1 knockdown or chemical inhibition severely blocks WDR5 chromatin association and H3K4me3 on AR target genes.

Recent advances suggest that adiponectin also plays an important role in the development and progression of various cancers. Accumulating evidence suggests that adiponectin may have an important protective role in carcinogenesis. Adiponectin circulates at high concentrations in human plasma. Plasma levels of adiponectin are approximately 50 % lower in obese than in lean subjects. An association between low plasma levels of adiponectin and higher risk of developing prostate and other cancers was recently reported. Obesity and overweight have also been associated with increased mortality from cancer. To test the hypothesis that adiponectin exerts direct antiproliferative and/or pro-apoptotic effects on cancer cells, we used the PC-3 human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line. The proliferation rate of the PC-3 cells was measured using the MTT method, and apoptosis was examined by quantifying the DNA fragmentation using an ELISA assay. In addition, adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and AdipoR2 mRNA expression was detected using RT-PCR. Adiponectin diminished the proliferation rate of PC-3 cells; this effect was significant after 48-96 h of treatment. The presence of receptor expression suggested that the effect of adiponectin on cell proliferation was most likely specific and adiponectin receptor-mediated. Adiponectin induced no apoptosis of PC-3 cells over 48 h.

Results:   We examined androgen/AR signaling in OVTC PA1 cells, a CSPCs-rich cell line, and found that AR, but not androgen, promoted cell growth. We also examined the effects of AR on CSPCs characteristics and found that AR expression was more abundant in CD133+ cells, a well-defined ovarian cancer stem/progenitor marker, than in CD133- populations. Moreover, results of the sphere formation assay revealed that AR expression was required to maintain CSPCs populations. Interestingly, this AR-governed self-renewal capacity of CSPCs was only observed in CD133+ cells. In addition, we found that AR-mediated CSPCs enrichment was accompanied by down-regulation of p53 and p16. Finally, co-expression of AR and CD133 was more abundant in OVTC lesions than in normal ovarian tissue.  Conclusion:   The results of this study suggest that AR itself might play a ligand-independent role in the development of OVTC.""","""['Wei-Min Chung', 'Wei-Chun Chang', 'Lumin Chen', 'Tze-Yi Lin', 'Liang-Chi Chen', 'Yao-Ching Hung', 'Wen-Lung Ma']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Stem Cell Res""","""['Androgen/Androgen Receptor Signaling in Ovarian Cancer: Molecular Regulation and Therapeutic Potentials.', 'MicroRNA-21 promotes the ovarian teratocarcinoma PA1 cell line by sustaining cancer stem/progenitor populations in vitro.', 'Nanog interaction with the androgen receptor signaling axis induce ovarian cancer stem cell regulation: studies based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system.', 'Differential response to exogenous and endogenous activin in a human ovarian teratocarcinoma-derived cell line (PA-1): regulation by cell surface follistatin.', ""TGFβ Family Signaling Pathways in Pluripotent and Teratocarcinoma Stem Cells' Fate Decisions: Balancing Between Self-Renewal, Differentiation, and Cancer."", 'A Novel 3D Culture Scaffold to Shorten Development Time for Multicellular Tumor Spheroids.', 'Molecular Regulation of Androgen Receptors in Major Female Reproductive System Cancers.', 'Anabolic Steroids-Driven Regulation of Porcine Ovarian Putative Stem Cells Favors the Onset of Their Neoplastic Transformation.', 'Androgen/Androgen Receptor Signaling in Ovarian Cancer: Molecular Regulation and Therapeutic Potentials.', 'Estrogen-Estrogen Receptor α Signaling Facilitates Bilirubin Metabolism in Regenerating Liver Through Regulating Cytochrome P450 2A6 Expression.']"""

The authors have previously reported that tissue harmonic ultrasound images (THI) are superior to brightness (B) mode for the prostate. The objective of the current study was to compare both imaging modes for visualization of the prostatic urethra and rectum. B and THI mode transrectal ultrasound images were acquired for ten patients. The prostatic urethra and rectal wall were contoured by a radiation oncologist (RO) and five observers on randomly presented images. The contours on one patient were repeated four additional times by four observers. All the images were qualitatively scored using a five-level Likert scale. The values of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients showed that the observers were in close agreement with the RO. Two sample paired student t-test showed that the rectum volumes with THI were significantly smaller than B-mode, but no significant difference for urethra. Two-factor analysis of variances showed significant observer variability in defining the rectum and urethra in both imaging modes. Observer consistency of the rectum volumes, estimated by standard deviations as percentages of means was significantly improved for THI. The Likert scale based qualitative assessment supported quantitative observations. The significant improvement in image quality of the prostate (reported previously) and rectum with THI may offer better-quality treatment plans for prostate brachytherapy and potential improvement in local control.""","""['Gurpreet K Sandhu', 'Steve Angyalfi', 'Peter B Dunscombe', 'Rao F Khan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Inter- and intra-observer variability in prostate definition with tissue harmonic and brightness mode imaging.', 'Poster - Thur Eve - 12: Dosimetric manifestation of harmonic mode imaging for seed implant brachytherapy.', 'A pre-clinical phantom comparison of tissue harmonic and brightness mode imaging for application in ultrasound guided prostate brachytherapy.', '""State of the art"" transrectal ultrasound imaging in the assessment of prostatic disease.', 'The role of transrectal ultrasound on prostatic cryotherapy and brachytherapy.', 'Being certain about uncertainties: a robust evaluation method for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy treatment plans including the combination of uncertainties.']"""

Materials and methods:   Twenty patients were treated with image-guided IMRT. Each pre-treatment plan (Plan A) was compared with a post-treatment plan sum (Plan B) based on couch shifts measured. The delivered dose to the prostate without a daily repositioning was inferred by considering each daily couch shift during the whole course of image-guided IMRT (i.e., plan B). Dose metrics were compared for prostate CTV (P-CTV) and PTV (P-PTV) and for organs at risk. Ten patients were treated with a 5 mm margin and 10 patients with a 10 mm margin.  Results:   For plan A vs. plan B: the average D95, D98, D50, D mean and EUD were: 76.4 Gy vs. 73.9 Gy (p = 0.0007), 75.4 Gy vs. 72.3 Gy (p = 0.001), 78.9 Gy vs. 78.4 Gy (p = 0.014), 78.7 Gy vs. 77.8 Gy (p = 0.003) and 78.1 Gy vs. 75.9 Gy (p = 0.002), respectively for P-CTV, and 73.2 Gy vs. 69.3 Gy (p = 0.0006), 70.7 Gy vs. 66.0 Gy (p = 0.0008), 78.3 Gy vs. 77.5 Gy (p = 0.001), 77.8 Gy vs. 76.4 Gy (p = 0.0002) and 74.4 Gy vs. 69.2 Gy (p = 0.003), respectively for P-PTV. Margin comparison showed no differences in dose metrics between the two plans except for D98 of the rectum in plan B which was significantly higher with a 10 mm margin.

We have examined the expression and localization of Separase protein in adult and pediatric glioblastoma and normal brain specimens. Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis showed significant overexpression of Separase in all adult and a subset of pediatric glioblastoma cells. Tumor status and patient survival strongly correlate with the mislocalization of Separase into the nucleus throughout all stages of the cell cycle. Unlike exclusively nuclear localization in mitotic control cells, glioblastoma samples have a significantly higher number of resting (interphase) cells with strong nuclear Separase staining. Additionally, patient survival analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between overexpression of Separase protein in adult glioblastoma and a high incidence of relapse and reduced overall survival.

Patients and methods:   In our prospective study, 83 patients underwent monopolar or bipolar transurethral resection of bladder tumors between April 2006 and February 2007 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Dedicated genitourinary oncology pathologists blinded to resection type and assessed pathologic features including stage and grade, presence of muscularis propria, fragment size, presence and thickness of thermal artifacts within the specimen, layer of tissue most affected, severity of tissue distortion, and diagnostic impact of thermal artifacts. Clinical outcomes including, perforation, obturator reflex, need for muscle paralysis, a catheter, or admission, were recorded. Clinical and pathologic outcomes between resection modality were compared.  Results:   There were no significant thermal artifacts in 9/38 (23.7 %) and 11/45 (24.4 %) monopolar and bipolar specimens, respectively. The layer of bladder tissue most affected by thermal artifacts was readable in 18/38 (47.4 %) monopolar and 27/45 (60.0 %) bipolar specimens. Tissue distortion from thermal artifacts led to areas within 11/38 (28.9 %) monopolar and 7/45 (15.6 %) bipolar specimens being unreadable. Ultimately, thermal artifacts caused moderate diagnostic difficulty in 2/38 (5.3 %) specimens of the monopolar group and severe diagnostic difficulty in 1/45 (2.2 %) bipolar specimens. Clinically, there was no major difference between resection methods.  Conclusion:   Plasma kinetic bipolar equipment appears to cause less tissue distortion and has the potential to facilitate staging and grading of bladder tumors. No differences in clinical outcomes were appreciated between resection methods.

Especially, the role of WWP1 in HCC has not yet been studied. Firstly, we analyzed the expression of WWP1 in HCC samples. We found that protein levels of WWP1 are higher in most HCC cancerous tissues as compared with their matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. Additionally, the WWP1 mRNA was also amplified in all 7 HCC tissues. Knockdown of the endogenous WWP1 using small interfering RNA further showed that deficiency of WWP1 suppressed cell growth and caused apoptosis in HCC cells. Knocking down WWP1 promoted cleaved caspase3 protein and p53 expression in HCC cells, and caspase3 inhibition could prevent cell apoptosis induced by the knockdown of WWP1. All together these results indicate that protein levels of WWP1 in most HCC tissues are higher than non-tumor tissues, and knockdown of WWP1 inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in HCC cells through the activation of caspase3 and p53.

Seven hypervariable regions of Ad5 hexon present in Ad5-based Ad.sTβRFc expressing soluble transforming growth factor beta receptor II-Fc fusion protein (sTGβRIIFc), were replaced by those of Ad48. mHAd.sTβRFc, like Ad.sTβRFc, was replication competent in the human PCa cells, and produced high levels of sTGβRIIFc expression. Compared to Ad.sTβRFc, the systemic delivery of mHAd.sTβRFc in nude mice resulted in much reduced systemic toxicity, and reduced liver sequestration. Ad.sTβRFc produced significant liver necrosis, and increases in alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 levels, while mHAd.sTβRFc produced much reduced responses of these markers. Intravenous delivery of Ad.sTβRFc or mHAd.sTβRFc (5 × 10(10) viral particles/mouse) in nude mice bearing PC-3-luc PCa bone metastases produced inhibition of bone metastases.

Prostate cancer patients may have an increased rate of osteopenia and osteoporosis independent of therapy. Osteopenia and fracture risk are accelerated in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy. Nevertheless, little is done by primary care physicians and urologists to diagnose and treat osteoporosis in men.  Aims:   (1) Assess prostate cancer patients' compliance and adherence to bisphosphonate therapy; (2) Increase awareness for osteoporosis in men diagnosed with prostate cancer among urologists and primary care physicians and to evaluate collaboration between the two disciplines.  Methods:   We included patients with confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer who fulfilled one or more of the following criteria: (1) age 70 and above; (2) age 60 and above with androgen deprivation therapy or (3) prior diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Qualified patients were referred to DXA bone density test. Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis, who were naïve to bisphosphonates, received recommendations for oral bisphosphonates. Follow-up lasted 6 months and included 2 office visits to ensure patients' compliance and adherence to recommended therapy.  Results:   A total of 28 community-based urologists recruited 180 patients. Of the 180 prostate cancer patients, 87 (48%) had osteoporosis and 93 (52%) osteopenia, all were naïve to bisphosphonates. Of the 180 patients, 153 (85%) patients started treatment with bisphosphonates after inclusion; 147/180 (82%) and 136/180 (76%) patients stayed on bisphosphonates for 3 and 6 months respectively. Primary care physicians adopted recommendations for bisphosphonate in 123/180 (68%).

Methods:   We used a database developed by linking records from the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System with Medicare and Medicaid files, death certificates, and U.S. Census data. The study population included community-dwelling Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, age 66 years or older, with low incomes, residing in Ohio, and diagnosed with incident loco-regional breast (n=838), colorectal (n=784), or prostate cancer (n=946) in years 1997-2001. We identified as ""duals"" Medicare beneficiaries who were enrolled in Medicaid at least three months prior to cancer diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression and survival models were developed to analyze the association between dual status and (1) receipt of definitive treatment; and (2) overall and disease-specific survival, after adjusting for tumor stage and patient covariates.  Results:   DUAL STATUS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LIKELIHOOD TO RECEIVE DEFINITIVE TREATMENT AMONG COLORECTAL CANCER PATIENTS (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO: 0.60, 95% Confidence Interval, or CI, [0.38, 0.95]), but not among breast or prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, dual status was associated with decreased overall survival among prostate cancer patients (Adjusted Hazard Ratio, or AHR, 1.45, 95% CI [1.05, 2.02]), and decreased disease-specific survival among colorectal cancer patients (AHR: 1.52 [1.05, 2.19]).

This study was initiated to explore whether ZEB2 expression differs in prostate cancer (PCa, n=7) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, n=7) tissues. In PCa tissues, the levels of both immunoreactive ZEB2 and androgen receptor (AR) were found to be significantly higher (P<0.05) when compared with BPH tissues. Co-regulation of AR and ZEB2 prompted us to investigate the role of androgenic stimuli in ZEB2 expression. ZEB2 expression was found to be significantly (P<0.05) upregulated after androgen stimulation and downregulated following AR silencing in LNCaP cells, an androgen-dependent PCa cell line. This finding suggested AR as a positive regulator of ZEB2 expression in androgen-dependent cells. Paradoxically, androgen-independent (AI) cell lines PC3 and DU145, known to possess low AR levels, showed significantly (P<0.05) higher expression of ZEB2 compared with LNCaP cells. Furthermore, forced expression of AR in PC3 (PC3-AR) and DU145 (DU-AR) cells led to reductions in ZEB2 expression, invasiveness, and migration. These cells also exhibited an increase in the levels of E-cadherin (a transcriptional target of ZEB2). Co-transfection of AR and ZEB2 cDNA constructs prevented the decline in invasiveness and migration to a significant extent. Additionally, ZEB2 downregulation was associated with an increase in miR200a/miR200b levels in PC3-AR cells and with a decrease in miR200a/miR200b levels in AR-silenced LNCaP cells. Thus, AR acts as a positive regulator of ZEB2 expression in androgen-dependent cells and as a negative regulator in AI PCa cells.""","""['Sheeba Jacob', 'S Nayak', 'Gwendolyn Fernandes', 'R S Barai', 'S Menon', 'U K Chaudhari', 'S D Kholkute', 'Geetanjali Sachdeva']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Identification of an anabolic selective androgen receptor modulator that actively induces death of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'The prostate cancer-up-regulated long noncoding RNA PlncRNA-1 modulates apoptosis and proliferation through reciprocal regulation of androgen receptor.', 'Increased expression of androgen receptor sensitizes prostate cancer cells to low levels of androgens.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-375 is a therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer through the PTPN4/STAT3 axis.', 'The role of N-cadherin/c-Jun/NDRG1 axis in the progression of prostate cancer.', 'Role of microRNA-129 in cancer and non-cancerous diseases (Review).', 'The circadian cryptochrome, CRY1, is a pro-tumorigenic factor that rhythmically modulates DNA repair.', 'Dynamics of Cellular Plasticity in Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Chemically synthesized AT-001, administered subcutaneously, suppressed PC3 xenograft growth by up to 60%. AT-001 also synergized with docetaxel, standard first-line chemotherapy for HRPC, to suppress tumor growth by more than 98% in PC3 xenografts via a mechanism involving the downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and the hypoxia-induced response.

Methods:   To address this question, we undertook the world's largest prospective study in the Nordic Twin Study of Cancer cohort, including 18,680 monozygotic (MZ) and 30,054 dizygotic (DZ) same-sex male twin pairs. We incorporated time-to-event analyses to estimate the risk concordance and heritability while accounting for censoring and competing risks of death, essential sources of biases that have not been accounted for in previous twin studies modeling cancer risk and liability.  Results:   The cumulative risk of prostate cancer was similar to that of the background population. The cumulative risk for twins whose co-twin was diagnosed with prostate cancer was greater for MZ than for DZ twins across all ages. Among concordantly affected pairs, the time between diagnoses was significantly shorter for MZ than DZ pairs (median, 3.8 versus 6.5 years, respectively). Genetic differences contributed substantially to variation in both the risk and the liability [heritability = 58% (95% confidence interval, 52%-63%)] of developing prostate cancer. The relative contribution of genetic factors was constant across age through late life with substantial genetic heterogeneity even when diagnosis and screening procedures vary.  Conclusions:   Results from the population-based twin cohort indicate a greater genetic contribution to the risk of developing prostate cancer when addressing sources of bias.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both genders worldwide, with an incidence only second to prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women. The lethality of the disease highlights the urgent need for innovative therapeutic options. Immunotherapy can afford efficient and specific targeting of tumor cells, improving efficacy and reducing the side effects of current therapies. We have previously reported the aberrant expression of cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) in tumors of unrelated histological origin. In this study we investigated the expression and immunogenicity of the cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) Sperm Protein 17 (SP17), A-kinase anchor protein 4 (AKAP4) and Pituitary Tumor Transforming Gene 1 (PTTG1) in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and primary tumors. METHODS. We used RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, ELISA and cytotoxicity assays to determine the expression levels and immunogenicity of SP17, AKAP4 and PTTG1 in human NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors. RESULTS. We found that SP17, AKAP4 and PTTG1 are aberrantly expressed in NSCLC cancer cell lines and primary tumor tissues from patients, compared to normal lung cell lines and tissues. We established the immunogenicity of these CTAs by measuring CTA-specific autoantibodies in patients' sera and generating CTA-specific autologous cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) from patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). CONCLUSIONS. Our results provide proof of principle that the CTAs SP17/AKAP4/PTTG1 are expressed in both human NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors and can elicit an immunogenic response in NSCLC patients. Based on our findings, further studies are warranted to explore the feasibility of developing CTA-specific immunotherapeutic strategies for NSCLC patients.""","""['Maurizio Chiriva-Internati', 'Leonardo Mirandola', 'Jose A Figueroa', 'Yuefei Yu', 'Fabio Grizzi', 'Minji Kim', 'Marjorie Jenkins', 'Everardo Cobos', 'Cynthia Jumper', 'Raed Alalawi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Chest""","""['Novel antigens in non-small cell lung cancer: SP17, AKAP4, and PTTG1 are potential immunotherapeutic targets.', 'Cancer testis antigen Sperm Protein 17 as a new target for triple negative breast cancer immunotherapy.', 'Tumor vaccine for ovarian carcinoma targeting sperm protein 17.', 'Cancer immunotherapy targeting Sp17: when should the laboratory findings be translated to the clinics?', 'Cancer/Testis Antigens as Biomarker and Target for the Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Therapy of Lung Cancer.', 'Clinical significance and potential regulatory mechanism of overexpression of pituitary tumor-transforming gene transcription factor in bladder cancer.', 'Comprehensive Analysis Uncovers Prognostic and Immunogenic Characteristics of Cellular Senescence for Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Cancer-Testis Antigen Peptide Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy: Progress and Prospects.', 'AKAP4 mediated tumor malignancy in esophageal cancer.', 'AKAP4 is a circulating biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

However, the expression and function of HepaCAM in prostate cancer are still unknown.  Methods:   HepaCAM expression has been detected by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry staining in prostate cell lines RWPE-1, LNCap, DU145, PC3, and in 75 human prostate tissue specimens, respectively. Meanwhile, the cell proliferation ability was detected by WST-8 assay. The role of HepaCAM in prostate cancer cell migration and invasion was examined by wound healing and transwell assay. And flow cytometry was used to observe the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Then we detected changes of Androgen Receptor translocation and ERK signaling using immunofluorescence staining and western blot after overexpression of HepaCAM.  Results:   The HepaCAM expression was significantly down-regulated in prostate cancer tissues and undetected in prostate cancer cells. However, the low HepaCAM expression was not statistically associated with clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer. Overexpression of HepaCAM in prostate cancer cells decreased the cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced the cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, HepaCAM prevented the androgen receptor translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and down-regulated the MAPK/ERK signaling.  Conclusion:   Our results suggested that HepaCAM acted as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. HepaCAM inhibited cell viability and motility which might be through suppressing the nuclear translocation of Androgen Receptor and down-regulating the ERK signaling. Therefore, it was indicated that HepaCAM may be a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer.""","""['Xuedong Song', 'Yin Wang', 'Hongfei Du', 'Yanru Fan', 'Xue Yang', 'Xiaorong Wang', 'Xiaohou Wu', 'Chunli Luo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Vasoactive intestinal peptide transactivates the androgen receptor through a protein kinase A-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Specific amino acid dependency regulates invasiveness and viability of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Androgen receptor: good guy or bad guy in prostate cancer invasion?', 'ZIP9, a novel membrane androgen receptor and zinc transporter protein.', 'HepaCAM‑PIK3CA axis regulates the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism to inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'Novel Gene Signatures Predictive of Patient Recurrence-Free Survival and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Sub-lethal Doses of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers, in Vitro, Promote Oxidative Stress and Modulate Molecular Markers Related to Cell Cycle, Antioxidant Balance and Cellular Energy Management.', 'HepaCAM inhibits cell proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer by suppressing nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor via its cytoplasmic domain.', 'Erianin inhibits human cervical cancer cell through regulation of tumor protein p53 via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway.']"""

The spectrum of different multicellular morphologies formed in 3D is a sensitive indicator for the differentiation potential of normal, non-transformed cells compared to different stages of malignant progression. In addition, single cells or cell aggregates may actively invade the matrix, utilizing epithelial, mesenchymal or mixed modes of motility. Dynamic phenotypic changes involved in 3D tumor cell invasion are sensitive to specific small-molecule inhibitors that target the actin cytoskeleton. We have used a panel of inhibitors to demonstrate the power of automated image analysis as a phenotypic or morphometric readout in cell-based assays. We introduce a streamlined stand-alone software solution that supports large-scale high-content screens, based on complex and organotypic cultures. AMIDA (Automated Morphometric Image Data Analysis) allows quantitative measurements of large numbers of images and structures, with a multitude of different spheroid shapes, sizes, and textures. AMIDA supports an automated workflow, and can be combined with quality control and statistical tools for data interpretation and visualization. We have used a representative panel of 12 prostate and breast cancer lines that display a broad spectrum of different spheroid morphologies and modes of invasion, challenged by a library of 19 direct or indirect modulators of the actin cytoskeleton which induce systematic changes in spheroid morphology and differentiation versus invasion. These results were independently validated by 2D proliferation, apoptosis and cell motility assays. We identified three drugs that primarily attenuated the invasion and formation of invasive processes in 3D, without affecting proliferation or apoptosis. Two of these compounds block Rac signalling, one affects cellular cAMP/cGMP accumulation. Our approach supports the growing needs for user-friendly, straightforward solutions that facilitate large-scale, cell-based 3D assays in basic research, drug discovery, and target validation.""","""['Ville Härmä', 'Hannu-Pekka Schukov', 'Antti Happonen', 'Ilmari Ahonen', 'Johannes Virtanen', 'Harri Siitari', 'Malin Åkerfelt', 'Jyrki Lötjönen', 'Matthias Nees']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Quantitative Phenotypic Image Analysis of Three-Dimensional Organotypic Cultures.', 'A comprehensive panel of three-dimensional models for studies of prostate cancer growth, invasion and drug responses.', 'Staged stromal extracellular 3D matrices differentially regulate breast cancer cell responses through PI3K and beta1-integrins.', 'The matrix environmental and cell mechanical properties regulate cell migration and contribute to the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.', 'Multicellular 3D Models to Study Tumour-Stroma Interactions.', 'Vascularization Strategies in 3D Cell Culture Models: From Scaffold-Free Models to 3D Bioprinting.', 'Addition of ROCK Inhibitors Alleviates Prostaglandin-Induced Inhibition of Adipogenesis in 3T3L-1 Spheroids.', 'Morphometrical, Morphological, and Immunocytochemical Characterization of a Tool for Cytotoxicity Research: 3D Cultures of Breast Cell Lines Grown in Ultra-Low Attachment Plates.', 'Three-Dimensional Organotypic Cultures Reshape the microRNAs Transcriptional Program in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Optogenetic control of NOTCH1 signaling.']"""

Methods:   Data from 4,376 men diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer between 1997 and 2002 were analyzed. BMI and weight change were self-reported in 2007.

This suggests that the local or intracrine production of androgens may drive these diseases. Both diseases are dependent on the conversion of androgen by the epithelial compartment to the ligand with higher affinity and can be treated by blocking synthesis of this androgen metabolite. For this approach to be effective, a detailed knowledge of androgen biosynthesis in both disease states is required. The aim of the present study was to investigate the gene expression levels of androgen metabolising enzymes in BPH compared to normal adjacent prostate tissues and CaP. Expression of the genes HSD3B1, HSD17B3, and SRD5A2 was significantly increased in BPH tissues compared to normal adjacent prostate tissues. In contrast to BPH, CaP demonstrated significant decrease in the expression of HSD17B3, AKR1C2, and SRD5A2 compared to normal adjacent prostate tissues. HSD17B2 expression was significantly decreased in all samples. Moreover, HSD3B1 and SRD5A2 mRNA levels were upregulated in BPH compared with CaP. These results suggest that a change in androgen metabolism may be an important step in the pathogenesis of BPH, leading to increased cell proliferation due to in situ androgen synthesis. These features can be used to develop differential treatment strategies for BPH. HSD3B1 and SRD5A2 could be used as therapeutic target for BPH.""","""['E P Khvostova', 'A A Otpuschennikov', 'V O Pustylnyak', 'L F Gulyaeva']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Horm Metab Res""","""['De novo steroid biosynthesis in human prostate cell lines and biopsies.', 'Transcript profiling of the androgen signal in normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'Expression of adrenomedullin and peptide amidation activity in human prostate cancer and in human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Sex steroid hormone metabolism and prostate cancer.', 'Differential but Concerted Expression of HSD17B2, HSD17B3, SHBG and SRD5A1 Testosterone Tetrad Modulate Therapy Response and Susceptibility to Disease Relapse in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'HSD3B1 variant and androgen-deprivation therapy outcome in prostate cancer.', 'Transcript Levels of Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Subfamily C (AKR1C) Are Increased in Prostate Tissue of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.', 'Serum Steroid Ratio Profiles in Prostate Cancer: A New Diagnostic Tool Toward a Personalized Medicine Approach.', 'mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes, steroid hormone receptors and their coregulators in gastric cancer.']"""

Clinically, the dysregulation of androgen action has been associated with the formation of PrCa and the outcome of androgen deprivation therapy in PrCa. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD) is a transcription factor that has been reported to act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor, depending on the extra- and intracellular environments following tumorigenesis. We found that androgen can activate CEBPD transcription by direct binding of the androgen receptor (AR) to the CEBPD promoter region. Increases of suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) attenuated the androgen-induced transcription of CEBPD. Importantly, the increases in E2F1, SUZ12 and EZH2 as well as the inactivation of CEBPD were associated with the clinicopathological variables and survival of PrCa patients. We revealed that caspase 8 (CASP8), an apoptotic initiator, is responsive to CEBPD induction. Reporter and in vivo DNA-binding assays revealed that CEBPD directly binds to and activates CASP8 reporter activity. A prodrug system was developed for therapeutic application in AR-independent or androgen-insensitive PrCa to avoid the epigenetic effects on the suppression of CEBPD expression. Our results showed that the combination of a perforin (PF)-CEBPD prodrug (which increases the level of procaspase-8) and a PF-granzyme B prodrug (which activates CASP8 and caspase 3 (CASP3)) showed an additive effect in triggering the apoptotic pathway and enhancing apoptosis in PrCa cells.""","""['C-H Chuang', 'W-J Wang', 'C-F Li', 'C-Y Ko', 'Y-H Chou', 'C-P Chuu', 'T-L Cheng', 'J-M Wang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['HMDB and 5-AzadC Combination Reverses Tumor Suppressor CCAAT/Enhancer-Binding Protein Delta to Strengthen the Death of Liver Cancer Cells.', 'Epigenetic silencing of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta activity by YY1/polycomb group/DNA methyltransferase complex.', 'CEBPD reverses RB/E2F1-mediated gene repression and participates in HMDB-induced apoptosis of cancer cells.', 'Mutations and deletions of PRC2 in prostate cancer.', 'The biological impacts of CEBPD on urothelial carcinoma development and progression.', 'Signatures of Co-Deregulated Genes and Their Transcriptional Regulators in Kidney Cancers.', 'Bioinformatics-based analysis of the roles of sex hormone receptors in endometriosis development.', 'CCAAT/Enhancer-Binding Protein Delta Regulates Glioblastoma Survival through Catalase-Mediated Hydrogen Peroxide Clearance.', 'Angiogenesis Driven by the CEBPD-hsa-miR-429-VEGFA Signaling Axis Promotes Urothelial Carcinoma Progression.', 'Biological significance of MYC and CEBPD coamplification in urothelial carcinoma: Multilayered genomic, transcriptional and posttranscriptional positive feedback loops enhance oncogenic glycolysis.']"""

We report here the anti-tumor effect of the angio-inhibitory pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in the metastatic LNCaP-derivative CRPC CL1 model and explore PEDF anti-neoplasic efficacy in combination with low-dose chemotherapy. Androgen-sensitive LNCaP and CRPC PC3 cell lines were examined as comparison. Using a retroviral expression system, we showed that PEDF limited the proliferation of all prostatic cell lines tested; an effect attributed to interleukin 8 (IL8)-CXCR1/IL8RA inhibition. PEDF also reduced the number and size of 3D tumor spheroids in vitro, but only induced cell differentiation in CRPC spheroids. Similarly, PEDF inhibited the migration of CRPC cells suggesting both anti-proliferative and anti-migratory functions. In vivo, PEDF decreased by 85% and 65% the growth of subcutaneous (s.c.) PC3 and CL1 tumors, respectively. In the CL1 orthotopic model, tumor intake with lethal metastases was found in all animals; nevertheless, PEDF prolonged the median survival of tumor-bearing mice (95% confidence interval: 53 ± 0.001 to 57 ± 1 days). Accordingly, PEDF delayed the emergence of skeletal-related event in intra-tibial xenografts. Next, we evaluated low-dose docetaxel (DTX; 5, 1, 0.5 mg/kg) or cyclophosphamide (CTX; 10-20 mg/kg) on established s.c. PC3 tumors that conditionally express PEDF anti-tumoral epitope/NT3. Although NT3-DTX-5 mg/kg combination was inefficient, NT3-DTX-1 mg/kg and -0.5 mg/kg inhibited by 95% and 87.8%, respectively, tumor growth compared with control and induced tumor stasis. Both NT3-CTX combinations were advantageous. Inversely, PEDF-DTX-5 mg/kg and PEDF-CTX-10 mg/kg delayed the most CL1 tumor growth (15, 11 and 5 days for PEDF-DTX-5 mg/kg, PEDF-CTX-10 mg/kg and single treatments, respectively) with elevated apoptosis and serum thrombospondin-1 as possible mechanism and marker, respectively. As well, both PEDF-CTX-10 mg/kg and PEDF-DTX-5 mg/kg prolonged significantly the survival of tumor-bearing mice compared with single treatments. Metastases were reduced in PEDF-DTX-5 mg/kg compared with other treatments, suggesting that PEDF-DTX delayed metastases formation.

Forty-three consecutive patients (ages ranging from 49 to 86 years, with a median age of 74 years) with pathologically confirmed prostate cancer were recruited. An ASL scan with four different inversion times (TI = 1000, 1200, 1400 and 1600 ms) and a DCE-MRI scan were performed on a clinical 3.0 T GE scanner. BF, K(trans), kep and ve maps were calculated. In order to determine whether the BF values in the cancerous area were statistically different from those in the noncancerous area, an independent t-test was performed. Spearman's bivariate correlation was used to assess the relationship between BF and the pharmacokinetic parameters K(trans), kep and ve. The mean BF values in the cancerous areas (97.1 ± 30.7, 114.7 ± 28.7, 102.3 ± 22.5, 91.2 ± 24.2 ml/100 g/min, respectively, for TI = 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600 ms) were significantly higher (p < 0.01 for all cases) than those in the noncancerous regions (35.8 ± 12.5, 42.2 ± 13.7, 53.5 ± 19.1, 48.5 ± 13.5 ml/100 g/min, respectively).

Therefore, we believe that several changes should be made to the approach to cancer screening and care, such as use of new terminology for indolent and precancerous disorders. We propose the term indolent lesion of epithelial origin, or IDLE, for those lesions (currently labelled as cancers) and their precursors that are unlikely to cause harm if they are left untreated. Furthermore, precursors of cancer or high-risk disorders should not have the term cancer in them. The rationale for this change in approach is that indolent lesions with low malignant potential are common, and screening brings indolent lesions and their precursors to clinical attention, which leads to overdiagnosis and, if unrecognised, possible overtreatment. To minimise that potential, new strategies should be adopted to better define and manage IDLEs. Screening guidelines should be revised to lower the chance of detection of minimal-risk IDLEs and inconsequential cancers with the same energy traditionally used to increase the sensitivity of screening tests. Changing the terminology for some of the lesions currently referred to as cancer will allow physicians to shift medicolegal notions and perceived risk to reflect the evolving understanding of biology, be more judicious about when a biopsy should be done, and organise studies and registries that offer observation or less invasive approaches for indolent disease. Emphasis on avoidance of harm while assuring benefit will improve screening and treatment of patients and will be equally effective in the prevention of death from cancer.""","""['Laura J Esserman', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Brian Reid', 'Peter Nelson', 'David F Ransohoff', 'H Gilbert Welch', 'Shelley Hwang', 'Donald A Berry', 'Kenneth W Kinzler', 'William C Black', 'Mina Bissell', 'Howard Parnes', 'Sudhir Srivastava']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Lancet Oncol""","""['Addressing overdiagnosis and overtreatment in cancer.', 'Addressing overdiagnosis and overtreatment in cancer.', 'Addressing overdiagnosis and overtreatment in cancer.', 'Addressing overdiagnosis and overtreatment in cancer.', 'The Evolution of Our Understanding of the Biology of Cancer Is the Key to Avoiding Overdiagnosis and Overtreatment.', 'Population-based screening for cancer: hope and hype.', 'Forward to the Past-Oncology Between Underdiagnosis and Overtreatment.', 'The long-term psychosocial consequences of screen-detected ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer.', ""Professionals' views on the justification for esophageal adenocarcinoma screening: A systematic literature search and qualitative analysis."", 'Should low-risk DCIS lose the cancer label?

Materials and methods:   Data on 253 patients treated with RNU between 1995 and 2008 at a single high-volume tertiary referral center were analyzed. Statistically and clinically significant patient and tumor characteristics were identified in a univariate analysis and incorporated into a multivariable Cox regression model. The model was compared to the 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging classification using the concordance index (c-index), corrected for statistical optimism using bootstrap methods.  Results:   Five-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were 73% [95% confidence interval (CI): 66-79%)] and 78% (95% CI: 71-84%), respectively. On multivariate analysis, higher preoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was associated with better CSS [hazard ratio (HR) per 1 mL/min/m2 increase in GFR for CSS: 0.74; P = .002)], while higher pathologic stage (HR for pT2: 2.99 and for ≥ pT3: 7.34; P < .001) and lymph node involvement (HR: 3.75; P < .001) were associated with worse CSS; results were similar for RFS. The ability of the final models, which included preoperative GFR, lymph node status, pathologic grade, and stage, to predict RFS and CSS (c-index 0.82 and 0.83, respectively) was similar to that of the 2010 AJCC staging classification (c-index 0.80 and 0.81, respectively).  Conclusion:   Given the data-dependent selection of variables in this single institution cohort, it is unlikely that the marginal improvement found with these prediction models would importantly impact clinical decision-making or improve patient care. The 2010 AJCC staging classification alone is very accurate and should continue to guide follow-up after RNU.""","""['Behfar Ehdaie', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Caroline Savage', 'Jonathan Coleman', 'Guido Dalbagni']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['Predicting clinical outcomes after radical nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma.', 'Prediction of intravesical recurrence after radical nephroureterectomy: development of a clinical decision-making tool.', 'Comparison of oncological outcomes after segmental ureterectomy or radical nephroureterectomy in urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract: results from a large French multicentre study.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of oncological and renal function outcomes obtained after segmental ureterectomy versus radical nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma.', 'Impact of ureteroscopy before radical nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinomas on oncological outcomes: a meta-analysis.', 'Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate as a Prognostic Factor in Urothelial Carcinoma of the Upper Urinary Tract: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Can American Joint Committee on Cancer prognostic groups be individualized in patients undergoing surgery for Stage IV invasive upper tract Urothelial Carcinoma?', 'Development and validation of prognostic nomograms and a web-based survival rate calculator for sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma in pre- and post-treatment patients.', 'Developing a prediction model for disease-free survival from upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma in the Korean population.', 'Can lymphovascular invasion replace the prognostic value of lymph node involvement in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma after radical nephroureterectomy?']"""

Methods:   A total of 3227 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy (open, robotic or laparoscopic) for clinically localized prostate cancer at three centers between 2000 and 2010 were analyzed. Patients were stratified by using the D'Amico risk criteria. Positive surgical margins were categorized according to their location. Patients were divided depending on their prostate volume: <29, 29-36, 36-46 and ≥46 mL. All of the patients had a minimum of six. A total of 2041 patients (84.9%) underwent 12-14 core biopsies. In each patient, the number and location of positive cores with cancer were assessed. In the analysis of predictive factors for positive surgical margin locations, regression analysis was carried out using only open and robotic prostatectomy.  Results:   The preoperative prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, biopsy Gleason scores and clinical stage were significantly associated with an increased risk of positive surgical margins. The predictive variables for positive apical margin were small prostate volume (less than 29 mL) and positive apical biopsy. There were no statistically significant predictors for positive posterolateral or basal margin. Positive apical biopsy was the predictor of positive apical margin in open (odds ratio 1.7, P = 0.009) and robotic prostatectomy (odds ratio 2.2, P = 0.041). Small prostate volume was the predictor of positive apical margin in open prostatectomy (odds ratio 1.6, P = 0.012), but for positive basal margin in robotic radical prostatectomy (odds ratio 4.5, P < 0.001). In survival analysis, positive basal margin showed worse prognoses on biochemical recurrence than positive apical margin.  Conclusions:   High prostate-specific antigen and small prostate volume are predictive factors of positive surgical margin in Korean patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Apical positivity on extended transrectal biopsy represents a predictive factor of positive surgical margin. Small prostate volume is associated with higher risk of positive surgical margins at the apex in open radical prostatectomy and at the base in robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.""","""['Min Soo Choo', 'Sung Yong Cho', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Seung Bae Lee', 'Ja Hyeon Ku', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Cheol Kwak', 'Hyeon Hoe Kim', 'Sang Eun Lee', 'Hyeon Jeong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['A comparison of the incidence and location of positive surgical margins in robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'Characteristics of positive surgical margins in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, open retropubic radical prostatectomy, and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a comparative histopathologic study from a single academic center.', 'Length of positive surgical margin after radical prostatectomy as a predictor of biochemical recurrence.', 'Margin control in robotic and laparoscopic prostatectomy: what are the REAL outcomes?', 'Histopathologic outcomes of robotic radical prostatectomy.', 'Evaluating Incidence, Location, and Predictors of Positive Surgical Margin Among Chinese Men Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Predictive Factors for Positive Surgical Margins in Patients With Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'There Are No Differences in Positive Surgical Margin Rates or Biochemical Failure-Free Survival among Patients Receiving Open, Laparoscopic, or Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: A Nationwide Cohort Study from the National Cancer Database.', 'The value of transperineal apical prostate biopsy in predicting urethral/apical margin status after radical prostatectomy.']"""

We report the enzalutamide effect on primary prostate tumors, assessed by changes of metabolic tumor activity detected by (18)F-fluorocholine-positron emission tomography/computerized tomography ((18)F-FCH PET/CT).  Patients and methods:   We treated 31 patients with pretreated metastatic CRPC in an enzalutamide named-patient program. All patients were initially evaluated and then followed up by means of repeated (18)F-FCH PET/CT examinations. We identified most radiotracer-avid lesions, which were defined as specific regions of interest (ROIs): for each ROI we defined the maximum radiotracer standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and the threshold-based volume of interest (VOI) with a cutoff SUV value ≥ 2.5. In the 12 patients who did not receive a radical treatment for localized disease, the prostate was also considered an ROI.

Patients and methods:   The Triptocare study was a prospective, open-label, multicentre, single-arm, Phase III study of triptorelin 22.5 mg in men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, who were naïve to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). The primary objective was to model the urinary PCA3 change at 6 months, according to baseline variables. Other outcome measures included urinary PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG scores and statuses, and serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after initiation of ADT. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters.  Results:   The intent-to-treat population comprised 322 patients; 39 (12.1%) had non-assessable PCA3 scores at baseline, and 109/322 (33.9%), 215/313 (68.7%) and 232/298 (77.9%) had non-assessable PCA3 scores at 1, 3 and 6 months, respectively. Baseline Gleason score was the only variable associated with non-assessability of PCA3 score at 6 months (P = 0.017) - the hazard of having a non-assessable PCA3 score at 6 months was 1.824-fold higher (95% confidence interval 1.186-2.805) in patients with a Gleason score ≥8 vs those with a Gleason score ≤6. The median PCA3 scores at baseline were significantly higher in patients aged ≥65 years vs those aged <65 years and in patients with a serum PSA level <100 ng/mL vs those with serum PSA level of >200 ng/mL. The median PCA3 score was significantly lower in patients with metastasis than in patients with no metastasis or unknown metastasis status. TMPRSS2-ERG scores ≥35 were considered positive (n = 149 [51.6%]). Age, presence of metastasis, PSA level and Gleason score at baseline were not associated with a significant difference in the proportion of TMPRSS2-ERG-positive scores. The median serum PSA levels decreased from 45.5 ng/mL at baseline to 1.2 ng/mL after 6 months, and as expected, >90% of patients achieved castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) at 1, 3, and 6 months during triptorelin treatment. The safety profile reported from this study is consistent with the known safety profile of triptorelin.  Conclusion:   These data from the Triptocare study suggest that urinary PCA3 or TMPRSS2-ERG score are not reliable markers of cancer stage in advanced prostate cancer.

Both MMP-1 and PAR-1 proteins were positively localized in cytoplasm of tumor cells in PCa tissues. Compared with non-cancerous prostate tissues, MMP-1 (PCa vs. Normal: 4.15 ± 1.28 vs. 2.37 ± 1.16, P < 0.001) and PAR-1 (PCa vs. Normal: 3.71 ± 1.21 vs. 1.55 ± 1.12, P < 0.001) protein expression were both significantly upregulated. More interestingly, the expression levels of MMP-1 in PCa tissues were positively correlated with those of PAR-1 significantly (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.88, P < 0.001). In addition, the coexpression of MMP-1 and PAR-1 (MMP-1-high/PAR-1-high) in PCa tissues was significantly associated with the higher Gleason score (P < 0.001), the presence of metastasis (P < 0.001) and the advanced pathological stage (P = 0.009). Furthermore, both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that MMP-1-high/PAR-1-high expression was an independent predictor for both unfavorable overall survival and biochemical recurrence-free survival.

However, little is known about the effect of on the biological behaviors of HER2-positive SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the effects of BMP9 on the proliferation and metastasis of SK-BR-3 cells with BMP9 over-expression or BMP9 down-regulated expression. Results indicated that exogenously expressed BMP9 inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of SK-BR-3 cells while decreased endogenous BMP9 expression in SK-BR-3 cells promoted the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In SK-BR-3 cells with BMP9 over-expression, the phosphorylation of HER2, ERK1/2 and AKT was markedly suppressed and the HER2 expression decreased at both mRNA and protein levels, while opposite results were observed in SK-BR-3 cells with BMP9 knock down.

Previous studies have showed that miR-100 is downregulated in human prostate cancer tissue compared to normal prostate and also significantly decreased in bone metastatic prostate cancer samples compared with primary prostate cancer. Argonaute 2 (AGO2) is the core effector protein of the miRNA-induced silencing complex and overexpression of AGO2 might enhance tumor metastasis. However, it is unknown whether and how miR-100 and AGO2 regulates metastasis of prostate cancer. Here, we report that miR-100 negatively regulated migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), colony formation, spheroid formation and expression of the stemness factors c-Myc, Oct4 and Klf4 in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Furthermore, miR-100 expression was negatively correlated with bone metastasis of prostate cancer patients. Notably, luciferase assay showed that AGO2 was a direct target of miR-100. Downregulation of AGO2 repressed migration, invasion, EMT and stemness of prostate cancer cells, and reversed the effects seen with miR-100 downregulation. Downregulation of AGO2 enhanced expression of miR-34a and miR-125b which can suppress migration, invasion, EMT and stemness of cancer cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that loss of miR-100 promotes the metastatic ability of prostate cancer cells at least partially by upregulating AGO2 expression through modulating migration, invasion, EMT and stemness of cancer cells, and suggest that miR-100/AGO2 may play an important role in regulating the metastasis of prostate cancer and is a potential target of prevention and therapy.""","""['Min Wang', 'Dong Ren', 'Wei Guo', 'Zeyu Wang', 'Shuai Huang', 'Hong Du', 'Libing Song', 'Xinsheng Peng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Wild-type p53 suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness in PC-3 prostate cancer cells by modulating miR‑145.', 'Double-negative feedback loop between ZEB2 and miR-145 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem cell properties in prostate cancer cells.', 'Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Stromal-induced downregulation of miR-1247 promotes prostate cancer malignancy.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy of green tea extract on PC3 prostate cancer cells through upregulation of miR-195 expression and suppression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'Antitumor Activities of Green Tea by Up-regulation of miR-181a Expression in LNCaP Cells Using 3D Cell Culture Model.', 'The Activation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Glioblastoma Microvesicles Alters Their Exosomal Secretion of miR-100-5p, miR-9-5p and let-7d-5p.', 'Dysregulation of miRNAs Targeting the IGF-1R Pathway in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.']"""

However, the detection of incidental prostate cancer (Pca) is impossible in vaporization techniques because of unavailability prostate tissue for histopathological analysis. To evaluate the clinical backgrounds and the usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-related factors in incidental Pca, we employed our BPH patients cohort treated by holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP).  Methods:   A total of 365 HoLEPs were performed by a single surgeon. The pathological results and pre- and post-HoLEP PSA, PSA density and PSA velocity were analyzed retrospectively.  Results:   Incidental Pca was identified in 25 (6.8 %) of the 365 patients treated with HoLEP. There were significant differences between BPH and Pca in terms of prostate volume (55.5 vs. 47 ml, p = 0.0365), preoperative PSA (4.50 vs. 7.14 ng/ml, p = 0.0107), PSA density (0.079 vs. 0.155 ng/ml/cm(3), p = 0.0005), and postoperative PSA velocity (0.04 vs. 0.22 ng/ml/year, p = 0.0033), respectively. Comparisons of Gleason score subgroups in the 25 patients with incidental Pca identified significant differences in preoperative PSA (6.06 vs. 21.6 ng/ml, p = 0.0191) and postoperative PSA velocity (0.185 vs. 1.32 ng/ml/year, p = 0.0382) between the Gleason score 3 + 3 and Gleason score >3 + 3 groups, respectively.  Conclusions:   Risk factors associated with incidental Pca were smaller prostate volume, higher preoperative PSA, and higher PSA density. Postoperative PSA velocity was also significantly increased in patients with incidental Pca, especially those with higher Gleason score.

Here we report that there is an inverse relation of the expression pattern of TET1 and EZH2 in both normal gastric mucosa and gastric cancer. In gastric mucosa, EZH2 is selectively expressed in the proliferating neck cells while TET1 and 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5-hmc) exhibit very low expression in the neck cells. In contrast, TET1 and 5-hmc expression is high in gastric glandular epithelium while EZH2 expression is absent in this cell population. On the other hand, in proliferating Ki67-positive gastric cancer cells, EZH2 is highly expressed while TET1 and 5-hmc expression is significantly down-regulated. When the mouse homologue of human TET1 protein Tet1 is overexpressed in a gastric cancer cell line MGC-803, we observed the dramatically down-regulation of EZH2 in one-third of the Tet1 overexpressed cells. In addition, Tet1 overexpressing cells also lost the H3K27 trimethylation mark and the cell proliferation protein Ki67. Furthermore, Tet1 overexpression induced p53 tumor suppressor protein. The increase of p53 protein level is accompanied by the phosphorylation of p53 by activated DNA-PK. Together, these results suggested a mechanism by which TET1 suppresses cancer formation by coupling DNA demethylation with DNA-PK activation of p53 and suppression of oncogenic protein EZH2. Conversely, loss of TET1 and 5-hmc expression might contribute to EZH2 up-regulation during gastric cancer development.""","""['Hua-Lin Fu', 'Yue Ma', 'Lun-Gen Lu', 'Peng Hou', 'Bao-Jie Li', 'Wei-Lin Jin', 'Da-Xiang Cui']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Biomed Nanotechnol""","""['Loss of TET1 facilitates DLD1 colon cancer cell migration via H3K27me3-mediated down-regulation of E-cadherin.', 'TET1 inhibits gastric cancer growth and metastasis by PTEN demethylation and re-expression.', 'Inhibition enhancer of zeste homologue 2 promotes senescence and apoptosis induced by doxorubicin in p53 mutant gastric cancer cells.', 'PRIMA-1 selectively induces global DNA demethylation in p53 mutant-type thyroid cancer cells.', 'EZH2: An Accomplice of Gastric Cancer.', 'TET1 is a Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker Associated with Immune Infiltration in Papillary Thyroid Cancer.', 'Hypoxia switches TET1 from being tumor-suppressive to oncogenic.', 'Epigenetic Abnormalities in Chondrosarcoma.', 'SMYD2 aggravates gastrointestinal stromal tumor via upregulation of EZH2 and downregulation of TET1.', 'Deoxyribonucleic Acid 5-Hydroxymethylation in Cell-Free Deoxyribonucleic Acid, a Novel Cancer Biomarker in the Era of Precision Medicine.']"""

Cancer-specific survival (CSS) was determined in 166 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, to evaluate the influence of the three SNPs.

Functional dissection of the uniporter is now possible through the recent identification of the genes encoding for MCU protein complex subunits. Cancer cells exhibit many aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with altered mitochondrial Ca2+ levels including resistance to apoptosis, increased reactive oxygen species production and decreased oxidative metabolism. We used a publically available database to determine that breast cancer patient outcomes negatively correlated with increased MCU Ca2+ conducting pore subunit expression and decreased MICU1 regulatory subunit expression. We hypothesized breast cancer cells may therefore be sensitive to MCU channel manipulation. We used the widely studied MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to investigate whether disruption or increased activation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake with specific siRNAs and adenoviral overexpression constructs would sensitize these cells to therapy-related stress. MDA-MB-231 cells were found to contain functional MCU channels that readily respond to cellular stimulation and elicit robust AMPK phosphorylation responses to nutrient withdrawal. Surprisingly, knockdown of MCU or MICU1 did not affect reactive oxygen species production or cause significant effects on clonogenic cell survival of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to irradiation, chemotherapeutic agents, or nutrient deprivation.

Methods:   Data on newly diagnosed metastatic PrCA cases (stage IV, N=7858) were obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Conventional multivariable survival analysis and propensity score analysis were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) comparing men who underwent definitive local therapy of the primary tumor to those who did not.  Results:   After adjusting for sociodemographic and tumor attributes, having RP after diagnosis with metastatic PrCA was associated with 73% (HR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.20-0.38) lower risk of all-cause mortality and 72% (HR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.20-0.39) reduced risk of death from PrCA. Having BT also was associated with 57% (HR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.31-0.59) and 54% (HR=0.46, 95% CI: 0.33-0.64) lower risk of all-cause and PrCA-specific mortality. Similar results were observed in propensity score-adjusted analysis as well as when stratified by age and extent of tumor metastasis.

Patients and method:   Data were analysed from patients receiving the above procedures between 2006 to present, taken from the prospective brachytherapy database of 2000 patients at the St. Luke's Cancer Centre. The limited TURP (TURP(BXT) ) was performed at a median (range) of 64 (25-205) days before seed implantation with a median resection weight of 1.15 g. Selection criteria were based on patients with moderate lower urinary tract symptoms, poor flow or post-void residual urine volume (PVR), or a prominent middle lobe or high bladder neck on transrectal ultrasonography. Baseline prostate cancer characteristics, uroflowmetry, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and quality-of-life QoL scores were collected and compared with follow-up IPSS and QoL scores.  Results:   Data for 112 patients was gathered from the database. The TURP(BXT) resulted in statistically significant improvements before LDR brachytherapy in maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax ) and PVR, IPSS and QoL scores (the mean Qmax before vs after the TURP(BXT) was 11.3 vs 16.7 mL/s). The IPSS and QoL scores at 6 months after seed implantation were increased compared with baseline values before the TURP(BXT) (mean IPSS at 6 months 11.7 vs 9.2 before TURP(BXT) ), but no difference at 1 year (mean IPSS 9), and improved scores at 2, 3, 4 and 5 years follow-up (mean IPSS of 7.9, 5.6, 5.3 and 7.4, respectively).  Conclusion:   The present study suggests patients at increased risk of deteriorating voiding symptoms, including urinary retention, are no longer contraindicated against LDR brachytherapy if they receive a modified TURP before seed implantation.

We hypothesize that the reduction and elimination of racial survival disparity among African American men (AAM; high-risk group) compared with European American men (EAM; intermediate-risk group) during the PSA testing era compared with the pre-PSA era strongly supports the use of PSA testing in AAM.  Methods:   We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data to investigate relative survival disparities between AAM and EAM. To evaluate pre-PSA testing era, we selected malignant first primary prostate cancer in AAM and EAM, all stages, diagnosed during 1973-1994. To evaluate relative survival disparities in the current PSA testing era, we selected malignant first primary local, regional, and distant stage prostate cancers diagnosed during 1998-2005 to calculate 5-year relative survival rates.  Results:   Age-adjusted 5-year relative survival of prostate cancer diagnosed during 1973-1994 in the national SEER data revealed significantly shorter survival for AAM compared with EAM (P < 0.0001). The SEER-based survival analysis from 1995 to 2005 indicated no statistical difference in relative survival rates between AAM and EAM by year of diagnosis of local, regional, or distant stage prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   We conclude that the elimination of prostate cancer racial disparity of local, regional, and metastatic prostate cancer relative survival in the current PSA testing era compared with pre-PSA era as an endpoint to test PSA efficacy as a marker for prostate cancer diagnosis is evidence for aggressive testing of AAM.

However, the molecular mechanism remains elusive.  Methods:   Prostate cancer LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC3 cells were cultured and treated with the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and CAY10404. Knockdown of COX-2 in LNCaP cells was carried out using lentiviral vector-loaded COX-2 shRNA. Cell cycle progression and cell proliferation were analyzed by flow cytometry, microscopy, cell counting, and the MTT assay. The antagonists of EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 were used to examine the effects of the PGE2 signaling. The effect of COX-2 inhibitors and COX-2 knockdown on expression of the kinetochore/centromere genes and proteins was determined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting.  Results:   Treatment with the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and CAY10404 or knockdown of COX-2 significantly inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation. Flow-cytometric analysis and immunofluorescent staining confirmed the cell cycle arrested at the G2/M phase. Biochemical analysis showed that inhibition of COX-2 or suppression of COX-2 expression induced a dramatic down-regulation of key proteins in the kinetochore/centromere assembly, such as ZWINT, Cdc20, Ndc80, CENP-A, Bub1, and Plk1. Furthermore, the EP1 receptor antagonist SC51322, but not the EP2, EP3, and EP4 receptor antagonists, produced similar effects to the COX-2 inhibitors on cell proliferation and down-regulation of kinetochore/centromere proteins, suggesting that the effect of the COX-2 inhibition is through inactivation of the EP1 receptor signaling.

Materials and methods:   A web-based survey was conducted between 15 August and 15 September 2013 by members of the Prostate Cancer Working Group of the Young Academic Urologists Working Party of the European Association of Urology (EAU). A specific, 29-item multiple-choice questionnaire covering the whole spectrum of diagnosis, staging and treatment of high-risk PCa was e-mailed to all urologists included in the mailing list of EAU members. Europe was divided into four geographical regions: Central-Eastern Europe (CEE), Northern Europe (NE), Southern Europe (SE) and Western Europe (WE). Descriptive statistics were used. Differences among sample segments were obtained from a z-test compared with the total sample.  Results:   Of the 12,850 invited EAU members, 585 urologists practising in Europe completed the survey. High-risk PCa was defined as serum PSA ≥20 ng/mL or clinical stage ≥ T3 or biopsy Gleason score ≥ 8 by 67% of responders, without significant geographical variations. The preferred single-imaging examinations for staging were bone scan (74%, 81% in WE and 70% in SE; P = 0.02 for both), magnetic resonance imaging (53%, 72% in WE and 40% in SE; P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively) and computed tomography (45%, 60% in SE and 23% in WE; P = 0.01 for both). Pre-treatment predictive tools were routinely used by 62% of the urologists, without significant geographical variations. The preferred treatment was radical prostatectomy as the initial step of a multiple-treatment approach (60%, 40% in NE and 70% in CEE; P = 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively), followed by external beam radiation therapy with androgen deprivation therapy (29%, 45% in NE and 20% in CEE; P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively), and radical prostatectomy as monotherapy (4%, 7% in WE; P = 0.04). When surgery was performed, the open retropubic approach was the most popular (58%, 74% in CEE, 37% in NE; P < 0.01 for both). Pelvic lymph node dissection was performed by 96% of urologists, equally split between a standard and extended template. There was no consensus on the definition of disease recurrence after primary treatment, and much heterogeneity in the administration of adjuvant and salvage treatments.  Conclusion:   With the limitation of a low response rate, the present study is the first survey evaluating preferences in the management of high-risk PCa among urologists in Europe.

Despite a high demand of cancer cells for cationic amino acids, their potential as PET probes remains unexplored. Arginine, in particular, is involved in a number of biosynthetic pathways that significantly influence carcinogenesis and tumor biology. Cationic amino acids are transported by several cationic transport systems including, ATB(0,+) (SLC6A14), which is upregulated in certain human cancers including cervical, colorectal and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. In this work, we report the synthesis and preliminary biological evaluation of a new cationic analog of the clinically used PET tumor imaging agent O-(2-[(18)F]fluroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([(18)F]FET), namely O-2((2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)methylamino)ethyltyrosine ([(18)F]FEMAET). Reference compound and precursor were prepared by multi-step approaches. Radiosynthesis was achieved by no-carrier-added nucleophilic [(18)F]fluorination in 16-20% decay-corrected yields with radiochemical purity >99%. The new tracer showed good stability in vitro and in vivo. Cell uptake assays demonstrated that FEMAET and [(18)F]FEMAET accumulate in prostate cancer (PC-3) and small cell lung cancer cells (NCI-H69), with an energy-dependent mechanism. Small animal PET imaging with NCI-H69 xenograft-bearing mice revealed good tumor visualization comparable to [(18)F]FET and low brain uptake, indicating negligible transport across the blood-brain barrier.

The procedure was performed transperineally, using a hands-free technique (without an external grid template) under real-time bi-plane transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guidance, using an argon/helium-gas-based third generation cryoablation system. Follow-up consisted of validated questionnaires, physical examination, PSA measures, multiparametric TRUS and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mandatory biopsy.  Results:   The important steps for achieving safety, satisfactory oncological and functional outcomes included: patient selection, including TRUS/MRI fusion target biopsy; thermocouple and cryoprobe placement with a hands-free technique, allowing delivery in unrestricted angulations according to the prostatic contour, the course of the neurovascular bundle and the rectal wall angle; and hands-free bi-plane TRUS probe manipulation to facilitate real-time monitoring of anatomical landmarks at the ideal angle of the image plane.

Numerous reports highlight the role of tumor cells in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory molecules and show that hypoxia can modulate a number of these genes contributing substantially to the increase of cancer aggressiveness. However, little is known about the importance of the tumor phenotype in this process. The present study explores how different features, including differentiation and aggressiveness, of prostate tumor cell lines impact on the hypoxic remodeling of pro-inflammatory gene expression and malignancy. We performed our studies on three cell lines with increasing metastatic potential: the well differentiated androgen-dependent LNCaP and the less differentiated and androgen-independent DU145 and PC3. We analyzed the effect that hypoxic treatment has on modulating pro-inflammatory gene expression and evaluated the role HIF isoforms and NF-kB play in sustaining this process. DU145 and PC3 cells evidenced a higher normoxic expression and a more complete hypoxic induction of pro-inflammatory molecules compared to the well differentiated LNCaP cell line. The role of HIF1α and NF-kB, the master regulators of hypoxia and inflammation respectively, in sustaining the hypoxic pro-inflammatory phenotype was different according to cell type. NF-kB was observed to play a main role in DU145 and PC3 cells in which treatment with the NF-kB inhibitor parthenolide was able to counteract both the hypoxic pro-inflammatory shift and HIF1α activation but not in LNCaP cells. Our data highlight that tumor prostate cell phenotype contributes at a different degree and with different mechanisms to the hypoxic pro-inflammatory gene expression related to tumor progression.""","""['Linda Ravenna', 'Lorenzo Principessa', 'Alessandra Verdina', 'Luisa Salvatori', 'Matteo Antonio Russo', 'Elisa Petrangeli']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Pro-inflammatory gene expression in solid glioblastoma microenvironment and in hypoxic stem cells from human glioblastoma.', 'Up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes as adaptation to hypoxia in MCF-7 cells and in human mammary invasive carcinoma microenvironment.', 'PKM2 and HIF-1α regulation in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Bridging hypoxia, inflammation and estrogen receptors in thyroid cancer progression.', 'Tumor hypoxia and the progression of prostate cancer.', 'CACNA1D overexpression and voltage-gated calcium channels in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'miR-210 Expression Is Strongly Hypoxia-Induced in Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Cell Lines and Is Associated with Extracellular Vesicles and Argonaute-2.', 'Metabolic Disruption of Gold Nanospheres, Nanostars and Nanorods in Human Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The Role of Inflammation in Cognitive Impairment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome.', 'MAPK Signaling Pathway in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Biological Function and Targeted Therapy.']"""

We sought to identity additional FOXA1 binding partners that may mediate prostate-specific gene expression. Here we identify the nuclear factor I (NFI) family of transcription factors as novel FOXA1 binding proteins. All four family members (NFIA, NFIB, NFIC, and NFIX) can interact with FOXA1, and knockdown studies in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells determined that modulating expression of NFI family members results in changes in AR target gene expression. This effect is probably mediated by binding of NFI family members to AR target gene promoters, because chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies found that NFIB bound to the prostate-specific antigen enhancer. Förster resonance energy transfer studies revealed that FOXA1 is capable of bringing AR and NFIX into proximity, indicating that FOXA1 facilitates the AR and NFI interaction by bridging the complex. To determine the extent to which NFI family members regulate AR/FOXA1 target genes, motif analysis of publicly available data for ChIP followed by sequencing was undertaken. This analysis revealed that 34.4% of peaks bound by AR and FOXA1 contain NFI binding sites. Validation of 8 of these peaks by ChIP revealed that NFI family members can bind 6 of these predicted genomic elements, and 4 of the 8 associated genes undergo gene expression changes as a result of individual NFI knockdown.

This study assessed potential gene-environment statistical interactions (G×E) between rs10486567 and heavy metals in prostate cancer.  Methods:   In a case-only study of 228 African American prostate cancer cases, G×E between rs10486567 and sources of cadmium and lead (Pb) were assessed.

In Taiwanese men, GNMT was found to be a tumor susceptibility gene for prostate cancer. However, the association of GNMT with prostate cancer risk in other ethnicities has not been studied. It was recently reported that sarcosine, which is regulated by GNMT, increased markedly in metastatic prostate cancer. We hereby explored the association of GNMT polymorphisms with prostate cancer risk in individuals of European descent from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS).  Methods:   A total of 661 incident prostate cancer cases and 656 controls were identified from HPFS. The GNMT short tandem repeat polymorphism 1 (STRP1), 4-bp insertion/deletion polymorphisms (INS/DEL) and the single nucleotide polymorphism rs10948059 were genotyped to test for their association with prostate cancer risk.  Results:   The rs10948059 T/T genotype was associated with a 1.62-fold increase in prostate cancer risk (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18, 2.22) when compared with the C/C genotype.

It also examines the impact of AD on women compared with men. An estimated 5.2 million Americans have AD. Approximately 200,000 people younger than 65 years with AD comprise the younger onset AD population; 5 million are age 65 years or older. By mid-century, fueled in large part by the baby boom generation, the number of people living with AD in the United States is projected to grow by about 9 million. Today, someone in the country develops AD every 67 seconds. By 2050, one new case of AD is expected to develop every 33 seconds, or nearly a million new cases per year, and the total estimated prevalence is expected to be 13.8 million. In 2010, official death certificates recorded 83,494 deaths from AD, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans aged 65 years or older. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of deaths resulting from heart disease, stroke, and prostate cancer decreased 16%, 23%, and 8%, respectively, whereas the proportion resulting from AD increased 68%. The actual number of deaths to which AD contributes (or deaths with AD) is likely much larger than the number of deaths from AD recorded on death certificates. In 2014, an estimated 700,000 older Americans will die with AD, and many of them will die from complications caused by AD. In 2013, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.7 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $220 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with AD and other dementias are more than two and a half times as great as payments for all beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2014 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people aged 65 years and older with dementia are expected to be $214 billion. AD takes a stronger toll on women than men. More women than men develop the disease, and women are more likely than men to be informal caregivers for someone with AD or another dementia. As caregiving responsibilities become more time consuming and burdensome or extend for prolonged durations, women assume an even greater share of the caregiving burden. For every man who spends 21 to more than 60 hours per week as a caregiver, there are 2.1 women. For every man who lives with the care recipient and provides around-the-clock care, there are 2.5 women. In addition, for every man who has provided caregiving assistance for more than 5 years, there are 2.3 women.""","""[""Alzheimer's Association""]""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Alzheimers Dement""","""[""2015 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""2016 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""2013 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", 'Dementia -- Caring, Ethics, Ethnical and Economical Aspects: A Systematic Review Internet.', ""The costs of Alzheimer's disease and the value of effective therapies."", ""Electrochemical Immunosensors Developed for Amyloid-Beta and Tau Proteins, Leading Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease."", ""Mapping trends and hotspots of mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease from 2013 to 2022: a bibliometric analysis of global research."", 'The value of supportive care: A systematic review of cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for dementia.', ""Unravelling the mechanotransduction pathways in Alzheimer's disease."", ""Mortality of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias in China: Past and Future Decades.""]"""

However, the genes within this region are largely unknown. Here, we report for the first time the widespread attenuation of miR-3607, an miRNA gene located at chr5q14 region, in prostate cancer. Expression analyses of miR-3607 in a clinical cohort of prostate cancer specimens showed that miR-3607 is significantly attenuated and low miR-3607 expression is correlated with tumor progression and poor survival outcome in prostate cancer. Our analyses suggest that miR-3607 expression may be a clinically significant parameter with an associated diagnostic potential. We examined the functional significance of miR-3607 in prostate cancer cell lines and found that miR-3607 overexpression led to significantly decreased proliferation, apoptosis induction, and decreased invasiveness. Furthermore, our results suggest that miR-3607 directly represses oncogenic SRC family kinases LYN and SRC in prostate cancer. In view of our results, we propose that miR-3607 plays a tumor-suppressive role in prostate cancer by regulating SRC kinases that in turn regulates prostate carcinogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report that: (i) identifies a novel role for miR-3607 located in a frequently deleted region of prostate cancer and (ii) defines novel miRNA-mediated regulation of SRC kinases in prostate cancer.

Patients were stratified according to body mass index (BMI) standards for Asian populations: obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI 23-24.9 kg/m(2)), or normal weight (BMI <23 kg/m(2)).

BCR was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥0.2 ng/ml following RP.  Results:   Normal weight patients tended to be classified into the higher D'Amico risk category with smaller prostate volumes compared with obese and overweight patients. Normal weight patients had higher pathological Gleason scores and were at higher risk of BCR during the mean follow-up of 58.2 months.

A chiral l-tryptophan derived [bis(1,2-diaminobenzene) copper(II)] chloride complex [CuSn2(Trp)] was previously synthesized by us as an active chemotherapeutic agent. Furthermore, we have explored CuSn2(Trp) induced in vitro cytotoxicity in a panel of human cancer cell lines and in vivo acute and systemic toxicities in healthy female Rattus norvegicus (Wistar) rats. MTT assay showed that CuSn2(Trp) exhibits strong anticancer potency against ovarian (PA-1) and prostate carcinomas (PC-3) but lower potency towards liver (HepG2) and breast carcinomas (MCF-7). Further, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that CuSn2(Trp) kills PA-1 cells dose-dependently after 48 h treatment. Fluorescence microscopy and western blotting revealed that the plausible mechanism behind CuSn2(Trp) cytotoxicity was apoptosis, which was substantiated by cleavage of caspase-3 and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, it has lower toxicity than CDDP in rats as evident from its eight fold (98.11 mg kg(-1)) more medial lethal dose (LD50) than CDDP (12 mg kg(-1)). Besides, the safety profile of CuSn2(Trp) was also established and no measurable DNA damage, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity were observed when assessed as a function of oxidative stress markers in contrast to CDDP at equivalent lower doses.

Methods:   From 2009 to 2012, 41 patients with PCa diagnosed within the last 4 months and eligible for AS [clinical stage ≤T2a, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/ml, ≤2 positive biopsy cores with no Gleason pattern 4 or 5 and ≤5 mm involvement of any biopsy core] underwent pre-biopsy MRI, confirmatory transrectal ultrasound 12-core SB and MRI-TB of suspicious lesions. A contingency table assessed the accuracy of MRI to predict cancer upstaging.  Results:   Median age and PSA were 63.5 years and 5.3 ng/ml, respectively. Overall, 24 patients (59 %) were upstaged. This upstaging was obtained at a confirmatory SB in 16 patients (39 %) based on the Gleason score (9), on cancer length (8) or both (7) and at MRI-TB in 17 patients (41 %) based on the Gleason score (14), cancer length (9) or both (6). Nine patients were upstaged at both SB and TB (22 %). The added value of MRI-TB was 20 % (8/41). The positive and negative predictive values of MRI for predicting cancer upstaging were 79 and 70.5 %, respectively.  Conclusion:   MRI-TB and confirmatory SB upstaged 59 % of cases, improving the selection of patients considered for AS at the first series of SB. Variation in histologic grade assignation between centres and better cancer sampling may explain this high upstaging rate.""","""['François Marliere', 'Philippe Puech', 'Ahmed Benkirane', 'Arnauld Villers', 'Laurent Lemaitre', 'Xavier Leroy', 'Nacim Betrouni', 'Adil Ouzzane']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Additional value of magnetic resonance-targeted biopsies to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Comparing confirmatory biopsy outcomes between MRI-targeted biopsy and standard systematic biopsy among men being enrolled in prostate cancer active surveillance.', 'Feasibility and preliminary clinical tolerability of low-field MRI-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Should we perform systematic biopsies in case of suspicious MRI for prostate cancer in 2020?

Few data exist to help clinicians identify which patients are at risk for decisional conflict. The purpose of this study was to examine factors associated with decisional conflict in economically disadvantaged men diagnosed with prostate cancer before any treatment choices were made.  Methods:   A total of 70 men were surveyed at a Veterans Administration clinic with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer enrolled in a randomized trial testing a novel shared decision-making tool. Baseline demographic, clinical, and functional data were collected. Independent variables included age, race, education, comorbidity, relationship status, urinary/sexual dysfunction, and prostate cancer knowledge. Tested outcomes were Decisional Conflict Scale, Uncertainty Subscale, and Perceived Effectiveness Subscale. Multiple linear regression modeling was used to identify factors associated with decisional conflict.  Results:   Mean age was 63 years, 49% were African American, and 70% reported an income less than $30,000. Poor prostate cancer knowledge was associated with increased decisional conflict and higher uncertainty (P < .001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Poor knowledge was also associated with lower perceived effectiveness (P = 0.003) whereas being in a relationship was associated with higher decisional conflict (P = 0.03).  Conclusions:   Decreased patient knowledge about prostate cancer is associated with increased decisional conflict and lower perceived effective decision-making. Interventions to increase comprehension of prostate cancer and its treatments may reduce decisional conflict.

Restoration of miR-218 in PCa cell lines (PC3 and DU145) revealed that this miRNA significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. Gene expression data and in silico analysis demonstrated that LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) is a potential target of miR-218 regulation. LASP1 is a cytoskeletal scaffold protein that plays critical roles in cytoskeletal organization and cell migration. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-218 directly regulated expression of LASP1. Moreover, downregulating the LASP1 gene significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in cancer cells, and the expression of LASP1 was upregulated in cancer tissues.

Methods:   We used MagPlex beads to measure serum S2,3PSA levels using anti-human fPSA monoclonal antibody (8A6) for capture and anti-α2,3-linked sialic acid monoclonal antibody (HYB4) for detection. We determined the cutoff values in a training test and measured serum S2,3PSA levels in 314 patients who underwent biopsy, including 138 PCa and 176 non-PCa patients with PSA of <10.0 ng/ml. Serum S2,3PSA levels were presented as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of total PSA, %fPSA, and S2,3PSA.  Results:   We determined an MFI cutoff value of 1130 with a sensitivity of 95.0% and specificity of 72.0% for the diagnosis of PCa in the training test. In the validation study, the area under the curve for the detection of PCa with S2,3PSA was 0.84, which was significantly higher than that with PSA or %fPSA.

Materials and methods:   The COLD Registry was queried for a risk stratified cohort of otherwise treatment naïve patients who underwent primary whole gland prostate cryoablation, of whom none had received any type of adjuvant therapy. Minimum followup in all study patients was 5 years. Variables included patient age, prostate specific antigen at diagnosis, Gleason score, D'Amico risk category and followup prostate specific antigen. Biochemical progression-free survival was studied based on Kaplan-Meier results using the Phoenix definition. HRs were calculated using proc PHReg.  Results:   Of 1,111 patients 891 achieved nadir prostate specific antigen less than 0.4 ng/ml, which correlated with a 5-year biochemical progression-free survival rate of 90.4% in those at low risk, 81.1% in those at intermediate risk and 73.6% in those at high risk. Nadir prostate specific antigen 0.4 ng/ml or greater was associated with 24-month biochemical failure of 29.2% in those at low risk, 46.4% in those at intermediate risk and 48.9% in those at high risk. Statistical analysis failed to reveal a superior prostate specific antigen end point compared to 0.4 ng/ml. HR findings supported the relevance of the end point of less than 0.4 ng/ml (p <0.0001).  Conclusions:   To our knowledge this study represents the first evidence-based definition of biochemical success after primary whole gland prostate cryoablation. Nadir prostate specific antigen less than 0.4 ng/ml was the best objective indicator of biochemical success. Nadir prostate specific antigen 0.4 ng/ml or greater was associated with less favorable biochemical progression, precluding the use of a higher nadir prostate specific antigen end point (HR 5.649, 95% CI 4.33-7.38, p <0.0001).""","""['David A Levy', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Ahmed ElShafei', 'Nirmal Krishnan', 'Asmaa Hatem', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Predictors of prostate-specific antigen biochemical recurrence in patients undergoing primary whole-gland prostate cryoablation.', 'Five-Year Biochemical Progression-Free Survival Following Salvage Whole-Gland Prostate Cryoablation: Defining Success with Nadir Prostate-Specific Antigen.', 'Primary cryoablation nadir prostate specific antigen and biochemical failure.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Review of primary and salvage cryoablation for prostate cancer.', 'Does the type of cryoprobe affect oncological and functional outcomes in men with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with primary whole gland prostate cryoablation?', 'Primary Whole-gland Cryoablation for Prostate Cancer: Biochemical Failure and Clinical Recurrence at 5.6 Years of Follow-up.', 'Surveillance after prostate focal therapy.', 'Prostate MR Imaging for Posttreatment Evaluation and Recurrence.', 'Imaging technique for real-time temperature monitoring during cryotherapy of lesions.']"""

Material and methods:   We performed a population based study of 51,321 men from PCBaSe between 2006 and 2011. Primary outcome measures were dispensed prescriptions of antibiotics for urinary tract infection and hospitalization with a discharge diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine risk factors for infection in men who underwent prostate biopsy.  Results:   During the 6 months before biopsy the background incidence of urinary tract infection was approximately 2%. Within 30 days after biopsy 6% of the men had a dispensed prescription for urinary tract antibiotics and 1% were hospitalized with infection. The strongest risk factors for an antibiotic prescription were prior infection (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.45-1.73), high Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.11-1.41) and diabetes (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17-1.49). Risk of an antibiotic prescription after biopsy decreased from 2006 to 2011 (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.90) but the risk of hospital admission increased (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.58-2.94).

Regarding oral cancers, one report indicated that nuclear EGFR is detected in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) on immunohistochemical staining, but did not mention the clinicopathological prognostic value in detail. Therefore, we investigated the expression of nuclear EGFR in OSCC cell lines and primary tumor specimens of tongue SCCs to see whether nuclear EGFR could be a useful prognostic value. We verified the expression level of nuclear EGFR in OSCC cell lines and observed an increase in the amount of nuclear EGFR upon EGF stimulation with the expression level reaching its peak after 15 minutes.

Methods:   One thousand seventy patients from the TROG 03.04 (RADAR) trial the EORTC QLQ C-30 and PR 25 questionnaires, and the International Prostate Cancer Symptom Score of the American Urological Association at baseline, 3, 7, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. Selected items from these scales were factor-analysed to identify a four-component solution for responses at 18 and 36 months, and these components were regressed against a single-item measuring LoM.  Results:   Depression-anxiety factor was the most powerful predictor of LoM at both time points, followed by sexual problems of ADT side effects (breast changes and hot flushes). Urinary dysfunction was not a consistent predictor of LoM. Depression-anxiety was also the most significant factor distinguishing between those men who reported LoM and those who did not.  Conclusions:   Although LoM is often reported as arising from ADT, the relative power of depression-anxiety in predicting LoM, both at the selected time points and using a time-lagged analysis, plus the finding that depression-anxiety was the most consistent difference between men who reported LoM and those who did not, argues for the presence of adverse mood states as being the key ingredient in deciding if PCa patients experience loss of their feelings of masculinity.""","""['Christopher F Sharpley', 'Vicki Birsika', 'James W Denham']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""[""'You know I've joined your club… I'm the hot flush boy': a qualitative exploration of hot flushes and night sweats in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer."", 'Relationship between hot flashes and distress in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Andropause syndrome in men treated for metastatic prostate cancer: a qualitative study of the impact of symptoms.', 'Complications of androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Measuring self-reported sexual function in men with prostate cancer.', 'The impact of hegemonic masculine ideals on self-esteem in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to ADT-naïve patients.', 'Germline testing and genetic counselling in prostate cancer.', 'The Cost of Bottling It Up: Emotion Suppression as a Mediator in the Relationship Between Anger and Depression Among Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Depression and Prostate Cancer: Examining Comorbidity and Male-Specific Symptoms.', 'Erectile dysfunction, masculinity, and psychosocial outcomes: a review of the experiences of men after prostate cancer treatment.']"""

However, the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this investigation, we demonstrate that NDRG1 inhibits the phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/37 and Thr41 and increases the levels of non-phosphorylated β-catenin at the plasma membrane in DU145 prostate cancer cells and HT29 colon cancer cells. The mechanism of inhibiting β-catenin phosphorylation involves the NDRG1-mediated upregulation of the GSK3β-binding protein FRAT1, which prevents the association of GSK3β with the Axin1-APC-CK1 destruction complex and the subsequent phosphorylation of β-catenin. Additionally, NDRG1 is shown to modulate the WNT-β-catenin pathway by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. This is mediated through an NDRG1-dependent reduction in the nuclear localization of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4), which is known to act as a transporter for β-catenin nuclear translocation.

Thus, in this study, we investigated the expression and hormonal regulation of ACPP gene in the reproductive tracts of chickens.

Furthermore, ACPP mRNA and protein were abundant in GE of ovarian carcinoma, but not in normal ovaries. Moreover, strong expression of ACPP protein was detected in epithelial cells of cancerous ovaries from women.

LPA receptor type 1 (LPA₁) signaling influences the pathophysiology of many diseases including cancer, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as lung, liver and kidney fibrosis. Therefore, LPA₁ is an attractive therapeutic target. However, most mammalian cells co-express multiple LPA receptors whose co-activation impairs the validation of target inhibition in patients because of missing LPA receptor-specific biomarkers. LPA₁ is known to induce IL-6 and IL-8 secretion, as also do LPA₂ and LPA₃. In this work, we first determined the LPA induced early-gene expression profile in three unrelated human cancer cell lines expressing different patterns of LPA receptors (PC3: LPA₁,₂,₆; MDA-MB-231: LPA1,2; MCF-7: LPA₂,₆). Among the set of genes upregulated by LPA only in LPA₁-expressing cells, we validated by QPCR and ELISA that upregulation of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) was inhibited by LPA₁-₃ antagonists (Ki16425, Debio0719). Upregulation and downregulation of HB-EGF mRNA was confirmed in vitro in human MDA-B02 breast cancer cells stably overexpressing LPA₁ (MDA-B02/LPA₁) and downregulated for LPA₁ (MDA-B02/shLPA1), respectively. At a clinical level, we quantified the expression of LPA₁ and HB-EGF by QPCR in primary tumors of a cohort of 234 breast cancer patients and found a significantly higher expression of HB-EGF in breast tumors expressing high levels of LPA₁. We also generated human xenograph prostate tumors in mice injected with PC3 cells and found that a five-day treatment with Ki16425 significantly decreased both HB-EGF mRNA expression at the primary tumor site and circulating human HB-EGF concentrations in serum. All together our results demonstrate that HB-EGF is a new and relevant biomarker with potentially high value in quantifying LPA₁ activation state in patients receiving anti-LPA₁ therapies.""","""['Marion David', 'Debashish Sahay', 'Florence Mege', 'Françoise Descotes', 'Raphaël Leblanc', 'Johnny Ribeiro', 'Philippe Clézardin', 'Olivier Peyruchaud']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor Antagonists and Cancer: The Current Trends, Clinical Implications, and Trials.', 'LPA2 (EDG4) mediates Rho-dependent chemotaxis with lower efficacy than LPA1 (EDG2) in breast carcinoma cells.', 'Lysophosphatidylethanolamine utilizes LPA(1) and CD97 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.', 'Activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes derived from rheumatoid arthritis via lysophosphatidic acid-lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 cascade.', 'Roles of LPA receptor signaling in breast cancer.', 'Identification of candidate hub genes correlated with the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis of prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Lysophosphatidic Acid Signaling and microRNAs: New Roles in Various Cancers.', 'Visualization of the binding between gintonin, a Panax ginseng-derived LPA receptor ligand, and the LPA receptor subtypes and transactivation of the EGF receptor.', 'Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor Antagonists and Cancer: The Current Trends, Clinical Implications, and Trials.', 'Roles for growth factors and mutations in metastatic dissemination.']"""

Methods:   Six hundred and sixty men (45-70 years) selected from 2906 participants of a population screening for prostate cancer were included in this study. Testosterone and the components of MS were assessed in all men. MS was diagnosed according to NCEP-ATP III criteria. Triglycerides (TG)/HDL-cholesterol (chol) index was calculated.  Results:   The presence of MS was inversely associated with testosterone (χ2, p < 0.001), independently of age (OR 0.802, CI 95%: 0.724-0.887, p < 0.0001). Hypertension was the most frequent abnormality observed followed by elevated TG and waist circumference (WC). Testosterone correlated positively with HDL-chol (r: 0.14, p < 0.0001) and negatively with body mass index (BMI)(r: -0.29, p < 0.0001), WC (r: -0.26, p < 0.0001), TG (r: -0.20, p < 0.0001), TG/HDL-chol (r: -0.20, p < 0.0001), glucose (r: -0.11, p = 0.005) and MS score (r: -0.23, p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Our results show that in men older than 45 years, as long as testosterone levels decline, the prevalence of MS increases, independently of age. The correlations found between testosterone and four of the five components of MS, as well as with BMI and TG/HDL-chol ratio, a surrogate marker of insulin resistance, suggest considering male hypogonadism as a determinant of developmental abnormalities typical of MS.""","""['Halina Grosman', 'Mónica Rosales', 'Bibiana Fabre', 'Carlos Nolazco', 'Osvaldo Mazza', 'Gabriela Berg', 'Viviana Mesch']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Aging Male""","""['Relative androgen deficiency in relation to obesity and metabolic status in older men.', 'Metabolic syndrome and its components in men.', 'Testosterone and obesity in men under the age of 40 years.', 'Waist circumference provides an indication of numerous cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with cerebral palsy.', 'Waist circumference is better associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL-c) than with body mass index (BMI) in adults with metabolic syndrome.', ""Serum lipid profile levels and semen quality: new insights and clinical perspectives for male infertility and men's health."", 'The Effect of a Combination of Eucommia ulmoides and Achyranthes japonica on Alleviation of Testosterone Deficiency in Aged Rat Models.', 'Association of Testosterone-Related Dietary Pattern with Testicular Function among Adult Men: A Cross-Sectional Health Screening Study in Taiwan.', 'Diabetogenic diet-induced insulin resistance associates with lipid droplet proteins and adipose tissue secretome, but not with sexual dimorphic adipose tissue fat accumulation in wistar rats.', 'Impact of Testosterone Deficiency and Testosterone Therapy on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Men with Metabolic Syndrome.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate discharge practice patterns and use of post-acute care after surgical admissions at CAHs.  Design, setting, and participants:   We used data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2005-2009) and American Hospital Association to perform a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing common inpatient surgical procedures at CAHs or non-CAHs.  Exposures:   The CAH status of the admitting hospital.  Main outcomes and measures:   Hospital transfer, discharge with post-acute care, or routine discharge.  Results:   Among the 1283 CAHs and 3612 non-CAHs included in the American Hospital Association annual survey, 34.8% and 36.4%, respectively, reported data to the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. For each of 6 common inpatient surgical procedures, a greater proportion of patients from CAHs were transferred to another hospital (P < .01); however, patients discharged from CAHs were less likely to receive post-acute care for all but 1 of the procedures examined (P < .01, except transurethral resection of prostate, P = .76). After adjustment for patient and hospital factors, the higher likelihood of transfer by CAHs vs non-CAHs persisted for 3 procedures: hip replacement (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.01-3.57), colorectal cancer resection (3.37; 2.23-5.09), and cholecystectomy (1.67; 1.27-2.19) (P < .05 for each), but differences in the use of post-acute care did not. In subset analyses, Medicare beneficiaries treated in CAHs were less likely to be discharged with post-acute care after hip fracture repair (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.89) and hip replacement (0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.96).  Conclusions and relevance:   Hospital transfers occur more often after surgical admissions at CAHs. However, the proportion of patients at CAHs using post-acute care is equal to or lower than that of patients treated in non-CAHs.

Here, we report that Ska1 over-expression promotes prostate tumourigenesis. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that Ska1 was over-expressed in human prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN), the most likely prostate cancer precursor, and adenocarcinomas. Up-regulation of Ska1 protein was also found to be tumour-specific in breast, lung and other common human cancers. Importantly, prostate-specific up-regulation of Ska1 in a transgenic mouse model resulted in spontaneous tumourigenesis. Furthermore, in addition to its abundance in spindle microtubules and the outer kinetochore interface during mitosis, Ska1 was enriched at centrosomes in cultured cells. Depletion of Ska1 caused a failure of centrosome duplication, whilst Ska1 over-expression led to centrosome amplification in human prostate epithelial cells via the induction of centriole over-duplication. These epithelial cells harbouring extra centrosomes switched from a non-tumourigenic to a tumourigenic state in nude mice.

The impact of the tumor microenvironment on 1,25D3 therapy in patients with CRPC has not been assessed. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), which is associated with the development of tumorigenic ""reactive stroma"" in prostate cancer, induced vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) expression in the human WPMY-1 prostate stromal cell line. Similarly, TGFβ enhanced 1,25D3-induced upregulation of CYP24A1, which metabolizes 1,25D3 and thereby limits VDR activity. Ablation of Hic-5, a TGFβ-inducible nuclear receptor coregulator, inhibited basal VDR expression, 1,25D3-induced CYP24A1 expression and metabolism of 1,25D3 and TGFβ-enhanced CYP24A1 expression. A Hic-5-responsive sequence was identified upstream (392-451 bp) of the CYP24A1 transcription start site that is occupied by VDR only in the presence of Hic-5. Ectopic expression of Hic-5 sensitized LNCaP prostate tumor cells to growth-inhibitory effects of 1,25D3 independent of CYP24A1. The sensitivity of Hic-5-expressing LNCaP cells to 1,25D3-induced growth inhibition was accentuated in coculture with Hic-5-ablated WPMY-1 cells. Therefore, these findings indicate that the search for mechanisms to sensitize prostate cancer cells to the antiproliferative effects of VDR ligands needs to account for the impact of VDR activity in the tumor microenvironment.  Implications:   Hic-5 acts as a coregulator with distinct effects on VDR transactivation, in prostate cancer and stromal cells, and may exert diverse effects on adjuvant therapy designed to exploit VDR activity in prostate cancer.""","""['Joshua D Solomon', 'Marjet D Heitzer', 'Teresa T Liu', 'Jan H Beumer', 'Robert A Parise', 'Daniel P Normolle', 'Damien A Leach', 'Grant Buchanan', 'Donald B DeFranco']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Epithelial Hic-5/ARA55 expression contributes to prostate tumorigenesis and castrate responsiveness.', 'Potent antiproliferative effects of 25-hydroxy-16-ene-23-yne-vitamin D₃ that resists the catalytic activity of both CYP27B1 and CYP24A1.', 'The prostate cancer TMPRSS2:ERG fusion synergizes with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to induce CYP24A1 expression-limiting VDR signaling.', 'Metabolism and Action of 25-Hydroxy-19-nor-Vitamin D₃ in Human Prostate Cells.', 'Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma?', 'African American Prostate Cancer Displays Quantitatively Distinct Vitamin D Receptor Cistrome-transcriptome Relationships Regulated by BAZ1A.', 'Physiological and pathological roles of\xa0Hic‑5 in several organs (Review).', 'TGF-β signaling proteins and CYP24A1 may serve as surrogate markers for progesterone calcitriol treatment in ovarian and endometrial cancers of different histological types.', 'Anti-Tumor Effects of Ginsenoside 20(S)-Protopanaxadiol and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Combination in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of the Local Inflammatory Environment on Mucosal Vitamin D Metabolism and Signaling in Chronic Inflammatory Lung Diseases.']"""

Method:   New gout patients without a history of cancer were included from 1998 to 2000, and they had been followed up from 2001 to 2008 to observe the incidence of cancers from national outpatient records in Taiwan.  Results:   A total of 8408 male gout patients and 25,010 male controls were included by matching gout patients' age and year and month of first diagnosis during the including period. The mean ages at diagnosis were 51.03 ± 14.52 and 50.90 ± 14.45 years for gout patients and controls, respectively. The overall incidence of all cancers was 9.82 cases per 1000 person-years among gout patients compared to 4.35 cases per 1000 person-years among controls after 8 years of follow-up. The age-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were 2.26 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.06-2.49], 3.31 (95% CI 2.55-4.31), 3.14 (95% CI 2.12-4.64), and 2.18 (95% CI 1.34-3.56) for all cancers, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and renal cancer, respectively. The cumulative hazard ratios (HRs) were significantly higher in gout patients than in controls with regard to developing prostate, bladder, and renal cancers (all p < 0.001).

Results:   A total of 1062 patients (mean age 67.1 years) were enrolled in the analysis. A total of 230 men (21.7%) had a positive biopsy. In the overall study sample, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of serum prostate-specific antigen for predicting prostate cancer on biopsy were 0.584 and 0.633 for non-obese and obese men, respectively (P = 0.234). However, the area under the curve for prostate-specific antigen density in predicting cancer status showed a significant difference (non-obese 0.696, obese 0.784; P = 0.017).  Conclusions:   There seems to be a significant difference in the ability of prostate-specific antigen density to predict biopsy results between non-obese and obese men.

Patients and methods:   From a prospective single surgeon database perioperative, oncological and functional outcome data was collected from the first 207 consecutive patients who underwent LRP immediately after a 12-month LRP Fellowship in a high-volume centre by the primary surgeon (M.L.J.). A training case was defined as the successful completion of at least two of 10 steps by a training Fellow. Perioperative and oncological outcomes were compared in training and non-training cohorts and overall learning curve was assessed by comparing consecutive 50-patient cohorts.  Results:   In all, 31% of cases were training cases with a median (range) of 7 (2-10) steps of 10 steps performed by the training Fellow. Operative times were significantly longer in training cases (mean 269 vs 209 min; P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in perioperative outcomes of length of stay (2.7 vs 2.6 days), transfusion rates (3.1% vs 2.1%), major complication (Clavien >3a) rates (1.6% vs 2.1%) or positive surgical margins (PSMs: pT2 2.8% vs 15.3% and pT3 52.0% vs 45.1%) between training and non-training groups, respectively. Overall, there were two open conversions (1.0%).

After one experienced surgeon had established this technique, three surgeons who were less experienced in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy utilized this method for 50 consecutive robot-assisted radical prostatectomy cases. The pathological results and the time required to transect the anterior bladder wall were evaluated. There were no cases of positive resection margin on the site of bladder neck. The mean resection time was not significantly different when comparing less experienced surgeons with the experienced surgeon (P = 0.29).

Research design:   The sample comprised elderly men, aged 66 years and older, extracted from SEER-Medicare data, between 2004 and 2009 (N=73,563).

Results:   Over half of men received some form of cancer-directed treatment, irrespective of comorbid condition. Men who have congestive heart failure (CHF) or multiple comorbid conditions were less likely to be treated, whereas men with diabetes were more likely to be treated. With the exception of men with CHF, men with comorbid conditions and low-risk disease received no survival benefit from any type of treatment.

However, little is known about the impact of prostate tissue fatty acid content on prostate cancer progression. We hypothesized that compared with the estimated dietary ω-3 fatty acids intake and the ω-3 fatty acids levels measured in red blood cells (RBC), the prostate tissue ω-3 fatty acid content is more strongly related to prostate cancer progression. We present the initial observations from baseline data of a phase II clinical trial conducted in a cohort of 48 untreated men affected with low-risk prostate cancer, managed under active surveillance. These men underwent a first repeat biopsy session within 6 months after the initial diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer, at which time 29% of the men had progressed from a Gleason score of 6 to a Gleason score of 7.

Cytoplasmic hnRNPA2 is reported in aggressive cancers, but is functionally uncharacterized. We explored the role of hnRNPA2 in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   hnRNPA2 function/localization/expression in PCa was determined using biochemical approaches (colony forming/proliferation/luciferase reporter assays/flow cytometry/immunohistocytochemistry). Binding of hnRNPA2 within cancer-relevant 3'-UTR mRNAs was identified by bioinformatics.  Results:   RNAi-mediated knockdown of hnRNPA2 reduced colony forming and proliferation, while hnRNPA2 overexpression increased proliferation of PCa cells. Nuclear hnRNPA2 is overexpressed in high-grade clinical PCa, and is also observed in the cytoplasm in some cases. Ectopic expression of a predominantly cytoplasmic variant hnRNPA2-ΔRGG also increased PCa cell proliferation, suggesting that cytoplasmic hnRNPA2 may also be functionally relevant in PCa. Consistent with its known cytoplasmic roles, hnRNPA2 was associated with 3'-UTR mRNAs of several cancer-relevant mRNAs including β-catenin (CTNNB1). Both wild-type hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA2-ΔRGG act on CTNNB1 3'-UTR mRNA, increasing endogenous CTNNB1 mRNA expression and β-catenin protein expression and nuclear localization.  Conclusion:   Nuclear and cytoplasmic hnRNPA2 are present in PCa and appear to be functionally important. Cytoplasmic hnRNPA2 may affect the cancer cell phenotype through 3'-UTR mRNA-mediated regulation of β-catenin expression and other cancer-relevant genes.""","""['Jacqueline Stockley', 'M Eugenia M Villasevil', 'Colin Nixon', 'Imran Ahmad', 'Hing Y Leung', 'Prabhakar Rajan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""RNA Biol""","""['Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 is a negative regulator of human breast cancer metastasis by maintaining the balance of multiple genes and pathways.', 'Induction of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase by miR-138 via up-regulation of β-catenin in prostate cancer cells.', 'hnRNPA2/B1 Ameliorates LPS-Induced Endothelial Injury through NF-κB Pathway and VE-Cadherin/β-Catenin Signaling Modulation In Vitro.', ""hnRNPA2/B1 and nELAV proteins bind to a specific U-rich element in CDK5R1 3'-UTR and oppositely regulate its expression."", 'MEN1 silencing aggravates tumorigenic potential of AR-independent prostate cancer cells through nuclear translocation and activation of JunD and β-catenin.', 'CSNK1D-mediated phosphorylation of HNRNPA2B1 induces miR-25-3p/miR-93-5p maturation to promote prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration through m6A-dependent manner.', 'SUMOylation of HNRNPA2B1 modulates RPA dynamics during unperturbed replication and genotoxic stress responses.', 'Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B: an emerging group of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets.', 'Functions and mechanisms of N6‑methyladenosine in prostate cancer (Review).', 'The RGG motif proteins: Interactions, functions, and regulations.']"""

As the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways have an important role in the pathogenesis of HNSCC, we investigated their involvement in cetuximab resistance.  Methods:   Different human squamous cancer cell lines sensitive or resistant to cetuximab were tested for the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-05212384 (PKI-587), alone and in combination, both in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Treatment with PKI-587 enhances sensitivity to cetuximab in vitro, even in the condition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resistance. The combination of the two drugs inhibits cells survival, impairs the activation of signalling pathways and induces apoptosis. Interestingly, although significant inhibition of proliferation is observed in all cell lines treated with PKI-587 in combination with cetuximab, activation of apoptosis is evident in sensitive but not in resistant cell lines, in which autophagy is pre-eminent. In nude mice xenografted with resistant Kyse30 cells, the combined treatment significantly reduces tumour growth and prolongs mice survival.  Conclusions:   Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition has an important role in the rescue of cetuximab resistance.

Experimental validation shows that FOXM1 and CENPF function synergistically to promote tumor growth by coordinated regulation of target gene expression and activation of key signaling pathways associated with prostate cancer malignancy.

The Cu(II) ions are in a distorted bipyramidal environment with a somewhat twisted square basis, cis-coordinated at their core N2O2 basis to two carboxylate oxygen and two terminal benzimidazole nitrogen atoms. Cu8Tlm16 has a toroidal-like shape with a hydrophobic nanometer hole, and their crystal packing defines nanochannels that extend along the crystal c-axis. Several biological activities of the complex and the parent ligand were examined in vitro. The antioxidant measurements indicate that the complex behaves as a superoxide dismutase mimic with improved superoxide scavenger power as compared with native sartan. The capacity of telmisartan and its copper complex to expand human mesangial cells (previously contracted by angiotensin II treatment) is similar to each other. The antihypertensive effect of the compounds is attributed to the strongest binding affinity to angiotensin II type 1 receptor and not to the antioxidant effects. The cytotoxic activity of the complex and that of its components was determined against lung cancer cell line A549 and three prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, and DU 145). The complex displays some inhibitory effect on the A549 line and a high viability decrease on the LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) line.

Nevertheless, radiotherapy treatment is linked to a low risk of low grade toxicity and only 20-40% of biochemical relapse are observed after prostatectomy even if there is one involved surgical margin. So, it could be reasonable to propose a close monitoring of the PSA (""Prostate Specific Antigen"") and adjuvant radiotherapy once the PSA is superior to 0 ng/ml.

We report in this study, the first data from the NCR for Khartoum State for the period 2009-2010. The NCR staff used passive and active approaches to collect data on cancer diagnosed by all means in Khartoum State. Rates were age standardized to the 2010 Sudan Standard Population and 1966 and 2000 World Standard Population and expressed per 100,000 populations. During 2009-2010, 6771 new cancer cases were registered. Of those, 3646 (53.8%) cases were in women and 3125 (46.2%) were in men. The most commonly diagnosed cancer among women was breast followed by leukemia, cervix, and ovary, and among men it was prostate cancer followed by leukemia, lymphoma, oral, colorectal, and liver. In children less than 15 years of age, leukemia was the most common cancer followed lymphoma, and cancer of the eye, bone, kidney, and the brain. The overall age-standardized rate (ASR) per 100,000 population was higher in women (124.3) than in men (90.8) using 2010 Sudan Standard Population. Similarly, it was higher in women (188.6 and 206.3 per 100,000 population) than in men (145.4 and 160.0 per 100,000 population) using 1966 and 2000 World Standard Population, respectively. The data from NCR indicated that prostate and breast as the most commonly diagnosed cancer sites in men and women in Khartoum, while cancer of the cervix trailed behind portraying a cancer picture similar to that of the developed world. Despite the study limitations, the NCR data gave a fair representation of cancer profile of Khartoum State and underscored the need for high-quality cancer registries in Sudan.""","""['Intisar E Saeed', 'Hsin-Yi Weng', 'Kamal H Mohamed', 'Sulma I Mohammed']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['A Five-year Survey of Cancer Prevalence in Sudan.', 'Cancer incidence in Nigeria: a report from population-based cancer registries.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Epidemiology of cancer among Hispanics in the United States.', 'Part I: cancer in Sudan—burden, distribution, and trends breast, gynecological, and prostate cancers.', 'Cancer diagnosis in areas of conflict.', 'Management of Helicobacter pylori among medical doctors working in Khartoum, Sudan 2019: a cross-sectional study.', 'Knowledge of safe handling, administration, and waste management of chemotherapeutic drugs among oncology nurses working at Khartoum Oncology Hospital, Sudan.', 'Gene polymorphisms of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in Sudanese patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Translation, linguistic validation and reliability of FACT-H&N questionnaire in Oral Cancer patients in Sudan.']"""

Here, we describe the identification of a novel tryptophyllin type 3 peptide, PhT-3, from the extracts of skin of the orange-legged monkey frog, Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis, and molecular cloning of its precursor-encoding cDNA from a cDNA library constructed from the same skin sample. Full primary structural characterization was achieved using a combination of direct Edman degradation, mass spectrometry and deduction from cloned skin-derived cDNA. The open-reading frame of the precursor cDNA was found to consist of 63 amino acid residues. The mature peptide arising from this precursor contains a post-translationally modified N-terminal pyroglutamate (pGlu) residue, formed from acid-mediated cyclization of an N-terminal Gln (Q) residue, and with the structure: pGlu-Asp-Lys-Pro-Phe-Trp-Pro-Pro-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Pro-Met.

Here we report the results pertaining to the feasibility of conducting such research.  Methods:   In this cross-sectional study, we recruited long-term, disease-free survivors from two mature EORTC clinical trials in testicular and prostate cancer from centres in Northern and Southern Europe, and the United Kingdom (UK).  Results:   A number of challenges were encountered in recruiting participating centres, obtaining medical ethical approval and in recruiting survivors and collecting the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data in a timely manner. The efficiency with which the study could be conducted varied widely across centres and countries. Time to obtain medical ethical approval for the study ranged from 1.5 to 25 months. We encountered most problems with ethical approval in the UK, Italy and Belgium. In most cases, data collection was completed within 3 months (range 10 weeks-1 year). Completed questionnaires were obtained from 68% and 56%, respectively, of the testicular and prostate cancer survivors who were approached.  Conclusions:   HRQoL research among long-term survivors of EORTC phase III clinical trials is possible, but the process of ethical approval and data collection is a lengthy one. To minimise many of the logistical problems, long-term follow-up of patients should be an integral part of future clinical trials.

Methods:   Data on the first 50 consecutive patients to undergo RAPN by a single surgeon were reviewed. Demographic, perioperative, tumour characteristics and Clavien complications were collected in addition to oncological follow-up and renal function monitoring.  Results:   Mean age was 58.2 ± 10.4 years, body mass index was 28.8 ± 4.5 kg/m(2) and Charlson Co-morbidity Index was 4.6 ± 1.2. Tumour diameter was 31 ± 13 mm and RENAL score was 6.8 ± 1.5. Average total operative time was 151 ± 32.7 min, estimated blood loss was 171.1 ± 185.8 mL, warm ischaemia time was 17.8 ± 6.7 min and length of hospital stay was 3 ± 0.9 days. There were seven Clavien complications and no deaths. Estimated glomerular filtration rate did not decrease significantly post-operatively (P = 0.8); and there was 14.6% upstaging of chronic kidney disease scoring although no patient required dialysis. There were no positive malignant surgical margins, and to date no patient has evidence of disease recurrence. Of 50 patients, 54% had a minimum follow-up of 6 months and 28% had a minimum follow-up of 1 year.  Conclusion:   We report the largest RAPN study in Australia or New Zealand to date.

PSA is expressed in normal range in 20 to 25 per cent of prostate cancer cases even in presence of high grade Gleason score. This study was aimed to assess the influence of genetic variants exhibited by PSA and androgen receptor (AR) genes towards the variable expression of PSA in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Pre-treatment serum PSA levels from 101 prostate cancer cases were retrieved from medical record. PSA genotype analysis in promoter region and AR gene microsatellite Cytosine/Adenine/Guanine (CAG) repeat analysis in exon 1 region was performed using DNA sequencing and fragment analysis techniques.  Results:   A total of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PSA promoter region were noted. Only two SNPs viz., 158G/A (P<0.001) in the proximal promoter region and -3845G/A (P<0.001) in enhancer region showed significant association with serum PSA levels. The carriers of homozygous GG genotype (P<0.001) at both of these polymorphic sites showed higher expression of PSA whereas homozygous AA genotype (P<0.001) carriers demonstrated lower PSA levels. The combination effect of PSA genotypes along with stratified AR CAG repeats lengths (long, intermediate and short) was also studied. The homozygous GG genotype along with AR long CAG repeats and homozygous AA genotype along with AR short CAG repeats at position -3845 and -158 showed strong interaction and thus influenced serum PSA levels.  Interpretation & conclusions:   The genetic variants exhibited by PSA gene at positions -3845G/A and -158G/A may be accountable towards wide variability of serum PSA levels in prostate cancer. Also the preferential binding of G and A alleles at these polymorphic sites along with AR long and short CAG repeats may contribute towards PSA expression.""","""['Sushant V Chavan', 'Anurupa Maitra', 'Nobhojit Roy', 'Padma R Chavan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Indian J Med Res""","""['Genetic determinants of serum prostate-specific antigen levels in healthy men from a multiethnic cohort.', 'Polymorphic CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene, prostate-specific antigen polymorphism and prostate cancer risk.', 'Susceptibility to prostate cancer: interaction between genotypes at the androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen loci.', 'Linkage disequilibrium between the androgen receptor gene CAG and GGC repeats in the African-American population.', 'Association of gene polymorphisms of KLK3 and prostate cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Genetic association between PSA-158G/A polymorphism and the susceptibility of benign prostatic hyperplasia: a meta-analysis.', 'Allelic variability in PSA & AR genes: a novel biomarker on the horizon for carcinoma prostate.']"""

Conversely, practice patterns outside of such protocols are unknown. The aim of this study was to capture the current AS treatment patterns for localized prostate cancer in patients managed by office-based urologists compared to patients treated at a tertiary care center.  Methods and materials:   Two prospective cohorts were investigated: 361 AS arm patients of the German Hormonal treatment, Active surveillance, Radiation therapy, OP, Watchful waiting (HAROW) study, an observational health service study and 387 protocol-based AS patients treated at the Department of Urology of the Kantonsspital Aarau, Switzerland were included. Observational non-protocol HAROW versus on-protocol Kantonsspital Aarau (KSA) was compared, and active-treatment-free survival represented the primary outcome.  Results:   Study population of the observational HAROW versus tertiary care protocol-based KSA cohorts differed statistically significantly regarding age (p < 0.001) and proportion of patients meeting the Chism criteria (p < 0.001). In stratified analyses, AFTS at 1 and 2 years was, respectively, 87.7 % (95 % CI 84.0-91.7) and 75.0 % (95 % CI 69.7-80.8) in HAROW patients compared to 90.8 % (95 % CI 87.8-93.9) and 75.3 % (95 % CI 70.7-80.1) for patients in the KSA cohort (p = 0.97).

Subjects were followed from the first KP enrollment after January 01, 1996 for KP Northern California (KPNC) and January 01, 2000 for KP Southern California until the earliest of prostate cancer diagnosis, loss to follow-up, or December 31, 2007. Poisson regression was used to compare cancer rates by HIV status adjusting for age, race, smoking, alcohol/drug abuse, overweight/obesity, and diabetes. For the KPNC subset, we analyzed additional available data by HIV status on testosterone deficiency, and on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests as a proxy for cancer screening.  Results:   The prostate cancer incidence rate was 102/100,000 person-years in HIV-positive men (n = 74 cases) and 131/100,000 person-years in HIV-negative men (n = 1195 cases), with an adjusted rate ratio of 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.57 to 0.92; P = 0.008).

Interfractional variations in dose-volume metrics were evaluated under six different set-up error corrections, including tattoo, bony anatomy, and four different target matching groups. Set-up errors were incorporated into planning the isocenter position, and dose distributions were recalculated on CBCT images. These processes were repeated under two different PTV margin settings. In the on-line bony anatomy matching groups, systematic error (∑) was 0.3 mm, 1.4 mm, and 0.3 mm in the left-right, anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior directions, respectively. ∑ in three successive off-line target matchings was finally comparable with that in the on-line bony anatomy matching in the AP direction.

We measured nuclear immunostaining in the entire tumor area and based the results on the percentage of positive tumor cells. The preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 8.68±5.16 ng/mL (mean±SD). Cyclin D1 staining was positive (cyclin D1 expression in >5% of tumor cells) in 64 cases (75.4%) and negative (cyclin D1 expression in ≤5% of tumor cells) in 21 cases (including 15 cases with no immunostaining). Normal prostate tissues were negative for cyclin D1. Among patients with a high-grade Gleason score (≥7), 86% of patients demonstrated cyclin D1 immunostaining of >5% (P<0.05). In the crude analysis of cyclin D1 expression, the high-grade Gleason score group showed a mean expression of 39.6%, compared to 26.9% in the low-grade Gleason score group (P<0.05).

Moreover, the laminin γ1 (LAMC1) gene was a candidate target of miR-29s regulation. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-29s directly regulated LAMC1. Silencing of LAMC1 significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in cancer cells, and LAMC1 was upregulated in PCa. miR-29s acted as tumor suppressors, contributing to cancer cell migration and invasion and directly targeting laminin signaling. Recognition of tumor-suppressive miRNA-mediated cancer pathways provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of PCa oncogenesis and metastasis, and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for treating this disease.""","""['Rika Nishikawa', 'Yusuke Goto', 'Satoko Kojima', 'Hideki Enokida', 'Takeshi Chiyomaru', 'Takashi Kinoshita', 'Shinichi Sakamoto', 'Miki Fuse', 'Masayuki Nakagawa', 'Yukio Naya', 'Tomohiko Ichikawa', 'Naohiko Seki']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['The Role of miR-29s in Human Cancers-An Update.', 'Tumour-suppressive microRNA-29s inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion by targeting laminin-integrin signalling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Tumor-suppressive microRNA-29a inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting HSP47 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Tumor-suppressive microRNA-218 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting of LASP1 in prostate cancer.', 'The miR-29 family: genomics, cell biology, and relevance to renal and cardiovascular injury.', 'EPRS1 correlates with malignant progression in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The Role of miR-29s in Human Cancers-An Update.', 'Promising Biomarkers in Head and Neck Cancer: The Most Clinically Important miRNAs.', 'LAMC1-mediated preadipocytes differentiation promoted peritoneum pre-metastatic niche formation and gastric cancer metastasis.', 'The Expression of Signaling Genes in Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

This functional contrast agent is intended for the specific and non-invasive detection of prostate cancer cells that are PSMA positive, a marker implicated in prostate tumor progression and metastasis. The two-step carbodiimide reaction used to conjugate the antibody to the nanoparticle was efficient and we obtained an elemental iron content of 1958 ± 611 per antibody. Immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry showed that the conjugated muJ591:MIRB complex specifically binds to PSMA-positive (LNCaP) cells. The muJ591:MIRB complex reduced cell adhesion and cell proliferation on LNCaP cells and caused apoptosis as tested by Annexin V assay, suggesting anti-tumorigenic characteristics. Measurements of the T2 relaxation time of the muJ591:MIRB complex using a 400 MHz Innova NMR and a multi-echo spin-echo sequence on a 3T MRI (Achieva, Philips) showed a significant T2 relaxation time reduction for the muJ591:MIRB complex, with a reduced T2 relaxation time as a function of the iron concentration. PSMA-positive cells treated with muJ591:MIRB showed a significantly shorter T2 relaxation time as obtained using a 3T MRI scanner. The reduction in T2 relaxation time for muJ591:MIRB, combined with its specificity against PSMA+LNCaP cells, suggest its potential as a biologically-specific MR contrast agent.""","""['David Bates', 'Suraj Abraham', 'Michael Campbell', 'Ingeborg Zehbe', 'Laura Curiel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Mesenchymal stem cell labeling and in vitro MR characterization at 1.5 T of new SPIO contrast agent: Molday ION Rhodamine-B™.', 'Quantitative FeMRI determination of the dynamics of PSMA-targeted SPIONs discriminates among prostate tumor xenografts based on their PSMA expression.', 'In Vivo Molecular MRI Imaging of Prostate Cancer by Targeting PSMA with Polypeptide-Labeled Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles.', 'Targeted systemic therapy of prostate cancer with a monoclonal antibody to prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Glu-Urea-Lys Scaffold Functionalized Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Targeting PSMA for In Vivo Molecular MRI of Prostate Cancer.', 'Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Visualization of Prostate Cancer in MRI.', 'Molecular MR Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeted Radionuclide Therapy of Prostate Cancer-From Basic Research to Clinical Perspectives.', 'Magnetic Nanoparticles in Cancer Therapy and Diagnosis.']"""

However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying neuroendocrine differentiation induced by IL-6.  Methods:   Immunoblotting was performed to determine the status of RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and of neuroendocrine markers such as Neuron-specific Enolase (NSE), chromogranin A and synaptophysin in LNCaP cells treated with IL-6. To further study the impact of REST-mediated repression on neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in LNCaP cells, either wild-type REST or a dominant-positive form of REST, REST-VP16, in which both repressor domains of REST were replaced with the activation domain of the herpes simplex virus protein VP16, was introduced into LNCaP cells.  Results:   In this study, we show that REST is suppressed in IL-6-induced neuroendocrine differentiation in LNCaP cells. Overexpression of exogenous REST abrogated IL-6-induced NED in prostate cancer cells. Expression of the recombinant REST-VP16 fusion protein activated REST target genes and other neuronal differentiation genes and produced neuronal physiological properties. In addition, REST protein turnover was accelerated in IL-6 induced NE differentiated LNCaP cells via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the deubiquitylase HAUSP, indicating that pathway(s) priming REST degradation may be involved in IL-6 induced NE differentiation.

We report our findings for cancers other than prostate and make selected comparisons to our previously reported prostate cancer cohort.  Methods:   Data were collected from both referring and interpreting physicians before and after NaF PET in patients (age ≥ 65 y) stratified for initial staging (IS; n = 570), for suspected first osseous metastasis (FOM; n = 1,814; breast, 781 [43%]; lung, 380 [21%]; and all other cancers, 653 [36%]), and for suspected progression of osseous metastasis (POM; n = 435).  Results:   The dominant indication was bone pain. If NaF PET were unavailable, conventional bone scintigraphy would have been ordered in 85% of patients. In IS, 28% of patients had suspected or confirmed nonosseous metastasis. If neither conventional bone scintigraphy nor NaF PET were available, referring physicians would have ordered other advanced imaging more than 70% of the time rather than initiate treatment for suspected FOM (11%-16%) or POM (18%-22%). When intended management was classified as either treatment or nontreatment, the intended management change for each cancer type was highest in POM, lower in IS, and lowest in FOM. For suspected FOM, intended management change was lower in breast (24%), lung (36%), or other cancers (31%), compared with prostate cancer (44%) (P < 0.0001), but the NaF PET finding (normal/benign/equivocal, probable, or definite metastases) frequencies were similar across cancer types. After normal/benign/equivocal PET results, 15% of breast, 30% lung, and 38% prostate cancer patients had treatment, likely reflecting differences in management of nonosseous disease. For patients with definite metastasis on NaF PET, nonprostate, compared with prostate, cancer patients had post-PET plans for more frequent biopsy, alternative imaging, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. In the smaller IS and POM cohorts, differences among cancer types were not significant.  Conclusion:   Overall, NaF PET led to change in intended management in a substantial fraction of nonprostate cancer patients. In the setting of suspected FOM, NaF PET had a lower immediate impact on the treat/nontreat decision in nonprostate versus prostate cancer patients, which is consistent with current practice guidelines.""","""['Bruce E Hillner', 'Barry A Siegel', 'Lucy Hanna', 'Fenghai Duan', 'Anthony F Shields', 'Bruce Quinn', 'R Edward Coleman']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Hospice Admission and Survival After 18F-Fluoride PET Performed for Evaluation of Osseous Metastatic Disease in the National Oncologic PET Registry.', 'Intended Versus Inferred Treatment After 18F-Fluoride PET Performed for Evaluation of Osseous Metastatic Disease in the National Oncologic PET Registry.', 'Impact of 18F-fluoride PET in patients with known prostate cancer: initial results from the National Oncologic PET Registry.', 'The Role of 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT Bone Scans in the Diagnosis of Metastatic Bone Disease from Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Newer PET application with an old tracer: role of 18F-NaF skeletal PET/CT in oncologic practice.', 'Local failure after definitive radiation treatment of lymph-node positive prostate cancer: supporting the use of novel imaging techniques to personalize treatment options.', 'Site specific measurements of bone formation using 18F sodium fluoride PET/CT.', 'Hospice Admission and Survival After 18F-Fluoride PET Performed for Evaluation of Osseous Metastatic Disease in the National Oncologic PET Registry.', 'Intended Versus Inferred Treatment After 18F-Fluoride PET Performed for Evaluation of Osseous Metastatic Disease in the National Oncologic PET Registry.', '(18)F-fluoride PET/CT in clinical practice.']"""

Multivariate linear regression and multivariate Cox models evaluated factors associated with the length of radiotherapy course and hospice duration.  Results:   The median length of palliative radiotherapy was 14 days, and the median hospice duration was 13 days. The course of palliative radiotherapy was longer than hospice duration in 48% of the patients. Breast and lung cancer were associated with longer courses of radiotherapy and shorter stays on hospice. Patients treated in freestanding radiation centers had longer courses of radiotherapy. For these groups, a longer radiotherapy course was not associated with longer hospice duration.

As novel robotic technologies diffuse into surgical practice, developing safe apprenticeships remains a challenge.  Patients and methods:   Between October 2008 and November 2010, 90 RALPs were prospectively divided into three phases: Proctored, Independent, and Instructor. During the first 30 Proctored cases, an experienced robotic surgeon from the affiliated university-based hospital mentored a robotic novice attending surgeon with previous open retropubic and laparoscopic experience. The novice surgeon gained proficiency during the next 30 Independent cases, then introduced increasing resident participation during the last Instructor 30 cases. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, operative measures, and length of hospital stay were compared. Functional outcomes were assessed using the Sexual Health Inventory for Men and an incontinence questionnaire. We used independent t test, analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher exact test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson chi-square tests for comparison in these patient populations.  Results:   All groups were similar in age, clinical T-stage, and D'Amico Risk Group. Preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels were significantly higher (P<0.001) and prostates were larger (P=0.044) in the middle Instructor Phase. The early Proctored Phase had the lowest Gleason scores and the lowest body mass indexes. Despite these differences favoring the Proctored Phase, immediate operative outcomes were similar with respect to safety, oncologic, and functional parameters.  Conclusions:   In the VASDHS cohort, RALPs were performed safely under the supervision of a newly proctored attending surgeon. Although longer follow-up could reveal subtle differences between groups, overall follow-up was similar to most existing studies. Extended mentorship by an experienced surgeon is a viable model for achieving proficiency in RALP in a setting such as a VA hospital affiliated with an academic hospital and increasing access to care for the veteran patient population.""","""['Elana Godebu', 'Jeffrey M Woldrich', 'Seth A Cohen', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Erik L Owens', 'Kyoko Sakamoto']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', 'The neurovascular structure-adjacent frozen-section examination (NeuroSAFE) approach to nerve sparing in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in a British setting - a\xa0prospective observational comparative study.', 'Radical prostatectomy: initial experience with robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures at a large university hospital.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Comparison of retropubic, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: who is the winner?']"""

A mathematical analysis of neural autoantibody clusters was performed in 78,889 patients undergoing evaluation for a suspected paraneoplastic autoimmune neurologic disorder. Tumor predictive autoantibody profiles were confirmed in sera from patients with histologically proven tonsillar cancer, thymoma, and lung cancer.  Patients and methods:   Of note, 78,889 patient sera were tested for 15 defined neural autoantibodies (1.2 million tests). The observed and hypothesized frequencies of autoantibody clusters were compared and their tumor associations defined. A tumor validation study comprised serum from 368 patients with a variety of tumors (thymoma, lung, or tonsil).  Results:   Informative oncological associations included (i) thymoma in 85% of patients with muscle striational, acetylcholine receptor antibodies plus CRMP5 autoantibodies; (ii) lung carcinoma in 80% with both P/Q-type and N-type calcium channel antibodies plus SOX1-IgG; and (iii) in men, prostate carcinoma frequency more than doubled when striational and muscle AChR specificities were accompanied by ganglionic AChR antibody. In women, amphiphysin-IgG alone was associated commonly with breast carcinoma, but amphiphysin-IgG, coexisting with antineuronal nuclear autoantibody-type 1 or CRMP5-IgG, was associated with lung cancer (P < 0.0001). In the validation cohorts, many tumor-associated profiles were encountered that matched the clusters identified in the screening study (e.g., 15% of thymoma patients had striational, acetylcholine receptor antibodies plus collapsin response-mediator protein-5 autoantibodies).

Methods and materials:   For 12 prostate cases, 9 carbon ion treatment plans were prepared using 3 scanned-beam settings (spot sizes of 6, 7 and 9 mm and, respectively, raster pitches of 2, 2 and 3 mm) for 3 planning margins (3, 6 and 9 mm). Plans were recomputed in presence of 5 intrafraction prostate motion scenarios with and without intra-beam motion compensation.  Results:   For 6 mm margin and 7 mm spot, the median (max) CTV D(95%) change was -0.2 (-2.6) pp (percentual points) with pure drift motion, -3.8 (-6.0) pp and -2.8 (-3.1) pp in transient motion scenarios and -4.8 (-7.7) pp and -1.8 (-5.7) pp in mixed motion scenarios. No particular raster setting brought distinct advantage, while planning margin expansion showed statistically significant effects for drift-dominated scenarios. Intra-beam motion compensation yielded improved CTV coverage.  Conclusion:   Intrafraction prostate motion can lead to marked target coverage deterioration, dependent on individual motion patterns, which can be only partially avoided through planning-time countermeasures. Among possible delivery-time countermeasures, intra-beam motion compensation is capable of improving target coverage.""","""['Filippo Ammazzalorso', 'Sebastian Graef', 'Uli Weber', 'Andrea Wittig', 'Rita Engenhart-Cabillic', 'Urszula Jelen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Effect of intrafraction prostate motion on proton pencil beam scanning delivery: a quantitative assessment.', 'Robustness against interfraction prostate movement in scanned ion beam radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric robustness against setup errors in charged particle radiotherapy of skull base tumors.', 'Management of organ motion in scanned ion beam therapy.', 'Organ motion and its management.', 'A step towards international prospective trials in carbon ion radiotherapy: investigation of factors influencing dose distribution in the facilities in operation based on a case of skull base chordoma.', 'A simulation study on the dosimetric benefit of real-time motion compensation in spot-scanning proton therapy for prostate.', 'Particle therapy of moving targets-the strategies for tumour motion monitoring and moving targets irradiation.']"""

The aim of this study is to assess the effect that bladder and rectum filling has on planning target volume angle, to determine a method to assess prostate bed tilt leading to potential geographic miss, and to discuss possible implementation issues. The cone-beam computed tomography images (n = 377) of 40 patients who received postprostatectomy radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy were reviewed. The amount of tilt in the prostate bed was defined as the angle change between 2 surgical clips, one in the upper prostate bed and another in the lower. A potential geographic miss was defined as movement of any clip of more than 1cm in any direction or 0.5 cm posteriorly when aligned to bone anatomy. Variations in bladder and rectum size were correlated with the degree of prostate bed tilt, and the rate of potential geographic miss was determined. A possible clinical use of prostate bed tilt was then assessed for different imaging techniques. A tilt of more than 10° was seen in 20.2% of images, which resulted in a 57.9% geographic miss rate of the superior clip. When tilt remained within 10°, there was only a 9% rate of geographic miss. Potential geographic miss of the inferior surgical clip was rare, occurring in only 1.9% of all images reviewed. The most common occurrence when the prostate bed tilt increased by more than 10° was a smaller bladder and larger rectum (6.4% of all images). The most common occurrence when the prostate bed tilt decreased by more than 10° was a larger bladder and smaller rectum (1.3% of all images). Significant prostate bed tilt (>± 10°) occurred in more than 20% of images, creating a 58% rate of geographic miss. Greatest prostate bed tilt occurred when the bladder size increased or reduced by more than 2 cm or the superior rectum size increased by more than 1.5 cm or reduced by more than 1cm from the planned size. Using prostate bed tilt could be an effective measurement for assessing potential geographic miss on orthogonal images if volumetric imaging is unavailable.""","""['Linda J Bell', 'Jennifer Cox', 'Thomas Eade', 'Marianne Rinks', 'Andrew Kneebone']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Determining optimal planning target volume and image guidance policy for post-prostatectomy intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'The impact of rectal and bladder variability on target coverage during post-prostatectomy intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'Prostate bed motion may cause geographic miss in post-prostatectomy image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'A multicentre observational study evaluating image-guided radiotherapy for more accurate partial-breast intensity-modulated radiotherapy: comparison with standard imaging technique.', 'Rationale and development of image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy post-prostatectomy: the present standard of care?', 'Determining optimal planning target volume and image guidance policy for post-prostatectomy intensity modulated radiotherapy.']"""

During prostate cancer (PCa) cell invasion, a variety of proteolytic enzymes are expressed that digest BM components including perlecan. An enzyme upregulated in invasive PCa cells, matrilysin/matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), was examined as a candidate for perlecan proteolysis both in silico and in vitro. Purified perlecan showed high sensitivity to MMP-7 digestion even when fully decorated with HS or when presented in native context connected with other BM proteins. In both conditions, MMP-7 produced discrete perlecan fragments corresponding to an origin in immunoglobulin (Ig) repeat region domain IV. While not predicted by in silico analysis, MMP-7 cleaved every subpart of recombinantly generated perlecan domain IV. Other enzymes relevant to PCa that were tested had limited ability to cleave perlecan including prostate specific antigen, hepsin, or fibroblast activation protein α. A long C-terminal portion of perlecan domain IV, Dm IV-3, induced a strong clustering phenotype in the metastatic PCa cell lines, PC-3 and C4-2. MMP-7 digestion of Dm IV-3 reverses the clustering effect into one favoring cell dispersion. In a C4-2 Transwell® invasion assay, perlecan-rich human BM extract that was pre-digested with MMP-7 showed loss of barrier function and permitted a greater level of cell penetration than untreated BM extract. We conclude that enzymatic processing of perlecan in the BM or territorial matrix by MMP-7 as occurs in the invasive tumor microenvironment acts as a molecular switch to alter PCa cell behavior and favor cell dispersion and invasiveness.""","""['B J Grindel', 'J R Martinez', 'C L Pennington', 'M Muldoon', 'J Stave', 'L W Chung', 'M C Farach-Carson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Matrix Biol""","""['Matrilysin/MMP-7 Cleavage of Perlecan/HSPG2 Complexed with Semaphorin 3A Supports FAK-Mediated Stromal Invasion by Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Perlecan/HSPG2 and matrilysin/MMP-7 as indices of tissue invasion: tissue localization and circulating perlecan fragments in a cohort of 288 radical prostatectomy patients.', 'Cleavage of the Perlecan-Semaphorin 3A-Plexin A1-Neuropilin-1 (PSPN) Complex by Matrix Metalloproteinase 7/Matrilysin Triggers Prostate Cancer Cell Dyscohesion and Migration.', 'Flipping the Molecular Switch: Influence of Perlecan and Its Modifiers in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Border patrol: insights into the unique role of perlecan/heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 at cell and tissue borders.', 'Gabapentin Disrupts Binding of Perlecan to the α2δ1 Voltage Sensitive Calcium Channel Subunit and Impairs Skeletal Mechanosensation.', 'Proteolysis: a key post-translational modification regulating proteoglycans.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway in prostate cancer and associated drug resistance.', 'Bacteroides fragilis Enterotoxin Upregulates Matrix Metalloproteinase-7 Expression through MAPK and AP-1 Activation in Intestinal Epithelial Cells, Leading to Syndecan-2 Release.', 'Sirt3 Maintains Microvascular Endothelial Adherens Junction Integrity to Alleviate Sepsis-Induced Lung Inflammation by Modulating the Interaction of VE-Cadherin and β-Catenin.']"""

Through data mining from published transcriptomic database, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) was first identified as a differentially upregulated gene in NPC tissues, which is a key enzyme for isometric conversion of fatty acids entering the β-oxidation. Given the roles of AMACR in prognostication and frontline therapeutic regimen of common carcinomas, such as prostate cancer, we explored AMACR immunoexpression status and its clinical significance in NPC patients. AMACR immunohistochemistry was retrospectively performed and analyzed using H-score for biopsy specimens from 124 NPC patients who received standard treatment without distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. Those cases with H-score larger than the median value were construed as featuring AMACR overexpression. The findings were correlated with the clinicopathological variables, disease-specific survival (DSS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Endogenous AMACR protein expressions were assessed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting in NPC cells and non-neoplastic mucosal cells. AMACR overexpression was significantly associated with increment of primary tumor status (P = 0.009) and univariately predictive of adverse outcomes for DSS, DMFS, and LRFS. In the multivariate comparison, AMACR overexpression still remained prognostically independent to portend worse DSS (P = 0.006, hazard ratio = 2.129), DMFS (P = 0.001, hazard ratio = 2.795), and LRFS (P = 0.041, hazard ratio = 2.009), together with advanced American Joint of Cancer Committee (AJCC) stages III-IV.

Results:   Mortality rates in the APFO-exposed cohort were at or below the expected, compared with Minnesota. The HR for dying from the cancer and non-cancer outcomes of interest did not show an association with APFO exposure.

We correlated all the expression profiles with biochemical recurrence, as defined by a PSA >0.4 ng/mL in a mean follow-up period of 53.3 months. In PCa, CD44s was underexpressed and all the other isoforms were overexpressed. The mean expression level of most variants was higher in patients who had not recurred, and a higher expression of CD44v2 independently correlated with a better recurrence-free survival rate (p=0.045). This variant was also underexpressed in metastatic PCa cell lines. There was no correlation between the expression levels of any of the CD44 isoforms and the classical prognostic factors.We here demonstrated that PCa cases are characterized by a change in the expression of CD44, with a loss of CD44s and an overexpression of all the other CD44 variants.

When restricted the analysis to cases with Gleason score higher than 8, sensitivity and negative predictive value increased to 85% and 97%, respectively. Similarly, when the analysis focused exclusively to cases with more than 5mm of cancer in the biopsy, sensitivity and positive predictive value increased to 66% and 96%, respectively.  Conclusions:   This study shows that whilst specificity was maintained in 98%, sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive values significantly improved in high grade and high volume adenocarcinomas. Our findings confirm that the cytological study of the transport buffer may complement the histology in the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma.""","""['J I López', 'F Cáceres', 'A Pérez', 'V Caamaño', 'G Larrinaga', 'D Lecumberri', 'A Arruza']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Utility of Histoscanning™ prior to prostate biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Transrectal aspiration biopsy versus transperineal core biopsy for the diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate.', 'A study of transrectal aspiration biopsy of the prostate.', 'Positive predictive value of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in initial core needle biopsies of prostate adenocarcinoma--a study with complete sampling of hemi-prostates with corresponding negative biopsy findings.', 'The role of the absolute value and ""density"" of the prostate-specific antigen estimated echographically in the selection of patients to undergo a biopsy in suspected prostatic carcinoma.

Our aim was to assess the use of ipilimumab after radiotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy.  Methods:   We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial in which men with at least one bone metastasis from castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive bone-directed radiotherapy (8 Gy in one fraction) followed by either ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to four doses. Non-progressing patients could continue to receive ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg or placebo as maintenance therapy every 3 months until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effect, or death. Patients were randomly assigned to either treatment group via a minimisation algorithm, and stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, alkaline phosphatase concentration, haemoglobin concentration, and investigator site. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00861614.  Findings:   From May 26, 2009, to Feb 15, 2012, 799 patients were randomly assigned (399 to ipilimumab and 400 to placebo), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Median overall survival was 11·2 months (95% CI 9·5-12·7) with ipilimumab and 10·0 months (8·3-11·0) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·85, 0·72-1·00; p=0·053). However, the assessment of the proportional hazards assumption showed that it was violated (p=0·0031). A piecewise hazard model showed that the HR changed over time: the HR for 0-5 months was 1·46 (95% CI 1·10-1·95), for 5-12 months was 0·65 (0·50-0·85), and beyond 12 months was 0·60 (0·43-0·86). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were immune-related, occurring in 101 (26%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 11 (3%) of patients in the placebo group. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events included diarrhoea (64 [16%] of 393 patients in the ipilimumab group vs seven [2%] of 396 in the placebo group), fatigue (40 [11%] vs 35 [9%]), anaemia (40 [10%] vs 43 [11%]), and colitis (18 [5%] vs 0). Four (1%) deaths occurred because of toxic effects of the study drug, all in the ipilimumab group.  Interpretation:   Although there was no significant difference between the ipilimumab group and the placebo group in terms of overall survival in the primary analysis, there were signs of activity with the drug that warrant further investigation.

In the present study, we developed an analog BENC-511 from a recently reported PI3K inhibitor S14161 by structural optimization. Using PC3 and DU145 as the model cell lines, we found PTEN-deficient PC3 cells were more sensitive than PTEN-expressing DU145 ones in terms of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activation. These findings were consistent with the inhibition on PI3K/AKT signals. BENC-511 preferably suppressed AKT activation in PC3 over DU145 cells. Notably, PTEN restoration attenuated BENC-511 induced apoptosis. Moreover, BENC-511 displayed great therapeutic efficacy in a PC3-derived prostate cancer model in nude mice. With an oral dosage of 50mg/kg, BENC-511 decreased tumor growth more than 50% in 27 days, which was accompanied with PARP cleavage, but did not show overt toxicity.

In some recent publications, the recommendation is that all cribriform patterns be classified as Gleason pattern (GP) 4 rather than GP 3.  Materials and methods:   We assessed the cribriform foci (CF) associated with the more definitive patterns 3, 4, and 5 elsewhere on the 185 radical prostatectomy specimens and evaluated the association of the cribriform pattern with extraprostatic extension, surgical margin.  Results:   CF were more frequently observed in cases with definitive patterns 4 and 5 than in cases with pattern 3 (all cases with pattern 5 exhibited CF). Cases with Gleason score 3+3 and CF were more frequently associated with extraprostatic extension, and a positive surgical margin.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that diagnosing all cribriform patterns as at least GP 4 would significantly affect further therapeutic options and prognosis. However, as many of these modifications are empirical and supported by only a few studies, long-term follow-up studies with clinical endpoints are necessary to validate these recommendations.""","""['Billur Cosan Sarbay', 'Gozde Kir', 'Cumhur Selcuk Topal', 'Eyup Gumus']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['The association of the cribriform pattern with outcome for prostatic adenocarcinomas.', 'Usual and unusual histologic patterns of high Gleason score 8 to 10 adenocarcinoma of the prostate in needle biopsy tissue.', 'Gleason score 7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate with lymph node metastases: analysis of 184 radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Prognostic significance of tumor volume in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens.', 'The impact of the 2005 international society of urological pathology consensus conference on standard Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma in needle biopsies.', 'Prostate Cancer Morphologies: Cribriform Pattern and Intraductal Carcinoma Relations to Adverse Pathological and Clinical Outcomes-Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Comedonecrosis Gleason pattern 5 is associated with worse clinical outcome in operated prostate cancer patients.', 'Narrative review of prostate cancer grading systems: will the Gleason scores be replaced by the Grade Groups?', 'Are we ready to include invasive cribriform and intraductal carcinoma into the prostate cancer grade grouping system?', 'Cribriform pattern does not have a significant impact in Gleason Score ≥7/ISUP Grade ≥2 prostate cancers submitted to radical prostatectomy.']"""

Decision aids can improve the decision-making process by reducing decisional conflict and helping patients to participate in decision making.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to design and develop a DA for treatment decision making in localized prostate cancer in Spain with regard to surgery, radiotherapy, or watchful waiting.  Interventions/methods:   We developed a DA based on the principles of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards Collaboration and according to the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. The structural development process involved DA developers, expert feedback, use of the Delphi method, and patient feedback. We conducted a pilot test on 34 men with localized prostate cancer.  Results:   The DA is a structured booklet. According to the International Patient Decision Aid Standards checklist, the DA scored 22 of 27 points (81.48%). The development process section scored 22 of 24 points (91.6%), and the effectiveness of the decision-making process section scored 6 of 6 (100%). The clinical pilot test yielded positive feedback regarding the design, images, understandability, usability, explanations, and amount of information in the DA.  Conclusions:   We developed a Spanish DA with a strong quality score to help patients make an informed choice regarding their prostate cancer treatment. Future research will assess the impact of the DA and its association with improved decision making.  Implications for practice:   This tool provides information about the risks and benefits of different treatment options and helps patients to understand the importance of their own values for informing treatment choices.""","""['Carolina Chabrera', 'Albert Font', 'Mónica Caro', 'Joan Areal', 'Adelaida Zabalegui']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""['Impact of a web-based treatment decision aid for early-stage prostate cancer on shared decision-making and health outcomes: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.', 'Evidence-based patient choice: a prostate cancer decision aid in plain language.', 'Systematic Review of Decision Aids for Newly Diagnosed Patients with Prostate Cancer Making Treatment Decisions.', 'A systematic review of effectiveness of decision aids to assist older patients at the end of life.', 'Decision Aids for Shared Decision-making in Uro-oncology: A Systematic Review.', 'Development of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Patient Decision Aid for Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Mixed Methods Study.', 'Evaluating the Quality of Patient Decision-Making Regarding Post-Acute Care.', ""Canadian Men's perspectives about active surveillance in prostate cancer: need for guidance and resources.""]"""

Men's and partners' reactions to treatment decision making for prostate cancer when active surveillance is the recommended treatment option""","""Objective:   In the past decade, localised prostate cancer (LPC) management has been shifting from three radical treatment options (radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy) to also include active surveillance (AS). This study examines men with LPC and partners' experiences of choosing between AS and radical treatments, and their experiences of AS when selected.  Methods:   A qualitative descriptive research design was used. Interviewed participants were men, and partners of men, who either had chosen radical treatment immediately following diagnosis or had been on AS for at least 3 months. AS was the recommended treatment. Transcribed interviews were thematically analysed and inter-rater reliability integrated.  Results:   Twenty-one men and 14 partners participated. Treatment decisions reflected varied reactions to prostate cancer information, regularly described as contradictory, confusing, and stressful. Men and partners commonly misunderstood AS but could describe monitoring procedures. Partners often held the perception that they were also on AS. Men and partners usually coped with AS but were sometimes encumbered by treatment decision-making memories, painful biopsies, ongoing conflicting information, and unanswered medical questions. Radical treatment was selected when cancer progression was feared or medically indicated. Some preferred doctors to select treatments.  Conclusions:   To reduce distress frequently experienced by men diagnosed with LPC and their partners during treatment decision making and ongoing AS monitoring, the following are needed: improved community and medical awareness of AS; consistent information about when radical treatment is required; and consistent, unbiased information on treatment options, prognostic indicators, and side effects.

A retrospective claim analysis utilizing a national database (MarketScan, Thomson Reuters) was performed for Commercial insurer and Medicare databases between January 2000 and March 2011. A retrospective analysis of contemporaneous penile prosthesis implantation at the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) was done. Population demographics, comorbidities, previous (ED) therapies and time from ED diagnosis to surgery were assessed. Median ages for patients undergoing penile prosthesis implantation were 58, 70 and 63 years for the Commercial, Medicare and JHH cohorts, respectively. For the claim databases (Commercial, Medicare, respectively), hypertension (72%, 78%), dyslipidemia (71%, 56%) and diabetes mellitus (45%, 40%) were predominant comorbidities, whereas for the JHH database prostate cancer (51%) and its management by prostatectomy (45%) or radiation (12%) were predominant. Previous use of PDE5 inhibitors was similar across databases (60, 58 and 69% for Commercial, Medicare and JHH cohorts, respectively), although previous use of non-oral ED therapies was greater in the JHH database.

We demonstrate that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow aspirates of non-metastasized carcinoma patients, which are taken at specialized centers for diagnostic purposes, can be used to generate a human immune system in NOD-scid IL2rγ(null) (NSG) and HLA-I expressing NSG mice (NSG-HLA-A2/HHD) comprising both, lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages. Using NSG-HLA-A2/HHD mice, we show that responsive and self-tolerant human T cells develop and human antigen presenting cells can activate human T cells. As critical factors we identified the low potential of bone marrow HSPCs to engraft, generally low HSPC numbers in patient-derived bone marrow samples, cryopreservation and routes of cell administration. We provide here an optimized protocol that uses a minimum number of HSPCs, preselects high-quality bone marrow samples defined by the number of initially isolated leukocytes and intra-femoral or intra-venous injection.

A high throughput, high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with triple quadrupole mass spectral detection (LC/MS/MS) was validated for the measurement of 5 endogenous androgens in human plasma and serum and applied to various in vivo and in vitro study samples to pursue a better understanding of the interrelationship of the androgen axis, intracrine metabolism, and castration-recurrent prostate cancer (CaP).  Methods:   A Shimadzu HPLC system interfaced with a Sciex QTRAP 5500 mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization was used with in line column-switching. Samples were liquid/liquid extracted and chromatographed on a Luna C18(2) column at 60°C with a biphasic gradient using a 15-min run time.  Results:   The method was validated for five androgens in human plasma and serum, and applied to four sets of samples. Plasma (n=188) and bone marrow aspirate (n=129) samples from patients with CaP, who received abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for up to 945 days(135 weeks), had undetectable androgens after 8 weeks of treatment. Plasma dehydroepiandrosterone(DHEA) concentrations were higher in African Americans than Caucasian Americans with newly diagnosed CaP. Analysis of prostate tumor tissue homogenates demonstrated reproducible testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations with a minimal sample size of 1.0–2.0 mg of tissue. Finally, cell pellet and media samples from the LNCaP C4-2 cell line showed conversion of T to DHT.

Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between H3PH and clinicopathologic features in screening prostate biopsies.  Methods:   Ninety-two patients who underwent a prostate biopsy at our institution between October 2011 and May 2012 were included in this study. The core with the greatest percentage of the highest grade disease was analyzed for H3PH by methylation-specific PCR. Correlational analysis was used to analyze the relationship between H3PH and various clinical parameters. Chi-square analysis was used to compare H3PH status between benign and malignant disease.  Results:   Of the 80 biopsies with HOXD3 methylation status assessable, 66 sets were confirmed to have cancer. In the 14 biopsies with benign disease there was minimal H3PH with the mean percentage of methylation reference (PMR) of 0.7%. In contrast, the HOXD3 promoter was hypermethylated in 16.7% of all cancers and in 50% of high risk tumors with an average PMR of 4.3% (P=0.008). H3PH was significantly correlated with age (P=0.013), Gleason score (P=0.031) and the maximum involvement of the biopsy core (P=0.035).  Conclusions:   H3PH is associated with clinicopathologic features. The data indicate that H3PH is more common in older higher risk patients.

However, in this study, the relative high-level expression of DAB2 gene was observed in the highly invasive prostate cancer PC3 cells. Moreover, enforced expression of miR-145 could significantly down-regulate the expression level of DAB2 in PC3 cells, and inhibit the migration and invasion of PC3 cells.

We evaluated whether having health insurance reduces racial disparities in the use of definitive therapy for high-risk CaP.  Materials and methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program was used to identify 70,006 men with localized high-risk CaP (prostate-specific antigen level > 20 ng/ml or Gleason score 8-10 or stage > cT3a) diagnosed from 2007 to 2010. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze the 64,277 patients with complete data to determine the factors associated with receipt of definitive therapy.

There was a significant interaction between race and insurance status (P interaction = 0.01) such that insurance coverage was associated with a reduction in racial disparity between AA and white patients regarding receipt of definitive therapy. Specifically, the AOR for definitive treatment for AA vs. white was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.27-0.54, P < 0.001) among uninsured men, whereas the AOR was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57-0.66, P < 0.001) among insured men.  Conclusions:   AA men with high-risk CaP were significantly less likely to receive potentially life-saving definitive treatment when compared with white men.

Considering that recurrent tumors are most often responsible for patient mortality, there exists an urgent need to study signaling pathways that drive tumor dormancy/recurrence. We have developed an in vitro model of tumor dormancy/recurrence. Short-term exposure of tumor cells (breast or prostate) to chemotherapy at clinically relevant doses enriches for a dormant tumor cell population. Several days after removing chemotherapy, dormant tumor cells regain proliferative ability and establish colonies, resembling tumor recurrence. Tumor cells from ""recurrent"" colonies exhibit increased chemotherapy resistance, similar to the therapy resistance of recurrent tumors in cancer patients. Previous studies using long-term chemotherapy selection models identified acquired mutations that drive tumor resistance. In contrast, our short term chemotherapy exposure model enriches for a slow-cycling, dormant, chemo-resistant tumor cell sub-population that can resume growth after drug removal.

Immunohistochemical method was used for the detection of Klf4 protein via tissue microarray in 404 prostate samples.  Results:   No significant difference existed in the expressions of Nanog, Oct4A and Sox2 genes between BPH and PCa samples. And the expressions of c-Myc and Klf4 genes were significantly higher in PCa than those in BPH specimens. Immunohistochemical results showed that Klf4 protein could be detected in a large majority of epithelial prostatic cells irrespective of malignant transformation. However, it was predominantly located cytoplasmically in PCa tissues and remained consistent with the expression of a differentially spliced Klf4α isoform.  Conclusion:   Klf4 is highly expressed in both BPH and PCa tissues. But in malignant cells, a specific gene product Klf4α is predominantly detectable in cytoplasm. The positioning of Klf4 protein may have an important relationship with its role in the tumorigenic process.""","""['Lei Ge', 'Zhongjie Shan', 'Qianhe Han', 'Jianting Hu', 'Huiming Liu', 'Qingjun Guan', 'Xiaowei Qu', 'Kun Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi""","""['Klf4 transcription factor is expressed in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells.', 'Expressions of endothelin-1 in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer and their significance.', 'Expressions of the androgen receptor in normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative detection of DD3 mRNA in prostate cancer tissues by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.', 'Impairment of IGF2 gene expression in prostate cancer is triggered by epigenetic dysregulation of IGF2-DMR0 and its interaction with KLF4.']"""

Against the backdrop of the ensuing controversy, in 2013 the American Urological Association (AUA) published a new, methodologically rigorous guideline. This guideline recommended that men aged 55-69 be offered biennial screening in the setting of shared decision-making, that men under 40 or over 69 years of age should not be screened routinely, and that evidence was insufficient to recommend screening for men aged 40-54 years. While it has received criticism with regard to the age-based recommendations, the AUA guideline reflects a far better and more balanced presentation of the available evidence than the USPSTF statement. However, because the USPSTF is far more influential than the AUA among primary care providers, the ultimate impact of the new AUA guideline on practice patterns may be limited. Optimizing early detection practices should involve consensus-building incorporating both primary care and specialist input, with the goals of minimizing overtreatment of low-risk disease while continuing to reduce prostate cancer mortality rates through early detection and aggressive management of high-risk disease.""","""['Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Curr Urol Rep""","""['American Urological Association (AUA) guideline on prostate cancer detection: process and rationale.', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: a guidance statement from the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians.', 'Impact of the 2012 United States Preventive Services Task Force statement on prostate-specific antigen screening: analysis of urologic and primary care practices.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: the current evidence and guidelines controversy.', 'A Tool for Shared Decision Making on Referral for Prostate Biopsy in the Primary Care Setting: Integrating Risks of Cancer with Life Expectancy.', 'Association of VDR gene TaqI polymorphism with the susceptibility to prostate cancer in Asian population evaluated by an updated systematic meta-analysis.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening Trends After United States Preventative Services Task Force Guidelines in an Underserved Population.', 'Molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.', ""From 'D' to 'I': A critique of the current United States preventive services task force recommendation for testicular cancer screening.""]"""

In the current study, we investigated the effects of metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride), a widely used antidiabetic drug, on tumor cell radiosensitivity in prostate cancer. Through clonogenic survival assays, we found that metformin treatment enhanced radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells with a dose enhancement factor. Moreover, irradiation of subcutaneous C4-2 tumors in mice treated with metformin resulted in an increase in radiation-induced tumor growth delay (17.3 days to 29.5 days, P < 0.01), which indicates that the tumor radiosensitivity increased by metformin in vivo. We also measured the sublethal damage repair and analyzed double-strand breaks (DSBs) in X-irradiated cells. γ-H2AX, as an indicator of DSBs, had significantly more foci per cell in the group treated with metformin and radiation compared to groups treated with metformin or irradiation, respectively. Moreover, mice with subcutaneous tumor implants lived longer after a combined treatment of metformin and radiation. In addition, the reduced phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs caused by EGFR/PI3K/Akt down-regulation is essential for metformin to induce radiosensitivity in prostate cancer cells.

Circulating levels of the systemic inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP) have been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. We investigated the role of genetic variation in CRP and prostate cancer, under the hypothesis that variants may alter risk of disease.  Methods:   We undertook a case-control study nested within the prospective Physicians' Health Study among 1,286 men with incident prostate cancer and 1,264 controls. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected to capture the common genetic variation across CRP (r(2) > 0.8). We used unconditional logistic regression to assess the association between each SNP and risk of prostate cancer. Linear regression models explored associations between each genotype and plasma CRP levels.  Results:   None of the CRP SNPs were associated with prostate cancer overall. Individuals with one copy of the minor allele (C) in rs1800947 had an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1-2.8), and significantly lower mean CRP levels (P-value <0.001), however, we found no significant association with lethal disease. Mean CRP levels were significantly elevated in men with one or two copies of the minor allele in rs3093075 and rs1417939, but these were unrelated to prostate cancer risk.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that SNPs in the CRP gene are not associated with risk of overall or lethal prostate cancer.

Oncomine™ database and IHC (immunohistochemistry) analyses of human prostate tissues revealed that expression of HEXIM1 mRNA and protein are down-regulated during the development and progression of prostate cancer. Enforced down-regulation of HEXIM1 in parental hormone-dependent LNCaP cells results in resistance to the inhibitory action of anti-androgens. Conversely, ectopic expression of HEXIM1 in the CRPC (castration-resistant prostate cancer) cell line, C4-2, enhances their sensitivity to the repressive effects of the anti-androgen bicalutamide. Novel insight into the mechanistic basis for HEXIM1 inhibition of AR activity is provided by the present studies showing that HEXIM1 induces expression of the histone demethylase KDM5B (lysine-specific demethylase 5B) and inhibits histone methylation, resulting in the inhibition of FOXA1 (forkhead box A1) licensing activity.

Methods:   We have included 61 consecutive patients recently diagnosed with cancer prostate by biopsy. All patients were classified as medium-to-high risk: Gleason: 7-9; PSA: 6.3-30.4 ng/mL; stage T2c (N.=20) or stage T3 (N.=41). Image acquisition began 5 min after intravenous injection of 11C-choline (656+119 MBq), starting at the pelvis and continuing craniocaudally. Images were interpreted visually to evaluate uptake by the prostate gland. Lymph nodes with 11C-choline uptake were considered invaded, regardless of their size. Bone lesions were considered positive when they showed greater focal uptake than the surrounding bone. In patients with evidence of lymph-node invasion or bone metastases (15 patients), disease was classified as locoregional, oligometastatic, or multimetastatic.  Results:   All patients had prostate gland uptake (20 focal, 8 bifocal, and 33 multifocal). Extraprostatic disease was present in 15 patients (24.6%), as follows: 9 (60%) in a single location: in an infradiaphragmatic lymph node (N.=6), in a supradiaphragmatic lymph node (N.=1), and in bone (M1) (N.=2). Six (40%) as multifocal invasion: with both infra- and supradiaphragmatic lymph node involvement (N.=2); with infradiaphragmatic lymph node involvement and M1 bone metastases (N.=3); and infra- and supradiaphragmatic lymph node involvement plus M1 bone metastases (N.=1). Disease was classified as locoregional (N.=6), oligometastatic (N.=5), and multimetastatic (N.=4). The 11 (73.3%) patients with locoregional and oligometastatic disease were selected to undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy with dose escalation based on the PET findings.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that 11C-choline PET/CT is a useful one-stop diagnostic procedure for evaluating patients with medium/high risk prostate cancer scheduled for radical treatment. 11C-choline PET/CT can reliably rule out lymph node involvement and remote metastases, allowing to select candidates for radiotherapy and to plan their treatment.""","""['J R Garcia', 'S Jorcano', 'M Soler', 'D Linero', 'M Moragas', 'E Riera', 'R Miralbell', 'F Lomeña']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Q J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Does Choline PET/CT Change the Management of Prostate Cancer Patients With Biochemical Failure?', '(11)C-choline PET/CT and multiparametric MRI in patients with biochemical relapse of prostate cancer.', '11CCholine PET/CT for targeted salvage lymph node dissection in patients with biochemical recurrence after primary curative therapy for prostate cancer.

We have found that T. vaginalis secretes a protein, T. vaginalis macrophage migration inhibitory factor (TvMIF), that is 47% similar to human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (HuMIF), a proinflammatory cytokine. Because HuMIF is reported to be elevated in prostate cancer and inflammation plays an important role in the initiation and progression of cancers, we have explored a role for TvMIF in prostate cancer. Here, we show that TvMIF has tautomerase activity, inhibits macrophage migration, and is proinflammatory. We also demonstrate that TvMIF binds the human CD74 MIF receptor with high affinity, comparable to that of HuMIF, which triggers activation of ERK, Akt, and Bcl-2-associated death promoter phosphorylation at a physiologically relevant concentration (1 ng/mL, 80 pM). TvMIF increases the in vitro growth and invasion through Matrigel of benign and prostate cancer cells. Sera from patients infected with T. vaginalis are reactive to TvMIF, especially in males.

C-terminal-binding protein 1 (CtBP1) is a transcription repressor of tumor suppressor genes and is activated by NADH binding. High calorie intake decreases intracellular NAD(+)/NADH ratio. The aim of this work was to assess the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) and CtBP1 expression modulation over prostate xenograft growth.  Experimental design:   We developed a metabolic syndrome-like disease in vivo model by feeding male nude mice with HFD during 16 weeks. Control diet (CD)-fed animals were maintained at the same conditions. Mice were inoculated with PC3 cells stable transfected with shCtBP1 or control plasmids. Genome-wide expression profiles and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed from PC3.shCtBP1 versus PC3.pGIPZ HFD-fed mice tumors.  Results:   No significant differences were observed in tumor growth on CD-fed mice; however, we found that only 60% of HFD-fed mice inoculated with CtBP1-depleted cells developed a tumor. Moreover these tumors were significantly smaller than those generated by PC3.pGIPZ control xenografts. We found 823 genes differentially expressed in shCtBP1 tumors from HFD-fed mice. GSEA from expression dataset showed that most of these genes correspond to cell adhesion, metabolic process, and cell cycle.  Conclusions:   Metabolic syndrome-like diseases and CtBP1 expression cooperate to induce prostate tumor growth. Hence, targeting of CtBP1 expression might be considered for prostate cancer management and therapy in the subset of patients with metabolic syndromes.""","""['Cristian P Moiola', 'Paola De Luca', 'Florencia Zalazar', 'Javier Cotignola', 'Santiago A Rodríguez-Seguí', 'Kevin Gardner', 'Roberto Meiss', 'Pablo Vallecorsa', 'Omar Pignataro', 'Osvaldo Mazza', 'Elba S Vazquez', 'Adriana De Siervi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['CTBP1 depletion on prostate tumors deregulates miRNA/mRNA expression and impairs cancer progression in metabolic syndrome mice.', 'Role of transcriptional corepressor CtBP1 in prostate cancer progression.', 'CTBP1/CYP19A1/estradiol axis together with adipose tissue impacts over prostate cancer growth associated to metabolic syndrome.', 'Fanconi anemia proteins interact with CtBP1 and modulate the expression of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1.', 'The low-abundance transcriptome reveals novel biomarkers, specific intracellular pathways and targetable genes associated with advanced gastric cancer.', 'Obesity and cancer: Mouse models used in studies.', 'Hsa-miR-133a-3p, miR-1-3p, GOLPH3 and JUP combination results in a good biomarker to distinguish between prostate cancer and non-prostate cancer patients.', 'Lipid metabolism-related lncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 promotes the progression of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating the NPM1/c-Myc axis and SLC25A21 expression.', 'CTBP1 strengthens the cisplatin resistance of gastric cancer cells by upregulating RAD51 expression.', 'MiR-19b-3p and miR-101-3p as potential biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis.']"""

The long survival of patients with this common cancer raises questions about the risk of a second primary cancer and the need for continued surveillance.  Methods:   A population-based cohort of 441,504 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1992 and 2010 was identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) data (SEER13). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated as an estimate of the risk of a second primary malignancy based on the incidence in the general population.  Results:   Prostate cancer survivors had a lower risk of being diagnosed with another cancer overall compared with the US population (SIR = 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.61). The risks of leukemia and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, lung and bronchus, and larynx were significantly lower. Conversely, these patients had a greater risk of bladder, kidney, and endocrine and soft tissue cancers. Men who received treatment with radiation therapy (external-beam radiation therapy) had long-term increases in their risk of bladder cancer (SIR = 1.42) and rectal cancer (SIR = 1.70) risk compared with who did not receive radiation (SIRbladder = 0.76; SIRrectal = 0.74). There were significant racial differences in the risk of being diagnosed with a second primary cancer, and the magnitude and direction of these risks depended on tumor type.

Therefore, novel drugs capable of downregulating the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis may demonstrate potential for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). Rosiglitazone (RSG), a thiazolidinedione ligand of the peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor (PPAR) γ, has been found to inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis, suppress angiogenesis and inhibit metastasis. However, the precise mechanisms by which RSG regulates CXCR4 gene expression and the consequent effects on prostate cell migration and invasion are not fully understood. In this study, it was observed that RSG is capable of downregulating the expression of CXCR4 in PCa cells in a dose‑, time‑ and PPARγ‑dependent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that the downregulation of CXCR4 expression occurred at a transcriptional level, as indicated by a reduction in CXCR4 mRNA expression. Suppression of CXCR4 expression by RSG further correlated with the inhibition of CXCL12‑induced migration and invasion in PCa cells. Analysis of the predominant intracellular signaling pathways that act downstream of the activated CXCR4/CXCL12 axis, namely the phosphatidyl inositol 3‑kinase (PI3K)‑protein kinase B (Akt) cascades, revealed that RSG rapidly interferes with the phosphorylation/activation of Akt, which mediates CXCL12‑stimulated migration and invasion. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that RSG represents a novel inhibitor of CXCR4 expression and, thus, has significant potential as a powerful therapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic PCa.""","""['Liang Qin', 'Chen Gong', 'An-Min Chen', 'Feng-Jing Guo', 'Fei Xu', 'Ye Ren', 'Hui Liao']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Emodin inhibits invasion and migration of prostate and lung cancer cells by downregulating the expression of chemokine receptor CXCR4.', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ligands inhibit VEGF-mediated vasculogenic mimicry of prostate cancer through the AKT signaling pathway.', 'Inhibition of CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling axis by ursolic acid leads to suppression of metastasis in transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate model.', 'Role of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis in pancreatic cancer.', 'CXCL14 antagonizes the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis.', 'The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors in the tumor microenvironment, tumor cell metabolism, and anticancer therapy.', 'Molecular Modeling of Allosteric Site of Isoform-Specific Inhibition of the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor PPARγ.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Stimulated Expression of CXCL12 in Adrenocortical Carcinoma by the PPARgamma Ligand Rosiglitazone Impairs Cancer Progression.', 'PPAR-γ Modulators as Current and Potential Cancer Treatments.']"""

One of them, the local effect model (LEM), in particular version I (LEM I), is implemented in treatment planning systems (TPS) clinically used in European particle therapy centers. From the physical properties of the specific ion radiation, the LEM calculates the survival probabilities of the cell or tissue type under study, provided that some determinant input parameters are initially defined. Mathematical models can be used to predict, for instance, the tumor control probability (TCP), and then evaluate treatment outcomes. This work studies the influence of the LEM I input parameters on the TCP predictions in the specific case of prostate cancer. Several published input parameters and their combinations were tested. Their influence on the dose distributions calculated for a water phantom and for a patient geometry was evaluated using the TPS TRiP98. Changing input parameters induced clinically significant modifications of the mean dose (up to a factor of 3.5), spatial dose distribution, and TCP predictions (up to factor of 2.6 for D50). TCP predictions were found to be more sensitive to the parameter threshold dose (Dt) than to the biological parameters α and β. Additionally, an analytical expression was derived for correlating α, β and Dt, and this has emphasized the importance of [Formula: see text].

In the present study, we identified agents that target prostate cancer cells based on CDK5 expression. CDK5 activity was suppressed by transfection of PC3 prostate cancer cells with a dominant-negative construct (PC3 CDK5dn). PC3 CDK5dn and PC3 control cells were screened for compounds that selectively target cells based on CDK5 expression, utilizing the Johns Hopkins Drug Library. MTS proliferation, clonogenic and 3D growth assays were performed to validate the selected hits. Screening of 3,360 compounds identified rutilantin, ethacridine lactate and cetalkonium chloride as compounds that selectively target PC3 control cells and a tilorone analog as a selective inhibitor of PC3 CDK5dn cells. A PubMed literature study indicated that tilorone may have clinical use in patients. Validation experiments confirmed that tilorone treatment resulted in decreased PC3 cell growth and invasion; PC3 cells with inactive CDK5 were inhibited more effectively. Future studies are needed to unravel the mechanism of action of tilorone in CDK5 deficient prostate cancer cells and to test combination therapies with tilorone and a CDK5 inhibitor for its potential use in clinical practice.""","""['Michel D Wissing', 'Tikva Dadon', 'Eunice Kim', 'Klaus B Piontek', 'Joong S Shim', 'Nadine S Kaelber', 'Jun O Liu', 'Sushant K Kachhap', 'Barry D Nelkin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['RNAi-mediated knockdown of pituitary tumor- transforming gene-1 (PTTG1) suppresses the proliferation and invasive potential of PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'The reduction of IL-6 gene expression, pAKT, pERK1/2, pSTAT3 signaling pathways and invasion activity by gallic acid in prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'All-trans retinoic acid induces DU145 cell cycle arrest through Cdk5 activation.', 'Future Aspects of CDK5 in Prostate Cancer: From Pathogenesis to Therapeutic Implications.', 'Non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor and vitamin D agonist are involved in suppressing invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells.', 'The impact of microfluidics in high-throughput drug-screening applications.', 'Microalgal Co-Cultivation Prospecting to Modulate Vitamin and Bioactive Compounds Production.', 'Efficacy of Tilorone Dihydrochloride against Ebola Virus Infection.', 'TRPV4 plays a role in breast cancer cell migration via Ca2+-dependent activation of AKT and downregulation of E-cadherin cell cortex protein.', 'The Emerging Role of Cdk5 in Cancer.']"""

Methods:   This analysis included 26 consecutive patients scheduled for prostate PET/MRI before radical prostatectomy. The examinations were performed on a hybrid whole-body PET/MRI scanner. The MR acquisitions which included T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences were followed during the same session by whole-body PET scans. Parametric maps were constructed to measure normalized T2-weighted intensity (nT2), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), volume transfer constant (K (trans)), extravascular extracellular volume fraction (v e) and standardized uptake values (SUV). With pathology as the gold standard, ROC curves were calculated using logistic regression for each parameter and for the best combination with and without PET to obtain a MR model versus a PETMR model.  Results:   Of the 26 patients initially selected, 3 were excluded due to absence of an endorectal coil (2 patients) or prosthesis artefacts (1 patient). In the whole prostate, the area under the curve (AUC) for SUVmax, ADC, nT2, K (trans) and v e were 0.762, 0.756, 0.685, 0.611 and 0.529 with a best threshold at 3.044 for SUVmax and 1.075 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s for ADC. The anatomical distinction between the transition zone and the peripheral zone showed the potential of the adjunctive use of PET. In the peripheral zone, the AUC of 0.893 for the PETMR model was significantly greater (p = 0.0402) than the AUC of 0.84 for the MR model only. In the whole prostate, no relevant correlation was observed between ADC and SUVmax. The SUVmax was not affected by the Gleason score.  Conclusion:   The performance of a hybrid whole-body (18)F-fluorocholine PET/MRI scan in the same session combined with a prostatic MR examination did not interfere with the diagnostic accuracy of the MR sequences. The registration of the PET data and the T2 anatomical MR sequence data allowed precise localization of hypermetabolic foci in the prostate. While in the transition zone the adenomatous hyperplasia interfered with cancer detection by PET, the quantitative analysis tool performed well for cancer detection in the peripheral zone.""","""['Thomas de Perrot', 'Olivier Rager', 'Max Scheffler', 'Martin Lord', 'Marc Pusztaszeri', 'Christophe Iselin', 'Osman Ratib', 'Jean-Paul Vallee']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Is there an additional value of ¹¹C-choline PET-CT to T2-weighted MRI images in the localization of intraprostatic tumor nodules?', 'Usefulness of MRI-assisted metabolic volumetric parameters provided by simultaneous (18)F-fluorocholine PET/MRI for primary prostate cancer characterization.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Emerging methods for prostate cancer imaging: evaluating cancer structure and metabolic alterations more clearly.', 'Fabrication and evaluation of bilateral Helmholtz radiofrequency coil for thermo-stable breast image with reduced artifacts.', 'Molecular Imaging in Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer Patients: Current Aspects and Future Trends.', 'MRI/PET Imaging in elevated PSA and localized prostate cancer: a narrative review.', 'PET/MRI in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: restaging performance of 18F-choline hybrid PET/MRI.']"""

For these reasons, we evaluated the competing risks of PC-specific mortality after initial therapy with radical prostatectomy (RP) versus radiotherapy (RT) in men with clinically localized high-risk PC.  Methods:   We reviewed patients treated with RP and RT combined with androgen-deprivation therapy between 1990 and 2009. High-risk PC is defined as clinical stage ≥T3a, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >20 ng/mL, or a biopsy Gleason sum of 8-10 according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Competing risk analysis was conducted to assess the association of RP (n = 251) or RT (n = 125) with cancer-specific mortality (CSM). Thereafter, secondary analysis with propensity score matching was conducted to further elucidate patient characteristics, with optimal matching of 0.25 times the standard deviation of propensity scores.  Results:   With an overall median follow-up of 76 months, 35 (9.3 %) men with high-risk PC died due to PC (23 in the RT group and 12 in the RP group). The 5-year estimates of cancer-specific survival rate for men treated with RP and RT were 96.5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 94.2-98.9) and 88.3 % (95 % CI 82.8-94.3), respectively. Cumulative incidence estimates for CSM were statistically increased amongst men treated with RT (p = 0.002). Propensity score matching extracted 168 men with high-risk PC from the total patient cohort. Cumulative incidence estimates for CSM were statistically different amongst men treated with RT (p < 0.001).

Methods:   We evaluated data from consecutive patients who had undergone RP. Data analyzed included age, preoperative serum PSA, prostatic volume, BMI (continuous or categorized (≤ 25 kg/m(2)) values), clinical and pathological findings including index tumor volume (ITV), and current status in areas such as smoker or nonsmoker and presence or absence of diabetes. We analyzed association between BMI and BCR, especially based on ITV using univariate and multivariate analysis.  Results:   We analyzed data from a total of 703 patients. The median follow-up time was 38.4 months. BCR was diagnosed in 154 patients (21.9%) at a median of 9.7 months postoperatively. Multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for preoperative variables showed a significant positive association between BMI and ITV (continuous BMI: P=0.002; categorical BMI: P<0.001, respectively), especially for higher-grade tumors (Gleason score ≥ 7). Cox proportional hazards analysis showed a significant association between continuous BMI and BCR after surgery (preoperative variables, hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.16, P=0.008), independent of clinical and pathological findings.

The Erection Hardness Score (EHS) is a single-item scale that has demonstrated good psychometric properties for assessing erectile function (EF) in patients treated by sildenafil, but its applicability to other treatment contexts has not yet been tested.  Aim:   This study aims to test the validity and time and treatment responsiveness of the EHS to assess ED in men with post-RP ED treated with alprostadil injections.  Methods:   This is a 1-year follow-up cohort study of 75 patients treated by RP for localized prostate cancer in a urology department setting between January 2007 and December 2008. Data were prospectively collected at 6 and 12 months post-RP.  Main outcome measures:   The EHS, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) reference questionnaire, the Global Assessment Questionnaire (GAQ), and Numeric Pain Scale (NPS) were collected. Convergent validity (Spearman correlation coefficients with IIEF domains), known-groups validity (comparing EHS scores across ED severity groups), time and treatment responsiveness (effect size with/without treatment and over the follow-up period), and predictive ability (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC-ROC]) were analyzed for this study.  Results:   The EHS showed good convergent validity (all Spearman coefficients significant at the P<0.05 level), adequate known-groups validity (global differentiation between IIEF-EF severity groups; P<0.001), and treatment responsiveness (effect size: +1.8 [6 months], +2.1 [12 months]), but limited time responsiveness and predictive ability of the EHS for a normal EF at 12 months follow-up when compared with the IIEF-EF domain (AUC-ROC: 0.72 vs. 0.85; P<0.01).  Conclusion:   Our findings support the overall good psychometric properties of the EHS in patients with post-RP ED treated with alprostadil injections.

The nationwide Japanese Prostate Cancer Outcome Study of Permanent Iodine-125 Seed Implantation (J-POPS) has continued since July 2005. This manuscript presents the rationale, J-POPS study design, and the characteristics of initial participants enrolled in this study from July 2005 to June 2007.  Methods:   All participants were treated with PI in accordance with the American Brachytherapy Society recommendations. The primary outcome measure was biochemical progression-free survival. Progression-free survival, overall survival, cause-specific survival, longitudinal changes in health-related quality of life, disease-specific quality of life, the International Prostate Symptom Score, and the incidence of adverse events were also investigated as secondary outcome measurements.  Results:   Overall, 6,927 patients were enrolled by the end of 2010, that is approximately 40 % of all cases treated around the country. During the first 2 years, 2,354 participants were enrolled and 2,339 were actually treated with PI. The age range of participants was 45 to 89 years (median 69 years) and their risk classifications were 1,037 (44.3 %) at low risk, 1,126 (48.1 %) at intermediate risk, and 134 (5.7 %) at high risk, in addition to 16 participants whose classification was unknown. Of all patients, 76.6 % were treated with PI without external beam radiation therapy and 49.3 % received neoadjuvant hormone therapy.

Abnormalities of FGFR2 have been shown in advanced prostate cancer or prostate cancer cell lines, and we previously demonstrated the tumor-suppressive effects of the restoration of FGFR2IIIb in prostate cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to determine whether FGFR2IIIb plays a role in the chemosensitivity of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. A clonal line of PC-3 cells expressing FGFR2IIIb (PC-3R2IIIb) was established by transfection with an IRESneo2-expressing vector bearing FGFR2IIIb cDNA. The effects of chemotherapeutic agents (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and zoledronic acid) on cell viability and apoptosis were examined by MTT assay and western blot analysis, respectively. Expression levels of molecules that were markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and chemosensitivity-related proteins were assessed by western blot analysis. Viability of the PC-3R2IIIb cells was significantly lower than that of the control PC-3 cells transfected with the vector alone (PC-3neo), and viability was further suppressed by treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, particularly docetaxel. Induced expression of caspase-3 was evident in the PC-3R2IIIb cells and was further enhanced by treatment with docetaxel. Expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, survivin and XIAP was lower in the PC-3R2IIIb cells than that in the PC-3neo cells. In contrast, expression of p21 was higher in the PC-3R2IIIb cells than that in the control PC-3neo cells. These data indicate that restoration of FGFR2IIIb in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells may reverse some of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell properties characteristic of tumor cells and induce in part mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition properties. This together with enhancement of apoptotic pathways involving caspase-3 may enhance chemosensitivity particularly to docetaxel which is widely used in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Koichi Shoji', 'Jun Teishima', 'Tetsutaro Hayashi', 'Shinya Ohara', 'Wallace L Mckeehan', 'Akio Matsubara']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Restoration of fibroblast growth factor receptor2 suppresses growth and tumorigenicity of malignant human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells.', 'Restoration of FGF receptor type 2 enhances radiosensitivity of hormone-refractory human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells.', 'Restoration of IGFBP-rP1 increases radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity in hormone-refractory human prostate cancer.', 'Emerging targets to monitor and overcome docetaxel resistance in castration resistant prostate cancer (review).', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer: current and emerging therapy strategies.', 'FGF/FGFR-Dependent Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Anti-Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Updates on Molecular and Biochemical Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', '2b or Not 2b: How Opposing FGF Receptor Splice Variants Are Blocking Progress in Precision Oncology.', 'Integrated Analysis of Structural Variation and RNA Expression of FGFR2 and Its Splicing Modulator ESRP1 Highlight the ESRP1amp-FGFR2norm-FGFR2-IIIchigh Axis in Diffuse Gastric Cancer.', 'Intrinsic FGFR2 and Ectopic FGFR1 Signaling in the Prostate and Prostate Cancer.']"""

Paired CAFs and NCFs were isolated from eight primary human colorectal carcinoma specimens. In culture conditions, soluble factors secreted by CAFs in the conditioned media increased clonogenicity and migration of epithelial cancer cells lines to a greater extent than did NCF. In vivo, CAFs were more competent as tumour growth enhancers than paired NCFs when co-inoculated with colorectal cell lines. Gene expression analysis of microarrays of CAF and paired NCF populations enabled us to identify 108 deregulated genes (38 upregulated and 70 downregulated genes). Most of those genes are fibroblast-specific. This has been validated in silico in dataset GSE39396 and by qPCR in selected genes. GSEA analysis revealed a differential transcriptomic profile of CAFs, mainly involving the Wnt signallingsignalling pathway, focal adhesion and cell cycle. Both deregulated genes and biological processes involved depicted a considerable degree of overlap with deregulated genes reported in breast, lung, oesophagus and prostate CAFs. These observations suggest that similar transcriptomic programs may be active in the transition from normal fibroblast in adjacent tissues to CAFs, independently of their anatomic demarcation. Additionally NCF already depicted an activated pattern associated with inflammation. The deregulated genes signature score seemed to correlate with CAF tumour promoter abilities in vitro, suggesting a high degree of heterogeneity between CAFs, and it has also prognostic value in two independent datasets. Further characterization of the roles these biomarkers play in cancer will reveal how CAFs provide cancer cells with a suitable microenvironment and may help in the development of new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.""","""['Mireia Berdiel-Acer', 'Rebeca Sanz-Pamplona', 'Alexandre Calon', 'Daniel Cuadras', 'Antoni Berenguer', 'Xavier Sanjuan', 'Maria José Paules', 'Ramon Salazar', 'Victor Moreno', 'Eduard Batlle', 'Alberto Villanueva', 'David G Molleví']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Hepatic carcinoma-associated fibroblasts promote an adaptative response in colorectal cancer cells that inhibit proliferation and apoptosis: nonresistant cells die by nonapoptotic cell death.', 'A monotonic and prognostic genomic signature from fibroblasts for colorectal cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis.', 'Functional heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts from human colon tumors shows specific prognostic gene expression signature.', 'Exploring the tumour environment: cancer-associated fibroblasts as targets in cancer therapy.', 'Regulation of heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblasts: the molecular pathology of activated signaling pathways.', 'IL1R1+ cancer-associated fibroblasts drive tumor development and immunosuppression in colorectal cancer.', 'PD-L1 testing in advanced gastric cancer-what physicians who treat this disease must know-a literature review.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts in gynecological malignancies: are they really allies of the enemy?', 'Detection, Role and Prognostic Value of Cancer-associated Fibroblasts in Colorectal Cancer.', '""Pulsed Hypoxia"" Gradually Reprograms Breast Cancer Fibroblasts into Pro-Tumorigenic Cells via Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition.']"""

Several methods have been described to improve detection, diagnostic, and treatment in cancer, but the diagnostic methods are very aggressive for patients. Biopsies have been the gold standard to determine the clinical pathological characteristics of cancer tissues for many years. The biopsies procedure is very uncomfortable for the patients, and in many cases the results are negative to cancer. Therefore, patients are submitted to a second round of biopsies, because their clinical conditions implicate the presence of neoplasia. During the last years, noninvasive methods have shown relevance because they could be good indicators for cancer detection at molecular level. Molecular signatures have been included to characterize different stages of the disease, and thereby the objective is to prevent unnecessary biopsies. Several body fluids as urine, serum, blood, semen, saliva, etc. have been used. In fluids, miRNA detection provides a promising tool to obtain molecular signatures for different types of cancer. Urine represents a very good option to find molecules representative of tumor status in prostate cancer.

The mechanisms by which AKT isoforms mediate signaling to phenotypes associated with PTEN inactivation in cancer have not been defined. Here, we show that AKT2 is exclusively required for PTEN-deficient prostate tumor spheroid maintenance, whereas AKT1 is dispensable. shRNA silencing of AKT2 but not AKT1 promotes regression of prostate cancer xenografts. Mechanistically, we show that AKT2 silencing upregulates p21 and the proapoptotic protein BAX and downregulates the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1. We also show that p21 is an effector of AKT2 in mediating prostate tumor maintenance. Moreover, AKT2 is also exclusively required for the maintenance and survival of other PTEN-deficient solid tumors, including breast cancer and glioblastoma. These findings identify a specific function for AKT2 in mediating survival of PTEN-deficient tumors and provide a rationale for developing therapeutics targeting AKT2.  Significance:   Depletion of AKT2, but not AKT1, induces potent tumor regression in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer xenografts, concomitant with upregulation of p21, which may serve as a potential biomarker for screening AKT2 activity in clinical samples.

Methods and materials:   Forty-four men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer were randomly assigned to receive either OAMCGT plus IMRT (arm 1; n=21) or IMRT only (arm 2; n=23). The primary phase 2 endpoint was acute (≤90 days) toxicity. Secondary endpoints included quality of life (QOL), prostate biopsy (12-core) positivity at 2 years, freedom from biochemical/clinical failure (FFF), freedom from metastases, and survival.  Results:   Men in arm 1 exhibited a greater incidence of low-grade influenza-like symptoms, transaminitis, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia than men in arm 2. There were no significant differences in gastrointestinal or genitourinary events or QOL between the 2 arms. Two-year prostate biopsies were obtained from 37 men (84%). Thirty-three percent of men in arm 1 were biopsy-positive versus 58% in arm 2, representing a 42% relative reduction in biopsy positivity in the investigational arm (P=.13). There was a 60% relative reduction in biopsy positivity in the investigational arm in men with <50% positive biopsy cores at baseline (P=.07). To date, 1 patient in each arm exhibited biochemical failure (arm 1, 4.8%; arm 2, 4.3%). No patient developed hormone-refractory or metastatic disease, and none has died from prostate cancer.

Here, using an integrative approach combining the first genome-wide mapping of chromatin binding for an endocytic adaptor, ARRB1, both in vitro and in vivo with gene expression profiling, we demonstrate that nuclear ARRB1 contributes to this metabolic shift in prostate cancer cells via regulation of HIF1A transcriptional activity under normoxic conditions through regulation of succinate dehydrogenase A (SDHA) and fumarate hydratase (FH) expression. ARRB1-induced pseudohypoxia may facilitate adaptation of cancer cells to growth in the harsh conditions that are frequently encountered within solid tumours.

Six years after radiotherapy, the patient presented with macroscopic hematuria over the preceding 4 months, and laboratory investigations revealed a low hemoglobin level. The hematuria was not controlled with 2 days of bladder irrigation using normal saline. Thus, argon plasma coagulation using an upper gastrointestinal endoscope was considered for treatment of the hemorrhagic radiation cystitis.

But it is unclear whether microRNAs play a role in regulating oncogene expression in fulvestrant-treated prostate cancer. Here, this study reports hsa-miR-765 as the first fulvestrant-driven, ERβ-regulated miRNA exhibiting significant tumor suppressor activities like fulvestrant, against prostate cancer cell growth via blockage of cell-cycle progression at the G2/M transition, and cell migration and invasion possibly via reduction of filopodia/intense stress-fiber formation. Fulvestrant was shown to upregulate hsa-miR-765 expression through recruitment of ERβ to the 5'-regulatory-region of hsa-miR-765. HMGA1, an oncogenic protein in prostate cancer, was identified as a downstream target of hsa-miR-765 and fulvestrant in cell-based experiments and a clinical study. Both the antiestrogen and the hsa-miR-765 mimic suppressed HMGA1 protein expression. In a neo-adjuvant study, levels of hsa-miR-765 were increased and HMGA1 expression was almost completely lost in prostate cancer specimens from patients treated with a single dose (250 mg) of fulvestrant 28 days before prostatectomy. These findings reveal a novel fulvestrant signaling cascade involving ERβ-mediated transcriptional upregulation of hsa-miR-765 that suppresses HMGA1 protein expression as part of the mechanism underlying the tumor suppressor action of fulvestrant in prostate cancer.""","""['Yuet-Kin Leung', 'Queeny Kwan-Yi Chan', 'Chi-Fai Ng', 'Fanny Man-Ting Ma', 'Ho-Man Tse', 'Ka-Fai To', 'Jodi Maranchie', 'Shuk-Mei Ho', 'Kin-Mang Lau']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Correction: Hsa-miRNA-765 as a Key Mediator for Inhibiting Growth, Migration and Invasion in Fulvestrant-Treated Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNA-221/222 confers breast cancer fulvestrant resistance by regulating multiple signaling pathways.', 'Binding of anterior gradient 2 and estrogen receptor-α: Dual critical roles in enhancing fulvestrant resistance and IGF-1-induced tumorigenesis of breast cancer.', 'Fulvestrant inhibits growth of triple negative breast cancer and synergizes with tamoxifen in ERα positive breast cancer by up-regulation of ERβ.', 'Role of fulvestrant in the treatment of postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients.', 'The therapeutic role of fulvestrant in the management of patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.', 'High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1): Structure, Biological Function, and Therapeutic Potential.', 'miR-765 Acts as a Tumor Promoter and Indicates Poor Prognosis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Bioinformatics and system biology approach to identify the influences of SARS-CoV-2 infections to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.', 'High Mobility Group A (HMGA): Chromatin Nodes Controlled by a Knotty miRNA Network.', 'MicroRNA-765 alleviates the malignant progression of breast cancer via interacting with EZH1.']"""

Whether taxanes and next-generation androgen receptor (AR) axis inhibitors are cross-resistant or not is a subject of debate.  Objective:   To evaluate the antitumour activity of cabazitaxel in mCRPC pretreated with abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Design, setting, and participants:   The antitumour activity of cabazitaxel was assessed in patients with mCRPC and progressive disease after treatment with docetaxel and AA. In parallel, cabazitaxel antitumour activity was studied in enzalutamide-resistant models.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and progression-free survival were used to determine the activity of cabazitaxel treatment. Cell proliferation, immunofluorescence, and AR transactivation assay were used in enzalutamide-resistant models.  Results and limitations:   A total of 79 patients who had progressive mCRPC after docetaxel (median: 8 cycles; range: 4-12 mo), and AA (median: 4.8 mo; range:1-55 mo) received cabazitaxel 25mg/m(2) every 3 weeks (median: 6 cycles; range:1-15 cycles). A PSA decline ≥30% was achieved in 48 patients (62%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 51-73), and a decline ≥50% was achieved in 28 patients (35%; 95% CI, 25-47). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.4 and 10.9 mo, respectively. In vitro, cabazitaxel decreased cell viability in both enzalutamide-sensitive and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells within the same range of concentrations. PC3, an AR-negative cell line, exhibited similar sensitivity to cabazitaxel.  Conclusions:   Cabazitaxel and AR-pathway inhibitors are not cross-resistant. Preclinical data suggest that cabazitaxel activity does not act mainly through AR axis inhibition.  Patient summary:   The antitumour activity of cabazitaxel, a chemotherapy agent, was studied in prostate cancer resistant to conventional hormonal therapy and to more recent endocrine therapies (abiraterone or enzalutamide).

We introduced a screening tool as part of clinical care to identify CAT use.  Methods:   We evaluated all patients who attended the radiation oncology outpatient clinic between December 2011 and July 2012, who had filled out the CAT screening tool, and evaluated types of CAT use, reasons for use and predictors of CAT usage.  Results:   A total of 639 patients completed the CAT screening tool, which was 75% of eligible patients. There were 464 (72.6%) men and 175 (27.4%) women, with a mean age of 69.9 years (range 27-94 years). Prostate cancer was the predominant diagnosis (53.1%), followed by breast cancer (17.5%) and skin cancer (14.7%). Of these, 530 patients (82.9%) had used at least one therapy. Of the 530 patients using CAT, the most quoted reasons for use were to improve quality of life (42.6%), to boost the immune system and general health (33.6%), to increase energy levels (32.6%) and to live longer (28.9%). Of the 530 users, only 112 patients (21.1%) took CAT to help cure their cancer. Women were significantly more likely to use CAT, as were patients with breast cancer.

PC3 cells transfected with recombinant lentivirus vector carrying the human INPP4B gene, and the expression of INPP4B was confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The effect of INPP4B transfection or PARP inhibitor treatment or both on the proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle, and level of protein kinase B (p-AKT) of PC3 cells was determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Western blot, respectively.  Results:   INPP4B gene was lost in PC3 cells and successfully expressed in PC3 cells after recombinant lentivirus transfection. Cell proliferation was inhibited and the level of p-AKT decreased, causing a G1 arrest. PARP inhibitor had a remarkable negative effect on cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis, conferring a G2/M arrest, which was dose dependent; however, the level of intracellular p-AKT showed a slight rise. INPP4B gene transfection and PARP inhibitor combined blocked cell cycle progression in G1 phase, enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation, and kept low intracellular p-AKT level.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrated that the combination of INPP4B gene transfection and PARP inhibitor had a synergistic antitumor effect on PC3 cells, which was expected to shed new light on combined biological therapy in castration therapy-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Huan Ding', 'Ying Sun', 'Yu Hou', 'Li Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['INPP4B overexpression enhances the antitumor efficacy of PARP inhibitor AG014699 in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II and rucaparib treatment inhibit the growth of osteosarcoma cells dependent on phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway.', 'Loss of INPP4B causes a DNA repair defect through loss of BRCA1, ATM and ATR and can be targeted with PARP inhibitor treatment.', 'Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor: an evolving paradigm in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Targeting DNA Repair: The Role of PARP Inhibition in the Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is associated with increased cellular proliferation, prevents apoptosis and favors tumor invasion. We intend to clarify whether resveratrol and other polyphenols effectively inhibit COX-2 activity and induce apoptosis in hormone-resistant PC-3 cell line.  Material and method:   PC-3 cells were cultured and treated with different concentrations of gallic acid, tannic acid, quercetin, and resveratrol in presence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 50 μg/ml) that induces COX-2 expression. Total RNA was extracted and COX-2 expression was analyzed by relative quantification real-time PCR (ΔΔCt method). COX-2 activity was determined by PGE-2 detection using ELISA. Caspase 3/7 luminescence assay was used to disclose apoptosis. Transitory transfection with short human COX-2 (phPES2 -327/+59) and p5xNF-kβ-Luc plasmids determined COX-2 promoter activity and specifically that dependant of NF-kβ.  Results:   COX-2 expression was not modified in media devoid of PMA. However, under PMA induction tannic acid (2.08 ±.21), gallic acid (2.46 ±.16), quercetin (1.78 ±.14) and resveratrol (1.15 ±.16) significantly inhibited COX-2 mRNA with respect to control (3.14 ±.07), what means a 34%, 23%, 46% and 61% reduction, respectively. The inhibition in the levels of PGE-2 followed a similar pattern. All compounds studied induced apoptosis at 48 h, although at a different rate. PMA caused a rise in activity 7.4 ±.23 times phPES2 -327/+59 and 2.0 ±.1 times p5xNF-kβ-Luc at 6h compared to basal. Resveratrol suppressed these effects 17.1 ±.21 and 32.4 ±.18 times, respectively. Similarly, but to a lesser extent, the rest of evaluated polyphenols diminished PMA inductor effect on the activity of both promoters.  Conclusions:   Polyphenols inhibit transcriptional activity of COX-2 promoter mediated by NF-kβ.

Objective:   To identify and validate a biopsy-based gene expression signature that predicts clinical recurrence, prostate cancer (PCa) death, and adverse pathology.  Design, setting, and participants:   Gene expression was quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for three studies-a discovery prostatectomy study (n=441), a biopsy study (n=167), and a prospectively designed, independent clinical validation study (n=395)-testing retrospectively collected needle biopsies from contemporary (1997-2011) patients with low to intermediate clinical risk who were candidates for active surveillance (AS).  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   The main outcome measures defining aggressive PCa were clinical recurrence, PCa death, and adverse pathology at prostatectomy. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the association between gene expression and time to event end points. Results from the prostatectomy and biopsy studies were used to develop and lock a multigene-expression-based signature, called the Genomic Prostate Score (GPS); in the validation study, logistic regression was used to test the association between the GPS and pathologic stage and grade at prostatectomy. Decision-curve analysis and risk profiles were used together with clinical and pathologic characteristics to evaluate clinical utility.  Results and limitations:   Of the 732 candidate genes analyzed, 288 (39%) were found to predict clinical recurrence despite heterogeneity and multifocality, and 198 (27%) were predictive of aggressive disease after adjustment for prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and clinical stage. Further analysis identified 17 genes representing multiple biological pathways that were combined into the GPS algorithm. In the validation study, GPS predicted high-grade (odds ratio [OR] per 20 GPS units: 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-3.7; p<0.001) and high-stage (OR per 20 GPS units: 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-3.0; p=0.003) at surgical pathology. GPS predicted high-grade and/or high-stage disease after controlling for established clinical factors (p<0.005) such as an OR of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.4-3.2) when adjusting for Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score. A limitation of the validation study was the inclusion of men with low-volume intermediate-risk PCa (Gleason score 3+4), for whom some providers would not consider AS.  Conclusions:   Genes representing multiple biological pathways discriminate PCa aggressiveness in biopsy tissue despite tumor heterogeneity, multifocality, and limited sampling at time of biopsy. The biopsy-based 17-gene GPS improves prediction of the presence or absence of adverse pathology and may help men with PCa make more informed decisions between AS and immediate treatment.  Patient summary:   Prostate cancer (PCa) is often present in multiple locations within the prostate and has variable characteristics. We identified genes with expression associated with aggressive PCa to develop a biopsy-based, multigene signature, the Genomic Prostate Score (GPS). GPS was validated for its ability to predict men who have high-grade or high-stage PCa at diagnosis and may help men diagnosed with PCa decide between active surveillance and immediate definitive treatment.""","""['Eric A Klein', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Jeffry P Simko', 'Sara M Falzarano', 'Tara Maddala', 'June M Chan', 'Jianbo Li', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Athanasios C Tsiatis', 'Diana B Cherbavaz', 'Robert J Pelham', 'Imelda Tenggara-Hunter', 'Frederick L Baehner', 'Dejan Knezevic', 'Phillip G Febbo', 'Steven Shak', 'Michael W Kattan', 'Mark Lee', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Eric A.

Additionally, CtBP2 inhibition could decrease the level of c-Myc and its direct transcriptional target, HSPC111.

Population-based cancer registries can augment this research by providing more clinical detail and long-term follow-up information than is typically available from biospecimen annotations. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we performed a pilot linkage between the California Cancer Registry (CCR) and the University of California, Davis Cancer Center Biorepository (UCD CCB) databases to determine if we could identify patients with records in both databases.  Methods:   We performed a probabilistic data linkage between 2180 UCD CCB biospecimen records collected during the years 2005-2009 and all CCR records for cancers diagnosed from 1988-2009 based on standard data linkage procedures.  Results:   The 1040 UCD records with a unique medical record number, tissue site, and pathology date were linked to 3.3 million CCR records. Of these, 844 (81.2%) were identified in both databases. Overall, record matches were highest (100%) for cancers of the cervix and testis/other male genital system organs. For the most common cancers, matches were highest for cancers of the lung and respiratory system (93%), breast (91.7%), and colon and rectum (89.5%), and lower for prostate (72.9%).  Conclusions:   This pilot linkage demonstrated that information on existing biospecimens from a cancer center biorepository can be linked successfully to cancer registry data. Linkages between existing biorepositories and cancer registries can foster productive collaborations and provide a foundation for virtual biorepository networks to support population-based biospecimen research.""","""['Margaret E McCusker', 'Rosemary D Cress', 'Mark Allen', 'Allyn Fernandez-Ami', 'Regina Gandour-Edwards']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biopreserv Biobank""","""['Using personal health insurance numbers to link the Canadian Cancer Registry and the Discharge Abstract Database.', 'Ensuring quality in studies linking cancer registries and biobanks.', 'Cohort profile: the Alberta Prostate Cancer Research Initiative (APCaRI) Registry and Biorepository facilitates technology translation to the clinic through the use of linked, longitudinal clinical and patient-reported data and biospecimens from men in Alberta, Canada.', 'Record linkage for pharmacoepidemiological studies in cancer patients.', 'Biorepositories: Addendum to Registries for Evaluating Patient Outcomes: A User’s Guide, Third Edition Internet.', 'The Belgian Virtual Tumorbank: A Tool for Translational Cancer Research.']"""

The parameter is not identified in either historical dataset alone; nonetheless, both can provide some information about the parameter and, consequently, increase the precision of its estimate. To illustrate the potential for gains in efficiency and implications for the design of the study, we consider Gaussian outcomes and biomarker data and calculate the asymptotic variance using the expected Fisher information matrix. We quantify the gain in efficiency both through a numerical study and, in a simplified setting, insights derived from an algebraic development of the problem.

In some patients the treatment is associated with adverse side effects that could become persistent after therapy discontinuation, resulting in the so-called post-finasteride syndrome (PFS). A pharmacogenetic component in the response to finasteride treatment was previously demonstrated. Two polymorphisms (CAG) rs4045402 and (GGN) rs3138869 in the gene encoding for the androgen receptor (AR) have been hypothesized to play a role in finasteride sensitivity. We aimed to compare the rs4045402 and rs3138869 polymorphisms prevalence in a group of 69 selected subjects (AGA+PFS) that used finasteride to treat alopecia and developed persistent side effects, with that in a group of 91 untreated subjects with AGA (AGA), and a group of 76 untreated subjects without AGA (NO-AGA). The rs4045402 and rs3138869 polymorphisms extreme-lengths alleles were more frequent among AGA+PFS (odds ratio, 5.88; 95% CI, 1.87-18.52) and AGA subjects (odds ratio, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.13-11.21) than among NO-AGA subjects, probably reflecting the genetic predisposing factors for AGA development. In conclusion, we described a predictive effect of the less common repeats' length CAG-rs4045402 and GGN-rs3138869 on AGA development.

Despite the implementation of effective radiotherapy and chemotherapy methods, prostate cancer cells can still show resistance to treatment. In recent years, a combination of proteasome and histone deacetylase inhibitors has been used to treat various malignancies. In this study, we examined the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade/PS-341) and histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), used either alone or in combination, on the human prostate LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. We investigated the cytotoxic activity of these inhibitors using a WST-1 assay, IkBα and caspase-3 mRNA levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and caspase-3 activity and activation of phosphorylated (p-IkBα) protein by Western blotting. Low-dose bortezomib and TSA synergistically induced apoptosis in both prostate cancer cell lines. Combination treatment with TSA with bortezomib effectively inactivated NFkB signaling, upregulated the predominant endogenous apoptotic factor caspase-3, and disrupted the NFkB pathway in the androgen-independent PC3 cell line. In contrast, androgen-dependent LNCaP cells showed upregulation of caspase-3 through a pathway other than NFkB. This study examined the possible clinical use of bortezomib and TSA, together with reduced doses of chemotherapeutic agents with high cytotoxicity, to determine their apoptotic effects on the NFkB pathway in prostate cancer cell lines. Therefore, combination bortezomib and TSA treatment may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.""","""['I Kiliccioglu', 'E Konac', 'N Varol', 'S Gurocak', 'C Yucel Bilen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Genet Mol Res""","""['Histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A and proteasome inhibitor PS-341 synergistically induce apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Drug interactions between the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and cytotoxic chemotherapy, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand in prostate cancer.', 'Vorinostat and bortezomib synergistically cause ubiquitinated protein accumulation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Bortezomib as a potential treatment for prostate cancer.', 'New drugs in gynecologic cancer.', 'Pharmacological Properties of Trichostatin A, Focusing on the Anticancer Potential: A Comprehensive Review.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Trichostatin A inhibits proliferation of PC3 prostate cancer cells by disrupting the EGFR pathway.', 'Inhibition of human prostate cancer (PC-3) cells and targeting of PC-3-derived prostate cancer stem cells with koenimbin, a natural dietary compound from Murraya koenigii (L) Spreng.', 'Molecular Pathways: The Balance between Cancer and the Immune System Challenges the Therapeutic Specificity of Targeting Nuclear Factor-κB Signaling for Cancer Treatment.']"""

We hypothesized that altered glycosylation could be related to differences in gene expression levels of glycoprotein synthetic enzymes between normal and malignant prostate tissues.  Methods:   We interrogated prostate cancer gene expression data for reproducible changes in expression of glycoprotein synthetic enzymes. Over-expression of GCNT1 was validated in prostate samples using RT-PCR. ELISA was used to measure core 2 O-linked glycan sialyl Lewis X (sLe(x) ) of prostate specific antigen (PSA), Mucin1 (MUC1), and prostatic acidic phosphatase (PAP) proteins.  Results:   A key glycosyltransferase, GCNT1, was consistently over-expressed in several prostate cancer gene expression datasets. RT-PCR confirmed increased transcript levels in cancer samples compared to normal prostate tissue in fresh-frozen prostate tissue samples. ELISA using PSA, PAP, and MUC1 capture antibodies and a specific core 2 O-linked sLe(x) detection antibody demonstrated elevation of this glycan structure in cancer compared to normal tissues for MUC1 (P = 0.01), PSA (P = 0.03) and near significant differences in PAP sLe(x) levels (P = 0.06). MUC1, PSA and PAP protein levels alone were not significantly different between paired normal and malignant prostate samples.  Conclusions:   GCNT1 is over-expressed in prostate cancer and is associated with higher levels of core 2 O-sLe(x) in PSA, PAP and MUC1 proteins. Alterations of O-linked glycosylation could be important in prostate cancer biology and could provide a new avenue for development of prostate cancer specific glycoprotein biomarkers.""","""['Zuxiong Chen', 'Zulfiqar G Gulzar', 'Catherine A St Hill', 'Bruce Walcheck', 'James D Brooks']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Development and Clinical Application of Glycan-Targeted Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Increased expression of MUC1 and sialyl Lewis antigens in different areas of clear renal cell carcinoma.', 'O-glycosylation of MUC1 mucin in prostate cancer and the effects of its expression on tumor growth in a prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Diverse glycosylation of MUC1 and MUC2: potential significance in tumor immunity.', 'Glycosylation is a global target for androgen control in prostate cancer cells.', 'Glycosylated modification of MUC1 maybe a new target to promote drug sensitivity and efficacy for breast cancer chemotherapy.', 'A Deep Learning-Based Framework for Supporting Clinical Diagnosis of Glioblastoma Subtypes.', 'Altered glycosylation of several metastasis-associated glycoproteins with terminal GalNAc defines the highly invasive cancer cell phenotype.', 'Glycosylation Changes in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Characterization of tumor-associated MUC1 and its glycans expressed in mucoepidermoid carcinoma.']"""

This article attempts to analyze the diagnostic role of telomerase as an early marker of carcinogenesis.  Methods:   Complex urological patient evaluation and assessment of telomerase activity.  Results:   Out of 92 patients 44% were diagnosed with CaP, 49% with low-grade PIN (LGPIN) in association with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 7% with HGPIN in association with BPH. Active telomerase (AT) in prostate biopsy specimens was detected in 98% of patients with CaP, in 33% of patients with HGPIN, and in 20% of patients with LGPIN. In the event of simultaneous detection of AT and PIN in initial prostate biopsy specimens, further monitoring for 0.5-4.0 years revealed CaP development in 50-56% of cases. Further follow-up of patients with PIN and absent telomerase activity in initial biopsy specimens did not demonstrate the development of CaP. The PSA level was significantly higher in patients with active telomerase in the prostate tissue than in telomerase negative patients.  Conclusions:   Telomerase activity in the prostate tissue increases the risk of CaP development in patients with PIN.

Materials and methods:   In a prospective setting, 45 patients with biopsy-proven PCa received prostate MRI prior to radical prostatectomy (RP). T2 and diffusion-weighted imaging (T2WI/DW-MRI) and, if applicable, dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences (T2WI/DW/DCE-MRI) were used to perform MRI/RTE fusion. The probability of PCa on MRI was graded according to the PI-RADS score for 12 different prostate sectors per patient. MRI images were fused with RTE to stratify suspicious from non-suspicious sectors. Imaging results were compared to whole mount sections using nonparametrical receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under these curves (AUC).  Results:   41 of 45 patients were eligible for final analyses. Histopathology confirmed PCa in 261 (53%) of 492 prostate sectors. MRI alone provided an AUC of 0.62 (T2WI/DW-MRI) and 0.65 (T2WI/DW/DCE-MRI) to predict PCa and was meaningfully enhanced to 0.75 (T2WI/DW-MRI) and 0.74 (T2WI/DW/DCE-MRI) using MRI/RTE fusion. Sole MRI showed a sensitivity and specificity of 57.9% and 61% with the best results for ventral prostate sectors whereas RTE was superior in dorsal and apical sectors. MRI/RTE fusion improved sensitivity and specificity to 65.9% and 75.3%, respectively. Additional use of DCE sequences showed a sensitivity and specificity of 65% and 55.7% for MRI and 72.1% and 66% for MRI/RTE fusion.  Conclusion:   MRI/RTE fusion provides improved PCa visualization by combining the strength of both imaging techniques in regard to prostate zonal anatomy and thereby might improve future biopsy-guided PCa detection.""","""['M Brock', 'F Roghmann', 'C Sonntag', 'F Sommerer', 'Z Tian', 'B Löppenberg', 'R J Palisaar', 'J Noldus', 'J Hanske', 'C von Bodman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Ultraschall Med""","""['Comparison of real-time elastography and multiparametric MRI for prostate cancer detection: a whole-mount step-section analysis.', 'Evaluation of the prostate imaging reporting and data system for the detection of prostate cancer by the results of targeted biopsy of the prostate.', 'Real-time MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy improves detection rates of prostate cancer in pre-biopsied patients.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Role of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of local prostate cancer recurrence after external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy.', 'The combined value of mpUS and mpMRI-TRUS fusion for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Application of Multiple Ultrasonic Techniques in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Ultrasound elastography.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of biparametric prostate MRI for prostate cancer in men at risk.', 'Is dynamic contrast enhancement still necessary in multiparametric magnetic resonance for diagnosis of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Methods:   We examined the expression level of eEF1A2 in 30 pairs of prostate cancer tissues by using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Then we applied siRNA specifically targeting eEF1A2 to down-regulate its expression in DU-145 and PC-3 cells.

Results:   Our results showed that the expression level of eEF1A2 in prostate cancer tissues was significantly higher compared to their corresponding normal tissues. Reduction of eEF1A2 expression in DU-145 and PC-3 cells led to a dramatic inhibition of proliferation accompanied with enhanced apoptosis rate. Western blot revealed that apoptosis pathway proteins (caspase3, BAD, BAX, PUMA) were significantly up-regulated after suppression of eEF1A2. More importantly, the levels of eEF1A2 and caspase3 were inversely correlated in prostate cancer tissues.

Although this treatment is usually initially effective at regressing tumors, most patients eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), for which there is no effective treatment and is generally fatal. Although several biologic mechanisms leading to CRPC development and their relative frequencies have been identified, it is difficult to determine which mechanisms of resistance are developing in a given patient. Personalized therapy that identifies and targets specific mechanisms of resistance developing in individual patients is likely one of the most promising methods of future cancer therapy. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a biomarker for monitoring tumor progression. We incorporated a cell death rate (CDR) function into a previous dynamical PSA model that was highly accurate at fitting clinical PSA data for 7 patients. The mechanism of action of IAD is largely induction of apoptosis, and each mechanism of resistance varies in its CDR dynamics. Thus, we analyze the CDR levels and their time-dependent oscillations to identify mechanisms of resistance to IAD developing in individual patients.""","""['Jason D Morken', 'Aaron Packer', 'Rebecca A Everett', 'John D Nagy', 'Yang Kuang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['New agents and strategies for the hormonal treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The utility of prostate-specific antigen in the management of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen response to deferred combined androgen blockade therapy using bicalutamide predicts survival after subsequent oestrogen and docetaxel therapies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The integration of nanotechnology for drug delivery can be exploited to overcome the major intrinsic limitations of DTX therapy for mCRPC. We evaluated whether reformulation of DTX by facile conjugation to carboxymethylcellulose nanoparticles (Cellax) can improve the efficacy and safety of the drug in s.c. and bone metastatic models of CRPC. A single dose of the nanoparticles completely regressed s.c. PC3 tumor xenografts in mice. In addition, Cellax elicited fewer side effects compared to native DTX. Importantly, Cellax did not increase the expression of drug resistance molecules in androgen-independent PC3 prostate cancer cells in comparison with DTX. Lastly, in a bone metastatic model of CRPC, Cellax treatment afforded a 2- to 3-fold improvement in survival and enhancements in quality-of-life of the animals over DTX and saline controls.

Current therapies are associated with severe side effects making it problematic for many multi-morbid patients to receive treatment. Prostate specific antigen, serum response factor (SRF), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), HIF-2α, E2F1 and Survivin are well known proteins being overexpressed in cancer cells, expediting cell growth and also demonstrated in prostate cancer cells. Targeting these genes using the RNA-Interference pathway could be a new approach for prostate cancer therapy with fewer side effects.  Methods:   Three prostate cancer cell lines were cultured under standard conditions and transfected with three different concentrations (25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM) of specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SRF, STAT3, HIF1α, HIF2α, E2F1 and Survivin in a non-viral manner. Cells treated with non-specific siRNA (SCR-siRNA) served as control. Changes of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The analysis of the effect of siRNA on the number of cells was detected using CASY cell counter system.  Results:   Transfections of the PC-3 cell line with specific siRNA especially against Survivin, E2F1, HIF1α- and HIF2α-siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of intracellular mRNA concentration together with a significant decreased number of cells. In the LnCAP and DU-145 cell lines Survivin and E2F1 showed similar effects. The impact of silencing STAT3 or SRF showed little influence on the amount of cells in all three cell lines.

Methods and study design:   Acute bladder toxicity was evaluated weekly by physicians using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). At the same time, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) were also assessed by each patient during radiation therapy. We contoured the bladder wall, solid bladder and trigone on the planning computed tomography and analyzed dose-volume histograms to determine which of these could be the most suitable dosimetric predictor.  Results:   Of 92 eligible patients, 27 (29%) demonstrated CTCAE grade 2 acute bladder toxicity, with nocturia as the most frequently observed symptom. IPSS demonstrated better agreement with CTCAE than OABSS. In receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, the largest area under the curve was observed for V20 of both the bladder wall and the bladder.  Conclusions:   Acute bladder toxicity during pelvic radiation therapy is not a trivial complication and should be actively investigated.

Results:   Haemoglobin difference between the pre- and the first postoperative day (group 1: 3.35 ± 1.16 g/dl; group 2: 3.56 ± 1.42 g/dl; p = 0.19), overall blood loss (group 1: 665 ± 431.5 ml; group 2: 705 ± 881 ml; p = 0.73) and transfusion rates (0.4% intraoperatively; 2.55% postoperatively; p = 1.0) did not show group differences. In regression analysis blood loss was influenced by preoperative haemoglobin levels (p < 0.0001), patients' weight (p = 0.018) and duration of the operation (p = 0.017).  Conclusions:   This study did not demonstrate a direct impact of TEA on intraoperative blood loss and transfusion rates in RRP. Further randomised clinical trials are needed to evaluate an impact of the different anaesthetic procedures presented alone or in combination on blood loss.""","""['Daniel Baumunk', 'Christof Maria Strang', 'Siegfried Kropf', 'Michael Schäfer', 'Mark Schrader', 'Steffen Weikert', 'Hannes Cash', 'Jan Breckwoldt', 'Kurt Miller', 'Thomas Hachenberg', 'Martin Schostak']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Combined spinal-epidural analgesia vs. intermittent bolus epidural analgesia for pain relief after major abdominal surgery.

It has been indicated that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity can be affected by ATRA treatment. Our previous results demonstrate the involvement of Cdk5 in the fate of prostate cancer cells. The purpose of this study is to examine whether Cdk5 is involved in ATRA-induced growth arrest of the castration-resistant cancer cell line DU145 through up-regulating Cdk inhibitor protein, p27.  Methods:   DU145 cells were treated with ATRA, and cell proliferation, protein expression, and protein localization of Cdk5/p27 were examined. Cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were also determined under Cdk5 inhibition induced by inhibitor or knockdown.  Results:   ATRA treatment inhibited DU145 cell proliferation and significantly increased p27 expression through Cdk5 up-regulation. Immunocytochemical data showed that a Cdk5 inhibitor reduced ATRA-triggered nuclear distribution of p27 in DU145 cells. The proliferation inhibition and G1 phase accumulation of DU145 cells were significantly increased by ATRA treatment, whereas Cdk5 inhibitor and siRNA could reverse these effects.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that ATRA induced growth inhibition in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells through activating Cdk5 and p27. We hope this finding will increase the knowledge of prostate cancer treatment and can be applied in patients' nutritional control in the future.""","""['Eugene Lin', 'Mei-Chih Chen', 'Chih-Yang Huang', 'Shih-Lan Hsu', 'William J Huang', 'Mao-Sheng Lin', 'Jungle Chi-Hsiang Wu', 'Ho Lin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['All-trans retinoic acid inhibits mesangial cell proliferation by up-regulating p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 and down-regulating Skp2.', 'Synergistic inhibitory effect of all-trans retinoic acid and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 on growth of human hepatoma cell line HepG2.', 'All-trans retinoic acid induces cell-cycle arrest in human cutaneous squamous carcinoma cells by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein 1 pathway.', 'Future Aspects of CDK5 in Prostate Cancer: From Pathogenesis to Therapeutic Implications.', 'Mechanistic insight of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in modulating lung cancer growth.', 'Augmented Therapeutic Potential of EC-Synthetic Retinoids in Caco-2 Cancer Cells Using an In Vitro Approach.', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor Activation Reduces Metastatic Prostate Cancer Bone Lesions by Blocking the Endothelial-to-Osteoblast Transition.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.', 'RET Regulates Human Medullary Thyroid Cancer Cell Proliferation through CDK5 and STAT3 Activation.', 'Pharmacoepigenomics circuits induced by a novel retinoid-polyamine conjugate in human immortalized keratinocytes.']"""

Classic demethylating agents, such as 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Decitabine), hold the potential for reprograming somatic cancer cells demonstrating high therapeutic efficacy in haematological malignancies. On the other hand, epigenetic treatment of solid tumours often gives rise to undesired cytotoxic side effects. Appropriate delivery systems able to enrich Decitabine at the site of action and improve its bioavailability would reduce the incidence of toxicity on healthy tissues. In this work we provide preclinical evidences of a safe, versatile and efficient targeted epigenetic therapy to treat hormone sensitive (LNCap) and hormone refractory (DU145) prostate cancers. A novel Decitabine formulation, based on the use of engineered erythrocyte (Erythro-Magneto-Hemagglutinin Virosomes, EMHVs) drug delivery system (DDS) carrying this drug, has been refined. Inside the EMHVs, the drug was shielded from the environment and phosphorylated in its active form. The novel magnetic EMHV DDS, endowed with fusogenic protein, improved the stability of the carried drug and exhibited a high efficiency in confining its delivery at the site of action in vivo by applying an external static magnetic field. Here we show that Decitabine loaded into EMHVs induces a significant tumour mass reduction in prostate cancer xenograft models at a concentration, which is seven hundred times lower than the therapeutic dose, suggesting an improved pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of drug. These results are relevant for and discussed in light of developing personalised autologous therapies and innovative clinical approach for the treatment of solid tumours.""","""['Ilaria Naldi', 'Monia Taranta', 'Lisa Gherardini', 'Gualtiero Pelosi', 'Federica Viglione', 'Settimio Grimaldi', 'Luca Pani', 'Caterina Cinti']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""[""Decitabine: 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine, Aza dC, DAC, dezocitidine, NSC 127716."", ""Decitabine: 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine, Aza dC, DAC, dezocitidine, NSC 127716."", 'Epigenetic therapy with decitabine for myelodysplasia and leukemia.', ""A phase II study of 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (decitabine) in hormone independent metastatic (D2) prostate cancer."", 'Downmodulation of dimethyl transferase activity enhances tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Decitabine Treatment Induces a Viral Mimicry Response in Cervical Cancer Cells and Further Sensitizes Cells to Chemotherapy.', 'Erythro-Magneto-HA-Virosome: A Bio-Inspired Drug Delivery System for Active Targeting of Drugs in the Lungs.', 'Silencing Survivin: a Key Therapeutic Strategy for Cardiac Hypertrophy.', 'Delivery of cancer therapies by synthetic and bio-inspired nanovectors.', 'Epigenetics in cancer therapy and nanomedicine.']"""

Gene encoding the enzyme is expressed in the prostate tissue and is polymorphic. CYP1A1*2A gene polymorphism is associated with elevated enzyme activity and/or inducibility which can lead to accumulation of genotoxic compounds and consequently to cancerogenesis. We examined the association of this polymorphism with prostate cancer (PCa) risk and aggressiveness. The case-control study consisted of 120 PCa patients and 120 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) controls, in Croatian population. Regarding aggressiveness, PCa patients were grouped according to the Gleason score (GS), tumor stage (T) and existence of distant metastasis (M). The polymorphism was analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We did not observe association of mutated allele with PCa risk, neither with PCa aggressiveness. Furthermore, frequency of polymorphic genotype was slightly higher in BPH group (16.6% vs. 14.2%, respectively) and also in less aggressive form of PCa (20.4% vs. 9.6% for GS < 7; 15.6% vs. 9.1% for T < 3; 16.7% vs. 10.0% for no distant metastasis).

The binding specificity of the agent was evaluated in human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and LNCaP, and antagonist properties determined by cell internalization and intracellular calcium mobilization studies.

Experimental design:   Tumor volume and GS were recorded from whole-mount histopathology for 131 men (median age, 60 years) who underwent endorectal diffusion-weighted MRI for local staging of prostate cancer before prostatectomy. VolumeADC and ADCmean were derived from ADC maps and correlated with histopathologic tumor volume and GS.

Areas under receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the performance of VolumeADC and ADCmean in discriminating tumors of GS 6 and GS ≥7.  Results:   Histopathology identified 116 tumor foci >0.5 mL. VolumeADC correlated significantly with histopathologic tumor volume (ρ = 0.683). The correlation increased with increasing GS (ρ = 0.453 for GS 6 tumors; ρ = 0.643 for GS 7 tumors; ρ = 0.980 for GS ≥8 tumors).

However, at multivariate analysis, only ADCmean (P = 0.0156) was a significant predictor of tumor aggressiveness (i.e., GS 6 vs. GS ≥7). For differentiating GS 6 from GS ≥7 tumors, AUCs were 0.644 and 0.704 for VolumeADC and ADCmean, respectively, and 0.749 for both parameters combined.

The effect of bifonazole on physiology of cancer cells is unclear. The effect of bifonazole on cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i) and viability in PC3 human prostate cancer cells was explored. The Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye, fura-2, was applied to measure [Ca(2+)]i. Bifonazole at concentrations of 5-30 µM induced a [Ca(2+)]i rise in a concentration-dependent manner. The response was reduced by 50% by removing extracellular Ca(2+). Bifonazole-evoked [Ca(2+)]i rise was not altered by nifedipine, econazole, SK&F96365 and protein kinase C activator, but was inhibited by 75% by GF109203X, a protein kinase C inhibitor. In Ca(2+)-free medium, treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) nearly abolished bifonazole-evoked [Ca(2+)]i rise. Conversely, treatment with bifonazole abolished BHQ-evoked [Ca(2+)]i rise. Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 abolished bifonazole-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise. At 30-100 µM, bifonazole decreased cell viability concentration-dependently, which was not reversed by chelating cytosolic Ca(2+) with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N″,N'-tetraacetic acid/acetoxy methyl. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining data suggest that bifonazole (30-100 µM) induced apoptosis concentration-dependently.

Using this system, we revealed the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in Rac1-dependent lamellipodial motility in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Through local blue laser irradiation of PA-Rac1-expressing cells, lamellipodial motility was reversibly induced. First, outward extension of a lamellipodium parallel to the substratum was observed. The extended lamellipodium then showed ruffling activity at the periphery. Notably, PI(3,4,5)P3 and WAVE2 were localized in the extending lamellipodium in a PI3K-dependent manner. We confirmed that the inhibition of PI3K activity greatly suppressed lamellipodial extension, while the ruffling activity was less affected.

Twenty-one were referred to our hospital with increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) values (>4ng/ml) and suspicion of prostate cancer. The other 10 men were volunteers without any history of prostate disease. DKI applying diffusion gradients in 20 different spatial directions with four b-values (0, 300, 600, 1000s/mm(2)) was performed additionally to standard functional prostate MRI. Region of interest (ROI)-based measurements were performed in all histopathologically verified lesions of every patient, as well as in the peripheral zone, and the central gland of each volunteer.  Results:   DKI showed a substantially better fit to the diffusion-weighted signal than the monoexponential apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Altogether, 29 lesions were biopsied in 14 different patients with the following results: Gleason score 3+3=6 (n=1), 3+4=7 (n=7), 4+3=7 (n=6), 4+4=8 (n=1), and 4+5=9 (n=2), and prostatitis (n=12).

This paper aims to develop and validate dynamic individual predictions that allow the possibility of a new treatment in order to help understand the benefit of initiating new treatments during the monitoring period. The prediction of the event in the next x years is done under two scenarios: (1) the patient initiates immediately a second treatment, (2) the patient does not initiate any treatment in the next x years. Predictions are derived from shared random-effect models. Applied to prostate cancer data, different specifications for the dependence between the prostate-specific antigen repeated measures, the initiation of a second treatment (hormonal therapy), and the risk of clinical recurrence are investigated and compared.

Autoantibodies to cyclin B1 were detected in 31.0% of sera from randomly selected patients with PCa versus 4.8% in sera with BPH. In the further analysis, 31.4% of sera from PCa patients at the early stage contained anti-cyclin B1 autoantibody, and even 29.4% of patients who had normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in their serum samples were observed anti-cyclin B1 positive. The cumulative positive rate of autoantibodies against seven selected TAAs (cyclin B1, survivin, p53, DFS70/LEDGFp75, RalA, MDM2, and NPM1) in PCa reached 80.5%, significantly higher than that in normal control sera. In summary, autoantibody to cyclin B1 might be a potential biomarker for the immunodiagnosis of early stage PCa, especially useful in patients with normal PSA level.

Recent studies suggest that SNAIL also takes part in metabolic reprogramming and chemotherapy resistance in some cancers. In prostate cancer (PCa), SNAIL has been proved to be required for hypoxia-induced invasion and as a potential marker for predicting the recurrence. However, the role of SNAIL in PCa aberrant metabolism is poorly understood. In this study, we identified that SNAIL regulated cellular growth and energy metabolism through the miR-128-mediated ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (RPS6KB1)/HIF-1α/PKM2 signaling pathway which played a key role in the reprogramming of cancer metabolism. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), we found that SNAIL expression was elevated in castration-resistant prostate cancer tissues compared with androgen-dependent prostate cancer tissues and nontumorous tissues. Depletion of SNAIL increased miR-128 expression levels, inhibited cell growth, reduced glucose consumption and lactate production, and repressed the expression of RPS6KB1, HIF-1α, and PKM2 in PCa cells. Luciferase reporter assays showed the SNAIL regulated miR-128 expression at the transcriptional level and miR-128 modulated RPS6KB1 expression at the translational level. Furthermore, down-expression of miR-128 partially restored the effect of si-SNAIL on the suppression of cellular growth, metabolism, and RPS6KB1/HIF-1α/PKM2 signaling pathway.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the pooled association of ESR1 rs9340799 and ESR2 rs1256049 polymorphisms with prostate cancer risk. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify related studies (up to February 2014) in several online databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI and Wanfang online libraries. A total of 16 eligible articles were enrolled in this updated meta-analysis. The result suggested that ESR1 rs9340799 polymorphism was significantly associated with prostate cancer in overall populations (GG+GA vs. AA: P = 0.002; G vs. A: P = 0.004), Caucasians (GG+GA vs. AA: P = 0.008; G vs. A: P = 0.016) and Africans (GG+GA vs. AA: P = 0.005; G vs. A: P = 0.006), but not in Asians (GG+GA vs. AA: P = 0.462; G vs. A: P = 0.665). The result also showed that there was a significant association between ESR2 rs1256049 polymorphism and prostate cancer in Caucasians (AA+AG vs. GG: P = 0.016; A vs. G: P = 0.005), but no association in overall populations (AA+AG vs. GG: P = 0.826; A vs. G: P = 0.478), Asians (AA+AG vs. GG: P = 0.177; A vs. G: P = 0.703) and Africans (AA+AG vs. GG: P = 0.847; A vs. G: P = 0.707).

Materials and methods:   An institutional database was queried to identify 1,136 patients who underwent open retropubic or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between January 5, 1993 and December 29, 2008. After applying exclusion criteria we used serum prostate specific antigen and the prostate specific antigen pattern during the first 3 years of followup to divide 566 men into 3 groups, including 1) undetectable prostate specific antigen (0.03 ng/ml or less), 2) low detectable-stable prostate specific antigen (greater than 0.03 and less than 0.2 ng/ml, no 2 subsequent increases and/or prostate specific antigen velocity less than 0.05 ng per year) and 3) low detectable-unstable prostate specific antigen (greater than 0.03 and less than 0.2 ng/ml, 2 subsequent increases according to NCCN criteria and/or prostate specific antigen velocity 0.05 ng per year or greater). The primary end point was biochemical recurrence, defined as prostate specific antigen 0.2 ng/ml or greater, or receipt of radiation therapy beyond 3 years of followup.

The inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity by NSAIDs plays a role in their anti-tumorigenic properties. NSAIDs also have COX-independent activity which is not fully understood. In this study, we report a novel COX-independent mechanism of sulindac sulfide (SS), which facilitates a previously uncharacterized cleavage of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) protein. EpCAM is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that has been implemented as an over-expressed oncogene in many cancers including colon, breast, pancreas, and prostate. We found EpCAM to be down-regulated by SS in a manner that is independent of COX activity, transcription regulation, de novo protein synthesis, and proteasomal degradation pathway. Our findings clearly demonstrate that SS drives cleavage of the extracellular portion of EpCAM near the N-terminus. This SS driven cleavage is blocked by a deleting amino acids 55-81 as well as simply mutating arginine residues at positions 80 and 81 to alanine of EpCAM. Proteolysis of EpCAM by SS may provide a novel mechanism by which NSAIDs affect anti-tumorigenesis at the post-translational level.""","""['Jason L Liggett', 'Kyung-Won Min', 'Dmitriy Smolensky', 'Seung Joon Baek']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac sulfide suppresses structural protein Nesprin-2 expression in colorectal cancer cells.', 'Apo2L/TRAIL differentially modulates the apoptotic effects of sulindac and a COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent in Bax-deficient cells.', 'Sulindac modulates secreted protein expression from LIM1215 colon carcinoma cells prior to apoptosis.', 'Regulation of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).', 'Anti-tumor activity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: cyclooxygenase-independent targets.', 'Optimization of Erlotinib Plus Sulindac Dosing Regimens for Intestinal Cancer Prevention in an Apc-Mutant Model of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP).', 'Cyclooxygenase inhibitors combined with deuterium-enriched water augment cytotoxicity in A549 lung cancer cell line via activation of apoptosis and MAPK pathways.', 'Effects of sulindac sulfide on proliferation and apoptosis of human breast cancer cell.', ""Marketed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antihypertensives, and human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors: as-yet-unused weapons of the oncologists' arsenal."", 'NSAIDs: learning new tricks from old drugs.']"""

EValuation of pharmaceutical Innovations with regard to Therapeutic Advantage (EVITA) is a recently developed drug assessment strategy that provides a detailed and clinically relevant evaluation of new agents compared to standard therapies. We therefore sought to use EVITA to evaluate eight novel agents recently introduced to clinical practice or in late-stage trials for the treatment of prostate cancer, metastatic melanoma, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  Methods:   Eight agents (abiraterone, enzalutamide, sipuleucel-T, Prostvac, radium 223, ipilimumab, vemurafenib, and belimumab) were selected for study using the EVITA algorithm. A comprehensive literature search was performed to find clinical trial data, which were then classified using the EVITA protocol. EVITA was also compared to results from health technology assessments (HTAs) or reimbursement decisions.  Results:   The EVITA scores for the eight drugs ranged from 5.5 to 9: all the selected agents are therefore classed as 'recommended' and are likely to produce a therapeutic advantage. In particular, vemurafenib is likely to be highly beneficial to patients with metastatic melanoma and radium 223 to patients with metastatic prostate cancer affecting the bone. The EVITA results were generally concordant with HTAs.  Conclusions:   All the agents show favourable EVITA scores and are therefore recommended for clinical practice.

Materials and methods:   We carried out a literature search in PubMed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported from January 2000 to December 2013. Summary incidence, relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects or fixed-effects models based on the heterogeneity of the included studies.  Results:   A total of 26,833 patients from 33 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Bevacizumab-containing therapy significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade (RR 3.35, 95% CI 2.35-4.79, P < 0.001) and fatal GI perforation (RR 3.08, 95%CI: 1.04-9.08, P = 0.042). On subgroup analysis, no significant risk differences were found based on bevacizumab dosage, treatment duration, treatment line, type of clinical trial and median age. When stratified by tumor types, a significantly increased risk of GI perforation with bevacizumab was observed in colorectal cancer (RR 2.84, 95% CI 1.43-5.61, P = 0.003), gynecologic cancer (RR 3.37, 95% CI 1.71-6.62, P < 0.001) and prostate cancer (RR 6.01, 95% CI 1.78-20.28, P = 0.004).

We investigated whether bone-related serum markers differentiate PSA flare from progression in CRPC patients with bone metastasis.  Methods:   We reviewed CRPC patients with bone metastasis who received systemic chemotherapy from 2002 to 2008. Pretreatment baseline and follow-up data including age, performance score, PSA, Gleason score, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium level, and hemoglobin were evaluated. Pretreatment parameters and follow-up serum parameters after the first cycle of chemotherapy were included in statistical analyses.  Results:   PSA increased in 38 patients (45.8 %) at the first evaluation after chemotherapy. Among the PSA rises, PSA increased continuously or did not decrease to the stabilization level by the third evaluation in 22 (26.5 %) patients, while PSA decreased to the stabilization or response level by the third evaluation in 16 (19.3 %). PSA flare occurred in 17 (20.5 %). The univariate analyses showed that no baseline parameters were associated with PSA flare, but the initial ALP decrease, changed ALP ratio, and median calcium level were significantly associated with PSA flare (p = 0.001, p = 0.008 and p = 0.012, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a change in the ALP level is an independent predictive factor for PSA flare (p = 0.017).

The association between VEGF-C expression, microlymphatic count (MLC), and staining intensity for nm23H1 and VEGFR-3 was used to evaluate tumor metastasis and survival rate. MLC values were significantly higher in tumorous tissue than in non-cancerous tissue. VEGF-C mRNA, VEGFR-3, and nm23H1 were highly expressed in tumorous tissue. VEGFR-3 expression was greater in VEGF-C mRNA-positive tumors than in VEGF-C mRNA-negative tumors. The association of VEGFR-3 expression with VEGF-C mRNA and MLC suggested that the poor prognosis and tumor metastasis associated with VEGFR-3 expression may be due, in part, to its role in promoting angiogenesis.

After oral administration, tasquinimod and a number of its metabolites are excreted in the urine. The quantitative determination of tasquinimod in urine is challenging because of the required sensitivity (down to 0.1nM or 40pg/mL), the highly variable nature of this biological matrix and the presence of potentially unstable metabolites, which may convert back to the parent drug. In this article, an LC-MS/MS method is described for the determination of tasquinimod in human urine in the concentration range 0.1-200nM. Liquid-liquid extraction with n-chlorobutane was used to extract tasquinimod from 100μL human urine and to remove interfering endogenous urinary constituents. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source was used for quantification of tasquinimod in a 2.5-min run. A stable-isotope labeled internal standard was used for response normalization. The intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation (precision) as well as the bias (accuracy) of the method were below 7%. Although considerable conversion of conjugated tasquinimod metabolites back to parent drug was observed when incurred samples were stored at 37°C for a prolonged time, tasquinimod as well as its metabolites were sufficiently stable under all relevant sampling, storage and analysis conditions. The method was successfully applied to determine the urinary excretion of tasquinimod in healthy volunteers and patients with renal impairment after a 0.5-mg oral dose.""","""['Nico C van de Merbel', 'Peter Walland', 'Mikael Tiensuu', 'Carl J Sennbro']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci""","""['Bioanalysis in clinical development of tasquinimod using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Quantitative determination of 8-isoprostaglandin F(2α) in human urine using microfluidic chip-based nano-liquid chromatography with on-chip sample enrichment and tandem mass spectrometry.', 'HPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of cytarabine in human plasma.', 'Androgen glucuronides analysis by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry: could it raise new perspectives in the diagnostic field of hormone-dependent malignancies?', 'Mechanisms of action of tasquinimod on the tumour microenvironment.']"""

In this study, we examined whether the TGF-β signaling pathway is associated with ER signaling in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, which express ERα, ERβ and ARs. We determined whether the exposure to phthalates may induce prostate cancer progression by affecting molecular crosstalk between ER and TGF-β signaling pathways. Cell viability was measured in LNCaP cells by MTT assay following treatment with di-n-buthyl phthalate (DBP). RT-PCR and immunoblot assay were performed to examine the expression levels of cell cycle-related genes and the TGF-β signaling cascade. A mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer was generated, and immunohistochemical and BrdU assay were carried out to determine the effect of DBP in this mouse model. DBP, a type of phthalate, was shown to promote LNCaP cell proliferation by upregulating the gene expression of c-myc and cyclin D1 and by downregulating the expression of p21. DBP significantly reduced the protein expression of p-smad similarly to E2. These regulations caused by DBP were reversed by ICI 182,780, an ER antagonist, indicating that DBP may affect crosstalk between TGF-β and ER signals. In an in vivo mouse model, tumor volume of mice exposed to DBP was increased. Number of cells in S phase of cell cycle was increased by DBP, while expression of p21 protein was reduced in the tissues of DBP-treated mice.

Tight junctions (TJs) are crucial to the process of metastasis and have been previously shown to be regulated by HGF. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of HGF on the function of TJs in human prostate epithelial, prostate stem cell-like and prostate cancer cell lines. Four human prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, DU-145, PZHPV-7, CaHPV-10), normal adult prostate parental epithelial cells (RWPE-1) and a stem cell-like derivative of RWPE-1 (WPE-STEM) were used to assess HGF-induced changes in TJs. A significant difference was noted in the behaviour between the WPE-STEM, RWPE-1 and the cancer cell lines which was HGF concentration-dependent. However, in the WPE-STEM cells, the effect was biphasic, with the cells seemingly resistant to HGF-modulated TJ disruption. Closer examination revealed that HGF affected the redistribution of ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3 away from the TJs of confluent cells with concurrent loss of claudin-1 and claudin-5, and western blot analysis revealed a loss in TJ protein expression of ZO-1 and ZO-2. We demonstrated for the first time that HGF regulates TJ function in human prostate cells. Moreover, this regulation was dependent on the tumourigenicity of the cells, with the most aggressive cells most susceptible and the stem cell-like cells least susceptible.

We identified 12 226 cases of PCa and used risk-set sampling to select 10 population controls per case (n=122,260) from among men alive on the index date and born in the same year. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using subjects who had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing prior to 1 yr before the index date.  Intervention:   Metformin exposure was assessed using prescriptions redeemed before the index date.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression. The association between metformin use and PCa diagnosis was determined, controlling for diabetes severity and other potential confounders.  Results and limitations:   Metformin users were at decreased risk of PCa diagnosis compared with never-users (adjusted OR [aOR]: 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96).

Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a potent endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis, is down-regulated in prostate cancer cells. We hypothesized that the transduction of PEDF in prostate cancer cells will down-regulate V-ATPase function; that in turn will decrease the expression of the V-ATPase accessory protein ATP6ap2 and a-subunit isoforms that target V-ATPase to the cell surface. To test these hypotheses, we used the human androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells LNCaP, and its castration-refractory-derivative CL1 that were engineered to stably co-express the DsRed Express Fluorescent Protein with or without PEDF. To determine if PEDF down-regulates the function of V-ATPase, we measured the rate of proton fluxes (JH+) of the cytosolic and endosome/lysosome compartments.

The results showed that PEDF expression decreased the rate of JH+ in metastatic CL1 cells without affecting JH+ in non-metastatic LNCaP cells, when studying pH(cyt). Interestingly, PEDF did not affect JH+ in endosomes/lysosomes either in metastatic cells or in non-metastatic cells. We also showed that PEDF significantly decreases the levels of a4 isoform and ATP6ap2 in metastatic CL1 cells, without affecting the levels of a4 isoform in the non-metastatic LNCaP cells.

We assessed the clinicopathological factors that are potentially related to expression of Gli1, the transcription factor that is thought to be the most reliable marker of hedgehog pathway activation in bladder cancer.  Methods:   Bladder cancer cases were identified from the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry as histologically confirmed primary bladder cancer diagnosed between January 1, 2002, and July 31, 2004. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on a tissue microarray to detect Gli1 and p53 expression in these bladder tumors. We computed odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs for Gli1 positivity for pathological category using T category (from TNM), invasiveness, and grade with both the World Health Organization 1973 and World Health Organization International Society of Urological Pathology criteria.

Results:   A total of 194 men and 67 women, whose tumors were assessable for Gli1 staining, were included in the study. No appreciable differences in Gli1 staining were noted by sex, age, smoking status, or high-risk occupation. Ta-category tumors were more likely to stain for Gli1 as compared with T1-category tumors (adjusted OR = 0.38, CI: 0.17-0.87). Similarly, low-grade (grades 1-2) tumors were more likely to stain for Gli1 as compared with high-grade tumors (grade 3) (adjusted OR = 0.44, CI: 0.21-0.93). In a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors expressing Gli1 were less likely to recur (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.48; CI: 0.28-0.82; P<0.05) than those in which Gli1 was absent.

Materials and methods:   The study comprised a cross-sectional analysis of 725 men included in a prostate cancer screening program at University of Sao Paulo Medical School. The serum concentrations of total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured. Variables analyzed were age, American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score, storage symptoms, voiding symptoms, quality of life score, prostate specific antigen levels and prostate volume. Obesity was measured through the calculation of body mass index (BMI). A regression analysis model was performed.  Results:   Median patient age was 65 years (48 to 94). A higher TT level was significantly associated with a severe AUA symptom score only among patients with a BMI ≥ 25. Median TT was 371, 370 and 427ng/dL (p = 0.017) in patients with mild, moderate and severe LUTS respectively. The multivariate regression analysis in patients with BMI ≥ 25 showed that only age, TT and sex score were related to LUTS.

The purpose of AS is to defer definitive therapy in these patients to avoid treatment-related complications. Our aim was to determine the pathological features of the surgical specimen from potential AS candidates that underwent radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed a group of patients submitted to RP who met criteria for AS: Gleason score (GS) ≤ 3+3 = 6, PSA ≤ 10ng/mL, T1c - T2a,< 1/3 of positive cores, < 50% of involvement in any core and PSA density < 0.15. We determined the concordance between GS in biopsy and RP specimen (RPS). Other pathological features of the RPS were also analyzed, including surgical margins, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicles and lymph node involvement.  Results:   We identified 167 patients subjected to RP that met the criteria for AS. Fifty two patients (31.1%) had a GS > 6 in the RPS (GS 7 n = 49; GS 8 n = 3). Extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle and lymph node involvement was found in 6.1%, 3.1% and 1.2% of the specimens, respectively.  Conclusion:   In this study a significant proportion of potential candidates for AS showed features of aggressive and/or high-risk tumors in the RPS. Therefore, before considering a patient for an AS protocol, a proper and strict selection must be performed, and informed consent is crucial for these patients.""","""['Z Norman', 'P Militza', 'F Andres', 'F Daniela', 'M Alejandro', 'S Catherine', 'F Juan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Definitive pathology at radical prostatectomy is commonly favorable in men following initial active surveillance.', 'Population based study of predictors of adverse pathology among candidates for active surveillance with Gleason 6 prostate cancer.', 'Pathological stage distribution in patients treated with radical prostatectomy reflecting the need for protocol-based active surveillance: results from a contemporary European patient cohort.', 'Prostatectomy pathology findings in an active surveillance population.', 'Active surveillance in prostate cancer.', 'Predicting Gleason score using the initial serum total prostate-specific antigen in Black men with symptomatic prostate adenocarcinoma in Nigeria.', 'Validation of Selection Criteria for Active Surveillance in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Our objective is to assess whether the status of surgical margins, the extent and the Gleason score of positive margins, and the extent of the extraprostatic extension are predictive of biochemical recurrence post-radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Three hundred sixty-five radical prostatectomy specimens were analyzed. The length of the positive surgical margin and extraprostatic extension and the Gleason score of the margin were recorded. Statistical analyses examined the predictive value of these variables for biochemical recurrence.  Results:   236 patients were stage pT2R0, 58 pT2R1, 25 pT3R0 and 46 pT3R1. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 11%, 31%, 20% and 45.7% of pT2R0, pT2R1, pT3R0 and pT3R1, respectively. The extent of the positive surgical margins and the Gleason score of the positive surgical margins were not associated with biochemical recurrence in univariate analysis in a mean follow up period of 35.9 months. In multivariate analyses, only the status of the surgical margins and the global Gleason score were associated with biochemical recurrence, with a risk of recurrence of 3.1 for positive surgical margins and of 3.8 for a Gleason score > 7.  Conclusion:   Positive surgical margin and the global Gleason score are significant risk factors for biochemical recurrence post-radical prostatectomy, regardless of the extent of the surgical margin, the extent of the extraprostatic extension, or the local Gleason score of the positive surgical margin or extraprostatic tissue. pT2R1 disease behaves as pT3R0 and should be treated similarly.""","""['Katia R M Leite', 'Carolina Hartmann', 'Sabrina T Reis', 'Nayara Viana', ""Marcos F Dall'Oglio"", ""Alexandre C Sant'Anna"", 'Adriano Nesrallah', 'Luciano Nesrallah', 'Alberto A Antunes', 'Luiz H Camara-Lopes', 'Miguel Srougi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Presence or absence of a positive pathological margin outperforms any other margin-associated variable in predicting clinically relevant biochemical recurrence in Gleason 7 prostate cancer.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Presence of positive surgical margin in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer equals to extracapsular extension negative surgical margin.

Reducing cell proliferation, estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) is emerging as a potential target in PC chemoprevention. Among the known selective ERbeta ligands, 3beta-Adiol, the endogenous ligand in the prostate, has been proved to counteract PC progression. This study compares the effects of chronic exposure (1-12 weeks) to different ERbeta selective ligands (DPN, 8beta-VE2, 3beta-Adiol) on proliferation of human androgen-responsive CWR22Rv1 cells, representing an intermediate phenotype between the AD- and CR-PC. 3beta-Adiol (10 nM) is the sole ligand decreasing cell proliferation and increasing p21 levels. In vitro transcriptional activity assays were performed to elucidate different behavior between 3beta-Adiol and the other ligands; in these experiments the endogenous and the main ERbeta subtype activation were considered. It is concluded that ERbeta activation has positive effects also in androgen-responsive PC.

AFLS used excitation at 447 nm with four emission wavelengths (532, 562, 632, and 684 nm), where their lifetimes and weights were analyzed using a double exponent model. LRS was measured between 500 and 840 nm and analyzed by a quantitative model to determine hemoglobin concentrations and light scattering. Both AFLS and LRS were taken on n = 724 distinct locations from both prostate capsular (nc = 185) and parenchymal (np = 539) tissues, including PCa tissue, benign peripheral zone tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), of fresh ex vivo radical prostatectomy specimens from 37 patients with high volume, intermediate-to-high-grade PCa (Gleason score, GS ≥7). AFLS and LRS parameters from parenchymal tissues were analyzed for statistical testing and classification. A feature selection algorithm based on multinomial logistic regression was implemented to identify critical parameters in order to classify high-grade PCa tissue. The regression model was in turn used to classify PCa tissue at the individual aggressive level of GS = 7,8,9. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated and used to determine classification accuracy for each tissue type. We show that our dual-modal technique resulted in accuracies of 87.9%, 90.1%, and 85.1% for PCa classification at GS = 7, 8, 9 within parenchymal tissues, and up to 91.1%, 91.9%, and 94.3% if capsular tissues were included for detection.

Methods:   A hospital-based registry of cancer patients was formed using records from the primary oncology center in eastern Libya - focusing on those diagnosed in the year 2012.  Results:   The most common malignancies in men were cancers of the colon (22.3%, n = 90), lung (20.3%, n = 82), prostate (16.1%, n = 65), pancreas (4.2%, n = 17) and liver (4.2%, n = 17). For women, they were found to be cancers of the breast (41.5%, n = 213), colon (16.4%, n = 84), uterus (8%, n = 41), ovary (5.5%, n = 28) and pancreas (3.1%, n = 16). Additionally age-standardized rates (ASR) were determined for Libya. The different cities and towns in eastern Libya were compared for any variation. The city of Beida in particular was found to have a remarkably high incidence of gastric cancer. The different findings were discussed and comparisons were made with past literature as well as the incidence rates for neighbouring countries. The incidence rates given for the eastern region showed differences from previously reported values (i.e., the rate of colon cancer was the highest in North Africa whereas other malignancies occurred less frequently). Potential explanations for the urban-rural difference as well as the difference in incidence rates were put forth. The significance of this study is that it establishes a baseline of cancer incidence which should be the backbone for any future national cancer plan in Libya.

The detection of rearrangement is typically done by using short reads generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and combining the reads with knowledge of a reference genome. Because structural variations and genomes differ from one person to another, intermediate comparison via a reference genome may lead to loss of information.  Results:   In this article, we propose a reference-free method for detecting clusters of breakpoints from the chromosomal rearrangements. This is done by directly comparing a set of NGS normal reads with another set that may be rearranged. Our method SlideSort-BPR (breakpoint reads) is based on a fast algorithm for all-against-all comparisons of short reads and theoretical analyses of the number of neighboring reads. When applied to a dataset with a sequencing depth of 100×, it finds ∼ 88% of the breakpoints correctly with no false-positive reads. Moreover, evaluation on a real prostate cancer dataset shows that the proposed method predicts more fusion transcripts correctly than previous approaches, and yet produces fewer false-positive reads. To our knowledge, this is the first method to detect breakpoint reads without using a reference genome.

We examined the association between level of eGFR and the risk of incident cancer; the primary outcome was renal cancer, and secondary outcomes were any cancer and specific cancers (urothelial, prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal). During 6,000,420 person-years of follow-up, we identified 76,809 incident cancers in 72,875 subjects. After adjustment for time-updated confounders, lower eGFR (in milliliters per minute per 1.73 m(2)) was associated with an increased risk of renal cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.22 to 1.58 for eGFR=45-59; HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.17 for eGFR=30-44; HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.78 to 2.92 for eGFR<30). We also observed an increased risk of urothelial cancer at eGFR<30 but no significant associations between eGFR and prostate, breast, lung, colorectal, or any cancer overall.

This study was designed to investigate stromal changes in patients with clinically advanced PCa and analyze their prognostic significance. Prostate needle biopsies obtained from 148 patients before castration therapy were analyzed by Masson trichrome staining and immunohistochemical analysis of vimentin and desmin. Reactive stroma grading was inversely correlated with Gleason score. Stroma grade (Masson stain 82.8% vs 45.6%, P < 0.001) and vimentin expression (P = 0.005) were significantly higher, and desmin expression (P = 0.004) significantly lower, in reactive stroma of tumors with a Gleason score of 6-7 than in adjacent peritumoral tissue. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant association between reactive stroma grade in tumors and the occurrence of CRPC in patients with a Gleason score of 6-7 (P = 0.009). Furthermore, patients with higher vimentin or lower desmin expression had a shorter disease-free period. In multivariate analysis, only vimentin expression was a significant predictor of tumor relapse (hazard ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.12-10.26, P = 0.012). These findings indicate that the intensity of reactive stroma is associated with castration responsiveness, especially in patients with a lower Gleason score where the abundant stroma component is most frequently found. High expression of vimentin in tumor stroma was independently associated with poor outcomes in patients with Gleason scores of 6-7, and may serve as a new prognostic marker in daily practice.""","""['Jian-Ping Wu', 'Wen-Bin Huang', 'Hui Zhou', 'Lu-Wei Xu', 'Jian-Hua Zhao', 'Jia-Gen Zhu', 'Jiang-Hao Su', 'Hong-Bin Sun']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Intensity of stromal changes predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostatic carcinoma.', 'Asporin is a stromally expressed marker associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Reactive stroma as a predictor of biochemical-free recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'Sarcomas and related proliferative lesions of specialized prostatic stroma: a clinicopathologic study of 22 cases.', 'Stromal cell interplay in prostate development, physiology, and pathological conditions.', '""Stromal cells in prostate cancer pathobiology: friends or foes?"".', 'Development and validation of a quantitative reactive stroma biomarker (qRS) for prostate cancer prognosis.', 'VEGF Expression, Cellular Infiltration, and Intratumoral Collagen Levels after Electroporation-Based Treatment of Dogs with Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Identification of SPP1 as an Extracellular Matrix Signature for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrative metabolic and transcriptomic profiling of prostate cancer tissue containing reactive stroma.']"""

FOXA1 is not required for AR-chromatin interaction, but instrumental in recruiting AR to low-affinity half-AREs by opening local chromatin around adjacent FKHD sites. Too much FOXA1 creates excessive open chromatin regions, which serve as reservoirs that retain AR via abundant half-AREs, thereby reducing its availability for specific sites. FOXA1 downregulation, by contrast, relinquishes AR to permissively bind AREs across the genome, resulting in substantial AR-binding events and AR target gene expression even in the absence of androgen.

QH thus could serve as an important complementary tool for pathologists in interrogating and interpreting cancer morphology and malignancy. In the US, annually, over 60,000 prostate cancer patients undergo radical prostatectomy treatment. Around 10,000 of these men experience biochemical recurrence within 5 years of surgery, a marker for local or distant disease recurrence. The ability to predict the risk of biochemical recurrence soon after surgery could allow for adjuvant therapies to be prescribed as necessary to improve long term treatment outcomes. The underlying hypothesis with our approach, co-occurring gland angularity (CGA), is that in benign or less aggressive prostate cancer, gland orientations within local neighborhoods are similar to each other but are more chaotically arranged in aggressive disease. By modeling the extent of the disorder, we can differentiate surgically removed prostate tissue sections from (a) benign and malignant regions and (b) more and less aggressive prostate cancer. For a cohort of 40 intermediate-risk (mostly Gleason sum 7) surgically cured prostate cancer patients where half suffered biochemical recurrence, the CGA features were able to predict biochemical recurrence with 73% accuracy.

Galeterone is also a direct androgen receptor (AR) antagonist and may enhance AR degradation. This study was undertaken to determine the molecular basis for AR effects and their therapeutic potential.  Experimental design:   Effects of galeterone on AR expression and activities were examined in prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   Similar to the AR antagonist enzalutamide, but in contrast to bicalutamide, galeterone did not induce binding of a constitutively active VP16-AR fusion protein to reporter genes and did not induce AR recruitment to endogenous androgen-regulated genes based on chromatin immunoprecipitation. Galeterone at low micromolar concentrations that did not induce cellular stress responses enhanced AR protein degradation in LNCaP and C4-2 cells, which express a T878A mutant AR, but not in prostate cancer cells expressing wild-type AR. Further transfection studies using stable LNCaP and PC3 cell lines ectopically expressing wild-type or T878A-mutant ARs confirmed that galeterone selectively enhances degradation of the T878A-mutant AR.  Conclusions:   Similar to enzalutamide, galeterone may be effective as a direct AR antagonist in CRPC. It may be particularly effective against prostate cancer cells with the T878A AR mutation but may also enhance degradation of wild-type AR in vivo through a combination of direct and indirect mechanisms. Finally, these findings show that conformational changes in AR can markedly enhance its degradation and thereby support efforts to develop further antagonists that enhance AR degradation.""","""['Ziyang Yu', 'Changmeng Cai', 'Shuai Gao', 'Nicholas I Simon', 'Howard C Shen', 'Steven P Balk']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Galeterone and VNPT55 induce proteasomal degradation of AR/AR-V7, induce significant apoptosis via cytochrome c release and suppress growth of castration resistant prostate cancer xenografts in vivo.', 'Androgen Receptor Modulation Optimized for Response-Splice Variant: A Phase 3, Randomized Trial of Galeterone Versus Enzalutamide in Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7-expressing Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Galeterone for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer: the evidence to date.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Targeted Degradation of Androgen Receptor by VNPP433-3β in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells Implicates Interaction with E3 Ligase MDM2 Resulting in Ubiquitin-Proteasomal Degradation.', 'Novel AR/AR-V7 and Mnk1/2 Degrader, VNPP433-3β: Molecular Mechanisms of Action and Efficacy in AR-Overexpressing Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer In Vitro and In Vivo Models.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'An Overview of Next-Generation Androgen Receptor-Targeted Therapeutics in Development for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Eighty Years of Targeting Androgen Receptor Activity in Prostate Cancer: The Fight Goes on.']"""

In spite of the high prevalence, the etiology and pathophysiology of BPH is unclear due to the lack of any established rodent model for study. It has been demonstrated that the cadmium (Cd) mimics the activity of androgen or estrogen by interacting with the steroid hormone receptors in the prostate and elicits BPH, but the specific receptor which binds to Cd is still unknown. Our lab studies with BPH patients highlighted a strong co-relation between smokings with increased Cd content. Changes in the maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) level further supports that Cd can induce BPH like condition. Therefore, the present study was aimed to induce BPH like condition in rats by Cd administration. The dose of cadmium was standardized in an age- and time-dependent manner, which was further examined by prostate weight, histology, and PAP levels that elucidated the pathogenesis of BPH. Further to understand the molecular basis, steroid hormone receptor antagonist experiment was performed. Gene expression and immunohistochemistry data suggest that Cd induces hyperplasia like condition by activating the androgen receptor and estrogen receptor-α and suppresses the action of estrogen receptor-β. The experimental model used here is a cost effective, less time consuming and potentially valuable tool for investigating the respective functions of epithelial and stromal hormone receptors. The applicability of this model would be helpful in understanding the pathogenesis of BPH and its progression.""","""['Akhilesh Prajapati', 'Akshay Rao', 'Jhanvi Patel', 'Sharad Gupta', 'Sarita Gupta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Exp Biol Med (Maywood)""","""['Clinical and experimental studies of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Association of cadmium and lead with antioxidant status and incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients of Western India.', 'Hormone concentration, metabolic disorders and immunoexpression of androgen and estrogen-alpha receptors in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and testosterone deficiency syndrome.', 'Oncogenic transformation of human benign prostate hyperplasia with chronic cadmium exposure.', 'Androgen, estrogen, and progesterone receptors in normal and aging prostates.', ""EDC-2: The Endocrine Society's Second Scientific Statement on Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals."", 'Estrogens and Male Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction.']"""

A retrospective analysis of 1,188 sextants of the prostate""","""Purpose:   The role of HistoScanning™ (HS) in prostate biopsy is still indeterminate. Existing literature is sparse and controversial. To provide more evidence according to that important clinical topic, we analyzed institutional data from the Martini-Clinic, Prostate Cancer Center, Hamburg.  Methods:   Patients who received prostate biopsy and who also received HS were included in the study cohort. A single examiner, blinded to pathological results, re-analyzed all HS data in accordance with sextants of the prostate. Each sextant was considered as an individual case. Corresponding results from biopsy and HS were analyzed. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the prediction of a positive biopsy by HS was calculated. Furthermore, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were assessed according to different HS signal volume cutoffs (>0, >0.2 and >0.5 ml).  Results:   Overall, 198 men were identified and 1,188 sextants were analyzed. The AUC to predict positive biopsy results by HS was 0.58.

The mechanism by which anti-CTLA-4 antibodies induces antitumor responses is controversial. To determine the effects of CTLA-4 blockade on the T cell repertoire, we used next-generation deep sequencing to measure the frequency of individual rearranged T cell receptor β (TCRβ) genes, thereby characterizing the diversity of rearrangements, known as T cell clonotypes. CTLA-4 blockade in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and metastatic melanoma resulted in both expansion and loss of T cell clonotypes, consistent with a global turnover of the T cell repertoire. Overall, this treatment increased TCR diversity as reflected in the number of unique TCR clonotypes. The repertoire of clonotypes continued to evolve over subsequent months of treatment. Whereas the number of clonotypes that increased with treatment was not associated with clinical outcome, improved overall survival was associated with maintenance of high-frequency clones at baseline. In contrast, the highest-frequency clonotypes fell with treatment in patients with short overall survival. Stably maintained clonotypes included T cells having high-avidity TCR such as virus-reactive T cells. Together, these results suggest that CTLA-4 blockade induces T cell repertoire evolution and diversification. Moreover, improved clinical outcomes are associated with less clonotype loss, consistent with the maintenance of high-frequency TCR clonotypes during treatment. These clones may represent the presence of preexisting high-avidity T cells that may be relevant in the antitumor response.""","""['Edward Cha', 'Mark Klinger', 'Yafei Hou', 'Craig Cummings', 'Antoni Ribas', 'Malek Faham', 'Lawrence Fong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Sci Transl Med""","""['Radiotherapy and CTLA-4 Blockade Shape the TCR Repertoire of Tumor-Infiltrating T Cells.', 'Immune Toxicities Elicted by CTLA-4 Blockade in Cancer Patients Are Associated with Early Diversification of the T-cell Repertoire.', 'Combination immunotherapy induces distinct T-cell repertoire responses when administered to patients with different malignancies.', 'Recent Advances in Targeting CD8 T-Cell Immunity for More Effective Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 and immune checkpoint blockade.', 'First-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive esophagogastric adenocarcinoma: liquid biomarker analysis of the phase 2 INTEGA trial.', 'A multispecies framework for modeling adaptive immunity and immunotherapy in cancer.', 'Targets of Immune Escape Mechanisms in Cancer: Basis for Development and Evolution of Cancer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.', 'HNRNPC suppresses tumor immune microenvironment by activating Treg cells promoting the progression of prostate cancer.', 'T-cell repertoire diversity: friend or foe for protective antitumor response?']"""

The purpose of this study was to provide economic evidence to the decision makers of the NCSP.  Materials and methods:   A cost-utility analysis was performed on the adoption of PSA screening program among men aged 50-74-years in Korea from the healthcare system perspective. Several data sources were used for the cost-utility analysis, including general health screening data, the Korea Central Cancer Registry, national insurance claims data, and cause of mortality from the National Statistical Office. To solicit the utility index of prostate cancer, a face-to-face interview for typical men aged 40 to 69 was conducted using a Time-Trade Off method.  Results:   As a result, the increase of effectiveness was estimated to be very low, when adopting PSA screening, and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was analyzed as about 94 million KRW. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the incidence rate, screening rate, cancer stage distribution, utility index, and treatment costs but the results were consistent with the base analysis.  Conclusions:   Under Korean circumstances with a relatively low incidence rate of prostate cancer, PSA screening is not cost-effective. Therefore, we conclude that adopting national prostate cancer screening would not be beneficial until further evidence is provided in the future.""","""['Sangjin Shin', 'Youn Hee Kim', 'Jin Sub Hwang', 'Yoon Jae Lee', 'Sang Moo Lee', 'Jeonghoon Ahn']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Cost-effectiveness analysis of PSA-based mass screening: Evidence from a randomised controlled trial combined with register data.', 'The Cost-Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Detection with the Use of Prostate Health Index.', 'The cost-effectiveness of prostate health index for prostate cancer detection in Chinese men.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'The socioeconomic implications of prostate-specific antigen screening.', 'Trends of stratified prostate cancer risk in a single Korean province from 2003 to 2021: A multicenter study conducted using regional training hospital data.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening Using Prostate-Specific Antigen Tests in a High-Risk Population in China: A Cost-Utility Analysis.', 'China county-based prostate specific antigen screening for prostate cancer and a cost-effective analysis.', 'Epidemiological and Economic Evaluation of a Pilot Prostate Cancer Screening Program.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of PSA-based mass screening: Evidence from a randomised controlled trial combined with register data.']"""

A search was performed in PubMed, Embase, the Chinese Journals Full-text Database (CNKI), and Wanfang databases up to August 2013. Odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were used to assess the association. Statistical analysis was calculated by STATA 11.0 software. The polymorphism was identified from 11 articles (12 case-control studies), involving 2,660 cases and 2,943 controls. Overall, no significant association between CD14-260C/T polymorphism and malignant tumor risk was found in the dominant model (TT + TC vs. CC: OR = 0.86, 95 % CI = 0.67-1.11). In the subgroup analysis by malignant tumor types, we found that the heterozygote model (TC vs. CC) might reduce the risk of malignant tumor, especially hematological malignance and prostate cancer (OR = 0.67, 95 % CI = 0.47-0.95), but not associated with gastrointestinal cancer susceptibility. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no significant associations were found among different ethnicities. The study suggested that CD14-260C/T polymorphism might be a protective factor for hematological malignance and prostate tumor susceptibility but not an independent risk factor for gastrointestinal cancer susceptibility.

Here, we report the generation and characterization of 91R, a mouse anti-human CCR9 IgG2b monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope within the CCR9 N-terminal domain. This antibody inhibits the growth of subcutaneous xenografts from human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells in immunodeficient Rag2(-/-) mice. Tumor size in 91R-treated mice was reduced by 85% compared with isotype-matched antibody-treated controls. Tumor reduction in 91R-treated mice was concomitant with an increase in the apoptotic cell fraction and tumor necrotic areas, as well as a decrease in the fraction of proliferating cells and in tumor vascularization. In the presence of complement or murine natural killer cells, 91R promoted in vitro lysis of MOLT-4 leukemia cells, indicating that this antibody might eliminate tumor cells via complement- and cell-dependent cytotoxicity.

The enhanced mutation detection rate in the combined sequencing dataset across intratumoural biopsies was demonstrated with respect to the total number of mutations identified in a given tumour. Allele frequencies of the mutations were positively correlated with the levels of intratumoural recurrence (private < shared < common), but some common mutations showed low allele frequency, suggesting that not all were clonally fixed. Regional biases in the presentation of a well-known TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was noted in one PCA and the somatic mutation- and copy number-based phylogenetic relationships between intratumoural biopsies were largely concordant.

Such genes might be used to create a panel of prognostic markers for aggressiveness and metastasis. Relative gene expression of 65 cancer-related genes was determined by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Expression of 29 genes was changed in LNCaP cells, 20 genes in DU145 and 16 genes in PC3 cell lines, compared with normal line PNT2. The obtained data make it possible to conclude that the epithelial-mesenchymal cell transition took place, which involved the loss of epithelial markers, reduced cell adhesion and increased migration.

Group II, a control group, had reported for therapy for persistent urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy but had not entered therapy for personal reasons. For estimating the level of incontinence, a 1-hour and 24-hour urinary pad tests, the miction diary, and incontinence questionnaire were used, and for recording the measurements of pelvic floor muscles tension, the sEMG (surface electromyography) was applied. The therapy duration depended on the level of incontinence and it continued for not longer than 12 months. Superior continence outcomes were obtained in Group I versus Group II and the difference was statistically significant.

AR activity can be maintained in these circumstances by increased AR synthesis--often reflecting increased NF-κB activation; upregulation of signaling pathways that promote AR activity in the absence of androgens; and by emergence of AR mutations or splice variants lacking the ligand-binding domain, which render the AR constitutively active. Drugs targeting the N-terminal transactivating domain of the AR, some of which are now in preclinical development, can be expected to inhibit the activity not only of unmutated ARs but also of the mutant forms and splice variants selected for by androgen deprivation. Concurrent measures that suppress AR synthesis or boost AR turnover could be expected to complement the efficacy of such drugs. A number of nutraceuticals that show efficacy in prostate cancer xenograft models--including polyphenols from pomegranate, grape seed, and green tea, the crucifera metabolite diindolylmethane, and the hormone melatonin--have the potential to suppress AR synthesis via downregulation of NF-κB activity; clinical doses of salicylate may have analogous efficacy. The proteasomal turnover of the AR is abetted by diets with a high ratio of long-chain omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids, which are beneficial in prostate cancer xenograft models; berberine and sulforaphane, by inhibiting AR's interaction with its chaperone Hsp90, likewise promote AR proteasomal degradation and retard growth of human prostate cancer in nude mice. Hinge region acetylation of the AR is required for optimal transactivational activity, and low micromolar concentrations of the catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can inhibit such acetylation--possibly explaining the ability of EGCG administration to suppress androgenic activity and cell proliferation in prostate cancer xenografts. Hence, it is proposed that regimens featuring an N-terminal domain-targeting drug, various nutraceuticals/drugs that downregulate NF-κB activity, and/or supplemental intakes of fish oil, berberine, sulforaphane, and EGCG have potential for blocking proliferation of prostate cancer by targeting its characteristic addiction to androgen receptor activity.""","""['Mark F McCarty', 'Jalal Hejazi', 'Reza Rastmanesh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['Pharmacological targeting of constitutively active truncated androgen receptor by nigericin and suppression of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell growth.', ""Down-regulation of androgen receptor by 3,3'-diindolylmethane contributes to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in both hormone-sensitive LNCaP and insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells."", '17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin induces the degradation of androgen receptor and HER-2/neu and inhibits the growth of prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Strategies for targeting the androgen receptor axis in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer.', 'The Biochemical Effects of Silver Nanoparticles and Spirulina Extract on Experimentally Induced Prostatic Cancer in Rats.', 'Habitual dietary intake of flavonoids and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: Golestan cohort study.', 'Bioactive natural products for chemoprevention and treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The role of dietary fat throughout the prostate cancer trajectory.', 'Disease pathways at the Rat Genome Database Pathway Portal: genes in context-a network approach to understanding the molecular mechanisms of disease.']"""

We investigated if childhood BMI, independently and adjusted for height, is positively associated with adult prostate cancer.  Methods:   Subjects were a cohort of 125208 boys formed from the Copenhagen School Health Records Register, born 1930-1969 with height and weight measurements at 7-13 years.

Body mass index during childhood was positively associated with adult prostate cancer. The hazard ratio of prostate cancer was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.10) per BMI z-score at age 7, and 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.10) per BMI z-score at age 13.

Methods:   Seven hundred and eighty-five general practitioner (GP) practices in England and Wales were randomised to a population-based PSA testing or standard care and then approached for consent to participate. In the intervention arm, men aged 50-69 years were invited to undergo PSA testing, and those diagnosed with localised prostate cancer were invited into a treatment trial. Control arm practices undertook standard UK management. All men were flagged with the Health and Social Care Information Centre for deaths and cancer registrations. The primary outcome is prostate cancer mortality at a median 10-year-follow-up.  Results:   Among randomised practices, 271 (68%) in the intervention arm (198,114 men) and 302 (78%) in the control arm (221,929 men) consented to participate, meeting pre-specified power requirements.

Methods and materials:   Immunohistochemistry was performed and scored by an expert genitourinary pathologist. Clinical endpoints evaluated were freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), castration resistance-free survival (CRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Log-rank test and Cox regression were used to determine significance of biomarker levels with clinical outcome.  Results:   Fifty-four patients with high-risk prostate cancer (stage ≥ T3a, or Gleason score ≥ 8, or prostate-specific antigen level ≥ 20 ng/mL) treated with radiation therapy from 2005 to 2012 at our institution were evaluated. Nearly all patients expressed EZH2 (98%), whereas 28% of patients revealed DAB2IP reduction and 72% retained DAB2IP. Median follow-up was 34.0 months for DAB2IP-reduced patients, 29.9 months for DAB2IP-retained patients, and 32.6 months in the EZH2 study. Reduction in DAB2IP portended worse outcome compared with DAB2IP-retained patients, including FFBF (4-year: 37% vs 89%, P=.04), CRFS (4-year: 50% vs 90%, P=.02), and DMFS (4-year: 36% vs 97%, P=.05). Stratified EZH2 expression trended toward significance for worse FFBF and CRFS (P=.07). Patients with reduced DAB2IP or highest-intensity EZH2 expression exhibited worse FFBF (4-year: 32% vs 95%, P=.02), CRFS (4-year: 28% vs 100%, P<.01), and DMFS (4-year: 39% vs 100%, P=.04) compared with the control group.  Conclusion:   Loss of DAB2IP is a potent biomarker that portends worse outcome despite definitive radiation therapy for patients with high-risk prostate cancer. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 is expressed in most high-risk tumors and is a less potent discriminator of outcome in this study.

Zinc is present in healthy prostate at a very high concentration, where it is required for important prostatic functions. However, zinc levels are significantly diminished in cancerous tissue, and intracellular zinc level is inversely correlated with prostate cancer progression. During neoplastic transformation, zinc-accumulating, citrate-producing normal prostate cells are metabolically transformed to citrate oxidizing cells that lose the ability to accumulate zinc. Interestingly, zinc has been shown to function as chemopreventive agent against prostate cancer, albeit at high doses, which may lead to many adverse effects. Therefore, novel means to enhance bioaccumulation of sufficient zinc in prostate cells via increasing zinc transport could be useful against prostate cancer. On the basis of available evidence, we present a possibility that the grape antioxidant resveratrol, when given with zinc, may lead to retuning the zinc homeostasis in prostate, thereby abolishing or reversing malignancy.

Loss of the PTEN and TP53 tumor suppressor genes is commonly observed in prostate cancer, whereas their compound loss is often observed in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we show that PARP inhibition triggers a p53-dependent cellular senescence in a PTEN-deficient setting in the prostate. Surprisingly, we also find that PARP-induced cellular senescence is morphed into an apoptotic response upon compound loss of PTEN and p53. We further show that superactivation of the prosurvival PI3K-AKT signaling pathway limits the efficacy of a PARP single-agent treatment, and that PARP and PI3K inhibitors effectively synergize to suppress tumorigenesis in human prostate cancer cell lines and in a Pten/Trp53-deficient mouse model of advanced prostate cancer. Our findings, therefore, identify a combinatorial treatment with PARP and PI3K inhibitors as an effective option for PTEN-deficient prostate cancer.  Significance:   The paucity of therapeutic options in advanced prostate cancer displays an urgent need for the preclinical assessment of novel therapeutic strategies.

Evolving an initial contour to converge to anatomical boundaries of an organ or tumor is a very appealing method, especially when it is based on a well-defined mathematical foundation. However, one drawback of such evolving method is its high computation time. It is desirable to design and implement algorithms that are not only accurate and robust but also fast in execution. Bresson et al. have proposed a variational model using both boundary and region information as well as shape priors. The latter can be a significant factor in medical image analysis. In this work, we combine the variational model of level set with a multi-resolution approach to accelerate the processing. The question is whether a multi-resolution context can make the segmentation faster without affecting the accuracy. As well, we investigate the question whether a premature convergence, which happens in a much shorter time, would reduce accuracy. We examine multiple semiautomated configurations to segment the prostate gland in T2W MR images.

Materials & methods:   Seventeen prostate cancer patients underwent T2w imaging at 7T with only an external transmit/receive array coil. Three radiologists independently scored images for image quality, visibility of anatomical structures, and presence of artefacts. Krippendorff's alpha and weighted kappa statistics were used to assess inter-observer agreement. Visibility of prostate cancer lesions was assessed by directly linking the T2w images to the confirmed location of prostate cancer on histopathology.  Results:   T2w imaging at 7T was achievable with 'satisfactory' (3/5) to 'good' (4/5) quality. Visibility of anatomical structures was predominantly scored as 'satisfactory' (3/5) and 'good' (4/5). If artefacts were present, they were mostly motion artefacts and, to a lesser extent, aliasing artefacts and noise. Krippendorff's analysis revealed an α = 0.44 between three readers for the overall image quality scores. Clinically significant cancer lesions in both peripheral zone and transition zone were visible at 7T.  Conclusion:   T2w imaging with satisfactory to good quality can be routinely acquired, and cancer lesions were visible in patients with prostate cancer at 7T using only an external transmit/receive body array coil.

Hormone levels and body mass index/waist circumference were correlated with patient- and tumor-specific characteristics using multivariable logistic regression analysis.  Results:   Even though we confirmed an inverse correlation between bodyweight and testosterone levels, only overweight - but not low testosterone - was associated with advanced disease and poor differentiation of prostate cancer.

Despite the association between MAOA and aggressive PCa, it is unclear how MAOA promotes PCa progression. Here, we found that MAOA functions to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stabilize the transcription factor HIF1α, which mediates hypoxia through an elevation of ROS, thus enhancing growth, invasiveness, and metastasis of PCa cells. Knockdown and overexpression of MAOA in human PCa cell lines indicated that MAOA induces EMT through activation of VEGF and its coreceptor neuropilin-1. MAOA-dependent activation of neuropilin-1 promoted AKT/FOXO1/TWIST1 signaling, allowing FOXO1 binding at the TWIST1 promoter. Importantly, the MAOA-dependent HIF1α/VEGF-A/FOXO1/TWIST1 pathway was activated in high-grade PCa specimens, and knockdown of MAOA reduced or even eliminated prostate tumor growth and metastasis in PCa xenograft mouse models. Pharmacological inhibition of MAOA activity also reduced PCa xenograft growth in mice. Moreover, high MAOA expression in PCa tissues correlated with worse clinical outcomes in PCa patients.

Prostate cancer is the most frequent type of cancer type in men and causes increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and osteoporosis. Epidemiological evidence points to a positive effect of regular physical activity on all-cause and prostate cancer mortality and current clinical evidence supports the use of exercise in cancer rehabilitation. However, the external validity of existing exercise studies is limited and the majority of prostate cancer survivors remain sedentary. Hence, novel approaches to evaluate and promote physical activity are warranted. This paper presents the rationale behind the delivery and evaluation of community-based recreational football offered in existing football clubs under the Danish Football Association to promote quality of life and physical activity adherence in prostate cancer survivors. The RE-AIM framework will be applied to evaluate the impact of the intervention including outcomes both at the individual and organizational level.

In the androgen-resistant prostate cancer cells, ANXA7 and p53 showed similar cytotoxicity levels. However, in the androgen-sensitive LNCaP, ANXA7 greatly exceeded the p53-induced cytotoxicity. We hypothesized that the p53 underperformance in LNCaP could be due to the involvement of p53-responsive SGK1 and FOXO3A. In this study, we show that p53 failed to match programmed cell death (PCD) and G1-arrest that were induced by ANXA7 in LNCaP. WT-ANXA7 preserved total FOXO3A expression with no hyperphosphorylation that could enable FOXO3A nuclear translocation and proapoptotic transcription. In contrast, in the p53-transfected LNCaP cells with maintained cell proliferation, the phosphorylated (but not total) FOXO3A fraction was increased implying a predominantly cytoplasmic localization and, subsequently, a lack of FOXO3A proapoptotic transcription. In addition, p53 reduced the expression of aberrant SGK1 protein form in LNCaP. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and p53-signature genes, we elucidated the role of distinct SGK1/FOXO3A-associated regulation in p53 versus ANXA7 responses and proposed that aberrant SGK1 could affect reciprocal SGK1-FOXO3A-Akt regulation.

However, its hydrophobic nature limits its bioavailability compromising in vivo biological activities. Nanoparticles-based delivery of such molecules has emerged as new technique to resolve these issues. Bio-degradable, compatible and adhesive nature of chitosan has recently attracted its suitability as a carrier for biologically active molecules. This study presents fabrication and characterization of chitosan-tripolyphosphate based encapsulation of silibinin. Various preparations of silibinin encapsulated chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles were studied for particle size, morphology, zeta-potential, and encapsulation efficiencies. Preparations were also evaluated for cytotoxic activities in vitro. The optimized silibinin loaded chitosan nanoparticles were of 263.7±4.1nm in particle size with zeta potential 37.4±1.57mV. Nanoparticles showed high silibinin encapsulation efficiencies (82.94±1.82%). No chemical interactions between silibinin and chitosan were observed in FTIR analysis. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis revealed transformed physical state of silibinin after encapsulation. Surface morphology and thermal behaviour were determined using TEM and DSC analysis. Encapsulated silibinin displayed increased dissolution and better cytotoxicity against human prostate cancer cells (DU145) than silibinin alone.""","""['Deep Pooja', 'Dileep J Babu Bikkina', 'Hitesh Kulhari', 'Nalla Nikhila', 'Srinivas Chinde', 'Y M Raghavendra', 'B Sreedhar', 'Ashok K Tiwari']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Biol Macromol""","""['Enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis-induced anticancer effect of silibinin-loaded nanoparticles in oral carcinoma (KB) cells.', 'Preparation, Characterization and Cytotoxicity of Silibinin- Containing Nanoniosomes in T47D Human Breast Carcinoma Cells.', 'A supersaturating delivery system of silibinin exhibiting high payload achieved by amorphous nano-complexation with chitosan.', 'Nano-Chitosan Particles in Anticancer Drug Delivery: An Up-to-Date Review.', 'Self-assembled glycol chitosan nanoparticles for disease-specific theranostics.', 'Discrimination of β-cyclodextrin/hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) oil/flavonoid glycoside and flavonolignan ternary complexes by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy coupled with principal component analysis.', 'Solvent Free Twin Screw Processed Silybin Nanophytophospholipid: In Silico, In Vitro and In Vivo Insights.', 'Enhanced bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a novel hybrid-hydrogel formulation of fisetin orally administered in healthy individuals: a randomised double-blinded comparative crossover study.', 'Green Synthesis of Silymarin-Chitosan Nanoparticles as a New Nano Formulation with Enhanced Anti-Fibrotic Effects against Liver Fibrosis.', 'Hybrid chitosan-lipid nanoparticles of green tea extract as natural anti-cellulite agent with superior in vivo potency: full synthesis and analysis.']"""

Materials and methods:   This prospective study involved 25 patients with prostate carcinoma undergoing MRI and CTpI. All analyses were performed on T2-weighted images (T2WI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and CTp images. We compared the performance of T2WI combined with DWI and CTp alone. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.  Results:   Tumours were present in 87 areas according to the histopathological results. The diagnostic performance of the T2WI+DWI+CTpI combination was significantly better than that of T2WI alone for prostate carcinoma (P < 0.001). The diagnostic value of CTpI was similar to that of T2WI+DWI in combination. There were statistically significant differences in the blood flow and permeability surface values between prostate carcinoma and background prostate on CTp images.  Conclusion:   CTp may be a valuable tool for detecting prostate carcinoma and may be preferred in cases where MRI is contraindicated. If this technique is combined with T2WI and DWI, its diagnostic value is enhanced.  Key points:   Perfusion CT is a helpful technique for prostate carcinoma diagnosis. •Colour maps allow easy and rapid visual assessment of the functional changes.

In the current study, the authors assessed whether racial disparities in cancer-specific mortality have improved over the last 20 years.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was used to identify 2,713,474 patients diagnosed between 1988 and 2007 with either lung, breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer (the leading 3 causes of cancer-related mortality among each sex). After exclusions, 1,001,978 patients remained eligible for analysis. The impact of race on cancer-specific mortality was assessed using the regression model of Fine and Gray; an interaction model evaluated trends over time.  Results:   African Americans presented with a more advanced stage of disease (P < .001) and underwent definitive therapy less often (P < .001) than whites. After adjustment for demographics and year of diagnosis, African Americans were found to have higher estimates of cancer-specific mortality than whites for all cancers combined (hazards ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.30 [P < .001]) and within each individual cancer (each P < .05). These differences did not change significantly between 1988 through 1997 and 1998 through 2007, except among patients with breast cancer, in whom survival disparities increased. These findings remained significant after adjustment for stage of disease at presentation and receipt of definitive therapy (hazards ratio for breast cancer mortality in African Americans vs whites: 1.37 from 1988-1997 and 1.53 from 1998-2007; P for interaction, < .001).  Conclusions:   The survival gap for African Americans has not closed over time. Race-based differences in outcome persist independent of stage of disease and treatment, suggesting that additional strategies beyond screening and improving access to care, such as further research into tumor biologies disproportionately affecting African Americans, are needed to improve survival for African American patients with cancer.""","""['Ayal A Aizer', 'Tyler J Wilhite', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Powell L Graham', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Neil E Martin', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Jim C Hu', 'Paul L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Cancer Survival: The Contribution of Tumor, Sociodemographic, Institutional, and Neighborhood Characteristics.', 'Racial disparities in cancer survival among randomized clinical trials patients of the Southwest Oncology Group.', 'Differences in Stage of Cancer at Diagnosis, Treatment, and Survival by Race and Ethnicity Among Leading Cancer Types.', 'Colorectal cancer and race: understanding the differences in outcomes between African Americans and whites.', 'The influence of socioeconomic disparities on breast cancer tumor biology and prognosis: a review.', 'Strategic Messaging to Promote Policies that Advance Racial Equity: What Do We Know, and What Do We Need to Learn?', 'Using Pointwise Mutual Information for Breast Cancer Health Disparities Research With SEER-Medicare Claims.', 'Cancer mortality rates by racial and ethnic groups in the United States, 2018-2020.', 'Surgical Treatment at an Academic Medical Center is Associated with Statistically Insignificant Lung Cancer Survival Outcome Differences Related to ZIP Code.', 'The EMory BrEast imaging Dataset (EMBED): A Racially Diverse, Granular Dataset of 3.4 Million Screening and Diagnostic Mammographic Images.']"""

Patients and methods:   From September 2010 through November 2012, we treated 84 Japanese men with clinically localized prostate cancer with RARP. The excised specimens, which were divided into right and left fragments, were evaluated for the presence of positive surgical margins (PSMs) and preoperative MRI findings.  Results:   The overall PSM rate was 21.4% (18 of 84 patients), 83.3% (15 of 18 cases) of which were situated in the apex. Evaluating the prostate divided into right and left fragments, the PSM rate was 10.7% at the apex (18 of 168 fragments). Cancer was suspected via preoperative MRI in 39 fragments (23.2%) and detected in the prostatic apex by prostate biopsy in 67 fragments (39.9%). Multiple regression analysis revealed that MRI and nerve-sparing procedures significantly indicate apical margin positivity (p = 0.005).

Oral pH buffers can specifically neutralize the acidic pH of tumors and reduce the incidence of local invasion and metastatic formation in multiple murine models. However, this effect is not universal as we have previously observed that metastasis is not inhibited by buffers in some tumor models, regardless of buffer used. B16-F10 (murine melanoma), LL/2 (murine lung) and HCT116 (human colon) tumors are resistant to treatment with lysine buffer therapy, whereas metastasis is potently inhibited by lysine buffers in MDA-MB-231 (human breast) and PC3M (human prostate) tumors. In the current work, we confirmed that sensitive cells utilized a pH-dependent mechanism for successful metastasis supported by a highly glycolytic phenotype that acidifies the local tumor microenvironment resulting in morphological changes. In contrast, buffer-resistant cell lines exhibited a pH-independent metastatic mechanism involving constitutive secretion of matrix degrading proteases without elevated glycolysis. These results have identified two distinct mechanisms of experimental metastasis, one of which is pH-dependent (buffer therapy sensitive cells) and one which is pH-independent (buffer therapy resistant cells).

Methods:   Data from 6664 Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial placebo arm biopsies (5826 individuals), where prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal examination results were available within 1 year before the biopsy and PSA was ≤10 ng/mL, were used to develop a nominal logistic regression model to predict the risk of no vs low-grade (Gleason grade<7) vs high-grade cancer (Gleason grade≥7).

Also, the possible influence of socioeconomic factors on ED drug use has not been studied previously.  Aim:   The aim of this study was to examine determinants and patterns of ED drug use before and after diagnosis in men with localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using a nationwide population-based cohort, 25,390 men with localized prostate cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2009 and 126,944 control men were identified and followed for filled ED drug prescriptions over a 3-year period, ranging from 1 year before and up to 2 years after diagnosis.  Main outcome measures:   The main outcome measure was the proportion of men with at least one filled ED drug prescription after diagnosis.  Results:   The number of men using ED drugs increased markedly following diagnosis. Men who underwent radical prostatectomy had the strongest increase, with a cumulative proportion of 74% for at least one filled prescription within the first 2 years after diagnosis. The corresponding proportion was 33% in men treated with radiotherapy, 21% in men on active surveillance, 10% in men on watchful waiting, and 8% in control men. Among men who underwent prostatectomy, usage attenuated over time.

The association between self-reported diabetes mellitus at recruitment and risk of prostate cancer was examined in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Among 139,131 eligible men, 4,531 were diagnosed with prostate cancer over an average follow-up of 12 years. Multivariable hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by EPIC-participating center and age at recruitment, and adjusted for education, smoking status, body mass index, waist circumference, and physical activity. In a subset of men without prostate cancer, the cross-sectional association between circulating concentrations of androgens and insulin-like growth factor proteins with diabetes status was also investigated using linear regression models. Compared to men with no diabetes, men with diabetes had a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63-0.86). There was no evidence that the association differed by stage (p-heterogeneity, 0.19) or grade (p-heterogeneity, 0.48) of the disease, although the numbers were small in some disease subgroups. In a subset of 626 men with hormone measurements, circulating concentrations of androstenedione, total testosterone and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-three were lower in men with diabetes compared to men without diabetes.

Such an altered gene expression profile promotes lipid biogenesis and may result in the accumulation of neutral lipids, which become visible as cytoplasmic lipid droplets.

Methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program to identify 62,644 men with high-risk CaP (PSA >20 or Gleason 8-10 or stage ≥cT3a) diagnosed from 2004 to 2010. Multivariable logistic regression analysis modeled the interaction between age and race and its association with receipt of definitive therapy on 57,674 patients (47,879 white men; 9,795 African American [AA] men) with complete data on the covariates of interest.  Results:   Among men age ≥70, AA men had a higher risk of CaP-specific mortality (PCSM) compared to white men after adjusting for sociodemographic and prostate cancer-specific factors (Adjusted HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.02-1.38; P=0.02). Nevertheless, a significant interaction between race and age was found (Pinteraction=0.01), such that the adjusted odds of receiving definitive treatment for AA vs. white was 0.67 (95% CI 0.62-0.73; P<0.001) among men age <70, but was 0.60 (95% CI 0.55-0.66; P<0.001) among men age ≥70, suggesting increased racial disparity in the receipt of definitive treatment among older men.  Conclusion:   AA men with high-risk CaP are less likely to receive definitive therapy than white men. This disparity is significantly larger among men age ≥70, despite excess PCSM among AA men in this group.

This study evaluated whether African American (AA) men who present with low-risk disease are at higher risk for death from CaP than white men.  Patients and methods:   The authors identified 56,045 men with low-risk CaP (T1-T2a, Gleason score ≤ 6, prostate-specific antigen ≤ 10 ng/mL) diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.

When analyzing only patients who underwent curative treatment, AA race (AHR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.04-2.53; P = .034) remained significantly associated with increased PCSM.  Conclusion:   Among men with low-risk prostate cancer, AA race compared with white race was associated with a higher risk of PCSM, raising the possibility that clinicians may need to exercise caution when recommending active surveillance for AA men with low-risk disease.

Forty patients were planned but only 24 patients were enrolled owing to slow accrual. Twenty-one patients were evaluable for pathological outcomes and 22 for serum metabolic indices. Metformin was given at doses to 500 mg t.i.d. Ki67 index was calculated using the Aperio-positive pixel count algorithm, whereas immunohistochemical measurements were by consensus H-Score. Comparative statistics were analysed by students t-tests and/or Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test.  Results:   Baseline characteristics included median PSA 6 ng ml(-1) (3.22-36.11 ng ml(-1)). Median duration of drug treatment was 41 days (18-81). Treatment was well tolerated with only three patients developing G3/4 toxicities. In a per patient and per tumour analyses, metformin reduced the Ki67 index by relative amounts of 29.5 and 28.6 % (P=0.0064 and P=0.0042) respectively. There was also a significant decrease in P-4EBP1 staining (P<0.001) but no change in P-AMPK or P-ACC. There were no correlations between any metabolic, morphometric or cancer-related serum indices.

Methods:   The polyglyconate UBS V-Loc 180 was used for VUA during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in 30 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with organ-confined prostate cancer between January and October 2012. The operative and postoperative parameters were then compared with those of 30 consecutive patients who had previously undergone the same procedure but with the monofilament poliglecaprone suture Monocryl. All procedures were performed by the same experienced surgeon.  Results:   VUA time was significantly shorter in the V-Loc group (13.2 ± 2.3 min) than in the Monocryl group (19.1 ± 3.3 min) (P < 0.001). The V-Loc group required significantly more stitches than the Monocryl group (11.4 ± 1.3 vs 10.6 ± 1.6 stitches; P = 0.031). The percentage of patients who required no more than one pad per day at 3 months postoperatively was significantly higher in the V-Loc group (63.3%) than in the Monocryl group (23.3%) (P = 0.020). No significant differences in other perioperative parameters were observed between the two groups.  Conclusion:   Using UBS prevents suture slippage and enables tieless anastomosis. VUA using a UBS may relieve surgeon stress because a rapid and secure anastomosis is achievable.""","""['Toshikazu Takeda', 'Akira Miyajima', 'Gou Kaneko', 'Masanori Hasegawa', 'Eiji Kikuchi', 'Mototsugu Oya']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Asian J Endosc Surg""","""['Prospective randomized trial of barbed polyglyconate suture to facilitate vesico-urethral anastomosis during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: time reduction and cost benefit.', 'Comparison of the urethrovesical anastomoses with polyglecaprone (Monocryl®) and bidirectional barbed (V-Loc 180®) running sutures in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of newer unidirectional and bidirectional barbed suture on vesicourethral anastomosis during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and its comparison with polyglecaprone-25 suture: an initial experience.', 'The Use of Unidirectional Barbed Suture for Urethrovesical Anastomosis during Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Efficacy and Safety.', 'Assessing the Impact of Barbed Suture on Vesicourethral Anastomosis During Minimally Invasive Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Description of the technique for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in canine cadavers: 2D vs. 3D camera.', 'Continuous poliglecaprone suture versus bidirectional barded suture for urethrovesical anastomosis during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single-institute retrospective analysis of Chinese patients.', 'Laparoscopic subtotal cholecystectomy for difficult cases of acute cholecystitis: a simple technique using barbed sutures.', 'Thoracoscopic partial resection without using a stapler.

Though transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) is the standard in most parts of the world in evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), it is rarely done in some less developed countries because of non availability of appropriate probes and or specialists. Transabdominal ultrasonography (TAUS) remains the mainstay in these areas. Some controversies still exist in literature about the accuracy of TAUS evaluation of prostatic volume in patients with BPH. This study aimed at comparing the transition zone volume estimation of the prostate on transrectal and transabdominal ultrasound with post-operative enucleated adenoma volume in Nigeria patients with BPH and to suggest better predictor of prostate volume in evaluation of BPH.  Methods:   Forty-six (46) patients with lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH attending the urologic clinic were evaluated ultrasonographically and eventually managed with open surgery (prostatectomy) after due counselling. The post operative samples were weighted using a sensitive top loading weighing balance and converted to volume. Since the specific gravity of the prostate is equivalent to that of water,the weight is the same as volume.  Results:   Patients' ages ranged between 59 and 90 years with a peak age incidence at seventh decade. Transition Zone (TZ) volume estimation on both transrectal and transabdominal ultrasound showed positive correlation with the post operative enucleated adenoma(r = 0.594, p < 0.001) but the transrectal method was more accurate. There was no significant relationship between the TZ volume and patients' symptoms(r = 0.491, p = 0.007).  Conclusion:   Both TRUS and TAUS are comparable at TZ volume estimation and therefore TAUS can be utilized in regions where intracavitary probes and or the expertise is/are not available.""","""['Idowu Ajayi', 'Ademola Aremu', 'Abimbola Olajide', 'Tope Bello', 'Folake Olajide', 'Victor Adetiloye']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Pan Afr Med J""","""['TRUS versus transabdominal ultrasound as a predictor of enucleated adenoma weight in patients with BPH: a tool for standard preoperative work-up?', 'Determination of transition zone volume by transrectal ultrasound in patients with clinically benign prostatic hyperplasia: agreement with enucleated prostate adenoma weight.', 'The importance of measuring the prostatic transition zone: an anatomical and radiological study.', 'Management of a giant prostatic enlargement: Case report and review of the literature.', 'The association of benign prostatic hyperplasia and cancer of the prostate.', 'Correlation between Transabdominal Sonographic Prostate Volume and Anthropometric Parameters.', 'Reliability and validity of assessment methods available in primary care for bladder outlet obstruction and benign prostatic obstruction in men with lower urinary tract symptoms: a systematic review.', 'The Value of Mobile Ultrasound Services in Rural Communities in South-South Nigeria.']"""

Since then, CCO has built a model for province-wide quality improvement and oversight--the Performance Improvement Cycle--that exemplifies the key elements of the Excellent Care for All Act, 2010. While ensuring that quality of the cancer system is by necessity a continuous process, the approach taken thus far has achieved measurable results and will continue to form the basis of CCO's future work. Clinician engagement has been critical to the success of CCO's approach to quality oversight and improvement. CCO uses a variety of formal and informal clinical engagement structures at each step of the Performance Improvement Cycle, and has developed operational processes to support quality improvement, and educational and mentorship programs to build clinician leadership capacity in that area. An example of sustained quality improvement in system performance is illustrated in a case study of the surgical treatment of prostate cancer. The improvement was achieved with strong collaboration across CCO's surgery and pathology clinical programs, with support from informatics staff.""","""['Carol Sawka', 'Jillian Ross', 'John Srigley', 'Jonathan Irish']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Healthc Q""","""[""Creating a system for performance improvement in cancer care: Cancer Care Ontario's clinical governance framework."", 'Improving the quality of lung cancer care in Ontario: the lung cancer disease pathway initiative.', 'The opportunity and strategy for quality and health-system improvement now and in the future.', 'Medical leadership and engagement: no longer an optional extra.', 'Shifting clinical accountability and the pursuit of quality: aligning clinical and administrative approaches.', 'Community mental health funding, stakeholder engagement and outcomes: a realist synthesis.', ""Clinicians' experience of providing care: a rapid review."", 'How do stakeholders from multiple hierarchical levels of a large provincial health system define engagement?
