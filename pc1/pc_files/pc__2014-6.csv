In this study, an automatic framework is designed for prostate segmentation in CT images. We propose a novel image feature extraction method, namely, variant scale patch, which can provide rich image information in a low dimensional feature space. We assume that the samples from different classes lie on different nonlinear submanifolds and design a new segmentation criterion called local independent projection (LIP). In our method, a dictionary containing training samples is constructed. To utilize the latest image information, we use an online updated strategy to construct this dictionary. In the proposed LIP, locality is emphasized rather than sparsity; local anchor embedding is performed to determine the dictionary coefficients. Several morphological operations are performed to improve the achieved results. The proposed method has been evaluated based on 330 3-D images of 24 patients. Results show that the proposed method is robust and effective in segmenting prostate in CT images.""","""['Yao Wu', 'Guoqing Liu', 'Meiyan Huang', 'Jiacheng Guo', 'Jun Jiang', 'Wei Yang', 'Wufan Chen', 'Qianjin Feng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['A feature-based learning framework for accurate prostate localization in CT images.', 'Interactive prostate segmentation using atlas-guided semi-supervised learning and adaptive feature selection.', 'A semiautomatic segmentation method for prostate in CT images using local texture classification and statistical shape modeling.', 'Semi-automatic segmentation of prostate in CT images via coupled feature representation and spatial-constrained transductive lasso.', 'Segmenting the prostate and rectum in CT imagery using anatomical constraints.', 'Editorial: Innovative applications with artificial intelligence methods in neuroimaging data analysis.', 'Boundary Coding Representation for Organ Segmentation in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Multi-atlas label fusion with random local binary pattern features: Application to hippocampus segmentation.', 'Automatic segmentation of the prostate on CT images using deep learning and multi-atlas fusion.', 'Learning Based Segmentation of CT Brain Images: Application to Postoperative Hydrocephalic Scans.']"""

In prostate cancer, serum miRNA signatures have been associated with the presence of disease as well as correlated with previously validated risk models. However, it is unclear whether miRNAs can provide independent prognostic information beyond current risk models. Here, we focus on a group of low-risk prostate cancer patients who were eligible for active surveillance, but chose surgery. A major criteria for the low risk category is a Gleason score of 6 or lower based on pre-surgical biopsy. However, a third of these patients are upgraded to Gleason 7 on post surgical pathological analysis. Both in a discovery and a validation cohort, we find that pre-surgical serum levels of miR-19, miR-345 and miR-519c-5p can help identify these patients independent of their pre-surgical age, PSA, stage, and percent biopsy involvement. A combination of the three miRNAs increased the area under a receiver operator characteristics curve from 0.77 to 0.94 (p<0.01). Also, when combined with the CAPRA risk model the miRNA signature significantly enhanced prediction of patients with Gleason 7 disease. In-situ hybridizations of matching tumors showed miR-19 upregulation in transformed versus normal-appearing tumor epithelial, but independent of tumor grade suggesting an alternative source for the increase in serum miR-19a/b levels or the release of pre-existing intracellular miR-19a/b upon progression. Together, these data show that serum miRNAs can predict relatively small steps in tumor progression improving the capacity to predict disease risk and, therefore, potentially drive clinical decisions in prostate cancer patients. It will be important to validate these findings in a larger multi-institutional study as well as with independent methodologies.""","""['Siao-Yi Wang', 'Stephen Shiboski', 'Cassandra D Belair', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Jeffrey P Simko', 'Hubert Stoppler', 'Janet Cowan', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Robert Blelloch']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The association of let-7c, miR-21, miR-145, miR-182, and miR-221 with clinicopathologic parameters of prostate cancer in patients diagnosed with low-risk disease.', 'Functional roles and potential clinical application of miRNA-345-5p in prostate cancer.', 'Different levels of serum microRNAs in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia: evaluation of potential diagnostic and prognostic role.', 'Elevated serum microRNA levels associate with absence of high-grade prostate cancer in a retrospective cohort.', 'Assessment of Serum microRNA Biomarkers to Predict Reclassification of Prostate Cancer in Patients on Active Surveillance.', 'MicroRNAs as Potential Liquid Biopsy Biomarker for Patients with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Salivary miR-31-5p, miR-345-3p, and miR-424-3p Are Reliable Biomarkers in Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Prediction of Grade Reclassification of Prostate Cancer Patients on Active Surveillance through the Combination of a Three-miRNA Signature and Selected Clinical Variables.', 'The effectiveness of plasma miR-33a-5p as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of colorectal cancer chemotherapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study was approved by an independent ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients with no enlarged lymph nodes on preoperative cross-sectional images who were scheduled for radical resection of the primary tumor and extended pelvic lymph node dissection were enrolled. All patients were examined with a 3-T MR unit, and examinations included conventional and DW MR imaging of the entire pelvis. Image analysis was performed by three independent readers blinded to any clinical information. Metastases were diagnosed on the basis of high signal intensity on high b value DW MR images and morphologic features (shape, border). Histopathologic examination served as the standard of reference. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated, and bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained with the bootstrap method. The Fleiss and Cohen κ and median test were applied for statistical analyses.  Results:   A total of 4846 lymph nodes were resected in 120 patients. Eighty-eight lymph node metastases were found in 33 of 120 patients (27.5%). Short-axis diameter of these metastases was less than or equal to 3 mm in 68, more than 3 mm to 5 mm in 13, more than 5 mm to 8 mm in five; and more than 8 mm in two. On a per-patient level, the three readers correctly detected metastases in 26 (79%; 95% CI: 64%, 91%), 21 (64%; 95% CI: 45%, 79%), and 25 (76%; 95% CI: 60%, 90%) of the 33 patients with metastases, with respective specificities of 85% (95% CI: 78%, 92%), 79% (95% CI: 70%, 88%), and 84% (95% CI: 76%, 92%). Analyzed according to hemipelvis, lymph node metastases were detected with histopathologic examination in 44 of 240 pelvic sides (18%); the three readers correctly detected these on DW MR images in 26 (59%; 95% CI: 45%, 73%), 19 (43%; 95% CI: 27%, 57%), and 28 (64%; 95% CI: 47%, 78%) of the 44 cases.

New surgical devices, such as dissectors and hemostatic scalpels, allow precise definition of the surgical field with finer dissection of the anatomic structures, with subsequent reductions in operative times and better oncologic and functional outcomes. Although monopolar scissors (MS) are still widely used, radiofrequency (RF) and ultrasound (US) scalpels have been introduced recently in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP). Despite the widespread use of these scalpels, however, few studies have compared these devices in terms of oncologic and functional outcomes after radical prostatectomy. The present study aimed to prospectively assess the impact of MS, RF, and US scalpels on margin status at apex, and recovery of urinary continence and erectile function in patients undergoing extraperitoneal LRP.  Patients and methods:   A total of 150 men were prospectively enrolled between September 2009 and April 2013 and postoperatively evaluated for continence and clinical factors.  Results:   There were no differences in terms of operative times (P=0.9433), blood loss (P=0.9681), apical margin positivity (P=0.3965) or postoperative hospital stay (P=0.9257) among the groups. Moreover, no differences in the functional outcome scores, as evaluated by the International Consultation on Incontinence self-administered Questionnaire, at 1, 3, and 6 months postsurgery were observed.  Conclusion:   Our study represents the first evaluation of continence recovery in LRP with respect to different devices used for prostatic apex dissection. We found that the oncologic, functional, and operative outcomes were similar between these different devices during LRP, with no scalpel demonstrating superiority in continence recovery.""","""['Antonio L Pastore', 'Giovanni Palleschi', 'Aurel Messas', 'Andrea Fuschi', 'Alessandro Zucchi', 'Elizabetta Costantini', 'Luigi Silvestri', 'Vincenzo Petrozza', 'Antonio Carbone']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Prospective randomized study of radiofrequency versus ultrasound scalpels on functional outcomes of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Modified apical dissection of the prostate improves early continence in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: technique and initial results.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: transition from pure laparoscopic to robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Ref.: Magistro G, Tuog-Linh D, Westhofen T, et al.

Herein, we have engineered a novel multifunctional surface, on the basis of the biomimetic cell capture, through optimized incorporation of multiple antibodies directed to cancer cell-specific surface markers, such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), and prostate specific antigen (PSA). The surfaces were tested using a series of tumor cells, MDA-PCa-2b, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-361, both in mixture in vitro and after being spiked into human blood. Our multifunctional surface demonstrated highly efficient capture of tumor cells in human blood, achieving up to 82% capture efficiency (∼10-fold enhancement than a surface with the antibodies alone) and up to 90% purity. Furthermore, the multipatterned antibodies allowed differential capturing of the tumor cells. These results support that our multifunctional surface has great potential as an effective platform that accommodates virtually any antibodies, which will likely lead to clinically significant, differential detection of CTCs that are rare and highly heterogeneous.""","""['Ja Hye Myung', 'Khyati A Gajjar', 'Jihua Chen', 'Robert E Molokie', 'Seungpyo Hong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Surface engineering for efficient capture of circulating tumor cells in renal cell carcinoma: From nanoscale analysis to clinical application.', 'Enhanced tumor cell isolation by a biomimetic combination of E-selectin and anti-EpCAM: implications for the effective separation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs).', 'Dendrimer-Based Platform for Effective Capture of Tumor Cells after TGFβ1-Induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Integration of biomimicry and nanotechnology for significantly improved detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs).', 'Clinical and biological significance of circulating tumor cells in cancer.', 'Design of Polymeric Surfaces as Platforms for Streamlined Cancer Diagnostics in Liquid Biopsies.', 'Nanotechnology and machine learning enable circulating tumor cells as a reliable biomarker for radiotherapy responses of gastrointestinal cancer patients.', 'Branched, dendritic, and hyperbranched polymers in liquid biopsy device design.', 'Advanced Electron Microscopy of Nanophased Synthetic Polymers and Soft Complexes for Energy and Medicine Applications.', 'Fluorescence Liquid Biopsy for Cancer Detection Is Improved by Using Cationic Dendronized Hyperbranched Polymer.']"""

The proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle distinction, and migration capacity of prostate cells were determined following transfection of miR-221 or miR-222 inhibitor. The biological impact and regulation of SIRT1 on prostate cancer cells were investigated. MiR-221 and miR-222 were highly expressed in PC-3 cells compared with in LNCap cells. After miR-221 or miR-222 expression was inhibited, the proliferation and migration rates of PC-3 cells decreased and the apoptosis rate increased. Moreover, SIRT1 protein was up-regulated in cells after they were transfected with miR-221 or miR-222 inhibitor. Cells transfected with siSIRT1 showed increased migration and a decreased apoptosis rate, but there was no significant effect on cell proliferation compared with the controls. There was a negative correlation between miR-221 or miR-222 and SIRT1, but no direct target relationship was identified.

The interaction of PCa and its nerve fibers is observed in 80% of PCa and is termed perineural invasion (PNI). PCa cells have been observed traveling through the endoneurium of nerves, although the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Voltage sensitive sodium channels (VSSC) are multimeric transmembrane protein complexes comprised of a pore-forming α subunit and one or two auxiliary beta (β) subunits with inherent cell adhesion molecule (CAM) functions. The beta-2 isoform (gene SCN2B) interacts with several neural CAMs, while interacting putatively with other prominent neural CAMs. Furthermore, beta-2 exhibits elevated mRNA and protein levels in highly metastatic and castrate-resistant PCa. When overexpressed in weakly aggressive LNCaP cells (2BECFP), beta-2 alters LNCaP cell morphology and enhances LNCaP cell metastasis associated behavior in vitro. We hypothesize that PCa cells use beta-2 as a CAM during PNI and subsequent PCa metastasis. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of beta-2 expression on PCa cell neurotropic metastasis associated behavior. We overexpressed beta-2 as a fusion protein with enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (ECFP) in weakly aggressive LNCaP cells and observed neurotropic effects utilizing our novel ex vivo organotypic spinal cord co-culture model, and performed functional assays with neural matrices and atomic force microscopy. With increased beta-2 expression, PCa cells display a trend of enhanced association with nerve axons. On laminin, a neural CAM, overexpression of beta-2 enhances PCa cell migration, invasion, and growth. 2BECFP cells exhibit marked binding affinity to laminin relative to LNECFP controls, and recombinant beta-2 ectodomain elicits more binding events to laminin than BSA control. Functional overexpression of VSSC beta subunits in PCa may mediate PCa metastatic behavior through association with neural matrices.""","""['Keith H Jansson', 'Deborah G Castillo', 'Joseph W Morris', 'Mary E Boggs', 'Kirk J Czymmek', 'Elizabeth L Adams', 'Lawrence P Schramm', 'Robert A Sikes']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Overexpression of the VSSC-associated CAM, β-2, enhances LNCaP cell metastasis associated behavior.', 'Presenilin/gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of the voltage-gated sodium channel beta2-subunit regulates cell adhesion and migration.', 'Cellular interactions in the tropism of prostate cancer to bone.', 'The role of sodium channels in cell adhesion.', 'The laminin binding integrin alpha6beta1 in prostate cancer perineural invasion.', 'Voltage-gated sodium channels: from roles and mechanisms in the metastatic cell behavior to clinical potential as therapeutic targets.', 'The Role of Perineural Invasion in Prostate Cancer and Its Prognostic Significance.', 'Pharmacological and nutritional targeting of voltage-gated sodium channels in the treatment of cancers.', 'Cell-Adhesion Properties of β-Subunits in the Regulation of Cardiomyocyte Sodium Channels.', 'MicroRNA‑449a regulates the progression of brain aging by targeting SCN2B in SAMP8 mice.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of 29 cases treated with SRP, 23 cases of conventional technique and 6 cases assisted by the Da Vinci surgical system between August 2004 and March 2012 at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires. There was an attempt to preserve neurovascular bundles in cT1c patients with low tumor volume, Gleason score 7 or less, and favorable surgical anatomy. The degrees of postoperative incontinence and erectile function were recorded. The overall survival, the disease-specific survival, and the BCR-free survival were assessed. The BCR-free survival was compared among groups in accordance with the pre-and post-operative variables. RESULTS. No complications,injury to nearby organs or blood transfusions were recorded. Of all the patients, 85.7% showed normal continence (no pads used). Eight patients (27.5%) preserved their potency with sildenafil. There were 6 positive margins for tumor extension, 44.8% of pT3a, and 10.3% pT3b. All patients are alive at present, and 58.6% with at least 1 year of follow-up have a PSA with recovery criteria (less than 0.02 ng/mL). The biochemical recurrence (BCR) was 41.3%, and the estimated 4-year BCR-free survival was 51.7%. Of the groups analyzed, the presence of a preoperative Gleason score ≥8 and the presence of positive surgical margins (PSMs) significantly influenced the BCR-free survival, both in the univariate as well as the multivariate analysis (p=0.02 and 0.017, respectively). CONCLUSIONS. SRP is a challenging and achievable surgery with an acceptable complication rate, and constitutes a chance to cure patients with biochemical recurrence following prostate radiotherapy. The presence of a preoperative Gleason score ≥8, and the presence of PSMs in the specimen increase the chances of a BCR after four years post-SRP.""","""['Pablo F Martinez', 'Nicolas Billordo Peres', 'Christian Cristallo', 'Mariano Isola', 'Wenceslao Villamil', 'Carlos R Giudice', 'Oscar Damia']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['Salvage radical prostatectomy for recurrent prostate cancer: verification of European Association of Urology guideline criteria.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Radical prostatectomy and positive surgical margins: relationship with prostate cancer outcome.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Salvage radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparing open and robotic salvage radical prostatectomy after radiotherapy: predictors and outcomes.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.']"""

The RPC evaluates these irradiations to ensure that they agree with the institutions' treatment plans within criteria of the NCI-funded cooperative study groups. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an anthropomorphic spine phantom for proton matched-field irradiation, and to assess its use as a credentialing tool for proton therapy beams. We used an anthropomorphic spine phantom made of human vertebral bodies embedded in a tissue substitute material called Muscle Substitute/Solid Rigid Number 4 (MS/SR4) comprising three sections: a posterior section containing the posterior surface and the spinous processes, and left and right (L/R) sections containing the vertebral bodies and the transverse processes. After feasibility studies at three institutions, the phantom, containing two thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) for absolute dose measurements and two sheets of radiochromic film for relative dosimetry, was shipped consecutively to eight proton therapy centers participating in the approval study. At each center, the phantom was placed in a supine or prone position (according to the institution's spine treatment protocol) and imaged with computed tomography (CT). The images then were used with the institution's treatment planning system (TPS) to generate two matched fields, and the phantom was irradiated accordingly. The irradiated phantom was shipped to the RPC for analysis, and the measured values were compared with the institution's TPS dose and profiles using criteria of ± 7% for dose agreement and 5 mm for profile distance to agreement. All proton centers passed the dose criterion with a mean agreement of 3% (maximum observed agreement, 7%). One center failed the profile distance-to-agreement criterion on its initial irradiation, but its second irradiation passed the criterion. Another center failed the profile distance-to-agreement criterion, but no repeat irradiation was performed. Thus, seven of the eight institutions passed the film profile distance-to-agreement criterion with a mean agreement of 1.2 mm (maximum observed agreement 5 mm). We conclude that an anthropomorphic spine phantom using TLD and radiochromic film adequately verified dose delivery and field placement for matched-field treatments.""","""['Jongmin Cho', 'Paige A Summers', 'Geoffrey S Ibbott']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""[""Results From the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core Houston's Anthropomorphic Phantoms Used for Proton Therapy Clinical Trial Credentialing."", 'MO-D-BRB-04: The Approval Process for the Use of Proton Therapy in NCI-Sponsored Clinical Trials.', ""Design, development, and implementation of the radiological physics center's pelvis and thorax anthropomorphic quality assurance phantoms."", 'MO-D-BRB-03: Comparison of Proton Therapy Institutional Data Collected by the RPC.', 'Quality assurance for clinical trials.', 'Commissioning and initial experience with the first clinical gantry-mounted proton therapy system.']"""

Proton plans for prostate cancer (four cases) were generated in XiO treatment planning system (TPS). The beam arrangement in each proton plan consisted of three fields (two oblique fields and one lateral or slightly angled field), and the proton beams passing through a metal hip prosthesis was avoided. Dose calculations in proton plans were performed using the pencil beam algorithm. From each proton plan, planning target volume (PTV) coverage value (i.e., relative volume of the PTV receiving the prescription dose of 79.2 CGE) was recorded. The VMAT prostate planning was done using two arcs in the Eclipse TPS utilizing 6 MV X-rays, and beam entrance through metallic hip prosthesis was avoided. Dose computation in the VMAT plans was done using anisotropic analytical algorithm, and calculated VMAT plans were then normalized such that the PTV coverage in the VMAT plan was the same as in the proton plan of the corresponding case. The dose-volume histograms of calculated treatment plans were used to evaluate the dosimetric quality of USPT and VMAT. In comparison to the proton plans, on average, the maximum and mean doses to the PTV were higher in the VMAT plans by 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively, whereas the minimum PTV dose was lower in the VMAT plans by 3.4%. The proton plans had lower (or better) average homogeneity index (HI) of 0.03 compared to the one for VMAT (HI = 0.04). The relative rectal volume exposed to radiation was lower in the proton plan, with an average absolute difference ranging from 0.1% to 32.6%. In contrast, using proton planning, the relative bladder volume exposed to radiation was higher at high-dose region with an average absolute difference ranging from 0.4% to 0.8%, and lower at low- and medium-dose regions with an average absolute difference ranging from 2.7% to 10.1%. The average mean dose to the rectum and bladder was lower in the proton plans by 45.1% and 22.0%, respectively, whereas the mean dose to femoral head was lower in VMAT plans by an average difference of 79.6%. In comparison to the VMAT, the proton planning produced lower equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for the rectum (43.7 CGE vs. 51.4 Gy) and higher EUD for the femoral head (16.7 CGE vs. 9.5 Gy), whereas both the VMAT and proton planning produced comparable EUDs for the prostate tumor (76.2 CGE vs. 76.8 Gy) and bladder (50.3 CGE vs. 51.1 Gy).

Incident cancer cases from 2000-2009 were identified through record linkage with the cancer registry of Rhineland-Palatinate. Information on exposure to shift work and potential confounders, including age, smoking status, job level, and employment duration, was extracted from the personnel and health records. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for potential confounders.

Targeting theranostic GNRs specifically to cancer cells is necessary to enhance treatment efficacy and minimize undesired side effects. In this study, targeting functionalized GNR to EphA2 receptors that are overexpressed on prostate cancer cells was investigated as a strategy to achieve enhanced GNR uptake by cancer cells. In addition, the influence of targeting peptide orientation on functionalized GNR uptake by PC-3 cells was explored. GNRs of aspect ratio 4 were functionalized with an EphA2 homing peptide, YSA, using a layer-by-layer polypeptide wrapping approach. In parallel, an analogous population of YSA-modified GNRs, which display a reversed YSA peptide, with the N- and C- termini reversed, was also prepared. GC-MS analysis of the YSA-GNRs indicated that functionalized GNRs displayed approximately 3000 peptides/GNR. The functionalized GNRs remained well-dispersed in biological media for short times (<24 h). An increase in GNRs uptake of the YSA-GNRs by PC-3 cells, compared to the reversed YSA-GNRs, was observed under identical incubation conditions. Lastly, the effect of the YSA-GNRs binding to EphA2 receptors on prostate cancer cell proliferation was also studied. The YSA-functionalized GNRs inhibit PC-3 proliferation at a significantly lower effective dose than free YSA.

Intolerance of uncertainty may exacerbate this hypothesized relationship by predisposing individuals to approach uncertain situations such as cancer survivorship in an inflexible and negative manner. We investigated whether greater cognitive complaints and higher intolerance of uncertainty would interact in their relation to more cancer-related distress symptoms.  Methods:   This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study included 67 prostate cancer survivors who were 3 to 5 years post treatment. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses tested the extent to which intolerance of uncertainty, cognitive complaints, and their interaction were associated with cancer-related distress (measured with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised; IES-R) after adjusting for age, education, physical symptoms, and fear of cancer recurrence.  Results:   Intolerance of uncertainty was positively associated with the IES-R avoidance and hyperarousal subscales. More cognitive complaints were associated with higher scores on the IES-R hyperarousal subscale. The interaction of intolerance of uncertainty and cognitive complaints was significantly associated with IES-R intrusion, such that greater cognitive complaints were associated with greater intrusive thoughts in survivors high in intolerance of uncertainty but not those low in it.

This technique is now being used for non-spine bony metastases in addition to liver, spine, and lung. However, there are few studies examining the toxicity and outcomes of SBRT for non-spine bone metastases.  Methods and materials:   Between 2008 and 2012, 74 subjects with oligometastatic non-spine bony metastases of varying histologies were treated at the Mayo Clinic with SBRT. A total of 85 non-spine bony sites were treated. Median local control, overall survival, and progression-free survival were described. Acute toxicity (defined as toxicity <90 days) and late toxicity (defined as toxicity ≥90 days) were reported and graded as per standardized Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0 criteria.  Results:   The median age of patients treated was 60 years. The most common histology was prostate cancer (31%) and most patients had fewer than 3 sites of disease at the time of simulation (64%). Most of the non-spine bony sites lay within the pelvis (65%). Dose and fractionation varied but the most common prescription was 24 Gy/1 fraction. Local recurrence occurred in 7 patients with a median time to failure of 2.8 months. Local control was 91.8% at 1 year. With a median follow-up of 7.6 months, median SBRT specific overall survival and progression-free survival were 9.3 months and 9.7 months, respectively. Eighteen patients developed acute toxicity (mostly grade 1 and 2 fatigue and acute pain flare); 9 patients developed grade 1-2 late toxicities. Two patients developed pathologic fractures but both were asymptomatic. There were no late grade 3 or 4 toxicities.

Median nPSA and TnPSA were undetectable and 6.7 months, respectively. On univariate analysis, a detectable nPSA (P < .01) and TnPSA <6 months (P < .01) were predictive of all outcomes. In a training cohort, a 14-point nomogram incorporating detectable nPSA, TnPSA, Gleason score, pre-radiation therapy PSA, and seminal vesicle invasion predicted BF (hazard ratio[HR], 1.4; P < .0001), DM (HR, 1.3; P < .0001), PCSD (HR, 1.3; P < .0001), and decreased OS (HR, 1.2; P < .0001). Adding nPSA and TnPSA improved the prognostic value of the nomogram compared to using clinical predictors only. The nomogram was evaluated in a validation cohort where it was predictive of BF (c-index = 0.77), DM (0.73), and PCSD (0.69).  Conclusions:   Patients with a detectable nPSA also having a TnPSA <6 months post-SRT are at high-risk for DM, PCSD, and decreased OS. These patients are unlikely to have clinically localized disease and should be considered for initiation of systemic therapies.""","""['William C Jackson', 'Skyler B Johnson', 'Benjamin Foster', 'Corey Foster', 'Darren Li', 'Yeohan Song', 'Jeffrey Vainshtein', 'Jessica Zhou', 'Daniel A Hamstra', 'Felix Y Feng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Time to Nadir PSA: Of Popes and PSA--The Immortality Bias.', 'Larger maximum tumor diameter at radical prostatectomy is associated with increased biochemical failure, metastasis, and death from prostate cancer after salvage radiation for prostate cancer.', 'A prostate-specific antigen doubling time of <6 months is prognostic for metastasis and prostate cancer-specific death for patients receiving salvage radiation therapy post radical prostatectomy.', 'The interval to biochemical failure is prognostic for metastasis, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and overall mortality after salvage radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Older age predicts decreased metastasis and prostate cancer-specific death for men treated with radiation therapy: meta-analysis of radiation therapy oncology group trials.', 'Surrogate endpoints in early prostate cancer research.', 'A phase 2 trial of salvage radiation and concurrent weekly docetaxel after a rising prostate-specific antigen level after radical prostatectomy.', 'Defining biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and timing of early salvage radiotherapy : Informing the debate.']"""

In vitro tests also confirmed that it can promote apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. We investigated the effect of whole-tomato supplement lycopene on the prostate-specific antigen velocity in selected prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Twenty selected prostate cancer patients were given whole-tomato supplement lycopene 10 mg per day for about 6 months. Blood samples of patients were collected weekly to measure serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. PSA velocity slope, which reflects the change of PSA, and the degree of change were also calculated. By comparing the values of average PSA velocity slope (rise or fall of PSA) before and after the administration of lycopene, the effect of lycopene can be evaluated. Blood chemistry analysis was regular followed as safety control.  Results:   Three patients in the research group withdrew within 3 weeks because of inability to conform. The rest 17 patients continued for an average period of 6 months. Two patients withdrew because of cancer progression (PSA rise) who later received active treatment. The average fall in PSA was equivalent to 2.56% over (i.e. an average slope/d of -0.000 28) the first 3 months. In the last 3 months, average fall in PSA was equivalent to 31.58% (i.e. an average slope/d of -0.003 51). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed a statistically significant decrease of PSA velocity slope overall (P = 0.000 9). Analysis of the PSA doubling time (pre- vs. post-treatment) showed a median increase over 3 months but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.21). No toxic side effect was observed during the whole process. The results indicate that the average PSA change is ""decline"" in patients, and the degree of the decline is accelerated.

Background:   Radical prostate cancer treatments are associated with changes in quality of life. Differences between patients undergoing different treatments in symptoms and quality of life have been reported, but there are limited long-term data comparing radical prostatectomy with radical external beam radiotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy.  Design:   A cross-sectional survey design was used.  Methods:   The study sample included 143 men treated with radical prostatectomy and/or radical external beam radiotherapy. Quality of life was measured using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey and the 50-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Instrument. Questions assessing overall Quality of life and satisfaction with information were included. Descriptive statistics and interference statistical methods were applied to analyse the data.  Results:   Radical external beam radiotherapy was associated with less urinary incontinence and better urinary function. There were no differences between the groups for disease-specific quality of life sum scores. Sexual quality of life was reported very low in all groups. Disease-specific quality of life and health-related quality of life were associated with overall quality of life. Patients having undergone surgery were more satisfied with information, and there was a positive correlation between quality of life and patient satisfaction.  Conclusion:   Pretreatment information and patient education lead to better quality of life and satisfaction. This study indicates a need for structured, pretreatment information and follow-up for all men going through radical prostate cancer treatment.  Relevance to clinical practice:   Long-term quality of life effects should be considered when planning follow-up and information for men after radical prostate cancer treatment.

Material and methods:   Thirty-three patients underwent DWI and 11C-choline PET/CT prior to prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Mean standardised uptake value (SUV(mean)) and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of 76 identified lymph nodes (LN) were measured and correlated with histopathology. ADC values and SUVs were compared using linear regression analysis.  Results:   A significant difference between benign and malignant LN was observed for ADC values (1.17 vs. 0.96 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; P < 0.001) and SUV(mean) (1.61 vs. 3.20; P < 0.001). ROC analysis revealed an optimal ADC threshold of 1.01 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s for differentiating benign from malignant LN with corresponding sensitivity/specificity of 69.70%/78.57% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.785. The optimal threshold for SUV(mean) was 2.5 with corresponding sensitivity/specificity of 69.72%/90.48% and with an AUC of 0.832. ADC values and SUV(mean) showed a moderate significant inverse correlation (r = -0.63).  Conclusion:   Both modalities reveal similar moderate diagnostic performance for preoperative lymph node staging of prostate cancer, not justifying their application in routine clinical practice at this time. The only moderate inverse correlation between ADC values and SUV(mean) suggests that both imaging parameters might provide complementary information on tumour biology.

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was used to compare gene expression in HPT-JT syndrome, sporadic parathyroid adenoma and normal parathyroid glands. We identified differentially regulated genes in HPT-JT syndrome and sporadic parathyroid adenoma relative to normal parathyroid glands using a combination of Welch's t-test and fold-change analysis. Quantitative PCR, RT-PCR and IHC were used for validation. Sixteen genes differentially regulated in the parathyroid carcinoma were associated with signal pathways, MAPK, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, prostate cancer and apoptosis.

Aims:   Our goals were to: (i) describe HRQOL and examine changes in sexual functioning and bother; (ii) explore the psychosocial aspects of sexual health after PCa; and (iii) examine whether there were significant differences on HRQOL and sexual behavior between GMPCa and published norms.  Methods:   A convenience sample of GMPCa completed validated disease-specific and general measures of HRQOL, ejaculatory function and bother, fear of cancer recurrence, and satisfaction with prostate cancer care. Measures of self-efficacy for PCa management, illness intrusiveness, and disclosure of sexual orientation were also completed. Where possible, scores were compared against published norms.  Main outcome measures:   Main outcome measures were self-reported sexual functioning and bother on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index.  Results:   Compared with norms, GMPCa reported significantly worse functioning and more severe bother scores on urinary, bowel, hormonal symptom scales (Ps < 0.015-0.0001), worse mental health functioning (P < 0.0001), greater fear of cancer recurrence (P < 0.0001), and were more dissatisfied with their PCa medical care. However, GMPCa reported better sexual functioning scores (P < 0.002) compared with norms. Many of the observed differences met criteria for clinical significance. Physical functioning HRQOL and sexual bother scores were similar to that of published samples. GMPCa tended to be more ""out"" about their sexual orientation than other samples of gay men.  Conclusions:   GMPCa reported substantial changes in sexual functioning after PCa treatment.

However, this method does not address pain that is associated with ultrasound probe insertion, and the injection of local anaesthetic itself causes pain. The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of methoxyflurane delivered by a Penthrox inhaler as a novel method of pain relief during TRUSPB.  Method:   From July 2012 to July 2013, 64 patients were scheduled at a single centre to undergo TRUSPB while receiving analgesia via Penthrox inhaler. Fifteen minutes after the biopsy procedure, these patients were asked to complete a pain score survey using a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) to separately report the degree of pain experienced during digital rectal examination (DRE), ultrasound probe insertion and core biopsy.  Results:   The median pain scores on a 10-cm VAS were 2.0, 2.4 and 3.0 during DRE, probe insertion and needle biopsy, respectively, while using the Penthrox inhaler. Of the 64 patients, 11 had undergone TRUSPB previously receiving PILA. In these patients, PILA was significantly better than the Penthrox inhaler for pain relief during needle biopsy (median pain score 2.0 versus 4.0; P = 0.012).

Also epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was found to have multiple roles in prostatic tumorigenesis. However, the EGFR-mediated chemoresistance mechanism in human PC was not well delineated. In this study, we explored the mechanism of EGFR-mediated docetaxel resistance in PC. A series of stable docetaxel-resistant PC/DX sublines were established at our laboratory. The docetaxel IC50s of PC3 and PC/DX25 cells were 0.01 and 1.33 μM, respectively. Cellular resistance to docetaxel was significantly associated with increased EGFR and EGFR activation in PC/DX25. There was a dose-dependent increase in EGFR expression associated with the magnitude of docetaxel resistance. Expression of EGFR in PC/DX25 was higher than that in PC3, RWPE-1 and LNCaP cells. Similar results were also found in human PC tissues by immunohistochemical staining. We showed that docetaxel sensitivity can be stored in PC/DX25 cells by knockdown and inactivation of EGFR expression through EGFR siRNA and specific inhibitors, respectively. Contrarily, overexpression of EGFR or recombinant EGF protein treatment could rescue PC3 cells from docetaxel-mediated cytotoxicity.

Due to the absence of a ligand binding domain located in the AR-C-terminus, these receptor variants (also termed ARΔLBD) are unable to respond to all classical forms of endocrine treatments like surgical/chemical castration and/or application of anti-androgens.  Methodology:   In this study we tested the effects of the naturally occurring stilbene resveratrol (RSV) and (E)-4-(2, 6-Difluorostyryl)-N, N-dimethylaniline, a fluorinated dialkylaminostilbene (FIDAS) on AR- and ARΔLBD in prostate cancer cells. The ability of the compounds to modulate transcriptional activity of AR and the ARΔLBD-variant Q640X was shown by reporter gene assays. Expression of endogenous AR and ARΔLBD mRNA and protein levels were determined by qRT-PCR and Western Blot. Nuclear translocation of AR-molecules was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. AR and ARΔLBD/Q640X homo-/heterodimer formation was assessed by mammalian two hybrid assays. Biological activity of both compounds in vivo was demonstrated using a chick chorioallantoic membrane xenograft assay.  Results:   The stilbenes RSV and FIDAS were able to significantly diminish AR and Q640X-signalling. Successful inhibition of the Q640X suggests that RSV and FIDAS are not interfering with the AR-ligand binding domain like all currently available anti-hormonal drugs. Repression of AR and Q640X-signalling by RSV and FIDAS in prostate cancer cells was caused by an inhibition of the AR and/or Q640X-dimerization. Although systemic bioavailability of both stilbenes is very low, both compounds were also able to downregulate tumor growth and AR-signalling in vivo.  Conclusion:   RSV and FIDAS are able to inhibit the dimerization of AR and ARΔLBD molecules suggesting that stilbenes might serve as lead compounds for a novel generation of AR-inhibitors.""","""['Wolfgang Streicher', 'Manuel Luedeke', 'Anca Azoitei', 'Friedemann Zengerling', 'Alexander Herweg', 'Felicitas Genze', 'Mark G Schrader', 'Andres J Schrader', 'Marcus V Cronauer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['AR-Q640X, a model to study the effects of constitutively active C-terminally truncated AR variants in prostate cancer cells.', 'Effects of sorafenib on C-terminally truncated androgen receptor variants in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of IGF-1R diminishes transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor and its constitutively active, C-terminally truncated counterparts Q640X and AR-V7.', 'Experimental evidence of persistent androgen-receptor-dependency in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'C-terminally truncated constitutively active androgen receptor variants and their biologic and clinical significance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Resveratrol in Human Male Fertility.', 'Resistance to Antiandrogens in Prostate Cancer: Is It Inevitable, Intrinsic or Induced?', 'Prevention of Prostate Cancer in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate Mice by Yellow Passion Fruit Extract and Antiproliferative Effects of Its Bioactive Compound Piceatannol.', 'Alcohol Intake and Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.', 'ETS Related Gene mediated Androgen Receptor Aggregation and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Prostate Cancer Development.']"""

Furthermore, the effect of 5ARIs on progression and prostate cancer death remains unclear.  Objective:   To determine the association between 5ARI use and development of high-grade or lethal prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective observational study of 38,058 men followed up for prostate cancer diagnosis and outcomes between 1996 and 2010 in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.  Exposures:   Use of 5ARIs between 1996 and 2010.  Main outcomes and measures:   Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate risk of prostate cancer diagnosis or development of lethal disease with 5ARI use, adjusting for possible confounders including prostate specific antigen testing.  Results:   During 448,803 person-years of follow-up, we ascertained 3681 incident prostate cancer cases. Of these, 289 were lethal (metastatic or fatal), 456 were high grade (Gleason sum [GS] 8-10), 1238 were GS 7, and 1600 were low grade (GS 2-6). A total of 2878 (7.6%) men reported use of 5ARIs between 1996 and 2010. After adjusting for confounders, men who reported ever using 5ARIs over the study period had a reduced risk of overall prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.91). 5ARI users had a reduced risk of GS 7 (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.91) and low-grade (GS 2-6) prostate cancer (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.95). 5ARI use was not associated with risk of high-grade (GS 8-10) prostate cancer (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.64-1.46) or lethal disease (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.58-1.69). Increased duration of use was associated with significantly lower risk of overall prostate cancer (HR for 1 year of additional use, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99), localized (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90-1.00), and low-grade disease (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.99). There was no association for lethal, high-grade, or grade 7 disease.  Conclusions and relevance:   While 5ARI use was not associated with developing high-grade or lethal prostate cancer, it was associated with a reduction in low-grade, GS 7, and overall prostate cancer. Because the number of patients with high-grade or lethal prostate cancer in our cohort was limited, we cannot rule out potential risk of harm with 5ARI use.""","""['Mark A Preston', 'Kathryn M Wilson', 'Sarah C Markt', 'Rongbin Ge', 'Christopher Morash', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Massimo Loda', 'Edward Giovannucci', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Aria F Olumi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""JAMA Intern Med""","""['Impact of 5α-reductase inhibitor and α-blocker therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia on prostate cancer incidence and mortality.', 'Long-term use of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors is safe and effective in men on active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Association of Treatment With 5α-Reductase Inhibitors With Time to Diagnosis and Mortality in Prostate Cancer.', 'Five-alpha-reductase Inhibitors for prostate cancer prevention.', 'A broader role for 5ARIs in prostate disease?

We hypothesized that androgen deprivation needs additional transcription factors to orchestrate the changes taking place in the gland after castration and for the adaptation of the epithelial cells to the androgen-deprived environment, ultimately contributing to the origin of castration-resistant prostate cancer. This study was undertaken to identify transcription factors that regulate gene expression after androgen deprivation by castration (Cas). For the sake of comparison, we extended the analysis to the effects of administration of a high dose of 17β-estradiol (E2) and a combination of both (Cas+E2). We approached this by (i) identifying gene expression profiles and enrichment terms, and by searching for transcription factors in the derived regulatory pathways; and (ii) by determining the density of putative transcription factor binding sites in the proximal promoter of the 10 most up- or down-regulated genes in each experimental group in comparison to the controls Gapdh and Tbp7. Filtering and validation confirmed the expression and localized EVI1 (Mecom), NFY, ELK1, GATA2, MYBL1, MYBL2, and NFkB family members (NFkB1, NFkB2, REL, RELA and RELB) in the epithelial and/or stromal cells. These transcription factors represent major regulators of epithelial cell survival and immaturity as well as an adaptation of the gland as an immune barrier in the absence of functional stimulation by androgens. Elk1 was expressed in smooth muscle cells and was up-regulated after day 4. Evi1 and Nfy genes are expressed in both epithelium and stroma, but were apparently not affected by androgen deprivation.""","""['Rafaela Rosa-Ribeiro', 'Umar Nishan', 'Ramon Oliveira Vidal', 'Guilherme Oliveira Barbosa', 'Leonardo Oliveira Reis', 'Carlos Lenz Cesar', 'Hernandes F Carvalho']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['CCAAT/Enhancer binding protein β controls androgen-deprivation-induced senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Stromal transforming growth factor-beta signaling mediates prostatic response to androgen ablation by paracrine Wnt activity.', 'Transcription regulators are transiently expressed during the prostate gland adaptation to the hypoandrogenic environment.', 'Androgens regulate the immune/inflammatory response and cell survival pathways in rat ventral prostate epithelial cells.', 'Androgen receptor signalling in prostate: effects of stromal factors on normal and cancer stem cells.', 'Exploration the global single-cell ecological landscape of adenomyosis-related cell clusters by single-cell RNA sequencing.', 'LncRNA-MALAT1 Regulates Cancer Glucose Metabolism in Prostate Cancer via MYBL2/mTOR Axis.', 'MYBL2 disrupts the Hippo-YAP pathway and confers castration resistance and metastatic potential in prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptional regulators and regulatory pathways involved in prostate gland adaptation to a hypoandrogen environment.', 'Estrogen therapy in patients with prostate cancer: a contemporary systematic review.']"""

These difficulties can lead to anxiety, depression and reduced quality of life. Many partners also experience psychological distress. An additional impact can be on the couple relationship, with changes to intimacy, and unmet psychosexual supportive needs in relation to sexual recovery and rehabilitation. The aim of this exploratory randomised controlled trial pilot study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel family-relational-psychosexual intervention to support intimacy and reduce distress among couples following prostate cancer surgery and to estimate the efficacy of this intervention.  Methods/design:   The intervention will comprise six sessions of psychosexual and relationship support delivered by experienced couple-support practitioners. Specialist training in delivering the intervention will be provided to practitioners and they will be guided by a detailed treatment manual based on systemic principles. Sixty-eight couples will be randomised to receive either the intervention or standard care (comprising usual follow-up hospital appointments). A pre-test, post-test design will be used to test the feasibility of the intervention (baseline, end of intervention and six-month follow-up) and its acceptability to couples and healthcare professionals (qualitative interviews). Both individual and relational outcome measures will assess sexual functioning, anxiety and depression, couple relationship, use of health services and erectile dysfunction medication/technologies. An economic analysis will estimate population costs of the intervention, compared to usual care, using simple modelling to evaluate the affordability of the intervention.  Discussion:   Given the increasing incidence and survival of post-operative men with prostate cancer, it is timely and appropriate to determine the feasibility of a definitive trial through a pilot randomised controlled trial of a family-relational-psychosexual intervention for couples. The study will provide evidence about the components of a couple-based intervention, its acceptability to patients and healthcare professionals, and its influence on sexual and relational functioning. Data from this study will be used to calculate sample sizes required for any definitive trial.

However, precision during radiotherapy cannot be maintained when unexpected intrafraction organ motion occurs.  Case presentation:   We report our experience of internal organ motion caused by persistent gas production in a patient taking an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. A 68-year-old Japanese man with prostate cancer visited our institution for treatment with helical tomotherapy. He suffered from diabetes mellitus and took an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. Routine treatment planning computed tomography showed a large volume of rectal gas; an enema was given to void the rectum. Subsequent treatment planning computed tomography again showed a large volume of gas. After exercise (walking) to remove the intestinal gas, a third scan was performed as a test scan without tight fixation, which showed a sufficiently empty rectum for planning. However, after only a few minutes, treatment planning computed tomography again showed extreme accumulation of gas. Therefore, we postponed treatment planning computed tomography and consulted his doctor to suspend the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, which was the expected cause of his persistent gas. Four days after the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor regimen was suspended, we took a fourth treatment planning computed tomography and made a treatment plan without gas accumulation. Thereafter, the absence of rectal gas accumulation was confirmed using daily megavolt computed tomography before treatment, and the patient received 37 fractions of intensity-modified radiotherapy at 74 Gy without rectal gas complications. In this case study, the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor induced the accumulation of intestinal gas, which may have caused unexpected organ motion, untoward reactions, and insufficient doses to clinical targets.  Conclusions:   We suggest that patients who are taking an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor for diabetes should discontinue use of that particular medicine prior to beginning radiotherapy.""","""['Takuya Nishimura', 'Hideya Yamazaki', 'Kazuki Iwama', 'Yoshitaka Oota', 'Norihiro Aibe', 'Satoaki Nakamura', 'Ken Yoshida', 'Haruumi Okabe', 'Kei Yamada']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Med Case Rep""","""['Dose impact of rectal gas on prostatic IMRT and VMAT.', 'Evidence of limited motion of the prostate by carefully emptying the rectum as assessed by daily MVCT image guidance with helical tomotherapy.', 'Online image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: How much improvement can we expect?

However, men's views about dietary change in PC survivorship are largely unknown. This multi-centre qualitative interview study explored men's views about dietary change in PC survivorship, to better understand motivations for, and barriers to, achieving desired changes. The role of radical and active surveillance treatments on dietary change and the influence of men's partners were examined. Focus groups also evaluated stakeholder opinion, including healthcare professionals, about the provision of dietary advice to PC patients.  Methods:   A multi-centre interview study explored views about diet and motivations for, and barriers to, dietary change in men at elevated risk or diagnosed with PC following prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. 58 men and 11 partners were interviewed. Interviews and focus groups were undertaken with 11 healthcare professionals, 5 patients and 4 partners to evaluate stakeholders' opinions about the feasibility and acceptability of providing dietary advice to PC patients. Data were analysed using methods of constant comparison and thematic analysis.  Results:   Over half of diagnosed men reported making dietary changes, primarily to promote general or prostate health or facilitate coping, despite their uncertainty about diet-PC links. Interest in dietary advice was high. Information needs varied depending on treatment received, with men on active surveillance more frequently modifying their diet and regarding this as an adjunct therapy. Men considered their partners integral to implementing changes. Provision of dietary advice to men diagnosed with PC was considered by healthcare professionals and men to be feasible and appropriate in the context of a holistic 'care package'.  Conclusions:   Many men make positive dietary changes after PC diagnosis, which are perceived by men and their partners to bring psychological and general health benefits and could help future dietary intervention trials. Men and their partners desire more and better dietary information that may support PC survivorship, particularly among those embarking on active surveillance/monitoring programmes. There are opportunities for healthcare professionals to support PC patients both clinically and psychologically by the routine integration of healthy eating advice into survivorship care plans.""","""['Kerry N L Avery', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Jeremy Horwood', 'David E Neal', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Chris Parker', 'Julia Wade', 'Athene Lane']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Fam Pract""","""['Men with prostate cancer make positive dietary changes following diagnosis and treatment.', ""Men's knowledge and attitudes towards dietary prevention of a prostate cancer diagnosis: a qualitative study."", ""Gender relations and couple negotiations of British men's food practice changes after prostate cancer."", 'Facilitators and barriers to participation in lifestyle modification for men with prostate cancer: A scoping review.', ""Men, food, and prostate cancer: gender influences on men's diets."", 'Challenges to Recruiting Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer in Clinical Chemoprevention Trials.', 'Access to nutrition services and information after active cancer treatment: a mixed methods study.', 'Effects of Green Tea Catechins on Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention: The Role of the Gut Microbiome.', 'Psychosocial Determinants of Lifestyle Change after a Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Feasibility of a Weight Management Program Tailored for Overweight Men with Localized Prostate Cancer - A Pilot Study.']"""

The Deltex (DTX)-3-like E3 ubiquitin ligase (DTX3L), also known as B-lymphoma and BAL-associated protein (BBAP), was originally identified as a binding partner of the diphtheria-toxin-like macrodomain containing ADP-ribosyltransferase-9 (ARTD9), also known as BAL1 and PARP9. We have previously demonstrated that ARTD9 acts as a novel oncogenic survival factor in high-risk, chemo-resistant, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase ARTD8, also known as PARP14 functions as a STAT6-specific co-regulator of IL4-mediated proliferation and survival in B cells.  Methods:   Co-expression of DTX3L, ARTD8, ARTD9 and STAT1 was analyzed in the metastatic PCa (mPCa) cell lines PC3, DU145, LNCaP and in the normal prostate luminal epithelial cell lines HPE and RWPE1. Effects on cell proliferation, survival and cell migration were determined in PC3, DU145 and/or LNCaP cells depleted of DTX3L, ARTD8, ARTD9, STAT1 and/or IRF1 compared to their proficient control cells, respectively. In further experiments, real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitations were conducted to evaluate the physical and functional interactions between DTX3L, ARTD8 and ARTD9.  Results:   Here we could identify DTX3L, ARTD9 and ARTD8 as novel oncogenic survival factors in mPCa cells. Our studies revealed that DTX3L forms a complex with ARTD8 and mediates together with ARTD8 and ARTD9 proliferation, chemo-resistance and survival of mPCa cells. In addition, DTX3L, ARTD8 and ARTD9 form complexes with each other. Our study provides first evidence that the enzymatic activity of ARTD8 is required for survival of mPCa cells. DTX3L and ARTD9 act together as repressors of the tumor suppressor IRF1 in mPCa cells.

These CAFs are now accepted as important players in cancer dynamics, being involved in tumour growth and progression. Although there are various reports on the interaction between tumour and stromal cells, the clinico-pathological significance of this cross-talk is still largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to characterise the expression of key metabolic proteins involved in glucose transport, pyruvate/lactate shuttle system, glycolytic metabolism and fatty acid oxidation in CAFs and tumour cells in different stages of malignant transformation. We further aimed to contextualise the clinico-pathological significance of these protein expression profiles with reference to known prognostic indicators, including biochemical recurrence in pT stage.  Methods:   Prostate tissues were obtained from 480 patients with a median age of 64 years following radical prostatectomy with no previous hormonal therapy. Tissues were analysed for the expression of several key metabolism-related proteins in glands and surrounding fibroblasts by immunohistochemistry. Reliable markers of prognosis such as pT stage and biochemical recurrence were assessed for each case.  Results:   We observed that prostate cancer cells did not rely mainly on glycolytic metabolism, while there was a high expression of MCT4 and CAIX - in CAFs. This corroborates the hypothesis of the ""Reverse Warburg effect"" in prostate cancer, in which fibroblasts are under oxidative stress and express CAIX, an established hypoxia marker. We found that alterations in the expression of metabolism-related proteins were already evident in the early stages of malignant transformation, suggesting the continuing alteration of CAFs from an early stage. Additionally, and for the first time, we show that cases showing high MCT4 expression in CAFs with concomitant strong MCT1 expression in prostate cancer (PCa) cells are associated with poor clinical outcome, namely pT3 stage of the tumour.  Conclusions:   In summary, this work demonstrates for the first time the clinico-pathological significance of the lactate shuttle in prostate cancer. It also suggests that other alterations in CAFs may be useful prognostic factors, and further supports the use of MCT1/MCT4 as targets for PCa therapy.""","""['Nelma Pértega-Gomes', 'José R Vizcaíno', 'Jan Attig', 'Sarah Jurmeister', 'Carlos Lopes', 'Fátima Baltazar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Tumor-stroma metabolic relationship based on lactate shuttle can sustain prostate cancer progression.', 'Reciprocal metabolic reprogramming through lactate shuttle coordinately influences tumor-stroma interplay.', 'Monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) and CD147 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Metabolic coupling and the Reverse Warburg Effect in cancer: Implications for novel biomarker and anticancer agent development.', 'Lactate transporters in the context of prostate cancer metabolism: what do we know?', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'Cancer Stem Cells and Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'Prognostic Value of Monocarboxylate Transporter 1 Overexpression in Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'Targeting cancer-specific metabolic pathways for developing novel cancer therapeutics.']"""

Typically, these screens use gammaretroviruses (γRV) or transposons as insertional mutagens. However, insertional mutations from replication-competent γRVs or transposons that occur later during oncogenesis can produce passenger mutations that do not drive cancer progression. Here, we utilized a replication-incompetent lentiviral vector (LV) to perform an insertional mutagenesis screen to identify genes in the progression to androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC).  Methods:   Prostate cancer cells were mutagenized with a LV to enrich for clones with a selective advantage in an androgen-deficient environment provided by a dysregulated gene(s) near the vector integration site. We performed our screen using an in vitro AIPC model and also an in vivo xenotransplant model for AIPC. Our approach identified proviral integration sites utilizing a shuttle vector that allows for rapid rescue of plasmids in E. coli that contain LV long terminal repeat (LTR)-chromosome junctions. This shuttle vector approach does not require PCR amplification and has several advantages over PCR-based techniques.  Results:   Proviral integrations were enriched near prostate cancer susceptibility loci in cells grown in androgen-deficient medium (p < 0.001), and five candidate genes that influence AIPC were identified; ATPAF1, GCOM1, MEX3D, PTRF, and TRPM4. Additionally, we showed that RNAi knockdown of ATPAF1 significantly reduces growth (p < 0.05) in androgen-deficient conditions.  Conclusions:   Our approach has proven effective for use in PCa, identifying a known prostate cancer gene, PTRF, and also several genes not previously associated with prostate cancer. The replication-incompetent shuttle vector approach has broad potential applications for cancer gene discovery, and for interrogating diverse biological and disease processes.""","""['Ellyn N Schinke', 'Victor Bii', 'Arun Nalla', 'Dustin T Rae', 'Laura Tedrick', 'Gary G Meadows', 'Grant D Trobridge']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Lentiviral vector-mediated insertional mutagenesis screen identifies genes that influence androgen independent prostate cancer progression and predict clinical outcome.', 'Mutagenesis Screens for Prostate Cancer Using Replication-Incompetent Lentiviral Vectors.', 'Replication-incompetent gammaretroviral and lentiviral vector-based insertional mutagenesis screens identify prostate cancer progression genes.', 'Identifying Cancer Driver Genes Using Replication-Incompetent Retroviral Vectors.', 'Cancer gene discovery: exploiting insertional mutagenesis.', 'On the modulation of TRPM channels: Current perspectives and anticancer therapeutic implications.', 'Investigation of the Potential Correlation Between RNA-Binding Proteins in the Evolutionarily Conserved MEX3 Family and Non-small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Calcium-Related Genes Predicting Outcomes and Serving as Therapeutic Targets in Endometrial Cancer.', 'Investigation of the effects of overexpression of jumping translocation breakpoint (JTB) protein in MCF7 cells for potential use as a biomarker in breast cancer.', 'RNA-binding protein MEX3D promotes cervical carcinoma tumorigenesis by destabilizing TSC22D1 mRNA.']"""

Most cases are diagnosed at advanced stage due to early metastasis. The bones, liver, regional and distant lymph nodes are the most common sites of metastasis of small cell carcinoma of the prostate. Skin metastasis of small cell carcinoma of the prostate is a very rare entity due to the uncommon metastatic site. Here, we describe the case of a patient with small cell carcinoma of the prostate which metastasized to his skin.  Case presentation:   A 74-year-old Caucasian man presented to another urology center for mild lower urinary tract symptoms in 2003. His prostate-specific antigen was 23 ng/mL. According to the physical examination signs and prostate-specific antigen, he underwent a transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. The pathologic examination of his prostate revealed a Gleason score: 3 + 4 = 7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Investigations showed stage T2N0M0 disease and he was treated with radiotherapy to his pelvic lymph nodes and prostate. Six years after the initial diagnosis, he complained of a palpable left-side 2 × 2 cm subcutaneous solitary mass localized just behind his scapula. The results of his laboratory tests including serum acid phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen were in normal ranges. Our general surgery department performed a diagnostic biopsy of the mass and totally excised the lesion. The pathologic examination of the mass showed small cell carcinoma metastasis with chromogranin + and the pathologist advised us to examine the lung or prostate for the primary tumor. The patient undertook a transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and the pathologic result revealed small cell carcinoma within residual adenocarcinoma. We investigated the other sites for metastasis and restaging investigations showed a 1cm metastatic lesion in his liver. Our medical oncology department decided to treat him with combination chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin in six cycles; however, he died due to disseminated myocardial infarction before starting the fifth combination chemotherapy cycle.  Conclusions:   Clinicians should keep in mind that early diagnosis of this disease is very difficult due to early metastatic spread of small cell carcinoma and lack of concordant elevation of prostate-specific antigen. There is no accepted standard treatment modality for this pathology and overall prognosis is poor.""","""['Kursat Cecen', 'Mert Ali Karadag', 'Aslan Demir', 'Ramazan Kocaaslan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Med Case Rep""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prostate small cell carcinoma and skin metastases: a rare entity.', 'Complete remission in a patient with metastatic mixed adenocarcinoma/extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Small cell carcinoma of the prostate: a case report.', 'A case of prostatic small cell carcinoma.', 'Primary Neuroendocrine Tumor of Prostate in a Case of Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of Lung: Rare Entity with Histopathological and Gallium 68 DOTANOC Positron Emission Tomography Correlation.', 'Cutaneous metastasis of castration-resistant prostate cancer: A rare case report and review of literature.', 'A Case of Prostatic Carcinoma Manifesting as Cutaneous Facial Nodule.', 'Distinct genetic alterations in small cell carcinoma from different anatomic sites.']"""

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of the transition to androgen independence prostate cancer is critical to identify new ways to treat older patients who are ineligible for conventional chemotherapy.  Methods:   The effects of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) on the viability and the apoptosis of the androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC3) cell lines were examined by MTS assay and western blot analysis for the activation of caspase-3. The subcutaneous LNCaP xenografts were established in a nude mice model. MiR-146a and DNMTs expressions were analyzed by qRT-PCR and DNA methylation rates of LINE-1 were measured by COBRA-IRS to determine the global DNA methylation levels. The methylation levels of miR-146a promoter region in the different groups were quantified by the bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) assay.  Results:   We validated that 5-Aza-CdR induced cell death and increased miR-146a expression in both LNCaP and PC3 cells. Notably, the expression of miR-146a in LNCaP cells was much higher than in PC3 cells. MiR-146a inhibitor was shown to suppress apoptosis in 5-Aza-CdR-treated cells. In a castrate mouse LNCaP xenograft model, 5-Aza-CdR significantly suppressed the tumors growth and also inhibited prostate cancer progression. Meanwhile, miR-146a expression was significantly enhanced in the tumor xenografts of 5-Aza-CdR-treated mice and the androgen-dependent but not the androgen-independent stage of castrated mice. In particular, the expression of miR-146a was significantly augmented in both stages of the combined treatment (castration and 5-Aza-CdR). Additionally, the methylation percentage of the two CpG sites (-444 bp and -433 bp), which were around the NF-κB binding site at miR-146a promoter, showed the lowest methylation levels among all CpG sites in the combined treatment tumors of both stages.  Conclusion:   Up-regulating miR-146a expression via the hypomethylation of the miR-146a promoter by 5-Aza-CdR was correlated with delayed progression of castration-resistant prostate cancers. Moreover, site-specific DNA methylation may play an important role in miR-146a expression in androgen-dependent prostate cancer progression to androgen-independent prostate cancer and therefore provides a potentially useful biomarker for assessing drug efficacy in prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaolu Wang', 'Haitao Gao', 'Lixin Ren', 'Junfei Gu', 'Yanping Zhang', 'Yong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Effect of histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors on the expression of the androgen receptor gene in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Emodin enhances the demethylation by 5-Aza-CdR of pancreatic cancer cell tumor-suppressor genes P16, RASSF1A and ppENK.', ""GSTP1 DNA methylation and expression status is indicative of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine efficacy in human prostate cancer cells."", ""Antineoplastic activity of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in anaplastic large cell lymphoma."", 'Adenosine Kinase on Deoxyribonucleic Acid Methylation: Adenosine Receptor-Independent Pathway in Cancer Therapy.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Pathogenesis of Colorectal Cancer: Impact of Oncogenic Targets Regulated by Tumor Suppressive miR-139-3p.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'The clinical significance of circulating miR-21, miR-142, miR-143, and miR-146a in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Genome‑wide DNA hypomethylation drives a more invasive pancreatic cancer phenotype and has predictive occult distant metastasis and prognosis potential.']"""

Metastasis models can reveal insights in tumor development and progression and provide tools to test new intervention strategies.  Methods:   To develop a new cancer metastasis model, we used DU145 human prostate cancer cells and performed repeated rounds of orthotopic prostate injection and selection of subsequent lymph node metastases. Tumor growth, metastasis, cell migration and invasion were analyzed. Microarray analysis was used to identify cell migration- and cancer-related genes correlating with metastasis. Selected genes were silenced using siRNA, and their roles in cell migration and invasion were determined in transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assays.  Results:   Our in vivo cycling strategy created cell lines with dramatically increased tumorigenesis and increased ability to colonize lymph nodes (DU145LN1-LN4). Prostate tumor xenografts displayed increased vascularization, enlarged podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessels and invasive margins. Microarray analysis revealed gene expression profiles that correlated with metastatic potential. Using gene network analysis we selected 3 significantly upregulated cell movement and cancer related genes for further analysis: EPCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule), ITGB4 (integrin β4) and PLAU (urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)). These genes all showed increased protein expression in the more metastatic DU145-LN4 cells compared to the parental DU145. SiRNA knockdown of EpCAM, integrin-β4 or uPA all significantly reduced cell migration in DU145-LN4 cells. In contrast, only uPA siRNA inhibited cell invasion into Matrigel. This role of uPA in cell invasion was confirmed using the uPA inhibitors, amiloride and UK122.

Methods and materials:   Between 1993 and 2007, we retrospectively analyzed 56 consecutively patients (pts) undergoing salvage brachytherapy. After local biopsy-proven recurrence, pts received 145 Gy LDR-BT (37 pts, 66%) or HDR-BT (19 pts, 34%) in different dose levels according to biological equivalent doses (BED(2 Gy)). By the time of salvage BT, only 15 pts (27%) received ADT. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of biochemical control and toxicities. Acute and late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCv3.0).  Results:   Median follow-up after salvage BT was 48 months. The 5-year FFbF was 77%. HDR and LDR late grade 3 GU toxicities were observed in 21% and 24%. Late grade 3 GI toxicities were observed in 2% (HDR) and 2.7% (LDR). On univariate analysis, pre-salvage prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 10 ng/ml (p = 0.004), interval to relapse after initial treatment < 24 months (p = 0.004) and salvage HDR-BT doses BED(2 Gy) level < 227 Gy (p = 0.012) were significant in predicting biochemical failure. On Cox multivariate analysis, pre-salvage PSA, and time to relapse were significant in predicting biochemical failure.

A data driven, multivariate approach, was used in this study to predict prostate cancer cell survival based on the phosphorylation levels of key proteins in PC3, LNCaP, and MDA-PCa-2b cell lines in response to EGF, IGF1, IL6, TNFα, dihydrotestosterone, and docetaxel treatment.  Methods:   The prostate cancer cell lines were treated with ligands or inhibitors, cell lyates were collected, and the amount of phosphoprotein quantified using 384 well ELISA assays. In separate experiments, relative cell viability was determined using an MTT assay. Normalized data was imported into Matlab where regression analysis was performed.  Results:   Based on a linear model developed using partial least squares regression, p-Erk1/2 was found to correlate with castration resistant survival along with p-RPS6, and this model was determined to have a leave-one-out cross validated R2 value of 0.61. The effect of androgen on the phosphoproteome was examined, and increases in PI3K related phosphoproteins (p-Akt, p-RPS6, and p-GSK3) were observed which accounted for the majority of the significant increase in androgen-mediated cell survival. Simultaneous inhibition of the PI3K pathway and treatment with androgen resulted in a non-significant increase in survival. Given the strong effect of PI3K related signaling in enabling castration resistant survival, the specific effect of mTor versus complete inhibition was examined using targeted inhibitors. It was determine that mTor inhibition accounts for 52% of the effect of complete PI3K inhibition on cell survival. The differences in signaling between the cell lines were explored it was observed that MDA-PCa-2b exhibited far less activation of p-Erk in response to varying treatments, explaining one of the reasons for the lack of castration resistance.  Conclusion:   In this work, regression analysis to the phosphoproteome was used to illustrate the sources of castration resistance between the cell lines including reduced p-Erk signaling in MDA-PCa-2b and variations in p-JNK across the cell lines, as well as studying the signaling pathways which androgen acts through, and determining the response to treatment with targeted inhibitors.""","""['Reynald M Lescarbeau', 'David L Kaplan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Combined AKT and MEK Pathway Blockade in Pre-Clinical Models of Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Reciprocal feedback inhibition of the androgen receptor and PI3K as a novel therapy for castrate-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of cabazitaxel-resistant mechanism in human castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Drug Repurposing of Pantoprazole and Vitamin C Targeting Tumor Microenvironment Conditions Improves Anticancer Effect in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrative proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling of prostate cell lines.', 'Logic Modeling in Quantitative Systems Pharmacology.', 'Network analysis of an in vitro model of androgen-resistance in prostate cancer.']"""

MRI is an accurate diagnostic tool for AZ tumors, but is often unavailable due to cost or system restrictions. We examined the diagnostic yield of office based AZ TRUS-Pbx.  Methods:   127 men at risk for AZ tumors were studied: Patients with elevated PSA and previous extended negative TRUS-Pbx (group 1, n = 78) and actively surveyed low risk prostate cancer patients (group 2, n = 49). None of the participants had a previous AZ biopsy. Biopsy template included suspicious ultrasonic areas, 16 peripheral zone (PZ), 4 transitional zone (TZ) and 6 AZ cores. All biopsies were performed by a single urologist under local peri-prostatic anaesthetic, using the B-K Medical US System, an end-firing probe 4-12 MHZ and 18 ga/25 cm needle. All samples were reviewed by a single specialized uro-pathologist. Multivariate analysis was used to detect predictors for AZ tumors accounting for age, PSA, PSA density, prostate volume, BMI, and number of previous biopsies.  Results:   Median PSA was 10.4 (group 1) and 7.3 (group 2). Age (63.9, 64.5), number of previous biopsies (1.5) and cores (17.8, 21.3) and prostate volume (56.4 cc, 51 cc) were similar for both groups. The overall diagnostic yield was 34.6% (group 1) and 85.7% (group 2). AZ cancers were detected in 21.8% (group 1) and 34.7% (group 2) but were rarely the only zone involved (1.3% and 4.1% respectively). Gleason ≥ 7 AZ cancers were often accompanied by equal grade PZ tumors. In multivariate analysis only prostate volume predicted for AZ tumors. Patients detected with AZ tumors had significantly smaller prostates (36.9 cc vs. 61.1 cc p < 0.001). Suspicious AZ ultrasonic findings were uncommon (6.3%).  Conclusions:   TRUS-Pbx AZ sampling rarely improves the diagnostic yield of extended PZ sampling in patients with elevated PSA and previous negative biopsies.

Such challenges are epitomized by neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NED) and the emergence of neuroendocrine-like cancer cells in prostate tumors. This phenomenon frequently arises from androgen-depleted prostate adenocarcinoma and is associated with the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer and poor prognosis.  Results:   In this study, we showed that NED was evoked in both androgen receptor (AR)-positive and AR-negative prostate epithelial cell lines by growing the cells to a high density. Androgen depletion and high-density cultivation were both associated with cell cycle arrest and deregulated expression of several cell cycle regulators, such as p27Kip1, members of the cyclin D protein family, and Cdk2. Dual inhibition of Cdk1 and Cdk2 using pharmacological inhibitor or RNAi led to modulation of the cell cycle and promotion of NED. We further demonstrated that the cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated pathway is activated in the high-density conditions. Importantly, inhibition of cAMP signaling using a specific inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, MDL-12330A, abolished the promotion of NED by high cell density.

Population-based cancer registries are also not common in developing countries despite the usefulness of such registries in informing cancer prevention and control programmes. The availability of population-based data on cancers in Africa varies across different countries. In Ghana, data and research on cancer have focussed on specific cancers and have been hospital-based with no reference population. The Kumasi Cancer Registry was established as the first population-based cancer registry in Ghana in 2012 to provide information on cancer cases seen in the city of Kumasi.  Methods:   This paper reviews data from the Kumasi Cancer Registry for the year 2012. The reference geographic area for the registry is the city of Kumasi as designated by the 2010 Ghana Population and Housing Census. Data was from all clinical departments of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Pathology Laboratory Results, Death Certificates and the Kumasi South Regional Hospital. Data was abstracted and entered into Canreg 5 database. Analysis was conducted using Canreg 5, Microsoft Excel and Epi Info Version 7.1.2.0.  Results:   The majority of cancers were recorded among females accounting for 69.6% of all cases. The mean age at diagnosis for all cases was 51.6 years. Among males, the mean age at diagnosis was 48.4 compared with 53.0 years for females. The commonest cancers among males were cancers of the Liver (21.1%), Prostate (13.2%), Lung (5.3%) and Stomach (5.3%). Among females, the commonest cancers were cancers of the Breast (33.9%), Cervix (29.4%), Ovary (11.3%) and Endometrium (4.5%). Histology of the primary tumour was the basis of diagnosis in 74% of cases with clinical and other investigations accounting for 17% and 9% respectively. The estimated cancer incidence Age Adjusted Standardised Rate for males was 10.9/100,000 and 22.4/100, 000 for females.

Although tumor microenvironment has been shown to have a significant impact on the initiation and/or promotion of metastasis, the mechanism remains elusive. We previously reported that HCT-8 colon cancer cells underwent a phenotypic transition from an adhesive epithelial type (E-cell) to a rounded dissociated type (R-cell) via soft substrate culture, which resembled the initiation of metastasis. The objective of current study was to investigate the molecular and metabolic mechanisms of the E-R transition.  Methods:   Global gene expressions of HCT-8 E and R cells were measured by RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq); and the results were further confirmed by real-time PCR. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), anoikis resistance, enzyme activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family, member A1 (ALDH3A1), and in vitro invasion assay were tested on both E and R cells. The deformability of HCT-8 E and R cells was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). To study the in vivo invasiveness of two cell types, athymic nude mice were intra-splenically injected with HCT-8 E or R cells and sacrificed after 9 weeks. Incidences of tumor development and metastasis were histologically evaluated and analyzed with Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Besides HCT-8, E-R transition on soft substrates was also seen in three other cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480 colon and DU145 prostate cancer). The expression of some genes, such as ALDH3A1, TNS4, CLDN2, and AKR1B10, which are known to play important roles in cancer cell migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis, were increased in HCT-8 R cells. R cells also showed higher ALDH3A1 enzyme activity, higher ROS, higher anoikis resistance, and higher softness than E cells. More importantly, in vitro assay and in vivo animal models revealed that HCT-8 R cells were more invasive than E cells.  Conclusions:   Our comprehensive comparison of HCT-8 E and R cells revealed differences of molecular, phenotypical, and mechanical signatures between the two cell types.

For the proposed assay method, the working electrode is modified with the peptide probes for the target proteases. These probes contain the substrate sequence of target proteases, as well as the seed peptide sequence that can accelerate the misfolding of amyloid-beta. If there are proteases in the test solution, after protease cleavage of the substrate peptides, the distal seed peptide will be removed from the electrode surface. So, in the absence of proteases, the seed peptides can initiate and accelerate amyloid-beta misfolding on the electrode surface. Consequently, the formed aggregates strongly block the electron transfer of the in-solution electroactive species with the electrode, resulting in suppressed signal readout. Nevertheless, in the presence of proteases, enzyme cleavage may lead to greatly mitigated protein misfolding and evident signal enhancement. Since the contrast in signal readout between the two cases can be amplified by using the protein misfolding step, high sensitivity suitable for direct detection of proteases in serum can be achieved. These results may suggest the feasibility of our new method for the detection of a panel of proteases in offering detailed diagnosis of prostate cancer and a better treatment of the cancer.""","""['Hao Li', 'Yue Huang', 'Bin Zhang', 'Dawei Yang', 'Xiaoli Zhu', 'Genxi Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['A four-kallikrein panel predicts prostate cancer in men with recent screening: data from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam.', 'Precursor isoform of prostate-specific antigen and human kallikrein 2: two new promising biomarkers for the unsolved challenge of early prostate cancer detection.', 'PSA and hK2 in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific kallikrein-related peptidases and their relation to prostate cancer biology and detection.

ADT is the standard of care for non-organ confined prostate cancer and inhibits action of androgen receptor (AR), which is necessary for the growth of prostate cancer. ADT blocks AR activity by preventing either production of its ligands or interaction between AR and its ligands. Following an initial remission, almost all patients experience prostate cancer recurrence during ADT. Remarkably, prostate cancer that reemerges remains dependent on AR. This recognition has led to the recent development of novel treatment strategies that focus on alternative means to target ligand production and availability for AR. These therapies induce remission and offer moderate survival benefits but none are curative while all are associated with significant side effects. We propose that an alternative tactic to achieve the beneficial effects of ADT could be explored by targeting a different step in the AR signaling cascade, namely the biological consequences of AR activation. Insights in molecular regulation of AR function and genome-wide AR action could be used to develop therapeutic interventions that focus on eliminating only distinct AR-dependent biological processes responsible for aggressive prostate cancer cell behavior. Such selective forms of ADT could be used alone or in combination with existing therapies to improve prostate cancer therapeutic outcome in a stage-specific and personalized manner.""","""['May Elbanna', 'Hannelore V Heemers']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Discov Med""","""['Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Differential androgen receptor signals in different cells explain why androgen-deprivation therapy of prostate cancer fails.', 'The importance of non-nuclear AR signaling in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic resistance.', 'Androgen receptor as a therapeutic target.', 'Regulators of Androgen Action Resource: a one-stop shop for the comprehensive study of androgen receptor action.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate enzalutamide's effects on cancer and on androgens in blood and bone marrow, and associate these with clinical observations.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this prospective phase 2 study, 60 patients with bone mCRPC received enzalutamide 160mg orally daily and had transilial bone marrow biopsies before treatment and at 8 wk of treatment.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Androgen signaling components (androgen receptor [AR], AR splice variant 7 (ARV7), v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog [ERG], cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 [CYP17]) and molecules implicated in mCRPC progression (phospho-Met, phospho-Src, glucocorticoid receptor, Ki67) were assessed by immunohistochemistry; testosterone, cortisol, and androstenedione concentrations were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; AR copy number was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Descriptive statistics were applied.  Results and limitations:   Median time to treatment discontinuation was 22 wk (95% confidence interval, 19.9-29.6). Twenty-two (37%) patients exhibited primary resistance to enzalutamide, discontinuing treatment within 4 mo. Maximal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% occurred in 27 (45%) and 13 (22%) patients, respectively. Following 8 wk of treatment, bone marrow and circulating testosterone levels increased. Pretreatment tumor nuclear AR overexpression (> 75%) and CYP17 (> 10%) expression were associated with benefit (p = 0.018). AR subcellular localization shift from the nucleus was confirmed in eight paired samples (with PSA decline) of 23 evaluable paired samples. Presence of an ARV7 variant was associated with primary resistance to enzalutamide (p = 0.018). Limited patient numbers warrant further validation.  Conclusions:   The observed subcellular shift of AR from the nucleus and increased testosterone concentration provide the first evidence in humans that enzalutamide suppresses AR signaling while inducing an adaptive feedback. Persistent androgen signaling in mCRPC was predictive of benefit and ARV7 was associated with primary resistance.  Patient summary:   We report a first bone biopsy study in metastatic prostate cancer in humans that searched for predictors of outcome of enzalutamide therapy. Benefit is linked to a pretreatment androgen-signaling signature.

Objective:   The relationship between the number of removed lymph nodes (RLNs) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) was tested in patients with LNI.  Design, setting, and participants:   We examined data of 315 pN1 PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) and anatomically ePLND between 2000 and 2012 at one tertiary care centre. All patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy with or without adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the relationship between RLN number and CSM rate, after adjusting to all available covariates. Survival estimates were based on the multivariable model; patients were stratified according to RLN number using points of maximum separation.  Results and limitations:   The average number of RLNs was 20.8 (median: 19; interquartile range: 14-25). Mean and median follow-up were 63.1 and 54 mo, respectively. At 10-yr, the CSM-free survival rate was 74.7%, 85.9%, 92.4%, 96.0%, and 97.9% for patients with 8, 17, 26, 36, and 45 RLNs, respectively. By multivariable analyses, the number of RLNs independently predicted lower CSM rate (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.93; p=0.02). Other predictors of CSM were Gleason score 8-10 (HR: 3.3), number of positive nodes (HR: 1.2), and aRT treatment (HR: 0.26; all p ≤ 0.006). The study is limited by its retrospective nature.  Conclusions:   In PCa patients with LNI, the removal of a higher number of LNs during RP was associated with improvement in cancer-specific survival rate. This implies that ePLND should be considered in all patients with a significant preoperative risk of harbouring LNI.

Although MDSCs are known to suppress immune surveillance, their roles in directly stimulating cancer cell proliferation and metastasis currently remain unclear. Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency causes systemic expansion and infiltration of MDSCs in multiple organs and subsequent inflammation. In the LAL-deficient (lal(-/-)) mouse model, melanoma metastasized massively in allogeneic lal(-/-) mice, which was suppressed in allogeneic lal(+/+) mice owing to immune rejection. Here we report for the first time that MDSCs from lal(-/-) mice directly stimulated B16 melanoma cell in vitro proliferation and in vivo growth and metastasis. Cytokines, that is, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α from MDSCs are required for B16 melanoma cell proliferation in vitro. Myeloid-specific expression of human LAL (hLAL) in lal(-/-) mice rescues these malignant phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. The tumor-promoting function of lal(-/-) MDSCs is mediated, at least in part, through overactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Knockdown of mTOR, Raptor or Rictor in lal(-/-) MDSCs suppressed their stimulation on proliferation of cancer cells, including B16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma and transgenic mouse prostate cancer-C2 cancer cells. Our results indicate that LAL has a critical role in regulating MDSCs' ability to directly stimulate cancer cell proliferation and overcome immune rejection of cancer metastasis in allogeneic mice through modulation of the mTOR pathway, which provides a mechanistic basis for targeting MDSCs to reduce the risk of cancer metastasis. Therefore MDSCs possess dual functions to facilitate cancer metastasis: suppress immune surveillance and stimulate cancer cell proliferation and growth.""","""['T Zhao', 'H Du', 'X Ding', 'K Walls', 'C Yan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Critical role of PPARγ in myeloid-derived suppressor cell-stimulated cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.', 'Endothelial Rab7 GTPase mediates tumor growth and metastasis in lysosomal acid lipase-deficient mice.', 'Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are involved in lysosomal acid lipase deficiency-induced endothelial cell dysfunctions.', 'Lysosomal acid lipase in mesenchymal stem cell stimulation of tumor growth and metastasis.', 'Critical role of the mTOR pathway in development and function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in lal-/- mice.', 'Tumor metabolism rewiring in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Pathogenesis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Interplay of Apoptosis and Autophagy.', 'Lipophagy-mediated cholesterol synthesis inhibition is required for the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma under glutamine deprivation.', 'Emerging role of lipophagy in liver disorders.', 'LAL deficiency induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells as targets and biomarkers for lung cancer.']"""

In addition, LOX has complex roles in cancer in which the lysyl oxidase propeptide (LOX-PP) domain of secreted pro-LOX has tumor-suppressor activity, while the active enzyme promotes metastasis. In prostate cancer cell lines, recombinant LOX-PP (rLOX-PP) inhibits the growth of PC3 cells in vitro by mechanisms that were not characterized, while in DU145 cells rLOX-PP targeted fibroblast growth factor signaling. Because rLOX-PP can enhance effects of a genotoxic chemotherapeutic on breast cancer cell apoptosis, we reasoned that rLOX-PP could target DNA repair pathways typically elevated in cancer. Here we demonstrate for the first time that rLOX-PP inhibits prostate xenograft growth in vivo and that activating phosphorylations of the key DNA repair molecules ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) are inhibited by rLOX-PP expression in vivo. In addition, in vitro studies showed that rLOX-PP inhibits radiation-induced activating phosphorylations of ATM and CHK2 and that exogenously added rLOX-PP protein can localize to the nucleus in both DU145 and PC3 cells. rLOX-PP pull-down studies resulted in detection of a protein complex with the nuclear DNA repair regulator MRE11 in both cell lines, and rLOX-PP localized to radiation-induced nuclear DNA repair foci. Finally, rLOX-PP was shown to sensitize both DU145 and PC3 cells to radiation-induced cell death determined in colony-formation assays. These data provide evidence that rLOX-PP has a nuclear mechanism of action in which it directly interacts with DNA repair proteins to sensitize prostate cancer cells to the effects of ionizing radiation.""","""['M V Bais', 'G B Ozdener', 'G E Sonenshein', 'P C Trackman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Lysyl oxidase propeptide stimulates osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and enhances PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell effects on bone in vivo.', 'Recombinant lysyl oxidase propeptide protein inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis of pre-existing murine breast cancer xenografts.', 'Determination of cell uptake pathways for tumor inhibitor lysyl oxidase propeptide.', 'Lysyl oxidase propeptide inhibits prostate cancer cell growth by mechanisms that target FGF-2-cell binding and signaling.', 'Functions and Mechanisms of Pro-Lysyl Oxidase Processing in Cancers and Eye Pathologies with a Focus on Diabetic Retinopathy.', 'Mechanistic insight into lysyl oxidase in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis.', 'Glioblastoma-educated mesenchymal stem-like cells promote glioblastoma infiltration via extracellular matrix remodelling in the tumour microenvironment.', 'Context Matters: Response Heterogeneity to Collagen-Targeting Approaches in Desmoplastic Cancers.', 'Inhibition of LSD1 Attenuates Oral Cancer Development and Promotes Therapeutic Efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Blockade and YAP/TAZ Inhibition.', 'Urinary glycoproteins associated with aggressive prostate cancer.']"""

Design, setting and participants:   Retrospective population-based survival analysis of 68 686 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from January 1982 to December 2007 in New South Wales.  Main outcome measures:   Survival rate and relative excess risk (RER) of death over 10 years of follow-up in relation to geographic remoteness after adjusting for other prognostic factors.  Results:   Overall, 10-year survival increased during the study period, increasing from 57.5% in 1992-1996 and 75.7% in 1997-2001 to 83.7% in 2002-2007. The increasing trends were also observed across categories of geographic remoteness and socioeconomic status. Urban-rural differentials were significant (P < 0.001) after adjusting for five important prognostic factors, with men living outside major cities having higher risk of death from prostate cancer (RER, 1.18 and 1.32 for inner regional and rural areas, respectively). Socioeconomic status was also a significant factor (P < 0.001) for prostate cancer mortality, with the risk of dying being 34% to 40% higher for men living in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas than those living in least disadvantaged areas. There was no evidence that this inequality is reducing over time, particularly for men living in inner regional areas.  Conclusions:   Despite the increasing awareness of urban-rural differentials in cancer outcomes, little progress has been made.

Material and methods:   Patients were identified from databases of radical prostatectomy between 1996 and 2011 from a single UK centre. Information was obtained on demographics, prostate-specific antigen, staging, biopsy and specimen histopathology, and follow-up. Data were inputted into the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), Partin 1997 and Makarov/Partin 2007 nomograms, and the University of California San Francisco-Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment tool (UCSF-CAPRA). The risks of extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and lymph-node involvement (LNI) were calculated and compared with known outcomes. Nomogram performance was measured using Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit tests, calculating concordance indices (c-indices) and calibration curves.  Results:   Data were obtained for 541 patients. Prediction of ECE was relatively poor using all nomograms, with the Makarov/Partin 2007 the most accurate at prediction over the range of risk stratification (HL 9.9, c-index 0.62). Predictions of SVI and LNI were better than for ECE, with the MSKCC nomogram performing best for SVI (HL 10.9, c-index 0.73) and all nomograms performing well for LNI prediction (c-indices 0.8 to 0.815). CAPRA predicted best for SVI (OR 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.27-1.74).  Conclusions:   To the authors' knowledge, this is the first head-to-head comparison of the accuracy of these commonly used risk calculators in a North European population.

One possibility is that this association may depend on other biological factors. This study examined the relationship between stressful life events (LE) and sex hormones in men, and whether cortisol is involved in this relationship. From a total number of 2906 men who completed a screening for the early detection of prostate cancer, 139 healthy men (mean ± SD age, 57.8 ± 5.7 years) were included in this study. Participants were assessed with the Holmes and Rahe questionnaire in relation to their experience of LE during the previous 1-5 years. Salivary and serum cortisol was measured at 08:00-09:00 h, as well as luteinizing hormone (LH), total testosterone, epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE). LE weight sum and LE number positively correlated with LH (r = 0.293, p = 0.004; r = 0.220, p = 0.031, respectively). In a multiple regression analysis, LE-sum explained an additional and significant 10.4% of the variance in LH levels, after statistically controlling for the effects of age, waist circumference (WC) and BMI (F(1,90) = 6.61, p < 0.05). Importantly, cortisol interacted with LE in relation to total testosterone. In men with high cortisol values (≥15.4 µg/dl), there was a statistically significant positive relationship between LE number and total testosterone levels (p = 0.05), while LE were unrelated to total testosterone in men with low cortisol. LE correlated with sex hormones, predicting LH values, and in men with high cortisol levels shows a possible moderator effect of cortisol on the relationship between LE and total testosterone.""","""['Bibiana Fabre', 'Nahuel Fernandez Machulsky', 'Halina Grosman', 'Diego Gonzalez', 'Adriana Oneto', 'Esteban M Repetto', 'Viviana Mesch', 'Carlos Nolazco', 'Osvaldo Mazza', 'Yori Gidron', 'Gabriela Berg']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Stress""","""['Relationship between cortisol, life events and metabolic syndrome in men.', 'Body mass index in relation to semen quality and reproductive hormones in New Zealand men: a cross-sectional study in fertility clinics.', 'Hormonal predictors of prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of serum levels resistin in girls with anorexia nervosa.

The objective of this analysis was to further our knowledge of the relationships between dyadic coping, anxiety, depression, and relationship satisfaction among couples facing prostate cancer.  Methods:   Forty-two men recently diagnosed with prostate cancer recruited from urology clinics and their spouses completed measures of dyadic coping, anxiety, depression, and relationship satisfaction. The Actor-Partner Interdependence Model was used to examine the relationships among these concepts.  Results:   Relationship satisfaction was significantly associated with patients' and wives' use of positive and negative dyadic coping, and their partners' use of these strategies. Although patients' and wives' use of supportive dyadic coping was not associated with their anxiety and depression, their partner's use of this strategy was associated with anxiety and depression. Only husbands' and wives' perceptions of their partner's negative dyadic coping was associated with anxiety and depression.

Patients and methods:   In collaboration with pharmaceutical companies and academia, an European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-led initiative, Dose-Limiting Toxicity and Toxicity Assessment Recommendation Group for Early Trials of Targeted therapies (DLT-TARGETT), collected data from completed phase 1 trials evaluating MTAs as monotherapy. All toxicities at least possibly related to the study drugs that occurred during C1-6, their type, grade (CTCAEv3.0), and duration as well as patients' relative dose-intensity (RDI), were recorded.  Results:   The 54 eligible trials enrolled 2084 evaluable adult patients with solid tumours between 1999 and 2013, and evaluated small molecules (40), antibodies (seven), recombinant peptides (five) and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (two). A maximum tolerated dose was set in 43 trials. Fifteen percent of the patients received <75% of the intended RDI in C1, but only 9.1% of them presented protocol-defined DLTs. After C1, 16-19% of patients received <75% of the intended RDI. A similar proportion of G ⩾ 3 toxicities was recorded in C1 and after C1 (936 and 1087 toxicities, respectively), with the first G⩾3 toxicity occurring after C1 in 18.6% of patients.  Conclusion:   Although protocol-defined DLT period is traditionally limited to C1, almost 20% of patients present significant reductions in RDI at any time in phase 1 trials of MTAs. Recommended phase 2 dose assessment should incorporate all available information from any cycle (notably lower grade toxicities leading to such RDI decrease), and be based on achieving >75% RDI.""","""['Sophie Postel-Vinay', 'Laurence Collette', 'Xavier Paoletti', 'Elisa Rizzo', 'Christophe Massard', 'David Olmos', 'Camilla Fowst', 'Bernard Levy', 'Pierre Mancini', 'Denis Lacombe', 'Percy Ivy', 'Lesley Seymour', 'Christophe Le Tourneau', 'Lillian L Siu', 'Stan B Kaye', 'Jaap Verweij', 'Jean-Charles Soria']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['An (only) partially established paradigm of drug development of targeted therapies.', 'Defining dose-limiting toxicity for phase 1 trials of molecularly targeted agents: results of a DLT-TARGETT international survey.', 'Revisiting the definition of dose-limiting toxicities in paediatric oncology phase I clinical trials: An analysis from the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer Consortium.', 'Heterogeneity in the definition of dose-limiting toxicity in phase I cancer clinical trials of molecularly targeted agents: a review of the literature.', 'Towards using a full spectrum of early clinical trial data: a retrospective analysis to compare potential longitudinal categorical models for molecular targeted therapies in oncology.', 'A review of dose-limiting events in phase I trials: antimetabolites show unpredictable relationships between dose and toxicity.', 'Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in the Treatment of Advanced Renal Cancer.', 'Challenges, opportunities, and innovative statistical designs for precision oncology trials.', 'Surv-CRM-12: A Bayesian phase I/II survival CRM for right-censored toxicity endpoints with competing disease progression.', ""Intracerebroventricular injection of human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells in patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia: a phase I clinical trial."", 'Seamless phase I/II design for novel anticancer agents with competing disease progression.']"""

Methods and materials:   A number of problems have to be solved to make focal dose escalation (FDE) efficient and safe: (1) how to combine ambiguous information from multiple imaging modalities; (2) how to take into account uncertainties of FI based tissue classification; (3) how to account for geometric uncertainties in treatment delivery; (4) how to add complementary FI modalities to an existing scheme. A generic optimisation concept addresses these points and is explicitly designed for clinical efficacy and for lowering the implementation threshold to FI-guided FDE. It combines classic tumour control probability modelling with a multi-variate logistic regression model of FI accuracy and an uncomplicated robust optimisation method.  Results:   Its key elements are (1) that dose is deposited optimally when it achieves equivalent expected effect everywhere in the target volume and (2) that one needs to cap the certainty about the absence of tumour anywhere in the target region. For illustration, an example of a PET/MR-guided FDE in prostate cancer is given.

Although cancer is one of the main causes of death in diabetic patients, few reports describe the anticancer effects of incretin. Here, we examined the effect of the incretin drug exendin (Ex)-4, a GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, on prostate cancer. In human prostate cancer tissue obtained from patients after they had undergone radical prostatectomy, GLP-1R expression colocalized with P504S, a marker of prostate cancer. In in vitro experiments, Ex-4 significantly decreased the proliferation of the prostate cancer cell lines LNCap, PC3, and DU145, but not that of ALVA-41. This antiproliferative effect depended on GLP-1R expression. In accordance with the abundant expression of GLP-1R in LNCap cells, a GLP-1R antagonist or GLP-1R knockdown with small interfering RNA abolished the inhibitory effect of Ex-4 on cell proliferation. Although Ex-4 had no effect on either androgen receptor activation or apoptosis, it decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in LNCap cells. Importantly, Ex-4 attenuated in vivo prostate cancer growth induced by transplantation of LNCap cells into athymic mice and significantly reduced the tumor expression of P504S, Ki67, and phosphorylated ERK-MAPK.

However, nucleic acids extracted from FFPE tissues are fragmented and chemically modified making them challenging to use in molecular studies. We analysed 23 fresh-frozen (FF), 35 FFPE and 38 paired FF/FFPE specimens, representing six different human tissue types (bladder, prostate and colon carcinoma; liver and colon normal tissue; reactive tonsil) in order to examine the potential use of FFPE samples in next-generation sequencing (NGS) based retrospective and prospective clinical studies. Two methods for DNA and three methods for RNA extraction from FFPE tissues were compared and were found to affect nucleic acid quantity and quality. DNA and RNA from selected FFPE and paired FF/FFPE specimens were used for exome and transcriptome analysis. Preparations of DNA Exome-Seq libraries was more challenging (29.5% success) than that of RNA-Seq libraries, presumably because of modifications to FFPE tissue-derived DNA. Libraries could still be prepared from RNA isolated from two-decade old FFPE tissues. Data were analysed using the CLC Bio Genomics Workbench and revealed systematic differences between FF and FFPE tissue-derived nucleic acid libraries. In spite of this, pairwise analysis of DNA Exome-Seq data showed concordance for 70-80% of variants in FF and FFPE samples stored for fewer than three years. RNA-Seq data showed high correlation of expression profiles in FF/FFPE pairs (Pearson Correlations of 0.90 +/- 0.05), irrespective of storage time (up to 244 months) and tissue type. A common set of 1,494 genes was identified with expression profiles that were significantly different between paired FF and FFPE samples irrespective of tissue type.

Objectives:   To develop methodology for creating detailed, 3-dimensional, prostate cancer maps (3DPCM) of tumor location, extra prostatic extension sites, and positive margins and to assess the adequacy of current clinical target volumes for postoperative radiotherapy to the prostate using 3DPCM coregistered with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging.  Design:   Parallel slices of prostatectomy specimens were created with ProCUT, and 2-dimensional cancer maps were generated as line diagrams after microscopic examination of each slice. The 2-dimensional cancer maps were aligned and stacked to create a 3DPCM, which was coregistered with the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan. The map was exported to the radiotherapy planning system and was used to determine the areas at greater risk, which were then compared against the current Radiation Therapy Oncology Group guidelines for contouring postoperative clinical target volumes to assess the adequacy of coverage.  Results:   Twenty-eight patients with a mean age of 66 years (range, 52-73) underwent radical prostatectomy and postoperative radiotherapy. Seventeen patients (61%) received adjuvant radiotherapy for pT3 disease and/or positive margins, and the rest underwent salvage radiotherapy. Thirty-nine percent (11 of 28) of the patients had Gleason scores of 8 or 9. The contours based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group guidelines for postoperative radiotherapy resulted in inadequate coverage of extraprostatic extensions in 79% (22 of 28) and positive margins in 64% (18 of 28) of the cases.  Conclusions:   We have developed a methodology for creation of 3DPCM. Modification of the radiotherapy contours, based on the 3DPCM coregistered with pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging, covers the areas at high risk of recurrence.

The method is based on correlations between the EPID signal and the dose on the beam central axis. Moreover, the γ-analysis of EPID images was adopted to verify off-axis reproducibility of fractionated plan delivery.  Methods:   An algorithm to reconstruct in vivo the isocenter dose, D(iso), for RapidArc treatments has been developed. 20 VMAT plans, optimized with two opposite arcs, for prostate, pancreas, and head treatments have been delivered by a Varian linac both to a conic PMMA phantom with elliptical section and to patients. The ratios R between reconstructed D(iso) and the planned doses were determined for phantom and patient irradiations adopting an acceptance criterion of ±5%. In total, 40 phantom checks and 400 patient checks were analyzed. Moreover, 3% and 3 mm criteria were adopted for portal image γ-analysis to assess patient irradiation reproducibility.  Results:   The average ratio R, between reconstructed and planned doses for the PMMA phantom irradiations was equal to 1.007 ± 0.024. When the IVD method was applied to the 20 patients, the average R ratio was equal to 1.003 ± 0.017 and 96% of the tests were within the acceptance criteria. The portal image γ-analysis supplied 88% of the tests within the pass rates γ(mean) ≤ 0.4 and P(γ<1) ≥ 98%. All the warnings were understood comparing the CT and the cone beam CT images and in one case a patient's setup error was detected and corrected for the successive fractions.

To correct for inter- and intrafraction anatomical variations, fast and easy to implement methods are needed. Here, the authors propose a full dosimetric IMRT correction that finds a compromise in-between basic repositioning (the current clinical practice) and full replanning. It simplifies replanning by avoiding a recontouring step and a full dose calculation. It surpasses repositioning by updating the preoptimized fluence and monitor units (MU) using a limited number of fiducial points and a pretreatment (CB)CT. To adapt the fluence the fiducial points were projected in the beam's eye view (BEV). To adapt the MUs, point dose calculation towards the same fiducial points were performed. The proposed method is intrinsically fast and robust, and simple to understand for operators, because of the use of only four fiducial points and the beam data based point dose calculations.  Methods:   To perform our dosimetric adaptation, two fluence corrections in the BEV are combined with two MU correction steps along the beam's path. (1) A transformation of the fluence map such that it is realigned with the current target geometry. (2) A correction for an unintended scaling of the penumbra margin when the treatment beams scale to the current target size. (3) A correction for the target depth relative to the body contour and (4) a correction for the target distance to the source. The impact of the correction strategy and its individual components was evaluated by simulations on a virtual prostate phantom. This heterogeneous reference phantom was systematically subjected to population based prostate transformations to simulate interfraction variations. Additionally, a patient example illustrated the clinical practice. The correction strategy was evaluated using both dosimetric (CTV mean dose, conformity index) and clinical (tumor control probability, and normal tissue complication probability) measures.  Results:   Based on the current experiments, the intended target dose and tumor control probability could be assured by the proposed method (TCP ≥ TCP(intended)). Additionally, the conformity index error was more than halved compared to the current clinical practice (ΔCI(95%) from 40% to 16%) resulting in improved organ at risk protection. All the individual correction steps had an added value to the full correction.  Conclusions:   A limited number of fiducial points (no organ contours required) and an in-room (CB)CT are sufficient to perform a full dosimetric correction for IMRT plans. In the presence of interfraction variation, the corrected plans show superior dose distributions compared to our current clinical practice.""","""['Wouter Crijns', 'Hans Van Herck', 'Gilles Defraene', 'Laura Van den Bergh', 'Pieter Slagmolen', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Frederik Maes', 'Frank Van den Heuvel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Online adaptation and verification of VMAT.', 'Potential benefits of dosimetric VMAT tracking verified with 3D film measurements.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy: Strategies and benefits depending on tumor localization.', 'Varian ethos online adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer: Early results of contouring accuracy, treatment plan quality, and treatment time.', 'Dosimetric benefits of daily treatment plan adaptation for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Functional imaging equivalence and proof of concept for image-guided adaptive radiotherapy with fixed gantry and rotating couch.', 'Is it essential to use fiducial markers during cone-beam CT-based radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients?']"""

Methods:   The algorithm automatically creates a treatment plan guided by the DVH curves of a reference plan that contains information on the clinician-approved dose-volume trade-offs among different targets/organs and among different portions of a DVH curve for an organ. In ART, the reference plan is the initial plan for the same patient, while for automatic treatment planning the reference plan is selected from a library of clinically approved and delivered plans of previously treated patients with similar medical conditions and geometry. The proposed algorithm employs a voxel-based optimization model and navigates the large voxel-based Pareto surface. The voxel weights are iteratively adjusted to approach a plan that is similar to the reference plan in terms of the DVHs. If the reference plan is feasible but not Pareto optimal, the algorithm generates a Pareto optimal plan with the DVHs better than the reference ones. If the reference plan is too restricting for the new geometry, the algorithm generates a Pareto plan with DVHs close to the reference ones. In both cases, the new plans have similar DVH trade-offs as the reference plans.  Results:   The algorithm was tested using three patient cases and found to be able to automatically adjust the voxel-weighting factors in order to generate a Pareto plan with similar DVH trade-offs as the reference plan. The algorithm has also been implemented on a GPU for high efficiency.  Conclusions:   A novel prior-knowledge-based optimization algorithm has been developed that automatically adjust the voxel weights and generate a clinical optimal plan at high efficiency. It is found that the new algorithm can significantly improve the plan quality and planning efficiency in ART replanning and automatic treatment planning.""","""['Masoud Zarepisheh', 'Troy Long', 'Nan Li', 'Zhen Tian', 'H Edwin Romeijn', 'Xun Jia', 'Steve B Jiang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automatic treatment plan re-optimization for adaptive radiotherapy guided with the initial plan DVHs.', 'Voxel-based automatic multi-criteria optimization for intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'Adaptive method for multicriteria optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy.', 'Adaptive radiation therapy in head and neck cancer for clinical practice: state of the art and practical challenges.', 'Online adaptive planning methods for intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Domain knowledge driven 3D dose prediction using moment-based loss function.', 'Assessment of efficacy in automated plan generation for Varian Ethos intelligent optimization engine.', 'Clinical Implementation of Automated Treatment Planning for Rectum Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy Using Voxel-Based Dose Prediction and Post-Optimization Strategies.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'Deep Learning-Based Fluence Map Prediction for Pancreas Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With Simultaneous Integrated Boost.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively identified 30 consecutive patients with metastatic prostate cancer who were treated with enzalutamide after docetaxel. Post-discontinuation PSA results were available for all patients and were determined at 2-weekly intervals until starting further anticancer systemic therapy. PSA withdrawal response was defined as a PSA decline by ≥50% from the last on-treatment PSA, with a confirmed decrease ≥3 weeks later. Patient characteristics were evaluated in relation to the AAWS using univariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   The median (range) patient age was 70.5 (56-86) years and the median (range) follow-up was 9.0 (0.5-16) months. The most common metastatic sites were the bone (86.7%) and lymph nodes (66.7%). Most patients (70%) had previously received abiraterone and 12 patients (40%) had also received cabazitaxel. The median (range) treatment duration with enzalutamide was 3.68 (1.12-21.39) months. PSA levels after enzalutamide withdrawal were monitored for a median (range) time of 35 (10-120) days. Only one patient (3.3%) had a confirmed PSA response ≥50% after enzalutamide discontinuation. One patient (3.3%) had a confirmed PSA response of between 30 and 50% and another patient (3.3%) had an unconfirmed PSA response of between 30 and 50%. The median overall survival was 15.5 months (95% CI 8.1-24.7). None of the factors analysed in the univariate analysis were significant predictors of PSA decline after enzalutamide discontinuation.  Conclusions:   This retrospective study provides the first evidence that enzalutamide may have an AAWS in a minority of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

In previous studies, shikonin, an active naphthoquinone isolated from the Chinese medicine Zi Cao, has various anticancer activities both in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanisms underlying shikonin's anticancer activity are not fully elucidated on prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential effects of shikonin on prostate cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms by which shikonin exerted its actions. With cell proliferation, flow cytometric cell cycle, migration and invasion assays, we found that shikonin potently suppressed PC-3 and DU145 cell growth by cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase and metastasis in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanically, we presented that shikonin could suppress the metastasis of PC-3 and DU145 cells via inhibiting the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 expression and activation. In addition, shikonin significantly decreased the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR in a dose-dependent manner while it induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed that shikonin also induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was reversed by the ROS scavenger dithiothreitol (DTT). Additionally, DTT reversed the shikonin induced activation of ERK1/2, thereby maintaining MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and restoring cell metastasis. Together, shikonin inhibits aggressive prostate cancer cell migration and invasion by reducing MMP-2/-9 expression via AKT/mTOR and ROS/ERK1/2 pathways and presents a potential novel alternative agent for the treatment of human prostate cancer.""","""['Yongqiang Chen', 'Lu Zheng', 'Junquan Liu', 'Zhonghai Zhou', 'Xiliang Cao', 'Xiaoting Lv', 'Fuxing Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int Immunopharmacol""","""['Shikonin attenuates lung cancer cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and metastasis by inhibiting integrin β1 expression and the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.', 'Reactive oxygen species-mediated activation of the Akt/ASK1/p38 signaling cascade and p21(Cip1) downregulation are required for shikonin-induced apoptosis.', 'Piperine inhibits proliferation of human osteosarcoma cells via G2/M phase arrest and metastasis by suppressing MMP-2/-9 expression.', 'The Fascinating Effects of Baicalein on Cancer: A Review.', 'Promising Anticancer Activities of Alismatis rhizome and Its Triterpenes via p38 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathways.', 'Network Pharmacology Revealed the Mechanisms of Action of Lithospermum erythrorhizon Sieb on Atopic Dermatitis.', 'Promising Nanomedicines of Shikonin for Cancer Therapy.', 'Enzalutamide-induced signatures revealed by epigenetic plasticity using single-cell multi-omics sequencing in prostate cancer.', 'Utilizing mixture design response surface methodology to determine effective combinations of plant derived compounds as prostate cancer treatments.', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Modulates Multiple Downstream Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer Inhibiting Cell Invasiveness.']"""

Patients and methods:   Since 1995, 1125 men with very-low-risk prostate cancer have enrolled in the AS programme at the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH), which is based on monitoring with annual biopsy. The PRIAS protocol uses a combination of periodic biopsies (in years 1, 4, and 7) and prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) to trigger intervention. Patients enrolled in the JHH AS programme were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate how the use of the PRIAS protocol would alter the timing and use of curative intervention.  Results:   Over a median of 2.1 years of follow up, 38% of men in the JHH AS programme had biopsy reclassification. Of those, 62% were detected at biopsy intervals corresponding to the PRIAS criteria, while 16% were detected between scheduled PRIAS biopsies, resulting in a median delay in detection of 1.9 years. Of the 202 men with >5 years of follow-up, 11% in the JHH programme were found to have biopsy reclassification after it would have been identified in the PRIAS protocol, resulting in a median delay of 4.7 years to reclassification. In all, 12% of patients who would have undergone immediate intervention under PRIAS due to abnormal PSA kinetics would never have undergone reclassification on the JHH protocol and thus would not have undergone definitive intervention.

The unfolded protein response pathways have been proposed to be a viable target for developing new anticancer drugs.  Experimental approach:   We screened the Johns Hopkins Drug Library for inhibitors of prostate cancer cell proliferation to identify new antiprostate cancer treatments among known drugs. We systematically investigated the mechanism underlying the anticancer activity of a hit and assessed its efficacy in blocking prostate tumour growth in a mouse model.  Key results:   The antibacterial drug clofoctol was identified as a novel inhibitor of prostate cancer cell proliferation. Morphologically, cells treated with clofoctol were found to undergo massive vacuolization, reminiscent of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Indeed, all three unfolded protein response pathways including inositol requiring enzyme 1, double-stranded RNA-activated PK-like ER kinase and activating transcription factor 6 were found to be activated by clofoctol. Activation of unfolded protein response pathways by clofoctol led to the inhibition of protein translation in cells and the induction of G1 cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells. Clofoctol also inhibited prostate cancer xenograft growth in vivo without apparent toxicity.  Conclusion and implications:   Our findings revealed clofoctol as a novel activator of the unfolded protein response pathways and a promising inhibitor of prostate cancer.

Aims:   To examine the long term outcome of sural nerve grafting (SNG) during radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) performed by a single surgeon.  Methods:   Sixty-six patients with clinically localized prostate cancer and preoperative International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score >20 who underwent RRP were included.

Main outcome measures:   Postoperative IIEF score at three years of men undergoing RRP with SNG. Recovery of potency was defined as postoperative IIEF-EF domain score >22.  Results:   There were 43 (65%) unilateral SNG and 23 (35%) bilateral SNG. Mean surgical time was 164 minutes (71 to 221 minutes).The mean preoperative IIEF score was 23.4+1.6.

History of diabetes (P=0.001) and age (P=0.007) negatively correlated with recovery of EF. 60% patients used PDE5i and showed a significantly higher EF recovery (43% vs. 17%, P=0.009).

We aim to determine whether perioperative complications and functional outcomes impact quality of life 1 year after surgical treatment.  Patients and methods:   Quality of life, functional and oncological outcomes were assessed in patients who underwent open retropubic radical prostatectomy at a single academic institution between 2003 and 2009, preoperatively and 1 year after surgery using the EORTC QLQ-C30, the IIEF-5 and an institutional questionnaire. Perioperative complications were recorded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Patients without complications were compared to patients with any, low- or high-grade complications. The global health score domain of the EORTC QLQ-C30 is reported for various oncological and functional outcomes and contrasted to stratified categories of complications and functional outcomes.  Results:   A full dataset was available for 29.5 % (n = 856) of all patients. The overall complication rate was 27.5 % (235/856). A total of 307 complications were recorded of whom 88.9 % (273/307) were low grade. In this study, population global health perception did not decline after surgery (70.5 ± 21.2 vs. 74.4 ± 19.7; p < 0.0001). Complications showed only statistical but no clinical meaningful influence on global health perception as well as on functional and symptom scales. Patients who met combined outcome criteria experienced the best postoperative global health score (86.0 ± 13.1 and 86.0 ± 14.2).  Conclusions:   Perioperative complications and functional outcomes have a measurable impact on quality of life 1 year following surgery. While perioperative complications have a statistical effect, functional outcomes showed a clinically more profound effect on postoperative global health perception.""","""['Björn Löppenberg', 'Christian von Bodman', 'Marko Brock', 'Florian Roghmann', 'Joachim Noldus', 'Rein Jüri Palisaar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Short- and Long-term Functional Outcomes and Quality of Life after Radical Prostatectomy: Patient-reported Outcomes from a Tertiary High-volume Center.', 'A matter of size?

Cell detachment from ECM induces a specific form of programmed cell death (PCD) termed anoikis. BRCA2, a tumor suppressor gene whose mutations confer predisposition to cancer, has been implicated in the regulation of DNA repair, transcription, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. However, the potential role of BRCA2 in the regulation of anoikis has not been investigated. Here, we found that suppression of BRCA2 expression by short hairpin RNA promoted resistance to anoikis in prostate, breast and thyroid normal epithelial cells, which was accompanied by reduced caspases 3/7 levels and activity. Using yeast as a model, we assessed that expression of human BRCA2 does not induce cell death by itself but it can promote acetic acid-induced PCD (AA-PCD). Induction of BRCA2 expression decreased cell survival and increased the number of cells positive to different apoptotic markers, including DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine externalization en route to AA-PCD. A higher increase in ROS levels occurred in the early phase of AA-PCD in BRCA2-expressing yeast cells compared with non-expressing cells. Accordingly, a delay in the initial burst of ROS levels was observed in BRCA2-knockdown anoikis-resistant human cells. Treatment with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine or ascorbic acid reduced sensitivity to anoikis in human cells and inhibited AA-PCD in yeast cells expressing BRCA2. Taken together, these results show a new function of BRCA2 protein as modulator of anoikis sensitivity through an evolutionarily-conserved molecular mechanism involving regulation of ROS production and/or detoxification by BRCA2 during PCD processes.""","""['Nicoletta Guaragnella', 'Ersilia Marra', 'Alvaro Galli', 'Loredana Moro', 'Sergio Giannattasio']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Apoptosis""","""['Knock-out of metacaspase and/or cytochrome c results in the activation of a ROS-independent acetic acid-induced programmed cell death pathway in yeast.', 'Yeast growth in raffinose results in resistance to acetic-acid induced programmed cell death mostly due to the activation of the mitochondrial retrograde pathway.', 'Cytochrome c is released from coupled mitochondria of yeast en route to acetic acid-induced programmed cell death and can work as an electron donor and a ROS scavenger.', 'Achievements and perspectives in yeast acetic acid-induced programmed cell death pathways.', 'The expanding role of yeast in cancer research and diagnosis: insights into the function of the oncosuppressors p53 and BRCA1/2.', 'Yeast as a Model to Unravel New BRCA2 Functions in Cell Metabolism.', '6-Thioguanine and Its Analogs Promote Apoptosis of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells in a BRCA2-Dependent Manner.', 'External and internal triggers of cell death in yeast.', 'Silencing of BRCA2 to Identify Novel BRCA2-regulated Biological Functions in Cultured Human Cells.']"""

Low cancer detection rates in the repeat biopsy illuminate the dilemma of the international gold standard of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided PB in the detection of PCa. Our study evaluated the combination of TRUS and prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its reported high sensitivities and high specificities by using real-time MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy. The detection of clinically significant PCa was investigated.  Material and methods:   128 consecutive patients in the period of January 2012 to August 2013 were included. All patients had at least one TRUS-guided biopsy with negative findings and the clinical indication for a systematic re-biopsy. Prior to the MRI/US fusion all patients underwent a 3 Tesla prostate MRI without endorectal coil. The MRI data were uploaded to a modern US system. The B-mode, power-mode, elastography and CEUS imaging were used to classify the suspicious lesions from the MRI on a scale of 0-3 and a US sum score was calculated. The lesion was consecutively biopsied by real-time MRI/US fusion followed by a systematic 10 core biopsy.  Results:   Among 128 patients 51 PCa could be detected (39.8%). From these 51 PCa cases, clinically significant PCa was detected by MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy as follows: Gleason score >7 in 9 of 10 patients; Gleason score=7 in 14 of 20 patients and Gleason score <7 in 13 of 21 patients. A positive correlation was shown between the US sum score and the associated PI-RADS score in 65 patients in whom lesions were classified by PI-RADS. A positive correlation was further shown between the US sum score and the Gleason score of all suspicious and biopsied lesions. MRI/US fusion and TRUS-guided biopsy combined, detected 30 of 51 PCa; 6 of 51 PCa were detected by MRI/US fusion alone and 15 of 51 PCa by conventional TRUS-guided biopsy alone.  Conclusion:   Real-time MR/US fusion increases detection rates of PCa in patients undergoing repeat biopsy.

Then all pathologists attend a free web-based course. Afterwards, the same 150 samples [with different codes compared to the previous ones] are distributed differently among the pathologists to be assigned Gleason scores. After gathering the data, the concordance rate in the first and second reports of pathologists is determined. In the pre web-education, the mean kappa value of Interobserver agreement was 0.25 [fair agreement]. Post web-education significantly improved with the mean kappa value of 0.52 [moderate agreement]. Using weighted kappa values, significant improvement was observed in inter-observer agreement in higher scores of Gleason grade; Score 10 was achieved for the mean kappa value in post web-education was 0.68 [substantial agreement] compared to 0.25 (fair agreement) in pre web-education.

Local excision with free resection margins provides adequate treatment, but extended surgery such as abdominoperineal resection has been frequently performed because of technical difficulties in the confined pelvic space.  Objective:   We aimed to report the technical details of a new method of local excision for rectal GI stromal tumor: the modified laparoscopic intersphincteric resection technique.  Design:   This study was a retrospective analysis.  Setting:   This study was performed at a single institute.  Patients:   We included 3 patients with rectal GI stromal tumor who underwent this procedure following neoadjuvant imatinib therapy.  Intervention:   Medial-to-lateral retroperitoneal dissection was begun near the sacral promontory, and rectal dissection while preserving autonomic nerves was performed down to the pelvic floor into the anal canal without dividing the inferior mesenteric artery. Dissection between the tumor and prostate was meticulously performed under laparoscopic magnified view. Next, circumferential connection between the laparoscopic and transanal dissections was performed through a transanal approach, and the rectum was extracted through the anus. Circular full-thickness local excision of the rectum and handsewn straight rectoanal anastomosis was performed.  Main outcome measures:   The safety and feasibility of this procedure were the primary outcomes measured by this study.  Results:   The median operative time was 180 minutes, and the median estimated blood loss was 115 mL. There were no conversions or intraoperative complications, and there was 1 postoperative intestinal obstruction that recovered with conservative therapy. All patients had negative resection margins (R0), including 1 pathological complete response.  Limitations:   The study was limited by the small number of patients.

HOXB13 is also abundant in castration-resistant prostate tumors. To determine the invasive potential of HOXB13 in prostate tumors, highly metastatic PC3 prostate cancer cells were manipulated to express HOXB13 and/or the prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF). The PDEF is believed to reduce the invasive potential of various tumors, including prostate tumors. To further demonstrate the functional correlation between HOXB13 and PDEF, transwell invasion and gelatin zymography assays were performed. In addition, the western blot analysis was used to demonstrate the expression of PDEF target proteins involved in cancer cell migration and invasion, MMP-9 and survivin. According to the results, HOXB13 promoted PC3 cell migration and invasion. The DNA microarray analysis demonstrated that HOXB13 significantly suppressed the expression of the PDEF. Accordingly, the expression of MMP-9 and survivin was regulated by HOXB13. In addition, HOXB13 promoted the invasive potential of PC3 cells while inhibiting the PDEF. The coexpression of HOXB13 and the PDEF led to moderate retardation of the number of invasive cells, indicating that HOXB13 functionally counteracted cell invasion by reducing PDEF expression. The western blot analysis demonstrated that HOXB13 counteracted the PDEF-mediated inhibition of the expression of PDEF target proteins such as MMP-9 and survivin. The results suggest that the HOXB13-mediated promotion of tumor cell invasion is accomplished mainly through the downregulation of PDEF expression.""","""['In-Je Kim', 'Taek Won Kang', 'Taeoh Jeong', 'Young-Rang Kim', 'Chaeyong Jung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['PDEF downregulates stathmin expression in prostate cancer.', 'Upregulation of prostate-derived Ets factor by luteolin causes inhibition of cell proliferation and cell invasion in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Prostate-derived ETS factor is a mediator of metastatic potential through the inhibition of migration and invasion in breast cancer.', 'Prostate derived ETS factor (PDEF): a putative tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'PDEF in prostate cancer.', 'Drug Repurposing: A New Hope in Drug Discovery for Prostate Cancer.', 'A Live Cell Protein Complementation Assay for ORFeome-Wide Probing of Human HOX Interactomes.', 'Downstream of the HOX genes: Explaining conflicting tumour suppressor and oncogenic functions in cancer.', 'Homeobox Genes in Cancers: From Carcinogenesis to Recent Therapeutic Intervention.', 'FTO demethylates m6A modifications in HOXB13 mRNA and promotes endometrial cancer metastasis by activating the WNT signalling pathway.']"""

Although downregulation of classical cadherins, such as E-cadherin, has been described in prostate cancer tissue samples, the expression of desmogleins has only been previously reported in prostate cancer cell lines. In this study we characterized desmoglein expression in normal prostate tissues, and further investigated whether Desmoglein 2 (DSG2) expression specifically can serve as a potential clinical prognostic factor for patients diagnosed with primary prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   We utilized immunofluorescence to examine DSG2 expression in normal prostate (n = 50) and in a clinically well-characterized cohort of prostate cancer patients (n = 414). Correlation of DSG2 expression with clinico-pathological characteristics and biochemical recurrence was analyzed to assess its clinical significance.  Results:   These studies revealed that DSG2 and DSG4 were specifically expressed in prostatic luminal cells, whereas basal cells lack their expression. In contrast, DSG1 and DSG3 were not expressed in normal prostate epithelium. Further analyses of DSG2 expression in prostate cancer revealed that reduced levels of this biomarker were a significant independent marker of poor clinical outcome.

Within tumours, the amount of AR plays a crucial role in determining cell growth, resistance to therapy and progression to fatal castrate recurrent PCa in which prostate cells appear to become independent of androgenic steroids. Despite the pivotal role of the AR in male development and fertility and all stages of PCa development, the mechanisms governing AR expression remain poorly understood. In this work, we describe an active nonconsensus androgen response element (ARE) in the 5' UTR of the human AR gene. The ARE represses transcription upon binding of activated AR, and this downregulation is relieved by disruption of the regulatory element through mutation.

The prognostic impact of cSVI was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression analysis. The predictive accuracy was assessed by a receiver operating characteristic analysis.  Results:   A total of 229 patients (59.5 %) without cSVI comprised group A, and 156 patients (40.5 %) with cSVI comprised group B. Positive lymph nodes (63 vs. 44 %, p < 0.001) and positive surgical margins (34 % vs. 14 %, p < 0.001) were more common in patients with cSVI. The 5- and 10-year cancer-specific survival rates were 41 % and 32 % (group A) and 21 and 17 % (group B) (p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, pathological nodal stage (hazard ratio [HR] 2.19, p < 0.001), soft tissue surgical margin (HR 1.57, p = 0.010), clinical tumor stage (HR 1.46, p = 0.010), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.40, p < 0.001), and cSVI (HR 1.69, p < 0.001) independently impacted cancer-specific mortality. The c-indices of the multivariable models with and without inclusion of cSVI were 0.658 (95 % confidence interval 0.60-0.71) and 0.635 (95 % confidence interval 0.58-0.69), respectively, resulting in a predictive accuracy gain of 2.3 % (p = 0.002).  Conclusions:   In patients with UCB and prostatic stromal invasion, cSVI adversely affected cancer-specific survival compared to patients without cSVI. The inclusion of cSVI significantly improved the predictive accuracy of our multivariable model regarding survival.""","""['Matthias May', 'Sabine Brookman-May', 'Maximilian Burger', 'Christian Gilfrich', 'Hans-Martin Fritsche', 'Michael Rink', 'Felix Chun', 'Margit Fisch', 'Florian Roghmann', 'Joachim Noldus', 'Roman Mayr', 'Armin Pycha', 'Vladimir Novotny', 'Manfred Wirth', 'Stefan Vallo', 'Axel Haferkamp', 'Jan Roigas', 'Antonin Brisuda', 'Regina Stredele', 'Björn Volkmer', 'Christopher Dechet', 'Marco Schnabel', 'Stefan Denzinger', 'Christian G Stief', 'Patrick J Bastian', 'Atiqullah Aziz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['Comparative analysis of the effect of prostatic invasion patterns on cancer-specific mortality after radical cystectomy in pT4a urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Positive surgical margins in soft tissue following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer and cancer specific survival.', 'Prediction of cancer-specific survival after radical cystectomy in pT4a urothelial carcinoma of the bladder: development of a tool for clinical decision-making.', 'Upper urinary tract recurrence following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a meta-analysis on 13,185 patients.', 'Analysis of 34 cases of infiltrating carcinoma of the bladder treated exclusively with partial cystectomy (part 1).', 'Feasibility Study of a Novel Protease-Activated Fluorescent Imaging System for Real-Time, Intraoperative Detection of Residual Breast Cancer in Breast Conserving Surgery.', 'Concomitant carcinoma in situ may not be a prognostic factor for patients with bladder cancer following radical cystectomy: a PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Impact of the Level of Urothelial Carcinoma Involvement of the Prostate on Survival after Radical Cystectomy.', 'Impact of surgical margin status on the outcome of bladder cancer treated by radical cystectomy: a meta-analysis.']"""

For a more effective implementation of the clustering algorithm, we propose a measure of the minimum distance worth detecting and illustrate its use in two examples. We summarize simulation results to study properties of the proposed methods and also prove the consistency of the cluster grouping estimated with a given number of clusters.

Patients and methods:   In this prospective audit, patients were identified as having a low- or high-risk of sepsis based on a questionnaire about established risk factors: previous biopsy; recurrent urine infections; receiving ciprofloxacin in the 12 months prior; travel to South-East Asia or South America in the previous 6 months; or diabetes, immune system impairment or receipt of immunosuppressant drugs. All received ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and high-risk patients additionally received ertapenem. Sepsis requiring hospital admission was recorded. Data was analysed using a two-tailed Fisher's exact test.  Results:   In all, 80 men were identified as high risk of sepsis and 90 as low risk during the audit period. Six patients in the low-risk group (6.7%, 95% confidence interval 2.1-11.3) and none in the high-risk group developed sepsis (P = 0.03). Of the six developing sepsis, two grew ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms, two had no growth and two grew a ciprofloxacin-sensitive organism, although one of these grew extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli.  Conclusion:   The addition of ertapenem to standard prophylaxis is effective at reducing sepsis after prostate biopsy. Risk stratification is not effective at identifying those men at low risk of sepsis, as these men still have a high sepsis rate.

Methods:   This study included 254 incident colorectal cancers and 254 matched controls nested in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Serum samples were collected at baseline, and the mean length of follow-up was 8 years. Serum metabolites were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid-phase chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for metabolites above the limit of detection and present in at least 80% of participants.  Results:   A total of 676 serum metabolites were measured; of these, 447 were of known identity and 278 of these were present in >80% of individuals.

Methods:   A total of 83 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from August 2005 through August 2013 were included in the present study. Findings at preoperative computed tomography scanning and sleep-related erection were used to determine the objective erectile function. Sleep-related erection was measured with an erectometer during at least three nights, and we assessed the maximum penile circumferential change. The visceral fat ratio was calculated as the ratio of the visceral fat area to the total subcutaneous fat area on computed tomography images, and the influence of these parameters on preoperative erectile function was assessed.  Results:   In simple linear regression analysis there was a strong correlation between the waist circumference and visceral fat ratio (P < 0.01). A visceral fat ratio of 55% was equivalent to a waist circumference of 85 cm, which is the standard value for central obesity in Japan. Furthermore, the factor that most negatively affected maximum penile circumferential change was the visceral fat ratio. In addition, only a visceral fat ratio of 55% or greater was a significant independent risk factor for declining maximum penile circumferential change in both univariate and multivariate analyses (P = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively).

The extravasation of tumor cells from the blood vascular system can be studied using endothelial cells (ECs) and tumor cells obtained from different cell lines. Initial studies were conducted using static conditions but it has been well documented that ECs behave differently under physiological flow conditions. Therefore, different flow chamber assemblies are currently being used to studying cancer cell interactions with ECs. Current flow chamber assemblies offer reproducible results using either different cell lines or fluid at different shear stress conditions. However, to observe and study interactions with rare cells such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), certain changes are required to be made to the conventional flow chamber assembly. CTCs are a rare cell population among millions of blood cells. Consequently, it is difficult to obtain a pure population of CTCs. Contamination of CTCs with different types of cells normally found in the circulation is inevitable using present enrichment or depletion techniques. In the present report, we describe a unique method to fluorescently label circulating prostate cancer cells and study their interactions with ECs in a self-assembled flow chamber system.

We previously found that antioxidant administration (N-acetylcysteine) in the Nkx3.1 knockout mouse model promoted prostate epithelial proliferation, suggesting that NKX3.1 activity modifies the effect of antioxidant administration on prostate carcinogenesis. Interestingly, administration of the antioxidant vitamin E significantly increased prostate cancer risk in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), suggesting that our animal experiments may be relevant to humans. To determine whether NKX3.1 played a role in increased human prostate cancer risk associated with antioxidant administration in SELECT, we investigated the joint risk of antioxidant administration and NKX3.1 genotypes previously found to be associated with decreased NKX3.1 mRNA expression (rs11781886) or DNA-binding activity in vitro (rs2228013) in the SELECT biomarker case-cohort substudy (1,866 cases; 3,135 non-cases). Multivariable COX regression models were developed to determine the joint association of NKX3.1 genotypes with administration of vitamin E, selenium, or the combination, compared with placebo. The CC genotype at rs11781886 combined with selenium administration was associated with increased overall prostate cancer risk [HR, 1.676; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.011-2.777; P = 0.045] and low-grade prostate cancer risk (HR, 1.811; 95% CI, 1.016-3.228; P = 0.0441).

Methods and materials:   Two-hundred twelve patients, treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy to the prostate between 2004 and 2011, met the inclusion criteria for the analysis. All patients received 70 Gy to the prostate delivered over 28 fractions and 103 (49%) received ENI consisting of 50.4 Gy to the pelvic lymphatics delivered simultaneously in 1.8 Gy fractions. The mean dose-volume histograms were compared between the two subgroups defined by use of ENI, and various dose-volume parameters were analyzed for effect on late lower gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity.  Results:   Acute grade 2 lower GI toxicity occurred in 38 (37%) patients receiving ENI versus 19 (17%) in those who did not (p = 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of grade ≥ 2 lower GI toxicity at 3 years was 15.3% for patients receiving ENI versus 5.3% for those who did not (p = 0.026). Each rectal isodose volume was increased for patients receiving ENI up to 50 Gy (p ≤ 0.021 for each 5 Gy increment). Across all patients, the absolute V70 of the rectum was the only predictor of late GI toxicity. When subgroups, defined by the use of ENI, were analyzed separately, rectal V70 was only predictive of late GI toxicity for patients who received ENI. For patients receiving ENI, V70 > 3 cc was associated with an increased risk of late GI events.  Conclusions:   Elective nodal irradiation increases the rates of acute and late GI toxicity when delivered simultaneously with hypofractioanted prostate radiotherapy.

Our objective was to evaluate the additional clinical utility of p2PSA compared with total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), and preoperative Gleason score (Gls) in predicting locally advanced PCa (pT3/T4) with high-accuracy discrimination. The aim was to develop a novel classification based on p2PSA and preoperative Gls for predicting advanced PCa.  Materials and methods:   In 208 consecutive men diagnosed with clinically localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy, we determined the predictive and discriminatory accuracy of serum tPSA, fPSA, percentage of fPSA to tPSA, p2PSA, p2PSA density, percentage of p2PSA to fPSA, and the Prostate Health Index. The cutoff level of p2PSA with best accuracy was estimated. The novel classification was developed by analyzing the interaction between p2PSA and Gls in predicting pathologic outcomes using a chi-square automatic interaction detection analysis. Decision curve analysis was applied to test the clinical consequences of using the novel classification.  Results:   On univariate analyses, p2PSA, p2PSA density, percentage of p2PSA to fPSA, and Prostate Health Index were accurate but were not independent predictors by multivariate analysis. The p2PSA cutoff level of 22.5 pg/ml showed the best accuracy level for predicting and discriminating advanced diseases (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.725, sensitivity = 51.4%, specificity = 81.8%). By chi-square automatic interaction detection, univariate and multivariate analysis, a p2PSA level > 22.5 pg/ml was significantly associated with an increased frequency and risk of advanced disease. In patients with a p2PSA level ≤ 22.5 pg/ml, 91.8% of Gleason sum 6 PCa was organ confined. The combination of p2PSA and Gls enhanced slightly but significantly the predictive and discriminatory accuracy for advanced disease (0.6%-3.6%).  Conclusions:   The p2PSA cutoff level of 22.5 pg/ml can accurately discriminate between organ-confined and advanced PCa. The additional use of p2PSA enhanced slightly the predictive accuracy for advanced PCa (pT3/pT4) and has limited additional predictive value in identifying aggressive PCa (Gls > 7a).""","""['Okyaz Eminaga', 'Martin Bögemann', 'Bernhard Breil', 'Ulf Titze', 'Fabian Wötzel', 'Elke Eltze', 'Olaf Bettendorf', 'Axel Semjonow']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Clinical performance of serum -2proPSA derivatives, %p2PSA and PHI, in the detection and management of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of prostate-specific antigen isoform p2PSA and its derivates, %p2PSA, prostate health index and prostate dimension-adjusted related index in the detection of prostate cancer at first biopsy: an exploratory, prospective study.', 'Preoperative prostate-specific antigen isoform p2PSA and its derivatives, %p2PSA and prostate health index, predict pathologic outcomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative Prostate-specific Antigen Isoform p2PSA and Its Derivatives, %p2PSA and Prostate Health Index, Predict Pathologic Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: Results from a Multicentric European Prospective Study.', 'Clinical use of -2proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives (%p2PSA and Prostate Health Index) for the detection of prostate cancer: a review of the literature.', 'Clinical value of serum isoform -2 proprostate-specific antigen and its derivatives in predicting aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative prostate health index and %p2PSA as the significant biomarkers of postoperative pathological outcomes of prostate cancer in Korean males: A prospective multi-institutional study.', 'Clinical performance of serum -2proPSA derivatives, %p2PSA and PHI, in the detection and management of prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Our thyroidectomy protocol included thorough excision of both lobes and the isthmus. For evaluating the completeness of thyroidectomy, we compared the (99m)Tc-pertechnetate scans taken before and after thyroidectomy. The prostate cancer cell line was subcutaneously inoculated 2 weeks after the thyroidectomy. When the tumor reached 5-10 mm in diameter, Ad5/35-E4PSESE1a-hNIS was injected intratumorally, and (131)I scans were performed. The radioiodine uptakes of the neck and the tumor were compared with those of the other regions.  Results:   Total thyroidectomy was performed in 13 mice. Although 38.5% died during or just after thyroidectomy, the others survived in good health for 2 months. Thyroid tissue was completely eliminated using our protocol; the residual uptake of (99m)Tc-pertechnetate was minimal in the neck area. The neck/background uptake ratio after thyroidectomy was significantly lower than that before thyroidectomy (p < 0.05). Non-thyroidal tumor models were successfully established in all the surviving mice. Radioiodine accumulation in the tumors was visualized on (131)I scans, and the neck uptakes were minimal.  Conclusion:   Using our total thyroidectomy protocol, we successfully established a hNIS-transfected prostate cancer model with a minimal accumulation of radioiodine in the neck. The relatively high mortality after surgery can be a problem, and this might be reduced by minimizing the surgical stress.""","""['Hye-Kyung Shim', 'Seog Gyun Kim', 'Tae-Sung Kim', 'Seok-Ki Kim', 'Sang Jin Lee']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['In vivo long-term imaging and radioiodine therapy by sodium-iodide symporter gene expression using a lentiviral system containing ubiquitin C promoter.', 'The glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter directs sodium/iodide symporter gene expression for radioiodine therapy of malignant glioma.', 'Expression of the human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) in xenotransplanted human thyroid carcinoma.', 'Development of a dual membrane protein reporter system using sodium iodide symporter and mutant dopamine D2 receptor transgenes.', 'Radioiodine therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer following prostate-specific membrane antigen promoter-mediated transfer of the human sodium iodide symporter.', 'Casein Kinase 1α as a Novel Factor Affects Thyrotropin Synthesis via PKC/ERK/CREB Signaling.', 'Aging-Associated Thyroid Dysfunction Contributes to Oxidative Stress and Worsened Functional Outcomes Following Traumatic Brain Injury.', 'Combining three independent pathological stressors induces a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype.', 'Sodium iodide symporter for nuclear molecular imaging and gene therapy: from bedside to bench and back.']"""

In this study, we examine the effects of downregulating ILK on mitotic function in human retinoblastoma cell lines. These retinal cancer cells, caused by the loss of function of two gene alleles (Rb1) that encode the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor, have elevated expression of ILK. Here we show that inhibition of ILK activity results in a concentration-dependent increase in nuclear area and multinucleated cells. Moreover, inhibition of ILK activity and expression increased the accumulation of multinucleated cells over time. In these cells, aberrant cytokinesis and karyokinesis correlate with altered mitotic spindle organization, decreased levels of cortical F-actin and centrosome de-clustering. Centrosome de-clustering, induced by ILK siRNA, was rescued in FLAG-ILK expressing Y79 cells as compared to those expressing FLAG-tag alone. Inhibition of ILK increased the proportion of cells exhibiting mitotic spindles and caused a significant G2/M arrest as early as 24 hours after exposure to QLT-0267. Live cell analysis indicate ILK downregulation causes an increase in multipolar anaphases and failed cytokinesis (bipolar and multipolar) of viable cells.

Men who had died of their disease, ""cases"" (N = 83), were matched to ""referents"" (N = 232), those who had not died of prostate cancer, using incidence density sampling. Diagnostic tissue was retrieved to assess expression of AZGP1, MUC1, NKX3.1, p53, and PTEN by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC). Poisson regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRRs) adjusted for age, Gleason score, and stage and to estimate survival probabilities. Expression of MUC1 and p53 was associated with increased mortality (MRR 2.51, 95% CI 1.14-5.54, P = 0.02 and 3.08, 95% CI 1.41-6.95, P = 0.005, respectively), whereas AZGP1 expression was associated with decreased mortality (MRR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.96, P = 0.04). Analyzing all markers under a combined model indicated that the three markers were independent predictors of prostate cancer death and survival. For men with localized disease at diagnosis, assessment of AZGP1, MUC1, and p53 expression in diagnostic tissue by IHC could potentially improve estimates of risk of dying from prostate cancer based only on Gleason score and clinical stage.""","""['Gianluca Severi', 'Liesel M FitzGerald', 'David C Muller', 'John Pedersen', 'Anthony Longano', 'Melissa C Southey', 'John L Hopper', 'Dallas R English', 'Graham G Giles', 'John Mills']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['An analysis of a multiple biomarker panel to better predict prostate cancer metastasis after radical prostatectomy.', 'Loss of PTEN Expression Detected by Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry Predicts Lethal Prostate Cancer in Men Treated with Prostatectomy.', 'Loss of AZGP1 as a Superior Predictor of Relapse in Margin-Positive Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'An immunohistochemical signature comprising PTEN, MYC, and Ki67 predicts progression in prostate cancer patients receiving adjuvant docetaxel after prostatectomy.', 'Validation of proposed prostate cancer biomarkers with gene expression data: a long road to travel.', ""Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by investigating the inhibitory effect of serum components on P450 inhibition assay."", 'Identification of Altered Proteins in the Plasma of Rats With Chronic Prostatic Inflammation Induced by Estradiol Benzoate and Sex Hormones.', 'Sequential Protein Capture in Multiplex Single Molecule Arrays: A Strategy for Eliminating Assay Cross-Reactivity.', 'Graphene-based biosensors for the detection of prostate cancer protein biomarkers: a review.', 'An analysis of a multiple biomarker panel to better predict prostate cancer metastasis after radical prostatectomy.']"""

This study aims to investigate prevalence of ETS-related gene (ERG) oncoprotein overexpression in Filipinos as surrogate of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions, using a highly specific monoclonal antibody (ERG-MAb), and conduct the first attempt to study the role of genetic alterations in the aggressive tumor biologic behaviour of CaP among Filipinos.  Methods:   This case-matched, case-control retrospective study evaluated ERG expression in Filipino patients diagnosed with CaP and its effect on stage and Gleason grade of their disease. Men who underwent radical prostatectomy for organ-confined disease at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) comprised the organ-confined cohort. Age-matched adults who had trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate (TRUSP) biopsy or trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP) with bilateral orchiectomy for T4 or stage IV CaP composed the advanced disease cohort.  Results:   Overall ERG expression frequency of 23.08% (N = 104) was demonstrated, with a higher rate observed in the advanced disease cohort (32.69%) compared to the organ-confined group (13.46%). Furthermore, ERG overexpression was only detected among intermediate and high-risk tumors. A high-specificity (98.08%) of the ERG-MAb for malignant prostatic cells was likewise demonstrated.  Conclusions:   In contrast to higher ERG frequency in Western countries, it is much lower in Filipino CaP, which is similar to lower rates noted from other Asian countries. The 98.08% specificity of ERG oncoprotein for prostate tumor cells combined with its increased association in advanced disease, suggests for prognostic potential of ERG that may aid clinicians in treatment decisions for Filipino CaP patients.""","""['Eliza M Raymundo', 'Michele H Diwa', 'Marie Carmela M Lapitan', 'Aladin B Plaza', 'Jesus Emmanuel Sevilleja', 'Shiv Srivastava', 'Isabell A Sesterhenn']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['βIII-tubulin overexpression is an independent predictor of prostate cancer progression tightly linked to ERG fusion status and PTEN deletion.', 'Are biomarkers evaluated in biopsy specimens predictive of prostate cancer aggressiveness?', 'Expression of ERG oncoprotein is associated with a less aggressive tumor phenotype in Japanese prostate cancer patients.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'ERG protein expression as a biomarker of prostate cancer.', 'Metabolic pathways enriched according to ERG status are associated with biochemical recurrence in Hispanic/Latino patients with prostate cancer.', 'Molecular profiling of radical prostatectomy tissue from patients with no sign of progression identifies ERG as the strongest independent predictor of recurrence.', 'Prevalence and clinical application of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in Asian prostate cancer patients: a large-sample study in Chinese people and a systematic review.', 'Ethnicity and ERG frequency in prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in Turkish patients with localized prostate cancer: results of radical prostatectomy specimens.']"""

The aim was to study whether this is also reflected in cancer mortality among the population using geothermal hot water for space heating, washing, and showering.  Methods:   The follow-up was from 1981 to 2009. Personal identifier of those 5-64 years of age was used in record linkage with nationwide death registry. Thus, vital and emigration status was ascertained. The exposed population was defined as inhabitants of communities with district heating generated from geothermal wells since 1972. Reference populations were inhabitants of other areas with different degrees of volcanic/geothermal activity. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for age, gender, education, housing, reproductive factors and smoking habits.  Results:   Among those using geothermal water, the HR for all causes of death was 0.98 (95% CI 0.91-1.05) as compared with cold reference area. The HR for breast cancer was 1.53 (1.04-2.24), prostate cancer 1.74 (1.21-2.52), kidney cancer 1.78 (1.03-3.07), and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 2.01 (1.05-3.38). HR for influenza was 3.36 (1.32-8.58) and for suicide 1.49 (1.03-2.17).  Conclusion:   The significant excess mortality risk of breast and prostate cancers, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma confirmed the results of similarly designed studies in Iceland on cancer incidence among populations from high-temperature geothermal areas and users of geothermal hot water. The risk is not confined to cancers with good prognosis, but also concerns fatal cancers.

The importance of PSA at diagnosis on the time periods and on biochemical recurrence was assessed using a generalized linear model. The independent predictive behavior of biochemical recurrence was analyzed using Cox regression.  Results:   The median follow-up was 38 (16-76) months. PSA levels at diagnosis were higher in the period 1994-2000 (12.97ng/mL, P<.001). Seventy-two percent of the patients from the period 2007-2011 were diagnosed as clinical stage T1c (P<.001), compared with 55% from the period 1994-2000.

Up-regulation of fatty acid synthase not only increases production of fatty acids in tumors but also contributes to the transformed phenotype by conferring growth and survival advantages. In addition, increased fatty acid synthase expression in prostate cancer correlates with poor prognosis, although the mechanism(s) by which this occurs are not completely understood. Because fatty acid synthase is expressed at low levels in normal cells, it is currently a major target for anticancer drug design. Fatty acid synthase is normally found in the cytosol; however, we have discovered that it also localizes to the nucleus in a subset of prostate cancer cells. Analysis of the fatty acid synthase protein sequence indicated the presence of a nuclear localization signal, and subcellular fractionation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, as well as immunofluorescent confocal microscopy of patient prostate tumor tissue and LNCaPs confirmed nuclear localization of this protein. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer tissue indicated that nuclear localization of fatty acid synthase correlates with Gleason grade, implicating a potentially novel role in prostate cancer progression. Possible clinical implications include improving the accuracy of prostate biopsies in the diagnosis of low- versus intermediate-risk prostate cancer and the uncovering of novel metabolic pathways for the therapeutic targeting of androgen-independent prostate cancer.""","""['Allison A Madigan', 'Kevin J Rycyna', 'Anil V Parwani', 'Yeipyeng J Datiri', 'Ahmed M Basudan', 'Kathryn M Sobek', 'Jessica L Cummings', 'Per H Basse', 'Dean J Bacich', ""Denise S O'Keefe""]""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Targeting fatty acid synthase with ASC-J9 suppresses proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'Immunohistochemical detection of a fatty acid synthase (OA-519) as a predictor of progression of prostate cancer.', 'Fatty acid synthase: a metabolic enzyme and candidate oncogene in prostate cancer.', 'High-level expression of fatty acid synthase in human prostate cancer tissues is linked to activation and nuclear localization of Akt/PKB.', 'Histopathology of localized prostate cancer.

However, major concerns were related to mortality patterns from other cancers, particularly in women. We provide an up-to-date picture of patterns and trends in cancer mortality in Latin America.  Methods:   We analyzed data from the World Health Organization mortality database in 2005-2009 for 20 cancer sites in 11 Latin American countries and, for comparative purposes, in the USA and Canada. We computed age-standardized (world population) rates (per 100 000 person-year) and provided an overview of trends since 1980 using joinpoint regression models.  Results:   Cancer mortality from some common cancers (including colorectum and lung) is still comparatively low in Latin America, and decreasing trends continue for other cancer sites (including stomach, uterus, male lung cancers) in several countries. However, there were upward trends for colorectal cancer mortality for both sexes, and for lung and breast cancer mortality in women from most countries. During the last decade, lung cancer mortality in women rose by 1%-3% per year in all Latin American countries except Mexico and Costa Rica, whereas rises of about 1% were registered for breast cancer in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Moreover, high mortality from cancer of the cervix uteri was recorded in most countries, with rates over 13/100 000 women in Cuba and Venezuela. In men, upward trends were registered for prostate cancer mortality in Brazil and Colombia, but also in Cuba, where the rate in 2005-2009 was more than twice that of the USA (23.6 versus 10/100 000).

Consequently, it is difficult to ascertain the mechanism underlying these variants and to pinpoint the causal alleles. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) provide an organizing principle to address both of these issues. eQTLs are genetic loci that correlate with RNA transcript levels. Large-scale data sets such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provide an ideal opportunity to systematically evaluate eQTLs as they have generated multiple data types on hundreds of samples. We evaluated the determinants of gene expression (germline variants and somatic copy number and methylation) and performed cis-eQTL analyses for mRNA expression and miRNA expression in five tumor types (breast, colon, kidney, lung and prostate). We next tested 149 known cancer risk loci for eQTL effects, and observed that 42 (28.2%) were significantly associated with at least one transcript. Lastly, we described a fine-mapping strategy for these 42 eQTL target-gene associations based on an integrated strategy that combines the eQTL level of significance and the regulatory potential as measured by DNaseI hypersensitivity. For each of the risk loci, our analyses suggested 1 to 81 candidate causal variants that may be prioritized for downstream functional analysis.

Methods:   In the framework of a prospective mono-institutional phase II trial, EPIC questionnaire was dispensed (up to 1 year after treatment) to a cohort of 46 patients of 72 treated with 5 fractions of 7 Gy each to the prostate. SBRT was delivered with RapidArc VMAT with 10 MV flattening filter-free photon beams.  Results:   Median follow-up of patients was 14.5 months (range: 6-23). Acute rectal toxicity was mild (only 23/72 cases with G1-2 and no G3-4) as well as urinary (50/72 G1-2 and no G3-4). At the moment, four cases of G1 late rectal toxicity and 22 cases of G1 urinary (1 of G2) were reported. Urinary, rectal, sexual, and hormonal scores resulted stable over time: 1 year scores resulted, respectively, in -0.3, +2.8, -1.7, and -2.8 % variations with respect to baseline. No significant differences were observed also when data were stratified according to functional and bother sub-scales.  Conclusions:   Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment of prostate with RapidArc and high-intensity photon beams resulted to be well tolerated by patients with mild toxicity profiles and good patient-reported quality of life perception for the first year after treatment.

The aberrant glycans are produced by the combined actions of changed glycosylation enzymes, substrates and transporters in glycosylation synthesis pathways in cancer cells. To identify glycosylation enzymes associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PCa), we analyzed the difference in the expression of glycosyltransferase genes between aggressive and non-aggressive PCa. Three candidate genes encoding glycosyltransferases that were elevated in aggressive PCa were subsequently selected. The expression of the three candidates was then further evaluated in androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC3) PCa cell lines. We found that the protein expression of one of the glycosyltransferases, α (1,6) fucosyltransferase (FUT8), was only detected in PC3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells. We further showed that FUT8 protein expression was elevated in metastatic PCa tissues compared to normal prostate tissues. In addition, using tissue microarrays, we found that FUT8 overexpression was statistically associated with PCa with a high Gleason score. Using PC3 and LNCaP cells as models, we found that FUT8 overexpression in LNCaP cells increased PCa cell migration, while loss of FUT8 in PC3 cells decreased cell motility. Our results suggest that FUT8 may be associated with aggressive PCa and thus is potentially useful for its prognosis.""","""['Xiangchun Wang', 'Jing Chen', 'Qing Kay Li', 'Sarah B Peskoe', 'Bai Zhang', 'Caitlin Choi', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Hui Zhang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Glycobiology""","""['Overexpression of α (1,6) fucosyltransferase in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Fucosyltransferase 8 plays a crucial role in the invasion and metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'FUT8 Alpha-(1,6)-Fucosyltransferase in Cancer.', 'Quantitative proteomics reveals that enzymes of the ketogenic pathway are associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Glycans and cancer: role of N-glycans in cancer biomarker, progression and metastasis, and therapeutics.', 'Core fucosylation and its roles in gastrointestinal glycoimmunology.', 'Advances in protein glycosylation and its role in tissue repair and regeneration.', 'Beyond antibody fucosylation: α-(1,6)-fucosyltransferase (Fut8) as a potential new therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Inhibition of α(1,6)fucosyltransferase: Effects on Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Adhesion in an SW480/SW620 Syngeneic Colorectal Cancer Model.', 'Characterization of core fucosylation via sequential enzymatic treatments of intact glycopeptides and mass spectrometry analysis.']"""

We analyzed the association between cancer mortality risk and SUA level both as continuous variable and as tertiles: lowest <5 mg/dl (reference), middle 5-5.8 mg/dl, and highest >5.8 mg/dl, using multivariate Cox regression with adjustment for age, smoking (pack years), and body mass index.  Results:   Higher levels of SUA were associated with a lower risk of mortality from any cancer [HR (95 % CI) = 0.85 (0.73-0.97)]. SUA levels in the highest tertile (>5.8 mg/dl) were associated with a lower risk of mortality from any cancer [0.68 (0.48-0.97)].

In the present study, the anticancer action of 3-R-POD was addressed in colonic tumor cells. Treatment of Caco2 colonic tumor cells with increasing concentrations of 3-R-POD induced potent, dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth as measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In addition, the APOpercentage apoptosis assay revealed significant pro-apoptotic responses, suggesting that the anticancer activity of this steroidal Na(+)/K(+) ATPase inhibitor in colonic tumors takes places mainly through the induction of strong pro-apoptotic effects. Focussing on the molecular mechanism that may regulate these interactions, 3-R-POD was shown to induce significant early actin re-organization and late Protein Kinase B (AKT) de-phosphorylation. Finally, the 3-R-POD-induced inhibition of cell growth and early actin reorganization in colonic cancer cells remained unchanged when cells were pre-treated with pertussis toxin, thus excluding possible interactions of this inhibitor with G-coupled receptors.

The prevalent diagnosis method is based on the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test, which suffers from low specificity, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. In this work, untargeted metabolomic profiling of age-matched serum samples from prostate cancer patients and healthy individuals was performed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and machine learning methods. A metabolite-based in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay (IVDMIA) was developed to predict the presence of PCa in serum samples with high classification sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. A panel of 40 metabolic spectral features was found to be differential with 92.1% sensitivity, 94.3% specificity, and 93.0% accuracy. The performance of the IVDMIA was higher than the prevalent PSA test. Within the discriminant panel, 31 metabolites were identified by MS and MS/MS, with 10 further confirmed chromatographically by standards. Numerous discriminant metabolites were mapped in the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway. The identification of fatty acids, amino acids, lysophospholipids, and bile acids provided further insights into the metabolic alterations associated with the disease.

Material and methods:   Eighty-three patients with prior negative TRUS-bx scheduled for repeated biopsies due to persistent suspicion of PCa were prospectively enrolled. mp-MRI was performed before biopsy and all lesions were scored according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) and Likert classification. All underwent repeated TRUS-bx (10 cores) and mp-MRI-bx under visual TRUS guidance of any mp-MRI-suspicious lesion not targeted by systematic TRUS-bx.  Results:   PCa was found in 39 out of 83 patients (47%) and mp-MRI identified at least one lesion with some degree of suspicion in all 39 patients. Both PI-RADS and Likert scoring showed a high correlation between suspicion of malignancy and biopsy results (p < 0.0001). Five patients (13%) had cancer detected only on mp-MRI-bx outside the TRUS-bx areas (p = 0.025) and another seven patients (21%) had an overall Gleason score upgrade of at least one grade based on the mp-MRI-bx. Secondary PCa lesions not visible on mp-MRI were detected by TRUS-bx in six out of 39 PCa patients. The secondary foci were all Gleason 6 (3 + 3) in 5-10% of the biopsy core.

USP26 has also been recognized as a regulator of androgen receptor (AR) hormone-induced action involved in spermatogenesis and steroid production in in vitro studies. Prior mutation screening of USP26 demonstrated an association with human male infertility and low testosterone production, but protein localization and expression in the human testis has not been characterized previously. USP26 expression analysis of mRNA and protein was completed using murine and human testis tissue and human tissue arrays. USP26 and AR mRNA levels in human testis were quantitated using multiplex qRT-PCR. Immunofluorescence colocalization studies were performed with formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded and frozen tissues using primary and secondary antibodies to detect USP26 and AR protein expression. Human microarray dot blots were used to identify protein expression in extra-gonadal tissues. For the first time, expression of USP26 and colocalization of USP26 with androgen receptor in human testis has been confirmed predominantly in Leydig cell nuclei, with less in Leydig cell cytoplasm, spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, round spermatids, and Sertoli cells. USP26 likely affects regulatory proteins of early spermatogenesis, including androgen receptor with additional activity in round spermatids. This X-linked gene is not testis-specific, with USP26 mRNA and protein expression identified in multiple other human organ tissues (benign and malignant) including androgen-dependent tissues such as breast (myoepithelial cells and secretory luminal cells) and thyroid tissue (follicular cells).

These reports inspired us to design a fluorescence probe sensitive to protein α-helical structures to discriminate individual prostate cancer cells from normal ones.

The transition of androgen-dependent PCa to castration-resistant (CRPC) is a major clinical manifestation during disease progression and presents a therapeutic challenge. Our studies have shown that genetic ablation of inhibitor of differentiation 4 (Id4), a dominant-negative helix loop helix protein, in mice results in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions and decreased Nkx3.1 expression without the loss of androgen receptor (Ar) expression. ID4 is also epigenetically silenced in the majority of PCa. However, the clinical relevance and molecular pathways altered by ID4 inactivation in PCa are not known. This study investigates the effect of loss of ID4 in PCa cell lines on tumorigenicity and addresses the underlying mechanism. Stable silencing of ID4 in LNCaP cells (L-ID4) resulted in increased proliferation, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. An increase in the rate of tumor growth, weight, and volume was observed in L-ID4 xenografts compared with that in the LNCaP cells transfected with nonspecific short hairpin RNA (L+ns) in noncastrated mice. Interestingly, tumors were also observed in castrated mice, suggesting that loss of ID4 promotes CRPC. RNA sequence analysis revealed a gene signature mimicking that of constitutively active AR in L-ID4, which was consistent with gain of de novo steroidogenesis. Prostate-specific antigen expression as a result of persistent AR activation was observed in L-ID4 cells but not in L+ns cells. The results demonstrate that ID4 acts as a tumor suppressor in PCa, and its loss, frequently observed in PCa, promotes CRPC through constitutive AR activation.""","""['Divya Patel', 'Ashley E Knowell', 'Maxwell Korang-Yeboah', 'Pankaj Sharma', 'Jugal Joshi', 'Shanora Glymph', 'Swathi Chinaranagari', 'Peri Nagappan', 'Ravi Palaniappan', 'Nathan J Bowen', 'Jaideep Chaudhary']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Inactivation of ID4 promotes a CRPC phenotype with constitutive AR activation through FKBP52.', 'Id4 deficiency attenuates prostate development and promotes PIN-like lesions by regulating androgen receptor activity and expression of NKX3.1 and PTEN.', 'A low carbohydrate, high protein diet suppresses intratumoral androgen synthesis and slows castration-resistant prostate tumor growth in mice.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'The helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator Id4 is required for terminal differentiation of luminal epithelial cells in the prostate.', 'ID4 Promotes Breast Cancer Chemotherapy Resistance via CBF1-MRP1 Pathway.', 'Deciphering GRINA/Lifeguard1: Nuclear Location, Ca2+ Homeostasis and Vesicle Transport.', 'Prognostic values of the inhibitor of DNA‑binding family members in breast cancer.', 'Upregulation of CYP17A1 by Sp1-mediated DNA demethylation confers temozolomide resistance through DHEA-mediated protection in glioma.']"""

Although the staining characteristics of the individual components of the PIN-4 cocktail have been reported for NA, no study has described the expression patterns for NA when the stains are applied as a cocktail.

Immunohistochemical analysis with the PIN-4 cocktail and GATA-3 antibodies was performed, and the distribution and intensity of staining was recorded for each antibody in each case. PIN-4 cocktail staining revealed AMACR expression in 56% of cases, CK903 expression in 97%, and rare p63 positivity (in only 2 cases). Only 2 NA cases displayed an overall PIN-4 staining pattern compatible with prostate cancer. GATA-3 expression was noted in 40% of NAs. No correlation between AMACR, CK903, or GATA-3 positivity and histologic pattern or anatomic location was identified. Although heterogenous staining patterns were seen within individual cases, use of the PIN-4 cocktail effectively discriminates NA from prostate cancer because of the high frequency of coexpression of AMACR and CK903 within NA.

Both methods provide consistent significant cut-point values, with the rank sum method displaying some sensitivity to the underlying data.

Sexual self-schema (SSS) is a cognitive generalization about sexual aspects of the self that are associated with sexual behavior, affect, and the processing of sexually relevant information. This study tested if men's SSS moderates the impact of sexual morbidity on depressive symptoms.  Methods:   Men (N = 66) treated for localized prostate cancer in the preceding 2 years were assessed at T1 and 4 months later (T2). Questionnaires included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Sexual Self-schema Scale for Men, Sexual Experience Scale, and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite.  Results:   Regressions controlled for age, sexual activity, and T1 depressive symptoms revealed no significant effect of SSS on depressive symptoms; however, better sexual functioning was related to fewer depressive symptoms (B = -0.25, p < 0.05). Results showed significant interactions between SSS and sexual outcomes. Among men with high SSS, poor sexual functioning was associated with increased depressive symptoms; loss of sexual function was particularly distressing. There was no significant effect of sexual functioning. Among men with high SSS, there was an inverse relationship between sexual engagement and depressive symptoms. Among men with lower SSS, greater frequency of sexual behavior was associated with increased depressive symptoms.

Methods:   Non-castrate patients with up to 3 synchronous metastases (bone and/or lymph nodes) diagnosed on positron emission tomography - computed tomography, following biochemical recurrence after local curative treatment, were treated with (repeated) SBRT to a dose of 50 Gy in 10 fractions or 30 Gy in 3 fractions. Androgen deprivation therapy-free survival (ADT-FS) defined as the time interval between the first day of SBRT and the initiation of ADT was the primary endpoint. ADT was initiated if more than 3 metastases were detected during follow-up even when patients were still asymptomatic. Secondary endpoints were local control, progression free survival (PFS) and toxicity. Toxicity was scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.  Results:   With a median follow-up from time of SBRT of 2 years, we treated 50 patients with 70 metastatic lesions with a local control rate of 100%. The primary involved metastatic sites were lymph nodes (54%), bone (44%), and viscera (2%). The median PFS was 19 mo (95% CI: 13-25 mo) with 75% of recurring patients having ≤3 metastases. A 2nd and 3rd course of SBRT was delivered in 19 and 6 patients respectively. This results in a median ADT-FS of 25 months (20-30 mo). On univariate analysis, only a short PSA doubling time was a significant predictor for both PFS (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82 - 0.99) and ADT-FS (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71 - 0.97).

Lack of comprehensive systems to study the progression of metastasis contributes to the low success of treatment. We developed a novel three-dimensional in vitro reconstructed metastasis (rMet) model that incorporates extracellular matrix (ECM) elements characteristic of the primary (breast, prostate, or lung) and metastatic (bone marrow, BM) sites. A cytokine-rich liquid interphase separates the primary and distant sites, further recapitulating circulation. Similar to main events underlying the metastatic cascade, the rMet model fractionated human tumor cell lines into sub-populations with distinct invasive and migratory abilities: (i) a primary tumor-like fraction mainly consisting of non-migratory spheroids; (ii) an invasive fraction that invaded through the primary tumor ECM, but failed to acquire anchorage-independence and reach the BM; and (iii) a highly migratory BM-colonizing population that invaded the primary ECM, survived in the ""circulation-like"" media, and successfully invaded and proliferated within BM ECM. BM-colonizing fractions successfully established metastatic bone lesions in vivo, whereas the tumor-like spheroids failed to engraft the bones, showing the ability of the rMet model to faithfully select for highly aggressive sub-populations with a propensity to colonize a metastatic site. By applying the rMet model to study real-time ECM remodeling, we show that tumor cells secrete collagenolytic enzymes for invading the primary site ECM but not for entering the BM ECM, indicating possible differences in ECM remodeling mechanisms at primary tumor versus metastatic sites.""","""['Mukti R Parikh', 'Kayla E Minser', 'Laura M Rank', 'Carlotta A Glackin', 'Julia Kirshner']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biotechnol J""","""['In vitro model of metastasis to bone marrow mediates prostate cancer castration resistant growth through paracrine and extracellular matrix factors.', 'Extracellular matrix mediators of metastatic cell colonization characterized using scaffold mimics of the pre-metastatic niche.', 'The extracellular matrix in tumor progression and metastasis.', 'One size does not fit all: developing a cell-specific niche for in vitro study of cell behavior.', 'Extracellular Matrix Alterations in Metastatic Processes.', 'Engineered models to parse apart the metastatic cascade.', '1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D Inhibits the Metastatic Capability of MCF10CA1a and MDA-MB-231 Cells in an In Vitro Model of Breast to Bone Metastasis.', 'The Predictive Link between Matrix and Metastasis.', 'Synthetic Capillaries to Control Microscopic Blood Flow.']"""

Previous studies have shown that genetic components influence the levels of PSA, and some of these genetic components would lead to better diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to PCa. However, genetic studies for PSA from Asian countries are limited. Our aim was to identify genetic components influencing PSA levels in the Japanese population using genome-wide association study (GWAS) and to analyse whether genetic components would lead to better screening abilities of PCa.  Methods:   We performed a GWAS comprising 1086 male subjects using 303 283 single nucleotide proteins, followed by a replication study of 1302 subjects. PSA levels were quantified by chemiluminescence immunoassay method. Quantitative linear regression analysis was performed to assess genetic components of PSA levels. A total of 413 subjects with prostate biopsies were analysed to examine whether genetic determinants would improve diagnostic ability.  Results:   Rs16856139 in SLC45A3, the same region as the previous Chinese study, showed an overall significant association with PSA levels (p=2.4×10(-11)) along with rs1058205 in KLK3. In silico analysis revealed significant association between rs16856139 and expression of SLC45A3. Genetic scores of PSA showed a dose-dependent decrease of area under curve (AUC) of PCa and successfully subgrouped the individuals with significantly different AUC (p≤0.0097).

Like hypoxia-inducible hyper-vascularization, loss of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a trait common to advanced stages of tumor progression in many metastatic cancers. However, no link between the role of Rb and hypoxia-driven metastatic processes has been established. We demonstrated that Rb is a key mediator of the hypoxic response mediated by HIF1α/β, the master regulator of the hypoxia response, and its essential co-activator, the thyroid hormone receptor/retinoblastoma-interacting protein (TRIP230). Furthermore, loss of Rb unmasks the full co-activation potential of TRIP230. Using small inhibitory RNA approaches in vivo, we established that Rb attenuates the normal physiological response to hypoxia by HIF1α. Notably, loss of Rb results in hypoxia-dependent biochemical changes that promote acquisition of an invasive phenotype in MCF7 breast cancer cells. In addition, Rb is present in HIF1α-ARNT/HIF1β transcriptional complexes associated with TRIP230 as determined by co-immuno-precipitation, GST-pull-down and ChIP assays. These results demonstrate that Rb is a negative modulator of hypoxia-regulated transcription by virtue of its direct effects on the HIF1 complex.

To inform public health approaches to promoting early symptomatic presentation, we aimed to identify risk factors for delay in presentation across several cancers.  Methods:   We surveyed 2371 patients with 15 cancers about nature and duration of symptoms using a postal questionnaire. We calculated relative risks for delay in presentation (time from symptom onset to first presentation >3 months) by cancer, symptoms leading to diagnosis and reasons for putting off going to the doctor, controlling for age, sex and deprivation group.  Results:   Among 1999 cancer patients reporting symptoms, 21% delayed presentation for >3 months. Delay was associated with greater socioeconomic deprivation but not age or sex. Patients with prostate (44%) and rectal cancer (37%) were most likely to delay and patients with breast cancer least likely to delay (8%). Urinary difficulties, change of bowel habit, systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss and loss of appetite) and skin symptoms were all common and associated with delay. Overall, patients with bleeding symptoms were no more likely to delay presentation than patients who did not have bleeding symptoms. However, within the group of patients with bleeding symptoms, there were significant differences in risk of delay by source of bleeding: 35% of patients with rectal bleeding delayed presentation, but only 9% of patients with urinary bleeding. A lump was a common symptom but not associated with delay in presentation. Twenty-eight percent had not recognised their symptoms as serious and this was associated with a doubling in risk of delay. Embarrassment, worry about what the doctor might find, being too busy to go to the doctor and worry about wasting the doctor's time were also strong risk factors for delay, but were much less commonly reported (<6%).  Interpretation:   Approaches to promote early presentation should aim to increase awareness of the significance of cancer symptoms and should be designed to work for people of the lowest socioeconomic status. In particular, awareness that rectal bleeding is a possible symptom of cancer should be raised.""","""['L J L Forbes', 'F Warburton', 'M A Richards', 'A J Ramirez']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Which symptoms are linked to a delayed presentation among melanoma patients?

Throughout Brazil there was an increase in the magnitude of mortality rates during the study's period. In the Central-West Region, mortality rates from prostate cancer increased from 7.65/100,000 in the period 1980 - 1983, to 14.36/100,000 in the last four years, exceeding the national average. For Mato Grosso do Sul, an increased trend, although not constant, was observed for prostate mortality rates, while those rates showed stability for Mato Grosso and presented a constant trend of increment for Goiás along the studied period. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between mortality rates from prostate cancer and the proportional mortality from ill-defined causes of death in the three states, but no correlations were observed between these rates and the ratios of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) tests realized. Difficulties in the access to the health services network, better quality of death records with reduction of ill-defined causes and increased use of PSA may have contributed to the mortality pattern observed in the Central-West Region.

Methods:   Charts from consecutive radical prostatectomy patients of 3 experienced urologists from January 1999 to December 2005 were reviewed. In addition to the usual clinical and pathologic predictors of disease recurrence, patient records were queried for the type of anesthesia (general vs spinal) performed. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the statistical significance of predictors of biochemical recurrence.  Results:   A total of 1964 patients-1166 and 798 receiving spinal with sedation or general anesthesia, respectively-had complete preoperative and follow-up data.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of PCPTHG for predicting high-grade CaP was 0.676 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.592-0.751). By using a risk cutoff of ≥15% for biopsy as, proposed previously for high-grade CaP, sensitivity was 96.4%, specificity was 7.6%, and the false-positive rate was 51.1%. In contrast, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of MP-MRI for high-grade CaP was 0.769 (95% CI, 0.703-0.834), and it was 0.812 (95% CI, 0.754-0.869) for clinically significant CaP.

In the Göteborg study, the reduction in mortality in the screening group during the median 14 years of follow-up was very high at 44%, based on intention-to-screen analysis. The merits of introducing PSA-based screening could be mortality reduction and prevention of progression to metastatic disease, which could decrease patient quality of life (QOL). Furthermore, the impact of screening for prostate cancer on mortality reduction was not inferior to that of the other population- based cancer screening program conducted in Japan, at the least. Therefore, PSA-based screening should be undertaken both as part of population-based screening and as part of opportunistic screening in Japan. However, as disadvantages, some participants in the screening program might be at risk of over detection and overtreatment. Therefore, providing a fact sheet for prostate cancer screening and an optimal screening system with more accurate detection methods, minimally invasive treatment, and an active surveillance strategy, which minimizes over detection, overtreatment, and a compromise in QOL due to treatment, would be very important issues to address for PSA screening. Although the merits of screening for prostate cancer would increase and the disadvantages would decrease in future, with the progress in diagnostic modalities and treatment strategies, it is crucial that PSA-based screening be conducted in accordance with well-balanced guidelines published by the Japanese Urological Association.""","""['Kazuto Ito']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Gan To Kagaku Ryoho""","""['Screening for prostate cancer: an up date.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: present status and future perspectives.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: clinical significance and future perspectives.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: the current evidence and guidelines controversy.', 'Landmarks in prostate cancer screening.']"""

Here, we evaluate the scope of global epigenetic alterations at enhancers and insulator elements in prostate and breast cancer cells using simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy (NOMe-seq). We find that the genomic location of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) is mostly cell type specific and preferentially found at enhancers in normal cells. In cancer cells, however, we observe a global reconfiguration of NDRs at distal regulatory elements coupled with a substantial reorganization of the cancer methylome. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Remarkably, we show that nucleosomes remain strongly organized and phased at many facultative distal regulatory elements, even in the absence of a NDR as an anchor. Finally, we find that key transcription factor (TF) binding sites also show extensive peripheral nucleosome phasing, suggesting the potential for TFs to organize NDRs genome-wide and contribute to deregulation of cancer epigenomes. Together, our findings suggest that ""decommissioning"" of NDRs and TFs at distal regulatory elements in cancer cells is accompanied by DNA hypermethylation susceptibility of enhancers and insulator elements, which in turn may contribute to an altered genome-wide architecture and epigenetic deregulation in malignancy.""","""['Phillippa C Taberlay', 'Aaron L Statham', 'Theresa K Kelly', 'Susan J Clark', 'Peter A Jones']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Genome Res""","""['Defining Regulatory Elements in the Human Genome Using Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome Sequencing (NOMe-Seq).', 'Dynamic nucleosome-depleted regions at androgen receptor enhancers in the absence of ligand in prostate cancer cells.', 'OCT4 establishes and maintains nucleosome-depleted regions that provide additional layers of epigenetic regulation of its target genes.', 'Nucleosome positioning in yeasts: methods, maps, and mechanisms.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Increased chromatin accessibility facilitates intron retention in specific cell differentiation states.', 'Nucleosome-Omics: A Perspective on the Epigenetic Code and 3D Genome Landscape.', 'BAF complex-mediated chromatin relaxation is required for establishment of X chromosome inactivation.', 'Whole-genome methods to define DNA and histone accessibility and long-range interactions in chromatin.', 'Universal annotation of the human genome through integration of over a thousand epigenomic datasets.']"""

We modeled the incidence of Gleason 8-10 cancer and used logistic regression analysis to evaluate the effects of baseline predictors of PCa, as well as post-baseline prostate volume at the time of biopsy, on PCa diagnosis. We compared needle biopsy Gleason scores with corresponding surgery Gleason scores. All statistical tests conducted were 2-sided.  Results:   Had there been a scheduled biopsy occurring only at year 4, we estimated a similar incidence of Gleason 8-10 PCa in the dutasteride (n = 45) and placebo (n = 46) groups. Two biopsy Gleason 7 cancers in the placebo group (n = 150) were upgraded to Gleason 8-10 cancer on prostatectomy, and no patients in the dutasteride group (n = 111) were upgraded.

Materials and methods:   Overall, 205,551 patients with PCa diagnosed between 1988 and 2009 within the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database were included in the study. Patients were stratified according to age at diagnosis: ≤ 50, 51-60, 61-70, and ≥ 71 years. The 15-year cumulative incidence CSM rates were computed.

Methods:   Twenty-eight cases were collected from 2004 to 2012;microscopic pathologic examinations and immunohistochemistry (EnVision method) were performed.  Results:   (1) All except one patients were female, ranging from 16 to 77 years old (average 45.8 years). Twenty-six (92.9%) patients initially presented with the primary site lesions; while the other two (7.1%) patients initially presented with breast lesions. The mean interval from primary diagnosis to detection of metastatic breast lesions was 32 months (0-228 months). Fifteen patients (53.6%) had other metastases detected simultaneously or preceded the breast lesions. (2) Macroscopically, all the tumors were relatively circumscribed, with a mean diameter of 4.0 cm (0.6-12.0 cm). The histological types of the corresponding primary tumors were as follows: eight (28.6%) cases from lung adenocarcinoma, five (17.8%) from high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma, three (10.7%) from gastric adenocarcinoma, two (7.1%) from rectal adenocarcinoma, one (3.6%) from pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, one (3.6%) from prostatic carcinoma, four (14.3%) from melanoma, and four (14.3%) from mesenchymal malignant tumors (three rhabdomyosarcomas and one epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, MPNST). (3) Histologically, the metastatic tumors showed the morphologic characteristics of the primary tumors. Lymph-vascular invasion was observed in 19 cases. Immunohistochemical features of metastatic tumors were consistent with the primary tumors. Molecular markers for breast such as GCDFP15 and mammaglobin were negative. Metastatic tumors from lung adenocarcinoma expressed TTF-1 (8/8). Ovarian serous carcinoma metastases were positive for PAX8 (5/5) and WT1 (4/5). Gastric adenocarcinoma metastases were positive for CDX2 (3/3) and villin (1/3). Rectal adenocarcinoma metastases were positive for CDX2 (2/2). Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor metastasis was positive for Syn and CgA (both 1/1). Prostate carcinoma metastasis was positive for AR, PSA and P504S (all 1/1). Melanoma metastases were positive for HMB45 (2/3) and S-100 protein (3/3). Rhabdomyosarcoma metastases were positive for vimentin, desmin and myoD1 (all 3/3). MPNST metastasis was positive for S-100 protein (1/1). (4) Follow-up data was available in 17 patients, with median follow-up time 54 months. The median survival from diagnosis to breast metastasis was 24 months.Seven of 17 patients died.  Conclusions:   Metastases to the breast from non-mammary malignancies are rare and show pathologic features of primary tumors. It is usually presumed to be a primary breast carcinoma. Histopathologic features and clinical history in conjunction with the immunohistochemical results should be considered in differentiating a secondary mass from a primary breast carcinoma.""","""['Shuling Zhou', 'Baohua Yu', 'Yufan Cheng', 'Xiaoli Xu', 'Ruohong Shui', 'Rui Bi', 'Hongfen Lu', 'Xiaoyu Tu', 'Wentao Yang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi""","""['Serous carcinoma of the ovary and peritoneum with metastases to the breast and axillary lymph nodes: a potential pitfall.', 'Folliculotropic Cutaneous Metastases and Lymphangitis Carcinomatosa: When Cutaneous Metastases of Breast Carcinoma Are Mistaken for Cutaneous Infections.', 'Clinicopathologic features of primary renal neuroendocrine carcinoma.', 'Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast:report of 25 cases.', 'Metastatic serous carcinoma presenting as inflammatory carcinoma over the breast-Report of two cases and literature review.', 'Imaging Findings of Breast Metastasis from Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor of Mediastinum: A Case Report.', 'A Rare Case of Fallopian Tube Metastasis Presenting as a Solitary Breast Mass.', 'Breast metastases from primary tumor of the urinary tract: case series.', 'Ovarian Cancer Metastasis to the Breast: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.', 'Cutaneous and breast metastasis from colorectal adenocarcinoma: A rare case report.']"""

In the Drosophila embryo, Twist is essential for discrete events in gastrulation and mesodermal patterning. In this study, we derive a twi allelic series by examining the various cellular events required for gastrulation in Drosophila. By genetically manipulating the levels of Twi activity during gastrulation, we find that coordination of cell division is the most sensitive cellular event, whereas changes in cell shape are the least sensitive. Strikingly, we show that by increasing levels of Snail expression in a severe twi hypomorphic allelic background, but not a twi null background, we can reconstitute gastrulation and produce viable adult flies.

WJ35435, a new hybrid of vorinostat and DACA (a topoisomerase inhibitor) potently inhibited HDAC activity (in particular HDAC1 and HDAC6) in kinase assay and cell-based examination. The anti-HDAC effect was confirmed by the induction of histone H3 acetylation and phosphorylation, α-tubulin acetylation and γ-H2AX formation. WJ35435 showed better potency than vorinostat and DACA against PC-3 and DU-145, two human hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer (HRMPC) cell lines, but not benign prostate cells. WJ35435 at differential concentrations induced G1- or G2-phase arrest of the cell cycle in HRMPCs but not in benign prostate cells. WJ35435 induced the formation of topoisomerase I-DNA cleavable complexes but not type-IIα or -IIβ. Topoisomerase activity assay confirmed the selective inhibition of topoisomerase I.

However, the molecular mechanism of Pin1 overexpression in prostate cancer is still unclear. In the present study, we showed that the mRNA expression levels of Pin1 were not correlated with Pin1 protein levels in prostate cell lines which indicated that Pin1 may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. A key player in post-transcriptional regulation is represented by microRNAs (miRNAs) that negatively regulate expressions of protein-coding genes at the post-transcriptional level. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-296-5p has a conserved binding site in the Pin1 3'-untranslated region (UTR). A luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that the seed region of miR-296-5p directly interacts with the 3'-UTR of Pin1 mRNA. Moreover, miR-296-5p expression was found to be inversely correlated with Pin1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and prostate cancer tissues. Furthermore, restoration of miR-296-5p or the knockdown of Pin1 had the same effect on the inhibition of the ability of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer cell lines.

The initial leaf trajectories were generated using a typical leaf-setting algorithm, then the leaf trajectories were adjusted by Delta algorithm operations (analytical computations and a series of matrix calculations) to achieve the optimal solution. The performance of the Delta algorithm was evaluated with six test fields (with randomly generated intensity profiles) and 15 clinical fields from IMRT plans of three prostate cancer patients. Compared with the initial solution, the Delta algorithm kept the total delivered intensities (TDIs) constant (without increasing the beam delivery time), but improved marker visibility (the percentage ratio of marker visibility time to beam delivery time). For the artificial fields (with three markers), marker visibility increased from 68.00-72.00% for a small field (5 × 5), from 38.46-43.59% for a medium field (10 × 10), and from 28.57-37.14% for a large field (20 × 20). For the 15 clinical fields, marker visibility increased 6-30% for eight fields and > 50% for two fields but did not change for five fields.

We report that melatonin receptor 1 inhibits mobilization of L1 in cultured cells through downregulation of L1 mRNA and ORF1 protein. The addition of melatonin receptor antagonists abolishes the MT1 effect on retrotransposition in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, melatonin-rich, but not melatonin-poor, human blood collected at different times during the circadian cycle suppresses endogenous L1 mRNA during in situ perfusion of tissue-isolated xenografts of human cancer. Supplementation of human blood with exogenous melatonin or melatonin receptor antagonist during the in situ perfusion establishes a receptor-mediated action of melatonin on L1 expression. Combined tissue culture and in vivo data support that environmental light exposure of the host regulates expression of L1 elements in tumors.

However, data assessing the utility of PET in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is limited to isolated case reports. Herein, we describe the first case series to assess the utility of FDG-PET in NEPC.  Methods:   Inclusion criteria consisted of clinically progressive metastatic PCA in the setting of a chromogranin-A levels >1.5× the upper limit of normal, and ≥1 FDG-PET scan after the diagnosis of NEPC, which yielded 23 patients. All metastatic lesions on CT, PET, and bone scan were read by two independent physicians.  Results:   Five hundred ninety two unique lesions were identified across all imaging modalities, 510 were bone metastases, and 82 were soft tissue metastases. Of bone lesions, 22.2%, 92.7%, and 77.6% were detected by PET, CT, and bone scan, respectively. Of soft tissue lesions, 95.1% and 97.5% were detected by PET and CT, respectively. Stratified by the median survival from NEPC diagnosis, patients who survived <2.2 versus ≥2.2 years had more PET avid bone (8 vs. 2, P = 0.06) and soft tissue lesions (7 vs. 1, P = 0.01), and higher average SUVmax of bone (5.49 vs. 3.40, P = 0.04) and soft tissue lesions (8.02 vs. 3.90, P = 0.0002).  Conclusions:   In patients with clinical NEPC, we demonstrate that FDG-PET has clinical utility in the detection of metastatic disease. In addition to detection, PET allows for treatment response to determine tumor viability. With novel therapies on the horizon to treat NEPC, consideration to investigate the use of FDG-PET to monitor response is warranted.""","""['Daniel E Spratt', 'Somali Gavane', 'Lisa Tarlinton', 'Shoaib B Fareedy', 'Michael G Doran', 'Michael J Zelefsky', 'Joseph R Osborne']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Combined 18F-FDG and 11C-methionine PET scans in patients with newly progressive metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Fluorinated deoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging in progressive metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Positron emission tomography and bone metastases.', 'Miscellaneous cancers (lung, thyroid, renal cancer, myeloma, and neuroendocrine tumors): role of SPECT and PET in imaging bone metastases.', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'PET radiotracers for whole-body in vivo molecular imaging of prostatic neuroendocrine malignancies.', 'The role of glutamine metabolism in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Subtype and Site Specific-Induced Metabolic Vulnerabilities in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Lentiviral shRNA stable knock down of c-MYC, β-catenin, or TCF-4 completely inhibits normal (i.e., non-transformed) human PrECs growth. c-MYC enhancer driven reporter expression and growth is inhibited by two chemically distinct molecules, which prevent β-catenin signaling either by blocking TCF-4 binding (i.e., toxoflavin) or by stimulating degradation (i.e., AVX939). Recombinant DKK1 protein at a dose, which inhibits activation of canonical Wnt signaling does not inhibit PrEC growth. Nuclear β-catenin translocation and PrEC growth is prevented by both lack of PGFs or Akt inhibitor-I. Growth inhibition induced by lack of PGFs, toxoflavin, or Akt inhibitor-I is overcome by constitutive c-MYC transcription.  Results:   In the presence of continuous PGF signaling, PrEC hyperplasia is prevented by androgen binding to AR suppressing c-MYC transcription, resulting in G0 arrest/terminal differentiation independent of Rb, p21, p27, FoxP3, or down regulation of growth factors receptors and instead involves androgen-induced formation of AR/β-catenin/TCF-4 complexes, which suppress c-MYC transcription. Such suppression does not occur when AR is mutated in its zinc-finger binding domain.  Discussion:   Proliferation of non-transformed human PrECs is dependent upon c-MYC transcription via formation/binding of β-catenin/TCF-4 complexes at both 5' and 3' c-MYC enhancers stimulated by Wnt-independent, PGF induced Akt signaling. In the presence of continuous PGF signaling, PrEC hyperplasia is prevented by androgen-induced formation of AR/β-catenin/TCF-4 complexes, which retains binding to 3' c-MYC enhancer, but now suppresses c-MYC transcription.""","""['Lizamma Antony', 'Freek van der Schoor', 'Susan L Dalrymple', 'John T Isaacs']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Conversion of androgen receptor signaling from a growth suppressor in normal prostate epithelial cells to an oncogene in prostate cancer cells involves a gain of function in c-Myc regulation.', 'Effects of WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation on signaling through T-cell factor and androgen receptor in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Regulation of myogenic differentiation by androgens: cross talk between androgen receptor/ beta-catenin and follistatin/transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathways.', 'Resolving the Coffey Paradox: what does the androgen receptor do in normal vs. malignant prostate epithelial cells?', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy: When Excess Fuel Extinguishes the Fire.', 'Consequence of evolutionary loss of seasonal breeding by humans for prostate cancer chemoprevention.', 'Androgen receptor inhibits the hair follicle induction potential of dermal papilla cells by binding with Tcf4 at the A574 binding site.', 'Antagonistic Functions of Androgen Receptor and NF-κB in Prostate Cancer-Experimental and Computational Analyses.', 'The testosterone paradox of advanced prostate cancer: mechanistic insights and clinical implications.']"""

The study population consisted of 156 patients who underwent RP and received salvage HT for BCR. The starting point of this study was the timing of RP, and the endpoint was biochemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (castration-resistance) after HT. The mean follow-up period after surgery was 8.1 years. First, we excluded 18 patients with persistent PSA (≥ 0.2 ng/mL) after RP from an analysis below because their prognoses were significantly poorer compared with 138 patients whose PSA nadirs had reached <0.2 ng/mL. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that Gleason score ≥ 8 (p = 0.010, hazard ratio (HR) 3.02), and PSA doubling time (PSA-DT) <6 months (p = 0.001, HR 7.39) was independently associated with subsequent biochemical progression after HT. Using these two variables (Gleason score and PSA-DT), we could stratify patients into three risk groups for BCR after salvage HT. Regarding the optimal timing for HT administration for these high-risk patients with both risk factors (relative risk = 22.3), the PSA cutpoint of 1.0 ng/mL at the initiation of HT showed a significant difference in progression-free survival rates (p = 0.023).

A small Japanese cohort study previously reported that pre-diagnostic serum transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) concentration, a potential marker of subclinical pancreatic inflammation, was associated with higher risk of pancreatic cancer. We further explored this association in a larger prospective study.  Methods:   Serum TGF-β1 concentrations were measured in pre-diagnostic samples from 729 pancreatic cancer cases and 907 matched controls from a cohort of Finnish male smokers (the Alpa-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study) and two cohorts of US men and women, the Cancer Prevention Study-II and the Prostate Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.  Results:   Overall, serum TGF-β1 concentration was not associated with a clear increase in pancreatic cancer risk (OR 1.36, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.88 for highest vs. lowest quintile, p trend = 0.20). However, this association differed significantly by follow-up time (p = 0.02). Serum TGF-β1 concentration was not associated with risk during the first 10 years of follow-up, but was associated with higher risk during follow-up after 10 years (OR 2.13, 95 % CI 1.23-3.68 for highest vs. lowest quintile, p trend = 0.001). During follow-up after 10 years, serum TGF-β1 was associated with higher risk only in the ATBC cohort, although most subjects were from ATBC during this time period and statistical evidence for heterogeneity across cohorts was limited (p = 0.14).  Conclusions:   These results suggest that high serum TGF-β1 may be associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer although a long follow-up period may be needed to observe this association.""","""['Eric J Jacobs', 'Christina C Newton', 'Debra T Silverman', 'Leticia M Nogueira', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Satu Männistö', 'Michael Pollak', 'Rachael Z Stolzenberg-Solomon']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Serum transforming growth factor-beta1 levels and pancreatic cancer risk: a nested case-control study (Japan).', 'Circulating Leptin and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer: A Pooled Analysis From 3 Cohorts.', 'Vitamin E intake, alpha-tocopherol status, and pancreatic cancer in a cohort of male smokers.', 'Serum C-reactive protein and risk of pancreatic cancer in two nested, case-control studies.', 'Changes of transforming growth factor beta 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy: A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Role of Circulating Protein and Metabolite Biomarkers in the Development of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC): A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Serum Insulin-Like Growth Factor Axis and the Risk of Pancreatic Cancer: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'TAp73 loss favors Smad-independent TGF-β signaling that drives EMT in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Epidemiology and Inherited Predisposition for Sporadic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.', 'TGF-β Blockade Reduces Mortality and Metabolic Changes in a Validated Murine Model of Pancreatic Cancer Cachexia.']"""

Down-stream mediators of CB1 receptor signaling in prostate cancer are known, but information on potential upstream regulators is lacking.  Results:   Data from a well-characterized tumor tissue microarray were used for a Bayesian network analysis using the max-min hill-climbing method. In non-malignant tissue samples, a directionality of pEGFR (the phosphorylated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor) → CB1 receptors were found regardless as to whether the endocannabinoid metabolizing enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) was included as a parameter. A similar result was found in the tumor tissue, but only when FAAH was included in the analysis. A second regulatory pathway, from the growth factor receptor ErbB2 → FAAH was also identified in the tumor samples. Transfection of AT1 prostate cancer cells with CB1 receptors induced a sensitivity to the growth-inhibiting effects of the CB receptor agonist CP55,940. The sensitivity was not dependent upon the level of receptor expression. Thus a high CB1 receptor expression alone does not drive the cells towards a survival phenotype in the presence of a CB receptor agonist.  Conclusions:   The data identify two potential regulators of the endocannabinoid system in prostate cancer and allow the construction of a model of a dysregulated endocannabinoid signaling network in this tumor.

Methods:   Clinically pathological analysis of immunohistochemistry/in situ hybridization was carried out to detect the relationship between PACE4 expression/miRNAs and the malignancy of prostate mass. Prostate cell lines (DU145, C4-2, and BPH-1) were cultured for growth curve, immunocytochemistry analysis, colony formation, Matrigel invasion, and transcriptional/translational expression assay of PACE4-related signaling molecules for confirming the relationship. MiRNAs targeting PACE4 were predicted, validated and further-corroborated using bio-software, real-time PCR, luciferase reporter assay and transfection of miRNA mimics and inhibitor.  Results:   It was suggested that PACE4 might reflect the pathological malignancy of prostate lesion from pathology analysis.

Furthermore, activations of the AR, PI3K, mTOR, NFκB and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways are involved in the fatal development of castration-resistant prostate cancer during androgen ablation therapy. MID1, a negative regulator of the tumor-suppressor PP2A, is known to promote PI3K, mTOR, NFκB and Hh signaling. Here we investigate the interaction of MID1 and AR.  Methods:   AR and MID1 mRNA and protein levels were measured by qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by PCR and RNA-pull-down followed by Western blot was used to investigate protein-mRNA interaction, chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing for identification of AR chromatin binding sites. AR transcriptional activity and activity of promoter binding sites for AR were analyzed by reporter gene assays. For knockdown or overexpression of proteins of interest prostate cancer cells were transfected with siRNA or expression plasmids, respectively.  Results:   The microtubule-associated MID1 protein complex associates with AR mRNA via purine-rich trinucleotide repeats, expansions of which are known to correlate with ataxia and cancer. The level of MID1 directly correlates with the AR protein level in PCa cells. Overexpression of MID1 results in a several fold increase in AR protein and activity without major changes in mRNA-levels, whereas siRNA-triggered knockdown of MID1 mRNA reduces AR-protein levels significantly. Upregulation of AR protein by MID1 occurs via increased translation as no major changes in AR protein stability could be observed. AR on the other hand, regulates MID1 via several functional AR binding sites in the MID1 gene, and, in the presence of androgens, exerts a negative feedback loop on MID1 transcription. Thus, androgen withdrawal increases MID1 and concomitantly AR-protein levels. In line with this, MID1 is significantly over-expressed in PCa in a stage-dependent manner.  Conclusion:   Promotion of AR, in addition to enhancement of the Akt-, NFκB-, and Hh-pathways by sustained MID1-upregulation during androgen deprivation therapy provides a powerful proliferative scenario for PCa progression into castration resistance. Thus MID1 represents a novel, multi-faceted player in PCa and a promising target to treat castration resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Andrea Köhler', 'Ummühan Demir', 'Eva Kickstein', 'Sybille Krauss', 'Johanna Aigner', 'Beatriz Aranda-Orgillés', 'Antonios I Karagiannidis', 'Clemens Achmüller', 'Huajie Bu', 'Andrea Wunderlich', 'Michal-Ruth Schweiger', 'Georg Schaefer', 'Susann Schweiger', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Rainer Schneider']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Metformin anti-tumor effect via disruption of the MID1 translational regulator complex and AR downregulation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Reciprocal feedback inhibition of the androgen receptor and PI3K as a novel therapy for castrate-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer.', 'Positive epigenetic regulation loop between AR and NSUN2 promotes prostate cancer progression.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Exosomes derived from myeloid-derived suppressor cells facilitate castration-resistant prostate cancer progression via S100A9/circMID1/miR-506-3p/MID1.', 'TRIM18 is a critical regulator of viral myocarditis and organ inflammation.', 'Mid1 is associated with androgen-dependent axonal vulnerability of motor neurons in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.', 'Metformin and Cancer Hallmarks: Molecular Mechanisms in Thyroid, Prostate and Head and Neck Cancer Models.']"""

Methods and materials:   CT-based postimplant plan simulations for 40 patients were evaluated using dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters and sector analysis. Simulations in water (to evaluate ISA alone) and tissue assigned from contours or CT data, with and without calcifications, were compared.  Results:   For patients without calcifications, mean combined ISA and tissue effect reduced prostate D90 by 4.2 Gy (2.9%), prostate V100 by 0.5 cm(3) (1.4%), urethra D10 by 8.6 Gy (3.5%), rectal [Formula: see text] by 11.6 Gy (10.5%), and the 100% isodose volume by 4.7 cm(3). Larger differences were observed comparing planned dose to postimplant, mean prostate D90 reduced from 185 to 149.8 Gy (-19%). For patients with calcifications, larger tissue effects were observed, prostate D90 reduced by up to 7.4%. Sector analysis showed dose reductions were larger in anterior and base sectors of the prostate. For patients without calcifications, contour- and CT-based tissue model results agreed within <0.5% for all DVH parameters, with up to 4% difference for patients with calcifications.  Conclusions:   Advanced brachytherapy dose calculation methods that take account of ISA and tissue effects show that clinical (125)I implant dose is different from TG-43U1 (AAPM Task Group No. 43 Report-Update 1) calculations, reducing DVH parameter values particularly for patients with calcifications.

Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines containing the Epstein-Barr virus have been shown to form tumors in nude mice while clonal derivatives of such cell lines in which the viral genome has been lost do not (JID 177: 1194-1201, 1998; JV 72: 9150-9156, 1998; JV 68: 6069-6073, 1994). The re-introduction of EBV into these EBV negative BLs reconstitutes the tumor phenotype. Thus, EBV-induced cellular genes play critical role in EBV-related tumors.  Methods and results:   In an attempt to identify cellular genes regulated by EBV that may contribute to its tumorigenic properties, we have enforced genome loss in the Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) line, MutuI, by introducing a dominant negative form of the episomal replication factor, EBNA1 and carried out gene array analysis. One of the genes identified by this analysis is PLAC1, a gene originally identified as being expressed exclusively in placental tissue. Real time RT-PCR analysis verified higher expression in EBV positive vs. EBV negative Mutu clones. Analysis of a panel of RNAs from 20 normal tissues demonstrated the highest level of expression in placenta but significant expression was also observed in testis and brain cerebellum. PLAC1 expression was also observed in non-BL tumor cell lines derived from breast, ovary, and prostate. Lastly, expression of PLAC1 was found to be higher in some primary breast tumors compared to normal adjacent tissues.

Results:   There were no significant differences in age or body mass index between the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients. Prostate-specific antigen levels, Gleason sum and clinical stage of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients were significantly higher than those of the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy patients. Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients suffered significantly less bleeding (P < 0.05). The overall frequency of positive surgical margins was 30.6% (n = 167; 225 sites) in the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group and 27.5% (n = 42; 58 sites) in the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy group. In the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group, positive surgical margins were detected in the apex (52.0%), anterior (5.3%), posterior (5.3%) and lateral regions (22.7%) of the prostate, as well as in the bladder neck (14.7%). In the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients, they were observed in the apex, anterior, posterior, and lateral regions of the prostate in 43.0%, 6.9%, 25.9% and 15.5% of patients, respectively, as well as in the bladder neck in 8.6% of patients.  Conclusions:   Positive surgical margin distributions after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy are significantly different. The only disadvantage of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is the lack of tactile feedback. Thus, the robotic surgeon needs to take this into account to minimize the risk of positive surgical margins.""","""['Keiichi Tozawa', 'Takahiro Yasui', 'Yukihiro Umemoto', 'Kentaro Mizuno', 'Atsushi Okada', 'Noriyasu Kawai', 'Satoru Takahashi', 'Kenjiro Kohri']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['A comparison of the incidence and location of positive surgical margins in robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', 'Robot-assisted or pure laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: what is the optimal procedure for the surgical margins?

Participants provided demographic information and responded to a 5-item questionnaire regarding their opinions on screening before and after reading opposing position statements.  Results:   The overall response rate was 48%. After excluding incomplete questionnaires, 54 surveys were available for analysis. Patients were predominantly white, middle-aged and older, college-educated men with middle-to-upper-middle-class incomes who were seen at urology clinics. Patients rated their ""pre"" level of understanding of screening recommendations as good or very good (52%), okay (30%), and poor (19%). After reading the information sheets, good or very good understanding of screening recommendations improved (65%; P = .05), and agreement with the importance of screening remained high (80%). However, nearly 20% of patients expressed a more neutral or less favorable attitude toward the risk-benefit ratio of screening (P = .09). Agreement that men should undergo screening, that screening helps detect cancer, and that screening saves lives remained high, regardless of the exposure.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study using patients enrolled in our institutional PCa registry from 1991 to 2008 to assess the association of prostate volume and clinically insignificant PCa in men undergoing multiple prostate biopsies. Patients were stratified by prostate volume into 2 cohorts (<50 cm(3) or ≥50 cm(3)). Additionally, patients were stratified by prostate biopsy on which PCa was identified (1 biopsy or ≥3 biopsies).  Results:   Within the subgroup of patients with prostate volume ≥50 cm(3) requiring ≥3 biopsies before cancer diagnosis, 72.6% (45/62) had pathologic Gleason scores ≤6 and 81.6% (49/60) had an estimated tumor volume of ≤10% at the time of radical prostatectomy. This was significantly different from patients with prostate volume <50 cm(3) diagnosed on their first biopsy, in which only 48.5% (656/1349) were found to have Gleason scores ≤6 and 54.2% (705/1300) had estimated tumor volume ≤10% (P <.01). There was no significant difference in the rate of Gleason score upgrading at time of prostatectomy between any of the subgroups.  Conclusion:   PCas detected in men with prostatic enlargement requiring multiple biopsies are more likely to be low-grade, low-volume tumors at final pathology than men without prostate enlargement.

Accurate risk stratification models are needed to better predict risk for bone metastasis and death among patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This study evaluates whether alkaline phosphatase (AP) kinetics predicts bone metastasis and death in patients with CRPC.  Methods and materials:   A retrospective cohort study of 9,547 patients who underwent treatment for prostate cancer was conducted using the Center for Prostate Disease Research Multi-center National Database. From the entire cohort, 347 were found to have CRPC and, of those, 165 had 2 or more AP measurements during follow-up. To determine the AP velocity (APV), the slope of the linear regression line of all AP values was plotted over time. Rapid APV was defined as the uppermost quartile of APV values, which was found to be ≥6.3 IU/l/y. CRPC was defined as 2 consecutive rising PSA values after achieving a PSA nadir<4 ng/ml and documented testosterone values less than 50 ng/dl. The primary study outcomes included bone metastasis-free survival (BMFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Rapid APV and PSA doubling time (PSADT) less than 10 months were strong predictors of both BMFS and OS in a multivariable analysis. Faster PSADT was a stronger predictor for BMFS (odds ratio [OR] = 12.1, P<0.0001 vs. OR = 2.7, P = 0.011), whereas rapid APV was a stronger predictor of poorer OS (OR = 5.11, P = 0.0001 vs. OR = 3.98, P = 0.0034). In those with both a rapid APV and a faster PSADT, the odds of developing bone metastasis and death exceeded 50%.  Conclusion:   APV is an independent predictor of OS and BMFS in patients with CRPC. APV, in conjunction with PSA-based clinical parameters, may be used to better identify patients with CRPC who are at the highest risk of metastasis and death.

Costs were estimated from the perspective of the Australian health care system.  Results:   IMRT was both more effective and less costly than 3DCRT over 20 years, with an additional 20 QALYs gained and over $1.1 million saved per 1000 patients treated.

In many brachytherapy clinics, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging is used to identify the catheters. However, manual catheter identification on TRUS images can be time consuming, subjective, and operator dependent because of calcifications and distal shadowing artifacts. We report the use of electromagnetic (EM) tracking technology to map the position and shape of catheters inserted in a tissue-mimicking phantom.  Methods and materials:   The accuracy of the EM system was comprehensively quantified using a three-axis robotic system. In addition, EM tracks acquired from catheters in a phantom were compared with catheter positions determined from TRUS and CT images to compare EM system performance to standard clinical imaging modalities. The tracking experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory environment and also in a typical brachytherapy operating room to test for potential EM distortions.  Results:   The robotic validation of the EM system yielded a mean accuracy of <0.5 mm for a clinically acceptable field of view in a nondistorting environment. The EM-tracked catheter representations were found to have an accuracy of <1 mm when compared with TRUS- and CT-identified positions, both in the laboratory environment and in the brachytherapy operating room. The achievable accuracy depends to a large extent on the calibration of the TRUS probe, geometry of the tracked devices relative to the EM field generator, and locations of surrounding clinical equipment. To address the issue of variable accuracy, a robust calibration algorithm has been developed and integrated into the workflow. The proposed mapping technique was also found to improve the workflow efficiency of catheter identification.  Conclusions:   The high baseline accuracy of the EM system, the consistent agreement between EM-tracked, TRUS- and CT-identified catheters, and the improved workflow efficiency illustrate the potential value of using EM tracking for catheter mapping in high-dose-rate brachytherapy.""","""['Shyam Bharat', 'Cynthia Kung', 'Ehsan Dehghan', 'Ananth Ravi', 'Niranjan Venugopal', 'Antonio Bonillas', 'Doug Stanton', 'Jochen Kruecker']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['EM-enhanced US-based seed detection for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Real-time electromagnetic tracking-based treatment platform for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy: Clinical workflows and end-to-end validation.', 'Real-time catheter tracking for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy using an electromagnetic 3D-guidance device: a preliminary performance study.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy: report of Task Group 192.', 'Recent Advances in Tracking Devices for Biomedical Ultrasound Imaging Applications.', 'Image-guided Raman spectroscopy navigation system to improve transperineal prostate cancer detection.

The impact of clinicopathological variables on disease related outcomes have mainly been reported from a few large US series, most of them not reporting on perineural infiltration. We therefore wanted to investigate relevant cancer outcomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy in two Norwegian health regions with an emphasis on the impact of perineural infiltration (PNI) and prostate specific antigen- doubling time (PSA-DT).  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 535 prostatectomy patients at three hospitals between 1995 and 2005 estimating biochemical failure- (BFFS), clinical failure- (CFFS) and prostate cancer death-free survival (PCDFS) with the Kaplan-Meier method. We investigated clinicopathological factors influencing risk of events using cox proportional hazard regression.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 89 months, 170 patients (32%) experienced biochemical failure (BF), 36 (7%) experienced clinical failure and 15 (3%) had died of prostate cancer. pT-Stage (p = 0.001), preoperative PSA (p = 0.047), Gleason Score (p = 0.032), non-apical positive surgical margins (PSM) (p = 0.003) and apical PSM (p = 0.031) were all independently associated to BFFS. Gleason score (p = 0.019), PNI (p = 0.012) and non-apical PSM (p = 0.002) were all independently associated to CFFS while only PNI (P = 0.047) and subgroups of Gleason score were independently associated to PCDFS. After BF, patients with a shorter PSA-DT had independent and significant worse event-free survivals than patients with PSA-DT > 15 months (PSA-DT = 3-9 months, CFFS HR = 6.44, p < 0.001, PCDFS HR = 13.7, p = 0.020; PSA-DT < 3 months, CFFS HR = 11.2, p < 0.001, PCDFS HR = 27.5, p = 0.006).  Conclusions:   After prostatectomy, CFFS and PCDFS are variable, but both are strongly associated to Gleason score and PNI. In patients with BF, PSA-DT was most strongly associated to CF and PCD.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the detailed functions of TESTIN in the highly sexual hormone (estrogen)-dependent malignancy, endometrial carcinoma.  Material and methods:   TESTIN mRNA and protein expression were measured by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Upregulation of TESTIN was achieved by transfecting the pcDNA3.1-TESTIN plasmids into AN3CA cells. Knockdown of TESTIN was achieved by transfecting the shRNA-TESTIN into Ishikawa cells. MTT assay, colony formation assay, and Transwell assay were used to investigate the effects of TESTIN on cellular proliferation and invasion. The apoptotic status and cell cycle were analyzed using flow cytometry. MMP2 secretion was determined by ELISA assay. The xenograft assay was used to investigate the functions of TESTIN in nude mice.  Results:   Compared to the non-malignant adjacent endometrium, 54% of tumor samples presented downregulation of TESTIN (P<0.001). Loss of TESTIN protein was correlated with advanced tumor stage (P=0.047), high grade (P=0.034), and lymphatic vascular space invasion (P=0.036). In vitro, overexpression of TESTIN suppressed cell proliferation, induced dramatic G1 arrest, and inhibited tumor invasion through blocking the secretion of MMP2. Loss of TESTIN accelerated cellular proliferation, promoted cell cycle progression, and enhanced tumor invasion by increasing the secretion of MMP2. Consistently, TESTIN could significantly delay the growth of xenografts in nude mice.  Conclusions:   TESTIN was commonly downregulated in human endometrial carcinoma and was associated with poor prognostic markers. Moreover, TESTIN signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth and invasion via arresting cell cycle in in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Fast progress in sequencing technology has afforded us with landmark genetic alterations, which had immediate impact on clinical science and practice by pointing to new kinase targets, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the EGF receptor, or BRAF. The PI3K pathway for growth control has emerged as a prime example for both oncogene activation and tumor suppressor loss in cancer. Here, we discuss how therapy using PI3K pathway inhibitors could benefit from information on specific phosphatases, which naturally antagonize the kinase targets. This PI3K pathway is found mutated in most cancer types, including prostate, breast, colon, and brain tumors. The tumor-suppressing phosphatases operate at two levels. Lipid-level phosphatases, such as PTEN and INPP4B, revert PI3K activity to keep the lipid second messengers inactive. At the protein level, PHLPP1/2 protein phosphatases inactivate AKT kinase, thus antagonizing mTOR complex 2 activity. However, in contrast with their kinase counterparts the phosphatases are unlikely drug targets. They would need to be stimulated by therapy and are commonly deleted and mutated in cancer. Yet, because they occupy critical nodes in preventing cancer initiation and progression, the information on their status has tremendous potential in outcome prediction, and in matching the available kinase inhibitor repertoire with the right patients.

Methods:   In this retrospective analysis, 4,028 consecutive patients underwent open radical retropubic (RRP) or robot-assisted transperitoneal prostatectomy (RARP) at a single academic institution (07/2003-07/2013). After discharge, patients were offered 3-week treatment in a rehabilitation facility. Patients who opted for rehabilitation (n = 2,998, 74.4%) represent our study cohort. Exclusion criteria were acute urinary retention after catheter removal (n = 55, 1.4%), incomplete datasets (n = 50, 1.2%) or refusal of rehabilitation (n = 925, 23.0%). Results of urinary continence were evaluated from final rehabilitation reports. Twenty-two clinical and oncological variables were statistically analysed in uni- and multivariable analyses to determine whether they were associated with early urinary continence status six weeks after radical prostatectomy. Odds ratios and 95% CI as well as p values were calculated. A p level of 0.05 was considered as significant.  Results:   Six weeks after surgery, 1,962 (65.4%) patients were continent (≤1 pad/day) and 1,036 (34.6%) patients were considered incontinent. Age, clinical stage, PSA, ASA score, prior TURP, seminal vesicle invasion, Gleason score, nerve-sparing status, intraoperative blood loss, catheterisation time, OR time, surgical caseload >1,000 and the surgeon were associated with continence status on univariable analysis (p < 0.05). On multivariable analysis, nerve-sparing procedure (NS), clinical stage, individual surgeon, patient age, surgical procedure (RARP vs. RRP) and duration of catheterisation were independent predictors (p < 0.05) of incontinence status.

We previously demonstrated that the OPNc splice variant activates several aspects of the progression of ovarian and prostate cancers. The goal of the present study was to develop cell line models to determine the impact of OPNc overexpression on main cancer signaling pathways and thus obtain insights into the mechanisms of OPNc pro-tumorigenic roles.  Methods:   Human ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines, OvCar-3 and PC-3 cells, respectively, were stably transfected to overexpress OPNc. Transcriptomic profiling was performed on these cells and compared to controls, to identify OPNc overexpression-dependent changes in gene expression levels and pathways by qRT-PCR analyses.  Results:   Among 84 genes tested by using a multiplex real-time PCR Cancer Pathway Array approach, 34 and 16, respectively, were differentially expressed between OvCar-3 and PC-3 OPNc-overexpressing cells in relation to control clones. Differentially expressed genes are included in all main hallmarks of cancer, and several interacting proteins have been identified using an interactome network analysis. Based on marked up-regulation of Vegfa transcript in response to OPNc overexpression, we partially validated the array data by demonstrating that conditioned medium (CM) secreted from OvCar-3 and PC-3 OPNc-overexpressing cells significantly induced endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation and migration, compared to CM secreted from control cells.

An international survey collected expertise on the definition of DLT, as part of an initiative aimed at presenting new guidelines for phase 1 trials of targeted agents.  Methods:   A 15-question survey was sent to corresponding authors of phase 1 reports. Questions involved: duration of the DLT assessment period, incorporation of specific grade 1 (G1) or G2 toxicity and their minimum duration to qualify as DLT, exclusion of specific G3 and inclusion of dose modification/delay.  Results:   Among the 400 investigators contacted, 93 replied of whom 65 completed the questionnaires. A total of 87% opted for an extended DLT assessment period beyond cycle 1, with the proviso not to delay patient accrual. Reanalysis at the end of the study of all safety data was proposed in order to recommend the phase 2 dose. Most respondents (92%) suggested including dose modification in the definition of DLT when dose intensity was decreased to 70%. Whilst moderate toxicity was deemed relevant by 70%, the G1/2 toxicities selected to define DLT however varied.  Conclusion:   The majority of experts favoured a longer DLT assessment period as well as incorporation of specific G2 toxicities into the DLT definition.

In this regard, we examined the efficacy of combination treatment with the widely-used genotoxic drug doxorubicin and the mitochondriotoxic Hsp90 inhibitor gamitrinib to exploit disparate stress signaling pathways for cancer therapy.  Methods:   The cytotoxicity of the drugs as single agents or in combination against several cancer cell types was analyzed by MTT assay and the synergism of the drug combination was evaluated by calculating the combination index. To understand the molecular mechanism of the drug synergism, stress signaling pathways were analyzed after drug combination. Two xenograft models with breast and prostate cancer cells were used to evaluate anticancer activity of the drug combination in vivo. Cardiotoxicity was assessed by tissue histology and serum creatine phosphokinase concentration.  Results:   Gamitrinib sensitized various human cancer cells to doxorubicin treatment, and combination treatment with the two drugs synergistically increased apoptosis. The cytotoxicity of the drug combination involved activation and mitochondrial accumulation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim. Activation of Bim was associated with increased expression of the proapoptotic transcription factor C/EBP-homologous protein and enhanced activation of the stress kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Combined drug treatment with doxorubicin and gamitrinib dramatically reduced in vivo tumor growth in prostate and breast xenograft models without increasing cardiotoxicity.

However, the radiation dose perturbations due to catheter attenuation are not taken into account in treatment planning. The purpose of this work is to quantify the effects of catheter composition on dose distribution and study their impacts on the overall treatment with high-dose-rate (192)Ir sources.  Methods and materials:   Dose perturbations are first studied in a simplified case consisting of two parallel catheters. The catheter wall is either composed of stainless steel or polyoxymethylene. The attenuations are studied as the distance between the two catheters is varied from 5 to 30 mm. Dose perturbations resulting from irradiation are evaluated with a Monte Carlo GEANT4 dose calculation algorithm. The dose differences are further investigated with seven typical high-dose-rate prostate treatment plans involving 17 catheters.  Results:   The dose differences compared with water in the simplified case reach -4.3 ± 0.1% for stainless steel and 1.7 ± 0.5% for polyoxymethylene at 10 mm above the source when the catheters are separated by a distance of 5 mm. Dose perturbations are reduced in real treatment plans because of the contributions of the many dwell positions. Stainless steel and polyoxymethylene catheters induce on an average a dose difference of -1.3 ± 0.3% and 0.1 ± 0.2%, respectively in the target.

Methods:   Among the 11 million men aged 40 years and over covered by the general national health insurance scheme, those with newly managed PCa in 2009 were followed for two years based on data from the national health insurance information system (SNIIRAM). Patients were identified using hospitalisation diagnoses and specific refunds related to PCa and PCa treatments. Adverse effects of PCa treatments were identified by using hospital diagnoses, specific procedures and drug refunds.  Results:   The age-standardised two-year all-cause mortality rate among the 43,460 men included in the study was 8.4%, twice that of all men aged 40 years and over. Among the 36,734 two-year survivors, 38% had undergone prostatectomy, 36% had been treated by hormone therapy, 29% by radiotherapy, 3% by brachytherapy and 20% were not treated. The frequency of treatment-related adverse effects varied according to age and type of treatment. Among men between 50 and 69 years of age treated by prostatectomy alone, 61% were treated for erectile dysfunction and 24% were treated for urinary disorders. The frequency of treatment for these disorders decreased during the second year compared to the first year (erectile dysfunction: 41% vs 53%, urinary disorders: 9% vs 20%). The frequencies of these treatments among men treated by external beam radiotherapy alone were 7% and 14%, respectively. Among men between 50 and 69 years with treated PCa, 46% received treatments for erectile dysfunction and 22% for urinary disorders. For controls without PCa but treated surgically for benign prostatic hyperplasia, these frequencies were 1.5% and 6.0%, respectively.  Conclusions:   We report high survival rates two years after a diagnosis of PCa, but a high frequency of PCa treatment-related adverse effects. These frequencies remain underestimated, as they are based on treatments for erectile dysfunction and urinary disorders and do not reflect all functional outcomes. These results should help urologists and general practitioners to inform their patients about outcomes at the time of screening and diagnosis, and especially about potential treatment-related adverse effects.""","""['Philippe Tuppin', 'Solène Samson', 'Anne Fagot-Campagna', 'Bertrand Lukacs', 'François Alla;CNAMTS scientific board members;Fred Paccaud', 'Jean-Christophe Thalabard', 'Eric Vicaut', 'Michel Vidaud', 'Bertrand Millat']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Five-year outcomes after prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer: the prostate cancer outcomes study.', 'Survival and Complications Following Surgery and Radiation for Localized Prostate Cancer: An International Collaborative Review.', 'Impact on quality of life 3\u2009years after diagnosis of prostate cancer patients below 75 at diagnosis: an observational case-control study.', 'Criteria for indication and treatment modification in a cohort of patients with prostate cancer treated with hormone therapy.', 'Cancer care and public health policy evaluations in France: Usefulness of the national cancer cohort.', 'Patient survival and risk of death after prostate cancer treatment in the Brazilian Unified Health System.', 'Current challenges in providing bariatric surgery in France: A nationwide study.']"""

This is often done with simple methods that are not always reliable. More advanced methods work well but only for biomarkers with very simple distributions. In fact, biomarker distributions are often complex because of a natural heterogeneity in marker expression and other heterogeneities due to various disease stages, laboratory equipments, etc. Methods are required to estimate a biomarker optimal threshold in case of heterogeneity and complex distributions.  Methods:   A previously described Bayesian method developed for normally distributed biomarkers is applied to two flexible distributions; namely, a Student-t and a mixture of Dirichlet processes. Here, numerical studies assess the adequacy of the previous method with both distributions. Two applications are presented: the diagnosis of treatment failure after prostate cancer treated by ultrasound and the early diagnosis of cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract.  Results:   Bayesian inference provided reliable credible intervals in terms of bias and coverage probability.

Prostate cancer has a unique relationship with zinc(II) ions. However, the relationship was examined only in short-term zinc(II) treatments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to create zinc-resistant prostatic cell lines at various stages of the disease (22Rv1 and PC-3) and a normal prostate epithelium (PNT1A) using a long-term zinc exposure. Consequently, the expression profile of the following genes was analyzed: BAX, Bcl-2, Beclin-1, CFLAR, HIF1α, KRAS, mTOR, MT1A, MT2A, NF-κB1, p53, survivin, ZIP1, ZnT-1. The resistance was verified using the MTT test; on average a 1.35-fold lower zinc(II) toxicity (higher IC50) was determined in zinc(II)-resistant cells. The associated resistance to cisplatin was also determined; IC50 for cisplatin was 1.52-fold higher. With regard to the gene expression profiles, our results indicate that differential mechanisms participate in the short-term zinc toxicity regulation and long-term resistance; the short-term treatment was associated with MT2A (p < 0.001), ZnT-1 (p < 0.001), and MT1A (p < 0.03) and the long-term resistance was associated particularly with NF-κB1 (p < 0.001), CFLAR (p < 0.001), KRAS (p < 0.001), p53 (p < 0.002), survivin (p = 0.02), ZIP1 (p = 0.002), BAX (p = 0.005), and HIF1α (p = 0.05). Therefore, the KRAS-PI3K-NF-κB pathway is expected to play a crucial role in the regulation of zinc resistance.

CSCs isolated and proliferated for one passage were maintained as monolayers or spheroid-forming cells with serum included media for differentiation process. Differentiation of adhesion molecules and cellular ultrastructural properties were investigated and compared in both monolayer and spheroid cultures. CD133+/CD44+ cancer-initiating cells were isolated from DU-145 human prostate cancer cell line monolayer cultures and propagated as tumor spheroids and compared with the remaining heterogeneous cancer cell bulk population. Microarray-based gene expression analysis was applied to determine genes with differential expression and protein expression levels of candidates were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Electron microscopy showed detailed analysis of morphology. TGFβ1 was found to be significantly upregulated in monolayer CSCs. High expression levels of VCAN, COL7A1, ITGβ3, MMP16, RPL13A, COL4A2 and TIMP1 and low expression levels of THBS1, MMP1 and MMP14 were detected when CSCs were maintained as serum-grown prostate CSC spheroids. Immunohistochemistry supported increased immunoreactivity of TGFβ1 in monolayer cultures and VCAN in spheroids. CSCs were found to possess multipotential differentiation capabilities through upregulation and/or downregulation of their markers. TGFβ1 is a triggering molecule, it stimulates versican, Col7A1, ITGβ3 and, most importantly, the upregulation of versican was only detected in CSCs. Our data support a model where CSCs must be engaged by one or more signaling cascades to differentiate and initiate tumor formation. This mechanism occurs with intracellular and extracellular signals and it is possible that CSCc themselves may be a source for extracellular signaling.

This study focuses on the design and synthesis of second-generation PMHs with enhanced antitumor activities. A series of substituted benzaldehydes was selected based on earlier SAR studies and reacted with hydantoin to yield 11 new compounds . Compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative, antimigratory and anti-invasive properties in vitro against the human mammary and prostate cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and PC-3, respectively. A Western blot analysis of the most active analog showed its ability to suppress the expression of the total levels of c-Met and FAK, with subsequent reduction of their phosphorylated (activated) levels in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, also inhibited Brk, paxillin and Rac1 phosphorylation. was formulated using hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) to improve its solubility and was further evaluated in a nude mice xenograft model using MDA-MB-231/GFP cells.

However, the androgen-independency of the cancer in advanced stages has spurred researchers to look for new medical treatments. In previous reports, we developed the GnRH-II antagonist Trp-1 to inhibit proliferation and stimulate the autophagic death of various prostate cancer cells, including androgen-independent cells. We further screened many GnRH-II antagonists to identify molecules with higher efficiency. Here, we investigated the effect of SN09-2 on the growth of PC3 prostate cancer cells. SN09-2 reduced the growth of prostate cancer cells but had no effect on cells derived from other tissues. Compared with Trp-1, SN09-2 conspicuously inhibited prostate cancer cell growth, even at low concentrations. SN09-2-induced PC3 cell growth inhibition was associated with decreased membrane potential in mitochondria where the antagonist was accumulated, and increased mitochondrial and cytosolic reactive oxygen species. SN09-2 induced lactate dehydrogenase release into the media and annexin V-staining on the PC3 cell surface, suggesting that the antagonist stimulated prostate cancer cell death by activating apoptotic signaling pathways. Furthermore, cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol and caspase-3 activation occurred in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. SN09-2 also inhibited the growth of PC3 cells xenotransplanted into nude mice. These results demonstrate that SN09-2 directly induces mitochondrial dysfunction and the consequent ROS generation, leading to not only growth inhibition but also apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Sumi Park', 'Ji Man Han', 'Jun Cheon', 'Jong-Ik Hwang', 'Jae Young Seong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A gonadotropin-releasing hormone-II antagonist induces autophagy of prostate cancer cells.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone type II antagonist induces apoptosis in MCF-7 and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist Cetrorelix (SB-75) and bombesin antagonist RC-3940-II inhibit the growth of androgen-independent PC-3 prostate cancer in nude mice.', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Antagonists in Prostate Cancer.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone in apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.', 'Treatment of Breast Cancer With Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogs.', 'Apoptotic Effects of Drug Targeting Conjugates Containing Different GnRH Analogs on Colon Carcinoma Cells.', 'Expression and Role of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone 2 and Its Receptor in Mammals.']"""

The majority of human PCas express a transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2):erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) fusion gene, but most preclinical studies have been performed in PCa models lacking TMPRSS2:ETS in part due to the limited availability of model systems expressing endogenous TMPRSS2:ETS. The level of the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), is controlled in part by VDR-dependent induction of cytochrome P450, family 24, subfamily 1, polypeptide1 (CYP24A1), which metabolizes 1,25D to an inactive form. Because ETS factors can cooperate with VDR to induce rat CYP24A1, we tested whether TMPRSS2:ETS would cause aberrant induction of human CYP24A1 limiting the activity of VDR. In TMPRSS2:ETS positive VCaP cells, depletion of TMPRSS2:ETS substantially reduced 1,25D-mediated CYP24A1 induction. Artificial expression of the type VI+72 TMPRSS2:ETS isoform in LNCaP cells synergized with 1,25D to greatly increase CYP24A1 expression. Thus, one of the early effects of TMPRSS2:ETS in prostate cells is likely a reduction in intracellular 1,25D, which may lead to increased proliferation. Next, we tested the net effect of VDR action in TMPRSS2:ETS containing PCa tumors in vivo. Unlike previous animal studies performed on PCa tumors lacking TMPRSS2:ETS, EB1089 (seocalcitol) (a less calcemic analog of 1,25D) did not inhibit the growth of TMPRSS2:ETS containing VCaP tumors in vivo, suggesting that the presence of TMPRSS2:ETS may limit the growth inhibitory actions of VDR. Our findings suggest that patients with TMPRSS2:ETS negative tumors may be more responsive to VDR-mediated growth inhibition and that TMPRSS2:ETS status should be considered in future clinical trials.""","""['Jung-Sun Kim', 'Justin M Roberts', 'William E Bingman rd', 'Longjiang Shao', 'Jianghua Wang', 'Michael M Ittmann', 'Nancy L Weigel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Vitamin D receptor activation reduces VCaP xenograft tumor growth and counteracts ERG activity despite induction of TMPRSS2:ERG.', '1{alpha},25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits growth of VCaP prostate cancer cells despite inducing the growth-promoting TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of protein kinase CK2 reduces Cyp24a1 expression and enhances 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) antitumor activity in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Analysis of vitamin D metabolism gene expression in human bone: evidence for autocrine control of bone remodelling.', 'Immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D in various immune-related disorders: a comprehensive review.', 'Redox Potential of Antioxidants in Cancer Progression and Prevention.', 'Nitidine chloride inhibits the appearance of cancer stem-like properties and regulates potential the mitochondrial membrane alterations of colon cancer cells.', 'High levels of PIWI-interacting RNAs are present in the small RNA landscape of prostate epithelium from vitamin D clinical trial specimens.', 'Intratumoral Sterol-27-Hydroxylase (CYP27A1) Expression in Relation to Cholesterol Synthesis and Vitamin D Signaling and Its Association with Lethal Prostate Cancer.']"""

In various types of human cancer, including breast, lung and prostate cancer, Axl expression is increased and correlates with an advanced clinical stage. In this study, we examined whether apigenin has an effect on Axl expression, which in turn can affect cell proliferation. The treatment of the non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, A549 and H460, with apigenin decreased Axl mRNA and protein expression in a dose‑dependent manner. Axl promoter activity was also inhibited by apigenin, indicating that apigenin suppressed Axl expression at the transcriptional level. Upon treatment with apigenin, the viability of both the A549 and H460 cells was gradually decreased and the anti-proliferative effects were further confirmed by the dose‑dependent decrease in the clonogenic ability of the apigenin‑treated cells. Subsequently, we found that the viability and clonogenic ability of the cells treated with apigenin was less or more affected by transfection of the cells with a Axl-expressing plasmid or Axl targeting siRNA, compared to transfection with the empty vector or control siRNA, respectively. In addition, apigenin increased the expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, but reduced the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). These cell cycle arrest and pro-apoptotic effects of apigenin were also attenuated or augmented by the up- or downregulation of Axl expression, respectively, which suggests that Axl is a novel target of apigenin through which it exerts its inhibitory effects on cell proliferation.

Methods:   Prospectively maintained database on men with PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy was reviewed retrospectively. Demographic data and pathologic characteristics of patients who fulfilled the AS inclusion criteria under the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS), and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) guidelines were examined.  Results:   Of 930 patients, 231, 280, and 325 fulfilled the NCCN, PRIAS, and UCSF AS criteria, respectively. The frequencies of advanced disease on surgical pathology (upstaging and/or upgrading) were 31.6% (NCCN), 35.4% (PRIAS), and 34.2% (UCSF) of the study cohorts. PSAD was significantly higher in patients with advanced disease compared with that in patients with nonadvanced disease in all 3 AS schemas. Modifying the PRIAS and UCSF criteria using the NCCN's lower PSAD cutoff of 0.15 ng/mL(2) decreased the rates of the advanced disease significantly to 33.5% and 31.4%, respectively. Using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal PSAD cutoff level for the prediction of advanced disease was 0.085 ng/mL(2) (sensitivity/specificity of 76.7%/50.6% in NCCN and 75.6%/49.7% in PRIAS).  Conclusion:   Among patients with low-risk PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy, PSAD is a predictor of advanced disease at the time of surgery. Adopting a lower PSAD threshold of 0.085 ng/mL(2) decreased the risk of the advanced disease to 17.5%-21.7%. Therefore, PSAD should be part of all AS guidelines.""","""['Yun-Sok Ha', 'Jihyeong Yu', 'Amirali Hassanzadeh Salmasi', 'Neal Patel', 'Jaspreet Parihar', 'Eric A Singer', 'Jeong Hyun Kim', 'Tae Gyun Kwon', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Reply: To PMID 24925831.', 'Prostate cancer: optimizing active surveillance: patient and protocol.', 'Is prostate specific antigen (PSA) density necessary in selecting prostate cancer patients for active surveillance and what should be the cutoff in the Asian population?', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer in a Real-life Cohort: Comparing Outcomes for PRIAS-eligible and PRIAS-ineligible Patients.', 'Performance characteristics of prostate-specific antigen density and biopsy core details to predict oncological outcome in patients with intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Current status of active surveillance in prostate cancer.', 'Consensus statement with recommendations on active surveillance inclusion criteria and definition of progression in men with localized prostate cancer: the critical role of the pathologist.', 'Prognostic Value of the Intermediate-risk Feature in Men with Favorable Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Determination of Whether Apex or Non-Apex Prostate Cancer Is the Best Candidate for the Use of Prostate-Specific Antigen Density to Predict Pathological Grade Group Upgrading and Upstaging after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Combining prostate-specific antigen density with prostate imaging reporting and data system score version 2.1 to improve detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: A retrospective study.', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.', 'Intelligent early prostate cancer detection in 2021: more benefit than harm.']"""

Genetic variation in AR exists, including a polymorphic CAG repeat sequence that is inversely associated with transcriptional activity. Experimental data suggest that heightened AR activity facilitates formation of TMPRSS2:ERG, a gene fusion present in approximately 50% of tumors of patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We undertook a nested case-control study to investigate the hypothesis that shorter CAG repeat length would be associated with prostate cancer risk defined by TMPRSS2:ERG status. The study included 291 men with prostate cancer (147 ERG-positive) and 1,221 cancer-free controls. ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression.  Results:   Median CAG repeat length (interquartile range) among controls was 22 (20-24). Men with shorter CAG repeats had an increased risk of ERG-positive (OR, 1.07 per 1 repeat decrease; 95% CI, 1.00-1.14), but not ERG-negative prostate cancer (OR, 0.99 per 1 repeat decrease; 95% CI, 0.93-1.05).  Conclusions:   These data suggest that shorter CAG repeats are specifically associated with development of TMPRSS2:ERG-positive prostate cancer.  Impact:   Our results provide supportive evidence that androgen signaling underlies the development of prostate tumors that harbor TMPRSS2:ERG.

However, the expression and functions of SHARPIN in prostate cancer (PCa) have not yet been defined.  Methods:   The expression of SHARPIN in PCa cell lines and tissues was evaluated with western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. After SHARPIN was silenced in the PCa cell lines, western blots were used to confirm that SHARPIN physically associated with components of the NFκB pathway and the downstream targets (survivin and livin). The functions of SHARPIN in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro were measured with 5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4,5-dimenthylthiazoly)-3-(4-sulfophenyl)tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS), Transwell, and invasion assays, respectively. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate cell apoptosis. Furthermore, tumorigenesis in vivo was examined with tumorigenicity assays.  Results:   SHARPIN expression was upregulated in PCa cell lines and tissues. The knockdown of SHARPIN or incubation with Bay 11-7082 (an NFκB inhibitor) led to dramatically decreased levels of phosphorylated IκBα and phosphorylated p65 in comparison with the control group. Downregulation of survivin and livin due to SHARPIN inhibition was attributable to transcriptional repression (P < .05). Decreases in cell viability, migration, invasion, and survival with a higher sensitivity to docetaxel in vitro and with repressed tumorigenesis in vivo were observed upon SHARPIN silencing, and this was consistent with the results from inhibition of the NFκB pathway and its downstream targets.  Conclusion:   The current study demonstrates that overexpression of SHARPIN promotes activation of the NFκB pathway and downstream targets survivin and livin, which potentially contributes to PCa development.""","""['Yiming Zhang', 'Hai Huang', 'Huimin Zhou', 'Tao Du', 'Lexiang Zeng', 'Yi Cao', 'Jieqing Chen', 'Yiming Lai', 'Jin Li', 'Ganping Wang', 'Zhenghui Guo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Erratum: Activation of nuclear factor κB pathway and downstream targets survivin and livin by SHARPIN contributes to the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer.', ""SHARPIN: Role in Finding NEMO and in Amyloid-Beta Clearance and Degradation (ABCD) Pathway in Alzheimer's Disease?"", 'Livin regulates prostate cancer cell invasion by impacting the NF-κB signaling pathway and the expression of FN and CXCR4.', 'Elevation of SHARPIN Protein Levels in Prostate Adenocarcinomas Promotes Metastasis and Impairs Patient Survivals.', 'Livin mediates tumor cell invasion in the DU-145 cell line via NF-κB.', 'Endocrinotherapy resistance of prostate and breast cancer: Importance of the NF‑κB pathway (Review).', 'SHARPIN Enhances Ferroptosis in Synovial Sarcoma Cells via NF-κB- and PRMT5-Mediated PGC1α Reduction.', 'SIPL1, Regulated by MAZ, Promotes Tumor Progression and Predicts Poor Survival in Human Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'SHARPIN regulates the development of clear cell renal cell carcinoma by promoting von Hippel-Lindau protein ubiquitination and degradation.', 'Identification of Somatic Genetic Alterations Using Whole-Exome Sequencing of Uterine Leiomyosarcoma Tumors.', ""SHARPIN: Role in Finding NEMO and in Amyloid-Beta Clearance and Degradation (ABCD) Pathway in Alzheimer's Disease?""]"""

It has been shown that SHH pathway is involved in tumor angiogenesis and in regulation of metabolism of cancer stem cells. The increased activity of the SHH pathway is responsible for generation and maintenance of the multidrug resistance in cancer cells. A key role in the development of this insensitivity to cytotoxic drugs play ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.  Methods:   SHH encoding plasmid was stably transfected into PCa cell lines DU145 and LNCaP. The expression of SHH was silenced by shRNA and the level of SHH was tested by quantitative (q)PCR and western blot methods. The effect of SHH overexpression in cells after treatment with paclitaxel was measured by MTT assay, crystal violet assay and flow cytometry. The level of 44 ABC transporters was estimated by qPCR.  Results:   Expression of exogenous SHH protein in DU145 and LNCaP cell lines enhanced their resistance to paclitaxel along with increased expression of ABC transporters transcripts. Paclitaxel treatment further enhanced the expression of increased ABC transporters transcripts in cells overexpressing SHH.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main leukocytes of intratumoral infiltration, and increased TAMs correlates with poor prostate cancer prognosis. However, the mechanism of n-3 PUFAs on prostate cancer cell progression induced by TAMs is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of EPA and DHA on modulating of migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells induced by TAMs-like M2-type macrophages. PC-3 prostate cancer cells were pretreated with EPA, DHA, or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ antagonist, GW9662, before exposure to conditioned medium (CM). CM was derived from M2-polarized THP-1 macrophages. The migratory and invasive abilities of PC-3 cells were evaluated using a coculture system of M2-type macrophages and PC-3 cells. EPA/DHA administration decreased migration and invasion of PC-3 cells. The PPAR-γ DNA-binding activity and cytosolic inhibitory factor κBα (IκBα) protein expression increased while the nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 transcriptional activity and nuclear NF-κB p65 protein level decreased in PC-3 cells incubated with CM in the presence of EPA/DHA. Further, EPA/DHA downregulated mRNA expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-9, cyclooxygenase-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Pretreatment with GW9662 abolished the favorable effects of EPA/DHA on PC-3 cells. These results indicate that EPA/DHA administration reduced migration, invasion and macrophage chemotaxis of PC-3 cells induced by TAM-like M2-type macrophages, which may partly be explained by activation of PPAR-γ and decreased NF-κB p65 transcriptional activity.""","""['Cheng-Chung Li', 'Yu-Chen Hou', 'Chiu-Li Yeh', 'Sung-Ling Yeh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Retraction: Effects of Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Docosahexaenoic Acid on Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion Induced by Tumor-Associated Macrophages.', 'Docosahexaenoic acid induces an anti-inflammatory profile in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human THP-1 macrophages more effectively than eicosapentaenoic acid.', 'EPA and DHA reduce LPS-induced inflammation responses in HK-2 cells: evidence for a PPAR-gamma-dependent mechanism.', 'DHA- and EPA-Enriched Phosphatidylcholine Suppress Human Lung Carcinoma 95D Cells Metastasis via Activating the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ.', 'Docosahexaenoic acid attenuates LPS-stimulated inflammatory response by regulating the PPARγ/NF-κB pathways in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells.', 'Postprandial lipoproteins and the molecular regulation of vascular homeostasis.', 'PFOS Inhibited Normal Functional Development of Placenta Cells via PPARγ Signaling.', 'Targeting androgen receptor (AR) with antiandrogen Enzalutamide increases prostate cancer cell invasion yet decreases bladder cancer cell invasion via differentially altering the AR/circRNA-ARC1/miR-125b-2-3p or miR-4736/PPARγ/MMP-9 signals.', 'An Amplified Fatty Acid-Binding Protein Gene Cluster in Prostate Cancer: Emerging Roles in Lipid Metabolism and Metastasis.', 'The FABP12/PPARγ pathway promotes metastatic transformation by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and lipid-derived energy production in prostate cancer cells.', 'Distinct differences in serum eicosanoids in healthy, enteritis and colorectal cancer individuals.']"""

In order to allow specific treatment in the case of prostate cancer presenting as cancer of unknown primary origin, it is important to determine the tumor origin. Prostate-specific antigen is used as a diagnostic marker for prostate cancer but the expression declines with progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer. Aim of this study was to identify the most informative marker constellation, which is able to detect metastatic prostate cancer at high sensitivity. The widely used prostate cancer markers such as prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific acid phosphatase, androgen receptor, prostate-specific membrane antigen, prostein, and ETS-related gene were investigated for their sensitivity to detect prostatic origin of metastases. Expression of prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific acid phosphatase, androgen receptor, prostate-specific membrane antigen, prostein, and ETS-related gene was determined on archived tissue specimens consisting of benign prostatic tissue (n=9), primary prostate cancer (n=79), lymph node metastases (n=58), and distant metastases (n=39) using immunohistochemistry. The staining intensity was categorized as negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). All markers except ETS-related gene were able to detect at least 70% of lymph node metastases and distant metastases, with prostate-specific antigen, androgen receptor, and prostate-specific membrane antigen having the highest sensitivity (97%, 91%, and 94%, respectively). A further increase of the sensitivity up to 98% and 100% could be achieved by the combination of prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific membrane antigen, or androgen receptor for lymph node metastases and for distant metastases, respectively. The same sensitivity could be reached by combining prostate-specific membrane antigen and prostein.

However, the only other known report for EphA10 was its expression in the testis at the mRNA level. Therefore, the potency of EphA10 as a drug target against cancers other than the breast is not known. The expression of EphA10 in a wide variety of cancer cells was studied and the potential of EphA10 as a drug target was evaluated. Screening of EphA10 mRNA expression showed that EphA10 was overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines as well as in prostate and colon cancer cell lines. Thus, we focused on prostate cancers in which EphA10 expression was equivalent to that in breast cancers. As a result, EphA10 expression was clearly shown in clinical prostate tumor tissues as well as in cell lines at the mRNA and protein levels. In order to evaluate the potential of EphA10 as a drug target, we analyzed complement-dependent cytotoxicity effects of anti-EphA10 mAb and found that significant cytotoxicity was mediated by the expression of EphA10.

Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective cohort study of 1482 men with early-stage PCa diagnosed in 1998-2004 at two Southern California Veterans Affairs medical centers.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Subhazard ratios and cumulative incidence of other-cause mortality associated with weighted and unweighted Charlson scores, calculated by competing-risks regression accounting for cancer mortality, along with Harrell concordance index (C-index) values.  Results and limitations:   Weighted and unweighted Charlson scores were identical in 88.6% of subjects (1313 of 1482 men) across all scores and in 91.7% of subjects (1359 of 1482 men) across scores of 0, 1, 2, and ≥3. In competing-risks analysis, hazards of other-cause mortality were similar when comparing weighted and unweighted scores. Men with weighted scores of 1, 2, and ≥3 (vs. 0) had subhazard ratios of 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-3.2), 4.1 (95% CI, 2.9-5.8), and 8.3 (95% CI, 5.9-11.5), respectively. Men with unweighted scores of 1, 2, and ≥3 (vs. 0) had subhazard ratios of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8-3.5), 4.5 (95% CI, 3.2-6.3), and 10.3 (95% CI, 7.2-14.7), respectively. The C-indexes for prediction of other-cause mortality were nearly identical for weighted scores (0.759 [95% CI, 0.715-0.780]) and unweighted scores (0.756 [95% CI, 0.717-0.780]). The difference in C-index between the two methods was -0.003 (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.004).  Conclusions:   An unweighted Charlson score yields similar strength of association and variance in predicting long-term, other-cause mortality compared with a weighted Charlson score.

Features tested as inputs were: average signal, signal standard deviation, energy, contrast, correlation, homogeneity and entropy (all defined on T2WI); and average ADC.

Two men reported nonserious adverse events: one a vaso-vagal reaction when taking solifenacin with sildenafil, and the other was dehydration and dizziness after strenuous exercise. Additionally, four withdrew due to side effects. The efficacy outcomes show improved intermittency after prostatectomy, though unclear if due to the medication.

Participants were asked about their perceived cancer risk; how informed they felt about cancer tests; whether their healthcare provider addressed pros/cons of testing, presented the option of no testing, and elicited their input; whether they were tested; and their confidence in the screening decision. Data were analyzed in 2013-2014 with descriptive statistics and logistic regression.  Results:   Overall, 1,134 participants (477 men, 657 women) aged ≥50 years made cancer screening decisions, and 1,098 (354, BrCa; 598, CRC; 146, PCa) decisions were discussed with a healthcare provider. Most discussions (51%-67%) addressed pros of screening some or a lot, but few (7%-14%) similarly addressed cons. For all cancer screening decisions, providers usually (63%-71%) explained that testing was optional, but less often asked women (43%-57%) than men (70%-71%) whether they wanted testing. Only 27%-38% of participants reported SDM, 69%-93% underwent screening, and 55%-76% would definitely make the same decision again. Perceived high/average cancer risk and feeling highly informed were associated with confidence in the screening decision.  Conclusions:   Discussions often failed to provide balanced information and meet SDM criteria.

For the First Nations cohort, survival improved only for breast and prostate cancers; it either declined or remained unchanged for the other cancers. For cancers diagnosed in 1992 or later, all-cause and cause-specific survival was significantly poorer for First Nations people diagnosed with breast, prostate, cervical, colorectal (male and female) and male lung cancers as compared to their non-First Nations peers. For female lung cancer, First Nations women appeared to have poorer survival; however, the result was not statistically significant.

However, numerous recent studies have questioned this traditional belief. In our study, LNCaP and MDA PCa 2b PCa cells were treated with various levels of androgens for 10 or 20 days, and the cell growth was measured with crystal violet mitogenic assay. The results indicated that the effect of androgens on the proliferation of PCa cells occurs in a biphasic pattern, with the androgen levels promoting optimal cell growth at approximately 0.23 ng ml⁻¹ for LNCaP cells and between 1 and 2 ng ml⁻¹ for MDA PCa 2b cells. Both of the optimal androgen levels are within the adult men's physiological low range (<2.4 ng ml⁻¹). At lower concentrations than the optimal androgen level, increasing androgen concentration promoted the proliferation of PCa cells. However, at the higher concentrations, increasing androgen concentration resulted in a dose-dependent proliferative inhibition. We conclude that physiologically normal levels of androgen inhibit the proliferation of PCa cells in vitro.

Methods:   A population-based cohort (Swedish Family-Cancer Database) of 14,267 RCC patients diagnosed in 1990-2010 was followed for cancer incidence. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for subsequent cancers in RCC survivors and in RCC survivors with a family history of subsequent cancer. Familial risk of subsequent cancer was calculated for individuals with family history of specific cancer, compared to those without.  Results:   For subsequent hemangioblastoma (HB) in RCC survivors, drastically elevated risk was observed for the effect of family history of HB [SIR=777 (95% confidence interval (CI): 160-2270)] and of family history of RCC [378 (46-1367)]. Colorectal, lung, prostate and RCCs favoured additive interactions between risk of subsequent cancers in RCC survivors and familial risk, while endocrine glands, nervous system and urinary bladder cancers favoured multiplicative interactions.  Conclusions:   Risks of subsequent HB in RCC survivors were tremendously modified by family history of RCC or HB, which may resemble characteristics of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and show the power of present approach to detect heritable cancer clusters.

Here, we investigated the regulation of GCPII expression in astrocytes and examined whether GCPII is epigenetically regulated through histone modification. In this study, valproic acid (VPA), a drug used for bipolar disorder and epilepsy and a known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor was used. We found that acute exposure of VPA for 4-6h increased the GCPII protein level in human astrocyte U87MG cells but did not have a similar effect after 12-24h exposure. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that VPA did not affect the GCPII mRNA expression. In contrast, decrease in GCPII protein level by cycloheximide treatment was blocked by VPA, indicating that VPA increases GCPII protein stability. Treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, suggested that the VPA-induced increase of GCPII protein level is dependent on the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. In addition, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that VPA increased the acetylation of GCPII protein at the lysine residues and facilitated a decrease of the poly-ubiquitinated GCPII level. Similarly, M344, a specific HDAC 1/6 inhibitor, also increased the GCPII protein level. In contrast, treatment with C646, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor of p300/CBP, significantly reduced the level of GCPII protein. Taken together, this study demonstrated that the increase in GCPII induced by VPA is not due to the classical epigenetic mechanism, but via enhanced acetylation of lysine residues in GCPII.""","""['Ji-Young Choi', 'Jong-Ho Kim', 'Sangmee Ahn Jo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['HDAC1 regulates the stability of glutamate carboxypeptidase II protein by modulating acetylation status of lysine 479 residue.', 'Expression of glutamate carboxypeptidase II in human brain.', 'Valproic acid exposure decreases Cbp/p300 protein expression and histone acetyltransferase activity in P19 cells.', 'Epigenetic landscape of amphetamine and methamphetamine addiction in rodents.', 'Glutamate carboxypeptidase II in diagnosis and treatment of neurologic disorders and prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical and clinical progress for HDAC as a putative target for epigenetic remodeling and functionality of immune cells.', 'Profound changes in cerebrospinal fluid proteome and metabolic profile are associated with congenital hydrocephalus.', 'ACSA-2 and GLAST classify subpopulations of multipotent and glial-restricted cerebellar precursors.', 'Lysine acetylation of NKG2D ligand Rae-1 stabilizes the protein and sensitizes tumor cells to NKG2D immune surveillance.', 'A novel mechanism of ERK1/2 regulation in smooth muscle involving acetylation of the ERK1/2 scaffold IQGAP1.']"""

Proteomics-based analysis in this study revealed that SOD2, associated with downregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), was significantly up-regulated in docetaxel-resistant (PC3/Doc) cells if compared to sensitive cells, and the expression of redox-regulated genes such as IGF-1R, CXCR4, and BCL2 was increased as well. Forced expression of SOD2 in sensitive cells led to the increase of IGF-1R and association with drug resistance, whereas silencing of SOD2 resulted in the decrease of IGF-1R at the protein level in resistant cells. Further study revealed that SOD2 acted as a negative regulator of β-arrestin1 that is an important adaptor responsible for degradation of IGF-1R via the changes in ROS, as evidenced by observations that an antioxidant agent substantially attenuated β-arrestin1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we found that blocking of IL6 that was up-regulated in resistant cells resulted in attenuation of SOD2 and STAT3, and simultaneously in increased expression of β-arrestin1. The modulation consequently led to the decreased IGF-1R at both protein and transcription levels. Together, our data provide a novel explanation that high level of IL6 stimulated SOD2 expression that, at least partially, contributed to the low level of ROS that would likely result in a sustained increase in the expression of IGF-1R through abolishment of β-arrestin1 in docetaxel resistant cells.""","""['Denglu Zhang', 'Yazhou Cui', 'Leilei Niu', 'Xia Xu', 'Keli Tian', 'Charles Y F Young', 'Hongxiang Lou', 'Huiqing Yuan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Cell Biol""","""['Picropodophyllin induces downregulation of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor: potential mechanistic involvement of Mdm2 and beta-arrestin1.', 'Antitumor effects and molecular mechanisms of figitumumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to IGF-1 receptor, in esophageal carcinoma.', ""β-Arrestin-biased agonism as the central mechanism of action for insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor-targeting antibodies in Ewing's sarcoma."", 'Something old, something new and something borrowed: emerging paradigm of insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling regulation.', 'Plasma and tissue insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer and anti-IGF-IR agents as novel therapeutic strategy for refractory cases: a review.', 'Paracrine Signals in Calcified Conditioned Media Elicited Differential Responses in Primary Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells and in Adventitial Fibroblasts.', 'Targeting prooxidant MnSOD effect inhibits triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression and M2 macrophage functions under the oncogenic stress.', 'EPA is Cardioprotective in Male Rats Subjected to Sepsis, but ALA Is Not Beneficial.', 'Polyphyllin I induces cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells via the upregulation of IL6 and P21 expression.', 'Inactivation of TFEB and NF-κB by marchantin M alleviates the chemotherapy-driven pro-tumorigenic senescent secretion.']"""

Methods:   A multiplexed nested methylation-specific PCR was applied to quantify promoter methylation of the selected markers in five cell lines, 42 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 71 high-risk PCa tumor samples. Uni- and multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the importance of the methylation level in predicting BCR.  Results:   A PCa-specific methylation marker HAAO in combination with HOXD3 and a hypomethylation marker TDRD1 distinguished PCa samples (>90 % of tumor cells each) from BPH with a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.95. High methylation of PITX2, HOXD3 and RASSF1, as well as low methylation of TDRD1, appeared to be significantly associated with a higher risk for BCR (HR 3.96, 3.44, 2.80 and 2.85, correspondingly) after correcting for established risk factors. When DNA methylation was treated as a continuous variable, a two-gene model PITX2 × 0.020677 + HOXD3 × 0.0043132 proved to be the best predictor of BCR (HR 4.85) compared with the individual markers. This finding was confirmed in an independent set of 52 high-risk PCa tumor samples (HR 11.89).  Conclusions:   Differential promoter methylation of HOXD3, PITX2, RASSF1 and TDRD1 emerges as an independent predictor of BCR in high-risk PCa patients.

The present study identified SPARC genes from 14 vertebrate genomes and revealed that SPARC existed in all types of vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. In total, 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) causing missense mutations were identified, which may affect the formation of the truncated form of the SPARC protein. The human SPARC gene was found to be expressed in numerous tissues or organs, including in the bone marrow, whole blood, lymph node, thymus, brain, cerebellum, retina, heart, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, spinal cord, intestine, colon, adipocyte, kidney, liver, pancreas, thyroid, salivary gland, skin, ovary, uterus, placenta, cervix and prostate. When searched in the PrognoScan database, the human SPARC gene was also found to be expressed in bladder, blood, breast, glioma, esophagus, colorectal, head and neck, ovarian, lung and skin cancer tissues.

Hyperplasia and decreased differentiation of epithelial cells in the prostate have been reported in ERβ knockout (BERKO) mice. Herein, we studied the effect of ERβ deficiency on prostate tumorigenesis by crossing BERKOFVB mice with prostate-targeted human fibroblast growth factor 8b transgenic (FGF8b-Tg) mice. Consistent with results described in our previous report, the prostates of 1-year-old FGF8b-Tg mice displayed stromal aberrations, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) lesions, inflammation, and occasionally cancer. The prostates of BERKOFVB mice exhibited mild epithelial hypercellularity and inflammation. The prostate phenotypes of FGF8b-Tg-BERKOFVB mice closely resembled those of FGF8b-Tg mice. However, mucinous metaplasia, indicated by Goblet-like cells in the epithelium, was significantly more frequent in the prostates of FGF8b-Tg-BERKOFVB mice when compared with FGF8b-Tg mice. Furthermore, compared with FGF8b-Tg mice, there was a tendency for increased frequency of inflammation but milder hyperplasias in the prostate stroma of FGF8b-Tg-BERKOFVB mice. The expression levels of mRNAs for FGF8b-regulated genes including osteopontin (Spp1), connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf), fibroblast growth factor receptors (Fgfrs), and steroid hormone receptors and cytokines were similar in the prostates of FGF8b-Tg and FGF8b-Tg-BERKOFVB mice.

MED12, encoding a subunit of the Mediator complex, is a transducer of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, linked to modulation of hedgehog signaling and to the regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-receptor signaling. Therefore, these studies prompted us to investigate the relevance of MED12 in PCa. Expression of MED12, SMAD3 phosphorylation, and proliferation markers was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays from 633 patients. siRNA-mediated knockdown of MED12 was carried out on PCa cell lines followed by cellular proliferation assays, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assays, and treatments with recombinant TGFβ3. We found nuclear overexpression of MED12 in 40% (28/70) of distant metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC(MET)) and 21% (19/90) of local-recurrent CRPC (CRPC(LOC)) in comparison with frequencies of less than 11% in androgen-sensitive PCa, and no overexpression in benign prostatic tissues. MED12 expression was significantly correlated with high proliferative activity in PCa tissues, whereas knockdown of MED12 decreased proliferation, reduced G1- to S-phase transition, and increased the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27. TGFβ signaling activation associates with MED12 nuclear overexpression in tissues and results in a strong increase in MED12 nuclear expression in cell lines. Furthermore, MED12 knockdown reduced the expression of the TGFβ target gene vimentin.

Methods:   The Patient Navigation Research Program compared patient navigation with usual care on time to diagnosis or treatment for participants with breast, cervical, colorectal, or prostate screening abnormalities and/or cancers between 2007 and 2010. Patient navigators developed individualized strategies to address barriers to care, with the focus on preventing delays in care. To assess timeliness of diagnostic resolution, we conducted a meta-analysis of center- and cancer-specific adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing patient navigation vs usual care. To assess initiation of cancer therapy, we calculated a single aHR, pooling data across all centers and cancer types. We conducted a metaregression to evaluate variability across centers. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   The 10521 participants with abnormal screening tests and 2105 with a cancer or precancer diagnosis were predominantly from racial/ethnic minority groups (73%) and publically insured (40%) or uninsured (31%). There was no benefit during the first 90 days of care, but a benefit of navigation was seen from 91 to 365 days for both diagnostic resolution (aHR = 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23 to 1.84; P < .001)) and treatment initiation (aHR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.86; P < .007). Metaregression revealed that navigation had its greatest benefits within centers with the greatest delays in follow-up under usual care.

The objective of this study was to investigate associations between PSA testing and the psychological and physical health, and healthcare utilisation of men in a population where PSA testing is widespread.  Methods:   A cross-sectional study was carried out in a population-representative sample of men ≥ 50 years enrolled in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). TILDA participants underwent structured interviews, health assessments and completed standardised questionnaires. Men were classified as ever/never having received a PSA test. Multivariate logistic regression (Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) was used to determine associations between PSA testing, and men's psychological and physical health and healthcare utilisation.  Results:   This analysis included 3,628 men, 68.2% of whom ever had a PSA test. In adjusted analysis, men with sub-threshold depression were significantly less likely to have had a PSA test, (OR=0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.97). Likelihood of having a PSA test was inversely associated with anxiety, but this was not significant (OR=0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.09). Frailty (OR=0.61, 95% CI 0.31-1.05) and eligibility for free primary care (OR=0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.77) were also inversely associated with PSA testing. Positive associations were observed between PSA testing and more chronic illnesses (OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.19), more primary care visits (OR=1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05) and preventative health practices, including cholesterol testing and influenza vaccination (OR=1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.60).  Conclusions:   Men's psychological and physical health and their healthcare utilisation are associated with PSA testing in primary care. The association between poorer psychological health, in particular sub-threshold depression, and reduced likelihood of PSA testing in primary care requires further investigation.

Methods:   Microarray profiling of gene expression and DNA methylation was performed on 16 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 32 cancerous and non-cancerous prostate samples extracted by radical prostatectomy. The predictive value of the selected biomarkers was validated by qPCR-based methods using tissue samples extracted from the 58 prostates and, separately, using 227 prostate core biopsies.  Results:   HOXC6, AMACR and PCA3 expression showed the best discrimination between PCa and BPH. All three genes were previously reported as the most promising mRNA-based markers for distinguishing cancerous lesions from benign prostate lesions; however, none were sufficiently sensitive and specific to meet the criteria for a PCa diagnostic biomarker. By contrast, DNA methylation levels of the APC, TACC2, RARB, DGKZ and HES5 promoter regions achieved high discriminating sensitivity and specificity, with area under the curve (AUCs) reaching 0.95-1.0. Only a small overlap was detected between the DNA methylation levels of PCa-positive and PCa-negative needle biopsies, with AUCs ranging between 0.854 and 0.899.

To facilitate the clinical implementation of FFF, we attempted to elucidate the difference in plan quality and treatment delivery time compared to flattening filter beams (i.e. standard, STD) for several patient groups. We hypothesize that the treatment plan quality is comparable while the treatment delivery time of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is considerably shorter using FFF beams, especially for stereotactic treatments.  Methods:   A total of 120 patients treated for head and neck (H&N) tumors, high-grade glioma, prostate cancer, early stage lung cancer and intra-cranial metastatic disease (both single and multiple metastases) were included in the study. For each cohort, 20 consecutive patients were selected. The plans were generated using STD- and FFF-VMAT for both 6 MV and 10 MV, and were compared with respect to plan quality, monitor units and delivery time using Wilcoxon signed rank tests.  Results:   For H&N and high-grade gliomas, there was a significant difference in homogeneity index in favor for STD-VMAT (p < 0.001). For the stereotactic sites there were no differences in plan conformity. Stereotactic FFF-VMAT plans required significantly shorter delivery time compared to STD-VMAT plans (p < 0.001) for higher dose per fraction, on average 54.5% for 6 MV and 71.4% for 10 MV. FFF-VMAT generally required a higher number of MU/Gy (p < 0.001), on average 7.0% for 6 MV and 8.4% for 10 MV.

Thus, it is interesting to consider the case of cancer progression where de-regulation of the Eph/ephrin signaling system results in invasion and metastasis. Here, we present evidence that Pick1, one of the essential components of the adherens junction, recovers ephrinB1-induced cell-cell de-adhesion. Loss of Pick1 leads to dissociation of epithelial cells via disruption of the adherens junction, a phenotype similar to ephrinB1 overexpression. In addition, overexpressed ephrinB1-induced disruption of the adherens junction is rescued via binding to Pick1.

Purpose:   The aim of this study was to examine the individual risk factors associated with the development of subsequent cancers after non melanoma skin cancer.  Methods:   Participants in the population-based New Hampshire Skin Cancer Study provided detailed risk factor data, and subsequent cancers were identified via linkage with the state cancer registry. Deaths were identified via state and national death records. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate risk of subsequent malignancies in NMSC patients versus controls and to assess the potential confounding effects of multiple risk factors on this risk.  Results:   Among 3584 participants, risk of a subsequent cancer (other than NMSC) was higher after basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (adjusted HR 1.40 [95% CI 1.15, 1.71]) than squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (adjusted HR 1.18 [95% CI 0.95, 1.46]) compared to controls (adjusted for age, sex and current cigarette smoking). After SCC, risk was higher among those diagnosed before age 60 (HR 1.96 [95% CI 1.24, 3.12]). An over 3-fold risk of melanoma after SCC (HR 3.62; 95% CI 1.85, 7.11) and BCC (HR 3.28; 95% CI 1.66, 6.51) was observed, even after further adjustment for sun exposure-related factors and family history of skin cancer. In men, prostate cancer incidence was higher after BCC compared to controls (HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.10, 2.46).

This is largely due to a lack of understanding of the molecular pathways that are responsible for the aggressive forms of prostate cancers, the castrate-resistant prostate cancer and the metastatic prostate cancer. Cell signaling pathways activated by the ERBB2 oncogene or the RAS oncogene are frequently found to be altered in metastatic prostate cancers. To evaluate and define the role of the ERBB2/RAS pathway in prostate cancer metastasis, we have evaluated the impact of ERBB2- or RAS-overexpression on the metastatic potentials for four prostate cancer cell lines derived from tumors with different androgen sensitivities. To do so, we transfected the human DU145, LnCaP, and PC3 prostate cancer cells and the murine Myc-CaP prostate cancer cells with the activated form of ERBB2 or H-RAS and assessed their metastatic potentials by three complementary assays, a wound healing assay, a transwell motility assay, and a transwell invasion assay. We showed that while overexpression of ERBB2 increased the metastatic potential of the androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells (i.e. PC3 and DU145), it did not affect metastatic potentials of the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells (i.e. LnCaP and Myc-CaP). In contrast, overexpression of H-RAS only increased the cell motility of Myc-CaP cells, which overexpress the human c-MYC oncogene. Our data suggest that ERBB2 collaborates with androgen signaling to promote prostate cancer metastasis, and that although RAS is one of the critical downstream effectors of ERBB2, it does not phenocopy ERBB2 for its impact on the metastatic potentials of prostate cancer cell lines.""","""['Jessica Tome-Garcia', 'Dan Li', 'Seda Ghazaryan', 'Limin Shu', 'Lizhao Wu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Functional analysis implicating the SNP rs61552325 in ERBB2 as an effector for androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Activation of Notch1 synergizes with multiple pathways in promoting castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Friend or Foe: Regulation, Downstream Effectors of RRAD in Cancer.', 'Her2 Expression in Circulating Tumor Cells Is Associated with Poor Outcomes in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The influence of testosterone suppression on HER2 immunoexpression in prostatic neoplastic tissue.', 'Expression of ERBB Family Members as Predictive Markers of Prostate Cancer Progression and Mortality.', 'ErbB-2 signaling in advanced prostate cancer progression and potential therapy.', 'Dacomitinib, but not lapatinib, suppressed progression in castration-resistant prostate cancer models by preventing HER2 increase.']"""

It is, however, not known if varying slice thickness influences derived dose-response relationships. We investigated this for rectal bleeding using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the rectum and rectal wall for dose distributions superimposed on images with varying CT slice thicknesses. We used dose and endpoint data from two prostate cancer cohorts treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy to either 74 Gy (N = 159) or 78 Gy (N = 159) at 2 Gy per fraction. The rectum was defined as the whole organ with content, and the morbidity cut-off was Grade ≥2 late rectal bleeding. Rectal walls were defined as 3 mm inner margins added to the rectum. DVHs for simulated slice thicknesses from 3 to 13 mm were compared to DVHs for the originally acquired slice thicknesses at 3 and 5 mm. Volumes, mean, and maximum doses were assessed from the DVHs, and generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) values were calculated. For each organ and each of the simulated slice thicknesses, we performed predictive modeling of late rectal bleeding using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) model. For the most coarse slice thickness, rectal volumes increased (≤18%), whereas maximum and mean doses decreased (≤0.8 and ≤4.2 Gy, respectively). For all a values, the gEUD for the simulated DVHs were ≤1.9 Gy different than the gEUD for the original DVHs. The best-fitting LKB model parameter values with 95% CIs were consistent between all DVHs. In conclusion, we found that the investigated slice thickness variations had minimal impact on rectal dose-response estimations. From the perspective of predictive modeling, our results suggest that variations within 10 mm in slice thickness between cohorts are unlikely to be a limiting factor when pooling multi-institutional rectal dose data that include slice thickness variations within this range.""","""['C Olsson', 'M Thor', 'M Liu', 'V Moissenko', 'S E Petersen', 'M Høyer', 'A Apte', 'J O Deasy']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Influence of organ at risk definition on rectal dose-volume histograms in patients with prostate cancer undergoing external-beam radiotherapy.', 'Comparison of different contouring definitions of the rectum as organ at risk (OAR) and dose-volume parameters predicting rectal inflammation in radiotherapy of prostate cancer: which definition to use?', 'Late rectal bleeding after conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer.

We established pre- and post-operative nomograms estimating biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free probability after RP in Korean men with clinically localized PCa.  Patients and methods:   Our sampling frame included 3,034 consecutive men with clinically localized PCa who underwent RP at our tertiary centers from June 2004 through July 2011. After inappropriate data exclusion, we evaluated 2,867 patients for the development of nomograms. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to develop pre- and post-operative nomograms that predict BCR-free probability. Finally, we resampled from our study cohort 200 times to determine the accuracy of our nomograms on internal validation, which were designated with concordance index (c-index) and further represented by calibration plots.  Results:   Over a median of 47 months of follow-up, the estimated BCR-free rate was 87.8% (1 year), 83.8% (2 year), and 72.5% (5 year). In the pre-operative model, Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA), the proportion of positive biopsy cores, clinical T3a and biopsy Gleason score (GS) were independent predictive factors for BCR, while all relevant predictive factors (PSA, extra-prostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node metastasis, surgical margin, and pathologic GS) were associated with BCR in the post-operative model. The c-index representing predictive accuracy was 0.792 (pre-) and 0.821 (post-operative), showing good fit in the calibration plots.  Conclusions:   In summary, we developed pre- and post-operative nomograms predicting BCR-free probability after RP in a large Korean cohort with clinically localized PCa.

Clot evacuation, bladder fulguration and bladder irrigation had failed in all patients before cystectomy. In addition, 45% of patients had received prior intravesical therapy (aminocaproic acid, alum or formalin), hyperbaric oxygen therapy (25%), nephrostomy tube placement for attempted urinary diversion (15%) and/or selective bladder angioembolization (5%).  Results:   Median patient age at surgery was 77 years (IQR 72, 80) and 81% (17 of 21) of patients were male.

Enucleation studies from outside North America show comparable efficacy and lower morbidity to transurethral resection of the prostate. A few studies exist describing outcomes of vaporization, the most commonly used technique for urologists. We present our 3-month outcomes of thulium laser vaporization of the prostate (ThuVP).  Materials and methods:   From December 2010 to October 2013, 68 men underwent ThuVP using the 150 W CyberTM(®). Data were collected on demographics, comorbidities, intraoperative measures, complications, serum parameters, maximum flow rate (Qmax), postvoid residual (PVR), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality-of-life (QoL) score, and prostate-specific antigen. Patients were evaluated at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. Nine patients were excluded for known prostate cancer.  Results:   The mean age was 66±10 years, with a mean prostate size of 57±30 mL. At baseline, the mean IPSS was 19.9±8.0, QoL score was 4.5±1.1, Qmax was 5.2±4.5 mL/sec, and PVR was 220±397 mL. The mean laser time was 35±18 minutes, and energy used was 234±139 kJ. Forty-seven (78%) patients were discharged the day of surgery. No blood transfusions were administered with a mean drop in hemoglobin of 0.7±0.8 g/dL (p<0.05). There were no Clavien grade≥III complications within 30 days of surgery. Six (10%) patients were diagnosed with urinary tract infection. Significant improvements from baseline were seen in Qmax, PVR, IPSS, and QoL score. All 15 patients who were in retention were voiding at the last follow-up.  Conclusions:   Thulium laser vaporization of the prostate appears to be a safe and effective outpatient technique for the treatment of BPH with durable outcomes at 3 months.""","""['Joseph J Pariser', 'Olufenwa J Famakinwa', 'Shane M Pearce', 'Doreen E Chung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['A comparative study of thulium laser resection of the prostate and bipolar transurethral plasmakinetic prostatectomy for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Bipolar plasma enucleation of the prostate vs open prostatectomy in large benign prostatic hyperplasia cases - a medium term, prospective, randomized comparison.', 'Early outcomes of thulium laser versus transurethral resection of the prostate for managing benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies.', 'Outcomes following Thulium vapoenucleation of large prostates.', 'Thulium (Tm:YAG) laser vaporesection of prostate and bipolar transurethral resection of prostate in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Assessment of Sexual Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Thulium Laser Prostate Surgery for Management of Benign Prostate Hyperplasia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Experimental ex-vivo performance study comparing a novel, pulsed thulium solid-state laser, chopped thulium fibre laser, low and high-power holmium:YAG laser for endoscopic enucleation of the prostate.', ""Nomenclature in thulium laser treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: it's time to pull the rabbit out of the hat."", 'Thulium laser vaporesection of the prostate: Can we operate without interrupting oral antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy?', 'Evidence of the efficacy and safety of the thulium laser in the treatment of men with benign prostatic obstruction.']"""

Methods:   The study comprised 605 patients, treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) with curative intent for PCa who showed rising PSA levels after primary therapy and listed for S-RT. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values were >0.2 ng/mL and <2 ng/mL (mean, 1.05 ng/mL; median, 1.07 ng/mL; range, 0.2-2 ng/m; SD, ±0.59). All patients were classified as N0 after RP. Seventeen of 605 patients received adjuvant RT together with RP, whereas 148 of 605 patients received androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) at the time of PET/CT. PSA, PSA kinetics, Gleason score, age, time to biochemical relapse, ADT, and initial tumor stage were statistically analyzed to assess which factor could influence PET/CT positivity and the detection of local versus distant relapse.  Results:   (11)C-choline PET/CT was positive in 28.4% of patients (172/605). Eighty-three of 605 patients were positive in the pelvis (group A), distant metastasis (group B) were detected in 72 of 605 patients, and local and distant sites of relapse were detected in 17 of 605 patients (group C). At multivariate analysis, PSA, PSA doubling time (PSAdt), and ongoing ADT were significant predictors for positive scan results, whereas PSA and PSAdt were significantly related to distant relapse detection (P < 0.05). At the receiver-operating-characteristic analysis, a PSA value of 1.05 ng/mL and PSAdt of 5.95 mo were determined to be the optimal cutoff values in the prediction of a positive (11)C-choline PET/CT scan, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.625 for PSA and 0.677 for PSAdt.  Conclusion:   (11)C-choline PET/CT may be suggested before S-RT during the early phase of biochemical relapse, to select patients who may benefit from this aggressive treatment.

However, the evidence relating television (TV) viewing and other sedentary behaviors to cancer risk has not been quantitatively summarized.  Methods:   We performed a comprehensive electronic literature search in Cochrane, EMBASE, Medline, and SciSearch databases through February 2014 for published articles investigating sedentary behavior in relation to cancer incidence. Because randomized controlled trials are difficult to perform on this topic, we focused on observational studies that met uniform inclusion criteria. Data were extracted independently by both authors and summarized using random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Data from 43 observational studies including a total of 68936 cancer cases were analyzed. Comparing the highest vs lowest levels of sedentary time, the relative risks (RRs) for colon cancer were 1.54 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 1.98) for TV viewing time, 1.24 (95% CI = 1.09 to 1.41) for occupational sitting time, and 1.24 (95% CI = 1.03 to 1.50) for total sitting time. For endometrial cancer, the relative risks were 1.66 (95% CI = 1.21 to 2.28) for TV viewing time and 1.32 (95% CI = 1.08 to 1.61) for total sitting time. A positive association with overall sedentary behavior was also noted for lung cancer (RR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.43). Sedentary behavior was unrelated to cancers of the breast, rectum, ovaries, prostate, stomach, esophagus, testes, renal cell, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

All taken biopsies were scored (1=worse to 5=best) by one urologist for the following criteria. (1) Accuracy of matching between planned and performed biopsy. (2) Histologic quality of the sample. (3) Elegance, which is the easiness to take the biopsy in proper time, planned position, and best histologic quality. Afterward, the histologic sample quality was evaluated by a blinded pathologist. To show a possible training effect, blinded untrained junior residents performed biopsies in four men (103 cores).  Results:   Overall, 600 single biopsies were analyzed. The trocar-sharpened needles demonstrated a significantly (p<0.05) better scoring for accuracy and elegance rated by the urologist. The histologic quality scored by the pathologist was superior. Moreover, significantly lower target errors with trocar-sharpened needles were achieved by untrained residents, but not by the experienced user.  Conclusion:   Using trocar-sharpened needles helps urologists to perform targeted prostate biopsy more elegantly and accurately.

We sought to determine how reliable multiparametric MRI is in the detection of intraprostatic prostate cancer and what role it has in risk stratification.  Methods:   The histology from 38 whole mount prostate specimens was compared with preoperative multiparametric 3T MRI studies with an endorectal receiver coil in place. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion (b values 50 400 800), perfusion (Ve , Kep , Ktrans , area under the curve) and proton spectroscopic sequences were used.  Results:   For cancers greater than 0.5 cc, the detection rate for combined T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was 85%. For cancers 0.1 cc-0.5 cc, the sensitivity was 52%.Per patient, false positive rate was 50% for combined T2-weighted imaging and DWI. Perfusion imaging had a sensitivity of 70% for tumours greater than 0.5 cc but had a per patient false positive rate of 80% influenced by benign prostatic hypertrophy. In only 15 patients could a satisfactory spectroscopy study be obtained. Weak correlation was found between the Gleason score and tumour size (r = 0.51), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (r = -0.30) and (choline + creatine)/citrate ratio (r = 0.41).  Conclusion:   T2-weighted imaging and DWI in combination were the best strategy for detecting prostate cancer and had a sensitivity of 85% for detecting lesions greater than 0.5 cc. At 3T, an ADC threshold of between 1100-1200.10(-6) mm(2) /s was optimal for diagnosing prostate cancer.

Nonetheless, the hypothesis that ATBF1 has a tumor suppressor function in prostate cancer has not been tested. In this study, we examined the role of ATBF1 in prostatic carcinogenesis by specifically deleting Atbf1 in mouse prostatic epithelial cells. We also examined the effect of Atbf1 deletion on gene expression and signaling pathways in mouse prostates. Histopathologic analyses showed that Atbf1 deficiency caused hyperplasia and mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) primarily in the dorsal prostate but also in other lobes. Hemizygous deletion of Atbf1 also increased the development of hyperplasia and mPIN, indicating a haploinsufficiency of Atbf1. The mPIN lesions expressed luminal cell markers and harbored molecular changes similar to those in human PIN and prostate cancer, including weaker expression of basal cell marker cytokeratin 5 (Ck5), cell adhesion protein E-cadherin, and the smooth muscle layer marker Sma; elevated expression of the oncoproteins phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-Akt and Muc1; and aberrant protein glycosylation. Gene expression profiling revealed a large number of genes that were dysregulated by Atbf1 deletion, particularly those that encode for secretory and cell membrane proteins. The four signaling networks that were most affected by Atbf1 deletion included those centered on Erk1/2 and IGF1, Akt and FSH, NF-κB and progesterone and β-estradiol. These findings provide in vivo evidence that ATBF1 is a tumor suppressor in the prostate, suggest that loss of Atbf1 contributes to tumorigenesis by dysregulating membrane and secretory proteins and multiple signaling pathways, and provide a new animal model for prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaodong Sun', 'Xiaoying Fu', 'Jie Li', 'Changsheng Xing', 'Henry F Frierson', 'Hao Wu', 'Xiaokun Ding', 'Tongzhong Ju', 'Richard D Cummings', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Additive Effect of Zfhx3/Atbf1 and Pten Deletion on Mouse Prostatic Tumorigenesis.', 'Klf5 deletion promotes Pten deletion-initiated luminal-type mouse prostate tumors through multiple oncogenic signaling pathways.', 'Tuberous sclerosis complex 1: an epithelial tumor suppressor essential to prevent spontaneous prostate cancer in aged mice.', 'Molecular genetic aspects of prostate transition zone lesions.', 'Cellular and molecular pathology of prostate cancer precursors.', 'Signal Crosstalk and the Role of Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ) in Prostate Cancer.', 'AR imposes different effects on ZFHX3 transcription depending on androgen status in prostate cancer cells.', 'Exome Sequencing of Pancreatic Acinar Carcinoma Identified Distinctive Mutation Patterns.', 'Sodium bicarbonate transporter NBCe1 regulates proliferation and viability of human prostate cancer cells LNCaP and PC3.', 'Circulating Tumor Cell Genomic Evolution and Hormone Therapy Outcomes in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Over-expression of caveolin-1 is closely related to the tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer. Recently, contrast microbubbles in combination with ultrasound are being investigated for their therapeutic applications in tumor cells. However, the response of caveolin-1 after low-frequency ultrasound and SonoVue treatment in animal model is unclear.  Objective:   The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of 80 kHz ultrasound and/or SonoVue on caveolin-1 expression and secretion in DU145 prostate tumors in nude mice.  Methods:   Six-week-old BALB/c male nude mice were subcutaneously injected with DU145 cells in the right flank to establish a prostate cancer model, which were randomly divided into four groups (n=8 each): control group (sham-ultrasound exposure), SonoVue group, 80 kHz ultrasound group, 80 kHz ultrasound combined with SonoVue group. Tumor volumes and wet weights were measured, and the tumor volume curve was obtained as well. The mice were euthanized 21 days after treatment. Specimens of the tumor tissues were assessed the expression of caveolin-1 by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The serum concentrations of caveolin-1 were detected by ELISA.  Results:   Treatment with ultrasound alone produced tumor volumes and weights reduction compared with control and SonoVue group. Combined ultrasound and SonoVue treatment produced greater tumor regression than either treatment alone (p < 0.05). Serum caveolin-1 concentrations were lower in the combination of ultrasound and SonoVue group than they were in control group (p =0.005), and had some certain correlation with tumor growth (wet weight) (r =0.507), although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.199). Ultrasound alone treatment only slightly reduced the caveolin-1 concentrations in comparison with the control, and the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.125). The ultrasound-treated mice showed significant reduction in expression levels of caveolin-1 protein, compared with the control (p < 0.05).

Targeting the androgen receptor (AR) by antagonists is used as hormone therapy for prostate cancer (PCa), however, eventually therapy resistance occurs in most patients. In most of these cancer the AR signaling is active and thus AR remains an important drug target. Since many years we are characterizing novel chemical structural platforms to provide a broader possibility for compounds that bind to and act as AR antagonists. Here, we describe the chemical synthesis of a battery of novel steroidal derivatives as nor-homo-, spiro-oxolan- and spiro-oxetan- steroids. They modulate the transcriptional activity of the human AR. As AR antagonists, the spiro-oxetan- steroid derivatives seem to be the most potent steroid derivatives. They inhibit the transcriptional activity of both wild-type AR as well as the AR mutant T877A. In line with this, these compounds bind to the human AR and inhibit the proliferation of the human androgen-dependent growing PCa cell line LNCaP. Interestingly, the castration-resistant AR expressing human PC3-AR cells are also growth inhibited. On mechanistic level, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays with living cells indicate that the androgen-induced N/C terminal interaction of the AR is inhibited by the investigated compounds. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays in living cells suggest a higher mobility of the AR in the cell nuclei in the presence of spiro-oxetan- steroidal antagonists. Together, these findings suggest that spiro-oxetan- steroids are very useful as a chemical platform for novel AR antagonists.""","""['Marie Thiele', 'Sebastian Rabe', 'Wiebke Hessenkemper', 'Daniela Roell', 'Sophie Bartsch', 'Florian Kraft', 'Tsion E Abraham', 'Adriaan B Houtsmuller', 'Martin E van Royen', 'Athanassios Giannis', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Curr Med Chem""","""['Halogen-substituted anthranilic acid derivatives provide a novel chemical platform for androgen receptor antagonists.', 'Antiandrogenic effects of novel androgen synthesis inhibitors on hormone-dependent prostate cancer.', 'A novel steroidal antiandrogen targeting wild type and mutant androgen receptors.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Interleukin-23 Represses the Level of Cell Senescence Induced by the Androgen Receptor Antagonists Enzalutamide and Darolutamide in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Overview on the complexity of androgen receptor-targeted therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Design:   Clinical decision analysis was used to synthesise data from recently emerging evidence in a format that is relevant for clinical decision making.  Population:   A hypothetical cohort of 1000 men with suspected prostate cancer.  Interventions:   mpMRI and, if positive, MRI-targeted biopsy compared with TRUS-guided biopsy in all men.  Outcome measures:   We report the number of men expected to undergo a biopsy as well as the numbers of correctly identified patients with or without prostate cancer. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out using Monte Carlo simulation to explore the impact of statistical uncertainty in the diagnostic parameters.  Results:   In 1000 men, mpMRI followed by MRI-targeted biopsy 'clinically dominates' TRUS-guided biopsy as it results in fewer expected biopsies (600 vs 1000), more men being correctly identified as having clinically significant cancer (320 vs 250), and fewer men being falsely identified (20 vs 50). The mpMRI-based strategy dominated TRUS-guided biopsy in 86% of the simulations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis.  Conclusions:   Our analysis suggests that mpMRI followed by MRI-targeted biopsy is likely to result in fewer and better biopsies than TRUS-guided biopsy.

Before August 2011, RALP with or without PLND included a routine peritoneal drain placed during surgery. Thereafter, routine intraoperative placement of drains was omitted, except for intraoperatively noted anastomotic leakage. We used multivariable logistic regression to compare complication rates between study periods and the actual drain placement status after adjusting for standard prespecified covariates.  Results:   Most patients (92%) did not have ≥grade 2 complications after surgery and only two patients (0.3%) experienced a grade 4 complication. The absolute adjusted risk of a grade 2-5 complication was 0.9% greater among those treated before August 2011 (95% confidence interval [CI] -3.3%-5.1%; p=0.7), while absolute adjusted risk of a grade 3-5 complication was 2.8% less (-2.8%; 95% CI-5.3%-0.1%; p=0.061).

Here we report that TMEPAI is localized to the lysosome and late endosome, and that association of TMEPAI with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 is required for its transport to the lysosome. TMEPAI associates with the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and promotes its degradation in the lysosome. Depletion of TMEPAI in A549 lung cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while TMEPAI expression in nude mice promotes tumorigenesis.

The anti-microbial effects of the trihydroxy ketone against a panel of nine pathogenic bacteria and three fungi were also assessed. The trihydroxy ketone exerted significant apoptotic activity in PC-3 prostate cancer cells at 100 μM, while it inhibited NF-κB phosphorylation and IL-6 secretion at a concentration range 10(-6)-10(-4)M.

In prostate cancer, particularly, glycolytic metabolism differs in androgen-responsive and nonresponsive cells. In addition, some natural compounds with antiproliferative activities are able to modify glucose entry into cells by either modulating glucose transporter (GLUT) expression or by altering glucose binding. The aim of this work was to study the regulation of some GLUTs (GLUT1 and GLUT4) in both androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3) prostate cancer cells by 4 structurally different flavonoids (ie, genistein, phloretin, apigenin, and daidzein). Glucose uptake was measured using nonradiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose. The evaluation of protein levels as well as subcellular distribution of GLUT1/4 were analyzed by Western blot and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Androgen-insensitive LNCaP-R and androgen-sensitive PC-3-AR cells were used to study the effect of androgen signaling. Additionally, a docking simulation was employed to compare interactions between flavonoids and XylE, a bacterial homolog of GLUT1 to -4. Results show for the first time the presence of functionally relevant GLUT4 in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, differences in GLUT1 and GLUT4 levels and glucose uptake were found, without differences on subcellular distribution, after incubation with flavonoids. Docking simulation showed that all compounds interact with the same location of transporters. More importantly, differences between androgen-sensitive and -insensitive prostate cancer cells were found in both GLUT protein levels and glucose uptake. Thus, phenotypic characteristics of prostate cancer cells are responsible for the different effects of these flavonoids in glucose uptake and in GLUT expression rather than their structural differences, with the most effective in reducing cell growth being the highest in modifying glucose uptake and GLUT levels.""","""['Pedro Gonzalez-Menendez', 'David Hevia', 'Aida Rodriguez-Garcia', 'Juan C Mayo', 'Rosa M Sainz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Androgen-responsive and nonresponsive prostate cancer cells present a distinct glycolytic metabolism profile.', 'Androgens enhance the glycolytic metabolism and lactate export in prostate cancer cells by modulating the expression of GLUT1, GLUT3, PFK, LDH and MCT4 genes.', 'GLUT1 protects prostate cancer cells from glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress.', 'The dark side of glucose transporters in prostate cancer: Are they a new feature to characterize carcinomas?', 'Sex steroid hormone metabolism and prostate cancer.', 'Metabolic syndrome-related prognostic index: Predicting biochemical recurrence and differentiating between cold and hot tumors in prostate cancer.', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Modulates Multiple Downstream Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer Inhibiting Cell Invasiveness.', 'An appraisal of the current status of inhibition of glucose transporters as an emerging antineoplastic approach: Promising potential of new pan-GLUT inhibitors.', 'Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Propolis and Its Polyphenolic Compounds against Cancer.', 'Glucose transporters: Important regulators of endometrial cancer therapy sensitivity.']"""

We speculated that the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by glucosamine might be a functional consequence of the reduced N-glycosylation of gp130.

Glucosamine effects on N-glycosylation of glycoproteins were determined by Western blot analysis. IL-6 binding to DU145 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The cell proliferation suppression was investigated by colorimetric Janus green staining method.  Results:   In DU145 cells glucosamine reduced the N-glycosylation of gp130, decreased IL-6 binding to cells and impaired the phosphorylation of JAK2, SHP2 and STAT3. Glucosamine acts in a very similar manner to tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein N-glycosylation. Glucosamine-mediated inhibition of N-glycosylation was neither protein- nor cell-specific. Sensitivity of DU145, A2058 and PC-3 cells to glucosamine-induced inhibition of N-glycosylation were well correlated to glucosamine cytotoxicity in these cells.  Conclusion:   Our results suggested that the glucosamine-induced global inhibition of protein N-glycosylation might be the basic mechanism underlying its multiple biochemical and cellular effects.""","""['Viktor Chesnokov', 'Beata Gong', 'Chao Sun', 'Keiichi Itakura']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Cell Int""","""['Glucosamine suppresses proliferation of human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells through inhibition of STAT3 signaling.', 'Scoparone exerts anti-tumor activity against DU145 prostate cancer cells via inhibition of STAT3 activity.', 'A SOCS-1 peptide mimetic inhibits both constitutive and IL-6 induced activation of STAT3 in prostate cancer cells.', 'The inhibition of N-glycosylation of glycoprotein 130 molecule abolishes STAT3 activation by IL-6 family cytokines in cultured cardiac myocytes.', 'TNF-alpha induces tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of the Src homology protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2 to the gp130 signal-transducing subunit of the IL-6 receptor complex.', 'Small molecule inhibitors of mammalian glycosylation.', 'Distinctive carbohydrate profiles of black ginseng revealed by IM-MS combined with PMP labeling and multivariate data analysis.', 'Nutrient Sensor mTOR and OGT: Orchestrators of Organelle Homeostasis in Pancreatic β-Cells.', 'Role of Protein Glycosylation in Host-Pathogen Interaction.', 'Glucosamine Enhances TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis in the Prostate Cancer Cell Line DU145.']"""

For the first time this permits accurate assessment of prostate cancer presentation and treatment according to clinical factors at diagnosis.  Materials and methods:   We used the SEER database to identify men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 2010 who were assigned NCCN(®) risk based on clinical factors. We identified sociodemographic factors associated with high risk disease and analyzed the impact of these factors along with NCCN risk on local treatment.  Results:   Of the 42,403 men identified disease was high, intermediate and low risk in 38%, 40% and 22%, respectively. On multivariate analysis patients who were older, nonwhite, unmarried or living in a county with a higher poverty rate were more likely to be diagnosed with high risk disease (each p <0.05). Of the 38,634 men in whom prostate cancer was the first malignancy 23% underwent no local treatment, 40% were treated with prostatectomy, 36% received radiation therapy and 1% underwent local tumor destruction, predominantly cryotherapy. On multivariate analysis patients who were older, black, unmarried or living in a county with a higher poverty rate, or who had low risk disease were less likely to receive local treatment (each p <0.05).

In cultured noncancerous epithelial cells, KLF5 converts from proproliferative to antiproliferative activity upon TGFβ-induced acetylation, which sequentially alters the KLF5 transcriptional complex and the expression of genes such as p15 and MYC. In this study, we tested whether the acetylation status of KLF5 also determines its opposing functions in tumorigenesis using the PC-3 and DU 145 prostate cancer cell lines, whose proliferation is inhibited by TGFβ. KLF5 inhibited the proliferation of these cancer cells, and the inhibition was dependent on KLF5 acetylation. MYC and p15 showed the same patterns of expression change found in noncancerous cells. In nude mice, KLF5 also suppressed tumor growth in an acetylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, deacetylation switched KLF5 to tumor promoting activity, and blocking TGFβ signaling attenuated the tumor suppressor activity of KLF5. RNA sequencing and comprehensive data analysis suggest that multiple molecules, including RELA, p53, CREB1, MYC, JUN, ER, AR and SP1, mediate the opposing functions of AcKLF5 and unAcKLF5. These results provide novel insights into the mechanism by which KLF5 switches from antitumorigenic to protumorigenic function and also suggest the roles of AcKLF5 and unAcKLF5, respectively, in the tumor suppressing and tumor promoting functions of TGFβ.""","""['Xin Li', 'Baotong Zhang', 'Qiao Wu', 'Xinpei Ci', 'Ranran Zhao', 'Zhiqian Zhang', 'Siyuan Xia', 'Dan Su', 'Jie Chen', 'Gui Ma', 'Liya Fu', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Acetylation of KLF5 alters the assembly of p15 transcription factors in transforming growth factor-beta-mediated induction in epithelial cells.', 'Pro-proliferative factor KLF5 becomes anti-proliferative in epithelial homeostasis upon signaling-mediated modification.', 'Ras inhibits TGF-β-induced KLF5 acetylation and transcriptional complex assembly via regulating SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in epithelial cells.', 'Essential role of KLF5 transcription factor in cell proliferation and differentiation and its implications for human diseases.', 'The double life of KLF5: Opposing roles in regulation of gene-expression, cellular function, and transformation.', 'KLF5 inhibition potentiates anti-PD1 efficacy by enhancing CD8+ T-cell-dependent antitumor immunity.', 'Nitazoxanide inhibits acetylated KLF5-induced bone metastasis by modulating KLF5 function in prostate cancer.', 'New insights into KLFs and SOXs in cancer pathogenesis, stemness, and therapy.', 'Predicting 3D Structure, Cross Talks, and Prognostic Significance of KLF9 in Cervical Cancer.', 'Krüppel-like factor (KLF)5: An emerging foe of cardiovascular health.']"""

Moreover, targets of existing drugs and treatments were found to be consistently associated with high TRPM2-AS levels in both targeted cells and patients, ultimately suggesting that the measurement of the expression levels of TRPM2-AS allows not only for the early identification of aggressive PCa tumors, but also identifies a subset of at-risk patients who would benefit from currently available, but mostly differently purposed, therapeutic agents.""","""['U Orfanelli', 'E Jachetti', 'F Chiacchiera', 'M Grioni', 'P Brambilla', 'A Briganti', 'M Freschi', 'F Martinelli-Boneschi', 'C Doglioni', 'F Montorsi', 'M Bellone', 'G Casari', 'D Pasini', 'G Lavorgna']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Prognostic marker and target in prostate cancer.', 'TRPM2 mediates distruption of autophagy machinery and correlates with the grade level in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of novel sense and antisense transcription at the TRPM2 locus in cancer.', 'Prognostic marker and target in prostate cancer.', 'TRPM2: a multifunctional ion channel for oxidative stress sensing.', 'Clinical prospects of long noncoding RNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Oncogene-targeting nanoprobes for early imaging detection of tumor.', 'A novel strategy for treating cancer: understanding the role of Ca2+ signaling from nociceptive TRP channels in regulating cancer progression.', 'Signaling Pathways and Targeted Therapies for Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA TRPM2 antisense RNA as a potential therapeutic target promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in esophageal cancer.', 'TRPM2-AS promotes the malignancy of osteosarcoma cells by targeting miR-15b-5p/PPM1D axis.']"""

Subjects/patients and methods:   We analysed data from 6426 men in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study with at least one on-study biopsy. REDUCE compared dutasteride vs placebo on prostate cancer risk among men with an elevated PSA level and negative pre-study biopsy and included two on-study biopsies regardless of PSA level at 2 and 4 years. Available data for MetS-like components included data on diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and body mass index. The association between number of these MetS-like components and prostate cancer risk and low-grade (Gleason sum <7) or high-grade (Gleason sum >7) vs no prostate cancer was evaluated using logistic regression.  Results:   In all, 2171 men (34%) had one MetS-like component, 724 (11%) had two, and 163 (3%) had three or four. Men with more MetS-like components had lower PSA levels (P = 0.029).

Conclusion:   When biopsies are largely PSA level independent, men with an initial elevated PSA level and a previous negative biopsy, and multiple MetS-like components were at an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, suggesting the link between MetS-like components and high-grade prostate cancer is unrelated to a lowered PSA level.""","""['Katharine N Sourbeer', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'Daniel M Moreira', 'Ramiro Castro-Santamaria', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Adriana C Vidal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise as a marker of prostate cancer in men treated with dutasteride: lessons from the REDUCE study.', 'Serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone and prostate cancer risk in the placebo arm of the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events trial.', 'Statin use and risk of prostate cancer and high-grade prostate cancer: results from the REDUCE study.', 'Prostate cancer detection and dutasteride: utility and limitations of prostate-specific antigen in men with previous negative biopsies.', '5-α-Reductase inhibitors for prostate cancer chemoprevention: an updated Cochrane systematic review.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Physical Inactivity, Metabolic Syndrome and Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Development of a Predicting Nomogram.', 'Metabolic syndrome and metastatic prostate cancer correlation study, a real-world study in a prostate cancer clinical research center, Xinjiang, China.', 'Metabolic syndrome is associated with aggressive prostate cancer regardless of race.', 'The Association Between Metabolic Syndrome and Prostate Cancer Risk: A Large-Scale Investigation and Study of Chinese.']"""

To investigate the effect on cell growth for this cleavage event we established stable cell lines that express wild-type-PAR-4 or the caspase cleavage resistant mutant PAR-4 D131G under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Induction of the wild-type protein but not the mutant interfered with cell proliferation, predominantly through induction of apoptosis. We further demonstrate that TNFα-induced apoptosis leads to caspase-8-dependent PAR-4-cleavage followed by nuclear accumulation of the C-terminal PAR-4 (132-340) fragment, which then induces apoptosis.

We sought to identify determinants of prescribing commonly used antidepressants.  Patients and methods:   This multi-institutional study enrolled 3106 ambulatory patients with cancer of the breast, prostate, colon/rectum, or lung. Five case-finding methods were used to identify patients with depressive symptoms. Logistic models were used to examine factors that impact antidepressant use.  Results:   Approximately, 47% of patients were defined as having depressive symptoms. Clinicians rated being sad/depressed as one of the top three priority problems for 10.5% of patients. Antidepressants were prescribed in 19% of all patients, 25% with depressive symptoms and 14% nondepressed patients. After adjusting for other covariates, these variable categories were significantly associated with greater use of antidepressants: depressive symptoms, family history of depression, concurrent medication use, cancer treatment status, and certain other clinical and demographic variables. The strongest individual predictors were concurrent use of more than 10 medications (odds ratio [OR] = 3.3), a family history of depression (OR = 2.2), sedative use (OR = 2.1), non-Hispanic white race (OR = 2.0), and anxiolytics use (OR = 2.0).  Conclusions:   Depressive symptoms are found in nearly half of outpatients with cancer, and one-fourth of patients with depressive symptoms are taking an antidepressant.

The following schemes and criteria for functional outcomes were used: Ingelman-Sundberg score using International Continence Society (ICS) questionnaire (A and B), International prostate symptom score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) points, the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaires (QLQ C-30). HSH was performed under spinal or general anaesthesia using the Ablatherm® Integrated Imaging device. Patients with obstructive voiding symptoms at the time of treatment underwent an endoscopic bladder neck resection or incision during the same anaesthesia to prevent the risk of postoperative obstruction.  Results:   After HSH the mean (sd) PSA nadir was 0.69 (0.83) ng/mL at a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 16.3 (10.5-24.5) months. Disease progression occurred in 16/48 (33%). Of these, four had local recurrence in the untreated lobe and four bilaterally, six developed metastases, and two had rising PSA levels without local recurrence or radiological confirmed metastasis. Progression-free survival rates at 12, 18, and 24 months were 83%, 64%, and 52%. Severe incontinence occurred in four of the 48 patients (8%), eight (17%) required one pad a day, and 36/48 (75%) were pad-free. The ICS questionnaire showed a mean (sd) deterioration from 0.7 (2.0) to 2.3 (4.5) for scores A and 0.6 (1.4) to 1.6 (3.0) for B. The mean (sd) IPSS and erectile function (IIEF-5) scores decreased from a mean (sd) of 7.01 (5.6) to 8.6 (5.1) and from 11.2 (8.6) to 7.0 (5.8), respectively. The mean (sd) EORTC QLC-30 scores before and after HSH were 35.7 (8.6) vs 36.8 (8.6).

Serum PSP94 (sPSP94), a major secreted prostate protein, is indicated as a PCa marker. The potential of sPSP94 and sPSA in conjunction with each other to improve specificity of diagnostic test for PCa needs to be evaluated.  Methods:   PCa patients (n=33), BPH patients (n=44) and healthy controls (n=50) were recruited. A serum-based sandwich ELISA was developed to measure sPSP94 concentrations. Utility of sPSP94 in improving specificity of sPSA test was evaluated by studying sPSP94/sPSA ratios of study participants.  Results:   Considerable decrease in overlap among sPSP94/sPSA ratio values of BPH and PCa patients was observed, as compared to sPSP94 or sPSA alone. For differentiating between BPH and PCa patients, this ratio had a maximum area under the curve (AUC) of 0.859 (P=0.0132) and had a comparable sensitivity (90.91%) to sPSA with an increased specificity of 70.45%. Further, decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that sPSP94/sPSA ratio had a superior net benefit in identifying PCa, in patients opting for biopsy.

The tight junction proteins, claudin 3 and claudin 4, serve as cell-surface receptors for the pore-forming Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin [CPE]. Most prostate cancer cells overexpress claudin 3 and claudin 4, and claudins are aberrantly distributed over the plasma membrane, making these cells particularly sensitive to cytolysis by CPE. Prostate cancer cells secrete PSA locally that is proteolytically active; however, circulating PSA is inactivated via binding to protease inhibitors. To overcome systemic toxicity of CPE, a modified protoxin was constructed with a tethered ligand attached to the C-terminus connected by a flexible linker containing a PSA-specific protease cleavage site.

Furosemide and oral hydration can be administered concomitantly to reduce urinary activity to provide better detectability of retroperitoneal and pelvic lesions. Currently it is unknown if there is any effect of furosemide on (18)F-FECh uptake in organs, tissues and tumour lesions and the extent to which image quality along the urinary tract may be improved by furosemide.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed 217 (18)F-FECh PET/CT examinations from 213 patients with known prostate cancer (PCa), performed either with oral hydration (109) or furosemide 20 mg together with oral hydration (108). Maximum (18)F-FECh uptake in different organs, tissues, lymph nodes and osseous metastases was quantified in terms of standardized uptake value (SUV) in a volume of interest and compared between the two groups. To characterize the impact of furosemide on lesion detectability a three-point rating scale was used to assess the presence of focal activity spots in the ureters and of perivesicular artefacts.  Results:   Patient characteristics and distribution of tumour lesions were well balanced between the two groups. Overall, SUVmax values from normal organs were increased after furosemide compared to the values in patients scanned without furosemide. Significant changes were observed in the salivary glands, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, gluteus muscle and perirenal fat. SUVmax values were significantly decreased after furosemide in lymph node metastases (SUVmax 4.81 ± 2.68 vs. 6.48 ± 4.22, p = 0.0006), but not in osseous metastases. Evaluation of image quality along the urinary tract revealed significantly better depiction of the perivesicular space and significantly less focal tracer accumulation in the ureters in patients receiving furosemide, but the number of detected lymph nodes was not significantly different.  Conclusion:   Furosemide administration reduced choline uptake in tumour lesions, especially significant in pelvic lymph node metastases. Although furosemide administration improved image quality, optimal image quality may also be obtained by adequate hydration without the risk of diminishing choline uptake in PCa lesions. Therefore a controlled hydration protocol seems more appropriate than administration of furosemide.""","""['H Christian Rischke', 'Teresa Beck', 'Werner Vach', 'Gesche Wieser', 'Anca L Grosu', 'Wolfgang Schultze-Seemann', 'Philipp T Meyer', 'Cordula A Jilg']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The nonspecific lymph node uptake of 18F-choline in patients with prostate cancer--a prospective observational study.', 'Spectrum of metastatic and nonmetastatic skeletal findings with dual-phase 18F-FECH PET/CT in patients with biochemical relapse of prostate cancer.', '18FFluoroethylcholine.', '18FFluoro-1,2-2H4choline.', 'PET Using a GRPR Antagonist 68Ga-RM26 in Healthy Volunteers and Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'MRI versus ⁶⁸Ga-PSMA PET/CT for gross tumour volume delineation in radiation treatment planning of primary prostate cancer.']"""

Purpose:   To investigate the potential clinical utility of TUS elastography in diagnosing lung cancer proven by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB).  Material and methods:   TUS elastography was performed in 95 consecutive patients (71 men, 24 women; age, 62.84 ± 7.37 years) with lesions suspected of involving the chest wall or the pleura detected on chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT). Patients with pleural effusions were not enrolled, but were further evaluated by pleural fluid cytology. Patients were excluded from the study if a diagnosis had already been made based on sputum cytology and/or bronchoscopic histology (making TUS biopsy unnecessary) or if their lung lesions could not be visualized under standard US. Under FNAB, 34 consolidations were ascribed to pneumonia and 65 to cancer. Under TUS, tissue stiffness, detected using a convex multifrequency 2-8-mHz probe and a MyLab™Twice - ElaXto, was scored from 1 (greatest elasticity) to 5 (no elasticity). Subpleural solid masses (2-5 cm) were initially detected by TUS and subsequently assessed by FNAB.  Results:   Histological diagnoses were: small cell lung cancer (4/61), adenocarcinoma (29/61), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (12/61), large cell lung carcinoma (12/61), and lymphomas (4/61). Patients' age and mass sizes (3.06 ± 0.88 cm) were not significantly associated with any histological type. A significant lower elasticity of SCC (4.67 ± 0.492) was observed versus other types of lung cancer (P < 0.005), and versus pneumonia (2.35 ± 0.48).  Conclusion:   Since only squamous cell lung carcinoma displays the feature of significantly reduced elasticity, and since no clear-cut diagnostic key is yet available, the clinical usefulness of TUS elastography is currently limited with a view to characterizing tumors.

Methods:   We combined data from three sources: the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry data on incident breast cancers diagnosed in women aged 15-44 years between 2004 and 2006; treatment data from NPCR's 2004 Breast and Prostate Cancer Data Quality and Patterns of Care (PoC) study; and data on women's intentions to have children from the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG).  Results:   In the cancer registry data, an average of 20,308 women with breast cancer aged <45 years were diagnosed annually. Based on estimates from PoC data, almost all of these survivors (97%, 19,416 women) were hormone receptor positive or received chemotherapy and would be at risk for infertility. These women need information about the impact of treatments on fertility. Estimates based on NSFG data suggest approximately half of these survivors (9,569 women) might want children and could benefit from fertility counseling and fertility preservation.  Conclusion:   Nearly all young breast cancer survivors in the U.S. are at risk for infertility. Physicians should discuss the potential impact of treatment on fertility.

Selectively inhibiting neoangiogenesis by targeting tumor-associated blood vessels is an important therapeutic strategy. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed in the tumor-associated neovasculature of most solid cancers making it an interesting therapeutic target. We thought to study the expression of PSMA in a series of CRCs in order to test for its possible use as a target for antiangiogenic cancer therapy in Egyptian patients. One hundred CRC cases were retrieved. Representative sections from each tumor were subjected to immunohistochemistry using PSMA antibodies and CD31 antibodies as reference marker. Accordingly vascular endothelial cell immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively scored. PSMA immunostaining was positive in the neovasculature of 75% of tumors.

Subjects and methods:   Twenty-nine patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer undergoing MRI examinations were imaged with two diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) protocols: current standard clinical protocol (6.7 mm(3) voxels) and a new high-resolution protocol (3.1 mm(3) voxels). Diffusion-weighted images were independently and subjectively scored on lesion conspicuity, internal architecture definition, and overall image quality by two radiologists. Average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in normal tissue and cancerous lesions on both sequences. Reader scores and ADC and contrast values were compared between the two protocols. Cancer ADC values were correlated with Gleason scores.  Results:   The signal-to-noise ratio of the new high-resolution DWI protocol was 40% lower than that of the standard protocol. The reader scores were higher by 0.73 (range, 0.29-1.16) grades, or 19% (range, 7-32%), on average, for the new protocol, indicating better image quality. The average ADC values were 8% higher with the new protocol, with ADC contrast values between cancer and normal prostate unchanged. There was marginally significant correlation of cancer ADC values with Gleason scores (p = 0.05, r ≈ -0.36).  Conclusion:   We showed that for DWI of the prostate at 3-7 mm(3) voxel sizes the benefits of higher spatial resolution outweigh the effects of reduced signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, potentially improving the sensitivity to small or sparse prostate cancers.

A total of 372 variables were used for prediction modeling, among which 343 genetic variations. Toxicity was scored using an in-house developed toxicity scale.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether vitamin D status is associated with the incidence of these cancers in older men.  Design:   Prospective cohort study.  Setting and participants:   4208 older men aged 70-88 years in Perth, Western Australia.  Main outcome measures:   Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was measured by immunoassay. New diagnoses of prostate, colorectal and lung cancers were determined via electronic record linkage.  Results:   During a mean follow-up of 6.7±1.8 years, there were 315, 117 and 101 new diagnoses of prostate, colorectal and lung cancer. In multivariate competing risks proportional hazards models, every 10 nmol/l decrease in 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a 4% reduction in prostate cancer incidence (sub-hazard ratio [SHR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-1.00). Every halving of 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a 21% reduction in incident prostate cancer in multivariate analysis (SHR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99). Following exclusion of prostate cancer cases diagnosed within 3 years of blood sampling, low 25(OH)D <50 nmol/l was associated with lower incident prostate cancer, and higher 25(OH)D >75 nmol/l was associated with higher incidence, when compared to the reference range 50-75 nmol/l, respectively (p = 0.027). Significant associations were also observed when 25(OH)D was modeled as a quantitative variable. No associations were observed between plasma 25(OH)D concentration with incidence of colorectal or lung cancer.  Conclusion:   Lower levels of vitamin D may reduce prostate cancer risk in older men. By contrast, levels of vitamin D did not predict incidence of colorectal or lung cancers.

In a considerable proportion of men receiving androgen deprivation therapy, however, PCa progresses to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), making the development of efficient therapies challenging. We used an orthotopic VCaP human PCa xenograft model to study cellular and molecular changes in tumors after androgen deprivation therapy (castration). Tumor growth was monitored through weekly serum prostate-specific antigen measurements, and mice with recurrent tumors after castration were randomized to treatment groups. Serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations showed significant correlation with tumor volume. Castration-resistant tumors retained concentrations of intratumoral androgen (androstenedione, testosterone, and 5α-dihydrotestosterone) at levels similar to tumors growing in intact hosts. Accordingly, castration induced up-regulation of enzymes involved in androgen synthesis (CYP17A1, AKR1C3, and HSD17B6), as well as expression of full-length androgen receptor (AR) and AR splice variants (AR-V1 and AR-V7). Furthermore, AR target gene expression was maintained in castration-resistant xenografts. The AR antagonists enzalutamide (MDV3100) and ARN-509 suppressed PSA production of castration-resistant tumors, confirming the androgen dependency of these tumors.

African American (AA) men with PCa present with higher tumor volume, more advanced tumor stage, and higher Gleason score. This could be in part related to the AR expression or activity in the prostate tissue of AA men, or to unique mutations or polymorphisms of the AR. In Caucasian Americans (CAs), AR mutations are rare or infrequent in organ-confined tumors, but occur at a higher rate in advanced, metastatic, or castrate-recurrent disease. In AAs, the prevalence, clinical, and biological significance of AR mutations in PCa are unknown. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of somatic and germline AR mutations in patients with primary PCa in AAs compared with CAs. Due to very limited data available on allelic distribution of E213 (G/A) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we also assessed this in patients with sporadic PCa and in unrelated healthy individuals from both ethnic populations. Somatic missense AR mutations were detected at a higher rate in AAs (17 out of 200 cases) than in CAs (2 out of 100 cases). In AAs, the majority of these mutations (41.1%) were from Gleason 7 tumors, a small portion (23.5%) from Gleason 8 tumors, and the rest (35.2%) from Gleason 6 tumors. Analysis of genomic DNAs extracted from white blood cells of patients with sporadic PCa revealed that the rate of germline AR mutations were also higher (~4 times) in AAs than in CAs. With respect to E213 (G/A) SNP, the E213 A-allele expression was 5.85 times higher in healthy unrelated AA men than in CA men. However, in AAs with somatic AR mutation, the E213 G-allele distribution was almost equal to the A-allele. Silencing of one of the somatic AR mutations (i.e., 597 Ser>Gly) in a primary AA-PCa cell line (e.g., E006AA) revealed that similar AR mutation can be associated simultaneously with both ""gain-of-function"" phenotype (cell migration and invasion) and a ""loss-of-function"" phenotype (proliferation). Our data demonstrated a higher susceptibility for genetic alterations in the AR in the form of somatic mutations in sporadic PCa or in the form of germline mutations in AAs as compared with CAs. These data may support the idea that AR-specific hypermutator phenotype in combination with other genes, might serve as a contributing factor to ethnic differences in PCa and potentially different clinical outcome in AAs as a high-risk population.""","""['Shahriar Koochekpour', 'Erick Buckles', 'Mojgan Shourideh', 'SiYi Hu', 'Dhyan Chandra', 'Jovanny Zabaleta', 'Kristopher Attwood']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""['Identification of a novel germline missense mutation of the androgen receptor in African American men with familial prostate cancer.', 'Germline Mutations and Polymorphisms of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Patients: Frequency and Results of in Silico Analysis.', 'Establishment and characterization of a highly tumorigenic African American prostate cancer cell line, E006AA-hT.', 'Racial disparities: disruptive genes in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Molecular basis for prostate cancer racial disparities.', 'Genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic signatures of prostate cancer between African American and European American patients.', 'Race-specific prostate cancer outcomes in a cohort of military health care beneficiaries undergoing surgery: 1990-2017.', 'Race-specific prostate cancer outcomes in a cohort of low and favorable-intermediate risk patients who underwent external beam radiation therapy from 1990 to 2017.', 'Racial disparities in prostate cancer: A complex interplay between socioeconomic inequities and genomics.', 'RNA expression differences in prostate tumors and tumor-adjacent stroma between Black and White Americans.']"""

The present studies demonstrate that androgen-dependent andromedin-driven growth stimulation is counter-balanced by androgen-induced AR signaling within normal adult prostate epithelial cells resulting in terminal G0 growth arrest coupled with terminal differentiation into ΔNp63-negative, PSA-expressing secretory luminal cells. This cell autonomous AR-driven terminal differentiation requires DNA-binding of the AR protein, is associated with decreases in c-Myc m-RNA and protein, are coupled with increases in p21, p27, and SKP-2 protein expression, and does not require functional p53. These changes result in down-regulation of Cyclin D1 protein and RB phosphoryation. shRNA knockdown documents that neither RB, p21, p27 alone or in combination are required for such AR-induced G0 growth arrest. Transgenic expression of a constitutive vector to prevent c-Myc down-regulation overrides AR-mediated growth arrest in normal prostate epithelial cells, which documents that AR-induced c-Myc down-regulation is critical in terminal growth arrest of normal prostate epithelial cells. In contrast, in prostate cancer cells, androgen-induced AR signaling paradoxically up-regulates c-Myc expression and stimulates growth as documented by inhibition of both of these responses following exposure to the AR antagonist, bicalutamide.

Resistance of advanced prostate cancer to available treatment options makes it a clinical challenge that results in approximately 30,000 deaths of American men every year. Since the historic discovery by Dr. Huggins more than 70 years ago, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the principal treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Initially, ADT induces apoptosis of androgen-dependent prostate cancer epithelial cells and regression of androgen-dependent tumors. However, the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer progress and become refractory to ADT due to emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells driven by aberrant AR activation. Microtubule-targeting agents such as taxanes, docetaxel and paclitaxel, have enjoyed success in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer; although new, recently designed mitosis-specific agents, such as the polo-kinase and kinesin-inhibitors, have yielded clinically disappointing results. Docetaxel, as a first-line chemotherapy, improves prostate cancer patient survival by months, but tumor resistance to these therapeutic agents inevitably develops. On a molecular level, progression to CRPC is characterized by aberrant AR expression, de novo intraprostatic androgen production, and cross talk with other oncogenic pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that reactivation of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) processes may facilitate the development of not only prostate cancer but also prostate cancer metastases. EMT is characterized by gain of mesenchymal characteristics and invasiveness accompanied by loss of cell polarity, with an increasing number of studies focusing on the direct involvement of androgen-AR signaling axis in EMT, tumor progression, and therapeutic resistance.

The evolving treatment of PCNSL has greatly improved the outcome for patients with this disease and has stimulated interest in second malignancies (SMs) in patients diagnosed with PCNSL.  Methods:   The records of 129 cases of PCNSL at Mayo Clinic, diagnosed between January 1, 1988, and November 26, 2012, were reviewed. Data on clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatments, outcomes, and SMs were collected. The mean follow-up time was 44.8 months (range, 0.5-240 months; median, 28.0 months).  Results:   Altogether, 28 cases with 30 (23.26%) SMs were identified. Twenty (15.50%) patients had prior or synchronous SM. Ten (7.76%) patients developed a subsequent primary cancer after PCNSL. The most common sites of prior or synchronous SMs were prostate (4/20), skin (4/20), and gastrointestinal (3/20). The most common site of the subsequent SM was skin (4/10). Two cases were identified with both prior SM and subsequent SM.  Conclusions:   Second malignancies in cases with PCNSL were not uncommon and occurred in nearly a quarter of our cohort. Nonmelanoma skin cancers were frequently seen. Therefore, screening for SMs should also be considered in long-term follow-up of patients with PCNSL. In addition, the high incidence of subsequent cancer, synchronous cancer, and frequently seen nonmelanoma skin cancers may all indicate an immunosuppressed state in patients with PCNSL.""","""['Jun Wang', 'Jose S Pulido', ""Brian Patrick O'Neill"", 'Patrick B Johnston']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Neuro Oncol""","""['Incidence, clinicopathological features and outcome of primary central nervous system lymphomas.

The treatment of choice, T replacement therapy, has been linked with increased risk for prostate cancer and luteinizing hormone (LH) suppression, and shown to lead to infertility, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity. Alternate methods to induce T with lower side effects are desirable. In search of the mechanisms regulating T synthesis in the testes, we identified the 14-3-3ɛ protein adaptor as a negative regulator of steroidogenesis. Steroidogenesis begins in mitochondria. 14-3-3ɛ interacts with the outer mitochondrial membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) protein, forming a scaffold that limits the availability of cholesterol for steroidogenesis. We report the development of a tool able to induce endogenous T formation. Peptides able to penetrate testes conjugated to 14-3-3ɛ site of interaction with VDAC1 blocked 14-3-3ɛ-VDAC1 interactions while at the same time increased VDAC1-translocator protein (18 kDa) interactions that induced steroid formation in rat testes, leading to increased serum T levels.

Chitosan inhibits invasion of endothelial cells, downregulating uPA/R, MT1-MMP, cdc42 and Rac1. Better healing of bone fractures with greater trabecular bone formation was observed in mice treated with chitosan. Chitosan induces apoptosis in osteotropic prostate and breast cancer cells via caspase-2 and -3 activation, and reduces their establishment in bone. Chitosan is pro-apoptotic in osteosarcoma cells, but not their normal counterpart, osteoblasts, or chondrosarcoma cells.

Methods:   The mRNA and protein expression levels of PTOV1 were analyzed in 12 breast cancer cell lines and eight paired breast cancer tumors by semi-quantitative real time-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess PTOV1 protein expression in 169 paraffin-embedded, archived breast cancer samples. Survival analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to investigate the clinicopathological significance of PTOV1 expression.  Results:   Our data revealed that PTOV1 was frequently overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines compared to normal human breast epithelial cells and in primary breast cancer samples compared to adjacent noncancerous breast tissues, at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, high expression of PTOV1 in breast cancer is strongly associated with clinicopathological characteristics and estrogen receptor expression status (P = 0.003). Breast cancer patients with higher PTOV1 expression had substantially shorter survival times than patients with lower PTOV1 expression (P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that PTOV1 might be an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients (P = 0.005).

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of consecutive patients with mCRPC with a good response to first-line docetaxel [serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decrease ≥50%; no clinical/radiological progression]. We analysed the impact of management at relapse (docetaxel rechallenge or non-taxane-based therapy) on PSA response, symptomatic response (performance status/pain/analgesic consumption), and overall survival (OS). We used multivariate stepwise logistic regression to analyse potential predictors of a favourable outcome.  Results:   We identified 270 good responders to first-line docetaxel. The median progression-free interval (PFI) was 6 months from the last docetaxel dose. At relapse, 223 patients were rechallenged with docetaxel (82.5%) and 47 received non-taxane-based therapy. There was no significant difference in median OS {18.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 16.1-22.00] and 16.8 [95%CI 13.4-21.5] months, respectively, P = 0.35}. However, good PSA response and symptom relief/stable disease were more frequent on docetaxel rechallenge (40.4% vs 10.6%, P < 0.001 for PSA). A PFI of >6 months and added estramustine predicted a good PSA response and symptomatic response on docetaxel rechallenge but only a PFI of >6 months predicted longer OS. Haemoglobin (<13 g/dL) and pain were associated with reduced OS. Docetaxel rechallenge increased the incidence of grade ≥3 sensory neuropathy, nail disorders and asthenia/fatigue.

Most studies have been small or subjected to methodological issues, including potential confounding. We provide here new evidence on this association in the context of a population-based case-control study of prostate cancer conducted in Montreal, Canada.  Methods:   Cases were 1,588 men with incident prostate cancer, aged ≤75 years, diagnosed across French hospitals in the Montreal area between 2005 and 2009. Concurrently, 1,618 population controls from the same residential area and age distribution (±5 years) were randomly selected from the electoral list of French-speaking men. In-person interviews elicited information on socio-demographic, lifestyle and environmental factors, along with a detailed medical history. Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the association between lifetime use of anticoagulants and prostate cancer risk.  Results:   102 subjects (2.6 % of cases and 3.7 % of controls) reported a history of oral anticoagulant therapy. After controlling for age, ancestry, education, family history of prostate cancer, prostate cancer screening frequency, diabetes, body mass index and statin use, ever use of oral anticoagulants showed a weak inverse, non-statistically significant association with prostate cancer (odds ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.50-1.16). Similar results were observed in analyses considering duration of use or indication for use, restricted to subjects recently screened or stratified by cancer aggressiveness.

The development of alternative chemotherapeutic strategies is urgent. Berberine has displayed significant anti-prostate cancer activities. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In the current study, we found that berberine induced apoptosis and programmed necrosis in cultured prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and PC-82 lines), and necrosis weighted more than apoptosis in contributing berberine's cytotoxicity. We demonstrated that mitochondrial protein cyclophilin-D (Cyp-D) is required for berberine-induced programmed necrosis. Inhibition of Cyp-D by its inhibitors cyclosporin A (CSA) or sanglifehrin A (SFA), and by Cyp-D shRNA depletion alleviated berberine-induced prostate cancer cell necrosis (but not apoptosis). Our data found that in prostate cancer cells, berberine induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which dictated P53 translocation to mitochondria, where it physically interacted with Cyp-D to open mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). The anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the P53 inhibitor pifithrin-α (PFTα) as well as P53 siRNA knockdown suppressed berberine-induced P53 mitochondrial translocation and Cyp-D association, thus inhibiting mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) decrease and prostate cancer cell necrosis. In summary, the results of the present study provide mechanistic evidence that both apoptosis and programmed necrosis attribute to berberine's cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Long-yang Zhang', 'Yan-lin Wu', 'Xing-hua Gao', 'Feng Guo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['ROS-p53-cyclophilin-D signaling mediates salinomycin-induced glioma cell necrosis.', 'Cisplatin-induced non-apoptotic death of pancreatic cancer cells requires mitochondrial cyclophilin-D-p53 signaling.', 'P53 dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening is required for dexamethasone-induced death of osteoblasts.', 'Regulation of necrotic cell death: p53, PARP1 and cyclophilin D-overlapping pathways of regulated necrosis?', 'Research progress on the pharmacological effects of berberine targeting mitochondria.', 'Promising Strategy of mPTP Modulation in Cancer Therapy: An Emerging Progress and Future Insight.', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.', 'Cyclophilin D: Guardian or Executioner for Tumor Cells?', 'The sphingosine kinase inhibitor SKI-V suppresses cervical cancer cell growth.', 'GNE-493 inhibits prostate cancer cell growth via Akt-mTOR-dependent and -independent mechanisms.']"""

ADT and salvage prostate cryoablation (SPC) are two commonly considered treatment options for RRPC. However, there is an urgent need for high-quality clinical studies to support evidence-based decisions on treatment choice. Our study aims to determine the feasibility of randomising men with RRPC for treatment with ADT and SPC.  Methods:   The randomised controlled trial (CROP) was developed, which incorporated protocols to assess parameters relating to cryotherapy procedures and provide training workshops for optimising patient recruitment. Analysis of data from the recruitment phase and patient questionnaires was performed.  Results:   Over a period of 18 months, 39 patients were screened for eligibility. Overall 28 patients were offered entry into the trial, but only 7 agreed to randomisation. The majority reason for declining entry into the trial was an unwillingness to be randomised into the study. 'Having the chance of getting cryotherapy' was the major reason for accepting the trial. Despite difficulty in retrieving cryotherapy temperature parameters from prior cases, 9 of 11 cryotherapy centres progressed through the Cryotherapists Qualification Process (CQP) and were approved for recruiting into the CROP study.  Conclusions:   Conveying equipoise between the two study arms for a salvage therapy was challenging. The use of delayed androgen therapy may have been seen as an inferior option.

This definitive treatment is often delayed after initial diagnosis. Our objective was to develop a prediction tool based on a patient's clinical history to determine likelihood of ultimately receiving a penile prosthesis.  Research design and methods:   This retrospective analysis used claims data from Commercial and Medicare supplemental databases. Inclusion criteria were 18 years of age with 1 year of continuous enrollment at the first diagnosis of erectile dysfunction. Patients' demographics, co-morbidities and erectile dysfunction therapy were derived based on enrollment, medical and prescription histories.  Main outcome measures:   The Cox proportional hazards model with stepwise selection was used to identify and quantify (using relative risk) factors associated with a future penile prosthesis implant. Co-morbidities and therapies present prior to the index erectile dysfunction diagnosis were analyzed as fixed covariates.  Results:   Approximately 1% of the dataset's population (N = 310,303 Commercial, N = 74,315 Medicare, respectively) underwent penile prosthesis implantation during the study period (3928 patients in the overall population: 2405 patients [0.78%] in the Commercial and 1523 patients [2.05%] in the Medicare population). Factors with the greatest predictive strength of penile prosthesis implantation included prostate cancer diagnosis (relative risk: 3.93, 2.29; 95% CI, 3.57-4.34, 2.03-2.6), diabetes mellitus (2.31, 1.23; 2.12-2.52, 1.1-1.37) and previous treatment with first-line therapy (1.39, 1.33; 1.28-1.5, 1.2-1.47) (all P < 0.01).  Conclusion:   The presence and extent of specific medical history factors at the time of erectile dysfunction diagnosis predict an individual's future likelihood of penile prosthesis. Calculating the likelihood of penile prosthesis implantation based on the weight of these factors may assist clinicians with the definition of a care plan and patient counseling. The precision of the model may be limited by factors beyond medical history information that possibly influence the decision to proceed to surgery.""","""['Robert L Segal', 'Stephen B Camper', 'Larry Ma', 'Arthur L Burnett']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Curr Med Res Opin""","""['Re: Prediction model for penile prosthesis implantation for erectile dysfunction management.', 'External validation of a prediction model for penile prosthesis implantation for erectile dysfunction management.', 'Modern utilization of penile prosthesis surgery: a national claim registry analysis.', ""Comparison of Long-Term Results and Couples' Satisfaction with Penile Implant Types and Brands: Lessons Learned From 883 Patients With Erectile Dysfunction Who Underwent Penile Prosthesis Implantation."", 'Penile prosthesis implantation in the era of medical treatment for erectile dysfunction.', 'Contemporary aspects of penile prosthesis implantation.', 'Risk profiling in patients undergoing penile prosthesis implantation.', 'Inflatable penile prosthesis in the radical prostatectomy patient: a review.']"""

Objectives:   This study aimed to determine the temporal pattern of prescribed opioids at a population level.  Methods:   Using Quebec administrative databases, we ascertained details of cancer-related deaths and filled community-based opioid prescriptions (COPs) in 48,420 decedents from 2003 to 2006.  Results:   Using group-based trajectory modeling, based on when people started to fill COPs, our population-based study demonstrated patterns of filled COPs with six distinct trajectories. An earlier start in opioid consumption resulted in a higher group average morphine daily dose; those who were already filling COPs at study entry (5.2%) had a final dose of more than 300mg by the time of death. Remarkably, 58.8% of people had not filled COPs with a biweekly average greater than 1mg earlier than two weeks before death, marking the end of follow-up. Breast cancer in women, prostate or colorectal cancer in men, and younger age and multiple myeloma in both sexes were positively associated with earlier filling of COPs.  Conclusion:   Patients dying of cancer require increasing doses of opioids over time; although we cannot distinguish the relative contributions of disease progression and opioid tolerance, age and certain cancers seem related to this phenomenon. Given the potentially prohibitive cost of prospective epidemiological studies, more elaborate clinical administrative databases that include regular pain assessment are necessary to determine optimal opioid use and factors associated with dose increases over time at a population level.""","""['Bruno Gagnon', 'Susan Scott', 'Lyne Nadeau', 'Peter G Lawlor']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Pain Symptom Manage""","""['Opioid prescription for terminally ill outpatients in a district of northern Italy: a retrospective survey.', 'Opioids and the management of chronic severe pain in the elderly: consensus statement of an International Expert Panel with focus on the six clinically most often used World Health Organization Step III opioids (buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone).', 'Prescribing of pain medication in palliative care.

Many traditional applications or phytotherapeutic concepts propose to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. In order to detect influences of plant or fungal extracts and derived fractions on androgen receptor signaling pathways, a differentiating cell proliferation assay was established, which enables the simultaneous detection of hormonal and cytotoxic effects.  Material and methods:   The well characterized prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 were used in a multiple readout assay. In all, 186 fractions of 23 traditionally used organisms were screened regarding their effects on proliferation of the two prostate cancer cell lines. The fractions were prepared by accelerated solvent extraction followed by gradient extrography. Extracts of the potential hormonally active plants Cibotium barometz, Heteropterys chrysophylla, and Sideroxylon obtusifolium (= Bumelia sartorum) were phytochemically investigated.  Results:   Fractions from Cibotium barometz, Cortinarius rubellus, Cyrtomium falcatum, Heteropterys chrysophylla, Nephrolepis exaltata, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Sideroxylon obtusifolium, Trichilia emetica, and Trimeria grandifolia exhibited hormonal influences on prostate cancer cells. Cytotoxic activity towards human cell lines was detected for the first time for fractions from Aglaia spectabilis (A. gigantea), Nephrolepis exaltata and Cortinarius brunneus.  Conclusions:   The differential behavior of the two prostate cancer cell lines allows the discrimination between potential androgenic or antiandrogenic activities and effects on the estrogen or glucocorticoid receptor as well as cytotoxic activities.

Methods:   A phase 2 feasibility study was conducted with cancer patients (lung, breast, colorectal, prostate) and their family caregivers (N = 38 dyads). The Web-based intervention provided information and support tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient, caregiver, and their dyadic relationship. Primary outcomes were emotional distress and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were benefits of illness/caregiving, communication, support, and self-efficacy. Analyses included descriptive statistics and repeated-measures analysis of variance.  Results:   Dyads had a significant decrease in emotional distress, increase in quality of life, and perceived more benefits of illness/caregiving. Caregivers also had significant improvement in self-efficacy. There were no changes in communication. Participants were satisfied with program usability, but recommended additional content.  Conclusions:   It was possible to translate a clinician-delivered program to a Web-based format that was easy to use and had positive effects on dyadic outcomes.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling is important in the maintenance of non-transformed cells in the quiescent or slowly cycling stage. However, both non-transformed proliferating cells and human cancer cells are non-responsive to endogenous TGFβ signaling. The mechanism by which proliferating cells become refractory to TGFβ inhibition is not well established. Here, we found that silencing p44/WDR77 increased cellular sensitivity to TGFβ signaling and that this was inversely correlated with decreased cell proliferation. Smad2 or 3 phosphorylation, TGFβ-mediated transcription, and TGFβ2 and TGFβ receptor type II (TβRII) expression were dramatically induced by silencing of p44/WDR77. These data support the hypothesis that p44/WDR77 down-regulates the expression of the TGFβ ligand and its receptor, thereby leading to a cellular non-response to TGFβ signaling. Finally, we found that p44/WDR77 expression was correlated with cell proliferation and decreased TGFβ signaling during lung tumorigenesis. Together, these results suggest that p44/WDR77 expression causes the non-sensitivity of proliferating cells to TGFβ signaling, thereby contributing to cellular proliferation during lung tumorigenesis.""","""['Pengfei Yi', 'Shen Gao', 'Zhongping Gu', 'Tao Huang', 'Zhengxin Wang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 regulates multiple signaling pathways to promote lung cancer cell proliferation.', 'The p44/wdr77-dependent cellular proliferation process during lung development is reactivated in lung cancer.', 'De-ubiquitinating enzyme, USP11, promotes transforming growth factor β-1 signaling through stabilization of transforming growth factor β receptor II.', 'Oxidative stress is responsible for maternal diabetes-impaired transforming growth factor beta signaling in the developing mouse heart.', 'Chondrodysplasias and TGFβ signaling.', 'Expression, Localization and Prognosis Association of MEP50 in Breast Cancer.', 'The essential role of WD repeat domain 77 in prostate tumor initiation induced by Pten loss.', 'The PRMT5/WDR77 complex regulates alternative splicing through ZNF326 in breast cancer.', 'Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 regulates multiple signaling pathways to promote lung cancer cell proliferation.', 'Yeast two-hybrid screening identified WDR77 as a novel interacting partner of TSC22D2.']"""

Use of metformin was found to be associated with the lower risk of cancer. It is suggested that metformin has an anticancer and antiproliferative effect and affects the apoptosis by activating the AMPK and inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Although the effects of metformin treatment of various types of cancers are defined with many mechanisms, the literature provides only sufficient information about how it affects the SGK-1, Par-4 and Cav-1 mRNA expressions and the impact of this effect on cytotoxicity. The breast cancer is globally one of the most important causes of cancer-related mortality for women. We, therefore investigated the possible effects of metmorfin on proliferation, cytotoxicity and some unfolded protein response (UPR) genes in the breast cancer cells (MCF-7).  Materials and methods:   We administrated 0.31 mM, 2.5 mM and 10 mM of metformin alone and in combination with 2-DG to the MCF-7 cells and monitored the cell viability and proliferation with real-time cell analyzer system for 48 hours. We also measured CHOP, Cav-1, HO-1, SGK-1 and Par-4 genes mRNA expression levels using Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). We considered the GAPDH gene as reference gene and the control groups as calibrator. We performed an analysis for relative gene expressions of the study groups.  Results:   Metformin caused transcriptional regulation of UPR and tumor-related genes in MCF-7 cells and inhibited the proliferation depending on the dose, resulting in cytotoxic effect.  Conclusions:   We consider that administration of metformin with chemotherapeutic agents could be an effective method in treatment of breast cancer through mechanisms such as reduced resistance to chemotherapy and increased cytotoxic activity.""","""['O Salis', 'A Bedir', 'T Ozdemir', 'A Okuyucu', 'H Alacam']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['Cytotoxic effect of fluvastatin on MCF-7 cells possibly through a reduction of the mRNA expression levels of SGK1 and CAV1.', 'Metformin and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) sensitize breast cancer cells to the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro.', 'Proapoptotic effects of heme oxygenase-1 inhibitor on Kasumi-1 cells via the ATF4/CHOP/Ire-1α pathway.', 'Anticancer effects of metformin and its potential use as a therapeutic agent for breast cancer.', 'Metformin: The Answer to Cancer in a Flower?

Following radical prostatectomy, the cancer extent was delineated by a pathologist on ex vivo histology and mapped to MRI by nonlinear registration of histology and corresponding MRI slices. In all, 244 computer-extracted features were extracted from MRI, and principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce the data dimensionality so that a generalizable classifier could be constructed. A novel variable importance on projection (VIP) measure for PCA (PCA-VIP) was leveraged to identify computer-extracted MRI features that discriminate between cancer and normal prostate, and these features were used to construct classifiers for cancer localization.

Such distinctions initially arose from work identifying rare, highly penetrant germline mutations causing 'hereditary' cancer. While rare mutations are important in particular families, most cases in the general population are 'sporadic'. Twin studies have suggested that many 'sporadic' cancers show little or no heritability. To quantify the role of germline mutations in cancer susceptibility, we applied a method for estimating the importance of common genetic variants (array heritability, h(2)g) to twelve cancer types. The following cancers showed a significant (P < 0.05) array heritability: melanoma USA set h(2)g = 0.19 (95% CI = 0.01-0.37) and Australian set h(2)g = 0.30 (0.10-0.50); pancreatic h(2)g = 0.18 (0.06-0.30); prostate h(2)g = 0.81 (0.32-1); kidney h(2)g = 0.18 (0.04-0.32); ovarian h(2)g = 0.30 (0.18-0.42); esophageal adenocarcinoma h(2)g = 0.24 (0.14-0.34); esophageal squamous cell carcinoma h(2)g = 0.19 (0.07-0.31); endometrial UK set h(2)g = 0.23 (0.01-0.45) and Australian set h(2)g = 0.39 (0.02-0.76).

One cancer showed a small effect: bladder h(2)g = 0.01 (0-0.11). Among these cancers, previous twin studies were only able to show heritability for prostate and breast cancer, but we can now make much stronger statements for several common cancers which emphasize the important role of genetic variants in cancer susceptibility.

Here we found that H(2)S inhibits cell proliferation of both androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer cells (LNCaP-B), with more significance on the latter, which was established by long term treatment of parental LNCaP cells with bicalutamide. The expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), a major H(2)S producing enzyme in prostate tissue, was reduced in both human prostate cancer tissues and LNCaP-B cells. LNCaP-B cells were resistant to bicalutamide-induced cell growth inhibition, and CSE overexpression could rebuild the sensitivity of LNCaP-B cells to bicalutamide. H(2)S significantly repressed the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and TMPRSS2, two AR-targeted genes. In addition, H(2)S inhibited AR binding with PSA promoter and androgen-responsive element (ARE) luciferase activity. We further found that AR is post-translationally modified by H(2)S through S-sulfhydration. Mutation of cysteine 611 and cysteine 614 in the second zinc finger module of AR-DNA binding domain diminished the effects of H(2)S on AR S-sulfhydration and AR dimerization.

Materials and methods:   Since January 2011 the cantonal hospitals of Lucerne and St. Gallen (Switzerland) have shared a four-arm Da Vinci® device, transferring the surgical know-how by a Lucerne teaching surgeon to a St. Gallen surgeon. Complete pre- and perioperative data, including 3-month surgical RARP outcomes, were prospectively documented. For statistical analysis, Wilcoxon, exact Poisson and χ(2) tests were used.  Results:   During the first year, the two hospitals (61 RARP patients in Lucerne, 19 RARP patients in St. Gallen) did not differ significantly in preoperative, perioperative or oncological and functional results except for prostate volume (median 33 [interquartile range 24-40] vs. 40 [interquartile range 33-57] ml; p = 0.02), operation time (mean 252 ± 49 vs. 351 ± 50 min; p = 0.0001), number of lymph nodes removed (median 16 [interquartile range 13-21] vs. 15 [interquartile range 8-16] nodes; p = 0.02), biopsy (p = 0.04) and specimen Gleason scores (p = 0.03), and length of hospital stay (median 8 [interquartile range 7-14] vs. 9 [interquartile range 8-18] days; p < 0.01).

The IT consisted of a pan CD44 mAb (clone IM7) bound to the ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) saporin by a biotin-streptavidin linker named IM7-saporin. PCI is based upon photosensitizing compounds localized in the membrane of endosomes and lysosomes causing membrane rupture upon illumination followed by release of the IT into the cytosol. In this in vitro study, we have used 7 different human cancer cell lines of various origins to investigate the cytotoxic effect of PCI-based targeting of the cancer stem cell (CSC) marker CD44. Epi-fluorescence microscopy shows both specific binding and uptake of the IM7-Alexa488, after 30 min and 18 h of incubation, and colocalization with the PCI-photosensitizer TPCS2a prior to light-triggered cytosolic release of the CD44-targeting IT. PCI of IM7-saporin resulted in efficient and specific cytotoxicity in CD44-expressing but not in CD44-negative cancer cells. A higher level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found in untreated and photodynamic therapy (PDT)-treated LNCaP (CD44(neg)) compared to that of DU145 (CD44(pos)) prostate cancer (PC) cells. This may explain the PDT-resistance observed in the DU145 cells.

The purpose of the present study was to assess long-term functional and structural anorectal changes in patients previously treated with EBRT for prostate cancer and to suggest the mechanism behind the development of the adverse effects.  Material and methods:   Our previously proposed RT-induced anorectal dysfunction (RT-ARD) score, developed with the intention to survey anorectal dysfunction was used to identify patients with and without anorectal symptoms. Among 309 patients surveyed with the questionnaire, we chose 23 patients with the highest RT-ARD score and 19 patients with the lowest RT-ARD score. They were investigated by multimodal rectal sensory stimulation, standard anal physiological tests. Changes of the rectal mucosa were assessed by flexible sigmoidoscopy and graded by the Vienna Rectoscopy Score (VRS).  Results:   The mean follow-up time was 3.8 (range, 2.8; 8.6) years in patients with high RT-ARD and 3.8 (range, 2.6; 5.9) in patients with low RT-ARD. Endoscopic evaluation revealed higher VRS scores in patients with high RT-ARD compared to patients with low RT-ARD (p = 0.002). Patients with high RT-ARD had increased rectal sensory response to distension manifested both as volume (p = 0.006) and cross-sectional area (p = 0.04), and they had reduced maximum anal resting pressure assessed by anal manometri (p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Long-term anorectal symptoms correlate to changes in anorectal biomechanical properties and rectal mucosal injury.

In some types of cancer, including prostate cancer, the expression of VGSCs is associated with cancer migration, invasion and metastasis in vivo. However, the detailed expression profiles of VGSC α subunits in normal human prostate, in prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic cancer remain controversial. In the present study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to systematically detect all subtypes of VGSC α subunits in normal human prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer cells. The expression profile of VGSC α subunits was observed to differ between these cell types. Nav1.5 was the major isoform expressed in normal human prostate tissue, while Nav1.5 and Nav1.2 were the predominant isoforms in BPH tissue. However, in PC-3 and LNCaP cells, two typical prostate cancer cell lines, Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 were abundantly expressed. By comparing the relative expression levels of Nav1.5, Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 in these cells, the mRNA levels of Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 were identified to be 6- to 27-fold higher in PC-3 and LNCaP cells than in either normal or BPH samples (P<0.05); however, Nav1.5 mRNA levels were relatively lower compared with those of Nav1.6 or Nav1.7 in all cells analyzed.

We found that murine androgen deprivation in vivo elicited RNA expression patterns conducive to IFN signaling and T-cell differentiation. Interrogation of mechanism showed that testosterone regulates T-helper 1 (Th1) differentiation by inhibiting IL-12-induced Stat4 phosphorylation: in murine models, we determined that androgen receptor binds a conserved region within the phosphatase, Ptpn1, and consequent up-regulation of Ptpn1 then inhibits IL-12 signaling in CD4 T cells. The clinical relevance of this mechanism, whereby the androgen milieu modulates CD4 T-cell differentiation, was ascertained as we found that androgen deprivation reduced expression of Ptpn1 in CD4 cells from patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   Twenty-six patients with biopsy-proven predominantly unilateral prostate cancer consented to a university ethics-approved Phase 2 study of selective dose escalation. Combined information from endorectal T2 MRI sequences, dynamic contrast enhancement, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps was used to contour the DIL and prostate. Images were fused to intraoperative transrectal ultrasound for transposition of the DIL. Treatment consisted of two fractions of 10 Gy HDR brachytherapy to the entire prostate with 12.5 Gy to the DIL, combined with 46 Gy in 23 fractions of external beam radiotherapy.  Results:   All patients had intermediate- or high-risk disease; 25 of 26 had a visible DIL (mean volume, 2.9 cm(3); SD, 1.8). Mean percentage of prostate receiving prescription dose (V100) was 98.1% (SD, 1.2). Mean dose to 90% of the DIL was 13.4 Gy (SD, 1.0). The coverage of the DIL was excellent with a mean of 95.7% (SD, 5.0) receiving the planned escalation of 25%. Established dose constraints to rectum and urethra were respected in all cases; where DIL coverage was limited by proximity to urethra or rectum, a mean dose to 90% of the DIL of 12.3 Gy was achieved.

We hypothesized that larger tumors within smaller prostate glands are associated with more aggressive disease characteristics.  Methods:   Records of patients undergoing RP from 2000-2008 at a single institution were reviewed retrospectively. The dominant nodule was considered to be the largest focus of cancer within the prostate, and the dominant nodule-to-prostate volume ratio (DNVR) was calculated according to the ratio of the dominant nodule volume to the gland weight. Cox regression was performed to assess the relationship between DNVR and both pathologic outcomes (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment post-Surgical score) and biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   At a median follow-up of 3.7 years, 174 patients (7.2%) suffered BCR. There was no linear correlation between tumor volume and gland size (R = -0.09). DNVR above the median (≥0.033 cc/gm) was closely associated with high clinicopathologic risk as measured by Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment post-Surgical score (hazard ratio, 35.53; 95% confidence interval, 14.42-87.55 for high- vs low-risk groups). In the univariable analysis, both tumor diameter and DNVR were associated with increased risk of BCR. However, in the multivariable model, only tumor diameter remained a significant predictor of BCR (hazard ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.91).  Conclusion:   Increased DNVR appears to be a characteristic of aggressive prostate tumors, although it did not predict BCR in the present study.

Patients and methods:   A retrospective cohort study with a weighted sample size of 489,369 men who underwent non-RARP (i.e., open or laparoscopic RP) or RARP in the USA from 2003 to 2010 was performed. We evaluated predictors for RARP adoption, defined as performing >50% of annual RP using the robotic approach. Additionally, we identified the resulting changes in prostate cancer surgery practice patterns and expenditures.  Results:   From 2003 to 2010, RARP adoption increased from 0.7% to 42% of surgeons performing RP. High-volume surgeons, defined as performing >24 RPs annually, had statically significantly higher odds of adopting RARP throughout the study period. From 2005 to 2007, adoption was more common among surgeons at teaching (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-3.4), intermediate- (200-399 beds; OR 5.96, 95% CI 1.3-26.5) and large-sized hospitals (≥ 400 beds; OR 6.1, 95% CI 1.4-25.8); after 2007, adoption was more common among surgeons at urban hospitals (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.7-6.4). RARP adoption was generally associated with increased RP volume, greatest for high-volume surgeons and least for low-volume surgeons (<5 RPs annually). The annual number of surgeons performing RP decreased from about 10,000 to 8200, with the proportion of cases performed by high-volume surgeons increasing from 10% to 45%. RARP was more costly, disproportionally contributing to the 40% increase in annual prostate cancer surgery expenditures. RARP costs generally decreased plateauing at slightly over $10,000, while non-RARP costs increased to nearly $9000 by the end of the study.

Material and methods:   Initially accumulated bladder and prostate doses were assessed (based on 8-9 repeat CT scans/patient) for nine prostate cancer patients using an intensity-based DIR and dose accumulation algorithm as provided by the Dynamic Adaptive Radiation Therapy (DART) software. The accumulated bladder and prostate dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were compared on a range of parameters (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, 5% significance level) to DVHs derived using an in-house developed dose accumulation method based on biomechanical, contour-driven DIR (SurfaceRegistration). Finally, both these accumulated dose distributions were compared to the 'static' DVH, assessed from the planning CT.  Results:   Over the population, doses accumulated with DART were overall lower than those from SurfaceRegistration (p < 0.05: D2%, gEUD and NTCP (bladder); Dmin (prostate)). The magnitude of these differences peaked for the bladder gEUD with a population median of 47 Gy for DART versus 57 Gy for SurfaceRegistration. Across the ten bladder dose/volume parameters investigated, the most pronounced individual differences were observed between the 'accumulated' DVHs and the 'static' DVHs, with deviations in mean dose up to 22 Gy.  Conclusion:   Substantial and significant differences were observed in the dose distributions between the two investigated DIR-based dose accumulation applications. The most pronounced individual differences were seen for the bladder and relative to the planned dose distribution, encouraging the use of repeat imaging data in RT planning and evaluation for this organ.""","""['Maria Thor', 'Else S Andersen', 'Jørgen B B Petersen', 'Thomas S Sørensen', 'Karsten Ø Noe', 'Kari Tanderup', 'Lise Bentzen', 'Ulrik V Elstrøm', 'Morten Høyer', 'Ludvig P Muren']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Bladder dose accumulation based on a biomechanical deformable image registration algorithm in volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'Propagation of target and organ at risk contours in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using deformable image registration.', 'Deformable image registration for radiation therapy: principle, methods, applications and evaluation.', 'Introducing new technologies into the clinic.', 'Automatic landmark correspondence detection in medical images with an application to deformable image registration.', 'MIRSIG position paper: the use of image registration and fusion algorithms in radiotherapy.', 'Estimating the accumulative dose uncertainty for intracavitary and interstitial brachytherapy.', 'A case-control study using motion-inclusive spatial dose-volume metrics to account for genito-urinary toxicity following high-precision radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Accurate estimation of daily delivered radiotherapy dose with an external treatment planning system.']"""

This analysis examined the effect of sipuleucel-T on time to disease-related pain (TDRP) and time to first use of opioid analgesics (TFOA) in mCRPC using data pooled from three randomized phase III studies in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC (D9901 (NCT00005947), D9902A (NCT01133704), D9902B (IMPACT; NCT00065442)).  Methods:   Four-hundred and twenty-eight asymptomatic patients were analyzed for TDRP; 737 patients were analyzed for TFOA. Pain status was collected using logs adjudicated by blinded, independent reviewers. Opioid use for cancer-related pain was identified from medically reviewed reports of concomitant medication. Disease-related pain was defined as pain post enrollment. TDRP and TFOA were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.

The diagnostics always include a control of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and examination of a representative tissue sample from the prostate. With these findings it is possible to evaluate the degree of progression of the cancer and its prognosis. Several treatment options for localized prostate cancer are given by national and international guidelines including radical prostatectomy, percutaneous radiation therapy, or brachytherapy and surveillance of the cancer with optional treatment at a later stage. For the latter treatment option, known as active surveillance, strict criteria have to be met. The advantage of active surveillance is that only patients with progressive cancer are subjected to radical therapy. Patients with very slow or non-progressing cancer do not have to undergo therapy and thus do not have to suffer from the side effects. The basic idea behind active surveillance is that some cancers will not progress to a stage that requires treatment within the lifetime of the patient and therefore do not require treatment at all. Unfortunately the criteria for active surveillance are not definitive enough at the current time leading only to a delay in effective treatment for many patients. The surveillance strategy has without doubt a high significance among the treatment options for prostate cancer; however, at the current time it lacks reliable indicators for a certain prognosis.

Whereas the precise nature of this niche remains to be established, it is likely to contain bone cell populations including osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In the mouse tibia, the distribution of osteoblasts on endocortical bone surfaces is non-uniform, and we hypothesize that studying co-localization of individual tumor cells with resident cell populations will reveal the identity of critical cellular components of the niche. In this study, we have mapped the distribution of three human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3-NW1, LN-CaP, and C4 2B4) colonizing the tibiae of athymic mice following intracardiac injection and evaluated their interaction with potential metastatic niches. Prostate cancer cells labeled with the fluorescent cell membrane dye (Vybrant DiD) were found by two-photon microscopy to be engrafted in the tibiae in close proximity (∼40 µm) to bone surfaces and 70% more cancer cells were detected in the lateral compared to the medial endocortical bone regions. This was associated with a 5-fold higher number of osteoblasts and 7-fold higher bone formation rate on the lateral endocortical bone surface compared to the medial side. By disrupting cellular interactions mediated by the chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)/chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) axis with the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100, the preferential homing pattern of prostate cancer cells to osteoblast-rich bone surfaces was disrupted. In this study, we map the location of prostate cancer cells that home to endocortical regions in bone and our data demonstrate that homing of prostate cancer cells is associated with the presence and activity of osteoblast lineage cells, and suggest that therapies targeting osteoblast niches should be considered to prevent development of incurable prostate cancer bone metastases.""","""['Ning Wang', 'Freyja E Docherty', 'Hannah K Brown', 'Kimberley J Reeves', 'Anne C M Fowles', 'Penelope D Ottewell', 'T Neil Dear', 'Ingunn Holen', 'Peter I Croucher', 'Colby L Eaton']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Bone Miner Res""","""['Modifying the osteoblastic niche with zoledronic acid in vivo-potential implications for breast cancer bone metastasis.', 'Abrogation of prostaglandin E-EP4 signaling in osteoblasts prevents the bone destruction induced by human prostate cancer metastases.', 'Pharmacological targeting of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Pathogenesis of osteoblastic bone metastases from prostate cancer.', 'The CXCR4/SDF-1 chemokine axis: a potential therapeutic target for bone metastases?', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Cytokines in the Metastasis of Solid Tumors to the Spine: Systematic Review.', 'Beta tricalcium phosphate, either alone or in combination with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy or doxycycline, prevents medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.', 'Direct bone marrow injection of human bone marrow-derived stromal cells into mouse femurs results in greater prostate cancer PC-3 cell proliferation, but not specifically proliferation within the injected femurs.', 'PSMA-guided metastases directed therapy for bone castration sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer: a multi-institutional study.']"""

Both uPAR flow cytometry and ELISA confirmed high expression levels of the target uPAR in PC-3M-LUC2.luc cells, and cell binding studies using (177)Lu-DOTA-AE105 resulted in a specific binding with an IC50 value of 100 nM in a competitive binding experiment. In vivo, uPAR targeted radionuclide therapy significantly reduced the number of metastatic lesions in the disseminated metastatic prostate cancer model, when compared to vehicle and nontargeted (177)Lu groups (p < 0.05) using bioluminescence imaging. Moreover, we found a significantly longer metastatic-free survival, with 65% of all mice without any disseminated metastatic lesions present at 65 days after first treatment dose (p = 0.047). In contrast, only 30% of all mice in the combined control groups treated with (177)Lu-DOTA-AE105mut or vehicle were without metastatic lesions. No treatment-induced toxicity was observed during the study as evaluated by observing animal weight and H&E staining of kidney tissue (dose-limiting organ). Finally, uPAR PET imaging using (64)Cu-DOTA-AE105 detected all small, disseminated metastatic foci when compared with bioluminescence imaging in a cohort of animals during the treatment study. In conclusion, uPAR targeted radiotherapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of metastatic lesions in a human metastatic prostate cancer model. Furthermore, we have provided the first evidence of the potential for identification of small metastatic lesions using uPAR PET imaging in disseminated prostate cancer, illustrating the promising strategy of uPAR theranostics in prostate cancer.""","""['Morten Persson', 'Karina Juhl', 'Palle Rasmussen', 'Malene Brandt-Larsen', 'Jacob Madsen', 'Michael Ploug', 'Andreas Kjaer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['New peptide receptor radionuclide therapy of invasive cancer cells: in vivo studies using 177Lu-DOTA-AE105 targeting uPAR in human colorectal cancer xenografts.', 'Quantitative PET of human urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor with 64Cu-DOTA-AE105: implications for visualizing cancer invasion.', 'First (18)F-labeled ligand for PET imaging of uPAR: in vivo studies in human prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Imaging of Prostate Cancer Using Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator Receptor PET.', '177Lu-Labeled DOTA-conjugated AE105 peptide (Asp-Cha-Phe-(d)Ser-(d)Arg-Tyr-Leu-Trp-Ser-CONH2).', 'Prospective Phase II Trial of Prognostication by 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 uPAR PET in Patients with Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Implications for uPAR-Targeted Therapy.', 'The Urokinase Receptor (uPAR) as a ""Trojan Horse"" in Targeted Cancer Therapy: Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Targeting the Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator Receptor (uPAR) in Human Diseases With a View to Non-invasive Imaging and Therapeutic Intervention.', 'The use of a uPAR-targeted probe for photothermal cancer therapy prolongs survival in a xenograft mouse model of glioblastoma.', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: The Dawn of the Era of Nuclear Medicine?']"""

Increased expression of membrane-bound galectin-3 by prostate carcinoma cell has been found to correlate with more poorly differentiated and increased metastatic potential. In the present study, different amount of galectin-3-binding peptide, G3-C12 (the sequence ANTPCGPYTHDCPVKR), was attached to N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers as targeting moiety. The results of qPCR and competitive binding test indicated that the expression level of galectin-3 in two metastatic prostate carcinoma cell lines (PC-3 and DU145 cells) could be significantly suppressed by the addition of G3-C12-modified HPMA copolymers (PG1 and PG2), demonstrating the high affinity of PG1 and PG2 to galectin-3. Due to the multivalent effects of moieties, the uptake of copolymers was remarkably enhanced with the increasing amount of conjugated G3-C12 peptide. A higher internalization of PG1 and PG2 occurred in PC-3 cells via caveolin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, whereas a clathrin-mediated uptake process was involved in DU145 cells. The in vivo biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of nonmodified ((131)I-pHPMA) and G3-C12-modified ((131)I-PG1 and (131)I-PG2) copolymers were estimated on a well-established mice model bearing PC-3 xenografts by (131)I-SPECT-imaging. Higher tumor accumulation of (131)I-PG1 (1.60 ± 0.08% ID/g, p < 0.05) and (131)I-PG2 (1.54 ± 0.06% ID/g, p < 0.05) was observed compared with (131)I-pHPMA (1.19 ± 0.04% ID/g) at 2 h post-intravenous injection. Although the amount of conjugated G3-C12 peptide performed a remarkable in vitro effect on the affinity and internalization of HPMA copolymers to the galectin-3 overexpressed prostate carcinoma cells, the molecular weight and ligand modification all play important roles on their in vivo tumor accumulation.""","""['Yang Yang', 'Lian Li', 'Zhou Zhou', 'Qingqing Yang', 'Chong Liu', 'Yuan Huang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Two birds, one stone: dual targeting of the cancer cell surface and subcellular mitochondria by the galectin-3-binding peptide G3-C12.', 'Treatment of prostate carcinoma with (galectin-3)-targeted HPMA copolymer-(G3-C12)-5-Fluorouracil conjugates.', 'G3-C12 Peptide Reverses Galectin-3 from Foe to Friend for Active Targeting Cancer Treatment.', 'HPMA copolymer-cyclic RGD conjugates for tumor targeting.', 'Molecular imaging of HPMA copolymers: visualizing drug delivery in cell, mouse and man.', 'Targeting galectin-driven regulatory circuits in cancer and fibrosis.', 'Unraveling How Tumor-Derived Galectins Contribute to Anti-Cancer Immunity Failure.', 'Targeting Galectins With Glycomimetics.', 'Galectin Targeted Therapy in Oncology: Current Knowledge and Perspectives.', 'Two birds, one stone: dual targeting of the cancer cell surface and subcellular mitochondria by the galectin-3-binding peptide G3-C12.']"""

A previous report on cancer incidence in a farm worker labor union between 1987 and 1997 found increased leukemia, brain, stomach, and uterine cervix cancer rates in this working population.  Methods:   A roster of farm workers was created and electronically linked to the database of the California Cancer Registry. Proportionate cancer incidence (PCIR), stage, and age at diagnosis and histological subtypes of cancer were compared between the United Farm Workers (UFW) members and the Hispanic population of California as well as to the non-Hispanic whites (NHW).  Results:   In this population of 139,000 farm workers in California, more than 3,600 cancer diagnoses were recorded between 1988 and 2010. Proportionately more cancer was noted in the UFW than among California NHW for kidney and renal pelvis cancer (PCIR = 1.60), liver (PCIR = 4.24), prostate (PCIR = 1.13), and uterine cervix cancer (PCIR = 2.08). Proportionately less breast (PCIR = 0.85), lung (PCIR = 0.75), skin melanoma (PCIR = 0.18), and urinary bladder cancer (PCIR = 0.59) was found. Stage at diagnosis was more advanced in the farm workers for several cancer sites, although, not for colorectal cancer.  Conclusions:   These farm workers experience proportionally more prostate, kidney and renal pelvis, brain, liver, stomach, cervix and leukemia and less breast, melanoma, and colorectal cancer than reference populations.

In this study we investigated the functional role of different modes of cell death that mediate anticancer effect of lupulone derivatives in prostate cancer cells. ELISA, immunoblotting and siRNA approaches were utilised to study cell death, expression of proteins of interest and their functional activities. We found that the anticancer effect of lupulone derivatives on prostate cancer cells is associated with induction of apoptosis and autophagy as determined by increases of DNA fragmentation and LC3I/ LC3II conversion respectively. Inhibition of apoptosis using a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in increased levels of autophagy. Following screening of proteins associated with autophagy we found that Atg4β expression was increased in prostate cancer cells after treatment with lupulone. Transfection of cells with siRNA against Atg4β resulted in increased levels of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with lupulone derivatives initiated two modes of cell death: apoptosis as a killing pathway and autophagy as a protection against cell death.

The impact of obesity on progression is not well characterized in this population.  Objective:   To determine if obesity is associated with progression in men on AS for low-risk PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men undergoing AS for low-risk PCa (no Gleason pattern ≥4, three or fewer cores involved or one-third or less of the total number of cores involved, and no core with >50% cancer involvement) were identified at our institution.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcomes were pathologic progression (defined as no longer meeting low-risk criteria on follow-up biopsy) and therapeutic progression (defined as intent to initiate active treatment). Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used, with separate models for reclassification at confirmatory biopsy (first biopsy after diagnostic biopsy) and progression beyond confirmatory biopsy.  Results and limitations:   In this cohort of 565 men (median follow-up: 48 mo), 124 (22%) were obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥30kg/m(2)). Pathologic and therapeutic progression occurred in 168 men (30%) and 172 men (30%), respectively. No association was noted between obesity and risk of progression at the confirmatory biopsy. However, beyond confirmatory biopsy, obesity was associated with a greater probability of pathologic progression (p=0.007) and therapeutic progression (p=0.007) in Kaplan-Meier analyses. In adjusted Cox models, each 5-unit increase in BMI was associated with an increased risk of pathologic progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.1; p=0.02) and therapeutic progression (HR: 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9; p=0.05). The main limitation is the retrospective design, limiting the ability to assess BMI changes over time.  Conclusions:   Obesity was associated with a significantly increased risk of progression beyond the confirmatory biopsy. This suggests an increased risk of long-term biologic progression rather than solely misclassification.  Patient summary:   As opposed to immediate active treatment (surgery or radiation), active surveillance (AS) involves closely monitoring low-risk prostate cancers and only using active treatment if there are signs of progression. Our study is the first to suggest that obesity is associated with a higher risk of cancer progression while on AS.

Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of degarelix as IAD for one or more treatment cycle(s) in prostate cancer patients requiring androgen deprivation.  Design, setting, and participants:   This open-label uncontrolled multicenter study included patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >4 to 50 ng/ml or PSA doubling time <24 mo. Induction included 7-mo treatment. Off-treatment period started when PSA was ≤4 ng/ml and lasted up to 24 mo based on PSA and testosterone levels. Treatment was reinitiated when PSA was >4 ng/ml.  Intervention:   Each induction period included a starting dose of degarelix 240mg, and thereafter 80mg once a month for 6 mo, followed by off-treatment periods.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was time to PSA >4 ng/ml. Secondary end points were subgroup analysis of the primary end point, time to testosterone >0.5 and >2.2 ng/ml, quality of life (QoL), and sexual function during the first off-treatment period.  Results and limitations:   Of 213 patients in the first induction period, 191 entered the first off-treatment period, 35 patients entered the second induction, and 30 entered the second off-treatment period. Only two patients entered the third cycle. Median time to PSA >4 ng/ml and duration of first off-treatment period was 392 d each. Significant differences in time to PSA >4 ng/ml were observed between subgroups stratified by prognostic factors (previous curative treatment, cancer stage, PSA levels, and Gleason scores). Time to testosterone >0.5 and >2.2 ng/ml was 112 and 168 d, respectively. Change in QoL remained nonsignificant, and sexual function gradually improved during the off-treatment period. Adverse events were fewer during the off-treatment period and subsequent treatment cycles.  Conclusions:   IAD with degarelix resulted in an improvement in sexual function commensurate with increased testosterone levels while PSA remained suppressed.

Design and methods:   Anti-ANXA3 monoclonal antibodies were generated and their epitopes mapped. Two different ANXA3 assay prototypes were established on the VIDAS® automated immunoanalyser and analytical validation was carried out using post-DRE urine samples obtained from patients with PCa (n=23) or benign prostate hyperplasia (n=31).  Results:   The assays had the same capture antibody (TGC44) but different detection antibodies (13A12 or 5C5), recognizing novel distinct epitopes. Both had a lower limit of quantification <1ng/mL and were highly specific for ANXA3, not cross-reacting with other annexins. Interassay imprecision was ≤11% and ≤15% for 13A12 and 5C5 assays, respectively. Surprisingly, a total lack of correlation was observed between ANXA3 levels measured by these two assays in post-DRE urines, indicating detection of distinct antigenic variants. Two freeze-thaw cycles did not affect analyte stability in either assay, whereas a lack of stability of antigenic variants was observed when samples were stored at -80°C for 1month.

We report biochemical control and toxicity after low-dose-rate PSI and compare outcomes according to the prostate size.  Methods and materials:   A total of 429 men who underwent low-dose-rate PSI between 1998 and 2009 were evaluated. Median followup was 38.7 months. Patients were classified by prostate volume into small, medium, and large subgroups. Differences were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney and Pearson's χ(2) tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate effect of prostate size on outcomes.  Results:   Patient pretreatment factors were balanced between groups except for age (p=0.001). The 10-year actuarial freedom from biochemical failure for all patients treated with PSI was 96.3% with no statistically significant difference between large vs. small/medium prostate size (90% vs. 96.6%, p=0.47). In a multivariate analysis, plan type (hazard ratio [HR]=0.25, p=0.03), dose to 90% of the gland (D90: HR=0.98, p=0.02), volume receiving 200Gy (V200: HR=0.98, p=0.026), and biologic effective dose (HR=0.99, p=0.045), but not prostate size (HR=2.27, p=0.17) were significantly associated with freedom from biochemical failure. Prostate size was not significantly associated with time to maximum American Urologic Association score.

In MYC-driven, but not PI3K-driven prostate cancer, we show that interferon-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) is directly repressed by EZH2 in a MYC-dependent manner and is downregulated in a subset of metastatic prostate cancers. EZH2 knockdown restored the expression of IFNGR1 and, when combined with IFN-γ treatment, led to strong activation of IFN-JAK-STAT1 tumor-suppressor signaling and robust apoptosis. Pharmacologic depletion of EZH2 by the histone-methylation inhibitor DZNep mimicked the effects of EZH2 knockdown on IFNGR1 induction and delivered a remarkable synergistic antitumor effect with IFN-γ. In contrast, although they efficiently depleted histone Lysine 27 trimethylation, EZH2 catalytic inhibitors failed to mimic EZH2 depletion.

Methods:   From our prospective PCa registry, we identified a total of 350 men with newly-diagnosed PCa who completed the MAX-PC and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) at baseline and one-year following surgery. Scores on both measures were compared with clinical measure and demographics using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum, Fisher's exact, and Cochran-Armitage Trend tests.

Results:   Baseline overall MAX-PC measures were correlated with measures at one-year (r=0.5479, p<0.001). Those reporting high anxiety at one-year were more likely to have Gleason score>6 (p=0.004), T-Stage ≥ 2C disease (p=0.004), and a postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA)>0.1 (p=0.002); however, this did not apply to all anxious patients.

Methods:   Six patients receiving prostate radiation therapy underwent daily CBCTs. Manual alignment of CBCTFM and CBCTST was performed by three RTs. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using a modified Bland-Altman analysis for each alignment method. Clinically acceptable 95% limits of agreement with the mean (LoAmean ) were defined as ±2.0 mm for CBCTFM and ±3.0 mm for CBCTST . Differences between CBCTST alignment and the observer-averaged CBCTFM (AvCBCTFM ) alignment were analysed. Clinically acceptable 95% LoA were defined as ±3.0 mm for the comparison of CBCTST and AvCBCTFM .  Results:   CBCTFM and CBCTST alignments were performed for 185 images. The CBCTFM 95% LoAmean were within ±2.0 mm in all planes. CBCTST 95% LoAmean were within ±3.0 mm in all planes. Comparison of CBCTST with AvCBCTFM resulted in 95% LoA of -4.9 to 2.6, -1.6 to 2.5 and -4.7 to 1.9 mm in the superior-inferior, left-right and anterior-posterior planes, respectively.  Conclusions:   Significant differences were found between soft tissue alignment and the predicted FM position.

PIM kinases act in downstream effector functions as inhibitors of apoptosis and as positive regulators of G1-S phase progression through the cell cycle. PIM kinases are upregulated in multiple cancer indications, including lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and prostate, gastric, and head and neck cancers. Overexpression of one or more PIM family members in patient tumors frequently correlates with poor prognosis. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate PIM expression in low- and high-grade urothelial carcinoma and to assess the role PIM function in disease progression and their potential to serve as molecular targets for therapy. One hundred thirty-seven cases of urothelial carcinoma were included in this study of surgical biopsy and resection specimens. High levels of expression of all three PIM family members were observed in both noninvasive and invasive urothelial carcinomas.

Here, we examine ceRNA network dynamics in prostate cancer from the perspective of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) and reveal the principles of such changes. Analysis of exon array data revealed that both shortened and lengthened 3'UTRs are abundant. Consensus clustering with APA data stratified cancers into groups with differing risks of biochemical relapse and revealed that a ceRNA subnetwork enriched with cancer genes was specifically dysregulated in high-risk cancers. The novel connection between 3'UTR shortening and ceRNA network dysregulation was supported by the unusually high number of microRNA response elements (MREs) shared by the dysregulated ceRNA interactions and the significantly altered 3'UTRs. The dysregulation followed a fundamental principle in that ceRNA interactions connecting genes that show opposite trends in expression change are preferentially dysregulated. This targeted dysregulation is responsible for the majority of the observed expression changes in genes with significant ceRNA dysregulation and represents a novel mechanism underlying aberrant oncogenic expression.""","""['Li Li', 'Duolin Wang', 'Mengzhu Xue', 'Xianqiang Mi', 'Yanchun Liang', 'Peng Wang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""[""CstF64-Induced Shortening of the BID 3'UTR Promotes Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Progression by Disrupting ceRNA Cross-talk with ZFP36L2."", ""Formation, regulation and evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans 3'UTRs."", 'Genome-wide profiling reveals alternative polyadenylation of mRNA in human non-small cell lung cancer.', ""3'UTRs take a long shot in the brain."", ""Regulation and dysregulation of 3'UTR-mediated translational control."", ""Autonomous action and cooperativity between the ONECUT2 transcription factor and its 3' untranslated region."", 'Alternative polyadenylation regulation in cardiac development and cardiovascular disease.', ""UBE3D Regulates mRNA 3'-End Processing and Maintains Adipogenic Potential in 3T3-L1 Cells."", 'The transcriptional terminator XRN2 and the RNA-binding protein Sam68 link alternative polyadenylation to cell cycle progression in prostate cancer.', 'A ceRNA Network Composed of Survival-Related lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma.']"""

A single decision aid that addresses the needs of all FDRs, rather than one separating by race/ethnicity, was recommended as sufficient by study participants. These perspectives guided the development of an innovative decision aid that deconstructs the screening controversy and IDM processes into simpler concepts and provides step-by-step strategies for FDRs to engage in IDM.  Conclusion:   Implementing IDM among FDRs is challenging because the IDM paradigm departs from historical messages promoting routine screening. These contradictions should be recognized and addressed for men to participate effectively in IDM. A randomized pilot study evaluating outcomes of the resulting decision aid is underway.""","""['Clement K Gwede', 'Stacy N Davis', 'Shaenelle Wilson', 'Mitul Patel', 'Susan T Vadaparampil', 'Cathy D Meade', 'Brian M Rivers', 'Daohai Yu', 'Javier Torres-Roca', 'Randy Heysek', 'Philippe E Spiess', 'Julio Pow-Sang', 'Paul Jacobsen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Health Promot""","""['Informed decision making among first-degree relatives of prostate cancer survivors: a pilot randomized trial.', 'Digital Solutions for Informed Decision Making: An Academic-Community Partnership for the Development of a Prostate Cancer Decision Aid for African American Men.', 'A community-based intervention to promote informed decision making for prostate cancer screening among Hispanic American men changed knowledge and role preferences: a cluster RCT.', 'Informed decision making: what is its role in cancer screening?', 'Promoting informed decisions about cancer screening in communities and healthcare systems.', 'Predictors of annual prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening among black men: results from an urban community-based prostate cancer screening program.', 'Benefits and Harms of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance in a Prospective Cohort of Patients With Cirrhosis.', 'An Exploration of Precancer and Post-Cancer Diagnosis and Health Communication Among African American Prostate Cancer Survivors and Their Families.', ""Exploring Prostate Cancer Patients' Interest and Preferences for Receiving Genetic Risk Information About Cancer Aggressiveness."", ""Men's perspectives of prostate cancer screening: A systematic review of qualitative studies.""]"""

It has been hypothesized that miRNAs interact with transcription factors (TFs) in a coordinated fashion to play key roles in regulating signaling and transcriptional pathways and in achieving robust gene regulation. Here, we propose a novel integrative computational method to infer certain types of deregulated miRNA-mediated regulatory circuits at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and signaling levels. To reliably predict miRNA-target interactions from mRNA/miRNA expression data, our method collectively utilizes sequence-based miRNA-target predictions obtained from several algorithms, known information about mRNA and miRNA targets of TFs available in existing databases, certain molecular structures identified to be statistically over-represented in gene regulatory networks, available molecular subtyping information, and state-of-the-art statistical techniques to appropriately constrain the underlying analysis. In this way, the method exploits almost every aspect of extractable information in the expression data. We apply our procedure on mRNA/miRNA expression data from prostate tumor and normal samples and detect numerous known and novel miRNA-mediated deregulated loops and networks in prostate cancer. We also demonstrate instances of the results in a number of distinct biological settings, which are known to play crucial roles in prostate and other types of cancer. Our findings show that the proposed computational method can be used to effectively achieve notable insights into the poorly understood molecular mechanisms of miRNA-mediated interactions and dissect their functional roles in cancer in an effort to pave the way for miRNA-based therapeutics in clinical settings.""","""['Ali Sobhi Afshar', 'Joseph Xu', 'John Goutsias']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Predicting miRNA Targets by Integrating Gene Regulatory Knowledge with Expression Profiles.', 'Integrated analyses to reconstruct microRNA-mediated regulatory networks in mouse liver using high-throughput profiling.', 'A systems biology approach for miRNA-mRNA expression patterns analysis in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'A review on methods for predicting miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules.', 'Investigating miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks using crosslinking immunoprecipitation methods for biomarker and target discovery in cancer.', 'Identification of potential microRNA diagnostic panels and uncovering regulatory mechanisms in breast cancer pathogenesis.', 'Upregulated GATA3/miR205-5p Axis Inhibits MFNG Transcription and Reduces the Malignancy of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Modulating microRNAs in cancer: Next-generation therapies.', 'A developmental stage-specific network approach for studying dynamic co-regulation of transcription factors and microRNAs during craniofacial development.', 'MicroRNA and transcription factor co-regulatory networks and subtype classification of seminoma and non-seminoma in testicular germ cell tumors.']"""

Methods:   The number of attributable cancers was estimated using the population attributable fraction (PAF), risk estimates from recent meta-analyses and population exposure prevalence estimates obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2000). Age-sex-site-specific cancer incidence was obtained from Statistics Canada tables for the most up-to-date year with full national data, 2007. Where the evidence for association has been deemed sufficient, we estimated the number of incident cases of the following cancers attributable to obesity: colon, breast, endometrium, esophagus (adenocarcinomas), gallbladder, pancreas and kidney; and to physical inactivity: colon, breast, endometrium, prostate, lung and/or bronchus, and ovarian.  Results:   Overall, estimates of all cancer incidence in 2007 suggest that at least 3.5% (n=5771) and 7.9% (n=12,885) are attributed to excess body weight and physical inactivity respectively.

GPAT2 is a mitochondrial isoform primarily expressed in testis under physiological conditions. Because it is aberrantly expressed in multiple myeloma, it has been proposed as a novel cancer testis gene. Using a bioinformatics approach, we found that GPAT2 is highly expressed in melanoma, lung, prostate and breast cancer, and we validated GPAT2 expression at the protein level in breast cancer by immunohistochemistry. In this case GPAT2 expression correlated with a higher histological grade. 5-Aza-2' deoxycytidine treatment of human cells lines induced GPAT2 expression suggesting epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In order to evaluate the contribution of GPAT2 to the tumor phenotype, we silenced its expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. GPAT2 knockdown diminished cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth, migration and tumorigenicity, and increased staurosporine-induced apoptosis. In contrast, GPAT2 over-expression increased cell proliferation rate and resistance to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. To understand the functional role of GPAT2, we performed a co-expression analysis in mouse and human testis and found a significant association with semantic terms involved in cell cycle, DNA integrity maintenance, piRNA biogenesis and epigenetic regulation. Overall, these results indicate the GPAT2 would be directly associated with the control of cell proliferation.

It is more prevalent in older men with 75% of the incident cases above 65 years old. After radical prostatectomy, approximately 30% of men develop clinical recurrence with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen levels. Therefore, it is important to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa progression to develop novel diagnostic/therapeutic approaches. In this study, it is aimed to compare the microRNA (miRNA) profile of recurrent and non-recurrent prostate tumor tissues to explore the possible involvement of miRNAs in PCa progression. Total RNA from 41 recurrent and 41 non-recurrent PCa tissue samples were used to investigate the miRNA signature in PCa specimens. First of all, 20 recurrent and 20 non-recurrent PCa samples were profiled using miRNA microarray chips. Of the differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-1, miR-133b and miR-145* were selected for further validation with qRT-PCR in a different set of 21 recurrent and 21 non-recurrent PCa samples. Data were statistically analyzed using two-sided Student's t-test, Pearson Correlation test, Receiver operating characteristic analysis. Our results demonstrated that miR-1 and mir-133b have been significantly downregulated in recurrent PCa specimens in comparison to non-recurrent PCa samples and have sufficient power to distinguish recurrent specimens from non-recurrent ones on their own.

We compared the clinicopathological features between the morphologically ""regular type"" IDC-P and ""precursor-like"" IDC-P. IDC-P was defined as follows; 1) solid/dense cribriform lesions or 2) loose cribriform/micropapillary lesions with prominent nuclear pleomorphism and/or non-focal comedonecrosis.

IDC-P lacking the features of precursor-like IDC-P was categorized as regular type IDC-P. Of 901 radical prostatectomies performed at our hospital, 141 and 14 showed regular type IDC-P and precursor-like IDC-P in whole-mounted specimens, respectively. Regular type IDC-P cases had significantly higher Gleason score, more frequent extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion, more advanced pathological T stage, and lower 5-year biochemical recurrence-free rate than precursor-like IDC-P cases. Multivariate analysis revealed nodal metastasis and the presence of regular type IDC-P as independent predictors for biochemical recurrence.

In a panel of pleural mesothelioma cell lines, FGFR1 and FGF2 were coexpressed in three of seven cell lines and were significantly associated with sensitivity to the FGFR-active tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), ponatinib, both in vitro and in vivo using orthotopically propagated xenografts. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated silencing confirmed the requirement for FGFR1 in specific mesothelioma cells and sensitivity to the FGF ligand trap, FP-1039, validated the requirement for autocrine FGFs. None of the FGFR1-dependent mesothelioma cells exhibited increased FGFR1 gene copy number, based on a FISH assay, indicating that increased FGFR1 transcript and protein expression were not mediated by gene amplification. Elevated FGFR1 mRNA was detected in a subset of primary MPM clinical specimens and like MPM cells; none harbored increased FGFR1 gene copy number.

This study aims to describe NCS in malignancy and evaluate the disease trajectory, significance of diagnostic modalities and outcomes with palliative treatment.  Methods:   A retrospective study was performed on patients presenting with NCS between March 2007 and October 2013 at the Capital Region Cancer Service, Canberra.  Results:   Thirteen patients were identified who presented with numbness of the chin between March 2007 and October 2013. Seven patients had breast cancer, two had prostate cancer, two had multiple myeloma, one had medulloblastoma and one had an adenoid cystic salivary gland tumour. The mean interval from initial cancer diagnosis to development of the syndrome was 4.32 years. Twelve out of 13 patients had had prior chemotherapy with two or more lines of treatment (with a median of two lines), indicating this condition tended to present late in the course of disease in our patients. Four patients developed bilateral symptoms, and in two of these cases the metastatic lesion was in the base of the skull. Eleven out of 13 patients had positive signs on imaging. Nine out of 13 patients received palliative radiotherapy, with clinical response in eight patients.  Conclusion:   Patients with malignancy presented with NCS late in the disease trajectory, often after multiple lines of treatment.

Methods:   Between February, 2008 and October, 2010, 204 men with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated definitively with SBRT at Georgetown University Hospital. Patients were treated to 35-36.25 Gray (Gy) in 5 fractions delivered with the CyberKnife (Accuray). UI was assessed via the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC)-26.  Results:   Baseline UI was common with 4.4%, 1.0% and 3.4% of patients reporting leaking > 1 time per day, frequent dribbling and pad usage, respectively. Three year post treatment, 5.7%, 6.4% and 10.8% of patients reported UI based on leaking > 1 time per day, frequent dribbling and pad usage, respectively. Average EPIC UI summary scores showed an acute transient decline at one month post-SBRT then a second a gradual decline over the next three years. The proportion of men feeling that their UI was a moderate to big problem increased from 1% at baseline to 6.4% at three years post-SBRT.  Conclusions:   Prostate SBRT was well tolerated with UI rates comparable to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and brachytherapy. More than 90% of men who were pad-free prior to treatment remained pad-free three years following treatment.

Dendrimers, a special family of synthetic macromolecules, represent an exciting delivery platform by virtue of their well-defined dendritic structure and unique multivalency and cooperativity confined within a nanoscale volume. Here, we report a Dicer-substrate siRNA (dsiRNA) which, when delivered using a structurally flexible triethanolamine-core poly(amidoamine) dendrimer of generation 5 as the nanocarrier, gives rise to a much greater RNAi response than that produced with conventional siRNA. Further decoration of the dsiRNA/dendrimer complexes with a dual targeting peptide simultaneously promoted cancer cell targeting through interacting with integrins and cell penetration via the interaction with neuropilin-1 receptors, which led to improved gene silencing and anticancer activity. Altogether, our results disclosed here open a new avenue for therapeutic implementation of RNAi using dendrimer nanovector based targeted delivery.

We investigated orteronel without steroids in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC; M0).  Experimental design:   Patients with nmCRPC and rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) received orteronel 300 mg twice daily until PSA progression, metastases, or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was percentage of patients achieving PSA ≤0.2 ng/mL (undetectable levels) at 3 months. Secondary endpoints included safety, PSA response, time to metastases, and correlated endpoints.  Results:   Thirty-nine patients with a median baseline PSA doubling time of 2.4 months (range, 0.9-9.2) received a median of fourteen 28-day treatment cycles. PSA decreased >30% in 35 patients and 6 (16%) achieved PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL at 3 months. Median times to PSA progression and metastasis were 13.8 and 25.4 months, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from PSA progression were 57% and 42% at 12 and 24 months, and of freedom from metastasis were 94% and 62% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. At 3 months, median testosterone declined by 89% from baseline. Adverse events led to therapy discontinuation in 12 patients and grade ≥3/4 adverse events occurred in 22 patients. Most frequent all-cause adverse events included fatigue (64%), hypertension (44%), diarrhea (38%), and nausea (33%), which were primarily grade 1/2.

Methods:   A total of 100 prostate cancer patients underwent laparoscopic or robot-assisted pelvic lymph node dissection (95% extended). Surgical outcomes were compared with those of 43 patients undergoing open pelvic lymph node dissection (33% extended). Complications were recorded prospectively during hospitalization and follow-up visits, and graded using Clavien-Dindo classification. Lymphocele size was measured on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography.  Results:   Of the complications recorded, 10% were grade 1, 3% were grade 2 and 6% were grade 3. No grade 4-5 complications occurred. Compared with open pelvic lymph node dissection, minimally-invasive pelvic lymph node dissection was associated with less blood loss (P = 0.001) and shorter hospital stay (median 3 vs 6 days; P < 0.001), but longer operation time (130 vs 98 min; P < 0.001).

Conversely, the mechanical effect of high-intensity focused ultrasound (cavitation) is not affected by blood flow, and can induce vessel damage. In this series, the longitudinal change of blood flow on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was observed from postoperative day 1 to postoperative day 14 in 10 patients treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound. The median rates of increase in the non-enhanced volume of the whole gland, transition zone and peripheral zone from postoperative day 1 to postoperative day 14 were 36%, 39%, and 34%, respectively. In another pathological analysis of the prostate tissue of 17 patients immediately after high-intensity focused ultrasound without neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, we observed diffuse coagulative degeneration and partial non-coagulative prostate tissue around arteries with vascular endothelial cell detachment. These observations on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging support a time-dependent change of the blood flow in the prostate treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound.

Our pilot studies demonstrated elevated miR-409-3p/-5p expression in human prostate cancer bone metastatic cell lines; therefore, we defined the biologic impact of manipulation of miR-409-3p/-5p on prostate cancer progression and correlated the levels of its expression with clinical human prostate cancer bone metastatic specimens.  Experimental design:   miRNA profiling of a prostate cancer bone metastatic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cell line model was performed. A Gleason score human tissue array was probed for validation of specific miRNAs. In addition, genetic manipulation of miR-409-3p/-5p was performed to determine its role in tumor growth, EMT, and bone metastasis in mouse models.  Results:   Elevated expression of miR-409-3p/-5p was observed in bone metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and human prostate cancer tissues with higher Gleason scores. Elevated miR-409-3p expression levels correlated with progression-free survival of patients with prostate cancer. Orthotopic delivery of miR-409-3p/-5p in the murine prostate gland induced tumors where the tumors expressed EMT and stemness markers. Intracardiac inoculation (to mimic systemic dissemination) of miR-409-5p inhibitor-treated bone metastatic ARCaPM prostate cancer cells in mice led to decreased bone metastasis and increased survival compared with control vehicle-treated cells.  Conclusion:   miR-409-3p/-5p plays an important role in prostate cancer biology by facilitating tumor growth, EMT, and bone metastasis.

Methods and materials:   Computed tomographic (CT) data sets were retrospectively evaluated from 191 patients who underwent permanent prostate brachytherapy at our institution. The prostate, rectum, urethra, and bladder were each segmented with imaging software. Collected data and calculations included prostate volume at specific distances from the urethra and rectum, distances from seeds to urethra (SU), distances from seeds to rectum (SR), prostate length, and curvilinear prostatic urethra length.  Results:   The CT-based, postimplant mean prostate volume was 49cm(3) (range, 22-106cm(3)). Mean prostate length was 4.5cm (range, 3.1-6.0cm). The mean curvilinear length of the prostatic urethra was 4.5cm. The mean (standard deviation) prostatic urethra bend was 29.0° (12.2°). The mean surface distance from the prostate to the urethra was 2.9cm and from the prostate to the rectum w as 4.6cm (p<0.001, paired t test). The mean SU distance was 1.6cm, and the mean SR distance was 2.3cm (p<0.001). In the largest prostate, the mean SU distance was 3.9cm and the mean SR distance was 6.0cm.  Conclusions:   A urethral imaging device for prostate brachytherapy and other minimally invasive prostate therapies should ideally have a 6-cm imaging field of view to image all the prostates in this series in a single image. The mean distance from the SU in permanent prostate brachytherapy is less than 70% of the mean SR distance.""","""['David R Holmes rd', 'Brian J Davis', 'Christopher C Goulet', 'Torrence M Wilson', 'Lance A Mynderse', 'Keith M Furutani', 'Jon J Camp', 'Richard A Robb']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['A novel urethral sparing technique for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy after transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'Comparison of intraoperative ultrasound with postimplant computed tomography--dosimetric values at Day 1 and Day 30 after prostate brachytherapy.', 'Seed displacements after permanent brachytherapy for prostate cancer in dependence on the prostate level.', 'Comparison of intraoperative dosimetric implant representation with postimplant dosimetry in patients receiving prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prostate volume measurement by transrectal ultrasound and computed tomography before and after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'All over the map: An interobserver agreement study of tumor location based on the PI-RADSv2 sector map.']"""

The authors investigated the relationship between crime, poverty, and poor housing, among others, and postdiagnosis urologist visits among AA and white men.  Methods:   The authors used linked cancer registry and Medicare claims data from 1999 through 2007 for men diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to III prostate cancer. The USA Counties and County Business Patterns data sets provided county-level data. Variance components models reported the percentage of variation attributed to county of residence.

Results:   A total of 65,635 patients were identified; 87% of whom were non-Hispanic white and 9.3% of whom were non-Hispanic AA. Approximately 16% of men diagnosed with stage I to III prostate cancer did not visit a urologist within 1 year after diagnosis (22% of AA men and 15% of white men). County of residence accounted for 10% of the variation in the visit outcome (13% for AA men and 10% for white men). AA men were more likely to live in counties ranked highest in terms of poverty, occupied housing units with no telephone, and crime. AA men were less likely to see a urologist (odds ratio, 0.65 [95% confidence interval, 0.6-0.71]; rate ratio, 0.94 [95% confidence interval, 0.92-0.95]). The sign and magnitude of the coefficients for the county-level measures differed across race-specific regression models of urologist visits.

A specific interaction between quercetin and hnRNPA1 was validated by immunoblotting and in vitro binding experiments. We found that quercetin bound the C-terminal region of hnRNPA1, impairing the ability of hnRNPA1 to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and ultimately resulting in its cytoplasmic retention. In addition, hnRNPA1 was recruited to stress granules after treatment of cells with quercetin for up to 48 h, and the levels of cIAP1 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis), an internal ribosome entry site translation-dependent protein, were reduced by hnRNPA1 regulation.

Methods:   A total of 693 PC survivors (3-8 years after diagnosis) completed a mailed survey on physical and psychological functioning, including cancer treatments, the Short Form-12 (SF-12), the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Instrument (EPIC-26), a depression rating scale, and 8 items regarding recent suicidal thoughts and behaviors.  Results:   A total of 86 PC survivors (12.4%) endorsed SI, with 10 individuals (1.4%) reporting serious SI. Serious SI was more common in this sample compared with age-adjusted and sex-adjusted normative data. SI was not associated with most demographic variables, or with PC stage or treatments. However, SI was found to be significantly associated with employment status, poor physical and emotional functioning, greater symptom burden on the EPIC-26, higher frequency of significant pain, and clinically significant depression (P < .01). In an adjusted logistic model, poor physical and emotional function, including disability status and pain, were found to be associated with SI (P < .05), even after adjusting for depression.  Conclusions:   A significant percentage of PC survivors report recent SI, which is associated with both physical and psychological dysfunction, but not PC treatments.

The LNCaP human prostate cell line was previously set up as a model system to investigate chemicals affecting prostate epithelium functionality by means of a tiered approach integrating two different toxicological endpoints, cell viability (MTS) and PSA secretion assays. Here, the same approach has been used to characterize the biological effects of phytochemicals on prostate epithelium. The antiandrogenic ability of phytochemicals to inhibit DHT-induced PSA secretion has been investigated also characterizing their intracellular distribution, in the presence or absence of sex steroids.

To overcome this therapeutic hurdle, the identification of new molecular targets is a critical issue. The capability to proliferate in three-dimensional (3D) conditions is a characteristic property of cancer cells. Therefore, factors that regulate 3D growth are considered rational targets for cancer therapy. Here, we applied a functional genomic approach to the 3D spheroid cell culture model and identified TRIB1, a member of the Trib family of serine/threonine kinase-like proteins, as an essential factor for prostate cancer cell growth and survival. RNAi-mediated silencing of TRIB1 suppressed prostate cancer cell growth selectively under the 3D conditions. This effect was rescued by ectopic expression of an RNAi-resistant TRIB1 exogene. Gene signature-based analysis revealed that TRIB1 was related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways in prostate cancer and was required for expression of the ER chaperone GRP78, which is critical for prostate tumorigenesis. Of note, GRP78 was expressed preferentially in a subpopulation of prostate cancer cells that possess tumor-propagating potential, and these tumor-propagating cells were highly sensitive to TRIB1 and GRP78 depletion. In a xenograft model of human prostate cancer, TRIB1 depletion strongly inhibited tumor formation. Supporting these observations, we documented frequent overexpression of TRIB1 in clinical specimens of prostate cancer. Overall, our results indicated that the TRIB1-ER chaperone axis drives prostate tumorigenesis and the survival of the tumor-propagating cells.""","""['Tetsuo Mashima', 'Taeko Soma-Nagae', 'Toshiro Migita', 'Ryoko Kinoshita', 'Atsushi Iwamoto', 'Takeshi Yuasa', 'Junji Yonese', 'Yuichi Ishikawa', 'Hiroyuki Seimiya']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['MicroRNA-224 inhibits progression of human prostate cancer by downregulating TRIB1.', 'Expression of stress response protein Grp78 is associated with the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum ribosome-binding protein 1 (RRBP1) overexpression is frequently found in lung cancer patients and alleviates intracellular stress-induced apoptosis through the enhancement of GRP78.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29): An emerging role in cancer.', 'Deciphering the role of TRIB1 in regulatory T-cells.', 'TRIB1 confers therapeutic resistance in GBM cells by activating the ERK and Akt pathways.', 'TRIB1 regulates liver regeneration by antagonizing the NRF2-mediated antioxidant response.', 'The Pseudokinase TRIB1 in Immune Cells and Associated Disorders.', 'miR-513b-5p inhibits the proliferation and promotes apoptosis of retinoblastoma cells by targeting TRIB1.', 'Musings from the Tribbles Research and Innovation Network.']"""

Defining the specific gene hypermethylation profile for prostate cancer could involve groups of genes that specifically discriminate patients with indolent and aggressive tumors.  Methods:   Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on 83 tumor and 10 normal prostate samples using the GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I (Illumina, Inc.). All clinical stages of disease were considered.  Results:   We found 41 genes hypermethylated in more than 20% of the tumors analyzed (P < 0.01). Of these, we newly identified GSTM2 and PENK as being genes that are hypermethylated in prostate cancer and that were simultaneously methylated in 40.9% of the tumors analyzed. We also identified panels of genes that are more frequently methylated in tumor samples with clinico-pathological indicators of poor prognosis: a high Gleason score, elevated Ki-67, and advanced disease. Of these, we found simultaneous hypermethylation of CFTR and HTR1B to be common in patients with a high Gleason score and high Ki-67 levels; this might indicate the population at higher risk of therapeutic failure. The DNA hypermethylation profile was associated with cancer-specific mortality (log-rank test, P = 0.007) and biochemical recurrence-free survival (log-rank test, P = 0.0008).  Conclusions:   Our findings strongly indicate that epigenetic silencing of GSTM2 and PENK is a common event in prostate cancer that could be used as a molecular marker for prostate cancer diagnosis. In addition, simultaneous HTR1B and CFTR hypermethylation could help discriminate aggressive from indolent prostate tumors.""","""['Nadia Ashour', 'Javier C Angulo', 'Guillermo Andrés', 'Raúl Alelú', 'Ana González-Corpas', 'María V Toledo', 'José M Rodríguez-Barbero', 'Jose I López', 'Manuel Sánchez-Chapado', 'Santiago Ropero']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Development of Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer can be Predicted by a DNA Hypermethylation Profile.', 'Promoter hypermethylation as an independent prognostic factor for relapse in patients with prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy.', 'A DNA Hypermethylation Profile Independently Predicts Biochemical Recurrence Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Detection of DNA hypermethylation as a potential biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Promoter hypermethylation as a biomarker in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Canine-Inspired Chemometric Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds in Urine Headspace to Distinguish Prostate Cancer in Mice and Men.', 'Claudin-3 Loss of Expression Is a Prognostic Marker in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification and validation of methylated PENK gene for early detection of bladder cancer using urine DNA.', 'Identification of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator as a prognostic marker for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia via the whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of monozygotic twins and data mining.', 'MicroRNA global profiling in cystic fibrosis cell lines reveals dysregulated pathways related with inflammation, cancer, growth, glucose and lipid metabolism, and fertility: an exploratory study.']"""

The aims of this study were to determine if TCF7L2 rs7903146 is associated with risk of PCa and if the association is modified by lifestyle factors independently of T2D status.  Methods:   We prospectively followed 8,558 men in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study from baseline 1991-1996 until end of 2009. Cox regression models were used to assess the association between rs7903146 T2D-risk allele (T) and PCa. Effect modification by incident T2D status, fasting glucose levels, dietary, and lifestyle risk factors were tested.  Results:   During follow-up 855 incident PCa cases were registered.

Although previous studies in PCa have focused on cell adherens junctions (AJs), key players in metastasis, they have left the molecular mechanisms unexplored. Inflammation and the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical in the regulation of cell adhesion and the integrity of the epithelium. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) counteracts oxidative and inflammatory damage. Here, we investigated whether HO-1 is implicated in the adhesive and morphological properties of tumor cells. Genes differentially regulated by HO-1 were enriched for cell motility and adhesion biological processes. HO-1 induction, increased E-cadherin and β-catenin levels. Immunofluorescence analyses showed a striking remodeling of E-cadherin/ β-catenin based AJs under HO-1 modulation. Interestingly, the enhanced levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin coincided with a markedly change in cell morphology. To further our analysis we sought to identify HO-1 binding proteins that might participate in the regulation of cell morphology. A proteomics approach identified Muskelin, as a novel HO-1 partner, strongly implicated in cell morphology regulation. These results define a novel role for HO-1 in modulating the architecture of cell-cell interactions, favoring a less aggressive phenotype and further supporting its anti-tumoral function in PCa.""","""['Geraldine Gueron', 'Jimena Giudice', 'Pia Valacco', 'Alejandra Paez', 'Belen Elguero', 'Martin Toscani', 'Felipe Jaworski', 'Federico Coluccio Leskow', 'Javier Cotignola', 'Marcelo Marti', 'Maria Binaghi', 'Nora Navone', 'Elba Vazquez']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Critical role of endogenous heme oxygenase 1 as a tuner of the invasive potential of prostate cancer cells.', 'Heme oxygenase-1 in macrophages controls prostate cancer progression.', 'Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) challenges the angiogenic switch in prostate cancer.', 'Cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions in normal and cancer cells.', 'A Dual Role of Heme Oxygenase-1 in Cancer Cells.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Hemoxygenase-1 Promotes Head and Neck Cancer Cell Viability.', 'Dynamics of antioxidant heme oxygenase-1 and pro-oxidant p66Shc in promoting advanced prostate cancer progression.', 'Exploiting Interdata Relationships in Prostate Cancer Proteomes: Clinical Significance of HO-1 Interactors.', 'A Missense Variant in SLC39A4 in a Litter of Turkish Van Cats with Acrodermatitis Enteropathica.']"""

The rise of minimally invasive surgery and new technologies have yielded better results and enabled us to pursue more ambitious objectives. The main works still use the trifecta as classic presentation, but this does not cover all aspects of surgery. Pentafecta is a new and more comprehensive methodology to report outcomes after RP, including complications and surgical margin status with the three major outcomes classically reported. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) by applying the concept of pentafecta.  Material and method:   Describe the experience in this institution from March 2009 to December 2012 of RALRP by pentafecta.  Results:   We performed 101 interventions and obtained the following results: Average age 60.89 ± 7.32 years (40-77), total PSA 8.5 ± 5.57 ng/dl (0.2-29); D'Amico classification: Low 29 (28.71%), Medium 65 (64.36%), High 7 (6.93%); Operative time 253.44 ± 51.51 min (90-540), Complications 12.9% (Clavien I-II 10.89% and Clavien IIIa 1.98%); Positive surgical margins 20.83%; Biochemistry recurrence 12.5% follow-up (6-44 months); and Continence 87.5% per year and Potency 59.52%.

Methods:   The ARADES trial is an open-label phase 1-2 trial undertaken in 23 hospitals across Europe and USA with ongoing long-term follow-up. Men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who had castrate concentrations of testosterone and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0-1 were enrolled. In the phase 1 part of the trial, patients were given oral ODM-201 at a starting daily dose of 200 mg, which was increased to 400 mg, 600 mg, 1000 mg, 1400 mg, and 1800 mg. In phase 2, patients were randomly assigned centrally and stratified by previous chemotherapy and treatment with CPY17 inhibitors, to receive one of three daily doses of ODM-201 (200 mg, 400 mg, and 1400 mg). The primary endpoint in phase 1 was safety and tolerability, whereas in phase 2 it was the proportion of patients with a PSA response (50% or greater decrease in serum PSA) at week 12. All analyses included patients who had received at least one dose of ODM-201. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01317641, and NCT01429064 for the follow-up after 12 weeks.  Findings:   We enrolled patients between April 5, 2011, and March 12, 2013. In phase 1, 24 patients were enrolled to six sequential cohorts of three to six patients and received a daily dose of ODM-201, 200-1800 mg. No dose-limiting toxic effects were reported and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. In phase 1, three patients reported eight adverse events of grade 3 (fracture, muscle injury, laceration, paralytic ileus, pain, presyncope, urinary retention, and vomiting) and one patient had a grade 4 adverse event (lymphoedema). None of the grade 3-4 adverse events were deemed to be related to ODM-201. Of the phase 1 patients, the four who received 200 mg, seven who received 400 mg, and three who received 1400 mg entered the phase 2 part of the trial. In addition to these patients, 110 were randomly assigned to three groups: 200 mg (n=38), 400 mg (n=37), and 1400 mg (n=35). For these patients, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue or asthenia (15 [12%] of 124 patients), hot flush (six [5%]), and decreased appetite (five [4%]). One patient (<1%) had a grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse event (fatigue); no patients had a treatment-emergent grade 4 adverse event. 38 patients who received 200 mg, 39 who received 400 mg, and 33 who received 1400 mg were assessable for PSA response at 12 weeks. 11 (29%) patients in the 200 mg group, 13 (33%) in the 400 mg group, and 11 (33%) in the 1400 mg group had a PSA response at 12 weeks.

Several molecular mechanisms have been attributed to its inhibitory effects on a wide range of tumor cells; however, the mechanism causing cancer cell death is still obscure. For the current study, we further investigated the mechanism responsible for targeting cordycepin-induced cell death and its association with autophagy in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. Our results show that cordycepin resulted in significant reduction in LNCaP cell survival by inducing apoptotic cell death. Cordycepin treatment caused a dose-dependent increase of pro-apoptotic Bax and decrease of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, triggering collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9 and -3. Cordycepin-induced cell death was also associated with induction of Fas and death receptor 5, activation of caspase-8, and truncation of Bid (tBid), suggesting that tBid might serve to connect activation of both the mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic and death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The general caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, completely abolished cordycepin-induced cell death, demonstrating that cordycepin-induced apoptosis was dependent on the activation of caspases. Cordycepin also stimulated autophagy, which was evidenced by an increase in microtubule-associated protein light chain-3 (LC3) puncta, accumulation of LC3-II, and elevation of autophagic flux; however, blockage of autophagic flux by the autophagic inhibitor bafilomycin A1 promoted cell-switching to apoptotic cell death. These findings suggest that cordycepin-induced autophagy functions as a survival mechanism and that autophagy is a potential strategy for treating prostate cancer that is resistant to pro-apoptotic therapeutics.""","""['Hye Hyeon Lee', 'Sung Ok Kim', 'Gi-Young Kim', 'Sung-Kwon Moon', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Yong Kee Jeong', 'Young Hyun Yoo', 'Yung Hyun Choi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Environ Toxicol Pharmacol""","""['Apoptosis induction of human prostate carcinoma cells by cordycepin through reactive oxygen species‑mediated mitochondrial death pathway.', 'Silibinin triggers apoptotic signaling pathways and autophagic survival response in human colon adenocarcinoma cells and their derived metastatic cells.', 'Cordycepin-induced apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer cells are independent of the estrogen receptor.', 'The Role of Autophagy in Anti-Cancer and Health Promoting Effects of Cordycepin.', 'The Anticancer Properties of Cordycepin and Their Underlying Mechanisms.', ""Synthesis and Characterization of NUC-7738, an Aryloxy Phosphoramidate of 3'-Deoxyadenosine, as a Potential Anticancer Agent."", 'Chinese Cordyceps: Bioactive Components, Antitumor Effects and Underlying Mechanism-A Review.', 'Cordycepin Attenuates Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Rats via Modulation of AMPK and AKT Activation.', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'How Should the Worldwide Knowledge of Traditional Cancer Healing Be Integrated with Herbs and Mushrooms into Modern Molecular Pharmacology?']"""

Free G-rich DNA aptamer-conjugated 6-FAM emits bright light in guanine chemiluminescence reaction based on the principle of chemiluminescent resonance energy transfer (CRET). However, G-rich DNA aptamer-conjugated 6-FAM bound with PSA cannot emit light because PSA acts as a strong interference in CRET between 6-FAM and high-energy intermediate formed from the reaction of 3,4,5-trimethoxylphenylglyoxal (TMPG) and guanine of G-rich DNA aptamer. A chemiluminescent biosensor, developed using the different properties of G-rich DNA aptamer-conjugated 6-FAM in the absence and presence of PSA in guanine chemiluminescence reaction, was able to quantify trace levels of PSA in human serum within 30 min without time-consuming and complicated procedures (e.g., multiple incubation and washings) required for conventional immunoassays operated with expensive and intractable antibodies.

A promising approach to preventing relapse after conventional therapy is to establish tumor antigen-specific immune control. Efficient and specific T cell memory against the tumor depends on the expansion of rare T cells with native specificity against target antigens overexpressed by the tumor. Candidate antigens in EwS include six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate-1 (STEAP1), and the human cancer/testis antigens X-antigen family member 1 (XAGE1) and preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME). Here, we screened normal donors and EwS patients for the presence of circulating T cells reactive with overlapping peptide libraries of these antigens by IFN-γ Elispot analysis. The majority of 22 healthy donors lacked detectable memory T cell responses against STEAP1, XAGE1 and PRAME. Moreover, ex vivo detection of T cells specific for these antigens in both blood and bone marrow were limited to a minority of EwS patients and required nonspecific T cell prestimulation. Cytotoxic T cells specific for the tumor-associated antigens were efficiently and reliably generated by in vitro priming using professional antigen-presenting cells and optimized cytokine stimulation; however, these T cells failed to interact with native antigen processed by target cells and with EwS cells expressing the antigen. We conclude that EwS-associated antigens fail to induce efficient T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated antitumor immune responses even under optimized conditions.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy avoids deep tissue injury and is a promising treatment for CRP.  Objective:   To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of RFA for the treatment of CRP.  Design:   Multicenter, retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database.  Setting:   Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, Massachusetts; Sarasota Memorial Hospital and Suncoast Endoscopy of Sarasota, Florida.  Patients:   A total of 39 consecutive patients with CRP.  Interventions:   Endoscopic RFA of CRP.  Main outcome measurements:   The primary endpoint of the study was complete resolution of rectal bleeding. Secondary endpoints included visually scored improvement of CRP on endoscopic follow-up by using a rectal telangiectasia density (RTD) grading score, improvement in hemoglobin level, and adverse events related to the procedure.  Results:   A total of 39 male patients (mean [± standard deviation {SD}] age 72.9 ± 6.6 years) were included in the study. The mean number of RFA sessions was 1.49 (median 1, interquartile range [IQR] 1-2, range 1-4), with a mean interval of 18 weeks between sessions. Rectal bleeding stopped completely in all patients during the mean follow-up of 28 months (range 7-53 months). A significant improvement occurred in the mean (± SD) hemoglobin level from 11.8 ± 2 to 13.5 ± 1.6 g % (P < .0001). Endoscopic severity also improved significantly with an improvement in the median RTD score from 3 (IQR 2-3) to 0 (IQR 0-1) (P < .0001). Treatment with RFA led to discontinuation of blood transfusion and iron therapy in 92% and 82% patients, respectively.  Limitations:   Retrospective analysis, lack of control group.

All surgeries were performed by a single-faculty surgeon well after the learning curve was established. In all cases, chief residents participated in the surgery and performed progressively more portions. Demographic, intraoperative and pathologic parameters were obtained. Continence and erectile function were assessed at 6 and 12 months. Postoperative complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Predictors of outcomes on univariate analysis were included in multivariate logistic or linear models.  Results:   Of 381 patients, 185 and 196 underwent single- or dual-console RALP, respectively. There was a significant decrease in mean operative time using the dual-console system (222 vs. 171 min, p < 0.0001) as well as in the incidence of intraoperative complications (8.65 vs. 1.53%, p < 0.0001) and postoperative complications (14.1 vs. 6.63%, p = 0.03.) Complications of Clavien grade ≥3a occurred more frequently with a single-console system (7 vs. 1%, p = 0.003.) Differences persisted when controlling for potential confounders by multivariate regression. Postoperative measures of continence, erectile function and the rate of biochemical recurrence were similar between cohorts.

Methods:   In 235 consecutive patients [aged 65.7 ± 7.9 years; median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 8 ng/ml] with multiparametric prostate MRI (mp-MRI), 566 lesions were scored according to PI-RADS. Histology of all lesions was obtained by targeted MR-guided in-bore biopsy.  Results:   In 200 lesions, biopsy revealed prostate cancer (PCa).

Despite similar postoperative characteristics, a significant proportion of men with an intermediate risk of progression experience prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-defined failure, while others have relapse-free survival (RFS). Additional prognostic markers are needed to predict the outcome of these patients. KLLN is a transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle and induces apoptosis in cancer cells. We have shown that KLLN is an androgen-regulated gene and that loss of KLLN expression in primary CaP is associated with high Gleason score. In this retrospective study, we evaluated KLLN expression in the high-grade malignancy components from 109 men with intermediate risk CaP. Patients with nuclear KLLN-negative tumors had significantly higher preoperative serum PSA levels (12.24±2.37 ng/ml) and larger tumor volumes (4.61±0.71 cm(3)) compared with nuclear KLLN-positive patients (8.35±2.45 ng/ml, P=0.03, and 2.66±0.51 cm(3), P<0.0001, respectively).

Overexpression of VEGF and the extent of neoangiogenesis are closely correlated with tumor development and cancer metastases. Recent studies suggest MDM2 as one of the major regulators of pro-angiogenic mechanisms. To assess the direct correlation of HIF-1α and NF-κB, and the actual mechanism of MDM2 involved in the control over VEGF transcription, we exposed the LNCaP and LNCaP-MST cells (MDM2 transfected) to hypoxia. Our experiments confirm that MDM2 activation can lead to significant decrease in the levels of p53 in MDM2 transfected LNCaP-MST cells than the wild-type LNCaP cells. The results further suggest that MDM2 can be a strong regulator of both p53 dependent and independent transcriptional activity. Similarly, an increased level of other transcription factors such as HIF-1α, P300, STAT3, pAKT and NF-κB was observed. As a point of convergence for many oncogenic signaling pathways, STAT3 is constitutively activated at high frequency in a wide diversity of cancers. Our results indicate that STAT3 can directly regulate VEGF expression that is controlled by MDM2. Furthermore, it is evident from our results that NF-κB may interfere with the transcriptional activity of p53, by downregulating its levels. On the other hand, several pro-angiogenic mechanisms, including VEGF transcription which is controlled by MDM2, seem to be mediated by NF-κB.""","""['Praneetha Muthumani', 'Karthikeyan Alagarsamy', 'Sivanesan Dhandayuthapani', 'Thiagarajan Venkatesan', 'Appu Rathinavelu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Biol Rep""","""['A novel regulation of VEGF expression by HIF-1α and STAT3 in HDM2 transfected prostate cancer cells.', 'Aromatic Hydrocarbon Receptor Suppresses Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis Cells-Induced Vasculogenesis of Endothelial Progenitor Cells under Hypoxia.', 'Effect of MDM2 and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in neuroblastoma.', 'Dual Roles of the AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Pathway in Angiogenesis.', 'The role of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1alpha and its signaling in melanoma.', 'Alterations in p53 Influence hTERT, VEGF and MMPs Expression in Oral Cancer Patients.', 'Resistance mechanisms to inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interactions in cancer therapy: can we overcome them?', 'Synthetic curcumin analog: inhibiting the invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in human laryngeal carcinoma cells via NF-kB pathway.', 'XPD suppresses cell proliferation and migration via miR-29a-3p-Mdm2/PDGF-B axis in HCC.', 'Prevention of prostate cancer by natural product MDM2 inhibitor GS25: in vitro and in vivo activities and molecular mechanisms.']"""

In dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI these functional parameters are related to the microvasculature environment and the concentration changes that occur rapidly after the injection of a contrast agent. Typically DCE images are reconstructed individually and kinetic parameters are estimated by fitting a pharmacokinetic model to the time-enhancement response; these methods can be denoted as ""indirect"". If undersampling is present to accelerate the acquisition, techniques such as kt-FOCUSS can be employed in the reconstruction step to avoid image degradation. This paper suggests a Bayesian inference framework to estimate functional parameters directly from the measurements at high temporal resolution. The current implementation estimates pharmacokinetic parameters (related to the extended Tofts model) from undersampled (k, t)-space DCE MRI. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a simulated abdominal DCE phantom and prostate DCE data, for fully sampled, 4 and 8-fold undersampled (k, t)-space data. Direct kinetic parameters demonstrate better correspondence (up to 70% higher mutual information) to the ground truth kinetic parameters (of the simulated abdominal DCE phantom) than the ones derived from the indirect methods. For the prostate DCE data, direct kinetic parameters depict the morphology of the tumour better.

Patients were divided into those with no prior hormonal treatment (designated as PCa/AdvPCa) vs. those with castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC) undergoing channel TURP to relieve obstructive symptoms. The expression status was correlated with various clinical-pathological parameters. The Swedish watchful-waiting cohort was used for validation and characterization of potential gene signatures associated with ERG and AR. Patients with combined ERG-positive/AR high expression profile demonstrated higher rates of PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) compared with patients with ERG-negative/AR low in patients with no prior treatment (n = 90, P = 0.032), but this was attenuated in the overall cohort which included the CRPC subgroup (n = 125, P = 0.096).

ERG/AR overexpression status characterized 152 genes signatures including WNT, PI3K/AKT and chemokine signaling pathways known to be deregulated in PCa. In conclusion, combined ERG/AR overexpression signifies a class of patients at highest-risk of PCSM with specific key genetic alteration likely responsible for disease progression.

Here, we report that GAK expression is positively correlated with the Gleason score in surgical specimens from prostate cancer patients. Embryonic fibroblasts from knockout mice expressing a kinase-dead (KD) form of GAK showed constitutive hyper-phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In addition to the well-known EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib, the dietary flavonoid luteolin was a potent inhibitor of the Ser/Thr kinase activity of GAK in vitro. Co-administration of luteolin and gefitinib to PC-3 cells had a greater effect on cell viability than administration of either compound alone; this decrease in viability was associated with drastic down-regulation of GAK protein expression. A comprehensive microRNA array analysis revealed increased expression of miR-630 and miR-5703 following treatment of PC-3 cells with luteolin and/or gefitinib, and exogenous overexpression of miR-630 caused growth arrest of these cells. GAK appears to be essential for cell death because co-administration of gefitinib and luteolin to EGFR-deficient U2OS osteosarcoma cells also had a greater effect on cell viability than administration of either compound alone.

Exposure increased linearly from 0.3 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg. AMG 745 significantly increased LBM in the 3 mg/kg vs the placebo groups on day 29 by 2.2% (±0.8% SE, P = 0.008); in exploratory fat mass analysis, a decrease of -2.5% (±1.0% SE, P = 0.021) was observed. Pharmacodynamic changes in muscle and fat were maintained at follow-up, 1 month after day 29.  Conclusion:   Four weekly s.c. doses of AMG 745 were well tolerated and were associated with increased LBM and decreased fat in the men receiving ADT for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.

Cysmethynil, a prototypical indole-based inhibitor of Icmt, effectively inhibits tumor cell growth. However, the physical properties of cysmethynil, such as its low aqueous solubility, make it a poor candidate for clinical development. A novel amino-derivative of cysmethynil with superior physical properties and marked improvement in efficacy, termed compound 8.12, has recently been reported. We report here that Icmt (-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are much more resistant to compound 8.12-induced cell death than their wild-type counterparts, providing evidence that the anti-proliferative effects of this compound are mediated through an Icmt specific mechanism. Treatment of PC3 prostate and HepG2 liver cancer cells with compound 8.12 resulted in pre-lamin A accumulation and Ras delocalization from the plasma membrane, both expected outcomes from inhibition of the Icmt-catalyzed carboxylmethylation. Treatment with compound 8.12 induced cell cycle arrest, autophagy and cell death, and abolished anchorage-independent colony formation. Consistent with its greater in vitro efficacy, compound 8.12 inhibited tumor growth with greater potency than cysmethynil in a xenograft mouse model. Further, a drug combination study identified synergistic antitumor efficacy of compound 8.12 and the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)-inhibitor gefitinib, possibly through enhancement of autophagy. This study establishes compound 8.12 as a pharmacological inhibitor of Icmt that is an attractive candidate for further preclinical and clinical development.""","""['Hiu Yeung Lau', 'Pondy M Ramanujulu', 'Dianyan Guo', 'Tianming Yang', 'Melissa Wirawan', 'Patrick J Casey', 'Mei-Lin Go', 'Mei Wang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['A small molecule inhibitor of isoprenylcysteine carboxymethyltransferase induces autophagic cell death in PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase induces autophagic-dependent apoptosis and impairs tumor growth.', 'Isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase regulates ovarian cancer cell response to chemotherapy and Ras activation.', 'Isoprenyl carboxyl methyltransferase inhibitors: a brief review including recent patents.', 'Small change, big effect: Taking RAS by the tail through suppression of post-prenylation carboxylmethylation.', 'CircRNA hsa_circ_0018289 exerts an oncogenic role in cervical cancer progression through miR-1294/ICMT axis.', 'Isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase is critical for glioblastoma growth and survival by activating Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk.', 'The wide and growing range of lamin B-related diseases: from laminopathies to cancer.', 'Suppression of isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase compromises DNA damage repair.', 'Ras Family of Small GTPases in CRC: New Perspectives for Overcoming Drug Resistance.']"""

Human tumor cells derived from lung, breast and prostate cancers were tested for radiosensitization by niraparib using clonogenic survival assays. Both p53 wild-type and p53-defective lines were included. The ability of niraparib to alter the repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) was determined using detection of γ-H2AX foci and RAD51 foci. Clonogenic survival analyses indicated that micromolar concentrations of niraparib radiosensitized tumor cell lines derived from lung, breast, and prostate cancers independently of their p53 status but not cell lines derived from normal tissues. Niraparib also sensitized tumor cells to H2O2 and converted H2O2-induced single strand breaks (SSBs) into DSBs during DNA replication. These results indicate that human tumor cells are significantly radiosensitized by the potent and selective PARP-1 inhibitor, niraparib, in the in vitro setting. The mechanism of this effect appears to involve a conversion of sublethal SSBs into lethal DSBs during DNA replication due to the inhibition of base excision repair by the drug.

The current aim was to further characterize biological responses and mechanisms underpinning CXCL8-promoted progression of PTEN-depleted prostate cancer, focusing on characterizing the potential interplay between CXCL8 and other disease-promoting chemokines resident within the prostate tumor microenvironment. Autocrine CXCL8-stimulation (i) increased expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in PTEN-deficient CaP cells suggesting a self-potentiating signaling axis and (ii) induced expression of CXCR4 and CCR2 in PTEN-wild-type and PTEN-depleted CaP cells. In contrast, paracrine CXCL8 signaling induced expression and secretion of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12 from prostate stromal WPMY-1 fibroblasts and monocytic macrophage-like THP-1 cells. In vitro studies demonstrated functional co-operation of tumor-derived CXCL8 with stromal-derived chemokines. CXCL12-induced migration of PC3 cells and CCL2-induced proliferation of prostate cancer cells were dependent upon intrinsic CXCL8 signaling within the prostate cancer cells. For example, in co-culture experiments, CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling but not CCL2/CCR2 signaling supported fibroblast-mediated migration of PC3 cells while CXCL12/CXCR4 and CCL2/CCR2 signaling underpinned monocyte-enhanced migration of PC3 cells. Combined inhibition of both CXCL8 and CXCL12 signaling was more effective in inhibiting fibroblast-promoted cell motility while repression of CXCL8 attenuated CCL2-promoted proliferation of prostate cancer cells. We conclude that tumor-derived CXCL8 signaling from PTEN-deficient tumor cells increases the sensitivity and responsiveness of CaP cells to stromal chemokines by concurrently upregulating receptor expression in cancer cells and inducing stromal chemokine synthesis.

The results of the proliferative activity quantification (mitotic activity index and mitotic density) have shown that this can be a decisive criterion for the precocious appreciation of the evolution. The most important morphological criterion with a predictive role is the mitotic activity index, but is recommended to be applied correlated with the size and the localization of the tumor.

As observed in 1924 by Otto Warburg, cancer cells show preferential glucose consumption by way of aerobic glycolysis while normal cells generally assume mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Another metabolic hallmark of carcinogenesis is altered lipid metabolism, whereby cancer cells may adopt enhanced de novo lipid production (lipogenesis). Enhanced lipid metabolism is also observed in individuals with metabolic syndromes potentially a consequence of increasing popularity of the Standard American Diet, composed of high levels of saturated fats and carbohydrates. A growing body of epidemiological data indicates a positive correlation between the occurrence of metabolic syndromes, such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, type-2 diabetes and associated hyperinsulemia, with the aggressiveness of cancer. Remarkably, it is estimated that for every 1% reduction in saturated fats, replaced by polyunsaturated, there would be a 2%-3% reduction in cardiovascular disease.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data from 222 men with low risk (LR) or intermediate risk (IR) prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at the New York Harbor VA between 2003 and 2011. Biochemical relapse, distant control, and prostate cancer-specific survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression modeling was performed to determine the impact of covariates on biochemical outcome.  Results:   Most patients (65.3 %) were AA. The median follow-up was 58 months, and 89.6 % of patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years after their surgery. Analyzing the whole cohort, the biochemical control was improved in Caucasian patients compared with AA (90.2 vs. 75.4 %, p = 0.008). On subgroup analysis, for IR disease, this difference was no longer significant, 80.5 % for Caucasians versus 69.8 % for AA (p = 0.36). However, for LR disease, the 5-year biochemical control remained significantly improved for Caucasians compared with AA, with a 5-year biochemical control of 97.6 versus 81.7 %, p = 0.006. On multivariate analysis, AA race was a significant predictor for biochemical recurrence (HR 2.69, 95 % CI 1.27-5.65, p = 0.009). There were no differences between the two groups regarding distant control (p = 0.14) or prostate cancer-specific survival (p = 0.29).

Objective:   To assess the ability of an oral selective estrogen receptor α agonist (GTx-758) to lower testosterone concentrations compared with leuprolide while minimizing estrogen deficiency-related side effects of androgen-deprivation therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Hormone-naive advanced prostate cancer patients were randomized to oral GTx-758 1000 mg/d, 2000 mg/d, or leuprolide depot.  Intervention:   GTx-758 and leuprolide.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving total testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dl by day 60. Secondary end points included serum free testosterone, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), sex hormone-binding globulin, hot flashes, bone turnover markers, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels.  Results and limitations:   Of 159 randomized patients, leuprolide reduced total testosterone to ≤ 50 ng/dl in a greater proportion of patients than GTx-758 by day 60 (43.4%, 63.6%, and 88.2% of subjects receiving GTx-758 1000 mg [p<0.001], GTx-758 2000 mg [p=0.004], and leuprolide, respectively). GTx-758 reduced free testosterone and PSA earlier and to a greater degree than leuprolide. GTx-758 led to fewer hot flashes, decreases in bone turnover markers, and alterations in IGF-1 compared with leuprolide. A higher incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) was seen with GTx-758 (4.1%) compared with leuprolide (0.0%).  Conclusions:   Although leuprolide reduced total testosterone to ≤ 50 ng/dl in a greater proportion of patients compared with GTx-758, GTx-758 was superior in lowering free testosterone and PSA. GTx-758 reduced estrogen deficiency side effects of hot flashes, bone loss, and insulin resistance but with a higher incidence of VTEs.  Patient summary:   This paper reports findings that leuprolide lowered total testosterone more than GTx-758 but that GTx-758 lowered free testosterone and prostate-specific antigen more than leuprolide.

Design, setting, and participants:   Between 1982 and 2012, 20 434 men underwent RP, and 15 565 men (76.2%) had available pathologic and survival data. A total of 4216 men with isolated EPE were subclassified into pT3aF (1869 men, 44%) and pT3aNF (2347 men, 56%).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Predictors of BRFS, PCSS, and OS were identified with multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Covariates included age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, body mass index, surgery year, Gleason score, and surgical margin status.  Results and limitations:   With a median follow-up of 9.0 yr (range: 1-27), 314 men died of PCa, with 1300 deaths from any cause. In a multivariate model, pT3aNF compared with pT3aF was an independent predictor of BRFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.62; p<0.001), but not of PCSS (HR: 1.38; 95% CI, 0.89-2.11; p=0.146) or OS (HR: 1.13; 95% CI, 0.94-1.36; p=0.197). Ten-year BRFS, PCSS, and OS for pT3aF and pT3aNF were 76% versus 59%, 98% versus 96%, and 95% versus 90%, respectively.  Conclusions:   In a large RP cohort, subclassification of EPE extent with the Epstein criteria improves correlation with BRFS. PCSS and OS in men with isolated EPE (pT3a) are excellent and are not significantly different between pT3aF and pT3aNF. The EPE extent should be subclassified to identify a subgroup of men with a higher risk of recurrence (pT3aNF) and to consider them for additional therapy.  Patient summary:   Subclassification of extraprostatic extension (EPE) with the Epstein criteria improves correlation with biochemical recurrence-free survival.

It is urgently necessary to develop novel therapeutics for CRPC. We previously generated Escherichia coli ampicillin secretion trap libraries of 2 prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and normal prostate. By comparing the E. coli ampicillin secretion trap libraries of CRPC cell lines with those of androgen-sensitive PCa cell lines and normal prostate, we focused on the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase of regenerating liver 1 (PRL1) gene and analyzed its expression and biological function.  Materials and methods:   The expression of PRL1 was examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in clinical PCa samples. The effects of PRL1 on PCa cells were evaluated by cell growth, migration, and invasion assays. To investigate the effect of PRL1 on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, PRL1 knockdown PC3 cells were examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses.  Results:   Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that PRL1 was expressed much more highly in PCa than in nonneoplastic prostate samples. High expression of PRL1 detected by immunohistochemistry correlated with poor prognosis after prostatectomy and combined androgen blockade therapy. Functional analysis indicated that PRL1 stimulated cell growth, migration, and invasion in PCa cell lines. Expression EGFR and matrix metalloproteinase 9 was reduced by knockdown of PRL1 in the PC3 cell line.  Conclusions:   PRL1 regulates expression of EGFR and modulates downstream targets.
