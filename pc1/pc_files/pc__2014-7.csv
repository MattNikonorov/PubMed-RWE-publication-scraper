Beside its role in cell adhesion, EpCAM acts as signalling molecule with tumour-promoting functions. Thus, EpCAM is part of the molecular network of oncogenic receptors and considered an interesting therapeutic target.  Methods:   Here, we thoroughly characterised EpCAM expression on mRNA and protein level in comprehensive tissue studies including non-cancerous prostate specimens, primary tumours of different grades and stages, metastatic lesions, and therapy-treated tumour specimens, as well as in prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   Epithelial cell adhesion molecule was overexpressed at mRNA and at protein level in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Altered EpCAM expression was an early event in prostate carcinogenesis with an upregulation in low-grade cancers and further induction in high-grade tumours and metastatic lesions. Interestingly, EpCAM was repressed upon induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) following chemotherapeutic treatment with docetaxel. Oppositely, re-induction of the epithelial phenotype through miRNAs miR-200c and miR-205, two inducers of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), led to re-induction of EpCAM in chemoresistant cells. Furthermore, we prove that EpCAM cleavage, the first step of EpCAM signalling takes place in prostate cancer cells but in contrast to other cancer entities, EpCAM has no measurable impact on the proliferative behaviour of prostate cells, in vitro.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, our data confirm that EpCAM overexpression is an early event during prostate cancer progression. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule displays a dynamic, heterogeneous expression and associates with epithelial cells rather than mesenchymal, chemoresistant cells along with processes of EMT and MET.""","""['P Massoner', 'T Thomm', 'B Mack', 'G Untergasser', 'A Martowicz', 'K Bobowski', 'H Klocker', 'O Gires', 'M Puhr']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition leads to docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer and is mediated by reduced expression of miR-200c and miR-205.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Notch-1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition consistent with cancer stem cell phenotype in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Circulating tumour cells: the evolving concept and the inadequacy of their enrichment by EpCAM-based methodology for basic and clinical cancer research.', 'EpCAM duality becomes this molecule in a new Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde tale.', 'Microfluidic-based prostate cancer model for investigating the secretion of prostate-specific antigen and microRNAs in vitro.', 'Efficacy of Bispecific Antibody Targeting EpCAM and CD3 for Immunotherapy in Ovarian Cancer Ascites: An Experimental Study.', 'Anti-Cancer Stem-Cell-Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) Expression Can Be Modulated via NFκB.']"""

We evaluate NTx potential prognostic role in PCa at diagnosis, when most of the patients have no overt bone involvement.  Methods:   Men with histologic diagnosis of PCa were included at diagnosis. Serum NTx was measured serially every 3 months up to two years by ELISA. Fifty-five PCa patients with a median age of 67 y (51-83 y) were included. Most (86%) had stage I; 4% stage II; 2% stage III and 10% stage IV disease.  Results:   At entry, median NTx was 14.65 nMBCE and it did not correlate with age, Gleason score or PSA, but we observed a significant direct correlation with stage (p=0.0094). With a median follow up of 23 months, serum NTx correlated significantly with biochemical recurrence (p=0.012), as did Gleason score (p=0.00056), stage (p=0.012) and PSA (p<0.0001). By multivariate analysis the only 2 independent variables significantly correlated with biochemical recurrence were PSA (p=0.046) and NTx (p=0.021).

A retrospective cohort study was performed using data from the Queensland Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to approximate the relative risk of being diagnosed with another primary cancer either following or prior to MCC. Patients with an eligible first primary MCC (n = 787) had more than double the expected number of subsequent primary cancers (SIR = 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.84-2.60; P<0.001).

Significantly increased bi-directional relative risks were found for melanoma, lip cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, myelodysplastic diseases, and cancer with unknown primary site. In addition, risks were elevated for female breast cancer and kidney cancer following a first primary MCC, and for subsequent MCCs following first primary colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or lymphoid leukemia.

Procedure:   30 first [(18)F]-FACBC-PET/CT images of 26 patients (68.1 ± 5.8 years) were analyzed. PET/CT findings were compared with PSA concentrations, with PSA doubling times (PDT), and with correlative imaging.  Results:   On 16 [(18)F]-FACBC (53.3%) scans, 58 metabolically active lesions were found. 12 (20.7%) lesions corresponding to the local relapse were found in prostate/prostate bed and seminal vesicles, 9 (15.5%) lesions were located in regional lymph nodes, 10 (17.2%) were located in distal lymph nodes, and 26 (44.8%) metabolically active lesions were found in the skeleton. In one case, focal uptake was found in the brain, confirmed further on MRI as meningioma. The mean S-PSA level in patients with positive [(18)F]-FACBC findings was 9.5 ± 16.9 μ g/L (0.54-69 μ g/L) and in patients with negative [(18)F]-FACBC findings was 1.96 ± 1.87 μ g/L (0.11-5.9 μ g/L), but the difference was not statistically significant. However, the PSA doubling time (PDT) in patients with positive findings was significantly shorter than PDT in patients with negative findings: 3.25 ± 2.09 months (0.3-6 months) versus 31.2 ± 22.02 months (8-84 months), P < 0.0001. There was a strong positive correlation between PSA value and number of metabolically active lesions (R = 0.74) and a negative correlation between PDT and number of metabolically active lesions (R = -0.56). There was a weak negative correlation between PDT and SUVmax⁡ (R = -0.30).

Whether these differences in isoform dependence arise from tissue specificity or from the nature of the oncogenic signal activating the PI3K pathway is important, given increasing interest in using isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors in cancer therapy. To approach this question, we studied the PI3K isoform dependence of our recently constructed prostate cancer model driven by MT. Since MT activates a number of signaling pathways, we first confirmed that the MT-driven prostate cancer model was actually dependent on PI3K. A newly generated transgenic prostate line expressing an MT allele (Y315F) known to be defective for PI3K binding displayed a markedly reduced ability to drive tumor formation. We next selectively ablated expression of either p110α or p110β in mice in which wild-type MT was expressed in the prostate. We found that tumor formation driven by MT was significantly delayed by the loss of p110α expression, while ablation of p110β had no effect. Since the tumor formation driven by MT is p110α dependent in the prostate as well as in the mammary gland, our data suggest that PI3K isoform dependence is driven by the mode of PI3K pathway activation rather than by tissue type.  Importance:   Middle T antigen (MT), the oncogene of polyomavirus, can drive tumor formation in a variety of cell types and tissues. Interestingly, MT has no intrinsic enzymatic activity but instead functions by binding and activating cellular signaling proteins. One of the most important of these is the lipid kinase PI3K, which was first studied in MT immunoprecipitates. Ubiquitously expressed PI3K comes in two major isoforms: p110α and p110β. Previous work in animal models showed that p110α was the key isoform in breast tumors driven by oncogenes, including MT and HER2, while p110β was key in prostate tumors driven by Pten loss. We asked the simple question of whether a prostate tumor driven by MT depends on p110α, which would suggest that the mode of activation determines p110 isoform dependence, or p110β, which would suggest that tissue type determines isoform dependence. The clear answer is that MT depends on p110α in both the prostate and breast.""","""['Tamara Utermark', 'Fabienne Schmit', 'Sang Hyun Lee', 'Xueliang Gao', 'Brian S Schaffhausen', 'Thomas M Roberts']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['The p110alpha isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is essential for polyomavirus middle T antigen-mediated transformation.', 'PI3K-p110α mediates resistance to HER2-targeted therapy in HER2+, PTEN-deficient breast cancers.', 'The p110α and p110β isoforms of PI3K play divergent roles in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis.', 'Class I Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase PIK3CA/p110α and PIK3CB/p110β Isoforms in Endometrial Cancer.', 'Should individual PI3 kinase isoforms be targeted in cancer?', 'PTEN regulated PI3K-p110 and AKT isoform plasticity controls metastatic prostate cancer progression.', 'Class I PI3K Biology.', 'Divergent Roles of PI3K Isoforms in PTEN-Deficient Glioblastomas.', 'PI3Kβ-A Versatile Transducer for GPCR, RTK, and Small GTPase Signaling.', 'Isoform-specific activities of the regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases - potentially novel therapeutic targets.']"""

The effect of ARBs on prostate cancer in experimental models compared with meta-analysis data from clinical trials is conflicting. Whereas this discrepancy might be due to the use of supratherapeutic doses of ARBs in cellular and animal models as compared with the clinical doses used in human trials, further investigation of the effects of clinical doses of ARBs on prostate cancer in experimental models is warranted. In the current study, we sought to determine the effects of candesartan on prostate cancer cellular function in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, and characterize the underlying mechanisms. Our analysis indicated that clinically relevant doses of candesartan significantly inhibited growth of PC3 cell tumor xenografts in mice. Interestingly, the same concentrations of candesartan actually promoted prostate cancer cellular function in vitro, through a modest but significant inhibition in apoptosis. Inhibition of tumor growth by candesartan was associated with a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in tumors and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, but normalization of tumor vasculature. Although candesartan did not impair PC3 cell viability, it inhibited endothelial-barrier disruption by tumor-derived factors. Furthermore, candesartan significantly inhibited expression of VEGF in PC3 and DU145 cell lines independent of angiotensin II type 2 receptor, but potentially via angiotensin II type 1 receptor inhibition. Our findings clearly demonstrate the therapeutic potential of candesartan for prostate cancer and establish a link between ARBs, VEGF expression, and prostate tumor angiogenesis.""","""['Ahmed Alhusban', 'Ahmad Al-Azayzih', 'Anna Goc', 'Fei Gao', 'Susan C Fagan', 'Payaningal R Somanath']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist as an angiogenic inhibitor in prostate cancer.', 'Effect of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist on tumor growth and angiogenesis in a xenograft model of human bladder cancer.', 'Candesartan attenuates angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma via downregulating AT1R/VEGF pathway.', 'Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan as an angiogenic inhibitor in a xenograft model of bladder cancer.', 'Candesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, inhibits pathological retinal neovascularization by downregulating VEGF receptor-2 expression.', 'Repurposed Drugs in Gastric Cancer.', 'Candesartan Does Not Activate PPARγ and Its Target Genes in Early Gestation Trophoblasts.', 'Candesartan induces tumor vascular normalization to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy in the therapeutic window.', 'Ramipril Alleviates Oxaliplatin-Induced Acute Pain Syndrome in Mice.', 'Inhibition of angiotensin II type 1 receptor by candesartan reduces tumor growth and ameliorates fibrosis in colorectal cancer.']"""

However, how SPOP mutations contribute to prostate cancer remains to be elucidated. SPOP acts as an adaptor protein of the CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and selectively recruits substrates for their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. DDIT3 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-responsive transcription factor playing an essential role in apoptotic execution pathways triggered by ER stress. Here, we identified DDIT3/CHOP as a bona fide substrate for the SPOP-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. SPOP recognizes a Ser/Thr-rich degron in the transactivation domain of DDIT3 and triggers DDIT3 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Objective:   To investigate associations of patient safety with the diffusion of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP) resulting from the development of the da Vinci robot.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cohort study of 401 325 patients in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample who underwent radical prostatectomy during MIRP diffusion between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2009.  Main outcomes and measures:   We used Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), which measure processes of care and surgical provider performance. We estimated the prevalence of MIRP among all prostatectomies and compared PSI incidence between MIRP and open radical prostatectomy in each year during the study. We also collected estimates of MIRP incidence attributed to the manufacturer of the da Vinci robot.  Results:   Patients who underwent MIRP were more likely to be white (P = .004), have fewer comorbidities (P = .02), and have undergone surgery in higher-income areas (P = .005). The incidence of MIRP was substantially lower than da Vinci manufacturer estimates. Rapid diffusion onset occurred in 2006, when MIRP accounted for 10.4% (95% CI, 10.2-10.7) of all radical prostatectomies in the United States. In 2005, MIRP was associated with an increased adjusted risk for any PSI (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7; P = .02) vs open radical prostatectomy. Stratification by hospital status demonstrated similar patterns: rapid diffusion onset among teaching hospitals occurred in 2006 (11.7%; 95% CI, 11.3-12.0), with an increased risk for PSI for MIRP in 2005 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-5.3; P = .004), and onset among nonteaching hospitals occurred in 2008 (27.1%; 95% CI, 26.6-27.7), with an increased but nonsignificant risk for PSI in 2007 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.8-5.2; P = .14).

CSCs have been identified in prostate cancer (PCa), one of the most diagnosed malignancies in men over the world, for which chemotherapy resistance is a major problem in the treatment of castration-resistant advanced stages. Molecular signatures, gene expression and functional features have been reported for PCa CSCs. Most data come from cell lines which may not represent the actual tumor. In the present work, a CSCs enriched population obtained from PCa explants was functionally characterized and analyzed for drug resistance. Tumorsphere cultures positive for ABCG2 transporter, CD133, CD44, cytokeratins 5 and 18 (CK5 and CK18) and negatives for androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) showed higher clonogenic capacity, holoclone-forming ability, colony-forming capacity in soft agar and lower proliferative and apoptotic rate than control adherent cell cultures. Furthermore, exposing tumorsphere cultures to ABCG2 substrate drugs resulted in a high survival rate compared with control PCa cells. This high drug resistance was decreased using a selective inhibitor of ABCG2. According to these results, tumorspheres from PCa explants showed a functional stem phenotype and a marked drug resistance, probably mediated by high expression of the ABCG2 transporter, which might be considered as a suitable therapeutic target for CSCs.""","""['Viviana Castillo', 'Rodrigo Valenzuela', 'Christian Huidobro', 'Hector R Contreras', 'Enrique A Castellon']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Tumorspheres derived from prostate cancer cells possess chemoresistant and cancer stem cell properties.', 'Steroidogenic enzymes and stem cell markers are upregulated during androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'Establishment and characterization of multi-drug resistant, prostate carcinoma-initiating stem-like cells from human prostate cancer cell lines 22RV1.', 'Multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy and xenobiotic protection mediated by the half ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2.', 'ABCG2: the key to chemoresistance in cancer stem cells?', 'Polysaccharides from Lentinus edodes prevent acquired drug resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer cells by decreasing the TGF-β1 secretion of cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'GD2+ cancer stem cells in triple-negative breast cancer: mechanisms of resistance to breast cancer therapies.', 'Molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'IR-Surviving NSCLC Cells Exhibit Different Patterns of Molecular and Cellular Reactions Relating to the Multifraction Irradiation Regimen and p53-Family Proteins Expression.']"""

Perioperative BT at oncologic surgery has been reported to be a potential risk factor for cancer recurrence and survival in several cancer entities. Current studies addressing the relationship between BT, blood loss and BCR-free survival in prostate cancer patients are controversial and include only series with fairly small patient cohorts.  Materials and methods:   The data of 11,723 patients who underwent RP between 01/1992 and 08/2011 were analyzed. Cox regression analysis, including preoperative PSA level, pT stage, lymph node status, Gleason score, margin status, blood loss, transfusion rate (allogeneic or autologous), tested the relationship between blood loss, transfusion and BCR-free, metastasis-free and overall survival. Additionally, propensity score-matching analysis was performed to adjust differences in tumor characteristics.  Results:   There was no statistically significant relationship between blood loss or BT and BCR-free, metastasis-free or overall survival. In multivariate analysis PSA level, pT stage, Gleason score, margin status and lymph node status were independent factors for a BCR (p < 0.0001). These results were identical after propensity score matching analysis, comparing patients with and without BT.  Conclusions:   This large-scale analysis revealed no correlation between blood loss, blood transfusion and oncological outcome in prostate cancer patients treated with RP.

In vivo xenograft studies indicated decreased tumor growth and decreased aurora B kinase activity in mice treated with low-dose AMG 900 and vorinostat compared to either agent alone.

Although it has been reported to double the positive yield, MRI-targeted biopsies continue to yield false negatives. Therefore, the authors propose to investigate how biopsy system needle delivery error affects the probability of sampling each tumor, by accounting for uncertainties due to guidance system error, image registration error, and irregular tumor shapes.  Methods:   T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, and diffusion-weighted prostate MRI and 3D TRUS images were obtained from 49 patients. A radiologist and radiology resident contoured 81 suspicious regions, yielding 3D tumor surfaces that were registered to the 3D TRUS images using an iterative closest point prostate surface-based method to yield 3D binary images of the suspicious regions in the TRUS context. The probabilityP of obtaining a sample of tumor tissue in one biopsy core was calculated by integrating a 3D Gaussian distribution over each suspicious region domain. Next, the authors performed an exhaustive search to determine the maximum root mean squared error (RMSE, in mm) of a biopsy system that gives P ≥ 95% for each tumor sample, and then repeated this procedure for equal-volume spheres corresponding to each tumor sample. Finally, the authors investigated the effect of probe-axis-direction error on measured tumor burden by studying the relationship between the error and estimated percentage of core involvement.  Results:   Given a 3.5 mm RMSE for contemporary fusion biopsy systems,P ≥ 95% for 21 out of 81 tumors. The authors determined that for a biopsy system with 3.5 mm RMSE, one cannot expect to sample tumors of approximately 1 cm(3) or smaller with 95% probability with only one biopsy core. The predicted maximum RMSE giving P ≥ 95% for each tumor was consistently greater when using spherical tumor shapes as opposed to no shape assumption. However, an assumption of spherical tumor shape for RMSE = 3.5 mm led to a mean overestimation of tumor sampling probabilities of 3%, implying that assuming spherical tumor shape may be reasonable for many prostate tumors. The authors also determined that a biopsy system would need to have a RMS needle delivery error of no more than 1.6 mm in order to sample 95% of tumors with one core. The authors' experiments also indicated that the effect of axial-direction error on the measured tumor burden was mitigated by the 18 mm core length at 3.5 mm RMSE.  Conclusions:   For biopsy systems with RMSE ≥ 3.5 mm, more than one biopsy core must be taken from the majority of tumors to achieveP ≥ 95%. These observations support the authors' perspective that some tumors of clinically significant sizes may require more than one biopsy attempt in order to be sampled during the first biopsy session. This motivates the authors' ongoing development of an approach to optimize biopsy plans with the aim of achieving a desired probability of obtaining a sample from each tumor, while minimizing the number of biopsies. Optimized planning of within-tumor targets for MRI-3D TRUS fusion biopsy could support earlier diagnosis of prostate cancer while it remains localized to the gland and curable.""","""['Peter R Martin', 'Derek W Cool', 'Cesare Romagnoli', 'Aaron Fenster', 'Aaron D Ward']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A comparison of prostate tumor targeting strategies using magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy.', 'Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Multiattribute probabilistic prostate elastic registration (MAPPER): application to fusion of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Beyond transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: available techniques and approaches.', 'Optimizing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy and detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: the role of core number and location.', '3D ultrasound guided navigation system with hybrid image fusion.', 'Comparison of biopsy strategies for prostate biopsy according to lesion size and PSA density in MRI-directed biopsy pathway.', 'A prospective analysis of robotic targeted MRI-US fusion prostate biopsy using the centroid targeting approach.', 'The Current State of MR Imaging-targeted Biopsy Techniques for Detection of Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, the large appearance and shape variations of the prostate in MR images make the segmentation problem difficult to solve. Traditional Active Shape/Appearance Model (ASM/AAM) has limited accuracy on this problem, since its basic assumption, i.e., both shape and appearance of the targeted organ follow Gaussian distributions, is invalid in prostate MR images. To this end, the authors propose a sparse dictionary learning method to model the image appearance in a nonparametric fashion and further integrate the appearance model into a deformable segmentation framework for prostate MR segmentation.  Methods:   To drive the deformable model for prostate segmentation, the authors propose nonparametric appearance and shape models. The nonparametric appearance model is based on a novel dictionary learning method, namely distributed discriminative dictionary (DDD) learning, which is able to capture fine distinctions in image appearance. To increase the differential power of traditional dictionary-based classification methods, the authors' DDD learning approach takes three strategies. First, two dictionaries for prostate and nonprostate tissues are built, respectively, using the discriminative features obtained from minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection. Second, linear discriminant analysis is employed as a linear classifier to boost the optimal separation between prostate and nonprostate tissues, based on the representation residuals from sparse representation. Third, to enhance the robustness of the authors' classification method, multiple local dictionaries are learned for local regions along the prostate boundary (each with small appearance variations), instead of learning one global classifier for the entire prostate. These discriminative dictionaries are located on different patches of the prostate surface and trained to adaptively capture the appearance in different prostate zones, thus achieving better local tissue differentiation. For each local region, multiple classifiers are trained based on the randomly selected samples and finally assembled by a specific fusion method. In addition to this nonparametric appearance model, a prostate shape model is learned from the shape statistics using a novel approach, sparse shape composition, which can model nonGaussian distributions of shape variation and regularize the 3D mesh deformation by constraining it within the observed shape subspace.  Results:   The proposed method has been evaluated on two datasets consisting of T2-weighted MR prostate images. For the first (internal) dataset, the classification effectiveness of the authors' improved dictionary learning has been validated by comparing it with three other variants of traditional dictionary learning methods. The experimental results show that the authors' method yields a Dice Ratio of 89.1% compared to the manual segmentation, which is more accurate than the three state-of-the-art MR prostate segmentation methods under comparison. For the second dataset, the MICCAI 2012 challenge dataset, the authors' proposed method yields a Dice Ratio of 87.4%, which also achieves better segmentation accuracy than other methods under comparison.  Conclusions:   A new magnetic resonance image prostate segmentation method is proposed based on the combination of deformable model and dictionary learning methods, which achieves more accurate segmentation performance on prostate T2 MR images.""","""['Yanrong Guo', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Yeqin Shao', 'True Price', 'Aytekin Oto', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['MR PROSTATE SEGMENTATION VIA DISTRIBUTED DISCRIMINATIVE DICTIONARY (DDD) LEARNING.', 'Automatic prostate MR image segmentation with sparse label propagation and domain-specific manifold regularization.', 'Deformable MR Prostate Segmentation via Deep Feature Learning and Sparse Patch Matching.', 'EG-Unet: Edge-Guided cascaded networks for automated frontal brain segmentation in MR images.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Automated Segmentation of Tissues Using CT and MRI: A Systematic Review.', 'Deeply supervised 3D fully convolutional networks with group dilated convolution for automatic MRI prostate segmentation.', 'Liver segmentation from CT images using a sparse priori statistical shape model (SP-SSM).', 'A supervoxel-based segmentation method for prostate MR images.', 'Superpixel-Based Segmentation for 3D Prostate MR Images.']"""

The prostatome combines a MRI based anatomic and a histology based disease atlas. Statistical imaging atlases allow for the integration of information across multiple scales and imaging modalities into a single canonical representation, in turn enabling a fused anatomical-disease representation which may facilitate the characterization of disease appearance relative to anatomic structures. While statistical atlases have been extensively developed and studied for the brain, approaches that have attempted to combine pathology and imaging data for study of prostate pathology are not extant. This works seeks to address this gap.  Methods:   The AnCoR framework optimizes a scoring function composed of two surface (prostate and central gland) misalignment measures and one intensity-based similarity term. This ensures the correct mapping of anatomic regions into the atlas, even when regional MRI intensities are inconsistent or highly variable between subjects. The framework allows for creation of an anatomic imaging and a disease atlas, while enabling their fusion into the anatomic imaging-disease atlas. The atlas presented here was constructed using 83 subjects with biopsy confirmed cancer who had pre-operative MRI (collected at two institutions) followed by radical prostatectomy. The imaging atlas results from mapping thein vivo MRI into the canonical space, while the anatomic regions serve as domain constraints. Elastic co-registration MRI and corresponding ex vivo histology provides ""ground truth"" mapping of cancer extent on in vivo imaging for 23 subjects.  Results:   AnCoR was evaluated relative to alternative construction strategies that use either MRI intensities or the prostate surface alone for registration. The AnCoR framework yielded a central gland Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 90%, and prostate DSC of 88%, while the misalignment of the urethra and verumontanum was found to be 3.45 mm, and 4.73 mm, respectively, which were measured to be significantly smaller compared to the alternative strategies. As might have been anticipated from our limited cohort of biopsy confirmed cancers, the disease atlas showed that most of the tumor extent was limited to the peripheral zone. Moreover, central gland tumors were typically larger in size, possibly because they are only discernible at a much later stage.  Conclusions:   The authors presented the AnCoR framework to explicitly model anatomic constraints for the construction of a fused anatomic imaging-disease atlas. The framework was applied to constructing a preliminary version of an anatomic-disease atlas of the prostate, the prostatome.

This paper describes the detailed software development and testing for three clinical TomoTherapy® cases: the prostate, lung, and head & neck.  Methods:   To obtain clinically relevant dose distributions, phase space files (PSFs) created from optimized radiation therapy treatment plan fluence maps were used as the input to ARCHERRT. Patient-specific phantoms were constructed from patient CT images. Batch simulations were employed to facilitate the time-consuming task of loading large PSFs, and to improve the estimation of statistical uncertainty. Furthermore, two different Woodcock tracking algorithms were implemented and their relative performance was compared. The dose curves of an Elekta accelerator PSF incident on a homogeneous water phantom were benchmarked against DOSXYZnrc. For each of the treatment cases, dose volume histograms and isodose maps were produced from ARCHERRT and the general-purpose code, GEANT4. The gamma index analysis was performed to evaluate the similarity of voxel doses obtained from these two codes. The hardware accelerators used in this study are one NVIDIA K20 GPU, one NVIDIA K40 GPU, and six NVIDIA M2090 GPUs. In addition, to make a fairer comparison of the CPU and GPU performance, a multithreaded CPU code was developed using OpenMP and tested on an Intel E5-2620 CPU.  Results:   For the water phantom, the depth dose curve and dose profiles from ARCHERRT agree well with DOSXYZnrc. For clinical cases, results from ARCHERRT are compared with those from GEANT4 and good agreement is observed. Gamma index test is performed for voxels whose dose is greater than 10% of maximum dose. For 2%/2mm criteria, the passing rates for the prostate, lung case, and head & neck cases are 99.7%, 98.5%, and 97.2%, respectively. Due to specific architecture of GPU, modified Woodcock tracking algorithm performed inferior to the original one. ARCHERRT achieves a fast speed for PSF-based dose calculations. With a single M2090 card, the simulations cost about 60, 50, 80 s for three cases, respectively, with the 1% statistical error in the PTV. Using the latest K40 card, the simulations are 1.7-1.8 times faster. More impressively, six M2090 cards could finish the simulations in 8.9-13.4 s. For comparison, the same simulations on Intel E5-2620 (12 hyperthreading) cost about 500-800 s.  Conclusions:   ARCHERRT was developed successfully to perform fast and accurate MC dose calculation for radiotherapy using PSFs and patient CT phantoms.""","""['Lin Su', 'Youming Yang', 'Bryan Bednarz', 'Edmond Sterpin', 'Xining Du', 'Tianyu Liu', 'Wei Ji', 'X George Xu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A GPU OpenCL based cross-platform Monte Carlo dose calculation engine (goMC).', 'A fast GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo engine for calculation of MLC-collimated electron fields.', 'New capabilities of the Monte Carlo dose engine ARCHER-RT: Clinical validation of the Varian TrueBeam machine for VMAT external beam radiotherapy.', 'Monte Carlo methods for device simulations in radiation therapy.', 'From model-based dose computation to tomotherapy.', 'Dosimetric comparison of deformable image registration and synthetic CT generation based on CBCT images for organs at risk in cervical cancer radiotherapy.', 'Treatment plan prescreening for patient-specific quality assurance measurements using independent Monte\xa0Carlo dose calculations.', 'Development and validation of an open source Monte Carlo dosimetry model for wide-beam CT scanners using Fluka.', 'Concurrent Monte Carlo transport and fluence optimization with fluence adjusting scalable transport Monte Carlo.', 'An exponential growth of computational phantom research in radiation protection, imaging, and radiotherapy: a review of the fifty-year history.']"""

Patients and methods:   Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from two cohorts with localised prostate cancer (1998-2012) undergoing AS. Prostate cancer-specific, metastasis-free and treatment-free survival, unfavourable disease and significant cancer at radical prostatectomy (RP) were compared for standard (<12 core, median 10) vs saturation (>12 core, median 16), and transrectal vs transperineal biopsy, using multivariate analysis.  Results:   In all, 650 men were included in the analysis with a median (mean) follow-up of 55 (67) months. Prostate cancer-specific, metastasis-free and biochemical recurrence-free survival were 100%, 100% and 99% respectively. Radical treatment-free survival at 5 and 10 years were 57% and 45% respectively (median time to treatment 7.5 years). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, saturation biopsy was associated with increased objective biopsy progression requiring treatment (log-rank P = 0.01). On multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, saturation biopsy (hazard ratio 1.68, P < 0.01) but not transperineal approach (P = 0.89) was associated with increased objective biopsy progression requiring treatment. On logistic regression analysis of 179 men who underwent RP for objective progression, transperineal biopsy was associated with lower likelihood of unfavourable RP pathology (odds ratio 0.42, P = 0.03) but saturation biopsy did not alter the likelihood (P = 0.25). Neither transperineal nor saturation biopsy altered the likelihood of significant vs insignificant cancer at RP (P = 0.19 and P = 0.41, respectively).  Conclusions:   AS achieved satisfactory oncological outcomes.

Upregulation of H19 in P69 and PC3 cells significantly increased the level of miR-675 and repressed cell migration; however, ectopic expression of H19 in M12 cells could not increase the level of miR-675 and therefore had no effect on cell migration. Furthermore, we found that the expression level of either H19 or miR-675 in P69 cells was negatively associated with the expression of transforming growth factor β induced protein (TGFBI), an extracellular matrix protein involved in cancer metastasis. Dual luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-675 directly bound with 3'UTR of TGFBI mRNA to repress its translation.

These changes lead to the activation or overexpression of key survival pathways that also serve as potential therapeutic targets. Despite promising preclinical results, molecular targeted therapies aimed at such signaling pathways have so far been dismal. In the present study, we used a PTEN-deficient mouse model of prostate cancer to show that plasticity in castration-resistant tumors promotes therapeutic escape. Unlike castration-naïve tumors which depend on androgen receptor and PI3K/AKT signal activation for growth and survival, castration-resistant tumors undergo phenotypic plasticity leading to increased intratumoral heterogeneity. These tumors attain highly heterogeneous phenotypes that are characterized by cancer cells relying on alternate signal transduction pathways for growth and survival, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, and losing their dependence on PI3K signaling. These features thus enabled castration-resistant tumors to become insensitive to the therapeutic effects of PI3K/AKT targeted therapy. Overall, our findings provide evidence that androgen deprivation drives phenotypic plasticity in prostate cancer cells and implicate it as a crucial contributor to therapeutic resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, incorporating intratumoral heterogeneity in a dynamic tumor model as a part of preclinical efficacy determination could improve prediction for response and provide better rationale for the development of more effective therapies.""","""['Marco A De Velasco', 'Motoyoshi Tanaka', 'Yutaka Yamamoto', 'Yuji Hatanaka', 'Hiroyuki Koike', 'Kazuto Nishio', 'Kazuhiro Yoshikawa', 'Hirotsugu Uemura']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['A rare castration-resistant progenitor cell population is highly enriched in Pten-null prostate tumours.', 'High Efficacy of Combination Therapy Using PI3K/AKT Inhibitors with Androgen Deprivation in Prostate Cancer Preclinical Models.', 'HDAC inhibition impedes epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity and suppresses metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Context-Specific Efficacy of Apalutamide Therapy in Preclinical Models of Pten-Deficient Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting castration-resistant prostate cancer with androgen receptor antisense oligonucleotide therapy.', 'Transcription factors Brn-3α and TRIM16 in cancers, association with hormone reception.', 'The Role of Castration-Resistant Bmi1+Sox2+ Cells in Driving Recurrence in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Interaction of the Metallo-Glycopeptide Anti-Tumour Drug Bleomycin with DNA.']"""

Results:   Overall health trajectories declined dramatically within one-year of cancer diagnosis. Lung, breast, and colorectal cancer were associated with a significant decreased overall health score (β) compared to the cancer-free group (survivorship model: lung-7.00, breast-3.97, colorectal-2.12; cohort model: lung-7.63, breast-5.07, colorectal-2.30). Other predictors of decreased overall health score included low education, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and age.  Conclusions:   All incident cancer groups had declines in overall health during the first year post-diagnosis, which could be due to cancer diagnosis or intensive treatments. Targeting factors related to overall health declines could improve health outcomes for cancer patients.""","""['Jessica L Petrick', 'Randi E Foraker', 'Anna M Kucharska-Newton', 'Bryce B Reeve', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Sally C Stearns', 'Xuesong Han', 'B Gwen Windham', 'Debra E Irwin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""[""Association of Prediagnostic Frailty, Change in Frailty Status, and Mortality After Cancer Diagnosis in the Women's Health Initiative."", 'Functional status declines among cancer survivors: trajectory and contributing factors.', 'Trends in the prevalence of malignancy among patients admitted with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Trajectories of fatigue in a population-based sample of older adult breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors: an analysis using the SEER-MHOS data resource.', 'Vitamin and mineral supplement use among US adults after cancer diagnosis: a systematic review.', 'Weight perception and self-rated health: are there differences between cancer survivors and non-cancer survivors?', 'Physical activity in older adults with metastatic gastrointestinal cancer: a pilot and feasibility study.', ""Association of Prediagnostic Frailty, Change in Frailty Status, and Mortality After Cancer Diagnosis in the Women's Health Initiative."", 'An exercise oncology clinical pathway: Screening and referral for personalized interventions.', 'Exercise is more effective than health education in reducing fatigue in fatigued cancer survivors.']"""

Methods and materials:   Participants were 140 patients with low or intermediate prostate cancer prospectively allocated to an IBCL seed group (n=74) or a loose seed group (n=66), using quasirandomization (allocated by week of the month). All patients underwent prostate brachytherapy using an interactive plan technique. Computed tomography and plain radiography were performed the next day and 1 month after brachytherapy. The primary endpoint was detection of a 5% difference in dose to 90% of prostate volume on postimplant computed tomography 1 month after treatment. Seed migration was defined as a seed position >1 cm from the cluster of other seeds on radiography. A seed dropped into the seminal vesicle was also defined as a migrated seed.  Results:   Dosimetric parameters including the primary endpoint did not differ significantly between groups, but seed migration rate was significantly lower in the IBCL seed group (0%) than in the loose seed group (55%; P<.001). Mean operation time was slightly but significantly longer in the IBCL seed group (57 min) than in the loose seed group (50 min; P<.001).

The presence and localisation of the alteration was confirmed by a second analysis by Next-Generation Sequencing.  Conclusions:   This finding suggests that CHEK2 mutations are heterogeneous and that techniques other than sequencing, such as MLPA, are needed to identify CHEK2 mutations.

TM4SF1 is an attractive cancer target because of its high expression in both tumor cells and on the vascular endothelial cells lining tumor blood vessels. We generated mouse monoclonal antibodies against human TM4SF1 in order to evaluate their therapeutic potential; 13 of the antibodies we generated reacted with extracellular loop-2 (EL2), TM4SF1's larger extracellular, lumen-facing domain. However, none of these antibodies reacted with mouse TM4SF1, likely because the EL2 of mouse TM4SF1 differs significantly from that of its human counterpart. Therefore, to test our antibodies in vivo, we employed an established model of engineered human vessels in which human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are incorporated into Matrigel plugs that are implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient nude mice. We modified the original protocol by (1) preculturing human ECFC on laminin, fibronectin, and collagen-coated plates, and (2) increasing the ECFC/MSC ratio. These modifications significantly increased the human vascular network in Matrigel implants. Two injections of one of our anti-TM4SF1 EL2 monoclonal antibodies, 8G4, effectively eliminated the human vascular component present in these plugs; they also abrogated human PC3 prostate cancer cells that were incorporated into the ECFC/MSC Matrigel mix. Together, these studies provide a mouse model for assessing tumor xenografts that are supplied by a human vascular network and demonstrate that anti-TM4SF1 antibodies such as 8G4 hold promise for cancer therapy.""","""['Chi-Iou Lin', 'Anne Merley', 'Tracey E Sciuto', 'Dan Li', 'Ann M Dvorak', 'Juan M Melero-Martin', 'Harold F Dvorak', 'Shou-Ching S Jaminet']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Angiogenesis""","""['Three Members of Transmembrane-4-Superfamily, TM4SF1, TM4SF4, and TM4SF5, as Emerging Anticancer Molecular Targets against Cancer Phenotypes and Chemoresistance.', 'Novel Anti-TM4SF1 Antibody-Drug Conjugates with Activity against Tumor Cells and Tumor Vasculature.', 'Lost miR-141 and upregulated TM4SF1 expressions associate with poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer: regulation of EMT and angiogenesis by miR-141 and TM4SF1 via AKT.', 'Intracellular distribution of TM4SF1 and internalization of TM4SF1-antibody complex in vascular endothelial cells.', 'Role of Transmembrane 4 L Six Family 1 in the Development and Progression of Cancer.', 'Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway in the Development and Progression of Colorectal Cancer.', 'TM4SF1 upregulates MYH9 to activate the NOTCH pathway to promote cancer stemness and lenvatinib resistance in HCC.', 'Three Members of Transmembrane-4-Superfamily, TM4SF1, TM4SF4, and TM4SF5, as Emerging Anticancer Molecular Targets against Cancer Phenotypes and Chemoresistance.', 'Long Noncoding RNA BCYRN1 Recruits BATF to Promote TM4SF1 Upregulation and Enhance HCC Cell Proliferation and Invasion.', 'TM4SF1 promotes EMT and cancer stemness via the Wnt/β-catenin/SOX2 pathway in colorectal cancer.']"""

Whole genome sequencing of primary PCa samples has identified recurrent gene deletions and rearrangements in PCa. Specifically, these molecular events disrupt the gene loci of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted-2 (MAGI2). In the present study, we analyzed the expression profile of MAGI2 gene in a cohort of clinical PCa (n = 45) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples (n = 36) as well as three PCa cell lines. We also studied the expression of PCa-related genes, including PTEN, NKX3.1, SPINK1, DD3, AMACR, ERG, and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in the same samples. The expression of MAGI2 mRNA was significantly down-regulated in PC3, LNCaP and DU-145 PCa cell lines (p = 0.000), and also in clinical tumor samples (Relative expression = 0.307, p = 0.002, [95 % CI 0.002-12.08]). The expression of PTEN, NKX3.1, SPINK1, DD3, and AMACR genes was significantly deregulated in prostate tumor samples (p range 0.000-0.044). A significant correlation was observed between MAGI2 and NKX3.1 expression in tumor samples (p = 0.006). Furthermore, the inclusion of MAGI2 in the gene panel improved the accuracy for discrimination between PCa and BPH samples with the sensitivity and specificity of 0.88 [CI 0.76-0.95] and 0.83 [CI 0.68-0.92], respectively.

Objective:   To address predictors of severe (Grade ≥3) late urinary toxicities (LGUTOX3) after postoperative irradiation.  Design, setting, and participants:   A single-institution cohort of 1176 patients treated between 1993 and 2010 with adjuvant or salvage RT was analyzed. A total of 929 patients underwent conventionally fractionated (CF) RT (1.8 Gy per fraction; median dose to the prostatic bed: 70.2 Gy) with nonconformal RT (n=169), three-dimensional conformal RT (n=657), or intensity-modulated RT (n=103) technique, while 247 patients received hypofractionated helical TomoTherapy (median: 2.50 Gy per fraction) at the following doses: 117 patients at 65.8 Gy (2.35 Gy in 28 fractions), 80 patients at a median of 71.4 Gy (2.5-2.6 Gy in 28 fractions), and 50 patients at 58 Gy in 20 fractions. Total doses were converted into 2 Gy-equivalent doses (EQD2) following the linear quadratic model taking α/β=5.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models tested the relationship between clinicodosimetric variables and the risk of LGUTOX3 retrospectively, graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0.  Results and limitations:   After a median follow-up of 98 mo, the 5-yr risk of LGUTOX3 was 6.9% and 18.1% in the CF and hypofractionated cohorts, respectively. At univariable analysis, the risk of LGUTOX3 was predicted by dose per fraction (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.96), acute Grade ≥2 toxicity (HR: 2.37), EQD2, pT4, and year of irradiation. At multivariable analyses, acute Grade ≥2 toxicity and dose per fraction independently predicted LGUTOX3 in the population, while an interaction analysis indicated a predictive role of hypertension in the hypofractionated cohort only. These findings are limited by their retrospective nature.  Conclusions:   In the postprostatectomy setting, the logistic convenience of hypofractionation should be carefully balanced against the risk of severe late urinary sequelae.

However, concerns may exist regarding differences in RP outcomes with resident involvement. Our objective was therefore to evaluate whether resident involvement affects complications, operative time, or length of stay (LOS) following RP.  Methods:   Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2005-2011), we identified patients who underwent RP, stratified them by resident presence or absence during surgery, and compared hospital LOS, operative time, and postoperative complications using bivariable and multivariable analyses. A secondary analysis comparing outcomes of interest across postgraduate year (PGY) levels was also performed.  Results:   A total of 5,087 patients who underwent RPs were identified, in which residents participated in 56%, during the study period. After controlling for potential confounders, resident present and absent groups were similar in 30-day mortality (0.0 vs. 0.2%, p = 0.08), serious morbidity (1.8 vs. 2.1%, p = 0.33), and overall morbidity (5.1 vs. 5.4%, p = 0.70). While resident involvement did not affect LOS, operative time was longer when residents were present (median 208 vs. 183 min, p < 0.001). Similar findings were noted when assessing individual PGY levels.  Conclusions:   Regardless of PGY level, resident involvement in RPs appears safe and does not appear to affect postoperative complications or LOS. While resident involvement in RPs does result in longer operative times, this is necessary for the learning process.""","""['Daniel T McMillan', 'Anthony J Viera', 'Jonathan Matthews', 'Mathew C Raynor', 'Michael E Woods', 'Raj S Pruthi', 'Eric M Wallen', 'Matthew E Nielsen', 'Angela B Smith']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Single- versus dual-console robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: impact on intraoperative and postoperative outcomes in a teaching institution.', 'Outcomes of minimally invasive abdominal sacrocolpopexy with resident operative involvement.', 'Impact of Urology Resident Involvement on intraoperative, Long-Term Oncologic and Functional Outcomes of Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Critical comparative analysis between open, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: perioperative morbidity and oncological results (Part I).', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Seniority of the assistant surgeon and perioperative outcomes in robotic-assisted proctectomy for rectal cancer.', 'Resident Participation is Not Associated With Worse Outcomes After TKA.', 'The role of the assistant during robot-assisted partial nephrectomy: does experience matter?']"""

Methods:   Clinical and pathological data of 1,179 patients managed with radical prostatectomy for a biopsy GS ≤ 6, clinical stage ≤ T2b and preoperative PSA ≤ 20 ng/ml PCa were collected. The population study was randomly split into a development (n = 822) and a validation (n = 357) cohort. A prognostic score was established using the independent factors related to GS upgrading identified in multivariate analysis. The cutoff value derived from the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the score.  Results:   After RP, the rate of GS upgrading was 56.7%. In multivariate analysis, length of cancer per core > 5 mm (OR 2.938; p < 0.001), PSA level > 15 ng/ml (OR 2.365; p = 0.01), age > 70 (OR 1.746; p = 0.016), number of biopsy cores > 12 (OR 0.696; p = 0.041) and prostate weight > 50 g (OR 0.656; CI; p < 0.007) were independent predictive factors of GS upgrading.

The aim of this study was to determine the degree of implementation of the interdisciplinary S3 guideline on diagnostics and treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   A questionnaire containing questions regarding the implementation of the S3 guideline was sent to 119 private practice urologists and 37 urologists working in hospitals. Comparisons were made with the χ(2) test.  Results:   The response rate was 63%. Of the responding urologists, 93% reported that they used the guideline in the daily practice, while 95% considered the strong recommendations of the guideline as treatment standard. Urologists working in a hospital recommended the guideline less frequently to their patients as source of information (30 versus 58%, p = 0.0283), but more frequently to other physicians (95 versus 72%, p = 0.0294), than private practice urologists did.  Conclusion:   The interdisciplinary S3 guideline on diagnostics and treatment of prostate cancer is used by the vast majority of urologists in their daily practice.

Here, we identify using a genomic shRNA screen the PI3K/AKT-inactivating downstream target, FOXO4, as a potential CaP metastasis suppressor. FOXO4 protein levels inversely correlate with the invasive potential of a panel of human CaP cell lines, with decreased mRNA levels correlating with increased incidence of clinical metastasis. Knockdown (KD) of FOXO4 in human LNCaP cells causes increased invasion in vitro and lymph node (LN) metastasis in vivo without affecting indices of proliferation or apoptosis. Increased Matrigel invasiveness was found by KD of FOXO1 but not FOXO3. Comparison of differentially expressed genes affected by FOXO4-KD in LNCaP cells in culture, in primary tumors and in LN metastases identified a panel of upregulated genes, including PIP, CAMK2N1, PLA2G16 and PGC, which, if knocked down by siRNA, could decrease the increased invasiveness associated with FOXO4 deficiency. Although only some of these genes encode FOXO promoter binding sites, they are all RUNX2-inducible, and RUNX2 binding to the PIP promoter is increased in FOXO4-KD cells. Indeed, the forced expression of FOXO4 reversed the increased invasiveness of LNCaP/shFOXO4 cells; the forced expression of FOXO4 did not alter RUNX2 protein levels, yet it decreased RUNX2 binding to the PIP promoter, resulting in PIP downregulation. Finally, there was a correlation between FOXO4, but not FOXO1 or FOXO3, downregulation and decreased metastasis-free survival in human CaP patients. Our data strongly suggest that increased PI3K/AKT-mediated metastatic invasiveness in CaP is associated with FOXO4 loss, and that mechanisms to induce FOXO4 re-expression might suppress CaP metastatic aggressiveness.""","""['Bing Su', 'Lingqiu Gao', 'Catherine Baranowski', 'Bryan Gillard', 'Jianmin Wang', 'Ryan Ransom', 'Hyun-Kyung Ko', 'Irwin H Gelman']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['GABARAPL1 suppresses metastasis by counteracting PI3K/Akt pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'In vitro and in vivo prostate cancer metastasis and chemoresistance can be modulated by expression of either CD44 or CD147.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Forkhead box O4 transcription factor in human neoplasms: Cannot afford to lose the novel suppressor.', 'Downregulation of CAMK2N1 due to DNA Hypermethylation Mediated by DNMT1 that Promotes the Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'circPDE5A regulates prostate cancer metastasis via controlling WTAP-dependent N6-methyladenisine methylation of EIF3C mRNA.', 'Low Tumor-to-Stroma Ratio Reflects Protective Role of Stroma against Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Role of FoxO transcription factors in aging and age-related metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.']"""

However, number of years of life lost (YLL) may be a more appropriate indicator of impact on society. Here we have calculated the YLL of adult cancers in Norway for the year 2012, as well as for the previous 15-year period.  Methods:   Data on age composition, expected remaining years of life, total numbers of deaths and deaths due to cancer were retrieved from the National Census Agency Statistics Norway. YLL were calculated for both sexes aged 25-99 years based on each individual's age at death, and the expected remaining years of life at that age.  Results:   Cancer deaths represented 25.8% of all adult deaths in 2012, with a lower fraction of females (28.7% in men and 23.1% in women), whereas cancer represented 35.2% of all YLL, with a higher fraction of females (32.8% in men and 37.8% in women). Females loose on average more life years to cancer than men (14.9 vs 12.7 years). Average YLL varied from 23.7 (cervical cancer) to 7.9 (prostate cancer). Lung cancer caused almost as many YLL alone (22.1% of cancer-caused YLL) as colon, prostate and breast cancer combined (23.1%). From 1997 to 2012, cancer-caused YLL as a fraction of all YLL increased from 32.5% to 35.2%, but with major differences among diagnoses.

Our objective was to produce broccoli with enhanced levels of indole glucosinolates and determine its impact on prostate carcinogenesis. Brassica oleracea var. Green Magic was treated with a 250 μM MeJA solution 4 days prior to harvest. MeJA-treated broccoli had significantly increased levels of glucobrassicin, neoglucobrassicin, and gluconasturtiin (P < .05). Male transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice (n = 99) were randomized into three diet groups at 5-7 weeks of age: AIN-93G control, 10% standard broccoli powder, or 10% MeJA broccoli powder. Diets were fed throughout the study until termination at 20 weeks of age. Hepatic CYP1A was induced with MeJA broccoli powder feeding, indicating biological activity of the indole glucosinolates. Following ∼ 15 weeks on diets, neither of the broccoli treatments significantly altered genitourinary tract weight, pathologic score, or metastasis incidence, indicating that broccoli powder at 10% of the diet was ineffective at reducing prostate carcinogenesis in the TRAMP model.

We used logistic regression to examine associations between HIV status and cancer treatment, adjusted for cancer stage and demographic covariates.

We identified predictors of cancer treatment among individuals with both HIV and cancer.  Results:   We evaluated 3,045 HIV-infected patients with cancer and 1,087,648 patients with cancer without HIV infection. A significantly higher proportion of HIV-infected individuals did not receive cancer treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.67; 95% CI, 1.41 to 1.99), lung cancer (aOR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.80 to 2.64), Hodgkin's lymphoma (aOR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.37), prostate cancer (aOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.31 to 2.46), and colorectal cancer (aOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.38 to 3.72).

A high number of new innovative technologies to improve methods for detecting CTCs, with extraordinarily high sensitivity, have recently been presented. The identification and characterization of CTCs require extremely sensitive and specific methods that are able to isolate CTCs with the possibility of cultivation and downstream analysis of in vitro culture of separated CTCs. In this original research paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to isolate human CTCs from a patient with prostate cancer, with subsequent cultivation and proliferation in vitro. We show that the use of a filtration device implemented by MetaCell® can fulfil all the requirements mentioned above. Fifty-five patients with localized prostate cancer have so far been enrolled into the study. CTCs were detected in the blood samples of 28 (52%) out of the 55 patients. We report successful isolation of CTCs from patients with prostate cancer, capturing cells with a proliferative capacity in 18 (64.3%) out of the 28 CTC-positive patients. Direct correlation with Gleason score and T stage was not proven. The cells, captured by a size-based filtration approach, remain in a good state, unaffected by any antibodies or lysing solutions. During the filtration process, no interactions occurred between antibodies and antigens on the surface of CTCs. This biological interaction is specific for immunomagnetic methods.

In the present study, we investigated the synergistic interaction between NVP-BEZ235, a PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/mTOR dual inhibitor, and sunitinib, a TKI, in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells with docetaxel resistance. Prostate cancer cells with different sensitivities to hormones and docetaxel levels were exposed to escalating doses of NVP-BEZ235 alone and in combination with sunitinib. The synergy between NVP-BEZ235 and sunitinib was determined by the combination index, three-dimensional model, and clonogenic assays. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis of proteins related to apoptosis and cell survival axis were performed. The combination of NVP-BEZ235 and sunitinib caused a significant synergistic antitumor effect over a wide range of doses in docetaxel-resistant CRPC cells. Furthermore, the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of NVP-BEZ235 and sunitinib was reduced by 7.8-fold and 6.6-fold, respectively. The three-dimensional synergy analysis resulted in a synergy volume of 182.47 μM/ml2%, indicating a strong synergistic effect of combination therapy. Combination therapy caused an induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis in docetaxel-resistant CRPC cells. Adding sunitinib did not produce any additional effect on the NVP-BEZ235-mediated inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR phosphorylation.

Materials and methods:   Overall, 194 patients underwent TRUS biopsy, who were followed up in less than 18 months by means of (a) mp-MRI with pelvic phased array using T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences and (b) TPM biopsy. Of those patients, low risk on TRUS biopsy was defined in 4 different ways--(a) definition 1: Gleason 3+3 (any cancer core length) (n = 137), (b) definition 2: maximum cancer core length (MCCL)<50% (any Gleason score) (n = 62), (c) definition 3: Gleason 3+3 and MCCL<50% (n = 52), and (d) definition 4: Gleason 3+3, MCCL<50%, prostate-specific antigen level<10 ng/ml, and<50% positive cores (n = 28). Mp-MRI was scored for the likelihood of cancer from 1 (cancer very unlikely) to 5 (cancer very likely). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between MRI scores and TPM histology.  Results:   Median prostate-specific antigen level was 7 ng/ml (range: 0.9-29), median time between TRUS biopsy and mp-MRI was 120 days (range: 41-480), and median time between mp-MRI and TPM biopsy was 60 days (range: 1-420). A median of 48 cores (range: 20-118) were taken at TPM biopsy. Gleason score was upgraded in 62 of 137 (45%) patients at TPM biopsy. The negative predictive values of mp-MRI score 1 to 2 for predicting that cancer remained low risk (according to each definition) were 75%, 100%, 83%, and 100% for definitions 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. An mp-MRI score of 4 to 5 had positive predictive values for upgrade or upsize of 59%, 67%, 75%, and 69% for definitions 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  Conclusion:   The presence of an mp-MRI lesion in men with low-risk prostate cancer on TRUS biopsy confers, in most patients, a high likelihood that higher-risk disease will be present (either Gleason pattern 4 or a significant cancer burden). Conversely, if a lesion is not seen on mp-MRI, the attribution of low-risk grade or cancer burden is much more likely to be correct.

Hence, AKR1C3 is a promising therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer, as combination of an AKR1C3 inhibitor and a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue may lead to complete androgen blockade. This study describes the preclinical characterisation of the novel AKR1C3 inhibitor ASP9521.  Methods:   The inhibitory effect of ASP9521 on AKR1C3-mediated conversion from AD into T was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo, using CWR22R xenografted mice. The effect of ASP9521 on PSA production and cell proliferation was tested using LNCaP cells stably expressing human AKR1C3 (LNCaP-AKR1C3). Pharmacokinetics of ASP9521 were studied in rats, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys.  Results:   ASP9521 inhibited conversion of AD into T by recombinant human or cynomolgus monkey AKR1C3 in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50,human: 11 nmol/L; IC50,monkey: 49 nmol/L). ASP9521 showed >100-fold selectivity for AKR1C3 over the isoform AKR1C2. In LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells, ASP9521 suppressed AD-dependent PSA production and cell proliferation. In CWR22R xenografts, single oral administration of ASP9521 (3 mg/kg) inhibited AD-induced intratumoural T production and this inhibitory effect was maintained for 24 h. After oral administration, ASP9521 was rapidly eliminated from plasma, while its intratumoural concentration remained high. The bioavailability of ASP9521 after oral administration (1 mg/kg) was 35 %, 78 % and 58 % in rats, dogs and monkeys, respectively.

Our genome-wide gene expression analyses reveal that the SUMOylation modulates the AR function in a target gene and pathway selective manner. The transcripts that are differentially regulated by androgen and SUMOylation are linked to cellular movement, cell death, cellular proliferation, cellular development and cell cycle. Fittingly, SUMOylation mutant AR cells proliferate faster and are more sensitive to apoptosis. Moreover, ChIP-seq analyses show that the SUMOylation can modulate the chromatin occupancy of AR on many loci in a fashion that parallels their differential androgen-regulated expression. De novo motif analyses reveal that FOXA1, C/EBP and AP-1 motifs are differentially enriched at the wtAR- and the AR-K386R,K520R-preferred genomic binding positions.

The exact function of YKL40 is poorly understood, but it has been shown to play an important role in promoting tumour angiogenesis and metastasis. The therapeutic value and biological function of YKL40 are unknown in PCa. The objective of this study was to examine the expression and function of YKL40 in PCa. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that YKL40 was highly expressed in metastatic PCa cells when compared with less invasive and normal prostate epithelial cell lines. In addition, the expression was primarily limited to androgen receptor-positive cell lines. Evaluation of YKL40 tissue expression in PCa patients showed a progressive increase in patients with aggressive disease when compared with those with less aggressive cancers and normal controls. Treatment of LNCaP and C4-2B cells with androgens increased YKL40 expression, whereas treatment with an anti-androgen agent decreased the gene expression of YKL40 in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Furthermore, knockdown of YKL40 significantly decreased invasion and migration of PCa cells, whereas overexpression rendered them more invasive and migratory, which was commensurate with an enhancement in the anchorage-independent growth of cells. To our knowledge, this study characterises the role of YKL40 for the first time in PCa. Together, these results suggest that YKL40 plays an important role in PCa progression and thus inhibition of YKL40 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Varinder Jeet', 'Gregor Tevz', 'Melanie Lehman', 'Brett Hollier', 'Colleen Nelson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Androgen Receptor Regulation of Local Growth Hormone in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Inhibition of Androgen Receptor Signaling Promotes Prostate Cancer Cell Migration via Upregulation of Annexin A1 Expression.', 'Anti-androgen receptor ASC-J9 versus anti-androgens MDV3100 (Enzalutamide) or Casodex (Bicalutamide) leads to opposite effects on prostate cancer metastasis via differential modulation of macrophage infiltration and STAT3-CCL2 signaling.', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor expression escapes androgen regulation in prostate cancer: a potential molecular switch for tumour growth.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'Upregulation of YKL-40 Promotes Metastatic Phenotype and Correlates with Poor Prognosis and Therapy Response in Patients with Colorectal Cancer.', 'Prognostic value of YKL-40 in colorectal carcinoma patients: A meta-analysis.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic value of serum Chitinase 3-like protein 1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Targeting protumor factor chitinase-3-like-1 secreted by Rab37 vesicles for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Macrophage Biology and Mechanisms of Immune Suppression in Breast Cancer.']"""

Two-dimensional AFM force spectroscopy was performed to characterize dual mechanical properties-the cell-substrate adhesion as well as the mechanical compliance. Interestingly, prostate cancer cells displayed a strong positive correlation between the cell-substrate adhesion and metastatic potential. However, there was no clearly observable correlation between the cell-substrate adhesion and the metastatic potential despite variations in mechanical compliance of breast cancer cells.

It is approved for treatment of metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer in patients pretreated with docetaxel. Objective responses have been observed in many other cancers, including pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Cabazitaxel and docetaxel share a high degree of structural similarity. The basis for cabazitaxel's efficacy is unclear, and its mechanism has not been described. We compared the effects of cabazitaxel and docetaxel on MCF7 human breast cancer cells expressing fluorescent tubulin. Both drugs inhibited cell proliferation (IC50s, cabazitaxel, 0.4 ± 0.1 nmol/L, docetaxel, 2.5 ± 0.5 nmol/L) and arrested cells in metaphase by inducing mitotic spindle abnormalities. Drug concentrations required for half-maximal mitotic arrest at 24 hours were similar (1.9 nmol/L cabazitaxel and 2.2 nmol/L docetaxel). Cabazitaxel suppressed microtubule dynamic instability significantly more potently than docetaxel. In particular, cabazitaxel (2 nmol/L) suppressed the microtubule shortening rate by 59% (compared with 49% for 2 nmol/L docetaxel), the growing rate by 33% (vs. 19%), and overall dynamicity by 83% (vs. 64%). Cabazitaxel was taken up into cells significantly faster than docetaxel, attaining an intracellular concentration of 25 μmol/L within 1 hour, compared with 10 hours for docetaxel. Importantly, after washing, the intracellular cabazitaxel concentration remained high, whereas the docetaxel concentration was significantly reduced. The data indicate that the potency of cabazitaxel in docetaxel-resistant tumors is due to stronger suppression of microtubule dynamics, faster drug uptake, and better intracellular retention than occurs with docetaxel.""","""['Olga Azarenko', 'Gregoriy Smiyun', 'Jeffrey Mah', 'Leslie Wilson', 'Mary Ann Jordan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['βIII-tubulin enhances efficacy of cabazitaxel as compared with docetaxel.', 'Preclinical antitumor activity of cabazitaxel, a semisynthetic taxane active in taxane-resistant tumors.', 'Mechanisms of resistance to cabazitaxel.', 'Preclinical profile of cabazitaxel.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Interpreting Image-based Profiles using Similarity Clustering and Single-Cell Visualization.', 'Medication-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw: a review of cases from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).', 'Quantification of Engagement of Microtubules by Small Molecules in Living Cells by Flow Cytometry.', 'Glioblastoma: Current Status, Emerging Targets, and Recent Advances.', 'Real-world evidence of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with cabazitaxel: comparison with the randomized clinical study CARD.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 458 consecutive patients who underwent HoLEP. Patients were classified into two groups: patients who received prostate biopsy prior to HoLEP (biopsy group, n = 174) and patients who did not (non-biopsy group, n = 284). The two groups were compared. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictive factors.  Results:   A total of 27 patients (5.9 %) were incidentally diagnosed with prostate cancer. The incidence of prostate cancer was not significantly different between the two groups (biopsy group vs. non-biopsy group: 6.9 vs. 5.3 %, p = 0.48). Using multivariate analysis, a hypoechoic lesion identified by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) was the only predictor of incidental prostate cancer (odds ratio 2.829; 95 % confidence interval 1.061-7.539; p = 0.038). In the biopsy group, there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics including prostate size, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, and TRUS findings, between patients with and without prostate cancer. However, in the non-biopsy group, a hypoechoic lesion was found more frequently in patients with prostate cancer (prostate cancer vs. benign prostatic hyperplasia: 20.0 vs. 3.3 %, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Prior negative prostate biopsy does not rule out the possibility of prostate cancer after HoLEP.

These bioinformatic predictions were confirmed in vitro as the inducible short hairpin RNA-mediated LASP1 knockdown impaired migration and proliferation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. By immunohistochemical staining and semi-quantitative image analysis of whole tissue sections we found an enhanced expression of LASP1 in primary PCa and lymph node metastases over benign prostatic hyperplasia. Strong cytosolic and nuclear LASP1 immunoreactivity correlated with PSA progression.

Simple logistic regression analysis of such data does not exploit the information available in the survival time, and statistical methods that model the sampling scheme may be more efficient. We derive likelihood equations that reflect the complex sampling scheme in unmatched and matched 'extreme' case-control designs.

Our proposed method resulted in hazard ratio estimates close to those obtained from the full cohort. The standard error estimates also performed well when compared with the empirical variance. In an application to a study investigating markers for lethal prostate cancer, an extreme case-control sample of lethal cases and the longest-surviving controls provided estimates of the effect of Gleason score in close agreement with analysis of all the data.

To help evaluate the potential impact of the ACA on prostate cancer care, we examined the associations between insurance coverage and prostate cancer outcomes among men <65 years old who are not yet eligible for Medicare.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program was used to identify 85 203 men aged <65 years diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2007 to 2010. Multivariable logistic regression modeled the association between insurance status and stage at presentation. Among men with high-risk disease, the associations between insurance status and receipt of definitive therapy, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality were determined using multivariable logistic, Fine and Gray competing-risks and Cox regression models, respectively.  Results:   Uninsured patients were more likely to be non-white and come from regions of rural residence, lower median household income and lower education level (P<0.001 for all cases). Insured men were less likely to present with metastatic disease (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20-0.27; P<0.001). Among men with high-risk disease, insured men were more likely to receive definitive treatment (AOR 2.29; 95% CI 1.81-2.89; P<0.001), and had decreased PCSM (adjusted hazard ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.31-0.98; P=0.04) and all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.60; 0.39-0.91; P=0.01).  Conclusions:   Insured men with prostate cancer are less likely to present with metastatic disease, more likely to be treated if they develop high-risk disease and are more likely to survive their cancer, suggesting that expanding health coverage under the ACA may significantly improve outcomes for men with prostate cancer who are not yet eligible for Medicare.""","""['B A Mahal', 'A A Aizer', 'D R Ziehr', 'A S Hyatt', 'C Lago-Hernandez', 'Y-W Chen', 'T K Choueiri', 'J C Hu', 'C J Sweeney', 'C J Beard', ""A V D'Amico"", 'N E Martin', 'Q-D Trinh', 'P L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Insurance status and disparities in disease presentation, treatment, and outcomes for men with germ cell tumors.', 'Health Insurance Affects Head and Neck Cancer Treatment Patterns and Outcomes.', 'Prostate cancer outcomes for men aged younger than 65 years with Medicaid versus private insurance.', 'Impact of Insurance Status on Radiation Treatment Modality Selection Among Potential Candidates for Prostate, Breast, or Gynecologic Brachytherapy.', 'The Relationship of Health Insurance and Mortality: Is Lack of Insurance Deadly?', 'The Uninsured are a Distinct Population in a Breast Cancer Cohort, with Unique Screening, Staging, and Outcomes.', 'Five-year survival of patients with late-stage prostate cancer: comparison of the Military Health System and the U.S. general population.', ""Radiologists' Contribution to Variation in Detecting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Men With Prostate MRI."", 'Empirical Analysis of Health Assessment Objective and Subjective Methods on the Determinants of Health.', 'Management of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer in the Real-World Setting in the United States.']"""

A number of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that confer small but cumulatively substantial risks of PC have been identified, opening the possibility for the use of SNPs in PC risk stratification for targeted screening and prevention in the future. The objective of this study was to explore the psychosocial impact of receiving information about genetic risk of PC. The participants were men who had a family history of PC and were enrolled in a screening study providing research genetic profiling alongside screening for PC. A combination of questionnaires and in-depth interviews were used. Questionnaires were completed by men at two time points: both before and after joining the study and going through the genetic profiling process. The interviews were completed after all study process were complete and were analysed using a framework analysis. In total 95 men completed both questionnaires and 26 men were interviewed. A number of issues facing men at risk of PC were identified. The results fell into two main categories: personal relevance and societal relevance. The strength of men's innate beliefs about their risk, shaped by genetic and environmental assumptions, outweigh the information provided by genetic testing. Men felt genetic profile results would have future use for accessing prostate screening, being aware of symptoms and in communicating with others. The findings reinforce the importance of providing contextual information alongside genetic profiling test results, and emphasises the importance of the counselling process in providing genetic risk information.

Studies have shown uroplakin II messenger RNA to be expressed in bladder cancer tissues and peripheral blood of patients with urothelial carcinoma. Little is known about the protein expression of uroplakin II in urothelial carcinoma, possibly because of the absence of a commercially available uroplakin II antibody. Pathologists have used the uroplakin III antibody (AU1) to identify tumors of urothelial origin; however, the use of AU1 is limited because of its poor sensitivity.  Objectives:   To evaluate a newly developed mouse monoclonal uroplakin II antibody (BC21) in urothelial carcinoma and to compare it with previously developed mouse monoclonal uroplakin III (BC17 and AU1).  Design:   Uroplakin II and III antibodies were optimized for staining using a horseradish peroxidase-polymer detection system and were visualized with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine.  Results:   BC21, BC17, and AU1 demonstrated sensitivities in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder of 79% (44 of 56), 55% (31 of 56) (P = .002), and 34% (19 of 56) (P < .001), respectively. Subsequently, the increased staining sensitivity and intensity of BC21, compared with BC17, was validated in a larger study (134 of 174; 77% and 94 of 174; 54%, respectively) (P < .001). BC21 was found to be highly specific when evaluated in various normal and neoplastic tissues, including prostatic and renal carcinomas.  Conclusions:   The mouse monoclonal uroplakin II antibody (BC21) demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity in urothelial carcinoma, compared with uroplakin III (BC17 and AU1), suggesting its advantages in the differential diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma and in the detection of tumors of unknown origin.""","""['Laura L Hoang', 'David E Tacha', 'Weimin Qi', 'Charlie Yu', 'Ryan E Bremer', 'Joseph Chu', 'Thomas S Haas', 'Liang Cheng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Arch Pathol Lab Med""","""['Uroplakin II is a more sensitive immunohistochemical marker than uroplakin III in urothelial carcinoma and its variants.', 'Urothelial umbrella cells of human ureter are heterogeneous with respect to their uroplakin composition: different degrees of urothelial maturity in ureter and bladder?', 'A combination of p40, GATA-3 and uroplakin II shows utility in the diagnosis and prognosis of muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma.', 'Immunohistochemical Pitfalls in Genitourinary Pathology: 2018 Update.', 'S100P as a Marker for Urothelial Histogenesis: A Critical Review and Comparison With Novel and Traditional Urothelial Immunohistochemical Markers.', 'Scoring Systems for Immunohistochemistry in Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'Comparison of Antibodies to Detect Uroplakin in Urothelial Carcinomas.', 'Comparison of RNAscope and immunohistochemistry for evaluation of the UPK2 status in urothelial carcinoma tissues.', 'Imaging of Fibroblast Activation Protein Alpha Expression in a Preclinical Mouse Model of Glioma Using Positron Emission Tomography.', 'An Algorithmic Immunohistochemical Approach to Define Tumor Type and Assign Site of Origin.']"""

Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) to evaluate prostate size and calculate PSA density can improve the specificity of PSA in predicting cancer. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of different pre-biopsy tests to detect prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Pre-biopsy data were collected from 521 men referred for biopsy from January-December 2011 and cancer aggressiveness data from 96 men who had radical prostatectomy. Model predictors included total PSA, DRE, the ratio of free to total PSA (PSAf/t), and PSA density. We used logistic regression and ROC curve analyses to compare the accuracy of different models to predict positive biopsy.  Results:   The area under the curve (AUC) for model A (PSA total, DRE, PSAf/t) was moderate, but significant (AUC = .59, p < .05); only PSAf/t was a significant independent predictor of positive biopsy (OR = .002, p < .05). In model B (PSAf/t and PSA density; AUC= .66, p < .05), PSA density was the only strong predictor (OR = 1067.93, p < .05). Both models had comparable sensitivity (74% versus 72%) but model B had greater specificity (44% versus 61%). PSA density was also a significant predictor of different indices of aggressive cancer.  Conclusions:   PSA density has discriminative predictive power for prostate cancer. It had similar sensitivity, but greater specificity compared to using PSA total, DRE and PSAf/t.

Materials and methods:   From our RP database of 2769 patients, we identified 41 men under AS who subsequently underwent RP. This study group was compared to control group A (164 patients who chose RP rather than AS), matched for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and initial diagnostic biopsy characteristics. With time, PSA and biopsy characteristics in the AS study group changed, prompting these men to undergo RP. These changes were matched to create a separate control group B (123 patients most of whom did not meet AS criteria). The incidence of nerve sparing surgery, pathologic features, and biochemical recurrence were compared. Outcome variables were compared using Chi-square tests of proportions. Fisher's Exact test was used for recurrence rates due to the low expected frequencies in some cells.  Results:   Compared with control group A, the AS patients experienced higher rates of Gleason score upgrading (33/41; 81.1% versus 76/164; 46.3%, p < 0.001), biochemical recurrence (5/41; 11.4% versus 2/164; 1.3%, p = 0.012) and lower rates of bilateral nerve sparing surgery (31/41; 75.6% versus 154/164; 93.9%, p < 0.001). Control group B and active surveillance group were comparable across all indices measured.

However, a significant percentage of patients with PSM never experience BCR. This study evaluated factors potentially affecting risk of BCR among the patients with PSM after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Materials and methods:   From a prospectively maintained database, 699 patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent a RARP without any adjuvant therapy were identified. Median follow up was 46.0 months. To determine the pathologic and clinical factors that influenced BCR, univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model were performed. BCR-free survival curves were estimated with Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Surgical margins were positive in 115 patients (16.5%), of whom 23 (20%) had BCR. In the univariate analyses, serum PSA level, surgical Gleason score (GS), and non-organ confined disease were significantly associated with BCR in men with PSM. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that BCR was significantly associated with PSA (p = 0.011), and the surgical GS (p = 0.008). In patients with lower PSA cutoff (5.3 ng/mL), GS ≤ 7, and organ-confined disease, there were no BCR.  Conclusions:   In this study, we identified favorable risk factors in patients with PSM following RARP. The results suggest that immediate adjuvant therapy for PSM may not be necessary in men with Gleason score 7 or less, organ-confined disease, and low preoperative PSA.""","""['Yun-Sok Ha', 'Dong Il Kang', 'Jeong Hyun Kim', 'Jae Young Joung', 'Jihyeong Yu', 'Jaspreet S Parihar', 'Amirali Hassanzadeh Salmasi', 'Shigeo Horie', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Recommendations for adjuvant post prostatectomy radiation.', 'Impact of margin status at 37 months after robot assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Short (≤ 1 mm) positive surgical margin and risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting oncologic outcome after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Materials and methods:   We identified 187 patients from 2005-2011 who underwent e-coil MRI with dynamic gadolinium-contrast enhancement followed by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostatic fossa biopsy for possible local prostate cancer recurrence. For analysis, local recurrence was defined as a negative evaluation for distant metastatic disease with a positive prostatic fossa biopsy, decreased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) following salvage radiation therapy, or increased lesion size on serial imaging.  Results:   Local recurrence was identified in 132 patients, with 124 (94%) detected on e-coil MRI. The median PSA was 0.59 ng/mL (range < 0.1-13.1), and median lesion size on MRI was 1 cm. The sensitivity of MRI was 91%, with a specificity of 45%. The positive predictive value was 85%, with a negative predictive value of 60%. For patients with a PSA < 0.4 ng/mL the sensitivity of e-coil MRI was 86%. When a lesion was identified on MRI, the positive biopsy rate was 65% and lesion size was a significant predictor of positive biopsies. The positive biopsy rates were 51%, 74%, and 88% when the lesion was < 1 cm, 1 cm-2 cm, or > 2 cm, respectively (p = 0.0006).  Conclusions:   E-coil MRI has a high level of sensitivity in identifying local recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy, even at low PSA levels.

Methods:   In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study, 30 prostate cancer survivors (age, 70.3 ± 7.7 yr; body mass, 80.5 ± 13.0 kg; mean ± SD) consumed 6.04 ± 0.16 mg·kg(-1) of anhydrous caffeine or a placebo 1 h before completing a battery of exercise capacity and functional performance tests. Testing sessions were separated by 3-4 wk. Immediate fatigue and perceived exertion were measured directly pre- and postexercise at both testing sessions.  Results:   Caffeine increased exercise capacity by 7.93 s (+3.0%; P = 0.010); however, postexercise fatigue and perception of exertion were comparable with the placebo session (P = 0.632 and P = 0.902, respectively). Increases in isometric grip strength trended toward significance in both dominant (+2.9%; P = 0.053) and nondominant (+2.1%; P = 0.061) hands in the caffeine trial compared with placebo. Caffeine ingestion did not result in improvements in performance for any of the remaining functional measures, including the timed up-and-go test, repeated chair stands, 6-m fast walk, and 6-m backward tandem walk. Systolic blood pressure and HR were significantly increased (P = 0.006 and P = 0.040, respectively) upon completion of the testing battery when compared with placebo.  Conclusions:   Consumption of caffeine 1 h before exercise induced improvements in exercise capacity and muscular strength in prostate cancer survivors. However, there was no change in exercise-related fatigue when compared with placebo despite reduction in timed performance of the 400-m walk. Caffeine seems to enhance exercise tolerance through improved performance with no subsequent increase in fatigue or perception of exertion and may be an appropriate strategy to promote exercise participation in prostate cancer survivors.""","""['Rahchell S Cornish', 'Kate A Bolam', 'Tina L Skinner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Sci Sports Exerc""","""['Acute caffeine ingestion enhances strength performance and reduces perceived exertion and muscle pain perception during resistance exercise.', 'The effects of different doses of caffeine on endurance cycling time trial performance.', 'Cortical substrates of the effects of caffeine and time-on-task on perception of effort.', 'Effects of caffeine ingestion on rating of perceived exertion during and after exercise: a meta-analysis.', 'Efficacy of acute caffeine ingestion for short-term high-intensity exercise performance: a systematic review.', 'Supplementation of caffeine and sodium bicarbonate together could not improve performance and performance-related factors in CrossFit participants: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.', 'Caffeine Supplementation Improves Anaerobic Performance and Neuromuscular Efficiency and Fatigue in Olympic-Level Boxers.', 'Dose-dependent effect of caffeine supplementation on judo-specific performance and training activity: a randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial.', 'Acute caffeine supplementation in combat sports: a systematic review.', 'Effects of β-alanine supplementation during a 5-week strength training program: a randomized, controlled study.']"""

One of the proposed mechanisms is a reduction in the use of systemic opioids that may cause immunosuppression. We used a retrospective matched cohort design to compare long-term oncologic outcomes after prostatectomy for cancer performed under general anesthesia with systemic opioids or with epidural anesthesia with epidural fentanyl analgesia. Since epidural fentanyl is quickly reabsorbed systemically, we hypothesized that there would be no difference in long-term oncological outcomes between the 2 groups.  Methods:   There were 486 men who underwent prostatectomy performed under epidural anesthesia between January 1, 1991, and January 31, 1996. They were 1:1 matched based on age (±5 years), surgical year (±1 year), and baseline prostate cancer pathology to patients who had general anesthesia with systemic opioids. Long-term cancer outcomes and all-cause mortality were examined. Analyses were performed using stratified proportional hazards regression models, with hazard ratios >1 indicating worse outcome for general anesthesia only compared with epidural anesthesia and fentanyl analgesia.  Results:   After adjusting for positive surgical margins and adjuvant therapies, patients in the general anesthesia group were found not to be at increased risk of prostate cancer recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-1.04], systemic tumor progression (HR = 0.92, 95% CI, 0.46-1.84), cancer-specific mortality (HR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.18-1.58), or overall mortality (HR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.93-1.63) when compared with patients who received epidural anesthesia.

Methods:   Preoperative prostate size estimated by TRUS and the weight of postoperative prostate specimens were collected from 440 men undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. Patients were grouped according to preoperative prostate size: <30, 30-60, 60-80, and ≥80 g. To evaluate accuracy, the mean absolute percentage of error was used. The mean percentage of error was used to indicate whether the estimation of TRUS had a tendency to overestimate or underestimate prostate size. The correlation between both measurements was analyzed for each size group.  Results:   Accuracy of TRUS estimation was associated with increased prostate size. TRUS estimation was more accurate for larger prostates. The mean absolute percentage of error of each group was 38.64% (<30 g), 21.33% (30-60 g), 13.23% (60-80 g), and 14.96% (≥80 g). Correlation followed a similar size-dependent trend, with a stronger r coefficient for larger prostates: 0.174 (<30 g), 0.327 (30-60 g), 0.457 (60-80 g), and 0.839 (≥80 g). Interestingly, smaller prostates were underestimated, whereas larger glands (≥80 g) had a tendency to be overestimated by TRUS.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates that the accuracy of the prolate ellipsoid formula for TRUS varies according to prostate size. Although this formula is fairly accurate for assessing larger prostates, it shows some limitations for smaller prostates.

The Bowery series was meant to answer important questions about prostate cancer's diagnosis, natural history, prevention, and treatment. While the Bowery series had little ultimate impact on practice, in part due to ethical problems, its means and goals were prescient. In the ensuing decades, technological tinkering catalyzed the transformation of prostate cancer attitudes and interventions in directions that the Bowery series' promoters had anticipated.

Over-expression of c-Myc has been observed in, and directly contributes to, a variety of human cancers including those of the hematopoietic system, lung, prostate and colon. To become transcriptionally active, c-Myc must first dimerize with Myc-associated factor X (Max) via its own bHLH-ZIP domain. A proven strategy towards the inhibition of c-Myc oncogenic activity is to interfere with the structural integrity of the c-Myc-Max heterodimer. The small molecule 10074-G5 is an inhibitor of c-Myc-Max dimerization (IC50 =146 μM) that operates by binding and stabilizing c-Myc in its monomeric form. We have identified a congener of 10074-G5, termed 3jc48-3 (methyl 4'-methyl-5-(7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-yl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-carboxylate), that is about five times as potent (IC50 =34 μM) at inhibiting c-Myc-Max dimerization as the parent compound. 3jc48-3 exhibited an approximate twofold selectivity for c-Myc-Max heterodimers over Max-Max homodimers, suggesting that its mode of action is through binding c-Myc. 3jc48-3 inhibited the proliferation of c-Myc-over-expressing HL60 and Daudi cells with single-digit micromolar IC50 values by causing growth arrest at the G0 /G1 phase. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that 3jc48-3 inhibits c-Myc-Max dimerization in cells, which was further substantiated by the specific silencing of a c-Myc-driven luciferase reporter gene. Finally, 3jc48-3's intracellular half-life was >17 h. Collectively, these data demonstrate 3jc48-3 to be one of the most potent, cellularly active and stable c-Myc inhibitors reported to date.""","""['Jay Chauhan#', 'Huabo Wang#', 'Jeremy L Yap', 'Philip E Sabato', 'Angela Hu', 'Edward V Prochownik', 'Steven Fletcher']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""ChemMedChem""","""[""3JC48-3 (methyl 4'-methyl-5-(7-nitrobenzoc1,2,5oxadiazol-4-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-3-carboxylate): a novel MYC/MAX dimerization inhibitor reduces prostate cancer growth."", 'In vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of 10074-G5, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of c-Myc/Max dimerization.', 'Design and properties of a Myc derivative that efficiently homodimerizes.', 'Small-molecule modulators of c-Myc/Max and Max/Max interactions.', 'Structural aspects of interactions within the Myc/Max/Mad network.', 'Demystifying the Druggability of the MYC Family of Oncogenes.', 'Targeting Transcription Factors in Cancer: From ""Undruggable"" to ""Druggable"".', 'Genetic and Histopathological Heterogeneity of Neuroblastoma and Precision Therapeutic Approaches for Extremely Unfavorable Histology Subgroups.', 'MYC: a multipurpose oncogene with prognostic and therapeutic implications in blood malignancies.', 'The long journey to bring a Myc inhibitor to the clinic.']"""

Since there are limited treatment options available for the advanced tumors, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic tools for PCa. Prostate secretion samples (PSS) from 23 PCa and 25 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients were obtained from Urology Department of Bagcilar Educational and Research Hospital (Istanbul). MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling of eight PSS (four from BPH, four from PCa patients) was performed using microarray. Four of significantly deregulated miRNAs were further confirmed using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test. ROC curves were plotted with SPSS-15.0. In this study, we aimed to identify a miRNA expression signature that could be used to distinguish PCa from BPH. MiRNA profiling of four PCa and four BPH patients with microarray revealed that miR-361-3p, miR-133b and miR-221 were significantly downregulated and miR-203 was upregulated in PSS of PCa patients. Further qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the altered expressions of these four miRNAs in PSS of 23 PCa and 25 BPH patients. Four miRNAs, together and individually have much power (AUC; 0.950) than PSA has (AUC; 0.463) to discriminate PCa from BPH patients. We have shown for the first time in the literature the presence of miRNAs in the PSS.

The aim of this study was to estimate their frequency and those of biopsy and newly diagnosed cancer (PCa) according to the presence or absence of treated benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Patients and methods:   This study concerned men 40 years and older covered by the main French national health insurance scheme (73 % of all men of this age). Data were collected from the national health insurance information system (SNIIRAM). This database comprehensively records all of the outpatient prescriptions and healthcare services reimbursed. This information are linked to data collected during hospitalisations.  Results:   The frequency of men without diagnosed PCa (10.9 millions) with at least one PSA test was very high in 2011 (men aged 40 years and older: 30 %, 70-74 years: 56 %, 85 years and older: 33 % and without HBP: 25 %, 41 % and 19 %). Men with treated BPH totalized 9 % of the study population, but 18 % of the men with at least one PSA test, 44 % of those with at least one prostate biopsy and 40 % of those with newly managed PCa. Over a 3-year period, excluding men with PCa, 88 % of men with BPH had at least one PSA test and 52 % had three or more PSA tests versus 52 % and 15 % for men without BPH. One year after PSA testing, men of 55-69 years with BPH more frequently underwent prostate biopsy than those without BPH (5.4 % vs 1.8 %) and presented PCa (1.9 % vs 0.9 %).

Materials and methods:   Within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, we conducted telephone interviews with prostate cancer survivors (N = 518) who were 5-10 years after diagnosis. We assessed demographic and clinical information, sexual, urinary, and bowel treatment-related side effects (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite), cancer-specific QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy--total score), and general QOL (the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12's physical and mental subscales).  Results:   Participants were aged 74.6 years on average, primarily White (88.4%), and married (81.7%). Pearson correlation coefficients between the 3 treatment-related side effect domains (urinary, sexual, and bowel) and QOL ranged between 0.14 and 0.42 (P <.0001). Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that poorer urinary and sexual functioning and greater bowel side effects were independently associated with poorer cancer-specific QOL (P <.0001). Bowel and urinary functions were also associated with poorer general QOL on the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12's physical component summary and mental component summary (P <.05). Bowel side effects demonstrated the strongest association with all QOL outcomes.  Conclusion:   Treatment-related side effects persisted for up to 10 years after diagnosis and continued to be associated with men's QOL.

Methods:   We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results to identify 128,189 men with localized intermediate- to high-risk PCa (prostate-specific antigen ≥10 ng/mL, Gleason score ≥7, or T stage ≥T2b) diagnosed from 2004 to 2010.

Results:   AA men were significantly less likely to receive curative-intent treatment than white men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.86; P <.001).

Our recent clinical tumor tissue staining results showed higher expression of TR4 in prostate cancer (PCa) patients with high Gleason scores compared to the tissues with the low Gleason scores. In vitro migration/invasion assays after manipulation of the TR4 expression in PCa cells showed that TR4 promoted PCa cells migration/invasion. Mechanism dissection found that the CCL2/CCR2 signal plays the key role in the mediation of TR4-promoted PCa cells migration/invasion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and Luciferase assays further confirmed TR4 modulation of CCL2 at the transcriptional level and addition of the CCR2 antagonist led to interruption of the TR4-enhanced PCa cells migration/invasion. Finally, the orthotopic xenografted mice studies using the luciferase expressing CWR22Rv1 cells found that TR4 enhanced PCa metastasis and this increased metastasis was reversed when the CCR2 antagonist was injected into the mice. Together, these in vitro and in vivo results revealed a positive role of TR4 in PCa metastasis and demonstrated CCL2/CCR2 signaling as an important mediator in exerting TR4 action.

Furthermore, urethral warmers have been associated with an increase of cancer recurrence rates. Here, we report results from our phantom-based investigation to determine the impact of a urethral warmer on temperature distributions around cryoneedles during cryosurgery. Cryoablation treatments were simulated in a tissue mimicking phantom containing a urethral warming catheter. Four different configurations of cryoneedles relative to urethral warming catheter were investigated. For each configuration, the freeze-thaw cycles were repeated with and without the urethral warming system activated. Temperature histories were recorded at various pre-arranged positions relative to the cryoneedles and urethral warming catheter. In all configurations, the urethral warming system was effective at maintaining sub-lethal temperatures at the simulated surface of the urethra. The warmer action, however, was additionally demonstrated to potentially negatively impact treatment lethality in the target zone by elevating minimal temperatures to sub-lethal levels. In all needle configurations, rates of freezing and thawing were not significantly affected by the use of the urethral warmer. The results indicate that the urethral warming system can protect urethral tissue during cryoablation therapy with cryoneedles placed as close as 5mm to the surface of the urethra. Using a urethral warming system and placing multiple cryoneedles within 1cm of each other delivers lethal cooling at least 5mm from the urethral surface while sparing urethral tissue.""","""['C P Favazza', 'K R Gorny', 'D M King', 'P J Rossman', 'J P Felmlee', 'D A Woodrum', 'L A Mynderse']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cryobiology""","""['Urethral warming catheter for use during cryoablation of the prostate.', 'Cryotherapy for the prostate: an in vitro and clinical study of two new developments; advanced cryoneedles and a temperature monitoring system.', 'The thermal effect of urethral warming during cryosurgery.', 'Cryoablation of renal and prostate tumors.', 'The evolution and state of modern technology for prostate cryosurgery.', 'Nerve Protection During Prostate Cryosurgery.', 'Dynamic Characterisation of Fibre-Optic Temperature Sensors for Physiological Monitoring.', 'Percutaneous MR-guided prostate cancer cryoablation technical updates and literature review.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided Prostate Ablation.', 'Magnetic Resonance Image-Guided Focal Prostate Ablation.']"""

We compared two previously validated post-RP classifiers-the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) and the Decipher genomic classifier (GC)-to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in a contemporary cohort of RP patients.  Objective:   To evaluate the combined prognostic ability of CAPRA-S and GC to predict CSM.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cohort of 1010 patients at high risk of recurrence after RP were treated at the Mayo Clinic between 2000 and 2006. High risk was defined by any of the following: preoperative prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/ml, pathologic Gleason score ≥8, or stage pT3b. A case-cohort random sample identified 225 patients (with cases defined as patients who experienced CSM), among whom CAPRA-S and GC could be determined for 185 patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The scores were evaluated individually and in combination using concordance index (c-index), decision curve analysis, reclassification, cumulative incidence, and Cox regression for the prediction of CSM.  Results and limitations:   Among 185 men, 28 experienced CSM. The c-indices for CAPRA-S and GC were 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.84) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87), respectively. GC showed higher net benefit on decision curve analysis, but a score combining CAPRA-S and GC did not improve the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve after optimism-adjusted bootstrapping. In 82 patients stratified to high risk based on CAPRA-S score ≥6, GC scores were likewise high risk for 33 patients, among whom 17 had CSM events. GC reclassified the remaining 49 men as low to intermediate risk; among these men, three CSM events were observed. In multivariable analysis, GC and CAPRA-S as continuous variables were independently prognostic of CSM, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.81 (p<0.001 per 0.1-unit change in score) and 1.36 (p=0.01 per 1-unit change in score). When categorized into risk groups, the multivariable HR for high CAPRA-S scores (≥6) was 2.36 (p=0.04) and was 11.26 (p<0.001) for high GC scores (≥0.6). For patients with both high GC and high CAPRA-S scores, the cumulative incidence of CSM was 45% at 10 yr. The study is limited by its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   Both GC and CAPRA-S were significant independent predictors of CSM. GC was shown to reclassify many men stratified to high risk based on CAPRA-S ≥6 alone. Patients with both high GC and high CAPRA-S risk scores were at markedly elevated post-RP risk for lethal prostate cancer. If validated prospectively, these findings suggest that integration of a genomic-clinical classifier may enable better identification of those post-RP patients who should be considered for more aggressive secondary therapies and clinical trials.  Patient summary:   The Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) and the Decipher genomic classifier (GC) were significant independent predictors of prostate cancer-specific mortality.

Patients and methods:   Eight hundred sixty-nine patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer at our institution between August 2004 and October 2011. Patient demographic characteristics were determined as follows: race and/or ethnicity, primary language, insurance type, age at diagnosis, marital status, income (determined by zip code), and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor stage. Fisher exact or Pearson χ(2) test was used to test for differences in categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors related to mortality recorded at the end of follow-up in March of 2012.  Results:   Mortality was significantly decreased in patients who spoke Haitian Creole (odds ratio [OR], 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.74; P = .017).

They regulate the transcription of estrogen-responsive genes and mediate numerous estrogen related diseases (i.e., fertility, osteoporosis, cancer, etc.). As such, ERs are potentially useful targets for developing therapies and diagnostic tools for hormonally responsive human breast cancers. In this work, two benzimidazole-based sulfonamides originally designed to reduce proliferation in prostate cancer, have been evaluated for their ability to modulate growth in estrogen dependent and independent cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231) using cell viability assays. The molecules reduced growth in MCF-7 cells, but differed in their impact on the growth of MDA-MB 231 cells. Although both molecules reduced estrogen response element (ERE) transcriptional activity in a dose dependent manner, the contrasting activity in the MDA-MB-231 cells seems to suggest that the molecules may act through alternate ER-mediated pathways. Further, the methyl analog showed modest selectivity for the ERβ receptor in an ER gene expression array panel, while the naphthyl analog did not significantly alter gene expression.

However, docetaxel-associated adverse events (AEs) such as febrile neutropenia (FN) can impair quality of life and may become life-threatening. In this study, we clarified the AEs and risk factors associated with FN in clinical settings.  Methods:   This study included 37 Japanese patients with CRPC who were treated with 70-75 mg/m(2) docetaxel and 10 mg prednisone every 3 or 4 weeks between 2008 and 2012. AEs, risk factors for FN, and the prognostic significance of several clinicopathological factors were analyzed.  Results:   Hematological AEs of ≥grade 3 included neutrocytopenia in 36 patients (97.3 %), leukopenia in 24 patients (64.9 %), lymphopenia in 10 patients (27.0 %), and FN in 4 patients (10.8 %). In addition, severe non-hematological AEs included colonic perforation, interstitial pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in 1 patient each. Severe lymphopenia was positively associated with the incidence of FN. Low serum albumin and low lymphocyte count were identified as possible pre-treatment risk factors, while severe lymphopenia was identified as a post-treatment risk factor.  Conclusions:   Non-hematological AEs as well as substantial hematological AEs were recognized in the Japanese population treated with docetaxel chemotherapy against CRPC. Pre- and post-treatment lymphopenia and pre-treatment serum albumin should be considered in order to minimize the risk of FN when selecting patients with prostate cancer for docetaxel therapy, and when considering dose modifications, and the prophylactic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.""","""['Masaki Shiota', 'Akira Yokomizo', 'Ario Takeuchi', 'Keijiro Kiyoshima', 'Junichi Inokuchi', 'Katsunori Tatsugami', 'Seiji Naito']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Does castration status affect docetaxel-related adverse events? :Identification of risk factors for docetaxel-related adverse events in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Incidence of febrile neutropenia in early stage breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant FEC-D treatment.', 'Predictive factors for severe and febrile neutropenia during docetaxel chemotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of long-acting granulocyte colony-stimulating factors for prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with cancer: a systematic review.', 'Primary prophylactic colony-stimulating factors for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in breast cancer patients.', 'Risk factors for severe neutropenia in pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel combination therapy.', 'Factors for the optimal selection of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor preparations and predictors for R-CHOP dose reductions/delays among patients with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (STOP FN in NHL 2 subanalysis).', 'Short-term outcomes of risk-adapted upfront docetaxel administration in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a multicenter prospective study in Japan.', 'Patient factors and their impact on neutropenic events: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Score of liver ultrasonography predicts treatment-related severe neutropenia and neutropenic fever in induction chemotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced head and neck cancer patients with normal serum transamines.']"""

Material and method:   We reviewed a series of patients with seminal vesicle involvement with clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1989 and 2009, focusing on their clinical-pathological characteristics, biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) and specific survival (SS). We assessed the variables that influenced BPFS and designed a risk model.  Results:   A total of 127 out of 1,132 patients who underwent surgery (11%) presented seminal vesicle invasion (i.e., pT3b). In the multivariate study of the entire series (Cox model), pT3b affects the BPFS (HR: 2; 95% CI: 1.4-3.3; P=.001). Other influential factors were the affected borders, initial prostate-specific antigen levels, pathological Gleason score and the presence of palpated tumor. The pT3b tumors have poorer clinical-pathological variables when compared with pT2 and pT3a tumors. Sixty-five percent of the patients evidenced biochemical progression. The BPFS was significantly poorer for pT3b (40 ± 4% and 28 ± 4% at 5 and 10 years, respectively) than for pT2 and pT3a (P<.0001). The SS was also poorer in patients with pT3b tumors (91 ± 2% and 76 ± 4% at 5 and 10 years, respectively) (P<.0001). The predictors within the pT3b patient group were: PSA levels >10 ng/mL (HR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.04-3.6; P=.04) and pathological Gleason score 8-10 (HR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.2-3.5; P=.03). We designed a risk model that accounts for the variables involved, which entails 2 groups with different BPFS (P=.004): Group 1 (0-1 variable), with a BPFS of 46 ± 7% and 27 ± 8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; and Group 2 (2 variables), with a BPFS of 14 ± 7% and 5 ± 5% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.  Conclusion:   Seminal vesicle involvement severely and negatively affects the BPFS and SS. We designed a risk model with the independent influential variables in BPFS (pathological Gleason score 8-10 and PSA levels >10 ng/mL). This model confirms that pT3b tumors are a heterogeneous group, which includes an important group with better prognosis when surgical treatment is performed.""","""['R Algarra', 'J Barba', 'I Merino', 'A Tienza', 'E Tolosa', 'J E Robles', 'J Zudaire']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Radical prostatectomy.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are an attractive option as advanced prostate cancers show a highly altered phosphotyrosine proteome. However, despite favorable initial clinical results, the combination of the TKI dasatinib with docetaxel did not result in improved patient survival for reasons that are not known in detail.  Methods:   The National Cancer Institute-Approved Oncology Drug Set II was used in a phenotypic drug screen to identify novel compounds with antineoplastic activity in prostate cancer cells. Validation experiments were carried out in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   We identified the TKI nilotinib as a novel compound with antineoplastic activity in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells. However, further analyses revealed that treatment with nilotinib was associated with a significant up-regulation of the phospho-extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK) survival signal. ERK blockade alone led to a significant antitumoral effect and enhanced the cytotoxicity of nilotinib when used in combination.  Conclusions:   Our findings underscore that TKIs, such as nilotinib, have antitumoral activity in prostate cancer cells but that survival signals, such as ERK up-regulation, may mitigate their effectiveness.

Objective:   To evaluate cancer control in men who underwent RARP at least 10 yr ago.  Design, setting, and participants:   From 2001 to 2003, we followed 483 consecutive men with localized prostate cancer who underwent RARP at a high-volume tertiary center.  Intervention:   RARP as first-line therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We calculated biochemical recurrence -free survival (BCRFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Actuarial rates were estimated via Kaplan-Meier. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify variables predictive of biochemical recurrence (BCR), receipt of salvage therapy, and metastases.  Results and limitations:   There were 108 patients with BCR at a median follow-up of 121 mo (interquartile range: 97-132). Actuarial BCRFS, MFS, and CSS rates at 10 yr were 73.1%, 97.5%, and 98.8%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, D'Amico risk groups or pathologic Gleason grade, stage, and margins were the strongest predictors of BCR depending on whether preoperative or postoperative variables were considered. The value of the detectable PSAs together with disease severity were independent predictors of receipt of salvage therapy, together with a persistent PSA for metastases.  Conclusions:   In contemporary patients with localized prostate cancer, RARP confers effective 10-yr cancer control. Disease severity and PSA measurements can be used to guide more personalized and cost-effective postoperative surveillance regimens.  Patient summary:   Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy confers effective 10-yr cancer control for men with localized disease, similar to the open approach. Recurrence is best predicted by postoperative disease severity. Persistent disease signals the risk of progression likely requiring early salvage treatment; lower postoperative risk warrants protracted surveillance beyond 5 yr from surgery, and those with higher risk may require follow-up beyond 10 yr.""","""['Mireya Diaz', 'James O Peabody', 'Victor Kapoor', 'Jesse Sammon', 'Craig G Rogers', 'Hans Stricker', 'Zhaoli Lane', 'Nilesh Gupta', 'Mahendra Bhandari', 'Mani Menon']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Oncologic Outcomes After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Large European Single-centre Cohort with Median 10-Year Follow-up.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes in patients with clinically high-risk prostate cancer treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from a multi-institutional study of 1100 patients.', 'Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', '15-year biochemical failure, metastasis, salvage therapy, and cancer-specific and overall survival rates in men treated with robotic radical prostatectomy for PSA-screen detected prostate cancer.', 'Saudi Urological Association consensus guidelines on the use of robotic surgery in urology.', 'MRI radiomics predicts progression-free survival in prostate cancer.', 'The RECOURSE Study: Long-term Oncologic Outcomes Associated With Robotically Assisted Minimally Invasive Procedures for Endometrial, Cervical, Colorectal, Lung, or Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Novel immune-related signature for risk stratification and prognosis in prostatic adenocarcinoma.']"""

Here, we investigate labelling of NKX3.1 in invasive ductal (IDC) and lobular (ILC) carcinomas of the breast with full characterisation of ER, progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR) and Her2 status.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays of 86 primary IDC and 37 ILC were labelled for NKX3.1. The IDC consisted of 20 luminal A, 7 luminal B, 14 Her2, and 45 triple negative carcinomas. The ILC consisted of 34 luminal A and 3 luminal B cases. NKX3.1 expression was scored as percentage nuclear labelling and labelling intensity.  Results:   Nuclear NKX3.1 labelling was seen in 2 IDC (2%) and 10 ILCs (27%). labelling intensity was weak in all cases (1–100% nuclear positivity). Positive NKX3.1 labelling was significantly associated with ILC (p<0.0001).

Methods:   In the training cohort, the NLR and other known prognostic variables were evaluated among a cohort of chemotherapy-naïve patients treated with thrice-weekly docetaxel at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Significant prognostic variables identified by univariable Cox regression were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Multivariable Cox regression was then used to derive a prognostic score where 1 risk point was assigned for each significant variable. The model was externally validated in a cohort of patients treated at the Royal Marsden.  Results:   Three hundred fifty-seven patients were analyzed in the training cohort. Median age was 71 years, 12% had liver metastasis, and median overall survival (OS) was 14.7 months.

Oncolytic viruses (OV) that have preferential replication capabilities in cancer cells rather than normal cells represent one promising alternative for treating malignant tumors. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus with the inherent capability to selectively kill tumor cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of VSV-ΔM51-GFP as an effective therapeutic agent for treating prostate tumors.  Methods:   For in vitro experiments, DU145 and PC3 cell lines were treated with VSV-ΔM51-GFP. Viral titers were quantified using plaque assays. Cytotoxicity was performed by MTT analysis. IFN-β production was measured using a Human IFN-β detection ELISA Kit. The detection of apoptosis was performed via Annexin-V-FITC staining method and analyzed with flow cytometry. The in vivo antitumor efficacy of VSV-ΔM51-GFP in a xenograft mice prostate tumor model.  Results:   It was observed that VSV-ΔM51-GFP can efficiently replicate and lyse human prostate cancer cells and that this virus has reduced toxicity against normal human prostate epithelial cells in vitro.

Furthermore, in a xenograft tumor animal model, nude mice bearing replication-competent VSV-ΔM51-GFP were able to eradicate malignant cells while leaving normal tissue relatively unaffected. The survival of the tumor-burdened animals treated with VSV-ΔM51-GFP may also be significantly prolonged compared to mock-infected animals.

This study included a total of 103 consecutive sexually active Japanese men with localized prostate cancer undergoing nerve-sparing RP, and analyzed the postoperative EF, focusing on the significance of penile rehabilitation. In this series, 24 and 79 patients underwent bilateral and unilateral nerve-sparing RPs, respectively, and 10 or 20 mg of vardenafil was administered to 35 patients at least once weekly, who agreed to undergo penile rehabilitation. Twelve months after RP, 48 (46.6%) of the 103 patients were judged to have recovered EF sufficient for sexual intercourse without any assistance. The proportion of patients who recovered EF in those undergoing penile rehabilitation (60.0%) was significantly greater than that in those without penile rehabilitation (38.2%). Of several parameters examined, the preoperative International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score and nerve-sparing procedure were significantly associated with the postoperative EF recovery rates in patients with and without management by penile rehabilitation, respectively. Furthermore, univariate analysis identified the preoperative IIEF-5 score, nerve-sparing procedure and penile rehabilitation as significant predictors of EF recovery, among which the preoperative IIEF-5 score and nerve-sparing procedure appeared to be independently associated with EF recovery. Considering these findings, despite the lack of independent significance, penile rehabilitation with low-dose vardenafil could exert a beneficial effect on EF recovery in Japanese men following nerve-sparing RP.""","""['Yuzo Nakano', 'Hideaki Miyake', 'Koji Chiba', 'Masato Fujisawa']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Increasing the dose of vardenafil on a daily basis does not improve erectile function after unilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Nightly vs on-demand sildenafil for penile rehabilitation after minimally invasive nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: results of a randomized double-blind trial with placebo.', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Vardenafil: a review of its use in erectile dysfunction.', 'Spotlight on vardenafil in erectile dysfunction.', 'Sexual dysfunction associated with prostate cancer treatment in Japanese men: a qualitative research.', '3D reconstruction and histopathological analyses on murine corporal body.', 'Repurposing erectile dysfunction drugs tadalafil and vardenafil to increase bone mass.', 'Functional recovery after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Significance of erection hardness score as a diagnostic tool to assess erectile function recovery in Japanese men after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Traditional screening and diagnostic methods include digital rectal examinations (DREs), biopsies and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests, with the latter being the more popular. PSA is a biomarker for prostate cancer; however, it is highly sensitive to external factors as well as other prostate diseases. As such, the reliability of of the serum PSA level as a sole screening and diagnostic tool for prostate cancer is controversial. Recently, it has been shown that fasting extremes can affect concentrations of serum chemistry analytes, thus raising the question of whether or not fasting has an effect on the highly sensitive PSA biomarker. Patients testing for serum PSA levels are often concomitantly submitting to other tests that require fasting, subjecting certain patients to a fasting PSA level while others not. The objective of this study was to investigate whether this discrepancy in fasting state translates into an effect on serum PSA levels. Serum PSA levels and fasting time records for 157 276 men who underwent testing at Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS; Calgary, Alberta, Canada) between 01 January 2010 and 31 March 2013 were accessed. Linear regression models of mean PSA levels and fasting times revealed a statistically important relationship at certain fasting times. Applying a dynamic mathematical model to explore the clinical effect of fasting suggests minimal impact on serum PSA result interpretation.

Here, we report a novel function of the master metabolic kinase AMPK in suppressing EMT by modulating the Akt-MDM2-Foxo3 signaling axis. This mechanistic link was supported by the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacologic activation of AMPK on epithelial and mesenchymal markers in established breast and prostate cancer cells. Exposure of cells to OSU-53, a novel allosteric AMPK activator, as well as metformin and AICAR, was sufficient to reverse their mesenchymal phenotype. These effects were abrogated by AMPK silencing. Phenotypic changes were mediated by Foxo3a activation, insofar as silencing or overexpressing Foxo3a mimicked the effects of AMPK silencing or OSU-53 treatment on EMT, respectively. Mechanistically, Foxo3a activation led to the transactivation of the E-cadherin gene and repression of genes encoding EMT-inducing transcription factors. OSU-53 activated Foxo3a through two Akt-dependent pathways, one at the level of nuclear localization by blocking Akt- and IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation, and a second at the level of protein stabilization via cytoplasmic sequestration of MDM2, an E3 ligase responsible for Foxo3a degradation. The suppressive effects of OSU-53 on EMT had therapeutic implications illustrated by its ability to block invasive phenotypes in vitro and metastatic properties in vivo. Overall, our work illuminates a mechanism of EMT regulation in cancer cells mediated by AMPK, along with preclinical evidence supporting a tractable therapeutic strategy to reverse mesenchymal phenotypes associated with invasion and metastasis.""","""['Chih-Chien Chou', 'Kuen-Haur Lee', 'I-Lu Lai', 'Dasheng Wang', 'Xiaokui Mo', 'Samuel K Kulp', 'Charles L Shapiro', 'Ching-Shih Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Correction: AMPK Reverses the Mesenchymal Phenotype of Cancer Cells by Targeting the Akt-MDM2-Foxo3a Signaling Axis.', 'Targeting energy metabolic and oncogenic signaling pathways in triple-negative breast cancer by a novel adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator.', 'Inhibition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition by E-cadherin up-regulation via repression of slug transcription and inhibition of E-cadherin degradation: dual role of scaffold/matrix attachment region-binding protein 1 (SMAR1) in breast cancer cells.', 'Paclitaxel suppresses the viability of breast tumor MCF7 cells through the regulation of EF1α and FOXO3a by AMPK signaling.', 'FOXO3a in cancer drug resistance.', 'Tumor Cell Glycolysis-At the Crossroad of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Autophagy.', 'Evaluation of the Potential Diagnostic Role of the Lnc-MIAT, miR-29a-3p, and FOXO3a ceRNA Networks as Noninvasive Circulatory Bioindicator in Ductal Carcinoma Breast Cancer.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer - microenvironmental roles of adipose tissue.', 'A combination of metformin and epigallocatechin gallate potentiates glioma chemotherapy in vivo.', 'Harnessing epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity to boost cancer immunotherapy.', 'Impact of AMPK on cervical carcinoma progression and metastasis.']"""

Results:   A total of 23 patients (arm A, 10; arm B, 13) were accrued. The main grade 3+ toxicities were hypertension, fatigue, decreased lymphocytes, and increased alanine transaminase. Owing to significant toxicity, the protocol was amended after the first 11 patients and the pazopanib starting dose was reduced to 600 mg daily. In arm A, of 9 evaluable patients, there was 1 patient (11%) with a PSA response, 3 (33%) with stable PSA, and 5 (56%) with PSA progression; in arm B, of 12 evaluable patients, there were 2 patients (17%) with PSA responses, 6 (50%) with stable PSA, and 4 (33%) with PSA progression. Median progression-free survival was similar in both arms at 7.3 months (95% CI, 2.5 months to not reached). Long-term stable disease was seen in 4 patients who remained on treatment for 18 months (arm A), 26 months (arm A), 35 months (arm B), and 52 months (arm B).  Conclusion:   In this unselected patient population, pazopanib either alone or in combination with bicalutamide failed to show sufficient activity to warrant further evaluation. However, 4 patients had long-term benefit, suggesting that targeting the VEGFR pathway may still be relevant in selected patients and emphasizing the need for improved predictive markers for patients with CRPC.""","""['Srikala S Sridhar', 'Anthony M Joshua', 'Richard Gregg', 'Christopher M Booth', 'Nevin Murray', 'Jovana Golubovic', 'Lisa Wang', 'Pamela Harris', 'Kim N Chi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['A randomized phase II efficacy and safety study of vandetanib (ZD6474) in combination with bicalutamide versus bicalutamide alone in patients with chemotherapy naïve castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Phase II trial of RAD001 and bicalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic Therapy with Panobinostat Combined with Bicalutamide Rechallenge in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Bicalutamide (Casodex) in the treatment of prostate cancer: history of clinical development.', 'Third-line hormonal therapy to treat prostate cancer relapse after initial and second-line hormonal therapy: report of 52 cases and literature review.', 'Recent advances in the molecular targeted drugs for prostate cancer.', 'Signaling Pathways That Control Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Bone Fracture Incidence After Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Investigational Agents: Results From Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program-Sponsored Early Phase Clinical Trials 2006-2013.', 'Screening of Drug Repositioning Candidates for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Pazopanib: Towards Optimized Dosing.']"""

We previously identified a Src-Tks5-Nck pathway which promotes invadopodium formation and ECM proteolysis in melanoma and breast cancer cells. We therefore sought to investigate the significance of Tks5 expression in human cancers. This was undertaken retrospectively through an immunohistochemical evaluation in tissue microarray cores and through data mining of the public database, Oncomine. Here we showed that Tks5 was expressed at higher levels in the microarray cores of breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer tissues compared to the levels in normal tissues. Importantly, mining of Oncomine datasets revealed a strong correlation between Tks5 mRNA overexpression in a number of cancers with increased metastatic events and a poorer prognosis. Collectively, these findings suggest a clinical association of Tks5 expression in human cancers. It identifies the importance for further investigations in examining the full potential of Tks5 as a relevant prognostic marker in a select number of cancers which may have implications for future targeted therapies.""","""['Stanley S Stylli', 'Rodney B Luwor', 'Andrew H Kaye', 'Stacey T T I', 'Christopher M Hovens', 'Peter Lock']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Nck adaptor proteins link Tks5 to invadopodia actin regulation and ECM degradation.', 'The SRC substrate Tks5, podosomes (invadopodia), and cancer cell invasion.', 'The adaptor protein Tks5/Fish is required for podosome formation and function, and for the protease-driven invasion of cancer cells.', 'The role and regulation of Rab40b-Tks5 complex during invadopodia formation and cancer cell invasion.', 'Advances in Understanding TKS4 and TKS5: Molecular Scaffolds Regulating Cellular Processes from Podosome and Invadopodium Formation to Differentiation and Tissue Homeostasis.', 'Tumour: Fibroblast Interactions Promote Invadopodia-Mediated Migration and Invasion in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Long noncoding RNA SH3PXD2A-AS1 promotes NSCLC proliferation and accelerates cell cycle progression by interacting with DHX9.', 'The clinicopathologic significance of Tks5 expression of peritoneal mesothelial cells in gastric cancer patients.', 'Prognostic value of SH3PXD2B (Tks4) in human hepatocellular carcinoma: a combined multi-omics and experimental study.', 'Key proteins of invadopodia are overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma suggesting an important role of MT1-MMP in the tumoral progression.']"""

Objective:   To examine the 5-yr outcomes of AS in a population-based setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   From the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden, we identified 11 726 men ≤70 yr diagnosed with very low-risk to intermediate-risk PCa from 2003 to 2007 who completed 5 yr of follow-up. Of these men, 1729 (15%) chose AS for the primary management strategy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We calculated the probability of discontinuation of AS over time, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine factors associated with discontinuation. Reasons for discontinuation were assessed by data extraction from medical charts.  Results and limitations:   By 5 yr, 64% of the men remained on AS. Predictors of discontinuation were younger age, fewer comorbidities, more education, higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and clinical stage T2 disease; marital status did not predict discontinuation. In a subset with data on the reason for discontinuation (86%), 20% of men discontinued because of patient preference, 52% because of PSA progression, 24% because of biopsy progression, and 3% for other reasons.  Conclusions:   In a population-based setting, the majority of men remained on AS at 5 yr. However, one-fifth of the men who discontinued AS did so for nonbiologic reasons. Thus, there is a need for support and counseling for men to continue AS in the absence of signs of progression to improve adherence to AS and decrease overtreatment.  Patient summary:   Active surveillance (AS) is an important option to delay or avoid treatment for men with favorable prostate cancer features. This study shows that at 5 yr, 64% of men across an entire population remained on AS. We concluded that AS is a durable option and that counseling may be useful to promote adherence for men without progression.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Yasin Folkvaljon', 'Danil V Makarov', 'Ola Bratt', 'Anna Bill-Axelson', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Active surveillance: protocol makes perfect.', 'Re: Five-year nationwide follow-up study of active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Outcome following active surveillance of men with screen-detected prostate cancer.

Relationships exist between the BPAQ-derived physical activity and bone density in healthy middle-aged and older men but not men with prostate cancer. Disease-related treatments detrimental to bone should be considered when administering the BPAQ.  Introduction:   The bone-specific physical activity questionnaire (BPAQ) was developed to account for bone-specific loading. In this retrospective study, we examined the relationship between BPAQ-derived physical activity and bone mineral density (BMD) in middle-aged and older men with and without prostate cancer.  Methods:   Two groups, 36 healthy men and 69 men with prostate cancer receiving androgen suppression therapy (AST), completed the BPAQ and had whole body, total hip, femoral (FN) and lumbar spine BMD assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.  Results:   Past (pBPAQ), current (cBPAQ) and total BPAQ (tBPAQ) scores for the healthy men were related to FN BMD (pBPAQ r = 0.36, p = 0.030; cBPAQ r s = 0.35, p = 0.034; tBPAQ r = 0.41, p = 0.014), and pBPAQ and tBPAQ were related to total hip (r s = 0.35, p = 0.035 and r s = 0.36, p = 0.029, respectively) and whole body BMD (r s = 0.44, p = 0.007 and r s = 0.45, p = 0.006, respectively). In men with prostate cancer, the BPAQ was not significantly associated with BMD. In stepwise regression analyses, body mass and tBPAQ predicted 30 % of the variance in total hip BMD (p = 0.003), cBPAQ predicted 14 % of the variance in FN BMD (p = 0.002), and body mass, age and tBPAQ predicted 47% of the variance in whole body BMD (p < 0.001) in healthy men. In men with prostate cancer, the BPAQ was not an independent predictor of BMD.

Most studies to date however, have been carried out at or post treatment with an emphasis on functional quality of life outcomes. Men recently diagnosed with localised prostate cancer (N = 89) attending a Rapid Access Prostate Clinic to discuss treatment options completed self report questionnaires on stress, self-efficacy, and mood. Information on age and disease status was gathered from hospital records. Self-efficacy and stress together explained more than half of the variance on anxiety and depression. Self-efficacy explained variance on all 6 emotional domains of the POMS (ranging from 5-25%) with high scores linked to good emotional adjustment. Perceived global and cancer specific stress also explained variance on the 6 emotional domains of the POMS (8-31%) with high stress linked to poor mood. These findings extend understanding of the role of efficacy beliefs and stress appraisal in predicting emotional adjustment in men at diagnosis and identify those at risk for poor adaptation at this time.

This study investigated whether a molecular feature, PTEN protein loss, could help identify which Gleason score 6 tumors on biopsy are likely to be upgraded at radical prostatectomy. Seventy one patients with Gleason score 6 tumors on biopsy upgraded to Gleason score 7 or higher at prostatectomy (cases) were compared with 103 patients with Gleason score 6 on both biopsy and prostatectomy (controls). A validated immunohistochemical assay for PTEN was performed, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect PTEN gene deletion in a subset. PTEN protein loss and clinical-pathologic variables were assessed by logistic regression. Upgraded patients were older than controls (61.8 vs 59.3 years), had higher pre-operative PSA levels (6.5 vs 5.3 ng/ml) and a higher fraction of involved cores (0.42 vs 0.36). PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry was found in 18% (13/71) of upgraded cases compared with 7% (7/103) of controls (P=0.02). Comparison between PTEN immunohistochemistry and PTEN FISH showed the assays were highly concordant, with 97% (65/67) of evaluated biopsies with intact PTEN protein lacking PTEN gene deletion, and 81% (13/16) of the biopsies with PTEN protein loss showing homozygous PTEN gene deletion. Tumors with PTEN protein loss were more likely to be upgraded at radical prostatectomy than those without loss, even after adjusting for age, preoperative PSA, clinical stage and race (odds ratio=3.04 (1.08-8.55; P=0.035)).

Methods:   Forty-one men with prostate cancer participated in a double blinded randomized placebo controlled study.

We aimed to clarify the manner and clinicopathological significance of seminal vesicle intraepithelial involvement. Of 1629 consecutive radical prostatectomies, 109 cases (6.7%) showed seminal vesicle invasion in whole-mounted radical prostatectomy specimens.

Stromal invasion of the IES/ejaculatory duct system and ejaculatory duct intraepithelial invasion by prostate cancer were identified in 62 and 5 of 109 pT3b cases, respectively. However, the presence/absence of IES/ejaculatory duct system involvement by prostate cancer does not predict seminal vesicle intraepithelial involvement. No statistically significant correlation was observed between all pathologic parameters/biochemical recurrence and the presence/absence of seminal vesicle intra-epithelial involvement in the pT3b cases. These findings suggest that seminal vesicle intraepithelial involvement is more likely due to direct invasion of carcinoma from the muscular wall of seminal vesicles rather than intraepithelial extension from the ejaculatory duct system in the IES.

In the current study, we demonstrate that LPA stimulates migration and proliferation of highly metastatic human prostate cancer, PC-3M-luc-C6 cells. LPA-induced migration of PC-3M-luc-C6 cells was abrogated by pretreatment of PC-3M-luc-C6 cells with the LPA receptor 1/3 inhibitor Ki16425 or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of endogenous LPA receptor 1, implicating a key role of the LPA-LPA receptor 1 signaling axis in migration of PC-3M-luc-C6 cells. In addition, LPA treatment resulted in augmented expression levels of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and siRNA or short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated silencing of KLF4 expression resulted in the abolishment of LPA-stimulated migration and proliferation of PC-3M-luc-C6 cells. shRNA-mediated silencing of KLF4 expression resulted in the inhibition of in vivo growth of PC-3M-luc-C6 cells in a xenograft transplantation animal model.

We aimed to use stereology in PCa evaluations and investigate whether mean nuclear volume (MNV) correlates with the Gleason primary pattern (Gpp) and to improve the subjective GSc to obtain an objective and reliable method without inter-observer dissension.  Methods:   We identified 74 radical prostatectomy specimens that were divided into six groups based on Gpp, from 3 to 5. Controls (C) were designed in paired non-tumor regions of the same specimens. MNV was estimated using the ""point-sampled intercepts"" method. Differences in MNV among the C groups and the Gpp groups were tested with the Kruskall-Wallis test and Dunn post-hoc test. Differences between each Gpp group and its control counterpart were tested with the Wilcoxon test. Correlations were evaluated with the Spearman rank correlation (R[Spearman]).  Results:   The correlations between prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and GSc (R[Spearman] of 0.76) and between PSA and MNV (R[Spearman] of 0.78) were moderately strong and highly significant, and the correlation between MNV and Gpp (R[Spearman] of 0.53) was moderate and highly significant. MNV was significantly greater in cancerous regions than in paired-control regions. Limitations included sample size.  Conclusions:   Proper planning of a study, as well as the availability of equipment and software for morphological quantification, can provide incentive to quickly and accurately estimate MNV as an adjunct parameter in the assessment of PCa.

Although successful outcomes have been demonstrated in patients previously treated with moderate doses of radiotherapy, there is reluctance towards its indication due to the concern of severe adverse events in patients treated with high doses of radiation.  Objectives:   The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of APC in the management of bleeding radiationinduced proctitis in patients treated with high doses of radiation for prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   Data from 30 patients were treated with APC due to chronic radiation proctitis, were reviewed retrospectively. All cases had prostate cancer and 9 of them (30 %) underwent previous radical prostatectomy. The median dose of conformal 3D External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) delivered was 74 Gy (range 46-76). Median rectal D1cc and D2cc was 72.5 and 72.4 Gy respectively. Median rectal V70, V60 and V40 was 12, 39.5 and 80 %. Cardiovascular and digestive disease, diabetes, smoking behaviour, lowest haemoglobin and transfusion requirements were recorded. Indications for treatment with APC were anemia and persistent bleeding despite medical treatment. Argon gas flow was set at 1.8 l/min with an electrical power setting of 50 W.  Results:   Median age of all patients was 69.6 years. The median lowest haemoglobin level was 9.6 g/dL. Median time between completion of radiotherapy and first session of APC was 13 months. Ninety-four therapeutic sessions were performed (median 3 sessions). Median time follow-up was 14.5 months (range 2-61). Complete response with resolved rectal bleeding was achieved in 23 patients (77 %), partial response in 5 (16 %) and no control in 2 (6 %). No patients required transfusion following therapy. Two patients developed long-term (> 6 weeks) grade 2 rectal ulceration and grade 2 rectal incontinence, respectively.  Conclusions:   The argon plasma coagulation is an effective and safe management option in patients with medically refractory rectal bleeding after high doses of radiation for prostate cancer.""","""['Eduardo Hortelano', 'Alfonso Gómez-Iturriaga', 'Roberto Ortiz-de-Zárate', 'Manuel Zaballa', 'Ángel Barturen', 'Francisco Casquero', 'Íñigo San-Miguel', 'Carvajal Carvajal', 'Jon Cacicedo', 'Olga Del-Hoyo', 'Javier Lupiani', 'Fernando Pérez', 'Pedro Bilbao']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Rev Esp Enferm Dig""","""['Argon gas in the management of radiation proctitis--effective and safe for everyone?', 'Is argon plasma coagulation an efficient treatment for digestive system vascular malformation and radiation proctitis?', 'Long-term results on the efficacy of argon plasma coagulation for patients with chronic radiation proctitis after conventionally fractionated, dose-escalated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Argon plasma coagulation for the treatment of hemorrhagic radiation proctitis.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'A case of haemorrhagic radiation proctitis: successful treatment with argon plasma coagulation.', 'Diode Laser Therapy for Radiation-Induced Vascular Ectasia: Long-Term Results and Cost Analysis.', 'Temporal course of late rectal toxicity & impact of intervention in patients undergoing radiation for cervical cancer.', 'A Ten-year-long Update on Radiation Proctitis Among Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Curative External Beam Radiotherapy.', 'A Randomized Controlled Trial of Novel Treatment for Hemorrhagic Radiation Proctitis.', 'Mesalazine suppository for the treatment of refractory ulcerative chronic radiation proctitis.']"""

Combined morphological and functional MRI scoring systems was used for urological–radiological work-up of patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value ≤ 10 ng/mL.  Materials and methods:   The study included 136 of 200 consecutive patients with PSA values between 2.5 and 4 ng/mL and an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE), or patients with PSA values between 4 and 10 ng/mL, independently from DRE. Each patient provided informed consent to undergo at serum free/total PSA ratio (f/t PSA) assay, mMRI, MRS, DWI, and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) biopsy. The MRI datasets were scored singularly; then mMRI and DWI, mMRI and MRS data were combined in a coupled score, and finally mMRI, DWI, and MRS data were combined in a single score (cMRI score).  Results:   Scores were correlated to negative biopsies and significant/insignificant Gleason score biopsies. Receiver-operator-characteristic curve and McNemar tests were performed. Cancer was diagnosed in 18% of patients. The cMRI score showed: (i) the highest sensitivity (0.84) and negative predictive value (0.93); (ii) a significant correlation with Gleason score; and (iii) a statistically different median value between significant and insignificant Gleason score.

The mechanisms that mediate this polarization are not clear. Macrophages are phagocytic cells that participate in the clearance of apoptotic cells, a process known as efferocytosis. Milk fat globule- EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a bridge protein that facilitates efferocytosis and is associated with suppression of proinflammatory responses. This study investigated the hypothesis that MFG-E8-mediated efferocytosis promotes M2 polarization. Tissue and serum exosomes from prostate cancer patients presented higher levels of MFG-E8 compared with controls, a novel finding in human prostate cancer. Coculture of macrophages with apoptotic cancer cells increased efferocytosis, elevated MFG-E8 protein expression levels, and induced macrophage polarization into an alternatively activated M2 phenotype. Administration of antibody against MFG-E8 significantly attenuated the increase in M2 polarization. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation using the inhibitor Stattic decreased efferocytosis and M2 macrophage polarization in vitro, with a correlating increase in SOCS3 protein expression. Moreover, MFG-E8 knockdown tumor cells cultured with wild-type or MFG-E8-deficient macrophages resulted in increased SOCS3 expression with decreased STAT3 activation. This suggests that SOCS3 and phospho-STAT3 act in an inversely dependent manner when stimulated by MFG-E8 and efferocytosis. These results uncover a unique role of efferocytosis via MFG-E8 as a mechanism for macrophage polarization into tumor-promoting M2 cells.""","""['Fabiana N Soki', 'Amy J Koh', 'Jacqueline D Jones', 'Yeo Won Kim', 'Jinlu Dai', 'Evan T Keller', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Kamran Atabai', 'Hernan Roca', 'Laurie K McCauley']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['MFG-E8 and HMGB1 are involved in the mechanism underlying alcohol-induced impairment of macrophage efferocytosis.', 'Knockdown of milk-fat globule EGF factor-8 suppresses glioma progression in GL261 glioma cells by repressing microglial M2 polarization.', 'MFG-E8 promotes tendon-bone healing by regualting macrophage efferocytosis and M2 polarization after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.', 'MFG-E8-dependent clearance of apoptotic cells, and autoimmunity caused by its failure.', 'Review: milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 expression, function and plausible signal transduction in resolving inflammation.', 'Tumor hijacks macrophages and microbiota through extracellular vesicles.', 'Update of cellular responses to the efferocytosis of necroptosis and pyroptosis.', 'Caspase-9 driven murine model of selective cell apoptosis and efferocytosis.', 'Bone Marrow Macrophages Induce Inflammation by Efferocytosis of Apoptotic Prostate Cancer Cells via HIF-1α Stabilization.', 'Elevated MFG-E8 in CSF in the Early Stage Indicates Rapid Recovery of Mild Aneurysmal SAH Patients.']"""

Anthraquinone-based natural products and synthetic compounds have shown anticancer activity. However, cardiac toxicity is a major adverse reaction in these compounds. CC-36, a unique anthraquinone derivative, displayed higher antiproliferative activity in HRMPC than that in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and normal prostate cells with the selectivity of five and twelve times, respectively. CC-36 caused G1 arrest of the cell cycle associated with an upregulation of p21 and downregulated levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E expressions. Immunoprecipitation assay and Western blotting analysis showed that CC-36 triggered an increase of TSC1/TSC2 association and suppressed the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Ser2448) and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) (Thr389), indicating the inhibition of both kinases' activities. CC-36 induced liver kinase B1 (LKB1) phosphorylation at Thr189, leading to LKB1 translocation from nucleus to cytosol for AMPKα phosphorylation (Thr172) and the kinase activation. The signaling pathway was validated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique with LKB1 knockdown. The combination treatment of MK2206 (a specific Akt inhibitor) with CC-36 showed a synergistic apoptosis in PC-3 cells indicating a potential combination strategy for LKB1 activators. Taken together, the data suggest that CC-36 displays anti-HRMPC activity through the activation of LKB1-AMPK pathway, leading to an inhibition of mTOR signaling and the induction of G1 arrest of the cell cycle.

Estrogens are synthesized by aromatase which has been used as a biomarker both in breast and lung cancer. Estrogen biological activities are executed by their classic receptors (ERα and ERβ). ERα has been described as a cancer promoter and ERβ, as a possible tumor suppressor. Both receptors are present at low levels in primary multiforme glioblastoma (GBM). The GBM frequency is 50 % higher in men than in women. The GBM patient survival period ranges from 7 to 18 months. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate aromatase and estrogen receptor expression, as well as 17ß-estradiol concentration in astrocytoma patients biopsies to obtain a prognosis biomarker for these patients. We analyzed 36 biopsies of astrocytoma patients with a different grade (I-IV) of malignity. Aromatase and estrogen receptor mRNA expression were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR, and the E2 levels, by ELISA. E2 concentration was higher in GBM, compared to grade II or III astrocytomas. The number of cells immunoreactive to aromatase and estrogen receptors decreased as the grade of tumor malignity increased. Aromatase mRNA expression was present in all biopsies, regardless of malignity grade or patient age or gender. The highest expression of aromatase mRNA in GBM patients was associated to the worst survival prognostic (6.28 months). In contrast lowest expression of ERα mRNA in astrocytoma patients had a worst prognosis. In conclusion, aromatase and ERα expression could be used as prognosis biomarkers for astrocytoma patients.""","""['J M Dueñas Jiménez', 'A Candanedo Arellano', 'A Santerre', 'S Orozco Suárez', 'H Sandoval Sánchez', 'I Feria Romero', 'R López-Elizalde', 'M Alonso Venegas', 'B Netel', 'B de la Torre Valdovinos', 'S H Dueñas Jiménez']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Neurooncol""","""['High expression of estrogen receptor alpha and aromatase in glial tumor cells is associated with gender-independent survival benefits in glioblastoma patients.', 'The modulation of aromatase and estrogen receptor alpha in cultured human dermal papilla cells by dexamethasone: a novel mechanism for selective action of estrogen via estrogen receptor beta?', 'Altered expression of ERs, aromatase, and COX2 connected to estrogen action in type 1 endometrial cancer biology.', 'Estrogen receptor beta as a prognostic factor in breast cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in astrocytomas: a literature review.', 'Locomotion Outcome Improvement in Mice with Glioblastoma Multiforme after Treatment with Anastrozole.', 'Effect of the Use of Gnrh Analogs in Low-Grade Cerebral Glioma.', 'Identification of Gender- and Subtype-Specific Gene Expression Associated with Patient Survival in Low-Grade and Anaplastic Glioma in Connection with Steroid Signaling.', 'Potentiation of temozolomide activity against glioblastoma cells by aromatase inhibitor letrozole.', 'Proliferation and apoptosis regulation by G protein-coupled estrogen receptor in glioblastoma C6 cells.']"""

As new treatment patterns emerge, it will be imperative to understand treatment patterns and costs of care prior to the advent of novel treatments.  Objective:   As the PCa treatment landscape is evolving, this study sought to compare the hospital-based utilization and costs in two cohorts of patients with PCa: patients with bone metastases (w/BM) and patients without bone metastases (w/oBM). Comparisons were also made for patients with inpatient versus outpatient encounters.  Methods:   Patients in the Premier Perspective Database, a US hospital database, between January 2006 and December 2010, treated in an inpatient or outpatient setting for PCa (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision [ICD-9] diagnosis codes 185, 233.4) were included. Patients were required to be ≥40 years of age with no additional cancers. Patients were put into cohorts on the basis of the presence of bone metastases (ICD-9 code 198.5 or use of zoledronic acid or pamidronate disodium). Utilization of PCa-related treatments was compared, controlling for age, race, hospital type, payer type, bed size, and admission source and type. Differences in treatments were assessed utilizing logistic regression, while differences in costs were analyzed using gamma-distributed generalized linear models with a log-link function. All costs are reported in US$ 2010.  Results:   There were 23,747 hospitalizations for men w/BM (13,716 inpatient; 10,031 outpatient) and 187,708 hospitalizations (74,435 inpatient; 113,258 outpatient) for men w/oBM. The mean length of stay for men w/BM was 4 days compared with 2 days for men w/oBM (P < 0.0001). Overall, the mean cost per encounter was US$9,728 in men with w/BM and US$7,405 in men w/oBM (P = 0.0006). For inpatient stays, the mean cost per encounter was US$14,145 for men w/BM and US$11,944 for men w/oBM. For outpatient visits, the mean cost per encounter was US$3,688 for men w/BM and US$4,422 for men w/oBM. Men w/BM received hormone therapy (44.3%) and secondary hormone therapy (46.4%) most often, while men w/oBM received radiation (48.8%) and surgery (31.9%) most often.  Conclusion:   Costs and utilization of PCa-related treatments vary on the basis of the presence of metastases and treatment setting (inpatient vs. outpatient).""","""['Brian Seal', 'Sean D Sullivan', 'Scott D Ramsey', 'Carl V Asche', 'Ken Shermock', 'Syam Sarma', 'Erin A Zagadailov', 'Eileen Farrelly', 'Michael Eaddy']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Appl Health Econ Health Policy""","""['Evaluating treatments and corresponding costs of prostate cancer patients treated within an inpatient or hospital-based outpatient setting.', 'Economic evaluation of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Healthcare utilization and costs associated with skeletal-related events in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Understanding treatments for bone loss and bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer: a practical review and guide for the clinician.', 'Zoledronic acid: a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in the management of bone metastases.', 'The Health Economics of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive and Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer-A Systematic Literature Review with Application to the Canadian Context.', 'Understanding the impact of clinical characteristics and healthcare utilizations on suicide among cancer sufferers: a case-control study in Hong Kong.', 'Costs and Healthcare Resource Utilization Associated with Hospital Admissions of Patients with Metastatic or Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Treatment patterns of prostate cancer with bone metastasis in Beijing: A real-world study using data from an administrative claims database.', 'Evaluation of Treatment Patterns and Costs in Patients with Prostate Cancer and Bone Metastases.']"""

Methods:   Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 18 men (age = 63.1 ± 3.8) who were on ADT for prostate cancer for ≤12 months and who were part of a pre-existing exercise intervention trial.  Results:   Sexual concerns for men included changes in body image, partner relationships, sex drive, sexual performance and masculinity. In coping with these concerns, men described a sense of personal acceptance of sexual changes through a shift in priorities and values away from penetrative sexual intercourse, knowledge and understanding about ADT, and partner support. Exercise in a group-based setting contributed to the acceptance of sexual changes through affirming strength-based aspects of masculinity and peer support.

This work applies a bystander effect model to calculate equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and tumor control probability (TCP) for external beam prostate treatment and compares the results with a more common model where local response is dictated exclusively by local absorbed dose. The broad assumptions applied in the bystander effect model are intended to place an upper limit on the extent of the results in a clinical context.  Materials and methods:   EUD and TCP of a prostate cancer target volume under conditions of increasing dose heterogeneity were calculated using two models: One incorporating bystander effects derived from previously published in vitro bystander data ( McMahon et al. 2012 , 2013a); and one using a common linear-quadratic (LQ) response that relies exclusively on local absorbed dose. Dose through the CTV was modelled as a normal distribution, where the degree of heterogeneity was then dictated by changing the standard deviation (SD). Also, a representative clinical dose distribution was examined as cold (low dose) sub-volumes were systematically introduced.  Results:   The bystander model suggests a moderate degree of dose heterogeneity throughout a target volume will yield as good or better outcome compared to a uniform dose in terms of EUD and TCP. For a typical intermediate risk prostate prescription of 78 Gy over 39 fractions maxima in EUD and TCP as a function of increasing SD occurred at SD ∼ 5 Gy. The plots only dropped below the uniform dose values for SD ∼ 10 Gy, almost 13% of the prescribed dose. Small, but potentially significant differences in the outcome metrics between the models were identified in the clinically-derived dose distribution as cold sub-volumes were introduced.  Conclusions:   In terms of EUD and TCP, the bystander model demonstrates the potential to deviate from the common local LQ model predictions as dose heterogeneity through a prostate CTV varies. The results suggest, at least in a limiting sense, the potential for allowing some degree of dose heterogeneity within a CTV, although further investigation of the assumptions of the bystander model are warranted.""","""['Michael J Balderson', 'Charles Kirkby']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['Potential implications on TCP for external beam prostate cancer treatment when considering the bystander effect in partial exposure scenarios.', 'Impact of tumor repopulation on radiotherapy planning.', 'Evaluation of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer using equivalent uniform dose.', 'The alfa and beta of tumours: a review of parameters of the linear-quadratic model, derived from clinical radiotherapy studies.', 'Linear quadratic and tumour control probability modelling in external beam radiotherapy.', 'A quantitative assessment of the consequences of allowing dose heterogeneity in prostate radiation therapy planning.']"""

Further, we observed i) an upregulation of pro-apoptosis Bax and a down-regulation of the pro-survival Bcl2, and ii) an increase in pro-apoptosis Bad. Furthermore, the combination resulted in a modulation of apolipoprotein E, selenoprotein P and Nrf2 in a fashion that favors antiproliferative responses.

Evaluation of the most differentially expressed miRNAs showed that miR-132, miR-367b, miR-410, and miR-152 were decreased in more aggressive cells, and this was reversed after treatment of the cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Sequencing of the miR-152 promoter confirmed that it was highly methylated. Ectopic expression of miR-152 resulted in decreased growth, migration, and invasion. Informatics analysis of a large patient cohort showed that decreased miR-152 expression correlated with increased metastasis and a decrease in biochemical recurrence free survival. Analysis of 39 prostate cancer tissues with matched controls (20 AA and 19 CA), showed that 50% of AA patients had statistically significant lower miR-152 expression compared to only 35% of CA patients. Ectopic expression of miR-152 in LNCaP, PC-3, and MDA-PCa-2b cells down-regulated DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) through direct binding in the DNMT1 3'UTR. There appeared to be a reciprocal regulatory relationship of miR-152/DNMT1 expression, as cells treated with siRNA DNMT1 caused miR-152 to be re-expressed in all cell lines.

However, it is still unknown whether CAMK2N1 plays a role in prostate cancer development. We first examined the protein and mRNA levels of CAMK2N1 and observed a significant decrease in human prostate cancers comparing to normal prostate tissues. Re-expression of CAMK2N1 in prostate cancer cells reduced cellular proliferation, arrested cells in G0/G1 phases, and induced apoptotic cell death accompanied by down-regulation of IGF-1, ErbB2, and VEGF downstream kinases PI3K/AKT, as well as the MEK/ERK-mediated signaling pathways. Conversely, knockdown of CAMK2N1 had a significant opposite effects on these phenotypes. Our analyses suggest that CAMK2N1 plays a tumor suppressive role in prostate cancer cells. Reduced CAMK2N1 expression correlates to human prostate cancer progression and predicts poor clinical outcome, indicating that CAMK2N1 may serve as a biomarker.

For external validation of our model, we used data from a cohort of 3595 patients who underwent an anatomically defined extended pelvic lymph node dissection. We estimated the sensitivity of pathological nodal staging using a beta-binomial model and developed a novel clinical (preoperative) nodal staging score (cNSS), which represents the probability that a patient has lymph node metastasis as a function of the number of examined nodes.  Results:   In the development and validation cohorts, the probability of missing a positive lymph node decreases with increase in the number of nodes examined. A 90% cNSS can be achieved in the development and validation cohorts by examining 1-6 nodes in cT1 and 6-8 nodes in cT2 tumours. With 11 nodes examined, patients in the development and validation cohorts achieved a cNSS of 90% and 80% with cT3 tumours, respectively.  Conclusions:   Pelvic lymph node dissection is the only reliable technique to ensure accurate nodal staging in patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localised prostate cancer. The minimum number of examined lymph nodes needed for accurate nodal staging may be predictable, being strongly dependent on prostate cancer characteristics at diagnosis.""","""['L A Kluth', 'F Abdollah', 'E Xylinas', 'M Rieken', 'H Fajkovic', 'C Seitz', 'M Sun', 'P I Karakiewicz', 'P Schramek', 'M P Herman', 'A Becker', 'J Hansen', 'B Ehdaie', 'W Loidl', 'K Pummer', 'R K Lee', 'Y Lotan', 'D S Scherr', 'D Seiler', 'S A Ahyai', 'F K-H Chun', 'M Graefen', 'A Tewari', 'A Nonis', 'A Bachmann', 'F Montorsi', 'M Gönen', 'A Briganti', 'S F Shariat']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Pathologic nodal staging scores in patients treated with radical prostatectomy: a postoperative decision tool.', 'Clinical nodal staging scores for bladder cancer: a proposal for preoperative risk assessment.', ""Effect of Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection on Oncologic Outcomes in Patients with D'Amico Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: A Multi-Institutional Study."", 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Current status of pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer: the New York PLND nomogram.', 'Pathologic node-negative lung cancer: Adequacy of lymph node yield and a tool to assess the risk of occult nodal disease.', 'Influence of Biopsy Gleason Score on the Risk of Lymph Node Invasion in Patients With Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'On the probability of lymph node negativity in pN0-staged prostate cancer-a\xa0theoretically derived rule of thumb for adjuvant needs.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and Prostate Cancer Staging: is our current conventional staging obsolete?', 'Positive Association between Preoperative Total Testosterone and Lymph Node Invasion in Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.']"""

We analysed and compared 76 urine samples (38 before and 38 after prostate massage) from the benign group (BPH) and 66 urine samples (33 before and 33 after prostate massage) from patients with PCa confirmed by prostate biopsy. EN2 levels from the PCa and men with BPH (age range 50-82) were related to the tumour stage, Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen. EN2 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in urine. The median EN2 levels in urine after prostate massage were significantly different from those determined in urine before prostate massage (1.25 ng/ml in the PCa group and 0.34 ng/ml in the BPH). The mean EN2 levels in PCa patients were 3.76-fold higher than those in non-PCa patients after prostate massage. The distinct influence of prostate massage on EN2 levels was found to be related to the Gleason score and tumour stage. EN2 may be considered a marker of PCa with certain limitations, such as those related to tumour staging.

LNCaP (p53 wild-type), PC3 (p53 null) and DU145 (p53 mutant) cells received a 10 Gy single dose or 1 Gy × 10 multifractionated radiation dose to simulate hypofractionated and conventionally fractionated prostate radiotherapy. Total RNA was isolated 24 h after multifractionated radiation treatment and single-dose treatments and subjected to microarray analysis and later validated by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was utilized to identify total-dose inflection points for significantly upregulated genes in response to multifractionated radiation therapy. Radiation-induced damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) and cytokine analyses were performed using bioluminescence and ELISA. Multifractionated doses activated immune response genes more robustly than single-dose treatment, with a relatively larger number of immune genes upregulated in PC3 compared to DU145 and LNCaP cells. The inflection point of multifractionated radiation-induced immune genes in PC3 cells was observed in the range of 8-10 Gy total radiation dose. Although both multifractionated and single-dose radiation-induced proinflammatory DAMPs and positively modulated the cytokine environment, the changes were of higher magnitude with multifractionated therapy.

The androgen receptor (AR), a key driver of prostate cancer, regulates prostate cancer cell metabolism by driving the expression of a network of metabolic genes and activates AMPK through increasing the expression of one of its upstream kinases. To more clearly define the role of AMPK in prostate cancer, we performed expression profiling following pharmacologic activation of this kinase. We found that genes down-regulated upon AMPK activation were over-expressed in prostate cancer, consistent with a tumour suppressive function of AMPK. Strikingly, we identified the AR as one of the most significantly enriched transcription factors mediating gene expression changes downstream of AMPK signalling in prostate cancer cells. Activation of AMPK inhibited AR transcriptional activity and reduced androgen-dependent expression of known AR target genes. Conversely, knock-down of AMPK increased AR activity. Modulation of AR expression could not explain these effects. Instead, we observed that activation of AMPK reduced nuclear localisation of the AR. We thus propose the presence of a negative feedback loop in prostate cancer cells whereby AR activates AMPK and AMPK feeds back to limit AR-driven transcription.""","""['Sarah Jurmeister', 'Antonio Ramos-Montoya', 'David E Neal', 'Lee G D Fryer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The interplay of AMP-activated protein kinase and androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor signaling regulates the transcriptome of prostate cancer cells by modulating global alternative splicing.', 'Dual targeting of androgen receptor and mTORC1 by salinomycin in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.', 'The potent AMPK inhibitor BAY-3827 shows strong efficacy in androgen-dependent prostate cancer models.', 'Enzalutamide, an Androgen Receptor Antagonist, Enhances Myeloid Cell-Mediated Immune Suppression and Tumor Progression.', 'CAMKK2 Promotes Prostate Cancer Independently of AMPK via Increased Lipogenesis.']"""

We assessed the effect of previously diagnosed depression on outcomes of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   We performed a population-based observational cohort study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data of 41,275 men diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer from 2004 to 2007. We identified 1,894 men with a depressive disorder in the 2 years before the prostate cancer diagnosis and determined its effect on treatment and survival.  Results:   Men with depressive disorder were older, white or Hispanic, unmarried, resided in nonmetropolitan areas and areas of lower median income, and had more comorbidities (P < .05 for all), but there was no variation in clinicopathologic characteristics. In adjusted analyses, men with depressive disorder were more likely to undergo expectant management for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease (P ≤ .05, respectively). Conversely, depressed men were less likely to undergo definitive therapy (surgery or radiation) across all risk strata (P < .01, respectively). Depressed men experienced worse overall mortality across risk strata (low: relative risk [RR], 1.86; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.33; P < .001; intermediate: RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.49; P = .01; high: RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.32; P = .02).  Conclusion:   Men with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer and a recent diagnosis of depression are less likely to undergo definitive treatment and experience worse overall survival. The effect of depression disorders on prostate cancer treatment and survivorship warrants further study, because both conditions are relatively common in men in the United States.""","""['Sandip M Prasad', 'Scott E Eggener', 'Stuart R Lipsitz', 'Michael R Irwin', 'Patricia A Ganz', 'Jim C Hu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer: Depression and prostate cancer--why do they show up together?', 'Mortality in older men with low-risk prostate cancer and high comorbidity.', 'Reply to P.

We examined prospectively this association with extended follow-up and an emphasis on advanced and lethal disease.  Patients and methods:   Among 49,405 U.S. men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, age 40 to 75 years at baseline in 1986, 6,023 patients with prostate cancer were diagnosed during the follow-up to 2010, including 811 lethal cases. In total, 12,321 men (25%) had vasectomies. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% CIs of total, advanced, high-grade, and lethal disease, with adjustment for a variety of possible confounders.  Results:   Vasectomy was associated with a small increased risk of prostate cancer overall (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.17). Risk was elevated for high-grade (Gleason score 8 to 10; RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.45) and lethal disease (death or distant metastasis; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.43). Among a subcohort of men receiving regular prostate-specific antigen screening, the association with lethal cancer was stronger (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.36). Vasectomy was not associated with the risk of low-grade or localized disease. Additional analyses suggested that the associations were not driven by differences in sex hormone levels, sexually transmitted infections, or cancer treatment.  Conclusion:   Our data support the hypothesis that vasectomy is associated with a modest increased incidence of lethal prostate cancer. The results do not appear to be due to detection bias, and confounding by infections or cancer treatment is unlikely.""","""['Mohummad Minhaj Siddiqui', 'Kathryn M Wilson', 'Mara M Epstein', 'Jennifer R Rider', 'Neil E Martin', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Edward L Giovannucci', 'Lorelei A Mucci']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer: Unravelling bias in vasectomy associations.', 'Re: Vasectomy and risk of aggressive prostate cancer: a 24-year follow-up study.', 'Words of wisdom.

To acquire these characteristics, epithelial tumor cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT), whereby cells lose polarity and E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Post-EMT cells have also been shown, or assumed, to be more migratory; however, there have been contradictory reports on an immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line (HMLE) that underwent EMT. In the context of carcinoma-associated EMT, it is not yet clear whether the change in migration and invasion must be positively correlated during EMT or whether enhanced migration is a necessary consequence of having undergone EMT. Here, we report that pre-EMT rat prostate cancer (PC) and HMLE cells are more migratory than their post-EMT counterparts. To determine a mechanism for increased epithelial cell migration, gene expression analysis was performed and revealed an increase in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in pre-EMT cells. Indeed, inhibition of EGFR in PC epithelial cells slowed migration. Importantly, while post-EMT PC and HMLE cell lines are less migratory, both remain invasive in vitro and, for PC cells, in vivo.

Recent studies have shown that vagal nerve activity independently predicts prognosis in cancer. Here, we take this one step further and show that when vagal nerve activity is high, cancer stage no longer predicts tumor burden. We examined whether vagal nerve activity, indexed by Heart Rate Variability (HRV), moderated the effects of initial tumor stage on tumor burden at followup. Patients' HRVs were derived from ECGs near diagnosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) and in prostate cancer (PC) patients. Outcomes included the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) at 12 months for CRC and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at 6 months for PC. As would be expected, initially advanced tumor stages of CRC or PC predicted higher tumor marker levels at follow-up than did early stages. However, this occurred only in patients with low, not high, vagal activity (HRV). Furthermore, in patients with advanced tumor stage at diagnosis, high HRV predicted lower tumor marker levels than did low HRV, in both cancers. Estimating a cancer patient's prognosis by determining his tumor stage needs to also consider the vagal nerve activity. This activity is easily measurable, and it determines in which subjects the tumor stage is prognostic. Importantly, higher vagal activity may even protect against the adverse effects of advanced cancer stage. These findings, observed in two distinct cancers, support the hypothesized neuroimmunomodulatory effects of vagal nerve activity on tumors.""","""['Y Gidron', 'M De Couck', 'J De Greve']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Biol Regul Homeost Agents""","""['The relationship between vagal nerve activity and clinical outcomes in prostate and non-small cell lung cancer patients.', 'Norms of vagal nerve activity, indexed by Heart Rate Variability, in cancer patients.', 'The relationship between heart rate variability and time-course of carcinoembryonic antigen in colorectal cancer.', 'Tumor markers.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor family members (HER) such as EGFR and HER2 are involved in mitogenic signaling pathways implicated in the progression of prostate cancer. We analyzed the cross-talk between GHRH and EGF receptors in prostate cancer. The effects of GHRH in HER signaling were evaluated on human androgen-independent PC3 prostate cancer cells in vitro and GHRH antagonist in vitro and in nude mice xenografts of PC3 prostate cancer. Time-course studies indicated that GHRH had a stimulatory activity on both the expression of EGFR and HER2. GHRH analogues, JMR-132 and JV-1-38, endowed with antagonistic activity for GHRH receptors, abrogated the response to GHRH in PC3 cells. GHRH stimulated a rapid ligand-independent activation of EGFR and HER2 involving at least cAMP/PKA and Src family signaling pathways. GHRH also stimulated a slow ligand-dependent activation of EGFR and HER2 involving an extracellular pathway with an important role for ADAM. Preliminary results also revealed an increase of mRNA for GHRH and GHRH receptor induced by EGF. The inhibition of tumor growth, in vivo, was associated with a substantial reduction in the expression of mRNA and protein levels of EGFR and HER2 in the tumors. GHRH antagonist JV-1-38, significantly decreased the phosphorylated Src levels. The cross-talk between HER and GHRH-R may be impeded by combining drugs acting upon GHRH receptors and HER family members in human advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Laura Muñoz-Moreno', 'M Isabel Arenas', 'M José Carmena', 'Andrew V Schally', 'Juan C Prieto', 'Ana M Bajo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Inhibitory effects of antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone on growth and invasiveness of PC3 human prostate cancer.', 'Antiproliferative effect of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonist on ovarian cancer cells through the EGFR-Akt pathway.', 'Antagonists of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and of bombesin/gastrin releasing peptide (BN/GRP) suppress the expression of VEGF, bFGF, and receptors of the EGF/HER family in PC-3 and DU-145 human androgen-independent prostate cancers.', 'Antagonists of growth-hormone-releasing hormone: an emerging new therapy for cancer.', 'Molecular oncogenesis of prostate adenocarcinoma: role of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu).', 'Tumorigenic transformation of human prostatic epithelial cell line RWPE-1 by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH).', 'Neuropeptide bombesin receptor activation stimulates growth of lung cancer cells through HER3 with a MAPK-dependent mechanism.', 'Growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonist inhibits the invasiveness of human endometrial cancer cells by down-regulating twist and N-cadherin expression.', 'Somatic Mutations in Prostate Cancer: Closer to Personalized Medicine.', 'Positive and Negative Cross-Talk between Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 1, Free Fatty Acid Receptor 4, and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

In a prospective study of elderly men untreated for LUTS, we identified factors associated with symptom progression and remission.  Methods:   In community-dwelling US men aged ≥65 years, the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) was repeated four times, once at baseline (2000-2002) and then every 2 years thereafter. Analyses included 1740 men with all four AUA-SI assessments, who remained free from diagnosed prostate cancer, and who reported no treatment for LUTS or BPH during follow-up that averaged 6.9 (±0.4) years. LUTS change was determined with group-based trajectory modelingof the repeated AUA-SI measures. Multivariable logistic regression was then used to determine the baseline factors associated with progressing compared with stable trajectories, and with remitting compared with progressing trajectories. Lifestyle, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)), mobility, mental health (Short-Form 12), medical history and prescription medications were considered for selection. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for variables in each model.  Results:   We identified 10 AUA-SI trajectories: 4 stable (1277 men, 73%), three progressing (345 men, 20%), two remitting (98 men, 6%) and one mixed (20 men, 1%). Men in progressing compared with stable trajectories were more likely to have mobility limitations (OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.0-3.8), poor mental health (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.4), BMI≥25.0 kg m(-2) (OR=1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.8), hypertension (OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.4) and back pain (OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.4).

No definitive data exist on the clinical impact of anticoagulation therapy in patients with prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between therapeutic anticoagulant use and survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving docetaxel chemotherapy.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 247 consecutive patients with mCRPC who received first-line docetaxel chemotherapy between 1998 and 2010 at a single institution. Among them, 29 patients (11.7 %) received therapeutic anticoagulation (low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH] or warfarin) for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the effect of anticoagulant use on overall survival.  Results:   In univariate analysis, anticoagulant use was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; P = .024). Median survival was 20.9 months in the anticoagulation group versus 17.1 months in the control group (P = .024).

Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis yielded 20 focal salvage I125 brachytherapy patients for locally recurrent PCa after primary radiotherapy. Tumor was defined by multiparametric MRI and correspondence with transrectal biopsies. Dose data were obtained intra-operatively. The tumor was prescribed ⩾144 Gy. Toxicity was scored by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE-4). Biochemical failure (BF) was defined using the Phoenix criteria (PSA-nadir + 2.0 ng/ml). Quality of life (QoL) was measured by SF-36 Health Survey and European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) C30+3 and PR25 questionnaires.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 36 months (range 10-45), six patients experienced BF, of which three had no initial response.

Material and methods:   T₁/T₂*-weighted fast gradient echo, T₁-weighted spin echo and T₂-weighted fast spin echo images were used in bone detection investigation. Bone edge location and bone diameter in MRI were evaluated by comparing those in the images with actual physical measurements of fresh deer bones positioned in a gelatine phantom. Dose calculation accuracy in pseudo-CT images was investigated for 15 prostate cancer patients. Bone outlines in T₁/T₂*-weighted images were contoured and additional segmentation errors were simulated by expanding and contracting the bone contours with 1 mm spacing. Heterogeneous pseudo-CT images were constructed by adopting a technique transforming the MRI intensity values into Hounsfield units with separate conversion models within and outside of bone segment.  Results:   Bone edges and diameter in the phantom were illustrated correctly within a 1 mm-pixel size in MRI. Each 1 mm-sized systematic error in bone segment resulted in roughly 0.4% change to the prostate dose level in the pseudo-CT images. The prostate average (range) dose levels in pseudo-CT images with additional systematic bone segmentation errors of -2 mm, 0 mm and 2 mm were 0.5% (-0.5-1.4%), -0.2% (-1.0-0.7%), and -0.9% (-1.8-0.0%) compared to those in CT images, respectively, in volumetric modulated arc therapy treatment plans calculated by Monte Carlo algorithm.

Epigenetic gene regulation has been shown to trigger prostate cancer metastasis and androgen independence. Histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) are epigenetic enzymes that can remove both repressive and activating histone marks. KDM5 family members are capable of removing the histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation-activating mark, rendering them potential players in the down-regulation of tumor suppressors and suggesting that their activity could repress oncogenes. Here, we systematically investigated KDM5C expression patterns in two independent radical prostatectomy cohorts (822 prostate tumors in total) by immunohistochemistry. Positive nuclear KDM5C staining was significantly associated with a reduced prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival. Our study confirmed that nuclear KDM5C expression is an independent prognostic parameter. Most strikingly, the prognostic value of nuclear KDM5C expression for progression-free survival was exclusively pronounced for the Gleason group 7. In addition, KDM5C knockdown resulted in growth retardation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and induced regulation of several proliferation-associated genes. Our data indicate that KDM5C is functionally involved in proliferation control of prostate cancer cells and might represent a novel attractive therapy target.

The volume of pouch was 270-600 mL with an average of 375 mL. The basic pressure during filling period was 6-20 cmH2O with an average 15 cmH2O, the maximum filling pressure was 15-30 cmH2O with an average 26 cmH2O. The compliance of sigmoid-rectal pouch was fine with an average of 30 (range 18-40) mL/ cmH2O. There were no severe complications such as hyperchloremic acidosis or retrograde pyelonephritis. Six patients had slight hydronephrosis. The index of QoL were 0-2 in 20 patients, 3 in five patients and 4 in two patients.  Conclusion:   The sigmoid-rectal pouch operation was simple and acceptable by surgeons and patients. It may be an ideal urinary diversion for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, especially for patients on whom urethrectomy should be done.""","""['Bin Sun', 'Jing-Min Yan', 'Jian-Ye Li', 'He-Qing Guo', 'Quan Hong', 'Zhi-Yong Yao', 'Gao-Biao Zhou', 'Guang-Xin Pan', 'Xian-Chu Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['Clinical experience in a modified Roux-Y-shaped sigmoid neobladder: assessment of complications and voiding patterns in 43 patients.', 'Sigma rectum pouch for urinary diversion.', 'Urodynamic findings in patients with a urethral Kock pouch after radical cystectomy.', 'Ileal versus sigmoid neobladder as bladder substitute after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Sigma-rectum pouch (Mainz pouch II).', 'Urinary undiversion from a sigma-rectum pouch to a cutaneous urinary stoma as a treatment for severe metabolic disorders post-radical cystectomy: A case report.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed our past 100 consecutive series of radical prostatectomy performed between February 2010 and April 2012 at our institution. Their TRUS Bx and MRI results were compared with the pathology of the radical prostatectomy specimens. For tumor localization, we calculated the accuracies in unilateral diseases, bilateral diseases, overall accuracies and Cohen Kappa concordance coefficient of TRUS Bx, MRI and their combination. For the assessment of extra-capsular extension, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, overall accuracy, likelihood ratio positive and likelihood ratio negative of MRI.  Results:   Eighty-two percent of our radical prostatectomy specimens had bilateral tumor involvement and 32% had extra-capsular extension. The accuracies of TRUS Bx in unilateral disease, bilateral disease and overall accuracy were 15.2%, 91.4% and 43.6%, respectively. The accuracies of MRI in unilateral disease, bilateral disease and overall accuracy were 11.1%, 66.7% and 38.9%, respectively. When combining the assessment of TRUS Bx and MRI, the accuracies in unilateral disease, bilateral disease and overall accuracy were 16.7%, 75% and 55.6%, respectively. The Cohen Kappa concordance co-efficient of TRUS Bx, MRI, and combination of them were 0.1165, -0.2047 and -0.1084, respectively. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, likelihood ratio positive and likelihood ratio negative of MRI in assessing extra-capsular extension were 33.3%, 69.8%, 5.9%, 94.9%, 67.9%, 1.16 and 0.99, respectively.  Conclusion:   TRUS Bx, MRI, and their combination had poor concordance and limited accuracies in assessment of the laterality of tumor involvement. The combination of TRUS Bx and MRI offered a better of accuracy when compared to either modality alone.

We investigated the antitumor mechanism of Tanshinone I to sensitize prostate cancer cells to TRAIL. Comibination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL exerted synergistic cytotoxicity, increased cleaved PARP, sub G1 population, the number of TUNELpositive cells, activated caspase 8, 9 and ROS production in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Of note, combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL enhanced the protein expression of death receptor 5 (DR5) and attenuated anti-apoptotic proteins. RT-PCR and RT-qPCR analyses confirmed that co-treatment of Tanshinone I and TRAIL up-regulated DR5 and microRNA 135a-3p at mRNA level or activity of DR5 promoter and attenuated phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinases in PC-3. Conversely, the silencing of DR5 blocked the increased cytotoxicity, sub G1 population and PARP cleavages induced by co-treatment of Tanshinone I and TRAIL. Interestingly, miR135a-3p mimic enhanced DR5 at mRNA, increased PARP cleavage, Bax and the number of TUNEL positive cells in Tanshinone I and TRAIL cotreated PC-3.

Design:   Content analysis using the Nexis newspaper article database.  Setting:   UK 2011-2012.  Outcome measures:   Annual number and ranking, monthly proportions and subject of articles on breast, lung, bowel and prostate cancers.  Results:   9178 articles were identified during 2011 and 2012 featuring breast (4237), prostate (1757), lung (1746) and bowel (1438) cancer. Peaks in monthly proportions above the 99% upper confidence limit were identified for each. Breast cancer had the highest coverage of 12% and 17% during its awareness month. Smaller peaks (11%) were identified during Bowel Cancer Awareness month. Prostate cancer received high coverage in relation to the case of the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing who had been diagnosed with the cancer, and lung cancer in relation to the deaths of celebrities. Breast cancer was covered most often overall and by newspaper category while the lower coverage of other cancer types did not consistently mirror the relative number of new cases each year. The peaks by newspaper category were similar to the overall coverage with few exceptions.  Conclusions:   UK newspaper coverage of common cancer types other than of the breast appears under-represented relative to their population burden. Coverage of breast cancer and bowel cancer appears to be influenced by their awareness months, while that of prostate cancer and lung cancer is influenced by other media stories. Health-promoting public bodies and campaigners could learn from the success of Breast Cancer Awareness Month and work more closely with journalists to ensure that the relevant messages reach wider audiences.""","""['Julie Konfortion', 'Ruth H Jack', 'Elizabeth A Davies']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Influence of medical journal press releases on the quality of associated newspaper coverage: retrospective cohort study.', 'What the newspapers say about medication adherence: a content analysis.', 'What cancer research makes the news?

Here, we examined survivin expression and confirmed abundant survivin expression in bladder cancer cells. This expression pattern indicated that the transcriptional regulatory elements that control survivin expression could be utilized to discriminate cancer from normal cells. We therefore generated a novel adenovirus termed Ad5/35E1apsurvivinE4 with the following characteristics: 1) E1A and E4 protein expression was dependent on survivin promoter activity; 2) the green fluorescence protein gene was inserted into the genome under the control of the CMV promoter; 3) most of the E3 sequences were deleted, but the construct was still capable of expressing the adenovirus death protein with potent cytotoxic effects; and 4) the fiber knob was from serotype 35 adenovirus. As expected from the abundant survivin expression observed in bladder cancer cells, Ad5/35E1apsurvivinE4 replicated better in cancer cells than in normal cells by a factor of 106 to 102. Likewise, Ad5/35E1apsurvivinE4 exerted greater cytotoxic effects on all bladder cancer cell lines tested. Importantly, Ad5/35E1apsurvivinE4 inhibited the growth of Ku7-Luc orthotopic xenografts in nude mice.

Patients underwent MR imaging and venipuncture at baseline, midtreatment, and posttreatment visits. We performed mixed effects modeling of the mean proton density fat fraction (PDFF[%]) by linear time, treatment, and vertebral column region (lumbar [L]4-sacral [S]2 vs thoracic [T]10-L3 vs cervical[C]3-T9), while controlling for cumulative mean dose and other confounders. Spearman rank correlations were performed by white blood cell (WBC) counts versus the differences in PDFF(%) before and after treatment.  Results:   Cumulative mean dose was associated with a 0.43% per Gy (P=.004) increase in PDFF(%). In the highly myelotoxic group, we observed significant changes in PDFF(%) per visit within L4-S2 (10.1%, P<.001) and within T10-L3 (3.93%, P=.01), relative to the reference C3-T9. In the less myelotoxic group, we did not observe significant changes in PDFF(%) per visit according to region. Within L4-S2, we observed a significant difference between treatment groups in the change in PDFF(%) per visit (5.36%, P=.04). Rank correlations of the inverse log differences in WBC versus the differences in PDFF(%) overall and within T10-S2 ranged from 0.69 to 0.78 (P<.05).

Methods:   A total of 129 male patients were enrolled and divided into either study group (N.=102) or control group (N.=27). The study group received a 21-day treatment with ofloxacin 400 mg/day, while the control group did not receive any treatment. tPSA and free PSA levels were measured on the 7th, 14th and 21st day, and at the 3rd, 6th, and 12th month of the study. tPSA levels and the number of patients whose tPSA levels decreased ≤4.0 ng/dL levels was recorded and analyzed for statistical significance.  Results:   At 7, 14, and 21 days mean tPSA values were all lower than baseline values and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). Of 102 patients 31, 38 and 36 patients had decreased tPSA levels at 7, 14, and 21 days, respectively.

Sixty-six patients had persistently high tPSA levels and 64 of them underwent prostate biopsy. Prostate cancer was detected in 8 of them (12.5%).  Conclusions:   A seven-day course of antibiotherapy is enough to normalize PSA levels in gray-zone patients.

Here, we demonstrate that human ZIP9 expressed in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells and stably overexpressed in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells (PC-3-ZIP9) also displays the ligand binding and signaling characteristics of a specific, high-affinity mAR. Testosterone treatment of MDA-MB-468 and PC-3-ZIP9 cells caused activation of G proteins and second messenger pathways as well as increases in intracellular free zinc concentrations that were accompanied by induction of apoptosis. [1,2,6,7-(3)H]-testosterone binding and these responses were abrogated in MDA-MB-468 cells after ZIP9 small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment and absent in PC-3 cells transfected with empty vector, confirming that ZIP9 functions as an mAR. Testosterone treatment caused up-regulation of proapoptotic genes Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein), p53 (tumor protein p53), and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) in both cell lines and increased expression of Bax, Caspase 3, and cytochrome C proteins. Treatment with a zinc chelator or a MAPK inhibitor blocked testosterone-induced increases in Bax, p53, and JNK mRNA expression. The results suggest that both androgen signaling and zinc transporter functions of ZIP9 mediate testosterone promotion of apoptosis. ZIP9 is widely expressed in human tissues and up-regulated in malignant breast and prostate tissues, suggesting that it is a potential therapeutic target for treating breast and prostate cancers. These results provide the first evidence for a mechanism mediated by a single protein through which steroid and zinc signaling pathways interact to regulate physiological functions in mammalian cells.""","""['Peter Thomas', 'Yefei Pang', 'Jing Dong', 'A Håkan Berg']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Unzipping androgen action through ZIP9: a novel membrane androgen receptor.', 'Re: Identification and characterization of membrane androgen receptors in the ZIP9 zinc transporter subfamily: II.

We focused on transcriptional activity of AR to investigate the toxicity of cadmium exposure on human prostate cell lines. Cadmium increased the proliferative index of LNCaP and the proliferative effect was obstructed significantly by AR blocking agent. In luciferase assay, cadmium activated the transcriptional activity of AR in 293T cells co-transfected with wild-type AR and an ARE (AR response elements)-luciferase reporter gene. Cadmium also increased expression of PSA, a downstream gene of AR, whereas the metal had no significant effect on AR amount. AR is regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications including SUMOylation. SUMOylated AR shows a lower transcriptional activity. SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) decreases AR SUMOylation by deconjugating AR-SUMO covalent bond. We detected that cadmium increased the amount of SENP1 in a dose and time dependent manner. Knocking down of SENP1 by RNAi led to decrease of PSA expression and transcriptional activity of AR in luciferase assay. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) results showed that SUMOylation level of AR was decreased after cadmium treatment.

The present study evaluated the association between the Axin2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2240308 [guanine (G)/adenine (A)] and the incidence of prostate cancer. In total, 103 patients with prostate cancer and 100 cancer-free control males were included in this case-control study, and were genotyped using the genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples. The results revealed a higher incidence of prostate cancer in the subjects with the homozygous GG genotype and a reduced cancer incidence in the patients with the GA genotype of the rs2240308 SNP (G/A) in the Axin2 gene. The adjusted odds ratio for carriers with the GA genotype was 0.377 (95% CI, 0.206-0.688; P=0.001) and that for the AA genotype was 0.830 (95% CI, 0.309-2.232; P=0.712) compared with the GG genotype. Therefore, the GA genotype was found to exhibit a protective effect that decreased the risk of prostate cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the significant association between this SNP (rs2240308, G/A) and the risk of prostate cancer. This association indicates the possibility that the variations in the Axin2 gene in this position may play a significant role in promoting the development of cancer in the prostate.

Methods:   A search of the scientific literature available in the PubMed/Medline was conducted for studies on metabolism and mitochondrial function related to gametogenesis, early development, stem cells and cancers in the reproductive system, notably breast, prostate, ovarian and testicular cancers.  Results:   Both PSCs and some types of cancer cells, particularly reproductive cancers, were found to obtain energy mostly by glycolysis, often reducing mitochondrial activity and oxidative phosphorylation. This strategy links proliferating cells, allowing for the biosynthesis reactions necessary for cell division. Interventions that affect metabolic pathways, and force cells to change their preferences, can lead to shifts in cell status, increasing either pluripotency or differentiation of stem cells, and causing cancer cells to become more or less aggressive. Interestingly metabolic changes in many cases seemed to lead to cell transformation, not necessarily follow it, suggesting a direct role of metabolic choices in influencing the (epi)genetic program of different cell types.  Conclusions:   There are uncanny similarities between PSCs and cancer cells at the metabolic level. Furthermore, metabolism may also play a direct role in cell status and targeting metabolic pathways could therefore be a promising strategy for both the control of cancer cell proliferation and the regulation of stem cell physiology, in terms of manipulating stem cells toward relevant phenotypes that may be important for tissue engineering, or making cancer cells become less tumorigenic.""","""['Sandro L Pereira', 'Ana Sofia Rodrigues', 'Maria Inês Sousa', 'Marcelo Correia', 'Tânia Perestrelo', 'João Ramalho-Santos']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Hum Reprod Update""","""['Metabolism in embryonic and cancer stemness.', 'Distinct requirements for energy metabolism in mouse primordial germ cells and their reprogramming to embryonic germ cells.', 'Connecting Mitochondria, Metabolism, and Stem Cell Fate.', 'Regulation of mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism by protein kinase C-λ/ι: a novel mode of balancing pluripotency.', 'Revisiting Mitochondrial Function and Metabolism in Pluripotent Stem Cells: Where Do We Stand in Neurological Diseases?', 'Glycolytic Profiling of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESCs).', 'Oxidative Stress in Reproduction: A Mitochondrial Perspective.', 'Remodeling of mitochondrial morphology and function: an emerging hallmark of cellular reprogramming.', 'MAGE cancer-testis antigens protect the mammalian germline under environmental stress.', 'Dysregulation of Nrf2/Keap1 Redox Pathway in Diabetes Affects Multipotency of Stromal Cells.']"""

Methods:   Men without prostate cancer history (n = 1,744) were selected from the European Male Ageing Study cohort of 40 to 79-year-old men from eight different European centers.

In the present study, we investigated whether similar effects are seen following inhibition of the endocannabinoid hydrolytic enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL).  Results:   CB1 receptor expression levels were found to differ greatly between two experimental series conducted using PC-3 cells. The monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor JZL184 increased levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol in the PC-3 cells without producing changes in the levels of anandamide and related N-acylethanolamines. In the first series of experiments, JZL184 produced a small mitogenic effect for cells that had not been treated with EGF, whereas an anti-proliferative effect was seen for EGF-treated cells. An anti-proliferative effect for the EGF-treated cells was also seen with the CB receptor agonist CP55,940. In the second batch of cells, there was an interaction between JZL184 and CB1 receptor expression densities in linear regression analyses with EGFR expression as the dependent variable.

Results:   Bone density in all metastases increased significantly by 28.3% (IQR 11.4-139.0) and 80.3% (IQR 32.6-250.6) after 3 and 6 months in group A (both p < 0.01). The bone density in group A was significantly increased compared to control group after 3 and 6months (both p < 0.01, median 59.7; IQR 21.1-98.3 and median 62.9; IQR -9.7 to 161.7). The bone density data in group B showed no significant increase over the course of time (p = 0.289, median 5.5, IQR 0.0-62.2 and p = 0.057, median 52.1, IQR 0.0-162.7). 23.3% of the patients in group A and 30.0% of the patients in group B had pathological fractures, no fracture was assigned to intervention, and no difference between groups after 3 and 6 months was observed (p = 0.592 and p = 0.604).  Conclusions:   Our trial demonstrated that resistance training concomitant to RT can improve bone density in spinal bone metastases. This combined treatment is effective, practicable, and without side effects for patients. Importantly, the pathological fracture rate in the intervention group was not increased. The results offer a rationale for future large controlled investigations to confirm these findings.

One of the main reasons for the failure of radiotherapy in prostate cancer is radioresistance and further dissemination of surviving cells. In this study, exposure of four metastasis-derived human prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC-3, LNCaP and 22RV1) to clinically relevant daily fractions of ionizing radiation (35 doses of 2 Gy) resulted in generation of two radiation-surviving populations: adherent senescent-like cells expressing common senescence-associated markers and non-adherent anoikis-resistant stem cell-like cells with active Notch signaling and expression of stem cell markers CD133, Oct-4, Sox2 and Nanog. While a subset of the radiation-surviving adherent cells resumed proliferation shortly after completion of the irradiation regimen, the non-adherent cells started to proliferate only on their reattachment several weeks after the radiation-induced loss of adhesion. Like the parental non-irradiated cells, radiation-surviving re-adherent DU145 cells were tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice. The radiation-induced loss of adhesion was dependent on expression of Snail, as siRNA/shRNA-mediated knockdown of Snail prevented cell detachment. On the other hand, survival of the non-adherent cells required active Erk signaling, as chemical inhibition of Erk1/2 by a MEK-selective inhibitor or Erk1/2 knockdown resulted in anoikis-mediated death in the non-adherent cell fraction. Notably, whereas combined inhibition of Erk and PI3K-Akt signaling triggered cell death in the non-adherent cell fraction and blocked proliferation of the adherent population of the prostate cancer cells, such combined treatment had only marginal if any impact on growth of control normal human diploid cells. These results contribute to better understanding of radiation-induced stress response and heterogeneity of human metastatic prostate cancer cells, document treatment-induced plasticity and phenotypically distinct cell subsets, and suggest the way to exploit their differential sensitivity to radiosensitizing drugs in overcoming radioresistance.""","""['L Kyjacova', 'S Hubackova', 'K Krejcikova', 'R Strauss', 'H Hanzlikova', 'R Dzijak', 'T Imrichova', 'J Simova', 'M Reinis', 'J Bartek', 'Z Hodny']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Death Differ""","""['Interferon-regulated suprabasin is essential for stress-induced stem-like cell conversion and therapy resistance of human malignancies.', 'Snail promotes cell migration through PI3K/AKT-dependent Rac1 activation as well as PI3K/AKT-independent pathways during prostate cancer progression.', 'Key role of MEK/ERK pathway in sustaining tumorigenicity and in vitro radioresistance of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma stem-like cell population.', 'Intracellular signaling pathways regulating radioresistance of human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Disruption of MEK/ERK/c-Myc signaling radiosensitizes prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'SOX2 Promotes Radioresistance in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer by Regulating Tumor Cells Dedifferentiation.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Radioresistance Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines Surviving Ultra-Hypo-Fractionated EBRT: Implications and Possible Clinical Applications.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: The Role of CD133.', 'A cellular senescence-related gene prognostic index for biochemical recurrence and drug resistance in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

In addition to increased glycolytic flux, exploited for cancer imaging with (18)F-FDG, tumor cells display aberrant lipid metabolism. Pivalic acid is a short-chain, branched carboxylic acid used to increase oral bioavailability of prodrugs. After prodrug hydrolysis, pivalic acid undergoes intracellular metabolism via the fatty acid oxidation pathway. We have designed a new probe, 3-(18)F-fluoro-2,2-dimethylpropionic acid, also called (18)F-fluoro-pivalic acid ((18)F-FPIA), for the imaging of aberrant lipid metabolism and cancer detection.  Methods:   Cell intrinsic uptake of (18)F-FPIA was measured in murine EMT6 breast adenocarcinoma cells. In vivo dynamic imaging, time course biodistribution, and radiotracer stability testing were performed. (18)F-FPIA tumor retention was further compared in vivo to (18)F-FDG uptake in several xenograft models and inflammatory tissue.  Results:   (18)F-FPIA rapidly accumulated in EMT6 breast cancer cells, with retention of intracellular radioactivity predicted to occur via a putative (18)F-FPIA carnitine-ester. The radiotracer was metabolically stable to degradation in mice. In vivo imaging of implanted EMT6 murine and BT474 human breast adenocarcinoma cells by (18)F-FPIA PET showed rapid and extensive tumor localization, reaching 9.1% ± 0.5% and 7.6% ± 1.2% injected dose/g, respectively, at 60 min after injection. Substantial uptake in the cortex of the kidney was seen, with clearance primarily via urinary excretion. Regarding diagnostic utility, uptake of (18)F-FPIA was comparable to that of (18)F-FDG in EMT6 tumors but superior in the DU145 human prostate cancer model (54% higher uptake; P = 0.002). Furthermore, compared with (18)F-FDG, (18)F-FPIA had lower normal-brain uptake resulting in a superior tumor-to-brain ratio (2.5 vs. 1.3 in subcutaneously implanted U87 human glioma tumors; P = 0.001), predicting higher contrast for brain cancer imaging.

The Bone Scan Index (BSI) measures the tumor burden on the skeleton, expressed as a percentage of the total skeletal mass. Previous studies have shown that BSI is associated with survival of prostate cancer patients. The objective in this study was to investigate to what extent regional BSI measurements, as obtained by an automated method, can improve the survival analysis for advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   The automated method for analyzing bone scan images computed BSI values for twelve skeletal regions, in a study population consisting of 1013 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. In the survival analysis we used the standard Cox proportional hazards model and a more advanced non-linear method based on artificial neural networks. The concordance index (C-index) was used to measure the performance of the models.  Results:   A Cox model with age and total BSI obtained a C-index of 70.4%. The best Cox model with regional measurements from Costae, Pelvis, Scapula and the Spine, together with age, got a similar C-index (70.5%). The overall best single skeletal localisation, as measured by the C-index, was Costae. The non-linear model performed equally well as the Cox model, ruling out any significant non-linear interactions among the regional BSI measurements.  Conclusion:   The present study showed that the localisation of bone metastases obtained from the bone scans in prostate cancer patients does not improve the performance of the survival models compared to models using the total BSI.

Most of these elements are retrotransposons, DNA sequences that can insert copies of themselves into new genomic locations by a ""copy and paste"" mechanism. These mobile genetic elements play important roles in shaping genomes during evolution, and have been implicated in the etiology of many human diseases. Despite their abundance and diversity, few studies investigated the regulation of endogenous retrotransposons at the genome-wide scale, primarily because of the technical difficulties of uniquely mapping high-throughput sequencing reads to repetitive DNA.  Results:   Here we develop a new computational method called RepEnrich to study genome-wide transcriptional regulation of repetitive elements. We show that many of the Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons in humans are transcriptionally active in a cell line-specific manner. Cancer cell lines display increased RNA Polymerase II binding to retrotransposons than cell lines derived from normal tissue. Consistent with increased transcriptional activity of retrotransposons in cancer cells we found significantly higher levels of L1 retrotransposon RNA expression in prostate tumors compared to normal-matched controls.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate this new algorithm and to compare it to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for various disease sites by creating single- and double-arc VMAT plans.  Methods:   A total of 162 plans were evaluated in this study, including 38 endometrial, 57 head and neck, 12 brain, 10 breast and 45 prostate cancer cases. The real-life IMRT plans were developed during routine clinical cases using the TPS Eclipse. VMAT plans were generated using a preclinical version of Eclipse with tumor-region-specific optimizing templates without interference of the operator: with one full arc (1A) and with two full arcs (2A), and with partial arcs for breast and prostate with hip implant cases. All plans were evaluated based on target coverage, homogeneity and conformity. The organs at risk (OARs) were analyzed according to plan objectives, such as the mean and maximum doses. If one or more objectives were exceeded, the plan was considered clinically unacceptable, and a second VMAT plan was created by adapting the optimization penalties once.  Results:   Compared to IMRT, single- and double-arc VMAT plans showed comparable or better results concerning the target coverage: the maximum dose in the target for 1A is the same as that for IMRT; for 2A, an average reduction of 1.3% over all plans was observed. The conformity showed a statistically significant improvement for both 1A (+3%) and 2A (+6%). The mean total body dose was statistically significant lower for the considered arc techniques (IMRT: 16.0 Gy, VMAT: 15.3 Gy, p < 0.001). However, the sparing of OARs shows individual behavior that depends strongly on the different tumor regions.

We examined the risk among NSAID users in 78 615 men in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial.  Methods:   We obtained information on NSAID prescription usage from Finnish nationwide prescription database and on over-the-counter use by a questionnaire. Prostate cancer cases were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry.  Results:   Prostate cancer risk was elevated among current NSAID prescription users irrespective of screening (hazard ratio (HR)=1.45, confidence interval (95% CI)=1.33-1.59 and HR=1.71, 95% CI=1.58-1.86 in the screening and control arm, respectively), but not for previous use of NSAIDs. The risk increase was similar among coxib and acetaminophen current users, and stronger for metastatic prostate cancer (HR=2.41, 95% CI=1.59-3.67 and HR=3.44, 95% CI=2.60-4.55 in the screening and control arm, respectively). Previous use of NSAIDs, aspirin use and over-the-counter NSAID usage were not associated with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Differing association for current and previous use suggests that the risk increase is unlikely to be directly caused by the medication, but may be due to the conditions indicating NSAID prescription usage, such as symptoms of undiagnosed prostate cancer. To reduce inconsistency between the study outcomes, future epidemiological studies on NSAID use and prostate cancer risk should assess the indications for NSAID usage.""","""['T Veitonmäki', 'T J Murtola', 'L Määttänen', 'K Taari', 'U-H Stenman', 'T L J Tammela', 'A Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Outcomes of Prostate-specific Antigen-based Prostate Cancer Screening Among Men Using Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs.', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Cancer Death in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prostate cancer survival in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and bladder cancer: a pooled analysis.', 'Effect of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on prostate cancer incidence and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Investigating the Anti-inflammatory Effect of Allopurinol on the Prevention of Prostate Cancer.', 'Precision intervention for prostate cancer: Re-evaluating who is at risk.', 'Pharmacoepidemiological Evaluation in Prostate Cancer-Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them.', 'Application of Anti-Inflammatory Agents in Prostate Cancer.', 'Chronic inflammatory diseases, anti-inflammatory medications and risk of prostate cancer: a population-based case-control study.']"""

Although studies on physical activity (PA) and prevalent BPH-related outcomes suggest that PA may protect against the development of this common condition, only a few studies have examined the relation between PA and incident BPH-related outcomes and LUTS with mixed findings. In addition, although nocturia is the most commonly reported and most bothersome LUTS in men with or without evidence of BPH, few studies have examined the association of PA and nocturia independent of BPH. The purpose of this analysis was to examine the association of PA with BPH-related outcomes and nocturia in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening trial.  Methods:   We examined this association with both prevalent (n = 28,404) and incident (n = 4710) BPH-related outcomes (measured by self-report of physician diagnosis, BPH surgery, finasteride use, and clinical indicators) and nocturia. Poisson regression with robust variance was used to calculate prevalence ratios and relative risks.  Results:   PA was weakly positively associated with several prevalent BPH-related outcomes and was strongly inversely associated with prevalent nocturia. In incident analyses, PA was only associated with nocturia. Men who were active ≥1 h·wk(-1) were 13% less likely (95% confidence interval, 2%-22%) to report nocturia and 34% less likely (95% confidence interval, 15%-49%) to report severe nocturia as compared with men who reported no PA. The associations were similar for men with and without additional BPH-related outcomes, except for prevalent nocturia, where the association was stronger for men without other BPH-related outcomes.  Conclusions:   Combined with other management strategies, PA may provide a strategy for the management of BPH-related outcomes, particularly nocturia.""","""['Kathleen Y Wolin', 'Robert L Grubb rd', 'Ratna Pakpahan', 'Lawrence Ragard', 'Jerome Mabie', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'Siobhan Sutcliffe']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Sci Sports Exerc""","""['Body size throughout the life-course and incident benign prostatic hyperplasia-related outcomes and nocturia.', 'Sexually transmitted infections, benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptom-related outcomes: results from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia-related outcomes and nocturia in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Pygeum africanum for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Serenoa repens for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The Prostate-Associated Gene 4 (PAGE4) Could Play a Role in the Development of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia under Oxidative Stress.', 'Body size throughout the life-course and incident benign prostatic hyperplasia-related outcomes and nocturia.', 'Prevalence, Burden, and Treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Men Aged 50 and Older: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Co-Occurrence of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Frailty among Community-Dwelling Older Men.', 'Measurement of autophagy flux in benign prostatic hyperplasia in\xa0vitro.']"""

However, not all of these cases will evolve to biochemical (BCR) or clinical (CR) recurrence, therefore relationship between PSMs and these recurrent events has to be correlated with other clinical and pathologic findings to indicate complementary treatment for selected patients.  Materials and methods:   Of 1250 patients submitted to open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP), between March 1991 and June 2008, the outcome of 161 patients with PSMs and of 67 without PSMs as a control group, comprising a total of 228 cases were retrospectively reviewed. A minimum follow-up time of 2 years after surgery was considered. BCR was determined when PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL. CR was determined whenever there was clinical evidence of tumor. Chi-square test was used to correlate clinical and pathologic variables with PSMs. Time interval to biochemical recurrence was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier product limit analysis using the log-rank test for comparison between groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox stepwise logistic regression models were used to identify significant predictors of risk of shorter intervals to BCR.  Results:   Prostate circumference margin was the most common site with 78 cases (48.44%). Regarding the outcome of 228 cases from both groups, BCR occurred in 68 patients (29.82%), and CR in 10 (4.38%). Univariate analysis showed statistically significant associations (p < 0.001) between presence of PSMs with BCR, but not with CR (p = 0.05). At follow-up of the 161 patients with PSMs, only 61(37.8%) presented BCR, while 100 (62.8%) did not. BCR correlated with pathologic stage; Gleason score; preoperative PSA; tumor volume in the specimen; capsular and perineural invasion; presence and number of PSMs. CR correlated only with angiolymphatic invasion and Gleason score. Considering univariate analysis of clinical and pathologic factors predicting progression-free survival at 5 years, prostate weight; preoperative PSA; Gleason score; pathologic stage; tumor volume; PSMs; capsular and perineural invasion were correlated with BCR. At multivariate analysis, only Gleason score and percentage of tumor volume correlated as significant independent predictors of BCR.  Conclusion:   At univariate analysis, presence, number and location of PSMs have consistent correlation with BCR after RRP, but at follow-up BCR occurred only in 37.8% of patients with PSMs. However at multivariate analysis, the significant risk factors for BCR were percentage of tumor volume (p = 0.022) and Gleason score (p < 0.005) in the surgical specimen.

Methods:   A 2-arm randomized controlled trial was used to compare booklet patient decision aid (intervention group n = 61) with standard information for localized prostate cancer (control group n = 61). The study was conducted at 3 hospitals between 2011 and 2013. The main outcome measures were knowledge, decisional conflict, satisfaction with the decision-making process, and coping.

SSTR2 expression is differentially regulated in various tumor types and therapeutic somatostatin analogs binding to SSTR2 are in clinical use. In prostate cancers highly contradictory results in terms of SSTR2 expression and its consequences have been published over the past years. The aim of this study was to clarify prevalence and clinical significance of SSTR2 expression in prostate cancer. Therefore, quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a tissue microarray containing samples from 3,261 prostate cancer patients with extensive clinical and molecular cancer characteristics and oncological follow-up data was performed. IHC data was compared to publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus datasets of human prostate cancer gene expression arrays. While membranous SSTR2 staining was always seen in normal prostate epithelium, SSTR2 staining was absent in more than half (56.1%) of 2,195 interpretable prostate cancer samples. About 13% of all analyzed prostate cancers showed moderate to strong cytoplasmic and membranous SSTR2 staining. Staining intensities were inversely correlated with high Gleason grade, advanced pT category, high tumor cell proliferation (p<0.0001 each), high pre-operative PSA levels, (p = 0.0011) and positive surgical margins (p = 0.006). In silico analysis confirmed lower SSTR2 gene expression in prostate cancers vs. normal adjacent tissue (p = 0.0424), prostate cancer metastases vs. primary cancers (p = 0.0011) and recurrent vs. non-recurrent prostate cancers (p = 0.0438). PSA-free survival gradually declined with SSTR2 staining intensity (p<0.0001). SSTR2-negative cancers were more likely to develop metastases over time (p<0.05). In conclusion, most prostate cancers are indeed SSTR2-negative and loss of SSTR2 strongly predicts an unfavorable tumor phenotype and poor prognosis. Therefore, SSTR2 expression seems an important factor in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and re-introduction of the receptor in SSTR2-negative prostate cancers may feature a promising target for novel gene therapy approaches.""","""['Jan K Hennigs', 'Julia Müller', 'Matti Adam', 'Joshua M Spin', 'Emilia Riedel', 'Markus Graefen', 'Carsten Bokemeyer', 'Guido Sauter', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Sarah Minner']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Subcellular Compartmentalization of Survivin is Associated with Biological Aggressiveness and Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) characterizes an aggressive subset of prostate cancers and predicts patient prognosis independently from pre- and postoperatively assessed clinicopathological parameters.', 'High-level expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 12 is a strong and independent predictor of poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Increased Cytoplasmic CD138 Expression Is Associated with Aggressive Characteristics in Prostate Cancer and Is an Independent Predictor for Biochemical Recurrence.', 'Comprehensive Assessment of Somatostatin Receptors in Various Neoplasms: A Systematic Review.', 'Molecular Imaging of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer by Targeting Delta-Like Ligand 3.', 'Epigenetic regulation of somatostatin and somatostatin receptors in neuroendocrine tumors and other types of cancer.', 'Unleashing the Diagnostic, Prognostic and Therapeutic Potential of the Neuronostatin/GPR107 System in Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of Somatostatin and CXCR4 Receptor Expression in a Large Set of Prostate Cancer Samples Using Tissue Microarrays and Well-Characterized Monoclonal Antibodies.']"""

Additionally, the RM-1 cells were treated with radiation and/or BTV to assess cell viability using the Cell Counting Kit-8 method. The levels of apoptosis of the RM-1 cells were detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To identify a possible mechanism for the radiation-induced change in the oncolytic activity of BTV, cell cycle analyses were performed. The effects of different schedules of BTV and radiotherapy on cytotoxicity were assessed in vitro and the combined effect was also assessed in tumor models in vivo. The results demonstrated that BTV had a selective cytotoxic effect on RM-1 and PC-3 cancer cells, but did not affect normal cells, specifically, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. The combination of BTV and radiation enhanced the cytotoxicity compared with that of each agent alone and had a synergistic effect in vitro and in vivo. The results of the FACS confirmed that radiotherapy induced apoptosis, as did BTV alone, and the combination treatment generated the most prominent levels of apoptosis, which were the highest in the early stage. The analysis of the cell cycle indicated that the G2-M phase levels increased after irradiation followed by infection with BTV. In conclusion, the combination of BTV and radiotherapy had an enhanced cytotoxic effect on RM-1 cells in vitro and in vivo compared with that of either treatment alone, and demonstrated a synergistic efficacy, in addition to a marked apoptosis-inducing effect.

In the experimental group, the U87 and U251 cells exhibited a lower expression level of PI3K protein as compared with the control group (t=6.849; P<0.001). In addition, the two cell lines had a higher expression level of p53 protein in the experimental group as compared with the control group (t=40.810; P<0.001). Protein expression levels of Bcl-xL decreased significantly in the experimental group as compared with the control group (t=19.640; P=0.000).

Brachyury is considered a negative prognostic factor in colon and lung cancer; however, there are no reports on Brachyury's expression in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of Brachyury expression in prostate tumorigenesis using a large series of human prostate samples comprising benign tissue, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, localized tumor, and metastatic tissues. The results obtained were compared with what can be inferred from the Oncomine database. In addition, multiple in vitro models of prostate cancer were used to dissect the biologic role of Brachyury in prostate cancer progression.  Results:   We found that Brachyury is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer and metastatic tumors when compared with normal tissues, both at protein and at mRNA levels. Brachyury expression in the cytoplasm correlates with highly aggressive tumors, whereas the presence of Brachyury in the nucleus is correlated with tumor invasion. We found that Brachyury-positive cells present higher viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion rates than Brachyury-negative cells. Microarray analysis further showed that genes co-expressed with Brachyury are clustered in oncogenic-related pathways, namely cell motility, cell-cycle regulation, and cell metabolism.  Conclusions:   Collectively, the present study suggests that Brachyury plays an important role in prostate cancer aggressiveness and points, for the first time, to Brachyury as a significant predictor of poor prostate cancer prognosis. Our work paves the way for future studies assessing Brachyury as a possible prostate cancer therapeutic target.""","""['Filipe Pinto', 'Nelma Pértega-Gomes', 'Márcia S Pereira', 'José R Vizcaíno', 'Pedro Monteiro', 'Rui M Henrique', 'Fátima Baltazar', 'Raquel P Andrade', 'Rui M Reis']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: Brachyury--a biomarker for progression and prognosis?', 'Aberrant expression of the embryonic transcription factor brachyury in human tumors detected with a novel rabbit monoclonal antibody.', 'Expression of Brachyury gene is a significant prognostic factor for primary lung carcinoma.', 'The human T-box mesodermal transcription factor Brachyury is a candidate target for T-cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy.', 'Brachyury oncogene is a prognostic factor in high-risk testicular germ cell tumors.', 'The Roles of Embryonic Transcription Factor BRACHYURY in Tumorigenesis and Progression.', 'Plasma cell-free DNA methylome profiling in pre- and post-surgery oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Knockdown of Brachyury Suppresses Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration via Targeting E2F3.', 'Cauda equina neuroendocrine tumors show biological features distinct from other paragangliomas and visceral neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Brachyury promotes proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma via facilitating the transcription of NCAPG2.', 'Multiple malignant tumors in a patient with familial chordoma, a case report.']"""

Among the contributors to castration-resistant PCa are AR splice variants that lack the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Instead, they have small amounts of unique sequence derived from cryptic exons or from out of frame translation. The AR-V7 (or AR3) variant is constitutively active and is expressed under conditions consistent with CRPC. AR-V7 is reported to regulate a transcriptional program that is similar but not identical to that of AR. However, it is unknown whether these differences are due to the unique sequence in AR-V7, or simply to loss of the LBD. To examine transcriptional regulation by AR-V7, we have used lentiviruses encoding AR-V7 (amino acids 1-627 of AR with the 16 amino acids unique to the variant) to prepare a derivative of the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells with inducible expression of AR-V7. An additional cell line was generated with regulated expression of AR-NTD (amino acids 1-660 of AR); this mutant lacks the LBD but does not have the AR-V7 specific sequence. We find that AR and AR-V7 have distinct activities on target genes that are co-regulated by FOXA1. Transcripts regulated by AR-V7 were similarly regulated by AR-NTD, indicating that loss of the LBD is sufficient for the observed differences. Differential regulation of target genes correlates with preferential recruitment of AR or AR-V7 to specific cis-regulatory DNA sequences providing an explanation for some of the observed differences in target gene regulation.""","""['William C Krause', 'Ayesha A Shafi', 'Manjula Nakka', 'Nancy L Weigel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Differential regulation of metabolic pathways by androgen receptor (AR) and its constitutively active splice variant, AR-V7, in prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms of the androgen receptor splicing in prostate cancer cells.', 'Melatonin Inhibits Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 (AR-V7)-Induced Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Activation and NF-κB Activator-Induced AR-V7 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells: Potential Implications for the Use of Melatonin in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Therapy.', 'Molecular Origin, Expression Regulation, and Biological Function of Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of androgen receptor splice variants, their clinical relevance and treatment options.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor transcriptional activity is required for heregulin-1β-mediated nuclear localization of the HER3/ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase.', 'A role for androgen receptor variant 7 in sensitivity to therapy: Involvement of IGFBP-2 and FOXA1.', 'α-Mangostin Promotes In Vitro and In Vivo Degradation of Androgen Receptor and AR-V7 Splice Variant in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Impact of FKBP52 on cell proliferation and hormone-dependent cancers.']"""

This study aimed to determine whether preserving the endopelvic fascia influences subsequent urinary incontinence.  Material and methods:   Consecutive patients (n = 138) who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) for prostate cancer between October 2010 and June 2012 with a minimum of 1 year follow-up were retrospectively analysed. The subjects were divided into two groups: the non-preserved endopelvic fascia group (nPE group) and the preserved endopelvic fascia group (PE group). Continence was defined as not using any pads and having no urine leakages. Continence rates at set time-points after RALP were compared using the chi-squared test. Continence recovery rates were analysed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Prognostic factors of incontinence were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   The age, body mass index, preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels, prostate volume, estimated blood loss, mean operative time, Gleason score and pathological stage were not significantly different between the two study groups. The continence rate of the nPE group and PE group was 88.4% and 97.1%, respectively, at 12 months after surgery (p = 0.049), which was also significant according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis (p < 0.001). Preservation of endopelvic fascia was the only significant prognostic factor for urinary incontinence (p = 0.002, hazard ratio = 1.867) according to the multivariate analysis.

Trials that examined the effect of vitamin C supplements on cancer risk are few.  Objective:   We examined whether vitamin E or vitamin C supplementation affects the risk of cancer events during posttrial follow-up of the Physicians' Health Study II.  Design:   Beginning in 1997, a total of 14,641 US male physicians aged ≥50 y were randomly assigned to receive 400 IU of vitamin E every other day, 500 mg of vitamin C daily, or their respective placebos. The vitamin E and vitamin C treatment ended in 2007, and observational follow-up continued through June 2011.  Results:   This study included an additional 356 cases of incident prostate cancer and 771 total cancers that developed during a mean (maximum) of 2.8 (3.8) y of posttrial observation. During an overall mean of 10.3 (13.8) y, there were a total of 1373 incident prostate cancers and 2669 total cancers documented. In comparison with placebo, vitamin E supplementation had no effect on the incidence of prostate cancer (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.10) or total cancers (HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.10).

We determined the risk of iatrogenic complication and length of stay (LOS) over time among open and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) patients. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the changes over time and elucidate independent predictors of iatrogenic complications.  Results:   We identified 556,932 and 219,434 prostate cancer patients undergoing open and minimally invasive prostatectomy.

Arachidonic acid and its metabolites contribute to survival and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. We examined whether AKT plays a role in promoting cPLA₂α action in prostate cancer cells. We found a concordant increase in pAKT and cPLA₂α levels in prostate tissue of prostate epithelial-specific PTEN-knockout but not PTEN-wide type mice. Restoration of PTEN expression or inhibition of PI3K action decreased cPLA₂α expression in PTEN-mutated or deleted prostate cancer cells. An increase in AKT by Myr-AKT elevated cPLA₂α protein levels, which could be diminished by inhibition of AKT phosphorylation without noticeable change in total AKT levels. pAKT levels had no influence on cPLA₂α at mRNA levels but reduced cPLA₂α protein degradation.

Since localization of proteins is tightly linked to its function, cancer cells can inactivate function of a tumor suppressor protein through mislocalization. The nuclear exportin CRM1/XPO 1 is upregulated in many cancers. Targeting XPO 1 can lead to nuclear retention of cargo proteins such as p53, Foxo, and BRCA1 leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We demonstrate that selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) can functionally inactivate XPO 1 in prostate cancer cells. Unlike the potent, but toxic, XPO 1 inhibitor leptomycin B, SINE inhibitors (KPT-185, KPT-330, and KPT-251) cause a decrease in XPO 1 protein level through the proteasomal pathway. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with SINE inhibitors lead to XPO 1 inhibition, as evaluated by RevGFP export assay, leading to nuclear retention of p53 and Foxo proteins, consequently, triggering apoptosis. Our data reveal that treatment with SINE inhibitors at nanomolar concentrations results in decrease in proliferation and colonogenic capacity of prostate cancer cells by triggering apoptosis without causing any cell cycle arrest. We further demonstrate that SINE inhibitors can be combined with other chemotherapeutics like doxorubicin to achieve enhanced growth inhibition of prostate cancer cells. Since SINE inhibitors offer increased bioavailability, reduced toxicity to normal cells, and are orally available they can serve as effective therapeutics against prostate cancer. In conclusion, our data reveals that nucleocytoplasmic transport in prostate cancer can be effectively targeted by SINE inhibitors.""","""['Janet Mendonca', 'Anup Sharma', 'Hae-Soo Kim', 'Hans Hammers', 'Alan Meeker', 'Angelo De Marzo', 'Michael Carducci', 'Michael Kauffman', 'Sharon Shacham', 'Sushant Kachhap']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['KPT-330, a potent and selective exportin-1 (XPO-1) inhibitor, shows antitumor effects modulating the expression of cyclin D1 and survivin corrected in prostate cancer models.', 'Anti-tumor activity of selective inhibitors of XPO1/CRM1-mediated nuclear export in diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: the role of survivin.', 'KPT-330 inhibitor of XPO1-mediated nuclear export has anti-proliferative activity in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export sensitizes malignant cells to cytotoxic and targeted agents.', 'Nucleo-cytoplasmic transport as a therapeutic target of cancer.', 'Azacitidine Is Synergistically Lethal with XPO1 Inhibitor Selinexor in Acute Myeloid Leukemia by Targeting XPO1/eIF4E/c-MYC Signaling.', 'The efficacy of selinexor (KPT-330), an XPO1 inhibitor, on non-hematologic cancers: a comprehensive review.', 'Nuclear Export Inhibitor KPT-8602 Synergizes with PARP Inhibitors in Escalating Apoptosis in Castration Resistant Cancer Cells.', 'Melphalan and Exportin 1 Inhibitors Exert Synergistic Antitumor Effects in Preclinical Models of Human Multiple Myeloma.', 'Exportins can inhibit major mitotic assembly events in vitro: membrane fusion, nuclear pore formation, and spindle assembly.']"""

Here we examine this question by profiling an additional 104 primary prostate cancers and updating the initial 168 patient cohort with long-term clinical outcome. We find that CNA burden across the genome, defined as the percentage of the tumor genome affected by CNA, was associated with biochemical recurrence and metastasis after surgery in these two cohorts, independent of the prostate-specific antigen biomarker or Gleason grade, a major existing histopathological prognostic variable in prostate cancer. Moreover, CNA burden was associated with biochemical recurrence in intermediate-risk Gleason 7 prostate cancers, independent of prostate-specific antigen or nomogram score.

When the cancer recurs, early stages can be controlled with hormone ablation therapy to delay the rate of cancer progression but, over time, the cancer overcomes its hormone dependence, becomes highly aggressive and metastasizes. Clinical trials have shown that pomegranate juice (PJ) inhibits PCa progression. We have previously shown that the PJ components luteolin (L), ellagic acid (E) and punicic acid (P) together inhibit growth of hormone-dependent and -independent PCa cells and inhibit their migration and chemotaxis towards CXCL12, a chemokine that is important in PCa metastasis. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that L+E+P inhibit PCa metastasis in vivo. To test this possibility, we used a severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model in which luciferase-expressing human PCa cells were injected subcutaneously near the prostate. Tumor progression was monitored with bioluminescence imaging weekly. We found that L+E+P inhibits PC-3M-luc primary tumor growth, inhibits the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis for metastasis and none of the tumors metastasized. In addition, L+E+P significantly inhibits growth and metastasis of highly invasive Pten (-/-) ;K-ras (G12D) prostate tumors. Furthermore, L+E+P inhibits angiogenesis in vivo, prevents human endothelial cell (EC) tube formation in culture and disrupts preformed EC tubes, indicating inhibition of EC adhesion to each other. L+E+P also inhibits the angiogenic factors interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor as well as their induced signaling pathways in ECs.

In the highly metastatic 4T1 mouse mammary tumor model, a 15% CHO, high protein diet supplemented with celecoxib (1 g/kg chow) markedly reduced lung metastases. Moreover, in longer-term studies using male Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate mice, which are predisposed to metastatic prostate cancer, the 15% CHO diet, with and without celecoxib (0.3 g/kg chow), gave the lowest incidence of metastases, but a more moderate 25% CHO diet containing celecoxib led to the best survival.

Research design:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, we identified 47,517 beneficiaries with localized CaP during 2005-2009 and matched noncancer controls. We employed hierarchical generalized linear models to estimate risk-standardized cancer-related expenditures for each hospital referral region. To identify key contributors to the variation, we sequentially added patient characteristics, treatment intensity (the percentage of patients receiving curative treatments), ancillary procedures (biopsy, hormone therapy, and imaging), and specific treatment modalities into the model. We categorized the expenditures according to the type of services to identify their relative impact on the expenditure variations.  Results:   The mean expenditure on CaP-related care per CaP beneficiary was $15,900, including $1800 on surgery, $11,200 on radiotherapy, and $1900 on ancillary procedures. The expenditure difference between quintiles 5 and 1 was $6200. Patient characteristics explained 8.4% of this difference. Treatment intensity and treatment modalities accounted for an additional 21.2% and 31.2% of the variation, respectively. Between the highest and lowest expenditure quintiles, the difference in radiotherapy expenditure was $5000, whereas that in surgery or ancillary procedures was <$200.  Conclusions:   There is substantial geographic variation in CaP expenditures, and the specific modality of radiotherapy is the most important contributor to this variation.

Although there are no data to support the use of primary androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for early-stage prostate cancer, primary ADT has been widely used for localized prostate cancer, especially among older patients.  Objective:   To determine the long-term survival impact of primary ADT in older men with localized (T1/T2) prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a population-based cohort study of 66,717 Medicare patients 66 years or older diagnosed from 1992 through 2009 who received no definitive local therapy within 180 days of prostate cancer diagnosis. The study was conducted in predefined US geographical areas covered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Instrumental variable analysis was used to assess the impact of primary ADT and control for potential biases associated with unmeasured confounding variables. The instrumental variable comprised combined health services areas with various usage rates of primary ADT. The analysis compared survival outcomes in the top tertile areas with those in the bottom tertile areas.  Main outcomes and measures:   Prostate cancer-specific survival and overall survival.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 110 months, primary ADT was not associated with improved 15-year overall or prostate cancer-specific survival following the diagnosis of localized prostate cancer. Among patients with moderately differentiated cancers, the 15-year overall survival was 20.0% in areas with high primary ADT use vs 20.8% in areas with low use (difference: 95% CI, -2.2% to 0.4%), and the 15-year prostate cancer survival was 90.6% in both high- and low-use areas (difference: 95% CI, -1.1% to 1.2%).

Objective:   To determine the impact of physicians on the management of low-risk prostate cancer with up-front treatment vs observation.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective cohort of men 66 years and older with low-risk prostate cancer diagnosed from 2006 through 2009. Patient and tumor characteristics were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries. The diagnosing urologist, consulting radiation oncologist, cancer-directed therapy, and comorbid medical conditions were determined from linked Medicare claims. Physician characteristics were obtained from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile. Mixed-effects models were used to evaluate management variation and factors associated with observation.  Main outcomes and measures:   No cancer-directed therapy within 12 months of diagnosis (observation).  Results:   A total of 2145 urologists diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer in 12,068 men, of whom 80.1% received treatment and 19.9% were observed. The case-adjusted rate of observation varied widely across urologists, ranging from 4.5% to 64.2% of patients.

PubMed, Embase, and Wanfang databases were searched for published case-control studies investigating the association between APE1 T1349G polymorphism and prostate cancer risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. Overall, seven studies with a total of 3,063 individuals were finally included into the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity analysis did not find obvious heterogeneity among those included studies. Meta-analysis of total seven studies did not find an obvious association between APE1 T1349G polymorphism and prostate cancer risk (G vs T OR (95 % CI) = 1.11 (0.99-1.24); GG vs TT OR (95 % CI) = 1.25 (0.96-1.62); TG vs TT OR (95 % CI) = 1.11 (0.95-1.30); GG/TG vs T OR (95 % CI) = 1.13 (0.97-1.32); GG vs TT/TG OR (95 % CI) = 1.16 (0.91-1.48)).

Methods and materials:   Patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer received 10Gy single-fraction (192)Ir HDRB followed by 50Gy in 20 daily fractions of HypoRT without androgen deprivation therapy. All patients had a minimum 2-year followup. The PB was defined as PSA elevation higher than 0.2ng/mL from previous measurement with subsequent drop to pre-bounce level. The BF was defined as PSA nadir+2ng/mL.  Results:   A total of 114 patients treated between 2001 and 2009 were eligible for analysis. At a median followup of 66 months, the PB was found in 45 (39%) patients with a median time to bounce of 16 months (range, 3-76 months). The median time to PSA normalization after a PB was 9 months (range, 2-40 months). The median magnitude of PB was 0.45ng/mL (range, 0.2-6.62). The BF occurred in 12 (10.5%) patients of whom three had a PB. Median time to BF was 52.5 months. Four patients (3.5%) in the PB group fit the criteria for BF.  Conclusions:   The PB is common after HDRB and HypoRT and can occur up to 76 months after treatment. It can rarely fit the criteria for BF. The time to PB is shorter than the time to BF. There is a lower incidence of BF in patients with a PB.

Objective:   To estimate the harms and benefits of cancer screening by age and comorbid conditions to inform decisions about screening cessation.  Design:   Collaborative modeling with 7 cancer simulation models and common data on average and comorbid condition level-specific life expectancy.  Setting:   U.S. population.  Patients:   U.S. cohorts aged 66 to 90 years in 2010 with average health or 1 of 4 comorbid condition levels: none, mild, moderate, or severe.  Intervention:   Mammography, prostate-specific antigen testing, or fecal immunochemical testing.  Measurements:   Lifetime cancer deaths prevented and life-years gained (benefits); false-positive test results and overdiagnosed cancer cases (harms). For each comorbid condition level, the age at which harms and benefits of screening were similar to that for persons with average health having screening at age 74 years.  Results:   Screening 1000 women with average life expectancy at age 74 years for breast cancer resulted in 79 to 96 (range across models) false-positive results, 0.5 to 0.8 overdiagnosed cancer cases, and 0.7 to 0.9 prevented cancer deaths. Although absolute numbers of harms and benefits differed across cancer sites, the ages at which to cease screening were consistent across models and cancer sites. For persons with no, mild, moderate, and severe comorbid conditions, screening until ages 76, 74, 72, and 66 years, respectively, resulted in harms and benefits similar to average-health persons.  Limitation:   Comorbid conditions influenced only life expectancy.  Conclusion:   Comorbid conditions are an important determinant of harms and benefits of screening. Estimates of screening benefits and harms by comorbid condition can inform discussions between providers and patients about personalizing screening cessation decisions.

Real-time intrafraction prostate motion from 494 treatment sessions, at most 6 min in length, was evaluated using Calypso(®) tracking system.  Results:   The deviation of prostate intrafraction motion distribution was a function of stool/gas volume, especially when stool/gas is located in the anterior part of the rectum. Compared to patients with small anterior stool/gas volumes (<10 cm(3)), those with large volume (10-60 cm(3)) had a twofold increase in 3D prostate motion and interquartile data range within the 6th minute of treatment time. The 10% of the overall CBCT session where large anterior rectal volumes were observed demonstrated larger percentage of time at displacement greater than our proposed internal margin 3 mm.  Conclusion:   Volume and location of stool/gas can directly impact the ERB's intrafraction immobilization ability.

Death from PCa primarily results from metastasis. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4) is overexpressed in invasive PCa lesions in humans, and can be inhibited by small molecule therapeutics that demonstrate favorable activity in phase II studies. However, MAP2K4's role in regulating metastatic behavior is controversial and unknown. To investigate, we engineered human PCa cell lines which overexpress either wild type or constitutive active MAP2K4. Orthotopic implantation into mice demonstrated MAP2K4 increases formation of distant metastasis. Constitutive active MAP2K4, though not wild type, increases tumor size and circulating tumor cells in the blood and bone marrow. Complementary in vitro studies establish stable MAP2K4 overexpression promotes cell invasion, but does not affect cell growth or migration. MAP2K4 overexpression increases the expression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) protein and protease production, with the largest effect upon matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), both in vitro and in mouse tumor samples. Further, MAP2K4-mediated increases in cell invasion are dependent upon heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and MMP-2, but not upon MAP2K4's immediate downstream targets, p38 MAPK or JNK.

We have reported that cavin-1 expression in prostate cancer PC3 cells reduced the abundance of a subset of EV proteins, concomitant with reduced xenograft tumour growth and metastasis.  Methods:   We examined the functional outcomes and mechanisms of cavin-1 expression on PC3-derived EVs (PC3-EVs).  Results:   PC3-EVs were internalized by osteoclast precursor RAW264.7 cells and primary human osteoblasts (hOBs) in vitro, stimulating osteoclastogenesis 37-fold and hOB proliferation 1.5-fold, respectively. Strikin gly, EVs derived from cavin-1-expressing PC3 cells (cavin-1-PC3-EVs) failed to induce multinucleate osteoblasts or hOB proliferation. Cavin-1 was not detected in EVs, indicating an indirect mechanism of action. EV morphology, size and quantity were also not affected by cavin-1 expression, suggesting that cavin-1 modulated EV cargo recruitment rather than release. While cavin-1-EVs had no osteoclastogenic function, they were internalized by RAW264.7 cells but at a reduced efficiency compared to control EVs. EV surface proteins are required for internalization of PC3-EVs by RAW264.7 cells, as proteinase K treatment abolished uptake of both control and cavin-1-PC3-EVs. Removal of sialic acid modifications by neuraminidase treatment increased the amount of control PC3-EVs internalized by RAW264.7 cells, without affecting cavin-1-PC3-EVs. This suggests that cavin-1 expression altered the glycosylation modifications on PC3-EV surface. Finally, cavin-1 expression did not affect EV in vivo tissue targeting as both control and cavin-1-PC3-EVs were predominantly retained in the lung and bone 24 hours after injection into mice.  Discussion:   Taken together, our results reveal a novel pathway for EV cargo sorting, and highlight the potential of utilizing cavin-1-mediated pathways to attenuate metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Kerry L Inder', 'Jayde E Ruelcke', 'Lara Petelin', 'Hyeongsun Moon', 'Eunju Choi', 'James Rae', 'Antje Blumenthal', 'Dietmar Hutmacher', 'Nicholas A Saunders', 'Jennifer L Stow', 'Robert G Parton', 'Michelle M Hill']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Extracell Vesicles""","""['PTRF-cavin-1 expression decreases the migration of PC3 prostate cancer cells: role of matrix metalloprotease 9.', 'Osteoblast-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Are Biological Tools for the Delivery of Active Molecules to Bone.', 'Galectin-3 Overrides PTRF/Cavin-1 Reduction of PC3 Prostate Cancer Cell Migration.', 'Communication of prostate cancer cells with bone cells via extracellular vesicle RNA; a potential mechanism of metastasis.', 'Routes and mechanisms of extracellular vesicle uptake.', 'Exosomes promote hFOB1.19 proliferation and differentiation via LINC00520.', 'Molecular and clinical characterization of PTRF in glioma via 1,022 samples.', 'Androgen-induced exosomal miR-379-5p release determines granulosa cell fate: cellular mechanism involved in polycystic ovaries.', 'Caveolae Mechanotransduction at the Interface between Cytoskeleton and Extracellular Matrix.', 'The biodistribution of placental and fetal extracellular vesicles during pregnancy following placentation.']"""

Materials and methods:   Prostate multiecho T2* was performed in 55 consecutive patients with prostate cancer using a multishot fast-field echo sequence at 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging. T2* mapping was obtained by exponentially fitting the multiecho T2* images pixel by pixel with different echo times for each slice. Generalized estimating equations were used to test the T2* value difference between normal and malignant prostate regions and the association between T2* value and tumor Gleason scores.  Results:   The T2* values of the cancerous prostatic regions (mean: 42.51 ± 0.65 milliseconds) were significantly lower (P < .001) than those of the normal prostatic regions (mean: 74.87 ± 0.99 milliseconds). Adopting a threshold value of 59.27 milliseconds, T2* mapping resulted in 94.8% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity in the identification of prostate cancer. A lower mean T2* value was significantly associated with a higher tumor Gleason score (mean T2* values of 53.53, 43.75, 33.66, and 22.95 milliseconds were associated with Gleason score of 3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, and ≥8, respectively P < .05).

Misalignment results in false-positive and -negative zones as assessed by imaging. We describe a workflow for three-dimensional alignment of prostate imaging data against whole-mount prostatectomy reference specimens and assess its performance against a standard workflow.  Materials and methods:   Ethical approval was granted. Patients underwent motorized transrectal ultrasound (Prostate Histoscanning) to generate a three-dimensional image of the prostate before radical prostatectomy. The test workflow incorporated steps for axial alignment between imaging and histology, size adjustments following formalin fixation, and use of custom-made parallel cutters and digital caliper instruments. The control workflow comprised freehand cutting and assumed homogeneous block thicknesses at the same relative angles between pathology and imaging sections.  Results:   Thirty radical prostatectomy specimens were histologically and radiologically processed, either by an alignment-optimized workflow (n = 20) or a control workflow (n = 10). The optimized workflow generated tissue blocks of heterogeneous thicknesses but with no significant drifting in the cutting plane. The control workflow resulted in significantly nonparallel blocks, accurately matching only one out of four histology blocks to their respective imaging data. The image-to-histology alignment accuracy was 20% greater in the optimized workflow (P < .0001), with higher sensitivity (85% vs. 69%) and specificity (94% vs. 73%) for margin prediction in a 5 × 5-mm grid analysis.

However, limited data are available on the efficacy of enzalutamide following abiraterone in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Objective:   To compare the activity of enzalutamide after abiraterone in docetaxel-experienced and docetaxel-naive mCRPC patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   The British Columbia Cancer Agency Cancer Registry was searched for mCRPC patients who received enzalutamide after prior abiraterone. Clinicopathologic characteristics, confirmed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates (PSA decline ≥ 50% confirmed ≥ 3 wk later), and survival data were collected.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Outcomes on enzalutamide were compared between docetaxel-experienced and docetaxel-naive patients using chi-square for PSA response and log-rank test for time to PSA progression and overall survival (OS). Univariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with confirmed PSA response on enzalutamide, using either chi-square for categorical variables or logistic regression for continuous variables.  Results and limitations:   A total of 115 patients received enzalutamide after abiraterone: 68 had received prior docetaxel and 47 were docetaxel naive. Median time on enzalutamide was 4.1 mo. Confirmed PSA response rates (22% vs 26%; p=0.8), median time to radiologic/clinical progression (4.6 mo vs 6.6 mo; p=0.6), and median OS (10.6 mo vs 8.6 mo; p=0.2) did not differ significantly between docetaxel-experienced and docetaxel-naive patients. No clinical variables (including prior response to abiraterone) were found to associate significantly with confirmed PSA response to enzalutamide.  Conclusions:   Antitumour activity of enzalutamide following abiraterone was limited in mCRPC patients irrespective of prior docetaxel use. Identifying clinical and molecular factors predictive of response to enzalutamide remains a high priority for future research.  Patient summary:   We looked at the effectiveness of enzalutamide after abiraterone acetate for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. We found that patients who had received docetaxel chemotherapy before abiraterone gained similar benefit from enzalutamide compared with patients who had not received docetaxel.

Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.  Objective:   This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.  Design, setting, and participants:   COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.  Intervention:   Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.  Results and limitations:   At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio: 2.92; chi-square p<0.0001). Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated. Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model. This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.  Conclusions:   In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model. Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.

To date, little is known about the underlying cellular function and regulatory networks of EZH2 in PCa. This study aims to determine whether or not the autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 serves key functions in PCa development. Bioinformatics and integrative analytical approaches were employed to identify the relationships of EZH2 to specific cancer-related gene sets. Results indicated that the enrichment of gene sets about cell cycle progression was associated with EZH2 expression. The depletion of EZH2 in cell experiments inhibited PCa cell growth and blocked cell cycle accompanying the downregulation of E2F3 expression. Furthermore, miR-200c served as an important mediator between EZH2 and E2F3. Compared with scrambled control cells, sh-EZH2 cells showed lower H3K27me3 expression and higher miR-200c expression. Western blot and luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-200c inversely modulated E2F3 by directly targeting the binding site within 3'UTR. Moreover, decreased miR-200c expression largely abrogated the effect of sh-EZH2 on E2F3 expression and E2F3-induced cell cycle progression. EZH2 was positively regulated by E2F3 at the transcriptional level. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed a significant correlation among EZH2, miR-200c, and E2F3 expression in human PCa tissues. In conclusion, the autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 served an important function in PCa development.

Alterations in the UPS may result in cellular transformation or other pathological conditions. The proteasome is indeed often found to be overactive in cancer cells. It has been reported that 2,3-indolinedione (L), which exists in marine organisms, as well as in mammals, is a proteasome inhibitor. Studies have shown that metal-based complexes inhibit proteasome activity and induce apoptosis in certain human cancer cells. In the current study, we synthesized six novel metal-based complexes with derivatives of 2,3-indolinedione: [Cd (C15H11O3N2) (CH3COO)] (C1), [Cd (C15H11O2N2) (CH3COO)] (C2), [Co (C15H9O4N2) (CH3COO)] (C3), [Co (C15H11O2N2) (CH3COO)] (C4), [Zn (C19H14O3N3) (CH3COO)] (C5) and [Zn (C17H13O3N2) (CH3COO)] (C6). We sought to characterize and assess the proteasome inhibitory and anti-proliferative effects of these metal-based complexes in human breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate (LNCaP and PC-3) cancer cells, in order to determine whether specific structures contribute to the inhibition of tumor proteasome activity and the induction of apoptosis. The results revealed that the complexes, C1, C3 and C5, but not their counterparts, C2, C4 and C6, inhibited the chymotrypsin-like activity of the human cancer cellular 26S proteasome; in addition, these complexes promoted the accumulation of the proteasome target protein, Bax, inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner due to their unique structures. Our data suggest that the study of metal-based complexes, including aromatic ring structures with electron-attracting groups, may be an interesting research direction for the development of anticancer drugs.""","""['Pengfei Zhang', 'Caifeng Bi', 'Sara M Schmitt', 'Xin Li', 'Yuhua Fan', 'Nan Zhang', 'Q Ping Dou']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Cellular and computational studies of proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction in human cancer cells by amino acid Schiff base-copper complexes.', 'L-Ornithine Schiff base-copper and -cadmium complexes as new proteasome inhibitors and apoptosis inducers in human cancer cells.', 'Organic cadmium complexes as proteasome inhibitors and apoptosis inducers in human breast cancer cells.', 'Novel copper complexes as potential proteasome inhibitors for cancer treatment (Review).', 'Novel metals and metal complexes as platforms for cancer therapy.', 'Mechanistic insight and structure activity relationship of isatin-based derivatives in development of anti-breast cancer agents.', 'Novel Isatin-based activator of p53 transcriptional functions in tumor cells.', 'Isatin-Schiff base-copper (II) complex induces cell death in p53-positive tumors.', 'The Effect of Neurotoxin MPTP and Neuroprotector Isatin on the Profile of Ubiquitinated Brain Mitochondrial Proteins.', 'Molecular Targets of Active Anticancer Compounds Derived from Marine Sources.']"""

Materials and methods:   The first steps of the prostatectomy reflect the standard RRP, while for the final phases the procedure continues in an anterograde manner with incision of the fibers of the detrusor muscle at the insertion of the ventral surface of the base of the prostate. At this level, the inner circular muscle of the bladder neck forms a sphincteric ring of smooth muscle that covers the longitudinally oriented smooth muscle component of the urethral musculature that extends distally to the verumontanum. These two proximal structures represent the internal sphincter that envelopes and locks the proximal urethra. A blunt dissection is continued until the ring shaped vesical sphincter is separated from the prostate and the longitudinally oriented smooth muscle component of the urethral musculature is identified. The base of the prostate is then gently separated from the urethra and from the bladder until the maximal length of the urethral musculature is isolated and preserved.  Results:   After 30 initial set-up procedures, 40 consecutive patients with organ confined prostate cancer were submitted to radical retropubic prostatectomy with the preservation of muscular internal sphincter and the proximal urethra and compared to 40 patients submitted to standard procedure who served as control group. The group of patients submitted to our technical modification had a faster recovery of early continence than control group at 3 and 7 days.

In order to obtain the accurate and reliable f/t-PSA ratio, the simultaneous detection of f-PSA and t-PSA with high sensitivity and specificity is required. In this work, the dual-channel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has been employed to meet the requirement. In one channel, t-PSA was directly measured with a linear range from 1.0 to 20.0 ng/mL. In another channel, due to the low concentration of f-PSA in serum, the asynchronous competitive inhibition immunoassay with f-PSA@Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) was developed. As expected, the detection sensitivity of f-PSA was greatly enhanced, and a linear correlation with wider linear range from 0.010 to 0.40 ng/mL was also achieved. On the other hand, a simple method was explored for significantly reducing the non-specific adsorption of co-existing proteins. On basis of this, the f/t-PSA ratios in serum samples from prostate cancer (PCa) or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients were measured. And it was found that there was significant difference between the distributions of f/t-PSA ratio in BPH patients (16.44±1.77%) and those in PCa patients (24.53±4.97%).

Recent analyses of RNA sequence data are beginning to provide insights into the distribution of RNA editing across the entire transcriptome, but there are few published matched whole genome and transcriptome sequence datasets, and designing accurate bioinformatics methodology has proven highly challenging. To further characterize the RNA editome, we analyzed 16 paired DNA-RNA sequence libraries from prostate tumor specimens, employing a comprehensive strategy to rescue low coverage sites and minimize false positives. We identified over a hundred thousand putative RNA editing events, a third of which were recurrent in two or more samples, and systematically characterized their type and distribution across the genome. Within genes the majority of events affect non-coding regions such as introns and untranslated regions (UTRs), but 546 genes had RNA editing events predicted to result in deleterious amino acid alterations. Finally, we report a potential association between RNA editing of microRNA binding sites within 3' UTRs and increased transcript expression. These results provide a systematic characterization of the landscape of RNA editing in low coverage sequence data from prostate tumor specimens.

Pioneering genomic analyses of individual cancer subtypes have begun to identify key determinants of resistance, including up-regulation of multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes and mutational alterations of drug targets. However, these alterations are sufficient to explain only a minority of the population, and additional mechanisms of drug resistance or sensitivity are required to explain the remaining spectrum of patient responses to ultimately achieve the goal of precision oncology. We hypothesized that a pan-cancer analysis of in vitro drug sensitivities across numerous cancer lineages will improve the detection of statistical associations and yield more robust and, importantly, recurrent determinants of response. In this study, we developed a statistical framework based on the meta-analysis of expression profiles to identify pan-cancer markers and mechanisms of drug response. Using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE), a large panel of several hundred cancer cell lines from numerous distinct lineages, we characterized both known and novel mechanisms of response to cytotoxic drugs including inhibitors of Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1; Topotecan, Irinotecan) and targeted therapies including inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC; Panobinostat) and MAP/ERK kinases (MEK; PD-0325901, AZD6244). Notably, our analysis implicated reduced replication and transcriptional rates, as well as deficiency in DNA damage repair genes in resistance to TOP1 inhibitors. The constitutive activation of several signaling pathways including the interferon/STAT-1 pathway was implicated in resistance to the pan-HDAC inhibitor. Finally, a number of dysregulations upstream of MEK were identified as compensatory mechanisms of resistance to the MEK inhibitors. In comparison to alternative pan-cancer analysis strategies, our approach can better elucidate relevant drug response mechanisms. Moreover, the compendium of putative markers and mechanisms identified through our analysis can serve as a foundation for future studies into these drugs.""","""['Kendric Wang', 'Raunak Shrestha', 'Alexander W Wyatt', 'Anupama Reddy', 'Joseph Lehár', 'Yuzhou Wang', 'Anna Lapuk', 'Colin C Collins']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Epigenetic changes in histone acetylation underpin resistance to the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan.', 'Biomarkers of Response and Resistance to DNA Repair Targeted Therapies.', 'A novel small molecule hybrid of vorinostat and DACA displays anticancer activity against human hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer through dual inhibition of histone deacetylase and topoisomerase I.', 'HDAC inhibitors downregulate MRP2 expression in multidrug resistant cancer cells: implication for chemosensitization.', 'Not only P-glycoprotein: Amplification of the ABCB1-containing chromosome region 7q21 confers multidrug resistance upon cancer cells by coordinated overexpression of an assortment of resistance-related proteins.', 'The Pro-Survival Oct4/Stat1/Mcl-1 Axis Is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients.', 'Molecular markers and potential therapeutic targets in non-WNT/non-SHH (group 3 and group 4) medulloblastomas.', 'Prognostic Impact of Carboxylesterase 2 in Cholangiocarcinoma.', 'A Robust Model-Free Feature Screening Method for Ultrahigh-Dimensional Data.', 'The Ability of Different Imputation Methods to Preserve the Significant Genes and Pathways in Cancer.']"""

It is helpful for understanding cell pathways and facilitating drug discovery. Here, we developed a novel approach to infer cell-specific pathways and identify a compound's effects using gene expression and phosphoproteomics data under treatments with different compounds. Gene expression data were employed to infer potential targets of compounds and create a generic pathway map. Binary linear programming (BLP) was then developed to optimize the generic pathway topology based on the mid-stage signaling response of phosphorylation. To demonstrate effectiveness of this approach, we built a generic pathway map for the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and inferred the cell-specific pathways by BLP. The first group of 11 compounds was utilized to optimize the generic pathways, and then 4 compounds were used to identify effects based on the inferred cell-specific pathways. Cross-validation indicated that the cell-specific pathways reliably predicted a compound's effects. Finally, we applied BLP to re-optimize the cell-specific pathways to predict the effects of 4 compounds (trichostatin A, MS-275, staurosporine, and digoxigenin) according to compound-induced topological alterations. Trichostatin A and MS-275 (both HDAC inhibitors) inhibited the downstream pathway of HDAC1 and caused cell growth arrest via activation of p53 and p21; the effects of digoxigenin were totally opposite. Staurosporine blocked the cell cycle via p53 and p21, but also promoted cell growth via activated HDAC1 and its downstream pathway. Our approach was also applied to the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, and the cross-validation analysis showed very good accuracy in predicting effects of 4 compounds.

Focusing on amiodarone and metformin, we investigated their potential sensitizing effect on cancer cells when treated with ionizing radiation, cisplatin, and docetaxel. Resazurin reduction was increased by metformin and decreased by amiodarone at nontoxic concentrations. Amiodarone induced mitochondrial swelling, whereas metformin exerted no apparent effect on their morphology. Amiodarone and metformin exerted a weak radiosensitization effect on A549, whereas a synergetic activity with cisplatin and docetaxel was evident in both cell lines.

Patients estimated survival were assessed with the Tokuhashi Revised score and the Tomita score and compared to the observed survival. We assessed how precise the scoring systems predicted survival with McNemar's test.

Results:   The mean age was 65 years (range 20-95), and 57 % of the patients were men. The majority of tumors were lung (23 %), prostate (21 %), and breast tumors (18 %). The overall precision of predicted survival was 58.7 % for the Tokuhashi Revised score and 52.9 % for the Tomita score. The observed survival in each of the scoring groups categorized by the scoring systems was statistically significantly different (p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   The Tokuhashi Revised score and the Tomita score are useful in categorizing patients into prognostic groups, and the individual components have important prognostic values.

Methods and materials:   All consecutive patients with bone metastases treated with RT during 2007 to 2011 in British Columbia (BC) were identified. Associations between utilization of SFRT and patient and provider characteristics were investigated.  Results:   A total of 16,898 courses of RT were delivered to 8601 patients. SFRT was prescribed 49% of the time. There were positive relationships among SFRT utilization and primary tumor group (P<.001; most commonly in prostate cancer), worse prognosis (P<.001), increasing physician experience (P<.001), site of metastases (P<.001; least for spine metastases), and area of training (P<.001; most commonly for oncologists trained in the United Kingdom). There was wide variation in the prescription of SFRT across 5 regional cancer centers, ranging from 25.5% to 73.4%, which persisted after controlling for other, potentially confounding factors (P<.001).  Conclusions:   The large variability in SFRT utilization across BC Cancer Agency (BCCA) cancer centers suggests there is a strong cultural effect, where physicians' use of SFRT is influenced by their colleagues' practice. SFRT use in BC was similar to that in other Canadian and western European reports but strikingly higher than in the United States.

Ribonucleic acid was extracted from the highest Gleason grade focus and applied to a high-density-oligonucleotide microarray. Receiver operating characteristic, calibration, cumulative incidence, and Cox regression analyses were performed to assess GC performance for predicting BF and DM after post-RP RT in comparison with clinical nomograms.  Results:   The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the Stephenson model was 0.70 for both BF and DM, with addition of GC significantly improving area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to 0.78 and 0.80, respectively.

Materials and methods:   Five blinded radiology fellows evaluated 31 total prostate mpMRIs in this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study for index lesion detection, confidence in lesion diagnosis (1-5 scale), and Gleason grade (Gleason 6 or lower vs. Gleason 7+). Following a dedicated education program, readers reinterpreted cases after a memory extinction period, blinded to initial reads. Reference standard was established combining whole mount histopathology with mpMRI findings by a board-certified radiologist with 5 years of prostate mpMRI experience.  Results:   Index cancer detection: pre-education accuracy 74.2%; post-education accuracy 87.7% (p = 0.003). Confidence in index lesion diagnosis: pre-education 4.22 ± 1.04; post-education 3.75 ± 1.41 (p = 0.0004).

Conclusions:   A dedicated reader education program on PCa detection with mpMRI was associated with a statistically significant increase in diagnostic accuracy of index cancer and anterior cancer detection as well as Gleason grade identification as compared to pre-education values.

Material and methods:   In 1998-2009, 103 047 men had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and registered in the Swedish Cancer Register to which registration is mandated by law and of these men, 100 849 men (98%) had also been registered in The National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden. We compared demographics, cancer treatment, comorbidity, and mortality in men in NPCR, with those who had only been registered in the Cancer Register, by use of data from the Cause of Death Register, the In-Patient Register and the Prescribed Drug Register. In addition, we identified 1929 men who had prostate cancer as underlying cause of death in the Cause of Death Register who had neither been registered in the Cancer Register nor in NPCR.  Results:   Compared to men in NPCR, men only registered in the Cancer Register were slightly older, median age 72 versus 71 years, and a lower proportion underwent radical prostatectomy, 15% versus 27%. Ten year prostate cancer mortality was 23% (95% CI 20-25) for men in the Cancer Register only and 24% (95% CI 24-25) in NPCR, while mortality from competing causes was 28% (95% CI 26-31) and 30% (95% CI 30-30), respectively. Men identified with prostate cancer by a death certificate were old and had high comorbidity.  Conclusion:   The capture rate of NPCR is very high and there are only modest differences in demographics, cancer treatment, comorbidity, and mortality between the small proportion of men only registered in the Cancer Register and men registered in NPCR, indicating that information in NPCR can be generalized to all men with prostate cancer in Sweden.""","""['Katarina Tomic', 'Anders Berglund', 'David Robinson', 'Marie Hjälm-Eriksson', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Mats Lambe', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['The National Prostate Cancer Register in Sweden 1998-2002: trends in incidence, treatment and survival.', 'Evaluation of data quality in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden.', 'Differences according to socioeconomic status in the management and mortality in men with high risk prostate cancer.', 'Familial prostate cancer in Sweden.

Methods:   In 18 patients with unilateral peripheral zone (pT2a) tumours who underwent DCE-MRI prior to radical prostatectomy (RP), the following pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed: permeability surface area volume transfer constant (K (trans)), extravascular extracellular volume (Ve) and rate constant (K ep). In the RP sections blood and lymph vessels were visualised immunohistochemically and automatically examined and analysed. Parameters assessed included microvessel density (MVD), area (MVA) and perimeter (MVP) as well as lymph vessel density (LVD), area (LVA) and perimeter (LVP).  Results:   A negative correlation was found between age and K (trans) and K ep for tumour (r = -0.60, p = 0.009; r = -0.67, p = 0.002) and normal (r = -0.54, p = 0.021; r = -0.46, p = 0.055) tissue. No correlation existed between absolute values of microvascular parameters from histopathology and DCE-MRI. In contrast, the ratio between tumour and normal tissue (correcting for individual microvascularity variations) significantly correlated between K ep and MVD (r = 0.61, p = 0.007) and MVP (r = 0.54, p = 0.022). The lymphovascular parameters showed only a correlation between LVA and K ep (r = -0.66, p = 0.003).  Conclusions:   Significant correlations between DCE-MRI and histopathologic parameters were found when correcting for interpatient variations in microvascularity.

Materials and methods:   35 patients with primary prostate cancer underwent simultaneous [18F] choline PET/MRI. From these, 21 patients with an intermediate and high risk constellation who were not under ongoing hormonal therapy were included. Altogether 32 tumor lesions with a focal uptake of [18F] choline could be identified. Average ADC values (ADCaver) minimum ADC values (ADCmin) as well as maximum and mean SUVs (SUVmax, SUVmean) of tumor lesions were assessed with volume-of-interest (VOI) and Region-of-interest (ROI) measurements. As a reference, also ADCaver, ADCmin and SUVmax and SUVmean of non-tumorous prostate tissue were measured. Statistical analysis comprised calculation of descriptive parameters and calculation of Pearson's product moment correlations between ADC values and SUVs of tumor lesions.  Results:   Mean ADCaver and ADCmin of tumor lesions were 0.94±0.22×10(-3) mm2/s and 0.65±0.21×10(-3) mm2/s, respectively. Mean SUVmax and SUVmean of tumor lesions were 6.3±2.3 and 2.6±0.8, respectively. These values were in each case significantly different from the reference values (p<0.001).

The resulting uncertainty in risk assessment leads to significant overtreatment, with associated costs and morbidity. We developed a performance-based strategy to identify protein biomarkers predictive of prostate cancer aggressiveness and lethality regardless of biopsy-sampling variation.  Methods:   Prostatectomy samples from a large patient cohort with long follow-up were blindly assessed by expert pathologists who identified the tissue regions with the highest and lowest Gleason grade from each patient. To simulate biopsy-sampling error, a core from a high- and a low-Gleason area from each patient sample was used to generate a 'high' and a 'low' tumour microarray, respectively.  Results:   Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we identified from 160 candidates 12 biomarkers that predicted prostate cancer aggressiveness (surgical Gleason and TNM stage) and lethal outcome robustly in both high- and low-Gleason areas. Conversely, a previously reported lethal outcome-predictive marker signature for prostatectomy tissue was unable to perform under circumstances of maximal sampling error.

However, whether Egr1 contributes to the transition of advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) from androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) remains largely unknown. To the best of our knowledge, through immunohistochemical staining methods, we were the first to identify that Egr1 is more highly expressed in AIPC clinical specimens than in androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC). An in vitro study with quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated that Egr1 also has a higher expression in androgen-independent PC3 cells than in the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Egr1 expression in LNCaP cells was significantly upregulated during the androgen deprivation treatment (ADT) and was re-downregulated through the addition of dihydrotestosterone. Although no variation in PC3 cells was identified, Egr1 responded to dihydrotestosterone and flutamide in the androgen receptor (AR)-transfected PC3 cells. Further investigation with Egr1 agonist and specific siRNA-targeting Egr1 revealed that Egr1 upregulation or downregulation was accompanied by a change in inhibitors of differentiation and DNA binding-1 (Id1) in the same direction in both LNCaP and PC3 cells. The variation is shown to be negatively regulated by androgen through AR during ADT. Our data suggested that upregulated Egr1 might partially contribute to the emergence of AIPC after prolonged ADT. This study also elucidated the potential mechanism underlying Id1 participation in the progression of prostate cancer. Understanding the key molecular events in the transition from ADPC to AIPC may provide new therapeutic intervention strategies for patients with AIPC.""","""['Bin Xu', 'Gusheng Tang', 'Chengwu Xiao', 'Linhui Wang', 'Qing Yang', 'Yinghao Sun']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Pathol""","""['Androgen deprivation therapy has no effect on Pim-1 expression in a mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'Exosomes Promote the Transition of Androgen-Dependent Prostate Cancer Cells into Androgen-Independent Manner Through Up-Regulating the Heme Oxygenase-1.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Clinical considerations for the management of androgen indifferent prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor dampens tissue factor expression via nuclear factor-κB and early growth response protein 1.', 'A triad of telomerase, androgen receptor and early growth response 1 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Metformin inhibits hepatocellular glucose, lipid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways by transcriptionally suppressing steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2).', 'Current opinion on the role of testosterone in the development of prostate cancer: a dynamic model.', 'Enrichment of the Cancer Stem Phenotype in Sphere Cultures of Prostate Cancer Cell Lines Occurs through Activation of Developmental Pathways Mediated by the Transcriptional Regulator ΔNp63α.']"""

Our approach, PCR-activated cell sorting (PACS), uses TaqMan PCR to detect nucleic acids within single cells and trigger their sorting. With this method, we identified and sorted prostate cancer cells from a heterogeneous population by performing >132 000 simultaneous single-cell TaqMan RT-PCR reactions targeting vimentin mRNA. Following vimentin-positive droplet sorting and downstream analysis of recovered nucleic acids, we found that cancer-specific genomes and transcripts were significantly enriched.

Random-effects models were used to obtain summary HR for the association between metformin and all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. Twenty-one observational studies were meta-analyzed in the primary analysis.

Subgroup analyses by cancer site showed a significant reduction in mortality for colon cancer (four studies, HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.56-0.76) but not for breast and prostate cancers. Observational studies indicate that metformin exposure at cancer diagnosis may be associated with a reduction in mortality.

However, to date, the interplay between known oncogenic or tumor-suppressive events and lncRNAs has not been well described. Here, the novel lncRNA, prostate cancer-associated transcript 29 (PCAT29), is characterized along with its relationship to the androgen receptor. PCAT29 is suppressed by DHT and upregulated upon castration therapy in a prostate cancer xenograft model. PCAT29 knockdown significantly increased proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells, whereas PCAT29 overexpression conferred the opposite effect and suppressed growth and metastases of prostate tumors in chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. Finally, in prostate cancer patient specimens, low PCAT29 expression correlated with poor prognostic outcomes. Taken together, these data expose PCAT29 as an androgen-regulated tumor suppressor in prostate cancer.  Implications:   This study identifies PCAT29 as the first androgen receptor-repressed lncRNA that functions as a tumor suppressor and that its loss may identify a subset of patients at higher risk for disease recurrence.

In this grading scheme, the discrimination between grade 3 and grade 4 is the most difficult, and receives the most attention from researchers. In this study, we propose a novel method (called nuclei-based method) that 1) utilizes graph theory techniques to segment glands and 2) computes a gland-score (based on the spatial arrangement of nuclei) to estimate how similar a segmented region is to a gland. Next, we create a fusion method by combining this nuclei-based method with the lumen-based method presented in our previous work to improve the performance of grade 3 versus grade 4 classification problem (the accuracy is now improved to 87.3% compared to 81.1% of the lumen-based method alone). To segment glands, we build a graph of nuclei and lumina in the image, and use the normalized cut method to partition the graph into different components, each corresponding to a gland. Unlike most state-of-the-art lumen-based gland segmentation method, the nuclei-based method is able to segment glands without lumen or glands with multiple lumina. Moreover, another important contribution in this research is the development of a set of measures to exploit the difference in nuclei spatial arrangement between grade 3 images (where nuclei form closed chain structure on the gland boundary) and grade 4 image (where nuclei distribute more randomly in the gland). These measures are combined to generate a single gland-score value, which estimates how similar a segmented region (which is a set of nuclei and lumina) is to a gland.""","""['Kien Nguyen', 'Anindya Sarkar', 'Anil K Jain']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Structure and context in prostatic gland segmentation and classification.', 'Segmentation of cytoplasm and nuclei of abnormal cells in cervical cytology using global and local graph cuts.', 'Automatic segmentation of cell nuclei in Feulgen-stained histological sections of prostate cancer and quantitative evaluation of segmentation results.', 'Tumor Malignancy Detection Using Histopathology Imaging.', 'Computer-Aided Prostate Cancer Diagnosis From Digitized Histopathology: A Review on Texture-Based Systems.', 'GSN-HVNET: A Lightweight, Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework for Nuclei Segmentation and Classification.', 'Comparison of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging and Amide Proton Transfer Imaging in the Diagnosis and Risk Assessment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Feature-driven local cell graph (FLocK): New computational pathology-based descriptors for prognosis of lung cancer and HPV status of oropharyngeal cancers.', 'ConvPath: A software tool for lung adenocarcinoma digital pathological image analysis aided by a convolutional neural network.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Lung Cancer Pathology Image Analysis.']"""

Material and methods:   The study was a retrospective analysis of 96 prostate cancer patients treated by robot-assisted laparoscopic RP at Helsinki University Central Hospital in 2009-2010. Data from diagnostic biopsies were compared with data from reassessment of RP slides. At reanalysis, an index tumour was chosen for all patients and was determined as being the most dedifferentiated tumour or the largest tumour with Gleason pattern 3 in case Gleason patterns 4 or 5 were absent. The performance of prostate biopsies in predicting cancer laterality, tumour size and tumour location was analysed. Statistical methods included Spearman's correlation, linear regression analysis and Pearson's chi-squared test. Suitability for focal therapies was assessed based on tumour morphology and laterality.  Results:   The extent of cancer in biopsies correlated with tumour size in the apex and middle of the prostate [standard coefficients in linear regression for the apex 2.479-2.553, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.952-3.056, p < 0.001-0.007; and for the middle 1.936-2.388, 95% CI 1.504-2.861, p < 0.001]. Prostate biopsies performed moderately in predicting tumour location in RP slides (positive predictive value 34.1-90.9%). Thirty-six patients (37.5%) would possibly have been candidates for focal therapy and thirty-nine (40.6%) patients for hemiablation.

Thus, advanced therapeutic strategies are required to treat prostate cancer patients. Curcumin (CUR) is a promising anticancer agent for various cancer types. The objective of this study was to evaluate therapeutic potential of novel poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)- CUR nanoparticles (PLGA-CUR NPs) for prostate cancer treatment. Our results indicate that PLGA-CUR NPs efficiently internalize in prostate cancer cells and release biologically active CUR in cytosolic compartment of cells for effective therapeutic activity. Cell proliferation (MTS), clonogenic, and Western blot analyses reveal that PLGA-CUR NPs can effectively inhibit proliferation and colony formation ability of prostate cancer cells than free CUR. PLGA-CUR NPs showed superior tumor regression compared to CUR in xenograft mice. Further investigations reveal that PLGA-CUR NPs inhibit nuclear β-catenin and AR expression in cells and in tumor xenograft tissues. It also suppresses STAT3 and AKT phosphorylation and leads to apoptosis via inhibition of key anti-apoptotic proteins, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and caused induction of PARP cleavage. Additionally, significant downregulation of oncogenic miR21 and up-regulation of miR-205 was observed with PLGA-CUR NPs treatment as determined by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses. A superior anti-cancer potential was attained with PSMA antibody conjugated PLGA-CUR NPs in prostate cancer cells and a significant tumor targeting of (131)I labeled PSMA antibody was achieved with PLGA-CUR NPs in prostate cancer xenograft mice model.

We aim to determine the rate of detection of CTCs in patients with high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer using the CellSearch® method.  Method:   Samples of peripheral blood (7.5 mL) were drawn from 36 men with newly diagnosed high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer, prior to any initiation of therapy and analyzed for CTCs using the CellSearch® method.  Results:   The median age was 70 years, median PSA was 14.1, and the median Gleason score was 9. The median 5-year risk of progression of disease using a validated nomogram was 39 %. Five out of 36 patients (14 %, 95 % CI 5-30 %) had CTCs detected in their circulation. Four patients had only 1 CTC per 7.5 mL of blood detected. One patient had 3 CTCs per 7.5 mL of blood detected, which included a circulating tumor microemboli. Both on univariate analysis and multivariate analysis, there were no correlations found between CTC positivity and the classic prognostic factors including PSA, Gleason score, T-stage and age.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates that patients with high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer present infrequently with small number of CTCs in peripheral blood. This finding is consistent with the limited literature available in this setting. Other CTC isolation and detection technologies with improved sensitivity and specificity may enable detection of CTCs with mesenchymal phenotypes, although none as yet have been validated for clinical use. Newer assays are emerging for detection of new putative biomarkers for prostate cancer.

Using SI2 as a way of inhibiting the activity of SENPs and the SUMO stably transfected PC3 cells as a prostate cancer model, in combination with the stable isotope labeling with amino acids (SILAC) quantitative proteomic technique, we identified more than 900 putative target proteins of SUMO, in which 231 proteins were further subjected to bioinformatic analysis. In the highly enriched spliceosome pathway, we validated that USP39, HSPA1A, and HSPA2 were novel target proteins of SUMO. Furthermore, we demonstrated that K6, K16, K29, K51, and K73 were the SUMOylation sites of USP39. Mutation of these SUMO modification sites of USP39 further promoted the proliferation-enhancing effect of USP39 on prostate cancer cells.

We aimed to evaluate the initial use of the technique to follow tumor sites in men on active surveillance of prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   A total of 53 men with prostate cancer (all T1c category) underwent rebiopsy of 74 positive biopsy sites, which were tracked and targeted using the Artemis MR-US fusion device (Eigen, Grass Valley, CA) from March 2010 through January 2013. The initial biopsy included 12 cores from a standard template (mapped by software) and directed biopsies from regions of interest seen on MR imaging (MRI). In the repeat biopsy, samples were taken from sites containing cancer at the initial biopsy. Outcomes of interest at second MR-US biopsy included (a) presence of any cancer and (b) presence of clinically significant cancer.  Results:   All cancers on initial biopsy had either Gleason score 3+3 = 6 (n = 63) or 3+4 = 7 (n = 11). At initial biopsy, 23 cancers were within an MRI target, and 51 were found on systematic biopsy. Cancer detection rate on repeat biopsy (29/74, 39%) was independent of Gleason score on initial biopsy (P = not significant) but directly related to initial cancer core length (P<0.02). Repeat sampling of cancerous sites within MRI targets was more likely to show cancer than resampling of tumorous systematic sites (61% vs. 29%, P = 0.005). When initial cancer core length was≥4 mm within an MRI target, more than 80% (5/6) of follow-up tracking biopsies were positive. An increase of Gleason score was uncommon (9/74, 12%).  Conclusions:   Monitoring of specific prostate cancer-containing sites may be achieved in some men using an electronic tracking system. The chances of finding tumor on repeat specific-site sampling was directly related to the length of tumor in the initial biopsy core and presence of tumor within an MRI target; upgrading of Gleason score was uncommon.

In recent years, promising therapeutic agents, such as the BH3-only mimetic ABT-263 and proteasome inhibitors, have been developed and widely evaluated against a broad spectrum of cancer types, including prostate cancer, alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, the antitumor efficacy of ABT-263 and MLN2238 were evaluated as single agents and in combination in four CRPC cell lines: PC3, C4-2B, C4-2, and DU145. The viability of the treated cells and markers of apoptosis were assayed. Protein-protein interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation in drug-treated cells. Lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA was used to knockdown Bax, Mcl-1, and NOXA expressions. We found that ABT-263 and MLN2238 alone exhibited a mild cytotoxicity, and in combination, they elicited a synergistic cytotoxic effect in CRPC cells. The cell apoptosis induced by the combination drug treatment was evidenced by enhanced caspase-3 and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and annexin-V-positive staining was significantly depleted by Bax knockdown. MLN2238 treatment upregulated NOXA and Mcl-1 expression, leading NOXA/Mcl-1 complexes to disassociate Bak from its complexes with Mcl-1 and enhancing ABT263-triggered Bax activation. NOXA knockdown by short hairpin RNA significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity of ABT-263 and MLN2238 co-administration. In conclusion, MLN2238 and ABT-263 synergistically triggered apoptosis in CRPC cells by upregulating NOXA and activating Bax, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CRPC.""","""['Xinghua Wei', 'Ping Zhou', 'Xuanting Lin', 'Yurong Lin', 'Sifeng Wu', 'Pengfei Diao', 'Haiqing Xie', 'Keji Xie', 'Ping Tang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Induction of Noxa sensitizes human colorectal cancer cells expressing Mcl-1 to the small-molecule Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, ABT-737.', 'BH3 mimetic ABT-737 and a proteasome inhibitor synergistically kill melanomas through Noxa-dependent apoptosis.', 'The investigational agent MLN2238 induces apoptosis and is cytotoxic to CLL cells in vitro, as a single agent and in combination with other drugs.', 'Alterations in the Noxa/Mcl-1 axis determine sensitivity of small cell lung cancer to the BH3 mimetic ABT-737.', 'Reversal of Mutant KRAS-Mediated Apoptosis Resistance by Concurrent Noxa/Bik Induction and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL Antagonism in Colon Cancer Cells.', ""Proteasome inhibitor immunotherapy for the epithelial to mesenchymal transition: assessing the A549 lung cancer cell microenvironment and the role of M1, M2a and M2c 'hydrocortisone-polarised' macrophages."", 'BH3-mimetics: recent developments in cancer therapy.', 'An Anti-PSMA Immunotoxin Reduces Mcl-1 and Bcl2A1 and Specifically Induces in Combination with the BAD-Like BH3 Mimetic ABT-737 Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Silencing lncRNA LOC101928963 Inhibits Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis in Spinal Cord Glioma Cells by Binding to PMAIP1.', 'Preclinical evaluation of antitumor activity of the proteasome inhibitor MLN2238 (ixazomib) in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   All patients undergoing HoLEP between 1998 and 2013 were identified. Patients with a known history of prostate cancer were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression assessed variables associated with identification of prostate cancer on HoLEP specimens and Gleason 7 or higher prostate cancer among the malignant cases. The Gleason grade was used as a proxy for disease severity. Each of the models was adjusted for age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and HoLEP specimen weight.  Results:   The cohort comprised 1272 patients, of whom 103 (8.1%) had prostate cancer identified. Prostate cancer cases had higher pre-HoLEP PSA (p=0.06) but lower HoLEP specimen weight (p=0.01). On multivariate logistic regression, age and preoperative PSA were associated with increased odds of prostate cancer being present (p<0.01 each), while increasing HoLEP specimen weight was associated with decreased odds of prostate cancer (p<0.001). Men older than 80 had 20% predicted probability of being diagnosed with prostate cancer. Seventy-eight percent of prostate cancer cases were Gleason 6 or less. The pre-HoLEP PSA was associated with increased adjusted odds of intermediate- or high-grade prostate cancer.

Limited in vitro analyses suggested an oncogenic role for HH in renal cell carcinoma. In this explorative study we sought to validate aberrant HH expression in patients with renal cell carcinoma.  Materials and methods:   A tissue microarray was constructed from 140 radical nephrectomy specimens of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We performed immunohistochemistry for Ki67 and HH pathway biomarkers, including PTCH1, Smo, SHH, IHH, DHH, Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3. Staining intensity was measured by automated image processing and related to tumor stage and grade. The impact of biomarker expression on cancer specific survival was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis.  Results:   Gli3, PTCH1, DHH and SHH demonstrated markedly higher expression in high than in low grade tumors. Tumor stage was not associated with marker expression. On univariate analysis DHH expression, and tumor grade and stage were associated with cancer specific survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that DHH, grade and stage were independent predictors of cancer specific survival.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge we report for the first time that a biomarker of the HH pathway is associated with adverse pathological features and poor disease outcomes in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. DHH may serve as an independent predictor of cancer specific survival in clear cell renal cell carcinoma cases.

Patients and methods:   All RPs performed between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011 in the UK with data entered into the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) database, were identified for analysis. Overall surgical outcomes were assessed and subgroup analyses of these outcomes, based on operative technique [open RP (ORP), laparoscopic RP (LRP) and robot-assisted laparoscopic RP (RALP)], were made. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test and categorical variables using the Pearson chi-squared test. Univariate and multivariate binary regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of patient, surgeon and technique-related variables on surgical outcomes.  Results:   During the study period 2163 RPs were performed by 115 consultants with a median (range) of 11 (1-154) cases/consultant. Most RPs were performed laparoscopically (ORP 25.8%, LRP 54.6%, RALP 19.6%) and those performing minimally invasive techniques are more likely to have a higher annual case volume with <1% ORP, 39% LRP and 62% RALP being performed by consultants with an annual caseload of >50 cases/year. Most patients were classified as having intermediate- or high-risk disease preoperatively (1596 patients, 82.5%) and this increased to 97.2% (1649) on postoperative risk stratification. The overall intraoperative complication rate was 14.2% and was significantly greater for LRP (17.8%) vs ORP (8.2%) and RALP (12.4%), (P < 0.001). In all, 71% of patients had an estimated blood loss (EBL) of <500 mL, although there were significantly more patients undergoing ORP with >500, > 1000 and >2000 mL EBL compared with the other techniques (P < 0.001). The postoperative complication rate was 10.7% overall, with a significantly greater postoperative complication rate in the LRP group (LRP 14.6%, ORP 8.8% and RALP 10.3% respectively, P = 0.007). Positive surgical margin (PSM) rates were 17.5% for pT2 disease and 42.3% for pT3 disease. The PSM rate was significantly lower in the RALP patients compared with the ORP patients for those with pT2 disease (P = 0.025), while there was no difference between ORP and LRP (ORP 21.7%, LRP 18.1% and RALP 13.0%). There was no significant difference in the PSM rate in pT3 disease between surgical techniques.  Conclusion:   Most RPs in the UK are performed using minimally invasive techniques, which offer reduced blood loss and transfusion rates compared with ORP. The operation time, complication rate, PSM rates, and association with higher volume practice support RALP as the minimally invasive technique of choice, which could have implications for regions without access to such services. The disparity in outcomes between this national study and high-volume single centres, most probably reflects the low median national case volume, and combined with the positive effect of high case volume on multivariate analysis of surgical outcomes and PSM rates, strengthens the argument for centralisation of services.""","""['Alexander Laird', 'Sarah Fowler', 'Daniel W Good', 'Grant D Stewart', 'Vaikuntam Srinivasan', 'Declan Cahill', 'Simon F Brewster', 'S Alan McNeill;British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS)']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) radical prostatectomy audit 2014/2015 - an update on current practice and outcomes by centre and surgeon case-volume.', 'Positive surgical margin and perioperative complication rates of primary surgical treatments for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing retropubic, laparoscopic, and robotic prostatectomy.', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Comparison of oncological and health-related quality of life outcomes between open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localised\xa0prostate cancer - findings from the population-based Victorian Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Comparison of retropubic, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: who is the winner?', ""Robotic-assisted surgery for\xa0prostatectomy - does the diffusion of robotic systems contribute to treatment centralization and influence patients' hospital choice?"", 'Cost-effectiveness of Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer in the UK.', 'Are urologic surgeons performing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy at the University of Alberta meeting surgical quality performance benchmarks?

Methods:   Between December 2012 and May 2014, 52 RALPs were performed at our institute. Demographic, perioperative, and postoperative data were recorded. Quality of life (QoL) scores were assessed before RALP, after urethral catheter removal, and at the first month after RALP. Fatty connective tissue between bladder neck and prostate was introduced, and circular muscle fibers of the internal sphincter were seen in all patients. Complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Statistical analyses were performed.  Results:   Mean follow-up was 9.6±5.2 months; mean age was 61.1±6.5 years. Our novel surgical technique for preserving the bladder neck was performed in 52 patients, and they were continent after catheter removal; mean duration of the catheter was 9.4±1.4 days. There was a significant difference in QoL before RALP and after catheter removal, however, but there was no statistical difference between before and 1 month after RALP (respectively; P<0.001, P=0.5). Furthermore, there was no complication related to the bladder neck such as bladder neck stricture, acute/chronic urinary retention, as well as no Clavien III, IV, and V complications.

Ten PCa patients underwent in total four repeated 3-tesla DWI examinations using 12 equally spaced b values (0-2000 s/mm(2) ). Normalized mean signal intensities of regions-of-interest placed in normal tissue and PCa were fitted. In total, 210 different b-value combinations consisting of six b values, 0 and 100 s/mm(2) included in every b-value distribution, were evaluated in terms of accuracy and repeatability.  Results:   The simulations and in vivo DWI data suggest the optimal b-value distribution for the monoexponential model consists of four to five equally distributed b values in the range of 0 to 1200 s/mm(2) . The parameters of the stretched exponential and kurtosis models are best estimated using five to seven b values in the ranges of 300 to 700 and close to 2000 s/mm(2) , in addition to low b value. B-value distribution consisting of eight to 10 b values in the ranges of 0 to 100, 800 to 1200, and 1800 to 2000 s/mm(2) is the preferred method for estimation of the biexponential model parameters of PCa DWI.

Hyperpolarized [5-(13) C]glutamine is evaluated as a potential biomarker for noninvasive metabolic measurements of drug response in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Hyperpolarized [5-(13) C]glutamine is used to measure glutamine metabolism in two prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and DU145) before and after treatment with the two natural anticancer drugs resveratrol and sulforaphane. An invasive biochemical assay simulating the hyperpolarized experiment is used to independently quantify glutamine metabolism.  Results:   Glutamine metabolism is found to be 4 times higher in the more glutaminolytic DU145 cells compared with PC3 cells under proliferating growth conditions by using hyperpolarized [5-(13) C]glutamine as a noninvasive probe. A significant decrease in glutamine metabolism occurs upon apoptotic response to treatment with resveratrol and sulforaphane.  Conclusion:   Hyperpolarized NMR using [5-(13) C]glutamine as a probe permits the noninvasive observation of glutaminolysis in different cell lines and under different treatment conditions. Hyperpolarized [5-(13) C]glutamine metabolism thus is a promising biomarker for the noninvasive detection of tumor response to treatment, as it directly monitors one of the hallmarks in cancer metabolism - glutaminolysis - in living cells.""","""['Carolina Canapè', 'Giuseppina Catanzaro', 'Enzo Terreno', 'Magnus Karlsson', 'Mathilde Hauge Lerche', 'Pernille Rose Jensen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['A metabolic perturbation by U0126 identifies a role for glutamine in resveratrol-induced cell death.', 'Facile synthesis 5-(13)C-4-(2)H(2)-L-glutamine for hyperpolarized MRS imaging of cancer cell metabolism.', 'Hyperpolarized 13C lactate, pyruvate, and alanine: noninvasive biomarkers for prostate cancer detection and grading.', 'Hyperpolarized 13C MR for molecular imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Pancreatic cancer chemoprevention by phytochemicals.', 'Hyperpolarized 5-13C,4,4-2H2,5-15N-L-glutamine provides a means of annotating in\xa0vivo metabolic utilization of glutamine.', 'MicroRNA Modulation by Dietary Supplements in Obesity.', 'MR-detectable metabolic biomarkers of response to mutant IDH inhibition in low-grade glioma.', 'Prostate Cancer Energetics and Biosynthesis.', 'Assessing Therapeutic Efficacy in Real-time by Hyperpolarized Magnetic Resonance Metabolic Imaging.']"""

Patients and methods:   Institutional records of MRI-US fusion-guided biopsy were reviewed. Detection rates for all cancers, Gleason ≥3 + 4 cancers, and Gleason ≥4 + 3 cancers were computed. Agreement between axial and sagittal cores for cancer detection, and frequency where one was upgraded the other was computed on a per-target and per-patient basis.  Results:   In all, 893 encounters from 791 patients that underwent MRI-US fusion-guided biopsy in 2007-2013 were reviewed, yielding 4688 biopsy cores from 2344 targets for analysis. The mean age and PSA level at each encounter was 61.8 years and 9.7 ng/mL (median 6.45 ng/mL). Detection rates for all cancers, ≥3 + 4 cancers, and ≥4 + 3 cancers were 25.9%, 17.2%, and 8.1% for axial cores, and 26.1%, 17.6%, and 8.6% for sagittal cores. Per-target agreement was 88.6%, 93.0%, and 96.5%, respectively. On a per-target basis, the rates at which one core upgraded or detected a cancer missed on the other were 8.3% and 8.6% for axial and sagittal cores, respectively. Even with the inclusion of systematic biopsies, omission of axial or sagittal cores would have resulted in missed detection or under-characterisation of cancer in 4.7% or 5.2% of patients, respectively.  Conclusion:   Cancer detection rates, Gleason scores, and core involvement from axial and sagittal cores are similar, but significant cancer may be missed if only one core is obtained for each target.

A genetic contribution to prostate cancer risk has been documented, but knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in prostate cancer initiation is still not well understood. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosomal regions is crucial in tumor progression. In human prostate cancer, several chromosomal regions demonstrating a high frequency of LOH have been previously identified. KCTD11 (REN) is a tumor suppressor gene mapping on human chromosome 17p13.2, whose expression is frequently lost in human medulloblastoma and in several other cancer types. KCTD11 acts as a negative regulator of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Here, we demonstrated that KCTD11 LOH is a common genetic lesion in human prostate adenocarcinoma. Indeed, nuclear KCTD11 protein expression is strongly reduced in primary prostate cancer, and this event correlated with overexpression of proteins acting into the Hedgehog pathway. Low levels of KCTD11 mRNA have been also observed in prostatic cancer cells, and ectopic overexpression of KCTD11 led to growth arrest. Our study demonstrates and supports that KCTD11, as well as negatively regulated downstream effectors belonging to Hh signaling, plays a role in prostate cancer pathogenesis. This could be suitable to characterize new diagnostic and therapeutic markers.""","""['Francesca Zazzeroni', 'Daniela Nicosia', 'Alessandra Tessitore', 'Rita Gallo', 'Daniela Verzella', 'Mariafausta Fischietti', 'Davide Vecchiotti', 'Luca Ventura', 'Daria Capece', 'Alberto Gulino', 'Edoardo Alesse']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['The tumor suppressor gene KCTD11REN is regulated by Sp1 and methylation and its expression is reduced in tumors.', 'REN(KCTD11) is a suppressor of Hedgehog signaling and is deleted in human medulloblastoma.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   The subjects of this study were 268 patients to whom TRUS-guided prostate biopsy was recommended from January to June 2011 and who completed a questionnaire. Patients who showed a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase to more than 4.0 ng/mL or abnormal findings on a digital rectal examination and TRUS were recommended to undergo prostate biopsy. The questionnaire consisted of 9 questions about the subjects' demographic characteristics and 15 questions that assessed their knowledge of prostate disease. Fisher exact probability test was conducted to assess the influence of the demographic characteristics and levels of knowledge of prostate disease on acceptance of prostate biopsy.  Results:   The mean age of the subjects was 66.2 years (range, 43-83 years). Of the cohort, 188 patients (70.7%) agreed to the prostate biopsy and 78 patients (29.3%) refused. In terms of demographic characteristics, the patients' acceptance of prostate biopsy was associated only with education level. Patients with relatively lower education levels had a higher acceptance rate for prostate biopsy (80.0% vs. 65.9%, p=0.018). Other demographic factors, as well as the degree of knowledge of prostate disease, had no significant effect on the acceptance rate.

Sulforaphane (SFN) is a phytochemical derived from cruciferous vegetables that induces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses in prostate cancer cells, but not in normal prostate cells. The mechanisms responsible for this cancer-specific cytotoxicity remain unclear.  Methods and results:   We utilized RNA sequencing and determined the transcriptomes of normal prostate epithelial cells, androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells treated with SFN. SFN treatment dynamically altered gene expression and resulted in distinct transcriptome profiles depending on prostate cell line. SFN also down-regulated the expression of genes that were up-regulated in prostate cancer cells. Network analysis of genes altered by SFN treatment revealed that the transcription factor Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) was present in an average of 90.5% of networks. Sp1 protein was significantly decreased by SFN treatment in prostate cancer cells and Sp1 may be an important mediator of SFN-induced changes in expression.

We performed association testing for each variant using logistic regression adjusted for age, study and global ancestry. Of the 82 known risk variants, 68 (83%) had effects that were directionally consistent in their association with prostate cancer risk and 30 (37%) were significantly associated with risk at p < 0.05, with the most statistically significant variants being rs116041037 (p = 3.7 × 10(-26) ) and rs6983561 (p = 1.1 × 10(-16) ) at 8q24, as well as rs7210100 (p = 5.4 × 10(-8) ) at 17q21.

Those receiving CT, androgen-deprivation therapy, and radiation had a median survival of 15.1 vs. 7 months for those receiving CT alone (P<0.001). On multivariable analysis (controlling for age, Charlson comorbidity index, extent of metastasis, prostate-specific antigen level, and type of treatment), older age (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.87; 95% CI: 1.41-9.34; P = 0.007) and distant metastatic disease (HR = 7.17; 95% CI: 1.62-31.8; P = 0.010) increased risk of death, whereas receipt of CT (HR = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.05-0.44; P = 0.001) decreased risk of death.  Conclusion:   Men presenting with metastatic small cell carcinoma of the prostate have poor overall survival. Older patients and those presenting with distant metastases have an increased risk of death. It appears that patients receiving CT experience a modest survival benefit.

Materials and methods:   Data were extracted from PLCO and NLST to stratify risk of BC by overall population, sex, race, age at inclusion, and smoking status. Incidence rates between groups were compared using chi-square test.  Results:   BC was identified in 1,430/154,898 patients in PLCO and 439/53,173 patients in NLST. BCs were grade III/IV in 36.8% and 41.3%. Incidence rates were significantly higher in men than in women (PLCO: 1.4 vs. 0.31/1,000 person-years and NLST: 1.84 vs. 0.6/1,000 person-years, both P<0.0001). In proportional hazards models, male sex, higher age, and duration and intensity of smoking were associated with higher risk of BC (all P<0.0001). In men older than 70 years with smoking exposure of 30 pack-years (PY) and more, incidence rates were as high as 11.92 (PLCO) and 5.23 (NLST) (per 1,000 person-years). In current high-intensity smokers (≥50 PY), the sex disparity in incidence persists in both trials (0.78 vs. 2.99 per 1,000 person-years in PLCO and 1.12 vs. 2.65 per 1,000 person-years in NLST).  Conclusions:   Men older than 60 years with a smoking history of>30 PY had incidence rates of more than 2/1,000 person-years, which could serve as an excellent population for screening trials.

Utilizing prostate cancer cell lines subjected to CK2-specific inhibitors which cause loss of cell viability, we have found that CK2 inhibition in cells causes rapid early decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Cells treated with the CK2 inhibitors TBB (4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole) or TBCA (tetrabromocinnamic acid) demonstrate changes in Δψm which become apparent within 2 h, that is, significantly prior to evidence of activation of other mitochondrial apoptotic signals whose temporal expression ensues subsequent to loss of Δψm. Further, we have demonstrated the presence of CK2 in purified mitochondria and it appears that the effect on Δψm evoked by inhibition of CK2 may involve mitochondrial localized CK2. Results also suggest that alterations in Ca(2+) signaling may be involved in the CK2 mediated regulation of Δψm and mitochondrial permeability.

Subsequently using biochemical fractionation we identified butanol fraction contributes to the observed biological activities. We report here that palmatine, which is present in the butanol fraction, selectively inhibits growth of prostate cancer cells without significant effect on non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells. By screening receptor tyrosine kinases in a protein kinase array, we identified ribosomal protein S6, a downstream target of p70S6K and the Akt/mTOR signaling cascade as a potential target. We further show that palmatine treatment is associated with decreased activation of NFκB and its downstream target gene FLIP. These events led to inhibition of invasion. Similar results were obtained using parent extract Nexrutine (Nx) suggesting that palmatine either in the purified form or as one of the components in Nx is a potent cytotoxic agent with tumor invasion inhibitory properties. Synergistic inhibition of rpS6/NFκB/FLIP axis with palmatine may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of prostate cancer and possibly other malignancies with their constitutive activation.

Mouse models suggest that the downstream effector molecule of the PI3K pathway, mTOR, is also important in the development of PCa, where it plays a pivotal role in forming precursor lesions such as high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). This study was conducted to determine the status of phosphorylated-mTOR (p-mTOR the activated state of mTOR) across the PCa progression model by looking at expression in normal prostate tissue, proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA), HGPIN, and PCa.  Methods:   Expression of p-mTOR was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays constructed from 120 archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded radical prostatectomy tissue specimens. Levels of expression were recorded as the percentage of positive epithelial cells multiplied by the intensity of staining scored as 0-3.  Results:   p-mTOR expression was found to increase across the progression model with mean staining in non-neoplastic samples of 40 compared to 98 in PIA, 107 in HGPIN, and 136 in cancer (P < 0.001), but without significant increase between HGPIN and PIA. Correlation of high p-mTOR expression with outcome in PCa showed a trend towards worse prognosis, but this was not statistically significant.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that p-mTOR signaling has a potential role in both the initiation and progression of PCa. These data provide support for further research into the possible use of rapamycin analogues in the treatment of PCa, and raise the possibility that mTOR might be a potential target for chemoprevention.""","""['Sarah I M Sutherland', 'Ruth Pe Benito', 'Susan M Henshall', 'Lisa G Horvath', 'James G Kench']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Immunohistochemical examination of the mTORC1 pathway in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and prostatic adenocarcinomas (PCa): a tissue microarray study (TMA).', 'mTOR-RAPTOR and 14-3-3σ immunohistochemical expression in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostatic adenocarcinomas: a tissue microarray study.', 'Morphological transition of proliferative inflammatory atrophy to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer in human prostate.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.', 'Clinical significance of proliferative inflammatory atrophy in prostate biopsy.', 'Expression of mTOR in normal and pathological conditions.', 'Evodiamine as the Active Compound of Evodiae fructus to Inhibit Proliferation and Migration of Prostate Cancer through PI3K/AKT/NF-κB Signaling Pathway.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.']"""

Inhibition of mTORC1 or mTORC2 by knock down of Raptor or Rictor, respectively, migration and invasion of prostate cancer were attenuated. Furthermore, EMT, a characterized by the changed expression levels of various markers like E-cadherin, β-catenin, N-cadherin, and vimentin emergend following inhibition of Raptor or Rictor. Finally, the small GTPases (RhoA and Rac1) which were crucial regulatory proteins in cell migration and invasion were inactivited after downregulating Raptor and Rictor.

As surrogate for CTCs we measured KLK3, PCA3, and TMPRSS2-ERG messenger RNA (mRNA) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction from a castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patient cohort and three control groups. Moreover, biomarker response to docetaxel treatment was evaluated in the patient group.  Methods:   Blood samples from 20 CRPC patients were analyzed at four different time points (prior to docetaxel treatment, at 9 weeks, 27 weeks, and 2 months after treatment). Blood was drawn once from three control groups (10 age-matched men, 10 men under 35 years of age, 12 women). All samples were analyzed for KLK3, PCA3, and TMPRSS2-ERG mRNA by using a quantitative nucleic acid amplification assay with gene-specific primers in the complementary DNA synthesis.  Results:   At baseline, mRNA for KLK3 was detected in 17 (89%, 95% CI 76-100%), PCA3 in 10 (53%, 95% CI 30-75%), and TMPRSS2-ERG in seven of 19 evaluable patients (37%, 95% CI 15-59%). In contrast, the blood samples from all 32 healthy volunteers were reproducible negative for all markers. In response to docetaxel treatment, KLK3 levels decreased in 80% (95% CI 60-100%), PCA3 in 89% (95% CI 68-100%), and TMPRSS2-ERG in 86% (95% CI 60-100%) of patients.

Animal models of prostate cancer are vital to understanding its pathogenesis and developing therapeutics. Canine models in particular are useful due to their similarities to late-stage, castration-resistant human disease with osteoblastic bone metastases. This study established and characterized a novel canine prostate cancer cell line that will contribute to the understanding of prostate cancer pathogenesis.  Methods:   A novel cell line (Probasco) was derived from a mixed breed dog that had spontaneous prostate cancer. Cell proliferation and motility were analyzed in vitro. Tumor growth in vivo was studied by subcutaneous, intratibial, and intracardiac injection of Probasco cells into nude mice. Tumors were evaluated by bioluminescent imaging, Faxitron radiography, µCT, and histology. RT-PCR and genome-wide DNA copy number profiling were used to characterize the cell line.  Results:   The Probasco cells grew in vitro (over 75 passages) and were tumorigenic in nude mice. Probasco cells expressed high levels of BMP2, CDH1, MYOF, FOLH1, RUNX2, and SMAD5 modest CXCL12, SLUG, and BMP, and no PTHrP mRNA. Following intracardiac injection, Probasco cells metastasized primarily to the appendicular skeleton, and both intratibial and intracardiac injections produced osteoblastic tumors in bone. Comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated numerous DNA copy number aberrations throughout the genome, including large losses and gains in multiple chromosomes.

Moreover, DAB2IP is able to inhibit c-kit-PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway that increases c-myc protein to activate ZEB1 gene expression leading to the elevated CSC phenotypes. An inverse correlation between CD117 or ZEB1 and DAB2IP is also found in clinical specimens.

However, the mechanisms affecting anticancer response to HNK are not fully understood.  Methods:   Human (androgen-independent PC-3 and androgen-responsive LNCaP) and murine (Myc-CaP) prostate cancer cells, and PC-3 tumor xenografts were used for various assays. Autophagy was assessed by transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence (LC3 puncta), and immunoblotting (LC3BII detection). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue assay. Apoptosis was quantitated by DNA fragmentation detection and Annexin V/propidium iodide assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry and flow cytometric/microscopic analysis of MitoSOX red fluorescence.  Results:   Exposure of PC-3, LNCaP, and Myc-CaP cells to pharmacologic doses of HNK resulted in autophagy induction. The PC-3 tumor xenografts from HNK-treated mice contained higher levels of LC3BII protein compared with control tumors. Cell viability inhibition and apoptosis induction resulting from HNK exposure were significantly augmented by pharmacological inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine as well as RNA interference of autophagy regulator ATG5. HNK-mediated increase in levels of LC3BII protein was partially but markedly diminished in the presence of antioxidants, including N-acetylcysteine, polyethylene glycol-conjugated (PEG)-superoxide dismutase, and PEG-catalase. On the other hand, antioxidants had no impact on HNK-induced apoptosis.

Thus, we sought to examine ERG protein expression in a cohort of rapid autopsy patients with lethal metastatic CRPC (mCRPC).  Methods:   A tissue microarray (TMA) of tumor sites from these patients was evaluated for ERG, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and androgen receptor (AR) expression by IHC and correlated with ERG rearrangement status by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). IHC was scored as the product of tumor cell staining intensity (0-3) and percentage of cells positive (0-100) (overall product score range = 0-300).  Results:   All 16 (100%) ERG rearrangement negative (ERG(neg) ) patients were also negative for ERG tumor cell expression (i.e., IHC product score = 0). Of the 10 ERG rearrangement positive (ERG(pos) ) patients, two (20%) were completely negative for ERG tumor cell expression, while eight (80%) had weak ERG expression (median IHC product score = 5-110). Of these eight ERG(pos) patients, five (63%) had at least one tumor site without any detectable ERG expression. For a given ERG(pos) patient, ERG expression varied both between and within tumor sites; AR and PSA expression also varied between tumor sites, and there was no significant correlation between ERG and AR or PSA expression.

The tumour microenvironment also provides regulatory control, but the balance and interplay between androgens and oestrogens at the human prostate tumour interface is unknown. This study reveals a central and dominant role for oestrogen in the microenvironment, fuelling a pro-tumourigenic loop of inflammatory cytokines involving recruitment of mast cells by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Mast cell numbers were increased in human PCa clinical specimens, specifically within the peritumoural stroma. Human mast cells were also shown to express ERα and ERβ, with oestradiol directly stimulating mast cell proliferation and migration as well as altered cytokine/chemokine expression. There was a significant shift in the oestrogen:androgen balance in CAFs versus normal prostatic fibroblasts (NPFs), with a profound increase to ER:AR expression. Androgen signalling is also reduced in CAFs, while ERα and ERβ transcriptional activity is not, allowing oestrogen to dictate hormone action in the tumour microenvironment. Gene microarray analyses identified CXCL12 as a major oestrogen-driven target gene in CAFs, and CAFs recruit mast cells via CXCL12 in a CXCR4-dependent manner.

Androgen blocking treatment was stopped after surgery; estradiol treatment however was continued.  Conclusions:   This case points to the importance of routine investigation of family history in trans-women.

There is now increased understanding that invasive cribriform carcinoma is a relatively aggressive disease. This study was based on 233 radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens collected at the Department of Pathology, Umraniye Education and Research Hospital, from 2006 to 2013. We assessed the cribriform foci associated with the more definitive patterns 3, 4, and 5 elsewhere on the RP specimens and evaluated the association of the presence of cribriform pattern (CP) with biochemical prostate-specific antigen recurrence (BPR). In Cox regression model, taking into account the Gleason score (GS), pathologic stage, surgical margin (SM) status, presence of a CP, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a positive SM, and the presence of a CP were independent predictors of BPR after RP. We observed BPR more frequently in GS 3+3 cases with a CP than in those without a CP (p=0.008). There was no significant difference in BPR status for cases with GS 3+4, 4+3, 4+5, and 5+4 when the patients were stratified by the presence of a CP. On the basis of these data, we suggest that the classification of CP into Gleason pattern 4 has value in predicting BPR status after RP.

We sought to characterize life expectancy and treatment in a population-based cohort of men with differing ages and comorbidity burdens at diagnosis.  Methods:   We sampled 96,032 men aged ≥66 years with early-stage prostate cancer who had Gleason scores ≤7 and were diagnosed during 1991 to 2007 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. We calculated cumulative incidence of other-cause mortality and determined treatment patterns among subgroups defined by age and Charlson comorbidity index scores.  Results:   Overall, life expectancy was <10 years (10-year other-cause mortality rate, >50%) for 50,049 of 96,032 men (52%). Life expectancy differed by age and comorbidity score and was <10 years for men ages 66 to 69 years with Charlson scores ≥2, for men ages 70 to 74 years with Charlson scores ≥1, and for all men ages 75 to 79 years and ≥80 years. Among those who had a life expectancy <10 years, treatment was aggressive (surgery, radiation, or brachytherapy) for 68% of men aged 66 to 69 years, 69% of men aged 70 to 74 years, 57% of men aged 75 to 79 years, and 24% of men aged ≥80 years.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed patients who were evaluated and pursued radical prostatectomy as primary treatment, by the same surgeons, in the prostate cancer multidisciplinary clinic (n = 194) and standard urology clinic (n = 741) at Duke University Medical Center from 2005 to 2009. Comparisons of baseline characteristics were examined using rank sum and χ(2) -tests. Differences in time to radical prostatectomy and oncological outcomes were evaluated using multivariate linear and Cox regression, respectively.  Results:   A greater proportion of high-risk patients (D'Amico criteria) were evaluated at the multidisciplinary clinic compared with the urology clinic (23.2% vs 15.6%, P = 0.014). Mean-adjusted time from biopsy to radical prostatectomy was shorter for multidisciplinary clinic patients (85.6 vs 96.8 days, P = 0.006). After a median follow up of 21 months, no significant difference was found between the multidisciplinary clinic and urology clinic in the risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, whether controlling for clinical (hazard ratio 0.71, P = 0.249) or pathological variables (hazard ratio 0.75, P = 0.349).

In this study, we have concentrated on malignancies diagnosed before the MPN diagnosis to eliminate the possible influence of MPN treatment. The patients were recruited from the Swedish and Norwegian cancer registries. One thousand seven hundred and 45 patients from the Swedish MPN Quality Registry and 468 patients from the Norwegian National Cancer Registry were included in this study covering a 3-yr period. The results show that primary concurrent cancer is higher among patients with MPN compared to the general population. When pooled together, the Swedish and the Norwegian cohort showed increased prevalence of all types of cancer in general compared with the general population, standard prevalence ratio (SPR) of 1.20 (95% CI 1.07-1.34). Significantly high SPRs were reached for skin malignant melanoma [1.89 (95% CI 1.33-2.62)], prostate cancer [1.39 (95% CI 1.11-1.71)], and hematologic cancer [1.49 (95% CI 1.00-2.12)]. In the polycythemia vera group, the risk of having prior malignant melanoma of the skin was significant, with an SPR of 2.20 (95% CI 1.17-3.77). For patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, no significant risks were found.

The purpose of this study was to determine if IL-17 indirectly regulates macrophage differentiation through up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the cancer cell lines.  Materials and methods:   Human cervical cancer HeLa, human lung cancer A549, and mouse prostate cancer Myc-CaP/CR cell lines were treated with recombinant IL-17; Western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis were utilized to examine the cellular responses.  Results:   IL-17 up-regulated expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein in HeLa, A549, and Myc- CaP/CR cell lines. IL-17's effects were mediated through nuclear factor-κB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways as the inhibitors of these pathways could inhibit IL-17- induced COX-2 expression. The conditional medium obtained from the cancer cells contained prostaglandin E2, the levels of which were increased by IL-17 treatment. When treated with the conditional medium, particularly with the IL-17-induced conditional medium, mouse RAW264.7 macrophages and human THP-1 monocytes expressed higher levels of IL-10 (a marker of M2 macrophages) than inducible nitric oxide synthase or tumor necrosis factor α (markers of M1 macrophages). In contrast, when RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells were treated directly with IL-17, expression of these marker genes was not markedly changed.  Conclusion:   The results of this study suggest that IL-17 indirectly promotes M2 macrophage differentiation through stimulation of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway in the cancer cells, thus IL-17 plays an indirect role in regulating the tumor immune microenvironment.""","""['Qingli Li', 'Lunxu Liu', 'Qiuyang Zhang', 'Sen Liu', 'Dongxia Ge', 'Zongbing You']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res Treat""","""['Interleukin-17 and prostaglandin E2 are involved in formation of an M2 macrophage-dominant microenvironment in lung cancer.', 'Effect of Galectin-9/Tim-3 pathway on the polarization of M1/M2 subtype in murine macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharide.', 'Non-small cell lung cancer cyclooxygenase-2-dependent regulation of cytokine balance in lymphocytes and macrophages: up-regulation of interleukin 10 and down-regulation of interleukin 12 production.', 'Interleukin 26 Skews Macrophage Polarization Towards M1 Phenotype by Activating cJUN and the NF-κB Pathway.', 'Sophoraflavanone G prevents Streptococcus mutans surface antigen I/II-induced production of NO and PGE2 by inhibiting MAPK-mediated pathways in RAW 264.7 macrophages.', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Promotes the Tumorigenesis, Lymphangiogenesis, and Lymphatic Metastasis in Cervical Cancer via Activating VEGFC-Mediated AKT and ERK Pathways.', 'Candida albicans Promotes Oral Cancer via IL-17A/IL-17RA-Macrophage Axis.', 'Cancer resistance to immunotherapy: What is the role of cancer stem cells?', 'The roles of metabolic profiles and intracellular signaling pathways of tumor microenvironment cells in angiogenesis of solid tumors.', 'Anti-PD-1 antibody-activated Th17 cells subvert re-invigoration of antitumor cytotoxic T-lymphocytes via myeloid cell-derived COX-2/PGE2.']"""

MR exams were independently reviewed by two abdominal radiologists blinded to pathology with disagreement resolved by consensus. An MRI lesion was defined as having hypointense T2 signal subjectively without corresponding T1 high signal intensity and low signal on ADC maps in the central gland.

An exception was the use of a two-step consent process (consented intervention arm participants for exams after randomization) relative to a one-step process (consented all participants prior to randomization) (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 2.0-2.5). Non-compliance percentages increased with further distance from screening centers, but ORs were not significantly different from 1.  Conclusions:   Many factors modestly influenced compliance.

A total of 147 patients with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer who underwent robotic eLND from May 2008 to December 2011 were included in this analysis. The dissection template extended to the ureter crossing the iliac vessels. We assessed lymph node yield, lymph node positivity, and perioperative outcomes. Lymph node positivity was also evaluated according to the number of lymph nodes (LNs) removed (<22 vs ≥22). The median number of LNs removed was 22 (11-51), and 97 positive LNs were found in 24 patients (16.3%). While the obturator fossa was the most common site for LN metastases (42.3%, 41/97), the internal iliac area was the most common area for a single positive LN packet (20.8%, 5/24). Eight patients (33.3%, 8/24) had positive LNs at the common iliac area. The incidence of positive LNs did not differ according to the number of LNs removed. Complications associated with eLND occurred in 21 patients (14.3%) and symptomatic lymphocele was found in five patients (3.4%). In conclusion, robotic eLND can be performed with minimal morbidity. Furthermore, LN yield and the node positive rate achieved using this robotic technique are comparable to those of open series. In addition, the extent of dissection is more important than the absolute number of LNs removed in eLND, and the robotic technique is not a prohibitive factor for performing eLND.""","""['Kwang Hyun Kim', 'Sey Kiat Lim', 'Kyo Chul Koo', 'Woong Kyu Han', 'Sung Joon Hong', 'Koon Ho Rha']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Extended lymph node dissection for intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer: do we have all the evidence?', 'Standardized comparison of robot-assisted limited and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Extended vs standard lymph node dissection in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer: a propensity-score-matching analysis.', 'Topography of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy: results of a combined molecular and histopathologic mapping study.', 'The role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection in the management of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'The Prevalence of Lower Limb and Genital Lymphedema after Prostate Cancer Treatment: A Systematic Review.', 'Difference in Frequency and Distribution of Nodal Metastases Between Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Results of a Superextended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection.', 'Body mass index is an independent predictor of Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complications in patients undergoing robot assisted radical prostatectomy with extensive pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Extended lymph node dissection for intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer: do we have all the evidence?']"""

The objective of this study was to investigate the significance of detrusor overactivity (DO) as a predictor of the early continence status following robot-assisted RP (RARP). This study included 84 consecutive patients with prostate cancer undergoing RARP. Urodynamic studies, including filling cystometry, pressure flow study, electromyogram of the external urethral sphincter and urethral pressure profile, were performed in these patients before surgery. Urinary continence was defined as the use of either no or one pad per day as a precaution only. DO was preoperatively observed in 30 patients (35.7%), and 55 (65.5%) and 34 (40.5%) were judged to be incontinent 1 and 3 months after RARP, respectively. At both 1 and 3 months after RARP, the incidences of incontinence in patients with DO were significantly higher than in those without DO. Of several demographic and urodynamic parameters, univariate analyses identified DO and maximal urethral closure pressure (MUCP) as significant predictors of the continence status at both 1 and 3 months after RARP. Furthermore, DO and MUCP appeared to be independently associated with the continence at both 1 and 3 months after RARP on multivariate analysis. These findings suggest that preoperatively observed DO could be a significant predictor of urinary incontinence early after RARP; therefore, it is recommended to perform urodynamic studies for patients who are scheduled to undergo RARP in order to comprehensively evaluate their preoperative vesicourethral functions.""","""['Akihiro Yanagiuchi', 'Hideaki Miyake', 'Kazushi Tanaka', 'Masato Fujisawa']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Use of preoperative factors including urodynamic evaluations and nerve-sparing status for predicting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Nerve-sparing technique contributes to the reduction of postprostatectomy incontinence.', 'Urodynamic evaluation before and immediately after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Characteristics of urodynamic study parameters associated with intermediate-term continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in elderly patients.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Balancing continence function and oncological outcomes during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Urinary continence outcomes of four years of follow-up and predictors of early and late urinary continence in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Evaluation of urodynamic parameters after sling surgery in men with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence.', 'Comprehensive approach for post-prostatectomy incontinence in the era of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The Effect of the Vesical Adaptation Response to Diuresis on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms after Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: A Pilot Proof of Concept Study.', 'Urodynamic assessment of bladder and urethral function among men with lower urinary tract symptoms after radical prostatectomy: A comparison between men with and without urinary incontinence.']"""

Methods and materials:   We analyzed a unique cohort of 94 consecutively performed prostate seed implant patients, associated with excellent dosimetric and clinical outcomes. For each patient, an ultrasound (US) preimplant and two CT postimplant (Day 0 and Day 30) studies were available. Measures for similarity were created and computed using feature vectors based on two classes of moments: first, invariant to rotation and translation, and the second polar-radius moments invariant to rotation, translation, and scaling. Both similarity measures were calibrated using controlled perturbations (random and systematic) of seed positions and contours in different size implants, thus producing meaningful numerical threshold values used in the clinical analysis.  Results:   An important finding is that similarity, for both seed distributions and contours, improves significantly when scaling invariance is added to translation and rotation. No correlation between seed and contours similarity was found. In the setting of preplanned prostate seed implants using preloaded needles, based on our data, similarity between preimplant and postimplant plans does not correlate with either minimum dose to 90% of the volume of the prostate or analogous similarity metrics for prostate contours.  Conclusions:   We have developed novel tools and metrics, which will allow practitioners to better understand the relationship between preimplant and postimplant plans. Geometrical similarity between a preplan and an actual implant, although useful, does not seem to be necessary to achieve minimum dose to 90% of the volume of the prostate-good dosimetric implants.""","""['Dorin A Todor', 'Mitchell S Anscher', 'Jeremy D Karlin', 'Michael P Hagan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Correlation between pre- and postimplant dosimetry for iodine-125 seed implants for localized prostate cancer.', 'Effect of edema associated with 131Cs prostate permanent seed implants on dosimetric quality indices.', 'Comparison of intraoperative dosimetric implant representation with postimplant dosimetry in patients receiving prostate brachytherapy.', 'Sensitivity of clinically relevant dosimetric parameters to contouring uncertainty in postimplant dosimetry of low-dose-rate prostate permanent seed brachytherapy.', 'Prostate volume measurement by transrectal ultrasound and computed tomography before and after permanent prostate brachytherapy.']"""

In fact, it is severely flawed and, as such, fraught with controversy. Our current strategy has arisen from the imprecision of our diagnostic pathway. We do not know where the cancer is, so we subject the prostate to randomly placed needles in the hope of hitting the tumor. This leads to overdiagnosis, underdiagnosis, missclassification of risk and overtreatment and undertreatment. If we do find cancer, we usually subject the entire prostate to radiotherapy or surgery, which damages the surrounding structures--neurovascular bundles, external urinary sphincter, rectum, and bladder neck. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, coupled with an intensive sampling strategy (targeted biopsies), might be able to rule out clinically significant lesions with a negative predictive value in the order of 90% to 95%. Focal therapy certainly leads to less genitourinary and rectal side effects. Current data from more than 3,000 men treated internationally show that incontinence after focal therapy is 0% to 5% (radical therapy can lead to incontinence in 15%-20%) whereas erectile dysfunction occurs in 5% to 10% of men with good baseline function (radical therapy rates vary between 30% and 60%).

However, 22% of human disease mutations occur in natively unstructured segments of proteins known as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). This therefore implicates defective IDR functionality in various human diseases including cancer. The functionality of IDRs is partly attributable to short linear motifs (SLiMs), but it remains an open question how much defects in SLiMs contribute to human diseases. A proteome-wide comparison of the distribution of missense mutations from disease and non-disease mutation datasets revealed that, in IDRs, disease mutations are more likely to occur within SLiMs than neutral missense mutations. Moreover, compared to neutral missense mutations, disease mutations more frequently impact functionally important residues of SLiMs, cause changes in the physicochemical properties of SLiMs, and disrupt more SLiM-mediated interactions. Analysis of these mutations resulted in a comprehensive list of experimentally validated or predicted SLiMs disrupted in disease. Furthermore, this in-depth analysis suggests that 'prostate cancer pathway' is particularly enriched for proteins with disease-related SLiMs. The contribution of mutations in SLiMs to disease may currently appear small when compared to mutations in globular domains. However, our analysis of mutations in predicted SLiMs suggests that this contribution might be more substantial. Therefore, when analysing the functional impact of mutations on proteins, SLiMs in proteins should not be neglected. Our results suggest that an increased focus on SLiMs in the coming decades will improve our understanding of human diseases and aid in the development of targeted treatments.""","""['Bora Uyar', 'Robert J Weatheritt', 'Holger Dinkel', 'Norman E Davey', 'Toby J Gibson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Biosyst""","""['Bioinformatics Approaches for Predicting Disordered Protein Motifs.', 'Attributes of short linear motifs.', 'Dynamic, but Not Necessarily Disordered, Human-Virus Interactions Mediated through SLiMs in Viral Proteins.', 'Interactome-wide prediction of short, disordered protein interaction motifs in humans.', 'Computational prediction of short linear motifs from protein sequences.', 'Intrinsically disordered proteins and conformational noise: The hypothesis a decade later.', 'Short Linear Motifs in Colorectal Cancer Interactome and Tumorigenesis.', 'The nexus between RNA-binding proteins and their effectors.', 'Investigating the eukaryotic host-like SLiMs in microbial mimitopes and their potential as novel drug targets for treating autoimmune diseases.', 'β-Synuclein: An Enigmatic Protein with Diverse Functionality.']"""

The identification of new, non-invasive biomarkers might allow improvement of the direct diagnostic or prognostic ability of already available tools. Here, we took the innovative approach of interrogating the activity of exopeptidases in the serum of cancer patients with the aim of establishing a distinction based on enzymatic function, instead of simple protein levels, as a means to biomarker discovery. We first analyzed two well-characterized mouse models of prostate cancer, each with a distinct genetic lesion, and established that broad exopeptidase and targeted aminopeptidase activity tests reveal proteolytic changes associated with tumor development. We also describe new peptide-based freeze-frame reagents uniquely suited to probe the altered balance of selected aminopeptidases, as opposed to the full array of exopeptidases, and/or their modulators in patient serum or plasma. One particular proteolytic activity was impaired in animals with aggressive disease relative to cancer-free littermates. We identified the protease in question as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) by analyzing selected knockout mice and evaluating the effect of specific inhibitors. DPP4 activity was also reduced in the sera of patients with metastatic prostate cancer relative to patients with localized disease or healthy controls. However, no significant differences in DPP4 serum levels were observed, which established the loss of activity as the result of impaired enzymatic function. Biochemical analysis indicated that reduced activity was the result not of post-translational modifications or allosteric changes, but instead of a low-molecular-weight inhibitor. After we adjusted for age and total prostate-specific antigen, reduced DPP4 activity remained a significant predictor of cancer status.

The risk of urinary retention (UR) following hypofractionated radiotherapy has yet to be fully elucidated. This study sought to evaluate OVS and UR requiring catheterization following SBRT for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Patients treated with SBRT for localized prostate cancer from February 2008 to July 2011 at Georgetown University were included in this study. Treatment was delivered using the CyberKnife® with doses of 35 Gy-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. UR was prospectively scored using the CTCAE v.3. Patient-reported OVS were assessed using the IPSS-obstructive subdomain at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. Associated bother was evaluated via the EPIC-26.  Results:   269 patients at a median age of 69 years received SBRT with a median follow-up of 3 years. The mean prostate volume was 39 cc. Prior to treatment, 50.6% of patients reported moderate to severe lower urinary track symptoms per the IPSS and 6.7% felt that weak urine stream and/or incomplete emptying were a moderate to big problem. The 2-year actuarial incidence rates of acute and late UR ≥ grade 2 were 39.5% and 41.4%. Alpha-antagonist utilization rose at one month (58%) and 18 months (48%) post-treatment. However, Grade 3 UR was low with only 4 men (1.5%) requiring catheterization and/or TURP. A mean baseline IPSS-obstructive score of 3.6 significantly increased to 5.0 at 1 month (p < 0.0001); however, it returned to baseline in 92.6% within a median time of 3 months. Late increases in OVS were common, but transient. Only 7.1% of patients felt that weak urine stream and/or incomplete emptying was a moderate to big problem at two years post-SBRT (p = 0.6854).  Conclusions:   SBRT treatment caused an acute increase in OVS which peaked within the first month post-treatment, though acute UR requiring catheterization was rare. OVS returned to baseline in > 90% of patients within a median time of three months. Transient Late increases in OVS were common.

Following infection with the Ad5/3-Id1-SEAP-Id1-mCherry vector, expression of the SEAP and mCherry reporters was shown to increase with increasing levels of cellular Id1. No correlation was observed between Id1 and PSA. To evaluate in vivo performance, flank tumors were grown in athymic male mice using three prostate cancer cell lines. Following intra-tumoral injection of the vector, tumors formed by cells with high Id1 had the greatest reporter expression. Interestingly, tumors with the lowest levels of Id1 and reporter expression produced the greatest amounts of PSA.

However, the results are still conflicting. We aim to systematically evaluate the potential of promoter methylation and polymorphism in E-cadherin gene to confer a risk to prostate cancer through meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched to identify eligible studies published before April 1, 2014. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated by using the random-effect model or the fixed-effect model, according to heterogeneity test. Subgroup analyses were also performed to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were used to test the robustness of our results. We performed a meta-analysis of 22 included studies, with 11 on -160C/A polymorphism and another 11 on promoter methylation of E-cadherin gene. Our meta-analysis results suggested that E-cadherin -160C/A polymorphism may be a potential risk factor for prostate cancer. Furthermore, we observed that the frequencies of promoter methylation of E-cadherin gene in the prostate cancer tissues were significantly higher than those of normal tissues, indicating that promoter methylation of E-cadherin gene may play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis. In conclusion, the present meta-analysis provides further evidence that promoter methylation and -160C/A polymorphism of E-cadherin gene may confer a risk to prostate cancer. Identifying these risk factors for prostate cancer will improve early detection, allow for selective chemoprevention, and provide further insights into its disease mechanisms.""","""['Zheng Chang', 'Hongbing Zhou', 'Yi Liu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Role of CDH1 promoter polymorphism and DNA methylation in bladder carcinogenesis: a meta-analysis.', 'E-cadherin (CDH1) gene -160C/A polymorphism and the risk of colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis involving 17,291 subjects.', 'Contribution of the -160C/A polymorphism in the E-cadherin promoter to cancer risk: a meta-analysis of 47 case-control studies.', 'Meta-analysis of association between E-cadherin promoter methylation and lung cancer risk.', 'Association of E-cadherin methylation with risk of nasopharyngeal cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Differences in E-Cadherin and Syndecan-1 Expression in Different Types of Ameloblastomas.', 'The MIF -173G/C gene polymorphism increase gastrointestinal cancer and hematological malignancy risk: evidence from a meta-analysis and FPRP test.', 'Impact of Candidate Genetic Polymorphisms in Prostate Cancer: An Overview.', 'MiR-133a Is Functionally Involved in Doxorubicin-Resistance in Breast Cancer Cells MCF-7 via Its Regulation of the Expression of Uncoupling Protein 2.', 'The clinicopathological significance and potential drug target of E-cadherin in NSCLC.']"""

Experimental design:   Dominant tumor nodules from radical prostatectomy specimens of 105 African American men (AAM) were compared with 113 dominant nodules from Caucasian men (CaM). Clinical and pathologic characteristics of the two groups were similar. SPINK1 overexpression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, ERG rearrangement and PTEN deletion by FISH, and SPOP mutation by Sanger sequencing.  Results:   ERG rearrangement was identified in 48 of 113 tumors (42.5%) in CaM and 29 of 105 tumors (27.6%) in AAM (P = 0.024). PTEN deletion was seen in 19 of 96 tumors (19.8%) in CaM and 7 of 101 tumors (6.9%) in AAM (P = 0.011). SPINK1 overexpression was present in 9 of 110 tumors (8.2%) in CaM and 25 of 105 tumors (23.4%) in AAM (P = 0.002). SPOP mutation was identified in 8 of 78 (10.3%) tumors in CaM and 4 of 88 (4.5%) tumors in AAM (P = 0.230). When adjusted for age, body mass index, Gleason score, and pathologic stage, ERG rearrangement and SPINK1 overexpression remain significantly different (P = 0.018 and P = 0.008, respectively), and differences in PTEN deletion and SPOP mutation approach significance (P = 0.061 and P = 0.087, respectively).  Conclusions:   Significant molecular differences exist between prostate cancers in AAM and CaM.

Materials and methods:   Between January 2005 and June 2012, 89 patients (mean age, 64 years; range, 50-77 years) underwent prebiopsy MRI, transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy, and prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma. On MR images, prostate cancer was diagnosed if T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced images were all positive. Preoperative cancers were classified as low, intermediate, high, and very high risk using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, biopsy Gleason score, or MRI tumor stage. Postoperative cancers were classified as low, intermediate, high, and very high risk using PSA level, prostatectomy Gleason score, and prostatectomy tumor stage.

Plasma concentration-time profiles for 2-HOF were acquired from a phase II study in 24 patients and the dissolution of the MR formulation was investigated in vitro. Human physiological values and the specific physicochemical properties of 2-HOF were obtained from the literature or calculated via established algorithms. A compartmental modeling approach was adopted for tissue and blood in the prostate gland, where the compartments were modeled as a series of concentric spherical shells contouring the centrally positioned depot formulation. Discrete fluid connections between the blood compartments were described by the representative flow of blood, whereas the mass transport of drug from tissue to tissue and tissue to blood was described by a one-dimensional diffusion approximation. An empirical dissolution approach was adopted for the release of 2-HOF from the formulation. The model adequately described the plasma concentration-time profiles of 2-HOF. Predictive simulations indicated that the local tissue concentration of 2-HOF within a distance of 5 mm from the depot formulation was approximately 40 times higher than that of unbound 2-HOF in plasma. The simulations also indicated that spreading the formulation throughout the prostate gland would expose more of the gland and increase the overall release rate of 2-HOF from the given dose. The increased release rate would initially increase the tissue and plasma concentrations but would also reduce the terminal half-life of 2-HOF in plasma. Finally, an in vitro-in vivo correlation of the release of 2-HOF from the parenteral MR formulation was established. This study shows that intraprostatic 2-HOF concentrations are significantly higher than systemic plasma concentrations and that increased distribution of 2-HOF throughout the gland, using strategic imaging-guided administration, is possible. This novel parenteral MR formulation, thus, facilitates good pharmacological effect while minimizing the risk of side effects.""","""['Erik Sjögren', 'Teuvo L Tammela', 'Bo Lennernäs', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Taina Isotalo', 'Lars-Åke Malmsten', 'Niklas Axén', 'Hans Lennernäs']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['An Intraprostatic Modified Release Formulation of Antiandrogen 2-Hydroxyflutamide for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Pharmacokinetics of the controlled-release nisoldipine coat-core tablet formulation.', 'In vitro dissolution and in vivo oral absorption of methylphenidate from a bimodal release formulation in healthy volunteers.', 'A new LH-RH agonist for treatment of prostate cancer, 3-month controlled-release formulation of goserelin acetate (Zoladex LA 10.8 mg depot)--outline of pre-clinical and clinical studies.', 'Role of in vitro release models in formulation development and quality control of parenteral depots.', 'Silica-Based Stimuli-Responsive Systems for Antitumor Drug Delivery and Controlled Release.', 'Drug Absorption Parameters Obtained Using the Isolated Perfused Rat Lung Model Are Predictive of Rat In Vivo Lung Absorption.', 'Porcine and Human In Vivo Simulations for Doxorubicin-Containing Formulations Used in Locoregional Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatment.']"""

Detectors based on a large volume of liquid scintillator have shown great promise in providing fast and high-resolution measurements of proton treatment fields. However, previous work with these detectors has been limited to two-dimensional measurements, and the quantitative measurement of dose distributions was lacking. The purpose of the current study is to assess the feasibility of reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) scintillation light distributions of spot scanning proton beams using a scintillation system. The proposed system consists of a tank of liquid scintillator imaged by charge-coupled device cameras at three orthogonal viewing angles. Because of the limited number of viewing angles, we developed a profile-based technique to obtain an initial estimate that can improve the quality of the 3D reconstruction.

The goal of our work is to assess the feasibility of using electronic health records (EHRs) and automated informatics methods to efficiently validate a recent drug repurposing association of metformin with reduced cancer mortality.  Methods:   By linking two large EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Mayo Clinic to their tumor registries, we constructed a cohort including 32,415 adults with a cancer diagnosis at Vanderbilt and 79,258 cancer patients at Mayo from 1995 to 2010. Using automated informatics methods, we further identified type 2 diabetes patients within the cancer cohort and determined their drug exposure information, as well as other covariates such as smoking status. We then estimated HRs for all-cause mortality and their associated 95% CIs using stratified Cox proportional hazard models. HRs were estimated according to metformin exposure, adjusted for age at diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, tobacco use, insulin use, cancer type, and non-cancer Charlson comorbidity index.  Results:   Among all Vanderbilt cancer patients, metformin was associated with a 22% decrease in overall mortality compared to other oral hypoglycemic medications (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88) and with a 39% decrease compared to type 2 diabetes patients on insulin only (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.73). Diabetic patients on metformin also had a 23% improved survival compared with non-diabetic patients (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.85). These associations were replicated using the Mayo Clinic EHR data. Many site-specific cancers including breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate demonstrated reduced mortality with metformin use in at least one EHR.  Conclusions:   EHR data suggested that the use of metformin was associated with decreased mortality after a cancer diagnosis compared with diabetic and non-diabetic cancer patients not on metformin, indicating its potential as a chemotherapeutic regimen.

Conventional single-chain bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), that directly cross-link T cells and tumor cells, hold great potential for efficient tumor treatment. However, rapid development of novel bsAbs is hampered by laborious optimization to improve their efficacy and reduce potential side effects. To accelerate the development of a novel antibody tool for the redirection of T cells to different tumor-associated antigens, we recently introduced a modular targeting system.  Methods:   We here describe a novel modular system for treatment of prostate cancer by retargeting of T cells to the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA). Functionality of the novel PSCA-specific modular system was investigated in vitro by T cell activation and chromium release assays as well as in immunodeficient mice.  Results:   Similar to a conventional bsAb CD3-PSCA, the novel PSCA-specific modular system induces activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and highly efficient target-specific tumor cell lysis. The novel TM was ready-to-use from the time point of construction and functional at low E:T ratios and picomolar concentrations without further optimization. In addition, the PSCA-specific modular system delays outgrowth of s.c. tumors in mice comparable to bsAb CD3-PSCA.  Conclusions:   We have developed a novel PSCA-specific modular system which triggers an efficient T cell-mediated killing of PSCA+ tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The new Ab-based targeting strategy can functionally replace conventional bsAbs and allows a flexible redirection of T cells to different tumor-associated antigens.""","""['Claudia Arndt', 'Anja Feldmann', 'Katrin Töpfer', 'Stefanie Koristka', 'Marc Cartellieri', 'Achim Temme', 'Armin Ehninger', 'Gerhard Ehninger', 'Michael Bachmann']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Simultaneous targeting of prostate stem cell antigen and prostate-specific membrane antigen improves the killing of prostate cancer cells using a novel modular T cell-retargeting system.', 'Dual antigen target-based immunotherapy for prostate cancer eliminates the growth of established tumors in mice.', 'Novel humanized and highly efficient bispecific antibodies mediate killing of prostate stem cell antigen-expressing tumor cells by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen and cancer risk, mechanisms and therapeutic implications.', 'Advances in specific immunotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'A novel ACE2 decoy for both neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants and killing of infected cells.', 'Palbociclib impairs the proliferative capacity of activated T cells while retaining their cytotoxic efficacy.', 'Combining Radiation- with Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer: Influence of Radiation on T Cells.', 'Advances in modular control of CAR-T therapy with adapter-mediated CARs.', 'Development and Functional Characterization of a Versatile Radio-/Immunotheranostic Tool for Prostate Cancer Management.']"""

Theoretically, our unique strategy should allow us to simultaneously retarget T cells to different tumor antigens by combining the EM with two or more different monovalent/monospecific TMs or even with bivalent/bispecific TMs, thereby overcoming limitations of a monospecific treatment such as the selection of target-negative tumor escape variants.  Methods:   In order to advance our recently introduced prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA)-specific modular system for a dual-targeting of prostate cancer cells, two additional TMs were constructed: a monovalent/monospecific TM directed against the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and a bivalent/bispecific TM (bsTM) with specificity for PSMA and PSCA. The functionality of the novel dual-targeting strategies was analyzed by performing T cell activation and chromium release assays.  Results:   Similar to the PSCA-specific modular system, the novel PSMA-specific modular system mediates an efficient target-dependent and -specific tumor cell lysis at low E:T ratios and picomolar Ab concentrations. Moreover, by combination of the EM with either the bispecific TM directed to PSMA and PSCA or both monospecifc TMs directed to either PSCA or PSMA, dual-specific targeting complexes were formed which allowed us to kill potential escape variants expressing only one or the other target antigen.

We previously demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (exosomes) may play a role in regulating docetaxel resistance. Here, we investigated intracellular and extracellular (exosomal) miRNAs related to docetaxel resistance.  Methods:   Following global miRNA profiling of cell line models of docetaxel-resistance and their corresponding exosomes, we investigated the clinical relevance of four selected miRNAs (miR-598, miR-34a, miR-146a, miR-148a) in four publically available clinical cohorts representing both primary and advanced disease in tissue and urine specimens. One of these miRNAs, miR-34a was selected for functional evaluation by miRNA inhibition and over-expression in vitro. We further assessed the panel of miRNAs for their combined clinical relevance as a biomarker signature by examining their common predicted targets.  Results:   A strong correlation was found between the detection of miRNAs in exosomes and their corresponding cells of origin. Of the miRNAs chosen for further validation and clinical assessment, decreased miR-34a levels showed substantial clinical relevance and so was chosen for further analysis. Manipulating miR-34a in prostate cancer cells confirms that this miRNA regulates BCL-2 and may, in part, regulate response to docetaxel. When combined, these miRNAs are predicted to regulate a range of common mRNA targets, two of which (e.g., SNCA, SCL7A5) demonstrate a strong relationship with prostate cancer progression and poor prognosis.  Conclusions:   This study supports the extracellular environment as an important source of minimally invasive predictive biomarkers representing their cellular origin.

FAP is a post-prolyl endopeptidase whose expression in a healthy adult is largely restricted to the cancer-associated stroma. FAP-targeted prodrugs with a 100-fold greater therapeutic window over the parent compound were previously generated.  Methods:   Prodrugs and non-cleavable controls were incubated in the presence of FAP. Plasma and tumor half-lives (t1/2) of the full-length and active forms of the prodrugs were determined using LCMS. Biodistribution studies of prodrug activation were performed. Histopathological analysis of tissues from treated animals were compared to vehicle-treated controls. Toxicity and efficacy studies were performed in human breast (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer xenografts models.  Results:   These FAP-activated prodrugs have a significantly slower clearance from tumor tissue than the circulation (∼12 vs. ∼4.5 hr). Micromolar concentrations of active drug persist in the tumor. Active drug is detected in non-target tissues; however, histopathologic evaluation reveals no evidence of drug-induced toxicity. A FAP-activated prodrug (ERGETGP-S12ADT) inhibits tumor growth in multiple human breast and prostate cancer xenograft models. The anti-tumor effect is comparable to that observed with docetaxel, but results in significantly less toxicity.  Conclusion:   FAP-activated prodrugs are a viable strategy for the management of prostate and other cancers. These prodrugs exhibit less toxicity than a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent.

We sought to evaluate the clinical activity of enzalutamide versus docetaxel in men with mCRPC who progressed on abiraterone.  Methods:   We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of consecutive mCRPC patients who had progressed on abiraterone therapy and subsequently received either enzalutamide (n=30) or docetaxel (n=31). We evaluated clinical outcomes including prostate-specific antigen decline of >30% (PSA30) or >50% (PSA50), PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and clinical/radiographic PFS. We performed multivariable modeling to control for baseline and on-treatment differences between groups.  Results:   Compared to subjects who received enzalutamide post-abiraterone, subjects who received docetaxel post-abiraterone had more bone metastases, more visceral metastases, higher baseline PSA, and had more frequent PSA tests while on-treatment. There were no significant differences in PSA30 (41% for enzalutamide vs. 53% for docetaxel) or PSA50 (34% vs. 40%) response rates between the two groups; there remained no difference after stratifying by presence/absence of prior response to abiraterone. Median PSA-PFS was 4.1 versus 4.1 months for the enzalutamide and docetaxel cohorts, respectively (HR 1.35, 95% CI, 0.53-3.66, P=0.502).

A high-fat Western-style diet is a known risk factor for prostate cancer and increases oxidative stress.  Methods:   We evaluated the association between dietary animal fat and expression of antioxidant enzymes, particularly glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3), in the early stages of transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. Six-week-old male nontransgenic and TRAMP mice were placed on high animal fat (45% Kcal fat) or control (10% Kcal fat) diets and sacrificed after 5 or 10 weeks.  Results:   The histopathological score increased with age and high-fat diet consumption. The histopathological scores in dorsal and lateral lobes increased in the 10-week high-fat diet group (6.2±0.2 and 6.2±0.4, respectively) versus the 10-week control diet group (5.3±0.3 and 5.2±0.2, respectively). GPx3 decreased both at the mRNA and protein levels in mouse prostate. GPx3 mRNA expression decreased (∼36.27% and ∼23.91%, respectively) in the anterior and dorsolateral prostate of TRAMP mice fed a high-fat diet compared to TRAMP mice fed a control diet. Cholesterol treatment increased PC-3 human prostate cancer cell proliferation, decreased GPx3 mRNA and protein levels, and increased H2 O2 levels in culture medium. Moreover, increasing GPx3 mRNA expression by troglitazone in PC-3 cells decreased cell proliferation and lowered H2 O2 levels.  Conclusions:   Dietary fat enhances prostate cancer progression, possibly by suppressing GPx3 expression and increasing proliferation of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) epithelial cells.""","""['Seo-Na Chang', 'Juhee Han', 'Tamer Said Abdelkader', 'Tae-Hyoun Kim', 'Ji Min Lee', 'Juha Song', 'Kyung-Sul Kim', 'Jong-Hwan Park', 'Jae-Hak Park']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Glutathione Peroxidase 3 Inhibits Prostate Tumorigenesis in TRAMP Mice.', 'High fat diet reduces the expression of glutathione peroxidase 3 in mouse prostate.', 'Dietary methionine restriction inhibits prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in TRAMP mice.', 'Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model: A good alternative to study PCa progression and chemoprevention approaches.', 'A review of the existing grading schemes and a proposal for a modified grading scheme for prostatic lesions in TRAMP mice.', 'GPx3 knockdown inhibits the proliferation and DNA synthesis and enhances the early apoptosis of human spermatogonial stem cells via mediating CXCL10 and cyclin B1.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Role of microbiome and its metabolite, short chain fatty acid in prostate cancer.', 'Dietary fats and their sources in association with the risk of bladder cancer: A pooled analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies.', 'Neferine improves oxidative stress and apoptosis in benign prostate hyperplasia via Nrf2-ARE pathway.']"""

Here, we addressed Runx2 contribution to formation of prostate cancer-related osteolytic and osteoblastic bone lesions by mediating TGFβ/BMP signaling through direct interaction with Smads. Further, we examined involvement of the Runx2-Smad complex in mediating tumor growth and distal metastasis. To identify Runx2-Smad-specific mechanisms of prostate tumor activity in bone, we generated PC3 prostate cancer cell lines expressing Runx2-WT or one of two mutant proteins (Runx2-HTY and Runx2-ΔC) that each disrupt the Runx2-Smad interaction, either directly through a point mutation or by deletion of the functional C-terminus, respectively. Intratibial tumors generated from these cells revealed that Runx2-WT-expressing cells resulted in predominantly osteolytic disease, whereas cells expressing mutant proteins exhibited tumors with mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic lesions. Extent of bone loss and woven bone formation was assessed by radiography and micro-computed tomography. Bioluminescent imaging showed the presence of labeled prostate cancer cells in the lung at the latest time point examined, with Runx2-WT group exhibiting increased incidence of tumor cells in lung. Notably, disruption of the Runx2-Smad interaction significantly reduced incidence and size of lung tumors. Altered expression of Runx2 target genes involved in invasion, growth, adhesion and metastasis supported our findings. Thus, our studies demonstrate that Runx2 in prostate cancer cells plays a significant role in intratibial prostate cancer-related tumor growth and bone loss through mechanisms mediated by the Runx2-Smad signaling pathway.

In this study, our aim was to predict the immunologic and clinical responses of vaccination therapy with an Ii-key-modified HER-2/neu peptide (Ii-key/HER-2(776-790) or AE37), applied in our recent phase I study in patients with prostate cancer. To this end, we retrospectively analyzed our data derived from immunologic determinations before, during and after primary series of vaccinations with AE37, as well as after one AE37 booster injection. Using the obtained data, we then observed the relationship between the immunologic parameters and clinical outcome of patients. We found that preexisting levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) had an inverse correlation with in vivo and in vitro immunologic responses to the AE37 vaccine which were measured as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in response to the native HER-2(776-790) (or AE36) peptide, respectively. Patients with preexistent IFN-γ immunity to AE36 developed positive DTH reactions after primary vaccinations and booster. Moreover, we could detect a direct correlation between IFN-γ production and DTH reactions in response to AE36 challenge in our vaccinated patients. DTH reactions were a stronger indicator for patients' overall survival (OS) than preexistent or vaccine-induced IFN-γ immunity. In contrast, we found that preexisting TGF-β levels were correlated with shorter patients' OS.

Whether this treatment-induced change to the bone microenvironment affects disseminated tumour cells, potentially stimulating development of bone metastasis, remains to be determined. The objective of this study was to use an in vivo model mimicking androgen ablation to establish the effects of this intervention on disseminated prostate cancer cells in bone. We mimicked the effects of androgen deprivation on bone metastasis by castrating 12-week-old BALB/c nude mice that had disseminated, hormone-insensitive PC3 prostate cancer cells present in the long bones. Castration caused increased bone resorption and loss of bone volume, compared with sham operation. In addition, castration triggered growth of disseminated PC3 cells to form bone metastasis in 70% of animals. In contrast, only 10% of sham-operated animals had detectable long bone tumours. Weekly administration of 100 μg/kg zoledronic acid (ZOL) prevented castration-induced tumour growth in bone and increased bone volume, but did not eliminate the disseminated tumour cells. ZOL had no effect on tumour growth in the sham-operated animals, despite causing a significant increase in bone volume. This is the first demonstration that, in a model of prostate cancer bone metastasis, mimicking androgen ablation results in growth of disseminated tumour cells in bone through osteoclast-mediated mechanisms. We provide the first biological evidence supporting the administration of ZOL to prostate cancer patients at the time of androgen ablation to prevent subsequent relapse in bone.""","""['Penelope D Ottewell', 'Ning Wang', 'Joshua Meek', 'C Anne Fowles', 'Peter I Croucher', 'Colby L Eaton', 'Ingunn Holen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Zoledronic acid at the time of castration prevented castration-induced bone metastasis in mice.', 'Zoledronic acid at the time of castration prevented castration-induced bone metastasis in mice.', 'Zoledronic acid has differential antitumor activity in the pre- and postmenopausal bone microenvironment in vivo.', 'Efficacy of zoledronic acid for the elimination of disseminated tumor cells in a clinically relevant, spontaneously metastatic prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Rationale for zoledronic acid therapy in men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with or without bone metastasis.', 'Clinical efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in prostate and breast cancer.', 'Osteoblasts and osteoclasts: an important switch of tumour cell dormancy during bone metastasis.', 'Systematic Review on Multilevel Analysis of Radiation Effects on Bone Microarchitecture.', 'The Osteoclast Traces the Route to Bone Tumors and Metastases.', 'Tumor Dormancy: Biologic and Therapeutic Implications.', 'Mechanisms, Diagnosis and Treatment of Bone Metastases.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the association of primary Gleason grade (GG) at the site of PSM with subsequent clinical progression and mortality among patients with Gleason score (GS) 7 prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified 1036 patients who underwent RP between 1996 and 2002. A single uropathologist re-reviewed all specimens noted to have a PSM to record GG at the margin.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox models were used to analyze the association of margin primary GG with outcome.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 338 men (33%) had a PSM; of those, 242 had PSM GG3 and 96 had PSM GG4. Median postoperative follow-up was 13 yr. Compared with men with PSM GG3 or a negative SM, we noted that men with PSM GG4 had significantly worse 15-yr systemic progression-free survival (74% vs. 90% vs. 93%, respectively; p<0.001) and cancer-specific survival (86% vs. 96% vs. 97%, respectively; p=0.002). On multivariable analysis, the presence of PSM GG4 was associated with increased risks of systemic progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.77; p=0.003) and death from PCa (HR: 3.93; p=0.02) among men with a PSM. Limitations include the relatively small rate of disease recurrence.  Conclusions:   PSM primary GG4 was independently associated with adverse oncologic outcomes among men with GS7 PCa. Pending external validation, GG at the PSM may be considered for inclusion in pathologic reports and risk stratification following RP.

Ubiquitin ligase E3s and proteasomes were thought to play essential roles in the development of cancers, therefore, they were proposed as therapy targets for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. Bortezomib, well-known as a proteasome inhibitor, has been observed with exact anticancer effect both in cell and animal models for several solid tumor types, including prostate cancer. To explore activities of the ubiquitin ligase E3s WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2 in oncogenesis and bone metastasis of prostate cancer, as well as in the functional mechanism of bortezomib in preventing prostate cancer, transcription and expression levels of WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2 genes in cell lines or tissues of benign prostate hyperplasia and human prostate cancer with and without bone metastasis were tested. Moreover, human prostate cancer PC3 cell lines were treated with bortezomib at different concentration gradients and then their proliferation at different time points, mRNA and protein levels were investigated. The results indicated that transcription and expression levels of WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2 genes in prostate cancer without bone metastasis were significantly higher compared to those in benign prostate hyperplasia (P<0.05), whereas significantly lower than prostate cancer metastatic to bone (P<0.05).

Among three derivatives, PHE, AMD and AMN, examined, AMD showed the highest inhibitory activity on LNCaP C-81 cell proliferation, following dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, AMD exhibited significant antiproliferative effect against a panel of PCa cells, but not normal prostate epithelial cells. Further, when compared to AMD, its derivative DME showed higher inhibitory activities on PCa cell proliferation, clonogenic potential and in vitro tumorigenicity. The inhibitory activity was apparently in part due to the induction of apoptosis. Mechanistic studies indicate that AMD and DME treatments inhibited both AR and PI3K/Akt signaling.

In humans, S-mandelic acid undergoes rapid chiral inversion to R-mandelic acid by an undefined pathway but it has been proposed to proceed via the acyl-CoA esters, S- and R-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl-CoA, in an analogous pathway to that for Ibuprofen. This study investigates chiral inversion of mandelic acid using purified human recombinant enzymes known to be involved in the Ibuprofen chiral inversion pathway. Both S- and R-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl-CoA were hydrolysed to mandelic acid by human acyl-CoA thioesterase-1 and -2 (ACOT1 and ACOT2), consistent with a possible role in the chiral inversion pathway. However, human α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR; P504S) was not able to catalyse exchange of the α-proton of S- and R-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl-CoA, a requirement for chiral inversion. Both S- and R-2-phenylpropanoyl-CoA were epimerised by AMACR, showing that it is the presence of the hydroxy group that prevents epimerisation of R- and S-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl-CoAs. The results show that it is unlikely that 2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl-CoA is an intermediate in the chiral inversion of mandelic acid, and that the chiral inversion of mandelic acid is via a different pathway to that of Ibuprofen and related drugs.""","""['Maksims Yevglevskis', 'Catherine R Bowskill', 'Chloe C Y Chan', 'Justin H-J Heng', 'Michael D Threadgill', 'Timothy J Woodman', 'Matthew D Lloyd']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Org Biomol Chem""","""['Hydrolysis of ibuprofenoyl-CoA and other 2-APA-CoA esters by human acyl-CoA thioesterases-1 and -2 and their possible role in the chiral inversion of profens.', 'Chiral inversion of 2-arylpropionyl-CoA esters by human α-methylacyl-CoA racemase 1A (P504S)--a potential mechanism for the anti-cancer effects of ibuprofen.', 'Synthesis and use of isotope-labelled substrates for a mechanistic study on human alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase 1A (AMACR; P504S).', 'α-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR): metabolic enzyme, drug metabolizer and cancer marker P504S.', 'Stereoselective Pharmacokinetics and Chiral Inversions of Some Chiral Hydroxy Group Drugs.', 'Racemases and epimerases operating through a 1,1-proton transfer mechanism: reactivity, mechanism and inhibition.', 'A study on the AMACR catalysed elimination reaction and its application to inhibitor testing.']"""

How managed care, thought by many to be a barrier to new technology, influences the dissemination of robotics is unknown. We sought to better understand the relationship between a market's managed-care penetration and the dissemination of robotic prostatectomy.  Methods:   We used SEER-Medicare data from 2003 through 2007 to identify men ≥66 years of age treated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. We categorized Health Service Areas (HSAs) according to the degree of managed-care penetration (ie, low vs high). We assessed adoption of robotic prostatectomy and utilization among adopting HSAs using Cox proportional-hazards and Poisson regression models, respectively.  Results:   Compared with markets with little managed care, highly penetrated markets had more racial diversity (24% vs 15% nonwhite, P < .01), higher population densities (1987 vs 422 people/square mile, P < .01), and higher median incomes ($49 374 vs $36 236, P < .01). Robotic prostatectomy adoption and utilization increased over time in both HSA categories. Compared with low managed-care markets, those with high managed care adopted robotic prostatectomy more rapidly (eg, probability 0.37 [low] vs 0.52 [high] in 2007; P < .01). However, the postadoption utilization of robotic prostatectomy was constrained in these highly penetrated markets (eg, probability 0.66 [low] vs 0.52 [high] in 2007; P < .01).  Conclusions:   High managed-care penetration was associated with more rapid robotic prostatectomy adoption. However, once adopted, utilization increased more slowly in these markets.

To address this, we previously developed three enzyme-containing fusion proteins targeted via annexin V to phosphatidylserine exposed on the tumor vasculature and tumor cells, using the enzymes L-methioninase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, or cytosine deaminase. In enzyme prodrug therapy, the fusion protein is allowed to bind to the tumor before a nontoxic drug precursor, a prodrug, is introduced. Upon interaction of the prodrug with the bound enzyme, an anticancer compound is formed, but only in the direct vicinity of the tumor, thereby mitigating the risk of side effects while creating high intratumoral drug concentrations. The applicability of these enzyme prodrug systems to treating prostate cancer has remained unexplored. Additionally, target availability may increase with the addition of low dose docetaxel treatment to the enzyme prodrug treatment, but this effect has not been previously investigated. To this end, we examined the binding strength and the cytotoxic efficacy (with and without docetaxel treatment) of these enzyme prodrug systems on the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3.  Results:   All three fusion proteins exhibited strong binding; dissociation constants were 0.572 nM for L-methioninase-annexin V (MT-AV), 0.406 nM for purine nucleoside phosphorylase-annexin V (PNP-AV), and 0.061 nM for cytosine deaminase-annexin V (CD-AV). MT-AV produced up to 99% cell death (p < 0.001) with limited cytotoxicity of the prodrug alone. PNP-AV with docetaxel created up to 78% cell death (p < 0.001) with no cytotoxicity of the prodrug alone. CD-AV with docetaxel displayed up to 60% cell death (p < 0.001) with no cytotoxicity of the prodrug alone. Docetaxel treatment created significant increases in cytotoxicity for PNP-AV and CD-AV.  Conclusions:   Strong binding of fusion proteins to the prostate cancer cells and effective cell killing suggest that the enzyme prodrug systems with MT-AV and PNP-AV may be effective treatment options.

Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) has emerged as a major mediator of bone resorption, commonly associated with cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus inhibitors of RANKL signaling have a potential in preventing bone loss. In the present study, we investigated the ability of triptolide, a diterpenoid isolated from Thunder of God Vine, to inhibit signaling by receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL) and to modulate osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and human cancer cells. We found that triptolide suppressed RANKL-induced differentiation of precursor cells to osteoclasts, and also inhibited osteoclast formation induced by human breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231), multiple myeloma cells (U266) and prostate tumor cells (PC-3).

Between 2006 and 2010, 166 patients implanted with (131)Cs had both intraoperative and postoperative dosimetry studies. All cases were monotherapy and doses of 115 were prescribed to the prostate. The dosimetric properties (D90, V150, and V100 for the prostate) of the studies were compared. Two conformity indices were also calculated and compared. Finally, the prostate was automatically sectioned into 6 sectors (anterior and posterior sectors at the base, midgland, and apex) and the intraoperative and postoperative dosimetry was compared in each individual sector. Postoperative dosimetry showed statistically significant changes (p < 0.01) in every dosimetric value except V150. In each significant case, the postoperative plans showed lower dose coverage. The conformity indexes also showed a bimodal frequency distribution with the index indicating poorer dose conformity in the postoperative plans. Sector analysis revealed less dose coverage postoperatively in the base and apex sectors with an increase in dose to the posterior midgland sector. Postoperative dosimetry overall and in specific sectors of the prostate differs significantly from intraoperative planning.

Methods:   We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for second primary tumours comparing men diagnosed with PCa between 1980 and 2010 in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (n = 20,559), and the general male population in the Canton.  Results:   A total of 1,718 men developed a second primary tumour after PCa diagnosis, with lung and colon cancer being the most common (15 and 13% respectively). The SIR for overall second primary cancer was 1.11 (95%CI: 1.06-1.17). Site-specific SIRs varied from 1.19 (1.05-1.34) to 2.89 (2.62-4.77) for lung and thyroid cancer, respectively. When stratified by treatment, the highest SIR was observed for thyroid cancer (3.57 (1.30-7.76)) when undergoing surgery, whereas liver cancer was common when treated with radiotherapy (3.21 (1.54-5.90)) and kidney bladder was most prevalent for those on hormonal treatment (3.15 (1.93-4.87)). Stratification by time since PCa diagnosis showed a lower risk of cancer for men with PCa compared to the general population for the first four years, but then a steep increase in risk was observed.  Conclusion:   In the Canton of Zurich, there was an increased risk of second primary cancers among men with PCa compared to the general population.

Nevertheless, screening among high-risk groups is appealing. Prior data suggests that men carrying mutations in the BRCA1& 2 genes may be at increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Additionally, they appear to develop prostate cancer at a younger age and with a more aggressive course. However, prior studies did not systematically perform prostate biopsies and thus cannot determine the true prevalence of prostate cancer in this population.  Methods:   This will be a prospective diagnostic trial of screening for prostate cancer among men with genetic predisposition. The target population is males (40-70 year old) carrying a BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 germ line mutation. They will be identified via our Genetic counseling unit. All men after signing an informed consent will undergo the following tests: PSA, free to total PSA, MRI of prostate and prostate biopsy. The primary endpoint will be to estimate the prevalence, stage and grade of prostate cancer in this population. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the impact of these germ line mutations on benign prostatic hyperplasia. Furthermore, this study aims to create a bio-bank of tissue, urine and serum of this unique cohort for future investigations. Finally, this study will identify an inception cohort for future interventional studies of primary and secondary prevention.  Discussion:   The proposed research is highly translational and focuses not only on the clinical results, but on the future specimens that will be used to advance our understanding of prostate cancer patho-physiology. Most importantly, these high-risk germ-line mutation carriers are ideal candidates for primary and secondary prevention initiatives.

Phase I trials of AA without prednisone showed significant elevation of serum mineralocorticoid concentrations. The aim of this study was to elucidate the biological significance of elevated mineralocorticoid levels on androgen receptor (AR) activity in prostate cancer (PC) cells.  Methods:   Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay was used to assess the effect of mineralocorticoids on androgen-induced conformational change of the AR. LAPC4, LNCaP and LN-AR cells that were cultured and treated with androgens were exposed to mineralocorticoids at varying concentrations, including levels measured in the serum of AA-treated patients in a phase I trial. AR-dependent transcriptional activity and cell growth were measured in these cell lines to determine the biological impact of mineralocorticoids on PC cells.  Results:   Corticosterone (CS) and deoxycorticosterone (DOC) inhibited androgen-induced conformational change of the AR in the FRET assay. CS inhibited AR-dependent transcriptional activity and cell growth at concentrations comparable to those measured in the serum of AA-treated patients. DOC inhibited AR transcriptional activity and cell growth at 10-fold greater concentrations than measured in the serum of AA-treated patients.  Conclusions:   Mineralocorticoids directly inhibit androgen-induced conformational change of the AR. CS inhibits AR transcriptional activity and PC cell growth at concentrations found in the serum of patients treated with AA.

The ex-vivo specimen underwent MRI prior to formalin fixation or any other histopathological processing. Prostate volume in vivo and ex vivo was assessed using planimetry. Prostate shape was assessed by calculating ratios between the diameters of the prostate in all three dimensions.  Results:   Mean prostate volume was significantly smaller ex vivo than in vivo (39.7 ± 18.6 versus 50.8 ± 26.8 cm(3); p = 0.008), with an average change in volume of -19.5%.

One of a nurse's most important roles is to help patients and their families make sense of this, providing support and information through their cancer journey. However, many barriers exist, including the nurse's own knowledge limitations, time constraints and the patient's engagement with the nurse. This paper uses critical reflection to evaluate an incident from clinical practice involving a patient with prostate cancer suffering from a distressing side effect of treatment: urinary incontinence following a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The paper examines nurse-patient communication, and evaluates how nurses can use communication strategies to minimise patient distress. Practical approaches to managing urinary incontinence are also discussed. This paper demonstrates that critical reflection is a valuable learning process that can alter clinical nursing practice to provide the best care for people with cancer.""","""['Naomi Farrington', 'Kay Townsend']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Nurs""","""[""Effect of communication skills training on nurses' detection of patients' distress and related factors after cancer diagnosis: a randomized study."", ""Nurse's role in controlling cancer pain."", 'The power of nursing: guiding patients through a journey of uncertainty.', 'Nursing implications of personalized and precision medicine.', 'An exploration of the Role of the Prostate Cancer Specialist Nurse from Two International Perspectives.', 'Development of Critical Reflection Competency Scale for Clinical Nurses.', 'Effects of a work-based critical reflection program for novice nurses.']"""

Another novel mutation identified at exon-intron junction of exon-8 in C4-2B cell line resulted in alteration of the GRM1 splicing donor site. In addition, we found missense SNP at T2977C (993 Ser > Pro) position and multiple non-coding mutations and SNPs in 3'-UTR of GRM1 gene in PCa cell lines and tissues.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of the coil set-up on image quality.  Methods:   A custom-designed pelvic-shaped phantom was scanned by systematically increasing the anterior body-to-coil (BTC) distance from 30 to 90 mm. The image quality near the organs of interest was determined in order to characterize the relationship between image quality and BTC distance at the critical organ structures. The half intensity reduction (HIR) was calculated to determine the sensitivity of each organ structure to the BTC distance change.  Results:   As the BTC distance increased, the uniformity reduced at 3% per millimetre. The HIR value indicated that the bladder signal is most sensitive to the change in BTC distance. By maintaining a constant BTC distance set-up, the intensity uniformity was improved by 28% along the B0 directions.  Conclusion:   Positioning the MRI coil on mounts can reduce body deformation but adversely degrades the image quality. The magnitude of this effect has been quantified for prostate MR simulation scanning. The coil needs to be positioned not only with a minimal but also uniform BTC distance in order to maximize image quality.  Advances in knowledge:   A method to characterize the effect on image quality due to the use of coil mounts was demonstrated. Coil mounts whose height can be adjusted individually to keep BTC distance constant are necessary to maintain a uniform image across the entire field of view.""","""['J Sun', 'P Pichler', 'J Dowling', 'F Menk', 'P Stanwell', 'J Arm', 'P B Greer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Investigation on the performance of dedicated radiotherapy positioning devices for MR scanning for prostate planning.', 'MRI simulation: end-to-end testing for prostate radiation therapy using geometric pelvic MRI phantoms.', 'Assessing the image quality of pelvic MR images acquired with a flat couch for radiotherapy treatment planning.', 'Role of Prostate MR Imaging in Radiation Oncology.', 'Characterization of the impact to PET quantification and image quality of an anterior array surface coil for PET/MR imaging.', 'Geometric impact and dose estimation of on-patient placement of a lightweight receiver coil in a clinical magnetic resonance imaging-only radiotherapy workflow for prostate cancer.', 'Multi-parametric MRI for radiotherapy simulation.', 'Task group 284 report: magnetic resonance imaging simulation in radiotherapy: considerations for clinical implementation, optimization, and quality assurance.', 'Investigation on the performance of dedicated radiotherapy positioning devices for MR scanning for prostate planning.']"""

In the current practice of DCE-MRI, diagnosis is based on quantitative parameters extracted from the series of T1-weighted images acquired after the injection of a contrast agent. To calculate these parameters, a pharmacokinetic model is fitted to the T1-weighted intensities. Most models make simplistic assumptions about the perfusion process. Moreover, these models require accurate estimation of the arterial input function, which is challenging. In this work we propose a data-driven approach to characterization of the prostate tissue that uses the time series of DCE T1-weighted images without pharmacokinetic modeling. This approach uses a number of model-free empirical parameters and also the principal component analysis (PCA) of the normalized T1-weighted intensities, as features for cancer detection from DCE MRI. The optimal set of principal components is extracted with sparse regularized regression through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). A support vector machine classifier was used with leave-one-patient-out cross validation to determine the ability of this set of features in cancer detection. Our data is obtained from patients prior to radical prostatectomy and the results are validated based on histological evaluation of the extracted specimens. Our results, obtained on 449 tissue regions from 16 patients, show that the proposed data-driven features outperform the traditional pharmacokinetic parameters with an area under ROC of 0.86 for LASSO-isolated PCA parameters, compared to 0.78 for pharmacokinetic parameters. This shows that our novel approach to the analysis of DCE data has the potential to improve the multiparametric MRI protocol for prostate cancer detection.""","""['Nandinee Fariah Haq', 'Piotr Kozlowski', 'Edward C Jones', 'Silvia D Chang', 'S Larry Goldenberg', 'Mehdi Moradi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['Novel PCA-VIP scheme for ranking MRI protocols and identifying computer-extracted MRI measurements associated with central gland and peripheral zone prostate tumors.', 'Quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis of prostate cancer DCE-MRI at 3T: comparison of two arterial input functions on cancer detection with digitized whole mount histopathological validation.', 'Combined use of T2-weighted MRI and T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in the automated analysis of breast lesions.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and pharmacokinetic models in prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MR Imaging for Detection and Locoregional Staging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of Golden-Angle-Sampled Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI Reconstruction Using Objective Image Quality Measures: A Simulated Phantom Study.', 'Identification of Potential MR-Derived Biomarkers for Tumor Tissue Response to 177Lu-Octreotate Therapy in an Animal Model of Small Intestine Neuroendocrine Tumor.', 'Head and Neck Cancer Tumor Segmentation Using Support Vector Machine in Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI.', 'Quantitative effects of acquisition duration and temporal resolution on the measurement accuracy of prostate dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data: a phantom study.']"""

Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has gained recent popularity to characterize PCa. Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging has the potential to aid PCa diagnosis and management by using tissue stiffness to evaluate prostate zonal anatomy and lesions. MR and B-mode/ARFI in vivo imaging datasets were compared with one another and with gross pathology measurements made immediately after radical prostatectomy. Images were manually segmented in 3D Slicer to delineate the central gland (CG) and prostate capsule, and 3D models were rendered to evaluate zonal anatomy dimensions and volumes. Both imaging modalities showed good correlation between estimated organ volume and gross pathologic weights. Ultrasound and MR total prostate volumes were well correlated (R(2) = 0.77), but B-mode images yielded prostate volumes that were larger (16.82% ± 22.45%) than MR images, due to overestimation of the lateral dimension (18.4% ± 13.9%), with less significant differences in the other dimensions (7.4% ± 17.6%, anterior-to-posterior, and -10.8% ± 13.9%, apex-to-base). ARFI and MR CG volumes were also well correlated (R(2) = 0.85). CG volume differences were attributed to ARFI underestimation of the apex-to-base axis (-28.8% ± 9.4%) and ARFI overestimation of the lateral dimension (21.5% ± 14.3%). B-mode/ARFI imaging yielded prostate volumes and dimensions that were well correlated with MR T2-weighted image (T2WI) estimates, with biases in the lateral dimension due to poor contrast caused by extraprostatic fat.

Methods:   Using a population of 699 men, multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the associations between PSA and concomitant medications, and mixed-effects models were used to investigate these associations with PSAV.  Results:   After adjusting for selenium use, age, race, body mass index, and pack-years of smoking, aspirin, other NSAIDs, or statins did not demonstrate statistically significant associations with PSA (P = 0.79, 0.68, and 0.79, respectively) or PSAV (P = 0.23, 0.43, and 0.84, respectively).

Patients and methods:   Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer on extended (≥10 cores) biopsy with an initial prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) level of <15 ng/mL, clinical stage (cT) ≤ 2a, and highest biopsy Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 or 3 + 4 = 7 with <3 positive cores who underwent RP were included in the study. The CCL/core and presence of insignificant cancer (organ-confined, volume <0.5 mL, Gleason score at RP ≤6) were recorded. pT2 prostate cancer with RP Gleason score ≤3 + 4 = 7 and volume <0.5 mL were categorised as low-tumour-volume organ-confined disease (LV-OCD).  Results:   In all, 221 patients met the inclusion criteria: the mean age was 59 years and the median iPSA level was 4.5 ng/mL. The clinical stage was cT1 in 86% of patients; biopsy Gleason score was 3 + 3 = 6 in 67% (group 1) and 3 + 4 = 7 in 33% of patients (group 2). The maximum percentage of biopsy core involvement was <50 in 85%; the median CCL/core was 0.15 mm. Insignificant cancer was found in 27% and LV-OCD in 44% of patients. Group 2 was associated with higher number of positive cores, maximum percentage core involvement, total prostate cancer length, and CCL/core. Group 1 was more likely to have insignificant cancer (39%) or LV-OCD (54%) than group 2 (3% and 23%, respectively). Group 2 had significantly higher RP Gleason score and pathological stage. Univariate analysis of group 1 showed that the iPSA level, maximum percentage core involvement, prostate cancer length, and CCL/core were all significantly associated with insignificant cancer and LV-OCD. For group 2, the number of positive cores (1 vs 2) was also significantly associated with LV-OCD. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, maximum percentage core involvement of <50, and number of positive cores (1 vs 2) were independent predictors of insignificant cancer in group 1; biopsy Gleason score, maximum percentage core involvement of <50 and prostate cancer length of <3 mm or CCL/core of <0.2 mm were all independent predictors of LV-OCD in the whole population. The maximum percentage of core involvement of <50 and prostate cancer length of <3 mm or CCL/core of <0.2 mm were also independent predictors of LV-OCD in group 1 patients.  Conclusion:   In patients eligible for AS, a CCL/core of <0.20 mm was significantly associated with insignificant cancer and LV-OCD. However, when parameters of cancer burden were considered, CCL/core did not independently add any additional value for predicting insignificant cancer in patients with biopsy Gleason score 6. The CCL/core was an independent predictor of LV-OCD in the whole population and in group 1 patients, although the model including prostate cancer length showed slightly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.""","""['Derrick J Chen', 'Sara M Falzarano', 'Jesse K McKenney', 'Chris G Przybycin', 'Jordan P Reynolds', 'Andres Roma', 'J Stephen Jones', 'Andrew Stephenson', 'Eric Klein', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Extended biopsy based criteria incorporating cumulative cancer length for predicting clinically insignificant prostate cancer.', 'The percent of cores positive for cancer in prostate needle biopsy specimens is strongly predictive of tumor stage and volume at radical prostatectomy.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Prospective evaluation of men with stage T1C adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Multiple measures of carcinoma extent versus perineural invasion in prostate needle biopsy tissue in prediction of pathologic stage in a screening population.', 'Development and internal validation of a novel nomogram for predicting lymph node invasion for prostate cancer patients undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Adverse pathology after radical prostatectomy: the prognostic role of cumulative cancer length >6-mm threshold in prostate cancer-positive biopsies.', 'The biopsy Gleason score 3+4 in a single core does not necessarily reflect an unfavourable pathological disease after radical prostatectomy in comparison with biopsy Gleason score 3+3: looking for larger selection criteria for active surveillance candidates.']"""

Docetaxel significantly prolongs overall survival in men with CRPC. Thymoquinone (TQ), one of the flavonoid compounds isolated from Nigealla sativa, has been shown to possess cytotoxic activity against a variety of cancer cell lines.  Materials and methods:   The aim of the study was to investigate the possible synergistic cytotoxic/apoptotic effects of a novel combination, docetaxel and TQ in DU-145 hormone- and drug-refractory prostate cancer cells and their effects on PI3K and ERK signaling pathways.  Results:   We observed that the combination of docetaxel and TQ resulted in a significant synergistic cytotoxicy and apoptosis as compared to any single agent alone, in a dose-dependent manner. It was found that viability of the combination treated cells was not significantly changed in the presence of LY294002 as compared to inhibitor treated cells. However, in the presence of FR180204, viability of combination treated cells was significantly decreased as compared to inhibitor treated cells. In conclusion, cytotoxic effect of the docetaxel and TQ combination is correlated with the block of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in DU-145 cells.  Conclusion:   Therefore, this combination strategy may be an alternative approach for the challenging era of daily oncologic practice. Also, the combination of docetaxel and TQ might allow a reduction in docetaxel doses and diminish adverse effects of docetaxel while maintaining the therapeutic effect in patients with CRPC.""","""['A Dirican', 'H Atmaca', 'E Bozkurt', 'C Erten', 'B Karaca', 'R Uslu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Enhancement of docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) through downregulation of survivin (BIRC5), MCL-1 and LTbeta-R in hormone- and drug resistant prostate cancer cell line, DU-145.', 'Multi-drug loaded micelles delivering chemotherapy and targeted therapies directed against HSP90 and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the Vav3 oncogene enhances docetaxel-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of androgen receptor phosphorylation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells under chronic hypoxia.', 'Thymoquinone-induced reactive oxygen species causes apoptosis of chondrocytes via PI3K/Akt and p38kinase pathway.', 'Enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by thymoquinone in combination with zoledronic acid in hormone- and drug-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Thymoquinone enhanced the antitumor activity of cisplatin in human bladder cancer 5637 cells in vitro.', 'Anticancer and Anti-Metastatic Role of Thymoquinone: Regulation of Oncogenic Signaling Cascades by Thymoquinone.', 'Potential anticancer properties and mechanisms of thymoquinone in osteosarcoma and bone metastasis.', 'Targeting microRNAs with thymoquinone: a new approach for cancer therapy.', 'Therapeutic potential of thymoquinone in combination therapy against cancer and cancer stem cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   For plan comparisons, 15 patients who had been treated with IMRT or VMAT using the MLCi2 were selected. For each patient, a retrospective treatment plan using the MLCi2 for the technique not applied was created, as were treatment plans for both techniques using the Agility(TM) MLC. Dose-volume histograms (DHVs) for planning target volumes (PTVs) and organs at risk (OARs) were compared. Further parameters relating to dose conformity, dose homogeneity and mean dose (Dmean) to the PTV, compliance with the intended OAR dose criteria and overall dose to normal tissue were analyzed. Verification measurements were performed and optimization and treatment times were compared.  Results:   Compared to the MLCi2 plans, the Agility(TM) IMRT and VMAT plans show better or equivalent results in terms of PTV dose conformity and homogeneity. Compliance with the intended OAR dose criteria does not differ according to technique or MLC type. Slight differences are shown for dose distributions in OARs and normal tissue. Verification measurements show that all plans fulfill the acceptance criteria of a minimum of 95 % matched dose points for the 3 %/3 mm γ criterion. Optimization times for the VMAT plans increase compared to the IMRT plans, whereas treatment times decrease.  Conclusion:   With the MLCi2, treatment of complex target volumes with VMAT was only possible with compromises in terms of target coverage. Using the Agility(TM) MLC, even complex target volumes can be treated with VMAT without compromising target coverage or resulting in higher exposure of OARs or normal tissue.""","""['Nadine Blümer', 'Christian Scherf', 'Janett Köhn', 'Eugen Kara', 'Britta Loutfi-Krauß', 'Detlef Imhoff', 'Claus Rödel', 'Ulla Ramm', 'Jörg Licher']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Dosimetric evaluation study of IMRT and VMAT techniques for prostate cancer based on different multileaf collimator designs.', 'Impact of MLC properties and IMRT technique in meningioma and head-and-neck treatments.', 'Dosimetric effects of multileaf collimator leaf width on intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.', 'Beam modeling and VMAT performance with the Agility 160-leaf multileaf collimator.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Dosimetric evaluation study of IMRT and VMAT techniques for prostate cancer based on different multileaf collimator designs.', 'Challenges in modeling the Agility multileaf collimator in treatment planning systems and current needs for improvement.', 'Effect of dental metal artifact conversion volume on dose distribution in head-and-neck volumetric-modulated arc therapy.', 'Monte Carlo Modeling of the Agility MLC for IMRT and VMAT Calculations.', 'Dynamic positioning accuracy of a novel multileaf collimator for volumetric modulated arc therapy.']"""

TF12 is a trivalent bispecific antibody that consists of two anti-TROP-2 Fab fragments and one anti-HSG (histamine-succinyl-glycine) Fab fragment. The TROP-2 antigen is expressed in many epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer (PC), and therefore, this bispecific antibody can be used for pretargeting of PC. In this study, the potential for pretargeted radioimmunoPET with TF12 and the (68)Ga-labeled di-HSG peptide IMP288 in mice with human PC xenografts was investigated using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) as a reference.  Procedures:   The potential of pretargeted immunoPET with TF12 and the (68)Ga-labeled di-HSG hapten-peptide, IMP288, was studied in mice with subcutaneous PC3 tumors using [(18)F]FDG as a reference. Furthermore, the use of this pretargeting system for imaging PC lesions was evaluated in mice with intraperitoneally growing tumors with [(18)F]FDG as a reference.  Results:   [(68)Ga]lMP288 showed rapid accumulation in the TF12 pretargeted subcutaneous tumor (7.2 ± 1.1 % ID/g) with low uptake in the kidneys (1.8 ± 0.5 % ID/g) and high tumor-to-blood ratios (17.4 ± 11.2) at 1 h p.i.

Additionally, despite evidence of increased vulnerability of marginalized populations to negative outcomes, few studies have examined the unique experience of gay men coping with the cancer process. The goals of this study were to determine whether disease-related self-efficacy and satisfaction with medical care mediated the relationship between greater physical symptoms and worse fear of recurrence among gay or bisexual prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   Participants were composed of 92 self-identified gay or bisexual men, who had received a diagnosis of prostate cancer in the past 4 years. Participants provided demographic information and completed self-report questionnaires that assessed symptom function, self-efficacy for prostate cancer symptoms, satisfaction with healthcare, and fear of recurrence. Bootstrapping procedures were used to assess for significant mediation.  Results:   Results suggested significant mediation of the relationship between each of bowel, hormonal, and sexual function with fear of recurrence by self-efficacy and satisfaction with healthcare. Mediation was not significantly supported for the association between urinary function and fear of recurrence.  Conclusions:   Findings support the explanatory effects of self-efficacy for symptom management and satisfaction with healthcare on the relationship between symptom function and fear of recurrence.

Sexual bother is an important component of adjustment. Factors associated with increased bother are not well understood.  Aims:   This study sought to describe sexual dysfunction and bother in APC patients undergoing ADT, identify socio-demographic and health/disease-related characteristics related to sexual bother, and evaluate associations between sexual bother and psychosocial well-being and quality of life (QOL).  Methods:   Baseline data of a larger psychosocial intervention study was used. Pearson's correlation and independent samples t-test tested bivariate relations. Multivariate regression analysis evaluated relations between sexual bother and psychosocial and QOL outcomes.  Main outcome measures:   The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite sexual function and bother subscales, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy--General, and Dyadic Adjustment Scale were the main outcome measures.  Results:   Participants (N = 80) were 70 years old (standard deviation [SD] = 9.6) and reported 18.7 months (SD = 17.3) of ADT. Sexual dysfunction (mean = 10.1; SD = 18.0) was highly prevalent. Greater sexual bother (lower scores) was related to younger age (β = 0.25, P = 0.03) and fewer months of ADT (β = 0.22, P = 0.05). Controlling for age, months of ADT, current and precancer sexual function, sexual bother correlated with more depressive symptoms (β = -0.24, P = 0.06) and lower QOL (β = 0.25, P = 0.05). Contrary to hypotheses, greater sexual bother was related to greater dyadic satisfaction (β = -0.35, P = 0.03) and cohesion (β = -0.42, P = 0.01).  Conclusions:   The majority of APC patients undergoing ADT will experience sexual dysfunction, but there is variability in their degree of sexual bother. Psychosocial aspects of sexual functioning should be considered when evaluating men's adjustment to ADT effects. Assessment of sexual bother may help identify men at risk for more general distress and lowered QOL. Psychosocial interventions targeting sexual bother may complement medical treatments for sexual dysfunction and be clinically relevant, particularly for younger men and those first starting ADT.""","""['Catherine Benedict', 'Lara Traeger', 'Jason R Dahn', 'Michael Antoni', 'Eric S Zhou', 'Natalie Bustillo', 'Frank J Penedo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Effect of androgen deprivation therapy on sexual function and bother in men with prostate cancer: A controlled comparison.', ""The perspective of prostate cancer patients and patients' partners on the psychological burden of androgen deprivation and the dyadic adjustment of prostate cancer couples."", 'Long-term quality of life in disadvantaged men with prostate cancer on androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Sexual healing in patients with prostate cancer on hormone therapy.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: recommendations to improve patient and partner quality of life.', 'Sexual characteristics of patients with prostate cancer seen for radiation treatment.', 'Psychosocial Aspects of Living Long Term with Advanced Cancer and Ongoing Systemic Treatment: A Scoping Review.', 'The impact of hegemonic masculine ideals on self-esteem in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to ADT-naïve patients.', 'Symptom burden profiles in men with advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Sexual function in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

Methods:   One hundred and fifty-six patients with localized prostate cancer were distributed as follows: 57 underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy, 35 underwent three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, 37 underwent I-125 implant, and 27 underwent high-dose-rate brachytherapy. The prescribed doses were 70-74 Gy/35-37 fractions, 70 Gy/35 fractions, 145 Gy, and 45.5 Gy/7 fraction/4 days for intensity-modulated radiation therapy, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, I-125 implant, and high-dose-rate brachytherapy, respectively. Toxicities (≤6 months) were retrospectively evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.  Results:   The frequency of grade 1 or 2 urinary toxicities using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (33/35, 94%) was significantly higher than that with high-dose-rate brachytherapy (18/27, 67%) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (37/57, 65%) (P <0.05). The frequency of grade 1 or 2 urinary toxicities using I-125 implant was 31/37, 84%. The frequency of grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal toxicities using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (17/35, 49%) was significantly higher than that using I-125 implant (4/37, 11%) or high-dose-rate brachytherapy (0/27, 0%) (P <0.05).

A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 1109 patients with prostate cancer diagnosed from 1992 to 2008, identified through the Hospital del Mar Cancer Registry (Barcelona, Spain). Information on smoking habits was retrieved from clinical records and patients were classified into three categories: never smoker, exsmoker and current smoker. Patients were followed up until December 2011. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Median age at diagnosis was 70.6 years and 16.7% of patients had stage IV tumours. During the follow-up period, 466 deaths occurred, 36.1% of them being specifically due to prostate cancer. The median follow-up time of the censored patients was 5.8 years. There was a significant difference in disease-specific survival between never smokers, exsmokers and current smokers (P=0.0001). Current smokers presented a worse 5-year survival rate (82.9%) compared with exsmokers (88.9%) and never smokers (89.6%). In the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age, disease stage, Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen, the hazard ratio for smokers was 1.80 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-3.13) compared with never smokers. In the exsmokers group the risk for prostate cancer-specific mortality was very similar to that of never smokers. However, the statistical difference disappeared when we stratified by stage (I-III and IV). In conclusion, smoking was identified as an independent and negative prognostic factor for prostate cancer-specific and all-cause mortality.

The aim of this study was to evaluate tumor expression of inflammatory-related factors in prostate carcinomas and their possible relationship with biochemical recurrence (elevation of prostate-specific antigen serum levels). An immunohistochemical study was conducted using tissue microarrays and specific antibodies against interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, interferon β (IFNβ), and nuclear factor-κ B (NF-κB). Determinations in cancer specimens from 118 patients with primary prostate cancer (78 without and 40 with recurrence during the follow-up period) were performed. Immunostaining for all the studied proteins was localized both in tumor cells and in stromal cells in the majority of tumors. High-score values for IL-1β or low-score values for IFNβ were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence. The analysis defined a score value of 160 for IL-1β and of 170 for IFNβ as the optimal cutoff points that identified 32.7% and 73.2% of patients, respectively, having high probability of biochemical recurrence. Multivariate analysis according to a Cox model indicated that the cutoff point 170 for IFNβ (P=0.035) was an independent factor associated with biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer.

However, there has been less advancement in protein-based approaches, even though perturbed protein levels and post-translational modifications are more directly linked with phenotype. Most current, gene expression-based platforms require tissue lysis resulting in loss of structural and molecular information, and hence are blind to tumor heterogeneity and morphological features.  Results:   Here we report an automated, integrated multiplex immunofluorescence in situ imaging approach that quantitatively measures protein biomarker levels and activity states in defined intact tissue regions where the biomarkers of interest exert their phenotype. Using this approach, we confirm that four previously reported prognostic markers, PTEN, SMAD4, CCND1 and SPP1, can predict lethal outcome of human prostate cancer. Furthermore, we show that two PI3K pathway-regulated protein activities, pS6 (RPS6-phosphoserines 235/236) and pPRAS40 (AKT1S1-phosphothreonine 246), correlate with prostate cancer lethal outcome as well (individual marker hazard ratios of 2.04 and 2.03, respectively). Finally, we incorporate these 2 markers into a novel 5-marker protein signature, SMAD4, CCND1, SPP1, pS6, and pPRAS40, which is highly predictive for prostate cancer-specific death. The ability to substitute PTEN with phospho-markers demonstrates the potential of quantitative protein activity state measurements on intact tissue.  Conclusions:   In summary, our approach can reproducibly and simultaneously quantify and assess multiple protein levels and functional activities on intact tissue specimens. We believe it is broadly applicable to not only cancer but other diseases, and propose that it should be well suited for prognostication at early stages of pathogenesis where key signaling protein levels and activities are perturbed.""","""['Michail Shipitsin', 'Clayton Small', 'Eldar Giladi', 'Summar Siddiqui', 'Sibgat Choudhury', 'Sadiq Hussain', 'Yi E Huang', 'Hua Chang', 'David L Rimm', 'David M Berman', 'Thomas P Nifong', 'Peter Blume-Jensen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Proteome Sci""","""['Evaluating a 4-marker signature of aggressive prostate cancer using time-dependent AUC.', 'Identification of proteomic biomarkers predicting prostate cancer aggressiveness and lethality despite biopsy-sampling error.', 'Pathway-based identification of biomarkers for targeted therapeutics: personalized oncology with PI3K pathway inhibitors.', 'Predicting high-risk disease using tissue biomarkers.', 'Multiplex Immunofluorescence Tyramide Signal Amplification for Immune Cell Profiling of Paraffin-Embedded Tumor Tissues.', 'Multiplex Immunofluorescence and the Digital Image Analysis Workflow for Evaluation of the Tumor Immune Environment in Translational Research.', 'Optimal Use of Tumor-Based Molecular Assays for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'PGK1 represses autophagy-mediated cell death to promote the proliferation of liver cancer cells by phosphorylating PRAS40.', 'Best Practices for Technical Reproducibility Assessment of Multiplex Immunofluorescence.', 'Anti-Cancer Effects of an Optimised Combination of Ginsenoside Rg3 Epimers on Triple Negative Breast Cancer Models.']"""

In the present study, three new families of cationic polymers were synthesized to assess their effects on prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Cationic polymers effects on PC3 prostate cancer cells and normal prostate epithelial cell (RWPE-1) were assessed using cell viability, DNA fragmentation, apoptosis assays and confocal microscopy.  Results:   The dextran-based polymer (Dex-PA-3X) (40 μg/ml) and the vinyl-based PolyAETA (5 μg/ml) induced a significant reduction in cell viability in PC3 cells (85% and 50%, respectively; p<0.05) in comparison to RWPE-1 cells. Furthermore, Dex-PA-3X induced a 50%, and PolyAETA induced a 35% increase in cell death in PC3 cells compared to RWPE-1 cells measured by DNA fragmentation assay. Lower concentrations of both polymers induced apoptosis while higher concentrations induced both apoptosis and necrosis by immunostaining. Confocal microscopy indicated the localization of Dex-PA in the cytoplasm of PC3 but not RWPE-1 cells, while PolyAETA was seen in both PC3 and RWPE-1 cells, but at lower intensity in RWPE-1 cells.

In particular, the degree to which MTDH may contribute to malignant progression in vivo is lacking. Here, we report that MTDH is amplified frequently in human prostate cancers where its expression levels are tightly correlated with prostate cancer progression and poor disease-free survival. Furthermore, we show that genetic ablation of MTDH in the transgenic adenomcarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer blocks malignant progression without causing defects in the normal development of the prostate. Germline deletion of Mtdh in TRAMP mice prolonged tumor latency, reduced tumor burden, arrested progression of prostate cancer at well-differentiated stages, and inhibited systemic metastasis to distant organs, thereby decreasing cancer-related mortality ∼10-fold. Consistent with these findings, direct silencing of Mtdh in prostate cancer cells decreased proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, supporting an epithelial cell-intrinsic role of MTDH in prostate cancer. Together, our findings establish a pivotal role for MTDH in prostate cancer progression and metastasis and define MTDH as a therapeutic target in this setting.

The purpose of this study is to compare BF rates between permanent prostate brachytherapy (PPB) and radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) as a function of PSA nadir plus varying values of X and examine the associated implications.  Methods and materials:   We retrospectively searched for patients who underwent PPB or RRP at our institution between 1998 and 2004. Only primary patients not receiving androgen-deprivation therapy were included in the study. Three RRP patients were matched to each PPB patient on the basis of prognostic factors. BF rates were estimated for PSA nadirs + different values of X.  Results:   A total of 1,164 patients were used for analysis: 873 in the RRP group and 291 in the PPB group. Patients were equally matched by clinical stage, biopsy Gleason sum, primary Gleason grade, and pretherapy PSA value. Median follow-up was 3.1 years for RRP patients and 3.6 years in the PPB group (P = .01). Using PSA nadir + 0.1 ng/mL for the definition of BF, the 5-year BF rate was 16.3% for PPB patients and 13.5% for RRP patients (P = .007), whereas at nadir + 2 ng/mL or greater, the BF rates were less than 3% and were indistinguishable between PPB and RRP patients.  Conclusions:   In a cohort of well-matched patients who had prostatectomy or brachytherapy, we examined BF as a function of nadir + X, where X was treated as a continuous variable. As X increases from 0.1 to 2.0 ng/mL, the BF curves converge, and above 2.0 ng/mL they are essentially indistinguishable.

However, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction in cancer cells mediated by HVJ-E has not been fully elucidated. This paper aims to investigate the underlying mechanism of apoptosis induction by HVJ-E in prostate cancer cells (PC3).  Methods:   PC3 cells were treated with HVJ-E at various MOI, and then interferon-β (IFN-β) production, and the cell viability and apoptosis were detected by ELISA, MTT-based assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Next, the roles of Jak-Stat, MAPK and Akt pathways played in HVJ-E-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells were analyzed by immunoblot assay. To further evaluate the cytotoxic effect of HVJ-E on PC3 cells, HVJ-E was intratumorally injected into prostate cancers on BALB/c-nude mice, and the tumor volume was monitored for 36 days.  Results:   HVJ-E induced IFN-β production and activated Jak-Stat signaling pathway, which resulted in the activation of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP in PC3 prostate cancer cells post HVJ-E treatment. Furthermore, we observed for the first time that p38 and Jnk MAPKs in PC3 cells contributed to HVJ-E-induced apoptosis. In addition, intratumoral HVJ-E treatment displayed a direct inhibitory effect in an in vivo BALB/c nude mouse prostate cancer model.

The aim of this qualitative study was to explore factors influencing psychosexual adjustment, self-perception, and unmet information and support needs of prostate cancer patients and their partners.  Methods:   Twenty-one men, recruited via a prostate cancer support group newsletter, participated in face-to-face semi-structured interviews, which were subjected to thematic analysis.  Results:   The qualitative analysis revealed three inter-connected main themes which contributed to men's psychosexual adjustment: i) Psychosexual impact, ii) Communication and support, and iii) Integration process. Men reported distressing sexual and urinary difficulties, tainted self-perception and altered intimate relationships. Receiving adequate information and support, and having good communication with their doctors and partners facilitated better adjustment to prostate cancer treatment. Coming to terms with the significant impact of treatment had involved making lifestyle changes, coping with emotional struggles and striving to accept and integrate their post-treatment ""new normal"" self and sexual life.  Conclusions:   The importance of adequate communication with health professionals and partners, especially regarding treatment effects on sexual function and rehabilitation options, was highlighted as a key factor facilitating the adjustment process.

The level of lycopene was not detected in PC-3 cell lines cultured in medium lacking lycopene. Staining cells with acridine orange and ethidium bromide, the PC-3 control cells showed largely non-fragmented intact nucleoid. Stronger apoptosis signal was induced with higher concentrations (50 μM) of algal lycopene. Increased DNA damage was observed in AL- and TL-treated cells which appear as comet during single-cell gel electrophoresis. Flow cytometry results revealed that AL caused PC-3 cells to accumulate in the G0/G1 phase and to undergo apoptosis. The effect was higher in AL groups than TL-treated groups.

Thus, we evaluated the clinical significances of different parameters on the biochemical outcome of RT in salvage setting.  Methods:   We reviewed the records of 212 patients who underwent salvage RT between November 2003 and December 2012 for BCR following primary RP. BCR-free survivals after salvage RT were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the impacts of clinicopathologic parameters on BCR following salvage RT.  Results:   The overall median follow-up duration was 63.5 months. The BCR-free survival rate after salvage RT was 58.2% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis showed that a pre-RT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of ≤0.5 ng/mL, a pre-RT PSA doubling time (PSADT) of >4.5 months, concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with salvage RT, and a positive surgical margin were independent predictors of favorable biochemical outcomes after salvage RT (hazard ratios [HR] = 3.012, 1.132, 2.000, and 1.805, respectively, p = less than 0.001, 0.013, 0.005, and 0.036, respectively). In the early (pre-RT PSA ≤0.5 ng/mL) salvage RT setting, concomitant ADT administration was also shown to be significantly associated with higher risk of BCR-free survival following salvage RT (HR = 2.611, p = 0.038).

Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has been proposed to be tissue selective and so might have favourable characteristics compared to the currently used prostate ablative technologies. The aim of this trial is to determine the adverse events, genito-urinary side effects and early histological outcomes of focal IRE in men with localised prostate cancer.  Methods:   This is a single centre prospective development (stage 2a) study following the IDEAL recommendations for evaluating new surgical procedures. Twenty men who have MRI-visible disease localised in the anterior part of the prostate will be recruited. The sample size permits a precision estimate around key functional outcomes. Inclusion criteria include PSA ≤ 15 ng/ml, Gleason score ≤ 4 + 3, stage T2N0M0 and absence of clinically significant disease outside the treatment area. Treatment delivery will be changed in an adaptive iterative manner so as to allow optimisation of the IRE protocol. After focal IRE, men will be followed during 12 months using validated patient reported outcome measures (IPSS, IIEF-15, UCLA-EPIC, EQ-5D, FACT-P, MAX-PC). Early disease control will be evaluated by mpMRI and targeted transperineal biopsy of the treated area at 6 months.  Discussion:   The NEAT trial will assess the early functional and disease control outcome of focal IRE using an adaptive design. Our protocol can provide guidance for designing an adaptive trial to assess new surgical technologies in the challenging landscape of health technology assessment in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Massimo Valerio', 'Louise Dickinson', 'Afia Ali', 'Navin Ramachandran', 'Ian Donaldson', 'Alex Freeman', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Mark Emberton']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Contemp Clin Trials""","""['A prospective Phase 2a pilot study investigating focal percutaneous irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation by NanoKnife in patients with localised renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with delayed interval tumour resection (IRENE trial).', 'Oncological and Quality-of-life Outcomes Following Focal Irreversible Electroporation as Primary Treatment for Localised Prostate Cancer: A Biopsy-monitored Prospective Cohort.', 'Nanoknife Electroporation Ablation Trial: A Prospective Development Study Investigating Focal Irreversible Electroporation for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Irreversible electroporation (IRE): a narrative review of the development of IRE from the laboratory to a prostate cancer treatment.', 'Irreversible electroporation.

Recently, retrospective studies reported that general anaesthesia was associated with worse long-term cancer-free survival when compared with regional anaesthesia. This has important clinical implications; however, the mechanisms underlying those observations remain unclear. We aim to investigate the effect of anaesthetics isoflurane and propofol on prostate cancer malignancy.  Methods:   Prostate cancer (PC3) cell line was exposed to commonly used anaesthetic isoflurane and propofol. Malignant potential was assessed through evaluation of expression level of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and its downstream effectors, cell proliferation and migration as well as development of chemoresistance.  Results:   We demonstrated that isoflurane, at a clinically relevant concentration induced upregulation of HIF-1α and its downstream effectors in PC3 cell line. Consequently, cancer cell characteristics associated with malignancy were enhanced, with an increase of proliferation and migration, as well as development of chemoresistance. Inhibition of HIF-1α neosynthesis through upper pathway blocking by a PI-3K-Akt inhibitor or HIF-1α siRNA abolished isoflurane-induced effects. In contrast, the intravenous anaesthetic propofol inhibited HIF-1α activation induced by hypoxia or CoCl2. Propofol also prevented isoflurane-induced HIF-1α activation, and partially reduced cancer cell malignant activities.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that modulation of HIF-1α activity by anaesthetics may affect cancer recurrence following surgery. If our data were to be extrapolated to the clinical setting, isoflurane but not propofol should be avoided for use in cancer surgery. Further work involving in vivo models and clinical trials is urgently needed to determine the optimal anaesthetic regimen for cancer patients.""","""['H Huang', 'L L Benzonana', 'H Zhao', 'H R Watts', 'N J S Perry', 'C Bevan', 'R Brown', 'D Ma']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Propofol Reversed Hypoxia-Induced Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells by Preventing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition by Inhibiting Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α.', 'Isoflurane inhibits occludin expression via up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α.', 'Everolimus (RAD001) sensitizes prostate cancer cells to docetaxel by down-regulation of HIF-1α and sphingosine kinase 1.', 'Interactions between non-coding RNAs and HIF-1α in the context of cancer.', 'Does the Choice of Anaesthesia Affect Cancer?

Methods:   Between February 2004 and January 2013 prostate biopsies were performed in 59 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients whose PSA level were elevated (≥3 ng/ml) after a 6 week course of intravesical BCG (Oncotice, 12.5 mg in 50 ml normal saline).

The Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to evaluate the association between categorical and continuous variables, respectively.  Results:   A total of 14 patients (23.7%) were diagnosed with PCa.

Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase-α (PIP5Kα) is a lipid kinase, similar to PI3K. However, the role of PIP5K1α in oncogenic processes and the development of inhibitors that selectively target PIP5K1α have not been reported. In the present study we report that overexpression of PIP5K1α is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer and correlates with an elevated level of the androgen receptor. Overexpression of PIP5K1α in PNT1A nonmalignant cells results in an increased AKT activity and an increased survival, as well as invasive malignant phenotype, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of PIP5K1α in aggressive PC-3 cells leads to a reduced AKT activity and an inhibition in tumor growth in xenograft mice. We further report a previously unidentified role for PIP5K1α as a druggable target for our newly developed compound ISA-2011B using a high-throughput KINOMEscan platform. ISA-2011B was discovered during our synthetic studies of C-1 indol-3-yl substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines via a Pictet-Spengler approach. ISA-2011B significantly inhibits growth of tumor cells in xenograft mice, and we show that this is mediated by targeting PIP5K1α-associated PI3K/AKT and the downstream survival, proliferation, and invasion pathways. Further, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PIP5K1α exerts similar effects on PC3 cells as ISA-2011B treatment, significantly inhibiting AKT activity, increasing apoptosis and reducing invasion. Thus, PIP5K1α has high potential as a drug target, and compound ISA-2011B is interesting for further development of targeted cancer therapy.""","""['Julius Semenas', 'Andreas Hedblom', 'Regina R Miftakhova', 'Martuza Sarwar', 'Rikard Larsson', 'Liliya Shcherbina', 'Martin E Johansson', 'Pirkko Härkönen', 'Olov Sterner', 'Jenny L Persson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['PIP5K1α inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer: Lipid kinase PIP5K1α as a new target in prostate cancer.', 'The role of PIP5K1α/pAKT and targeted inhibition of growth of subtypes of breast cancer using PIP5K1α inhibitor.', 'Targeted inhibition of ERα signaling and PIP5K1α/Akt pathways in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cancer: Lipid kinase PIP5K1α as a new target in prostate cancer.', 'PIP5K1α inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.', 'Targeted suppression of AR-V7 using PIP5K1α inhibitor overcomes enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells.', 'A Plethora of Functions Condensed into Tiny Phospholipids: The Story of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2.', 'Lipid kinase PIP5Kα\xa0contributes to Hippo pathway activation via interaction with Merlin and by mediating plasma membrane targeting of LATS1.', 'PI(4,5)P2-dependent and -independent roles of PI4P in the control of hormone secretion by pituitary cells.', 'PIP kinases: A versatile family that demands further therapeutic attention.', 'Rational Design and Synthesis of D-galactosyl Lysophospholipids as Selective Substrates and non-ATP-competitive Inhibitors of Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinases.']"""

Of the IAP family members, cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP and survivin are known to be up-regulated in prostate cancer. BIRC6, a much less studied IAP member, was recently shown to be elevated in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In the present study, we showed a correlation between elevated BIRC6 expression in clinical prostate cancer specimens and poor patient prognostic factors, as well as co-upregulation of certain IAP members. In view of this, we designed antisense oligonucleotides that simultaneously target BIRC6 and another co-upregulated IAP member (dASOs). Two dASOs, targeting BIRC6+cIAP1 and BIRC6+survivin, showed substantial inhibition of CRPC cells proliferation, exceeding that obtained with single BIRC6 targeting. The growth inhibition was associated with increased apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and suppression of NFkB activation. Moreover, treatment with both dASOs led to significantly lower viable tumor volume in vivo, without major host toxicity.

Herein, we report the in vitro growth inhibition and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by SRJ23.  Methods:   3-(4,5-Dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used in assessing in vitro growth inhibition of compounds against prostate cancer (PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP) and mouse macrophage (RAW 264.7) cell lines. Flow cytometry was utilised to analyse cell cycle distribution, whereas fluorescence microscopy was performed to determine morphological cell death. DNA fragmentation and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometry were done to confirm apoptosis induced by SRJ23. Quantitation of cell cycle and apoptotic regulatory proteins were determined by immunoblotting.  Results:   AGP and SRJ23 selectively inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells compared with RAW 264.7 cells at low micromolar concentrations; however, SRJ23 was more potent. Mechanistically, SRJ23-treated PC-3 cells displayed down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 without affecting levels of CDK4 and cyclin D1. However, SRJ23 induced down-regulation of CDK4 and cyclin D1 but without affecting CDK1 in DU145 and LNCaP cell lines. DNA histogram analysis revealed that the SRJ23 induced G2/M in PC-3 cells but G1 arrest in DU-145 and LNCaP cells. Morphologically, both compounds induced predominantly apoptosis, which was further confirmed by DNA fragmentation and annexin V-FITC staining. The DNA fragmentation was inhibited in the presence of caspase 8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK). Apoptosis was associated with an increase in caspase 8 expression and activation. This thought to have induced cleavage of Bid into t-Bid. Additionally, increased expression and activation of caspase 9 and Bax proteins were apparent, with a concomitant down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein. Similar apoptosis cascade of events was observed in SRJ23-treated DU145 and LNCaP cell lines.  Conclusion:   SRJ23 inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells by inducing G2/M and G1 arrest via down-regulation of CDK1, and CDK4 and cyclin, respectively, and initiated caspase-8-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis.

The secondary objective was to compare low-dose and high-dose (177)Lu-EDTMP in bone pain palliation.  Methods:   Included in the study were 44 patients with documented breast carcinoma (12 patients; age 47 ± 13 years) or castration-resistant prostate carcinoma (32 patients; age 66 ± 9 years) and skeletal metastases. Patients were randomized into two equal groups treated with (177)Lu-EDTMP intravenously at a dose of 1,295 MBq (group A) or 2,590 MBq (group B). Pain palliation was evaluated using a visual analogue score (VAS), analgesic score (AS) and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) up to 16 weeks. Toxicity was assessed in terms of haematological and renal parameters.  Results:   The overall response rate (in all 44 patients) was 86 %. Complete, partial and minimal responses were seen in 6 patients (13 %), 21 patients (48 %) and 11 patients (25 %), respectively. A favourable response was seen in 27 patients (84 %) with prostate cancer and in 11 patients (92 %) with breast cancer. There was a progressive decrease in the VAS from baseline up to 4 weeks (p < 0.05). Also, AS decreased significantly from 1.8 ± 0.7 to 1.2 ± 0.9 (p < 0.0001). There was an improvement in quality of life of the patients as reflected by an increase in mean KPS from 56 ± 5 to 75 ± 7 (p < 0.0001). The overall response rate in group A was 77 % compared to 95 % in group B (p = 0.188). There was a significant decrease in VAS and AS accompanied by an increase in KPS in both groups. Nonserious haematological toxicity (grade I/II) was observed in 15 patients (34 %) and serious toxicity (grade III/IV) occurred in 10 patients (23 %).

Patients and methods:   In all, 260 men with prostate cancer on AS were invited to complete psychological measures including the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale; the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Scale; the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer; and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale-Prostate. Overall, 86 men with a mean (sd, range) age of 65.7 (5.4, 51-75) years returned data, yielding a response rate of 33%. Outcome measures were standardised psychological measures. Pearson's correlations were used to examine bivariate relationships, while regression analyses were used to describe predictors of dependent variables.  Results:   When compared with the findings of prior research, the men in our cohort had normal levels of general anxiety and illness-specific anxiety and high prostate cancer-related HRQL. Age, trait anxiety and fear of recurrence (FoR) were significant predictors of prostate cancer-related HRQL; trait anxiety and FoR were significant predictors of total HRQL. Results should be interpreted in context of sample characteristics and the correlational design of the study.  Conclusions:   Participants reported low levels of anxiety and high HRQL. Trait anxiety and FoR were significant predictors of both prostate cancer-related and total HRQL.

The impact of the MDM was graded as high if there was a major change in the management plan or if a plan was developed where there was none.  Results:   Over the study period, 120 discussions about 107 patients were recorded.

Ubiquitin associated protein 2-like (UBAP2L) is believed to be involved in the ubiquitin‑proteasome pathway; however, the role of UBAP2L in human prostate cancer is still unknown. In the present study, we found that UBAP2L was expressed in a number of prostate carcinoma cell lines. Using lentiviral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi), we efficiently knocked down endogenous UBAP2L expression at the mRNA and protein levels. After UBAP2L disruption, the proliferation and colony formation ability were significantly reduced in the PC-3 and DU145 cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that UBAP2L knockdown blocked cell cycle progression. Downregulation of UBAP2L inhibited the migration of PC-3 and DU145 cells, as determined by Transwell assay. Moreover, depletion of UBAP2L blocked the AMPKα, Bad and PRAS40 signaling pathways. In conclusion, our results suggest that UBAP2L may play a role in prostate cancer growth and metastasis, and knockdown of UBAP2L by RNAi may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for prostate cancer.""","""['Dong Li', 'Yiran Huang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Ubiquitin Binding Protein 2-Like (UBAP2L): is it so NICE After All?', 'Depletion of UBA protein 2-like protein inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of human colorectal carcinoma cells.', 'Knockdown of Ubiquitin Associated Protein 2-Like (UBAP2L) Inhibits Growth and Metastasis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'MYO6 knockdown inhibits the growth and induces the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by decreasing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and PRAS40.', 'Downregulation of ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like with a short hairpin RNA inhibits human glioma cell growth in\xa0vitro.', 'OGT controls mammalian cell viability by regulating the proteasome/mTOR/ mitochondrial axis.', 'Ubiquitin Binding Protein 2-Like (UBAP2L): is it so NICE After All?', 'Proteomics Approach Highlights Early Changes in Human Fibroblasts-Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cells Crosstalk.', 'UBAP2L promotes gastric cancer metastasis by activating NF-κB through PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Ubiquitin-associated protein 2 like (UBAP2L) enhances growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cells.']"""

Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound found in grapes, berries and peanuts, has a wide range of pharmacological properties, including anti-tumor metastasis properties. The underlying mechanism through which resveratrol inhibits metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa) is not yet fully understood; however, it is thought to be associated with the disruption of EMT. In the present study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to trigger EMT in PC-3 and LNCaP PCa cell lines, and the cell lines were subsequently treated with resveratrol. The results demonstrated that exposure of PC-3 and LNCaP cells to LPS resulted in morphological alterations characteristic of EMT, as well as an increase in the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and a decrease in the expression of E‑cadherin. In addition, LPS exposure resulted in an increase in cell motility, along with an upregulation of the transcription factor glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1). However, treatment with resveratrol inhibited LPS-induced morphological changes, decreased the expression of LPS-induced markers of EMT and inhibited the expression of Gli1, resulting in the inhibition of in vitro cell motility and invasiveness. These results provide a novel perspective for the anti-invasion mechanism of resveratrol, suggesting that the effect is in part due to its ability to inhibit the EMT process through the Hedgehog signaling pathway.""","""['Jianping Li', 'Tie Chong', 'Ziming Wang', 'Haiwen Chen', 'Hecheng Li', 'Jun Cao', 'Peng Zhang', 'Hongliang Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Resveratrol suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer through TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway mediated Snail/E-cadherin expression.', 'Resveratrol inhibits TGF-β1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and suppresses lung cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Resveratrol inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of pancreatic cancer cells via suppression of the PI-3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway.', 'Anti-metastatic potential of resveratrol and its metabolites by the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion of malignant cancer cells.', 'Regulation of Cell Signaling Pathways and miRNAs by Resveratrol in Different Cancers.', 'Resveratrol inhibits TRAF6/PTCH/SMO signal and regulates prostate cancer progression.', 'Plants as a Source of Anticancer Agents: From Bench to Bedside.', 'Small interfering RNA targeting N-cadherin regulates cell proliferation and migration in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide Augmented Malignant Transformation and Promoted the Stemness in Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.', 'Mediterranean Diet Food Components as Possible Adjuvant Therapies to Counteract Breast and Prostate Cancer Progression to Bone Metastasis.']"""

We evaluate the role of transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy (TTMB) to select patients for AS.  Methods:   A total of 131 consecutive, prospectively evaluated men with transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy (TRUS)-diagnosed very low risk (Gleason score ≤6, ≤2 positive biopsies, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] density <0.15, and ≤50% involvement on any core) and low risk (Gleason score ≤6, clinical stage T1c, and PSA ≤10 ng/mL) underwent TTMB as a staging procedure. Biopsies were obtained corresponding to 24 regional biopsy locations. For each patient, the location of each positive biopsy core, the number of positive cores, and the percentage involvement of each core were reported.  Results:   After TTMB, TRUS-detected very-low-risk prostate cancer patients were less likely to be diagnosed with higher Gleason score, were less likely to have bilateral involvement, and had statistically fewer number of positive biopsy cores on TTMB. After TTMB, no cancer, very-low-risk, or low-risk prostate cancer was detected in 60 of 72 (83.3%) and 19 of 59 (32.2%) of patients with very low and low risk, respectively. In multivariate analysis, older age and low risk predicted for higher Gleason score at the time of TTMB.  Conclusions:   Very-low-risk prostate cancer patients have a significantly lower incidence of Gleason score upgrading than those with low-risk disease.

Therefore, it is the main biomarker currently used for early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Here, presteady-state and steady-state kinetics of the PSA-catalyzed hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate Mu-His-Ser-Ser-Lys-Leu-Gln-AMC (spanning from pH 6.5 to pH 9.0, at 37.0°C) are reported. Steady-state kinetics display at every pH value a peculiar feature, represented by an initial ""burst"" phase of the fluorescence signal before steady-state conditions are taking place. This behavior, which has been already observed in other members of the kallikrein family, suggests the occurrence of a proteolytic mechanism wherefore the acylation step is faster than the deacylation process. This feature allows to detect the acyl intermediate, where the newly formed C-terminal carboxylic acid of the cleaved substrate forms an ester bond with the -OH group of the Ser195 catalytic residue, whereas the AMC product has been already released. Therefore, the pH-dependence of the two enzymatic steps (i.e., acylation and deacylation) has been separately characterized, allowing the determination of pKa values.

Our primary end point was 12-month overall urinary function as measured by Bladder Cancer Index. Secondary end points included sexual function, cancer control and complications.  Results:   A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study with 20 patients in each arm. Urinary function at 12 months decreased by 13 and 28 points in the prostate capsule and nerve sparing groups, respectively (p = 0.10). Sexual function followed a similar pattern (p = 0.06). There was no difference in recurrence-free, metastasis-free or overall survival (each p >0.05). The rate of incidentally detected prostate cancer was similar (p = 0.15).  Conclusions:   Our study provides a randomized comparison of prostate capsule sparing and nerve sparing cystectomy techniques. We found no difference in functional or oncologic outcomes between the 2 approaches, although our study was underpowered due to a lack of patient accrual.""","""['Bruce L Jacobs', 'Stephanie Daignault', 'Cheryl T Lee', 'Khaled S Hafez', 'Jeffrey S Montgomery', 'James E Montie', 'Jean E Humrich', 'Brent K Hollenbeck', 'David P Wood Jr', 'Alon Z Weizer']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Long-term functional and oncological outcomes of nerve-sparing and prostate capsule-sparing cystectomy: a single-centre experience.', 'Prostate sparing cystectomy for bladder cancer: 20-year single center experience.', 'Prostate sparing cystectomy for bladder cancer: A two-center study.', 'Neobladder with prostatic capsule and seminal-sparing cystectomy for bladder cancer: a step in the wrong direction.', 'Prostate-sparing cystectomy: a review of the oncologic and functional outcomes.

Materials and methods:   Data from the PLCO cancer screening trial were used to compare the screening and usual care arms in the subset of men with and without a family history of prostate cancer. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and log rank analysis of Kaplan-Meier curves were done to examine the data for differences in prostate cancer specific survival.  Results:   A total of 65,179 white subjects were included in the prostate specific antigen screening trial, of whom 7,314 (11.2%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Only 4,833 white men (7.4%) had a family history of prostate cancer. Those with a positive family history had a significantly higher incidence of prostate cancer (16.9% vs 10.8%) and higher prostate cancer specific mortality (0.56% vs 0.37%, each p <0.01). On multivariate analysis this trended toward significance (HR 1.47, 95% CI 0.98-2.21, p = 0.06). Screening in men with a positive family history also showed a trend toward decreased prostate cancer specific mortality (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22-1.1, p = 0.08) and decreased time to death from prostate cancer (log rank p = 0.05).

Recently, CAB appeared to be active when given after AA. AA is capable of inducing AR splice variants that confer ligand-independent AR transactivation. Because microtubule-targeting agents impair AR nuclear transport and activity, we raised concerns about CAB efficacy after AA failure in mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   One hundred thirty mCRPC patients received AA after docetaxel treatment in compassionate programs. Of them, 24 (18.4%) subsequently received CAB. We retrospectively reviewed their data using conventional methods.  Results:   Twenty-four patients received a median of 4 (range, 1-13) CAB cycles. Nineteen (79.1%) of them received primary prophylaxis with growth factors. Median patient characteristics were: age 65 (range, 57-85) years; Gleason score: 8 (range, 6-10); and PSA: 128.1 (range, 0.01-1700) ng/mL.

Furthermore, we show cases of genetic or epigenetic convergent evolution and highlight the diversity in the evolutionary origins and aberration spectrum between tumor and metastatic subclones.

New clinical guidelines recommend against PSA screening for all men or for men aged >70 years, but, to the authors' knowledge, the expected population effects of these guidelines have not been studied to date.  Methods:   Two models of prostate cancer natural history and diagnosis were previously developed using reconstructed PSA screening patterns and prostate cancer incidence in the United States. Assuming a survival benefit of PSA screening consistent with the screening trials, the authors used the models to predict incidence and mortality rates for the period from 2013 through 2025 under continued PSA screening and under discontinued PSA screening for all men or for men aged >70 years.  Results:   The models predicted that continuation of recent screening rates will overdiagnose 710,000 to 1,120,000 men (range between models) but will avoid 36,000 to 57,000 cancer deaths over the period 2013 through 2025. Discontinued screening for all men eliminated 100% of overdiagnoses but failed to prevent 100% of avoidable cancer deaths. Continued screening for men aged <70 years eliminated 64% to 66% of overdiagnoses but failed to prevent 36% to 39% of avoidable cancer deaths.  Conclusions:   Discontinuing PSA screening for all men may generate many avoidable cancer deaths. Continuing PSA screening for men aged <70 years could prevent greater than one-half of these avoidable cancer deaths while dramatically reducing overdiagnoses compared with continued PSA screening for all ages.""","""['Roman Gulati', 'Alex Tsodikov', 'Ruth Etzioni', 'Rachel A Hunter-Merrill', 'John L Gore', 'Angela B Mariotto', 'Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Comparative effectiveness of alternative prostate-specific antigen--based prostate cancer screening strategies: model estimates of potential benefits and harms.', 'Overdiagnosis due to prostate-specific antigen screening: lessons from U.S. prostate cancer incidence trends.', 'Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Göteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Training Community African American and Hispanic/Latino/a Advocates on Prostate Cancer (PCa): a Multicultural and Bicoastal Approach.', 'Associations of Content and Context of Communication with Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing.', 'Increasing aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Changes in prostate cancer survival among insured patients in relation to USPSTF screening recommendations.', 'Harm-to-Benefit of Three Decades of Prostate Cancer Screening in Black Men.']"""

However, CTCs are rare and their detection requires sensitive and specific methods to overcome the overwhelming hematocyte population. Therefore, CTC detection remains technically challenging.  Methods:   An assay was developed for detecting viable and tissue-specific CTCs using a tropism-enhanced and conditionally replicating reporter adenovirus (CTC-RV). Adenoviral replication was made prostate-specific by placing the E1A gene under the control of the probasin promoter and prostate-specific antigen enhancer (PSE-PBN). Viral tropism was expanded through capsid-displayed integrin targeting peptides. A secreted reporter, humanized Metridia Luciferase (hMLuc), was engineered for expression during the major late phase of viral replication. The assay involves red blood cell lysis, cell collection, viral infection, and subsequent quantification of reporter activity from cellular media. Assay and reporter stability, cell specificity and sensitivity were evaluated in cell dilution models in human blood.  Results:   A conditionally replicating prostate-selective adenovirus reporter and CTC assay system were generated. The secreted reporter, MLuc, was found to be stable for at least 3 days under assay conditions. CTC detection, modeled by cell dilution in blood, was selective for androgen receptor positive prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Serial dilution demonstrated assay linearity and sensitivity to as few as three cells. Prostate cancer cell viability declined after several hours in anticoagulated blood at ambient temperatures.

Identifying new downstream effectors of the androgens/AR pathway will allow a better understanding of these mechanisms and could reveal novel biomarkers and/or therapeutic agents to improve the rate of patient survival. We compared the microRNA expression profiles in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells stimulated or not with 1 nM R1881 by performing a high-throughput reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR and found that miR-135a was upregulated. After androgen stimulation, we showed that AR directly activates the transcription of miR-135a2 gene by binding to an androgen response element in the promoter region. Our findings identify miR-135a as a novel effector in androgens/AR signaling. Using xenograft experiments in chick embryos and adult male mice, we showed that miR-135a overexpression decreases in vivo invasion abilities of prostate PC-3 cells. Through in vitro wound-healing migration and invasion assays, we demonstrated that this effect is mediated through downregulating ROCK1 and ROCK2 expression, two genes that we characterized as miR-135a direct target genes. In human surgical samples from prostatectomy, we observed that miR-135a expression was lower in tumoral compared with paired adjacent normal tissues, mainly in tumors classified with a high Gleason score (⩾8). Moreover, miR-135a expression is lower in invasive tumors, showing extraprostatic extension, as compared with intraprostatic localized tumors. In tumor relative to normal glands, we also showed a more frequently higher ROCK1 protein expression determined using a semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry analysis. Therefore, in tumor cells, the lower miR-135a expression could lead to a higher ROCK1 protein expression, which could explain their invasion abilities.

The findings in cell lines were further validated in human prostate cancer tissues. Strikingly, ectopic expression of miR-409 in normal prostate fibroblasts conferred a cancer-associated stroma-like phenotype and led to the release of miR-409 via extracellular vesicles to promote tumor induction and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in vitro and in vivo. miR-409 promoted tumorigenesis through repression of tumor suppressor genes such as Ras suppressor 1 and stromal antigen 2. Thus, stromal fibroblasts derived miR-409-induced tumorigenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness of the epithelial cancer cells in vivo.

This investigation identified changes in phosphorylation of signaling proteins such as MEK, LYN, PRAS40, YAP1 and PAK2, indicating the concomitant activation of several oncogenic pathways in castration-resistant tumors, a notion that was confirmed by tumor transcriptome analysis. Further analysis demonstrated that the activation of mTORC1, PAK2 and the increased levels of YAP1 in castration-resistant tumors can be explained by the loss of androgen inhibitory actions. The analysis of clinical samples demonstrated elevated levels of PAK2 and YAP1 in castration-resistant tumors, whereas knockdown experiments in androgen-independent cells demonstrated that both YAP1 and PAK2 regulate cell colony formation and cell invasion activity. PAK2 also influenced cell proliferation and mitotic timing. Interestingly, these phenotypic changes occur in the absence of obvious alterations in the activity of AKT, MAPK or mTORC1 pathways, suggesting that PAK2 and YAP1 may represent novel targets for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.

HIF-1 transcriptional activity is strictly controlled by protein levels of the HIF-1α subunit, which is tightly regulated by a well-characterized O2 -dependent ubiquitin ligase-proteasomal degradation pathway. The cold-sensitive Ca(2+) channel protein TRPM8 exhibits increased expression in advanced prostate cancer. However, its exact functional roles in prostate cancer growth regulation are unclear and controversial. In this work, we show that TRPM8 promotes in vitro hypoxic growth capacities, drug resistance, and in vivo tumourigenicity, accompanied with enhanced HIF-1α protein levels. These effects are further potentiated by TRPM8 agonists but suppressed by TRPM8 gene knockdown and blocking with antagonists or TRPM8 antibody. TRPM8-induced suppression of HIF-1α ubiquitination and enhanced HIF-1 transactivation were attenuated by forced RACK1 expression and TRPM8 overexpression reduced phospho-RACK1 levels, thus affecting its dimerization status, and promoted RACK1 binding to HIF-1α and calcineurin. These data indicate that TRPM8-induced increase of HIF-1α protein in hypoxia- or normoxia-exposed prostate cancer cells was mediated through a newly characterized Ca(2+) -dependent but O2 -independent mechanism involving binding of RACK1 to HIF-1α and RACK1-mediated ubiquitination of HIF-1α. Collectively, our study not only provides a mechanistic insight into how TRPM8 promotes the hypoxic growth adaptation of cancer cells via its promotion of RACK1-mediated stabilization of HIF-1α but also suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer by targeting TRPM8.""","""['Shan Yu', 'Zhenyu Xu', 'Chang Zou', 'Dinglan Wu', 'Yuliang Wang', 'Xiaoqiang Yao', 'Chi-Fai Ng', 'Franky L Chan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['Re: Ion Channel TRPM8 Promotes Hypoxic Growth of Prostate Cancer Cells via an O2-Independent and RACK1-Mediated Mechanism of HIF-1α Stabilization.', 'Re: Ion Channel TRPM8 Promotes Hypoxic Growth of Prostate Cancer Cells via an O2-Independent and RACK1-Mediated Mechanism of HIF-1α Stabilization.', 'ERRα augments HIF-1 signalling by directly interacting with HIF-1α in normoxic and hypoxic prostate cancer cells.', 'Calcineurin promotes hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha expression by dephosphorylating RACK1 and blocking RACK1 dimerization.', 'RACK1 vs. HSP90: competition for HIF-1 alpha degradation vs. stabilization.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in human breast and prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic potential of TRPM8 channels in cancer treatment.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Activation of Piezo1 contributes to matrix stiffness-induced angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The modulation of ion channels in cancer chemo-resistance.', 'Tissue immunostaining of candidate prognostic proteins in metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

A handful of analytical studies have suggested a possible etiological role for sunlight exposure. We report here on the association between leisure-time sunlight exposure during adulthood and PCa risk in the context of a population-based case-control study.  Methods:   In all, 1,904 PCa cases were ascertained across Montreal French hospitals between 2005 and 2009. Concurrently, 1,962 population controls, frequency matched to cases by age (±5 years), were selected from the electoral list for French-speakers in Greater Montreal. Interviews elicited the frequency of engagement in any leisure activity during adulthood. This was used to derive cumulative sunlight exposure indices: a cumulative number of leisure activities events entailing sunlight exposure and a cumulative duration of sunlight exposure during leisure activities. Unconditional logistic regression was conducted to yield odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for estimating the association between sunlight exposure indices and PCa risk, adjusting for age, ancestry, family history of PCa, PCa screening, education, solar protection, body mass index and physical activity.  Results:   Compared with men in the upper quartile category for the number of sunlight exposure events, men never exposed during leisure time had an OR of 1.32 (95% CI: 0.82-2.14). ORs were 1.11, 0.91 and 1.00 for the first to the third quartiles of exposure, respectively. Similar results were observed for cumulative duration of exposure to sunlight, and by PCa aggressiveness.  Conclusion:   These findings provide little evidence of an association between sunlight exposure during leisure-time and PCa risk. Men with no sunlight exposure appeared at somewhat higher risks but none of the estimates achieved statistical significance.""","""['Jennifer Yu', 'Jérôme Lavoué', 'Marie-Élise Parent']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['Occupation, industry, and the risk of prostate cancer: a case-control study in Montréal, Canada.', 'General and abdominal obesity trajectories across adulthood, and risk of prostate cancer: results from the PROtEuS study, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sexual partners, sexually transmitted infections, and prostate cancer risk.', 'Leisure time physical activity and risk of prostate cancer: a dose-response meta-analysis.', 'Leisure time, sunlight exposure and cataracts.', 'Metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in Montreal, Canada.']"""

The previous published data on the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism and cancer risk remained controversial. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between cancer susceptibility and XRCC1 Arg194Trp (59,227 cases and 81,587 controls from 201 studies) polymorphism in different inheritance models. We used odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals to assess the strength of the association. Overall, significantly increased cancer risk was found (recessive model: (odds ration [OR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-1.27; homozygous model: OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.10-1.33; additive model: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.09) when all eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. In further stratified and sensitivity analyses, significantly increased glioma risk was found among Asians, significantly decreased lung cancer risk was found among Caucasians, and significant increased breast cancer risk was found among hospital-based studies. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that Arg194Trp polymorphism may be associated with increased breast cancer risk, Arg194Trp polymorphism is associated with increased glioma risk among Asians, and Arg194Trp polymorphism is associated with decreased lung cancer risk among Caucasians. In addition, our work also points out the importance of new studies for Arg194Trp association in some cancer types, such as gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and nasopharyngeal cancers, where at least some of the covariates responsible for heterogeneity could be controlled, to obtain a more conclusive understanding about the function of the XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism in cancer development (I (2) > 75%).""","""['Yan-Zhong Feng', 'Yi-Ling Liu', 'Xiao-Feng He', 'Wu Wei', 'Xu-Liang Shen', 'Dao-Lin Xie']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['The XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism was associated with the risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma development: Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The XRCC1 Arg194Trp and Arg280His polymorphisms in head and neck cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis.', 'XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism is associated with oral cancer risk: evidence from a meta-analysis.', 'Association between the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and risk of cancer: evidence from 297 case-control studies.', 'X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis.', 'The XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism was associated with the risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma development: Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The association between XRCC1 polymorphism and laryngeal cancer susceptibility in different ethnic groups in Xinjiang, China.', 'Association between XRCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and susceptibility to nasopharyngeal carcinoma: An update meta-analysis.', 'Association between Polymorphisms of X-Ray Repair Cross Complementing Group 1 Gene and Pancreatic Cancer Risk: a Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis.', 'Genetic Variations of DNA Repair Genes in Breast Cancer.']"""

The aims were to check consistency between dose plans and to validate whether in-house pre-treatment verification results agreed with those of an external audit.  Materials and methods:   Participating centres used two mock cases (prostate and head and neck) for the intercomparison and audit. Compliance to dosimetric goals and total number of MU per plan were collected. A simple quality index to compare the different plans was proposed. We compared gamma index pass rates using the centre's equipment and methodology to those of an external audit.  Results:   While for the prostate case, all centres fulfilled the dosimetric goals and plan quality was homogeneous, that was not the case for the head and neck case. The number of MU did not correlate with the plan quality index. Pre-treatment verifications results of the external audit did not agree with those of the in-house measurements for two centres: being within tolerance for in-house measurements and unacceptable for the audit or the other way round.  Conclusions:   Although all plans fulfilled dosimetric constraints, plan quality is highly dependent on the planner expertise.

Here we demonstrate that hydroxychavicol (HC), extracted and purified from Piper betel leaves, significantly inhibits growth and proliferation via ROS generation in human prostate cancer, PC-3 cells. HC perturbed cell-cycle kinetics and progression, reduced clonogenicity and mediated cytotoxicity by ROS-induced DNA damage leading to activation of several pro-apoptotic molecules. In addition, HC treatment elicited a novel autophagic response as evidenced by the appearance of acidic vesicular organelles and increased expression of autophagic markers, LC3-IIb and beclin-1. Interestingly, quenching of ROS with tiron, an antioxidant, offered significant protection against HC-induced inhibition of cell growth and down regulation of caspase-3, suggesting the crucial role of ROS in mediating cell death. The collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential by HC further revealed the link between ROS generation and induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Our data showed remarkable inhibition of prostate tumor xenografts by ~72% upon daily oral administration of 150mg/kg bw HC by quantitative tumor volume measurements and non-invasive real-time bioluminescent imaging. HC was well-tolerated at this dosing level without any observable toxicity. This is the first report to demonstrate the anti-prostate cancer efficacy of HC in vitro and in vivo, which is perhaps attributable to its selective prooxidant activity to eliminate cancer cells thus providing compelling grounds for future preclinical studies to validate its potential usefulness for prostate cancer management.""","""['Sushma Reddy Gundala', 'Chunhua Yang', 'Rao Mukkavilli', 'Rutugandha Paranjpe', 'Meera Brahmbhatt', 'Vaishali Pannu', 'Alice Cheng', 'Michelle D Reid', 'Ritu Aneja']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Hydroxychavicol as a potential anticancer agent (Review).', 'Piper betel leaf extract: anticancer benefits and bio-guided fractionation to identify active principles for prostate cancer management.', 'Hydroxychavicol from Piper betle induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Hydroxychavicol, a novel betel leaf component, inhibits platelet aggregation by suppression of cyclooxygenase, thromboxane production and calcium mobilization.', 'Piper betel leaf: a reservoir of potential xenohormetic nutraceuticals with cancer-fighting properties.', 'Effects of Piper betle Extracts against Biofilm Formation by Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius Isolated from Dogs.', 'Hydroxychavicol as a potential anticancer agent (Review).', 'A Review of Bioactive Compounds and Antioxidant Activity Properties of Piper Species.', 'Inhibitory Mechanism of Combined Hydroxychavicol With Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Against Glioma Cancer Cell Lines: A Transcriptomic Analysis.', 'Hydroxychavicol, a polyphenol from Piper betle leaf extract, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in TP53-resistant HT-29 colon cancer cells.']"""
