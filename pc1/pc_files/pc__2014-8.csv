In addition to prostatectomy, definitive irradiation plays an increasing role in the treatment of localized disease.  Aim:   The authors wanted to share their experience obtained with the use of the Novalis TX linear accelerator for the application of dose-escalation, dynamic, intensity modulated arc therapy with the routine usage of cone-beam computer tomography based or image guided radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer.  Method:   Between 2011, December and 2013, February the authors performed 102 treatments. In 10 low risk and 10 high risk prostate cancer patients (median age: 72.5 years) three-dimensional conformal plans with the same target volume coverage were created and tolerance doses of organs at risk (OAR) were compared.  Results:   Compared to three-dimensional conformal techniques, intensity modulated arc therapy treatments produced a significantly lower dose at organ at risk that led to a more favorable early toxicity rate.  Conclusions:   The intensity modulated arc therapy with image guided radiotherapy proved to be a safe standard treatment mode in the daily routine in the institute of the authors. Late toxicity and local control rates need to be further examined.""","""['Szabolcs Szappanos', 'Róbert Farkas', 'Zoltán Lőcsei', 'Zoltán László', 'Judit Kalincsák', 'Szabolcs Bellyei', 'Zsolt Sebestyén', 'László Csapó', 'Klára Sebestyén', 'Judit Halász', 'Zoltán Musch', 'Tamás Beöthe', 'László Farkas', 'László Mangel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Orv Hetil""","""['Megavoltage cone beam computed tomography dose and the necessity of reoptimization for imaging dose-integrated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Improved clinical outcomes with high-dose image guided radiotherapy compared with non-IGRT for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.']"""

Patients and methods:   Patients with GU malignancies referred to our Phase I Clinical Trials Program were evaluated for MET mutation and amplification and outcomes using protocols with c-MET inhibitors.  Results:   MET amplification was found in 7 of 97 (7.2%) patients (4/27 renal [all clear cell], 1/18 urothelial, and 2/12 adrenocortical carcinoma), with MET mutation/variant in 3 of 54 (5.6%) (2/20 renal cell carcinoma [RCC] [1 clear cell and 1 papillary] and 1/16 prostate cancer). No demographic characteristics were associated with specific MET abnormalities, but patients who tested positive for mutation or amplification had more metastatic sites (median, 4 vs. 3 for wild type MET). Median overall survival after phase I consultation was 6.1 and 11.5 months for patients with and without a MET alteration, respectively (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.9; P = .034). Twenty-nine (25%) patients were treated according to a c-MET inhibitor protocol. Six (21%) had a partial response (prostate and RCC) and 10 (34%) had stable disease as best response.

Pulsed low-dose rate (PLDR) external beam radiotherapy has the potential to reduce normal tissue toxicities while providing significant tumor control for recurrent cancers. This work investigates treatment planning techniques for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)-based PLDR treatment of various sites, including cases with pancreatic and prostate cancer. A total of 20 patients with clinical recurrence were selected for this study, including 10 cases with pancreatic cancer and 10 with prostate cancer. Large variations in the target volume were included to test the ability of IMRT using the existing treatment planning system and optimization algorithm to deliver uniform doses in individual gantry angles/fields for PLDR treatments. Treatment plans were generated with 10 gantry angles using the step-and-shoot IMRT delivery technique, which can be delivered in 3-minute intervals to achieve an effective low dose rate of 6.7cGy/min. Instead of dose constraints on critical structures, ring structures were mainly used in PLDR-IMRT optimization. In this study, the PLDR-IMRT plans were compared with the PLDR-3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) plans and the PLDR-RapidArc plans. For the 10 cases with pancreatic cancer that were investigated, the mean planning target volume (PTV) dose for each gantry angle in the PLDR-IMRT plans ranged from 17.6 to 22.4cGy. The maximum doses ranged between 22.9 and 34.8cGy. The minimum doses ranged from 8.2 to 17.5cGy. For the 10 cases with prostate cancer that were investigated, the mean PTV doses for individual gantry angles ranged from 18.8 to 22.6cGy. The maximum doses per gantry angle were between 24.0 and 34.7cGy. The minimum doses per gantry angle ranged from 4.4 to 17.4cGy. A significant reduction in the organ at risk (OAR) dose was observed with the PLDR-IMRT plan when compared with that using the PLDR-3DCRT plan. The volume receiving an 18-Gy (V18) dose for the left and right kidneys was reduced by 10.6% and 12.5%, respectively, for the pancreatic plans. The volume receiving a 45-Gy (V45) dose for the small bowel decreased from 65.3% to 45.5%. For the cases with prostate cancer, the volume receiving a 40-Gy (V40) dose for the bladder and the rectum was reduced significantly by 25.1% and 51.2%, respectively. When compared with the RapidArc technique, the volume receiving a 30-Gy (V30) dose for the left and the right kidneys was lower in the IMRT plans. For most OARs, no significant differences were observed between the PLDR-IMRT and the PLDR-RapidArc plans. These results clearly demonstrated that the PLDR-IMRT plan was suitable for PLDR pancreatic and prostate cancer treatments in terms of the overall plan quality. A significant reduction in the OAR dose was achieved with the PLDR-IMRT plan when compared with that using the PLDR-3DCRT plan. For most OARs, no significant differences were observed between the PLDR-IMRT and the PLDR-RapidArc plans. When compared with the PLDR-3DCRT plan, the PLDR-IMRT plan could provide superior target coverage and normal tissue sparing for PLDR reirradiation of recurrent pancreatic and prostate cancers. The PLDR-IMRT plan is an effective treatment choice for recurrent cancers in most cancer centers.""","""['Jie Li', 'Jinyi Lang', 'Pei Wang', 'Shengwei Kang', 'Mu-Han Lin', 'Xiaoming Chen', 'Fu Chen', 'Ming Guo', 'Lili Chen', 'Chang-Ming Charlie Ma']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['SU-E-T-383: Pulsed Low Dose Rate Radiotherapy Using Advanced Treatment Methods: A Novel Technique for Patient Re-Irradiation.', 'Investigation of pulsed low dose rate radiotherapy using dynamic arc delivery techniques.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Intensity modulated radiotherapy with dynamic multileaf collimator.

We aim to evaluate the long-term EF following seed brachytherapy (BT) treatment.  Materials and methods:   The study consisted of 366 patients treated with BT at our institution, who completed the IIEF-5 questionnaire and reported no or mild erectile dysfunction (ED) pre-BT. The probability of EF preservation post-BT was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methods. The difference in EF preservation by patient-, tumour- and treatment-related factors was assessed using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression was used to estimate the effect of each factor on EF preservation.  Results:   Of the 366 patients, 277 (76%) reported normal EF, and 89 (24%) reported mild ED. The patients were followed-up for a median of 41 months (range: 3-124), and the 5-year actuarial rate of EF preservation was 59%. Age at BT seed implant, presence of medical comorbidities, Gleason score and the biologically effective dose (BED) are associated with EF preservation (P < 0.005). The association for these four factors remains statistically significant in multivariate analysis, with Gleason score having the strongest effect (HR = 3.7; 95% CI = 2.6-5.4).

To date, there are no reliable predictors for prostate cancer recurrence, and novel predictors are urgently needed. PCDH10 (protocadherin-10) is a novel tumor suppressor gene, which is down-regulated by promoter methylation in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using PCDH10 methylation to predict the biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.  Material/methods:   Fresh tissue samples were obtained from 151 patients with primary prostate cancer, and from 34 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as control. The methylation status of PCDH10 in prostate cancer tissues and controls were examined using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and then associated with clinicopathological features and BCR-free survival of patients with prostate cancer.  Results:   We found that PCDH10 methylation was detected in 79 (52.3%) patients with prostate cancer, but no methylation was found in controls (P<0.0001). Moreover, PCDH10 methylation was significantly associated with higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (P <0.0001), higher Gleason Score (P<0.0001), advanced clinical stage (P=0.0002), lymph node metastasis (P=0.0389), angiolymphatic invasion (P=0.0303), and biochemical recurrence (P=0.0068). Moreover, PCDH10 methylation was associated with poor BCR-free survival (P<0.0001), and may be used as an independent predictor of BCR-free survival (P=0.0046).  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that PCDH10 methylation in prostate cancer tissue is an independent prognostic biomarker of worse BCR-free survival of patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.""","""['Li Wang', 'Pei-Gen Xie', 'Ying-Li Lin', 'Jian-Guo Ma', 'Wen-Ping Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['The role of Pcdh10 in neurological disease and cancer.', 'Aberrant methylation of protocadherin 17 and its clinical significance in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic Value of Protocadherin10 (PCDH10) Methylation in Serum of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Aberrant Promoter Methylation of Protocadherin8 (PCDH8) in Serum is a Potential Prognostic Marker for Low Gleason Score Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent advances in understanding DNA methylation of prostate cancer.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'The role of Pcdh10 in neurological disease and cancer.', 'Innovative mouse models for the tumor suppressor activity of Protocadherin-10 isoforms.', 'Signature Panel of 11 Methylated mRNAs and 3 Methylated lncRNAs for Prediction of Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Do Protocadherins Show Prognostic Value in the Carcinogenesis of Human Malignant Neoplasms?

Methods:   The planning system (called CARMEN) is a full MC-TPS, controlled through aMATLAB interface, which is based on the sequencing of a novel map, called ""biophysical"" map, which is generated from enhanced image data of patients to achieve a set of segments actually deliverable. In order to reduce the required computation time, the conventional fluence map has been replaced by the biophysical map which is sequenced to provide direct apertures that will later be weighted by means of an optimization algorithm based on linear programming. A ray-casting algorithm throughout the patient CT assembles information about the found structures, the mass thickness crossed, as well as PET values. Data are recorded to generate a biophysical map for each gantry angle. These maps are the input files for a home-made sequencer developed to take into account the interactions of photons and electrons with the MLC. For each linac (Axesse of Elekta and Primus of Siemens) and energy beam studied (6, 9, 12, 15 MeV and 6 MV), phase space files were simulated with the EGSnrc/BEAMnrc code. The dose calculation in patient was carried out with the BEAMDOSE code. This code is a modified version of EGSnrc/DOSXYZnrc able to calculate the beamlet dose in order to combine them with different weights during the optimization process.  Results:   Three complex radiotherapy treatments were selected to check the reliability of CARMEN in situations where the MC calculation can offer an added value: A head-and-neck case (Case I) with three targets delineated on PET/CT images and a demanding dose-escalation; a partial breast irradiation case (Case II) solved with photon and electron modulated beams (IMRT + MERT); and a prostatic bed case (Case III) with a pronounced concave-shaped PTV by using volumetric modulated arc therapy. In the three cases, the required target prescription doses and constraints on organs at risk were fulfilled in a short enough time to allow routine clinical implementation. The quality assurance protocol followed to check CARMEN system showed a high agreement with the experimental measurements.  Conclusions:   A Monte Carlo treatment planning model exclusively based on maps performed from patient imaging data has been presented. The sequencing of these maps allows obtaining deliverable apertures which are weighted for modulation under a linear programming formulation. The model is able to solve complex radiotherapy treatments with high accuracy in an efficient computation time.""","""['A Ureba', 'F J Salguero', 'A R Barbeiro', 'E Jimenez-Ortega', 'J A Baeza', 'H Miras', 'R Linares', 'M Perucha', 'A Leal']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Beamlet based direct aperture optimization for MERT using a photon MLC.', 'Direct aperture optimization for IMRT using Monte Carlo generated beamlets.', 'Phantomless patient-specific TomoTherapy QA via delivery performance monitoring and a secondary Monte Carlo dose calculation.', 'High-density dental implants and radiotherapy planning: evaluation of effects on dose distribution using pencil beam convolution algorithm and Monte Carlo method.', 'Recent advances in light ion radiation therapy.', 'Clinical Feasibility Study of Gold Nanoparticles as Theragnostic Agents for Precision Radiotherapy.', 'Implications of the Harmonization of 18FFDG-PET/CT Imaging for Response Assessment of Treatment in Radiotherapy Planning.', 'Accurate, robust and harmonized implementation of morpho-functional imaging in treatment planning for personalized radiotherapy.', 'Monte Carlo systems used for treatment planning and dose verification.', '3D VMAT Verification Based on Monte Carlo Log File Simulation with Experimental Feedback from Film Dosimetry.']"""

Methods:   The SDI approach to movements rotating around a predefined isocenter, referred to as a GeoIso, instead of a mechanical pivot point was developed by the robot automation industry. With robotic couch-sag corrections for weight load in a traditional SDI approach, movements could be accurately executed for a GeoIso located within a 500 mm cubic volume on the couch for treatments. The accuracy of SDI movement was investigated using the OTPS. The GeoIso was assumed to align with the proton beam isocenter (RadIso) for gantry at the reference angle. However, the misalignment between GeoIso and RadIso was quantitatively investigated by measuring the displacements at various couch angles for a target placed at the RadIso at an initial couch angle. When circular target displacements occur on a plane, a relative isocenter shift (RIS) correction could be applied in the SDI movement to minimize target displacements. Target displacements at a fixed gantry angle without and with RIS correction were measured for 12 robotic couches. Target displacements for various gantry angles were performed on three couches in gantry rooms to study the gantry-induced RadIso shift. The RIS correction can also be applied for the RadIso shift. A new SDI approach incorporating the RIS correction with the couch sag is described in this study. In parallel, the accuracy of SDI translation movements for various weight loads of patients on the couch was investigated during positioning of patients for proton prostate treatments.  Results:   For a fixed gantry angle, measured target displacements without RIS correction for couch rotations in the horizontal plane varied from 4 to 20 mm. However, measured displacements perpendicular to couch rotation plane were about 2 mm for all couches. Extracted misalignments of GeoIso and RadIso in the horizontal plane were about 10 mm for one couch and within 3 mm for the rest of couches. After applying the RIS correction, the residual target displacements for couch rotations were within 0.5 mm to RadIso for all couches. For various gantry angles, measured target location for each angle was within 0.5 mm to its excepted location by the preset RadIso shift. Measured target displacements for ± 30° of couch rotations were within 0.5 mm for gantry angles at 0° and 180°. Overall, nearly 85% of couch movements were within 0.5 mm in the horizontal plane and 0.7 mm vector distance from required displacements.  Conclusions:   The authors present an optical tracking methodology to quantify for software-driven isocentric movements of robotic couches. By applying proper RIS correction for misaligned GeoIso and RadIso for each couch, and the RadIso shifts for a moving gantry, residual target displacements for isocentric couch movements around the actual RadIso can be reduced to submillimeter tolerance.""","""['Wen C Hsi', 'Aaron Law', 'Andreas N Schreuder', 'Omar A Zeidan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Utilization of optical tracking to assess efficacy of intracranial immobilization techniques in proton therapy.', 'Commissioning of a proton gantry equipped with dual x-ray imagers and a robotic patient positioner, and evaluation of the accuracy of single-beam image registration for this system.', 'Validating robotic couch isocentricity with 3D surface imaging.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Patient positioning in the proton radiotherapy era.', 'Effectiveness of base-of-skull immobilization system in a compact proton therapy setting.', 'Utilization of optical tracking to assess efficacy of intracranial immobilization techniques in proton therapy.']"""

In this study, a method for independent dose calculation of tomotherapy treatment plans is presented, that uses a conventional treatment planning system with a pencil kernel dose calculation algorithm for generation of verification dose distributions based on patient CT data.  Methods:   A pencil beam algorithm that directly uses measured beam data was configured for dose calculation for a tomotherapy machine. Tomotherapy treatment plans were converted into a format readable by an in-house treatment planning system by assigning each projection to one static treatment field and shifting the calculation isocenter for each field in order to account for the couch movement. The modulation of the fluence for each projection is read out of the delivery sinogram, and with the kernel-based dose calculation, this information can directly be used for dose calculation without the need for decomposition of the sinogram. The sinogram values are only corrected for leaf output and leaf latency. Using the converted treatment plans, dose was recalculated with the independent treatment planning system. Multiple treatment plans ranging from simple static fields to real patient treatment plans were calculated using the new approach and either compared to actual measurements or the 3D dose distribution calculated by the tomotherapy treatment planning system. In addition, dose-volume histograms were calculated for the patient plans.  Results:   Except for minor deviations at the maximum field size, the pencil beam dose calculation for static beams agreed with measurements in a water tank within 2%/2 mm. A mean deviation to point dose measurements in the cheese phantom of 0.89% ± 0.81% was found for unmodulated helical plans. A mean voxel-based deviation of -0.67% ± 1.11% for all voxels in the respective high dose region (dose values >80%), and a mean local voxel-based deviation of -2.41% ± 0.75% for all voxels with dose values >20% were found for 11 modulated plans in the cheese phantom. Averaged over nine patient plans, the deviations amounted to -0.14% ± 1.97% (voxels >80%) and -0.95% ± 2.27% (>20%, local deviations). For a lung case, mean voxel-based deviations of more than 4% were found, while for all other patient plans, all mean voxel-based deviations were within ± 2.4%.  Conclusions:   The presented method is suitable for independent dose calculation for helical tomotherapy within the known limitations of the pencil beam algorithm. It can serve as verification of the primary dose calculation and thereby reduce the need for time-consuming measurements. By using the patient anatomy and generating full 3D dose data, and combined with measurements of additional machine parameters, it can substantially contribute to overall patient safety.""","""['Sebastian Klüter', 'Kai Schubert', 'Steffen Lissner', 'Florian Sterzing', 'Dieter Oetzel', 'Jürgen Debus', 'Wolfgang Schlegel', 'Uwe Oelfke', 'Simeon Nill']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Phantomless patient-specific TomoTherapy QA via delivery performance monitoring and a secondary Monte Carlo dose calculation.', 'Clinical implementation of Dosimetry Check™ for TomoTherapy® delivery quality assurance.', 'Fast, simple, and informative patient-specific dose verification method for intensity modulated total marrow irradiation with helical tomotherapy.', 'Dosimetric effects of rotational output variation and x-ray target degradation on helical tomotherapy plans.', 'From model-based dose computation to tomotherapy.', 'Measurement-guided volumetric dose reconstruction for helical tomotherapy.']"""

The goal of the evaluation is to identify circumstances when the methods behave differently and to describe the mechanism behind the differences when they occur.  Methods:   The worst case methods optimize plans to perform as well as possible under the worst case scenario that can physically occur (composite worst case), the combination of the worst case scenarios for each objective constituent considered independently (objectivewise worst case), and the combination of the worst case scenarios for each voxel considered independently (voxelwise worst case). These three methods were assessed with respect to treatment planning for prostate under systematic setup uncertainty. An equivalence with probabilistic optimization was used to identify the scenarios that determine the outcome of the optimization.  Results:   If the conflict between target coverage and normal tissue sparing is small and no dose-volume histogram (DVH) constraints are present, then all three methods yield robust plans. Otherwise, they all have their shortcomings: Composite worst case led to unnecessarily low plan quality in boundary scenarios that were less difficult than the worst case ones. Objectivewise worst case generally led to nonrobust plans. Voxelwise worst case led to overly conservative plans with respect to DVH constraints, which resulted in excessive dose to normal tissue, and less sharp dose fall-off than the other two methods.  Conclusions:   The three worst case methods have clearly different behaviors. These behaviors can be understood from which scenarios that are active in the optimization. No particular method is superior to the others under all circumstances: composite worst case is suitable if the conflicts are not very severe or there are DVH constraints whereas voxelwise worst case is advantageous if there are severe conflicts but no DVH constraints.

Results:   Of the 138 patients, PCa was detected on needle biopsy in 81 patients (58.7%); of these 81 patients with PCa, 60 were PPIX-positive (sensitivity: 74.1%). Although 57 patients did not harbor PCa by conventional diagnostic procedures, 17 of these at-risk patients were found to be PPIX-positive (specificity: 70.2%). PPIX-PDD was more sensitive compared with DRE and transrectal ultrasound and more specific compared with PSA and PSA density. The incidence of PPIX-PDD positivity did not increase with increasing total PSA levels, tumor stage or Gleason score.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of PPIX in urine sediments treated with 5-ALA used to detect PCa in a noninvasive yet highly sensitive manner. However, further studies are warranted to determine the role of PPIX-PPD for PCa detection.""","""['Yasushi Nakai', 'Satoshi Anai', 'Masaomi Kuwada', 'Makito Miyake', 'Yoshitomo Chihara', 'Nobumichi Tanaka', 'Akihide Hirayama', 'Katsunori Yoshida', 'Yoshihiko Hirao', 'Kiyohide Fujimoto']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Spectrophotometric photodynamic diagnosis of prostate cancer cells excreted in voided urine using 5-aminolevulinic acid.', 'Photodynamic diagnosis of prostate cancer using 5-aminolevulinic acid--first clinical experiences.', 'Photodynamic diagnosis using 5-aminolevulinic acid for the detection of positive surgical margins during radical prostatectomy in patients with carcinoma of the prostate: a multicentre, prospective, phase 2 trial of a diagnostic procedure.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Aminolevulinic Acid-Based Tumor Detection and Therapy: Molecular Mechanisms and Strategies for Enhancement.', '5-Aminolevulinic acid overcomes hypoxia-induced radiation resistance by enhancing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production in prostate cancer cells.', 'Detection of Canine Urothelial Carcinoma Cells in Urine Using 5-Aminolevulinic Acid.', 'Selective Microfluidic Capture and Detection of Prostate Cancer Cells from Urine without Digital Rectal Examination.', 'Shedding Light on Bladder Cancer Diagnosis in Urine.', 'Detection of Clinical Mesenchymal Cancer Cells from Bladder Wash Urine for Real-Time Detection and Prognosis.']"""

This property allows androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells to evade galectin-1 (LGALS1)-induced apoptosis, but the mechanism is not known. We have recently reported that Golgi targeting of glycosyltransferases is mediated by golgins: giantin (GOLGB1) for C2GnT-M (GCNT3) and GM130 (GOLGA2)-GRASP65 (GORASP1) or GM130-giantin for core 1 synthase. Here, we show that for Golgi targeting, C2GnT-L also uses giantin exclusively whereas ST3Gal1 uses either giantin or GM130-GRASP65. In addition, the compact Golgi morphology is detected in both androgen-sensitive prostate cancer and normal prostate cells, but fragmented Golgi and mislocalization of C2GnT-L are found in androgen-refractory cells as well as primary prostate tumors (Gleason grade 2-4). Furthermore, failure of giantin monomers to be phosphorylated and dimerized prevents Golgi from forming compact morphology and C2GnT-L from targeting the Golgi. On the other hand, ST3Gal1 reaches the Golgi by an alternate site, GM130-GRASP65. Interestingly, inhibition or knockdown of non-muscle myosin IIA (MYH9) motor protein frees up Rab6a GTPase to promote phosphorylation of giantin by polo-like kinase 3 (PLK3), which is followed by dimerization of giantin assisted by protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3), and restoration of compact Golgi morphology and targeting of C2GnT-L. Finally, the Golgi relocation of C2GnT-L in androgen-refractory cells results in their increased susceptibility to galectin-1-induced apoptosis by replacing sialyl-T antigen with polylactosamine.  Implications:   This study demonstrates the importance of Golgi morphology and regulation of glycosylation and provides insight into how the Golgi influences cancer progression and metastasis.""","""['Armen Petrosyan', 'Melissa S Holzapfel', 'David E Muirhead', 'Pi-Wan Cheng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Shifted Golgi targeting of glycosyltransferases and α-mannosidase IA from giantin to GM130-GRASP65 results in formation of high mannose N-glycans in aggressive prostate cancer cells.', 'Golgi fragmentation induced by heat shock or inhibition of heat shock proteins is mediated by non-muscle myosin IIA via its interaction with glycosyltransferases.', 'Keratin 1 plays a critical role in golgi localization of core 2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase M via interaction with its cytoplasmic tail.', 'Unlocking Golgi: Why Does Morphology Matter?', 'Emerging new roles of GM130, a cis-Golgi matrix protein, in higher order cell functions.', 'Golgi-apparatus genes related signature for predicting the progression-free interval of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'The factory, the antenna and the scaffold: the three-way interplay between the Golgi, cilium and extracellular matrix underlying tissue function.', 'Construction of long non-coding RNA- and microRNA-mediated competing endogenous RNA networks in alcohol-related esophageal cancer.', 'Alcohol and Prostate Cancer: Time to Draw Conclusions.', 'E-Cadherin Modulation and Inter-Cellular Trafficking in Tubular Gastric Adenocarcinoma: A High-Resolution Microscopy Pilot Study.']"""

The AR is activated by androgens that bind to its ligand-binding domain (LBD), causing the transcription factor to enter the nucleus and interact with genes via its conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD). Treatment for prostate cancer involves reducing androgen production or using anti-androgen drugs to block the interaction of hormones with the AR-LBD. Eventually the disease changes into a castration-resistant form of PCa where LBD mutations render anti-androgens ineffective or where constitutively active AR splice variants, lacking the LBD, become overexpressed. Recently, we identified a surfaced exposed pocket on the AR-DBD as an alternative drug-target site for AR inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that small molecules designed to selectively bind the pocket effectively block transcriptional activity of full-length and splice variant AR forms at low to sub-micromolar concentrations. The inhibition is lost when residues involved in drug interactions are mutated. Furthermore, the compounds did not impede nuclear localization of the AR and blocked interactions with chromatin, indicating the interference of DNA binding with the nuclear form of the transcription factor. Finally, we demonstrate the inhibition of gene expression and tumor volume in mouse xenografts.

Methods:   Data for this nested case-control analysis (n = 1,695 cases/1,682 controls) are from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Baseline serum was analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. The presence or absence of cancer was subsequently determined by prostate biopsy. Polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of 25(OH)D with risk of total, Gleason 2-6, Gleason 7, and Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer. Results are presented for placebo and finasteride arms separately and combined.  Results:   There were no associations of serum 25(OH)D with total prostate cancer risk. For Gleason 2-6 cancers, results were inconsistent across treatment arms with a suggestion of increased risk in the placebo arm only; however, there was no dose-response relationship. For Gleason 8-10 prostate cancers, 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with a linear decrease in risk among combined treatment arms [quartile 4 vs. 1: OR, 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.32-0.94; P(trend) = 0.04]. These findings were somewhat stronger among men ≥65 versus 55-64 years at baseline (quartile 4 vs. 1: OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.88 vs. OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.35-1.52, respectively; P(interaction) = 0.52).

The association between Fas -670 A/G polymorphism and cancer risk is still controversial and ambiguous. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of the currently literature to clarify this relationship.

Overall, 59 case-control studies with 17,035 cases and 23,155 controls were retrieved based on the search criteria for cancer susceptibility related to -670 A/G polymorphism in Fas gene. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) revealed association strengths. Although no significant relationship was detected between Fas -670 A/G polymorphism and whole cancer risk, in the ethnicity subgroup, significant associations were found in three types of cancer: prostate cancer (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01-1.11 for A-allele vs. G-allele); hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80-0.99 for AG vs. GG); esophageal cancer (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.92-0.99 for AA + AG vs. GG). Moreover, lower cancer risk was found in smokers carried A-allele, when compared to smokers carried the GG genotype.

Methods and materials:   Tumor volumes were delineated based on MRI and template biopsy results for 9 patients. WG, HEMI, and UF plans were produced assuming 19 Gy single fraction monotherapy treatments. For UF plans, a 6-mm margin was applied to the visible tumor to create a focal-planning target volume (F-PTV). Systematic source position shifts of 1-4 mm were applied to assess plan robustness. The dosimetric impact of steel catheters was assessed using MC simulation.  Results:   Mean D90 and V100 were 20.4 Gy and 97.9% for prostate in WG plans, 22.2 Gy and 98.1% for hemi-prostate in HEMI plans, and 23.0 Gy and 98.2% for F-PTV in UF plans. Mean urethra D10 was 20.3, 19.7, and 9.2 Gy in WG, HEMI, and UF plans, respectively. Mean rectal D2cc was 12.5, 9.8, and 4.6 Gy in WG, HEMI, and UF plans, respectively.

Investigating the frequency and function of immune suppressive cell subsets in the peripheral blood of 41 patients with prostate cancer (PC) and 36 healthy donors (HD) showed a significant increase in circulating CD14(+) HLA-DR(low/neg) monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) and Tregs in patients with PC compared to HD. Furthermore, M-MDSC frequencies correlated positively with Treg levels. In vitro proliferation assay with autologous T cells confirmed M-MDSC-mediated T-cell suppression, and intracellular staining of immune suppressive enzyme iNOS revealed a higher expression in M-MDSC from patients with PC. Increased frequencies of M-MDSC correlated with known negative prognostic markers in patients with PC including elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and prostate-specific antigen. Accordingly, high levels of M-MDSC were associated with a shorter median overall survival. Our data strongly suggest that M-MDSC, possibly along with Tregs, play a role in establishing an immune suppressive environment in patients with PC.

Furthermore, no evidence of association of this SNP with standard prognostic parameters of PCa progression was obtained in mentioned studies. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between PCa onset and progression to a more aggressive form, since it has not been assessed in a population of European descent.  Methods:   In this study, 286 samples of peripheral blood were obtained from patients with PCa, while the control group comprised 199 volunteers derived from general population who gave samples of buccal swabs. For individuals diagnosed with PCa clinicopathological characteristics including serum prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis, Gleason score (GS), and clinical stage were determined. Genotyping of rs2910164 was performed using Taqman(®) SNP Genotyping Assay. Analysis of SNP association was done using PLINK and SNPStats software.

High content analysis of single Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) enables sequential characterization of genotypic, morphometric and protein expression alterations in real time over the course of cancer treatment. This concept was investigated in a patient with castrate-resistant prostate cancer progressing through both chemotherapy and targeted therapy. In this case study, we integrate across four timepoints 41 genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) profiles plus morphometric parameters and androgen receptor (AR) protein levels. Remarkably, little change was observed in response to standard chemotherapy, evidenced by the fact that a unique clone (A), exhibiting highly rearranged CNV profiles and AR+ phenotype was found circulating before and after treatment. However, clinical response and subsequent progression after targeted therapy was associated with the drastic depletion of clone A, followed by the sequential emergence of two distinct CTC sub-populations that differed in both AR genotype and expression phenotype. While AR- cells with flat or pseudo-diploid CNV profiles (clone B) were identified at the time of response, a new tumor lineage of AR+ cells (clone C) with CNV altered profiles was detected during relapse. We showed that clone C, despite phylogenetically related to clone A, possessed a unique set of somatic CNV alterations, including MYC amplification, an event linked to hormone escape. Interesting, we showed that both clones acquired AR gene amplification by deploying different evolutionary paths. Overall, these data demonstrate the timeframe of tumor evolution in response to therapy and provide a framework for the multi-scale analysis of fluid biopsies to quantify and monitor disease evolution in individual patients.""","""['Angel E Dago', 'Asya Stepansky', 'Anders Carlsson', 'Madelyn Luttgen', 'Jude Kendall', 'Timour Baslan', 'Anand Kolatkar', 'Michael Wigler', 'Kelly Bethel', 'Mitchell E Gross', 'James Hicks', 'Peter Kuhn']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Chromosomal Instability Estimation Based on Next Generation Sequencing and Single Cell Genome Wide Copy Number Variation Analysis.', 'Discordant and heterogeneous clinically relevant genomic alterations in circulating tumor cells vs plasma DNA from men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Determination of the androgen receptor status of circulating tumour cells in metastatic breast cancer patients.', 'CTC-derived AR-V7 detection as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Lessons from tissue compartment-specific analysis of androgen receptor alterations in prostate cancer.', 'Plasticity of circulating tumor cells in small cell lung cancer.', 'Transitioning single-cell genomics into the clinic.', 'Profiling of Circulating Tumor Cells for Screening of Selective Inhibitors of Tumor-Initiating Stem-Like Cells.', 'Characterization of BCMA Expression in Circulating Rare Single Cells of Patients with Plasma Cell Neoplasms.', 'From multitude to singularity: An up-to-date overview of scRNA-seq data generation and analysis.']"""

In particular, gold nanoparticles have been investigated for separations, sensing, drug/nucleic acid delivery, and bioimaging. In addition, silver nanoparticles demonstrate antibacterial activity, resulting in potential application in treatments against microbial infections, burns, diabetic skin ulcers, and medical devices. Here, we describe the facile, parallel synthesis of both gold and silver nanoparticles using a small set of poly(amino ethers), or PAEs, derived from linear polyamines, under ambient conditions and in absence of additional reagents. The kinetics of nanoparticle formation were dependent on PAE concentration and chemical composition. In addition, yields were significantly greater in case of PAEs when compared to 25 kDa poly(ethylene imine), which was used as a standard catonic polymer. Ultraviolet radiation enhanced the kinetics and the yield of both gold and silver nanoparticles, likely by means of a coreduction effect. PAE-templated gold nanoparticles demonstrated the ability to deliver plasmid DNA, resulting in transgene expression, in 22Rv1 human prostate cancer and MB49 murine bladder cancer cell lines. Taken together, our results indicate that chemically diverse poly(amino ethers) can be employed for rapidly templating the formation of metal nanoparticles under ambient conditions.

L1 elements propagate through RNA intermediates. In the germ line, neighboring, nonrepetitive sequences are occasionally mobilized by the L1 machinery, a process called 3' transduction. Because 3' transductions are potentially mutagenic, we explored the extent to which they occur somatically during tumorigenesis. Studying cancer genomes from 244 patients, we found that tumors from 53% of the patients had somatic retrotranspositions, of which 24% were 3' transductions. Fingerprinting of donor L1s revealed that a handful of source L1 elements in a tumor can spawn from tens to hundreds of 3' transductions, which can themselves seed further retrotranspositions. The activity of individual L1 elements fluctuated during tumor evolution and correlated with L1 promoter hypomethylation. The 3' transductions disseminated genes, exons, and regulatory elements to new locations, most often to heterochromatic regions of the genome.""","""['Jose M C Tubio', 'Yilong Li#', 'Young Seok Ju#', 'Inigo Martincorena', 'Susanna L Cooke', 'Marta Tojo', 'Gunes Gundem', 'Christodoulos P Pipinikas', 'Jorge Zamora', 'Keiran Raine', 'Andrew Menzies', 'Pablo Roman-Garcia', 'Anthony Fullam', 'Moritz Gerstung', 'Adam Shlien', 'Patrick S Tarpey', 'Elli Papaemmanuil', 'Stian Knappskog', 'Peter Van Loo', 'Manasa Ramakrishna', 'Helen R Davies', 'John Marshall', 'David C Wedge', 'Jon W Teague', 'Adam P Butler', 'Serena Nik-Zainal', 'Ludmil Alexandrov', 'Sam Behjati', 'Lucy R Yates', 'Niccolo Bolli', 'Laura Mudie', 'Claire Hardy', 'Sancha Martin', 'Stuart McLaren', ""Sarah O'Meara"", 'Elizabeth Anderson', 'Mark Maddison', 'Stephen Gamble', 'Christopher Foster', 'Anne Y Warren', 'Hayley Whitaker', 'Daniel Brewer', 'Rosalind Eeles', 'Colin Cooper', 'David Neal', 'Andy G Lynch', 'Tapio Visakorpi', 'William B Isaacs', ""Laura Van't Veer"", 'Carlos Caldas', 'Christine Desmedt', 'Christos Sotiriou', 'Sam Aparicio', 'John A Foekens', 'Jórunn Erla Eyfjörd', 'Sunil R Lakhani', 'Gilles Thomas', 'Ola Myklebost', 'Paul N Span', 'Anne-Lise Børresen-Dale', 'Andrea L Richardson', 'Marc Van de Vijver', 'Anne Vincent-Salomon', 'Gert G Van den Eynden', 'Adrienne M Flanagan', 'P Andrew Futreal', 'Sam M Janes', 'G Steven Bova', 'Michael R Stratton', 'Ultan McDermott', 'Peter J Campbell;ICGC Breast Cancer Group;ICGC Bone Cancer Group;ICGC Prostate Cancer Group']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Science""","""['Widespread somatic L1 retrotransposition in normal colorectal epithelium.', 'Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes identifies driver rearrangements promoted by LINE-1 retrotransposition.', 'The Role of Somatic L1 Retrotransposition in Human Cancers.', 'Multiple fates of L1 retrotransposition intermediates in cultured human cells.', 'Biology of mammalian L1 retrotransposons.', 'Transposable elements in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.', ""Comparative analysis of bats and rodents' genomes suggests a relation between non-LTR retrotransposons, cancer incidence, and ageing."", 'Widespread somatic L1 retrotransposition in normal colorectal epithelium.', 'Unscrambling cancer genomes via integrated analysis of structural variation and copy number.', ""LINE-1 retrotransposon expression in cancerous, epithelial and neuronal cells revealed by 5' single-cell RNA-Seq.""]"""

Subsequently detected variations from trial protocol have previously been shown to reduce treatment efficacy, although little has been shown for toxicity rates. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of QA measures and protocol variations on toxicity incidence in the context of a prostate radiotherapy trial.  Methods:   Using QA records from the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial, the impact of variations on gastrointestinal (GI) and genito-urinary (GU) toxicities was investigated.  Results:   Protocol variation rates were lower than reported in previous studies, and showed little correlation with GI toxicity outcomes. Variations classified as 'major' showed a non-significant trend for increased toxicity relative to those classified as 'minor'. Results from a Level III phantom-based dosimetry study showed some correlation with GI toxicity, whereas ranking on a set-up accuracy study did not impact on toxicity. Toxicity in general increased with the number of participants accrued per centre, at odds with previous reports relating to disease progression, with a potential link to increases in low-mid-range rectal doses in the cohort from higher-accruing centres. No QA-related variables correlated with GU toxicities.  Conclusions:   Besides non-significant trends, minimal association was observed between QA variables and toxicity rates for the RADAR trial. The intention of the trial's QA programme was to reduce treatment variations and minimise toxicity in the context of a relevantly advanced treatment approach.""","""['Martin A Ebert', 'Max Bulsara', 'Annette Haworth', 'Rachel Kearvell', 'Sharon Richardson', 'Angel Kennedy', 'Nigel A Spry', 'Sean A Bydder', 'David J Joseph', 'James W Denham']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""[""Quality improvements in prostate radiotherapy: outcomes and impact of comprehensive quality assurance during the TROG 03.04 'RADAR' trial."", 'Quality assurance of the SCOPE 1 trial in oesophageal radiotherapy.', 'Association between measures of treatment quality and disease progression in prostate cancer radiotherapy: An exploratory analysis from the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial.', 'Functional outcomes and complications following radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'Redesigning radiotherapy quality assurance: opportunities to develop an efficient, evidence-based system to support clinical trials--report of the National Cancer Institute Work Group on Radiotherapy Quality Assurance.']"""

Materials and methods:   From 2001-2009, 500 men underwent implantation in Wellington, New Zealand. Men who sustained BF were placed on relapse guidelines that delayed restaging and intervention until the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was ⩾20 ng/mL.  Results:   Most implants (86%) had a prostate D90 of ⩾90%, and multivariate analysis showed that this parameter was not a variable that affected the risk of BF. Of 21 BFs that occurred, the site of failure was discovered to be local in one case and distant in nine cases. Restaging failed to identify the site of relapse in two cases. In nine cases the trigger for restaging had not been reached.  Conclusions:   If post-implant dosimetry is generally within the optimal range, distant rather than local failure appears to be the main cause of BF.

The crude incidence rate was 209.6/105 in 2000, and it increased to 320.20/105 in 2009 (52.8%), with an annual percent change (APC) of 4.51% (95% confidence interval, 3.25%-5.79%). Age-specific incidence rate of 80-84 age group was achieved at the highest point of the incidence curve. Overall with different age groups, the cancer incidences differed, the incidence of liver cancer being highest in 15-44 age group in males; the incidence of breast cancer was the highest in 15-64 age group in females; the incidences of lung cancer were the highest in both males and females over the age of 65 years.

In the absence of good follow-up facilities, it is often difficult to assess the complete prevalence of cancer for a given registry area. An attempt is made to arrive at the complete prevalence including limited duration prevalence with respect of selected sites of cancer for India by fitting appropriate models to 1, 3 and 5 year cancer survival data available for selected registries of India.  Methodology:   Cancer survival data, available for the registries of Bhopal, Chennai, Karunagappally, and Mumbai was pooled to generate survival for the selected cancer sites. With the available data on survival for 1, 3 and 5 years, a model was fitted and the survival curve was extended beyond 5 years (up to 30 years) for each of the selected sites. This helped in generation of survival proportions by single year and thereby survival of cancer cases. With the help of estimated survived cases available year wise and the incidence, the prevalence figures were arrived for selected cancer sites and for selected periods. In our previous paper, we have dealt with the cancer sites of breast, cervix, ovary, lung, stomach and mouth (Takiar and Jayant, 2013).  Results:   The prevalence to incidence ratio (PI ratio) was calculated for 30 years duration for all the selected cancer sites using the model approach showing that from the knowledge of incidence and P/I ratio, the prevalence can be calculated. The validity of the approach was shown in our previous paper (Takiar and Jayant, 2013).

However, the expression and physiological significance of EBP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In the study, we showed that EBP1 was significantly downregulated in clinical HCC specimens, and that decreased expression of EBP1 was associated with enhanced proliferation in HCC cells. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that EBP1 was remarkably downregulated in HCC tissues compared with the adjacent normal ones. The levels of EBP1 were significantly associated with histological grade (P = 0.034), tumor size (P = 0.001), and Ki67 expression (P < 0.001) in HCC specimens. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that EBP1 could serve as an independent prognostic indicator of patients' survival. Serum starvation and refeeding assay indicated that EBP1 was accumulated in growth-arrested HCC cells, and was progressively decreased when cells entered into S phase.

Patients and methods:   From June 2011 to March 2014, 100 patients (median age, 64 years) with negative digital rectal examination underwent repeat transperineal saturation biopsy (SPBx; median, 29 cores) for persistent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values between 4.1 and 10 ng/mL with free/total PSA ≤ 25%. All patients underwent mpMRI using a 3.0-Tesla scanner (ACHIEVA; Philips) equipped with surface 16 channels phased-array coil and lesions suspicious for PCa were submitted to additional targeted biopsies.  Results:   A T1c PCa was found in 37 (37%) of cases; SPBx and mpMRI targeted biopsy diagnosed 34 (34%) and 29 (29%) cancers, missing 3 (all of the anterior zone) and 8 cancers (7 and 1 of the lateral margins and anterior zone, respectively); in detail, mpMRI missed 8 (21.7%) PCa characterized by minimal histological disease at risk for insignificant cancer. The diameter of the mpMRI suspicious lesion was significantly correlated with the diagnosis of PCa with poor Gleason score (P = .005). The detection rate of cancer for each mpMRI core was 40.7%; moreover, mpMRI would have spared 31 (31%) unnecessary SPBx.

Materials and methods:   Prospective inclusion of 50 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer (PCa). All patients received a multi-parametric MRI of the prostate, consisting of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. After prostatectomy, all prostates were prepared as whole-mount step-section slides. For each patient, six lesions were predefined on whole-mount step-sections according to a distinct scheme and the corresponding regions were identified on MRI. Each lesion then was scored on MRI according to PI-RADS by an experienced blinded uro-radiologist and compared with histopathological findings.  Results:   PCa received significant (p < 0.01) higher overall PI-RADS scores (4.10 ± 0.75) compared with benign changes (2.00 ± 0.74). In the peripheral zone, each single modality score showed good diagnostic accuracy for PCa detection (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.90). When combining all single modality scores, an even higher discriminative ability of PCa detection (AUC = 0.97, 95 % CI 0.95-0.99) could be achieved. In contrast, in the transitional zone, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE) showed very low diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.60). Regarding tumor malignancy, no high-grade PCa (Gleason >7a) was present at PI-RADS scores <4 and no Gleason 6 PCa at a PI-RADS score of 5.

Although recent evidence suggests that Notch signaling contributes to bone metastasis in breast and prostate cancer, its role and possible mechanisms in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) bone metastasis are not yet clear. Here, we show that Notch3 is overexpressed in NSCLC bone metastases. The inhibition of Notch3 by small interfering RNA transfection decreased the invasion ability of NSCLC cells and transforming growth factor (TGF)-induced interleukin (IL)-6 and parathyroid hormone-related protein (pTHrP) expression in vitro. We also observed that Notch3 induced a strong morphological transformation, promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays revealed that the forced overexpression of Notch3 induced the expression and activity of ZEB-1 and subsequent suppression of E-cadherin and upregulation of fibronectin, contributing to EMT and invasion. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays showed that RNA interference-mediated ZEB-1 suppression blocked Notch-induced EMT-like transformation and subsequently reversed the observed effects on E-cadherin and downregulated fibronectin. A luciferase reporter system showed that Notch-induced ZEB-1 requires a functional binding site in the ZEB-1 promoter. In vitro invasion assays showed that the inhibition of ZEB-1 can decrease Notch3-promoted invasion and the expression of pTHrP and IL-6.

Given the emerging role of adenosine and other purines in tumor growth and metastasis, this study evaluated the effects of adenosine on the invasion of metastatic prostate and breast cancer cells. Treatment with low micromolar concentrations of adenosine, but not other nucleosides or adenosine receptor agonists, inhibited subsequent cell invasion and migration through Matrigel- and laminin-coated inserts. These inhibitory effects occurred via intrinsic receptor-independent mechanisms, despite the abundant expression of A2B adenosine receptors (ADORA2B). Extracellular nucleotides and adenosine were shown to be rapidly metabolized on tumor cell surfaces via sequential ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73/NT5E) and adenosine deaminase reactions with subsequent cellular uptake of nucleoside metabolites and their intracellular interconversion into ADP/ATP. This was accompanied by concurrent inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase and other signaling pathways. No differences in the proliferation rates, cytoskeleton assembly, expression of major adhesion molecules [integrin-1β (ITGB1), CD44, focal adhesion kinase], and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases were detected between the control and treated cells, thus excluding the contribution of these components of invasion cascade to the inhibitory effects of adenosine. These data provide a novel insight into the ability of adenosine to dampen immune responses and prevent tumor invasion via two different, adenosine receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Current diagnostic tests for prostate cancer have significant problems with both false negatives and false positives, necessitating the search for new molecular markers. A recent investigation of endosomal and lysosomal proteins revealed that the critical process of endosomal biogenesis might be altered in prostate cancer. Here, a panel of endosomal markers was evaluated in prostate cancer and nonmalignant cells and a significant increase in gene and protein expression was found for early, but not late endosomal proteins. There was also a differential distribution of early endosomes, and altered endosomal traffic and signaling of the transferrin receptors (TFRC and TFR2) in prostate cancer cells. These findings support the concept that endosome biogenesis and function are altered in prostate cancer. Microarray analysis of a clinical cohort confirmed the altered endosomal gene expression observed in cultured prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, in prostate cancer patient tissue specimens, the early endosomal marker and adaptor protein APPL1 showed consistently altered basement membrane histology in the vicinity of tumors and concentrated staining within tumor masses. These novel observations on altered early endosome biogenesis provide a new avenue for prostate cancer biomarker investigation and suggest new methods for the early diagnosis and accurate prognosis of prostate cancer.

In one direction, structural variants may cause epigenomic changes in cis. In the other direction, specific local epigenomic states such as DNA hypomethylation associate with local genomic instability.  Methods:   To study these interactions, we have developed several tools and exposed them to the scientific community using the Software-as-a-Service model via the Genboree Workbench. One key tool is Breakout, an algorithm for fast and accurate detection of structural variants from mate pair sequencing data.  Results:   By applying Breakout and other Genboree Workbench tools we map breakpoints in breast and prostate cancer cell lines and tumors, discriminate between polymorphic breakpoints of germline origin and those of somatic origin, and analyze both types of breakpoints in the context of the Human Epigenome Atlas, ENCODE databases, and other sources of epigenomic profiles. We confirm previous findings that genomic instability in human germline associates with hypomethylation of DNA, binding sites of Suz12, a key member of the PRC2 Polycomb complex, and with PRC2-associated histone marks H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. Breakpoints in germline and in breast cancer associate with distal regulatory of active gene transcription. Breast cancer cell lines and tumors show distinct patterns of structural mutability depending on their ER, PR, or HER2 status.

Purpose:   The aim of this study was to investigate whether elderly cancer inpatients well informed about their diagnosis expressed a desire to receive formal psychological help at the start of their cancer treatment. The characteristics of the patients that sought help were examined.  Methods:   This cross-sectional study assessed 650 consecutive cancer inpatients that were 65 years of age and older when they started treatment for breast, colorectal, ovarian, lung, prostate or haematological cancers. Disease-related, medical and psychological characteristics of these patients were assessed using validated tools.  Results:   Distress and cognitive impairment were experienced by 37% and 46% of elderly cancer inpatients, respectively. However, only 12% of patients reported a desire for formal psychological help (14% of women vs 9% of men). The patient characteristics examined were found to be weakly associated with this desire (this explained 16% of the variance for women and 14% for men). For the female subgroup, this desire was associated with age [<75 years vs ≥75 years; odds ratio (OR) = 2.57], marital status (without a partner vs with a partner; OR = 2.26) and distress (OR = 1.13).

Identifications of prostate cancer associated genes and biomarkers are thus essential as they can gain insights into the mechanisms underlying disease progression and advancing for early diagnosis and developing effective therapies.  Methods:   In this study, we presented an integrative analysis of gene expression profiling and protein interaction network at a systematic level to reveal candidate disease-associated genes and biomarkers for prostate cancer progression. At first, we reconstructed the human prostate cancer protein-protein interaction network (HPC-PPIN) and the network was then integrated with the prostate cancer gene expression data to identify modules related to different phases in prostate cancer. At last, the candidate module biomarkers were validated by its predictive ability of prostate cancer progression.  Results:   Different phases-specific modules were identified for prostate cancer. Among these modules, transcription Androgen Receptor (AR) nuclear signaling and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway were shown to be the pathway targets for prostate cancer progression. The identified candidate disease-associated genes showed better predictive ability of prostate cancer progression than those of published biomarkers. In context of functional enrichment analysis, interestingly candidate disease-associated genes were enriched in the nucleus and different functions were encoded for potential transcription factors, for examples key players as AR, Myc, ESR1 and hidden player as Sp1 which was considered as a potential novel biomarker for prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   The successful results on prostate cancer samples demonstrated that the integrative analysis is powerful and useful approach to detect candidate disease-associate genes and modules which can be used as the potential biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.

However, standardized prospective evaluation is limited.  Materials and methods:   A total of 294 consecutive men with suspicion of prostate cancer (186 primary, 108 repeat biopsies) enrolled in 2013 underwent 3T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (T2-weighted, diffusion weighted, dynamic contrast enhanced) without endorectal coil and systematic transperineal cores (median 24) independently of magnetic resonance imaging suspicion and magnetic resonance imaging targeted cores with software registration (median 4). The highest Gleason score from each biopsy method was compared. McNemar's tests were used to evaluate detection rates. Predictors of Gleason score 7 or greater disease were assessed using logistic regression.  Results:   Overall 150 cancers and 86 Gleason score 7 or greater cancers were diagnosed. Systematic, transperineal biopsy missed 18 Gleason score 7 or greater tumors (20.9%) while targeted biopsy did not detect 11 (12.8%). Targeted biopsy of PI-RADS 2-5 alone overlooked 43.8% of Gleason score 6 tumors. McNemar's tests for detection of Gleason score 7 or greater cancers in both modalities were not statistically significant but showed a trend of superiority for targeted primary biopsies (p=0.08). Sampling efficiency was in favor of magnetic resonance imaging targeted prostate biopsy with 46.0% of targeted biopsy vs 7.5% of systematic, transperineal biopsy cores detecting Gleason score 7 or greater cancers. To diagnose 1 Gleason score 7 or greater cancer, 3.4 targeted and 7.4 systematic biopsies were needed. Limiting biopsy to men with PI-RADS 3-5 would have missed 17 Gleason score 7 or greater tumors (19.8%), demonstrating limited magnetic resonance imaging sensitivity. PI-RADS scores, digital rectal examination findings and prostate specific antigen greater than 20 ng/ml were predictors of Gleason score 7 or greater disease.  Conclusions:   Compared to systematic, transperineal biopsy as a reference test, magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy alone detected as many Gleason score 7 or greater tumors while simultaneously mitigating the detection of lower grade disease.

Its function in apoptosis is associated with the proteolytic cleavage to the truncated form tBid, mainly by caspase-8. tBid translocates to mitochondria and assists Bax and Bak in induction of apoptosis. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent alternative processing of Bid to jBid was also reported. We have previously shown that the folate stress enzyme 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (ALDH1L1) activates JNK1 and JNK2 in cancer cells as a pro-apoptotic response. Here we report that in PC-3 prostate cancer cells, JNK1/2 phosphorylate Bid at Thr59 within the caspase cleavage site in response to ALDH1L1. In vitro, all three JNK isoforms, JNK 1-3, phosphorylated Thr59 of Bid with JNK1 being the least active. Thr59 phosphorylation protected Bid from cleavage by caspase-8, resulting in strong accumulation of the full-length protein and its translocation to mitochondria. Interestingly, although we did not observe jBid in response to ALDH1L1 in PC-3 cells, transient expression of Bid mutants lacking the caspase-8 cleavage site resulted in strong accumulation of jBid. Of note, a T59D mutant mimicking constitutive phosphorylation revealed more profound cleavage of Bid to jBid. JNK-driven Bid accumulation had a pro-apoptotic effect in our study: small interfering RNA silencing of either JNK1/2 or Bid prevented Bid phosphorylation and accumulation, and rescued ALDH1L1-expressing cells. As full-length Bid is a weaker apoptogen than tBid, we propose that the phosphorylation of Bid by JNKs, followed by the accumulation of the full-length protein, delays attainment of apoptosis, and allows the cell to evaluate the stress and make a decision regarding the response strategy. This mechanism perhaps can be modified by the alternative cleavage of phospho-T59 Bid to jBid at some conditions.""","""['A Prakasam', 'S Ghose', 'N V Oleinik', 'J R Bethard', 'Y K Peterson', 'N I Krupenko', 'S A Krupenko']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Cleavage by Caspase 8 and Mitochondrial Membrane Association Activate the BH3-only Protein Bid during TRAIL-induced Apoptosis.', 'Involvement of the c-jun N-terminal kinases JNK1 and JNK2 in complement-mediated cell death.', '10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-induced c-Jun-NH2-kinase pathways diverge at the c-Jun-NH2-kinase substrate level in cells with different p53 status.', 'Bcl-2 family member Bfl-1/A1 sequesters truncated bid to inhibit is collaboration with pro-apoptotic Bak or Bax.', 'Bid stands at the crossroad of stress-response pathways.', 'Exploratory Metabolomics Underscores the Folate Enzyme ALDH1L1 as a Regulator of Glycine and Methylation Reactions.', 'Hepatocyte Bcl-3 protects from death-receptor mediated apoptosis and subsequent acute liver failure.', 'Ninjinyoeito ameliorated cigarette smoke extract-induced apoptosis and inflammation through JNK signaling inhibition in human lung fibroblasts.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Knockout of Putative Tumor Suppressor Aldh1l1 in Mice Reprograms Metabolism to Accelerate Growth of Tumors in a Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) Model of Liver Carcinogenesis.']"""

Extensive characterization of the E006AA-hT cell line was accomplished using cytodifferentiation and prostate-specific markers, spectral karyotyping, cell line authentication assays, cell proliferation and migration assays, and in vitro tumorigenesis assays. Spectral karyotyping of E006AA-hT showed a hypertriploid chromosome complement and shared cytogenetic changes similar to its parental cells such as diploid X, absence of Y-chromosomes, numerical gains in chromosomes 5,6,8,10,17,20,21, and marker chromosomes of unknown origin.

In the present study we have examined the in vitro effect of lycopene on these processes.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145 and immortalised normal prostate cell line PNT-2 were used. The adhesion assay consisted of seeding pre-treated cells onto Matrigel™, gently removing non-adherent cells and quantitating the adherent fraction using WST-1. Migratory potential was assessed using ibidi™ migration chamber inserts, in which a cell-free zone between two confluent areas was allowed to populate over time and the migration measured.  Results:   24 hour incubation of prostate cell lines with 1.15µmol/l lycopene showed a 40% reduction of cellular motility in case of PC3 cells, 58% in DU145 cells and no effect was observed for PNT2 cells. A dose related inhibition of cell adhesion to a basement membrane in the form of Matrigel™ was observed in all three cell lines and it reached statistical significance for PC3 and PNT2 cells at lycopene concentrations ≥1.15µmol/l. However, in case of DU145, only a concentration of 2.3µmol/l showed a significant reduction.  Conclusion:   This in vitro investigation indicates that lycopene can influence the cell adhesion and migration properties of cancer cells at a dose which is arguably achievable in patients. The results of our study expand our understanding of a chemo preventive role of lycopene in prostate cancer.""","""['Simone Elgass', 'Alan Cooper', 'Mridula Chopra']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Med Sci""","""['Lycopene inhibits the growth of human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells in vitro and in BALB/c nude mice.', 'Tomato sauce supplementation and prostate cancer: lycopene accumulation and modulation of biomarkers of carcinogenesis.', 'Tomato-based randomized controlled trial in prostate cancer patients: Effect on PSA.', 'Effects of tomato sauce consumption on apoptotic cell death in prostate benign hyperplasia and carcinoma.', 'Role of lycopene and tomato products in prostate health.', 'Effects of Process Parameters on the Quality of Suantang Beef.', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.', 'Can Diet Prevent Urological Cancers?

This case-control study, nested within the Malmö Diet and Cancer Cohort Study, used archived birth record data from 308 incident PRCA cases diagnosed between 1991 and 2005, and 637 age-matched controls among 4781 men born (1923-1945) in Malmö and Lund, Sweden. We applied conditional logistic regression to examine the birth size-PRCA association, including tumour subtypes, adjusting for perinatal and adult factors. Compared with controls, cases had a non-significantly higher mean BW and were more likely to have high (>4000 g) BW (21% v. 18%), but did not differ in other birth size measures, nor in mean adult body mass index . We observed a non-linear association between BW and PRCA risk. Compared with BWs between 3000 and 3500 g (reference), the fully adjusted odds ratios (OR, 95% CI) were 0.55 (0.33-0.91) for <3000 g, 0.86 (0.61-1.22) for 3500-4000 g and 0.98 (0.64-1.50) for >4000 g. Among men with aggressive tumours, the reduction in risk for those with BWs <3000 g (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.72) was stronger than the rate of risk for PRCA overall. Crude risk estimates were minimally attenuated when adjusted for gestational age, maternal age, birth order and adult factors.

Many studies have suggested that SNPs in XRCC4 could be implicated in altering the risk of prostate cancer (PCa). We examined the role of the functional variant (-652T>G) in the XRCC4 promoter in PCa. The transcriptional activity of XRCC4 gene was measured by luciferase assay. We performed real-time PCR/immunohistochemical assay to verify the association between expression level of XRCC4 mRNA/protein and XRCC4 -652T>G polymorphism. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to confirm whether this polymorphism has an effect on binding ability of the transcription factor. We found that the G variant significantly increased the transcription activity of the XRCC4 gene and the binding ability of transcriptional factor GATA-1 to the XRCC4 promoter. Furthermore, the results suggested that the XRCC4 protein and mRNA were overexpressed in individuals who carried the -652G allele compared to carriers of the -652T allele. In addition, the expression of XRCC4 in PCa tissues was lower than in adjacent normal tissues. Our data suggest that the XRCC4 promoter -652G>T polymorphism is functional and may influence genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Using data from the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative clinical registry, we identified 1509 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from March 2012 through June 2013. Clinical data included age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score (GS), clinical trial stage, number of biopsy cores, and bone scan (BS) results. We then fit a multivariate logistic regression model to examine the association between clinical variables and the occurrence of bone metastases. Because some patients did not undergo BS, we used established methods to correct for verification bias and estimate the diagnostic accuracy of published guidelines.  Results:   Among 416 men who received a BS, 48 (11.5%) had evidence of bone metastases. Patients with bone metastases were older, with higher PSA levels and GS (all P <.05). In multivariate analyses, PSA (P <.001) and GS (P = .004) were the only independent predictors of positive BS. Guidelines from the American Urological Association and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network demonstrated similar performance in detecting bone metastases in our population, with fewer negative study results than those of the European Association of Urology guideline. Applying the American Urological Association recommendations (ie, image when PSA level >20 ng/mL or GS ≥ 8) to current clinical practice, we estimate that <1% of positive study results would be missed, whereas the number of negative study results would be reduced by 38%.  Conclusion:   Based on current practice patterns, more uniform application of existing guidelines would ensure that BS is performed for almost all men with bone metastases, while avoiding many negative imaging studies.""","""['Selin Merdan', 'Paul R Womble', 'David C Miller', 'Christine Barnett', 'Zaojun Ye', 'Susan M Linsell', 'James E Montie', 'Brian T Denton']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Prostate cancer: Better use of bone scans in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical predictors and recommendations for staging computed tomography scan among men with prostate cancer.', 'Establishing the pathways and indications for performing isotope bone scans in newly diagnosed intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer - results from a large contemporaneous cohort.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Baseline staging of newly diagnosed prostate cancer: a summary of the literature.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'A Bone Scan Is Valuable for Primary Staging of Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer in a Low-Resource Setting (Nigeria).', 'Raman Spectroscopy in Prostate Cancer: Techniques, Applications and Advancements.', 'The past, present, and future of urological quality improvement collaboratives.', 'Prospective monitoring of imaging guideline adherence by physicians in a surgical collaborative: comparison of statistical process control methods for detecting outlying performance.', 'Cost-consequence analysis of 18F-fluciclovine for the staging of recurrent prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, we aimed to develop an accurate model for predicting PGU among low-risk PCa patients by using exome genotyping.  Methods:   We genotyped 242,221 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s on a custom HumanExome BeadChip v1.0 (Illuminam Inc.) in blood DNA from 257 low risk PCa patients (PSA <10 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason score (GS) ≤6 and clinical stage ≤T2a) who underwent radical prostatectomy. Genetic data were analyzed using an unconditional logistic regression to calculate an odds ratio as an estimate of relative risk of PGU, which defined pathologic GS above 7. Among them, we selected persistent SNPs after multiple testing using FDR method, and we compared accuracies from the multivariate logistic model incorporating clinical factors between included and excluded selected SNP information.  Results:   After analysis of exome genotyping, 15 SNPs were significant to predict PGU in low risk PCa patients. Among them, one SNP--rs33999879 remained significant after multiple testing. When a multivariate model incorporating factors in Epstein definition--PSA density, biopsy GS, positive core number, tumor per core ratio and age was devised for the prediction of PGU, the predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was 78.4% (95%CI: 0.726-0.834). By addition the factor of rs33999879 in aforementioned multivariate model, the predictive accuracy was 82.9%, which was significantly increased (p = 0.0196).

We have generated an oncolytic adenovirus carrying the safety-enhancing E1AΔ24 deletion, the potency-enhancing T1 mutation, and the infectivity-enhancing fiber RGD modification. The results of in vitro cytotoxicity assays on 15 human cancer cell lines derived from different tumor types demonstrated that ORCA-010 is more potent than Ad5-Δ24RGD or ONYX-015. As ORCA-010 will initially be developed for the treatment of prostate cancer, selectivity experiments were performed using primary human prostate cells. ORCA-010 killed cancer cells more effectively than these primary human cells. In both primary prostate fibroblasts and epithelial cells, ORCA-010 was as safe as Ad5-Δ24RGD. Evaluation of ORCA-010 in in vivo xenograft tumor models in nude mice showed that ORCA-010 significantly inhibited growth of prostate, lung, and ovarian tumors and conferred prolonged survival of tumor-bearing animals. Furthermore, we observed a substantial increase in infectious viral particles in tumors injected with ORCA-010. The number of infectious viral particles increased after treatment and infectious particles remained present up to at least 4 weeks posttreatment. Intratumoral virus replication was associated with substantial necrosis and fibrosis. In conclusion, ORCA-010 is more potent than earlier generation oncolytic adenoviruses, without demonstrating increased toxicity.

Objective:   Improve in vivo fluorescence-based SN identification for prostate cancer by optimising hybrid tracer preparation, injection technique, and fluorescence imaging hardware.  Design, setting, and participants:   Forty patients with a Briganti nomogram-based risk >10% of lymph node (LN) metastases were included. After intraprostatic tracer injection, SN mapping was performed (lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT-CT)). In groups 1 and 2, SNs were pursued intraoperatively using a laparoscopic gamma probe followed by fluorescence imaging (FI). In group 3, SNs were initially located via FI. Compared with group 1, in groups 2 and 3, a new tracer formulation was introduced that had a reduced total injected volume (2.0 ml vs. 3.2 ml) but increased particle concentration. For groups 1 and 2, the Tricam SLII with D-Light C laparoscopic FI (LFI) system was used. In group 3, the LFI system was upgraded to an Image 1 HUB HD with D-Light P system.  Intervention:   Hybrid tracer-based SN biopsy, extended pelvic lymph node dissection, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Number and location of the preoperatively identified SNs, in vivo fluorescence-based SN identification rate, tumour status of SNs and LNs, postoperative complications, and biochemical recurrence (BCR).

This provided the rationale for clinical trials of high-dose intravenous ascorbate-based treatment for cancer. A drawback in all the in vitro studies was their failure to take into account the in vivo concentration of iron to supplement cell culture media which are characterized by low iron content. Here we showed, using two prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC-3) and primary astrocytes, that the anticancer/cytotoxic effects of ascorbate are completely abolished by iron at physiological concentrations in cell culture medium and human plasma. A detailed examination of mechanisms showed that iron at physiological concentrations promotes both production and decomposition of H2O2. The latter is mediated by Fenton reaction and prevents H2O2 accumulation. The hydroxyl radical, which is produced in the Fenton reaction, is buffered by extracellular proteins, and could not affect intracellular targets like H2O2. These findings show that anticancer effects of ascorbate have been significantly overestimated in previous in vitro studies, and that common cell culture media might be unsuitable for redox research.""","""['Marija Mojić', 'Jelena Bogdanović Pristov', 'Danijela Maksimović-Ivanić', 'David R Jones', 'Marina Stanić', 'Sanja Mijatović', 'Ivan Spasojević']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Sodium ascorbate kills Candida albicans in vitro via iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction: importance of oxygenation and metabolism.', 'Role of labile iron in the toxicity of pharmacological ascorbate.', 'What if cell culture media do not mimic in vivo redox settings?', ""Iron and redox cycling.

We have demonstrated that T-oligo can induce apoptosis in androgen independent prostate cancer cell line DU-145. In this report, we evaluate the use of star-shaped tetraspermine (SSTS) for delivery of T-oligo.  Methods:   SSTS was synthesized from spermine and its intrinsic cytotoxicity towards DU-145 cells was compared with spermine and branched polyethyleneimine (bPEI). Atomistic molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were conducted to understand binding and complexation of spermine and SSTS with T-oligo. Complexation was also determined using gel electrophoresis and SYBR gold assay. Complexes were characterized for size, cellular uptake and antiproliferative effect.  Results:   SSTS exhibited significantly lower toxicity than spermine and bPEI. Its affinity towards T-oligo was significantly higher than spermine as determined by experimental studies and confirmed by MD simulations and it formed stable complexes (TONPs) with T-oligo. TONPs facilitated cellular uptake and nuclear accumulation of T-oligo and their cytotoxic potential was observed at concentration several folds lower than that required for T-oligo alone.

Methods:   One hundred and ninety patients with localized prostate cancer of clinical stages T1c to T2c were treated by brachytherapy as monotherapy at our institution from February 2009 to July 2013. Nine patients who developed refractory urinary retention and underwent cTURP within six months after brachytherapy were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed.

Patients and methods:   Data was prospectively recorded for all 556 consecutive men who underwent prostate biopsy at our institution as part of the Rapid Access Prostate Assessment Clinic program in Ireland. The estimated probabilities of detecting prostate cancer and high-grade disease were calculated using the PCPT and ERSPC risk calculators. For each calculator the discriminative ability, calibration and clinical utility was assessed.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 49% and high-grade prostate cancer in 34% of men. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the PCPT-RCs outperformed the ERSPC-RCs for the prediction of prostate cancer areas underneath the ROC curve (AUC 0.628 vs. 0.588, p = 0.0034) and for the prediction of high-grade prostate cancer (AUC 0.792 vs. 0.690, p = 0.0029). Both risk calculators generally over-predicted the risk of prostate cancer and high-grade disease across a wide range of predicted probabilities. Decision curve analysis suggested greater net benefit using the PCPT-RCs in this population.  Conclusions:   Multivariable nomograms can further aid patient counselling for early prostate cancer detection. In unscreened men from Western Ireland, the PCPT-RCs provided better discrimination for overall prostate cancer and high-grade disease compared to the ERSPC-RC.

We examined data from three large health plans to evaluate if an increased body mass index (BMI) at prostate cancer diagnosis is related to prostate cancer mortality  Subjects and methods:   This population-based case-control study included 751 men with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. Cases were men who died due to prostate cancer (N=323) and matched controls (N=428). We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess the association between BMI at diagnosis and prostate cancer mortality, adjusted for Gleason score, PSA, tumour characteristics, and matching factors.  Results:   Study subjects were classified into the following BMI (kg/m2) categories: healthy (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9) and obese (≥30). Nearly 43% of the participants had a BMI ≥25 at diagnosis. A higher fraction of cases (30%) were obese compared to controls (22%). Overall, obese men had more than a 50% increase in prostate cancer mortality (adjusted odds ratio=1.50 [95% CI, 1.03-2.19]) when compared to men with healthy BMI. After stratifying by Gleason score, the odds of mortality generally rose with increasing BMI. The strongest effect was observed in the Gleason score 8+ category (2.37, 95% CI: 1.11-5.09).

Owing to the prevalence of bone metastases in mCRPC, obtaining sufficient tumor tissue for analysis has historically been a challenge. In this exploratory analysis, we evaluated imaging, procedural and clinical variables associated with tumor yield on image-guided bone biopsy in men with mCRPC.  Methods:   Clinical data were collected prospectively from men with mCRPC enrolled on a phase II trial with serial metastasis biopsies performed according to standard clinical protocol. Imaging was retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated the percent positive biopsy cores (PPC), calculated as the number of positive cores divided by the total number of cores collected per biopsy.  Results:   Twenty-nine men had 39 bone biopsies. Seventy-seven percent of bone biopsies had at least one positive biopsy core. We determined that lesion size and distance from the skin to the lesion edge correlated with tumor yield on biopsy (median PPC 75% versus 42% for lesions >8.8 cm(3) versus ⩽ 8.8 cm(3), respectively, P=0.05; median PPC 33% versus 71% for distance ⩾ 6.1 versus <6.1 cm, respectively, P = 0.02). There was a trend towards increased tumor yield in patients with increased uptake on radionuclide bone scan, higher calcium levels and shorter duration of osteoclast-targeting therapy, although this was not statistically significant.

However, the methylation status of PCDH17 in prostate cancer and its clinical significance remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation status of PCDH17 and its clinical significance in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.  Material/methods:   The methylation status of PCDH17 in 152 prostate cancer tissues and 51 non-tumoral prostate tissues was examined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Then the association between PCDH17 methylation and clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis were used to analyze the correlation between PCDH17 methylation and prognosis of patients with prostate cancer.  Results:   Our data demonstrated that PCDH17 methylation occurred frequently in prostate cancer. PCDH17 methylation was significantly associated with higher pathological Gleason score (P=0.0315), advanced pathological stage (P=0.0260), higher level of preoperative PSA (P=0.0354), positive angiolymphatic invasion (P=0.0461), positive lymph node metastasis (P=0.0362), and biochemical recurrence (BCR) (P=0.0018). In addition, PCDH17 methylation was an independent predictor of poor biochemical recurrence-free (BCR-free) survival and overall survival for patients with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   PCDH17 methylation is a frequent tumor-specific event in prostate cancer, and is significantly correlated with shorter BCR-free survival and overall survival of patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. PCDH17 methylation in tumor samples after radical prostatectomy may be used as an independent prognostic biomarker.""","""['Ying-Li Lin', 'Pei-Gen Xie', 'Li Wang', 'Jian-Guo Ma']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Aberrant methylation of PCDH10 predicts worse biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Aberrant Protocadherin17 (PCDH17) Methylation in Serum is a Potential Predictor for Recurrence of Early-Stage Prostate Cancer Patients After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Aberrant Promoter Methylation of Protocadherin8 (PCDH8) in Serum is a Potential Prognostic Marker for Low Gleason Score Prostate Cancer.', 'Promoter methylation of protocadherin8 is an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence of early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Aberrant Promoter Methylation of PCDH17 (Protocadherin 17) in Serum and its Clinical Significance in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Genome wide exploration of the methylome in aggressive B-cell lymphoma in Golden Retrievers reveals a conserved hypermethylome.', 'Signature Panel of 11 Methylated mRNAs and 3 Methylated lncRNAs for Prediction of Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Do Protocadherins Show Prognostic Value in the Carcinogenesis of Human Malignant Neoplasms?

The effects of SN-38 treatment on CRC cells with different SLFN11 expression levels were detected, including inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. This study showed that SLFN11 expression varied between the CRC cell lines and high-level SLFN11 expression promoted SN-38-induced antiproliferative activity, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest.

Rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid, hyperoside, rutin and betulinic acid (BA) were isolated from the flower stalks of P. vulgaris var. lilacina Nakai (Labiatae). Among these constituents, UA and BA showed significant antiestrogenic effects, measured as a decrease in the mRNA level of GREB1, an estrogen-responsive protein; the effects of BA were stronger than those of UA. UA and BA were capable of suppressing estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent luciferase activity and expression of estrogen-responsive genes in response to exposure to estradiol, further supporting the suppressive role of these compounds in estrogen-induced signaling. However, neither UA nor BA was capable of suppressing estrogen signaling in cells ectopically overexpressing estrogen receptor α (ERα). Furthermore, both mRNA and protein levels of ERα were reduced by treatment with UA or BA, suggesting that UA and BA inhibit estrogen signaling by suppressing the expression of ERα. Interestingly, both compounds enhanced prostate-specific antigen promoter activity.

However, the predictor of IPI is poorly evaluated.  Objective:   To evaluate the risk factors for IPI into cancer during RP for clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   Between January 1993 and July 2013, 19 986 men with clinically localized PCa underwent RP at our institution. This study includes 14 434 cases that had complete clinicopathologic data. IPI was defined as an iatrogenic incision into the prostate resulting in the presence of malignant glands at the inked surgical margin, regardless of accompanying pathologic features.  Intervention:   Open, retropubic, robot-assisted laparoscopic and pure laparoscopic RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted for risk factors of IPI in RP specimens.  Results and limitations:   The overall incidence of IPI into malignant tissue was noted in 410 (2.8%) cases. In multivariable analysis, obesity, lower prostate weight, surgeon experience, and pure laparoscopic RP were associated with a higher risk of IPI. The odds ratios (OR) for body mass index and prostate weight were 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.08; p<0.001) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-0.99, p<0.001), respectively. The ORs for surgeon experience (>250 cases) and pure laparoscopic RP compared to open RP were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.55-0.90, p=0.005) and 2.05 (95% CI, 1.35-3.11; p=0.001), respectively.  Conclusions:   The risk of IPI during RP is higher in men with obesity and lower prostate weight. In addition, a pure laparoscopic RP and the early series of each surgeon were associated with a higher risk of IPI. However, tumor characteristics were not associated with the IPI occurrence.  Patient summary:   Intraprostatic incision occurrence is associated with obesity, small prostate, and surgeon experience and laparoscopic technique but not Gleason score and tumor stage.""","""['Sung-Woo Park', 'Nathaniel Readal', 'Byong Chang Jeong', 'Elizabeth B Humphreys', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Alan W Partin', 'Misop Han']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Functional and Oncologic Outcomes Between Open and Robotic Radical Prostatectomy at 24-month Follow-up in the Swedish LAPPRO Trial.', 'A multinational, multi-institutional study comparing positive surgical margin rates among 22393 open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Benchmarks for operative outcomes of robotic and open radical prostatectomy: results from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.', 'Prostate Cancer Nonascitic Peritoneal Carcinomatosis After Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: 3 Case Reports and Review of the Literature.', 'Clinicopathological Analysis of the ISUP Grade Group And Other Parameters in Prostate Cancer: Elucidation of Mutual Impact of the Various Parameters.', 'Are you now a good surgeon?

This software calculates the delivered dose distributions in patients by perturbing the calculated dose using errors detected in fluence or planar dose measurements. The device is tested to correlate the gamma passing rate (%GP) and the composite dose predicted by 3DVH software. A total of 28 patients with prostate cancer who were treated with RA were analyzed. RA treatments were delivered to a diode array phantom (ArcCHECK), which was used to create a planned dose perturbation (PDP) file. The 3DVH analysis used the dose differences derived from comparing the measured dose with the treatment planning system (TPS)-calculated doses to perturb the initial TPS-calculated dose. The 3DVH then overlays the resultant dose on the patient's structures using the resultant ""PDP"" beams. Measured dose distributions were compared with the calculated ones using the gamma index (GI) method by applying the global (Van Dyk) normalization and acceptance criteria, i.e., 3%/3mm. Paired differences tests were used to estimate statistical significance of the differences between the composite dose calculated using 3DVH and %GP. Also, statistical correlation by means of logistic regression analysis has been analyzed. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis for patient plans revealed small differences between treatment plan calculations and 3DVH results for organ at risk (OAR), whereas planning target volume (PTV) of the measured plan was systematically higher than that predicted by the TPS. The t-test results between the planned and the estimated DVH values showed that mean values were incomparable (p < 0.05). The quality assurance (QA) gamma analysis 3%/3mm showed that in all cases there were only weak-to-moderate correlations (Pearson r: 0.12 to 0.74). Moreover, clinically relevant differences increased with increasing QA passing rate, indicating that some of the largest dose differences occurred in the cases of high QA passing rates, which may be called ""false negatives."" The clinical importance of any disagreement between the measured and the calculated dose is often difficult to interpret; however, beam errors (either in delivery or in TPS calculation) can affect the effectiveness of the patient dose.

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is significantly elevated in metastatic prostate cancers, which has been mentioned mainly to induce EMT in normal cells. However, there is no description about bFGF induced EMT and its underlying mechanism in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Western blotting, immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR assays were used to study protein or mRNA expression profiles of the EMT. Wound healing scratch, migration and invasion assays were used to test the motility of cells undergoing EMT. More methods were used to explore the underlying mechanisms.  Results:   We demonstrated that bFGF promoted EMT and motility of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Both protein and mRNA expression of Snail were rapidly increased after bFGF treatment. Ectopic expression of Snail triggered EMT and enhanced cell motility in PC-3 cells, and knockdown of Snail almost abolished bFGF induced EMT, suggesting the critical role of Snail. Mechanistic study demonstrated that bFGF promoted the stability, nuclear localization and transcription of Snail by inhibiting the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) through phosphatidylinositide 3 kinases (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway.  Conclusions:   It is concluded that bFGF can promote EMT and motility of PC-3 cells, and AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway controls the stability, localization and transcription of Snail which is crucial for this bFGF induced EMT.

Although evidence clearly demonstrates that BMI1 facilitates the repair of double-stranded breaks via homologous recombination (HR), it remains unclear how BMI1 regulates checkpoint activation during DDR. We report here that BMI1 has a role in G2/M checkpoint activation in response to etoposide (ETOP) treatment. Ectopic expression of BMI1 in MCF7 breast cancer and DU145 prostate cancer cells significantly reduced ETOP-induced G2/M arrest. Conversely, knockdown of BMI1 in both lines enhanced the arrest. Consistent with ETOP-induced activation of the G2/M checkpoints via the ATM pathway, overexpression and knockdown of BMI1, respectively, reduced and enhanced ETOP-induced phosphorylation of ATM at serine 1981 (ATM pS1981). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of ATM targets, including γH2AX, threonine 68 (T68) on CHK2 (CHK2 pT68) and serine 15 (S15) on p53 were decreased in overexpression and increased in knockdown BMI1 cells in response to ETOP. In line with the requirement of NBS1 in ATM activation, we were able to show that BMI1 associates with NBS1 and that this interaction altered the binding of NBS1 with ATM. BMI1 consists of a ring finger (RF), helix-turn-helix-turn-helix-turn (HT), proline/serine (PS) domain and two nuclear localization signals (NLS). Although deletion of either RF or HT did not affect the association of BMI1 with NBS1, the individual deletions of PS and one NLS (KRMK) robustly reduced the interaction. Stable expression of these BMI1 mutants decreased ETOP-induced ATM pS1981 and CHK2 pT68, but not ETOP-elicited γH2AX in MCF7 cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of BMI1 in non-transformed breast epithelial MCF10A cells also compromised ETOP-initiated ATM pS1981 and γH2AX. Taken together, we provide compelling evidence that BMI1 decreases ETOP-induced G2/M checkpoint activation via reducing NBS1-mediated ATM activation.""","""['F Wei', 'D Ojo', 'X Lin', 'N Wong', 'L He', 'J Yan', 'S Xu', 'P Major', 'D Tang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Both ERK1 and ERK2 kinases promote G2/M arrest in etoposide-treated MCF7 cells by facilitating ATM activation.', 'PTEN enhances G2/M arrest in etoposide-treated MCF‑7 cells through activation of the ATM pathway.', 'Etoposide induces G2/M arrest and apoptosis in neural progenitor cells via DNA damage and an ATM/p53-related pathway.', 'A Novel Aspect of Tumorigenesis-BMI1 Functions in Regulating DNA Damage Response.', 'Entrenching role of cell cycle checkpoints and autophagy for maintenance of genomic integrity.', 'Integrated bioinformatics analysis of potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer.', 'A genome-wide enrichment screen identifies NUMA1-loss as a resistance mechanism against mitotic cell-death induced by BMI1 inhibition.', 'Alterations of cell cycle genes in cancer: unmasking the role of cancer stem cells.', 'Assessment of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer (Review).', 'The Contributions of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer Initiation and Metastasis.']"""

To explore whether race-based health disparities exist among men with very low-risk PCa, we evaluated oncologic outcomes of AA men with very low-risk PCa who were candidates for AS but elected to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   We studied 1,801 men (256 AA, 1,473 white men, and 72 others) who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for very low-risk PCa and underwent RP. Presenting characteristics, pathologic data, and cancer recurrence were compared among the groups. Multivariable modeling was performed to assess the association of race with upgrading and adverse pathologic features.  Results:   AA men with very low-risk PCa had more adverse pathologic features at RP and poorer oncologic outcomes. AA men were more likely to experience disease upgrading at prostatectomy (27.3% v 14.4%; P <.001), positive surgical margins (9.8% v 5.9%; P =.02), and higher Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical scoring system (CAPRA-S) scores.

Replacing androgens before progression of the disease is hypothesized to prolong androgen dependence.  Methods:   Men with newly diagnosed, metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, a performance status of 0 to 2, and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 5 ng per milliliter or higher received a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue and an antiandrogen agent for 7 months. We then randomly assigned patients in whom the PSA level fell to 4 ng per milliliter or lower to continuous or intermittent androgen deprivation, with patients stratified according to prior or no prior hormonal therapy, performance status, and extent of disease (minimal or extensive). The coprimary objectives were to assess whether intermittent therapy was noninferior to continuous therapy with respect to survival, with a one-sided test with an upper boundary of the hazard ratio of 1.20, and whether quality of life differed between the groups 3 months after randomization.  Results:   A total of 3040 patients were enrolled, of whom 1535 were included in the analysis: 765 randomly assigned to continuous androgen deprivation and 770 assigned to intermittent androgen deprivation. The median follow-up period was 9.8 years. Median survival was 5.8 years in the continuous-therapy group and 5.1 years in the intermittent-therapy group (hazard ratio for death with intermittent therapy, 1.10; 90% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.23). Intermittent therapy was associated with better erectile function and mental health (P<0.001 and P=0.003, respectively) at month 3 but not thereafter. There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of treatment-related high-grade adverse events.  Conclusions:   Our findings were statistically inconclusive. In patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, the confidence interval for survival exceeded the upper boundary for noninferiority, suggesting that we cannot rule out a 20% greater risk of death with intermittent therapy than with continuous therapy, but too few events occurred to rule out significant inferiority of intermittent therapy. Intermittent therapy resulted in small improvements in quality of life.

The transport of drug in solid tumours involves multiple biophysical and biochemical proc- esses which are strongly dependent on the physicochemical properties of the drug and biological properties of the tumour. Owing to the complexities involved, mathematical models are playing an increasingly important role in identifying the factors leading to inadequate drug delivery to tumours. In this study, a computational model is developed which incorpo- rates real tumour geometry reconstructed from magnetic resonance images, drug transport through the tumour vasculature and interstitium, as well as drug uptake by tumour cells. The effectiveness of anticancer therapy is evaluated based on the percentage of survival tumour cells by directly solving the pharmacodynamics equation using predicted intracellular drug concentrations. Computational simulations are performed for the delivery of doxorubicin through different administration modes and doses. Our predictions show that continuous infusion is far more effective than bolus injection in maintaining high levels of intracellular drug concentration, thereby increasing drug uptake by tumour cells. On the other hand, bolus injection leads to higher extracellular concentration in both tumour and normal tissues compared to continuous infusion, which is undesirable as high drug concentration in normal tissues may increase the risk of associated side effects.""","""['Wenbo Zhan', 'Wladyslaw Gedroyc', 'Xiao Yun Xu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Protein Pept Lett""","""['The effect of tumour size on drug transport and uptake in 3-D tumour models reconstructed from magnetic resonance images.', 'A tumor cord model for doxorubicin delivery and dose optimization in solid tumors.', 'A systematic study of temperature sensitive liposomal delivery of doxorubicin using a mathematical model.', 'Computational modelling of drug delivery to solid tumour: Understanding the interplay between chemotherapeutics and biological system for optimised delivery systems.', 'Critical issues in site-specific targeting of solid tumours: the carrier, the tumour barriers and the bioavailable drug.', 'Multiscale Modelling of Nanoparticle Distribution in a Realistic Tumour Geometry Following Local Injection.', 'Modelling of Nanoparticle Distribution in a Spherical Tumour during and Following Local Injection.', 'Ginsenoside Rh2 pretreatment and withdrawal reactivated the pentose phosphate pathway to ameliorate intracellular redox disturbance and promoted intratumoral penetration of adriamycin.', 'Effects of Focused-Ultrasound-and-Microbubble-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption on Drug Transport under Liposome-Mediated Delivery in Brain Tumour: A Pilot Numerical Simulation Study.', 'Mathematical Modelling of Convection Enhanced Delivery of Carmustine and Paclitaxel for Brain Tumour Therapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   We compared precystectomy transurethral resection biopsy specimens of the prostatic urethra with those of the matched radical cystoprostatectomy in 272 patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. All prostates were evaluated by whole mount step sections.  Results:   Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma was detected by transurethral resection biopsy or radical cystoprostatectomy in 101 patients (37.1%). Transurethral resection biopsy detected urothelial carcinoma in 72 cases with 71.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The overall accuracy of transurethral resection biopsy to detect urothelial carcinoma of the prostate was 89% (positive and negative predictive values 100% and 86%, respectively). Invasive prostatic urothelial carcinoma arising from the prostatic urethra was detected by transurethral resection biopsy in 21 of 26 patients (81%) while prostatic carcinoma in situ was detected in 39 of 52 (75%).

We measured temporal trends in the proportion of patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer who elected noncurative initial treatment in the United States and analyzed the association of factors affecting management choice.  Materials and methods:   We identified 465,591 and 237,257 men diagnosed with low or intermediate risk prostate cancer using NCDB and SEER (2004 to 2010), respectively. We measured the proportion of men who elected noncurative initial treatment and used multivariate logistic regression analysis to evaluate factors affecting the treatment choice.  Results:   During the study period noncurative initial management increased in patients at low risk from 21% to 32% in SEER and from 13% to 20% in NCDB (each p < 0.001). This increase was not reflected in our overall study population (SEER 20% to 22% and NCDB 11% to 13%) since the proportion of patients with Gleason score 6 or less decreased with time (61% to 49% and 61% to 45%, respectively). From 2004 to 2010 older age, lower prostate specific antigen, earlier clinical stage, increased comorbidity index and not being married were associated with a higher likelihood of noncurative initial management (each p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Two independently managed, population based data sets confirmed a temporal increase in noncurative initial management in patients with low risk PCa that did not translate into greater use overall in those at low and intermediate risk combined.

Method:   A group of eleven patients undergoing prostate cancer radiotherapy were imaged with a continuous 3 T cine-MRI in the standard treatment setup position. Four images were recorded every 4 seconds for 15 minutes in the sagittal plane and every 6.5 seconds for 12 minutes in the coronal plane. The prostate gland and seminal vesicles were contoured on each MRI image. The coordinates of the centroid of the prostate and seminal vesicles on each image was analysed for displacement against time. Displacements between the 2.5 percentile and 97.5 percentile (i.e. the 2.5% trimmed range) for prostate and seminal vesicle centroid displacements were measured for 3, 5, 10 and 15 minutes time intervals in the anterior-posterior (AP), left-right (LR) and superior-inferior (SI) directions. Real time prostate and seminal vesicle displacement was compared for individual patients.  Results:   The 2.5% trimmed range for 3, 5, 10 and 15 minutes for the seminal vesicle centroids in the SI direction measured 4.7 mm; 5.8 mm; 6.5 mm and 7.2 mm respectively.

The correlation between the real-time prostate and seminal vesicle displacement varied substantially between patients indicating that the relationship between prostate displacement and seminal vesicles displacement is patient specific with the majority of the patients not having a strong relationship.

CDK11(p58) is also involved in the regulation of steroid receptors, such as androgen and estrogen receptors. We previously found that CDK11(p58) was abnormally expressed in prostate cancer. However, its role in breast cancer remains unclear.  Methods:   CDK11(p58) expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining in a tissue array. A Transwell assay was used to detect invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells. The TaqMan® Metastasis Gene Expression Assay was used to search for potential downstream factors in the CDK11(p58) signaling pathway. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate mRNA levels, and the dual luciferase array was used to analyze promoter activity. Western blotting was used to detect the protein level.  Results:   CDK11(p58) expression was negatively correlated with node status (P = 0.012), relapse status (P = 0.002) and metastasis status (P = 0.023). Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that the disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly poor in breast cancer patients with low CDK11 expression. Interestingly, using the breast cancer cell lines ZR-75-30 and MDA-MB-231, we found that CDK11(p58) was capable of repressing the migration and invasion of ERα-positive breast cancer cells, but not ERα-negative breast cancer cells, in a kinase-dependent manner. Gene expression assays demonstrated that integrin β3 mRNA was dramatically repressed by CDK11(p58), and luciferase results confirmed that the integrin β3 promoter was inhibited by CDK11(p58) through ERα repression. The expression of integrin β3 was highly related to ERα signaling; ERα overexpression stimulated integrin β3 expression, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERα attenuated integrin β3 expression.  Conclusions:   These data indicate that CDK11(p58) is an anti-metastatic gene in ERα-positive breast cancer and that the regulation of integrin β3 by CDK11(p58) via the repression of ERα signaling may constitute part of a signaling pathway underlying breast cancer invasion.""","""['Yayun Chi', 'Sheng Huang', 'Lei Wang', 'Ruoji Zhou', 'Lisha Wang', 'Xiuying Xiao', 'Dali Li', 'Ying Cai', 'Xiaoyan Zhou', 'Jiong Wu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Critical role of CDK11(p58) in human breast cancer growth and angiogenesis.', 'Repression of estrogen receptor alpha by CDK11p58 through promoting its ubiquitin-proteasome degradation.', 'Cyclin D3/CDK11(p58) complex involved in Schwann cells proliferation repression caused by lipopolysaccharide.', 'Interleukin-8 upregulates integrin β3 expression and promotes estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell invasion by activating the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway.', 'Estrogen receptor α dependent regulation of estrogen related receptor β and its role in cell cycle in breast cancer.', 'The Role of CDK Pathway Dysregulation and Its Therapeutic Potential in Soft Tissue Sarcoma.', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDK) and Their Role in Diseases Development-Review.', 'ADAR1 regulates melanoma cell invasiveness by controlling beta3-integrin via microRNA-30 family members.', 'LINC00309 is associated with short disease-free survival in breast cancer.', 'Genome-wide Analysis of Common Copy Number Variation and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Risk.']"""

However, a large proportion of CRPC patients show different extents of docetaxel resistance. The current study aims to investigate the role of testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4) in docetaxel resistance in CRPC. TR4 expression level in prostate biopsy samples from CRPC patients treated with docetaxel was measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Alternation of TR4 expression in prostate cancer (PCa) cell line PC3 was applied to find out the influence of TR4 on half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), cell viability and cell apoptosis. Patients who failed to achieve prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (<50% PSA reduction from baseline) after docetaxel-based chemotherapy had a comparatively higher TR4 expression than those who achieved PSA response (⩾50% PSA reduction from baseline). Knocking down TR4 in PC3 cells led to a lower IC50 dose, poorer cell viability and more cell apoptosis when treated with docetaxel, whereas overexpression of TR4 in PC3 led to a higher IC50 dose, better cell viability and less cell apoptosis. TR4 enhances the chemo-resistance of docetaxel in CRPC.

For all of them, insufficient data on efficacy and safety are available.  Results:   Because of the required long-term follow-up of large sample sizes, conclusive data will not become available in the near future.

Here we present the prospectively defined analyses of some secondary endpoints, including occurrence of skeletal-related events, measures of pain control, and patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL).  Methods:   In this phase 3, double-blind trial, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo orally, stratified by ECOG baseline performance status (0 or 1 vs 2) and mean pain score (Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form [BPI-SF] question 3 worst pain, score ≤3 vs ≥4). Secondary endpoints were time to first skeletal-related event (defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone); change from baseline to week 13 in pain severity and interference; pain palliation and progression at week 13; time to pain progression; overall improvement in HRQoL; improvements in HRQoL domains; and time to HRQoL deterioration. Analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population for each endpoint. AFFIRM is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00974311.  Findings:   Median time to first skeletal-related event in the enzalutamide (n=800) and placebo (n=399) groups was 16·7 months (95% CI 14·6 to 19·1) and 13·3 months (95% CI 9·9 to not yet reached), respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0·69 [95% CI 0·57-0·84]; p=0·0001). Pain progression at week 13 occurred in 174 (28%) of 625 evaluable patients in the enzalutamide group versus 101 (39%) of 259 patients in the placebo group (difference -11·2%, 95% CI -18·1 to -4·3; p=0·0018). Median time to pain progression was not yet reached in the enzalutamide group (95% CI not yet reached to not yet reached) versus 13·8 (13·8 to not yet reached) months in the placebo group (HR 0·56 [95% CI 0·41 to 0·78]; p=0·0004). Mean treatment effects for pain severity (mean change from baseline in the enzalutamide group -0·15, 95% CI -0·28 to -0·02, vs placebo 0·50, 0·29 to 0·70; difference -0·65, 95% CI -0·89 to -0·41; p<0·0001) and interference (-0·01, -0·18 to 0·16, vs 0·74, 0·47 to 1·00; respectively, difference -0·74, 95% -1·06 to -0·43; p<0·0001) were significantly better with enzalutamide than with placebo. 22 (45%) of 49 evaluable patients in the enzalutamide group reported pain palliation at week 13 versus one (7%) of 15 in the placebo group (difference 38·2%, 95% CI 19·4-57·0; p=0·0079). Overall improvement in HRQoL was reported in more patients receiving enzalutamide (275 [42%] of 652) than in those receiving placebo (36 [15%] of 248; p<0·0001). Patients in the enzalutamide group had longer median time to HRQoL deterioration than did those in the placebo group (9·0 months, 95% CI 8·3-11·1, vs 3·7 months, 95% CI 3·0-4·2; HR 0·45, 95% CI 0·37-0·55; p<0·0001) in risk of deterioration.

PCa progresses to an androgen independent phenotype that is incurable. We previously showed that androgen independent, androgen receptor negative (AR(-) ) PCa cell lines have high p62/SQSTM1 levels required for cell survival. We also showed that factors in the HS-5 bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) conditioned medium can upregulate p62 in AR(+) PCa cell lines, leading us to investigate AR expression under those growth conditions. In this paper, mRNA, protein, and subcellular analyses reveal that HS-5 BMSC conditioned medium represses AR mRNA, protein, and nuclear accumulation in the C4-2 PCa cell line. Using published gene expression data, we identify the inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, as a candidate BMSC paracrine factor to regulate AR expression and find that IL-1β is sufficient to both repress AR and upregulate p62 in multiple PCa cell lines. Immunostaining demonstrates that, while the C4-2 population shows a primarily homogeneous response to factors in HS-5 BMSC conditioned medium, IL-1β elicits a strikingly heterogeneous response; suggesting that there are other regulatory factors in the conditioned medium. Finally, while we observe concomitant AR loss and p62 upregulation in IL-1β-treated C4-2 cells, silencing of AR or p62 suggests that IL-1β regulates their protein accumulation through independent pathways. Taken together, these in vitro results suggest that IL-1β can drive PCa progression in an inflammatory microenvironment through AR repression and p62 induction to promote the development and survival of androgen independent PCa.""","""['M A Chang', 'V Patel', 'M Gwede', 'M Morgado', 'K Tomasevich', 'E L Fong', 'M C Farach-Carson', 'Nikki A Delk']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['p62/SQSTM1 is required for cell survival of apoptosis-resistant bone metastatic prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Identification of an IL-1-induced gene expression pattern in AR+ PCa cells that mimics the molecular phenotype of AR- PCa cells.', 'IL-1-conferred gene expression pattern in ERα+ BCa and AR+ PCa cells is intrinsic to ERα- BCa and AR- PCa cells and promotes cell survival.', 'Molecular Origin, Expression Regulation, and Biological Function of Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Megakaryocyte-Derived IL-8 Acts as a Paracrine Factor for Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness through CXCR2 Activation and Antagonistic AR Downregulation.', 'Role of Interleukin-1 family in bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Interleukin-1 and Nuclear Factor Kappa B Signaling Promote Breast Cancer Progression and Treatment Resistance.', 'Chronic IL-1 Exposed AR+ PCa Cell Lines Show Conserved Loss of IL-1 Sensitivity and Evolve Both Conserved and Unique Differential Gene Expression Profiles.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor in Cross Talk Between Stromal Cells and Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   The cohort comprised 108 patients who received radical prostatectomy (RP), were followed by ultrasensitive PSA, and received salvage radiotherapy at a PSA of 0.5 or less. Sixty patients had negative margins, and 48 patients had positive margins at RP. Cox multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with time to secondary PSA failure and included PSA at salvage, year of treatment, Gleason score, ADT use, margin status, T stage, and PSA doubling time. Occurrence of distant metastases was documented.  Results:   Median follow-up after radiation was 63.09 months. A total of 24 patients had a distant metastasis. In all patients, ADT use was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.79; P = .006). On subgroup analysis, ADT was associated with a decreased risk of failure among patients with negative margins (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.12-0.61; P = .002), but not among men with positive margins (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.29-2.10; P = .63).  Conclusions:   Even patients followed with ultrasensitive PSA and salvaged early with a PSA ≤ 0.5 seem to benefit from the addition of ADT to salvage radiation. However, this benefit seemed to be limited to men with negative margins; thus, men with positive margins and PSA ≤ 0.5 may be good candidates for salvage radiation alone.""","""['Arti Parekh', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Powell Graham', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Ariel E Hirsch', 'Mari Nakabayashi', 'Carolyn Evan', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Neil E Martin', 'Paul L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Adjuvant radiation therapy, androgen deprivation, and docetaxel for high-risk prostate cancer postprostatectomy: Results of NRG Oncology/RTOG study 0621.', 'Detectable prostate-specific antigen Nadir during androgen-deprivation therapy predicts adverse prostate cancer-specific outcomes: results from the SEARCH database.', 'Salvage Radiotherapy Versus Hormone Therapy for Prostate-specific Antigen Failure After Radical Prostatectomy: A Randomised, Multicentre, Open-label, Phase 3 Trial (JCOG0401)†.', 'Hormone therapy for radiorecurrent prostate cancer.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Stereotactic Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer in the Adjuvant or Salvage Setting: A Systematic Review.', 'Effect of Salvage Radiotherapy and Endocrine Therapy on Patients with Biochemical Recurrence After Prostate Cancer Operation- a Meta‑Analysis.', 'Regression of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by a Novel Compound HG122.', 'Salvage radiotherapy for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: does the outcome depend on the prostate cancer characteristics?', 'Contemporary role of postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Statin users of three years or more and serum cholesterol levels (SC) were assessed in 2408 men scheduled for prostate biopsy. SC was classified as normal (NSC: <200 mg/dL) or high (HSC: >200 mg/dL). High-grade PCa (HGPCa) was considered if the Gleason score was greater than 7. Statin users comprised 30.9% of those studied. The PCa detection rate was 31.2% of men on statins and 37% of non-statin users (p<0.006). The PCa detection rate was 26.3% in men with NSC and 40.6% in those with HSC (p<0.001). In the subset of NSC men, the PCa rate was 26.5% for statin users and 26.2% for non-users (p=0.939), while in men with HSC, the PCa rate was 36.4% for statin users and 42.0% for non-statin users (p=0.063). The HGPCa rate was 41.8% for statin users and 32.5% for non-users (p=0.012). NSC men had a 53.8% rate of HGPCa, while the rate was only 27.6% in HSC men (p<0.001). NSC men on statins had an HGPCa rate of 70.2%, while non-statin users had a rate of 41.2% (p<0.001). The HGPCa rate for HSC men on statins was 18.8%, while the rate was 30.0% (p=0.011) for non-users. Logistic regression analysis suggested that serum cholesterol levels could serve as an independent predictor of PCa risk, OR 1.87 (95% CI 1.56-2.24) and HGPCa risk, OR 0.31 (95% CI 0.23-0.44), while statin usage could not.

Serum PSA and testosterone concentrations were recorded monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for the second year, and annually then after.  Results:   The mean (range) age was 62 (49-74) years and the mean (range) serum PSA level at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis was 6.2 (2-11.5) ng/mL. The Gleason score was 2 + 3 in one patient, 3 + 3 in 15 patients, 3 + 4 in three patients and 4 + 4 in one patient. In all, 15 men were stage T1c and five were T2a. The mean (range) baseline total testosterone concentration was 343 (200-592) ng/dL, and 6.9 (2.1-9.7) ng/dL for free testosterone. The mean SHIM scores improved with treatment from 16.1 at baseline to 22.1 with TTh (P = 0.002). There was a decrease in mean PSA level from baseline of 0.7 ng/mL before initiation of TTh to 0.1 ng/mL at last follow-up (P < 0.001), with a median (range) follow-up of 31 (12-48) months. There were no cases of prostate cancer progression or recurrence.  Conclusions:   With a median of 31-months follow-up, long-acting testosterone injections in men with prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy produced significant clinical benefits. There were no cases of rising serum PSA, prostate cancer progression or recurrence.""","""['Felipe G Balbontin', 'Sergio A Moreno', 'Enrique Bley', 'Rodrigo Chacon', 'Andres Silva', 'Abraham Morgentaler']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Testosterone replacement for hypogonadism after treatment of early prostate cancer with brachytherapy.', 'Undetectable prostate specific antigen at 6-12 months: a new marker for early success in hormonally treated patients after prostate brachytherapy.', 'Testosterone replacement therapy in the setting of prostate cancer treated with radiation.', 'Ten-year disease free survival after transperineal sonography-guided iodine-125 brachytherapy with or without 45-gray external beam irradiation in the treatment of patients with clinically localized, low to high Gleason grade prostate carcinoma.', 'Diagnosis and Treatment of Testosterone Deficiency: Updated Recommendations From the Lisbon 2018 International Consultation for Sexual Medicine.', 'Testosterone Therapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Editorial Comment: Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and prostate cancer: An updated systematic review with a focus on previous or active localized prostate cancer.', 'Trends in Testosterone Therapy use in Prostate Cancer Survivors in the United States.', 'Hypogonadism and its treatment among prostate cancer survivors.', 'Testosterone Replacement Therapy in Men with Untreated or Treated Prostate Cancer: Do We Have Enough Evidences?']"""

Although the influence of intraoperative fluid management on patients' outcome has been largely discussed in general, its impact on perioperative complications and length of hospitalization in patients undergoing RALP has not been examined so far. We hypothesized that a more restrictive fluid management might lead to a shortened length of hospitalization and a decreased rate of complications in our patients.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of data of 182 patients undergoing RALP at an University Hospital (first series of RALP performed at the center).  Results:   The amount of fluid administered was initially normalized for body mass index of the patient and the duration of the operation and additionally corrected for age and the interaction of these variables. The application of crystalloids (multiple linear regression model, estimate = -0.044, p = 0.734) had no effect on the length of hospitalization, whereas a negative effect was found for colloids (estimate = -8.317, p = 0.021). Additionally, a significant interaction term between age and the amount of colloid applied (estimate = 0.129, p = 0.028) was calculated. Evaluation of the influence of intraoperative fluid administration using multiple logistic regression models corrected for body mass index, duration of the surgery and additionally for age revealed a negative effect of crystalloids on the incidence of an anastomotic leak between bladder and urethra (estimate = -23.860, p = 0.017), with a significant interaction term between age and the amount of crystalloids (estimate = 0.396, p = 0.0134). Colloids had no significant effect on this particular complication (estimate = 1.887, p = 0.524). Intraoperative blood loss did not alter the incidence of an anastomotic leak (estimate = 0.001, p = 0.086), nor did it affect the length of hospitalization (estimate = 0.0001, p = 0.351).  Conclusions:   In accordance to the findings of our study, we suggest that a standardized, more restrictive fluid management might be beneficial in patients undergoing RALP. In older patients this measure would be able to shorten the length of hospitalization and to decrease the incidence of anastomosis leakage as a major complication.""","""['Tobias Piegeler', 'Pamela Dreessen', 'Sereina M Graber', 'Sarah R Haile', 'Daniel Max Schmid', 'Beatrice Beck-Schimmer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Anesthesiol""","""['Positive surgical margin and perioperative complication rates of primary surgical treatments for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing retropubic, laparoscopic, and robotic prostatectomy.', 'Minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: transition from pure laparoscopic to robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of anesthetic management and outcomes of robot-assisted vs pure laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'A retrospective comparison of anesthetic management of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy versus radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Retropubic, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and cumulative analysis of comparative studies.', 'Impact of intraoperative fluid restriction on renal outcomes in patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Effects of Individualised High Positive End-Expiratory Pressure and Crystalloid Administration on Postoperative Pulmonary Function in Patients Undergoing Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Prospective Randomised Single-Blinded Pilot Study.', 'Effects of controlled hypotension with restrictive transfusion on intraoperative blood loss and systemic oxygen metabolism in elderly patients who underwent lumbar fusion.', 'Effect of liberal versus restrictive fluid therapy on intraoperative lactate levels in robot- assisted colorectal surgery.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 304 patients with biopsy-proven GS 3 + 4 PCa who underwent mpMRI before RP. On T2-weighted imaging and three mpMRI combinations (T2-weighted imaging + diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], T2-weighted imaging + dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI [DCE-MRI], and T2-weighted imaging + DWI + DCE-MRI), two radiologists (R1/R2) scored the presence of a dominant tumour using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = definitely absent to 5 = definitely present). Diagnostic performance in identifying downgrading was evaluated via areas under the curves (AUCs). Predictive accuracies of multivariate models were calculated.  Results:   In predicting downgrading, T2-weighted imaging + DWI (AUC = 0.89/0.85 for R1/R2) performed significantly better than T2-weighted imaging alone (AUC = 0.72/0.73; p < 0.001/p = 0.02 for R1/R2), while T2-weighted imaging + DWI + DCE-MRI (AUC = 0.89/0.84 for R1/R2) performed no better than T2-weighted imaging + DWI (p = 0.48/p > 0.99 for R1/R2). On multivariate analysis, the clinical + mpMRI model incorporating T2-weighted imaging + DWI (AUC = 0.92/0.88 for R1/R2) predicted downgrading significantly better than the clinical model (AUC = 0.73; p < 0.001 for R1/R2).  Conclusion:   mpMRI improves the ability to identify a subgroup of patients with Gleason 3 + 4 PCa on biopsy who are candidates for active surveillance. DCE-MRI (compared to T2 + DWI) offered no additional benefit to the prediction of downgrading.  Key points:   Diagnostic performance of T2-weighted-imaging + DWI was better than T2-weighted-imaging alone. Diagnostic performance of T2-weighted-imaging + DWI was similar to T2-weighted-imaging + DWI + DCE-MRI.

Data for 375 consecutive patients were collected prospectively from a single surgeon in an academic institution from 2005 to 2011. Inclusion criteria were 2 years of complete follow-up, preoperative International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scores of ≥ 22 without erectogenic aids and no adjuvant therapy (n = 86).

Univariate analysis demonstrated that higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen, longer apical dissection time and non-nerve-sparing surgery decreased erectile recovery. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that longer apical dissection time remained an independent predictor of decreased erectile function (P < 0.001). In contrast, postoperative intracavernosal injection (ICI) was found to predict erectile recovery (P = 0.017).

PTEN loss was not significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9-5.1, P = 0.10), but significantly predicted increased risk of castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality (all log-rank, P < 0.0001), and time from androgen deprivation therapy to castration-resistant prostate cancer (log-rank, P = 0.003). No patient without PTEN loss developed metastases or died from prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   PTEN loss at the time of biopsy seems to predict time to development of metastasis, prostate cancer-specific mortality and, for the first time, castration-resistant prostate cancer and response to androgen deprivation therapy after radical prostatectomy. If confirmed by larger studies, this would support the use of PTEN loss as an early marker of aggressive prostate cancer.""","""['Prabhakar Mithal', 'Emma Allott', 'Leah Gerber', 'Julia Reid', 'William Welbourn', 'Eliso Tikishvili', 'Jimmy Park', 'Adib Younus', 'Zaina Sangale', 'Jerry S Lanchbury', 'Steven Stone', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Loss of PTEN Expression Detected by Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry Predicts Lethal Prostate Cancer in Men Treated with Prostatectomy.', 'Obesity is associated with castration-resistant disease and metastasis in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy after radical prostatectomy: results from the SEARCH database.', 'Prostate-specific antigen level, stage or Gleason score: which is best for predicting outcomes after radical prostatectomy, and does it vary by the outcome being measured?

Patients and methods:   Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 1998 and 2009, admitted patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and concomitant metastases were identified. Rates of in-hospital mortality, complications, use of imaging and procedures were assessed. Adjusted logistic regression models examined associations of mortality and complications.  Results:   A weighted sample of 534,011 patients with mCaP was identified, including 81.7% weekday and 18.3% weekend admissions. Of these, 8.6% died after a weekday vs 10.9% after a weekend admission (P < 0.001). Patients admitted over the weekend were more likely to be treated at rural (17.8% vs 15.7%), non-teaching (57.6% vs 53.7%) and low-volume hospitals (53.4% vs 49.4%) (all P < 0.001) compared with weekday admissions. They presented higher rates of organ failure (25.2% vs 21.3%), and were less likely to undergo an interventional procedure (10.6% vs 11.4%) (all P < 0.001). More patients admitted over the weekend had pneumonia (12.2% vs 8.8%), pyelonephritis (18.3% vs 14.1%) and sepsis (4.5% vs. 3.5%) (all P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, weekend admission was associated with an increased likelihood of complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% confidence Interval [CI] 1.11-1.19) and mortality (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.14-1.27).

Here, we report the nuclear form of mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (nMET) is essential for CRPC. Specifically, nMET is remarkably increased in human CRPC samples compared with naïve samples. Androgen deprivation induces endogenous nMET and promotes cell proliferation and stem-like cell self-renewal in androgen-nonresponsive PCa cells. Mechanistically, nMET activates SRY (sex determining region Y)-box9, β-catenin, and Nanog homeobox and promotes sphere formation in the absence of androgen stimulus. Combined treatment of MET and β-catenin enhances the inhibition of PCa cell growth. Importantly, MET accumulation is detected in nucleus of recurrent prostate tumors of castrated Pten/Trp53 null mice, whereas MET elevation is predominantly found in membrane of naïve tumors. Our findings reveal for the first time an essential role of nMET association with SOX9/β-catenin in CRPC in vitro and in vivo, highlighting that nuclear RTK activate cell reprogramming to drive recurrence, and targeting nMET would be a new avenue to treat recurrent cancers.""","""['Yingqiu Xie', 'Wenfu Lu', 'Shenji Liu', 'Qing Yang', 'Brett S Carver', 'Estelle Li', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Martin Gleave', 'Zhenbang Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Nuclear MET requires ARF and is inhibited by carbon nanodots through binding to phospho-tyrosine in prostate cancer.', 'Interplay Between SOX9, Wnt/β-Catenin and Androgen Receptor Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Resveratrol inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-mediated androgen receptor signaling and represses tumor progression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of hedgehog and androgen receptor signaling pathways produced synergistic suppression of castration-resistant prostate cancer progression.', 'nMET, A New Target in Recurrent Cancer.', 'Mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition of osteoblasts induced by Fam20c knockout.', 'Proteolytic Cleavage of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases.', 'Evidence for 2-Methoxyestradiol-Mediated Inhibition of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase RON in the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Activation of EPHA2-ROBO1 Heterodimer by SLIT2 Attenuates Non-canonical Signaling and Proliferation in Squamous Cell Carcinomas.', 'Aberrant activation of hepatocyte growth factor/MET signaling promotes β-catenin-mediated prostatic tumorigenesis.']"""

It was originally identified in normal human breast myoepithelial cells and shows variable expression in different types of cancer cells. Maspin displays anti-metastatic properties in mammary and prostate cancer. Its expression is maintained during ovarian, lung and pancreatic carcinogenesis, indicating that Maspin regulated metastatic potential is tissue specific. Thus, it is possible that Maspin participates in salivary gland tumor biology as well. In this study, expression pattern of maspin in benign and malignant salivary gland tumors is analyzed, to understand the biological behavior of salivary gland tumors with respect to maspin expression.  Aims and objectives:   The aim of this study was to demonstrate, record, and correlate the expression pattern of maspin in benign and malignant salivary gland tumors.  Settings and design:   A retrospective study of maspin expression in 30 diagnosed cases of benign and malignant salivary gland tumors retrieved from archives of our department.  Materials and methods:   Anti-maspin antibody and horseradish peroxidase detection system.  Statistical analysis:   Descriptive statistical analysis and Chi-square/Fisher Exact test.  Results:   Intense expression with P < 0.001 is associated with benign tumors, nuclear staining with P < 0.001 is significantly associated with benign tumors and cytoplasmic staining with P = 0.020 is associated with malignant tumors.  Conclusion:   Intensity of expression is more in benign tumors when compared with malignant tumors. The benign tumors showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic expression.

Excluded were patients who had transurethral resection of the prostate, neoadjuvant therapy, clinically advanced cancer, and the first 200 performed cases (to reduce the effect of learning curve). Included were 815 patients who were then divided into three prostate size groups: <31 g (group 1), 31-45 g (group 2), >45 g (group 3). Multivariate analysis determined predictors of PSM and biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   Console time and blood loss increased with increasing prostate size. There were more high-grade tumours in group 1 (group 1 vs group 2 and group 3, 33.9% vs 25.1% and 25.6%, P = 0.003 and P = 0.005).

Emerging fluoroquinolone resistance and selection of multiresistant organisms warrant new prophylactic strategies. Pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid have mutual synergistic activity and the combination of these agents has a broad coverage of the majority of microorganisms causing infectious complications after TRUBP and may be a valuable future prophylactic regimen.  Patients and methods:   This was a retrospective cohort study of 2624 men that underwent TRUBP at a Danish university hospital. The patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 (n = 1220) received ciprofloxacin before TRUBP, Group 2 (n = 240) received a combination of pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid before TRUBP and Group 3 (n = 1161) received an extended prophylaxis with pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid before and for 2 days after TRUBP.  Results:   One hundred and ten out of 148 (74.3%) post-TRUBP infections were caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterococcus faecalis. Group 3 with the extended prophylaxis with pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid had a significantly lower rate of bacteraemia (0.9%) as compared with Group 1 (1.8%) and Group 2 (3.7%). A significant fall in the proportion of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was observed from the period when ciprofloxacin was used as prophylaxis (8.1%) compared with the subsequent period when pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was used (5.9%).

Evaluations of MUs; segments; minimum, maximum, mean target doses; mean normal tissue dose; and conformity index did not demonstrate a significant difference between the modified class solution and the original plans. However, evaluation of healthy tissue conformity index indicated a significant difference. Overall, 70% of the original plans failed to demonstrate a satisfactory score (< 0.6) of properly sparing normal healthy tissue, whereas 70% of the modified plans exhibited a satisfactory score (> 0.6).

Methods:   In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the course of disease of all applicable patients with mCRPC treated with docetaxel followed by abiraterone at our center. We analyzed progression-free survival (PFS) of docetaxel and abiraterone treatments. We further searched for predictive factors for the duration of treatment response.  Results:   Median PFS between initiation of androgen deprivation therapy and the diagnosis of mCRPC was 32 months. Median PFS on docetaxel treatment was 9 months. Median PFS on abiraterone treatment was 11 months. Patients with higher Gleason scores (GS) (8-10) at initial diagnosis had a significantly longer median PFS on docetaxel as compared to patients with GS 6-7, p = 0.01. We demonstrate a significant correlation between the PFS on docetaxel and PFS on abiraterone in the post-docetaxel setting (Kendall tau r = 0.32, p = 0.019) as well as a significant negative correlation between the PSA nadir under abiraterone treatment and the time to progression under abiraterone (Kendall tau r = -0.43, p = 0.007).  Conclusions:   High Gleason score appears to be predictive of duration of response to docetaxel.

Sixty-one men diagnosed with prostate cancer and their wives rated their own subjective physical health and well-being and listed possible selves. Possible selves were reliably coded for the inclusion of the other (i.e., other-focus), either with the other as the subject or communal in content. Regression analysis showed that wives' other-focus, not husbands', explained variance in shared selves. A Bayesian actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) of both partners' other-focus and interaction between the 2 revealed a pattern that differed by partner. The association between husband other-focus and his perceived wellness was negative for husbands whose wives were low in other-focus and not significant for husbands with highly other-focused wives. Women's sense of perceived wellness did not relate to either partner's other-focus. Results support the notion that shared possible selves may be shared unequally in couples facing chronic illness and suggest the importance of considering both partners' other-focus to understand perceived wellness.

Materials and methods:   We evaluated 416 men with prostate cancer on active surveillance who underwent rectal swabs to assess the rate of fluoroquinolone resistance compared to that in men undergoing diagnostic transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. The chi-square test and Student t-test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Poisson regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis.  Results:   On the initial swab fluoroquinolone resistance was found in 95 of 416 men (22.8%) on active surveillance compared to 54 of 221 (24.4%) in the diagnostic biopsy cohort (p = 0.675). Diabetes was found in 4.0% of the fluoroquinolone sensitive group vs 14.7% of the resistant group (p <0.001). Biopsy history was not associated with resistance.

This expression pattern suggests a possible role in PCa initiation and progression. We developed a PSGR transgenic mouse model driven by a probasin promoter and investigated the role of PSGR in prostate malignancy. Overexpression of PSGR induced a chronic inflammatory response that ultimately gave rise to premalignant mouse prostate intraepithelial neoplasia lesions in later stages of life. PSGR-overexpressing LnCaP cells in prostate xenografts formed larger tumors compared with normal LnCaP cancer cells, suggesting a role of PSGR in the promotion of tumor development. Furthermore, we identified nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or RELA as a key downstream target activated by PSGR signaling. We also show that this regulation was mediated in part by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/AKT) pathway, highlighting a collaborative role between PI3K/AKT and NF-κB during tumor inflammation downstream of PSGR in the initial phases of prostate disease.Oncogenesis (2014) 3, e114; doi:10.1038/oncsis.2014.29; published online 11 August 2014.""","""['M Rodriguez', 'W Luo', 'J Weng', 'L Zeng', 'Z Yi', 'S Siwko', 'M Liu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogenesis""","""['New bigenic mouse model increases the understanding of genetic synergism in the progression of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate specific G protein coupled receptor is associated with prostate cancer prognosis and affects cancer cell proliferation and invasion.', 'Increased expression of prostate-specific G-protein-coupled receptor in human prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancers.', 'Prostate-specific G-protein-coupled receptor collaborates with loss of PTEN to promote prostate cancer progression.', 'Prostate-Specific G-Protein Coupled Receptor, an Emerging Biomarker Regulating Inflammation and Prostate Cancer Invasion.', 'Akt in prostate cancer: possible role in androgen-independence.', 'The olfactory receptor OR51E2 activates ERK1/2 through the Golgi-localized Gβγ-PI3Kγ-ARF1 pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'Therapeutic and prognostic potential of GPCRs in prostate cancer from multi-omics landscape.', 'Olfactory receptor 78 is expressed in hypothalamic vasopressin/oxytocin neurons, parenchymal microglia and choroidal macrophages in mice.', 'Odorant receptors in cancer.', 'Olfactory receptor 5B21 drives breast cancer metastasis.']"""

Previous searches for clinical characteristics which could identify a subgroup of patients enriched for mutation carriers revealed early onset and aggressive PrCa as useful parameters, but they are rather unspecific.  Methods:   Identification of BRCA2 mutation carriers by sequencing all exons of BRCA2 in a German cohort of 382 familial PrCa cases and of 92 sporadic PrCa cases with early onset (≤60 years). To define a subgroup of PrCa patients enriched for BRCA2 mutation carriers, we used clinical parameters including a detailed family history (FH) for PrCa and breast cancer.  Results:   Five BRCA2 mutations and ten variants of unknown significance (VUS) were identified. While the VUS were evenly distributed among the groups, mutation carriers were lacking from the sporadic cases and over represented among familial cases with aggressive disease. High prostate specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis (>20 ng/ml) was the only criterion with significant enrichment of mutation carriers (6.4%, P = 0.0005). In men with aggressive disease, death from PrCa (6.3% including FH of lethal PrCa; P = 0.05) and FH of both prostate and breast cancer (4.8%; P = 0.3) increased the frequency of mutation carriers. Larger studies and/or meta-analyses are needed to validate these parameters.  Conclusions:   We have identified three potentially useful criteria, high PSA, death from PrCa (patient or FH), and aggressive PrCa in combination with FH of breast and prostate cancer. If confirmed, they may become useful for the decision which patients may benefit from BRCA2 testing.""","""['Christiane Maier', 'Kathleen Herkommer', 'Manuel Luedeke', 'Antje Rinckleb', 'Mark Schrader', 'Walther Vogel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Interim Results from the IMPACT Study: Evidence for Prostate-specific Antigen Screening in BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.', 'The role of germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair genes in men ascertained for early-onset and/or familial prostate cancer.', 'Targeted prostate cancer screening in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers: results from the initial screening round of the IMPACT study.', 'Implications of High Rates of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.', 'The role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in prostate cancer.', 'Prevalence of Germline BRCA1/2 Variants in Ashkenazi and Non-Ashkenazi Prostate Cancer Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Racial Differences in Prostate Cancer Characteristics and Cancer-Specific Mortality: An Overview.', 'Next-generation sequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Moroccan prostate cancer patients with positive family history.', 'Association between prostate cancer characteristics and BRCA1/2-associated family cancer history in a Japanese cohort.', 'Germline variants in DNA repair genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome: analysis of a 21 gene panel in the Brazilian population.']"""

The serum PSA concentration of each subject was assayed. Potential factors associated with PSA level including age, ethnicity, height, weight, family history of prostate cancer, lower urinary tract voiding symptoms (LUTS), prostate volume and digital rectal examination (DRE) were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analysis.  Results:   There were 38 men (3.6%) found to have a PSA level above 4 ng/ml and 1016 (96.4%) with a healthy PSA (≤4 ng/ml). The median PSA level of Malay, Chinese and Indian men was 1.00 ng/ml, 1.16 ng/ml and 0.83 ng/ml, respectively. Indians had a relatively lower median PSA level and prostate volume than Malays and Chinese, who shared a comparable median PSA value across all 10-years age groups. The PSA density was fairly similar amongst all ethnicities. Further analysis showed that ethnicity, weight and prostate volume were independent factors associated with age specific PSA level in the multivariable analysis (p<0.05).  Conclusion:   These findings support the concept that the baseline PSA level varies between different ethnicities across all age groups.

Methods:   We studied the effect of CD25+ cell depletion and CTLA-4 blockade on the growth of Transgenic Mouse Adenocarcinoma of Prostate (TRAMP)-PSA tumor cells in DR2bxPSA F1 mice. In these mice, immunological tolerance to PSA was established in a context of the HLA-DRB1*1501(DR2b) allele.  Results:   In our model, single administration of anti-CD25 antibody prior to tumor inoculation significantly increased IFN-γ production in response to the CD8 T cell epitope PSA65-73 , and delayed TRAMP-PSA tumor growth compared to mice treated with isotype control antibodies. In contrast, the anti-tumor effect of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody as a monotherapy was marginal. The combinatory treatment with anti-CD25/anti-CTLA-4 antibodies significantly enhanced anti-tumor immunity and caused more profound delay in tumor growth compared to each treatment alone. The proportion of tumor-free animals was higher in the group that received combination treatment (21%) compared to other groups (2-7%). The enhanced anti-tumor immunity in response to the CD25 depletion or CTLA-4 blockade was only seen in the immunogenic TRAMP-PSA tumor model, whereas the effect was completely absent in mice bearing poorly immunogenic TRAMP-C1 tumors.

Methods:   Four prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, DU145, 22Rv1) were assayed for their levels of total Akt and Ser473 phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) by Western Blotting; their growth rates and sensitivity to different doses of paclitaxel were determined by cell counts after Trypan Blue dye exclusion assay. Cells were subjected to different combinations of starvation (growth factors and/or aminoacids withdrawal), paclitaxel treatment and Bcl-2 silencing by siRNA. Cell viability was evaluated by Trypan Blue dye exclusion assay, Propidium Iodide (PI) and Annexin-V/PI staining.  Results:   We assessed the sensitivity of different prostate cancer cell lines to starvation and we observed a differential response correlated to the levels of Akt activation. The four prostate cancer cell lines also showed different sensitivity to taxol treatments; LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells were more resistant to paclitaxel than DU145 and PC3 cells. Combining taxol with growth factors and aminoacids deprivation leaded to a more than additive reduction of cell viability compared to single treatments in PTEN-mutant LNCaP cells. Down-modulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein by siRNA sensitized LNCaP cells to taxanes and starvation induced cell death.

Prostate lesions are known to contain immune cells, which may contribute to the immune control of tumor progression. However, due to their low numbers and restricted access to necessary material it is difficult to isolate immune cells from prostate tissue to characterize their immunological features.  Methods:   An efficient and robust method was developed to process prostate tissue and isolate immune cells for phenotypic analysis by multicolor flow cytometry as downstream application. Fresh prostate tissue from 11 patients undergoing surgery for bladder outlet obstruction due to BPH was processed to evaluate the number, viability, yield, and frequency of various immune cell types.  Results:   The presented method does not include enzymatic digestion nor incubation steps at 37 °C, increasing cellular viability and avoiding possible phenotypic modification. Various immune cell populations were detected in all patient samples and the median cellular viability was 90%. The number of detected events of individual cell populations varied between patients. The median frequency of different immune cell populations also varied, being 87% for the CD3- and 15% for the CD3+ cell population.

EVs contain several RNAs such as mRNA, microRNAs, and ncRNAs, but less is known of their genomic DNA (gDNA) content.

The aim of this study was to analyze whether different prostate cancer (PCa) cell-derived EV subpopulations (apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, and exosomes) carry different gDNA fragments.  Methods:   EV subpopulations were isolated from three PCa cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, and RC92a/hTERT) and the plasma of PCa patients and healthy donors, and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and total protein content. gDNA fragments of different genes were detected by real time quantitative PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Results:   We report that the concentration of EVs was higher in the cancer patients than in the healthy controls. EV subpopulations differed from each other in terms of total protein and DNA content. Analysis of gDNA fragments of MLH1, PTEN, and TP53 genes from the PCa cell-derived EV subpopulations showed that different EVs carried different gDNA content, which could even harbor specific mutations. Altogether, these results suggest that both nucleic acids and proteins are selectively and cell-dependently packed into the EV subtypes.

Six hundred ninety-seven candidate genes were identified based on function, location near a known chromosome 17 linkage signal, and/or previous association with prostate or other cancers.

Likewise, integrin β1 is a known radioprotective factor. Previously, we showed that RAD9 downregulation in human prostate cancer cells reduces integrin β1 protein levels and ectopic expression of Mrad9 restores inherent high levels.  Methods:   We used RNA interference to knockdown Rad9 expression in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells. These cells were then exposed to ionizing radiation, and integrin β1 protein levels were measured by immunoblotting. Survival of irradiated cells was measured by clonogenicity, cell cycle analysis, PARP-1 cleavage, and trypan blue exclusion.  Results:   The function of RAD9 in controlling integrin β1 expression is unique and not shared by the other members of the 9-1-1 complex, HUS1 and RAD1. RAD9 or integrin β1 silencing sensitizes DU145 and PC3 cells to ionizing radiation. Irradiation of DU145 cells with low levels of RAD9 induces cleavage of PARP-1 protein. High levels of ionizing radiation have no effect on integrin β1 protein levels. However, when RAD9 downregulation is combined with 10 Gy of ionizing radiation in DU145 or PC3 cells, there is an additional 50% downregulation of integrin β1 compared with levels in unirradiated RAD9 knockdown cells. Finally, PC3 cells growing on fibronectin display increased radioresistance. However, PC3 cells with RAD9 knockdown are no longer protected by fibronectin after treatment with ionizing radiation.

Initial diagnostic tests indicated organic hypoglycaemia with low serum insulin levels. Insulinoma was excluded and further laboratory tests showed reduced serum insulin-like growth factor-II and normal serum chromogranin A levels as well as normal hypophysis and peripheral hormone values. The authors hypothesised that the severe hypoglycaemia might be the consequence of synthesis and secretion of insulin-like growth factor-II (or its prohormone) by the previously diagnosed prostate tumour. Insulin-like growth factor-II and its prohormone directly increases glucose uptake of the tumour, muscle and adipose tissue, decreases glucose release from the liver and downregulates insulin synthesis due to inhibition of the pancreatic beta cells. The patient required continuous intravenous glucose substitution initially with 5%, subsequently with 20% glucose infusion. Administration of other agents resulted only in temporary improvement. Prostatectomy was again considered but then excluded because of the recurrent hypoglycaemia and the poor general condition of the patient. Hypoglycaemia was finally controlled with glucose and diazoxide therapy, but no improvement in the general condition of the patients was observed and the patient deceased. Immunohistochemistry of the prostate sections showed a carcinoma with strong insulin-like growth factor-II staining, suggesting that insulin-like growth factor-II-secreting prostate tumour caused the severe hypoglycaemia.""","""['János Vadász', 'György Barta', 'Géza Krasznai', 'Fink Ludger', 'Attila Zalatnai']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Orv Hetil""","""['Hepatocellular carcinoma complicated by non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia.', 'Increased levels of circulating free insulin-like growth factors in patients with non-islet cell tumour hypoglycaemia.', 'Inappropriately elevated plasma insulin-like growth factor II in relation to suppressed insulin-like growth factor I in the diagnosis of non-islet cell tumour hypoglycaemia.', 'Non-islet-cell tumour induced hypoglycaemia: a case report and review of literature.', 'Non-islet cell tumour-induced hypoglycaemia: a review of the literature including two new cases.']"""

The mutant proteins that are expressed by mutant genes in cancer cells are secreted into the blood and are useful biomarkers for the early diagnosis of cancer. However, some difficulties exist; for example, the same gene will express different protein mutants in different patients, and early tumors secrete only small amounts of mutant protein. Thus, the presence of mutant proteins in plasma has not previously been exploited for the early diagnosis of cancer. Proximity ligation assay is a protein-detection method that has been developed in recent years and has been widely used because of its high sensitivity. However, this approach still suffers from some shortcomings that should be addressed. In this paper, we develop a covalent-bonding tube-based proximity ligation assay (TB-PLA). The limit of detection of TB-PLA for 0.001pM, and the method exhibited a broad dynamic range of up to seven orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we coupled the conformation-specific antibody PAb240 of p53 mutants to PCR tubes for TB-PLA. The assay was capable of detecting an approximately 500-fold lower concentration of mutant p53 in serum compared with sandwich ELISA. Thus, we demonstrate TB-PLA to be a highly sensitive and effective approach that is suitable for the early clinical diagnosis of cancer using the conformation-specific antibodies of protein mutants.""","""['Xuecheng Jiang', 'Lixiao Zhou', 'Jie Cheng', 'Hua Zhang', 'Huixia Wang', 'Zhixiong Chen', 'Feng Shi', 'Chenggang Zhu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['Proximity ligation assay: an ultrasensitive method for protein quantification and its applications in pathogen detection.', 'Comparison of oligonucleotide-labeled antibody probe assays for prostate-specific antigen detection.', 'The development of an indirect competitive immunomagnetic-proximity ligation assay for small-molecule detection.', 'Sensitive detection of small molecules by competitive immunomagnetic-proximity ligation assay.', 'Protein biomarker validation via proximity ligation assays.', 'One-pot pre-coated interface proximity extension assay for ultrasensitive co-detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and viral RNA.', 'Proximity ligation assay: an ultrasensitive method for protein quantification and its applications in pathogen detection.']"""

This study was carried out to analyse the threshold of PSA for biopsy in symptomatic men in India.  Methods:   From January 2000 to June 2011, consecutive patients who had digital rectal examination (DRE) and PSA testing done for LUTS were included in this study. PSA was done with ELISA technique. Patients with acute or chronic prostatitis, prostatic abscess, history of surgery on prostate within the previous three months and patients on 5α-reductase inhibitors or on urethral catheter were excluded.  Results:   Of the 4702 patients evaluated, 70.9 per cent had PSA of less than 4 ng/ml and 29.1 per cent had PSA of more than 4 ng/ml. Of these, 875 men with a mean age of 65.72±7.4 (range 50-75 yr) had trans rectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guided biopsy. Twenty five men had biopsy at PSA level of <4 ng/ml due to positive DRE, 263 at 4.1-10ng/ml, 156 at 10.1-20 ng/ml and 431 at >20 ng/ml. Positive predictive value of PSA in ranges of 4.1-10, 10.1-20, >20 ng/ml was 15.2, 24 and 62.6 per cent, respectively with negative DRE. PSA cut-off to do biopsy was derived by ROC curve as 5.82 ng/ml for all the men. When the subjects were further stratified on the basis of DRE findings, a cut-off of 5.4 ng/ml was derived in men with normal DRE.  Interpretation & conclusions:   A cut-off for biopsy in symptomatic men with negative DRE could safely be raised to 5.4 ng/ml, which could avoid subjecting 10 per cent of men to undergo unnecessary biopsy.""","""['Shalini Agnihotri', 'R D Mittal', 'R Kapoor', 'Anil Mandhani']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Indian J Med Res""","""['Prostate biopsy for elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA)--Indian perspective.', 'Efficacy of lower cut off value of serum prostate specific antigen in diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'The risks of prostate cancer detection by transrectal ultrasound guide biopsy in Thai men with abnormal prostatic-specific antigen or abnormal digital rectal examination.', 'Free prostate-specific antigen improves prostate cancer detection in a high-risk population of men with a normal total PSA and digitalrectal examination.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Prostate Cancer in Primary Care.', 'Hospital-based prostate cancer screening in vietnamese men with lower urinary tract symptoms: a classification and regression tree model.', 'Raised prostate-specific antigen alone may not be a true predictor in high-risk prostate cancer: A retrospective cohort analysis.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for the detection of prostate cancer in symptomatic patients.', 'Prostate-specific antigen screening of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (opportunistic screening) and of asymptomatic men undergoing executive health check: an audit from two institutions.', 'The Diagnostic Values of Pretreatment Serum Inflammation Markers and Lipoprotein in Men With Total Prostate-Specific Antigen Between 4 and 10 ng/ml.']"""

Here, we explore the hypothesis of transcriptome instability being a general characteristic of cancer.  Results:   Exon-level microarray expression data from ten cancer datasets were analyzed, including breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and prostate cancer (555 samples), as well as paired normal tissue samples from the colon, lung, prostate, and stomach (93 samples). Based on alternative splicing scores across the genomes, we calculated sample-wise relative amounts of aberrant exon skipping and inclusion. Strong and non-random (P < 0.001) correlations between these estimates and the expression levels of splicing factor genes (n = 280) were found in most cancer types analyzed (breast-, cervical-, colorectal-, lung- and prostate cancer). This suggests a biological explanation for the splicing variation. Surprisingly, these associations prevailed in pan-cancer analyses. This is in contrast to the tissue and cancer specific patterns observed in comparisons across healthy tissue samples from the colon, lung, prostate, and stomach, and between paired cancer-normal samples from the same four tissue types.  Conclusion:   Based on exon-level expression profiling and computational analyses of alternative splicing, we propose transcriptome instability as a molecular pan-cancer characteristic. The affected cancers show strong and non-random associations between low expression levels of splicing factor genes, and high amounts of aberrant exon skipping and inclusion, and vice versa, on a genome-wide scale.""","""['Anita Sveen', 'Bjarne Johannessen', 'Manuel R Teixeira', 'Ragnhild A Lothe', 'Rolf I Skotheim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Transcriptome instability in colorectal cancer identified by exon microarray analyses: Associations with splicing factor expression levels and patient survival.', 'TIN: An R Package for Transcriptome Instability Analysis.', 'Comparison of Affymetrix Gene Array with the Exon Array shows potential application for detection of transcript isoform variation.', 'Differentially expressed alternatively spliced genes in malignant pleural mesothelioma identified using massively parallel transcriptome sequencing.', 'Alternative Splicing in the Nuclear Receptor Superfamily Expands Gene Function to Refine Endo-Xenobiotic Metabolism.', 'Alternative RNA Splicing as a Potential Major Source of Untapped Molecular Targets in Precision Oncology and Cancer Disparities.', 'Abnormal RNA splicing and genomic instability after induction of DNMT3A mutations by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.', 'Important molecular genetic markers of colorectal cancer.', 'CLASS2: accurate and efficient splice variant annotation from RNA-seq reads.', 'ELF5 isoform expression is tissue-specific and significantly altered in cancer.']"""

Arrestin2 (Arr2) is a ubiquitous scaffolding/adaptor protein first characterized as a regulator of G protein-coupled receptor signaling. In this study, we report that Arr2 additionally functions as a positive regulator of AR expression and function in PCa cells. Expression level of Arr2 correlates with that of AR, and knockdown of Arr2 inhibits the expression of AR and its effectors prostate-specific antigen, transmembrane protease serine 2, FK506-binding protein 51 and fatty acid synthase. Mechanistically, the knockdown of Arr2 attenuates the binding of AR to androgen response elements and consequently decreases transcription of AR-regulated genes. The inhibition of AR by Arr2 knockdown occurs in both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cells, although the effect is more prominent in CRPC. Arr2 knockdown inhibits the in vitro CRPC cell proliferation, prostasphere growth and invasion, as well as the in vivo prostate tumor formation, local invasion and distant metastasis. These results illustrate a new role for Arr2 in the expression and activation of AR and its potential relevance as a target for therapeutic intervention and monitoring of disease progression.""","""['H T Purayil', 'Y Zhang', 'A Dey', 'Z Gersey', 'L Espana-Serrano', 'Y Daaka']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['β-Arrestin2 Contributes to Cell Viability and Proliferation via the Down-Regulation of FOXO1 in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Nrdp1-mediated regulation of ErbB3 expression by the androgen receptor in androgen-dependent but not castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Estrogen induces androgen-repressed SOX4 expression to promote progression of prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'Role of ARRB1 in prognosis and immunotherapy: A Pan-Cancer analysis.', 'Lysophosphatidic Acid Signaling in Cancer Cells: What Makes LPA So Special?', 'β-Arrestin1 Promotes Colorectal Cancer Metastasis Through GSK-3β/β-Catenin Signaling- Mediated Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Host versus cell-dependent effects of β-arrestin 1 expression in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Nuclear βArrestin1 regulates androgen receptor function in castration resistant prostate cancer.']"""

We provide updated results of mortality from prostate cancer with follow-up to 2010, with analyses truncated at 9, 11, and 13 years.  Methods:   ERSPC is a multicentre, randomised trial with a predefined centralised database, analysis plan, and core age group (55-69 years), which assesses prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in eight European countries. Eligible men aged 50-74 years were identified from population registries and randomly assigned by computer generated random numbers to screening or no intervention (control). Investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality in the core age group. Analysis was by intention to treat. We did a secondary analysis that corrected for selection bias due to non-participation. Only incidence and no mortality data at 9 years' follow-up are reported for the French centres. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN49127736.  Findings:   With data truncated at 13 years of follow-up, 7408 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed in the intervention group and 6107 cases in the control group. The rate ratio of prostate cancer incidence between the intervention and control groups was 1·91 (95% CI 1·83-1·99) after 9 years (1·64 [1·58-1·69] including France), 1·66 (1·60-1·73) after 11 years, and 1·57 (1·51-1·62) after 13 years. The rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality was 0·85 (0·70-1·03) after 9 years, 0·78 (0·66-0·91) after 11 years, and 0·79 (0·69-0·91) at 13 years. The absolute risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 13 years was 0·11 per 1000 person-years or 1·28 per 1000 men randomised, which is equivalent to one prostate cancer death averted per 781 (95% CI 490-1929) men invited for screening or one per 27 (17-66) additional prostate cancer detected. After adjustment for non-participation, the rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality in men screened was 0·73 (95% CI 0·61-0·88).  Interpretation:   In this update the ERSPC confirms a substantial reduction in prostate cancer mortality attributable to testing of PSA, with a substantially increased absolute effect at 13 years compared with findings after 9 and 11 years. Despite our findings, further quantification of harms and their reduction are still considered a prerequisite for the introduction of populated-based screening.

We examined cancer incidence and cancer specific mortality changes among the EE during the implementation of cancer screening from the 1980s to 2000s.  Methods:   We examined incidence and mortality rates for breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancer by age group between 1973 and 2009 in the SEER database. We compared incidence/mortality between EE and middle aged (MA; age 50-69) patients.  Results:   Prostate cancer incidence and mortality rose and then, in the early 1990s, declined (-3.61%/year and -2.91%/year, respectively) among EE. Prostate cancer incidence rose steadily throughout the study period for MA. Breast cancer incidence rose and then declined for both MA and EE, with the decline starting in 1990 for EE (-1.34%/year), and 1998 for MA (-1.24%/year). Both age groups experienced an increase and then decrease in colon cancer incidence. The decrease in colon cancer mortality over the last decade was profound for all patients (-2.88%/year MA, and -3.29%/year EE).

The OVH-driven planning methodology was refined by adding the PTV volume factor to counter the target's dose fall-off effect and incorporated into Multiplan to automate SBRT planning. For validation, automated plans (APs) for 12 new patients were generated, and their achieved dose/volume values were compared to the corresponding manually-created, clinically-delivered plans (CPs).

Objective:   To examine the effect of enzalutamide in patients progressing following taxane-based chemotherapy and abiraterone.  Design, setting, and participants:   Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients entering one of four European compassionate use programmes of enzalutamide.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were association between OS and posttreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics, patient characteristics, and progression-free survival, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard analysis were performed.  Results and limitations:   We identified 137 patients who prior to enzalutamide had progressed following a median of eight cycles of docetaxel and seven courses of abiraterone. The median time on enzalutamide was 3.2 mo; median OS from the time patients started enzalutamide was 8.3 mo (95% confidence interval, 6.8-9.8). Only 45 (38%) and 22 (18%) patients had PSA declines (unconfirmed) >30% and 50%, respectively. Patients who had more than 30% or 50% falls in PSA had improved survival compared with patients who had no such PSA fall (11.4 mo vs 7.1 mo; p=0.001 and 12.6 vs 7.4 mo; p=0.007, respectively). Poor performance status and low haemoglobin was negatively associated with OS.

Objective:   To investigate the role of metastatic phenotype at presentation on mortality in stage IV PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Overall, 3857 patients presenting with metastatic PCa between 1991 and 2009, included in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database were evaluated.  Outcome measurements and statistic analyses:   Overall and cancer-specific survival rates were estimated in the overall population and after stratifying patients according to the metastatic site (lymph node [LN] alone, bone, visceral, or bone plus visceral). Multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the relationship between the site of metastases and survival. All analyses were repeated in a subcohort of patients with a single metastatic site involved.  Results and limitations:   Respectively, 2.8%, 80.2%, 6.1%, and 10.9% of patients presented with LN, bone, visceral, and bone plus visceral metastases at diagnosis. Respective median overall survival and cancer-specific survival were 43 mo and 61 mo for LN metastases, 24 mo and 32 mo for bone metastases, 16 mo and 26 mo for visceral metastases, and 14 mo and 19 mo for bone plus visceral metastases (p<0.001). In multivariable analyses, patients with visceral metastases had a significantly higher risk of overall and cancer-specific mortality versus those with exclusively LN metastases (p<0.001). The unfavorable impact of visceral metastases persisted in the oligometastatic subgroup. Our study is limited by its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   Visceral involvement represents a negative prognostic factor and should be considered as a proxy of more aggressive disease in patients presenting with metastatic PCa. This parameter might indicate the need for additional systemic therapies in these individuals.

Hematogenous metastasis is initiated by intravasation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) into the bloodstream, which are then believed to adhere to the luminal surface of the endothelium and extravasate into distal locations. Apoptotic agents such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), whether in soluble ligand form or expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, have shown promise in treating CTCs to reduce the probability of metastasis. The role of hemodynamic shear forces in altering the cancer cell response to receptor-mediated apoptosis has not been previously investigated. Here, we report that human colon cancer COLO 205 and prostate cancer PC-3 cells exposed to a uniform fluid shear stress in a cone-and-plate viscometer become sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Shear-induced sensitization directly correlated with the application of fluid shear stress, and TRAIL-induced apoptosis increased in a fluid shear stress force- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, TRAIL-induced necrosis was not affected by the application fluid shear stress. Interestingly, fluid shear stress did not sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis when treated with doxorubicin, which also induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Caspase inhibition experiments revealed that shear stress-induced sensitization to TRAIL occurs via caspase-dependent apoptosis. These results suggest that physiological fluid shear force can modulate receptor-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells in the presence of apoptotic agents.""","""['Michael J Mitchell', 'Michael R King']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""New J Phys""","""['Lamin A/C deficiency reduces circulating tumor cell resistance to fluid shear stress.', 'Mass Action Kinetic Model of Apoptosis by TRAIL-Functionalized Leukocytes.', 'Anticancer agents sensitize tumor cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-mediated caspase-8 activation and apoptosis.', 'Utilization of the cellular stress response to sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.', 'Down-regulation of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, particularly c-FLIP by therapeutic agents; the novel view to overcome resistance to TRAIL.', 'Receptor-Ligand Binding: Effect of Mechanical Factors.', 'Chemical Activation and Mechanical Sensitization of Piezo1 Enhance TRAIL-Mediated Apoptosis in Glioblastoma Cells.', 'Current Understanding of Microbiomes in Cancer Metastasis.', 'Matrix stiffness induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via Piezo1-regulated calcium flux in prostate cancer cells.', 'Cancer cells can be killed mechanically or with combinations of cytoskeletal inhibitors.']"""

FOXA1 is an important regulator of prostate development, collaborating with androgen receptor (AR). Post-translational modifications regulating FOXA1 are thus far poorly understood. SUMOylation, post-translational modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins, has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism in transcriptional regulation. In this work, we show by SUMOylation assays in COS-1 cells that the FOXA1 is modified at least in two of its three lysines embedded in SUMOylation consensus, K6 and K389, in proximity to its transactivation domains and K267 proximal to its DNA-binding domain. We also provide evidence for SUMO-2/3 modification of endogenous FOXA1 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assays with mCherry-fused FOXA1 and EGFP-fused AR in HEK293 cells, the presence of FOXA1 retards the nuclear mobility of agonist-bound AR. Interestingly, mutation of the FOXA1 SUMOylation sites slows down the mobility of the pioneer factor, further retarding the nuclear mobility of the AR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression assays suggest that the mutation enhances FOXA1's chromatin occupancy as well as its activity on AR-regulated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) locus in LNCaP cells. Moreover, the mutation altered the ability of FOXA1 to influence proliferation of LNCaP cells. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the SUMOylation can regulate the transcriptional activity of FOXA1 with the AR.""","""['Päivi Sutinen', 'Vesa Rahkama', 'Miia Rytinki', 'Jorma J Palvimo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) reverses the hormone-augmented SUMOylation of androgen receptor and modulates gene responses in prostate cancer cells.', 'NFI transcription factors interact with FOXA1 to regulate prostate-specific gene expression.', 'SUMO ligase PIAS1 functions as a target gene selective androgen receptor coregulator on prostate cancer cell chromatin.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'FOXA1: a transcription factor with parallel functions in development and cancer.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'FOXK2 transcription factor and its roles in tumorigenesis (Review).', 'Dynamic sumoylation of promoter-bound general transcription factors facilitates transcription by RNA polymerase II.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'SUMO and Transcriptional Regulation: The Lessons of Large-Scale Proteomic, Modifomic and Genomic Studies.']"""

The independent impact of VTE, both symptomatic and incidental, on survival in patients with prostate cancer is not known. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the effect of VTE of survival in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data regarding clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of 453 consecutive prostate cancer patients were collected. Fisher exact (categorical variables) and t-test (continuous variables) were utilized to test associations with VTE and mortality. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. A Cox regression model was used to model the mortality hazard ratio (HR).  Results:   At diagnosis, 358 (83%) patients had early stage disease, 43 (10%) had locally advanced disease and 32 (7%) had metastatic disease. During the follow up period, 122 (27%) patients died and 41 (9%) developed VTE (33 deep vein thrombosis, 5 pulmonary embolism, and 3 patients with both DVT and PE). Twenty-five VTE events were symptomatic and 16 were incidentally diagnosed on CT scans obtained for other reasons. VTE was associated with increased mortality [HR 6.89 (4.29-11.08), p<0.001] in a multivariable analysis adjusted for cancer stage, performance status, treatments and co-morbidities. There was no difference in survival between patients who had symptomatic and incidental VTE.

In this work, we sought deeper insights into how NQO1 contributes to prostate carcinogenesis, a setting in which oxidative stress and inflammation are established contributors to disease development and progression. In the TRAMP mouse model of prostate cancer, NQO1 was highly expressed in tumor cells. NQO1 silencing in prostate cancer cells increased levels of nuclear IKKα and NF-κB while decreasing the levels of p53, leading to interactions between NF-κB and p300 that reinforce survival signaling. Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of a set of immune-associated transcripts associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis in cells in which NQO1 was attenuated, with IL8 confirmed functionally in cell culture as one key NQO1-supported cytokine. Notably, NQO1-silenced prostate cancer cells were more resistant to androgen deprivation. Furthermore, NQO1 inhibition increased migration, including under conditions of androgen deprivation. These results reveal a molecular link between NQO1 expression and proinflammatory cytokine signaling in prostate cancer. Furthermore, our results suggest that altering redox homeostasis through NQO1 inhibition might promote androgen-independent cell survival via opposing effects on NF-κB and p53 function.""","""['Dinesh Thapa', 'Peng Meng', 'Roble G Bedolla', 'Robert L Reddick', 'Addanki P Kumar', 'Rita Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Attenuation of NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase 1 aggravates prostate cancer and tumor cell plasticity through enhanced TGFβ signaling.', 'Genetic deletion of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 abrogates activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, IkappaBalpha kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, Akt, p38, and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases and potentiates apoptosis.', 'NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase 1 regulates host susceptibility to ozone via isoprostane generation.', 'Contribution of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 to protection against carcinogenesis, and regulation of its gene by the Nrf2 basic-region leucine zipper and the arylhydrocarbon receptor basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors.', 'NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a multifunctional antioxidant enzyme and exceptionally versatile cytoprotector.', 'Overexpression of miR-17-5p may negatively impact p300/CBP factor-associated inflammation in a hypercholesterolemic advanced prostate cancer model.', 'Sauchinone alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis via NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1/NF-kB pathway and gut microbiota.', 'Transgenic construction and functional miRNA analysis identify the role of miR-7 in prostate cancer suppression.', 'Comprehensive analysis of ferroptosis-related genes and prognosis of cutaneous melanoma.', 'Immunological and prognostic significance of novel ferroptosis-related genes in soft tissue sarcoma.']"""

Collageous ECM extracted from the tails of aged mice exhibits many characteristics of collagen in aged tissues, including the prostate. When polymerized into a 3-dimensional (3D) gel, these collagen extracts can serve as models for the study of specific cell-ECM interactions. In the present study, we examined the behaviors of human prostatic epithelial cell lines representing normal prostate epithelial cells (PEC), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-1), and adenocarcinoma (LNCaP) cultured in contact with 3D gels made from collagen extracts of young and aged mice. We found that proliferation of PEC, BPH-1, and LNCaP cells were all increased by culture on aged collagen gels relative to young collagen gels. In examining age-associated differences in the composition of the collagen extracts, we found that aged and young collagen had a similar amount of several collagen-associated ECM components, but aged collagen had a much greater content of the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) than young collagen. The addition of HA (of similar size and concentration to that found in aged collagen extracts) to cells placed in young collagen elicited significantly increased proliferation in BPH-1 cells, but not in PEC or LNCaP cells, relative to controls not exposed to HA. Of note, histochemical analyses of human prostatic tissues showed significantly higher expression of HA in BPH and prostate cancer stroma relative to stroma of normal prostate. Collectively, these results suggest that changes in ECM involving increased levels of HA contribute to the growth of prostatic epithelium with aging.""","""['Mamatha Damodarasamy', 'Robert B Vernon', 'Christina K Chan', 'Stephen R Plymate', 'Thomas N Wight', 'May J Reed']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim""","""['Regulation of proliferation and differentiation of prostatic stromal cells by oestradiol through prostatic epithelial cells in a paracrine manner.', 'The exosome-like vesicles derived from androgen exposed-prostate stromal cells promote epithelial cells proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'M2a macrophage can rescue proliferation and gene expression of benign prostate hyperplasia epithelial and stroma cells from insulin-like growth factor 1 knockdown.', 'The functional role of reactive stroma in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia: age-related tissue-remodeling.', 'Collagen and Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 Partnership: A Multifaceted Role in the Regulation of Breast Carcinoma Cell Phenotype.', 'Pao Pereira extract suppresses benign prostatic hyperplasia by inhibiting inflammation-associated NFκB signaling.', 'Association Study of Polymorphisms of Epidermal Growth Factor and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in a Korean Population.', 'Type I collagen aging impairs discoidin domain receptor 2-mediated tumor cell growth suppression.', 'Decreased Laminin Expression by Human Lung Epithelial Cells and Fibroblasts Cultured in Acellular Lung Scaffolds from Aged Mice.']"""

Then, we confirmed it by data of six types of other cancer including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, pituitary gonadotrope tumors, ovarian cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Recently, epidermal growth factor (EGF)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling has been shown to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and thereby to promote cancer metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. We demonstrate that EGF can induce EMT in human prostate and lung cancer cells and thus promote invasion and migration. EGF-induced EMT has been characterized by the cells acquiring mesenchymal spindle-like morphology and increasing their expression of N-cadherin and fibronectin, with a concomitant decrease of E-cadherin. Both protein and mRNA expression of transcription factor Snail rapidly increases after EGF treatment. The knockdown of Snail significantly attenuates EGF-induced EMT, suggesting that Snail is crucial for this process. To determine the way that Snail is accumulated, we demonstrate (1) that EGF promotes the stability of Snail via inhibiting the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β), (2) that protein kinase C (PKC) rather than the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway is responsible for GSK-3β inhibition and (3) that GSK-3β inhibition promotes the transcription of Snail. Taken together, these results reveal that the PKC/GSK-3β signaling pathway controls both the stability and transcription of Snail, which is crucial for EMT induced by EGF in PC-3 and A549 cells. Our study suggests a novel signaling pathway for Snail regulation and provides a better understanding of growth-factor-induced tumor EMT and metastasis.""","""['Zong-cai Liu', 'Xiao-hui Chen', 'Hai-xing Song', 'Hong-sheng Wang', 'Ge Zhang', 'Hao Wang', 'Dan-yang Chen', 'Rui Fang', 'Hao Liu', 'Shao-hui Cai', 'Jun Du']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Tissue Res""","""['Stabilization of Snail through AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway is required for TNF-α-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'AKT/GSK-3β regulates stability and transcription of snail which is crucial for bFGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TNF-α requires AKT/GSK-3β-mediated stabilization of snail in colorectal cancer.', 'Role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in cell fate and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer progression: a crucial role for the endothelin axis.', 'Integrating network pharmacology prediction and experimental investigation to verify ginkgetin anti-invasion and metastasis of human lung adenocarcinoma cells via the Akt/GSK-3β/Snail and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'An Overview of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition in Canine Tumors: How Far Have We Come?', 'STE029 Overcomes EGFR-TKI Resistance in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'COL11A1-Driven Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Stemness of Pancreatic Cancer Cells Induce Cell Migration and Invasion by Modulating the AKT/GSK-3β/Snail Pathway.', 'Modified Sijunzi Decoction Inhibits Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer by Attenuating AKT/GSK3β Pathway in vitro and in vivo.']"""

Given the high disease recurrence rate, today, research is more inclined toward exploring causes of recurrence and development, and innovation of modern treatment methods. Several studies have explored over-expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) in prostatic cancer so far, with different results. Thus, it was decided to investigate HER-2/neu overexpression in patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma in Iran.  Materials and methods:   A sample size of 40 patients with prostate cancer entered the study, using a cross-sectional, non-randomized sampling method. Parameters studied included patient age at surgery, Gleason score, serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA) before surgery, and positive sample rate after immunohistochemical staining to investigate HER-2/neu overexpression.  Results:   In terms of HER-2/neu receptor staining rate, of 40 slides, 16 (40%) scored 0, 13 (32.5%) 1+, 7 (17.5%) 2+, and 4 (10%) 3+. In total 27.5% of slides showed HER-2/neu overexpression. In terms of age, an inverse correlation was found (-0.181), but without significance (p=0.263). In terms of serum PSA, the correlation coefficient was 0.449 (p=0.004). With respect to Gleason score, the coefficient was 0.190 (p=0.240).  Conclusions:   In this study, HER-2/neu overexpression occurred in 27.5% of prostate cancer cases, which is a relatively high figure, compared to similar studies elsewhere.

Results:   On RP specimens, 170 anterior (52.5%) and 172 posterior quadrants (53.1%) harboured significant cancer. Negative predictive values of DWI, biopsy, and their combination for significant cancer were 79.7%, 70.6%, and 91.1%, respectively, in anterior quadrants, and 78.5%, 81.3%, and 91.7%, respectively, in posterior quadrants.

Cause of death was obtained from the Mortality Collection by data linkage. Survival for Māori compared with non-Māori men was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusted for age, year of diagnosis, socioeconomic deprivation and rural/urban residence.  Results:   The probability of surviving was significantly lower for Māori compared with non-Māori men at 1, 5 and 10 years after diagnosis. Māori men were more likely to die from any cause [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72-1.97] and from prostate cancer (aHR 1.94, 95% CI 1.76- 2.14). The aHR of prostate cancer death for Māori men diagnosed with regional extent was 2.62-fold (95% CI 1.60-4.31) compared with non-Māori men. The survival gap between Māori and non-Māori men has not changed throughout the study period.  Conclusion:   Māori men had significantly poorer survival than non-Māori, particularly when diagnosed with regional prostate cancer. Despite improvements in survival for all men diagnosed after 2000, the survival gap between Māori and non-Māori men has not been reduced with time. Differences in prostate cancer detection and management, partly driven by higher socioeconomic deprivation in Māori men, were identified as the most likely contributors to ethnic survival disparities in NZ.""","""['Zuzana Obertová', 'Nina Scott', 'Charis Brown', 'Alistair Stewart', 'Ross Lawrenson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Treatment modalities for Māori and New Zealand European men with localised prostate cancer.', 'Differences in survival between Māori and New Zealand Europeans with prostate cancer.', 'Inequalities between Māori and non-Māori men with prostate cancer in Aotearoa New Zealand.', 'The past, present and future of liver cancer control for Māori.', 'Not in my hospital?

Patients and methods:   We analysed cancer registry records for all men diagnosed with prostate cancer in New South Wales (NSW) in 2001-2007 linked to hospital inpatient episodes and deaths. More detailed information on androgen-deprivation therapy and radiotherapy was obtained from medical records for 87 NSW Aboriginal men diagnosed in 2000-2011. The main outcomes were primary treatment for, and death from, prostate cancer. Analysis included Cox proportional hazards regression and logistic regression.  Results:   There were 259 Aboriginal men among 35,214 prostate cancer cases diagnosed in 2001-2007. Age and spread of disease at diagnosis were similar for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal men. Prostate cancer mortality 5 years after diagnosis was higher for Aboriginal men (17.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 12.4-23.3) than non-Aboriginal men (11.4%, 95% CI 11.0-11.8). Aboriginal men were 49% more likely to die from prostate cancer (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.07-1.99) after adjusting for differences in demographic factors, stage at diagnosis, health access and comorbidities. Aboriginal men were less likely to have a prostatectomy for localised or regional cancer than non-Aboriginal men (adjusted odds ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.40-0.91). Of 87 Aboriginal men with full staging and treatment information, 60% were diagnosed with localised disease. Of these, 38% had a prostatectomy (± radiotherapy), 29% had radiotherapy only and 33% had neither.

However CaP treatments mostly target AR signaling which is initially effective but eventually leads to androgen resistance, hence simultaneous targeting of ERs has been proposed. A novel series of molecules were designed with multiple sex-steroid receptor modulating capabilities by coalescing the pharmacophores of known anti-CaP molecules that act via modulation of ER(α/β) and/or AR, viz. 3,3'diindolylmethane (DIM), mifepristone, toremifene, tamoxifen and raloxifene. N,N-diethyl-4-((2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-indol-3-yl)methyl) aniline (DIMA) was identified as the most promising structure of this new series. DIMA increased annexin-V labelling, cell-cycle arrest and caspase-3 activity, and decreased expression of AR and prostate specific antigen in LNCaP cells, in vitro. Concurrently, DIMA increased ER-β, p21 and p27 protein levels in LNCaP cells and exhibited ~5 times more selective binding for ER-β than ER-α, in comparison to raloxifene. DIMA exhibited a dose-dependent ER-β agonism and ER-α antagonism in classical gene reporter assay and decreased hTERT (catalytic subunit of telomerase) transcript levels in LNCaP at 3.0 μM (P<0.05). DIMA also dose-dependently decreased telomerase enzyme activity in prostate cancer cells. It is thus concluded that DIMA acts as a multi-steroid receptor modulator and effectively inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells through ER-β mediated telomerase inhibition, by countering actions of ER-α and AR. Its unique molecular design can serve as a lead structure for generation of potent agents against endocrine malignancies like the CaP.""","""['Vikas Verma', 'Vikas Sharma', 'Vishal Singh', 'Siddharth Sharma', 'Ajay Kumar Bishnoi', 'Vishal Chandra', 'J P Maikhuri', 'Anila Dwivedi', 'Atul Kumar', 'Gopal Gupta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, induces apoptosis in androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP through an androgen-independent pathway.', ""1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(p-substitutedphenyl)methanes inhibit growth, induce apoptosis, and decrease the androgen receptor in LNCaP prostate cancer cells through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-independent pathways."", 'Raloxifene induces cell death and inhibits proliferation through multiple signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells expressing different levels of estrogen receptor α and β.', 'Combinatorial androgen receptor targeted therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Novel anti-prostate cancer curcumin analogues that enhance androgen receptor degradation activity.', 'A Systematic Study of the Impact of Estrogens and Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators on Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation.', 'Metabolic syndrome in prostate cancer: impact on risk and outcomes.']"""

In order to make screening worthwhile, it is necessary to find policies that minimize overdiagnosis, without significantly increasing prostate cancer mortality (PCM). Using a microsimulation model (MISCAN) we project the outcomes of 83 screening policies in the US population, with different start and stop ages, screening frequencies, strategies where the PSA value changes the screening frequency, and strategies in which the PSA threshold (PSAt) increases with age. In the basecase strategy, yearly screening 50-74 with a PSAt of 3, the lifetime risk of PCM and overdiagnosis equals, respectively, 2.4 and 3.8%. The policies that reduce overdiagnosis the most (for maximum PCM increases relative to basecase of 1%, 3%, and 5%, respectively) are with a PSAt of 3, (1) yearly screening 50-74 where, if PSA <1 at age 65 or older, frequency becomes 4 years, with 3.6% (5.9% reduction), (2) 2-year screening 50-72, with 2.9% (24.3% reduction), and (3) yearly screening 50-70 (PSAt of 4 after age 66), with 2.2% (43.4% reduction). Stopping screening at age 70 is a reasonable way to reduce the harms and keep the benefit. Decreasing the stopping age has a larger effect on overdiagnosis reduction than reducing the screen frequency.

Significant upregulation of fibronectin, a mesenchymal EMT marker, was found in post-chemotherapy analysis. A study of the EMT core regulators of SNAIL1, SNAIL2, TWIST1, and a well-known stem cell marker of BMI1 revealed no post-chemotherapy upregulation of these molecules. In contrast, RhoC expression was significantly upregulated in post-chemotherapy breast cancer specimens. MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the constitutive active (CA) RhoC plasmid manifested a reduced level of E-cadherin at the peripheries and disorganization of actin fibers, with no accompanying upregulation of SNAIL1, SNAIL2, TWIST1, or BMI1 in Western blots. Exposure of etoposide on MCF-7 cells showed RhoC upregulation together with reduced membranous expression of E-cadherin and disorganization of actin fibers.

Aim of this exploratory study is to investigate if the sequential administration of Hyaluronic acid (HA) may reduce local side effects of BCG.  Methods:   30 consecutive subjects undergoing BCG intravesical administration for high risk NMIBC were randomized to receive BCG only (Group A) or BCG and HA (Group B). A 1 to 10 Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for bladder pain, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and number of micturitions per day were evaluated in the two groups before and after six weekly BCG instillations. Patients were also evaluated at 3 and 6 months by means of cystostopy and urine cytology.  Results:   One out of 30 (3,3%) patients in group A dropped out from the protocol, for local side effects. Mean VAS for pain was significantly lower in group B after BCG treatment (4.2 vs. 5.8, p = 0.04). Post vs. pre treatment differences in VAS for pain, IPSS and number of daily micturitions were all significantly lower in group B. Three patients in group A and 4 in group B presented with recurrent pathology at 6 month follow up.  Conclusions:   These preliminary data suggest a possible role of HA in reducing BCG local side effects and could be used to design larger randomized controlled trials, assessing safety and efficacy of sequential BCG and HA administration.

However, excessive autophagy could be cytotoxic, contributing to cell death, but its mechanism remains elusive. Arginine starvation has emerged as a potential therapy for several types of cancers, owing to their tumor-selective deficiency of the arginine metabolism. We demonstrated here that arginine depletion by arginine deiminase induces a cytotoxic autophagy in argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1)-deficient prostate cancer cells. Advanced microscopic analyses of arginine-deprived dying cells revealed a novel phenotype with giant autophagosome formation, nucleus membrane rupture, and histone-associated DNA leakage encaptured by autophagosomes, which we shall refer to as chromatin autophagy, or chromatophagy. In addition, nuclear inner membrane (lamin A/C) underwent localized rearrangement and outer membrane (NUP98) partially fused with autophagosome membrane. Further analysis showed that prolonged arginine depletion impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation function and depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production significantly increased in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, presumably leading to DNA damage accumulation. Addition of ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine or knockdown of ATG5 or BECLIN1 attenuated the chromatophagy phenotype. Our data uncover an atypical autophagy-related death pathway and suggest that mitochondrial damage is central to linking arginine starvation and chromatophagy in two distinct cellular compartments.""","""['Chun A Changou', 'Yun-Ru Chen', 'Li Xing', 'Yun Yen', 'Frank Y S Chuang', 'R Holland Cheng', 'Richard J Bold', 'David K Ann', 'Hsing-Jien Kung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Arginine deprivation and autophagic cell death in cancer.', 'Intracellular expression of arginine deiminase activates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by inhibiting cytosolic ferritin and inducing chromatin autophagy.', 'Arginine starvation impairs mitochondrial respiratory function in ASS1-deficient breast cancer cells.', 'Chromatophagy: autophagy goes nuclear and captures broken chromatin during arginine-starvation.', 'Targeted cellular metabolism for cancer chemotherapy with recombinant arginine-degrading enzymes.', 'Bench-to-Bedside Studies of Arginine Deprivation in Cancer.', 'Unlocking the Potential of Arginine Deprivation Therapy: Recent Breakthroughs and Promising Future for Cancer Treatment.', 'Arginine regulates HSPA5/BiP translation through ribosome pausing in triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'A novel combination therapy of arginine deiminase and an arginase inhibitor targeting arginine metabolism in the tumor and immune microenvironment.', 'TRABID inhibition activates cGAS/STING-mediated anti-tumor immunity through mitosis and autophagy dysregulation.', 'Extracellular arginine availability modulates eIF2α O-GlcNAcylation and heme oxygenase 1 translation for cellular homeostasis.']"""

Two types of hypoxia may occur within the tumor mass, chronic (prolonged) and cycling (transient, intermittent) hypoxia. Cycling hypoxia has been shown to induce aggressive tumor cell phenotype and radioresistance more significantly than chronic hypoxia, though little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to delineate the molecular response to both types of hypoxia induced experimentally in tumor cells, with a focus on cycling hypoxia. We analyzed in vitro gene expression profile in three human cancer cell lines (melanoma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer) exposed to experimental chronic or transient hypoxia conditions. As expected, the cell-type specific variability in response to hypoxia was significant. However, the expression of 240 probe sets was altered in all 3 cell lines. We found that gene expression profiles induced by both types of hypoxia were qualitatively similar and strongly depend on the cell type. Cycling hypoxia altered the expression of fewer genes than chronic hypoxia (6,132 vs. 8,635 probe sets, FDR adjusted p<0.05), and with lower fold changes. However, the expression of some of these genes was significantly more affected by cycling hypoxia than by prolonged hypoxia, such as IL8, PLAU, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway-related genes (AREG, HBEGF, and EPHA2). These transcripts were, in most cases, validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Our results indicate that experimental cycling hypoxia exerts similar, although less intense effects, on the examined cancer cell lines than its chronic counterpart. Nonetheless, we identified genes and molecular pathways that seem to be preferentially regulated by cyclic hypoxia.""","""['Magdalena Olbryt', 'Anna Habryka', 'Sebastian Student', 'Michał Jarząb', 'Tomasz Tyszkiewicz', 'Katarzyna Marta Lisowska']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Gene expression profile of B 16(F10) murine melanoma cells exposed to hypoxic conditions in vitro.', 'NADPH oxidase subunit 4 mediates cycling hypoxia-promoted radiation resistance in glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Cycling hypoxia induces a specific amplified inflammatory phenotype in endothelial cells and enhances tumor-promoting inflammation in vivo.', 'Cycling hypoxia: A key feature of the tumor microenvironment.', 'Effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia on gene expression profiles of rat liver: a better understanding of OSA-related liver disease.', 'MAPK Signaling Pathway in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Biological Function and Targeted Therapy.', 'SUBATOMIC: a SUbgraph BAsed mulTi-OMIcs clustering framework to analyze integrated multi-edge networks.', 'CCL18 Expression Is Higher in a Glioblastoma Multiforme Tumor than in the Peritumoral Area and Causes the Migration of Tumor Cells Sensitized by Hypoxia.', 'Chronic and Cycling Hypoxia: Drivers of Cancer Chronic Inflammation through HIF-1 and NF-κB Activation: A Review of the Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Dysregulation of Zinc Finger Protein 395 Contributes to the Pathogenesis of Chondrosarcoma.']"""

TMPRSS2 is expressed highly in localized high-grade prostate cancers and in the majority of human prostate cancer metastases. Through the generation of mouse models with a targeted deletion of Tmprss2, we demonstrate that the activity of this protease regulates cancer cell invasion and metastasis to distant organs. By screening combinatorial peptide libraries, we identified a spectrum of TMPRSS2 substrates that include pro-hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). HGF activated by TMPRSS2 promoted c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and initiated a proinvasive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype. Chemical library screens identified a potent bioavailable TMPRSS2 inhibitor that suppressed prostate cancer metastasis in vivo. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic link between androgen-regulated signaling programs and prostate cancer metastasis that operate via context-dependent interactions with extracellular constituents of the tumor microenvironment.  Significance:   The vast majority of prostate cancer deaths are due to metastasis.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are potent inhibitors of intestinal smooth muscle contraction and have been shown to impact tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract. As such, they have been used in various pain syndromes of the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as chronic anal fissure, to promote healing and improve pain. Here we describe two cases using oral diltiazem for malignancy-associated perineal pain and tenesmus.  Discussion:   The first case describes an elderly male with advanced urothelial cancer post surgical resection and chemoradiation who suffered from rectal pain described as ""sitting on a football"" despite nerve blocks and oral opioids. He experienced dramatic improvement in pain scores and daily requirements of oral analgesics after starting oral diltiazem. The second case describes a middle-aged female with rectal cancer post surgical resection and chemoradiation who suffered from quality-of-life-limiting rectal pain and pressure despite oral opioids. She experienced dramatic improvement in the ""pressure-type"" pain after adding oral diltiazem.

However, questions still remain regarding the influence of gender and role in cancer survivor-partner communication within couples.  Objective:   The current study intended to examine the communication patterns in breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivor-partner couples during cancer survivorship and whether gender and role differences in couples communication exist.  Methods:   The dominant-less dominant method of sequential mixed design was used. Ten couples who were recruited from the University Hospital registry in Cleveland, Ohio, participated in both mail surveys and individual interviews. Family and cancer-related communication was assessed in the quantitative phase.  Results:   Both male survivors and partners demonstrated better family communication scores compared with their female counterparts, whereas there were no gender differences in the cancer-related communication scores. In the qualitative phase, 3 major themes were identified: (1) selective sharing of cancer-related issues, (2) initiation of cancer-related communication, and (3) emotional reaction in communication. The patterns associated with these themes differed between the male survivor-female partner and female survivor-male partner couples.  Conclusions:   This study provides new knowledge about family and cancer-related communication. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding different perspectives in the quality of communication by gender and role.  Implications for practice:   Exploring couples' communication patterns by gender and role stimulates the research and the development of effective consumer-centered communication interventions.

Prostate cancer tends to grow slowly and recent studies suggest that it relies on lipid fuel more than on aerobic glycolysis. However, the biochemical mechanisms governing the relationships between lipid synthesis, lipid utilization, and cancer growth remain unknown. To address the role of lipid metabolism in prostate cancer, we have used etomoxir and orlistat, clinically safe drugs that block lipid oxidation and lipid synthesis/lipolysis, respectively. Etomoxir is an irreversible inhibitor of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) enzyme that decreases β oxidation in the mitochondria. Combinatorial treatments using etomoxir and orlistat resulted in synergistic decreased viability in LNCaP, VCaP, and patient-derived benign and prostate cancer cells. These effects were associated with decreased androgen receptor expression, decreased mTOR signaling, and increased caspase-3 activation. Knockdown of CPT1A enzyme in LNCaP cells resulted in decreased palmitate oxidation but increased sensitivity to etomoxir, with inactivation of AKT kinase and activation of caspase-3. Systemic treatment with etomoxir in nude mice resulted in decreased xenograft growth over 21 days, underscoring the therapeutic potential of blocking lipid catabolism to decrease prostate cancer tumor growth.""","""['Isabel R Schlaepfer', 'Leah Rider', 'Lindsey Ulkus Rodrigues', 'Miguel A Gijón', 'Colton T Pac', 'Lina Romero', 'Adela Cimic', 'S Joseph Sirintrapun', 'L Michael Glodé', 'Robert H Eckel', 'Scott D Cramer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Inhibition of Lipid Oxidation Increases Glucose Metabolism and Enhances 2-Deoxy-2-(18)FFluoro-D-Glucose Uptake in Prostate Cancer Mouse Xenografts.', 'Identifying off-target effects of etomoxir reveals that carnitine palmitoyltransferase I is essential for cancer cell proliferation independent of β-oxidation.', 'Inhibition of fatty acid metabolism reduces human myeloma cells proliferation.', 'Therapeutic potential of CPT I inhibitors: cardiac gene transcription as a target.', 'CPT1A-mediated Fat Oxidation, Mechanisms, and Therapeutic Potential.', 'New Pathway for Cisplatin Prodrug to Utilize Metabolic Substrate Preference to Overcome Cancer Intrinsic Resistance.', 'The Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A Inhibitor Teglicar Shows Promising Antitumour Activity against Canine Mammary Cancer Cells by Inducing Apoptosis.', 'NPRA promotes fatty acid metabolism and proliferation of gastric cancer cells by binding to PPARα.', 'SDPR Inhibits TGF-β Induced Cancer Metastasis Through Fatty Acid Oxidation Regulation in Gastric Cancer.', 'NFYA promotes malignant behavior of triple-negative breast cancer in mice through the regulation of lipid metabolism.']"""

Paclitaxel is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug, whose mechanism of action is related to its ability to arrest cells in mitosis and the subsequent induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. By using two prostate cancer cell lines with different responses to paclitaxel treatment, we have identified two situations in which PTTG1 influences cell fate differentially. In slippage-prone PC3 cells, both PTTG1 downregulation and overexpression induce an increase in mitotic cells that is associated with diminished apoptosis after paclitaxel treatment. In LNCaP cells, however, PTTG1 downregulation prevents mitotic entry and, subsequently, inhibits mitosis-associated, paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. In contrast, PTTG1 overexpression induces an increase in mitotic cells and apoptosis after paclitaxel treatment. We have also identified a role for Mcl-1 protein in preventing apoptosis during mitosis in PC3 cells, as simultaneous PTTG1 and Mcl-1 silencing enhances mitosis-associated apoptosis after paclitaxel treatment. The finding that a more efficient mitotic arrest alone in PC3 cells is not enough to increase apoptosis was also confirmed with the observation that a selected paclitaxel-resistant PC3 cell line showed an apoptosis-resistant phenotype associated with increased mitosis upon paclitaxel treatment.

In this retrospective analysis, data from 107 newly diagnosed patients (from November 1995 to April 2008) with advanced prostate adenocarcinoma receiving Leuprorelin acetate depot were analyzed. Data was collected from the computerized registry of two collaborating medical centers in Taiwan. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between potential predictive parameters and BCP. Univariate analysis revealed that predictors of BCP included (1) initial serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.00); (2) log of initial PSA (HR, 1.35; 95% CI 1.17-1.56); (3) PSA density at diagnosis (HR, 1.00; 95% CI 1.00-1.01), and (4) pathological bone fracture (HR, 2.22; 95% CI 1.20-4.11). Age (HR, 0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.98) and hemoglobin levels (HR, 0.86; 95% CI 0.76-0.97) were also associated with greater risk of BCP. After adjusting for age, pathologic fracture, and hemoglobin level, the initial PSA and PSA density were no longer significantly associated with BCP. However, age and hemoglobin levels continued to be associated with greater risk of BCP (P ≤ 0.007). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with higher initial PSA concentration, pathological bone fracture, and low hemoglobin had a greater probability of BCP. Thus, low hemoglobin and age are predictive indicators of BCP and therefore early indicators of BCP despite ADT therapy.""","""['Chien-Hua Chen', 'Ju-Ton Hsieh', 'Kuo-How Huang', 'Yeong-Shiau Pu', 'Hong-Chiang Chang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Rapidly decreasing level of prostate-specific antigen during initial androgen deprivation therapy is a risk factor for early progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer: A retrospective study.', 'Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Prostate-specific antigen doubling time predicts response to deferred antiandrogen therapy in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Short-term androgen-deprivation therapy improves prostate cancer-specific mortality in intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients undergoing dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Using medical claims database to develop a population disease progression model for leuprorelin-treated subjects with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Alternatively activated macrophages are associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in prostate adenocarcinoma.']"""

Therefore, strategies to increase its anti-tumor efficacy and decrease its side effects are critically needed. Targeting of the constitutive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cancer cells is being investigated as a chemosensitization approach. We hypothesized that the simultaneous induction of ER-stress and suppression of PI3K/AKT survival pathway will be a more effective approach. In a CRPC cell line, C4-2B, we observed significant (p<0.005) enhancement of DTX-induced cytotoxicity following coexposure to thapsigargin and an AKT-inhibitor. However, since these two agents are not clinically approved, we investigated whether a combination of nelfinavir (NFR) and curcumin (CUR), known to target both these metabolic pathways, can similarly increase DTX cytotoxicity in CRPC cells. Within 24 hrs post-exposure to physiologic concentrations of NFR (5 µM) and CUR (5 µM) a significantly (p<0.005) enhanced cytotoxicity was evident with low concentration of DTX (10 nM). This 3-drug combination rapidly increased apoptosis in aggressive C4-2B cells, but not in RWPE-1 cells or in primary prostate epithelial cells (PrEC). Comparative molecular studies revealed that this 3-drug combination caused a more pronounced suppression of phosphorylated-AKT and higher induction in phosphorylated-eIF2α in C4-2B cells, as compared to RWPE-1 cells. Acute exposure (3-9 hrs) to this 3-drug combination intensified ER-stress induced pro-apoptotic markers, i.e. ATF4, CHOP, and TRIB3. At much lower concentrations, chronic (3 wks) exposures to these three agents drastically reduced colony forming units (CFU) by C4-2B cells. In vivo studies using mice containing C4-2B tumor xenografts showed significant (p<0.05) enhancement of DTX's (10 mg/kg) anti-tumor efficacy following coexposure to NFR (20 mg/kg) & CUR (100 mg/kg). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of tumor sections indicated decreased Ki-67 staining and increased TUNEL intensity in mice exposed to the 3-drug combination. Therefore, subverting ER-stress towards apoptosis using adjuvant therapy with NFR and CUR can chemosensitize the CRPC cells to DTX therapy.""","""['Aditi Mathur', 'Zakaria Y Abd Elmageed', 'Xichun Liu', 'Mikhail L Kostochka', 'Haitao Zhang', 'Asim B Abdel-Mageed', 'Debasis Mondal']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Corosolic acid, a natural triterpenoid, induces ER stress-dependent apoptosis in human castration resistant prostate cancer cells via activation of IRE-1/JNK, PERK/CHOP and TRIB3.', 'Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 sensitizes docetaxel in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeted nanomedicine for prostate cancer therapy: docetaxel and curcumin co-encapsulated lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles for the enhanced anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo.', 'Additive naftopidil treatment synergizes docetaxel-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Curcumin: reclaiming the lost ground against cancer resistance.', 'Oxidative stress and redox signaling in CRPC progression: therapeutic potential of clinically-tested Nrf2-activators.', 'Pre-Exposure to Stress-Inducing Agents Increase the Anticancer Efficacy of Focused Ultrasound against Aggressive Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Nelfinavir Induces Cytotoxicity towards High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Cells, Involving Induction of the Unfolded Protein Response, Modulation of Protein Synthesis, DNA Damage, Lysosomal Impairment, and Potentiation of Toxicity Caused by Proteasome Inhibition.', 'Curcumin induces apoptosis and inhibits the growth of adrenocortical carcinoma: Identification of potential candidate genes and pathways by transcriptome analysis.']"""

Methods:   195 patients with an elevated PSA level were enrolled in the study. A novel 5-grading score of prostate outer gland was applied by TRTE imaging. Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were performed to assess the diagnostic performance of TRTE score.  Results:   TRTE scores in patients with PCA and benign condition were 3.20 ± 1.11 (range: 1-5) and 2.24 ± 1.01 (range: 1-4), respectively (P < 0.001). The best cutoff value of TRTE score was 3, and the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy in the diagnosis were 68.6% (35/51), 69.4% (100/144) and 69.2% (135/195), respectively. The accuracy of TRTE in volume ≤ 30 ml group was significantly higher than that in the volume ≥ 50 ml group and the 30-50 ml group (76.9% vs. 65.0% and 76.9% vs. 71.4%, both P < 0.001).

Methods:   We retrospectively studied 11 patients' clinical data of the above.  Results:   The ratio of males to females was 4:7, and the average age was 49.2 years (range, 18-74 years). Cervical vertebra (5; 38.5%) and thoracic vertebra (5; 38.5%) were the most frequent site followed by the lumbar vertebra (3; 23%). Pain was the main symptom except case 2 who were diagnosed accidently because of prostate cancer. The mean delay from first clinical symptoms to diagnosis was ranged from 2 months to 20 years. MRI showed all BNCTs were osteolytic lesions with hypointense on T1-weighted sequences, hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences. There were 4 vertebral bodies with wedge fracture. There were two cases that had two noncontiguous vertebral bodies with BNCT. In histology, marrow replacement was noted by multivacuolated physaliphorous cells immunoreactive for CK, EMA and S100 protein. All 10 cases except case 2 had vertebral reconstruction and fixation with different methods. Of the 11 patients, 9 had full follow-up data which showed no evidence of recurrence or metastasis without further treatment.  Conclusion:   Noncontiguous multi-centricity BNCTs are rare. No specific vertebrae are more frequently involved. Once BNCT is diagnosed by pathology, the surgical intervention is necessary for the patients with obvious clinical symptoms although it is benign.

Ultrasound was used in continuous wave mode at a frequency of 21 kHz and with a spatial-average temporal-average intensity of 46 mW/cm2. Ultrasound combined with microbubbles (200 μl; SonoVue) was administered to androgen-independent human PCa PC-3 cells for 30 sec. The PC-3 cells were divided into three groups: The control group, the ultrasound group (US) and the ultrasound combined with microbubbles group (US + MB). Following treatment for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, cell counting kit-8 was used to assess cell viability. Cell invasion and migration was measured 12 h after treatment using Transwell migration assays. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to evaluate the expression of the migration-associated proteins, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Cell reproduction levels in the US and US + MB groups were significantly suppressed when compared with the control group (P<0.01) following 24 h of treatment and this suppression was significantly higher in the US + MB group than in the US group (P<0.01). However, no significant differences in cell reproduction levels between the three groups were identified at 12 h (P>0.05). Ultrasound combined with microbubbles significantly suppressed the level of invasion and migration in the PC-3 cells compared with the control group (190.83±14.63 vs. 509.67±18.62, P<0.01; and 86.67±10.60 vs. 271.33±65.14; P<0.01, respectively).

Results:   Among 58 cases with solid organ carcinoma metastasis in bone marrow, mean age was 59.9. Thirty-nine cases were found to have a known primary tumor focus. The most common tumors metastasized to bone marrow were breast carcinomas (23 patients, 59%), gastric carcinomas (6 patients, 15.3%), prostate carcinomas (4 patients, 10,2%), and lung carcinomas (3 patients, 7.7%), respectively. Nineteen patients were firstly diagnosed from bone marrow biopsies as metastatic carcinomas. The median overall survival after bone marrow metastasis was 28 days (95% confidence interval: 7.5-48.4). The median overall survival difference was not statistically significant between patients with primary known and unknown tumor (P = 0.973). Statistically significant difference was observed between the survival of breast cancer and gastric cancer (P = 0.028). The most common hematologic symptom was the coexistence of anemia and thrombocytopenia (31%), thrombocytopenia (27.6%) and anemia (20.7%) alone. The median overall survival difference was statistically significant between patients who have anemia and thrombocytopenia (P < 0.005).

Recent studies have shown that NOR1 expression is lower in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate tissue. However, the specific function and exact mechanism of NOR1 in prostate cancer remains to be clarified. The present study aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of NOR1 in prostate cancer PC3 cells. DU145 and PC3 cells were transduced with a vector and cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis were determined. As predicted, NOR1 overexpression significantly inhibited growth and apoptosis in PC3 cells. NOR1 overexpression decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and increased the level of the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and Bak in PC3 cells. Further investigation demonstrated that NOR1 overexpression activates caspase-3. Silencing of NOR1 did not inhibit growth or induce apoptosis in PC3 cells. Moreover, NOR1 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis via the activation of MAPK. The overexpression of NOR1 significantly inhibited tumor growth in PC3 tumor-bearing nude mice. The results suggest that the upregulated NOR1 expression was able to inhibit the progression of prostate cancer. Thus, NOR1 may be an ideal target for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Zhongjie Shan', 'Qinglan Hou', 'Nan Zhang', 'Liang Guo', 'Xinheng Zhang', 'Yaohui Ma', 'Yudong Zhou']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Overexpression of oxidored-nitro domain containing protein 1 inhibits human nasopharyngeal carcinoma and cervical cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis: Involvement of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.', 'Tumor suppressor gene Oxidored-nitro domain-containing protein 1 regulates nasopharyngeal cancer cell autophagy, metabolism, and apoptosis in vitro.', 'Extended survivability of prostate cancer cells in the absence of trophic factors: increased proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, and the role of apoptosis proteins.', 'The NOR1/OSCP1 proteins in cancer: from epigenetic silencing to functional characterization of a novel tumor suppressor.', 'Cell proliferation and apoptosis in prostate cancer: significance in disease progression and therapy.', 'The critical role of circular RNAs in drug resistance in gastrointestinal cancers.', 'Function of Nr4a Orphan Nuclear Receptors in Proliferation, Apoptosis and Fuel Utilization Across Tissues.', 'CircRNA_101505 sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma cells to cisplatin by sponging miR-103 and promotes oxidored-nitro domain-containing protein 1 expression.', 'CiliaCarta: An integrated and validated compendium of ciliary genes.', 'Induction of Different Apoptosis Pathways by Two Proteus mirabilis Clinical Isolates Strains in Prostatic Epithelial Cells.']"""

Conventional dish-based co-culture assays simply mix two cell types in the same dish; thus, they are deficient in controlling cell locations and precisely tracking single cell behavior from heterogeneous cell populations. Microfluidic technology can provide a good spatial-temporal control of microenvironments, but the control has been typically realized by using external pumps, making long-term cultures cumbersome and bulky. In this work, we have presented a cell-cell interaction microfluidic platform that can accurately control the co-culture microenvironment by using a novel electrolytic cell isolation scheme without using any valves or pneumatic pumps. The proposed microfluidic platform can also precisely control the number of interacting cells and pairing ratios to emulate cancer niches. More than 80% of the chambers captured the desired number of cells. The duration of cell isolation can be adjusted by electrolytic bubble generation and removal. We have verified that the electrolytic process has a negligible effect on cell viability and proliferation in our platform. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to incorporate electrolytic bubble generation as a cell isolation method in microfluidics. For proof of feasibility, we have performed cell-cell interaction assays between prostate cancer (PC3) cells and myoblast (C2C12) cells. The preliminary results demonstrated the potential of using electrolysis for micro-environmental control during cell culture. Also, the ratio controlled cell-cell interaction assays were successfully performed which showed that the cell pairing ratios of PC3 to C2C12 affected the proliferation rate of myoblast cells due to increased secretion of growth factors from prostate cancer cells.""","""['Yu-Chih Chen', 'Patrick Ingram', 'Euisik Yoon']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Paired single cell co-culture microenvironments isolated by two-phase flow with continuous nutrient renewal.', 'Single cell dual adherent-suspension co-culture micro-environment for studying tumor-stromal interactions with functionally selected cancer stem-like cells.', 'A microfluidic array with cellular valving for single cell co-culture.', 'Microfluidic platforms for the investigation of intercellular signalling mechanisms.', 'Oxygen control with microfluidics.', 'Microfluidics-Based Single-Cell Research for Intercellular Interaction.', 'Recent advances in microfluidic platforms for single-cell analysis in cancer biology, diagnosis and therapy.', 'The influence of spatial and temporal resolutions on the analysis of cell-cell interaction: a systematic study for time-lapse microscopy applications.', 'Bridging the gap: microfluidic devices for short and long distance cell-cell communication.', 'Scaling and automation of a high-throughput single-cell-derived tumor sphere assay chip.']"""

Abiraterone acetate (AA), the prodrug of abiraterone, which is an inhibitor of androgen synthesis enzymes, was evaluated for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, preliminary efficacy and safety in Japanese patients with CRPC in a phase-1, open-label and dose-escalation study. Chemotherapy-naïve Japanese CRPC patients (N = 27) received one of four AA daily doses (250 mg [n = 9], 500 mg [n = 6], 1000 [1 h premeal] mg [n = 6] and 1000 [2 h postmeal] mg [n = 6]) continuously through 28-day treatment cycles. In the first cycle, AA monotherapy was given on days 1-7 for pharmacokinetics, and AA plus prednisone (5 mg twice daily) from days 8 to 28. Of 27 patients, 9 continued treatment with AA until the data cut-off date (18 July 2013). Over the evaluated dose range, plasma abiraterone concentrations increased with dose, with median tmax 2-3 h. At each dose level, mean serum corticosterone concentrations increased, while testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations rapidly decreased following a single AA dose and were further reduced to near the quantification limit on day 8 regardless of the dose. At least 3 patients from each dose-group experienced ≥50% prostate-specific antigen reduction, suggesting clinical benefit from AA in Japanese CRPC patients. AA was generally well-tolerated, and, therefore, the recommended AA dosage regimen in Japanese CRPC patients is 1000 mg oral dose under modified fasting conditions (at least 1 h premeal or 2 h postmeal).

Lower screening rates may be due, in part, to controversy over the value of prostate cancer screenings as part of routine preventive care for men, but Black men represent a high-risk group for prostate cancer that may still benefit from PSA testing. Exploring the role of social factors that might be associated with PSA testing can increase knowledge of what might promote screening behaviors for prostate cancer and other health conditions for which Black men are at high risk. Using multilevel logistic regression, this study analyzed self-report lifetime use of PSA test for 829 Black men older than 45 years across 381 Philadelphia census tracts. This study included individual demographic and aggregated social capital data from the Public Health Management Corporation's 2004, 2006, and 2008 waves of the Community Health Database, and sociodemographic characteristics from the 2000 U.S. Census. Each unit increase in community participation was associated with a 3 to 3.5 times greater likelihood of having had a PSA test (odds ratio = 3.35). Findings suggest that structural forms of social capital may play a role in screening behaviors for Black men in Philadelphia. A better understanding of the mechanism underlying the link between social capital and screening behaviors can inform how researchers and interventionists develop tools to promote screening for those who need it.""","""['Lorraine T Dean', 'S V Subramanian', 'David R Williams', 'Katrina Armstrong', 'Camille Zubrinsky Charles', 'Ichiro Kawachi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['Social ecological predictors of prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal examination in black American men.', ""The role of social capital in African-American women's use of mammography."", 'Use of the prostate-specific antigen test among U.S. men: findings from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey.', 'Association of healthcare barriers with prostate-specific antigen screening among African-American and Afro-Caribbean men.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in African Americans.', 'Preventive health behaviors among the middle-aged and elderly in China: Does social capital matter?', 'Social Distress among Cancer Patients: Differential Effects of Risk Factors and Attenuating Role of Culturally Specific Social Support.', 'Racial and ethnic differences in the association of social cohesion and social capital with HIV testing.', 'Stress Correlates Related to Depressive Symptoms Among Young Black Men in Southern California.', 'Social-life factors associated with participation in screening and further assessment of colorectal cancer: A nationwide ecological study in Japanese municipalities.']"""

Prostate cancers (mean age at diagnosis = 62 ± SD = 8 years) from 32 MMR mutation carriers (23 MSH2, 5 MLH1 and 4 MSH6) enrolled in the Australasian, Mayo Clinic and Ontario sites of the Colon Cancer Family Registry were examined for clinico-pathologic features and MMR-deficiency (immunohistochemical loss of MMR protein expression and high levels of microsatellite instability; MSI-H). Tumor MMR-deficiency was observed for 22 cases [69 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 50-83 %], with the highest prevalence of MMR-deficiency in tumors from MSH2 mutation carriers (19/23, 83 %) compared with MLH1 and MSH6 carriers combined (3/9, 33 %; p = 0.01). MMR-deficient tumors had increased levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes compared with tumors without MMR-deficiency (p = 0.04). Under the assumption that tumour MMR-deficiency occurred only because the cancer was caused by the germline mutation, mutation carriers are at 3.2-fold (95 % CI 2.0-6.3) increased risk of prostate cancer, and when assessed by gene, the relative risk was greatest for MSH2 carriers (5.8, 95 % CI 2.6-20.9). Prostate cancer was the first or only diagnosed tumor in 37 % of carriers.

Magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound targeted biopsy detects prostate cancer more efficiently and of higher grade than standard 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsy but the optimal population for its use is not well defined. We evaluated the performance of magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound targeted biopsy vs 12-core biopsy across a prostate specific antigen continuum.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of all patients enrolled in a prospective trial who underwent 12-core transrectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound targeted biopsies from August 2007 through February 2014. Patients were stratified by each of 4 prostate specific antigen cutoffs. The greatest Gleason score using either biopsy method was compared in and across groups as well as across the population prostate specific antigen range. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as Gleason 7 (4 + 3) or greater. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.  Results:   A total of 1,003 targeted and 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsies were performed, of which 564 diagnosed prostate cancer for a 56.2% detection rate. Targeted biopsy led to significantly more upgrading to clinically significant disease compared to 12-core biopsy. This trend increased more with increasing prostate specific antigen, specifically in patients with prostate specific antigen 4 to 10 and greater than 10 ng/ml. Prostate specific antigen 5.2 ng/ml or greater captured 90% of upgrading by targeted biopsy, corresponding to 64% of patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent fusion biopsy. Conversely a greater proportion of clinically insignificant disease was detected by 12-core vs targeted biopsy overall. These differences persisted when controlling for potential confounders on multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer upgrading with targeted biopsy increases with an increasing prostate specific antigen cutoff. Above a prostate specific antigen threshold of 5.2 ng/ml most upgrading to clinically significant disease was achieved by targeted biopsy. In our population this corresponded to potentially sparing biopsy in 36% of patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Below this value 12-core biopsy detected more clinically insignificant cancer.

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. Our meta-analysis showed that, overall, the rs2294008 (C>T) polymorphism was associated with bladder cancer susceptibility (OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.20-1.40 for TT vs CC; OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.16-1.31 for CT vs CC; OR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.18-1.33 for TT/CT vs CC; OR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.06-1.20 for TT vs CT/CC). In the stratified analyses, the risk remained significant for studies of European populations, Asian populations, population-based studies, and hospital-based studies.

Methods:   A total of 80,597 patients with incident cancer diagnosed in 2002 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, Republic of China. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the 5-year survival rates of patients treated at hospitals with different spending intensities after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors.  Results:   After adjustment for patient characteristics, treatment modality, and hospital volume, an association was found between lower hospital spending intensity and poorer survival rates. The 5-year survival rate expressed by hazard ratios was 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-1.43, p < .001) for colorectal cancer, 1.18 (95% CI: 1.08-1.29, p < .001) for lung cancer, 1.13 (95% CI: 1.05-1.22, p = .002) for hepatoma, 1.16 (95% CI: 1.07-1.26, p < .001) for breast cancer, and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.10-1.39, p = .001) for prostate cancer.

However, the mechanism involved in suppression of cancer cell metastasis by α-solanine remains unclear. This study investigates the suppression mechanism of α-solanine on motility of the human prostate cancer cell PC-3. Results show that α-solanine reduces the viability of PC-3 cells. When treated with non-toxic doses of α-solanine, cell invasion is markedly suppressed by α-solanine. α-Solanine also significantly elevates epithelial marker E-cadherin expression, while it concomitantly decreases mesenchymal marker vimentin expression, suggesting it suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). α-Solanine reduces the mRNA level of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and extracellular inducer of matrix metalloproteinase (EMMPRIN), but increases the expression of reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-2. Immunoblotting assays indicate α-solanine is effective in suppressing the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), Akt and ERK. Moreover, α-solanine downregulates oncogenic microRNA-21 (miR-21) and upregulates tumor suppressor miR-138 expression. Taken together, the results suggest that inhibition of PC-3 cell invasion by α-solanine may be, at least in part, through blocking EMT and MMPs expression. α-Solanine also reduces ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and regulates expression of miR-21 and miR-138.

Men's understanding of their chosen treatment's potential side effects was significantly different from their understanding of diagnosis, cancer outcome, treatment options and selected treatment. Timing of information delivery was preferred by men at diagnosis, whereas partners preferred after the diagnosis. Men wanted more time to think about the diagnosis and treatment, whereas partners wanted an opportunity to discuss the diagnosis.

However, these models are technically demanding and require an invasive laparotomy. To overcome these problems, we evaluated a minimally invasive approach by performing percutaneous prostate puncture under the control of high-resolution ultrasound imaging.  Materials and methods:   Orthotopic tumor cell inoculation was performed in two groups of mice, i.e. in 10 nude mice via ultrasound-guided inoculation and in another 10 nude mice via an open surgical approach. Tumor growth was monitored after 4, 5 and 6 weeks by means of a high-resolution ultrasound system.  Results:   High-resolution ultrasound allowed exact tumor growth monitoring. After ultrasound-guided inoculation, 8 of 10 animals showed tumor engraftment. The surgical procedure was successful in 9 of 10 animals. Tumor volume was slightly but not significantly greater after surgical tumor induction. Our work demonstrates that tumor cell inoculation via percutaneous puncture of the prostate is feasible, less time-consuming and minimally invasive compared to an open surgical approach. This reduces the animal burden.  Conclusion:   Although the tumor size and the precision of inoculation is lower compared to the open surgical technique, this novel procedure enables real-time prostate punctures, suggesting the feasibility of other procedures including biopsy and local drug applications.""","""['Christina Körbel', 'Volker Jung', 'Jörn Kamradt', 'Michael Stöckle', 'Gerhard Unteregger', 'Michael D Menger', 'Matthias Saar']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Experimental orthotopic prostate tumor in nude mice: techniques for local cell inoculation and three-dimensional ultrasound monitoring.', 'Transrectal ultrasound for monitoring murine orthotopic prostate tumor.', 'Orthotopic tumorgrafts in nude mice: A new method to study human prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative volumetric imaging of normal, neoplastic and hyperplastic mouse prostate using ultrasound.', 'Development of a novel castration-resistant orthotopic prostate cancer model in New Zealand White rabbit.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort mortality study of 4,647 civilian, full-time workers employed at Camp Lejeune during 1973-1985 and potentially exposed to contaminated drinking water. We selected a comparison cohort of 4,690 Camp Pendleton workers employed during 1973-1985 and unexposed to contaminated drinking water. Mortality follow-up period was 1979-2008. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios utilized U.S. age-, sex-, race-, and calendar period-specific mortality rates as reference. We used survival analysis to compare mortality rates between Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton workers and assess the effects of estimated cumulative contaminant exposures within the Camp Lejeune cohort. Ground water contaminant fate/transport and distribution system models provided monthly estimated contaminant levels in drinking water serving workplaces at Camp Lejeune. The confidence interval (CI) indicated precision of effect estimates.  Results:   Compared to Camp Pendleton, Camp Lejeune workers had mortality hazard ratios (HRs) >1.50 for kidney cancer (HR = 1.92, 95% CI: 0.58, 6.34), leukemias (HR = 1.59, 95% CI: 0.66, 3.84), multiple myeloma (HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 0.45, 7.58), rectal cancer (HR = 1.65, 95% CI: 0.36, 7.44), oral cavity cancers (HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 0.34, 10.81), and Parkinson's disease (HR = 3.13, 95% CI: 0.76, 12.81). Within the Camp Lejeune cohort, monotonic exposure-response relationships were observed for leukemia and vinyl chloride and PCE, with mortality HRs at the high exposure category of 1.72 (95% CI: 0.33, 8.83) and 1.82 (95% CI: 0.36, 9.32), respectively. Cumulative exposures were above the median for most deaths from cancers of the kidney, esophagus, rectum, prostate, and Parkinson's disease, but small numbers precluded evaluation of exposure-response relationships.  Conclusion:   The study found elevated HRs in the Camp Lejeune cohort for several causes of death including cancers of the kidney, rectum, oral cavity, leukemias, multiple myeloma, and Parkinson's disease.

ChIP data on prostate cancer tissue specimens and cell lines suggested EZH2 occupancy and H3K27Me3 marks on the ID4 promoter.

Expression profiling studies using P4HA1 modulated prostate cells suggested regulation of Matrix metalloproteases 1. The invasive properties of P4HA1 overexpressing cells were reversed by blocking MMP1. Our studies indicate P4HA1 copy number gain in a subset of metastatic prostate tumors and its expression is also regulated by microRNA-124. MiR-124 in turn is negatively regulated by transcriptional repressors EZH2 and CtBP1, both of which are overexpressed in aggressive prostate cancer. Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and mice xenograft investigations show that P4HA1 is required for tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Our observations suggest that P4HA1 plays a critical role in prostate cancer progression and could serve as a viable therapeutic target.""","""['Balabhadrapatruni V S K Chakravarthi', 'Satya Sreehari Pathi', 'Moloy T Goswami', 'Marcin Cieślik', 'Heng Zheng', 'Sivakumar Nallasivam', 'Subramanyeswara R Arekapudi', 'Xiaojun Jing', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Jyoti Athanikar', 'Shannon L Carskadon', 'Robert J Lonigro', 'Lakshmi P Kunju', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Sooryanarayana Varambally']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['MiR-122 inhibits epithelial mesenchymal transition by regulating P4HA1 in ovarian cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-124-3p inhibits collagen synthesis in atherosclerotic plaques by targeting prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha-1 (P4HA1) in vascular smooth muscle cells.', 'Systematic Analysis of the Expression and Prognostic Significance of P4HA1 in Pancreatic Cancer and Construction of a lncRNA-miRNA-P4HA1 Regulatory Axis.', 'Collagen Prolyl Hydroxylases Are Bifunctional Growth Regulators in Melanoma.', 'Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases modify tumor progression.', 'BZW2 Inhibition Reduces Colorectal Cancer Growth and Metastasis.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Intratumoral immune heterogeneity of prostate cancer characterized by typing and hub genes.', 'The Role of P4HA1 in Multiple Cancer Types and its Potential as a Target in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Context Matters: Response Heterogeneity to Collagen-Targeting Approaches in Desmoplastic Cancers.']"""

In order to unveil the role of Skp2 in the turnover of DAB2IP protein, both prostate cell lines and prostate cancer specimens with a variety of molecular and cell biologic techniques were employed. We demonstrated that DAB2IP is regulated by Skp2-mediated proteasome degradation in the prostate cell lines. Further analyses identified the N-terminal DAB2IP containing the ubiquitination site. Immunohistochemical study exhibited an inverse correlation between DAB2IP and Skp2 protein expression in the prostate cancer tissue microarray. In contrast, DAB2IP can suppressSkp2 protein expression is mediated through Akt signaling. The reciprocal regulation between DAB2IP and Skp2 can impact on the growth of PCa cells.

Cases (N = 658) and controls (N = 1,316) were individually matched by age, sex, race/ethnicity, timing of study entry, and sample selection. Prediagnostic PLCO serum samples were tested for GBV-C RNA (as a measure of active infection) and E2 antibody (active or resolved infection). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for the association between GBV-C and NHL overall and NHL subtypes. Twelve cases (1.8%) and seven controls (0.5%) were GBV-C RNA-positive. GBV-C RNA positivity was associated with NHL overall [OR, 3.43; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.35-8.71] and, based on small numbers, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR, 5.31; 95% CI, 1.54-18.36).

Detection of molecular subtypes, for instance by using microarray gene technology, can give new prognostic information which can assist personalized treatment planning. The detection of new subtypes with validation across additional and larger patient cohorts is important for bringing a potential prognostic tool into the clinic.  Methods:   We used fresh frozen prostatectomy tissue of high molecular quality to further explore four molecular subtype signatures of PCa based on Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of 15 selected gene sets published in a previous study. For this analysis we used a statistical test of dependent correlations to compare reference signatures to signatures in new normal and PCa samples, and also explore signatures within and between sample subgroups in the new samples.  Results:   An important finding was the consistent signatures observed for samples from the same patient independent of Gleason score. This proves that the signatures are robust and can surpass a normally high tumor heterogeneity within each patient. Our data did not distinguish between four different subtypes of PCa as previously published, but rather highlighted two groups of samples which could be related to good and poor prognosis based on survival data from the previous study.The poor prognosis group highlighted a set of samples characterized by enrichment of ESC, ERG-fusion and MYC + rich signatures in patients diagnosed with low Gleason score,. The other group consisted of PCa samples showing good prognosis as well as normal samples. Accounting for sample composition (the amount of benign structures such as stroma and epithelial cells in addition to the cancer component) was important to improve subtype assignments and should also be considered in future studies.  Conclusion:   Our study validates a previous molecular subtyping of PCa in a new patient cohort, and identifies a subgroup of PCa samples highly interesting for detecting high risk PCa at an early stage.

We investigated how RCT recruiters reacted to patients' treatment preferences and identified key strategies to improve informed decision-making and trial recruitment.  Methods:   Audio-recordings of 103 RCT recruitment appointments with 96 participants in three UK multicenter pragmatic RCTs were analyzed using content and thematic analysis. Recruiters' responses to expressed treatment preferences were assessed in one RCT (ProtecT - Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment) in which training on exploring preferences had been given, and compared with two other RCTs where this specific training had not been given.  Results:   Recruiters elicited treatment preferences similarly in all RCTs but responses to expressed preferences differed substantially. In the ProtecT RCT, patients' preferences were not accepted at face value but were explored and discussed at length in three key ways: eliciting and acknowledging the preference rationale, balancing treatment views, and emphasizing the need to keep an open mind and consider all treatments. By exploring preferences, recruiters enabled participants to become clearer about whether their views were robust enough to be sustained or were sufficiently weak that participation in the RCT became possible. Conversely, in the other RCTs, treatment preferences were often readily accepted without further discussion or understanding the reasoning behind them, suggesting that patients were not given the opportunity to fully consider all treatments and trial participation.  Conclusions:   Recruiters can be trained to elicit and address patients' treatment preferences, enabling those who may not have considered trial participation to do so. Without specific guidance, some RCT recruiters are likely to accept initial preferences at face value, missing opportunities to promote more informed decision-making. Training interventions for recruiters that incorporate key strategies to manage treatment preferences, as in the ProtecT study, are required to facilitate recruitment and informed consent.

Methods:   Patients had CRPC if records showed prostate cancer diagnosis, medical/surgical castration and ≥2 prostate-specific antigen increases through 1 June 2007-31 May 2012. CS-sensitive comorbidities were assessed 6 months prior to the index date. Adherence, defined as medication possession ratio (MPR) ≥0.8, among patients initiating LETs (cabazitaxel, docetaxel, or abiraterone acetate) before 30 November 2011, resource utilization and costs among patients with concomitant CS were assessed. Statistical analysis included descriptive, Cox proportional hazards, and logistic regression models.  Results:   Common CS-sensitive conditions among 12,128 patients with CRPC included hypertension (75.74%) and hyperlipidemia (54.69%). Those with glaucoma (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67), ischemic heart disease (HR = 0.78), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (HR = 0.78) were less likely to be prescribed LETs (all p < 0.01). Duration of LET was shorter among patients with CS-sensitive comorbidities (125.02 vs 133.08 days; p = 0.04) in the 6 month follow-up period. Among LET-treated patients with and without CS-sensitive comorbidities, less than half had MPR ≥ 0.8 (LET: 48.72% vs 54.05%; concomitant CS: 42.19% vs 40.54%, respectively). Cerebrovascular disease (odds ratio = 0.107; 95% confidence interval = 0.012 to 0.966) and PVD (odds ratio = 0.523; 95% confidence interval = 0.276 to 0.991) were associated with reduced CS adherence.

However, a significant minority of patients with cancer experience persistent or recurrent symptoms of emotional distress for which they need help. A model developed in mental health, the self-regulatory executive function model (S-REF), specifies that maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and processes, including persistent worry, are key to understanding why such emotional problems persist. This cross-sectional study explored, for the first, time whether metacognitive beliefs were associated with emotional distress in a cancer population, and whether this relationship was mediated by worry, as predicted by the S-REF model.  Method:   Two hundred twenty-nine participants within 3 months of diagnosis of, and before treatment for, primary breast or prostate cancer completed self-report questionnaires measuring anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, metacognitive beliefs, worry, and illness perceptions.  Results:   Regression analysis showed that metacognitive beliefs were associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, and explained additional variance in these outcomes after controlling for age, gender, and illness perceptions. Structural equation modeling was consistent with cross-sectional hypotheses derived from the theory that metacognitive beliefs cause and maintain distress both directly and indirectly by driving worry.

One avenue is to measure the presence of cell-free circulating tumor DNA in plasma. Various approaches have been investigated, predominantly covering hotspot mutations or customized, patient-specific assays. Therefore, we investigated the utility of using exome sequencing to monitor circulating tumor DNA levels through the detection of single nucleotide variants in plasma. Two technologies, claiming to offer efficient library preparation from nanogram levels of DNA, were evaluated. This allowed us to estimate the proportion of starting molecules measurable by sequence capture (<5%). As cell-free DNA is highly fragmented, we designed and provide software for efficient identification of PCR duplicates in single-end libraries with a varying size distribution. On average, this improved sequence coverage by 38% in comparison to standard tools. By exploiting the redundant information in PCR-duplicates the background noise was reduced to ∼1/35,000. By applying our optimized analysis pipeline to a simulation analysis, we determined the current sensitivity limit to ∼1/2400, starting with 30 ng of cell-free DNA. Subsequently, circulating tumor DNA levels were assessed in seven breast- and one prostate cancer patient. One patient carried detectable levels of circulating tumor DNA, as verified by break-point specific PCR. These results demonstrate exome sequencing on cell-free DNA to be a powerful tool for disease monitoring of metastatic cancers.

Objective:   To examine the patterns of prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in the United States in individuals with different life expectancies.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data from the population-based National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 2000 through 2010 were used and included 27 404 participants aged 65 years or older. Using a validated mortality index specific for NHIS, participants were grouped into those with low (<25%), intermediate (25%-49%), high (50%-74%), and very high (≥75%) risks of 9-year mortality.  Main outcomes and measures:   Rates of prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening.  Results:   In participants with very high mortality risk, 31% to 55% received recent cancer screening, with prostate cancer screening being most common (55%). For women who had a hysterectomy for benign reasons, 34% to 56% had a Papanicolaou test within the past 3 years. On multivariate analysis, very high vs low mortality risk was associated with less screening for prostate (odds ratio [OR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.50-0.85]), breast (OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.35-0.53]), and cervical (OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.36-0.70]) cancers. There was less screening for prostate and cervical cancers in more recent years compared with 2000, and there was no significant interaction between calendar year and mortality risk for any cancer screening (P > .05 for all cancers). Our sensitivity analysis showed that screening was also common in individuals with less than 5-year life expectancy.  Conclusions and relevance:   A substantial proportion of the US population with limited life expectancy received prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening that is unlikely to provide net benefit.

Most CRPC tumors continue to express the androgen receptor (AR) as well as androgen-responsive genes owing to reactivation of AR. Protein tyrosine kinases have been implicated in supporting AR activation under castrate conditions. Here we report that Lyn tyrosine kinase expression is upregulated in CRPC human specimens compared with hormone naive or normal tissue. Lyn overexpression enhanced AR transcriptional activity both in vitro and in vivo and accelerated CRPC. Reciprocally, specific targeting of Lyn resulted in a decrease of AR transcriptional activity in vitro and in vivo and prolonged time to castration. Mechanistically, we found that targeting Lyn kinase induces AR dissociation from the molecular chaperone Hsp90, leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This work indicates a novel mechanism of regulation of AR stability and transcriptional activity by Lyn and justifies further investigation of the Lyn tyrosine kinase as a therapeutic target for the treatment of CRPC.Oncogenesis (2014) 3, e115; doi:10.1038/oncsis.2014.30; published online 18 August 2014.""","""['A Zardan', 'K M Nip', 'D Thaper', 'P Toren', 'S Vahid', 'E Beraldi', 'L Fazli', 'F Lamoureux', 'K M Gust', 'M E Cox', 'J L Bishop', 'A Zoubeidi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogenesis""","""['Nucleoporin 62 and Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent kinase kinase 2 regulate androgen receptor activity in castrate resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Bruceantin targets HSP90 to overcome resistance to hormone therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Nrdp1-mediated regulation of ErbB3 expression by the androgen receptor in androgen-dependent but not castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', ""Recepteur d'origine nantais (RON), more than a kinase: Role in castrate-resistant prostate cancer."", 'Aspartoacylase suppresses prostate cancer progression by blocking LYN activation.', 'Seven Shades of Grey: A Follow-Up Study on the Molecular Basis of Coat Colour in Indicine Grey Cattle Using Genome-Wide SNP Data.', 'Fyn and Lyn gene polymorphisms impact the risk of thyroid cancer.', 'Phase II trial of efficacy, safety and biomarker analysis of sintilimab plus anlotinib for patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer.', 'Minocycline binds and inhibits LYN activity to prevent STAT3-meditated metastasis of colorectal cancer.']"""

We investigated the relationship between histological inflammation and total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), and percentage of free PSA (f/tPSA) levels in patients without prostate cancer (PC).  Materials and methods:   We studied 106 men with tPSA<10 ng/mL who had undergone biopsy that was negative for PC and who had no clinical prostatitis. Inflammation observed at biopsies was scored for inflammation type in each biopsy core by use of a four-point scale and was then correlated with tPSA, fPSA, and f/tPSA.  Results:   Different patterns of inflammation were found in each set of biopsies. Regression factor analysis was used to form two groups according to inflammation type: more chronic and more acute. Median tPSA, fPSA, and f/tPSA levels in the more chronic and more acute inflammation groups were 6.4 ng/mL, 1.09 ng/mL, and 15%, and 7.3 ng/mL, 0.79 ng/mL, and l2%, respectively. A significant difference was found in fPSA (p=0.003) and f/tPSA (p<0.001), whereas the difference in tPSA was not significant (p=0.200). Total PSA correlated with fPSA (r=0.4, p<0.001) but not with inflammation type (r=0.12, p>0.010). A correlation existed between inflammation type and fPSA (r=-0.31, p=0.001) and f/tPSA (r=-0.43, p<0.001) in that the fPSA and f/tPSA were lower in the group with more acute inflammation.  Conclusions:   Subclinical inflammation has a significant influence on fPSA in patients with tPSA<10 ng/mL but without PC or clinical prostatitis. Subclinical inflammation is not characterized by elevated tPSA alone but also by a decreased fPSA, a tendency similar to that in PC.""","""['Goran Stimac', 'Borislav Spajic', 'Ante Reljic', 'Josip Katusic', 'Alek Popovic', 'Igor Grubisic', 'Davor Tomas']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Korean J Urol""","""['Aggressiveness of inflammation in histological prostatitis--correlation with total and free prostate specific antigen levels in men with biochemical criteria for prostate biopsy.', 'Effect of NIH-IV prostatitis on free and free-to-total PSA.', 'Free prostate-specific antigen outperforms total prostate-specific antigen as a predictor of prostate volume in patients without prostate cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Clinical Importance of Histopathological Inflammation in Patients with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: A Prospective Study of 222 Patients.']"""

Pristanic acid is formed during peroxisomal oxidation of phytanic acid, and is the direct substrate of α-Methyl-CoA-Racemase (AMACR)--an enzyme that is consistently overexpressed in prostate tumors relative to benign tissue. We measured phytanic and pristanic acids as percentages of total fatty acids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in prediagnostic blood samples from 300 prostate cancer cases and 300 matched controls, all of whom were participants in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study supplementation trial and follow-up cohort. In addition to providing a fasting blood sample at baseline, all men completed extensive diet, lifestyle, and medical history questionnaires. Among controls, the strongest dietary correlates of serum phytanic and pristanic acids were saturated fat, dairy fat, and butter (r = 0.50 and 0.40, 0.46 and 0.38, and 0.40 and 0.37, respectively; all P-values <0.001). There was no association between serum phytanic acid and risk of total or aggressive prostate cancer in multivariate logistic regression models (for increasing quartiles, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for aggressive cancer were 1.0 (referent), 1.62 (0.97-2.68), 1.12 (0.66-1.90), and 1.14 (0.67-1.94), P(trend) = 0.87). Pristanic acid was strongly correlated with phytanic acid levels (r = 0.73, P < 0.0001), and was similarly unrelated to prostate cancer risk. Significant interactions between phytanic and pristanic acids and baseline circulating β-carotene concentrations were noted in relation to total and aggressive disease among participants who did not receive β-carotene supplements as part of the original ATBC intervention trial. In summary, we observed no overall association between serum phytanic and pristanic acid levels and prostate cancer risk.

Bone-targeted agents that prevent metastasis-induced bone complications can cause adverse events. Understanding how patients view treatment options may optimize care. This study aimed to quantify how PCa patients value a hypothetical treatment that delays BM but can cause osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). The study also assessed the value patients place on avoiding metastasis-induced bone complications versus increased survival.  Methods:   PCa patients from the United Kingdom (n = 201) and Sweden (n = 200) on androgen-deprivation therapy or hormone therapy for ≥ 3 years completed a 10-question discrete-choice-experiment survey examining whether patients would accept a BM-delaying treatment. Two time-tradeoff questions assessed patients' willingness to tradeoff between survival and bone complications. Percentages of patients choosing treatment were summarized by levels of treatment efficacy and ONJ risk. Odds ratios from a logit model were used to evaluate how patient and medication characteristics affected treatment choice. Proportions of patients choosing each tradeoff scenario were calculated.  Results:   A majority of patients accepted treatment at the lowest benefit level (5-month BM delay) and highest risk level (9% ONJ risk). PCa symptoms and prior treatment affected patient preferences. Nearly 80% of patients would tradeoff at least 3 months of survival to avoid bone complications.  Conclusions:   PCa patients in the U.K and Sweden may value a medication that delays BM, despite the risk of ONJ. Furthermore, patients were willing to tradeoff up to 5 months of survival for prevention of bone complications.""","""['A Brett Hauber', 'Jorge Arellano', 'Yi Qian', 'Juan Marcos González', 'Joshua D Posner', 'Ateesha F Mohamed', 'Francesca Gatta', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Jean-Jacques Body']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""[""Physicians' preferences for bone metastases treatments in France, Germany and the United Kingdom."", ""Patients' preferences for bone metastases treatments in France, Germany and the United Kingdom."", ""Patients' Preferences for the Treatment of Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Discrete Choice Experiment."", 'Advances in prevention and treatment of bone metastases in prostate cancer.

Previously we showed that Gli2 overexpression increased transcriptional activity of androgen receptor (AR) and conferred androgen growth-independence to normally growth-dependent PCa cells. Here we localized the regions of AR-Gli2 protein interaction and determined the domains within Gli2 needed for AR co-activation.  Methods:   Co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown assays were used to define AR-Gli binding domains. Co-activation assays using androgen-responsive promoter reporters were used to define Gli2 regions needed for AR co-activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to confirm nuclear interactions of Gli2 with AR in PCa cells.  Results:   The Gli2 C-terminal domain (CTD) is sufficient for AR co-activation. Two elements within the CTD were required: (1) an AR binding domain within aa628-897; and (2) at least part of the Gli2 transactivation domain within aa1252-1586. In turn, Gli2 binds the tau5/AF5 ligand-independent activation domain in the AR N-terminus. Mutations in the WxxLF motif in tau5/AF5 greatly diminished binding to Gli2-CTD. Gli2 interaction with AR tau5/AF5 was further substantiated by the ability of Gli2/Gli2-CTD to co-activate truncated AR splice variants (AR-V7/ARV567es). ChIP assays confirmed that Gli2 associates with chromatin at androgen response elements found near androgen-responsive genes in LNCaP cells. These assays also showed that AR associates with chromatin containing a Gli-response element near a Gli-responsive gene.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicate that Gli2 overexpression in PCa cells might support development of castration resistant PCa through AR co-activation and suggests that AR might modulate transcription from Gli2.""","""['Na Li', 'Mengqian Chen', 'Sarah Truong', 'Chunhong Yan', 'Ralph Buttyan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Non-canonical activation of hedgehog in prostate cancer cells mediated by the interaction of transcriptionally active androgen receptor proteins with Gli3.', 'Hedgehog/Gli supports androgen signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Gli Transcription Factors Mediate the Oncogenic Transformation of Prostate Basal Cells Induced by a Kras-Androgen Receptor Axis.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Gender-related differentially expressed genes in pancreatic cancer: possible culprits or accomplices?', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'GLI3 Is Stabilized by SPOP Mutations and Promotes Castration Resistance via Functional Cooperation with Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer.', 'Gli2 mediates the development of castration‑resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hedgehog in prostate cancer explained.']"""

Here, we show that baicalein leads to human cancer cell death by inducing autophagy rather than apoptosis, because cell death induced by baicalein was completely reversed by suppressing the expression levels of key molecules in autophagy such as Beclin 1, vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34), autophagy-related (Atg)5 and Atg7, but not by pan-caspase inhibitor. Our data revealed that baicalein significantly increased the number of green fluorescence protein-cytosol-associated protein light chain 3 (GFP-LC3)-containing puncta and LC3B-II expression levels, which were further enhanced by chloroquine treatment. Furthermore, a luciferase-based reporter assay showed that the ratio of RLuc-LC3wt/RLuc-LC3G120A was greatly reduced. The data suggested that baicalein induced not only autophagosome formation, but also autophagic flux. Experiments using short interfering RNAs and pharmacological inhibitors revealed that Beclin 1, Vps34, Atg5, Atg7 and UNC-51 (Caenorhabditis elegans)-like kinase 1 (ULK1) play pivotal roles in mediating baicalein-induced autophagy. Moreover, baicalein activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)α, leading to ULK1 activation through phosphorylation at Ser555, whereas both protein and mRNA levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Raptor, upstream inhibitors of ULK1 and autophagy, were markedly downregulated by baicalein. Our data suggest that the anticancer effects of baicalein are mainly due to autophagic cell death through activation of the AMPK/ULK1 pathway and inhibition of mTOR/Raptor complex 1 expression. These results provide new mechanistic insights into the anticancer functions of autophagy inducers, such as baicalein, which may be used as potential therapeutics for cancer treatment.""","""['Pramod Aryal', 'Kijoong Kim', 'Pil-Hoon Park', 'Seongho Ham', 'Junghee Cho', 'Kyung Song']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['ADIPOQ/adiponectin induces cytotoxic autophagy in breast cancer cells through STK11/LKB1-mediated activation of the AMPK-ULK1 axis.', 'Tris (1, 3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate induces apoptosis and autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells: Involvement of ROS-mediated AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathways.', 'Cucurbitacin E Induces Autophagy via Downregulating mTORC1 Signaling and Upregulating AMPK Activity.', 'The kinase triad, AMPK, mTORC1 and ULK1, maintains energy and nutrient homoeostasis.', 'Regulation of Autophagy Enzymes by Nutrient Signaling.', 'Autophagy Induction by Scutellaria Flavones in Cancer: Recent Advances.', 'Baicalein as Promising Anticancer Agent: A Comprehensive Analysis on Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Perspectives.', 'Novel Anti-Cancer Products Targeting AMPK: Natural Herbal Medicine against Breast Cancer.', 'Recent Advances in Pharmaceutical Cocrystals: A Focused Review of Flavonoid Cocrystals.', 'Enhancing Anti-Cancer Therapy with Selective Autophagy Inhibitors by Targeting Protective Autophagy.']"""

We identified the cistrome and gene signature of androgen receptor splice variants in castration resistant prostate cancer cell lines and determined the clinical significance of androgen receptor splice variant regulated genes.  Materials and methods:   The castration resistant prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1, which expresses full-length androgen receptor and androgen receptor splice variants endogenously, was used as the research model. We established 22Rv1-ARFL(-)/ARV(+) and 22Rv1-ARFL(-)/ARV(-) through RNA interference. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next generation sequencing and microarray techniques were used to identify the cistrome and gene expression profiles of androgen receptor splice variants in the absence of androgen.  Results:   Androgen receptor splice variant binding sites were identified in 22Rv1-ARFL(-)/ARV(+). A gene set was regulated uniquely by androgen receptor splice variants but not by full-length androgen receptor in the absence of androgen. Integrated analysis revealed that some genes were directly modulated by androgen receptor splice variants. Unsupervised clustering analysis showed that the androgen receptor splice variant gene signature differentiated benign from malignant prostate tissue as well as localized prostate cancer from metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer specimens. Some genes that were modulated uniquely by androgen receptor splice variants also correlated with histological grade and biochemical failure.  Conclusions:   Androgen receptor splice variants can bind to DNA independent of full-length androgen receptor in the absence of androgen and modulate a unique set of genes that is not regulated by full-length androgen receptor. The androgen receptor splice variant gene signature correlates with disease progression.

In the present study, we showed that the AR gene was upregulated by paired box 2 (PAX2) in androgen-independent prostate cancer. When PAX2 upregulated AR gene expression, a decrease in DNA methylation of the AR gene locus was also observed. PAX2 was highly expressed and promoted cell growth in an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line (22Rv1). The cell growth inhibition by PAX2 knockdown was rescued by AR overexpression in 22Rv1 cells. In a mouse xenograft model of androgen-independent prostate cancer, PAX2 knockdown inhibited tumor growth and AR gene expression and also increased DNA methylation of the AR gene.

In subsequent clinical trials, cabazitaxel was associated with pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability profiles consistent with those of previous taxanes. In the pivotal phase III study(TROPIC; NCT00417079), cabazitaxel led to significantly improved overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer(mCRPC), compared with mitoxantrone, when both were administered in combination with prednisone/prednisolone(median survival: 15.1 months[95%confidence interval(CI): 14.1-16.3]vs 12.7 months[95% CI: 11.6-13.7], hazard ratio(HR): 0.70[95% CI: 0.59-0.83], p<0.0001), and it also extended progression-free survival. Furthermore, a long-term analysis of the TROPIC trial revealed that the survival benefit with cabazitaxel was maintained at 2 years, with 60(15.9%)patients in the cabazitaxel group and 31(8.2%)patients in the mitoxantrone group surviving for B2 years(odds ratio: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.33-3.33). Cabazitaxel also provides pain palliation similar to that provided by using mitoxantrone. The safety profile of cabazitaxel is consistent with that of first-generation taxanes, and gastrointestinal(predominantly diarrhea)and hematologic(mainly neutropenia)adverse events are the most frequently reported. Clinical trial data suggest that these events can be managed with careful monitoring and dose reduction where necessary. In addition, treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF)can mitigate hematologic adverse events, whereas supportive treatment with antiemetic and antidiarrheal agents may ameliorate gastrointestinal symptoms.

Enzalutamide is a rationally designed, orally administered androgen receptor(AR)inhibitor. It inhibits multiple points in the androgen receptor signalling pathway, which is considered an important driver of CRPC, including the inhibition of androgen binding to the AR, nuclear translocation of the AR complex, and binding of the AR complex to deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA). Unlike other anti-androgens(such as bicalutamide), enzalutamide does not act as a partial AR agonist. The first in human phase I/II trial was conducted in the United States in both chemotherapy-naïve patients and postchemotherapy patients with progressive metastatic CRPC(mCRPC). The results showed encouraging antitumor activity of enzalutamide by considering all outcomes assessed in the trial. The first reported phase III trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study involving 1,199 patients with mCRPC that progressed even after docetaxel therapy(AFFIRM trial). Enzalutamide was associated with significant benefits over the placebo considering time-to-event outcomes(i.e. prolonged overall survival[OS], delayed time to prostatic specific antigen[PSA]progression[TTPP], prolonged radiographic progression free survival[rPFS], time to the first skeletal related event[SRE])as well as objective response outcomes(i.e. PSA, soft tissue, and quality of life[QOL]). On the basis of the AFFIRM results, Astellas and Medivation filed a new drug application with the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency in 2012, and obtained their approval. Another phaseI/II enzalutamide trial was conducted in both chemotherapy-naïve patients and post-chemotherapy pa- tients with progressive mCRPC. Enzalutamide at a dose of 160mg/day was well tolerated, and it showed pharmacokinetic characteristics, adverse events, and anti-tumor activity profiles similar to that of the non-Japanese population. On the basis of the results of the studies summarized above, a new drug application was submitted to the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan in May 2013 and obtained the approval in Mar 2014. The second phase III trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of 1,717 chemotherapy- naïve patients with CRPC(PREVAIL trial).

Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis including 2,323 patients with localized Gleason score 3+4 prostate cancer who underwent a radical prostatectomy between 2005 and 2013 from 6 academic centers. We analyzed the rates of biopsy downgrading/upgrading and advanced stage in the overall cohort by employing standardized AS criteria (using biopsy Gleason score 3+4).  Results:   The final pathologic Gleason score was 3+3 = 6 in 8%, 3+4 = 7 in 67%, 4+3 = 7 in 20%, and 8 to 10 in 5% cases. The overall rate of unfavorable disease (upgrading or advanced stage or both) was 46%. In multivariable analysis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level>10 ng/ml, PSA density (PSAD) >0.15 ng/ml/g, clinical stage >T1, and>2 positive cores were predictors of unfavorable disease. According to the AS criteria used, the risk of unfavorable disease ranged from 30% to 42%. In patients without any risk factor (PSA level≤ 10 ng/ml, PSAD ≤ 0.15 ng/ml/g, T1c, and ≤ 2 positive cores), the unfavorable disease rate was 19%. The main limitations of this study are the retrospective design and nonstandardization of pathologic assessment between centers.  Conclusions:   Approximately half of patients with biopsy Gleason score 3+4 cancer have unfavorable disease at final pathology. Nevertheless, expanding AS eligibility to these patients may be acceptable provided adherence to strict selection criteria leading to a<20% risk of unfavorable disease.

Tumors from patients that progressed had more chromosomal gains and losses, and showed a higher degree of selection for a predominant clonal pattern. PTEN loss was the most frequent aberration in progressers (57%), followed by TBL1XR1 gain (29%). MYC gain was observed in one progresser, which was the only lesion with an ERG gain, but no TMPRSS2-ERG fusion.

Methods:   We did an open-label, randomised, 2 × 2 factorial trial in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (either T2a N0 M0 prostatic adenocarcinomas with prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≥10 μg/L and a Gleason score of ≥7, or T2b-4 N0 M0 tumours regardless of PSA and Gleason score). We randomly allocated patients by computer-generated minimisation--stratified by centre, baseline PSA, tumour stage, Gleason score, and use of a brachytherapy boost--to one of four groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Patients in the control group were treated with neoadjuvant androgen suppression with leuprorelin (22·5 mg every 3 months, intramuscularly) for 6 months (short-term) and radiotherapy alone (designated STAS); this procedure was either followed by another 12 months of androgen suppression with leuprorelin (intermediate-term; ITAS) or accompanied by 18 months of zoledronic acid (4 mg every 3 months for 18 months, intravenously; STAS plus zoledronic acid) or by both (ITAS plus zoledronic acid). The primary endpoint was prostate cancer-specific mortality. This analysis represents the first, preplanned assessment of oncological endpoints, 5 years after treatment. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00193856.  Findings:   Between Oct 20, 2003, and Aug 15, 2007, 1071 men were randomly assigned to STAS (n=268), STAS plus zoledronic acid (n=268), ITAS (n=268), and ITAS plus zoledronic acid (n=267). Median follow-up was 7·4 years (IQR 6·5-8·4). Cumulative incidences of prostate cancer-specific mortality were 4·1% (95% CI 2·2-7·0) in the STAS group, 7·8% (4·9-11·5) in the STAS plus zoledronic acid group, 7·4% (4·6-11·0) in the ITAS group, and 4·3% (2·3-7·3) in the ITAS plus zoledronic acid group. Cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was 17·0% (13·0-22·1), 18·9% (14·6-24·2), 19·4% (15·0-24·7), and 13·9% (10·3-18·8), respectively. Neither prostate cancer-specific mortality nor all-cause mortality differed between control and experimental groups. Cumulative incidence of PSA progression was 34·2% (28·6-39·9) in the STAS group, 39·6% (33·6-45·5) in the STAS plus zoledronic acid group, 29·2% (23·8-34·8) in the ITAS group, and 26·0% (20·8-31·4) in the ITAS plus zoledronic acid group. Compared with STAS, no difference was noted in PSA progression with ITAS or STAS plus zoledronic acid; however, ITAS plus zoledronic acid reduced PSA progression (sub-hazard ratio [SHR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·53-0·95; p=0·021). Cumulative incidence of local progression was 4·1% (2·2-7·0) in the STAS group, 6·1% (3·7-9·5) in the STAS plus zoledronic acid group, 1·5% (0·5-3·7) in the ITAS group, and 3·4% (1·7-6·1) in the ITAS plus zoledronic acid group; no differences were noted between groups. Cumulative incidences of bone progression were 7·5% (4·8-11·1), 14·6% (10·6-19·2), 8·4% (5·5-12·2), and 7·6% (4·8-11·2), respectively. Compared with STAS, STAS plus zoledronic acid increased the risk of bone progression (SHR 1·90, 95% CI 1·14-3·17; p=0·012), but no differences were noted with the other two groups. Cumulative incidence of distant progression was 14·7% (10·7-19·2) in the STAS group, 17·3% (13·0-22·1) in the STAS plus zoledronic acid group, 14·2% (10·3-18·7) in the ITAS group, and 11·1% (7·6-15·2) in the ITAS plus zoledronic acid group; no differences were recorded between groups. Cumulative incidence of secondary therapeutic intervention was 25·6% (20·5-30·9), 28·9% (23·5-34·5), 20·7% (16·1-25·9), and 15·3% (11·3-20·0), respectively. Compared with STAS, ITAS plus zoledronic acid reduced the need for secondary therapeutic intervention (SHR 0·67, 95% CI 0·48-0·95; p=0·024); no differences were noted with the other two groups. An interaction between trial factors was recorded for Gleason score; therefore, we did pairwise comparisons between all groups. Post-hoc analyses suggested that the reductions in PSA progression and decreased need for secondary therapeutic intervention with ITAS plus zoledronic acid were restricted to tumours with a Gleason score of 8-10, and that ITAS was better than STAS in tumours with a Gleason score of 7 or lower. Long-term morbidity and quality-of-life scores were not affected adversely by 18 months of androgen suppression or zoledronic acid.  Interpretation:   Compared with STAS, ITAS plus zoledronic acid was more effective for treatment of prostate cancers with a Gleason score of 8-10, and ITAS alone was effective for tumours with a Gleason score of 7 or lower. Nevertheless, these findings are based on secondary endpoint data and post-hoc analyses and must be regarded cautiously. Long- term follow-up is necessary, as is external validation of the interaction between zoledronic acid and Gleason score. STAS plus zoledronic acid can be ruled out as a potential therapeutic option.

Metastasis requires epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which endows cancer cells with the ability to disseminate from the primary tumor and colonize new tissue sites. A wide variety of secreted factors promote EMT, and while overexpression and constitutive activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling is associated with poor prognosis of PCa, a precise role of EGF in PCa progression to metastasis remains unclear. Here, we show that Hsp27 is required for EGF-induced cell migration, invasion and MMPs activity as well as the expression of EMT markers including Fibronectin, Vimentin and Slug with concomitant decrease of E-cadherin. Mechanistically, we found that Hsp27 is required for EGF-induced AKT and GSK3β phosphorylation and β-catenin nuclear translocation. Moreover, silencing Hsp27 decreases EGF dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin on tyrosine 142 and 654, enhances β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation, prevents β-catenin nuclear translocation and binding to the Slug promoter. These data suggest that Hsp27 is required for EGF-mediated EMT via modulation of the β-catenin/Slug signaling pathway. Together, our findings underscore the importance of Hsp27 in EGF induced EMT in PCa and highlight the use of Hsp27 knockdown as a useful strategy for patients with advanced disease.""","""['Thomas Cordonnier', 'Jennifer L Bishop', 'Masaki Shiota', 'Ka Mun Nip', 'Daksh Thaper', 'Sepideh Vahid', 'Devon Heroux', 'Martin Gleave', 'Amina Zoubeidi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Snail regulated by PKC/GSK-3β pathway is crucial for EGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells.', 'Hsp27 regulates epithelial mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer.', 'Stabilization of Snail through AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway is required for TNF-α-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'The EMT regulator slug and lung carcinogenesis.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'HSPB1 facilitates chemoresistance through inhibiting ferroptotic cancer cell death and regulating NF-κB signaling pathway in breast cancer.', 'Underlying mechanisms and clinical potential of circRNAs in glioblastoma.', 'Dialog beyond the Grave: Necrosis in the Tumor Microenvironment and Its Contribution to Tumor Growth.', 'Atractylenolide I inhibits EMT and enhances the antitumor effect of cabozantinib in prostate cancer via targeting Hsp27.', 'Alternative ANKHD1 transcript promotes proliferation and inhibits migration in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.']"""

Objective:   To identify and evaluate plasma exosomal miRNAs for prognosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   RNA sequencing was performed to identify candidate exosomal miRNAs associated with overall survival in a screening cohort of 23 CRPC patients. Candidate miRNAs were further evaluated for prognosis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in a follow-up cohort of 100 CRPC patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to evaluate survival association using candidate miRNAs along with clinical prognostic factors.  Results and limitations:   RNA sequencing in screening cohort generated approximately 6.80 million mappable reads per patient. Of those with normalized read counts ≥ 5, 43% were mapped to miRNAs for a total of 375 known and 57 novel miRNAs. Cox regression analysis identified an association of miR-1290, -1246, and -375 with overall survival (false discover rate < 0.05). Of those, higher levels of miR-1290 and -375 were significantly associated with poor overall survival (p < 0.004) in the follow-up cohort. Incorporation of miR-1290/-375 into putative clinical prognostic factors-based models in CRPC stage significantly improved predictive performance with a time-dependent area under the curve increase from 0.66 to 0.73 (p = 6.57 × 10(-6)).  Conclusions:   Plasma exosomal miR-1290 and miR-375 are promising prognostic biomarkers for CRPC patients. Prospective validation is needed for further evaluation of these candidate miRNAs.  Patient summary:   In this study, we evaluated whether small RNAs circulating in blood could be used to predict clinical outcomes in late-stage prostate cancer patients. We identified two blood-based small RNAs whose levels showed significant association with survival.

However, direct evidence that OA and/or ALA suppresses to the development of esophageal cancer has not been studied. Also, no previous studies have evaluated how OA and/or ALA regulates malignant potential (cell proliferation, migration, colony formation and adhesion) and intracellular signaling pathways, and whether their effects might be synergistic and/or additive in esophageal cancer cells has not yet been elucidated.  Materials/methods:   We conducted in vitro studies and evaluated whether OA and ALA alone or in combination may regulate malignant potential in OE19 and OE33 esophageal cancer cell lines.  Results:   Both OA and ALA significantly down-regulated cell proliferation, adhesion and/or migration. OA and/or ALA did not change the number of colonies but decrease colony sizes when compared to control. Also, we observed that OA and/or ALA positively cross-regulates the expression levels of AMPK/S6 axis. Moreover, OA and ALA up-regulated tumor suppressor genes (p53, p21, and p27) and these effects are abolished by AMPK siRNA administration. Importantly, we observed that these effects are additively regulated by OA and ALA in combination when compared to control in OE19 and OE33 esophageal cancer cell lines.

Moreover, different anaesthetic techniques can also modify coagulant factors. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects on pro- and anti-coagulant and fibrinolytic factors of two established types of anaesthesia in patients with prostate cancer undergoing elective LRP.  Methods:   102 patients with primary prostate cancer, who underwent conventional LRP or robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), were studied and divided into 2 groups to receive total intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion (TIVA-TCI) or balanced inhalation anaesthesia (BAL) prior to surgery. Before the induction of anaesthesia (T0), 1 hr (T1) and 24 hrs post-surgery (T2), some pro-coagulant factors, fibronolysis markers, p-selectin and haemostatic system inhibitors were evaluated.  Results:   Both TIVA-TCI and BAL patients showed a marked and significant increase in pro-coagulant factors and consequent reduction in haemostatic system inhibitors in the early post operative period (p ≤ 0.004 for each markers). Use of RALP showed a significant increase in prothrombotic markers as compared to LRP. In TIVA patients undergoing LRP, a significant reduction of p-selectin levels between T0 and T2 (p = 0.001) was observed as compared to BAL, suggesting a better protective effect on platelet activation of anaesthetic agents used for TIVA.

We evaluated how a newly defined maximum tumor diameter (MTD) might contribute to the prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in a consecutive series of PCA patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Patients with PCA who underwent RP without neoadjuvant therapy at a single center were included for analysis. MTD was defined as the largest diameter of all identified tumors in all three dimensions (i.e., length, width, or depth) of the prostate (""Basel technique""). Cox regression models addressed the association of MTD with BCR in three risk groups (low risk-prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 10 ng/ml, pT2, and Gleason score (GS) ≤ 6; intermediate risk-PSA ≥ 10 and <20 ng/ml and/or pT2 and GS = 7; high risk-PSA > 20 ng/ml or pT3 or GS ≥ 8) and whole cohort. Within a median follow-up of 44 months (interquartile range (IQR) 23-66), 48 patients (9.4 %) in the intermediate-risk and high-risk groups experienced BCR. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, PSA, pathological stage (pT stage), GS, positive surgical margins (PSMs), and MTD > 19.5 mm were independent predictors for BCR (p < 0.05). In subgroup analysis, MTD as a nominal variable (<24.5 and >24.5 mm) was the only independent predictor of BCR in the intermediate-risk group (hazard ratio (HR) 9.933, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.070-47.665; p < 0.05).

We aimed to investigate the links between BMI and the most common site-specific cancers.  Methods:   With primary care data from individuals in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink with BMI data, we fitted Cox models to investigate associations between BMI and 22 of the most common cancers, adjusting for potential confounders. We fitted linear then non-linear (spline) models; investigated effect modification by sex, menopausal status, smoking, and age; and calculated population effects.  Findings:   5·24 million individuals were included; 166,955 developed cancers of interest. BMI was associated with 17 of 22 cancers, but effects varied substantially by site. Each 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was roughly linearly associated with cancers of the uterus (hazard ratio [HR] 1·62, 99% CI 1·56-1·69; p<0·0001), gallbladder (1·31, 1·12-1·52; p<0·0001), kidney (1·25, 1·17-1·33; p<0·0001), cervix (1·10, 1·03-1·17; p=0·00035), thyroid (1·09, 1·00-1·19; p=0·0088), and leukaemia (1·09, 1·05-1·13; p≤0·0001). BMI was positively associated with liver (1·19, 1·12-1·27), colon (1·10, 1·07-1·13), ovarian (1·09, 1.04-1.14), and postmenopausal breast cancers (1·05, 1·03-1·07) overall (all p<0·0001), but these effects varied by underlying BMI or individual-level characteristics. We estimated inverse associations with prostate and premenopausal breast cancer risk, both overall (prostate 0·98, 0·95-1·00; premenopausal breast cancer 0·89, 0·86-0·92) and in never-smokers (prostate 0·96, 0·93-0·99; premenopausal breast cancer 0·89, 0·85-0·94). By contrast, for lung and oral cavity cancer, we observed no association in never smokers (lung 0·99, 0·93-1·05; oral cavity 1·07, 0·91-1·26): inverse associations overall were driven by current smokers and ex-smokers, probably because of residual confounding by smoking amount. Assuming causality, 41% of uterine and 10% or more of gallbladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers could be attributable to excess weight. We estimated that a 1 kg/m(2) population-wide increase in BMI would result in 3790 additional annual UK patients developing one of the ten cancers positively associated with BMI.  Interpretation:   BMI is associated with cancer risk, with substantial population-level effects. The heterogeneity in the effects suggests that different mechanisms are associated with different cancer sites and different patient subgroups.

Unfortunately, once progressed to the castration resistant stage, the disease is regarded as incurable as prostate cancer cells are highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy.  Method:   We recently reported that the two natural compounds polysaccharopeptide (PSP) and Gamma-tocotrienols (γ-T3) possessed potent anti-cancer activities through targeting of CSCs. In the present study, using both prostate cancer cell line and xenograft models, we seek to investigate the therapeutic potential of combining γ-T3 and PSP in the treatment of prostate cancer.  Result:   We showed that in the presence of PSP, γ-T3 treatment induce a drastic activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This was accompanied with inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation levels at Ser 79. In addition, PSP treatment also sensitized cancer cells toward γ-T3-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that combination of PSP and γ-T3 treaments significantly reduced the growth of prostate tumor in vivo.

In the developed world treatment for the disease in the non-metastasised state usually takes the form of surgical intervention and/or radiotherapy. In the developing world such techniques are less widely available. This paper describes the development of an intravaginal ring for the localised delivery of a chemotherapeutic drug to the cervix that has the potential to reduce the need for surgical intervention and will also provide a novel anti-cancer therapy for women in low resource settings. Disulfiram has demonstrated antineoplastic action against prostate, breast and lung cancer. Both PEVA and silicone elastomer were investigated for suitability as materials in the manufacture of DSF eluting intravaginal rings.

Here, we report the mechanisms by which the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway regulates cellular LC3B and SQSTM1 levels. In different cell types, ΔRaf-1:ER- or B-Raf(V600E)-mediated MEK/ERK activation increased LC3B-I, LC3B-II, and SQSTM1/p62 levels, which was accompanied by increased BiP/GRP78 expression. Use of the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine and bafilomycin A1, or RNA interference of ATG7, suggested that these increases in LC3B and SQSTM1 levels were in part attributed to altered autophagic flux. However, intriguingly, these increases were also attributed to their increased expression. Upon Raf/MEK/ERK activation, mRNA levels of LC3B and SQSTM1 were also increased, and subsequent luciferase reporter analyses suggested that SQSTM1 upregulation was mediated at transcription level. Under this condition, transcription of BiP/GRP78 was also increased, which was necessary for Raf/MEK/ERK to regulate LC3B at the protein, but not mRNA, level. This suggests that BiP has a role in regulating autophagy machinery when Raf/MEK/ERK is activated. In conclusion, these results suggest that, under a Raf/MEK/ERK-activated condition, the steady-state cellular levels of LC3B and SQSTM1 can also be determined by their altered expression wherein BiP is utilized as an effector of the signaling.""","""['Jin-Hwan Kim', 'Seung-Keun Hong', 'Pui-Kei Wu', 'Alexsia L Richards', 'William T Jackson', 'Jong-In Park']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['ERK1/2 can feedback-regulate cellular MEK1/2 levels.', 'The FGFR/MEK/ERK/brachyury pathway is critical for chordoma cell growth and survival.', 'SHP2 promotes laryngeal cancer growth through the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk pathway and serves as a prognostic indicator for laryngeal cancer.', 'Cross-talk between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the MEK/ERK pathway potentiates apoptosis in human triple negative breast carcinoma cells: role of a dihydropyrimidone, nifetepimine.', 'Roles of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in cell growth, malignant transformation and drug resistance.', 'Nickel nanoparticles induce autophagy and apoptosis via HIF-1α/mTOR signaling in human bronchial epithelial cells.', 'Role of Autophagy Mediated by AMPK/DDiT4/mTOR Axis in HT22 Cells Under Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation.', 'Orexin-A exerts neuroprotective effect in experimental intracerebral hemorrhage by suppressing autophagy via OXR1-mediated ERK/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Chrysophanol-8-O-glucoside protects mice against acute liver injury by inhibiting autophagy in hepatic stellate cells and inflammatory response in liver-resident macrophages.', 'Autophagy and skin wound healing.']"""

In vivo, combination treatment with PTX and S13 reduced dramatically PCa tumor growth with a relevant difference in the density of new blood vessels with respect to control and single treatments. This reduction was determined by a concomitant impairment of endothelial cell migration and of VEGF release by cancer cells. In fact, S13, when used alone, was sufficient to reduce tubule formation in vivo, and to inhibit VEGFR2 activation and FAK expression in endothelial cells. In addition, the combination treatment determined a significant reduction in ROS production and HIF-1 stabilization in PCa cells respect to single treatments with S13 or PTX.

The main goal of this work was to compare pharmacodynamic responses to therapy assessed with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) using fluorine-18 sodium fluoride (NaF) and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as the tracers.  Materials and methods:   Patients with prostate cancer with known osseous metastases were treated with zibotentan (ZD4054) and imaged with combined dynamic NaF/FDG PET/CT before therapy (baseline), after 4 weeks of therapy (week 4), and after 2 weeks of treatment break (week 6). Kinetic analysis allowed comparison of the voxel-based tracer uptake rate parameter Ki, the vasculature parameters K1 (measuring perfusion/permeability) and Vb (measuring vasculature fraction in the tissue), and the standardized uptake values (SUVs).  Results:   Correlations were high for the NaF and FDG peak uptake parameters (Ki and SUV correlations ranged from 0.57 to 0.88) and for vasculature parameters (K1 and Vb correlations ranged from 0.61 to 0.81). Correlation was low between the NaF and FDG week 4 Ki responses (ρ = 0.35; P = .084) but was higher for NaF and FDG week 6 Ki responses (ρ = 0.72; P < .0001). Correlations for vasculature responses were always low (ρ < 0.35). NaF and FDG uptakes in the osseous metastases were spatially dislocated, with overlap in the range from 0% to 80%.  Conclusion:   This study found that late NaF and FDG uptake responses are consistently correlated but that earlier uptake responses and all vasculature responses can be unrelated. This study also confirmed that FDG and NaF uptakes are spatially dislocated.

Therefore, AURKA amplification is a potential prognostic biomarker that may help to identify patients with prostate cancer who are at high risk for developing castrate-resistant disease with clinical features of small cell carcinoma. Furthermore, AURKA inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials. In a previous study, we found AURKA amplification in 6 cases of prostate cancer with Paneth cell-like cells. This morphologic pattern has been suggested to represent low-grade neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) with generally favorable prognosis. We sought to investigate the frequency of AURKA amplification and the histologic characteristics of prostate cancer with Paneth cell-like NED. Twenty-five cases from 172 prostatectomies were evaluated for the presence of 18 morphologic features and AURKA amplification. Most prostate cancers with Paneth cell-like NED had macronucleoli (92%), basophilic appearance (88%), perineural invasion (72%), and nuclear stratification (76%). The frequency of AURKA amplification was 45%, present throughout the examined tumor nodule including areas without Paneth cell-like cells. When histologically similar cases with and without AURKA amplification were compared, this gene alteration was associated with larger extent of Paneth cell-like NED identified at magnification ×20 (P = .015), higher percentage of Paneth cell-like NED throughout the tumor nodule (P = .033), ductal features (P = .02), and higher overall Gleason grade (P = .039).

Methods:   In five cities, we constructed networks of physicians on the basis of their shared patients in 2004-2005 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data. From these networks, we identified subgroups of urologists who most frequently shared patients with one another. Among men with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy, we used multilevel analysis with generalized linear mixed-effect models to examine whether physician network structure-along with specific characteristics of the network subgroups-was associated with rates of 30-day and late urinary complications, and long-term incontinence after accounting for patient-level sociodemographic, clinical factors, and urologist patient volume.  Results:   Networks included 2677 men in five cities who underwent radical prostatectomy. The unadjusted rate of 30-day surgical complications varied across network subgroups from an 18.8 percentage-point difference in the rate of complications across network subgroups in city 1 to a 26.9 percentage-point difference in city 5. Large differences in unadjusted rates of late urinary complications and long-term incontinence across subgroups were similarly found. Network subgroup characteristics-average urologist centrality and patient racial composition-were significantly associated with rates of surgical complications.

We developed a decision-modeling framework to evaluate its cost-effectiveness to guide the use of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART).  Methods:   We populated the model using patient-level data and external sources. Patients were classified as intermediate risk or high risk on the basis of Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment-Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) nomogram and then stratified by the ProsVue slope (≤2 pg/mL/mo; >2 pg/mL/mo) and receipt of ART. In sensitivity analyses, we varied the effect of the ProsVue slope on the use of ART and other model parameters.  Results:   The cost-effectiveness of the ProsVue-guided strategy varied widely because of small differences in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 10 years. In the intermediate-risk group, when the use of ART decreased from 20% (standard care) to 7.5% among patients with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $25,160/QALY. In the high-risk group, the use of ART would have to decrease from 40% (standard care) to 11.5% among those with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less to obtain a ratio of $50,000/QALY. The cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to varying benefits of salvage therapy, quality of life, and costs of ART and ProsVue testing.

However, BRCA germline mutations are rare in prostate cancer limiting the ability to therapeutically target these pathways. This study investigates whether histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi), reported to modulate DSB repair pathways in sporadic cancers, can downregulate DSB repair pathways and sensitize prostate cancer cells to PARPi. Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index < 0.9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not. Similarly, clonogenicity was significantly decreased after cotreatment. Flow cytometric cell-cycle analysis and Annexin-V staining revealed significant apoptosis upon treatment with SAHA+olaparib. This coincided with increased DNA damage observed by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of γH2AX foci, a marker of DSBs. In addition, immunoblot analysis showed a significant and persistent increase in nuclear γH2AX levels. Both SAHA and olaparib downregulated the expression of HR-related proteins, BRCA1 and RAD51, whereas SAHA + olaparib had an additive effect on RAD51. Silencing RAD51 sensitized prostate cancer cells to SAHA and olaparib alone. Collectively, cotreatment with HDACi and PARPi downregulated HR-related protein expression and concomitantly increased DNA damage, resulting in prostate cancer cell death.

Results:   The Phase I cohort identified that detectable baseline mGSTP1 DNA was associated with poorer OS (HR, 4.2 95% CI 2.1-8.2; P<0.0001). A decrease in mGSTP1 DNA levels after cycle 1 was associated with a PSA response (P=0.008). In the Phase II cohort, baseline mGSTP1 DNA was a stronger predictor of OS than PSA change after 3 months (P=0.02). Undetectable plasma mGSTP1 after one cycle of chemotherapy was associated with PSA response (P=0.007).  Conclusions:   We identified plasma mGSTP1 DNA as a potential prognostic marker in men with CRPC as well as a potential surrogate therapeutic efficacy marker for chemotherapy and corroborated these findings in an independent Phase II cohort. Prospective Phase III assessment of mGSTP1 levels in plasma DNA is now warranted.""","""['K L Mahon', 'W Qu', 'J Devaney', 'C Paul', 'L Castillo', 'R J Wykes', 'M D Chatfield', 'M J Boyer', 'M R Stockler', 'G Marx', 'H Gurney', 'G Mallesara', 'P L Molloy', 'L G Horvath', 'S J Clark;PRIMe consortium']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Serum Free Methylated Glutathione S-transferase 1 DNA Levels, Survival, and Response to Docetaxel in Metastatic, Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analyses of Data from a Phase 3 Trial.', 'Epigenetic markers in circulating cell-free DNA as prognostic markers for survival of castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen in circulating tumor cells is a new poor prognostic marker for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Phase 2 study of circulating microRNA biomarkers in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PSA response rate as a surrogate marker for median overall survival in docetaxel-based first-line treatments for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an analysis of 22 trials.', 'Liquid biopsies for cancer: From bench to clinic.', 'Glutathione-S-Transferase p1 Gene Promoter Methylation in Cell-Free DNA as a Diagnostic and Prognostic Tool for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Biomarkers for the Detection and Risk Stratification of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'The Association Between Breast Cancer and Blood-Based Methylation of CD160, ISYNA1 and RAD51B in the Chinese Population.', 'Blood-based liquid biopsies for prostate cancer: clinical opportunities and challenges.']"""

SOX2 is also a lineage survival oncogene for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and esophagus. Spontaneous cellular and humoral immune responses against SOX2 present in cancer patients classify it as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) shared by lung cancer, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer among others. In this study, B-cell epitopes were predicted using computer-assisted algorithms. Synthetic peptides based on the prediction were screened for recognition by serum samples from cancer patients using ELISA. Two dominant B-cell epitopes, SOX2:52-87 and SOX2:98-124 were identified.

Each diffusive mixer has two integrated micropumps connected to the media and the drug reservoirs respectively for generating the desired combination without the need for any extra equipment to perfuse the solution such as syringe pumps. The cell array is periodically exposed to the drug combination with the programmed LabVIEW system during a couple of days without extra handling after seeding the cells into the microfluidic device and also, this device does not require the continuous generation of solutions compared to the previous systems. Therefore, the total amount of drug being consumed per experiment is less than a few hundred micro liters in each reservoir.

Methods:   A total of 120 patients with at least 5 years of follow up after radical prostatectomy were included in the present study. Health-related quality of life outcomes were assessed using three questionnaires, the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, the University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index and the International Prostate Symptom Score.  Results:   A total of 91 patients (73%) responded at a median follow-up time of 102 months (range 85-123 months). Among general health-related quality of life domains, mental and role composite summary score remained stable throughout the follow-up period. At the final survey, no significant differences were observed in any of the domains compared with the age-matched average score of the Japanese population. Although the slight decrease in urinary function scores and International Prostate Symptom Score beyond 5 years postoperatively compared with 5 years, the differences were not significant. The sexual function summary score showed a substantially lower score just after radical prostatectomy and remained at a deteriorated level (P < 0.001).

(89)Zr-huJ591 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was performed in patients with metastatic prostate cancer to analyze and validate this as an imaging biomarker for metastatic disease. The purpose of this initial study was to assess safety, biodistribution, normal organ dosimetry, and optimal imaging time post-injection for lesion detection.  Methods:   Ten patients with metastatic prostate cancer received 5 mCi of (89)Zr-huJ591. Four whole-body scans with multiple whole-body count rate measurements and serum activity concentration measurements were obtained in all patients. Biodistribution, clearance, and lesion uptake by (89)Zr-huJ591 immuno-PET imaging was analyzed and dosimetry was estimated using MIRD techniques. Initial assessment of lesion targeting of (89)Zr-huJ591 was done. Optimal time for imaging post-injection was determined.  Results:   The dose was well tolerated with mild chills and rigors seen in two patients. The clearance of (89)Zr-huJ591 from serum was bi-exponential with biological half-lives of 7 ± 4.5 h (range 1.1-14 h) and 62 ± 13 h (range 51-89 h) for initial rapid and later slow phase. Whole-body biological clearance was 219 ± 48 h (range 153-317 h). The mean whole-body and liver residence time was 78.7 and 25.6 h, respectively. Dosimetric estimates to critical organs included liver 7.7 ± 1.5 cGy/mCi, renal cortex 3.5 ± 0.4 cGy/mCi, and bone marrow 1.2 ± 0.2 cGy/mCi. Optimal time for patient imaging after injection was 7 ± 1 days. Lesion targeting of bone or soft tissue was seen in all patients. Biopsies were performed in 8 patients for a total 12 lesions, all of which were histologically confirmed as metastatic prostate cancer. One biopsy-proven lesion was not positive on (89)Zr-huJ591, while the remaining 11 lesions were (89)Zr-huJ591 positive. Two biopsy-positive nodal lesions were noted only on (89)Zr-huJ591 study, while the conventional imaging modality was negative.  Conclusion:   (89)Zr-huJ591 PET imaging of prostate-specific membrane antigen expression is safe and shows good localization of disease in prostate cancer patients.

The study determined the degree to which changes in glycosyltransferase activities during cancer can be related to aberrant cell-surface tumor associated carbohydrate structures (TACA). To this end, changes in sialyltransferase (sialylT), fucosyltransferase (fucT) and galactosyltransferase (galT) activity were measured in normal and tumor tissue using a miniaturized enzyme activity assay and synthetic glycoconjugates bearing terminal LacNAc Type-I (Galβ1-3GlcNAc), LacNAc Type-II (Galβ1-4GlcNAc), and mucin core-1/Type-III (Galβ1-3GalNAc) structures. These data were related to TACA using tissue microarrays containing 115 breast and 26 colon cancer specimen. The results show that primary human breast and colon tumors, but not adjacent normal tissue, express elevated β1,3GalT and α2,3SialylT activity that can form α2,3SialylatedType-IIIglycans (Siaα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc). Prostate tumors did not exhibit such elevated enzymatic activities. α1,3/4FucT activity was higher in breast, but not in colon tissue. The enzymology based prediction of enhanced α2,3sialylated Type-III structures in breast tumors was verified using histochemical analysis of tissue sections and tissue microarrays. Here, the binding of two markers that recognize Galβ1-3GalNAc (peanut lectin and mAb A78-G/A7) was elevated in breast tumor, but not in normal control, only upon sialidase treatment. These antigens were also upregulated in colon tumors though to a lesser extent. α2,3sialylatedType-III expression correlated inversely with patient HER2 expression and breast metastatic potential. Overall, enzymology measurements of glycoT activity predict truncated O-glycan structures in tumors. High expression of the α2,3sialylated T-antigen O-glycans occur in breast tumors.

Using the Cyberknife® robotic system multiple non-coplanar fields are usually given with a treatment time of one hour or more. We planned to evaluate organ motion in this setting injecting a hydrogel spacer to protect the anterior rectal wall during treatment.  Methods:   A 66 years old man with low risk prostate cancer was planned for robotic hypofractionated stereotactic RT. After implantation of fiducial markers and a hydrogel spacer a total dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions was given to the planning target volume (clinical target volume + 3 mm). After each beam the corresponding data reporting on the intra-fractional movement were pre-processed, the generated log-files extracted and the data analysed according to different directions: left -right (LR); anterior - posterior (AP); inferior -superior (IS). Clinical assessments were prospectively done before RT start, one week after the end of treatment as well as 1, 6 and 12 months afterwards. Symptoms were documented using Common Toxicity and Adverse Events Criteria 4.0.  Results:   Tolerability of marker and hydrogel implantation was excellent. A total of 284 non-coplanar fields were used per fraction. The total treatment time for all fields per fraction lasted more than 60 minutes. The detected and corrected movements over all 5 fractions were in a range of +/- 4 mm in all directions (LR: mean 0,238 - SD 0,798; AP: mean 0,450 - SD 1,690; and IS: mean 0,908 - SD 1,518). V36Gy for the rectum was 0.062 ccm. After RT, grade 1-2 intestinal toxicity and grade 1 genitourinarytoxicity occurred, but resolved completely after 10 days. On 1-, 6- and 12-months follow-up the patient was free of any symptoms with only slight decrease of erectile function (grade 1). There was a continuous PSA decline.

These studies are limited by variability in surgeon experience, bias in patient selection, and in some cases, sample size. We evaluated the impact of anesthesia technique for RP on biochemical recurrence (BCR) using a large cohort of patients operated on by a single experienced surgeon.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data from a prospective institutional oncologic database on 929 patients treated with RP by a single surgeon from 1999-2008. Spinal anesthesia was used for patients from 2002-2006. We compared outcomes of these patients (n = 264) with outcomes of patients who underwent general anesthesia (n = 665) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1999-2001 and 2006-2008. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess differences in BCR rates between the anesthesia groups adjusting for differences in postoperative factors related to anesthetic technique and tumour pathologic characteristics associated with BCR after RP.  Results:   Median follow-up among patients free from BCR was 4.6 yr. On multivariable analysis, spinal anesthesia did not independently predict the rate of BCR (hazard ratio = 1.10; 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.74; P = 0.7). Independent predictors of BCR were preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), pathologic Gleason grade, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesicle invasion.  Conclusions:   We did not find an association between anesthesia technique and disease recurrence in men with prostate cancer treated with RP.

Material and methods:   Altogether, 127 consecutive patients were recruited to this study at Haukeland University Hospital, Norway. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PCA3 score, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate volume (Pvol) and age were determined. All patients had an extended 10-core biopsy. The performance of PCA3 score and Hansen's nomogram was tested.  Results:   There were 124 evaluable patients. Among these, 59 patients had PCa on the initial biopsies. Mean PSA, PCA3 score and age were significantly higher and Pvol was significantly lower in patients with PCa. PCA3 scores of 35 and 21 led to a sensitivity of 71% and 81% and specificity of 72% and 55%, respectively. Hansen's nomogram gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.806. The intraclass correlation was 0.959 (Cronbach's alpha). Applied to this material, PCa would be missed in 15.2% of patients when applying the suggested threshold probability of 30%, among whom 66.7% had high-grade PCa. With a threshold probability of 20% only one patient had PCa and this was low grade.  Conclusions:   Hansen's PCA3-based nomogram is valid for this cohort. A threshold probability of 20% seems more adequate than 30% for this less screened cohort. PCA3 score only affects the biopsy indication in some patients and is recommended only for this subset.

Monitoring of response using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (sPSA) can be insufficient at this stage. Imaging has been proposed, in particular, nuclear medicine functional imaging and MRI, since response of predominant bone metastases is hardly evaluable on CT. Our aim was to evaluate in patients with CRPC with bone metastases, before and after various treatment lines, the evolution of sPSA, whole-body 18F-fluorocholine (FCH) PET/CT and spine MRI (sMRI) that has been proposed for detection of imminent malignant spinal cord compression.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively gathered a pilot series of 10 patients with CRPC metastatic to bone who had 47 PSA assays, FCH PET/CT, and spine-MRI (sMRI) performed concomitantly as routine examinations, before the beginning and at the end of 37 therapeutic intervals (TIs). Blinded reading of FCH PET/CT and sMRI was performed to evaluate visually whether or not the disease has been progressing (new lesions, greater size, or greater uptake intensity of known lesions) between the initial and the final examination of each TI.  Results:   Visual interpretations limited to spine FCH (sFCH) PET/CT and sMRI were in accordance for 34 TIs (92%): 14 progressions and 20 nonprogressions. In 2 cases, sFCH did not detect lesions visible on sMRI: one epiduritis and one 6-mm lesion. In 1 case, MRI missed a lesion in the sacrum that was detected on sFCH. When whole-body FCH (wbFCH) PET/CT was taken into account, the agreement with sMRI was limited to 29 TIs (78%). The 8 discrepant cases were all wbFCH positive and sMRI negative, that is, a significantly higher frequency of positivity for wbFCH (P < 0.008). Serum PSA levels increased by more than 25% during 21 TIs, whereas no progression was visible in 8 TIs on sMRI and in 2 TIs on wbFCH. In 5 TIs, sPSA decreased by more than 50%, and progression was never detected on imaging.  Conclusion:   In detecting progression in patients with CRPC metastatic to bone, results of spine imaging with sMRI and sFCH PET/CT were highly correlated, whereas wbFCH PET/CT showed significantly more progression statues comparing to sMRI alone related to the exploration of other parts of the skeleton and of soft tissue.""","""['Sona Balogova', 'Joseph Ben Zakoun', 'Laure Michaud', 'Antoine Khalil', 'Marc Tassart', 'Adoracion Esteso', 'Khaldoun Kerrou', 'Virginie Huchet', 'Marie-France Carette', 'Jean-Pierre Lotz', 'Jean-Noël Talbot']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['Early outcome prediction on 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone.', '(18)F-Fluorocholine PET/CT for early response assessment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with enzalutamide.', '18Ffluoromethylcholine (FCH) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for lymph node staging of prostate cancer: a prospective study of 210 patients.', 'Current and potential future role of PSMA-PET in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Acquisition with (11)C-choline and (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT for patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Editorial Comment: Advances in MRI and PET of the prostate: concurrence or complementarity?']"""

In part, ANXA2 supports HSCs by serving as an anchor for stromal-derived factor-1 (CXCL12/SDF-1). Recently, it was demonstrated that prostate cancer cells, like HSCs, use ANXA2 to establish metastases in marrow. The present study determined the capacity of ANXA2 expression by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) to facilitate tumor recruitment and growth through ANXA2-CXCL12 interactions. Significantly more CXCL12 was expressed by BMSC(Anxa2) (+/+) than by BMSC(Anxa2) (-/-) resulting in more prostate cancer cells migrating and binding to BMSC(Anxa2) (+/+) than BMSC(Anxa2) (-/-), and these activities were reduced when CXCL12 interactions were blocked. To further confirm that BMSC signaling through ANXA2-CXCL12 plays a critical role in tumor growth, immunocompromised SCID mice were subcutaneously implanted with human prostate cancer cells mixed with BMSC(Anxa2) (+/+) or BMSC(Anxa2) (-/-). Significantly larger tumors grew in the mice when the tumors were established with BMSC(Anxa2) (+/+) compared with the tumors established with BMSC(Anxa2) (-/-). In addition, fewer prostate cancer cells underwent apoptosis when cocultured with BMSC(Anxa2) (+/+) compared with BMSC(Anxa2) (-/-), and similar results were obtained in tumors grown in vivo. Finally, significantly more vascular structures were observed in the tumors established with the BMSC(Anxa2) (+/+) compared with the tumors established with BMSC(Anxa2) (-/-). Thus, ANXA2-CXCL12 interactions play a crucial role in the recruitment, growth, and survival of prostate cancer cells in the marrow.  Implications:   The tumor microenvironment interaction between ANXA2-CXCL12 is critical for metastatic phenotypes and may impact chemotherapeutic potential.""","""['Younghun Jung', 'Jingcheng Wang', 'Eunsohl Lee', 'Samantha McGee', 'Janice E Berry', 'Kenji Yumoto', 'Jinlu Dai', 'Evan T Keller', 'Yusuke Shiozawa', 'Russell S Taichman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Annexin-2 is a regulator of stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXCL12 function in the hematopoietic stem cell endosteal niche.', 'Bone-derived Nestin-positive mesenchymal stem cells improve cardiac function via recruiting cardiac endothelial cells after myocardial infarction.', 'Twist-1 Enhances Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Support of Hematopoiesis by Modulating CXCL12 Expression.', 'CXCL12-CXCR4 contributes to the implication of bone marrow in cancer metastasis.', 'Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) as a target in liver diseases.', 'Annexin A2: the missing piece in the puzzle of pathogen-induced damage.', 'Role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in tumor recurrence.', 'Mechanisms, Diagnosis and Treatment of Bone Metastases.', 'The multifaceted roles of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12 in osteophilic metastatic cancers.', 'Annexin Animal Models-From Fundamental Principles to Translational Research.']"""

Our aim is to understand the mechanisms of how the pathway of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis and signaling can promote cancer growth in inflammatory environment at cellular and animal model levels.  Main methods:   In this study, a chronic inflammation pathway was mimicked with a stable cell line that over-expressed a novel human enzyme consisting of cyclooxygenase isoform-2 (COX-2) linked to microsomal (PGE2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1)) for the overproduction of pathogenic PGE2. This PGE2-producing cell line was co-cultured and co-implanted with three human cancer cell lines including prostate, lung, and colon cancers in vitro and in vivo, respectively.  Key findings:   Increases in cell doubling rates for the three cancer cell types in the presence of the PGE2-producing cell line were clearly observed. In addition, one of the four human PGE2 subtype receptors, EP1, was used as a model to identify PGE2-signaling involved in promoting the cancer cell growth. This finding was further proven in vivo by co-implanting the PGE2-producing cells line and the EP1-positive cancer cells into the immune deficient mice, after that, it was observed that the PGE2-producing cells promoted all three types of cancer formation in the mice.  Significance:   This study clearly demonstrated that the human COX-2 linked to mPGES-1 is a pathway that, when mediated by the EP, is linked to promoting cancer growth in a chronic inflammatory environment.

Based on the tumor biology, targeting agents have been developed which directly affect the underlying genetic or immunological changes found in specific tumor entities. Significant increases in survival have delivered the functional proof of the concept of targeted and immunological tumor therapy. The management and adherence of the patient as well as optimized cooperation with clinicians are decisive for the results of therapy and disease control.Several solid tumors are currently under investigation in clinical studies evaluating the (sequential) therapy with targeting and immunologically active agents, e.g. tyrosine kinase and mTOR inhibitors, targeting antibodies, such as bevacizumab, specific antagonists, such as enzalutamide and immunological checkpoint inhibitors via PD(L)1 and/or CTLA 4 antibodies.Currently approved agents have dramatically changed the landscape of treatment options especially for prostate cancer. Such agents include hormone therapy with enzalutamide and abiraterone, radiotherapy with cabazitaxel and xofigo (radium 223), metastatic breast cancer (eribulin and everolimus), renal cell carcinoma (sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib, everolimus and temsirolimus), non-small cell lung cancer (crizotinib and afatinib), colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (regorafenib) and melanoma (ipilimumab and vemurafenib). The treatment of rarer tumors, such as pancreatic and hepatocellular cancer and soft tissue sarcoma has entered the stage of targeted therapy with the approval of nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel, sorafenib, and eribulin/pazopanib.

Results:   The knockdown of PTEN in prostate cancer cell lines increased the stem-like properties of the cells, including their sphere-forming ability, stem cell population number, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related gene expression, and ABCG2 expression. Additionally, PTEN expression was highly associated with elevated expression of phospho-Akt. Treatment with an Akt inhibitor suppressed the PTEN-mediated effects on the properties of these stem-like cells as well as drug resistance, ABCG2 expression, and the NF-κB pathway.  Conclusion:   The loss of PTEN in prostate cancer cells resulted in an increased PI3K/Akt pathway. Due to the Akt activation, PTEN loss may play an important role in prostate cancer by promoting cancer stemness through a mechanism that involves enhanced NF-κB signaling.""","""['Ran-Ju Kim', 'Eunjin Bae', 'Young Kwon Hong', 'Jae Yup Hong', 'Nam Keun Kim', 'Hee Jung Ahn', 'Jong Jin Oh', 'Dong Soo Park']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncology""","""['PTEN regulates BCRP/ABCG2 and the side population through the PI3K/Akt pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia.', 'Role of PTEN protein in multidrug resistance of prostate cancer cells.', 'miR-221/222 promote cancer stem-like cell properties and tumor growth of breast cancer via targeting PTEN and sustained Akt/NF-κB/COX-2 activation.', 'The Par-4/PTEN connection in tumor suppression.', 'Animal models relevant to human prostate carcinogenesis underlining the critical implication of prostatic stem/progenitor cells.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'ARRDC4 and UBXN1: Novel Target Genes Correlated with Prostate Cancer Gleason Score.', 'Comparative Cytotoxic Activity of Hydroxytyrosol and Its Semisynthetic Lipophilic Derivatives in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'miR-26b regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis of CD117+CD44+ ovarian cancer stem cells by targeting PTEN.', 'Estrogen Receptor Signaling Pathways Involved in Invasion and Colony Formation of Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells PC-3.']"""

Whether this reflects delayed diagnosis or direct smoking-related effects is unknown. REDUCE, which followed biopsy-negative men with protocol-dictated prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-independent biopsies at 2 and 4 years, provides an opportunity to evaluate smoking and prostate cancer diagnosis with minimal confounding from screening biases.  Experimental design:   Logistic regression was conducted to test the association between smoking and cancer on the first on-study biopsy (no cancer, low-grade Gleason 4-6, high-grade Gleason 7-10) in REDUCE.  Results:   Of 6,240 men with complete data and ≥1 on-study biopsy, 2,937 (45.8%) never smoked, 929 (14.5%) were current smokers, and 2,554 (39.8%) were former smokers. Among men with negative first on-study biopsies, smokers were 36% less likely to receive a second on-study biopsy (P < 0.001). At first on-study biopsy, 941 (14.7%) men had cancer. Both current and former smoking were not significantly associated with either total or low-grade prostate cancer (all P > 0.36). Current (OR = 1.44, P = 0.028) but not former smokers (OR = 1.21, P = 0.12) were at increased risk of high-grade disease. On secondary analysis, there was an interaction between smoking and body mass index (BMI; Pinteraction = 0.017): current smokers with BMI ≤ 25 kg/m(2) had an increased risk of low-grade (OR = 1.54, P = 0.043) and high-grade disease (OR = 2.45, P = 0.002), with null associations for BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2).  Conclusion:   Among men with elevated PSA and negative pre-study biopsy in REDUCE, in which biopsies were largely PSA independent, smoking was unrelated to overall prostate cancer diagnosis but was associated with increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer.""","""['Tammy Ho', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Adriana C Vidal', 'Leah Gerber', 'Daniel Moreira', 'Madeleine McKeever', 'Gerald Andriole', 'Ramiro Castro-Santamaria', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: REDUCE-ing the link between smoking and prostate cancer.', 'Metabolic syndrome-like components and prostate cancer risk: results from the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study.', 'Metformin use and risk of prostate cancer: results from the REDUCE study.', 'Serum cholesterol and risk of high-grade prostate cancer: results from the REDUCE study.', 'Smoking Is Associated with Acute and Chronic Prostatic Inflammation: Results from the REDUCE Study.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

New biomarkers would be welcome.  Objective:   To test the hypothesis that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA and its derivatives, percentage of p2PSA to free PSA (%p2PSA) and the Prostate Health Index (PHI), predict PCa characteristics at final pathology.  Design, setting, and participants:   An observational prospective multicentre European study was performed in 489 consecutive PCa patients treated with RP. Total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), and p2PSA levels were determined. The %fPSA [(fPSA / tPSA) × 100], %p2PSA [(p2PSA pg/ml) / (fPSA ng/ml × 1000) × 100], and PHI [(p2PSA / fPSA) × √tPSA] were calculated.  Intervention:   Open or robot-assisted RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression models were fitted to test the predictors of pT3 stage and/or pathologic Gleason score (GS) ≥7 and to determine their predictive accuracy. The base multivariable model included tPSA, digital rectal examination, biopsy GS, and percentage of positive biopsy cores. Decision curve analysis provided an estimate of the net benefit obtained using p2PSA, %p2PSA, or PHI.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 344 patients (70%) were affected by pT3 disease or pathologic GS ≥7; pT3 disease and pathologic GS ≥7 were present in 126 patients (26%). At univariable analysis, p2PSA, %p2PSA, and PHI were significant predictors of pT3 disease and/or pathologic GS ≥7 (all p ≤ 0.001). The inclusion of PHI significantly increased the accuracy of the base multivariable model by 2.3% (p=0.003) and 2.4% (p=0.01) for the prediction of pT3 disease and/or pathologic GS ≥7, respectively. However, at decision curve analysis, models including PHI did not show evidence of a greater clinical net benefit.  Conclusions:   Both %p2PSA and PHI are significant predictors of unfavourable PCa characteristics at final pathology; however, %p2PSA and PHI did not provide a greater net benefit for clinical decision making.

Moreover, blockage of the Nm23-H1/h-Prune interaction with a competitive permeable peptide (CPP) attenuates migration of breast and neuroblastoma cells. This series of events suggests that the Nm23-H1/h-Prune protein complex regulates cancer progression and that its specific impairment could be a new therapeutic strategy in oncology. We found that CPP leads to inhibition of the AKT/mTORv and NF-kBv signaling pathways and also activates apoptosis. To obtain a proof-of-concept of our hypothesis, we used a xenograft model of prostate cancer to evaluate whether impairment of this complex using CPP results in an anti-tumoral effect.

GR expression is stimulated by castration therapy, which has been proposed to be one mechanism that compensates for AR signaling blockade and promotes castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) progression. However, whether GR functions as a driver for CRPC or a marker reflecting AR activity remains unclear. Here, we applied PCa tissue microarrays to show that GR protein levels were elevated by castration therapy, but reduced to pre-castration levels when tumors were at the CRPC stage. Using subrenal capsule xenograft models, we showed that GR expression was inversely correlated with AR and PSA expressions. GR expression levels are not associated with tumor invasion and metastasis phenotypes. In castration-resistant C4-2 xenografts expressing AR shRNA, regressing tumors induced by AR knockdown expressed higher levels of GR and lower levels of PSA than non-regressing tumors. Immunoblotting and real-time PCR assays further showed that AR knockdown or AR antagonists increased GR expression at both mRNA and protein levels. ChIP combined with DNA sequencing techniques identified a negative androgen responsive element (nARE) 160K base pairs upstream of the GR gene.

Patients and methods:   Patients with extraprostatic extension (EPE) without positive margins, seminal vesicle or lymph node involvement were analysed from a consecutive radical prostatectomy cohort of 1136 (2002-2006) for: (i) distance of EPE from the margin; (ii) Gleason score of the EPE; and (iii) extent of EPE. Log-rank, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression analyses were performed.  Results:   The study included 194 pT3a, pN0, R0 patients with a median follow-up of 5.4 years, with 37 (19%) patients experiencing biochemical relapse (BCR). On univariable analysis, patients with a Gleason score of ≥8 in the extraprostatic portion showed increased incidence of BCR compared with those with Gleason scores of ≤7 (P = 0.03). The proximity of the EPE to the margin (0.01-7.5 mm) did not correlate with BCR. On multivariable analysis, the extent of EPE, the Gleason score of the dominant nodule or of the EPE portion did not correlate with BCR.  Conclusion:   Data from this study using current International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason scoring and EPE criteria indicate that close proximity of EPE to the margin is not associated with recurrence. Gleason score ≥8 within EPE is associated with an increased BCR risk on univariable analysis, but larger studies are required to confirm whether extensive Gleason pattern 4 in an EPE indicates increased risk in an otherwise overall Gleason score 7 cancer.""","""['Ruta Gupta', ""Rachel O'Connell"", 'Anne-Maree Haynes', 'Phillip D Stricker', 'Wade Barrett', 'Jennifer J Turner', 'Warick Delprado', 'Lisa G Horvath', 'James G Kench']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Quantification of extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: different parameters correlated to biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Biochemical recurrence rates are similar for pT2-positive surgical margins and pT3a.', 'High Gleason grade carcinoma at a positive surgical margin predicts biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy and may guide adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'Adverse prognostic significance of capsular incision with radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Is Extraprostatic Extension of Cancer Predictable?

It is important to accurately assess accumulated dose (DA) to the rectum in order to understand the relationship between dose and toxicity. The primary objective of this work was to quantify systematic (Σ) and random (σ) variation in the position of the rectum during a course of prostate radiotherapy.  Methods:   The rectum was manually outlined on the kilo-voltage planning scan and 37 daily mega-voltage image guidance scans for 10 participants recruited to the VoxTox study. The femoral heads were used to produce a fixed point to which all rectal contours were referenced.  Results:   Σ [standard deviation (SD) of means] between planning and treatment was 4.2 mm in the anteroposterior (AP) direction and 1.3 mm left-right (LR). σ (root mean square of SDs) was 5.2 mm AP and 2.7 mm LR. Superior-inferior variation was less than one slice above and below the planning position.  Conclusion:   Our results for Σ are in line with published data for prostate motion. σ, however, was approximately twice as great as that seen for prostate motion. This suggests that DA may differ from planned dose in some patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

Our objective was to analyse how anxiety and distress develop in men with untreated PC and whether highly anxious men quit AS.  Methods:   One hundred and fifty Dutch patients who opted for AS in the Prostate cancer Research International: Active Surveillance Study were invited to participate in an additional prospective, longitudinal quality of life (QoL) study within 6 months after diagnosis. Participants completed questionnaires with validated measures on anxiety and distress at inclusion (t = 0), 9 (t = 9) and 18 (t = 18) months after diagnosis. We assessed changes in scores on depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale), generic anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6)), PC-specific anxiety (Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC)) and decisional conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS)) about patients' treatment choice between t = 0, t = 9 and t = 18 using repeated measures analysis.  Results:   Response rates for patients still on AS at t = 0, t = 9 and t = 18 assessments were 86%, 90% and 96%, respectively. Nine patients (7%, 9/129) between t = 0 and t = 9 and 33 of 108 patients (31%) between t = 9 and t = 18 stopped AS, mostly (86%) because of protocol-based reasons. CES-D, total MAX-PC and DCS scores did not change significantly (p > 0.05) when comparing t = 18 with t = 9 and t = 0 scores, but generic anxiety (STAI-6; p = 0.033) and fear of disease progression (sub-score of the MAX-PC; p = 0.007) decreased significantly. These differences, however, were clinically modest (0.089 SD and 0.281 SD). Overall, six of 129 men (5%) discontinued AS because of anxiety and distress.  Conclusions:   When men with low-risk PC are managed with AS, fear of disease progression and general anxiety decreased, and only few may discontinue AS because of anxiety and distress. This suggests that negative QoL effects are limited in men with favourable clinical characteristics who opted for AS.

Our previous studies indicated that a complex of the GSLs (glycosphingolipids), AsGM1 (asialo-GM1), which lacks α2,3-linked sialic acid, and α2β1 integrin receptors is responsible for the metastatic behaviour of C4-2B prostate cancer cells. Herein, we identified and addressed the functional significance of changes in sialylation during prostate cancer progression. We observed an increase in α2,3-linked sialic acid residues on α2 subunits of α2β1 integrin receptors, correlating with increased gene expression of α2,3-STs (sialyltransferases), particularly ST3GAL3. Cell surface α2,3-sialylation of α2 subunits was required for the integrin α2β1-dependent cell adhesion to collagen type I and the same α2,3-linked sialic acid residues on the integrin receptor were responsible for the interaction with the carbohydrate moiety of AsGM1, explaining the complex formation between AsGM1 and α2β1 integrin receptors.

The aim of this study was to analytically validate the applicability of I-FISH in assessing 9p deletion in ccRCC and to clinically assess its long-term prognostic impact following surgical excision of ccRCC.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays were constructed from 108 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumour paraffin blocks. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridisation analysis was undertaken based on preset criteria by two independent observers to assess interobserver variability. 9p status in ccRCC tumours was determined and correlated to clinicopathological variables, recurrence-free survival and disease-specific survival.  Results:   There were 80 ccRCCs with valid 9p scoring and a median follow-up of 95 months. Kappa statistic for interobserver variability was 0.71 (good agreement). 9p deletion was detected in 44% of ccRCCs. 9p loss was associated with higher stage, larger tumours, necrosis, microvascular and renal vein invasion, and higher SSIGN (stage, size, grade and necrosis) score. Patients with 9p-deleted ccRCC were at a higher risk of recurrence (P=0.008) and RCC-specific mortality (P=0.001). On multivariate analysis, 9p deletion was an independent predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio 4.323; P=0.021) and RCC-specific mortality (hazard ratio 4.603; P=0.007). The predictive accuracy of SSIGN score improved from 87.7% to 93.1% by integrating 9p status to the model (P=0.001).  Conclusions:   Loss of 9p is associated with aggressive ccRCC and worse prognosis in patients following surgery.

Here, we investigated whether tumorigenesis in cancer-derived prostate epithelial cell lines influences protein kinase C-linked turnover of ethanolamine phosphoglycerides (EtnPGs) and alters the pattern of ethanolamine (Etn) metabolites released to the medium.  Methods:   Prostate epithelial cell lines P4E6, LNCaP and PC3 were models of prostate cancer (PCa). PNT2C2 and PNT1A were models of benign prostate epithelia. Cellular EtnPGs were labelled with [1-(3)H]-Etn hydrochloride. PKC was activated with phorbol ester (TPA) and inhibited with Ro31-8220 and GF109203X. D609 was used to inhibit PLD (phospholipase D). [(3)H]-labelled Etn metabolites were resolved by ion-exchange chromatography. Sodium oleate and mastoparan were tested as activators of PLD2. Phospholipase D activity was measured by a transphosphatidylation reaction. Cells were treated with ionomycin to raise intracellular Ca(2+) levels.  Results:   Unstimulated cell lines release mainly Etn and glycerylphosphorylEtn (GPEtn) to the medium. Phorbol ester treatment over 3h increased Etn metabolite release from the metastatic PC3 cell line and the benign cell lines PNT2C2 and PNT1A but not from the tumour-derived cell lines P4E6 and LNCaP; this effect was blocked by Ro31-8220 and GF109203X as well as by D609, which inhibited PLD in a transphosphatidylation reaction. Only metastatic PC3 cells specifically upregulated Etn release in response to TPA treatment. Oleate and mastoparan increased GPEtn release from all cell lines at the expense of Etn. Ionomycin stimulated GPEtn release from benign PNT2C2 cells but not from cancer-derived cell lines P4E6 or PC3. Ethanolamine did not stimulate the proliferation of LNCaP or PC3 cell lines but decreased the uptake of choline (Cho).  Conclusions:   Only the metastatic basal PC3 cell line specifically increased the release of Etn on TPA treatment most probably by PKC activation of PLD1 and increased turnover of EtnPGs. The phosphatidic acid formed will maintain a cancer phenotype through the regulation of mTOR. Ethanolamine released from cells may reduce Cho uptake, regulating the membrane PtdEtn:PtdCho ratio and influencing the action of PtdEtn-binding proteins such as RKIP and the anti-apoptotic hPEBP4.

Here we report that tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and circulating monocytes in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) express ligands for activating the Natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) receptor, which cause down-regulation of NKG2D on natural killer (NK) cells. Tumor-infiltrating NK cells isolated from GBM patients fail to lyse NKG2D ligand-expressing tumor cells. We demonstrate that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoform 5 secreted by glioblastoma cells induces NKG2D ligands on monocytes isolated from healthy individuals.

Methods:   Retrospective study including data from 2,483 clinical stage I (CSI) patients, 1,139 CSI nonseminoma and 1,344 CSI seminoma managed with active surveillance, with the majority treated between 1998 and 2010. Clinical outcomes including relapse and death, time distribution, extent of relapse and method of relapse detection observed on active surveillance were recorded.  Results:   Relapse occurred in 221 (19%) CSI-nonseminoma and 173 (13%) CSI-seminoma patients. Median time to relapse was 4 months (range, 2-61 months), 8 months (range, 2-77 months) and 14 months (range, 2-84 months) for lymphovascular invasion-positive CSI nonseminoma, lymphovascular invasion-negative CSI nonseminoma and CSI seminoma. Most relapses were observed within the first 2 years/3 years after orchiectomy for CSI nonseminoma (90%)/CSI seminoma (92%). Relapses were detected by computed tomography scan/tumor-markers in 87%/3% of seminoma recurrences, in 48%/38% of lymphovascular invasion-negative and 41%/61% of lymphovascular invasion-positive patients, respectively. 90% of CSI-nonseminoma and 99% of CSI-seminoma relapses exhibited International Germ Cell Collaborative Group good-risk features. Three patients with CSI nonseminoma died of disease (0.3%). One patient with CSI seminoma and two patients with CSI nonseminoma died because of treatment-related events. Overall, advanced disease was seen in both early- and late-relapse patients. All late recurrences were cured with standard therapy. Five-year disease-specific survival was 99.7% (95% CI, 99.24% to 99.93%).  Conclusion:   Active surveillance for CSI testis cancer leads to excellent outcomes. The vast majority of relapses occur within 2 years of orchiectomy for CSI nonseminoma and within 3 years for CSI seminoma. Late and advanced stage relapse are rarely seen.

The present study investigated the roles of Dicer and Ago2 in prostate cancer (Pca). First, the expression levels of Dicer and Ago2 in Pca tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and compared with pathological features. Next, RNA interference was used to down-regulate the expression levels of Dicer and Ago2 in the Pca cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145, and effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle were detected using the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. We found that Dicer and Ago2 expression levels in Pca tissues were higher than those in adjacent benign tissues and correlated with lower Gleason patterns, with the exception of Dicer expression in localized Pca. In vitro, silencing Dicer or Ago2 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145, as well as arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase in androgen-dependent LNCaP, or at S phase in the androgen-independent PC-3 and DU145.

Although it has been the subject of intensive research in other cancers, less is known about its significance in gliomas, including whether it is regulated by key driver mutations, has therapeutic potential against glioma stem cells (GSCs), and/or is a prognostic marker. We found that patient-derived gliomas with mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 have markedly lower Par-4 expression (P < 0.0001), which was validated by The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset (P = 2.0 E-13). The metabolic product of mutant IDH1, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), can suppress Par-4 transcription in vitro via inhibition of promoter activity as well as enhanced mRNA degradation, but interestingly not by direct DNA promoter hypermethylation. The Selective for Apoptosis induction in Cancer cells (SAC) domain within Par-4 is highly active against glioma cells, including orthotopic xenografts of patient-derived primary GSCs (P < 0.0001). Among high-grade gliomas that are IDH1 wild type, those that express more Par-4 have significantly longer median survival (18.4 vs. 8.0 months, P = 0.002), a finding confirmed in two external GBM cohorts. Together, these data suggest that Par-4 is a significant component of the mutant IDH1 phenotype, that the activity of 2-HG is complex and can extend beyond direct DNA hypermethylation, and that Par-4 is a promising therapeutic strategy against GSCs. Furthermore, not every effect of mutant IDH1 necessarily contributes to the overall favorable prognosis seen in such tumors; inhibition of Par-4 may be one such effect.""","""['Yinxing Liu', 'Misty R Gilbert', 'Natasha Kyprianou', 'Vivek M Rangnekar', 'Craig Horbinski']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Acta Neuropathol""","""['Identification of a Prognostic Hypoxia-Associated Gene Set in IDH-Mutant Glioma.', 'Mutant IDH1 and thrombosis in gliomas.', 'Epigenetic silencing of XAF1 in high-grade gliomas is associated with IDH1 status and improved clinical outcome.', 'Correlation between the prognostic value and the expression of the stem cell marker CD133 and isocitrate dehydrogenase1 in glioblastomas.', 'O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase gene promoter methylation status in gliomas and its correlation with other molecular alterations: first Indian report with review of challenges for use in customized treatment.', 'The regulatory mechanisms and inhibitors of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 in cancer.', 'Crizotinib induces Par-4 secretion from normal cells and GRP78 expression on the cancer cell surface for selective tumor growth inhibition.', 'Tumor Suppressor Par-4 Regulates Complement Factor C3 and Obesity.', 'Development of a novel prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) protein entity with an extended duration of action for therapeutic treatment of cancer.', 'Modeling the diffusion of D-2-hydroxyglutarate from IDH1 mutant gliomas in the central nervous system.']"""

The detailed mechanisms how T cells contribute to PCa progression, however, remained unclear. Here, we found PCa cells have a better capacity to recruit more CD4(+) T cells than the surrounding normal prostate cells via secreting more chemokines-CXCL9. The consequences of more recruited CD4(+) T cells to PCa might then lead to enhance PCa cell invasion. Mechanism dissection revealed that infiltrating CD4(+) T cells might function through the modulation of FGF11→miRNA-541 signals to suppress PCa androgen receptor (AR) signals. The suppressed AR signals might then alter the MMP9 signals to promote the PCa cell invasion. Importantly, suppressed AR signals via AR-siRNA or anti-androgen Enzalutamide in PCa cells also enhanced the recruitment of T cells and the consequences of this positive feed back regulation could then enhance the PCa cell invasion. Targeting these newly identified signals via FGF11-siRNA, miRNA-541 inhibitor or MMP9 inhibitor all led to partially reverse the enhanced PCa cell invasion. Results from in vivo mouse models also confirmed the in vitro cell lines in co-culture studies. Together, these results concluded that infiltrating CD4(+) T cells could promote PCa metastasis via modulation of FGF11→miRNA-541→AR→MMP9 signaling.

Despite this risk, practical and efficient methods for assessing these symptoms have not been established. We sought to determine if suicidal symptoms could be effectively and efficiently identified in a cohort of PC survivors, and whether these men were receptive to emotional health interventions.  Methods:   Six hundred fifty-six PC survivors, an average of 5 years post-diagnosis, completed eight self-report items about suicidal symptoms and behavior in the past 7 days, and 12 months, as well as medical utilization and interest in emotional health support.  Results:   Between 3.6 and 17.9% of PC survivors endorsed a single suicidal ideation item, and denied all other ideation. All survivors who endorsed serious suicidal ideation/behavior also endorsed either passive or active ideation. 58.3% of survivors denied any suicidal symptoms within the past week, but endorsed it within the past year. Most survivors had medical provider contact within the past year and were open to receiving information about emotional health interventions.  Conclusions:   Suicidal ideation in PC survivors cannot be accurately evaluated using only a one-item screen, or by inquiring within a single time frame.  Implications for cancer survivors:   In both research and clinical settings, the evaluation for suicidal ideation in PC survivors should utilize multiple questions, across several time periods. It is possible to skip queries about serious ideation/behavior if passive or active ideation is denied.

Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis of patients' medical records between 2007 and 2012 was performed. A total of 102 patients who underwent SP (n = 44) or BP-TURP [Gyrus Plasma Kinetic™ (Gyrus ACMI, USA)] (n = 58) for obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPE were included in this retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were age ≥65 years, prostate volume ≥100 g, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) ≥18, and peak urinary flow rate (PFR) ≤15 ml/s. Exclusion criteria were urethral stricture, known history of neurogenic bladder due to neural disorders, previous prostate and/or urethral surgery, bladder stone, bladder cancer, and known prostate cancer. Operation time, hospitalization, and catheter removal times were noted. Patients were re-evaluated at postoperative 3rd and 12th months. Evaluated parameters were IPSS, quality of life (QoL), simplified International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), PFR, post-voiding residual urinary volume (PVR). Statistical significance was set at 0.05 and all tests were two-tailed.  Results:   Preoperative IPSS, PVR, IIEF-5, QoL, and prostate volume were not statistically significantly different between two groups except for PFR. Mean follow-up for BP-TURP and SP groups were 15.0 ± 5.8 (R: 11-38), 22.1 ± 11.2 (R: 11-59) months, respectively (p < 0.001). When compared with SP, mean catheter removal time (p < 0.001) and median hospitalization time (p < 0.001) were significantly shorter in BP-TURP group. However, mean operative time was significantly (p < 0.001) longer than SP group and also median resected material weight was significantly lower in the BP-TURP group (p < 0.001). IPSS, QoL, PFR, PVR, and IIEF-5 scores at postoperative 3rd and 12th month were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). Thirty-three patients had perioperative complications according to the modified Clavien-Dindo system. Thirteen patients (22.4 %) in BP-TURP group and 20 patients (45.4 %) in SP group had complications. In 12th month follow-up visit, four patients presented with urethral stricture, three patients (5.1 %) were in BP-TURP group, and one patient (2.3 %) in SP group (p = 0.455). All strictures were treated with internal urethrotomy.  Conclusions:   BP-TURP is a safe and highly effective treatment modality for BPE in the elderly patients with prostate glands over 100 g. Clinical efficacy and postoperative 12th month's results were similar to SP. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed in order to confirm our findings.""","""['Enis Rauf Coskuner', 'Tayyar Alp Ozkan', 'Sefik Koprulu', 'Ozdal Dillioglugil', 'Ibrahim Cevik']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Re: The Role of the Bipolar PlasmaKinetic TURP over 100 g Prostate in the Elderly Patients.', 'Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of Transurethral Resection of the Prostate versus Plasmakinetic Enucleation of the Prostate in the Treatment of Massive Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Clinical comparison of two minimal invasive techniques in the treatment of benign prostatic enlargement over 90 ml: BIVAP (Richard Wolf®) saline vaporization of the prostate vs. bipolar plasmakinetic TURP.', 'Vapor resection: a good alternative to standard loop resection in the management of prostates >40 cc.', 'Randomised evaluation of alternative electrosurgical modalities to treat bladder outflow obstruction in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Monopolar transurethral resection of the big prostate, experience at Prince Hussein Bin Abdullah Urology Center.', 'Bipolar vaporization of the prostate may cause higher complication rates compared to bipolar loop resection: a randomized prospective trial.', 'A Novel Technique for Post-Prostatectomy Catheter Traction.', 'The impact of surgical treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia on male erectile function: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Is an adjustment by transurethral surgery simultaneously needed during the suprapubic open prostatectomy?']"""

Stratified biochemical progression-free survival has increasingly been reported within these groups on analyses of primary-secondary patterns (PSPs) (e.g., 3+4 vs. 4+3) and overall GS (e.g., 8 vs. 9 vs. 10) but with limited data regarding stratified survival outcomes. In this analysis, outcomes for biopsy-assigned GS 6 to 10 were comprehensively evaluated to identify stratifications prognostic for survival in patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was examined for T1-4 N0 M0, GS 6 to 10 PCa managed with EBRT alone from 2004 to 2006. GS and PSP variations were analyzed for PCa-specific survival (PCSS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Overall, 26,885 patients were evaluated. Preliminary PSP analyses identified stratifications for 3+4 vs. 4+3 = 7 and 4+4 = 8 vs. GS 8 with pattern 5 (P5) (i.e., 3+5 and 5+3) as significant; however, no differences were observed for 4+5 vs. 5+4 = 9. The primary analysis included stratifications for GS 6, 3+4, 4+3, 4+4, 8 w/P5, 9, and 10, where the 7.5-year PCSS rates were 99%, 97%, 95%, 91%, 86%, 81%, and 78% and 7.5-year OS rates were 83%, 76%, 72%, 67%, 66%, 58%, and 54%, respectively. PCSS differences for sequential score increases were all significant on univariate analyses (all P<0.05). In sequential multivariate analyses of PCSS accounting for age, prostate-specific antigen, T stage, year, marital status, race, and tumor registry, the identified GS stratifications remained significant (all P<0.05), with the exception of GS 8 w/P5 vs. 9 (P = 0.11). In overall multivariate analyses, the identified GS stratifications represented the strongest prognostic factor for survival. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that presence of any P5 was an independent prognostic factor for survival.  Conclusion:   In the largest reported survival analysis of Gleason stratifications, biopsy-assigned GS 6, 3+4, 4+3, 4+4, 8 w/P5, 9, and 10 represented sequential prognostic factors for survival in patients managed with definitive EBRT.""","""['Chad G Rusthoven', 'Timothy V Waxweiler', 'Peter E DeWitt', 'Thomas W Flaig', 'David Raben', 'Brian D Kavanagh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['The prognostic significance of Gleason scores in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Effects of perineural invasion on biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer-specific survival in patients treated with definitive external beam radiotherapy.', 'Year of treatment as independent predictor of relapse-free survival in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy in the PSA era.', 'The impact of brachytherapy on prostate cancer-specific mortality for definitive radiation therapy of high-grade prostate cancer: a population-based analysis.', 'Comparative Effectiveness of Therapies for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Internet.', 'Prognostic differences among Grade Group 4 subgroups in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Gleason pattern 5 is associated with an increased risk for metastasis following androgen deprivation therapy and radiation: An analysis of RTOG 9202 and 9902.', 'The validation of the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading system for patients with high-risk prostate cancer: a single-center retrospective study.', 'Consensus statements on the management of clinically localized prostate cancer from the Hong Kong Urological Association and the Hong Kong Society of Uro-Oncology.', 'Survival after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for locally advanced (cT3) prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Trainees in our simulator program were practicing radiation oncologists, radiation oncology residents, and fellows of the American Brachytherapy Society. The program emphasized 6 core areas of quality assurance: patient selection, simulation, treatment planning, implant technique, treatment evaluation, and outcome assessment. Using the Iodine 125 ((125)I) preoperative treatment planning technique, trainees implanted their ultrasound phantoms with dummy seeds (ie, seeds with no activity). Pre- and postimplant dosimetric parameters were compared and correlated using regression analysis.  Results:   Thirty-one trainees successfully completed the simulator program during the period under study. The mean phantom prostate size, number of seeds used, and total activity were generally consistent between trainees. All trainees met the V100 >95% objective both before and after implantation. Regardless of the initial volume of the prostate phantom, trainees' ability to cover the target volume with at least 100% of the dose (V100) was not compromised (R=0.99 pre- and postimplant). However, the V150 had lower concordance (R=0.37) and may better reflect heterogeneity control of the implant process.  Conclusions:   Analysis of implants from this phantom-based simulator shows a high degree of consistency between trainees and uniformly high-quality implants with respect to parameters used in clinical practice.

Methods and materials:   From 1998 to 2009, 2709 patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network-defined low-risk and low-tier intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated with Iodine 125 ((125)I) low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy; 2011 patients with a minimum of 25 months of follow-up were included in the study. Baseline patients, treatment, implant factors, and late urinary toxicity (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] grading system and International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS]) were recorded prospectively. Time to IPSS resolution, late RTOG genitourinary toxicity was examined with Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards regression was done for individual covariates and multivariable models.  Results:   Median follow-up was 54.5 months (range, 2-13 years). Actuarial toxicity rates reached 27% and 10% (RTOG ≥2 and ≥3, respectively) at 9-13 years. Symptoms resolved quickly in the majority of patients (88% in 6-12 months). The prevalence of RTOG 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 toxicity with a minimum of 7 years' follow-up was 70%, 21%, 6.4%, 2.3%, and 0.08%, respectively. Patients with a larger prostate volume, higher baseline IPSS, higher D90, acute toxicity, and age >70 years had more late RTOG ≥2 toxicity (all P≤.02). The IPSS resolved slower in patients with lower baseline IPSS and larger ultrasound prostate volume, those not receiving androgen deprivation therapy, and those with higher D90.

Traditionally, electrons have been used for the treatment of fairly superficial lesions located at depths of no more than 4cm inside the patient, but lately it has been proposed that by using very high energy electrons, i.e. those with an energy in the order of 200-250MeV it should be possible to safely reach deeper targets. In this paper, we used a realistic patient model coupled with detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the electron transport in such a patient model to examine the characteristics of the resultant absorbed dose distributions as a function of both the electron beam energy as well as the number of beams for a particular type of treatment, namely, a prostate radiotherapy treatment. Each treatment is modeled as consisting of nine, five or three beam ports isocentrically distributed around the patient. An optimization algorithm is then applied to obtain the beam weights in each treatment plan. It is shown that for this particularly challenging case, both excellent target coverage and critical structure sparing can be obtained for energies in the order of 150MeV and for as few as three treatment ports, while significantly reducing the total energy absorbed by the patient with respect to a conventional megavoltage x-ray treatment.""","""['H M Garnica-Garza']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Appl Radiat Isot""","""['Treatment planning for laser-accelerated very-high energy electrons.', 'Treatment planning for radiotherapy with very high-energy electron beams and comparison of VHEE and VMAT plans.', 'Influence of initial electron beam parameters on Monte Carlo calculated absorbed dose distributions for radiotherapy photon beams.', 'Very high energy electrons (50-250 MeV) and radiation therapy.', 'The Exploitation of Low-Energy Electrons in Cancer Treatment.']"""

To date, there are no efficient morphologic features or genomic biomarkers that can characterize the phenotypes of the cancer, especially with regard to metastasis--the most adverse outcome. Searching for effective surrogate genes out of large quantities of gene expression data is a key to cancer phenotyping and/or understanding molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer development.  Results:   Using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) method on microarray data from normal tissues, primary tumors and metastatic tumors, we identifed four genes that can optimally classify samples of different prostate cancer phases. Moreover, we constructed a molecular interaction network with existing bioinformatic resources and co-identifed eight genes on the shortest-paths among the mRMR-identified genes, which are potential co-acting factors of prostate cancer. Functional analyses show that molecular functions involved in cell communication, hormone-receptor mediated signaling, and transcription regulation play important roles in the development of prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   We conclude that the surrogate genes we have selected compose an effective classifier of prostate cancer phases, which corresponds to a minimum characterization of cancer phenotypes on the molecular level.

No comparison of the four-kallikrein panel and PHI has been presented.  Objective:   To compare the four-kallikrein panel and PHI for predicting PCa in an independent cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   Participants were from a population-based cohort of PSA-tested men in Stockholm County. We included 531 men with PSA levels between 3 and 15 ng/ml undergoing first-time prostate biopsy during 2010-2012.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Models were fitted to case status. We computed calibration curves, the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC), decision curves, and percentage of saved biopsies.  Results and limitations:   The four-kallikrein panel showed AUCs of 69.0 when predicting any-grade PCa and 71.8 when predicting high-grade cancer (Gleason score ≥7). Similar values were found for PHI: 70.4 and 71.1, respectively. Both models had higher AUCs than a base model with PSA value and age (p<0.0001 for both); differences between models were not significant. Sensitivity analyses including men with any PSA level or a previous biopsy did not materially affect our findings. Using 10% predicted risk of high-grade PCa by the four-kallikrein panel or PHI of 39 as cut-off for biopsy saved 29% of performed biopsies at a cost of delayed diagnosis for 10% of the men with high-grade cancers. Both models showed limited net benefit in decision analysis. The main study limitation was lack of digital rectal examination data and biopsy decision being based on PSA information.  Conclusions:   The four-kallikrein panel and PHI similarly improved discrimination when predicting PCa and high-grade PCa. Both are simple blood tests that can reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies compared with screening with total PSA, representing an important new option to reduce harm.  Patient summary:   Prostate-specific antigen screening is controversial due to limitations of the test. We found that two blood tests, the Prostate Health Index and the four-kallikrein panel, performed similarly and could both aid in decision making among Swedish men undergoing a prostate biopsy.""","""['Tobias Nordström', 'Andrew Vickers', 'Melissa Assel', 'Hans Lilja', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Martin Eklund']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Tobias Nordström, Andrew Vickers, Melissa Assel, Hans Lilja, Henrik Grönberg, Martin Eklund.

This preclinical study evaluates targeting of Akt with AZD5363 alone and in combination with enzalutamide (ENZ) to prevent and delay resistance. Our results demonstrate AZD5363 has significant proapoptotic, antiproliferative activity as monotherapy in ENZ-resistant cell lines in vitro and significantly decreased tumour growth in ENZ-resistant xenograft. The combination of AZD5363 and ENZ showed synergistic decreases in cell proliferation and induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2. Notably, the combination of AZD5363 and ENZ resulted in an impressive regression of castrate-resistant LNCaP xenograft tumours without any recurrence demonstrated, whereas progression occurred with both monotherapies. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were also continuously suppressed, and nadir PSA levels were lower in the combination arm compared to ENZ alone. Combination AZD5363 and ENZ at time of castration similarly resulted in significant regression of tumours, with greater relative suppression of PSA compared to when administered to castrate-resistant xenografts. In summary, combination AZD5363 and ENZ significantly delays the development of ENZ resistance in preclinical models through synergistic increases in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Our results also suggest greater efficacy may be seen with earlier combination treatment. This study provides preclinical data to support evaluation of combination targeting of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the androgen-receptor axis in the clinic using AZD5363 and ENZ, respectively.  Patient summary:   Targeting of the Akt and androgen receptor pathways with AZD5363 and enzalutamide, respectively, significantly delayed the development of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer through increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

However, random rebiopsies may not resample areas of concern. Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy offers an opportunity to accurately target and later retarget specific areas in the prostate. We describe the ability of magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided prostate biopsy to detect prostate cancer in areas with an initial diagnosis of atypical small acinar proliferation.  Materials and methods:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate and magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy were performed in 1,028 patients from March 2007 to February 2014. Of the men 20 met the stringent study inclusion criteria, which were no prostate cancer history, index biopsy showing at least 1 core of atypical small acinar proliferation with benign glands in all remaining cores and fusion targeted rebiopsy with at least 1 targeted core directly resampling an area of the prostate that previously contained atypical small acinar proliferation.  Results:   At index biopsy median age of the 20 patients was 60 years (IQR 57-64) and median prostate specific antigen was 5.92 ng/ml (IQR 3.34-7.48). At fusion targeted rebiopsy at a median of 11.6 months 5 of 20 patients (25%, 95% CI 6.02-43.98) were diagnosed with primary Gleason grade 3, low volume prostate cancer. On fusion rebiopsy cores that directly retargeted areas of previous atypical small acinar proliferation detected the highest tumor burden.

We describe our initial clinical experience with this system.  Materials and methods:   After an evaluation in a canine model, 20 patients were enrolled in the study. During each procedure the transrectal ultrasound transducer was manually positioned using a brachytherapy stabilizer to provide good imaging of the prostate. Then the transrectal ultrasound was registered to the da Vinci robot by a previously validated procedure. Finally, automatic rotation of the transrectal ultrasound was enabled such that the transrectal ultrasound imaging plane safely tracked the tip of the da Vinci instrument controlled by the surgeon, while real-time transrectal ultrasound images were relayed to the surgeon at the da Vinci console. Tracking was activated during all critical stages of the surgery.  Results:   The transrectal ultrasound robot was easy to set up and use, adding 7 minutes (range 5 to 14) to the procedure. It did not require an assistant or additional control devices. Qualitative feedback was acquired from the surgeons, who found transrectal ultrasound useful in identifying the urethra while passing the dorsal venous complex suture, defining the prostate-bladder interface during bladder neck dissection, identifying the seminal vesicles and their location with respect to the rectal wall, and identifying the distal prostate boundary at the apex.  Conclusions:   Real-time, registered robotic transrectal ultrasound guidance with automatic instrument tracking during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is feasible and potentially useful.

Median patient age was 64 years and median prostate specific antigen was 8.9 ng/ml. Clinical stage was cT1 in 93 cases (84%) and cT2 in 18 (16%). Postoperative pathological analysis confirmed pT2 in 71 patients (64%) and pT3 in 40 (36%). We evaluated 1) in the radical prostatectomy specimen the correlation of microscopic extracapsular extension with pathological cancer volume, pathological tumor contact length and Gleason score, 2) the correlation between microscopic extracapsular extension and magnetic resonance imaging tumor contact length, and 3) the ability of preoperative variables to predict microscopic extracapsular extension.  Results:   Logistic regression analysis revealed that pathological tumor contact length correlated better with microscopic extracapsular extension than the predictive power of pathological cancer volume (0.821 vs 0.685). The Spearman correlation between pathological and magnetic resonance imaging tumor contact length was r = 0.839 (p <0.0001). ROC AUC analysis revealed that magnetic resonance imaging tumor contact length outperformed cancer core involvement on targeted biopsy and the Partin tables to predict microscopic extracapsular extension (0.88 vs 0.70 and 0.63, respectively). At a magnetic resonance imaging tumor contact length threshold of 20 mm the accuracy for diagnosing microscopic extracapsular extension was superior to that of conventional magnetic resonance imaging criteria (82% vs 67%, p = 0.015).

Daily treatment decision making should be led also by institutional experiences with toxicity evaluation. We evaluated survival and toxicity outcomes of 47 consecutive patients who underwent adjuvant chemoradiation in our institution in the years 2006-2009. 45Gy in 5 weeks with concurrent two cycles of FUFA Mayo regimen chemotherapy were administrated as part of combined treatment. The acute toxicity was relatively mild (CTCAE scale): grade 2 nausea in 26%, vomiting in 13%, and diarrhoea grade 1 in 15% and general abdominal discomfort in 57% of patients. Grade 3 haematological and infectious complications in 6% and 2% respectively.

The Kaplan- Meier estimate of the median overall survival was 30.5 months with median 25.7 months disease free survival. The overall survival was statistically significantly affected by the amount of removed positive lymph nodes.

Cytokines, such as IL1β, IL8, and IL10, may suppress anticancer immunity. Thus, we prospectively evaluated the association between peripheral-cytokine concentrations and prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted an age-race matched case-control study (268 pairs) of incident prostate cancer in CLUE-II. We measured plasma IFNγ, IL10, IL12p70, IL1β, IL6, IL8, and TNFα concentrations using an ultrasensitive multiplex kit. ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression.  Results:   The OR of prostate cancer decreased across quartiles of IFNγ (highest vs. lowest quartiles: OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30-0.81; Ptrend = 0.006), TNFα (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.96; Ptrend = 0.01), and IL6 (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.79; Ptrend = 0.007). Higher TNFα (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.09-0.85; Ptrend = 0.01) and IL6 (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06-0.67; Ptrend = 0.003) concentrations were associated with lower Gleason sum ≥7 disease risk. Other cytokines were not as clearly associated with risk.  Conclusions:   Men with a prediagnostic circulating TH1 profile and higher IL6 may have a lower risk of prostate cancer, including aggressive disease. Whether this profile reflects (i) an intraprostatic immune environment in benign tissue that protects against prostate cancer, (ii) the immune milieu in response to a prostate adenocarcinoma that inhibits tumor growth and detectability, and/or (iii) a systemic immune profile that mediates the influence of modifiable factors on risk, warrants additional study.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process in tumor progression during which cancer cells undergo dramatic changes acquiring highly invasive properties. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of quercetin on EGF-induced EMT in prostate cancer (PC-3) cell line. Quercetin, a plant flavonoid, prevented EGF-induced invasion and migration of PC-3 cells. The protein and mRNA expressions of E-cadherin and N-cadherin were studied by immunocytochemistry, Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Quercetin prevented EGF-induced expression of N-cadherin and vimentin and increased the expression of E-cadherin in PC-3 cells, therefore preventing EGF-induced EMT. EGF-induced cell adhesion proteins, intercellular adhesion molecule and vascular cell adhesion molecule were significantly decreased by quercetin treatment. Furthermore, mRNA and protein expressions of Snail, Slug and Twist showed that quercetin significantly decreased EGF-induced expressions of Snail, Slug and Twist. The protein expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 pathway showed that quercetin prevents EGF-induced EMT via EGFR/PI3k/Akt/ERK1/2 pathway and by suppressing transcriptional repressors Snail, Slug and Twist in PC-3 cells.

The aim of this study was to examine the potential CYP17A1 activity including 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in human CRPC and the effect of a CYP17A inhibitor. We used three human CRPC cell lines: C4-2 and C4-2AT6 which was established from C4-2 under androgen ablation conditions for 6months, and PC3. To ascertain the potential CYP17A1 activity, we cultured with the steroid precursors: (13)C-[2,3,4]-progesterone (13C-Prog), and analyzed the sequential biosynthesis (13)C-[2,3,4]-17-hydroxyprogesterone (13C-17OHP) and (13)C-[2,3,4]-androstenedione(13C-Adione) by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).The C4-2AT6 cells showed significantly higher CYP17A1 expression than C4-2 cells (p<0.001). LC/MS/MS analysis enabled us to detect the 13C-17-OHP and 13C-A-dione in these cell lines. The concentration ratio of 13C-Adione/13C-17OHP (Adione-17OHP ratio), which is thought to reflect the differences between 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities, was then determined. The Adione-17OHP ratio in C4-2AT6 cells was significantly higher than that of C4-2 cells (p<0.001). Abiraterone were able to inhibit the CYP17A activities, although abiraterone did not have anti-proliferative effects on C4-2 and C4-2AT6 cells at clinically achievable concentrations of <1000nM in vitro.

The aim of the study was to provide estimates of indicators of long-term survival and cure for 26 cancer types, presently lacking.  Patients and methods:   Data on 818 902 Italian cancer patients diagnosed at age 15-74 years in 1985-2005 were included. Proportions of patients with the same death rates of the general population (cure fractions) and those of prevalent patients who were not at risk of dying as a result of cancer (cure prevalence) were calculated, using validated mixture cure models, by cancer type, sex, and age group. We also estimated complete prevalence, conditional relative survival (CRS), time to reach 5- and 10-year CRS >95%, and proportion of patients living longer than those thresholds.  Results:   The cure fractions ranged from >90% for patients aged <45 years with thyroid and testis cancers to <10% for liver and pancreatic cancers of all ages. Five- or 10-year CRS >95% were both reached in <10 years by patients with cancers of the stomach, colon-rectum, pancreas, corpus and cervix uteri, brain, and Hodgkin lymphoma. For breast cancer patients, 5- and 10-year CRSs reached >95% after 19 and 25 years, respectively, and in 15 and 18 years for prostate cancer patients. Five-year CRS remained <95% for >25 years after cancer diagnosis in patients with liver and larynx cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, and leukaemia. Overall, the cure prevalence was 67% for men and 77% for women. Therefore, 21% of male and 31% of female patients had already reached 5-year CRS >95%, whereas 18% and 25% had reached 10-year CRS >95%.

In this report, we demonstrate that DU145-derived prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) progress slowly with more cells accumulating in the G1 phase in comparison to DU145 non-PCSCs. Consistent with the important role of the AKT pathway in promoting G1 progression, DU145 PCSCs were less sensitive to growth factor-induced activation of AKT in comparison to non-PCSCs. In response to etoposide (one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs), DU145 PCSCs survived significantly better than non-PCSCs. In addition to etoposide, PCSCs demonstrated increased resistance to docetaxel, a taxane drug that is commonly used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. Etoposide produced elevated levels of γH2AX and triggered a robust G2/M arrest along with a coordinated reduction of the G1 population in PCSCs compared to non-PCSCs, suggesting that elevated γH2AX plays a role in the resistance of PCSCs to etoposide-induced cytotoxicity. We have generated xenograft tumors from DU145 PCSCs and non-PCSCs. Consistent with the knowledge that PCSCs produce xenograft tumors with more advanced features, we were able to demonstrate that PCSC-derived xenograft tumors displayed higher levels of γH2AX and p-CHK1 compared to non-PCSC-produced xenograft tumors.

However, the biological mechanism underlying this regulation is not well understood. Here, we developed a chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based multi-target sequencing technology and systematically examined three PC risk regions at the 8q24 locus and their potential regulatory targets across human genome in six cell lines. We observed frequent physical contacts of this risk locus with multiple genomic regions, in particular, inter-chromosomal interaction with CD96 at 3q13 and intra-chromosomal interaction with MYC at 8q24. We identified at least five interaction hot spots within the predicted functional regulatory elements at the 8q24 risk locus. We also found intra-chromosomal interaction genes PVT1, FAM84B and GSDMC and inter-chromosomal interaction gene CXorf36 in most of the six cell lines. Other gene regions appeared to be cell line-specific, such as RRP12 in LNCaP, USP14 in DU-145 and SMIN3 in lymphoblastoid cell line. We further found that the 8q24 functional domains more likely interacted with genomic regions containing genes enriched in critical pathways such as Wnt signaling and promoter motifs such as E2F1 and TCF3.

These studies examined the effects of selective PDE4D inhibitors, NVP-ABE171 and cilomilast, as anti-prostate cancer therapies in both in vitro and in vivo models. The effects of PDE4D inhibitors on pathways that are critical in prostate cancer and/or downstream of cyclic AMP (cAMP) were examined. Both NVP-ABE171 and cilomilast decreased cell growth. In vitro, PDE4D inhibitors lead to decreased signaling of the sonic hedgehog (SHH), androgen receptor (AR), and MAPK pathways, but growth inhibition was best correlated to the SHH pathway. PDE4D inhibition also reduced proliferation of epithelial cells induced by paracrine signaling from cocultured stromal cells that had activated hedgehog signaling. In addition, PDE4D inhibitors decreased the weight of the prostate in wild-type mice. Prostate cancer xenografts grown in nude mice that were treated with cilomilast or NVP-ABE171 had decreased wet weight and increased apoptosis compared with vehicle-treated controls.

Participants were divided into 7 groups based on cancer type, including breast cancer (BC, n = 170), prostate cancer and other male urogenital neoplasia (PC, n = 38), hematological malignancies (HM, n = 34), colorectal cancer (CC, n = 25), gynecological cancers (GC, n = 20), glandular and epithelial neoplasms (GEN, n = 20), and lung cancer (LC, n = 12). All participants completed an individualized, multimodal exercise intervention consisting of cardiorespiratory, flexibility, balance, and muscular strength training 3 days per week for 3 months. Following the intervention, all subjects were reassessed. Generalized Estimating Equations with exchangeable working correlation structure was used to model each response; the group by time interaction effect represented the effect of cancer type on exercise-associated improvements.  Results:   No significant (P > .05) group by time interaction effects were observed between different types of cancer for any parameter. Pre- to postexercise contrasts revealed significant improvements in VO2 peak in BC, PC, HM, and GEN at the Bonferroni adjusted significance level (.00714). Heart rate was significantly lowered in the BC and CC groups. Mean fatigue indices decreased by at least 17% in all groups, but these changes were only significant in the BC, HM, CC, and GC groups. Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in BC and GC, and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly only in the BC group while pulmonary function remained unchanged in all cancer types.  Conclusion:   Although trends toward improved cardiorespiratory and fatigue parameters only reached significance in some groups, there were no significant differences between cancer types. This suggests that cardiorespiratory and fatigue improvements following rehabilitative exercise are not dependent on cancer type. Further research investigating alternative physiological parameters are needed to confirm the relationship between cancer type and exercise-mediated rehabilitation.""","""['Chris P Repka', 'Brent M Peterson', 'Jessica M Brown', 'Trent L Lalonde', 'Carole M Schneider', 'Reid Hayward']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['Exercise training manages cardiopulmonary function and fatigue during and following cancer treatment in male cancer survivors.', 'Effect of low-intensity continuous training on lung function and cardiorespiratory fitness in both cigarette and hookah smokers.', 'Effects of a supervised exercise intervention on recovery from treatment regimens in breast cancer survivors.', 'Cardiac reinnervation affects cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise training in individuals with heart transplantation.', 'A model program: exercise intervention for cancer rehabilitation.', 'Relationships between Physiological and Self-Reported Assessment of Cancer-Related Fatigue.', 'Influencing Factors of Physical Activity in Patients with Lung Cancer Surgery and Its Correlation with Exercise Self-Efficacy and Perceived Social Support.', 'Heart Rate Variability and Cardiovascular Adaptations Among Cancer-Survivors Following a 26-Week Exercise Intervention.', 'Roles and molecular mechanisms of physical exercise in cancer prevention and treatment.', 'Ease of walking associates with greater free-living physical activity and reduced depressive symptomology in breast cancer survivors: pilot randomized trial.']"""

When genes interact with each other during cellular processes, they may form differential co-expression patterns with other genes across different cell states. The identification of condition-specific sub-networks is of great importance in investigating how a living cell adapts to environmental changes. In this work, we propose the weighted MAXimum clique (WMAXC) method to identify a condition-specific sub-network. WMAXC first proposes scoring functions that jointly measure condition-specific changes to both individual genes and gene-gene co-expressions. It then employs a weaker formula of a general maximum clique problem and relates the maximum scored clique of a weighted graph to the optimization of a quadratic objective function under sparsity constraints. We combine a continuous genetic algorithm and a projection procedure to obtain a single optimal sub-network that maximizes the objective function (scoring function) over the standard simplex (sparsity constraints). We applied the WMAXC method to both simulated data and real data sets of ovarian and prostate cancer. Compared with previous methods, WMAXC selected a large fraction of cancer-related genes, which were enriched in cancer-related pathways. The results demonstrated that our method efficiently captured a subset of genes relevant under the investigated condition.""","""['Bayarbaatar Amgalan', 'Hyunju Lee']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['COSINE: COndition-SpecIfic sub-NEtwork identification using a global optimization method.', 'BMRF-MI: integrative identification of protein interaction network by modeling the gene dependency.', 'Feature selection with the Fisher score followed by the Maximal Clique Centrality algorithm can accurately identify the hub genes of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Exploring pathways from gene co-expression to network dynamics.', 'Integration, visualization and analysis of human interactome.', 'Evolutionarily conserved gene expression patterns for affective disorders revealed\xa0using cross-species brain transcriptomic analyses in humans, rats and zebrafish.', 'Temporal and sequential order of nonoverlapping gene networks unraveled in mated female Drosophila.', 'NetMix: A Network-Structured Mixture Model for Reduced-Bias Estimation of Altered Subnetworks.', 'Differential Co-Expression Analyses Allow the Identification of Critical Signalling Pathways Altered during Tumour Transformation and Progression.', 'Functional module detection through integration of single-cell RNA sequencing data with protein-protein interaction networks.']"""

ADC maps were generated by two different methods: two-point b values (0 and 1000 s/mm(2)) and multipoint b values (0, 100, 300, 700, and 1000 s/mm(2)). Two independent readers measured ADC in the cancers, benign peripheral zone and transition zone, and obturator internus muscle. Statistical analyses were performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), correlation of variation (CV), Bland-Altman test, and paired Student t test.  Results:   The intermethod ADC calculation revealed excellent reliability for all tissues in both readers: cancer (ICC = 0.979-0.981), transition zone (0.989-0.993), peripheral zone (0.990-0.994), and obturator internus muscle (0.967-0.975). In both readers, the variability of the intermethod ADC calculation was 2.90-3.09% CV in cancer, 1.16-1.48% CV in the transition zone, 1.03-1.29% CV in the peripheral zone, and 2.44-2.62% CV in the obturator internus muscle. For interreader variability, the CVs of ADC calculation for two-point versus multipoint b value analyses in all tissues were 7.21-9.65% versus 7.18-9.01%.

Subjects and methods:   Between November 2010 and April 2012, 40 patients with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer were prospectively recruited. MR images were obtained at 3 T with a phased-array coil. Two independent readers scored the T2-weighted images alone and then in combination with DW images. ROIs were drawn on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and histogram-derived values were calculated. Whole-mount histopathologic examination was the standard of reference. Reader performance was analyzed, and differences in patient characteristics and histogram-based ADC values, according to ECE status, were evaluated.  Results:   ECE was present in 23 of 40 (58%) patients and 23 of 43 (53%) tumors. The sensitivity for side-specific ECE detection significantly increased, from 0.22 to 0.44 for reader 1 and 0.33 to 0.82 for reader 2 (both p < 0.05) without a significant change in specificity for either reader with the addition of DWI and ADC mapping.

The current standard for calculation of dose around brachytherapy sources is based on the AAPM TG-43 formalism, which generates the dose in a homogeneous water medium. Recently, AAPM TG-186 emphasized the importance of accounting for tissue heterogeneities. We have previously reported on a methodology where the absorbed dose in tissue can be obtained by multiplying the dose, calculated by the TG-43 formalism, by an inhomogeneity correction factor (ICF). In this work we make use of dual energy CT (DECT) images to extract ICF parameters. The advantage of DECT over conventional CT is that it eliminates the need for tissue segmentation as well as assignment of population based atomic compositions. DECT images of a heterogeneous phantom were acquired and the dose was calculated using both TG-43 and TG-43 [Formula: see text] formalisms. The results were compared to experimental measurements using Gafchromic films in the mid-plane of the phantom.

We aimed at exploring variation in prostate cancer mortality in the language regions of Switzerland as a function of ""Italianity"", a proxy for adherence to an Italian lifestyle.  Methods:   We used data of the Swiss National Cohort, a census-based record linkage study, consisting of census (1990 and 2000) and mortality (until 2008) data. 1,163,271 Swiss and Italian nationals 40+-year old were included. Multivariate age-standardized prostate cancer mortality rates and hazard ratios (HR) from Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were performed. Italianity was defined by an individual's nationality, place of birth and principal language, resulting in a score of 0-3 points.  Results:   Age-standardized prostate cancer mortality rates (per 100,000 person-years) were lowest in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland (66.7 vs. 87.3 in the German-speaking region). Both Italian nationality and/or place of birth were significantly associated with lower mortality. There was a graded inverse association between mortality rates and increasing Italianity score. Individuals with the highest level of Italianity had a HR of 0.67 (95 % CI 0.59-0.76) compared to those with an Italianity score of zero. Results were similar when looking at language regions separately.  Conclusions:   The strong and consistent association between Italianity and prostate cancer mortality suggests protective properties of an Italian lifestyle.

We examined associations between overall and visceral obesity and aggressive prostate cancer risk. Moreover, given racial differences in adipose tissue distribution, we examined whether race modified these associations.  Methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 308 radiotherapy-treated patients with prostate cancer within the Durham VA from 2005 to 2011. Multivariable logistic regression examined the association between BMI categories and tertiles of waist circumference (WC), visceral fat area (VFA), and periprostatic adipose tissue area (PPAT) with high-grade prostate cancer risk (Gleason score ≥7 vs. ≤6). Models stratified by race examined whether these associations differed between black and nonblack men.  Results:   Both elevated BMI (Ptrend = 0.054) and WC (Ptrend = 0.040) were associated with increased high-grade prostate cancer risk, with similar results between races, although the association with BMI was not statistically significant. In contrast, elevated VFA was associated with increased aggressive prostate cancer risk in black men (Ptrend = 0.002) but not nonblack men (Ptrend = 0.831), with a significant interaction between race and VFA (Pinteraction = 0.035). Though similar patterns were observed for PPAT, none was statistically significant.  Conclusions:   Among men undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer, visceral obesity is associated with increased aggressive prostate cancer risk, particularly among black men. If confirmed in future studies, these results suggest that adipose tissue distribution differences may contribute to prostate cancer racial disparity.  Impact:   These findings highlight the need to elucidate mechanisms contributing to racial differences in the association between visceral obesity and aggressive prostate cancer.""","""['Emma H Allott', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Hai-Jun Song', 'Katharine N Sourbeer', 'Bridget F Koontz', 'Joseph K Salama', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Abdominal and pelvic adipose tissue distribution and risk of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.', 'Prognostic impact of abdominal adiposity, waist circumference and body mass index in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy.', 'Obesity, body composition, and prostate cancer.', 'Visceral adiposity and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer: weighing the evidence.', 'MRI-Derived Apparent Diffusion Coefficient of Peri-Prostatic Adipose Tissue Is a Potential Determinant of Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness in Preoperative Setting: A Preliminary Report.', 'MRI-measured adipose features as predictive factors for detection of prostate cancer in males undergoing systematic prostate biopsy: a retrospective study based on a Chinese population.', 'Obesity-Related Cross-Talk between Prostate Cancer and Peripheral Fat: Potential Role of Exosomes.', 'Assessment of causal effects of visceral adipose tissue on risk of cancers: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Body Composition and Prostate Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review of Observational Studies.']"""

In this study, we report a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction, SAR405838 (MI-77301), that has been advanced into phase I clinical trials. SAR405838 binds to MDM2 with K(i) = 0.88 nmol/L and has high specificity over other proteins. A cocrystal structure of the SAR405838:MDM2 complex shows that, in addition to mimicking three key p53 amino acid residues, the inhibitor captures additional interactions not observed in the p53-MDM2 complex and induces refolding of the short, unstructured MDM2 N-terminal region to achieve its high affinity. SAR405838 effectively activates wild-type p53 in vitro and in xenograft tumor tissue of leukemia and solid tumors, leading to p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. At well-tolerated dose schedules, SAR405838 achieves either durable tumor regression or complete tumor growth inhibition in mouse xenograft models of SJSA-1 osteosarcoma, RS4;11 acute leukemia, LNCaP prostate cancer, and HCT-116 colon cancer. Remarkably, a single oral dose of SAR405838 is sufficient to achieve complete tumor regression in the SJSA-1 model. Mechanistically, robust transcriptional upregulation of PUMA induced by SAR405838 results in strong apoptosis in tumor tissue, leading to complete tumor regression.

Methods:   For the years 1996-1997 and 2006-2007, the incidence and mortality of cancer in New Zealand and Australia was compared to determine if differences between the two countries had changed over the decade under study. Summarised cancer data from New Zealand and Australia, age standardised to the 2002 World Health Organisation's standard population, were used to make the comparisons.  Results:   For the 11 year timeframe of this study, total rates of cancer incidence reduced in New Zealand and increased in Australia. The incidence of cancer in New Zealand, relative to Australia, changed from an excess of +10.3 to a deficit of -27.5 per 100,000 people. When considering the excess in terms of gender, the annual excess of cancer registrations for New Zealand females fell from +19.9 to +0.9 per 100,000, and male cancer registration fell from an excess of +3.7 to a deficit of -58.0 per 100,000, due almost entirely to a surge in prostate cancer registration in Australia. Over the same 11-year timeframe, cancer-specific mortality rates decreased in both countries, but there was no change in the difference between New Zealand and Australian rates, which remained 10% higher in New Zealand. Similar to findings on 1996/7 data, the main cancer sites responsible for the overall excess mortality in 2006/7 were colorectal cancer in both sexes, and lung and breast cancer in females.  Conclusion:   The persisting different cancer mortality rates between the two countries is likely to have been partly due to lifestyle and ethnic differences in the populations, and partly due to New Zealanders presenting with more advanced cancers and having less easy access to some treatments. Until we know the relative contributions of these factors, it will be difficult for New Zealand to plan interventions in the future which have a good chance of lifting our cancer survival rates to those of our closest neighbour. The collection of clinical stage on all new cancer registrations would provide the base information required.""","""['John Waldon', 'David S Lamb', 'Brett Delahunt', 'John N Nacey', 'Peter J Dady', 'Carol A Johnson', 'Alan G Hall', 'Peter B Bethwaite', 'Philip Weinstein']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""N Z Med J""","""['Cancer mortality and incidence trends comparing New Zealand and Australia for the period 2000-2007.', 'Comparison of cancer mortality and incidence in New Zealand and Australia.', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome in New Zealand and Australia.', 'Cancer in Australia: Actual incidence data from 1982 to 2013 and mortality data from 1982 to 2014 with projections to 2017.', 'Mind the gap: An analysis of foregone health gains from unfunded cancer medicines in New Zealand.', 'Sexual dimorphism in the incidence of human cancers.', 'Increasing Disadvantages in Cancer Survival in New Zealand Compared to Australia, between 2000-05 and 2006-10.', 'A serum-circulating long noncoding RNA signature can discriminate between patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and healthy controls.', 'Improving prediction of prostate cancer recurrence using chemical imaging.']"""

Here, we have demonstrated simultaneous detection of exogenous miR-21 and miR-141 from human body fluids including blood, urine and saliva using nanographene oxide. Our system enables us to specifically and reliably detect each oncomiR at different fluorescence emission channels from a large population of RNAs extracted from body fluids. We were also able to determine the content and the ratio of the miR-21 and miR-141 in 10 different miRNA cocktails composed of various, but unknown, concentrations of both oncomiRs. A strong agreement (around 90%) between the experimental results and the actual miRNA compositions was observed.

An association of lymph node dissection with thromboembolic events was suggested. We compared the incidence and investigated predictors of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism among other complications in patients who did or did not undergo lymph node dissection during open and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Included in study were 3,544 patients between 2008 and 2011. The cohort was derived from LAPPRO, a multicenter, prospective, controlled trial. Data on adverse events were extracted from patient completed questionnaires. Our primary study outcome was the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Secondary outcomes were other types of 90-day adverse events and causes of hospital readmission.  Results:   Lymph node dissection was performed in 547 patients (15.4%). It was associated with eightfold and sixfold greater risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism events compared to that in patients without lymph node dissection (RR 7.80, 95% CI 3.51-17.32 and 6.29, 95% CI 2.11-18.73, respectively). Factors predictive of thromboembolic events included a history of thrombosis, pT4 stage and Gleason score 8 or greater. Open radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection carried a higher risk of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism than robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RR 12.67, 95% CI 5.05-31.77 vs 7.52, 95% CI 2.84-19.88). In patients without lymph node dissection open radical prostatectomy increased the thromboembolic risk 3.8-fold (95% CI 1.42-9.99) compared to robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Lymph node dissection induced more wound, respiratory, cardiovascular and neuromusculoskeletal events. It also caused more readmissions than no lymph node dissection (14.6% vs 6.3%).  Conclusions:   Among other adverse events we found that lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy increased the incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Open surgery increased the risks more than robot-assisted surgery.

Conversion of big ET1 to mature ET1, catalyzed primarily by endothelin converting enzyme 1 (ECE1), is necessary for ET1's biological activity. We previously identified the Ece1, locus as a positional candidate gene for a pleiotropic quantitative trait locus affecting femoral size, shape, mineralization, and biomechanical performance.  Methods:   We exposed TMOb osteoblasts continuously to 25 ng/ml big ET1. Cells were grown for 6 days in growth medium and then switched to mineralization medium for an additional 15 days with or without big ET1, by which time the TMOb cells form mineralized nodules. We quantified mineralization by alizarin red staining and analyzed levels of miRNAs known to affect osteogenesis. Micro RNA 126-3p was identified by search as a potential regulator of sclerostin (SOST) translation.  Results:   TMOb cells exposed to big ET1 showed greater mineralization than control cells. Big ET1 repressed miRNAs targeting transcripts of osteogenic proteins. Big ET1 increased expression of miRNAs that target transcripts of proteins that inhibit osteogenesis. Big ET1 increased expression of 126-3p 121-fold versus control. To begin to assess the effect of big ET1 on SOST production we analyzed both SOST transcription and protein production with and without the presence of big ET1 demonstrating that transcription and translation were uncoupled.  Conclusion:   Our data show that big ET1 signaling promotes mineralization. Moreover, the results suggest that big ET1's osteogenic effects are potentially mediated through changes in miRNA expression, a previously unrecognized big ET1 osteogenic mechanism.""","""['Michael G Johnson', 'Jasmin Kristianto', 'Baozhi Yuan', 'Kathryn Konicke', 'Robert Blank']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Connect Tissue Res""","""['Endothelin signaling regulates mineralization and posttranscriptionally regulates SOST in TMOb cells via miR 126-3p.', 'Glucocorticoids regulate the expression of the human osteoblastic endothelin A receptor gene.', 'Low sirtuin 1 levels in human osteoarthritis subchondral osteoblasts lead to abnormal sclerostin expression which decreases Wnt/β-catenin activity.', 'Endothelin-1 reduces catabolic activity of human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells during chondro- and osteo-lineage differentiation.', 'Microscopic aspects on biomineralization in bone.', 'miRNAs Related to Different Processes of Fracture Healing: An Integrative Overview.', 'The -839(A/C) Polymorphism in the ECE1 Isoform b Promoter Associates With Osteoporosis and Fractures.', 'Diffuse osteosclerosis as a presentation of recurrent breast cancer: role of endothelin 1.', 'Zebrafish otolith biomineralization requires polyketide synthase.', 'Cross-talk of MicroRNA and hydrogen sulfide: A novel therapeutic approach for bone diseases.']"""

Limited data are available to estimate ovarian cancer risk associated with levels of circulating inflammatory markers.  Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression and adjusted for identified covariates.  Results:   Increased ovarian cancer risk was associated with elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) [tertile (T)3 vs. T1: OR (95% CI) 2.04 (1.06-3.93), p-trend=0.03], interleukin (IL)-1α [detectable vs. undetectable: 2.23 (1.14-4.34)] and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) [T3 vs. T1: 2.21 (1.06-4.63), p-trend=0.04]. Elevated IL-8 was non-significantly associated with risk [T3 vs. T1: 1.86 (0.96-3.61), p-trend=0.05].

Methods:   49 prostate cancer patients (64 ± 6 years) who underwent 3 T phased-array coil MRI before prostatectomy were included. T2WI was acquired using standard rectilinear and BLADE techniques. Two readers (R1, R2) independently localized the dominant lesion using T2WI alone and using multi-parametric imaging; recorded presence of extraprostatic extension (EPE) in each lobe; and scored lesion conspicuity and absence of motion artifact (1-5 scale; 5 = highest quality). A third reader, unblinded to pathology, placed ROIs to record tumor-to-peripheral-zone contrast. Standard and BLADE T2WI were compared using paired Wilcoxon tests.  Results:   BLADE showed a trend toward improved motion artifact for R1 (3.4 ± 1.3 vs. 2.9 ± 1.5; p = 0.054) but not R2 (4.0 ± 1.0 vs. 3.9 ± 1.1; p = 0.880). Dominant lesions showed significantly lower conspicuity using BLADE for R1 (2.8 ± 2.0 vs. 3.2 ± 2.0; p = 0.011) but not R2 (2.3 ± 1.6 vs. 2.4 ± 1.7; p = 0.353), and significantly lower tumor-to-peripheral-zone contrast using BLADE (0.35 ± 0.13 vs. 0.42 ± 0.15; p ≤ 0.001). R1 and R2 correctly localized four and three fewer dominant tumors, respectively, using BLADE than standard T2WI, although both correctly localized a similar fraction of dominant tumors using multi-parametric sequences. While R1 detected EPE in 10 of 11 patients using both sequences, R2 detected EPE in 3 more patients using BLADE.  Conclusion:   BLADE may help reduce motion artifact of prostate T2WI and assist EPE detection, although at expense of reduced image contrast. In practice, BLADE may be useful in patients in whom initial T2WI is degraded by motion.""","""['Andrew B Rosenkrantz', 'Genevieve L Bennett', 'Ankur Doshi', 'Fang-Ming Deng', 'James S Babb', 'Samir S Taneja']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Abdom Imaging""","""['Evaluation of the most optimal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging sequence for determining pathological length of capsular contact.', 'Usefulness of the application of the BLADE technique to reduce motion artifacts on navigation-triggered prospective acquisition correction (PACE) T2-weighted MRI (T2WI) of the liver.', 'Prostate cancer: Comparison of 3D T2-weighted with conventional 2D T2-weighted imaging for image quality and tumor detection.', 'Peripheral zone prostate cancer localization by multiparametric magnetic resonance at 3 T: unbiased cancer identification by matching to histopathology.', 'BLADE Sequences in Transverse T2-weighted MR Imaging of the Cervical Spine.

This process is finely tuned by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms that regulate the entry of tumour cells to senescence. Whether tumour-infiltrating immune cells can oppose senescence is unknown. Here we show that at the onset of senescence, PTEN null prostate tumours in mice are massively infiltrated by a population of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) myeloid cells that protect a fraction of proliferating tumour cells from senescence, thus sustaining tumour growth. Mechanistically, we found that Gr-1(+) cells antagonize senescence in a paracrine manner by interfering with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype of the tumour through the secretion of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). Strikingly, Pten-loss-induced cellular senescence was enhanced in vivo when Il1ra knockout myeloid cells were adoptively transferred to PTEN null mice. Therapeutically, docetaxel-induced senescence and efficacy were higher in PTEN null tumours when the percentage of tumour-infiltrating CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) myeloid cells was reduced using an antagonist of CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2). Taken together, our findings identify a novel non-cell-autonomous network, established by innate immunity, that controls senescence evasion and chemoresistance.

Prospective studies of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, suggest an inverse association with colorectal cancer risk, but with some inconsistencies. Furthermore, the direct or indirect impact of the key transport protein, vitamin D binding protein (DBP), has not been examined. We conducted a prospective study of serum 25(OH)D and DBP concentrations and colorectal cancer risk in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, based on 476 colorectal cancer cases and 476 controls, matched on age, sex, race and date of serum collection. All subjects underwent sigmoidoscopic screening at baseline and once during follow-up. Conditional logistic regression estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Circulating 25(OH)D was inversely associated with colorectal cancer (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.94 for highest versus lowest quintile, p trend 0.01). Adjusting for recognized colorectal cancer risk factors and accounting for seasonal vitamin D variation did not alter the findings. Neither circulating DBP nor the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio, a proxy for free circulating 25(OH)D, was associated with risk (OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.54-1.26, and OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.52-1.21, respectively), and DBP did not modify the 25(OH)D association.

The self-regulatory executive function (S-REF) model suggests that metacognitions and attentional bias to cancer-related words may explain high FCR. Thus, this study aimed to explore relationships between FCR, metacognitions and attentional bias in a mixed group of cancer survivors.  Method:   Sixty-three early-stage breast or prostate cancer survivors, diagnosed within 6 months to 5 years prior to participation and who had completed all hospital-based treatment with no evidence of cancer recurrence were recruited through two metropolitan oncology clinics. Participants completed a questionnaire battery and the dot-probe task.  Results:   Survivors with clinical FCR had significantly greater positive beliefs about worry (10.1 vs 7.4, p = 0.002) and beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry (12.0 vs 7.7, p = 0.000) than those with non-clinical FCR, whereas the total metacognition score significantly predicted FCR in multiple regression analysis (β = 0.371, p = 0.001). No significant differences were detected between participants scoring above and below clinical FCR levels in attention bias indices.  Conclusions:   This study found partial support for the S-REF model of FCR, with metacognitions but not attentional bias found to be related to FCR.

However, with continuing expansion of novel therapeutics, it is important to understand whether the Gleason system can be effectively utilized in this setting. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of the Gleason grading system to predict systemic progression among prostatectomy specimens treated with neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT).  Methods:   This was a single-institution retrospective analysis from 1987 to 2009 of 13,427 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) without NHT and 1148 patients with NHT. NHT consisted of leuprolide alone (n = 415), antiandrogen therapy alone (n = 400) and combined treatment (n = 333). Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated 15-year systemic progression-free survival among NHT and non-NHT patients. Cox proportional hazard regression models estimated risk of systemic progression following RP according to NHT use and nonuse.  Results:   Median duration of NHT was 3 months (interquartile range (IQR) 2-4) whereas median follow-up after RP was 8.3 years (IQR 5-10.8). NHT patients were more likely to be D'Amico high risk, have locally advanced pathologic T stage (≥ pT3), pathologic Gleason scores (GS) of 8-10 and lymph node involvement (P<0.0001 for all). NHT use was associated with lower rates of positive surgical margins, more downgrading to pT0 and less GS upgrading from biopsy (P ≤ 0.001 for all). GS could not be assigned to only 3% of NHT patients. On multivariate analysis, pathologic GS remained a predictor of systemic progression (SP) following NHT (hazard ratio (HR) 1.6, P = 0.005), but the association was less strong compared with non-NHT patients (HR 2.9, P < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Utilization of the Gleason system appears feasible among hormonally pretreated prostatectomy specimens and shows continued prognostication for systemic progression.

The overall IR of cancer in the United States is declining. Although central nervous system tumors (CNST) are rare, they contribute disproportionately to mortality and morbidity. In this analysis, the authors examined trends in the incidence of the most common cancers and CNST between 2000 and 2010.  Methods:   The current analysis used data from the United States Cancer Statistics publication and the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States. Age-adjusted IR per 100,000 population with 95% confidence intervals and the annual percent change (APC) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for selected common cancers and CNST overall and by age, sex, race/ethnicity, selected histologies, and malignancy status.

A hypothesis is presented wherein circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), an endocrine member of the fibroblast growth factor family with phosphaturic properties, are proposed as a prognostic and predictive marker to identify CRPC patients with poor prognosis that are amenable to FGF23 antibody therapy (FGF23i) or treatment with fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors (FGFRi). With respect to the latter, FGF23 may also serve as a pharmacodynamic marker enabling individualized FGFRi dosing. We recently discovered that the development of severe and sustained hypophosphatemia in CRPC patients undergoing zoledronic acid therapy for bone metastases was associated with markedly worse prognosis compared to patients without or with only mild and transient hypophosphatemia. Severe hypophosphatemia is a typical manifestation of tumor-induced hypophosphatemic osteomalacia (TIO), a paraneoplastic condition mediated by FGF23 overexpression in most instances. While the postulated tumor-promoting role of FGF23 in CRPC or other malignancies has not yet been studied, several lines of evidence suggest that FGF23 may mediate both severe hypophosphatemia (via its endocrine properties) and aggressive CRPC behavior (via autocrine and paracrine activities): (i) FGF23 and the necessary signalling machinery (i.e. members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor [FGFR] family and the essential co-receptor α-KLOTHO [KL]) are highly expressed in a sizeable subgroup of CRPC patients; (ii) FGF/FGFR signalling plays important roles in prostate cancer; (iii) FGF23 can induce its own expression via a positive autocrine feedback loop involving FGFR1; and (iv) this positive feedback loop may be triggered by bone-targeted therapies frequently used for the treatment of CRPC-associated bone metastases. While there is a lack of personalized treatment strategies in the management of CRPC to date, FGF23 targeted therapy has the potential to fill this unmet clinical need in the not-so-distant future. In fact, FGFRi are currently in advanced clinical testing for a number of malignancies such as kidney and lung cancer, but there is a lack of conclusive data on FGFRi therapy in patients selected for FGF/FGFR pathway activation.""","""['Esther K Lee', 'Maria Carmen Riesco Martinez', 'Kim Blakely', 'Keemo Delos Santos', 'Van C Hoang', 'Annabelle Chow', 'Urban Emmenegger']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Hypotheses""","""['A Case of Prostate Cancer with Multiple Bone Metastasis with High FGF23 Value Indicated by Intractable Hypocalcemia and Hypophosphatemia.', 'Fibroblast growth factor 23 and its receptors.', 'FGF23 Neutralizing Antibody Ameliorates Hypophosphatemia and Impaired FGF Receptor Signaling in Kidneys of HMWFGF2 Transgenic Mice.', 'Hypophosphatemia related to paraneoplastic Cushing syndrome in prostate cancer: cure after bilateral adrenalectomy.', 'FGF23-FGF Receptor/Klotho Pathway as a New Drug Target for Disorders of Bone and Mineral Metabolism.', 'The link between bone-derived factors osteocalcin, fibroblast growth factor 23, sclerostin, lipocalin 2 and tumor bone metastasis.', 'Chronic Kidney Disease and Cancer: Inter-Relationships and Mechanisms.', 'Diagnosis and Management of Denosumab-Induced Hypocalcemia and Hypophosphatemia in the Setting of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Biological Significance and Targeting of the FGFR Axis in Cancer.', 'High Intakes of Bioavailable Phosphate May Promote Systemic Oxidative Stress and Vascular Calcification by Boosting Mitochondrial Membrane Potential-Is Good Magnesium Status an Antidote?']"""

Methods:   The MRI examinations of 35 patients were evaluated in this prospective study. PTX-EPI was performed with a TX-acceleration factor of 1.7 and a field of view (FOV) of 150 × 90 mm(2), whereas c-EPI used a full FOV of 380 × 297 mm(2). Two readers evaluated three different aspects of image quality on 5-point Likert scales. To quantify distortion artefacts, maximum diameters and prostate volume were determined for both techniques and compared to T2-weighted imaging.  Results:   The zoomed pTX-EPI was superior to c-EPI with respect to overall image quality (3.39 ± 0.62 vs 2.45 ± 0.67) and anatomic differentiability (3.29 ± 0.65 vs 2.41 ± 0.65), each with p < 0.0001. Artefacts were significantly less severe in pTX-EPI (0.93 ± 0.73 vs 1.49 ± 1.08), p < 0.001. The quantitative analysis yielded a higher agreement of pTX-EPI with T2-weighted imaging than c-EPI with respect to coronal (ICCs: 0.95 vs 0.93) and sagittal (0.86 vs 0.73) diameters as well as prostate volume (0.94 vs 0.92). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values did not differ significantly between the two techniques (p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   Zoomed pTX-EPI leads to substantial improvements in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate with respect to different aspects of image quality and severity of artefacts.  Key points:   Recent technical developments in MRI allow the use of accelerated, spatially-selective excitation (parallel-transmit, pTX). pTX can be used for zoomed echo-planar prostate imaging (pTX-EPI). pTX-EPI improves different aspects of image quality in prostate MRI.

Given that recommendations are based on low-level evidence, we hypothesized that there would be a wide variability in clinical practice patterns.  Design:   Members of all major endocrine and andrological societies were invited to participate in a Web-based survey of the diagnostic work-up and management of a hypothetical index case of a 61-year old overweight man presenting with symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency, without evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPT) axis disease.  Results:   Nine hundred and forty-three respondents (91·2% adult endocrinologists) from Northern America (63·7%), Europe (12·7%), Oceania (8·2%), Latin America and Caribbean (7·6%), and the Middle East, Asia, or Africa (7·8%) completed the survey. Response rates among participating societies ranged from 4·1-20·0%. There was a wide variability in clinical practice patterns, especially regarding biochemical diagnosis of androgen deficiency, exclusion of HPT axis pathology, and monitoring for prostate cancer. In a man with suggestive symptoms, 42·4% of participants would offer testosterone treatment below a serum total testosterone of 10·4 nmol/l (300 ng/dl). A total of 46·0% of participants were, over the last five years, 'less inclined' to prescribe testosterone to men with nonspecific symptoms and borderline testosterone levels, compared to 'no change' (29·3%) or 'more inclined' (24·7%), P < 0·001.  Conclusions:   This large-scale international survey shows a wide variability in the management of lowered testosterone in older men, with deviations from current clinical practice guidelines, and a temporal trend towards increasing reluctance to prescribe testosterone to men without classical hypogonadism. These findings highlight the need for better evidence to guide clinicians regarding testosterone therapy.""","""['Mathis Grossmann', 'Bradley D Anawalt', 'Frederick C W Wu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)""","""['Re: Clinical practice patterns in the assessment and management of low testosterone in men: an international survey of endocrinologists.', 'A 2013 survey of clinical practice patterns in the management of primary hypothyroidism.', 'Testosterone Therapy in Men With Hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline.', 'Transversal European survey on testosterone deficiency diagnosis.', 'Considerations for the diagnosis and treatment of testosterone deficiency in elderly men.', 'Functional testosterone: biochemical assessment of hypogonadism in men--report from a multidisciplinary workshop hosted by the Ontario Society of Clinical Chemists.', 'Biochemical predictors of structural hypothalamus-pituitary abnormalities detected by magnetic resonance imaging in men with secondary hypogonadism.', 'Understanding the Context of High- and Low-Testosterone Prescribing Facilities in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA): a Qualitative Study.', 'Testosterone Management in Aging Males: Surveying Clinical Practices of Urologists and Endocrinologists in Israel.', 'A Content Analysis of Testosterone Websites: Sex, Muscle, and Male Age-Related Thematic Differences.', 'Reproductive endocrinology: Are intramuscular testosterone injections harmful?']"""

The objective of this study was to examine patterns of screening for prostate cancer in primary care and follow-up investigations after an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) result in Māori and non-Māori men in order to help explain the observed differences in incidence and mortality.  Methods:   Men aged 40+ years were identified from 31 general practices across the Midland Cancer Network region. Computerised practice records were cross-referenced with laboratory data to determine the number and value of PSA tests undertaken between January 2007 and December 2010. Screening rates were calculated for the year 2010 by age, ethnicity, and practice. For men with an elevated PSA result information on specialist referrals and biopsy was extracted from practice records. Practice characteristics were assessed with respect to screening rates for Māori and non-Māori men.  Results:   The final study population included 34,960 men aged 40+ years; 14% were Māori. Māori men were less likely to be screened in 2010 compared with non-Māori men (Mantel Haenszel (M-H) age-adjusted risk ratio (RR), 0.52 [95% CI, 0.48, 0.56]). When screened, Māori men were more than twice as likely to have an elevated PSA result compared with non-Māori men (M-H age-adjusted RR, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.42, 3.31]). There were no significant differences between Māori and non-Māori men in the rate of follow-up investigations and cancer detection. Māori provider practices showed equal screening rates for Māori and non-Māori men, but they were also the practices with the lowest overall screening rates.  Conclusions:   Māori men were half as likely to be screened compared to non-Māori men. This probably explains the lower reported incidence of prostate cancer for Māori men. Practice characteristics had a major influence on screening rates. Large variation in screening behaviour among practices and differences in follow-up investigations for men with an elevated PSA result seems to reflect the uncertainty among GPs regarding PSA screening and management.""","""['Zuzana Obertová', 'Nina Scott', 'Charis Brown', 'Fraser Hodgson', 'Alistair Stewart', 'Michael Holmes', 'Ross Lawrenson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Fam Pract""","""['Ethnic and socio-economic disparities in prostate cancer screening: lessons from New Zealand.', 'Do Maori and Pacific Islander men present with more advanced prostate cancer than European New Zealand men?

In Drosophila melanogaster, these signals are generated by a variety of seminal peptides, many produced by the accessory glands (AGs). One epithelial cell type in the adult male AGs, the secondary cell (SC), grows selectively in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. This signaling is involved in blocking the rapid remating of mated females, which contributes to the reproductive advantage of the first male to mate. In this paper, we show that SCs secrete exosomes, membrane-bound vesicles generated inside late endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs). After mating, exosomes fuse with sperm (as also seen in vitro for human prostate-derived exosomes and sperm) and interact with female reproductive tract epithelia. Exosome release was required to inhibit female remating behavior, suggesting that exosomes are downstream effectors of BMP signaling. Indeed, when BMP signaling was reduced in SCs, vesicles were still formed in MVBs but not secreted as exosomes. These results demonstrate a new function for the MVB-exosome pathway in the reproductive tract that appears to be conserved across evolution.""","""['Laura Corrigan', 'Siamak Redhai', 'Aaron Leiblich', 'Shih-Jung Fan', 'Sumeth M W Perera', 'Rachel Patel', 'Carina Gandy', 'S Mark Wainwright', 'John F Morris', 'Freddie Hamdy', 'Deborah C I Goberdhan', 'Clive Wilson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Cell Biol""","""['CD63 Regulates Epstein-Barr Virus LMP1 Exosomal Packaging, Enhancement of Vesicle Production, and Noncanonical NF-κB Signaling.', 'The Drosophila Accessory Gland as a Model for Prostate Cancer and Other Pathologies.', 'BMP signaling inhibition in Drosophila secondary cells remodels the seminal proteome and self and rival ejaculate functions.', 'PIKfyve inhibition increases exosome release and induces secretory autophagy.', 'Current knowledge on exosome biogenesis and release.', 'Transcriptional programs are activated and microRNAs are repressed within minutes after mating in the Drosophila melanogaster female reproductive tract.', 'Rbf/E2F1 control growth and endoreplication via steroid-independent Ecdysone Receptor signalling in Drosophila prostate-like secondary cells.', 'A phosphate-sensing organelle regulates phosphate and tissue homeostasis.', 'Accessory ESCRT-III proteins are conserved and selective regulators of Rab11a-exosome formation.', 'The role of Evi/Wntless in exporting Wnt proteins.']"""

PCa patients carrying a breast cancer 2, early onset (BRCA2) germline mutation exhibit highly aggressive tumours with poor prognosis.  Objective:   To investigate the presence and implications of IDC-P in men with a strong family history of PCa who either carry a BRCA2 pathogenic mutation or do not carry the mutation (BRCAX).  Design, setting, and participants:   Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were generated from three germline BRCA2 mutation carriers and one BRCAX patient. Specimens were examined for histologic evidence of IDC-P. Whole-genome copy number analysis (WG-CNA) was performed on IDC-P from a primary and a matched PDX specimen.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The incidence of IDC-P and association with overall survival for BRCA2 and BRCAX patients were determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results and limitations:   PDXs from BRCA2 tumours showed increased incidence of IDC-P compared with sporadic PCa (p=0.015). WG-CNA confirmed that the genetic profile of IDC-P from a matched (primary and PDX) BRCA2 tumour was similar. The incidence of IDC-P was significantly increased in BRCA2 carriers (42%, n=33, p=0.004) but not in BRCAX patients (25.8%, n=62, p=0.102) when both groups were compared with sporadic cases (9%, n=32). BRCA2 carriers and BRCAX patients with IDC-P had significantly worse overall and PCa-specific survival compared with BRCA2 carriers and BRCAX patients without IDC-P (hazard ratio [HR]: 16.9, p=0.0064 and HR: 3.57, p=0.0086, respectively).  Conclusions:   PDXs revealed IDC-P in patients with germline BRCA2 mutations or BRCAX classification, identifying aggressive tumours with poor survival even when the stage and grade of cancer at diagnosis were similar. Further studies of the prognostic significance of IDC-P in sporadic PCa are warranted.

A special disease is usually caused by the alteration of a series of functional related metabolites having a global influence on the metabolic network. Moreover, the metabolites in the same metabolic pathway are often associated with the same or similar disease. Based on these functional relationships between metabolites in the context of metabolic pathways, we here presented a pathway-based random walk method called PROFANCY for prioritization of candidate disease metabolites. Our strategy not only takes advantage of the global functional relationships between metabolites but also sufficiently exploits the functionally modular nature of metabolic networks. Our approach proved successful in prioritizing known metabolites for 71 diseases with an AUC value of 0.895. We also assessed the performance of PROFANCY on 16 disease classes and found that 4 classes achieved an AUC value over 0.95. To investigate the robustness of the PROFANCY, we repeated all the analyses in two metabolic networks and obtained similar results. Then we applied our approach to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and found that a top ranked candidate was potentially related to AD but had not been reported previously. Furthermore, our method was applicable to prioritize the metabolites from metabolomic profiles of prostate cancer. The PROFANCY could identify prostate cancer related-metabolites that are supported by literatures but not considered to be significantly differential by traditional differential analysis.

In silico specificity analysis was performed for the identification of miRNAs able to regulate KLK2 and KLK4 expression.

Thereafter, RNA was polyadenylated and reverse transcribed to cDNA, which was used for qPCR analysis. miR-378 was predicted to target both KLK2 and KLK4 and downregulated levels detected in PCa patients (p=0.050). The reduction of miR-378 was correlated with higher Gleason score (p=0.018), larger diameter tumors (p=0.034), and elevated serum PSA (p=0.006).

They are differentially expressed in prostate cancer. Kallikreins are genes that encode serine proteases and are dysregulated in cancer. We elucidated a miRNA-kallikrein network that can be involved in prostate cancer progression. Target prediction identified 23 miRNAs that are dysregulated between high and low risk biochemical failure and are predicted to target five kallikreins linked to prostate cancer; KLK2, KLK3, KLK4, KLK14 and KLK15. We also identified 14 miRNAs that are differentially expressed between Gleason grades and are predicted to target these kallikreins. This demonstrates that kallikreins are downstream effectors through which miRNAs influence tumor progression. We show, through in-silico and experimental analysis, that miR-378/422a and its gene targets PIK3CG, GRB2, AKT3, KLK4 and KLK14 form an integrated circuit in prostate cancer. Our analysis shows that a minisatellite sequence in the kallikrein locus consists of a number of microsatellite repeats that represent predicted miRNA response elements. A number of kallikrein and non-kallikrein prostate cancer-related genes share these microsatellite repeats. We validated some of these interactions in prostate cancer cell lines.

Here we show that TRPV6 mediates calcium entry, which is highly increased in PCa due to the remodeling mechanism involving the translocation of the TRPV6 channel to the plasma membrane via the Orai1/TRPC1-mediated Ca(2+)/Annexin I/S100A11 pathway, partially contributing to SOCE. The TRPV6 calcium channel is expressed de novo by the PCa cell to increase its survival by enhancing proliferation and conferring apoptosis resistance. Xenografts in nude mice and bone metastasis models confirmed the remarkable aggressiveness of TRPV6-overexpressing tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of these demonstrated the increased expression of clinical markers such as Ki-67, prostate specific antigen, synaptophysin, CD31, and CD56, which are strongly associated with a poor prognosis.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is commonly used as a marker of PCa disease burden, and the relationship of baseline PSA level to consequent treatment effect is of clinical interest.  Objective:   Exploratory analysis to evaluate any differences in patient characteristics and efficacy outcomes by baseline PSA level in the AFFIRM trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   Post hoc subanalysis of all randomised patients (n=1199) from the AFFIRM trial.  Intervention:   Participants were randomly assigned in a two-to-one ratio to receive oral enzalutamide 160 mg/d or placebo.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The major clinical efficacy end points were overall survival (OS), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and time to PSA progression (TTPP) versus placebo; baseline characteristics, treatment duration, and subsequent antineoplastic therapy were compared by baseline PSA quartile.  Results and limitations:   Baseline PSA quartiles corresponded to the following PSA groups: <40 ng/ml (n=299), 40 to <111 ng/ml (n=300), 111 to <406 ng/ml (n=300), and ≥406 ng/ml (n=300). Enzalutamide consistently improved OS, rPFS, and TTPP compared with placebo across all subgroups, regardless of baseline PSA level. Hazard ratios for improvements in OS were 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.85), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.47-1.02), 0.73 (95% CI, 0.53-1.01), and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.39-0.73) for PSA groups 1-4, respectively. The post hoc design of this analysis was not statistically powered to assess the relationship between baseline PSA and clinical efficacy outcomes.

Accordingly, recent data suggests AdVance to yield success rates of 62%-77% through 3 year follow up.1,2 Although experience to date is favorable, many questions exist. Foremost, the ideal technique for intraoperative placement and tensioning remains a topic of discussion. The exact mechanism by which sling placement restores continence is unknown, but is hypothesized to comprise an elevation of the bulbar urethra both ventrally and cranially. This ""repositioning"" may then lead to improved urethral coaptation. Concurrently, urodynamic investigation suggests that sling action does not involve an obstructive effect.3 Despite these findings, other investigation highlights the questions that remain regarding sling mechanism of action and the role that urethral compression may place in continence restoration. Accordingly, study of postoperative MRI findings suggests that urethral bulb indentation may be associated with postoperative continence.4 Further, acute urinary retention (AUR) is frequently observed following sling placement, seen in 12%-21% of cases.2,5 Although it is hypothesized that the high rate of AUR may relate to a detrusor muscle deconditioned during prolonged periods of low outlet resistance, a role of urethral compression cannot be excluded. The authors seek to investigate the hypothesis that postoperative AUR may actually be associated with improved continence outcomes. The authors identify continence rates of 100% and 26% in comparison of patients experiencing postoperative AUR versus patients undergoing successful void trial, respectively.6 While this finding is of value, several issues are important to mention. Foremost, additional research is needed to confirm the primary study finding given that prior multivariate analysis has demonstrated that AUR presence/absence was not an independent risk factor for sling failure.7 Second, given some data suggesting that sling success rates deteriorate over time, longitudinal long term investigation is important to determine whether postoperative AUR may be a predictor for durable success rates.8 Finally, assessment of urgency outcomes following male sling placement is important. De novo irritative symptoms and voiding dysfunction following midurethral sling placement in women are a significant concern. Such adverse effects are thought to arise due to an obstructive or irritative effect of the sling. Although the mechanism of action of the AdVance sling is likely different, data regarding urgency outcomes is nonetheless important. This is especially true of patients experiencing AUR postoperatively, even if transient. Despite the many questions that remain, the primary study finding of improved outcomes in patients experiencing AUR is important. Anecdotally, I have observed this tendency in my own practice and believe this to be an observation warranting investigation.""","""['David E Rapp']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Prognostic value of postoperative urinary retention after male sling insertion.', 'Prognostic value of postoperative urinary retention after male sling insertion.', 'Functional follow-up after Advance® and Advance XP® male sling surgery: assessment of predictive factors.', 'Urinary retention after AdVance™ Sling: A multi-institutional retrospective study.', 'The artificial urinary sphincter and male sling for postprostatectomy incontinence: Which patient should get which procedure?', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'AdVance male sling.']"""

For the purpose of intra- and inter-institutional homogenization of treatment plan quality, we present an algorithm that learns the organs-at-risk (OARs) sparing patterns from a database of high quality plans. Thereafter, the algorithm predicts the dose that similar organs will receive in future radiotherapy plans prior to treatment planning on the basis of the anatomies of the organs. The predicted dose provides the basis for the individualized specification of planning objectives, and for the objective assessment of the quality of radiotherapy plans.  Materials and method:   One hundred and twenty eight (128) Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) plans were selected from a database of prostate cancer plans. The plans were divided into two groups, namely a training set that is made up of 95 plans and a validation set that consists of 33 plans. A multivariate analysis technique was used to determine the relationships between the positions of voxels and their dose. This information was used to predict the likely sparing of the OARs of the plans of the validation set. The predicted doses were visually and quantitatively compared to the reference data using dose volume histograms, the 3D dose distribution, and a novel evaluation metric that is based on the dose different test.  Results:   A voxel of the bladder on the average receives a higher dose than a voxel of the rectum in optimized radiotherapy plans for the treatment of prostate cancer in our institution if both voxels are at the same distance to the PTV. Based on our evaluation metric, the predicted and reference dose to the bladder agree to within 5% of the prescribed dose to the PTV in 18 out of 33 cases, while the predicted and reference doses to the rectum agree to within 5% in 28 out of the 33 plans of the validation set.  Conclusion:   We have described a method to predict the likely dose that OARs will receive before treatment planning. This prospective knowledge could be used to implement a global quality assurance system for personalized radiation therapy treatment planning.""","""['Obioma Nwankwo', 'Dwi Seno K Sihono', 'Frank Schneider', 'Frederik Wenz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Knowledge-based radiation therapy (KBRT) treatment planning versus planning by experts: validation of a KBRT algorithm for prostate cancer treatment planning.', 'A knowledge-based approach to improving and homogenizing intensity modulated radiation therapy planning quality among treatment centers: an example application to prostate cancer planning.', 'Quantitative analysis of the factors which affect the interpatient organ-at-risk dose sparing variation in IMRT plans.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'What is plan quality in radiotherapy?

ERG is expressed in over half of all prostate cancers (CaP) as a result of specific gene fusions involving ERG and the androgen regulated TMPRSS2 promoter. ERG MAb 9FY has been extensively used in the evaluations of CaP. Increasing use of ERG MAb in CaP has prompted us to characterize the precise ERG epitope it binds to and to define the molecular basis of its specificity to ERG. The 9FY antibody binds to an epitope formed by amino acid residues 42-66 of the ERG protein. To determine the key residues involved in 9FY binding, experiments were carried out using a combination of approaches including overlapping peptides, alanine scanning mutagenesis, ELISA, and immunoblot assays. Analysis of both overlapping and variant peptides harboring truncations of amino acids revealed that a minimal epitope of eight residues (RVPQQDWL) is sufficient for binding to the 9FY antibody. In order to further identify key residues that mediate the binding of the antibody to ERG protein, a 14-residue peptide (P23) with optimal reactivity was subjected to alanine scanning mutagenesis. Alterations to residues QQDW were found to eliminate binding to the antibody, while residues (R50 and L57) were found to contribute to the binding of the antibody. Further experiments showed that peptide P23 competed effectively with ERG protein for binding 9FY. On the other hand, peptides with alanine substitutions for residues Q53 and W56 (P27 and P30, respectively) failed to interfere with binding. These data provide new information about a minimal epitope (RVPQQDWL) within amino acid residues 42-66 of the ERG protein that is recognized by MAb 9FY, which may aid in the diagnosis and also development of antibody based therapeutics against prostate and other cancers showing ERG overexpression.""","""['Anshu Rastogi', 'Shyh-Han Tan', 'Sreedatta Banerjee', 'Shashwat Sharad', 'Jacob Kagan', 'Sudhir Srivastava', 'David G McLeod', 'Shiv Srivastava', 'Alagarsamy Srinivasan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Monoclon Antib Immunodiagn Immunother""","""['Analytical platform evaluation for quantification of ERG in prostate cancer using protein and mRNA detection methods.', 'Increased association of the ERG oncoprotein expression in advanced stages of prostate cancer in Filipinos.', 'ERG oncoprotein expression in prostate cancer: clonal progression of ERG-positive tumor cells and potential for ERG-based stratification.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'ERG protein expression as a biomarker of prostate cancer.', 'Autoantibodies against oncogenic ERG protein in prostate cancer: potential use in diagnosis and prognosis in a panel with C-MYC, AMACR and HERV-K Gag.', ""Noninvasive Prenatal Diagnosis Significance of ERG Methylation as a Biomarker in Down's Syndrome."", 'Biomarkers of World Trade Center Particulate Matter Exposure: Physiology of Distal Airway and Blood Biomarkers that Predict FEV₁ Decline.', 'Analytical platform evaluation for quantification of ERG in prostate cancer using protein and mRNA detection methods.', 'Functional antagonism of TMPRSS2-ERG splice variants in prostate cancer.']"""

Recent studies have indicated that olr1 mRNA is over-expressed in stage III and IV of human prostatic adenocarcinomas. However, the function of LOX-1 in prostate cancer angiogenesis remains to be determined. Our aim was to analyze the contribution of oxLDL and LOX-1 to tumor angiogenesis using C4-2 prostate cancer cells. We analyzed the expression of pro-angiogenic molecules and angiogenesis on prostate cancer tumor xenografts, using prostate cancer cell models with overexpression or knockdown of LOX-1 receptor. Our results demonstrate that the activation of LOX-1 using oxLDL increases cell proliferation, and the expression of the pro-angiogenic molecules VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner. Noticeably, these effects were prevented in the C4-2 prostate cancer model when LOX-1 expression was knocked down. The angiogenic effect of LOX-1 activated with oxLDL was further demonstrated using the aortic ring assay and the xenograft model of tumor growth on chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos.

The vast majority of pancreatic cancer (PaCa) patients already have metastatic complications at the time of diagnosis, and the death rate of this lethal type of cancer has increased over the past decades. Thus, efforts at identifying novel molecularly targeted therapies are priorities. Recent studies have suggested that serotonin (5-HT) contributes to the tumor growth in a variety of cancers including prostate, colon, bladder and liver cancer. However, there is lack of evidence about the impact of 5-HT receptors on promoting pancreatic cancer. Having considered the role of 5-HT-1 receptors, especially 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D subtypes in different types of malignancies, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in PaCa growth and progression and analyze their potential as cytotoxic targets. We found that knockdown of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors expression, using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), induced significant inhibition of proliferation and clonogenicity of PaCa cells. Also, it significantly suppressed PaCa cells invasion and reduced the activity of uPAR/MMP-2 signaling and Integrin/Src/Fak-mediated signaling, as integral tumor cell pathways associated with invasion, migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Moreover, targeting 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors down-regulates zinc finger ZEB1 and Snail proteins, the hallmarks transcription factors regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), concomitantly with up-regulating of claudin-1 and E-Cadherin. In conclusion, our data suggests that 5-HT1B- and 5-HT1D-mediated signaling play an important role in the regulation of the proliferative and invasive phenotype of PaCa. It also highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting of 5-HT1B/1D receptors in the treatment of PaCa, and opens a new avenue for biomarkers identification, and valuable new therapeutic targets for managing pancreatic cancer.""","""['Nilgun Gurbuz', 'Ahmed A Ashour', 'S Neslihan Alpay', 'Bulent Ozpolat']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Down-regulation of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors inhibits proliferation, clonogenicity and invasion of human pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Down-regulation of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors inhibits proliferation, clonogenicity and invasion of human pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Elongation factor-2 kinase regulates TG2/β1 integrin/Src/uPAR pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition mediating pancreatic cancer cells invasion.', 'Novel role for CRK adaptor proteins as essential components of SRC/FAK signaling for epithelial-mesenchymal transition and colorectal cancer aggressiveness.', 'Src-mediated regulation of E-cadherin and EMT in pancreatic cancer.', '5-HT receptors mediating external carotid vasoconstriction in vagosympathectomized dogs.', 'Claudin and pancreatic cancer.', 'Emerging Roles of the Nervous System in Gastrointestinal Cancer Development.', 'Shedding Light on the Role of Neurotransmitters in the Microenvironment of Pancreatic Cancer.', 'The Role of Serotonin in Breast Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Role of serotonin receptor signaling in cancer cells and anti-tumor immunity.']"""

Chronic inflammatory infiltrates (CII) type IV are the most common non-cancer diagnosis of the prostate after biopsy.  Objective:   To evaluate associations of both PV index (PVI), i.e. the ratio of transitional zone volume (TZV) to peripheral zone volume (PZV), and CII with PCA in patients undergoing biopsy.  Subjects and methods:   Between January 2007 and December 2008, 268 consecutive patients who underwent prostate biopsy were retrospectively evaluated. PV and TZV were measured by transrectal ultrasound. PZV was computed by subtracting the PV from the TZV. CII were evaluated according to standard criteria. Significant associations of PVI and the presence of CII (CII+) with PCA risk were assessed by statistical methods.  Results and limitations:   We evaluated 251 patients after excluding cases with painful rectal examinations, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >20 μg/ml and metastases. The PCA detection rate was 41.1%. PVI was a negative independent predictor of PCA. A PVI ≤1.0 was directly [odds ratio (OR) = 2.36] associated with PCA, which was detected more frequently in patients with a PVI ≤1.0 (29.1%) than in those with a PVI >1.0 (11.9%). CII+ was inversely (OR = 0.57) and independently associated with PCA, which was detected less frequently in cases with CII (9.9%) than in those without CII (21.1%). Potential study limitations might relate to the fact that PV was not measured by prostatectomy specimens and there was PSA confounding for CII and PCA.  Conclusions:   Low values of PVI are directly associated with risk of PCA, which was almost 2.5 times higher in patients with a PVI ≤1.0. The PVI might be an effective parameter for clustering patients at risk of PCA. CII+ was inversely associated with risk of PCA and decreased the probability of detecting PCA by 43%.

Further, ectopic HN1 expression results an increase in the β-catenin degradation leading to loss of E-cadherin interaction, concurrently contributing to actin re-organization, colony formation and migration in cancer cell lines. Thus, we report that HN1 is an essential factor for β-catenin turnover and signaling, augments cell growth and migration in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Lokman Varisli', 'Bilge E Ozturk', 'Gencer K Akyuz', 'Kemal S Korkmaz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Ubiquitously expressed hematological and neurological expressed 1 downregulates Akt-mediated GSK3β signaling, and its knockdown results in deregulated G2/M transition in prostate cells.', 'Androgen regulated HN1 leads proteosomal degradation of androgen receptor (AR) and negatively influences AR mediated transactivation in prostate cells.', 'Activation of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) regulates the expression of N-cadherin, E-cadherin and β-catenin in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'TNFα-mediated loss of β-catenin/E-cadherin association and subsequent increase in cell migration is partially restored by NKX3.1 expression in prostate cells.', 'Roles and regulation of Wnt signaling and beta-catenin in prostate cancer.', 'HN1 Is Enriched in the S-Phase, Phosphorylated in Mitosis, and Contributes to Cyclin B1 Degradation in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Thirdhand Smoke May Promote Lung Adenocarcinoma Development through HN1.', 'HN1L/AP-2γ/PLK1 signaling drives tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Downregulation of circular RNA circ-HN1 suppressed the progression of gastric cancer through the miR-485-5p/GSK3A pathway.', 'Molecular mechanisms of the microRNA-132 during tumor progressions.']"""

Their role has previously been described in colorectal cancer, as well as in gastric, breast, thyroid, prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, glioma, liver, leukemia and many other cancers. In a previous study, we have described protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T, M, Z1 and Q genes (PTPRT, PTPRM, PTPRZ1 and PTPRQ) hypermethylated in sporadic colorectal cancer. Thus, in this study, we examined the relation of unbalanced chromosomal alterations within regions covering these four protein tyrosine phosphatase genes with this cancer. One hundred and two cancer tissues were molecularly characterized, including analysis of the BRAF and K-ras mutations and methylator phenotype. The analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed using Comparative Genomic Hybridization. We observed amplification of three regions containing genes coding for PTPs, such as PTPRZ1 (7q31.3, amplified in 23.5% of cases), PTPRQ (12q21.2, amplified in 5.9% of cases), PTPRT (20q12, amplified in 29.4% of cases), along with deletions in the region of PTPRM (18p11.2, deleted in 21.6% of cases). These data may suggest that in sporadic colorectal cancer PTPRZ1, PTPRT, PTPRQ probably act as oncogenes, while PTPRM acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Our study also revealed that gains on chromosome 20q12 and losses on chromosome 18p11.2 are connected with the absence of the BRAF mutation and the conventional adenocarcinoma pathway.""","""['Izabela Laczmanska', 'Pawel Karpinski', 'Joanna Kozlowska', 'Marek Bebenek', 'David Ramsey', 'Tomasz Sedziak', 'Piotr Ziolkowski', 'Maria M Sasiadek']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['High PTPRQ Expression and Its Relationship to Expression of PTPRZ1 and the Presence of KRAS Mutations in Colorectal Cancer Tissues.', 'Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-like genes are frequently hypermethylated in sporadic colorectal cancer.', 'The role of K-RAS and B-RAF mutations as biomarkers in metastatic colorectal cancer.', 'Tyrosine phosphatases as a superfamily of tumor suppressors in colorectal cancer.', 'Predictive and prognostic markers in colorectal cancer.', 'Role of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type M in epithelial ovarian cancer progression.', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Zeta 1 as a Potential Target in Cancer Therapy and Diagnosis.', 'Hereditable variants of classical protein tyrosine phosphatase genes: Will they prove innocent or guilty?', 'Identification of New Tumor-Related Gene Mutations in Chinese Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.', 'PTPRM, a candidate tumor suppressor gene in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between 2002 and 2007, 75 patients with clinical stage T3 prostate cancer received cryosurgery as primary treatment in our institution. No adjuvant treatment was provided until biochemical failure. After biochemical failure, hormone therapy was administered. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the OS, CSS, and BPFS. Cox regression was used to identify factors predictive of survival.  Results:   Clinical stage T3a (cT3a) was detected in 60% (45/75) of patients and cT3b detected in 40% (30/75). The 5-year OS, CSS, and BPFS rates were 85.3%, 92.0%, and 48%, respectively.

Objective:   To assess the value added by percentage of free to total PSA (%fPSA), prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), and a kallikrein panel (4k-panel) to the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) multivariable prediction models: risk calculator (RC) 4, including transrectal ultrasound, and RC 4 plus digital rectal examination (4+DRE) for prescreened men.  Design, setting, and participants:   Participants were invited for rescreening between October 2007 and February 2009 within the Dutch part of the ERSPC study. Biopsies were taken in men with a PSA level ≥3.0 ng/ml or a PCA3 score ≥10. Additional analyses of the 4k-panel were done on serum samples.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Outcome was defined as PCa detectable by sextant biopsy. Receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analyses were performed to compare the predictive capabilities of %fPSA, PCA3, 4k-panel, the ERSPC RCs, and their combinations in logistic regression models.  Results and limitations:   PCa was detected in 119 of 708 men. The %fPSA did not perform better univariately or added to the RCs compared with the RCs alone. In 202 men with an elevated PSA, the 4k-panel discriminated better than PCA3 when modelled univariately (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.78 vs. 0.62; p=0.01). The multivariable models with PCA3 or the 4k-panel were equivalent (AUC: 0.80 for RC 4+DRE). In the total population, PCA3 discriminated better than the 4k-panel (univariate AUC: 0.63 vs. 0.56; p=0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the multivariable model with PCA3 (AUC: 0.73) versus the model with the 4k-panel (AUC: 0.71; p=0.18). The multivariable model with PCA3 performed better than the reference model (0.73 vs. 0.70; p=0.02). Decision curves confirmed these patterns, although numbers were small.

Sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition was enhanced specifically in vitro and in vivo by genetic or pharmacologic blockade of DVL3. In breast and prostate cancer cells, sensitization tracked with enhanced MEK-ERK activation and relied upon MEK activity and DVL3 expression. Mechanistic investigations showed that DVL3 is present in an adaptor complex that links IGFIR to RAS, which includes Shc, growth factor receptor-bound-2 (Grb2), son-of-sevenless (SOS), and the tumor suppressor DAB2. Dual DVL and DAB2 blockade synergized in activating ERKs and sensitizing cells to IGFIR inhibition, suggesting a nonredundant role for DVL3 in the Shc-Grb2-SOS complex. Clinically, tumors that responded to IGFIR inhibition contained relatively lower levels of DVL3 protein than resistant tumors, and DVL3 levels in tumors correlated inversely with progression-free survival in patients treated with IGFIR antibodies. Because IGFIR does not contain activating mutations analogous to EGFR variants associated with response to EGFR inhibitors, we suggest that IGF signaling achieves an equivalent integration at the postreceptor level through adaptor protein complexes, influencing cellular dependence on the IGF axis and identifying a patient population with potential to benefit from IGFIR inhibition.""","""['Shan Gao', 'Ilirjana Bajrami', 'Clare Verrill', 'Asha Kigozi', 'Djamila Ouaret', 'Tamara Aleksic', 'Ruth Asher', 'Cheng Han', 'Paul Allen', 'Deborah Bailey', 'Stephan Feller', 'Takeshi Kashima', 'Nicholas Athanasou', 'Jean-Yves Blay', 'Sandra Schmitz', 'Jean-Pascal Machiels', 'Nav Upile', 'Terry M Jones', 'George Thalmann', 'Shazad Q Ashraf', 'Jennifer L Wilding', 'Walter F Bodmer', 'Mark R Middleton', 'Alan Ashworth', 'Christopher J Lord', 'Valentine M Macaulay']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer cells is mediated by loss of IGF-binding proteins.', 'Cetuximab-induced insulin-like growth factor receptor\xa0I activation mediates cetuximab resistance in gastric cancer\xa0cells.', 'Feedback mechanisms promote cooperativity for small molecule inhibitors of epidermal and insulin-like growth factor receptors.', 'Inhibitors of Ras signal transduction as antitumor agents.', 'Activation of Ras by receptor tyrosine kinases.', 'RNA-Binding Protein MEX3A Interacting with DVL3 Stabilizes Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Endometrial Carcinoma.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'The multifaceted role of lemur tyrosine kinase 3 in health and disease.', 'Lemur Tyrosine Kinases and Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'KHSRP-bound small nucleolar RNAs associate with promotion of cell invasiveness and metastasis of pancreatic cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   From 1990 to 2012, we collected data on 4734 patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic LN dissection (ePLND). Of these, 4453 (94%) had no prior prostate surgery ('naïve patients'), while 286 (6%) had previously undergone surgery for LUTS. Two LNI prediction models based on patients treated with ePLND were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve (AUC), the calibration plot method, and decision-curve analyses.  Results:   The rate of LNI was 12%, while the median number of LNs removed was 15 in both groups (P = 0.9). The two tested nomograms provided more accurate prediction in naïve patients than for those previously treated with prostate surgery for LUTS (AUC: 82% and 81% vs 68% and 71%, P = 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively). In naïve patients the surgeon would have missed one LNI for every 53 and 34 avoided ePLND using the Briganti and Godoy nomograms, respectively; in patients previously treated with surgery for LUTS, a LNI would have been missed in 13 and 21 patients not undergoing ePLND.  Conclusion:   The accuracy and the clinical net-benefit of LNI prediction tools decrease significantly in patients with prior prostate surgery for LUTS. These models should be avoided in such patients, who should undergo routine ePLND.""","""['Nicola Fossati', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Umberto Capitanio', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Alessandro Larcher', 'Alessandro Nini', 'Vincenzo Mirone', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['External validation of the updated nomogram predicting lymph node invasion in patients with prostate cancer undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'A Novel Nomogram to Identify Candidates for Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection Among Patients with Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Diagnosed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted and Systematic Biopsies.', 'Development and Internal Validation of a Novel Model to Identify the Candidates for Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer: indications, extent and tailored approaches.', 'Current status of pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer: the New York PLND nomogram.', 'Development and internal validation of a novel nomogram for predicting lymph node invasion for prostate cancer patients undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection.']"""

To examine any increase of the interobserver agreement with the use of an autosegmentation tool.  Methods:   We created atlases in the ABAS™ system v. 2.0 (Elekta, Crawley, UK) and recorded the time to delineate the above structures on eight patients with and without its aid. We also measured the interobserver agreement in the structure definitions using several metrics [Dice's similarity coefficient (DSC), mean distance to conformity, percentage volume difference] with and without the aid of ABAS.  Results:   There is a high degree of correlation between the time saving with the use of ABAS and the degree of interobserver agreement (r = 0.90 for DSC). This indicates that for structures where the interobserver agreement is low (DSC < 0.65), the ABAS does not reduce outlining time. We found that the interobserver agreement is increased with ABAS only for the prostate.  Conclusion:   Outlining time saved in the male pelvis is highly correlated with the interobserver agreement of the structures. Only for the prostate does the use of ABAS significantly reduce the amount of interobserver variation in contouring.  Advances in knowledge:   The use of autosegmentation software increases the outlining time for structures where the interobserver agreement is low. Any increase in the interobserver agreement in contouring with the aid of such software may be limited to those structures where there is currently mid-range agreement between observers.""","""['K A Langmack', 'C Perry', 'C Sinstead', 'J Mills', 'D Saunders']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Assessment of accuracy and efficiency of atlas-based autosegmentation for prostate radiotherapy in a variety of clinical conditions.', 'Autosegmentation of prostate anatomy for radiation treatment planning using deep decision forests of radiomic features.', 'Multi-observer contouring of male pelvic anatomy: Highly variable agreement across conventional and emerging structures of interest.', 'Automatic segmentation of thoracic and pelvic CT images for radiotherapy planning using implicit anatomic knowledge and organ-specific segmentation strategies.', 'Pelvic normal tissue contouring guidelines for radiation therapy: a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group consensus panel atlas.', 'Evaluating the Effectiveness of Deep Learning Contouring across Multiple Radiotherapy Centres.', 'The clinical evaluation of atlas-based auto-segmentation for automatic contouring during cervical cancer radiotherapy.', 'Clinical validation of an automatic atlas-based segmentation tool for male pelvis CT images.', 'Manual versus semiautomatic segmentation of soft-tissue sarcomas on magnetic resonance imaging: evaluation of similarity and comparison of segmentation times.', 'Validation of automated magnetic resonance image segmentation for radiation therapy planning in prostate cancer.']"""

Therefore, we investigated the effect of TSS on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and invasion in three different human carcinoma cell lines. Our findings showed that MMP-9 activity was significantly increased in response to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and that TSS reduced TNF-α-induced MMP-9 activity in a dose-dependent manner. TSS also downregulated both MMP-9 expression and TNF-α-induced MMP-9 promoter activity. Using a matrigel invasion assay, we showed that TSS significantly attenuated invasive rates in TNF-α-stimulated LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells. Furthermore, TSS suppressed TNF-α-induced NF-κB activity, which is a potential transcriptional factor for regulating many invasive genes, including MMP-9, by suppressing IκB degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits in LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells. TSS also downregulated TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and Akt, and a selective PI3K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, diminished TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation followed by levels of MMP-9, suggesting that TSS also reduces MMP-9 expression by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt-mediated NF-κB pathway.

However, the routine use of b values higher than 1000 s/mm(2) is not clear up to present. Moreover, the complex diffusion behavior of malignant and benign prostate tissues hampers precise predictions of contrast in DWI images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.  Purpose:   To quantitatively analyze DWI with different b values in prostate cancer and to identify b values best suitable for cancer detection.  Material and methods:   Forty-one patients with histologically proven prostate cancer were examined with high resolution T2-weighted imaging and DWI at 3 Tesla. Five different b values (0, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000 s/mm(2)) were applied. ADC values of tumors and reference areas were measured on ADC maps derived from different pairs of b values. Furthermore, signal intensities of DW images of tumors and reference areas were measured. For analysis, contrast ratios of ADC values and signal intensities of DW images were calculated and compared.  Results:   No significant differences were found between contrast ratios measured on ADC maps of all analyzed b value pairs (P = 0.43). Contrast ratios calculated from signal intensities of DW images were highest at b values of 1500 and 2000 s/mm(2) and differed significantly from contrast ratios at b values of 800 and 1000 s/mm(2) (P < 0.01).  Conclusion:   Whereas contrast in ADC maps does not significantly change with different b values, contrast ratios of DW images are significantly higher at b-values of 1500 and 2000 s/mm(2) in comparison to b values of 800 and 1000 s/mm(2).

In this work, we examined a statistical model based on the gamma distribution.  Methods:   First, the proposed gamma model, the bi-exponential model, and the truncated Gaussian model were compared for goodness of fit. To evaluate diagnostic capability, area fractions of certain D ranges were evaluated. The area fraction for D < 1.0 mm2/s (frac < 1) was attributed to small cancer cells with restricted diffusion, and the area fraction for D > 3.0 mm2/s (frac > 3) was considered to reflect perfusion component. A clinical data set of histologically proven prostate cancer cases from previous study was used.  Results:   For the cancer tissue, the gamma model was better fit than the truncated Gaussian model, and there was no significant difference between the gamma model and the bi-exponential model. For the normal peripheral zone tissue, there was no significant differences among all models. In the 2D scatter plot of frac < 1 vs. frac > 3, Cancer and non-cancer tissues were clearly separated.

Here we aim to identify the Ig class that causes this discrimination, to identify on cancer cells the corresponding P1 antigen recognised by circulating anti-P1 antibodies and to shed light into the possible function of this glycosphingolipid.  Methods:   An independent Australian cohort was assessed for the presence of anti-P1 IgG and IgM class antibodies using suspension array. Monoclonal and human derived anti-glycan antibodies were verified using three independent glycan-based immunoassays and flow cytometry-based inhibition assay. The P1 antigen was detected by LC-MS/MS and flow cytometry. FACS-sorted cell lines were studied on the cellular migration by colorimetric assay and real-time measurement using xCELLigence system.  Results:   Here we show in a second independent cohort (n=155) that the discrimination of cancer patients is mediated by the IgM class of anti-P1 antibodies (P=0.0002). The presence of corresponding antigen P1 and structurally related epitopes in fresh tissue specimens and cultured cancer cells is demonstrated. We further link the antibody and antigen (P1) by showing that human naturally circulating and affinity-purified anti-P1 IgM isolated from patients ascites can bind to naturally expressed P1 on the cell surface of ovarian cancer cells. Cell-sorted IGROV1 was used to obtain two study subpopulations (P1-high, 66.1%; and P1-low, 33.3%) and observed that cells expressing high P1-levels migrate significantly faster than those with low P1-levels.  Conclusions:   This is the first report showing that P1 antigen, known to be expressed on erythrocytes only, is also present on ovarian cancer cells. This suggests that P1 is a novel tumour-associated carbohydrate antigen recognised by the immune system in patients and may have a role in cell migration.

Here, the molecular and in vivo consequence of retinoblastoma status was analyzed in models of clinical relevance.  Experimental design:   Experimental work was performed with multiple isogenic prostate cancer cell lines (hormone sensitive: LNCaP and LAPC4 cells and hormone resistant C42, 22Rv1 cells; stable knockdown of retinoblastoma using shRNA). Multiple mechanisms were interrogated including cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair. Transcriptome analysis was performed, validated, and mechanisms discerned. Cell survival was measured using clonogenic cell survival assay and in vivo analysis was performed in nude mice with human derived tumor xenografts.  Results:   Loss of retinoblastoma enhanced the radioresponsiveness of both hormone-sensitive and castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation was not mediated by cell cycle or p53. Retinoblastoma loss led to alteration in DNA damage repair and activation of the NF-κB pathway and subsequent cellular apoptosis through PLK3. In vivo xenografts of retinoblastoma-deficient tumors exhibited diminished tumor mass, lower PSA kinetics, and decreased tumor growth after treatment with ionizing radiation (P < 0.05).

We report the study design, participant sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and the initial results of the testing and diagnostic phase of the Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial, which aims to investigate the effectiveness of treatments for localised prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this randomised phase 3 trial, men aged 50-69 years registered at 337 primary care centres in nine UK cities were invited to attend a specialist nurse appointment for a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. Prostate biopsies were offered to men with a PSA concentration of 3·0 μg/L or higher. Consenting participants with clinically localised prostate cancer were randomly assigned to active monitoring (surveillance strategy), radical prostatectomy, or three-dimensional conformal external-beam radiotherapy by a computer-generated allocation system. Randomisation was stratified by site (minimised for differences in participant age, PSA results, and Gleason score). The primary endpoint is prostate cancer mortality at a median 10-year follow-up, ascertained by an independent committee, which will be analysed by intention to treat in 2016. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02044172, and as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN20141297.  Findings:   Between Oct 1, 2001, and Jan 20, 2009, 228,966 men were invited to attend an appointment with a specialist nurse. Of the invited men, 100,444 (44%) attended their initial appointment and 82,429 (82%) of attenders had a PSA test. PSA concentration was below the biopsy threshold in 73,538 (89%) men. Of the 8566 men with a PSA concentration of 3·0-19·9 μg/L, 7414 (87%) underwent biopsies. 2896 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer (4% of tested men and 39% of those who had a biopsy), of whom 2417 (83%) had clinically localised disease (mostly T1c, Gleason score 6). With the addition of 247 pilot study participants recruited between 1999 and 2001, 2664 men were eligible for the treatment trial and 1643 (62%) agreed to be randomly assigned (545 to active monitoring, 545 to radiotherapy, and 553 to radical prostatectomy). Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of randomly assigned participants were balanced across treatment groups.  Interpretation:   The ProtecT trial randomly assigned 1643 men with localised prostate cancer to active monitoring, radiotherapy, or surgery. Participant clinicopathological features are more consistent with contemporary patient characteristics than in previous prostate cancer treatment trials.

Therefore, there is a serious necessity for finding advanced alternative therapeutic measures against this lethal malignancy. In this article, we report the cytotoxicity and the mechanism of cell death of the methanolic extract prepared from Echinophora platyloba DC plant against human prostate adenocarcinoma PC 3 cell line and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells HUVEC cell line.  Methods:   Cytotoxicity and viability of the methanolic extract were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and dye exclusion assay. Cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to quantify the nucleosome production resulting from nuclear DNA fragmentation during apoptosis and determine whether the mechanism involves induction of apoptosis or necrosis. The cell death was identified as apoptosis using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and DNA fragmentation gel electrophoresis.  Results:   E. platyloba could decrease cell viability in malignant cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC50 values against PC 3 were determined as 236.136 ± 12.4, 143.400 ± 7.2, and 69.383 ± 1.29 μg/ml after 24, 36, and 48 h, respectively, but there was no significant activity in HUVEC normal cell (IC50 > 800 μg/ml). Morphological characterizations and DNA laddering assay showed that the methanolic extract treated cells displayed marked apoptotic characteristics such as nuclear fragmentation, appearance of apoptotic bodies, and DNA laddering fragment. Increase in an early apoptotic population was observed in a dose-dependent manner. PC 3 cell death elicited by the extract was found to be apoptotic in nature based a clear indication of TUNEL assay and gel electrophoresis DNA fragmentation, which is a hallmark of apoptosis.  Conclusions:   In summary, the E. platyloba extract attenuated the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell proliferation in vitro possibly by inducing apoptosis.

However, due to limited specificity and sensitivity, there is a need for new tracers with higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing prostate cancer to improve tracer uptake and enhance imaging contrast. The aim of this study was to compare the properties of [(11)C]choline ([(11)C]CHO) with S(+)-β-methyl-[(11)C]choline ([(11)C]SMC) as tracer for prostate cancer imaging in a human prostate tumor mouse xenograft model by small-animal positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT).  Procedures:   We carried out a dual-tracer small-animal PET/CT study comparing [(11)C]CHO and [(11)C]SMC. The androgen-independent human prostate tumor cell line PC3 was implanted subcutaneously in the flanks of Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) (nu/nu) mice (n = 11). Mice-6 weeks post-xenograft implantation-were injected with 37 MBq [(11)C]CHO via the tail vein. On a separate day, the mice were injected with 37 MBq [(11)C]SMC. Dynamic imaging was performed for 60 min with the Inveon animal PET/CT scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions) on two separate days (randomizing the sequence of the tracers). The dynamic PET images were acquired in list mode. Regions of interest (5 × 5 × 5 mm) were placed in transaxial slices in tumor, muscle (thigh), liver, kidney, and blood. Image analysis was performed calculating tumor to muscle (T/M) ratios based on summed images as well as dynamic data.  Results:   For [(11)C]SMC, the mean T/M ratio was 2.24 ± 0.56 while the corresponding mean [(11)C]CHO T/M ratio was 1.35 ± 0.28. The T/M ratio for [(11)C]SMC was significant higher compared to [(11)C]CHO (p < 0.001). The time course of T/M ratio (T/Mdyn ratio) of [(11)C]SMC was higher compared to [(11)C]CHO with a statistically significant difference between the magnitudes of the T/M ratios and a significant different change of the T/M ratios over time between [(11)C]CHO and [(11)C]SMC.  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrate that [(11)C]SMC is taken up by the tumor in the PC-3 prostate cancer xenograft model.

Methods:   This retrospective study included 78 patients with high-risk PC undergoing 3.0-T MRI (supplemented by DWI) before and after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Based on follow-up clinical examinations, patients were divided into two groups: the recurrence group (patients who suffered biochemical/clinical recurrence within 3 years, n = 13) and the non-recurrence group (patients who were recurrence free for over 3 years, n = 65). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values before and after IMRT were compared between these two groups. The receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was carried out to investigate the discriminatory capability for pre- and post-IMRT ADC values.  Results:   The overall ADC values were 1.04 ± 0.18 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) for PCs before IMRT and 1.45 ± 0.15 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) after IMRT (p < 0.001). A statistically significant difference in post-IMRT ADC values was noted between patients with and without recurrence (1.27 ± 0.14 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) vs 1.49 ± 0.12 × 10(-3)mm(2) s(-1); p < 0.001), although there was no statistical difference between them in pre-IMRT ADC values (1.00 ± 0.17 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) vs 1.05 ± 0.18 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1); p = 0.31). The ROC curve analysis revealed that the post-IMRT ADC values could help identify patients suffering recurrences (area under the curve, 0.88; p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Marked increase in ADC values was observed in PC after radiotherapy, especially in good responders. DWI is a valuable tool for monitoring the response to radiotherapy.

On the other hand, derivation of NK-like cells from more abundant cell sources such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and umbilical cord blood (UCB) requires the selection of rare CD34+ cells. Thus, we sought to convert adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), which are abundant and natively CD34+, into NK-like cells. When grown in hematopoietic induction medium, ADSCs formed sphere clusters and expressed hematopoietic markers CD34, CD45, and KDR. Further induction in NK cell-specific medium resulted in a population of cells that expressed NK cell marker CD56, and thus termed ADSC-NK. Alternatively, the hematopoietically induced ADSCs were transduced with NK cell-specific transcription factor E4BP4 prior to induction in NK cell-specific medium. This latter population of cells, termed ADSC-NKE, expressed CD56 and additional NK cell markers such as CD16, CD94, CD158, CD314, FasL, and NKp46. ADSC-NKE was as potent as NK leukemia cell NKL in killing breast cancer cell MCF7 and prostate cancer cells DU145, PC3, LnCap, DuPro, C4-2 and CWR22, but exhibited no killing activity toward normal endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In nude mice test ADSC-NKE was able to significantly delay the progression of tumors formed by MCF7 and PC3. When injected into immunocompetent rats, ADSC-NKE was detectable in bone marrow and spleen for at least 5 weeks. Together, these results suggest that ADSCs can be converted into NK-like cells with anti-tumor activities.""","""['Hongxiu Ning', 'Hong-En Lei', 'Yong-De Xu', 'Rui-Li Guan', 'Jeffrey M Venstrom', 'Guiting Lin', 'Tom F Lue', 'Zhongcheng Xin', 'Ching-Shwun Lin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['NK cells differentiated from bone marrow, cord blood and peripheral blood stem cells exhibit similar phenotype and functions.', 'The Notch ligands Jagged2, Delta1, and Delta4 induce differentiation and expansion of functional human NK cells from CD34+ cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells.', 'The basic leucine zipper transcription factor E4BP4 is essential for natural killer cell development.', 'Human natural killer cell development from bone marrow progenitors: analysis of phenotype, cytotoxicity and growth.', 'The phenotypic and functional characteristics of umbilical cord blood and peripheral blood natural killer cells.', 'Closing the Door with CRISPR: Genome Editing of CCR5 and CXCR4 as a Potential Curative Solution for HIV.', 'Biallelic, Selectable, Knock-in Targeting of CCR5 via CRISPR-Cas9 Mediated Homology Directed Repair Inhibits HIV-1 Replication.', 'Stem cells-derived natural killer cells for cancer immunotherapy: current protocols, feasibility, and benefits of ex vivo generated natural killer cells in treatment of advanced solid tumors.', 'Increased Efficiency for Biallelic Mutations of the CCR5 Gene by CRISPR-Cas9 Using Multiple Guide RNAs As a Novel Therapeutic Option for Human Immunodeficiency Virus.', 'Application of adipose-derived stem cells in photoaging: basic science and literature review.']"""

XIAP is frequently overexpressed in human leukemia and prostate and breast tumors. Inhibition of apoptosis by XIAP is mainly coordinated through direct binding to the initiator caspase-9 via its baculovirus-IAP-repeat-3 (BIR3) domain. XIAP inhibits caspases directly making it to an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. In the search for novel, non-peptidic XIAP inhibitors in this study we focused on the chemical constituents of sāng bái pí (mulberry root bark). Most promising candidates of this plant were tested biochemically in vitro by a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay and in vivo via protein fragment complementation analysis (PCA). We identified the Diels Alder adduct Sanggenon G (SG1) as a novel, small-molecular weight inhibitor of XIAP. As shown by FP and PCA analyses, SG1 binds specifically to the BIR3 domain of XIAP with a binding affinity of 34.26 μM. Treatment of the transgenic leukemia cell line Molt3/XIAP with SG1 enhances caspase-8, -3 and -9 cleavage, displaces caspase-9 from XIAP as determined by immunoprecipitation experiments and sensitizes these cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis. SG1 not only sensitizes the XIAP-overexpressing leukemia cell line Molt3/XIAP to etoposide treatment but also different neuroblastoma cell lines endogenously expressing high XIAP levels.

The current standard of care for metastatic cancer, doxorubicin (DOX), is presented with challenges, namely toxicity due to a lack of specificity and targeted delivery. Nano-enabled targeted drug delivery systems can provide an avenue to overcome these issues. Nanodiamonds (ND), in particular, have been researched over the past five years for use in various drug delivery systems but minimal work has been done that incorporates targeting capability. In this study, a novel targeted drug delivery system for bone metastatic prostate cancer was developed, characterized, and evaluated in vitro. NDs were conjugated with the Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala (DGEA) peptide to target α2β1 integrins over-expressed in prostate cancers during metastasis. To facilitate drug delivery, DOX was adsorbed to the surface of the ND-DGEA conjugates. Successful preparation of the ND-DGEA conjugates and the ND-DGEA+DOX system was confirmed with transmission electron microscopy, hydrodynamic size, and zeta potential measurements. Since traditional DOX treatment regimens lack specificity and increased toxicity to normal tissues, the ND-DGEA conjugates were designed to distinguish between cells that overexpress α2β1 integrin, bone metastatic prostate cancers cells (PC3), and cells that do not, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). Utilizing the ND-DGEA+DOX system, the efficacy of 1 µg/mL and 2 µg/mL DOX doses increased from 2.5% to 12% cell death and 11% to 34% cell death, respectively. These studies confirmed that the delivery and efficacy of DOX were enhanced by ND-DGEA conjugates. Thus, the targeted ND-DGEA+DOX system provides a novel approach for decreasing toxicity and drug doses.""","""['Amanee D Salaam', 'Patrick Hwang', 'Roberus McIntosh', 'Hadiyah N Green', 'Ho-Wook Jun', 'Derrick Dean']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Beilstein J Nanotechnol""","""['Nanodiamonds enhance therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin in treating metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Integrin α2β1 Targeting DGEA-Modified Liposomal Doxorubicin Enhances Antitumor Efficacy against Breast Cancer.', 'In vivo enhancement of anticancer therapy using bare or chemotherapeutic drug-bearing nanodiamond particles.', 'Cy5.5-Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala (DGEA).', '64Cu-1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid-Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala.', 'Integrin α2β1-targeting ferritin nanocarrier traverses the blood-brain barrier for effective glioma chemotherapy.', 'High-tolerance crystalline hydrogels formed from self-assembling cyclic dipeptide.', 'Physalis Mottle Virus-like Nanoparticles for Targeted Cancer Imaging.', 'Characterization and Molecular Mechanism of Peptide-Conjugated Gold Nanoparticle Inhibiting p53-HDM2 Interaction in Retinoblastoma.', 'Fluorescent nanodiamonds engage innate immune effector cells: A potential vehicle for targeted anti-tumor immunotherapy.']"""

Genome sequencing has been extensively applied to the study of the cancer genomes. Although a few methods have been already proposed for the detection of cancer-related genes, their automatic identification is still a challenging task. Using the genomic data made available by The Cancer Genome Atlas Consortium (TCGA), we propose a new prioritization approach based on the analysis of the distribution of putative deleterious variants in a large cohort of cancer samples.  Results:   In this paper, we present ContastRank, a new method for the prioritization of putative impaired genes in cancer. The method is based on the comparison of the putative defective rate of each gene in tumor versus normal and 1000 genome samples. We show that the method is able to provide a ranked list of putative impaired genes for colon, lung and prostate adenocarcinomas. The list significantly overlaps with the list of known cancer driver genes previously published. More importantly, by using our scoring approach, we can successfully discriminate between TCGA normal and tumor samples. A binary classifier based on ContrastRank score reaches an overall accuracy >90% and the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) >0.95 for all the three types of adenocarcinoma analyzed in this paper. In addition, using ContrastRank score, we are able to discriminate the three tumor types with a minimum overall accuracy of 77% and AUC of 0.83.  Conclusions:   We describe ContrastRank, a method for prioritizing putative impaired genes in cancer. The method is based on the comparison of exome sequencing data from different cohorts and can detect putative cancer driver genes. ContrastRank can also be used to estimate a global score for an individual genome about the risk of adenocarcinoma based on the genetic variants information from a whole-exome VCF (Variant Calling Format) file. We believe that the application of ContrastRank can be an important step in genomic medicine to enable genome-based diagnosis.  Availability and implementation:   The lists of ContrastRank scores of all genes in each tumor type are available as supplementary materials. A webserver for evaluating the risk of the three studied adenocarcinomas starting from whole-exome VCF file is under development.

Studies on its regulation have mostly focused on the negative 3'UTR binding of miR200c. Interestingly, it has been previously reported that androgen receptor (AR) regulates ZEB1 expression in breast and prostate cancers. In order to validate this, various ZEB1 promoter deletions were cloned into a luciferase reporter system to elucidate the contribution of two putative androgen response elements (AREs). The in vivo contribution of AR was also assessed in cell lines after R1881 treatment using qPCR with prostate specific antigen (PSA) as the positive control. We discovered that AR upregulates the levels of expression of ZEB1 10-fold on a luciferase promoter that only contains the distal ARE. However, when the proximal ARE is included, no additional activation is apparent with AR or its hormone independent variant, AR-V7. Furthermore, we demonstrate here that a promoter construct containing both AREs activates transcription of ZEB1 even in the AR-null cell lines DU145 and PC3. Incubation of the AR-positive cell line, LNCaP with R1881, failed to substantially increase the expression levels of ZEB1. Despite the presence of AREs in the promoter region, it appears that ZEB1 expression can be induced even without AR. In addition, the region around the distal ARE is a potent repressor in AR-null cell lines.""","""['Steven M Mooney', 'Princy Parsana', 'James R Hernandez', 'Xin Liu', 'James E Verdone', 'Gonzalo Torga', 'Calvin A Harberg', 'Kenneth J Pienta']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Reciprocal regulation of ZEB1 and AR in triple negative breast cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', ""Transcriptional regulation of the androgen signaling pathway by the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1."", 'Oncogenic functions of the EMT-related transcription factor ZEB1 in breast cancer.', 'The Transcription Factors Zeb1 and Snail Induce Cell Malignancy and Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype in Prostate Cells, Increasing Androgen Synthesis Capacity and Therapy Resistance.', 'An Overview of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition in Canine Tumors: How Far Have We Come?', 'The transcriptional factor ZEB1 represses Syndecan 1 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Ovol2 induces mesenchymal-epithelial transition via targeting ZEB1 in osteosarcoma.', 'A novel capillary nano-immunoassay for assessing androgen receptor splice variant 7 in plasma.

However, historical rates of initial surveillance are low (4-20%), and little is known about its application among community-based urology practices.  Objective:   To describe contemporary utilization of AS among a population-based sample of men with low-risk prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed a prospective cohort study of men with low-risk prostate cancer managed by urologists participating in the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The principal outcome was receipt of AS as initial management for low-risk prostate cancer including the frequency of follow-up prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, prostate biopsy, and local therapy. We examined variation in the use of surveillance according to patient characteristics and across MUSIC practices. Finally, we used claims data to validate treatment classification in the MUSIC registry.  Results and limitations:   We identified 682 low-risk patients from 17 MUSIC practices. Overall, 49% of men underwent initial AS. Use of initial surveillance varied widely across practices (27-80%; p=0.005), even after accounting for differences in patient characteristics. Among men undergoing initial surveillance with at least 12 mo of follow-up, PSA testing was common (85%), whereas repeat biopsy was performed in only one-third of patients. There was excellent agreement between treatment assignments in the MUSIC registry and claims data (κ=0.93). Limitations include unknown treatment for 8% of men with low-risk cancer.  Conclusions:   Half of men in Michigan with low-risk prostate cancer receive initial AS. Because this proportion is much higher than reported previously, our findings suggest growing acceptance of this strategy for reducing overtreatment.

Meanwhile, PSA testing has shifted prostate cancer case populations for study to include a greater proportion of asymptomatic and indolent disease. Thus, efforts to identify prostate cancer biomarkers-particularly for aggressive disease-are required to elucidate pathogenesis and aid screening efficacy. Current evidence suggests that decreased circulating concentrations of the testis-derived, TGFβ family peptide hormone-anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)-may be associated with prostate cancer pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we measured AMH concentrations in prediagnostic (cohort baseline) sera using the Beckman Coulter AMH Gen II ELISA in 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls nested within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Controls were frequency matched to cases on age at entry, enrollment year, and years of follow-up. Unconditional logistic regression models, adjusted for age at randomization, were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We found that prediagnostic serologic AMH concentrations were not significantly associated with total (ORQ4 vs. Q1 = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.89-1.48; Ptrend = 0.13), aggressive (ORQ4 vs. Q1 = 1.14; 95% CI, 0.80-1.63; Ptrend = 0.51), or nonaggressive (ORQ4 vs. Q1 = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.91-1.63; Ptrend = 0.07) prostate cancer risks. Different definitions of aggressive disease did not meaningfully alter these results. Despite in vitro studies linking AMH to prostate cancer, this first analysis of prediagnostic, circulating AMH concentrations in men provides no evidence for an association with prostate cancer risk.""","""['Martha M Sklavos', 'Cindy Ke Zhou', 'Ligia A Pinto', 'Michael B Cook']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Circulating anti-Müllerian hormone and breast cancer risk: A study in ten prospective cohorts.', 'Serum vitamin D concentration and prostate cancer risk: a nested case-control study.', 'Anti-Müllerian hormone and risk of ovarian cancer in nine cohorts.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Anti-mullerian hormone attenuates insulin resistance and systemic inflammation in old obese C57BL/6 male mice.', 'Demographic, lifestyle, and other factors in relation to antimüllerian hormone levels in mostly late premenopausal women.', 'Serum anti-mullerian hormone and all-cause mortality in men.']"""

Design:   Descriptive, longitudinal study.  Setting:   Two radiation therapy departments located in a comprehensive cancer center and a community-based oncology program in northern California.  Sample:   168 outpatients with prostate, breast, brain, or lung cancer and 85 of their family caregivers (FCs).  Methods:   Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was employed to identify latent classes of individuals based on QOL scores measured prior to, during, and for four months following completion of radiation therapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in 16 candidate cytokine genes were tested between the latent classes. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationships among genotypic and phenotypic characteristics and QOL GMM group membership.  Main research variables:   QOL latent class membership and variations in cytokine genes.  Findings:   Two latent QOL classes were found: higher and lower. Patients and FCs who were younger, identified with an ethnic minority group, had poorer functional status, or had children living at home were more likely to belong to the lower QOL class. After controlling for significant covariates, between-group differences were found in SNPs in interleukin 1 receptor 2 (IL1R2) and nuclear factor kappa beta 2 (NFKB2). For IL1R2, carrying one or two doses of the rare C allele was associated with decreased odds of belonging to the lower QOL class. For NFKB2, carriers with two doses of the rare G allele were more likely to belong to the lower QOL class.  Conclusions:   Unique genetic markers in cytokine genes may partially explain interindividual variability in QOL.  Implications for nursing:   Determination of high-risk characteristics and unique genetic markers would allow for earlier identification of patients with cancer and FCs at higher risk for poorer QOL. Knowledge of these risk factors could assist in the development of more targeted clinical or supportive care interventions for those identified.""","""['Kimberly Alexander', 'Bruce Cooper', 'Steven M Paul', 'Claudia West', 'Patsy Yates', 'Kord M Kober', 'Bradley E Aouizerat', 'Christine Miaskowski']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Nurs Forum""","""['Phenotypic and molecular characteristics associated with various domains of quality of life in oncology patients and their family caregivers.', 'Cytokine gene variation is associated with depressive symptom trajectories in oncology patients and family caregivers.', 'Phenotypic and Molecular Evidence Suggests That Decrements in Morning and Evening Energy Are Distinct but Related Symptoms.', 'Cytokine gene polymorphism and progression of renal and cardiovascular diseases.', 'Sleep disturbance interventions in oncology patients and family caregivers: a comprehensive review and meta-analysis.', 'Genetic Variations and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL): A Genome-Wide Study Approach.', ""Cytokine Genetic Variants and Health-Related Quality of Life in Crohn's Disease: An Exploratory Study."", 'The combined polymorphisms of interleukin-6-174GG genotype and interleukin-10 ATA haplotype are associated with a poor quality of life in patients with chronic hepatitis C.', 'Cytokine Gene Polymorphisms Associated With Various Domains of Quality of Life in Women With Breast Cancer.', 'Phenotypic and molecular characteristics associated with various domains of quality of life in oncology patients and their family caregivers.']"""

Research approach:   Qualitative grounded theory.  Setting:   Southern California.  Participants:   17 Latino sons of PCa survivors.  Methodologic approach:   The team conducted semistructured interviews and follow-up interviews. Therefore, the sample includes 25 transcripts. Data were analyzed with a mix of a priori topical codes and grounded theory techniques.  Findings:   Sons were in need of information about familial risk and screening options. They became sensitized to PCa, desired information, and held protective intentions. Hopeful intentions came up against cultural taboos around sex, reproductive health, and intimacy that limited discussions between fathers and sons. Fathers were a valued source of information but play various roles, which affect sons' screening intentions. Open communication between father and son promoted awareness of screening and familial risk.  Conclusions:   Uncertainty about familial risk and screening options, especially early detection strategies, was exacerbated by cultural taboos around PCa. Fathers could have been primary and credible advocates for shared decision making, but sons had difficulty learning from their fathers' experience.  Interpretation:   FINDINGS from the study can help inform community-based interventions with Latino families, help to culturally tailor health messaging, and sensitize clinicians to a group that needs concerted counseling about PCa risk and screening.""","""['Elisabeth M Hicks', 'Mark S Litwin', 'Sally L Maliski']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Nurs Forum""","""[""African-American Fathers' Perspectives on Facilitators and Barriers to Father-Son Sexual Health Communication."", 'Father-Son Communication About Consistent and Correct Condom Use.', 'Examining cultural factors that influence treatment decisions: a pilot study of Latino men with cancer.', ""Engaging Latino Fathers in Children's Eating and Other Obesity-Related Behaviors: a Review."", 'Describing a nurse case manager intervention to empower low-income men with prostate cancer.', ""Men's perspectives of prostate cancer screening: A systematic review of qualitative studies.""]"""

Methods:   The pharmacokinetics of free PAESe and PAESe encapsulated in liposomes (SSL-PAESe) were determined in rats using liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. The antitumor and cardioprotective effects were determined in a mouse xenograft model of human prostate (PC-3) cancer and cardiomyocytes (H9C2).  Results:   The encapsulation of PAESe in liposomes increased the circulation half-life and area under the drug concentration time profile, and decreased total systemic clearance significantly compared to free PAESe. Free- and SSL-PAESe improved survival, decreased weight-loss and prevented cardiac hypertrophy significantly in tumor bearing and healthy mice following treatment with DOX at 5 and 12.5 mg/kg. In vitro studies revealed PAESe treatment altered formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cardiac hypertrophy and gene expression, i.e., atrial natriuretic peptide and myosin heavy chain complex beta, in H9C2 cells.

Material and methods:   Sixty four men underwent RP for cT3 PC in our hospital from 1995 to 2011. Clinical stage was diagnosed with MRI and rectal digital examination in all cases. We investigated the postoperative outcome, cancer specific survival and overall survival of all patients. We also investigated the risk factors of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in the patients without any adjuvant therapy. All survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots. We performed univariate analysis by Mann-Whitney test, Fisher exact test and Log-Rank test, and multivariate analysis by Cox regression analysis.  Results:   Median age at RP was 67 years (range: 48-74), and median initial PSA was 14.1 ng/ml (2.2-76.2). Sixty cases (93.8%) were classified into cT3a, and 4 cases (6.3%) into cT3b. Median follow-up period after RP was 62 months (3-172). Fifty three (83%) patients received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Median duration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy was 7 months (3-31). Adjuvant therapy underwent in 20 cases. Of the 64 patients, overall survival and cancer specific survival rates at 10 years were 98% and 100%, respectively. Of the 44 patients who didn't receive any adjuvant therapy, BCR free survival rates at 5 and 10 years was 59% and 51%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that both PSA > or = 15 ng/ml and GS > or = 8 were associated with a significant risk of BCR. Any significant risk factor was not identified by multivariate analysis. In 16 patients who have cT3a, PSA < 15 ng/ml and GS < 8, BCR free survival rate at 5 years was 78%. On the other hand, that of the other patients was 37% (p = 0.009).

The purpose of this study was to examine possible moderator effects of gender on associations between cancer discussions and adjustment among survivors of breast or prostate cancer. Eighty-eight breast and 88 prostate cancer patients were matched by years post-surgery and stage of cancer and completed measures of cancer discussion frequency, quality of life, and depression. Breast and prostate cancer patients differed on what cancer-related threats were discussed most frequently. In addition, among breast, but not prostate cancer patients, frequent cancer discussion was associated with higher depression and lower quality of life. Frequent discussion of cancer may be an indication of poorer adjustment among breast cancer patients at nearly four years post-surgery. The nature and context of cancer discussions may be important determinants of whether cancer discussions relate to adaptive versus maladaptive outcomes.""","""['Philip M Ullrich', 'Nan E Rothrock', 'Susan K Lutgendorf', 'Peter R Jochimsen', 'Richard D Williams']""","""[]""","""2008""","""None""","""Psychol Health""","""['Quality of life of couples dealing with cancer: dyadic and individual adjustment among breast and prostate cancer survivors and their spousal caregivers.', ""Cancer survivors' and partners' key concerns and quality of life."", 'Personality and psychological distress among older adult, long-term cancer survivors.', 'Exploring the relationship between coping, social support and health-related quality of life for prostate cancer survivors: a review of the literature.', 'Quality of life, fertility concerns, and behavioral health outcomes in younger breast cancer survivors: a systematic review.']"""
