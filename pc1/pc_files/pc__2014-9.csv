Formalin-fixed tissues from normal mouse kidney, human pancreatic and prostate cancers, and a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue microarray were processed by antigen retrieval followed by on-tissue digestion with peptide N-glycosidase F. The released N-glycans were detected by MALDI-IMS analysis, and the structural composition of a subset of glycans could be verified directly by on-tissue collision-induced fragmentation. Other structural assignments were confirmed by off-tissue permethylation analysis combined with multiple database comparisons. Imaging of mouse kidney tissue sections demonstrates specific tissue distributions of major cellular N-linked glycoforms in the cortex and medulla. Differential tissue distribution of N-linked glycoforms was also observed in the other tissue types. The efficacy of using MALDI-IMS glycan profiling to distinguish tumor from non-tumor tissues in a tumor microarray format is also demonstrated.

We hypothesized that detection of androgen-receptor splice variant 7 messenger RNA (AR-V7) in circulating tumor cells from men with advanced prostate cancer would be associated with resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone.  Methods:   We used a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay to evaluate AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells from prospectively enrolled patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were initiating treatment with either enzalutamide or abiraterone. We examined associations between AR-V7 status (positive vs. negative) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates (the primary end point), freedom from PSA progression (PSA progression-free survival), clinical or radiographic progression-free survival, and overall survival.  Results:   A total of 31 enzalutamide-treated patients and 31 abiraterone-treated patients were enrolled, of whom 39% and 19%, respectively, had detectable AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells. Among men receiving enzalutamide, AR-V7-positive patients had lower PSA response rates than AR-V7-negative patients (0% vs. 53%, P=0.004) and shorter PSA progression-free survival (median, 1.4 months vs. 6.0 months; P<0.001), clinical or radiographic progression-free survival (median, 2.1 months vs. 6.1 months; P<0.001), and overall survival (median, 5.5 months vs. not reached; P=0.002). Similarly, among men receiving abiraterone, AR-V7-positive patients had lower PSA response rates than AR-V7-negative patients (0% vs. 68%, P=0.004) and shorter PSA progression-free survival (median, 1.3 months vs. not reached; P<0.001), clinical or radiographic progression-free survival (median, 2.3 months vs. not reached; P<0.001), and overall survival (median, 10.6 months vs. not reached, P=0.006). The association between AR-V7 detection and therapeutic resistance was maintained after adjustment for expression of full-length androgen receptor messenger RNA.  Conclusions:   Detection of AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer may be associated with resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone.

While the aglycon (deglycobleomycin) mediates DNA cleavage in much the same fashion as bleomycin, it exhibits diminished cytotoxicity in comparison to BLM. These findings suggested that BLM might be modular in nature, composed of tumor-seeking and tumoricidal domains. To explore this possibility, BLM analogues were prepared in which the disaccharide moiety was attached to deglycobleomycin at novel positions, namely, via the threonine moiety or C-terminal substituent. The analogues were compared with BLM and deglycoBLM for DNA cleavage, cancer cell uptake, and cytotoxic activity. BLM is more potent than deglycoBLM in supercoiled plasmid DNA relaxation, while the analogue having the disaccharide on threonine was less active than deglycoBLM and the analogue containing the C-terminal disaccharide was slightly more potent. While having unexceptional DNA cleavage potencies, both glycosylated analogues were more cytotoxic to cultured DU145 prostate cancer cells than deglycoBLM. Dye-labeled conjugates of the cytotoxic BLM aglycons were used in imaging experiments to determine the extent of cell uptake. The rank order of internalization efficiencies was the same as their order of cytotoxicities toward DU145 cells. These findings establish a role for the BLM disaccharide in tumor targeting/uptake and suggest that the disaccharide moiety may be capable of delivering other cytotoxins to cancer cells. While the mechanism responsible for uptake of the BLM disaccharide selectively by tumor cells has not yet been established, data are presented which suggest that the metabolic shift to glycolysis in cancer cells may provide the vehicle for selective internalization.""","""['Benjamin R Schroeder', 'M Imran Ghare', 'Chandrabali Bhattacharya', 'Rakesh Paul', 'Zhiqiang Yu', 'Paul A Zaleski', 'Trevor C Bozeman', 'Michael J Rishel', 'Sidney M Hecht']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Am Chem Soc""","""['Selective tumor cell targeting by the disaccharide moiety of bleomycin.', 'Structural features facilitating tumor cell targeting and internalization by bleomycin and its disaccharide.', 'A gulose moiety contributes to the belomycin (BLM) disaccharide selective targeting to lung cancer cells.', 'Derivative of bleomycin generates less of ROS?

Little is known, however, about the use of occupational therapy services by adults with cancer. The objective of this study was to understand what shapes patterns of occupational therapy use to help improve service delivery. We examined older (age >65 yr) adults diagnosed with breast, prostate, lung, or melanoma (skin) cancer between 2004 and 2007 (N = 27,131) using North Carolina Central Cancer Registry data linked to Medicare billing claims.

Most of the studies evaluated intraprostatic hormone metabolism using cell lines or preprocessed specimens. Using an ex vivo model of intact tissue cultures with preserved architecture, we characterized the enzymatic profile of biopsies from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or cancer (PC), focusing on 17β-hydroxy-steroid-dehydrogenases (17β-HSDs) and aromatase activities. Samples from 26 men who underwent prostate needle core biopsies (BPH n = 14; PC n = 12) were incubated with radiolabeled (3)H-testosterone or (3)H-androstenedione. Conversion was evaluated by TLC separation and beta-scanning of extracted supernatants. We identified three major patterns of conversion. The majority of BPHs revealed no active testosterone/oestradiol conversion as opposed to prostate cancer. Conversion correlated with histology and PSA, but not circulating hormones. Highest Gleason scores had a higher androstenedion-to-testosterone conversion and expression of 17β-HSD-isoenzymes-3/5. Conclusions. We developed an easy tool to profile individual intraprostatic enzymatic activity by characterizing conversion pathways in an intact tissue environment. In fresh biopsies we found that 17β-HSD-isoenzymes and aromatase activities correlate with biological behaviour allowing for morphofunctional phenotyping of pathology specimens and clinical monitoring of novel enzyme-targeting drugs.""","""['Daniele Gianfrilli', 'Silvia Pierotti', 'Riccardo Pofi', 'Costantino Leonardo', 'Mauro Ciccariello', 'Federica Barbagallo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['5alpha-reductase isozymes and aromatase are differentially expressed and active in the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3.', 'Expression of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and other estrogen-metabolizing enzymes in different cancer cell lines.', '5alpha-reductase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expression in epithelial cells from hyperplastic and malignant human prostate.', 'Sex steroid hormone metabolism and prostate cancer.', '17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSDs) as therapeutic targets: protein structures, functions, and recent progress in inhibitor development.', 'The CYP19A1 (TTTA)n Repeat Polymorphism May Affect the Prostate Cancer Risk: Evidence from a Meta-Analysis.', 'Therapeutic use of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy reduces prostate volume and lower urinary tract symptoms in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Estrogen and androgen-converting enzymes 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and their involvement in cancer: with a special focus on 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, 2, and breast cancer.', 'Androgenetic alopecia: a review.']"""

Objective:   To describe participants' evaluation and utilization of print-based and web-based prostate cancer screening decision aids that were found to improve decisional outcomes in a prior randomized controlled trial.  Design:   Men completed brief telephone interviews at baseline, one month, and 13 months post-randomization.  Participants:   Participants were primary care patients, 45-70 years old, who received the print-based (N = 628) or web-based decision aid (N = 625) and completed the follow-up assessments.  Main measures:   We assessed men's baseline preference for web-based or print-based materials, time spent using the decision aids, comprehension of the overall message, and ratings of the content.  Key results:   Decision aid use was self-reported by 64.3 % (web) and 81.8 % (print) of participants. Significant predictors of decision aid use were race (white vs. non-white, OR = 2.43, 95 % CI: 1.77, 3.35), higher education (OR = 1.68, 95 % CI: 1.06, 2.70) and trial arm (print vs. web, OR = 2.78, 95 % CI: 2.03, 3.83). Multivariable analyses indicated that web-arm participants were more likely to use the website when they preferred web-based materials (OR: 1.91, CI: 1.17, 3.12), whereas use of the print materials was not significantly impacted by a preference for print-based materials (OR: 0.69, CI: 0.38, 1.25). Comprehension of the decision aid message (i.e., screening is an individual decision) did not significantly differ between arms in adjusted analyses (print: 61.9 % and web: 68.2 %, p = 0.42).  Conclusions:   Decision aid use was independently influenced by race, education, and the decision aid medium, findings consistent with the 'digital divide.' These results suggest that when it is not possible to provide this age cohort with their preferred decision aid medium, print materials will be more highly used than web-based materials.

We abstracted data for 7202 open, 2483 laparoscopic, 1181 minimal incision endoscopic, and 2126 robot-assisted radical prostatectomies for oncological stage T3 or less from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database (April 2012-March 2013). Complication rate, transfusion rate, anesthesia time, postoperative length of stay, and cost were evaluated by pairwise one-to-one propensity-score matching and multivariable analyses with covariants of age, comorbidity, oncological stage, hospital volume, and hospital academic status. The proportion of robot-assisted radical prostatectomies dramatically increased from 8.6% to 24.1% during the first year. Compared with open, laparoscopic, and minimal incision endoscopic surgery, robot-assisted surgery was generally associated with a significantly lower complication rate (odds ratios, 0.25, 0.20, 0.33, respectively), autologous transfusion rate (0.04, 0.31, 0.10), homologous transfusion rate (0.16, 0.48, 0.14), lower cost excluding operation (differences, -5.1%, -1.8% [not significant], -10.8%) and shorter postoperative length of stay (-9.1%, +0.9% [not significant], -18.5%, respectively). However, robot-assisted surgery also resulted in a + 42.6% increase in anesthesia time and +52.4% increase in total cost compared with open surgery (all P < 0.05).

However, prevention of bone decay by weekly administration of zoledronic acid (ZOL) at the time of castration prevented ADT-induced tumor growth in bone. Recently, two publications from Japan have demonstrated that ZOL combined with ADT improved outcomes for patients with treatment-naïve CaP with bone metastasis. The mechanistic cause for these patients having an improved overall survival compared with those who were treated with ZOL after ADT initiation or before metastasis development was never explained. Ottewell and colleague's study now suggests that it is the bone loss caused by ADT that promoted bone metastasis, and if ZOL is administered at the time of ADT initiation, it would prevent this bone loss and prolong skeletal-related event-free survival.""","""['Paramita M Ghosh', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Castration-induced bone loss triggers growth of disseminated prostate cancer cells in bone.', 'Castration-induced bone loss triggers growth of disseminated prostate cancer cells in bone.', 'Efficacy of zoledronic acid for the elimination of disseminated tumor cells in a clinically relevant, spontaneously metastatic prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Prostate-specific antigen kinetics and outcomes in patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with or without zoledronic acid.', 'Rationale for zoledronic acid therapy in men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with or without bone metastasis.', 'Clinical efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in prostate and breast cancer.']"""

A deep understanding of its underlying molecular mechanisms is the premise for developing effective targeted therapies. Recently, deep transcriptional sequencing has been used as an effective genomic assay to obtain insights into diseases and may be helpful in the study of PC.  Methods:   In present study, ChIP-Seq data for PC and normal samples were compared, and differential peaks identified, based upon fold changes (with P-values calculated with t-tests). Annotations of these peaks were performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was performed with BioGRID and constructed with Cytoscape, following which the highly connected genes were screened.  Results:   We obtained a total of 5,570 differential peaks, including 3,726 differentially enriched peaks in tumor samples and 1,844 differentially enriched peaks in normal samples. There were eight significant regions of the peaks. The intergenic region possessed the highest score (51%), followed by intronic (31%) and exonic (11%) regions.

This study aims to describe the recommendations of radiation oncologists in the most controversial aspects of treating such patients.  Materials and methods:   The project involved 61 oncologists and comprised 4 phases: (1) selection of the most controversial aspects in the administration of ADT in patients with a history of CV disease and PCa, (2) selection of the most relevant published evidence, (3) preparation of case reports, (4) critical reading and discussion. Therapeutic procedures were classified as ""highly recommendable"", ""recommendable in some cases"", or ""not recommendable/not applicable"". For each item assessed, the mode of the scores given, and the percentage of experts who selected each score were calculated.  Results:   The panel recommended that patients with high/very high-risk PCa and a history of CV disease should receive gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa). ADT with GnRHa for 24-36 months + radiotherapy (RT) was also considered highly recommendable. In intermediate-risk PCa and a history of CV, ADT with GnRHa for 6-8 months + RT, and not administering ADT were considered highly recommendable.

Paxillin mediates these processes through a conserved pathway that involves both extranuclear (nongenomic) and nuclear (genomic) steroid signaling, as well as both cytoplasmic and nuclear kinase signaling. In fact, paxillin appears to serve as a critical liaison between extranuclear and nuclear signaling in response to multiple stimuli, making it a fascinating molecule to study when trying to determine how growth signals from the membrane lead to important proliferative changes in the nucleus.

Methods:   Enrolled in this retrospective study were 150 patients (95 from Bologna, 55 from Würzburg) with rPCa and biochemical relapse (PSA mean ± SD 4.3 ± 5.5 ng/mL, range 0.2-39.4 ng/mL) after radical therapy. The intended treatment before PET/CT was salvage radiotherapy of the prostatic bed in 95 patients and palliative androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in 55 patients. The effective clinical impact of (11)C-choline PET/CT was rated as major (change in therapeutic approach), minor (same treatment, but modified therapeutic strategy) or none. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis included PSA level, PSA kinetics, ongoing ADT, Gleason score, TNM, age and time to relapse.  Results:   Changes in therapy after (11)C-choline PET/CT were implemented in 70 of the 150 patients (46.7%). A major clinical impact was observed in 27 patients (18%) and a minor clinical impact in 43 (28.7%). (11)C-choline PET/CT was positive in 109 patients (72.7%) detecting local relapse (prostate bed and/or iliac lymph nodes and/or pararectal lymph nodes) in 64 patients (42.7%). Distant relapse (paraaortic and/or retroperitoneal lymph nodes and/or bone lesions) was seen in 31 patients (20.7%), and both local and distant relapse in 14 (9.3%). A significant difference was observed in PSA level and PSA kinetics between PET-positive and PET-negative patients (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, PSA level, PSA doubling time and ongoing ADT were significant predictors of a positive scan (p < 0.05). In statistical analysis no significant differences were observed between the Bologna and Würzburg patients (p > 0.05). In both centres the same criteria to validate PET-positive findings were used: in 17.3% of patients by histology and in 82.7% of patients by correlative imaging and/or clinical follow-up (follow-up mean 20.5 months, median 18.3 months, range 6.2-60 months).

The simulations involved the use of the BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc Monte Carlo codes to predict the response of the iViewGT a-Si EPID model. The predicted EPID images were compared to the measured images obtained from the experiment. The measured EPID images were obtained by delivering a photon beam from an Elekta Synergy linac to the Elekta iViewGT a-Si EPID. The a-Si EPID was used with no additional build-up material. Frame averaged EPID images were acquired and processed using in-house software. The agreement between the predicted and measured images was analyzed using the gamma analysis technique with acceptance criteria of 3 %/3 mm. The results show that the predicted EPID images for four clinical IMRT treatment plans have a good agreement with the measured EPID signal. Three prostate IMRT plans were found to have an average gamma pass rate of more than 95.0 % and a spinal IMRT plan has the average gamma pass rate of 94.3 %. During the period of performing this work a routine MLC calibration was performed and one of the IMRT treatments re-measured with the EPID. A change in the gamma pass rate for one field was observed. This was the motivation for a series of experiments to investigate the sensitivity of the method by introducing delivery errors, MLC position and dosimetric overshoot, into the simulated EPID images. The method was found to be sensitive to 1 mm leaf position errors and 10 % overshoot errors.""","""['Sri Herwiningsih', 'Peta Hanlon', 'Andrew Fielding']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Australas Phys Eng Sci Med""","""['Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'Experimental investigation of the response of an a-Si EPID to an unflattened photon beam from an Elekta Precise linear accelerator.', 'Measurement-based Monte Carlo dose calculation system for IMRT pretreatment and on-line transit dose verifications.', 'Pixel response-based EPID dosimetry for patient specific QA.', 'Dosimetric verification of IMRT and 3D conformal treatment delivery using EPID.', 'Clinical Efficacy of an Electronic Portal Imaging Device versus a Physical Phantom Tool for Patient-Specific Quality Assurance.', 'Investigating the effectiveness of monitoring relevant variations during IMRT and VMAT treatments by EPID-based 3D in vivo verification performed using planning CTs.', 'The effect of respiratory motion on electronic portal imaging device dosimetry.']"""

Methods:   A prostate cancer tissue microarray (n = 400) was stained for DKK-1 and DKK-1 serum levels were measured in 80 patients with prostate cancer. The independent prognostic value of DKK-1 expression was assessed using multivariate analyses.  Results:   DKK-1 tissue expression was significantly increased in prostate cancer compared to benign disease, but was not correlated with survival. However, high DKK-1 serum levels at the time of the diagnosis were associated with a significantly shorter overall and disease-specific survival. Multivariate analyses defined high serum levels of DKK-1 as an independent prognostic marker in prostate cancer (HR 3.73; 95%CI 1.44-9.66, p = 0.007).

Here we demonstrated that tetrandrine selectively inhibits the growth of prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells compared to normal prostate epithelial PWR-1E cells. Tetrandrine-induced cell death in prostate cancer cells is caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1/2). JNK1/2-mediated proteasomal degradation of c-FLIPL/S and Bcl2 proteins are key events in the sensitization of prostate cancer cells to Fas- and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by tetrandrine. Tetrandrine-induced JNK1/2 activation caused the translocation of Bax to mitochondria by disrupting its association with Bcl2 which was accompanied by collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cytosolic release of cytochrome c and Smac, and apoptotic cell death. Additionally, tetrandrine-induced JNK1/2 activation increased the phosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70 and facilitated its degradation via the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway. In parallel, tetrandrine-mediated ROS generation also caused the induction of ligand-independent Fas-mediated apoptosis by activating procaspase-8 and Bid cleavage. Inhibition of procaspase-8 activation attenuated the cleavage of Bid, loss of MMP and caspase-3 activation suggest that tetrandrine-induced Fas-mediated apoptosis is associated with the mitochondrial pathway. Furthermore, most of the signaling effects of tetrandrine on apoptosis were significantly attenuated in the presence of antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine, thereby confirming the involvement of ROS in these events. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that tetrandrine-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is initiated by ROS generation and that both intrinsic and extrinsic pathway contributes to cell death.""","""['Pankaj Chaudhary', 'Jamboor K Vishwanatha']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Induction of apoptosis in human hepatoblastoma cells by tetrandrine via caspase-dependent Bid cleavage and cytochrome c release.', 'Tetrandrine-induced apoptosis is mediated by activation of caspases and PKC-delta in U937 cells.', 'p38alpha, but not p38beta, inhibits the phosphorylation and presence of c-FLIPS in DISC to potentiate Fas-mediated caspase-8 activation and type I apoptotic signaling.', 'Autophagy and cancer: Can tetrandrine be a potent anticancer drug in the near future?', 'Apoptosis-Induced Compensatory Proliferation in Cancer.', 'Analysis of the potential biological mechanisms of diosmin against renal fibrosis based on network pharmacology and molecular docking approach.', 'Exploring the recent trends in perturbing the cellular signaling pathways in cancer by natural products.', 'Progress on structural modification of Tetrandrine with wide range of pharmacological activities.', 'Targeting the two-pore channel 2 in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'ERK and p38 MAPK inhibition controls NF-E2 degradation and profibrotic signaling in renal proximal tubule cells.']"""

Expression of the AR-red fluorescent protein (RFP) ""prey"" and TIF2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) ""bait"" components of the biosensor was directed by recombinant adenovirus constructs that expressed the ligand binding and activation function 2 surface domains of AR fused to RFP with nuclear localization and nuclear export sequences, and three α-helical LXXLL motifs from TIF2 fused to GFP and an HIV Rev nucleolar targeting sequence. In unstimulated cells, AR-RFP was localized predominantly to the cytoplasm and TIF2-GFP was localized to nucleoli. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment induced AR-RFP translocation into the nucleus where the PPIs between AR and TIF2 resulted in the colocalization of both biosensors within the nucleolus. We adapted the translocation enhanced image analysis module to quantify the colocalization of the AR-RFP and TIF2-GFP biosensors in images acquired on the ImageXpress platform. DHT induced a concentration-dependent AR-TIF2 colocalization and produced a characteristic condensed punctate AR-RFP PPI nucleolar distribution pattern. The heat-shock protein 90 inhibitor 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and antiandrogens flutamide and bicalutamide inhibited DHT-induced AR-TIF2 PPI formation with 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50s) of 88.5±12.5 nM, 7.6±2.4 μM, and 1.6±0.4 μM, respectively. Images of the AR-RFP distribution phenotype allowed us to distinguish between 17-AAG and flutamide, which prevented AR translocation, and bicalutamide, which blocked AR-TIF2 PPIs. We screened the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) set for compounds that inhibited AR-TIF2 PPI formation or disrupted preexisting complexes. Eleven modulators of steroid family nuclear receptors (NRs) and 6 non-NR ligands inhibited AR-TIF2 PPI formation, and 10 disrupted preexisting complexes. The hits appear to be either AR antagonists or nonspecific inhibitors of NR activation and trafficking. Given that the LOPAC set represents such a small and restricted biological and chemical diversity, it is anticipated that screening a much larger and more diverse compound library will be required to find AR-TIF2 PPI inhibitors/disruptors. The AR-TIF2 protein-protein interaction biosensor (PPIB) approach offers significant promise for identifying molecules with potential to modulate AR transcriptional activity in a cell-specific manner that is distinct from the existing antiandrogen drugs that target AR binding or production. Small molecules that disrupt AR signaling at the level of AR-TIF2 PPIs may also overcome the development of resistance and progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Yun Hua', 'Tong Ying Shun', 'Christopher J Strock', 'Paul A Johnston']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Assay Drug Dev Technol""","""['High-Content Screening Campaign to Identify Compounds That Inhibit or Disrupt Androgen Receptor-Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 2 Protein-Protein Interactions for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'High Content Positional Biosensor Assay to Screen for Compounds that Prevent or Disrupt Androgen Receptor and Transcription Intermediary Factor 2 Protein-Protein Interactions.', 'Reconfiguring the AR-TIF2 Protein-Protein Interaction HCS Assay in Prostate Cancer Cells and Characterizing the Hits from a LOPAC Screen.', 'Androgen receptor modulators: a review of recent patents and reports (2012-2018).', 'Cheminformatics Driven Development of Novel Therapies for Drug Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'High-throughput AR dimerization assay identifies androgen disrupting chemicals and metabolites.', 'Selecting a minimal set of androgen receptor assays for screening chemicals.', 'Chemical Screening of Nuclear Receptor Modulators.', 'Assays to Interrogate the Ability of Compounds to Inhibit the AF-2 or AF-1 Transactivation Domains of the Androgen Receptor.', 'High-Content Screening Campaign to Identify Compounds That Inhibit or Disrupt Androgen Receptor-Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 2 Protein-Protein Interactions for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 58 patients who underwent pelvic and/or retroperitoneal salvage lymph node dissection from June 2005 to February 2012. Biochemical response was defined as prostate specific antigen less than 0.2 ng/ml 40 days after salvage treatment. Biochemical recurrence in those with a biochemical response was defined as prostate specific antigen greater than 0.2 ng/ml and increasing. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess time to biochemical recurrence, clinical recurrence and cancer specific survival. Cox and binary logistic regressions were used to determine factors influencing clinical recurrence and biochemical response.  Results:   Median followup after salvage lymph node dissection was 39 months. A total of 13 patients (22.4%) achieved a biochemical response. Only 1 patient remained free of biochemical recurrence during followup. Clinical recurrence developed in 25 patients (48.1%) after salvage treatment. Six patients (10.3%) died of disease, including 4 with indeterminate extralymphatic findings on positron emission tomography/computerized tomography before salvage therapy. The 5-year cancer specific survival rate was 71.1%. Patients with a complete biochemical response showed a trend toward a longer time to clinical recurrence (p = 0.20). Biochemical response did not influence cancer specific survival.  Conclusions:   Salvage lymph node dissection in patients with biochemical recurrence and positive lymph nodes on positron emission tomography/computerized tomography led to a biochemical response in a certain proportion. Most patients progressed to biochemical recurrence after salvage treatment but almost half showed no further clinical recurrence. Cancer specific mortality occurred predominantly in patients with prior suspicion of extralymphatic lesions.

However, DCE images remain difficult to analyze and interpret. Although pharmacokinetic approaches, which involve multi-step processes, can provide a general framework for the interpretation of these data, they are still too complex for robust and accurate implementation. Therefore, statistical data analysis techniques were recently suggested as another valid interpretation strategy for DCE-MRI. In this context, we propose a spectral clustering approach for the analysis of DCE-MRI time-intensity signals. This graph theory-based method allows for the grouping of signals after spatial transformation. Subsequently, these data clusters can be labeled following comparison to arterial signals.

A Canadian Urology Research Consortium Study""","""Background:   Bicalutamide is a widely used, relatively non-toxic anti-androgen, particularly when used in combination with androgen deprivation. In men on combined androgen blockade (CAB), the typical dose is 50 mg per day. For men receiving monotherapy with bicalutamide anti-androgen, the dose is 150 mg per day. The objective was to determine the PSA response rate to increasing bicalutamide to 150 mg per day in men who develop castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) on CAB with goserelin acetate and bicalutamide 50 mg per day.  Methods:   A national, multicentre, phase 2, open-label study in men on CAB with a rising PSA>2.0. The primary end point of the trial was PSA response at 12 months, defined as a decline by 50% or more compared with baseline value. Partial response was defined as a PSA decline of 10-49%. Secondary end points were duration of PSA response, change in slope of serum PSA, change in ratio of free PSA: total PSA at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months as compared with baseline; duration of the bicalutamide withdrawal response after discontinuation; the rate of cardiovascular events; and toxicity. The study was initially planned to accrue 100 patients, but was closed early due to diminishing accrual.  Results:   Sixty-four patients were accrued; 61 patients received trial treatment and constituted the intention-to-treat (ITT) cohort. 70% were M0. Among 59 evaluable ITT patients, 13 (22%) patients had a >50% PSA decline, 5 (8%) had a decline between 10 and 50%, 4 (7%) had stabilization and 37 (63%) had PSA progression. The median duration was 3.7 months (95% confidence interval of 0.92-6.21 months).  Conclusion:   In patients with early biochemical failure on CAB with bicalutamide 50 mg, an increase in dose to 150 mg of bicalutamide resulted in a PSA response of ⩾ 50% in 22% of patients. Toxicity was mild. Bicalutamide dose intensification may benefit a subset of patients with CRPC. We believe this relatively inexpensive approach warrants further evaluation.""","""['L Klotz', 'D Drachenberg', 'R Singal', 'A Aprikian', 'Y Fradet', 'M Kebabdjian', 'M Zarenda', 'J Chin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prostate cancer: Bicalutamide dose increase in castration-resistant disease.', 'Prostate-specific antigen response to deferred combined androgen blockade therapy using bicalutamide predicts survival after subsequent oestrogen and docetaxel therapies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dutasteride and bicalutamide in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer: the Therapy Assessed by Rising PSA (TARP) study rationale and design.', 'High-dose radiotherapy with short-term or long-term androgen deprivation in localised prostate cancer (DART01/05 GICOR): a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.', 'Maximal androgen blockade for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Third-line hormonal therapy to treat prostate cancer relapse after initial and second-line hormonal therapy: report of 52 cases and literature review.', 'Abiraterone acetate versus bicalutamide in combination with gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist therapy for high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Consensus on the Treatment and Follow-Up for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Report From the First Global Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference for Developing Countries (PCCCDC).', 'Bicalutamide Elicits Renal Damage by Causing Mitochondrial Dysfunction via ROS Damage and Upregulation of HIF-1.', 'Treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: focus on apalutamide.', 'Switching from a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist to a GnRH antagonist in prostate cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Methods:   We assessed the toxicity profile and functional outcomes of consecutive patients undergoing focal IRE for localised prostate cancer in two centres. Eligibility was assessed by multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and targeted and/or template biopsy. IRE was delivered under transrectal ultrasound guidance with two to six electrodes positioned transperineally within the cancer lesion. Complications were recorded and scored accordingly to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; the functional outcome was physician reported in all patients with at least 6 months follow-up. A contrast-enhanced MRI 1 week after the procedure was carried out to assess treatment effect with a further mpMRI at 6 months to rule out evidence of residual visible cancer.  Results:   Overall, 34 patients with a mean age of 65 years (s.d. = ± 6) and a median PSA of 6.1 ng ml(-1) (interquartile range (IQR) = 4.3-7.7) were included. Nine (26%), 24 (71%) and 1 (3%) men had low, intermediate and high risk disease, respectively (D'Amico criteria). After a median follow-up of 6 months (range 1-24), 12 grade 1 and 10 grade 2 complications occurred. No patient had grade >/= 3 complication. From a functional point of view, 100% (24/24) patients were continent and potency was preserved in 95% (19/20) men potent before treatment. The volume of ablation was a median 12 ml (IQR = 5.6-14.5 ml) with the median PSA after 6 months of 3.4 ng ml(-1) (IQR = 1.9-4.8 ng ml(-1)). MpMRI showed suspicious residual disease in six patients, of whom four (17%) underwent another form of local treatment.

Because the design's performance is very sensitive to prior hyperparameters and the shape of the target trade-off contour, specifying these two design elements properly is essential.  Purpose:   The goals are to provide a method that uses elicited mean outcome probabilities to derive a prior that is neither overly informative nor overly disperse, and practical guidelines for specifying the target trade-off contour.  Methods:   A general algorithm is presented that determines prior hyperparameters using least squares penalized by effective sample size. Guidelines for specifying the trade-off contour are provided. These methods are illustrated by a clinical trial in advanced prostate cancer. A new version of the efficacy-toxicity program is provided for implementation.  Results:   Together, the algorithm and guidelines provide substantive improvements in the design's operating characteristics.  Limitations:   The method requires a substantial number of elicited values and design parameters, and computer simulations are required to obtain an acceptable design.  Conclusion:   The two key improvements greatly enhance the efficacy-toxicity design's practical usefulness and are straightforward to implement using the updated computer program.

However, knowledge about their functional significance in prostate cancer (PCa) progression is still sparse. Since chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) is significantly up-regulated in patients with PCa, aim of the current study was to assess whether CCL2 contributes to invasive behavior of prostate cancer cells in vitro.  Methods:   The human PCa cell line PC3 was stimulated with CCL2. Cell growth was investigated by MTT dye reduction assay. Cell adhesion was analyzed by measuring attachment to a human endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayer and immobilized collagen. Cell migration was assessed by a chemotactic assay. Integrin expression on the cell surface was evaluated by Western blot. Blocking studies were performed with anti-integrin α3, anti-integrin α6 and anti-integrin β4 monoclonal antibodies.  Results:   PC3 cell growth 72 h after CCL2 exposure was significantly increased, compared to controls. Activation of tumor cells by CCL2 significantly enhanced tumor cell adhesion to HUVEC and immobilized collagen. CCL2, added for 4 or 24 h, elevated α6 and β4 (4 > 24 h) integrin expression. α3 was enhanced after 4 h, but reduced after 24 h. Blocking either α3, α6 or β4 led to significant suppression of tumor cell binding to immobilized collagen.  Conclusions:   CCL2 stimulates PCa cell adhesion and induces alterations in α3-, α6- and β4-integrin expression on the cell surface. Blocking these integrins leads to a significant reduction in cell adhesion.""","""['Igor Tsaur', 'Jochen Rutz', 'Jasmina Makarević', 'Eva Juengel', 'Kilian M Gust', 'Hendrik Borgmann', 'David Schilling', 'Karen Nelson', 'Axel Haferkamp', 'Georg Bartsch', 'Roman A Blaheta']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Amygdalin Modulates Prostate Cancer Cell Adhesion and Migration In Vitro.', 'Role of integrin receptors for fibronectin, collagen and laminin in the regulation of ovarian carcinoma functions in response to a matrix microenvironment.', 'The laminin binding α3 and α6 integrins cooperate to promote epithelial cell adhesion and growth.', 'Multiple roles of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 in promoting prostate cancer growth.', 'Integrin clipping: a novel adhesion switch?', 'The Exploration of Chemokines Importance in the Pathogenesis and Development of Endometrial Cancer.', 'Plasma Chemokine C-C Motif Ligand 2 as a Potential Biomarker for Prostate Cancer.', 'CCL2 secreted from cancer-associated mesothelial cells promotes peritoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer cells through the P38-MAPK pathway.', 'Effect of chemokine CC ligand 2 (CCL2) on α‑synuclein‑induced microglia proliferation and neuronal apoptosis.', 'Function of phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 ser536 in prostate cancer oncogenesis.']"""

Methods:   In a case-control study nested within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial cohort, we measured serum estrone, estradiol, and 13 estrogen metabolites, in the 2-, 4-, or 16-hydroxylation pathways, using an LC/MS-MS assay. Cases (n = 195) were non-Hispanic white men ages 55 to 70 years when diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer (stage III or IV and/or Gleason ≥7). Controls (n = 195) were non-Hispanic white men without prostate cancer who were frequency matched to cases by age and year at blood draw, and time since baseline screen. Only men with serum testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin measured previously were eligible. Logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).  Results:   Risk of aggressive prostate cancer was strongly inversely associated with estradiol:testosterone ratio (OR4th quartile vs. 1st = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.12-0.59, Ptrend = 0.003) and positively associated with 2:16α-hydroxyestrone ratio (OR4th quartile vs. 1st = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.34-4.45, Ptrend = 0.001). Individual estrogen metabolites were unrelated to risk.

Benign prostate hyperplasia is a common disease for the elderly men and it induces lower urinary tract symptoms which hinder general activity and quality of life. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of Schisandra chinensis extract (SCE) in benign prostate hyperplasia using human prostate tissue.  Materials and methods:   Schisandra chinensis fruit was collected and extracted with ethanol. Human prostate tissues were obtained from 14 prostate cancer patients. Macroscopically normal tissue was excised from the transition zone and the periurethral regions. Isolated prostate tissue strips were mounted in an organ-bath system, and the relaxation effect of SCE was evaluated by cumulative addition to prostate strips pre-contracted with 10(-5)M norepinephrine. The effect of tamsulosin was compared, and the additive effect was evaluated. Electrophysiological studies using cultured human prostate smooth muscle cells (HPrSMC) were conducted.  Results:   Cumulative dosing of SCE induced concentration-dependent relaxation in contracted prostate tissue (n=18, P<0.05). Simultaneous dosing of SCE and tamsulosin showed an additive relaxation effect. The relaxation effect of SCE was abolished by inhibition of K+ channels by pre-treatment with tetraethylammonium. In HPrSMC, extracellular application of 100 μg/mL SCE significantly increased outward currents, and this effect was significantly attenuated by treatment with 100 nM Iberiotoxin.

The expression of cancer-testis (CT) antigens in some tumours and restricted expression among normal tissues make CT antigens as attractive vaccine targets. In this context, we evaluated Centrosomal protein 55 kDa (CEP55), which is specifically expressed in normal human testis and various malignancies. Until the expression pattern of CEP55 in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of human urinary bladder and its clinical significance are not known. The aim of the present study is to evaluate mRNA/protein expression of CEP55 in TCCs of urinary bladder and correlate its expression with the clinicopathological characteristics of BC patients. In this study, the methods of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to investigate mRNA/protein expression of CEP55 in TCC. Independent Student's t test, ANOVA and Chi-square (χ(2)) were used to analyze the data statistically. We observed CEP55 mRNA overexpression in testis and 48.7% of BC patients. Relative mean fold expression of CEP55 mRNA was found to be significantly (p<0.01) higher in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) as compared to non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients (7.88±3.88 vs. 4.75±2.30, p=0.01). CEP55 protein expression was evaluated using IHC and cytoplasmic staining pattern was recorded in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) bladder tumour tissues. No significant difference was observed in protein expression of CEP55 between the two groups (NMIBC and MIBC patients) (72.2% vs. 69.0%, p=0.774). No significant protein expression of CEP55 was observed among adjacent noncancerous tissues (ANCTs) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) used as control.

However, resistance to AI is sometimes acquired, and the molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance are largely unclear. Recent studies suggest that AI treatment increases androgen activity during estrogen deprivation in breast carcinoma, but the role of the androgen receptor (AR) in breast carcinoma is still a matter of controversy. The purpose of this study is to examine the potential correlation between the AR- and AI-resistant breast carcinoma. To this end, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of 21 pairs of primary breast carcinoma and corresponding AI-resistant recurrent tissue samples and established two stable variant cell lines from ER-positive T-47D breast carcinoma cell line as AI-resistance models and used them in in vitro experiments. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Ki-67 were significantly higher and ER and progesterone receptor (PR) were lower in recurrent lesions compared to the corresponding primary lesions. Variant cell lines overexpressed AR and PSA and exhibited neither growth response to estrogen nor expression of ER. Androgen markedly induced the proliferation of these cell lines. In addition, the expression profile of androgen-induced genes was markedly different between variant and parental cell lines as determined by microarray analysis. These results suggest that in some cases of ER-positive breast carcinoma, tumor cells possibly change from ER-dependent to AR-dependent, rendering them resistant to AI.

Outcome measures were perioperative and functional results, including operating time, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, length of hospital stay (LOS), positive surgical margins (PSMs), and recovery of continence and potency. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effect model. Subgroup analysis was performed for institutions with greater experience of RARP in obese cases.  Results:   Thirteen observational studies from 12 study population were included for 1821 obese patients compared with 4801 nonobese patients. Operating time (p=0.0001; WMD: 24.28; 95% CI, 11.93-36.64) and EBL (p=0.003; WMD: 38.28; 95% CI, 13.45-63.11) were significantly increased in obese patients compared with nonobese counterparts. There was no significant difference in complications, LOS, or PSM rates. Subgroup analysis for studies that have involved ≥100 obese cases showed consistent results, but the increases in operating time (9.8 minutes; 95% CI, 1.7-18 minutes) and EBL (14 mL; 95% CI, 5.0-23 mL) were much lower compared with the original analysis. As for functional outcomes, obese patients showed significantly higher probabilities of incontinence (p=0.003; OR: 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13-1.77) and impotency (p=0.02; OR: 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.61) at 1 year.  Conclusions:   Perioperative outcomes of RARP in obese patients are comparable with those in nonobese patients, except for significant but small increases in operating time and EBL. Surgeons should initiate RARP procedures in obese cases after overcoming the learning curve. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the functional outcomes for obese patients undergoing RARP.""","""['Tianyuan Xu', 'Xianjin Wang', 'Leilei Xia', 'Xiaohua Zhang', 'Liang Qin', 'Shan Zhong', 'Zhoujun Shen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Editorial comment for Xu et al.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Laparoscopic and robot-assisted vs open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'A Critical Analysis of the Learning Curve and Postlearning Curve Outcomes of Two Experience- and Volume-Matched Surgeons for Laparoscopic and Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Effect of Neoadjuvant Hormonal Therapy on the Postoperative Course for Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Association between body mass index and localized prostate cancer management and disease-specific quality of life.', 'Effect of prostate and bony pelvic dimensions measured by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging on robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparative review of the guidelines for anterior urethral stricture.', 'Should obesity be associated with worse urinary continence outcomes after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy? a propensity score matching analysis.']"""

The mitochondrial pathway is regulated by both the genes of the Bcl-2 family and the genes encoding mitochondrial transport molecules. Those proteins allow a release of cyctochrome c through the outer mitochondrial membrane. This release activates the caspase cascade resulting in death of cells. There are at least two main transport systems associated with the family of Bcl-2 proteins that are involved in transport of molecules through the outer mitochondrial membrane, i.e., the voltage dependent anion channels (VDACs) and translocases of the outer mitochondrial membrane proteins (TOMs). We investigated the expression of genes of the Bcl-2 family, i.e., pro-apoptotic Bak and Bid, and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2; VDAC gene, i.e., VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3; and TOMM genes, i.e., TOMM20, TOMM22 and TOMM40. This study was performed at the mRNA and the protein level. Fourteen paraffin embedded prostate cancer tissues and five normal prostate tissues were analyzed by the quantitative PCR array and immunohistochemistry. We found a significant increase in both mRNA expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene and VDAC1 gene in prostate cancer tissue in comparison with their normal counterparts. Translation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and VDAC1 genes in prostate cancer tissue was slightly increased. We observed no significant differences in the mRNA expression of the pro-apoptotic Bak and Bid genes, VDAC2 or VDAC3 genes or the three TOMM genes in these tissues. The pro-apoptotic Bax protein was downtranslated significantly in secretory cells of prostate cancer as compared to normal prostate. We suggest that this protein is a good candidate as biomarker for prostate cancer.""","""['Asmarinah Asmarinah', 'Agnieszka Paradowska-Dogan', 'Ria Kodariah', 'Budiana Tanuhardja', 'Przemyslaw Waliszewski', 'Chaidir Arif Mochtar', 'Wolfgang Weidner', 'Elvira Hinsch']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Bcl-2 family proteins regulate the release of apoptogenic cytochrome c by the mitochondrial channel VDAC.', 'Mouse uterine epithelial apoptosis is associated with expression of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels, release of cytochrome C from mitochondria, and the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 or Bcl-X.', 'Voltage-dependent anion channels are dispensable for mitochondrial-dependent cell death.', 'The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC): function in intracellular signalling, cell life and cell death.', 'BCL-2 proteins and apoptosis: Recent insights and unknowns.', 'Synthesis, In Vitro, and In Vivo Investigations of Pterostilbene-Tethered Analogues as Anti-Breast Cancer Candidates.', 'Characterization of immune features and immunotherapy response in subtypes of hepatocellular carcinoma based on mitophagy.', 'JPX and LINC00641 ncRNAs expression in prostate tissue: a case-control study.', 'Mechanisms of Taxane Resistance.', 'α-Linolenic and γ-linolenic acids exercise differential antitumor effects on HT-29 human colorectal cancer cells.']"""

Consequently, FASN is widely recognized as a valuable therapeutic target. In this report, we describe a variety of 1,4-quinones and 9,10-anthraquinones, including several natural compounds and some newly synthesized compounds, that potently inhibit the thioesterase (TE) domain of FASN. Inhibition of recombinant TE activity, inhibition of cellular FASN, and cytotoxicity in human prostate cancer cell lines and normal fibroblasts, is shown for the most potent inhibitors.

Cancer cells extend invadopodia through the endothelium into the extravascular stroma prior to their extravasation at endothelial junctions. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of invadopodia initiation (cortactin), maturation (Tks5), or function (Tks4) resulted in an abrogation of cancer cell extravasation and metastatic colony formation in an experimental mouse lung metastasis model.

Methods:   Between 2002 and 2007, in a single institution, 136 consecutive patients received salvage RT to a dose of 66 Gy without androgen-deprivation therapy after RP for a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. PSA measurements were systematically performed before RT (PSART), at the fifth week of RT (PSA5), and in the follow-up at least twice a year (every 6 mo). The PSA level decline during RT was expressed as PSA ratio (PSA5/PSART). Two different definitions of biochemical failure after salvage RT were considered: PSA level>0.4 ng/ml and PSA>PSA nadir post-RT +0.4 ng/ml. Statistical analyses included univariate and multivariate Cox regression models.  Results:   The median follow-up was 60 months. The 5-year freedom from biochemical and clinical failure rates were 57% (95% CI: 48%-66%) and 92% (95% CI: 87%-97%), respectively. The mean PSA5 was 0.61 ng/ml (range: 0-7) and the mean PSA ratio was 0.67 (0-1.7). A PSA ratio<1 was a significant prognostic factor in multivariate analysis for both definitions of biochemical failure (P = 0.01 for both) and for clinical failure (P = 0.005).

Methods:   MicroRNAs expression profiles of a xenograft model and cell lines were examined by microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Functional analysis of miR-582-5p in cellular proliferation was examined by cell counting. Furthermore, in order to investigate a candidate target of miR-582-5p, microarray analysis and analysis in silico were utilized.  Results:   MiR-582-5p was identified to be up-regulated at the castration resistant stage of a xenograft model, KUCaP2 and in castration resistant cell line, AILNCaP#1. Overexpression of miR-582-5p increased the number and the percentage of S phase of LNCaP cells under androgen deprived condition. Moreover, suppression of miR-582-5p decreased the number and the percentage of S phase of AILNCaP#1 cells. Furthermore, we identified that miR-582-5p down-regulates EFNB2 expression, which is down-regulated at the castration resistant stage of a xenograft model, KUCaP2 and in castration resistant cell line, AILNCaP#1.

However, little is known about their performance in Chinese men. Our objective is to test the performance of p2PSA and PHI and their added value to tPSA in discriminating biopsy outcomes in Chinese men.  Methods:   Consecutive patients who underwent prostate biopsy in three tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China during 2012-2013 were recruited. Serum tPSA, free PSA (fPSA), and p2PSA were measured centrally using Beckman Coulter's DxI 800 Immunoassay System. The primary outcome is PCa and the secondary outcome is high-grade PCa (Gleason Score of 4 + 3 or worse). Discriminative performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), detection rate and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA).  Results:   Among 636 patients who underwent prostate biopsy, PHI was a significant predictor of biopsy outcomes, independent of other clinical variables. The AUC in discriminating PCa from non-PCa was consistently higher for PHI than tPSA in the entire cohort (0.88 vs. 0.81) as well as in patients with tPSA at 2-10 ng/ml (0.73 vs. 0.53), at 10.1-20 ng/ml (0.81 vs. 0.58), and at tPSA >20 ng/ml (0.90 vs. 0.80). The differences were statistically significant in all comparisons, P < 0.01.

This recombinant virus has a telomerase promoter at the 5'-end of the viral genome and GFP at the 3'-end. To date, CTC enumeration using OBP-401 has shown prognostic impact for gastric and small cell lung cancer patients. In the present study, peripheral blood samples from patients with eight types of cancer, including some cancers previously untested with OBP-401 (i.e., esophagus, pancreas, and prostate cancers) were subjected to this method in order to evaluate its versatility. It was recently discovered that some white blood cells (WBCs) false-positively react with OBP-401. Although anti-CD45 antibodies can absorb these adverse cells from peripheral blood, the simplicity of the OBP-401 method would be diminished by the introduction of antibody treatment. Therefore, we evaluated another approach to minimize the false positivity of WBCs. Seven anti-CD antibodies were employed to stain the species of WBCs that false-positively reacted with OBP-401. We revealed that the false-positively reacted WBCs were monocytes in the peripheral blood of both healthy subjects and cancer patients. Based on a size distribution analysis of the GFP-positive monocytes, the size criterion for CTCs using OBP-401 was defined to be a cellular diameter>8.4 µm. In total, 43% of 86 cancer patients examined in the present study were CTC-positive using this definition. CTCs were enumerated from peripheral blood samples collected from patients with each of the eight types of cancer; the detectability of CTCs for esophagus, pancreas and prostate cancers by the OBP-401 method was confirmed for the first time in the present study. However, no clear correlation between CTC positivity and the clinical characteristics of patients with any type of cancer was observed because of the small number of patients with each type of cancer.

Treatments against advanced PCa are limited and in many cases only palliative. In a later, androgent independent, stage of PCa androgen receptors can be activated without interaction with ligand, i.e., by receptors of tyrosine kinase (RTK) family in the outlaw pathway. Human epidermal growth factor receptors HER2 and EGFR belong to RTK-family. HER2 is one of the main actors in the outlaw pathway with EGFR as the preferable heterodimerizing partner. We hypothesized that information on HER2 expression in advanced PCa could be useful for selection of patients for anti-RTK therapy and monitoring of therapy response. A panel of PCa cell lines (LNCap, PC3, DU-145) was subjected to a 8-week treatment using drugs influencing the RTK: trastuzumab (anti‑HER2), 17-DMAG (Hsp90 inhibitor), alone or in combination, and their HER2 and EGFR expressions were compared with non-treated cells. Treatment with trastuzumab decreased proliferation of LNCap and DU-145 cell lines, while 17-DMAG and trastuzumab/17‑DMAG combination affected all three cell lines. HER2 expression was significantly increased in PC3 cells, the most resistant cell line. On the contrary, in responding cells (LNCap and DU-145) HER2 expression decreased, accompanied by increased EGFR expression. However, additional treatment of cells with cetuximab (anti‑EGFR) did not give any additive effect to trastuzumab. In this study the response to anti-RTK therapy proved to vary between different PCa cell lines. We have demonstrated that RTK targeting treatments may affect the phenotypic profile of PCa tumor cells that correlates with therapy outcome.

Cross-resistance between androgen receptor-directed therapies and taxanes has been suggested, possibly leading to lower efficacy of enzalutamide in the post-D setting.  Methods:   We aimed to examine the impact of prior D treatment on the clinical activity of enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC. We retrospectively reviewed an institutional database to identify men with mCRPC treated with standard-of-care enzalutamide. Patients were classified as D-naïve or D-pretreated. The efficacy end points were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates (≥ 50% PSA decline), time to PSA progression (TTPP) and clinical/radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) in response to enzalutamide. Differences between groups (D-naïve and D-pretreated) were assessed by univariate and multivariable analyses using logistic and Cox regression models.  Results:   One-hundred-seven (107) consecutive patients were included: 60 were D-pretreated and 47 were D-naïve. PSA responses were 43.2% in D-naïve patients and 25.4% in D-pretreated patients (P = 0.089). Median TTPP was 7.2 months (95% CI = 4.5 - 17.2) in the D-naïve group versus 2.6 mo (95% CI = 1.9 - 3.5) in the D-pretreated group (P < 0.0001). Median PFS was not reached for D-naïve men and was 3.3 mo (95% CI = 2.5 - 4.8) for D-pretreated men (P < 0.0001). After adjusting for potential confounders including prior abiraterone use, differences remained statistically significant for TTPP (HR = 2.32; 95% CI = 1.19 - 4.50; P = 0.013) and marginally significant for PFS (HR = 1.90; 95% CI = 0.94 - 3.84; P = 0.073) in multivariable analyses. Among patients who achieved a PSA response to enzalutamide (n = 34), results suggested a trend towards shorter duration of response in D-pretreated patients.

Methods:   Using confocal microscopy to identify cell-to-cell relationships in situ, we studied the most common gene rearrangement in prostate cancer (TMPRSS2 and ERG) and the tumor suppressor CHD1 in 56 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Wild type ERG was found in 22 of 56 patients; ERG copy number was increased in 10/56, and ERG rearrangements confirmed in 24/56 patients.

Previous studies have produced conflicting data on the activity of docetaxel in patients who did not attain a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to abiraterone acetate (abiraterone). We investigated whether the biochemical response to abiraterone is associated with efficacy of subsequent docetaxel therapy.  Methods:   mCRPC patients treated with docetaxel after abiraterone were retrospectively identified at three Canadian institutions. Patients who had also received docetaxel prior to abiraterone were termed ""docetaxel-experienced,"" while those not treated with docetaxel prior to abiraterone were termed ""docetaxel-naïve."" Treatment outcomes on docetaxel were stratified by prior response to abiraterone and compared using χ(2) -square test for confirmed PSA response rate (≥ 50% decline from baseline maintained for ≥ 3 weeks) and the log-rank method for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Eighty-six patients were treated with abiraterone, of whom 49 were docetaxel-experienced and 37 were docetaxel-naïve. Prior PSA response to abiraterone was no decline, <50% decline and ≥ 50% decline in 37%, 26%, and 37% of patients respectively. The overall PSA response rate to docetaxel was 34.9%, median PFS was 4.0 months and median OS was 11.66 months. Notably, no differences were seen in confirmed PSA response rates (38% vs. 36% vs. 31%, P = 0.86), median PFS (4.04 months vs. 3.94 months vs. 4.24 months, P = 0.43) and median OS (11.86 months vs. 15.38 months vs. 11.00 months, P = 0.56) on docetaxel for patients with no PSA decline, <50% decline and ≥ 50% decline on abiraterone respectively. Importantly, PSA response rates to docetaxel were comparable in the docetaxel-experienced and docetaxel-naïve cohorts and were not linked to prior response to abiraterone in either group.

The antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects of PM were associated with the inhibition of cell cycle regulatory proteins, antiapoptotic survivin and members of the Bcl-2 family. Data showed that response to PM is regulated by survivin since overexpression of survivin rendered CaP cells resistant to PM.

Thus, identifying and targeting critical AR-regulated genes is one potential method to block castration-resistant cancer proliferation. Of particular importance are transcription factors that regulate stem cell pluripotency; many of these genes are emerging as critical oncogenes in numerous tumor cell types. Of these, Nanog has been previously shown to increase the self-renewal and stem-like properties of prostate cancer cells. Thus, we hypothesized that Nanog is a candidate AR target gene that may impart castration-resistance.  Methods:   We modulated AR signaling in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and assayed for Nanog expression. Direct AR binding to the NANOG promoter was tested using AR Chromatin Immunoprecipation (ChIP) and analyses of publically available AR ChIP-sequencing data-sets. Nanog over-expressing cells were analyzed for cell growth and cytotoxicity in response to the AR antagonist enzalutamide and the microtubule stabilizing agent docetaxel.  Results:   AR signaling upregulates Nanog mRNA and protein. AR binds directly to the NANOG promoter, and was not identified within 75 kb of the NANOGP8 pseudogene, suggesting the NANOG gene locus was preferentially activated. Nanog overexpression in LNCaP cells increases overall growth, but does not increase resistance to enzalutamide or docetaxel.

Activation of this pathway in differentiated luminal cells of mice induces high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). Though the cell of origin of prostate cancer has yet to be conclusively identified, a castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cell (CARN) may act as a cell of origin for prostate cancer.  Methods:   To activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CARNs, we crossed mice carrying tamoxifen-inducible Nkx3.1-driven Cre to mice containing loxP sites in order to either conditionally knock out adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) or constitutively activate β-catenin directly. We then castrated and hormonally regenerated these mice to target the CARN population.  Results:   Loss of Apc in hormonally normal mice induced HGPIN; however, after one or more rounds of castration and hormonal regeneration, Apc-null CARNs disappeared. Alternatively, when β-catenin was constitutively activated under the same conditions, HGPIN was apparent.  Conclusion:   Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling via Apc deletion is sufficient to produce HGPIN in hormonally normal mice. Loss of Apc may destabilize the CARN population under regeneration conditions. When β-catenin is constitutively activated, HGPIN occurs in hormonally regenerated mice.

In the present study, we investigated ERG expression in all stages of PCa progression, and evaluated the prognostic impact of ERG status in clinically localized PCa (CLC) and in castration resistant disease (CRPC).  Methods:   ERG and AR expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing samples of high grade PIN (n = 57), CLC surgically treated (n = 299, including 185 Caucasians and 114 African-Caribbeans), metastases (n = 17), and CRPC (n = 41).  Results:   In Caucasians, ERG expression significantly increased from high grade PIN (17.5%) to pT2 (27%) and pT3 CLC (43%), then to metastases (53%). In CLC, stainings for ERG and AR were correlated, and ERG expression was less frequent in African-Caribbeans compared to Caucasians (11.5% vs. 33%). In Caucasians CLC, ERG was associated with longer recurrence free survival, after adjusting for classical prognostic markers. In CRPC, ERG was expressed in 29% of cases, and was associated with a longer overall survival.  Conclusions:   Our results confirm that ERG expression is less frequent in PCa from patients of African descent. Although ERG expression increases during PCa natural history, positive ERG status is associated with better outcome in both CLC and CRPC. This paradox could be explained in part by the fact that ERG expression is AR dependant, then ERG positive cancers are likely to progress in a rich androgen environment, with a better response to androgen suppression.""","""['Michael Taris', 'Jacques Irani', 'Pascal Blanchet', 'Luc Multigner', 'Xavier Cathelineau', 'Gaelle Fromont']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Expression of store-operated channel components in prostate cancer: the prognostic paradox.', 'Characterizing the molecular features of ERG-positive tumors in primary and castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic significance of combined ERG and androgen receptor expression in patients with prostate cancer managed by androgen deprivation therapy.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'ERG protein expression as a biomarker of prostate cancer.', 'Unravelling the Role of P300 and TMPRSS2 in Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Anti-tumor activity of a T-helper 1 multiantigen vaccine in a murine model of prostate cancer.', 'From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.', 'PACE4-altCT isoform of proprotein convertase PACE4 as tissue and plasmatic biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of ERG Expression in Prostate Adenocarcinoma and Its Prognostic Impact in Patients Survival Rate.']"""

This paper aimed to describe the incidence rates of most common cancers--and/or of those cancer preventable through modifiable behaviors--recorded in the province of Setif, Algeria from 1986 through 2010.  Methods:   Cancer diagnoses for the 1986-2010 period were provided by the population-based Cancer Registry of Setif, disentangled by site, morphology, age (quinquennia), sex, and calendar period. The corresponding population was obtained from the Algerian Institute of Statistics. Age-standardized rates (world population) (ASR-WR) were computed by calendar period (five quinquennias from 1986-1990 to 2006-2010), while annual percent changes (APCs) were computed for the period 1996-2010.  Results:   During the 2006-2010 period, ASR-WR for all cancer sites were 106.4/100,000 in men and 110.3 in women. The four leading cancers were: lung (18.0%); colon-rectum (9.6%); bladder (9.1%); and prostate (6.5%) in men; breast (36.4%); colon-rectum (8.5%); cervix uteri (6.0%); and thyroid (6.0%) in women. Between 1996-2010, overall cancer incidence increased statistically significantly (p < 0.05) in both men (APC = +2.5%) and women (APC = +3.7%). Statistically significant decreasing trends were observed for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (APC = -3.4%) in men, and for cervical (APC = -4.2%) and gallbladder (APC = -3.2%) cancers in women. Statistically significant increasing trends were observed for most common cancers both in men (lung:+1.8%, colon-rectum:+5.4%, prostate:+4.3%, liver:+8.9%, and bladder:+5.9%) and women (breast:+8.2%, colon-rectum:+4.5%, lung:+10.0%, liver:+5.4%, thyroid:+5.3%, and larynx:+13.8%).

Augmented levels of oxidative stress biomarkers, such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), have been shown to associate with more aggressive behavior in many malignancies. The aim of this study was to determine whether Nrf-2 and 8-OHDG expression could predict the outcome in radical prostatectomy patients. Samples of 240 prostate cancer patients were analyzed for Nrf-2 and 8-OHDG expression by immunohistochemistry. The results were compared with clinicopathological data, biochemical recurrence-free survival (BFS), prostate cancer-specific survival, and overall survival (OS). Positive expression of 8-OHDG (P < .0001), Nrf-2 in cytoplasm (c-Nrf-2) (P = .015), and Nrf-2 in nucleus (n-Nrf-2) (P = .016) was more abundant in malignant tissue compared with benign, respectively. Elevated level of c-Nrf-2 expression was associated with positive surgical marginal (P = .005), extraprostatic extension (P = .031), biochemical recurrence (BCR) (P = .030), and OS (P = .002); and n-Nrf-2 expression was associated with pathologic stage class (P = .001), Gleason score (P = .026), extraprostatic extension (P = .027), BCR (P = .037), and OS (P < .0001). The increased c-Nrf-2 expression predicted shortened BFS (P = .034) and worse OS (P = .017). In the multivariate analysis, c-Nrf-2 (P = .028 and P = .019) and Gleason score (P = .001 and P = .033) were independent predictors of BFS and OS, respectively. Expression of the analyzed biomarkers was not linked with prostate cancer-specific survival. Expression of 8-OHDG was not associated with any clinicopathological factors or survival. These results reveal that increased c-Nrf-2 expression is a predictor of BFS and OS in conjunction with Gleason score in prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.""","""['Sami Raatikainen', 'Sirpa Aaltomaa', 'Vesa Kärjä', 'Ylermi Soini']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Increased Peroxiredoxin 6 Expression Predicts Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'TWIST overexpression predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Large-scale independent validation of the nuclear factor-kappa B p65 prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer.', 'Decreased expression of lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0/OH) in high resolution imaging mass spectrometry independently predicts biochemical recurrence after surgical treatment for prostate cancer.', 'The role of radical prostatectomy for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The prognostic value of NRF2 in solid tumor patients: a meta-analysis.', 'Overexpression of NRF2 is correlated with prognoses of patients with malignancies: A meta-analysis.', 'Nuclear transcription factor Nrf2 suppresses prostate cancer cells growth and migration through upregulating ferroportin.']"""

Methods:   Two hundred and five patients who underwent permanent seed brachytherapy were included in the study. For prostate dosimetry V90, V100, V150, V200, D90 and COIN were used. The dose to urethra and rectum was determined by the maximal dose and relative doses that cover specified volumes. Means and standard deviations were calculated and statistically compared.  Results:   On average, 54 (range, 30-78) and 48 (range, 31-67) seeds were implanted in the prostate with individual median activities of 0.62 U (range, 0.52-0.70 U) and 0.71 U (range, 0.65-0.71 U) for LS and SS technique, respectively. The target coverage was slightly better with SS (V100: 98% vs. 96%,p < 0.05; D90: 172 Gy vs. 166 Gy, p < 0.05), but more conformal dose distributions were observed with LS (COIN: 0.70 vs. 0.63, p < 0.05). The dose homogeneity did not differ significantly between the two groups. Regarding the dose to urethra and rectum all dose parameters were significantly lower with LS.  Conclusions:   LS resulted in less dose to the urethra and rectum compared to SS in intraoperative dosimetry.

However, PSA is not an optimal prognostic tool as its sensitivity may be too low to reduce morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is a demand for additional robust biomarkers for prostate cancer. Death receptor 5 (DR5) has been implicated in the prognosis of several cancers and it has been previously shown that it is negatively regulated by Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in prostate cancer cell lines. The present study investigated the clinical significance of DR5 expression in a prostate cancer patient cohort and its correlation with YY1 expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of protein expression distribution was performed using tissue microarray constructs from 54 primary PCa and 39 prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) specimens. DR5 expression was dramatically reduced as a function of higher tumor grade. By contrast, YY1 expression was elevated in PCa tumors as compared with that in PIN, and was increased with higher tumor grade. DR5 had an inverse correlation with YY1 expression.

Objective:   To evaluate differences in pretreatment urinary and sexual function in two population-based cohorts of men with prostate cancer enrolled nearly 20 yr apart.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients were enrolled in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study (PCOS) or the Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation (CEASAR) study, two population-based cohorts that enrolled patients with incident prostate cancer from 1994 to 1995 and from 2011 to 2012, respectively. Participants completed surveys at baseline and various time points thereafter.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We performed multivariable logistic and linear regression analysis to investigate differences in pretreatment function between studies.  Results and limitations:   The study comprised 5469 men of whom 2334 (43%) were enrolled in PCOS and 3135 (57%) were enrolled in CEASAR. Self-reported urinary incontinence was higher in CEASAR compared with PCOS (7.7% vs 4.7%; adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-2.43). Similarly, self-reported erectile dysfunction was more common among CEASAR participants (44.7% vs 24.0%) with an adjusted OR of 3.12 (95% CI, 2.68-3.64). Multivariable linear regression models revealed less favorable self-reported baseline function among CEASAR participants in the urinary incontinence and sexual function domains. The study is limited by its observational design and possibility of unmeasured confounding.  Conclusions:   Reporting of pretreatment urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction has increased over the past two decades.

Methods and materials:   From 2002 to July 2012, 377 pts with a diagnosis of intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer were treated with EBRT plus HDRB. Median patient age was 66 years (range, 41-86). Most patients (347 pts; 92%) were classified as high-risk (stage T2c-T3, or PSA>20 ng/mL, or GS ⩾ 8), with 30 patients (8%) considered intermediate risk. All patients underwent EBRT at a prescribed dose of 60.0 Gy (range, 45-70 Gy) to the prostate and seminal vesicles. A total of 120 pts (31%) received a dose of 46 Gy (45-50 Gy) to the true pelvis. All pts received a single-fraction 9 Gy (9-15 Gy) HDR boost. Most patients (353; 94%) were prescribed complete androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Overall survival (OS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS) rates were calculated. In the case of BRFS, patients with <26 months of follow-up (n=106) were excluded to minimize the impact of ADT.  Results:   The median follow-up for the entire sample was 50 months (range, 12-126), with 5-year actuarial OS and CSS, respectively, of 88% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 84-92) and 98% (95% CI: 97-99). The 5-year BRFS was 91% (95% CI: 87-95) in the 271 pts with ⩾ 26 months (median, 60 months) of follow-up.

The role of PARP-1 in prostate cancer development and progression is not fully understood. The present study investigated the function of PARP-1 in prostate growth and tumorigenesis in vivo. Functional inactivation of PARP-1 by gene-targeted deletion led to a significant reduction in the prostate gland size in young PARP-1-/- mice (6 weeks) compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. To determine the effect of PARP-1 functional loss on prostate cancer onset, PARP-1-/- mice were crossed with the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. Pathological assessment of prostate tumors revealed that TRAMP+/-, PARP-1-/- mice exhibited higher grade prostate tumors compared with TRAMP+/- PARP-1+/+ (16-28 weeks) that was associated with a significantly increased proliferative index and decreased apoptosis among the epithelial cells in TRAMP+/- PARP-1-/- prostate tumors. Furthermore tumors harboring PARP-1 loss, exhibited a downregulation of nuclear androgen receptor. Impairing PARP-1 led to increased levels of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and Smads that correlated with induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as established by loss of E-cadherin and β-catenin and upregulation of N-cadherin and ZEB-1. Our findings suggest that impaired PARP-1 function promotes prostate tumorigenesis in vivo via TGF-β-induced EMT. Defining the EMT control by PARP-1 during prostate cancer progression is of translational significance for optimizing PARP-1 therapeutic targeting and predicting response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Hong Pu', 'Craig Horbinski', 'Patrick J Hensley', 'Emily A Matuszak', 'Timothy Atkinson', 'Natasha Kyprianou']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Dysfunctional transforming growth factor-beta receptor II accelerates prostate tumorigenesis in the TRAMP mouse model.', 'Selective targeting of PARP-2 inhibits androgen receptor signaling and prostate cancer growth through disruption of FOXA1 function.', 'Dual roles of PARP-1 promote cancer growth and progression.', 'Cell death under epithelial-mesenchymal transition control in prostate cancer therapeutic response.', 'An assessment of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 role in normal and cancer cells.', 'The lactate-NAD+ axis activates cancer-associated fibroblasts by downregulating p62.', 'Role of EMT in the DNA damage response, double-strand break repair pathway choice and its implications in cancer treatment.', 'Possible Action of Olaparib for Preventing Invasion of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibition promotes pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma by boosting ezrin phosphorylation.', 'Immunohistochemical Evaluation of PARP and Caspase-3 as Prognostic Markers in Prostate Carcinomas.']"""

Herein, a new electrochemical immunosensor for sensitive determination of PSA was designed by using redox and catalysis 'all-in-one' infinite coordination polymer (PtNP@ICP) as signal tag on the polyamidoamine dendrimers modified electrode interface. To construct such 'all-in-one' PtNP@ICP nanostructures, the coordination polymerization was fully carried between metal ions and polydentate bridging ligands, and the PtNP was encapsulated into the ICP in the process of polymerization. The prepared PtNP@ICP nanocatalyst was characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR). And the synthesized PtNP@ICP was utilized as signal tag for the label of PSA. With a sandwich-type immunoassay format, the conjugated signal tag on the transducer increased with the increasing PSA concentration in the sample thus enhancing the signal of the electrochemical immunosensor due to the catalytic reduction toward H2O2 of the enveloped PtNP. Under optimal conditions, the current was proportional to the logarithm of PSA concentration ranging from 0.001 to 60 ng/mL. The detection limit (LOD) was 0.3 pg/mL at 3 sB.

Similar to IGF-1R, ALK fusion proteins bind to the adaptor insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and IRS-1 knockdown enhances the antitumor effects of ALK inhibitors. In models of ALK TKI resistance, the IGF-1R pathway is activated, and combined ALK and IGF-1R inhibition improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with this finding, the levels of IGF-1R and IRS-1 are increased in biopsy samples from patients progressing on crizotinib monotherapy.

Tasquinimod's potency is facilitated by its reversible binding (Kd < 35 μM) to the IIA subdomain of albumin (Sudlow's site I). As blood vessels within the compromised cancer microenvironment are characterized by a higher degree of leakiness than those in normal tissues, this results in an enhanced uptake of tasquinimod bound to albumin in cancer tissue via a tumor specific process known as the ""enhanced permeability and retention"" (i.e., EPR) effect. Thus, despite plasma levels of < 1 µM, the EPR effect results in intracellular drug concentrations of 2-3 µM, levels several-fold higher than needed for inhibition of endothelial sprouting (IC50 ~ 0.5 µM) or for inhibition of HDAC4 and S100A9 mediated tumor growth.""","""['John T Isaacs', 'Susan L Dalrymple', 'D Marc Rosen', 'Hans Hammers', 'Anders Olsson', 'Tomas Leanderson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The quinoline-3-carboxamide anti-angiogenic agent, tasquinimod, enhances the anti-prostate cancer efficacy of androgen ablation and taxotere without effecting serum PSA directly in human xenografts.', 'Tasquinimod Is an Allosteric Modulator of HDAC4 survival signaling within the compromised cancer microenvironment.', 'Tasquinimod inhibits prostate cancer growth in bone through alterations in the bone microenvironment.', 'Tasquinimod: How to act on microenvironment in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The long and winding road for the development of tasquinimod as an oral second-generation quinoline-3-carboxamide antiangiogenic drug for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'S100A9‑containing serum exosomes obtained from patients with burn injuries promote myocardial cell pyroptosis through NLRP3.', '2-fluoro-5-maleimidobenzoic acid-linked albumin drug (MAD) delivery for selective systemic targeting of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Developing an anticancer copper(II) pro-drug based on the nature of cancer cell and human serum albumin carrier IIA subdomain: mouse model of breast cancer.', 'Pharmacokinetic Study of Praziquantel Enantiomers and Its Main Metabolite R-trans-4-OH-PZQ in Plasma, Blood and Dried Blood Spots in Opisthorchis viverrini-Infected Patients.']"""

The purpose of this paper was to examine the extent to which the conventional multi-item domain structure of the QLQ-C30 holds across patients with seven different primary cancer sites.  Methods:   Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was used to test whether a measurement model of the QLQ-C30 was invariant across cancer sites. Configural (same patterns of factor loadings), metric (equivalence of factor loadings) and scalar (equivalence of thresholds) invariance amongst the cancer site groups were assessed (N = 1,906) by comparing the fit of a model with these parameters freely estimated to a model where estimates were constrained to be equal for the corresponding items in each group.  Results:   All groups exhibited good model fit except for the prostate group, which was excluded. Only 1 of 576 parameters was found to differ between primary sites: specifically, the first threshold of Item 1 in the breast cancer group exhibited non-invariance. In a post hoc analysis, several instances of non-invariance by treatment status (baseline, on-treatment, off-treatment) were observed.  Conclusions:   Given only one instance of non-invariance between cancer sites, there is a reason to be confident in the validity of conclusions drawn when comparing QLQ-C30 domain scores between different sites and when interpreting the scores of heterogeneous samples, although future research should assess the potential impact of confounding variables such as treatment and gender.""","""['D S J Costa', 'N K Aaronson', 'P M Fayers', 'J F Pallant', 'G Velikova', 'M T King']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Assessing measurement invariance in the EORTC QLQ-C30.', 'Consistency matters: measurement invariance of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire in patients with hematologic malignancies.', 'QLU-C10D: a health state classification system for a multi-attribute utility measure based on the EORTC QLQ-C30.', 'Development of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire module for older people with cancer: The EORTC QLQ-ELD15.', 'Measurement invariance in the social sciences: Historical development, methodological challenges, state of the art, and future perspectives.', 'Breast Cancer: How Hippotherapy Bridges the Gap between Healing and Recovery-A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.', 'Psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).', 'Assessing measurement invariance in the EORTC QLQ-C30.', 'Consistency matters: measurement invariance of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire in patients with hematologic malignancies.', 'Dimensionality and Measurement Invariance of the Italian Version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 in Postoperative Lung Cancer Patients.']"""

The shift towards elder age groups in central European populations in the next decades is likely to contribute to an increase in cancer incidence for many cancer sites. In Tyrol, cancer incidence data have been registered on a high level of completeness for more than 20 years. We therefore aimed to compute well-founded predictions of cancer incidence for Tyrol for the year 2020 for all frequent cancer sites and for all cancer sites combined.  Methods:   After defining a prediction base range for every cancer site, we extrapolated the age-specific time trends in the prediction base range following a linear model for increasing and a log-linear model for decreasing time trends. The extrapolated time trends were evaluated for the year 2020 applying population figures supplied by Statistics Austria.  Results:   Compared with the number of annual incident cases for the year 2009 for all cancer sites combined except non-melanoma skin cancer, we predicted an increase of 235 (15 %) and 362 (21 %) for females and males, respectively. For both sexes, more than 90 % of the increase is attributable to the shift toward older age groups in the next decade. The biggest increase in absolute numbers is seen for females in breast cancer (92, 21 %), lung cancer (64, 52 %), colorectal cancer (40, 24 %), melanoma (38, 30 %) and the haematopoietic system (37, 35 %) and for males in prostate cancer (105, 25 %), colorectal cancer (91, 45 %), the haematopoietic system (71, 55 %), bladder cancer (69, 100 %) and melanoma (64, 52 %).  Conclusions:   The increase in the number of incident cancer cases of 15 % in females and 21 % in males in the next decade is very relevant for planning purposes. However, external factors cause uncertainty in the prediction of some cancer sites (mainly prostate cancer and colorectal cancer) and the prediction intervals are still broad.

DNA methylation plays an important role in determining the biology of cancer but prognostic information is scanty. We assessed the potential of gene-specific DNA methylation changes to predict death from prostate cancer in a cohort of untreated men in the UK.  Methods:   This was a population-based study in which cases were identified from six cancer registries in Great Britain. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded transurethral prostate resection tissues collected during 1990-96 from men with clinically-localised cancer who chose not to be treated for at least 6 months following diagnosis. The primary end point was death from prostate cancer. Outcomes were determined through medical records and cancer registry records. Pyrosequencing was used to quantify methylation in 13 candidate genes with established or suggested roles in cancer. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to identify possible predictors for prostate cancer-related death.  Results:   Of 367 men, 99 died from prostate cancer during a median of 9.5 years follow-up (max = 20). Univariately, 12 genes were significantly associated with prostate cancer mortality, hazard ratios ranged between 1.09 and 1.28 per decile increase in methylation. Stepwise Cox regression modelling suggested that the methylation of genes HSPB1, CCND2 and DPYS contributed objective prognostic information to Gleason score and PSA with respect to cancer-related death during follow-up (p = 0.006).  Conclusion:   Methylation of 13 genes was analysed in 367 men with localised prostate cancer who were conservatively treated and stratified with respect to death from prostate cancer and those who survived or died of other causes. Of the 13 genes analysed, differential methylation of HSPB1, CCND2 and DPYS provided independent prognostic information.

This paper detects and determines the extent of tissue displacement during an MRI-guided biopsy so that the needle insertion plan can be adjusted accordingly.  Methods:   A multi-slice-to-volume registration algorithm was developed to align the pre-operative planning image volume with three intra-operative orthogonal image slices of the prostate acquired immediately before needle insertion. The algorithm consists of an initial rigid transformation followed by a deformable step.  Results:   A total of 14 image sets from 10 patients were studied. Based on prostate contour alignment, the registrations were accurate to within 2 mm.

Previously, we have shown that 2'-hydroxy-4-methylsulfonylchalcone (RG003) induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU145. Although tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anticancer agent, some cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL treatment. PC-3 and LNCaP prostatic cancer cell lines have been reported to be resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here, we show for the first time that RG003 overcomes TRAIL resistance in prostate cancer cells. RG003 can enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis through DR5 upregulation and downregulation of Bcl-2, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) survival pathways. When used in combined treatment, RG003 and TRAIL amplified TRAIL-induced activation of apoptosis effectors and particularly activation of caspase-8 and the executioner caspase-3, leading to increased poly-ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage and DNA fragmentation in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we showed that RG003 reduced COX-2 expression in cells. Previously, we showed that COX-2 was involved in resistance to an apoptosis mechanism; then, its inhibition by RG003 could render cells more sensitive to TRAIL treatment. We showed that nuclear factor-κB activation was inhibited after RG003 treatment. This inhibition was correlated with reduction in COX-2 expression and induction of apoptosis. Overall, we conclude, for the first time, that RG003 can enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. The significance of our in-vitro study with RG003 and TRAIL combined is very encouraging, suggesting the relevance of testing this combined treatment in xenograft animal models.""","""['Bassel Ismail', 'Catherine Fagnere', 'Youness Limami', 'Lamia Ghezali', 'Christelle Pouget', 'Chloë Fidanzi', 'Catherine Ouk', 'Rokhaya Gueye', 'Jean-Louis Beneytout', 'Jean-Luc Duroux', 'Mona Diab-Assaf', 'David Y Leger', 'Bertrand Liagre']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Novel methylsulfonyl chalcones as potential antiproliferative drugs for human prostate cancer: involvement of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.', 'The dietary flavonol fisetin enhances the apoptosis-inducing potential of TRAIL in prostate cancer cells.', 'Downmodulation of dimethyl transferase activity enhances tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor by natural products as a potential therapeutic approach for cancer therapy.', 'Role of TRAIL in the treatment of prostate cancer: An update.', 'Modern aspects of the use of natural polyphenols in tumor prevention and therapy.', 'The lncRNA CASC2 Modulates Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Sensitivity and Resistance to TRAIL Through Apoptotic and Non-Apoptotic Signaling.', 'Oxyphenbutazone promotes cytotoxicity in rats and Hep3B cellsvia suppression of PGE2 and deactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of prostate and bladder cancer cells.', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand-Induced Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells after Treatment with Xanthohumol-A Natural Compound Present in Humulus lupulus L.']"""

We examined the association between randomization to screening for lung, prostate, colorectal and/or ovarian cancers and thyroid cancer incidence in two large prospective randomized screening trials.  Methods:   We assessed the association between randomization to low-dose helical CT scan versus chest x-ray for lung cancer screening and risk of thyroid cancer in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). In the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO), we assessed the association between randomization to regular screening for said cancers versus usual medical care and thyroid cancer risk. Over a median 6 and 11 years of follow-up in NLST and PLCO, respectively, we identified 60 incident and 234 incident thyroid cancer cases. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the cause specific hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for thyroid cancer.  Results:   In NLST, randomization to lung CT scan was associated with a non-significant increase in thyroid cancer risk (HR = 1.61; 95% CI: 0.96-2.71). This association was stronger during the first 3 years of follow-up, during which participants were actively screened (HR = 2.19; 95% CI: 1.07-4.47), but not subsequently (HR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.49-2.37). In PLCO, randomization to cancer screening compared with usual care was associated with a significant decrease in thyroid cancer risk for men (HR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49-0.95) but not women (HR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.66-1.26). Similar results were observed when restricting to papillary thyroid cancer in both NLST and PLCO.

Objective:   To develop a standardised operational process assessment tool basing on the capability maturity model integration (CMMI) able to implement multidisciplinary care and improve process quality and efficiency.  Design, setting, and participants:   Information for model development was derived from medical experts, clinical guidelines, best practice elements of renowned cancer centres, and scientific literature. Data were organised in a hierarchically structured model, consisting of 5 categories, 30 key process areas, 172 requirements, and more than 1500 criteria. Compliance with requirements was assessed through structured on-site surveys covering all relevant clinical and management processes. Comparison with best practice standards allowed to recommend improvements. 'Act On Oncology'(AoO) was applied in a pilot study on a prostate cancer unit in Europe.  Results and limitations:   Several best practice elements such as multidisciplinary clinics or advanced organisational measures for patient scheduling were observed. Substantial opportunities were found in other areas such as centre management and infrastructure. As first improvements the evaluated centre administration described and formalised the organisation of the prostate cancer unit with defined personnel assignments and clinical activities and a formal agreement is being worked on to have structured access to First-Aid Posts.

This structure consists of highly hydrated polysaccharides, including glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), and galactoxylomannan (GalXM). It is also composed of mannoproteins (MPs) which corresponds to less than 1% of the capsular weight. Despite MPs being the minority and least studied components, four of these molecules with molecular masses of 115, 98, 88, and 84 kDa were identified and characterized as C. neoformans immunoreactive antigens involved in the pathogenesis, and are potential cryptococcosis vaccine candidates. With the aim to describe the adhesive property of MPs, we cloned and expressed the MP84, a mannoprotein with molecular weight of 84 kDa, on Pichia pastoris yeast, and performed interaction assays of C. neoformans with epithelial lung cells, in the presence or absence of capsule components. Two fungal strains, the wild type, NE-241, and a mutant, CAP67, deficient in GXM production, were used throughout this study. The adhesion assays were completed using epithelial lung cells, A549, and human prostate cancer cells, PC3, as a control. We observed that capsulated wild type (NE-241), and acapsular (CAP67) strains adhered significantly to A549 cells, compared with PC3 cells (p < 0.05). GXM inhibits the NE-241 adhesion, but not the CAP67. In contrast, CAP67 adhesion was only inhibited in the presence of MP84. These results demonstrate the involvement of MP in the adhesion of C. neoformans to epithelial lung cells.

This recurrence is believed to be due to the presence of a subpopulation of cells called cancer stem cells in the tumor. Therefore, a combination therapy which is susceptible to both types of cells is desirable. Delivery of this combinatorial approach in a nanoparticulate system will provide even a better therapeutic outcome in tumor targeting. The objective of this study was to develop and characterize nanoparticulate system containing two anticancer agents (cyclopamine and paclitaxel) having different susceptibilities toward cancer cells.

However, the PLGA particles were 234.5 ± 6.8 nm in size with a negative zeta potential. Thermal analyses of both nanoparticles revealed that the drugs were present in noncrystalline state in the matrix. A sustained in vitro release was observed for both the drugs in these nanoparticles. PLGA blank particles showed no cytotoxicity in all the cell lines tested, whereas GMO-chitosan blank particles showed substantial cytotoxicity.

A PSM is an independent predictor of BCR; however, not all patients develop BCR later on.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1,117 consecutive prostate cancer patients who underwent RP without neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy from July 2005 to December 2009. Of these, 516 (46.2 %) patients without PSMs, and 214 (19.2 %) patients with PSMs who later achieved undetectable PSA, defined as <0.01 ng/ml, were identified. Patients with PSMs were stratified according to time to undetectable PSA dichotomized at 6 weeks and compared with patients without PSMs. Patients with PSMs who did not achieve undetectable PSA were excluded. BCR was defined as two consecutive increases of post-undetectable PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml.  Results:   During the median follow-up of 58.2 months, patients with PSMs who achieved undetectable PSA in <6 weeks had comparable 5-year BCR-free survival rates to those without PSMs; however, patients with PSMs who achieved undetectable PSA in ≥6 weeks showed significantly lower rates compared with both patients without PSMs (59.2 vs 74.3 %; p < 0.001) and patients with PSMs who achieved undetectable PSA in <6 weeks (59.2 vs 78.8 %; p = 0.004). Among patients with PSMs, multivariate analysis revealed time to undetectable PSA at ≥6 weeks and seminal vesicle invasion to be independent predictors of BCR.

Thus, we examined PLA2R1 expression in primary prostate cells (PCS-440-010) and human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, DU-145, and PC-3), and we determined the effect of PLA2R1 knockdown on cytotoxicity induced by free or liposome-encapsulated chemotherapeutics. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the expression of PLA2R1 was higher in prostate cancer cells compared to that in primary prostate cells. Knockdown of PLA2R1 expression in PC-3 cells using shRNA increased cell proliferation and did not affect the toxicity of cisplatin, doxorubicin (Dox), and docetaxel. In contrast, PLA2R1 knockdown increased the in vitro toxicity of Dox encapsulated in sPLA2 responsive liposomes (SPRL) and correlated with increased Dox and SPRL uptake. Knockdown of PLA2R1 also increased the expression of Group IIA and X sPLA2. These data show the novel findings that PLA2R1 is expressed in prostate cancer cells, that PLA2R1 expression alters cell proliferation, and that PLA2R1 modulates the behavior of liposome-based nanoparticles.

Gleason grade 4 prostate cancer encompasses a heterogeneous group of tumor growth patterns including fused, ill-defined, cribriform, and glomeruloid glandular structures. Our objective was to determine the prognostic value of different Gleason grade 4 growth patterns. We performed a nested case-control study among 535 patients with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy, treated between March 1985 and July 2013 at a university hospital in the Netherlands. We analyzed 52 cases (with metastasis, disease-specific mortality or both) and 109 controls, matched for age, PSA level, and pT stage. Presence of the following Gleason grade 4 patterns was recorded: fused, ill-defined, cribriform, and glomeruloid. Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate and tertiary Gleason grade 5 were additionally assessed. Outcomes were metastasis-free survival and disease-specific survival. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to determine the predictive value of Gleason grade 4 patterns for survival time. The overall prevalence of Gleason grade 4 patterns was as follows: fused 75% (n=121), ill-defined 64% (n=102), cribriform 48% (n=83), and glomeruloid 25% (n=40). Cribriform pattern was the only pattern with an unequal distribution between cases and controls. Forty-two out of 52 cases (81%) had cribriform growth pattern versus 41/109 controls (38%). In multivariate analysis, presence of cribriform growth was an adverse independent predictor for distant metastasis-free survival (HR 8.0, 95% CI 3.0-21; P<0.001) and disease-specific survival (HR 5.4, 95% CI 2.0-15, P=0.001).

To identify the mechanism that drives these advanced tumors, paired-end RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on a panel of CRPC bone marrow biopsy specimens. From this genome-wide approach, mutations were found in a series of genes with prostate cancer relevance, including AR, NCOR1, KDM3A, KDM4A, CHD1, SETD5, SETD7, INPP4B, RASGRP3, RASA1, TP53BP1, and CDH1, and a novel SND1:BRAF gene fusion. Among the most highly expressed transcripts were 10 noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including MALAT1 and PABPC1, which are involved in RNA processing. Notably, a high percentage of sequence reads mapped to introns, which were determined to be the result of incomplete splicing at canonical splice junctions. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), a series of genes (AR, KLK2, KLK3, STEAP2, CPSF6, and CDK19) were confirmed to have a greater proportion of unspliced RNA in CRPC specimens than in normal prostate epithelium, untreated primary prostate cancer, and cultured prostate cancer cells.

The mechanism by which prostate cancer cells are able to survive and progress in the bone microenvironment is not clear. Identification of molecules that play critical roles in the progression of prostate cancer in bone will provide essential targets for therapy. Ribosomal S6 protein kinases (RSK) have been shown to mediate many cellular functions critical for cancer progression. Whether RSK plays a role in the progression of prostate cancer in bone is unknown. IHC analysis of human prostate cancer specimens showed increased phosphorylation of RSK in the nucleus of prostate cancer cells in a significant fraction of human prostate cancer bone metastasis specimens, compared with the primary site or lymph node metastasis. Expression of constitutively active myristylated RSK in C4-2B4 cells (C4-2B4/RSK) increased their survival and anchorage-independent growth compared with C4-2B4/vector cells. Using an orthotopic bone injection model, it was determined that injecting C4-2B4/RSK cells into mouse femurs enhanced their progression in bone compared with control cells. In PC3-mm2 cells, knockdown of RSK1 (RPS6KA1), the predominant RSK isoform, but not RSK2 (RPS6KA2) alone, decreased anchorage-independent growth in vitro and reduced tumor progression in bone and tumor-induced bone remodeling in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that RSK regulates anchorage-independent growth through transcriptional regulation of factors that modulate cell survival, including ING3, CKAP2, and PTK6. Together, these data provide strong evidence that RSK is an important driver in prostate cancer progression in bone.

Traditional short-term indicators of clinical response commonly used with chemotherapy have not correlated with survival in patients treated with sipuleucel-T. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate laboratory parameters as possible early biomarkers associated with clinical benefit following sipuleucel-T treatment. Patients treated with sipuleucel-T from three randomized, controlled, phase III clinical trials in mCRPC were considered: IMPACT (NCT00065442; n = 512), D9901 (NCT00005947; n = 127), and D9902A (NCT01133704; n = 98). Patients from these trials were included in this study if their samples were analyzed by the central laboratory and if data were available from baseline and ≥ 1 posttreatment time point (n = 377). We found that sipuleucel-T treatment was associated with a transient increase in serum eosinophil count at week 6 that resolved by week 14 in 28% of patients (105 of 377). This eosinophil increase correlated with induced immune response, longer prostate cancer-specific survival [HR, 0.713; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.525-0.970; P = 0.031], and a trend in overall survival (HR, 0.753; 95% CI, 0.563-1.008; P = 0.057). Median serum globulin protein levels also increased transiently, which was associated with antigen-specific antibody responses; however, this finding did not correlate with longer survival.

The expression levels of both chimeric RNAs vary greatly in cancer and normal cells. USP9Y-TTTY15 expression is neither higher in cancer than adjacent normal tissues, nor correlated with features of advanced prostate cancer. Although the expression level of SLC45A3-ELK4 is higher in cancer than normal cells, and a dramatic increase in its expression from normal to cancer cells is correlated with advanced disease, its expression level in cancer samples alone is not correlated with any clinical parameters.

Objective:   To evaluate spinal metastases from RCC and PC to assess the sensitivity and specificity of perfusion parameters obtained by quantitative and semiquantitative methods, which would allow for noninvasive discrimination between hypovascular and hypervascular lesions.  Summary of background data:   Conventional MRI can be inconclusive in assessing diagnostically complex spinal lesions in patients with cancer in whom fibrosis, infarction, edema related to compression fractures, and infection may simulate malignant neoplasm. Conventional MRI is also of limited value in assessing tumor vascularity and identifying hypervascular tumors. DCE-MRI offers an advantage over conventional MRI in that it provides anatomical, physiological, and hemodynamic information about neoplastic lesions.  Methods:   DCE perfusion parameters: vascular permeability, plasma volume (V(p)), wash-in slope, and peak-enhancement parameter were measured to assess their potential as discriminators of tumor vascularity. A Mann-Whitney U test (at P ≤ 0.01), was performed to quantify and compare significance of perfusion parameters between the 2 groups.  Results:   Of the 4 perfusion parameters studied, V(p) was observed to have the largest difference in mean (μ) between PC (μ = 3.29/s) and RCC metastases (μ = 5.92/s). This was followed by the peak-enhancement, vascular permeability, and wash-in parameters. A Mann-Whitney U test showed a significant difference between V(p) values for PC and RCC lesions (P ≤ 0.001). Similarly, peak-enhancement parameter showed a significant difference between the 2 histologies (P ≤ 0.001), as did vascular permeability (P ≤ 0.01). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that V(p) recorded the highest area under the curve (0.867).  Conclusion:   V(p) was shown to be the best discriminator between spinal metastases from PC and RCC with the mean V(p) of RCC metastasis being 1.8 times that of the PC lesions, thus discriminating between hyper- and hypovascular metastases, which has important clinical implications.""","""['Atin Saha', 'Kyung K Peck', 'Eric Lis', 'Andrei I Holodny', 'Yoshiya Yamada', 'Sasan Karimi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Spine (Phila Pa 1976)""","""['Characterizing hypervascular and hypovascular metastases and normal bone marrow of the spine using dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging measurements in renal cell carcinoma: effect of region of interest size and positioning on interobserver and intraobserver variability.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of osseous spine metastasis before and 1 hour after high-dose image-guided radiation therapy.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for assessing tumor vascularity and vascular effects of targeted therapies in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma.', 'Delay of Aortic Arterial Input Function Time Improves Detection of Malignant Vertebral Body Lesions on Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI Perfusion.', 'An Overview of Decision Making in the Management of Metastatic Spinal Tumors.', 'Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta for Blood Control in Lumbar Spine Tumor Resection Surgery: A Technical Note.', 'Differentiating Between Multiple Myeloma and Metastasis Subtypes of Lumbar Vertebra Lesions Using Machine Learning-Based Radiomics.', 'T1-weighted Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MRI to Differentiate Nonneoplastic and Malignant Vertebral Body Lesions in the Spine.']"""

Btk has previously been reported to be expressed primarily in B cells and has an important role in immune responses and B-cell malignancies. Etk has been shown previously to provide a strong survival and metastasis signal in human prostate cancer cells, and to confer androgen independence and drug resistance. While the role of Etk in prostate carcinogenesis is well established, the functions of Btk in prostate cancer have never been investigated, likely due to the perception that Btk is a hematopoietic, but not epithelial, kinase. Herein, we found that Btk is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cells. The level of Btk in prostate cancer tissues correlates with cancer grades. Knockdown of Btk expression selectively inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells, but not that of the normal prostate epithelial cells, which express very little Btk. Dual inhibition of Btk and Etk has an additive inhibitory effect on prostate cancer cell growth. To explore Btk and Etk as targets for prostate cancer, we developed a small molecule dual inhibitor of Btk and Etk, CTN06. Treatment of PC3 and other prostate cancer cells, but not immortalized prostate epithelial cells with CTN06 resulted in effective cell killing, accompanied by the attenuation of Btk/Etk signals. The killing effect of CTN06 is more potent than that of commonly used inhibitors against Src, Raf/VEGFR and EGFR. CTN06 induces apoptosis as well as autophagy in human prostate cancer cells, and is a chemo-sensitizer for docetaxel (DTX), a standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer patients. CTN06 also impeded the migration of human prostate cancer cells based on a 'wound healing' assay.

In the current study, we identify PSP94 as a key upstream factor in mediating prostasin (a protein previously reported to be overexpressed in ovarian cancer) signaling that regulates prostasin expression and action in ovarian cancer cells. PSP94 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer cell lines and patients, and is significantly correlated with prostasin levels. Signaling pathway analysis demonstrated that both PSP94 and prostasin, as potential upstream regulators of the Lin28b/Let-7 pathway, regulate Lin28b and its downstream partner Let-7 in ovarian cancer cells. Expression of PSP94 and prostasin show a strong correlation with the expression levels of Lin28b/Let-7 in ovarian cancer patients. Thus, PSP94/prostasin axis appears to be linked to the Lin28b/Let-7 loop, a well-known signaling mechanism in oncogenesis in general that is also altered in ovarian cancer.

It has been shown to inhibit the growth of several prostate cancer cell lines. Gap junctions, formed of proteins called connexins (Cx), are ensembles of cell-cell channels, which permit the exchange of small growth regulatory molecules between adjoining cells. Cell-cell communication mediated by gap junctional channels is an important homeostatic control mechanism for regulating cell growth and differentiation. We have investigated the effect of 1-25D on the formation and degradation of gap junctions in an androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, which expresses retrovirally-introduced Cx32. Connexin32 is expressed by the luminal and well-differentiated cells of normal prostate and prostate tumors. Our results document that 1-25D enhances the expression of Cx32 and its subsequent assembly into gap junctions. Our results further show that 1-25D prevents androgen-regulated degradation of Cx32, post-translationally, independent of androgen receptor (AR)-mediated signaling. Finally, our findings document that formation of gap junctions sensitizes Cx32-expressing LNCaP cells to the growth inhibitory effects of 1-25D and alters their morphology. These findings suggest that the growth-inhibitory effects of 1-25D in LNCaP cells may be related to its ability to modulate the assembly of Cx32 into gap junctions.""","""['Linda Kelsey', 'Parul Katoch', 'Anuttoma Ray', 'Shalini Mitra', 'Souvik Chakraborty', 'Ming-Fong Lin', 'Parmender P Mehta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Retinoids regulate the formation and degradation of gap junctions in androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen-regulated formation and degradation of gap junctions in androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cells.', 'The carboxyl tail of connexin32 regulates gap junction assembly in human prostate and pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Vitamin D and prostate cancer.', 'Gap junctions in the thyroid gland: distribution, regulation, function.', 'Direct Intercellular Communications and Cancer: A Snapshot of the Biological Roles of Connexins in Prostate Cancer.', 'Vitamin D receptor and metabolite effects on corneal epithelial cell gap junction proteins.', 'Gap Junction Intercellular Communication Positively Regulates Cisplatin Toxicity by Inducing DNA Damage through Bystander Signaling.', 'ASC Induces Apoptosis via Activation of Caspase-9 by Enhancing Gap Junction-Mediated Intercellular Communication.', 'Direct vitamin D3 actions on rhesus macaque follicles in three-dimensional culture: assessment of follicle survival, growth, steroid, and antimüllerian hormone production.']"""

MTT analysis results showed that 5 and 10 μM fucoxanthin inhibited the proliferation of T24 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner accompanied by the growth arrest at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, which is mediated by the up-regulation of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-inhibitory protein and the down-regulation of CDK-2, CDK-4, cyclin D1, and cyclin E.

Methods:   From February 2000 to April 2010, 116 patients with a metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were prospectively submitted to oral ethinylestradiol monotherapy. Inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer after failure of at least two lines of androgen deprivation therapy and radiological evidence of metastases. Exclusion criteria were: symptomatic cases with a European Cooperative Oncology Group score >2 and severe or uncontrolled cardiovascular diseases. At inclusion in the study, all patients discontinued the previous androgen deprivation therapy and started oral ethinylestradiol at the daily dose of 1 mg. Aspirin (100 mg/daily) was concomitantly given.  Results:   The median ethinylestradiol therapy duration was 15.9 months (range 8-36 months), whereas the median follow up of patients was 28 months (range 13-36 months). During ethinylestradiol therapy, a confirmed prostate-specific antigen response was found in 79 patients (70.5%). The median time to prostate-specific antigen progression was 15.10 months (95% confidence interval 13.24-18.76 months). A toxicity requiring treatment cessation was observed in 26 patients (23.2%) at a median time of 16 months (mainly thromboembolism).  Conclusions:   Our 10-year experience shows that ethinylestradiol provides a prostate-specific antigen response in a high percentage of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Cardiovascular toxicity can be managed through accurate patient selection, close follow up and a concomitant anticoagulation therapy.""","""['Alessandro Sciarra', 'Vincenzo Gentile', 'Susanna Cattarino', 'Alessandro Gentilucci', 'Andrea Alfarone', ""Giuseppe D'Eramo"", 'Stefano Salciccia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Influence of prior oral ethinylestradiol use on the efficacy of enzalutamide for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer in men.', 'Prostate-specific antigen response to deferred combined androgen blockade therapy using bicalutamide predicts survival after subsequent oestrogen and docetaxel therapies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination therapy of ethinylestradiol and somatostatin analogue reintroduces objective clinical responses and decreases chromogranin a in patients with androgen ablation refractory prostate cancer.', 'Understanding heterogeneity of treatment effect in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation of prostate cancer: Leading to a therapeutic dead end.', 'Maintaining bone health by estrogen therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer: a narrative review.', 'Association between the polygenic liabilities for prostate cancer and breast cancer with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Brain-Selective Estrogen Therapy Prevents Androgen Deprivation-Associated Hot Flushes in a Rat Model.', 'Considering bone health in the treatment of prostate cancer bone metastasis based on the results of the ERA-223 trial.', 'The resurgence of estrogens in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Placenta-specific 1 (PLAC1) is a novel cancer-testis antigen with reported ectopic expression in a variety of tumors and cancer cell lines. The purpose of the present study was to investigate for the first time the differential expression of PLAC1 in PCa tissues.  Methods:   We investigated the differential expression of PLAC1 in PCa, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HPIN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and nonneoplastic/nonhyperplastic prostate tissues using microarray-based immunohistochemistry (n = 227). The correlation of PLAC1 expression with certain clinicopathological parameters and expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), as a prostate epithelial cell differentiation marker, were investigated.  Results:   Placenta-specific 1 (PLAC1) expression was increased in a stepwise manner from BPH to PCa, which expressed highest levels of this molecule, while in a majority of normal tissues, PLAC1 expression was not detected. Moreover, PLAC1 expression was positively associated with Gleason score (p ≤ 0.001). Interestingly, there was a negative correlation between PLAC1 and PSA expression in patients with PCa and HPIN (p ≤ 0.01). Increment of PLAC1 expression increased the odds of PCa and HPIN diagnosis (OR 49.45, 95 % CI for OR 16.17-151.25).  Conclusion:   Our findings on differential expression of PLAC1 in PCa plus its positive association with Gleason score and negative correlation with PSA expression highlight the potential usefulness of PLAC1 for targeted PC therapy especially for patients with advanced disease.""","""['Roya Ghods', 'Mohammad-Hossein Ghahremani', 'Zahra Madjd', 'Mojgan Asgari', 'Maryam Abolhasani', 'Sanaz Tavasoli', 'Ahmad-Reza Mahmoudi', 'Maryam Darzi', 'Parvin Pasalar', 'Mahmood Jeddi-Tehrani', 'Amir-Hassan Zarnani']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2) expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma: a novel prostate cancer marker.', 'Expression and clinical significance of placenta-specific 1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'The relation of beclin 1 and bcl-2 expressions in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate adenocarcinoma: a tissue microarray study.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'PLAC1: biology and potential application in cancer immunotherapy.', 'Investigation of Expression Profile of Placenta-specific 1 (PLAC1) in Acute Myeloid and Lymphoid Leukemias.', 'Clinical significance of CD166 and HER-2 in different types of gastric cancer.', 'Human amniotic epithelial cells exert anti-cancer effects through secretion of immunomodulatory small extracellular vesicles (sEV).', 'Optimization of Expression and Purification of Recombinant Mouse plac1.', 'Mammalian tumor-like organs. 1.

Despite this, many patients undergo these investigations. Our aim was to determine the rate and cost of scans being performed for this group of patients.  Method:   We utilised a database of prostate cancer patients treated by a radiation oncologist specialising in prostate cancer at the Royal Adelaide Hospital between January 2008 and December 2012. Risk criteria were defined according to the D'Amico system. We identified the staging investigations ordered.  Results:   Of 236 consecutive eligible patients, 69 (70%) and 85 (86%) of 99 low risk, and 112 (82%) and 126 (92%) of 137 intermediate-risk patients, were found to have had staging CTAP and WBBS, respectively. In fact, only 9.7% of the patients followed the international best practice guidelines and had no staging investigations. None of these scans showed evidence of metastatic disease. The total costs of these investigations for the low and intermediate-risk groups were approximately AUD 75 000 and AUD 116 000, respectively.  Conclusion:   We found that there is clearly a significant overuse of staging investigations for both these groups while the incidence of metastases identified was very low. This is likely to have a significant impact on the waiting time for scans and lead to substantial waste of resources. It places unnecessary financial burden on the patients and the healthcare system.

The impetus for this research is to examine a new ultrasound-based imaging modality, vibro-acoustography (VA), which may serve to provide a high rate of PPB seed detection while also effecting enhanced prostate imaging. The authors investigate the ability of VA, implemented on a clinical ultrasound (US) scanner and equipped with a quasi-2D (Q2D) array US transducer, to detect and localize PPB seeds in excised prostate specimens.  Methods:   Nonradioactive brachytherapy seeds were implanted into four excised cadaver prostates. A clinical US scanner equipped with a Q2D array US transducer was customized to acquire both US and C-scan VA images at various depths. The VA images were then used to detect and localize the implanted seeds in prostate tissue. To validate the VA results, computed tomography (CT) images of the same tissue samples were obtained to serve as the reference by which to evaluate the performance of VA in PPB seed detection.  Results:   The results indicate that VA is capable of accurately identifying the presence and distribution of PPB seeds with a high imaging contrast. Moreover, a large ratio of the PPB seeds implanted into prostate tissue samples could be detected through acquired VA images. Using CT-based seed identification as the standard, VA was capable of detecting 74%-92% of the implanted seeds. Additionally, the angular independency of VA in detecting PPB seeds was demonstrated through a well-controlled phantom experiment.  Conclusions:   Q2DVA detected a substantial portion of the seeds by using a 2D array US transducer in excised prostate tissue specimens. While VA has inherent advantages associated with conventional US imaging, it has the additional advantage of permitting detection of PPB seeds independent of their orientation. These results suggest the potential of VA as a method for PPB imaging that ultimately may allow US-based real-time intraoperative dosimetry.""","""['Mohammad Mehrmohammadi', 'Azra Alizad', 'Randall R Kinnick', 'Brian J Davis', 'Mostafa Fatemi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['In vitro comparative study of vibro-acoustography versus pulse-echo ultrasound in imaging permanent prostate brachytherapy seeds.', 'Vibro-acoustography imaging of permanent prostate brachytherapy seeds in an excised human prostate--preliminary results and technical feasibility.', 'EM-enhanced US-based seed detection for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prostate volume measurement by transrectal ultrasound and computed tomography before and after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Recent Advances in Brachytherapy Using Radioactive Nanoparticles: An Alternative to Seed-Based Brachytherapy.']"""

The American Brachytherapy Society states that the major current limitation of intraoperative treatment planning is the inability to localize the seeds in relation to the prostate. An image-guidance system was therefore developed to localize seeds for dynamic dose calculation.  Methods:   The proposed system is based on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and mobile C-arm fluoroscopy, while using a simple fiducial with seed-like markers to compute pose from the nonencoded C-arm. Three or more fluoroscopic images and an ultrasound volume are acquired and processed by a pipeline of algorithms: (1) seed segmentation, (2) fiducial detection with pose estimation, (3) seed matching with reconstruction, and (4) fluoroscopy-to-TRUS registration.  Results:   The system was evaluated on ten phantom cases, resulting in an overall mean error of 1.3 mm. The system was also tested on 37 patients and each algorithm was evaluated. Seed segmentation resulted in a 1% false negative rate and 2% false positive rate. Fiducial detection with pose estimation resulted in a 98% detection rate. Seed matching with reconstruction had a mean error of 0.4 mm. Fluoroscopy-to-TRUS registration had a mean error of 1.3 mm. Moreover, a comparison of dose calculations between the authors' intraoperative method and an independent postoperative method shows a small difference of 7% and 2% forD90 and V100, respectively. Finally, the system demonstrated the ability to detect cold spots and required a total processing time of approximately 1 min.  Conclusions:   The proposed image-guidance system is the first practical approach to dynamic dose calculation, outperforming earlier solutions in terms of robustness, ease of use, and functional completeness.""","""['Nathanael Kuo', 'Ehsan Dehghan', 'Anton Deguet', 'Omar Y Mian', 'Yi Le', 'E Clif Burdette', 'Gabor Fichtinger', 'Jerry L Prince', 'Danny Y Song', 'Junghoon Lee']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Computing intraoperative dosimetry for prostate brachytherapy using TRUS and fluoroscopy.', 'EM-enhanced US-based seed detection for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prostate CT segmentation method based on nonrigid registration in ultrasound-guided CT-based HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prostate brachytherapy intraoperative dosimetry using a combination of radiographic seed localization with a C-arm and deformed ultrasound prostate contours.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Superior Postimplant Dosimetry Achieved Using Dynamic Intraoperative Dosimetry for Permanent Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of X-ray to MRI for post-implant dosimetry in prostate brachytherapy.', 'A deformable multimodal image registration using PET/CT and TRUS for intraoperative focal prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of PET/CT and ultrasound for disease-targeted focal prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of x ray and MRI for postimplant dosimetry in low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.']"""

This assumption needs to be tested, especially when planning margins are reduced with daily image-guidance. In this study, deformation characteristics of the prostate and seminal vesicles were determined, and the dosimetric impact on treatment plans with different PTV margins was investigated.  Methods:   Ten prostate cancer patients were retrospectively selected for the study, each with three fiducial markers implanted in the prostate. Two hundred CBCT images were registered to respective planning CT images using a B-spline-based deformable image registration (DIR) software. A manual bony anatomy-based match was first applied based on the alignment of the pelvic bones and fiducial landmarks. DIR was then performed. For each registration, deformation vector fields (DVFs) of the prostate and seminal vesicles (SVs) were quantified using deformation-volume histograms. In addition, prostate rotation was evaluated and compared with prostate deformation. For a patient demonstrating small and large prostate deformations, target coverage degradation was analyzed in each of three treatment plans with PTV margins of 10 mm (6 mm at the prostate/rectum interface), as well as 5, and 3 mm uniformly.  Results:   Deformation of the prostate was most significant in the anterior direction. Maximum prostate deformation of greater than 10, 5, and 3 mm occurred in 1%, 17%, and 76% of the cases, respectively. Based on DVF-histograms, DVF magnitudes greater than 5 and 3 mm occurred in 2% and 27% of the cases, respectively. Deformation of the SVs was most significant in the posterior direction, and it was greater than 5 and 3 mm in 7.5% and 44.9% of the cases, respectively. Prostate deformation was found to be poorly correlated with rotation. Fifty percent of the cases showed rotation with negligible deformation and 7% of the cases showed significant deformation with minimal rotation (<3°). Average differences in the D95 dose to the prostate+SVs between the planning CT and CBCT images was 0.4%±0.5%, 3.0%±2.8%, and 6.6%±6.1%, respectively, for the plans with 10/6, 5, and 3 mm margins. For the case with both a large degree of prostate deformation (≈10% of the prostate volume) and rotation (≈8°), D95 was reduced by 0.5%±0.1%, 6.8%±0.6%, and 20.9%±1.6% for 10/6, 5, and 3 mm margin plans, respectively. For the case with large prostate deformation but negligible rotation (<1°), D95 was reduced by 0.4±0.3, 3.9±1.0, and 11.5±2.5 for 10/6, 5, and 3 mm margin plans, respectively.  Conclusions:   Prostate deformation over a course of fractionated prostate radiotherapy may not be insignificant and may need to be accounted for in the planning margin design. A consequence of these results is that use of highly reduced planning margins must be viewed with caution.""","""['Essa Mayyas', 'Jinkoo Kim', 'Sanath Kumar', 'Chang Liu', 'Ning Wen', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Mohamed A Elshaikh', 'Indrin J Chetty']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Margin evaluation in the presence of deformation, rotation, and translation in prostate and entire seminal vesicle irradiation with daily marker-based setup corrections.', 'Dosimetric implications of residual seminal vesicle motion in fiducial-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Hybrid registration of prostate and seminal vesicles for image guided radiation therapy.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Target margins in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluating the impact of possible interobserver variability in CBCT-based soft-tissue matching using TCP/NTCP models for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Fast and accurate deformable contour propagation for intra-fraction adaptive magnetic resonance-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Automated treatment planning of prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy with focal boosting on a fast-rotating O-ring linac: Plan quality comparison with C-arm linacs.', 'Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.', 'A Dosimetric Comparison between Conventional Fractionated and Hypofractionated Image-guided Radiation Therapies for Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   A dose reconstruction method was used to retrospectively assess the dose distributions delivered without motion correction during volumetric modulated arc therapy fractions for 20 fractions of five prostate cancer patients who received conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. These delivered dose distributions were compared with the dose distributions which would have been delivered had DMLC tracking or gating motion correction strategies been implemented. The delivered dose distributions were constructed by incorporating the observed prostate motion with the patient's original treatment plan to simulate the treatment delivery. The DMLC tracking dose distributions were constructed using the same dose reconstruction method with the addition of MLC positions from Linac log files obtained during DMLC tracking simulations with the observed prostate motions input to the DMLC tracking software. The gating dose distributions were constructed by altering the prostate motion to simulate the application of a gating threshold of 3 mm for 5 s.  Results:   The delivered dose distributions showed that dosimetric effects of intrafraction prostate motion could be substantial for some fractions, with an estimated dose decrease of more than 19% and 34% from the planned CTVD99% and PTV D95% values, respectively, for one fraction. Evaluation of dose distributions for DMLC tracking and gating deliveries showed that both interventions were effective in improving the CTV D99% for all of the selected fractions to within 4% of planned value for all fractions. For the delivered dose distributions the difference in rectum V65% for the individual fractions from planned ranged from -44% to 101% and for the bladder V65% the range was -61% to 26% from planned. The application of tracking decreased the maximum rectum and bladder V65% difference to 6% and 4%, respectively.  Conclusions:   For the first time, the dosimetric impact of DMLC tracking and gating to account for intrafraction motion during prostate radiotherapy has been assessed and compared with no motion correction. Without motion correction intrafraction prostate motion can result in a significant decrease in target dose coverage for a small number of individual fractions. This is unlikely to effect the overall treatment for most patients undergoing conventionally fractionated treatments.

The anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) is a protein disulfide isomerase and is highly expressed in various human cancers, such as breast, prostate and pancreas cancers. AGR2 is expressed in normal cholangiocytes and its expression is maintained during biliary carcinogenesis. However, the clinical significance of AGR2 expression in biliary tract cancer has not yet been assessed. Thus, we examined the expression of AGR2 protein in biliary tract tumors using immunohistochemistry and its association with various clinicopathologic parameters. This study included 100 patients who underwent surgery for biliary tract cancers: 46 men and 54 women with a mean and median age of 64.2 and 65.0 years, respectively. AGR2 expression was detected in ductal epithelial cells of the normal biliary tract and in 95% of biliary tract cancer tissues. While the AGR2 expression was not associated with cancer location, patient age, patient sex, degree of regional lymph node metastasis (N-status), or residual status, the AGR2 expression level was decreased with increased tumor size (T-status, p = 0.006) and progression of tumor stage (p = 0.009). Moreover, well-differentiated cancers tended to show higher AGR2 expression than poorly differentiated cancers (p = 0.068); in fact, AGR2 expression was not associated with patient survival (Kaplan-Meier analysis, p = 0.415). Thus, AGR2 is of limited value as a prognostic marker for biliary tract cancer.

Current methods of treatment and diagnosis are not specific for the disease. This work identified an antibody fragment that binds selectively to a molecule on the surface of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells but not benign prostatic cells.  Results:   Antibody fragment identification was achieved using a library screening and enrichment strategy. A library of 109 yeast-displayed human non-immune antibody fragments was enriched for those that bind to androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, but not to benign prostatic cells or purified prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Seven rounds of panning and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) screening yielded one antibody fragment identified from the enriched library. This molecule, termed HiR7.8, has a low-nanomolar equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and high specificity for androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Antibody fragment screening from a yeast-displayed library has yielded one molecule with high affinity and specificity. With further pre-clinical development, it is hoped that the antibody fragment identified using this screening strategy will be useful in the specific detection of prostate cancer and in targeted delivery of therapeutic agents for increased efficacy and reduced side effects.""","""['Ryan M Williams', 'Cyrus J Hajiran', 'Sara Nayeem', 'Letha J Sooter']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Biotechnol""","""['Selection of Single Chain Antibody Fragments for Targeting Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen: A Comparison Between Cell-based and Antigen-based Approach.', 'A novel anti-PSMA human scFv has the potential to be used as a diagnostic tool in prostate cancer.', 'A new generation of monoclonal and recombinant antibodies against cell-adherent prostate specific membrane antigen for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting of prostate cancer.', 'Current evaluation of the tissue localization and diagnostic utility of prostate specific membrane antigen.', 'Targeted systemic therapy of prostate cancer with a monoclonal antibody to prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Antibody Library Screening Using Yeast Biopanning and Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting.', 'Magnetic Bead-Immobilized Mammalian Cells Are Effective Targets to Enrich Ligand-Displaying Yeast.', 'Ligand Engineering via Yeast Surface Display and Adherent Cell Panning.', 'Reduced pim-1 expression increases chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by inducing apoptosis.', 'Noninvasive ovarian cancer biomarker detection via an optical nanosensor implant.']"""

Taxane-based anticancer treatments lead to the stabilization of microtubules, thus preventing the uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells. One of the striking physical features of taxane-treated cells is the localization of their microtubules, which can be observed via fluorescent microscopy as an intense fluorescent band and are referred to as a microtubule bundle. With the recent advances in capturing and analyzing tumor cells circulating in a patient's blood system, there is increasing interest in using these cells to examine a patient's response to treatment. This includes taxanes that are used routinely in clinics to treat prostate, breast, lung, and other cancers. Here, we have used a computational model of microtubule mechanics to investigate self-arrangement patterns of stabilized microtubules, which allowed for the identification of specific combinations of three physical parameters: microtubule stiffness, intracellular viscosity, and cell shape, that can prevent the formation of microtubule bundles in cells with stabilized microtubules, such as taxane-treated cells. We also developed a method to quantify bundling in the whole microtubule aster structure and a way to compare the simulated results to fluorescent images from experimental data. Moreover, we investigated microtubule rearrangement in both suspended and attached cells and showed that the observed final microtubule patterns depend on the experimental protocol. The results from our computational studies can explain the heterogeneous bundling phenomena observed via fluorescent immunostaining from a mechanical point of view without relying on heterogeneous cellular responses to the microtubule-stabilizing drug.""","""['MunJu Kim', 'Katarzyna A Rejniak']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biophys J""","""['Taxane-induced blockade to nuclear accumulation of the androgen receptor predicts clinical responses in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy of a Covalent Microtubule Stabilizer in Taxane-Resistant Ovarian Cancer Models.', 'FASN Inhibition and Taxane Treatment Combine to Enhance Anti-tumor Efficacy in Diverse Xenograft Tumor Models through Disruption of Tubulin Palmitoylation and Microtubule Organization and FASN Inhibition-Mediated Effects on Oncogenic Signaling and Gene Expression.', 'Microtubule active agents: beyond the taxane frontier.', 'Telling cells how to die: docetaxel therapy in cancer cell lines.', 'Mechanisms of Taxane Resistance.', 'Quantitative analysis of taxane drug target engagement of microtubules in circulating tumor cells from metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients treated with CRXL301, a nanoparticle of docetaxel.', 'High-throughput cell mechanical phenotyping for label-free titration assays of cytoskeletal modifications.', 'Geometrical and mechanical properties control actin filament organization.']"""

Creating a fused predictor from high-dimensional data streams is challenging because the classifier must 1) account for the ""curse of dimensionality"" problem, which hinders classifier performance when the number of features exceeds the number of patient studies and 2) balance potential mismatches in the number of features across different channels to avoid classifier bias towards channels with more features. Our new data integration methodology, supervised Multi-view Canonical Correlation Analysis (sMVCCA), aims to integrate infinite views of highdimensional data to provide more amenable data representations for disease classification. Additionally, we demonstrate sMVCCA using Spearman's rank correlation which, unlike Pearson's correlation, can account for nonlinear correlations and outliers. Forty CaP patients with pathological Gleason scores 6-8 were considered for this study. 21 of these men revealed biochemical recurrence (BCR) following RP, while 19 did not. For each patient, 189 quantitative histomorphometric attributes and 650 protein expression levels were extracted from the primary tumor nodule. The fused histomorphometric/proteomic representation via sMVCCA combined with a random forest classifier predicted BCR with a mean AUC of 0.74 and a maximum AUC of 0.9286. We found sMVCCA to perform statistically significantly (p < 0.05) better than comparative state-of-the-art data fusion strategies for predicting BCR.

Atraric acid (AA) inhibits the transactivation of the androgen receptor (AR) and androgen-mediated growth of AR-expressing human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines. Here we show that AA treatment of living cells provokes molecular changes of AR signaling. In addition to a deceleration of nuclear translocation a block of the intramolecular amino/carboxy (N/C)-terminal interaction of the AR was observed. Furthermore, using high-resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy, a reduced speckle formation of the AR was observed in line with an increased intranuclear mobility of the receptor. This suggests decreased DNA binding of the AR, which is further indicated by an impaired chromatin recruitment of the AR to the prostate-specific antigen promoter and enhancer shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Using inhibitors of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src or Akt, known interaction partners of AR, reduced the level of androgen-induced cellular senescence suggesting a partly non-genomic pathway to induce cellular senescence by AA. Using PP2 (4-Amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) pyrimidine or Akt inhibitors, inhibitors of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src or Akt, known interaction partners of AR, reduced the level of androgen-induced cellular senescence, suggesting a partly nongenomic pathway to induce cellular senescence by AA. Treatment of LNCaP cells with AA is associated with hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor and an increase of p16 expression, whereas the p53-p21 signaling pathway seems not be affected by AA treatment. Analyzing human PCa tissue samples treated with AA ex vivo also indicates an induction of cellular senescence associated with an increase of p16 expression but not p21. Taken together, these data indicate that AA exhibits novel features to inhibit AR amino/carboxy-terminal interaction, the AR-mediated nuclear activities and growth of PCa cells.""","""['Wiebke Hessenkemper', 'Julia Roediger', 'Sophie Bartsch', 'Adriaan B Houtsmuller', 'Martin E van Royen', 'Iver Petersen', 'Marc-Oliver Grimm', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['The tumor suppressor ING1b is a novel corepressor for the androgen receptor and induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3beta/AR signaling network by isoflavone in prostate cancer cells.', 'A novel crosstalk between the tumor suppressors ING1 and ING2 regulates androgen receptor signaling.', 'Oncogenic activation of androgen receptor.', 'Mechanisms of Androgen Receptor Agonist- and Antagonist-Mediated Cellular Senescence in Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Activation Induces Senescence in Thyroid Cancer Cells.', 'Isolation of Bioactive Metabolites from Soil Derived Fungus-Aspergillus fumigatus.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Ectopic JAK-STAT activation enables the transition to a stem-like and multilineage state conferring AR-targeted therapy resistance.', 'Androgen-Induced MIG6 Regulates Phosphorylation of Retinoblastoma Protein and AKT to Counteract Non-Genomic AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Methods:   Data were extracted from the National Cancer Registry Ireland, for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1998-2009 (N = 26,183). A series of multivariate Cox and logistic regression models were used to examine the role of healthcare provider and socio-economic status (area-based deprivation) on survival, controlling for age, stage, Gleason grade, marital status and region of residence. Survival was based on all-cause mortality.  Results:   Older individuals who were treated in a private care setting were more likely to have survived than those who had not, when other factors were controlled for. Differences were evident with respect to marital status, region of residence, clinical stage and Gleason grade. The effect of socio-economic status was modified by healthcare provider, such that risk of death was higher in those men of lower socio-economic status treated by public, but not private providers in the Cox models. The logistic models revealed a socio-economic gradient in risk of death overall; the gradient was larger for those treated by public providers compared to those treated by private providers when controlling for a range of other confounding factors.  Conclusion:   The role of healthcare provider and socio-economic status in survival of men with prostate cancer may give rise to concerns that warrant further investigation.""","""['Richéal M Burns', 'Linda Sharp', 'Francis J Sullivan', 'Sandra E Deady', 'Frances J Drummond', 'Ciaran O Neill']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Socio-economic inequalities in survival of patients with prostate cancer: role of age and Gleason grade at diagnosis.', 'Characteristics of cases with unknown stage prostate cancer in a population-based cancer registry.', 'Factors associated with initial treatment and survival for clinically localized prostate cancer: results from the CDC-NPCR Patterns of Care Study (PoC1).', 'Adenocarcinoma of the prostate in Iceland: a population-based study of stage, Gleason grade, treatment and long-term survival in males diagnosed between 1983 and 1987.', 'Prostate brachytherapy: a descriptive analysis from CaPSURE.', 'Emerging cancer incidence, mortality, hospitalisation and associated burden among Australian cancer patients, 1982 - 2014: an incidence-based approach in terms of trends, determinants and inequality.', 'The association of marital status and mortality among men with early-stage prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: insight into post-prostatectomy survival strategies.', 'Geographical Variations in Prostate Cancer Outcomes: A Systematic Review of International Evidence.', 'Incongruence in treatment decision making is associated with lower health-related quality of life among prostate cancer survivors: results from the PiCTure study.', ""Affluence and Private Health Insurance Influence Treatment and Survival in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.""]"""

Materials and methods:   Between September 2008 and March 2011, 30 men with biochemical failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer provided written informed consent and were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial approved by the institutional research ethics board. An integrated diagnostic MR imaging and interventional biopsy procedure was performed with a 1.5-T MR imager by using a prototype table and stereotactic transperineal template. Multiparametric MR imaging (T2-weighted, dynamic contrast material-enhanced, and diffusion-weighted sequences) was followed by targeted biopsy of suspicious regions and systematic sextant sampling. Biopsy needle locations were imaged and registered to diagnostic images. Two observers blinded to clinical data and the results of prior imaging studies delineated tumor boundaries. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) was calculated based on generalized linear models by using biopsy as the reference standard to distinguish benign from malignant lesions.  Results:   Twenty-eight patients were analyzed. Most patients (n = 22) had local recurrence, with 82% (18 of 22) having unifocal disease. When multiparametric volumes from two observers were combined, it increased the apparent overall tumor volume by 30%; however, volumes remained small (mean, 2.9 mL; range, 0.5-8.3 mL). Tumor target boundaries differed between T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and diffusion-weighted sequences (mean Dice coefficient, 0.13-0.35). Diagnostic accuracy in the identification of tumors improved with a multiparametric approach versus a strictly T2-weighted or dynamic contrast-enhanced approach through an improvement in sensitivity (observer 1, 0.65 vs 0.35 and 0.44, respectively; observer 2, 0.82 vs 0.64 and 0.53, respectively; P < .05) and improved further with a 5-mm expansion margin (Az = 0.85 vs 0.91 for observer 2). After excluding three patients with fewer than six informative biopsy cores and six patients with inadequately stained margins, MR-guided biopsy enabled more accurate delineation of the tumor target volume be means of exclusion of false-positive results in 26% (five of 19 patients), false-negative results in 11% (two of 19 patients) and by guiding extension of tumor boundaries in 16% (three of 19 patients).

This process is critical to cell migration in normal and pathological conditions. In the present study, the function of c-Met in the process of EMT was investigated in prostate cancer. Initially, a c-Met stable expression cell line was constructed using EMT- and c-Met-negative LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Following the identification of c-Met in the transfected cells, the changes in EMT, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway biomarkers were determined by western blot analysis. MTT, soft agar and Transwell assays, and xenograft studies were used to investigate the effects of c-Met on the proliferation, migration and tumorigenicity of LNCaP cells. The results of the present study revealed downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in LNCaP-Met cells.

Furthermore, these EMT-like changes were mediated via the PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.

Patients and methods:   From January 2011 to January 2013, a cohort of 150 consecutive male patients who underwent first prostate biopsy were enrolled. Twelve-core needle biopsy was performed as standard procedure, while twelve more needle tissue cores matched with the previous group were also collected for glutathione determination. After definitive diagnosis, measurement of glutathione was performed in the correspondent one matched prostatic sample where PCa or BPH were identified. A day after the prostatic biopsy, body composition was estimated by air plethysmography (BOD POD®).  Results:   A significant difference of TTG was observed in BPH and PCa patients; 34 nanomole (nmol) reagent sulfihydrylc (RSH)/ mg protein vs. 1.1 nmol RSH/ mg protein respectively (p<0.05). In BPH patients, a negative correlation was found between TTG and age (r=-0.46; p<0.05), while, in PCa patients, a positive correlation was observed between TTG and fat mass (FM) (r=0.76; p<0.01) and waist circumference (WC) (r=0.49; p<0.05). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed TTG to be negatively associated with age (β-coefficient=-0.4; p<0.05) in BPH patients and positively with FM (β-coefficient=3.4; p<0.01) and WC (β-coefficient=2.7; p<0.05) in PCa patients.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in cancer progression and metastasis. Recent evidence suggested that diabetic patients treated with metformin have lower PCa risk and better prognosis. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on EMT in PCa cells and the possible microRNA (miRNA)-based mechanisms. MiRNAs have been shown to regulate various processes of cancer metastasis. We herein showed that metformin significantly inhibits proliferation of Vcap and PC-3 cells, induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibits invasiveness and motility capacity of Vcap cells. Metformin could inhibit TGF-β-induced EMT in Vcap cells, as manifested by inhibition of the increase of N-cadherin (p=0.013), Vimentin (p=0.002) and the decrease of E-cadherin (p=0.0023) and β-catenin (p=0.034) at mRNA and protein levels. Notably, we demonstrated significant upregulation of miR30a levels by metformin (P<0.05) and further experiments indicated that miR30a significantly inhibits proliferation and EMT process of Vcap cells. Interestingly, we identified that SOX4, a previously reported oncogenic transcriptional factor and modulator of EMT, is a direct target gene of miR30a. Finally, we screened the expression of miR30a and SOX4 in 84 PCa cases with radical prostatectomy. Of note, SOX4 overexpression is significantly associated with decreased levels of miR30a in PCa cases. In all, our study suggested that inhibition of EMT by metformin in PCa cells may involve upregulation of miR30a and downregulation of SOX4.""","""['Jing Zhang', 'Chengwu Shen', 'Lin Wang', 'Quanping Ma', 'Pingtian Xia', 'Mei Qi', 'Muyi Yang', 'Bo Han']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'SOX4 is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro.', 'ERG-SOX4 interaction promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells.', 'Epithelial mesenchymal transition and resistance in endocrine-related cancers.', 'SOX4: Joining the Master Regulators of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition?', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Action Mechanism of Metformin and Its Application in Hematological Malignancy Treatments: A Review.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Metformin inhibits the development and metastasis of colorectal cancer.', 'Metformin suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer by inactivating the NF-κB signaling pathway.']"""

Metformin was treated as a time-dependent variable. Of the patients studied, 209,269 were never-users and 186,212 were ever-users. A time-dependent approach was used to calculate prostate cancer incidence and estimate hazard ratios using Cox regression for ever-users, never-users and subgroups of metformin exposure (tertiles of cumulative duration and cumulative dose). Sensitivity analyses were conducted in various subgroups, using time-dependent and non-time-dependent approaches.  Results:   During the follow-up, 2776 metformin ever-users and 9642 never-users developed prostate cancer, representing an incidence of 239.42 and 737.10 per 100,000 person-years, respectively.

We investigated the potential of 22RV1 prostate cancer cells to convert the supplemented steroid precursors within this pathway under the effects of current clinical steroidogenesis inhibitors such as abiraterone and dutasteride, either alone or in combination. Under steroid starved conditions, enzymes responsible for de novo steroidogenesis were upregulated. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were formed by using both dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and progesterone as substrates. Formation of testosterone and DHT was higher following incubation with DHEA compared to progesterone. Progesterone decreased the mRNA expression of enzymes responsible for steroidogenesis. Abiraterone treatment decreased testosterone production but increased several precursor steroids in both classical and backdoor pathways in the presence of progesterone. In contrast, the DHT levels were elevated following treatment with abiraterone when progesterone was absent. Dutasteride decreased the formation of testosterone, DHT and precursor steroids in the backdoor pathway but increased steroid precursors in the classical steroidogenesis pathway. The combination of abiraterone and dutasteride decreased testosterone and DHT in the presence of progesterone but increased DHT in the absence of progesterone. Abiraterone inhibited androgen receptor (AR) activation but not to the same extent as MDV3100. However, abiraterone and dutasteride treatment, either alone or in combination, were more effective in decreasing prostate specific antigen secretion into the media than MDV3100. Thus, while interventions with these drugs alone or in combination fail to completely inhibit steroidogenesis in the 22RV1 cells, the combined inhibition of androgen production and blockade of AR can exceed the effect of MDV3100. Further characterization of bypass mechanisms that may develop as a response to these inhibitors is necessary to achieve optimal suppression of testosterone and DHT synthesis as a part of therapeutic regimens for the treatment of CRPC.""","""['Steven Pham', 'Subrata Deb', 'Dong Sheng Ming', 'Hans Adomat', 'Elham Hosseini-Beheshti', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Martin Gleave', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Intratumoral de novo steroid synthesis activates androgen receptor in castration-resistant prostate cancer and is upregulated by treatment with CYP17A1 inhibitors.', 'Resistance to CYP17A1 inhibition with abiraterone in castration-resistant prostate cancer: induction of steroidogenesis and androgen receptor splice variants.', 'Abiraterone switches castration-resistant prostate cancer dependency from adrenal androgens towards androgen receptor variants and glucocorticoid receptor signalling.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in prostate cancer pathogenesis and response to therapy.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Research Models of Prostate Cancer: A Brief Overview.', 'Steroidogenesis in Peripheral and Transition Zones of Human Prostate Cancer Tissue.', 'New inhibitor targeting Acyl-CoA synthetase 4 reduces breast and prostate tumor growth, therapeutic resistance and steroidogenesis.', 'Characterization of Precursor-Dependent Steroidogenesis in Human Prostate Cancer Models.', 'Prostate-Associated Gene 4 (PAGE4): Leveraging the Conformational Dynamics of a Dancing Protein Cloud as a Therapeutic Target.']"""

Two members of this family have been identified: Lin28A and Lin28B, which are encoded by genes localized in different chromosomes but share a high degree of sequence identity. The role of Lin28B in androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) is not well understood. Lin28B is expressed in all grades of prostatic carcinomas and prostate cancer cell lines, but not in normal prostate tissue. In this study we found that Lin28B co-localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the DU145 AIPC. The expression of Lin28B protein positively correlated with the expression of the c-Myc protein in the prostate cancer cell lines and silencing of Lin28B also correlated with a lower expression of the c-Myc protein, but not with the downregulation of c-Myc messenger RNA (mRNA) in the DU145 AIPC cells. We hypothesized that Lin28B regul-ates the expression of c-Myc protein by altering intermediate c-Myc suppressors. Therefore, a microRNA profile of DU145 cells was performed after Lin28B siRNA silencing. Nineteen microRNAs were upregulated and eleven microRNAs were downregulated. The most upregulated microRNAs were miR-212 and miR-2278. Prior reports have found that miR-212 is suppressed in prostate cancer. We then ran TargetScan software to find potential target mRNAs of miR-212 and miR-2278, and it predicted Lin28B mRNA as a potential target of miR-212, but not miR-2278. TargetScan also predicted that c-Myc mRNA is not a potential target of miR-212 or miR-2278. These observations suggest that Lin28B:miR-212 may work as a regulatory loop in androgen-independent prostate cancer. Furthermore, we report a predictive 2-fold symmetric model generated by the superposition of the Lin28A structure onto the I-TASSER model of Lin28B. This structural model of Lin28B suggests that it shows unique microRNA binding characteristics. Thus, if Lin28B were to bind miRNAs in a manner similar to Lin28A, conformational changes would be necessary to prevent steric clashes in the C-terminal and linker regions between the CSD and ZNF domains.""","""['Emma Borrego-Diaz', 'Benjamin C Powers', 'Vugar Azizov', 'Scott Lovell', 'Ruben Reyes', 'Bradley Chapman', 'Ossama Tawfik', 'Douglas McGregor', 'Francisco J Diaz', 'Xinkun Wang', 'Peter Van Veldhuizen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['MicroRNA-27a-5p regulation by promoter methylation and MYC signaling in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Down-regulation of miR-200b-3p by low p73 contributes to the androgen-independence of prostate cancer cells.', 'Changes in hypothalamic expression of the Lin28/let-7 system and related microRNAs during postnatal maturation and after experimental manipulations of puberty.', 'Aberrant regulation of the LIN28A/LIN28B and let-7 loop in human malignant tumors and its effects on the hallmarks of cancer.', 'LIN28/LIN28B: an emerging oncogenic driver in cancer stem cells.', 'Circ_0004491 stimulates guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha subunit to inhibit the malignant progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma by sponging miR-2278.', 'Lin28 Regulates Cancer Cell Stemness for Tumour Progression.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway in prostate cancer and associated drug resistance.', 'MicroRNAs in treatment-induced neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'Tribbles-1 Expression and Its Function to Control Inflammatory Cytokines, Including Interleukin-8 Levels are Regulated by miRNAs in Macrophages and Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Five distinct social networks were defined using information regarding number and intensity of social contacts: traditional-family (reference category), friends and neighbors, narrow-family, diverse, and attenuated. Cancer was ascertained through the Israel Cancer Registry, and mortality through the Population Registry after 20 years of follow-up.  Results:   The final study population included 676 participants diagnosed with cancer after 1985. Persons in the diverse network showed a lower risk of death (HR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.98) after adjusting for age, sex, smoking and self-assessed health. On the other hand, poor self-rated health at baseline (HR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.10-1.74 poor vs. all other categories of self-assessed health) was associated with increased risk of death. After excluding cancers amenable to early detection (breast, prostate, and colon) a borderline significant decreased risk of death following a diagnosis of cancer (HR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.52-1.01) was found.

The microRNA miR-145 functions as a tumor suppressor in PCa. We speculate that reciprocal regulation of PCGEM1 and miR-145 promote proliferation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, the interaction between PCGEM1 and miR-145 was examined using a luciferase reporter assay. Expression levels were selectively altered in LNCaP cells and noncancerous RWPE-1 prostate cells by transfection of miR-145 or small interfering RNA sequences against (siRNA) PCGEM1. Relative expression levels were detected by RT-PCR, tumor cell growth and early apoptosis by the MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively, and tumor cell migration and invasion properties by transwell assays. The effect of siRNA PCGEM1 and miR-145 transfection on prostate cancer growth in vivo was examined in the (nu/nu) mouse model. PCGEM1 and miR-145 exhibited reciprocal regulation; downregulation of PCGEM1 expression in LNCaP cells increased expression of miR-145, while overexpression of miR-145 decreased PCGEM1 expression. Transfection of the miR-145 expression vector and siRNA PCGEM1 inhibited tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induced early apoptosis both in vitro. In contrast, there was no effect on RWPE-1 cells.

Molecular mechanisms that account for the increased predilection of PCa for bone include increased bone turnover, promotion of PCa cell growth and survival in the bone environment, and recruitment of bystander dormant cells to participate in bone metastasis. The current study tests the hypothesis that PCa cells acquire high adhesion to bone matrix proteins, which controls PCa bone colonization, under the RANKL/RANK and AR axes.  Methods:   We used a highly bone metastatic RANKL-overexpressing LNCaP PCa cell line, LNCaP(RANKL), as a model to pursue the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased adhesion of PCa cells to collagens. A three-dimensional (3-D) suspension PCa organoid model was developed. The functions of integrin α2 in cell adhesion and survival were evaluated by flow cytometry and western blot. AR expression and functionality were compared in 2-D monolayer versus 3-D suspension cultures using AR promoter- and PSA promoter-luciferase activity. AR role in cell adhesion was assessed using an adhesion assay.  Results:   LNCaP(RANKL) cells were shown to adhere tightly to ColI matrix through increased α2 integrin expression. This increased adhesion, concomitant with activation of the FAK and Akt pathways, was further enhanced by culturing LNCaP(RANKL) cells in 3-D suspension. Under the influence of 3-D suspension culture, AR was restored in LNCaP(RANKL) cells via downregulation of AP-4 transcription factor, and supported increased α2 integrin expression and adhesion to ColI.  Conclusion:   3-D suspension culture and in vivo PCa tumor growth restore AR through downregulation of AP-4, enhancing integrin α2 expression and adhesion to ColI which is rich in bone matrices. The interactions of PCa with ColI, mediated by integrin α2 and AR expression, could be a key molecular event accounting for PCa bone metastasis.""","""['Shabnam Ziaee', 'Leland W K Chung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand induces cell adhesion and integrin α2 expression via NF-κB in head and neck cancers.', 'RANK- and c-Met-mediated signal network promotes prostate cancer metastatic colonization.', 'Differential expression of integrin subunits in DU-145/AR prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular mechanisms of metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer and bone: clinical presentation and molecular mechanisms.', 'The role of integrin family in bone metabolism and tumor bone metastasis.', 'IC50: an unsuitable measure for large-sized prostate cancer spheroids in drug sensitivity evaluation.', 'E-Cadherin, Integrin Alpha2 (Cd49b), and Transferrin Receptor-1 (Tfr1) Are Promising Immunohistochemical Markers of Selected Adverse Pathological Features in Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy.', 'AKT in Bone Metastasis of Solid Tumors: A Comprehensive Review.', '3D Co-culture System of Mouse Prostatic Wild-type Fibroblasts withHuman Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.']"""

In our approach, independent co-expression networks from normal and cancerous stages are reconstructed using a reverse engineering approach. We then highlight crucial pathways, biological processes, and genes involved in the prostate cancer by analyzing each network individually and in concert. Thus, we have identified 18 critical pathways and processes related to prostate cancer, many of which have previously been shown to be involved in cancer.

In this study, we investigated the effect and action mechanism of metformin on the function of androgen receptor (AR), a key molecule in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Metformin was found to reduce androgen-dependent cell growth and the expression of AR target genes by inhibiting AR function in prostate cancer cells such as LNCaP and C4-2 cells. Interestingly, metformin upregulated the protein level of small heterodimer partner-interacting leucine zipper (SMILE), a coregulator of nuclear receptors, and knockdown of SMILE expression with shRNA abolished the inhibitory effect of metformin on AR function. Further studies revealed that SMILE protein itself suppressed the transactivation of AR, and its ectopic expression resulted in the repressed expression of endogenous AR target genes, PSA and NKX3.1, in LNCaP cells. In addition, SMILE protein physically interacted with AR and competed with the AR coactivator SRC-1 to modulate AR transactivation. As expected, SMILE repressed androgen-dependent growth of LNCaP and C4-2 cells.

Nevertheless, the catabolic effects of ADT result in meaningful adverse effects on physiological and quality of life outcomes, which may, in turn, increase the risk of functional decline, frailty, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. Recent evidence demonstrates that lifestyle intervention promoting change in exercise and dietary behaviors is a promising approach, and may offset, or even reverse, the adverse effects accompanying ADT. Unfortunately, the limited existing studies of the effects of exercise and dietary interventions targeting patients with prostate cancer on ADT are characterized by high attrition rates and poor postintervention maintenance of treatment effects. Consequently, the Individualized Diet and Exercise Adherence Pilot Trial (IDEA-P) is designed to contrast the effects of a lifestyle intervention designed to promote independent self-management of exercise and dietary behavior with those of standard care disease management approach in the treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods/design:   A total of 40 patients with prostate cancer undergoing ADT will be randomly assigned to lifestyle intervention or standard care. Outcomes of interest in IDEA-P include changes in self-reported and objectively assessed physical function and physical activity, dietary behavior, body composition, muscular strength, and quality of life. Outcomes will be obtained at baseline, 2-month, and 3-month assessments by trial personnel blinded to participants' randomization assignment.  Discussion:   Findings from this study will establish the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an innovative lifestyle intervention designed to promote progressively independent self-regulated exercise and dietary behavior change in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer undergoing ADT.

We divided our biopsy population into three groups according to their history of DM, and their Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level: a no-DM (DM-) group; a good glycemic control (DM+GC) group (HbA1c <6.5%); and a poor glycemic control (DM+PC) group (HbA1c ≥6.5%). For sub-analyses, the DM+PC group was divided into a moderately poor glycemic control (DM+mPC) group (6.5≤ HbA1c <7.5%) and a severely poor glycemic control (DM+sPC) group (HbA1c ≥7.5%).  Results:   Among 1,368 men, 338 (24.7%) had a history of DM, and 393 (28.7%) had a positive biopsy.

Conflicting results have been obtained. Moreover, most such studies could not discriminate heterozygous from homozygous carriers of the non-deleted alleles.  Objective:   We investigated whether copy number variation (CNV) of the GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 genes contribute to the risk of prostate cancer in the Caribbean population of African descent of Guadeloupe.  Methods:   In a population-based case-control study, we compared 629 prostate cancer patients and 622 control subjects. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Exact copy numbers of GSTM1 and GSTT1 were determined by real-time PCR.  Results:   A higher copy number of GSTM1 was marginally associated with prostate cancer risk.

We hypothesized that individual practice variability would be minimal among urologists practicing at a high volume academic center.  Materials and methods:   We assessed the percent of patients at low risk treated with radical prostatectomy in a given year and comorbidity adjusted life expectancy in an institutional database accounting for temporal trends and disease characteristics. Multivariable linear, spline and logistic models were applied with a hierarchical random effects model to estimate the proportion of variance due to surgeon and temporal effects.  Results:   Of the 20,655 men included in study 11,873 (57.5%) had low risk disease. The Gleason score leading to radical prostatectomy increased with time. Overall the percent of patients at low risk treated with prostatectomy in a given year increased 3.49% yearly from 1991 to 2001 and then decreased by 1.73% yearly from 2001 to 2013. Greater surgeon experience was associated with a higher percent of patients at low risk treated with prostatectomy in a given year from 1991 to 2001 (0.46% per year of experience). High volume surgeons (total more than 1,000 radical prostatectomies) operated on a slightly greater percent of patients at low risk (3.54%). Substantial practice variation existed among surgeons for operating on men 65 years old or older at low risk (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.62-6.11). There was similar variation when operating on older patients with a life expectancy of less than 15 years. Surgeon level and temporal effects explained 24% and 70%, respectively, of the variance in the percent of patients at low risk treated with radical prostatectomy in a given year.  Conclusions:   At a high volume academic center substantial practice variation exists among surgeons when selecting patients with prostate cancer to undergo radical prostatectomy based on risk and life expectancy even among older patients. In addition to patient decision support tools, publicly reporting individual practice patterns at the provider level could decrease the overtreatment of low risk prostate cancer.""","""['Hiten D Patel', 'Elizabeth Humphreys', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Misop Han', 'H Ballentine Carter']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['The effect of minimally invasive prostatectomy on practice patterns of American urologists.', 'Role of surgeon volume in radical prostatectomy outcomes.', 'Association between hospital and surgeon radical prostatectomy volume and patient outcomes: a systematic review.', 'UK radical prostatectomy outcomes and surgeon case volume: based on an analysis of the British Association of Urological Surgeons Complex Operations Database.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Adverse Pathologic Findings for Men Electing Immediate Radical Prostatectomy: Defining a Favorable Intermediate-Risk Group.', 'Morbidity of urologic surgical procedures: an analysis of rates, risk factors, and outcomes.']"""

It is also relatively unknown whether there has been increased uptake of observational strategies for disease management. We assessed the temporal trend in observation of clinically localized prostate cancer, particularly in men with low risk disease, who were young and healthy enough to undergo treatment.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study using the SEER-Medicare database in 66,499 men with localized prostate cancer between 2004 and 2009. The main study outcome was observation within 1 year after diagnosis. We performed multivariable analysis to develop a predictive model of observation adjusting for diagnosis year, age, risk and comorbidity.  Results:   Observation was performed in 12,007 men (18%) with a slight increase with time from 17% to 20%. However, there was marked increase in observation from 18% in 2004 to 29% in 2009 in men with low risk disease. Men 66 to 69 years old with low risk disease and no comorbidities had twice the odds of undergoing observation in 2009 vs 2004 (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.73-2.59). Age, risk group, comorbidity and race were independent predictors of observation (each p <0.001), in addition to diagnosis year.  Conclusions:   We identified increasing use of observation for low risk prostate cancer between 2004 and 2009 even in men young and healthy enough for treatment.

We studied the effect of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors on biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   The study was comprised of 4,752 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer treated with bilateral nerve sparing radical prostatectomy between January 2000 and December 2010. Of these patients 1,110 (23.4%) received phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors postoperatively while 3,642 (76.6%) did not. The risk of biochemical recurrence was compared between the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor group and the nonphosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor group. Cox multivariate proportional hazard models and confidence intervals were used to estimate the hazard ratio of biochemical recurrence associated with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use. Propensity score matched analysis was performed.  Results:   Median followup was 60.3 months (IQR 36.7-84.5). Five-year biochemical recurrence-free survival estimates in the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor vs nonphosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor groups were 84.7% (95% CI 82.1-87.0) and 89.2% (95% CI 88.1-90.3), respectively (p=0.0006). Multivariate regression analysis showed that phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use was an independent risk factor for biochemical recurrence (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.11-1.70, p=0.0035) and this was also true after propensity score matching.

Results:   Of 58 patients, 29%, 52% and 19% had low (L), intermediate (I), or high (H) NCCN risk disease, respectively. K(trans) significantly correlated with PSA. For central tumours, K(trans) significantly correlated with MTD and PSA, and Kep significantly correlated with PSA. For peripheral tumours, iAUC was significantly different when stratified by L/I/H risk and GS, and ADC score with L/I/H risk, GS, and clinical T stage.

Experimental design:   Recombinant antibody microarrays were applied for protein expression profiling of 80 plasma samples from routine PSA-measurements, a priori divided into four risk groups, based on levels of total and %free PSA.  Results:   The results demonstrated that plasma protein profiles could be identified that pin-pointed PC (a malignant biomarker signature) and most importantly that showed moderate to high correlation with biochemically defined PC risk groups. Notably, the data also implied that the risk group with midrange PSA and low %free PSA, a priori known to be heterogeneous, could be further stratified into two subgroups, more resembling the lowest and highest risk groups, respectively.

The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-r) is overexpressed in prostate cancer, and Lys(3) -bombesin is a peptide that binds with high affinity to the GRP-r. HIV Tat(49-57) is a cell-penetrating peptide that reaches the DNA. In cancer cells, (177) Lu shows efficient crossfire effect, whereas (99m) Tc that is internalized in the cancer cell nuclei acts as an effective system of targeted radiotherapy because of the biological Auger effect.

This study evaluated age-related patterns of palliative radiation use among an elderly Medicare population.  Methods and materials:   We identified 63,221 patients with metastatic lung, breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Receipt of palliative radiation therapy was extracted from Medicare claims. Multivariate Poisson regression analysis determined residual age-related disparity in the receipt of palliative radiation therapy after controlling for confounding covariates including age-related differences in patient and demographic covariates, length of life, and patient preferences for aggressive cancer therapy.  Results:   The use of radiation decreased steadily with increasing patient age. Forty-two percent of patients aged 66 to 69 received palliative radiation therapy. Rates of palliative radiation decreased to 38%, 32%, 24%, and 14% among patients aged 70 to 74, 75 to 79, 80 to 84, and over 85, respectively. Multivariate analysis found that confounding covariates attenuated these findings, although the decreased relative rate of palliative radiation therapy among the elderly remained clinically and statistically significant.

Our objective was to develop a fast 3D T2 -weighted sequence for prostate imaging at 3T using a variable flip angle transition into driven equilibrium (T2 -TIDE) scheme.  Methods:   3D T2 -TIDE uses interleaved spiral-out phase encode ordering to efficiently sample the ky -kz phase encodes and also uses the transient balanced steady-state free precession signal to acquire the center of k-space for T2 -weighted imaging. Bloch simulations and images from 10 healthy subjects were acquired to evaluate the performance of 3D T2 -TIDE compared to 3D FSE.  Results:   3D T2 -TIDE images were acquired in 2:54 minutes compared to 7:02 minutes for 3D FSE with identical imaging parameters. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency was significantly higher for 3D T2 -TIDE compared to 3D FSE in nearly all tissues, including periprostatic fat (45 ± 12 vs. 31 ± 7, P < 0.01), gluteal fat (48 ± 8 vs. 41 ± 10, P = 0.12), right peripheral zone (20 ± 4 vs. 16 ± 8, P = 0.12), left peripheral zone (17 ± 2 vs. 12 ± 3, P < 0.01), and anterior fibromuscular stroma (12 ± 4 vs. 4 ± 2, P < 0.01).

Many DUBs have been shown to participate in cancer progression in various tissues. However, the mechanism and role of UCH-L3 in carcinogenesis has largely been unknown until recently. Here we investigated the implication of UCH-L3 in prostate cancer progression. Interestingly, UCH-L3 is upregulated in normal or non-metastatic prostate cancer cells and is downregulated in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Notably, knockdown of UCH-L3 in normal prostate cell line RWPE1 promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an important process for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The induction of EMT by UCH-L3 knockdown results in an increase of cell migration and invasion. Yet, to the contrary, overexpression of UCH-L3 in highly metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC3 reverses EMT but the active site mutant UCH-L3 did not. Collectively, our findings identify UCH-L3 as a novel EMT regulator in prostate cells and highlight UCH-L3 as a potential therapeutic target for preventing metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Hyun Min Song', 'Jae Eun Lee', 'Jung Hwa Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['UCH-L1 promotes cancer metastasis in prostate cancer cells through EMT induction.', 'Ubiquitin dimers control the hydrolase activity of UCH-L3.', 'The ubiquitin ligase UBE4A inhibits prostate cancer progression by targeting interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI).', 'The potential role of ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolases in oncogenesis.', 'The new function of two ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase isozymes as reciprocal modulators of germ cell apoptosis.', 'UCHL3 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration by de-ubiquitinating and stabilizing Vimentin.', 'The deubiquitinating enzyme UCHL3 promotes anaplastic thyroid cancer progression and metastasis through Hippo signaling pathway.', 'Deubiquitinases in Cancers: Aspects of Proliferation, Metastasis, and Apoptosis.', 'UCH-L1 and UCH-L3 regulate the cancer stem cell-like properties through PI3\u2005K/Akt signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'UCHL3 plays an important role in the occurrence and development of melanoma.']"""

Design:   Randomized controlled trial.  Setting:   Academic medical center.  Participants:   PCS (N=51; mean age, 70.2y) on ADT.  Intervention:   PCS were randomized to moderate to vigorous intensity resistance training or stretching (placebo control) for 1 year.  Main outcome measures:   Maximal leg press and bench press strength, objective and self-reported physical function, and self-reported disability. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to test for significant group × time differences adjusting for covariates.  Results:   Retention in the study was 84%, and median attendance to supervised classes was 84% in the resistance group. No study-related injuries occurred. Maximal leg strength (P=.032) and bench press strength (P=.027) were improved after 1 year of resistance training, whereas little change occurred from stretching. Self-reported physical function improved with resistance training, whereas decreases occurred from stretching (P=.016). Disability lessened more with resistance training than stretching (P=.018). One-year change in leg press strength mediated the relation between groups (resistance or stretching) and 1-year change in self-reported disability (P<.05).  Conclusions:   One year of resistance training improved muscle strength in androgen-deprived PCS. Strengthening muscles using functional movement patterns may be an important feature of exercise programs designed to improve perceptions of physical function and disability.

H-E stained sections were performed to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the histopathological characteristics of the tumor. Immunohistochemical techniques were used for detection of P63, CK7, CK10 and PSA. The results showed that in urothelial group, positive p63and CK7 immunostaining was observed in all cases of cystitis, transitional cell carcinoma and urinary bladder mucoid adenocarcinoma. All cases of cystitis, transitional cell carcinoma and urinary bladder mucoid adenocarcinoma were CK10 and PSA negative. In prostate group, positive p63 immunostaining was observed in all cases of NPH and in prostatic adenocarcinoma. Positive CK7 immunostaining was observed in all cases of NPH while all cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma were CK7 negative. Positive CK10 immunostaining was observed in all cases of NPH.

We have recently reported that AR is deubiquitinated and stabilised by Usp12 resulting in increased transcriptional activity. In this study we have investigated the relationship between Usp12, PHLPP and PHLPPL tumour suppressors in the regulation of AR transcriptional activity in prostate cancer (PC). PHLPP and PHLPPL are pro-apoptotic phosphatases that dephosphorylate and subsequently deactivate Akt. Phosphorylated Akt is reported to deactivate AR in PC by phosphorylation at Ser213 and Ser791 leading to ligand dissociation and AR degradation. In contrast, PHLPP- and PHLPPL-mediated dephosphorylation and inactivation of Akt elevates the levels of active AR. In this report we demonstrate that Usp12, in complex with Uaf-1 and WDR20, directly deubiquitinates and stabilises the Akt phosphatases PHLPP and PHLPPL resulting in decreased levels of active pAkt. Decreased pAkt in turn down-regulates AR Ser213 phosphorylation resulting in enhanced receptor stability and transcriptional activity. Additionally, we observe that depleting Usp12 sensitises PC cells to therapies aimed at Akt inhibition irrespectively of their sensitivity to androgen ablation therapy. We propose that Usp12 inhibition could offer a therapeutic alternative for castration resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Urszula L McClurg', 'Emma E Summerscales', 'Victoria J Harle', 'Luke Gaughan', 'Craig N Robson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Deubiquitinating enzyme Usp12 is a novel co-activator of the androgen receptor.', 'Ubiquitin-specific protease 12 interacting partners Uaf-1 and WDR20 are potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular mechanism of the TP53-MDM2-AR-AKT signalling network regulation by USP12.', 'Cross-talk between the androgen receptor and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Deubiquitinating Enzyme USP12 Regulates the Pro-Apoptosis Protein Bax.', 'The role of ubiquitination in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.', 'OTUB2 regulates KRT80 stability via deubiquitination and promotes tumour proliferation in gastric cancer.', 'USP12 downregulation orchestrates a protumourigenic microenvironment and enhances lung tumour resistance to PD-1 blockade.']"""

Flavopiridol is currently undergoing investigation in human clinical trials. The present study focused on the effect of flavopiridol in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis in prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs). Therefore, cluster of differentiation 133 (CD133)(+high)/CD44(+high) prostate CSCs were isolated from the DU145 human prostate cancer cell line. The cells were treated with flavopiridol in a dose‑ and time‑dependent manner to determine the inhibitory effect. Cell viability and proliferation were analyzed and the efficiency of flavopiridol was assessed using the sphere‑forming assay. Flavopiridol was applied to monolayer cultures of CD133(high)/CD44(high) human prostate CSCs at the following final concentrations: 100, 300, 500 and 1000 nM . The cultures were incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value of the drug was determined as 500 nM for monolayer cells. Dead cells were analyzed prior and subsequent to exposure to increasing flavopiridol doses. Annexin‑V and immunofluorescence analyses were performed for the evaluation of apoptotic pathways. According to the results, flavopiridol treatment caused significant growth inhibition at 500 and 1000 nM when compared to the control at 24 h. G(0)/G(1) analysis showed a statistically significant difference between 100 and 500 nM (P<0.005), 100 and 1000 nM (P<0.001), 300 and 1000 nM (P<0.001), and 500 and 1000 nM (P<0.001). Flavopiridol also significantly influenced the cells in the G(2)/M phase, particularly at high‑dose treatments. Flavopiridol induced growth inhibition and apoptosis at the IC(50) dose (500 nM), resulting in a significant increase in immunofluorescence staining of caspase‑3, caspase‑8 and p53.

The partial basal-like immunophenotype of these tumors is intriguing in light of the persistent debate surrounding the cell-of-origin for prostate cancer; however, their molecular phenotype is unknown. We collected 37 of these tumors on radical prostatectomy and biopsy and assessed subsets for a diverse panel of molecular markers. The majority of p63-expressing tumors were positive for the ΔNp63 isoform (6/7) by immunofluorescence and p63 mRNA (7/8) by chromogenic in situ hybridization. Despite p63 positivity, these tumors uniformly expressed luminal-type cytokeratin proteins such as CK18 (13/13), CK8 (8/8), and markers of androgen axis signaling commonly seen in luminal cells, including androgen receptor (10/11), NKX3.1 (8/8), and prostein (12/13). Conversely, basal cytokeratins such as CK14 and CK15 were negative in all cases (0/8) and CK5/6 was weakly and focally positive in 36% (4/11) of cases. Pluripotency markers including β-catenin, Oct4, and c-kit were negative in p63-expressing tumors (0/11). Despite nearly universal expression of androgen receptor and downstream androgen signaling targets, p63-expressing tumors lacked ERG rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization (0/14) and ERG protein expression (0/37). No tumors expressed SPINK1 or showed PTEN protein loss (0/19). Surprisingly, 74% (14/19) of p63-expressing tumors expressed GSTP1 protein at least focally, and 33% (2/6) entirely lacked GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation by bisulfite sequencing. In contrast to usual prostatic adenocarcinomas, prostate tumors with p63 expression show a mixed luminal/basal immunophenotype, uniformly lack ERG gene rearrangement, and frequently express GSTP1.

Identification of mechanisms responsible for survival and self-renewal of CSC will help design new therapeutic strategies that target and eliminate both differentiated cancer cells and CSC. Here we demonstrated the potential role of proapoptotic protein BAD in the biology of CSC in melanoma, prostate and breast cancers. We enriched CD44(+)/CD24(-) cells (CSC) by tumorosphere formation and purified this population by FACS. Both spheres and CSC exhibited increased potential for proliferation, migration, invasion, sphere formation, anchorage-independent growth, as well as upregulation of several stem cell-associated markers. We showed that the phosphorylation of BAD is essential for the survival of CSC. Conversely, ectopic expression of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant BAD induced apoptosis in CSC. This effect was enhanced by treatment with a BH3-mimetic, ABT-737. Both pharmacological agents that inhibit survival kinases and growth factors that are involved in drug resistance delivered their respective cytotoxic and protective effects by modulating the BAD phosphorylation in CSC. Furthermore, the frequency and self-renewal capacity of CSC was significantly reduced by knocking down the BAD expression. Consistent with our in vitro results, significant phosphorylation of BAD was found in CD44(+) CSC of 83% breast tumor specimens. In addition, we also identified a positive correlation between BAD expression and disease stage in prostate cancer, suggesting a role of BAD in tumor advancement.

In the present study, we have investigated whether tumour ErbB2 immunoreactivity (ErbB2-IR) has clinically useful prognostic value, i.e. that it provides additional prognostic information to that provided by routine clinical tests (Gleason score, tumour stage).  Methodology/principal findings:   ErbB2-IR was measured in a well-characterised tissue microarray of tumour and non-malignant samples obtained at diagnosis. Additionally, mRNA levels of ErbB2-IR in the prostate were determined in the rat following manipulation of circulating androgen levels. Tumour ErbB2-IR was significantly associated with the downstream signalling molecule phosphorylated-Akt and with the cell proliferation marker Ki-67. The significant association of tumour ErbB2-IR with the Gleason score at diagnosis was lost when controlled for the association of both parameters with Ki-67. In the rat prostate, mRNA for ErbB2 was inversely associated with circulating androgen levels. There was no association between ErbB2-IR and the androgen receptor (AR)-IR in the tumours, but an interaction between the two parameters was seen with respect to their association with the tumour stage. Tumour ErbB2-IR was confirmed to be a prognostic marker for disease-specific survival, but it did not provide significant additive information to the Gleason score or to Ki-67.

In cases of discrepant results between scintigraphy and ultrasonography, it is important to rely on another diagnostic imaging modality. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography (PET) have been studied, but are imperfect to detect abnormal parathyroid glands. Recently, first cases of abnormal parathyroid glands taking-up radiolabelled choline were discovered incidentally in men referred to (11)C-choline or (18)F-fluorocholine (FCH)-PET/CT for prostate cancer. We checked if FCH uptake was a general feature of adenomatous or hyperplastic parathyroid glands.  Methods:   FCH-PET/CT was performed in 12 patients with primary (n = 8) or secondary hyperparathyroidism (1 dialyzed, 3 grafted) and with discordant or equivocal results on preoperative ultrasonography (US) and/or (123)I/(99m)Tc-sestamibi dual-phase scintigraphy. The results of the FCH-PET/CT were evaluated, with surgical exploration and histopathologic examination as the standard of truth.  Results:   On a per-patient level, the detection rate of FCH-PET/CT (at least one FCH focus corresponding to an abnormal parathyroid gland in a given patient) was 11/12 = 92%. FCH-PET/CT detected 18 foci interpreted as parathyroid glands and correctly localized 17 abnormal parathyroid glands (7 adenomas and 10 hyperplasias). On a per-lesion level, FCH-PET/CT results were 17 TP, 2 false negative ie, a lesion-based sensitivity of 89%, and 1 false positive.  Conclusion:   As the main result of this pilot study, we show that in patients with hyperparathyroidism and with discordant or equivocal results on scintigraphy or on ultrasonography, adenomatous or hyperplastic parathyroid glands can be localized by FCH-PET/CT with good accuracy. Furthermore, FCH-PET/CT can solve discrepant results between preoperative ultrasonography and scintigraphy and has thus a potential as a functional imaging modality in the detection of abnormal parathyroid glands.

Methods:   RISAD-P radiolabeled with 123I, 124I, and 125I were synthesized using a common stannylated precursor. The cellular uptake, subcellular distribution, and radiotoxicity of 123I-, 124I-, and (125) IRISAD-P were measured in LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 cell lines expressing various levels of AR.  Results:   The uptake of RISAD-P by prostate cancer cells is proportional to AR levels and independent of the radionuclide. The intracellular accumulation of radioactivity is directly proportional to the extracellular concentration of RISAD-P and the duration of exposure. Initially, RISAD-P is trapped in the cytoplasm. Within 24 hr, radioactivity is associated exclusively with DNA. The RISAD-P radiotoxicity is determined by the radionuclide; however, the cellular responses are directly proportional to the AR expression levels. LNCaP cells expressing high levels of AR are killed at the rate of up to 60% per day after a brief 1 hr RISAD-P treatment. For the first time, the AR expression in PC-3 and DU 145 cells, generally reported as AR-negative, was quantitated by the ultra sensitive RISAD-P-based method.  Conclusions:   RISAD-P is a theranostic drug, which targets AR. Its subcellular metabolite participates in DNA synthesis. RISAD-P is a promising candidate for imaging of the AR expression and tumor proliferation as well as molecular radiotherapy of prostate cancer.""","""['Guang Han', 'Zbigniew P Kortylewicz', 'Thomas Enke', 'Janina Baranowska-Kortylewicz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Preclinical evaluation of investigational radiopharmaceutical RISAD-P intended for use as a diagnostic and molecular radiotherapy agent for prostate cancer.', 'Antagonistic interaction between bicalutamide (Casodex) and radiation in androgen-positive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', '5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol supports human prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation through androgen receptor-independent signaling pathways: implication of androgen-independent prostate cancer progression.', 'DNA licensing as a novel androgen receptor mediated therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis of Auger electron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Bromodomain protein BRDT directs ΔNp63 function and super-enhancer activity in a subset of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.', ""Radiolabeled (R)-(-)-5-iodo-3'-O-2-(ε-guanidinohexanoyl)-2-phenylacetyl-2'-deoxyuridine: A new theranostic for neuroblastoma."", ""Biological Evaluation of a Potential Anticancer Agent Methyl N-5-(3'-Iodobenzoyl)-1H-Benzimidazol-2-ylCarbamate."", 'Subcellular Targeting of Theranostic Radionuclides.', 'Early Response Monitoring Following Radiation Therapy by Using 18FFDG and 11CAcetate PET in Prostate Cancer Xenograft Model with Metabolomics Corroboration.']"""

Patients and methods:   We identified 255 patients with a localized prostate cancer (PCa) and BMI ≥30 treated with radical prostatectomy from January 2009 to December 2011. To adjust for risk factors of increased perioperative morbidity (nerve-sparing, pelvic lymph node dissection, prostate volume), a propensity score-based matching was performed between RRP and RARP (n=115 each group). Both groups were compared by taking into consideration histopathological outcomes as well as peri- and postoperative (30 days) morbidity.  Results:   There were no differences in histopathological characteristics (pT/pN-stage, Gleason score, R-stage; all p>0.05) in both groups.

We previously showed that EBR induced apoptosis by activating polyamine catabolic pathway, which lead to the accumulation of cytotoxic compounds such as hydrogen peroxide and aldehydes in LNCaP and DU 145 prostate cancer cells. However, we found that LNCaP prostate cancer cells expressing functional androgen receptor (AR) was found more sensitive to EBR than those with non-functional AR (DU 145 cells).  Results:   To better understand the apoptotic effect of EBR, we aimed to investigate the cellular responses in p53 null, PC3 prostate cancer cells. We showed that EBR induced mitochondria-mediated and caspase-dependent apoptosis in wt and p53 stable transfected PC3 cells, which suggesting that EBR-induced apoptosis regardless of p53 expression. In addition, inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-α orthe activation of Mdm2 by Nutlin-3 co-treatment did not alter EBR induced PARP cleavage. Furthermore, EBR treatment was also induced apoptosis in both LNCaP(wt p53) and DU 145 (mt p53)cells, respectively. These all findings verified that EBR-induced apoptosis regardless of p53 expression. The PA catabolic pathway was also altered in PC3 cells causing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular PA pool decrease. However, the silencing of spermidine-spermineacetyltransferase (SSAT), a key enzyme at polyamine catabolic machinery prevented the EBR-induced apoptosis.

They are rich in polyphenols, mainly ellagitannins (ETs) that after consumption are hydrolyzed to release ellagic acid (EA). EA is further metabolized by microbiota to form urolithins, such as A and B, which are absorbed. ETs, EA and urolithins have shown to slow the proliferation and growth of different types of cancer cells but the mechanisms remain unclear. We investigate the role of urolithins in the regulatory mechanisms in prostate cancer, specifically those related to the androgen receptor (AR), which have been linked to the development of this type of cancer. In our study, urolithins down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of both prostate specific antigen (PSA) and AR in LNCaP cells. The luciferase assay performed with a construct containing three androgen response elements (AREs) showed that urolithins inhibit AR-mediated PSA expression at the transcriptional level. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that urolithins decreased AR binding to its consensus response element. Additionally, urolithins induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, and this effect correlated with a decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels. In summary, urolithins attenuate the function of the AR by repressing its expression, causing a down-regulation of PSA levels and inducing apoptosis.

The dual luciferase assay was used to examine the binding between miR-146a and the 3'UTR of potential targets.  Results:   We found that enforced over-expression of miR-146a in prostate cancer cells suppressed whereas knockdown of miR-146a increased anchorage-independent growth, migration, and invasion. Mechanistic studies revealed that miR-146a repressed the expression of Rac1 through binding to its 3'UTR. Consistently, knockdown of Rac1 phenocopied the anti-migration effect of overexpressing miR-146a, and knockdown of Rac1 in miR-146a-silencing cells antagonized the increase in cell motility induced by silencing miR-146a.

However, estrogens also directly affect tumor cells, though the mechanisms involved are not well understood.  Methods:   LAPC-4 (androgen-dependent) and PC-3 (androgen-independent) cell viability was measured after estradiol (E2) or DES treatment across wide concentration ranges. We then examined multiple rapid signaling mechanisms at 0.1 nM E2 and 1 µM DES optima including levels of: activation (phosphorylation) for mitogen-activated protein kinases, cell-cycle proteins, and caspase 3, necroptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Results:   LAPC-4 cells were more responsive than PC-3 cells. Robust and sustained extracellular-regulated kinase activation with E2 , but not DES, correlated with ROS generation and cell death. c-Jun N-terminal kinase was only activated in E2-treated PC-3 cells and was not correlated with caspase 3-mediated apoptosis; necroptosis was not involved. The cell-cycle inhibitor protein p16(INK4A) was phosphorylated in both cell lines by both E2 and DES, but to differing extents. In both cell types, both estrogens activated p38 kinase, which subsequently phosphorylated cyclin D1, tagging it for degradation, except in DES-treated PC-3 cells.  Conclusions:   Cyclin D1 status correlated most closely with disrupted cell cycling as a cause of reduced cell numbers, though other mechanisms also contributed. As low as 0.1 nM E2 effectively elicited these mechanisms, and its use could dramatically improve outcomes for both early- and late-stage prostate cancer patients, while avoiding the side effects of high-dose DES treatment.""","""['Luke Y Koong', 'Cheryl S Watson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Xenoestrogen interference with nongenomic signaling actions of physiological estrogens in endocrine cancer cells.', 'Induction of apoptosis by diethylstilbestrol in hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Divergent biological effects of estradiol and diethylstilbestrol in the prostate cancer cell line MOP.', 'The evolving role of estrogen therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Nongenomic effects of estradiol vs. the birth control estrogen ethinyl estradiol on signaling and cell proliferation in pituitary tumor cells, and differences in the ability of R-equol to neutralize or enhance these effects.', 'Transdermal Delivery of Estradiol Simultaneously Possessing Rapid Release and Sustained Release Effect.', 'Protective effects of Korean Red Ginseng against toxicity of endocrine-disrupting chemicals.', 'Protein Disulfide-Isomerase A3 Is a Robust Prognostic Biomarker for Cancers and Predicts the Immunotherapy Response Effectively.', 'Xenoestrogen interference with nongenomic signaling actions of physiological estrogens in endocrine cancer cells.', 'The role of G-protein-coupled membrane estrogen receptor in mouse Leydig cell function-in vivo and in vitro evaluation.']"""

Methods:   Patients with advanced solid tumors (n = 24) received doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) and escalating doses of pantoprazole (80, 160, 240 and 360 mg) administered intravenously prior to doxorubicin. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic studies. An optional biopsy was performed to evaluate doxorubicin concentration and pharmacodynamic markers of drug activity.  Results:   Twenty-four patients participated in the study (17 in the dose escalation phase and 7 in the dose expansion). Three patients experienced a dose limiting toxicity (grade 3 fatigue in the three cases), one patient at dose level 3 (pantoprazole 240 mg) and two patients at dose level 4 (pantoprazole 360 mg). Dose level 4 was considered to exceed the maximum tolerated dose. The recommended phase II dose was pantoprazole 240 mg and doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2). The most commonly observed toxicities included fatigue, neutropenia and leukopenia. Two patients achieved a confirmed partial response. Median maximum serum concentration of pantoprazole was 84.3 μM at 1-2 h after injection of pantoprazole 240 mg. No drug-drug interaction was observed. A single on-treatment tumor biopsy showed a sharply decreasing gradient in doxorubicin concentration and associated activity markers with increasing distance from tumor blood vessels.  Conclusion:   Administration of high doses of pantoprazole in combination with doxorubicin is feasible. The recommended phase II dose of pantoprazole, 240 mg, will be evaluated in combination with docetaxel as first line in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Irene Brana', 'Alberto Ocana', 'Eric X Chen', 'Albiruni R A Razak', 'Christine Haines', 'Carol Lee', 'Sarah Douglas', 'Lisa Wang', 'Lillian L Siu', 'Ian F Tannock', 'Philippe L Bedard']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['A phase I study of Triapine in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors.', 'A phase I pharmacodynamic trial of bortezomib in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced cancer.', 'Phase I study of paclitaxel (taxol) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (caelyx) administered every 2 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors.', 'Pantoprazole Affecting Docetaxel Resistance Pathways via Autophagy (PANDORA): Phase II Trial of High Dose Pantoprazole (Autophagy Inhibitor) with Docetaxel in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC).', 'An NCIC-CTG phase I dose escalation pharmacokinetic study of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor BAY 12-9566 in combination with doxorubicin.', 'The relationship between autophagy and PD-L1 and their role in antitumor therapy.', 'Combination of esomeprazole and pirfenidone enhances antifibrotic efficacy in vitro and in a mouse model of TGFβ-induced lung fibrosis.', 'Esomeprazole enhances the effect of ionizing radiation to improve tumor control.', 'Esomeprazole attenuates inflammatory and fibrotic response in lung cells through the MAPK/Nrf2/HO1 pathway.', 'Autophagy in tumour immunity and therapy.']"""

The bark of the Alnus species has been used for the treatment of various pathological conditions including hemorrhage, alcoholism, fever, diarrhea, skin diseases, inflammation, and cancer in East Asia for centuries. In this study, we show that hirsutenone, a bioactive compound in Alnus japonica, exhibits anti-cancer effects against prostate cancer through a direct physical inhibition of Akt1/2. Hirsutenone suppressed anchorage-dependent and independent cell growth of PC3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Annexin V and Propidium iodide (PI) staining results demonstrated that hirsutenone strongly induces apoptotic cell death in both PC3 and LNCaP cells. Furthermore, treatment of hirsutenone attenuated phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream substrate of Akt, without affecting Akt phosphorylation. Kinase and pull-down assay results clearly show that hirsutenone inhibits Akt1 and 2 by direct binding in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-noncompetitive manner in vitro and ex vivo.

Moving organs generate substantial temporal and spatial field fluctuations as a result of susceptibility mismatch with the surrounding tissue (i.e. periodic breathing, cardiac motion or random bowel motion). Nine patients with prostate cancer were scanned with an endorectal coil (ERC) on a 7-T MR scanner. Temporal B0 field variations were observed with fast dynamic B0 mapping in these patients. Simulations of dynamic B0 corrections were performed using zero- to second-order shim terms. In addition, the temporal B0 variations were applied to simulated MR spectra causing, on average, 15% underestimation of the choline/citrate ratio. Linewidth distortions and frequency shifts (up to 30 and 8 Hz, respectively) were observed. To demonstrate the concept of observing local field fluctuations in real time during MRSI data acquisition, a field probe (FP) tuned and matched for the (19) F frequency was incorporated into the housing of the ERC. The data acquired with the FP were compared with the B0 field map data and used to correct the MRSI datasets retrospectively. The dynamic B0 mapping data showed variations of up to 30 Hz (0.1 ppm) over 72 s at 7 T. The simulated zero-order corrections, calculated as the root mean square, reduced the standard deviation (SD) of the dynamic variations by an average of 41%. When using second-order corrections, the reduction in the SD was, on average, 56%. The FP data showed the same variation range as the dynamic B0 data and the variation patterns corresponded. After retrospective correction, the MRSI data showed artifact reduction and improved spectral resolution. B0 variations can degrade the MRSI substantially. The simple incorporation of an FP into an ERC can improve prostate cancer MRSI without prior knowledge of the origin of the dynamic field distortions.""","""['C S Arteaga de Castro', 'V O Boer', 'M P Luttje', 'T A van der Velden', 'A Bhogal', 'M van Vulpen', 'P R Luijten', 'U A van der Heide', 'D W J Klomp']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['A phase and frequency alignment protocol for 1H MRSI data of the prostate.', 'Three-dimensional H-1 MR spectroscopic imaging of the in situ human prostate with high (0.24-0.7-cm3) spatial resolution.', 'Direct B0 field monitoring and real-time B0 field updating in the human breast at 7 Tesla.', 'MR spectroscopic imaging for evaluation of prostate cancer.', 'Advances in MR spectroscopy of the prostate.', 'Progress in Imaging the Human Torso at the Ultrahigh Fields of 7 and 10.5\xa0T.', 'Evolution of UHF Body Imaging in the Human Torso at 7T: Technology, Applications, and Future Directions.', 'Design of a forward view antenna for prostate imaging at 7\u2009T.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 100 consecutive robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy procedures that were carried out by a single surgeon at the Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, Tottori University Faculty of Medicine, Yonago, Japan. Preoperative clinical data and anatomical measurements, including the calculated prostate volume pelvic cavity index, were determined based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, and their effects on console time, estimated blood loss and surgical margin status were compared.  Results:   Body mass index, the prostate anteroposterior diameter, and the prostate volume-to-pelvic cavity index ratio were all significantly correlated with console time and estimated blood loss, based on a univariate analysis (P < 0.05). The prostate craniocaudal diameter, prostate transverse diameter and prostate volume also correlated with console time. However, based on the multiple linear regression analysis, only the prostate volume-to-pelvic cavity index ratio was found to be a significant predictor of console time and estimated blood loss. Furthermore, when the 100 total cases were divided into 50 early cases and 50 late cases, the prostate volume-to-pelvic cavity index ratio correlated with console time and estimated blood loss only in the early group, and not in the late group. In contrast, anatomical measurements had no significant effect on surgical margin status.  Conclusion:   Magnetic resonance imaging can be a valuable adjunct to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.

Similar to photon based IMRT, MFO allows for the utilization of a simultaneous integrated boost in which multiple target volumes are treated to discrete doses simultaneously, potentially improving plan quality and streamlining quality assurance and treatment delivery. However, MFO may render plans more sensitive to the physical uncertainties inherent to particle therapy. Here we present clinical examples of a single-field integrated boost (SFIB) technique for spot scanning proton therapy based on single field optimization (SFO) treatment-planning techniques.  Methods and materials:   We designed plans of each type for illustrative patients with central nervous system (brain and spine), prostate and head and neck malignancies. SFIB and IMPT plans were constructed to deliver multiple prescription dose levels to multiple targets using SFO or MFO, respectively. Dose and fractionation schemes were based on the current clinical practice using X-ray IMRT in our clinic. For inverse planning, dose constraints were employed to achieve the desired target coverage and normal tissue sparing. Conformality and inhomogeneity indices were calculated to quantify plan quality. We also compared the worst-case robustness of the SFIB, sequential boost SFUD, and IMPT plans.  Results:   The SFIB technique produced more conformal dose distributions than plans generated by sequential boost using a SFUD technique (conformality index for prescription isodose levels; 0.585 ± 0.30 vs. 0.435 ± 0.24, SFIB vs. SFUD respectively, Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank test, p < 0.01). There was no difference in the conformality index between SFIB and IMPT plans (0.638 ± 0.27 vs. 0.633 ± 0.26, SFIB vs. IMPT, respectively). Heterogeneity between techniques was not significantly different. With respect to clinical metrics, SFIB plans proved more robust than the corresponding IMPT plans.  Conclusions:   SFIB technique for scanning beam proton therapy (SSPT) is now routinely employed in our clinic. The SFIB technique is a natural application of SFO and offers several advantages over SFUD, including more conformal plans, seamless treatment delivery and more efficient planning and QA. SFIB may be more robust than IMPT and has been the treatment planning technique of choice for some patients.""","""['Xiaorong Ronald Zhu', 'Falk Poenisch', 'Heng Li', 'Xiaodong Zhang', 'Narayan Sahoo', 'Richard Y Wu', 'Xiaoqiang Li', 'Andrew K Lee', 'Eric L Chang', 'Seungtaek Choi', 'Thomas Pugh', 'Steven J Frank', 'Michael T Gillin', 'Anita Mahajan', 'David R Grosshans']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['A dosimetric comparison of intensity-modulated proton therapy optimization techniques for pediatric craniopharyngiomas: a clinical case study.', 'Preliminary evaluation of multifield and single-field optimization for the treatment planning of spot-scanning proton therapy of head and neck cancer.', 'Energy layer optimization strategies for intensity-modulated proton therapy of lung cancer patients.', 'Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) - The future of IMRT for head and neck cancer.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Simulation study using the spots deletion technique in spot scanning proton beam therapy for prostate cancers.', 'Trend analysis of the dosimetric impact of anatomical changes during proton therapy for maxillary sinus carcinoma.', 'A prospective phase II randomized trial of proton radiotherapy vs intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.', 'The Importance of Verification CT-QA Scans in Patients Treated with IMPT for Head and Neck Cancers.', 'Postoperative Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy for Head and Neck Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma.']"""

To date, there is no single standard treatment of urethral strictures. One of the promising methods is laser optical urethrotomy using a solid-state Ho:YAG- laser. Since 2012, we treated 12 patients with strictures of VUA, urethral strictures, and bladder neck obliteration. According urethrography, the maximum length of stricture was 4.5 cm. Treatment efficacy was assessed at 6 months after surgery objectively according urethrography, uroflowmetry, and ultrasound of the bladder with the definition of residual urine; and subjectively--by IPSS questionnaire and QoL questionnaire. After removal of the urethral catheter, all patients had recovered independent urination, decreased IPSS scores by 59.5%, IPSS-QoL score by 45.87%, decreased residual urine volume by 89.92%, and increased maximum urinary flow rate by 78.19%. Intraoperative complications and early postoperative complications were not observed.

Literature is lacking on the effect of advanced age on complication rates in men undergoing robotic prostatectomy. We performed a comparative analysis of complication rates for men ≤69 and ≥70 years undergoing RARP.  Methods:   After IRB approval, we reviewed our initial 1000 consecutive patients who underwent RARP from 6/2002 to 6/2011 for intraoperative and postoperative complications, and we compared complication rates stratified by age ≤69 and ≥70 years. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system. The Fischer's exact test was used to compare complication rates, and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   In our cohort, 868 men were ≤69 and 129 men were ≥70. Overall, the intraoperative and postoperative complication rates for the entire cohort were 0.90% and 10.2%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in individual postoperative complications between the two groups, however, the overall postoperative complications rates for men ≤69 and ≥70 were 9.4% and 15.4%, respectively (p-value=0.043). Major complication rates for men ≤69 and ≥70 were 6.7% (58) and 10.8% (14), respectively (p=0.10); minor complications rates were 2.8% (22) and 4.6% (6), respectively (p=0.25).  Conclusions:   In our study, men ≥70 had a significantly higher overall complication rate after RARP compared with men ≤69 years; however, the individual, minor, and major complications were not different between the two groups. RARP is relatively safe in this older age group.

Potential applications in the field of medicine include automated report summaries, physician alerts, patient repositories, electronic medical record (EMR) billing, and quality metric reports. Despite these prospects and the recent widespread adoption of EMR, NLP has been relatively underutilized. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of an internally developed NLP program in extracting select pathologic findings from radical prostatectomy specimen reports in the EMR.  Methods:   An NLP program was generated by a software engineer to extract key variables from prostatectomy reports in the EMR within our healthcare system, which included the TNM stage, Gleason grade, presence of a tertiary Gleason pattern, histologic subtype, size of dominant tumor nodule, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), perineural invasion (PNI), angiolymphatic invasion (ALI), extracapsular extension (ECE), and surgical margin status (SMS). The program was validated by comparing NLP results to a gold standard compiled by two blinded manual reviewers for 100 random pathology reports.  Results:   NLP demonstrated 100% accuracy for identifying the Gleason grade, presence of a tertiary Gleason pattern, SVI, ALI, and ECE. It also demonstrated near-perfect accuracy for extracting histologic subtype (99.0%), PNI (98.9%), TNM stage (98.0%), SMS (97.0%), and dominant tumor size (95.7%). The overall accuracy of NLP was 98.7%. NLP generated a result in <1 second, whereas the manual reviewers averaged 3.2 minutes per report.  Conclusions:   This novel program demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency identifying key pathologic details from the prostatectomy report within an EMR system. NLP has the potential to assist urologists by summarizing and highlighting relevant information from verbose pathology reports.

Moreover, aberrant promoter methylation is a promising biomarker for non-invasive screening. Herein, we sought to characterize EFEMP1 as biomarker for PCa, unveiling its biological relevance in prostate carcinogenesis. Microarray analyses of treated PCa cell lines and primary tissues enabled the selection of differentially methylated genes, among which EFEMP1 was further validated by MSP and bisulfite sequencing. Assessment of biomarker performance was accomplished by qMSP. Expression analysis of EFEMP1 and characterization of histone marks were performed in tissue samples and cancer cell lines to determine the impact of epigenetic mechanisms on EFEMP1 transcriptional regulation. Phenotypic assays, using transfected cell lines, permitted the evaluation of EFEMP1's role in PCa development. EFEMP1 methylation assay discriminated PCa from normal prostate tissue (NPT; P < 0.001, Kruskall-Wallis test) and renal and bladder cancers (96% sensitivity and 98% specificity). EFEMP1 transcription levels inversely correlated with promoter methylation and histone deacetylation, suggesting that both epigenetic mechanisms are involved in gene regulation. Phenotypic assays showed that EFEMP1 de novo expression reduces malignant phenotype of PCa cells. EFEMP1 promoter methylation is prevalent in PCa and accurately discriminates PCa from non-cancerous prostate tissues and other urological neoplasms. This epigenetic alteration occurs early in prostate carcinogenesis and, in association with histone deacetylation, progressively leads to gene down-regulation, fostering cell proliferation, invasion and evasion of apoptosis.""","""['Mafalda Almeida', 'Vera L Costa', 'Natália R Costa', 'João Ramalho-Carvalho', 'Tiago Baptista', 'Franclim R Ribeiro', 'Paula Paulo', 'Manuel R Teixeira', 'Jorge Oliveira', 'Ragnhild A Lothe', 'Guro E Lind', 'Rui Henrique', 'Carmen Jerónimo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['EFEMP1 as a novel DNA methylation marker for prostate cancer: array-based DNA methylation and expression profiling.', 'Epigenetic regulation of MDR1 gene through post-translational histone modifications in prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic inactivation of EFEMP1 is associated with tumor suppressive function in endometrial carcinoma.', 'Epigenetics in prostate cancer: biologic and clinical relevance.', 'Epigenetic Modifications and Modulators in Prostate Cancer.', 'Significance of fibulin-3 expression in bladder cancer: a tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical study.', 'Application of Proteogenomics to Urine Analysis towards the Identification of Novel Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer: An Exploratory Study.', 'Utility of EFEMP1 in the Prediction of Oncologic Outcomes of Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'miR-9-Mediated Inhibition of EFEMP1 Contributes to the Acquisition of Pro-Tumoral Properties in Normal Fibroblasts.', 'The Pathophysiological Significance of Fibulin-3.']"""

GH binds the transmembrane GH receptor (GHR) to activate the intracellular GHR-associated tyrosine kinase, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and downstream signals, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation and IGF-1 gene expression. Some GH effects are partly mediated by GH-induced IGF-1 via IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), a tyrosine kinase receptor. We previously demonstrated in non-human cells that GH causes formation of a GHR-JAK2-IGF-1R complex and that presence of IGF-1R (even without IGF-1 binding) augments proximal GH signaling. In this study, we use human LNCaP prostate cancer cells as a model system to further study the IGF-1R's role in GH signaling. GH promoted JAK2 and GHR tyrosine phosphorylation and STAT5 activation in LNCaP cells. By coimmunoprecipitation and a new split luciferase complementation assay, we find that GH augments GHR/IGF-1R complex formation, which is inhibited by a Fab of an antagonistic anti-GHR monoclonal antibody. Short hairpin RNA-mediated IGF-1R silencing in LNCaP cells reduced GH-induced GHR, JAK2, and STAT5 phosphorylation. Similarly, a soluble IGF-1R extracellular domain fragment (sol IGF-1R) interacts with GHR in response to GH and blunts GH signaling. Sol IGF-1R also markedly inhibits GH-induced IGF-1 gene expression in both LNCaP cells and mouse primary osteoblast cells. On the basis of these and other findings, we propose a model in which IGF-1R augments GH signaling by allowing a putative IGF-1R-associated molecule that regulates GH signaling to access the activated GHR/JAK2 complex and envision sol IGF-1R as a dominant-negative inhibitor of this IGF-1R-mediated augmentation. Physiological implications of this new model are discussed.""","""['Yujun Gan', 'Ashiya Buckels', 'Ying Liu', 'Yue Zhang', 'Andrew J Paterson', 'Jing Jiang', 'Kurt R Zinn', 'Stuart J Frank']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Erratum.', 'Growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR)-specific inhibition of GH-Induced signaling by soluble IGF-1 receptor (sol IGF-1R).', 'IGF-1R modulation of acute GH-induced STAT5 signaling: role of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity.', 'Functional collaboration of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), but not insulin receptor (IR), with acute GH signaling in mouse calvarial cells.', 'SH2-B and SIRP: JAK2 binding proteins that modulate the actions of growth hormone.', 'Human growth disorders associated with impaired GH action: Defects in STAT5B and JAK2.', 'Efficacy and Safety of Nasal Immunisation with Somatostatin DNA Vaccine for Growth Promotion in Fattening Pigs.', 'Mutations in GHR and IGF1R Genes as a Potential Reason for the Lack of Catch-Up Growth in SGA Children.', 'IGF Signaling in Intervertebral Disc Health and Disease.', 'Dual Characters of GH-IGF1 Signaling Pathways in Radiotherapy and Post-radiotherapy Repair of Cancers.', 'Classical and novel GH receptor signaling pathways.']"""

The accuracy and practicality of the EPID in-vivo dosimetry system was confirmed through a comparison with traditional TLD in-vivo measurements performed on five prostate patients.The commissioning time required for the EPID in-vivo dosimetry system was initially prohibitive at approximately 10 h per linac. Here we present a method of calculating linac specific EPID dosimetry correction factors that allow a single energy specific commissioning model to be applied to EPID data from multiple linacs. Using this method reduced the required per linac commissioning time to approximately 30 min.The validity of this commissioning method has been tested by analysing in-vivo dosimetry results of 1220 patients acquired on seven linacs over a period of 5 years. The average deviation between EPID based isocentre dose and expected isocentre dose for these patients was (-0.7 ± 3.2)%.EPID based in-vivo dosimetry is now the primary in-vivo dosimetry tool used at our centre and has replaced nearly all pre-treatment dose verification of IMRT treatments.""","""['Ian M Hanson', 'Vibeke N Hansen', 'Igor Olaciregui-Ruiz', 'Marcel van Herk']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'In aqua vivo EPID dosimetry.', 'Transit and non-transit 3D EPID dosimetry versus detector arrays for patient specific QA.', 'A literature review of electronic portal imaging for radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'Estimating dose delivery accuracy in stereotactic body radiation therapy: A review of in-vivo measurement methods.', 'A recurrent neural network for rapid detection of delivery errors during real-time portal dosimetry.', 'Optimisation of a composite difference metric for prompt error detection in real-time portal dosimetry of simulated volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'In vivo dosimetry in external beam photon radiotherapy: Requirements and future directions for research, development, and clinical practice.', 'Experimental verification of a 3D in vivo dose monitoring system based on EPID.']"""

Mean age of these patients was 57.98 ±27.49 years and 53.5% were male. Female patients were approximately 5 years younger than males. The most frequent cancer was breast in women followed by skin, colorectal, hematologic system and stomach. The 5 most frequent cancers in men were skin, bladder, colorectal, stomach and prostate. The ASR in 2005 to 2009 was respectively 85.2, 86.1, 92.6, 102.2 and 104.7 per 100,000 populations.  Conclusions:   ASR of cancer is increasing rapidly in Yazd Province.

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of cancer in association with impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance.  Methods:   The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched for prospective cohort studies with data on prediabetes and cancer. Two independent reviewers assessed the reports and extracted the data. Prospective studies were included if they reported adjusted RRs with 95% CIs for the association between cancer and prediabetes.

The results were consistent across cancer endpoint, age, duration of follow-up and ethnicity. There was no significant difference for the risk of cancer with different definitions of prediabetes. In a site-specific cancer analysis, prediabetes was significantly associated with increased risks of cancer of the stomach/colorectum, liver, pancreas, breast and endometrium (all p < 0.05), but not associated with cancer of the bronchus/lung, prostate, ovary, kidney or bladder. The risks of site-specific cancer were significantly different (p = 0.01) and were highest for liver, endometrial and stomach/colorectal cancer.

The specific objective of this article is to investigate whether low-dose Dox treatment had pro-autophagic effects in cardiomyocytes as well as osteosarcoma cells.  Methods:   This study characterises apoptotic (Bax) and autophagic (Beclin-1) biomarker levels in human OS and cardiomyocyte cell lines as well as in various tissues when mice are exposed to low (1 mg/kg, thrice weekly) and high (3 mg/kg thrice weekly) dose Dox for a month.  Key findings:   There was a decrease in Bax and increase in Beclin-1 in cardiac tissue in the high-dose group. Dox decreased Beclin-1 in the skin and liver, with no clear indication in the stomach, small intestine and testis. At low Dox doses of 10 and 100 nm in cardiomyocytes and OS cells, there is a pro-apoptotic effect, with a quicker response in the 100-nm condition, and a slower but steady increase of a pro-apoptotic response at the lower 10-nm dose. However, electron microscopy images revealed changes to human OS cells that resembled autophagy. Human prostate, breast and colorectal cells treated with 10-nm Dox showed ∼ 40% reduction in cell viability after 24 h.  Conclusion:   In culture, cells of both cardiomyocytes and OS revealed a predominant pro-apoptotic response at the expense of autophagy, although both seemed to be occurring in vivo.""","""['Oktay Tacar', 'Sivanjah Indumathy', 'Mei Lin Tan', 'Swati Baindur-Hudson', 'Anna M Friedhuber', 'Crispin R Dass']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Pharm Pharmacol""","""['Evidences for the mechanism of Shenmai injection antagonizing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.', 'Doxorubicin-induced death in tumour cells and cardiomyocytes: is autophagy the key to improving future clinical outcomes?', 'A novel derivative of doxorubicin, AD198, inhibits canine transitional cell carcinoma and osteosarcoma cells in vitro.', 'Ghrelin inhibits doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by inhibiting excessive autophagy through AMPK and p38-MAPK.', 'Autophagic dysregulation in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy.', 'Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor: Inhibition of Phosphorylation of Insulin Receptor (IR)/IR Substrate (IRS), Osteogeneration from Adipocytes, and Increased Levels Due to Doxorubicin Exposure.', 'Nauclea orientalis (L.)

Methods:   From 2000 to 2011, 164 patients were treated with salvage radiotherapy alone for recurrent prostate cancer. Patients who received androgen deprivation therapy before or within 1 month of the termination of salvage radiotherapy were excluded. Survival analysis was carried out with: (i) a selected prostate-specific antigen reference value (0.2 ng/mL) at the second follow-up period (4 months) after salvage radiotherapy (prostate-specific antigen value over 0.2 ng/mL at post-salvage radiotherapy 4 months); and (ii) prostate-specific antigen percent decline (post-salvage radiotherapy 4 months prostate-specific antigen/pre-salvage radiotherapy prostate-specific antigen).  Results:   The median follow-up time was 53.4 months (range 8.5-134.1 months). The 5-year clinical recurrence-free survival was 87.9%. Prostate-specific antigen percent decline of 0.45 was set as the cut-off value for clinical recurrence-free survival based on the receiver operating characteristics curve. In the multivariate analysis, a prostate-specific antigen value over 0.2 ng/mL at post-salvage radiotherapy 4 months (P = 0.013) and prostate-specific antigen percent decline ≥ 0.45 (P = 0.002) were both significant parameters predicting clinical recurrence-free survival. Otherwise, prostate-specific antigen percent decline ≥ 0.45 was the only statistically significant predictor of biochemical failure-free survival (biochemical failure-free survival after salvage radiotherapy).  Conclusions:   A prostate-specific antigen value over 0.2 ng/mL at post-salvage radiotherapy 4 months and prostate-specific antigen percent decline ≥ 0.45 are negative predictors of clinical recurrence-free survival after salvage radiotherapy. Prostate-specific antigen percent decline ≥ 0.45 is also associated with worse biochemical failure-free survival after salvage radiotherapy.

The slow-release DNPs localised to the endoplasmic reticulum disrupted the mitochondria and entered the nucleus. Prominent cytosolic vacuolisation, budding off of portions of the cytoplasm, both suggestive of autophagy, were observed.

Methods:   In the Metabolic Syndrome and Cancer Project, prospective data on body mass index, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were collected from 285,040 men.

In the first phase the AXB algorithm was benchmarked against point dosimetry, film dosimetry, and full MC calculation in a water-filled anthropometric phantom with a unilateral hip implant. Also the validity of the full MC calculation used as reference method was demonstrated.

In the second phase, a clinical treatment plan was prepared for a prostate cancer patient with a unilateral hip implant. The plan applied a hybrid VMAT technique that included partial arcs that avoided passing through the implant and static beams traversing the implant. Ultimately, the AXB-calculated dose distribution was compared to the recalculation by the full MC simulation to assess the accuracy of the AXB algorithm in clinical setting.

To evaluate the magnitude of deviations from the predicted dose over an entire treatment course with MLC leaf calibrations performed every two weeks, we tracked weekly changes in relative dose error distributions measured with two-dimensional (2D) beam-by-beam analysis. We compared the dosimetric results from 20 consecutive patient-specific IMRT quality assurance (QA) tests using beam-by-beam analysis and a 2D diode detector array to the dose plans calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS).

To validate the prediction method, the predicted doses and dose distributions were compared to the measurements using an ionization chamber and film. The predicted doses were in good agreement, within 2% of the measured doses, and the predicted dose distributions also presented good agreement with the measured distributions. Dose verification results measured once as a pretreatment QA test were not completely stable, as results of weekly beam-by-beam analysis showed some variation. Because dosimetric errors throughout the treatment course were averaged, the overall dosimetric impact to patients was small.""","""['Iori Sumida', 'Hajime Yamaguchi', 'Hisao Kizaki', 'Keiko Aboshi', 'Yuji Yamada', 'Yasuo Yoshioka', 'Kazuhiko Ogawa']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Stereotactic IMRT for prostate cancer: dosimetric impact of multileaf collimator leaf width in the treatment of prostate cancer with IMRT.', 'Incorporation of gantry angle correction for 3D dose prediction in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Commissioning and quality assurance of a commercial stereotactic treatment-planning system for extracranial IMRT.', 'Dosimetric verification for intensity-modulated arc therapy plans by use of 2D diode array, radiochromic film and radiosensitive polymer gel.', 'Dosimetric impact of geometric errors due to respiratory motion prediction on dynamic multileaf collimator-based four-dimensional radiation delivery.', 'Comparison of gamma index based on dosimetric error and clinically relevant dose-volume index based on three-dimensional dose prediction in breast intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Three-dimensional dose prediction and validation with the radiobiological gamma index based on a relative seriality model for head-and-neck IMRT.', 'Organ-specific modulation complexity score for the evaluation of dose delivery.', 'Evaluation of the radiobiological gamma index with motion interplay in tangential IMRT breast treatment.', 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy dose verification using fluence and portal imaging device.']"""

The purpose of this study is to show the clinical impact caused by the choice of detector with respect to its ability to accurately measure dose in the penumbra and tail regions of a scanned profile. Using scan data acquired with several detectors, including an IBA CC13, a PTW 60012, and a Sun Nuclear EDGE Detector, three complete beam models are created, one for each respective detector. Next, using each beam model, dose volumes are retrospectively recalculated from actual anonymous patient plans. These plans include three full-arc VMAT prostate plans, three left chest wall plans delivered using irregular compensators, two half-arc VMAT lung plans, three MLC-collimated static-field pairs, and two SBRT liver plans. Finally, plans are reweighted to deliver the same number of monitor units, and mean dose-to-target volumes and organs at risk are calculated and compared. Penumbra width did not play a role. Dose in the tail region of the profile made the largest difference. By overresponding in the tail region of the profile, the 60012 diode detector scan data affected the beam model in such a way that target doses were reduced by as much as 0.4% (in comparison to CC13 and EDGE data). This overresponse also resulted in an overestimation of dose to peripheral critical structure, whose dose consisted mainly of scatter. This study shows that, for modeling the 6 MV beam of Acuros XB in Eclipse Version 11, the choice to use a CC13 scanning ion chamber or an EDGE Detector was an unimportant choice, providing nearly identical models in the treatment planning system.""","""['Jacob A Gersh', 'Ryan C M Best', 'Ronald J Watts']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric impact of different CT datasets for stereotactic treatment planning using 3D conformal radiotherapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Impact of IMRT and leaf width on stereotactic body radiotherapy of liver and lung lesions.', 'Development and clinical evaluation of an ionization chamber array with 3.5 mm pixel pitch for quality assurance in advanced radiotherapy techniques.', 'Impact of detector selections on inter-institutional variability of flattening filter-free beam data for TrueBeam™ linear accelerators.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'Assessment of beam-matched linacs quality/accuracy for interchanging SBRT or SRT patient using VMAT without replanning.', 'Analysis of small field percent depth dose and profiles: Comparison of measurements with various detectors and effects of detector orientation with different jaw settings.']"""

The average values of two senior radiation oncologists, considered to be expert observers, were selected as reference. The remaining nine observers were divided into two groups, Group 1 and Group 2, with more and less than one year of experience, respectively. The recorded shifts in prostate position were divided in three classes: &lt;3 mm, 3-5 mm, and &gt; 5 mm. Deviations from reference were less than 3 mm in all directions in 91% and 81% of measurements in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. The maximum difference in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) was reported for superior-inferior (SI) direction, in particular a mean difference of 3.24 mm was observed for Group 2 in respect to the reference; moreover RMSE was 1 and 1.3 mm higher for Group 2 for anterior-posterior (AP) and left-right (LR) directions, respectively.

The dose from imaging protocols for a range of imaging parameters and treatment sites was evaluated. Conventional CT dosimetry using 100 mm long pencil chambers has been shown to be inadequate for the large fields in CBCT and has been replaced in this work by a combination of point dose and integral dose. Absolute dose measurements were made with a small volume ion chamber at the central slice of a radiotherapy phantom. Beam profiles were measured using a linear diode array large enough to capture the entire imaging field. These profiles were normalized to absolute dose to form dose line integrals, which were then weighted with radial depth to form the DLPCBCT. This metric is analogous to the standard dose length product (DLP), but derived differently to suit the unique properties of CBCT. Imaging protocols for head and neck, chest, and prostate sites delivered absolute doses of 0.9, 2.2, and 2.9 cGy to the center of the phantom, and DLPCBCT of 28.2, 665.1, and 565.3mGy.cm, respectively. Results are displayed as dose per 100 mAs and as a function of key imaging parameters such as kVp, mAs, and collimator selection in a summary table. DLPCBCT was found to correlate closely with the dimension of the imaging region and provided a good indication of integral dose. It is important to assess integral dose when determining radiation doses to patients using CBCT. By incorporating measured beam profiles and DLP, this technique provides a CBCT dosimetry in radiotherapy phantoms and allows the prediction of imaging dose for new CBCT protocols.""","""['Daniel Scandurra', 'Catherine E Lawford']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Development and validation of a measurement-based source model for kilovoltage cone-beam CT Monte Carlo dosimetry simulations.', 'Computed tomography dose index and dose length product for cone-beam CT: Monte Carlo simulations.', 'Influence of cone beam CT (CBCT) scan parameters on size specific dose estimate (SSDE): a Monte Carlo study.', 'Imaging dose from cone beam computed tomography in radiation therapy.', 'A review of dental cone-beam CT dose conversion coefficients.', 'Investigation of the radiation dose from cone-beam CT for image-guided radiotherapy: A comparison of methodologies.', 'Computed tomography dosimetry with high-resolution detectors commonly used in radiotherapy - an energy dependence study.']"""

A total of ten patient plans were selected from a regular fractionation plan to complex SBRT plans. Treatment sites in the lung and abdomen were chosen to explore the effects of tissue heterogeneity on the respective dose reconstruction algorithms. Single- and multiple-arc VMAT plans were generated to achieve the desired target objectives. Delivered plan in the patient geometry was reconstructed by using ArcCHECK Planned Dose Perturbation (ACPDP) within 3DVH software, and by converting the machine log file to Pinnacle3 9.0 treatment plan format and recalculating dose with CVSP algorithm. In addition, delivered gantry angles between machine log file and 3DVH 4D measurement were also compared to evaluate the accuracy of the virtual inclinometer within the 3DVH. Measured ion chamber and 3DVH-derived isocenter dose agreed with planned dose within 0.4% ± 1.2% and -1.0% ± 1.6%, respectively. 3D gamma analysis showed greater than 98% between log files and 3DVH reconstructed dose. Machine log file reconstructed doses and TPS dose agreed to within 2% in PTV and OARs over the entire treatment. 3DVH reconstructed dose showed an average maximum dose difference of 3% ± 1.2% in PTV, and an average mean difference of -4.5% ± 10.5% in OAR doses. The average virtual inclinometer error (VIE) was -0.65° ± 1.6° for all patients, with a maximum error of -5.16° ± 4.54° for an SRS case. The time averaged VIE was within 1°-2°, and did not have a large impact on the overall accuracy of the estimated patient dose from ACPDP algorithm. In this study, we have compared two independent dose reconstruction methods for VMAT QA. Both methods are capable of taking into account the measurement and delivery parameter discrepancy, and display the delivered dose in CT patient geometry rather than the phantom geometry. The dose discrepancy can be evaluated in terms of DVH of the structures and provides a more intuitive understanding of the dosimetric impact of the delivery errors on the target and normal structure dose.""","""['Neelam Tyagi', 'Kai Yang', 'Di Yan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Comparison of DVH-based plan verification methods for VMAT: ArcCHECK-3DVH system and dynalog-based dose reconstruction.', 'Initial experience of ArcCHECK and 3DVH software for RapidArc treatment plan verification.', 'VMAT QA: measurement-guided 4D dose reconstruction on a patient.', 'Correlation of phantom-based and log file patient-specific QA with complexity scores for VMAT.', 'Patient-Specific Quality Assurance Using Monte Carlo Dose Calculation and Elekta Log Files for Prostate Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy.', 'Development of Automated Delivery Quality Assurance Analysis Software for Helical Tomotherapy.', 'Evaluating Mobius3D Dose Calculation Accuracy for Small-Field Flattening- Filter-Free Photon Beams.', 'Comprehensive clinical evaluation of TomoEQA for patient-specific pre-treatment quality assurance in helical tomotherapy.', 'Insensitivity of machine log files to MLC leaf backlash and effect of MLC backlash on clinical dynamic MLC motion: An experimental investigation.', 'Novel methodologies for dosimetry audits: Adapting to advanced radiotherapy techniques.']"""

VMAT vs. IMRT Pareto front comparison was additionally performed in order to benchmark the optimizer efficiency and VMAT plan quality for each TPS. Three prostate and three head and neck cancer patients were selected for nine-beam IMRT and single-arc VMAT planning in Monaco 3.00 and Oncentra MasterPlan (OMP) 3.3 planning systems. Pareto fronts for prostate cases were constructed based on PTV coverage by 95% isodose and volume of rectum receiving 60 Gy or more. For head and neck cases, PTV coverage by the same isodose and mean dose to parotid gland were used for the construction of Pareto fronts. DVH analysis was performed together with evaluation of planning and delivery efficiency for all the plans. In the intersystem comparison for prostate plans, Monaco generated very similar IMRT and VMAT solutions. Quality of Monaco VMAT plans was superior compared to Oncentra in terms of conformity, homogeneity, and lower median dose to bladder due to biological formalism of optimization cost functions. For the head and neck cases, IMRT and VMAT plans were similar in both systems, except the case where a very strong modulation was required. In this situation single-arc VMAT plan generated with OMP was inferior compared to IMRT. VMAT OMP solutions were similar to Monaco or slightly better for two less-modulated head and neck cases. However, this advantage was achieved on the cost of lower conformity and homogeneity of the Oncentra VMAT plans. IMRT and VMAT solutions generated by Monaco were very similar for both prostate and head and neck cases. Oncentra system shows a bigger difference, and use of the dual-arc VMAT would be recommended to achieve the same plan quality as nine-field IMRT. Biological optimization seems beneficial in terms of plan conformity and homogeneity and allowed achieving lower OAR doses for prostate cases. In complex anatomical situations represented by head and neck cases, sequencing algorithm in Monaco imposed limitations on VMAT plan quality in the intersystem comparison.""","""['Vadzim Pyshniak', 'Irina Fotina', 'Alena Zverava', 'Stanislau Siamkouski', 'Elena Zayats', 'Georgy Kopanitsa', 'Dzmitry Okuntsau']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Multicriteria optimization informed VMAT planning.', 'Assessing the feasibility of volumetric-modulated arc therapy using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB-VMAT): An analysis for complex head-neck, high-risk prostate and rectal cancer cases.', 'Dosimetric comparison of two treatment planning systems for spine SBRT.', 'Dosimetric comparison between Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) vs dual arc Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT) for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC): Systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT): a review of clinical outcomes-what is the clinical evidence for the most effective implementation?', 'A study of minimum segment width parameter on VMAT plan quality, delivery accuracy, and efficiency for cervical cancer using Monaco TPS.', 'The effect of body contouring on the dose distribution delivered with volumetric-modulated arc therapy technique.']"""

Hypothesizing that patients diagnosed with one of these malignancies were more likely to be diagnosed with the other, we examined the coupling of diagnoses of prostate and thyroid cancer in a large US administrative dataset.  Methods:   The surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database was used to identify men diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer (CaP) or thyroid cancer between 1995 and 2010. SEER*stat software was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and investigate the rates of subsequent malignancy diagnosis.

Results:   Patients with thyroid cancer were much more likely to be diagnosed with CaP than patients in the SEER control group (SIR 1.28 [95% CI 1.1-1.5]; p < 0.05). Similarly, the observed incidence of thyroid cancer was significantly higher in patients with CaP when compared with SEER controls (SIR 1.30 [95% CI 1.2-1.4]; p < 0.05). When stratified by follow-up interval, the observed thyroid cancer diagnosis rate among men with CaP was significantly higher than expected at 2-11 (SIR 1.83 [95% CI 1.4-2.4]), 12-59 (SIR 1.24 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]), and 60-119 (SIR 1.25 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]) months of follow-up. There was no increased risk of CaP or thyroid cancer diagnosis among patients with non-urologic malignancies.

Methods:   We examined 70 patients who presented consecutively for consideration of brachytherapy for favorable-risk prostate cancer who had volume estimates by three methods: contoured axial ultrasound slices, ultrasound ellipsoid (height × width × length × 0.523) calculation, and endorectal coil MRI (erMRI) ellipsoid calculation.  Results:   Average gland size by the contoured ultrasound, ellipsoid ultrasound, and erMRI methods were 33.99, 37.16, and 39.62 mLs, respectively.

PCTAIRE1 was not similarly involved in proliferation of nontransformed cells, including diploid human IMR-90 fibroblasts. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified tumor suppressor p27 as a PCTAIRE1 interactor. In vitro kinase assays showed PCTAIRE1 phosphorylates p27 at Ser10. PCTAIRE1 silencing modulated Ser10 phosphorylation on p27 and led to its accumulation in cancer cells but not in nontransformed cells. In a mouse xenograft model of PPC1 prostate cancer, conditional silencing of PCTAIRE1 restored p27 protein expression and suppressed tumor growth. Mechanistic studies in HeLa cells showed that PCTAIRE1 phosphorylates p27 during the S and M phases of the cell cycle. Notably, p27 silencing was sufficient to rescue cells from mitotic arrest caused by PCTAIRE1 silencing.

Hence, studying the gene expression profile and the presence of SPOP mutations in PCa and understanding its clinico-pathological significance as prognostic and therapeutic biomarker are important to further understand its role in PCa development.  Patients and methods:   A cohort of 265 paraffin-embedded PCa samples from patients with more than 5 years of follow-up and treated with radical prostatectomy were collected at our institution for SPOP evaluation. RT-qPCR analysis was performed for expression studies while mutations were assessed by next generation sequencing. Relationship with prognosis was analysed using log-rank analysis and multivariable Cox regression.  Results:   SPOP was found to be strongly down-regulated in PCa (median=0.24; range=0.04-9.98) and its expression was associated with both, biochemical (p=0.003) and clinical progression free survival (p=0.023), the very low SPOP expression levels being associated to the worst prognosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low levels of SPOP independently predicted a worse prognosis for both, biochemical (Hazard ratio (HR)=0.5; confidence interval (CI) 95% [0.4-0.9], p=0.011) and clinical progression (HR=0.6; IC 95% [0.4-1], p=0.046).

Objective:   To determine whether post-diagnostic use of beta-blockers is associated with prostate cancer mortality and all-cause mortality.  Patients and methods:   A cohort of 6270 men newly-diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer between 1st April 1998, and 31st December 2009, followed until 1st October 2012, was identified using large population-based electronic databases from the United Kingdom. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality outcomes associated with post-diagnostic use of beta-blockers. Secondary analyses were performed to examine the independent effects of non-selective beta-blockers, as well as cumulative duration of use.  Results:   During a mean follow-up time of 3.8 years (standard deviation: 2.7 years), 1761 deaths occurred, including 715 from prostate cancer. Post-diagnostic use of beta-blockers was not associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer mortality (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.72-1.31) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.81-1.16).

We performed population pharmacokinetic analyses to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters after oral administration of 1,000 mg/day of abiraterone acetate in patients with mCRPC, with or without prior chemotherapy, and after a single 1,000 mg dose in healthy volunteers. The study objectives were to determine consistency between patient populations and to characterize factors that may influence abiraterone pharmacokinetics.  Methods:   Studies in this analysis included COU-AA-302 (chemotherapy naïve); COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-006 (chemotherapy pretreated); and COU-AA-008, COU-AA-009, and COU-AA-014 (healthy subjects). A total of 4,627 plasma concentrations from 359 subjects (62 healthy volunteers, 297 patients) were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling.  Results:   An Erlang-type absorption model with first-order elimination and three-transit compartments following sequential zero- and first-order processes was used to characterize abiraterone pharmacokinetics. Absorption-related parameters were affected by food intake. Abiraterone pharmacokinetics were characterized by an extensive apparent clearance, which was lower in patients with mCRPC (1,550 L/h) versus healthy subjects (2,240 L/h), and by large apparent central (5,620 L) and peripheral (17,400 L) volumes of distribution. Abiraterone pharmacokinetics were similar in chemotherapy-pretreated and -naïve patients and were characterized by a high between- and within-subject variability [e.g., between-subject coefficient of variation (CV%) for relative bioavailability for the modified fasting state was 61.1% and the CV% for within-subject variability was 71.3%]. The fat content of food taken with abiraterone acetate affected the bioavailability of abiraterone. No factors beyond food intake and health status (healthy vs. mCRPC) impacted abiraterone pharmacokinetics.  Conclusions:   Based on the pharmacokinetics model, the recommended 1,000 mg/day of abiraterone acetate resulted in similar abiraterone exposure for patients with mCRPC regardless of prior chemotherapy. The fat content of food affected relative bioavailability of abiraterone, though the extent of this effect is dependent on health status.""","""['Kim Stuyckens', 'Fred Saad', 'Xu Steven Xu', 'Charles J Ryan', 'Matthew R Smith', 'Thomas W Griffin', 'Margaret K Yu', 'An Vermeulen', 'Partha Nandy', 'Italo Poggesi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Pharmacokinet""","""['Updated interim efficacy analysis and long-term safety of abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients without prior chemotherapy (COU-AA-302).', 'Subsequent Chemotherapy and Treatment Patterns After Abiraterone Acetate in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'Prior Endocrine Therapy Impact on Abiraterone Acetate Clinical Efficacy in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post-hoc Analysis of Randomised Phase 3 Studies.', 'Enzalutamide versus abiraterone acetate for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'Systematic Development of Solid Lipid Nanoparticles of Abiraterone Acetate with Improved Oral Bioavailability and Anticancer Activity for Prostate Carcinoma Treatment.', 'The effect of chemotherapy on the exposure-response relation of abiraterone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Optimizing outcomes for patients with metastatic prostate cancer: insights from South East Asia Expert Panel.', 'Liquid biopsy reveals KLK3 mRNA as a prognostic marker for progression free survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer undergoing first-line abiraterone acetate and prednisone treatment.', 'Therapeutic drug monitoring of oral targeted antineoplastic drugs.']"""

A grounded theory approach was used to collect and analyse the data. Regardless of the point at which they were interviewed four areas emerged as important to the men: the pathway to diagnosis; the diagnosis; the impact of prostate cancer and its treatment on daily life; and living with prostate cancer. Prostate cancer was diagnosed using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, rectal examination and biopsy. Many men did not understand the consequences of a high PSA reading before they undertook the test. Painful investigative biopsies were viewed as the worst part of the disease experience. Radiotherapy was considered less invasive than other treatments, although preparatory regimes were associated with stress and inconvenience.

Methods:   We report on 171 relapsing patients after RP who had undergone an erMRI before SRT. 64 Gy were prescribed to the prostatic bed with, in addition, a boost of 10 Gy to the suspected local relapse as detected on erMRI in 131 patients (76.6%).  Results:   The 3-year biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), local relapse-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival were 64.2±4.3%, 100%, 85.2±3.2%, 100%, and 99.1±0.9%, respectively.

The presence of two main types of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcripts in CaP specimens, Type I and Type II, prompted us to hypothesize that the cumulative actions of different ERG variants may impact CaP development/progression. Using TMPRSS2-ERG3 (Type I) and TMPRSS2-ERG8 (Type II) expression vectors, we determined that the TMPRSS2- ERG8 encoded protein is deficient in transcriptional regulation compared to TMPRSS2-ERG3. Co-transfection of vectors resulted in decreased transcriptional regulation compared to TMPRSS2-ERG3 alone, suggesting transdominance of ERG8. Expression of exogenous ERG8 protein resulted in a decrease in endogenous ERG3 protein levels in TMPRSS2-ERG positive VCaP cells, with a concomitant decrease in C-MYC. Further, we showed a physical association between ERG3 and ERG8 in live cells by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, providing a basis for the observed effects. Inhibitory effects of TMPRSS2-ERG8 on TMPRSS2- ERG3 were also corroborated by gene expression data from human prostate cancers, which showed a positive correlation between C-MYC expression and TMPRSS2-ERG3/TMPRSS2- ERG8 ratio.

GASC1, member of the histone demethylases affecting heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression, has been found to be dysregulation in many types of cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, metastatic lung sarcomatoid carcinoma, and leukemia. In this study, we examined the expression of GASC1 and certain GASC1-targeted genes (KLF4, MYC, SOX2, PPARG, MDM2, and NANOG) and identified a three-gene prognostic signature (PPARG, MDM2, and NANOG), using risk scores based on immunohistochemical analyses of 149 tumor specimens from patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The presence of a high-risk three-gene signature in the ESCC tumors was significantly associated with decreased overall survival (OS) of the patients. We validated the predictive value of the three-gene signature in a second independent cohort of 101 patients with ESCC in order to determine whether it had predictive value. The results were similar to those in 149 patients. According to multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses, the predictive model of a three-gene signature was an independent predictor for OS (p = 0.005 in cohort 1, p = 0.025 in cohort 2). In addition, ROC analysis indicated that the predictive ability of the three-gene model was more robust than that of a single biomarker.

In vivo biodistribution of the (64)Cu/NOTA-ML peptide evaluated in athymic nude mice bearing xenografts of two human prostate carcinoma cell lines showed a rapid and high uptake in PACE4-expressing LNCaP tumor at an early time point and in PACE4-rich organs. Co-injection of unlabeled peptide confirmed that tumor uptake was target-specific. PACE4-negative tumors displayed no tracer uptake 15 minutes after injection, while the kidneys, demonstrated high uptake due to rapid renal clearance of the peptide.

However, the mechanism by which ARV expression is regulated is not fully understood. In this study, we show that the activation of classical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling increases the expression of ARVs in prostate cancer (PCa) cells and converts androgen-sensitive PCa cells to become androgen-insensitive, whereas downregulation of NF-κB signaling inhibits ARV expression and restores responsiveness of CRPC to anti-androgen therapy. In addition, we demonstrated that combination of anti-androgen with NF-κB-targeted therapy inhibits efficiently tumor growth of human CRPC xenografts. These results indicate that induction of ARVs by activated NF-κB signaling in PCa cells is a critical mechanism by which the PCa progresses to CRPC. This has important implications as it can prolong the survival of CRPC patients by restoring the tumors to once again respond to conventional androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).""","""['R Jin', 'H Yamashita', 'X Yu', 'J Wang', 'O E Franco', 'Y Wang', 'S W Hayward', 'R J Matusik']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['CX4945 suppresses the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by reducing AR-V7 expression.', 'Activation of GRP/GRP-R signaling contributes to castration-resistant prostate cancer progression.', 'Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'NF-κB signaling promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Androgen Receptor Upregulates Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue 1 to Induce NF-κB Activity via Androgen-Dependent and -Independent Pathways in Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'LOX-1 Activation by oxLDL Induces AR and AR-V7 Expression via NF-κB and STAT3 Signaling Pathways Reducing Enzalutamide Cytotoxic Effects.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Sulfatase-2 from Cancer Associated Fibroblasts: An Environmental Target for Hepatocellular Carcinoma?', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?']"""

Following the androgen receptor (AR) pathway, it is the second major driver of PCa growth.  Objective:   To assess efficacy of novel PI3K/AKT-targeted therapies in PCa models, as a single agent and in combination with androgen deprivation.  Design, setting, and participants:   Twelve human PCa cell lines were tested in vitro for sensitivity to the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 and the PI3K beta/delta inhibitor AZD8186. The combination of AZD5363 and AZD8186 with castration was evaluated in vivo in PTEN-negative versus PTEN-positive patient-derived xenografts. Tumors and plasma were collected for biomarker analysis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   In vitro growth inhibition was determined by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. In vivo efficacy was monitored by caliper measurements of subcutaneous tumor volume. PI3K/AKT and AR pathway activity was analyzed by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.  Results and limitations:   AZD5363 and AZD8186 inhibited in vitro growth of 10 of 12 and 7 of 12 PCa cell lines, respectively, with increased sensitivity under androgen depletion. In vivo, AZD5363 and AZD8186 as single agents significantly inhibited growth of PTEN-negative PC346C xenografts compared to placebo by 60% and 66%, respectively. Importantly, combination of either agent with castration resulted in long-lasting tumor regression, which persisted after treatment cessation. Expression of AR-target genes kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3, also known as PSA); transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2); and FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) was upregulated after PI3K/AKT inhibition. Neither compound inhibited tumor growth in the PTEN-positive PC310 model.  Conclusions:   Combination with hormonal therapy improved efficacy of PI3K/AKT-targeted agents in PTEN-negative PCa models. Upregulation of AR-target genes upon PI3K/AKT inhibition suggests a compensatory crosstalk between the PI3K-AR pathways. These data strongly advocate for further clinical evaluation.  Patient summary:   Inactivation of the PTEN gene is a common event promoting prostate cancer (PCa) progression. This preclinical study illustrates the potent anticancer activity of novel PTEN-targeted drugs on PCa models, particularly in combination with hormonal therapy.""","""['Rute B Marques', 'Ashraf Aghai', 'Corrina M A de Ridder', 'Debra Stuurman', 'Sander Hoeben', 'Agnes Boer', 'Rebecca P Ellston', 'Simon T Barry', 'Barry R Davies', 'Jan Trapman', 'Wytske M van Weerden']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Combination AZD5363 with Enzalutamide Significantly Delays Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer in Preclinical Models.', 'Inhibition of PI3Kβ signaling with AZD8186 inhibits growth of PTEN-deficient breast and prostate tumors alone and in combination with docetaxel.', 'Synergistic targeting of PI3K/AKT pathway and androgen receptor axis significantly delays castration-resistant prostate cancer progression in vivo.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'hsa_circ_0000417 downregulation suppresses androgen receptor expression and apoptotic signals in human foreskin fibroblasts via sponging miR-6756-5p.', ""The Plant Derived 3-3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) Behaves as CB2 Receptor Agonist in Prostate Cancer Cellular Models."", 'Development and safety of PI3K inhibitors in cancer.', 'Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.']"""

The prognostic value of the ER(α) and ER(β) and AR was assessed in terms of recurrence, progression, and survival. AR expression was not associated with any of the above parameters; however, both ERs correlated with the prognosis. A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that ER(α) positive staining was significantly associated with a greater hazard for all outcomes. Increased ER(β) staining was significantly associated with a lower hazard for all outcomes in the univariate analysis. When both ER HSCORES were used for the analysis, it was found that patients with high ER(α) or low ER(β) HSCORES compared with patients with negatively stained ER(α) and >1.7 hSCORE ER(β) had 6.03, 10.93, and 10.53 times greater hazard for biochemical disease recurrence, progression of disease and death, respectively. Multiple Cox proportional hazard analyses showed that the age, preoperative prostate specific antigen, Gleason score and ERs were independent predictors of all outcomes.

PSGR1 expression is elevated both in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue and in prostate cancer. Stimulation of PSGR1 by the odorant β-ionone leads to an increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and a decrease in prostate cancer cell proliferation. To further extend our knowledge about PSGR1 signaling in prostate cancer cells, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteomics study using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and mass spectrometry. We report 51 differentially regulated phosphorylation sites in 24 proteins with functions in cytoskeletal remodeling, signaling and ion transport. Activation of PSGR1 evoked an increase in intracellular pH mediated by the sodium/hydrogen exchanger NHE1. Furthermore, we report the protein tyrosine kinase Pyk2 as a central effector of PSGR1 signaling cascades in LNCaP cells. Our data show that phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase is triggered by Pyk2. In addition, we confirmed dephosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) at Ser330 downstream of Pyk2. Since NDRG1 impacts oncogenic signaling pathways interfering with tumor progression, we suggest that the Pyk2-NDRG1 axis is possibly involved in conveying the anti-proliferative effect of β-ionone in prostate cancer cells.

Therefore, we hypothesized that CTC TA may be prognostic of overall survival (OS) in mCRPC. To test this, we used a novel Parylene-C slot microfilter to measure live CTC TA in S0421, a phase III SWOG-led therapeutic trial. Blood samples underwent CTC capture and TA measurement by microfilter, as well as parallel enumeration by CellSearch (Janssen/J&J). Cox regression was used to assess baseline (pre-treatment) TA versus OS, and recursive partitioning was used to explore potential prognostic subgroups and to generate Kaplan-Meier (KM) OS curves. Samples were obtained from 263 patients and generated 215 TA measures. In patients with baseline CTC count ≥5 (47% of patients), higher CTC TA was associated with hazard ratio 1.14 (p = 0.001) for OS after adjusting for other clinical covariates including CTC counts and serum PSA at study entry. Recursive partitioning identified new candidate risk groups with KM OS curve separation based on CTC counts and TA. Notably, in men with an intermediate range baseline CTC count (6-54 CTCs/7.5 ml), low versus high CTC TA was associated with median survival of 19 versus 12 months, respectively (p = 0.009). Baseline telomerase activity from CTCs live-captured on a new slot microfilter is the first CTC-derived candidate biomarker prognostic of OS in a large patient subgroup in a prospective clinical trial.

Data are lacking on prostate specific antigen in men with type 1 diabetes whose insulin and obesity profiles differ from those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study we examined the relationship between long-term glycemic control and prostate specific antigen in men with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Materials and methods:   Total prostate specific antigen was measured at one time in 639 men in the EDIC, the observational followup of participants in the DCCT. The relationship between DCCT/EDIC weighted mean hemoglobin A1c and log prostate specific antigen was assessed using linear regression modeling after adjusting for age, body mass index, total testosterone, statin and thiazide medication use, diabetes duration, and DCCT randomization arm and cohort.  Results:   Median subject age was 52 years, body mass index was 28.4 kg/m(2) and DCCT/EDIC time-weighted hemoglobin A1c was 7.9%. Median prostate specific antigen was 0.64 ng/ml (IQR 0.43, 1.05). Prostate specific antigen increased significantly with age (p <0.0001) and with lower time-weighted hemoglobin A1c (p <0.0001). Each 10% increase in hemoglobin A1c was accompanied by an 11% reduction in prostate specific antigen (p=0.0001).  Conclusions:   Prostate specific antigen decreases as hemoglobin A1c increases in men with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

A simulated patient study""","""Background:   Patients treated for prostate cancer may present to general practitioners (GPs) for treatment follow up, but may be reticent to have their consultations recorded. Therefore the use of simulated patients allows practitioner consultations to be rated. The aim of this study was to determine whether the speciality of the assessor has an impact on how GP consultation performance is rated.  Methods:   Six pairs of scenarios were developed for professional actors in two series of consultations by GPs. The scenarios included: chronic radiation proctitis, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) 'bounce', recurrence of cancer, urethral stricture, erectile dysfunction and depression or anxiety. Participating GPs were furnished with the patient's past medical history, current medication, prostate cancer details and treatment, details of physical examinations. Consultations were video recorded and assessed for quality by two sets of assessors- a team of two GPs and two Radiation Oncologists deploying the Leicester Assessment Package (LAP). LAP scores by the GPs and Radiation Oncologists were compared.  Results:   Eight GPs participated. In Series 1 the range of LAP scores by GP assessors was 61%-80%, and 67%-86% for Radiation Oncologist assessors. The range for GP LAP scores in Series 2 was 51%- 82%, and 56%-89% for Radiation Oncologist assessors. Within GP assessor correlations for LAP scores were 0.31 and 0.87 in Series 1 and 2 respectively. Within Radiation Oncologist assessor correlations were 0.50 and 0.72 in Series 1 and 2 respectively. Radiation Oncologist and GP assessor scores were significantly different for 4 doctors and for some scenarios.

However, the sensitivity and specificity of AR for prostate cancer in the setting of other genitourinary neoplasms has not been rigorously studied.  Methods:   We employed tissue microarrays containing prostate carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, renal cell carcinomas, and testicular neoplasms. Slides were stained immunohistochemically for AR.  Results:   Androgen receptor was positive in 95% of prostate carcinomas (n=230), but 19% of invasive urothelial carcinomas of the bladder (n=190) and 33% of non-invasive bladder urothelial carcinomas were also AR positive (N=107). Furthermore, 16% of renal pelvis urothelial carcinomas (n=43) were positive. Of primary renal cell carcinomas, 19% were AR positive (n=307). From a metastatic renal cell carcinoma cohort, 28% of metastases were AR positive (N=126). Six percent of non-teratomatous testicular germ cell tumors stained for AR (n=103).  Conclusions:   Our data show that the sensitivity of AR immunohistochemistry for prostate cancer is 94.8%.

Apoptosis and necrosis are processes that are induced by changes in concentrations of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). This study aims to detect and quantify the cellular response to changing ROS concentrations in the scope of apoptosis and necrosis.  Methods:   Photobleaching of the fluorescent substrate fluorescein is used as a probe to detect the response of individual Jurkat-T-lymphocytes and Prostate-Cancer-3(PC-3) cells to oxidative stress, induced by hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). A kinetic model is proposed to describe changes in intracellular dye quantities due to photobleaching, dye hydrolysis, influx and leakage, yielding a single time-dependent decaying exponent+constant.  Results:   Fluorescein photobleaching is controlled and used to detect intracellular ROS. An increase in the decay time of fluorescence of intracellular fluorescein (slow photobleaching) was measured from cells incubated with H₂O₂ at 50 μM. At higher H₂O₂ concentrations a decrease in the decay time was measured (fast photobleaching), in contrast to in vitro results with fluorescein and H₂O₂ in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), where the addition of H₂O₂ decreases the decay time, regardless of the irradiation dose used.  Conclusions:   The anomalous, ROS-concentration dependent reduction of the photobleaching rate in cells, as opposed to solutions, might indicate on the regulation of the activity of intracellular oxidative-stress protective mechanisms, as seen earlier with other methods.  Significance:   Assessing photobleaching via the time decay of the fluorescence intensity of an ROS-sensitive fluorophore may be adapted to monitor oxidative stress or ROS-related processes in cells.""","""['Max Platkov', 'Reuven Tirosh', 'Menahem Kaufman', 'Naomi Zurgil', 'Mordechai Deutsch']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Photochem Photobiol B""","""['The use of sequential staining for detection of heterogeneous intracellular response of individual Jurkat cells to lysophosphatidylcholine.', 'Protective effect of polypeptides from larva of housefly (Musca domestica) on hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage in HepG2 cells.', 'Influence of fluorochrome labeling density on the photobleaching kinetics of fluorescein in microscopy.', 'Investigation on interaction and sonodynamic damage of fluorescein derivants to bovine serum albumin (BSA) under ultrasonic irradiation.', 'Which are you watching, an individual reactive oxygen species or total oxidative stress?', 'Differentiation of seborrheic keratosis from basal cell carcinoma, nevi and melanoma by RGB autofluorescence imaging.', 'A Dual Sensor for pH and Hydrogen Peroxide Using Polymer-Coated Optical Fibre Tips.']"""

However, funding limitations and excess bureaucracy are now making it difficult to conduct trials.  Objective:   To describe the collaborative groups in Europe and their academic phase 3 PCa trials.  Evidence acquisition:   Leaders of collaborative groups from Scandinavia, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Ireland were asked to provide information.  Evidence synthesis:   Approximately 40 academic European phase 3 trials focussing on PCa have been completed, and about 10 are accruing patients. Cross-border trials have been successfully conducted led by EORTC (11), Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (9), European Association of Urology (1), Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficiency (STAMPEDE) (1), and the French Genito-Urinary Tumor Group (1). Among these studies were practise-changing trials showing the superiority of prostatectomy over watchful waiting in patients <65 yr of age, the benefits of combining androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with radiation therapy (RXT) in high-risk localised disease, the superiority of long-term versus short-term ADT, the benefit of RXT in men treated with ADT, and the role of adjuvant RXT. To bridge the numbers gap for phase 3 studies, the Prostate Cancer Consortium in Europe (PEACE) is a recently established initiative that aims to favour cross-border networks of investigators. PEACE 1 is testing the addition of abiraterone and that of RXT directed at the primary cancer in patients with de novo metastatic PCa treated with ADT. PEACE 2 is testing the addition of cabazitaxel and that of pelvic irradiation in patients with at least two criteria for high-risk localised PCa.  Conclusions:   European academic phase 3 trials have contributed to establishing the current standard treatment of PCa. The PEACE consortium was recently tasked with the goal of addressing unanswered questions and specific biology-related issues more efficiently.

We previously showed that APP is a primary androgen-responsive gene in prostate cancer and that its increased expression is correlated with poor prognosis for patients with prostate cancer. APP has also been implicated in several human malignancies. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the pro-proliferative effects of APP on cancers is still not well-understood. In the present study, we explored a pathophysiological role for APP in prostate cancer cells using siRNA targeting APP (siAPP). The proliferation and migration of LNCaP and DU145 prostate cancer cells were significantly suppressed by siAPP. Differentially expressed genes in siAPP-treated cells compared to control siRNA-treated cells were identified by microarray analysis. Notably, several metalloproteinase genes, such as ADAM10 and ADAM17, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, such as VIM, and SNAI2, were downregulated in siAPP-treated cells as compared to control cells. The expression of these genes was upregulated in LNCaP cells stably expressing APP when compared with control cells. APP-overexpressing LNCaP cells exhibited enhanced migration in comparison to control cells. These results suggest that APP may contribute to the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells by modulating the expression of metalloproteinase and EMT-related genes.""","""['Toshiaki Miyazaki', 'Kazuhiro Ikeda', 'Kuniko Horie-Inoue', 'Satoshi Inoue']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['The transcription factor PAX2 regulates ADAM10 expression in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by ADAM10 mediates proliferation and migration in breast cancer.', 'Increase of disintergin metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'The Role of the anti-amyloidogenic secretase ADAM10 in shedding the APP-like proteins.', 'Interactions between APP secretases and inflammatory mediators.', 'Neuroprotective and anticancer effects of 7‑Methoxyheptaphylline via the TAK1 pathway.', 'Identification of Altered Proteins in the Plasma of Rats With Chronic Prostatic Inflammation Induced by Estradiol Benzoate and Sex Hormones.', 'Molecular Characteristics of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and Its Effects in Cancer.', 'β-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the human diseases.', 'Amyloid precursor protein regulates 5-fluorouracil resistance in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.']"""

We determine if this impacts on the clinical outcomes of RALP.  Methods:   218 consecutive patients underwent RALP were identified from a prospectively maintained RALP database recorded and compared for their demographics, clinical outcomes and adverse events in normal weight (BMI <25 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI ≥25 and <30 kg/m(2)) and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)) groups.  Results:   36 normal weight, 115 overweight and 67 obese patients were identified. There were no significant differences in demographic data among the three groups except for mean BMI (23.1 vs. 27.5 vs. 32.8 kg/m(2), p < 0.001). The median operative time was longer in obese patients compared to both overweight (210 vs. 189 min, p = 0.031) and normal weight (210 vs. 177 min, p = 0.008) patients. There were no significant differences in median estimated blood loss, mean prostate volume, positive surgical margin rate and time to continence without pads. The median urethral catheter duration and hospitalization were similar in all groups. Patients with elevated BMI had a significantly higher median Gleason score (p = 0.046) and incidence of pathologic T3 disease (p = 0.038). The incidence of adverse events was low and there were no significant differences among the three groups (p > 0.05).

Methods:   To address these hypotheses, we analyzed serial ovarian volume measurements determined by TVU for 29321 women (102787 scans) performed in the ovarian cancer screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) trial. Cox models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as measures of association between TVU results and ovarian cancer. We assessed whether increasing ovarian volume preceded diagnosis of ovarian cancer in a nested case-control analysis comparing case patients and control patients matched on age, center, and screening year (1:4 ratio). All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Visualization of normal-appearing ovaries at the last TVU scan was associated with marginally higher ovarian cancer risk compared with nonvisualization of the ovaries (HR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.01).

We tested the hypothesis that only specific mPCa patients would benefit from LT and that the potential benefit would vary based on primary tumor characteristics. A total of 8197 mPCa patients at diagnosis (M1a, M1b, and M1c) were identified using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2011) and were divided according to treatment type: LT versus nonlocal treatment of the primary tumor (NLT; either androgen deprivation therapy or observation). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to predict cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in patients that received NLT. To assess whether the benefit of LT was different by baseline risk, we tested an interaction with CSM risk and LT. At multivariable analysis, all predictors were significantly associated with CSM, and the interaction test was statistically significant (p<0.0001). Local treatment of the primary tumor, compared with NLT, conferred a higher CSM-free survival rate in patients with a predicted CSM risk <40%. The number needed to treat according to the predicted CSM risk at 3 yr after diagnosis remained substantially constant from 10% to 30%, whereas it exponentially increased for predicted CSM risk >40%. These results should serve as a foundation for future prospective trials.

Objective:   To compare the long-term UAE incidence across treatment and control groups.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using a matched-cohort design, we identified elderly men treated with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT; n=44 318), brachytherapy (BT; n=14 259), EBRT+BT (n=11 835), radical prostatectomy (RP; n=26 970), RP+EBRT (n=1557), or cryotherapy (n=2115) for non-metastatic prostate cancer and 144 816 non-cancer control individuals from the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data from 1992-2007 with follow-up through 2009.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   The incidence of treated UAEs and time from cancer treatment to first UAE were analyzed in terms of propensity-weighted survival.  Results:   Median follow-up was 4.14 yr. At 10 yr, all treatment groups experienced higher propensity-weighted cumulative UAE incidence than the control group (16.1%; hazard risk [HR] 1.0), with the highest incidence for RP+EBRT (37.8%; HR 3.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.79-3.66), followed by BT+EBRT (28.4%; HR 1.97, CI 1.85-2.10), RP (26.6%; HR 2.44, CI 2.34-2.55), cryotherapy (23.4%; HR 1.56, CI 1.30-1.87), BT (19.8%; HR 1.43, CI 1.33-1.53), and EBRT (19.7%; HR 1.11, CI 1.07-1.16). Bladder outlet obstruction was the most common event.  Conclusions:   Men undergoing RP, RP+EBRT, and BT+EBRT experienced the highest UAE risk at 10 yr, although UAEs accrued differently over extended follow-up. The significant background UAE rate among non-cancer control individuals yields a risk attributable to prostate cancer treatment that is 17% lower than prior estimates.

The aim of the present study is to elucidate whether the expression of AQP5 is a strong prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer, and the potential role in the progression of prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   AQP5 expression was measured in 60 prostate cancer tissues and cells (both PC-3 and LNCaP) by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assay. AQP5 gene amplification was detected with FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Proliferation and migration of cells and AQP5 siRNA cells were detected with MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) and Boyden chambers. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were detected by imFISH staining (CEP8-CD45-DAPI) assay.  Results:   The results showed that in 60 tumor specimens, 19 (31.7%) patients showed high level of AQP5 expression, while 30 (50.0%) showed a moderate, intermediate level of staining, and 11 (18.3%) showed an absence of AQP5 staining, respectively. High-expression of AQP5 protein frequently accompanied gene amplification detection with FISH. The AQP5 over-expression was also associated with TNM stage (P=0.042), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.001). The relationships between age or tumor size with the expression of AQP5 were not significant (P>0.05). A positive correlation between the number of CTCs and AQP5 expression (P<0.05) was demonstrated. In addition, patients who were negative for AQP5 had superior cumulative survival rate than those who were positive for it. Over-expression of AQP5 protein was also found in prostate cancer cells and cell proliferation and migration were significantly attenuated by AQP5-siRNA.  Conclusions:   We concluded that AQP5 in prostate cancer was an independent prognostic indicator. AQP5 over-expression was likely to play a role in cell growth and metastasis.

The androgen receptor (AR) and AR-agonists (androgens) are required for the development and progression of the normal prostate as well as PCa. However, it is discussed that in addition to their tumor promoting activity, androgens may also exhibit tumor suppressive effects. A biphasic growth response to androgens a growth-promoting and -inhibition has been observed that suggests that administration of supraphysiological androgen levels mediates growth reduction in AR expressing PCa cells.  Methods:   Detection of senescence markers, three dimensional interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D-iFISH), qRT-PCR, Western blotting, detection of GFP fusions, prostatectomy, ex vivo culturing.  Results:   Here, we describe that supraphysiological levels of androgens induce cell cycle arrest and markers of cellular senescence in human PCa cells, which may in part explain the growth inhibitory role of androgens. The expression of the senescence associated beta galactosidase is observed by treatment with the natural androgen DHT or the less metabolized synthetic androgen R1881. The induction of senescence marker was detected in human PCa cell lines as well as in human primary PCa tissue derived from prostatectomy treated ex vivo. Using interphase FISH (iFISH) suggests that the androgen-induced cellular senescence is associated with localizing the genomic E2F1 locus to senescence associated heterochromatic foci. Analysis of different signaling pathways in LNCaP cells suggest that the p16-Rb-E2F1 pathway is essential for the induction of cellular senescence since treatment with siRNA directed against p16 reduces the level of androgen-induced cellular senescence. Based on the rapid induction of androgen-mediated cellular senescence we identified the Src-PI3K-Akt-signaling pathway and autophagy being in part involved in androgen regulation.  Conclusions:   Taken together, our data suggest that AR-agonists at supraphysiological levels mediate induction of cellular senescence in human PCa cells, which may have a protective anti-cancer role.

In addition, decreased expression of p57(Kip2) protein has been frequently observed in pancreatic, lung, breast, bladder, gastrointestinal tract and prostate cancers. However, p57(Kip2) gene mutations are rare in these cancers suggesting that other unknown mechanisms might be at play in reducing its expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of down-regulation of p57(Kip2) in prostate cancer.  Findings:   We observed a significant negative correlation between the expression of p57(Kip2) and microRNA-21 (miR-21) in prostate cancer samples and after androgen deprivation with castration in the CWR22 human prostate cancer xenograft model. We report that miR-21 targeted the coding region and decreased p57(Kip2) mRNA and protein levels in prostate cancer cells. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-21 by an anti-miR-21 inhibitor strongly induced p57(Kip2) expression. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of p57(Kip2) reversed the effects of the anti-miR-21 inhibitor on cell migration and anchorage-independent cell growth.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that miR-21 is able to downregulate p57(Kip2) expression by targeting the coding region of the gene and is also able to attenuate p57(Kip2) mediated functional responses.

Methods:   In a prospective, questionnaire-based study on adverse effects after RP, 330 prostate cancer (PCa) patients who had been active in the workforce before RP described their work status 3 years after having surgery. We dichotomized their postoperative work status into ""unchanged or increased"" versus ""reduced."" The participants also reported whether their working life was influenced by the PCa trajectory to no, some, or a great extent. Univariate and multiple logistic regression models were established with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics as independent variables and ""work status"" or ""influence of PCa trajectory on working life"" as dependent variables.  Results:   Twenty-five percent of the participants had retired. Of the remaining participants, approximately 20 % had a reduced work status, which in the multivariate analyses was significantly associated with increasing age. One third of the men still active in the workforce considered the PCa to negatively influence their working life. This was independently associated with bother related to urinary leakage, fatigue, and having undergone additional oncological therapy (pelvic radiotherapy and/or hormone treatment).  Conclusion:   Though RP does not affect work status in most men, approximately one third of them experience problems in their working life due to adverse effects related to RP and/or additional post-RP anti-cancer therapy.

Material and methods:   Feasibility of MRI-based reference images for IGRT was evaluated against kV CBCT (50 scans, 5 prostate cancer patients) and kV & MV planar (5 & 5 image pairs and patients) localization images by comparing the achieved patient position corrections to those obtained by standard CT-based reference images. T1/T2*-weighted in-phase MRI, Hounsfield unit conversion-based heterogeneous pseudo-CT, and bulk pseudo-CT images were applied for reference against localization CBCTs, and patient position corrections were obtained by automatic image registration. IGRT with planar localization images was performed manually by 10 observers using reference digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) reconstructed from the pseudo-CTs and standard CTs. Quality of pseudo-DRRs against CT-DRRs was evaluated with image similarity metrics.  Results:   The SDs of differences between CBCT-to-MRI and CBCT-to-CT automatic gray-value registrations were ≤1.0 mm & ≤0.8° and ≤2.5 mm & ≤3.6° with 10 cm diameter cubic VOI and prostate-shaped VOI, respectively. The corresponding values for reference heterogeneous pseudo-CT were ≤1.0 mm & ≤0.7° and ≤2.2 mm & ≤3.3°, respectively. Heterogeneous pseudo-CT was the only type of MRI-based reference image working reliably with automatic bone registration (SDs were ≤0.9 mm & ≤0.7°). The differences include possible residual errors from planning CT to MRI registration. The image similarity metrics were significantly (p≤0.01) better in agreement between heterogeneous pseudo-DRRs and CT-DRRs than between bulk pseudo-DRRs and CT-DRRs. The SDs of differences in manual registrations (3D) with planar kV and MV localization images were ≤1.0 mm and ≤1.7 mm, respectively, between heterogeneous pseudo-DRRs and CT-DRRs, and ≤1.4 mm and ≤2.1 mm between bulk pseudo-DRRs and CT-DRRs.

These patients most often transition either to next-line endocrine therapy or to systemic chemotherapy. However, withdrawal of endocrine therapy and observation as is selectively practiced in prostate cancer is another potential strategy for breast cancer patients.  Methods:   A prospective, single-arm phase II trial of aromatase inhibitor (AI) withdrawal was performed in women with MBC, who had disease progression on AI therapy. The primary objective was to estimate the clinical benefit rate (defined as complete or partial response, or stable disease for at least 24 weeks, by RECIST criteria). Participants were monitored clinically and radiographically off all therapy at 8, 16 and 24 weeks after treatment and every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression.  Results:   Twenty-four patients (of 40 intended) were enrolled when the study was closed due to slow accrual. Clinical benefit rate overall was 46% (95% CI 26% to 67%). Median progression-free survival from time of AI withdrawal was 4 months. Two patients have remained progression free, off all treatment, for over 60 months.  Conclusions:   Despite suboptimal patient accrual, our results suggest that selected patients with metastatic breast cancer progressing on AI therapy can experience disease stabilisation and a period of observation after AI withdrawal.

Mass screening has been carried out since the 1990s using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in the serum as a PCa biomarker. However, although PSA is an excellent organ-specific marker, it is not a cancer-specific marker. Therefore, the aim of this study was to discover new biomarkers for the diagnosis of PCa.  Materials and methods:   We focused on urine samples voided following prostate massage (digital rectal examination [DRE]) and conducted a peptidomic analysis of these samples using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS(n)). Urinary biomaterials were concentrated and desalted using CM-Sepharose prior to the following analyses being performed by MALDI-TOF/MS(n): 1) differential analyses of mass spectra; 2) determination of amino acid sequences; and 3) quantitative analyses using a stable isotope-labeled internal standard.  Results:   Multivariate analysis of the MALDI-TOF/MS mass spectra of urinary extracts revealed a 2331 Da peptide in urine samples following DRE. This peptide was identified as a C-terminal PSA fragment composed of 19 amino acid residues. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the relationship between isotope-labeled synthetic and intact peptides using MALDI-TOF/MS revealed that this peptide may be a new pathognomonic biomarker candidate that can differentiate PCa patients from non-cancer subjects.  Conclusion:   The results of the present study indicate that the 2331 Da peptide fragment of PSA may become a new pathognomonic biomarker for the diagnosis of PCa.

We have previously shown that the E3 ligase E6-associated protein (E6AP) is an important regulator of PML protein stability but the relationship and clinical impact of PML and E6AP expression in prostatic carcinoma is unknown.  Methods:   E6AP and PML expression was assessed in tissue microarrays from a phase I discovery cohort of 170 patients treated by radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer (PC). Correlation analysis was carried out between PML and E6AP expression and clinicopathological variates including PSA as a surrogate of disease recurrence. The results were confirmed in a phase II validation cohort of 318 patients with associated clinical recurrence and survival data.  Results:   Survival analysis of the phase I cohort revealed that patients whose tumors showed reduced PML and high E6AP expression had reduced time to PSA relapse (P = 0.012). This was confirmed in the phase II validation cohort where the expression profile of high E6AP/low PML was significantly associated with reduced time to PSA relapse (P < 0.001), clinical relapse (P = 0.016) and PC-specific death (P = 0.014). In multivariate analysis, this expression profile was an independent prognostic indicator of PSA relapse and clinical relapse independent of clinicopathologic factors predicting recurrence.

We previously demonstrated that MSCs could be pre-activated to express therapeutic factors by culturing the cells in 3 dimensions (3D). We compared the activation of MSCs in 3D in fetal bovine serum containing medium and in multiple xeno-free media formulations.  Methods:   MSC aggregation and sphere formation was studied with the use of hanging drop cultures with medium containing fetal bovine serum or with various commercially available stem cell media with or without human serum albumin (HSA). Activation of MSCs was studied with the use of gene expression and protein secretion measurements and with functional studies with the use of macrophages and cancer cells.  Results:   MSCs did not condense into tight spheroids and express a full complement of therapeutic genes in α-minimum essential medium or several commercial stem-cell media. However, we identified a chemically defined xeno-free media, which, when supplemented with HSA from blood or recombinant HSA, resulted in compact spheres with high cell viability, together with high expression of anti-inflammatory (prostaglandin E2, TSG-6 TNF-alpha induced gene/protein 6) and anti-cancer molecules (TRAIL TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, interleukin-24). Furthermore, spheres cultured in this medium showed potent anti-inflammatory effects in a lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage system and suppressed the growth of prostate cancer cells by promoting cell-cycle arrest and cell death.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated that cell activation in 3D depends critically on the culture medium.

To gain more insight into the mechanism of PC-1-induced promotion of PCa, expression analysis of differential genes induced by PC-1 was scanned by microarray. Among all the differentially expressed genes, EphA3 was altered to the greatest extent. EphA3 has been identified to be associated with multiple tumor progression. However, little is known concerning the function of EphA3 in PCa. In the present study, we aimed to ascertain whether EphA3 is induced by PC-1 and the functional significance of EphA3 expression in PCa. We found that overexpression of PC-1 increased the amount of EphA3 and that knockdown of PC-1 led to a decrease in EphA3 in PCa cells. The functional significance and mechanisms by which EphA3 contributes to PCa was investigated in vitro using cell lines, and in vivo using a mouse model and clinical specimens. The results showed that EphA3 enhanced the proliferation and survival of LNCaP cells and suppression of EphA3 inhibited the survival of C4-2B cells. EphA3 enhanced the tumor development of LNCaP cells in null mice. A positive correlation between the levels of EphA3 and the Gleason grade of PCa was identified in clinical PCa specimens. In addition, cellular localization changed with Gleason grade. We further detected that EphA3 increased phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473 and Thr308), indicating that EphA3 activated the Akt pathway.

Internationally a major focus on understanding variations in cancer outcomes has been later presentation to healthcare and later diagnosis. Approaches to reducing time to diagnosis of symptomatic cancer include public symptom awareness campaigns and interventions in primary care to improve early cancer detection. This paper reports the protocol of a factorial cluster-randomised trial of community and general practice (GP) level interventions to reduce the time to diagnosis of cancer in rural Western Australia (WA).  Methods and analysis:   The community intervention is a symptom awareness campaign tailored for rural Australians delivered through a community engagement model. The GP intervention includes a resource card with symptom risk assessment charts and local referral pathways implemented through multiple academic detailing visits and case studies. Participants are eligible if recently diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer who reside in specific regions of rural WA with a planned sample size of 1350. The primary outcome is the Total Diagnostic Interval, defined as the duration from first symptom (or date of cancer screening test) to cancer diagnosis. Secondary outcomes include cancer stage, healthcare utilisation, disease-free status, survival at 2 and 5 years and cost-effectiveness.  Ethics and dissemination:   Ethics approval has been granted by the University of Western Australia and from all relevant hospital recruitment sites in WA.

Methods and results:   The ProtecT study recruited men in the United Kingdom between 1999 and 2010. The Gleason scores were grouped into four categories ≤ 3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3 and ≥ 4 + 4 for analysis. Data from England between 2000 and 2012 were also available. A total of 3282 biopsies containing cancer were analysed. For each year of the ProtecT study, the odds of being diagnosed with a higher GS category increased by 4.9%. Higher GS was also associated with perineural invasion, increasing tumour length, age and PSA level. While biopsy GS from England was incomplete, it also showed a marked decrease in GS five and six tumours during the same period.  Conclusion:   There was GS drift from 3 + 3 to 3 + 4 with time in the ProtecT study, but there appeared to be no significant change in percentage of GS 4 + 3 or higher.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of HSP27 phosphorylation on PC cell growth underlying docetaxel treatment. Cell counting revealed significantly reduced cell growth during docetaxel treatment as a result of both activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (MAPK p38) and protein kinase D1 (PKD1), and, most importantly, the overexpression of the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant HSP27-3D. Further analysis revealed a docetaxel-dependent induction of HSP27 accompanied by an initial phosphorylation and rapid dephosphorylation of the protein. Based on the data, we can conclude that phosphorylation of HSP27 protein is a crucial mechanism in the initiation of chemoresistance in PC. Moreover, the results indicate a key impact of HSP27 on viability and proliferation of PC cells underlying anticancer therapy.

VDT produced dose-dependent cytotoxicity against human prostate cancer cells. Treatment with VDT promoted both apoptosis and autophagy in LNCaP cells. Annexin V/FITC staining indicated that apoptosis occurred in VDT-treated LNCaP cells. DAPI staining revealed morphological changes in the cell nuclei indicative of mitotic catastrophe in LNCaP cells. VDT caused cell growth inhibition via G2/M phase arrest. Moreover, VDT also increased autophagic cell death in LNCaP cells by induction of several autophagy-related proteins such as LC3 II, Atg5, Atg7 and beclin-1 protein, which are essential for autophagy induction.

Relative mRNA expression levels were determined using the ΔΔCt method. GATA1 and GATA2 expression levels were significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues (p < 0.001, paired t test). In univariate logistic regression analysis, decreased GATA1 and GATA2 expression levels were associated with advanced tumor disease (p = 0.005 and 0.008), positive distant metastasis (p = 0.03 and 0.001), and lymph node metastasis status (p = 0.011 and 0.038).

However, the majority of these systems require costly, time-consuming and complex chemical modifications of materials or drugs to synthesize nanoparticles with pH triggered release. Herein, the development of dual drug loaded pH-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with a calcium carbonate-based coating is presented as an effective alternative. This innovative approach allowed the loading of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Ibuprofen) and Doxorubicin, with high efficiency. The resulting dual drug loaded MSNs have spherical morphology and a mean size of 171nm. Our results indicate that under acidic conditions the coating disassembles and the drugs are rapidly released, whereas at physiologic pH the release is slower and gradually increases with time. Furthermore, an improved cytotoxic effect was obtained for Doxorubicin-Ibuprofen MSNs coated with CaCO3 in comparison with non-coated particles. The cytotoxic effect of dual loaded carbonate coated particles, was similar to that of Doxorubicin+Ibuprofen free drug administration at 72h, even with the delivery of a significantly lower amount of drug by MSNs-CaCO3.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a rectal enema on intrafraction prostate motion.  Methods:   The data from 12 patients with localised prostate cancer were analysed. Each patient underwent image-guided radiotherapy (RT), receiving a total dose of 70 Gy in 28 fractions. Rectal enemas were administered to all of the patients before each RT fraction. The location of the prostate was determined by implanting three fiducial markers under the guidance of transrectal ultrasound. Each patient underwent preparation for IGRT twice before an RT fraction and in the middle of the fraction. The intrafraction displacement of the prostate was calculated by comparing fiducial marker locations before and in the middle of an RT fraction.  Results:   The rectal enemas were well tolerated by patients. The mean intrafraction prostate movement in 336 RT fractions was 1.11 ± 0.77 mm (range 0.08-7.20 mm). Intrafraction motions of 1, 2 and 3 mm were observed in 56.0%, 89.0% and 97.6% of all RT fractions, respectively. The intrafraction movements on supero-inferior and anteroposterior axes were larger than on the right-to-left axes (P < 0.05). The CTV-to-PTV margin necessary to allow for movement, calculated using the van Herk formula (2.5Σ + 0.7σ), was 1.50 mm.  Conclusions:   A daily rectal enema before each RT fraction was tolerable and yielded little intrafraction prostate displacement.

Notably, we found that SNPs in the human CTBP2 gene that were associated with prostate cancer development were correlated with AR-enhancer activity. High CtBP2 expression levels correlated with poor prognosis in patients, whereas CtBP2 silencing reduced tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of human prostate cancer. Consistent with its function as a transcriptional corepressor, CtBP2 repressed tumor-suppressor genes and AR corepressors in prostate cancer cells, such as NCOR and RIP140, by binding with AR to the promoter enhancers of these genes. Global gene-expression analyses revealed a positive effect on androgen-mediated gene expression, and CtBP2 silencing was found to increase AR interactions with corepressors that limit histone modification.

Tertiary GP5 was upgraded to a secondary pattern to derive the final Gleason score. GP5 accounted for 6% of all NBXs and 14% of PCa cases. GP5 PCas were associated with high-risk preoperative clinical and biopsy characteristics, regardless of the amount of GP5. Most patients (85%) with % GP5 greater than 5% of PCa had the final Gleason score of 9 to 10, compared with % GP5 of 5% or less of PCa (P < .0001). The morphologic subpatterns of GP5 PCas were as follows: infiltrating cords (96%), single cells (76%), solid sheets (29%), and comedocarcinoma (2%). Infiltrating cords and single-cell patterns frequently coexisted (76%). The GP5 was distributed in a tertiary (66%), followed by secondary (32%) and primary (2%) components of PCa. Infiltrating cords and single cells were the 2 most frequently encountered patterns, specifically when GP5 involved 5% or less of PCa and represented secondary or tertiary component of PCa. GP5 PCa is a relatively frequent presentation in the contemporary NBX practice. Because of its important prognostic and therapeutic implications, pathologists must be aware of its varied morphologic presentations and to the fact that most cases with GP5 represent a tertiary component of PCa.""","""['Rajal B Shah', 'Yousef Tadros']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Diagnosis of Gleason pattern 5 prostate adenocarcinoma on core needle biopsy: an interobserver reproducibility study among urologic pathologists.', 'Usual and unusual histologic patterns of high Gleason score 8 to 10 adenocarcinoma of the prostate in needle biopsy tissue.', 'Identification of Gleason pattern 5 on prostatic needle core biopsy: frequency of underdiagnosis and relation to morphology.', 'The impact of the 2005 international society of urological pathology consensus conference on standard Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma in needle biopsies.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Correlation analysis between immune-related genes and cell infiltration revealed prostate cancer immunotherapy biomarkers linked to T cells gamma delta.', 'Grading of prostate cancer: a work in progress.', 'Contemporary grading of prostate cancer: 2017 update for pathologists and clinicians.']"""

Radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy are the main curative treatment options for organ confined disease. Despite the good long-term oncologic outcomes, roughly 40% of patients undergoing surgery develop biochemical recurrence, manifested as a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Those patients are at higher risk of developing a local or distant recurrence. The diagnosis of a nodal recurrence is challenging. This report is about a 66-year-old male, who had a radical prostatectomy in 2006. Postoperatively, the PSA was never undetectable. Radiotherapy was delivered in 2007, but the PSA rose again. Anti-androgen therapy was started, but he developed painful mastodynia. A (11C) choline PET-CT showed an enlarged suspicious lymph node at the left common iliac and a salvage pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. Postoperatively, the PSA remained undetectable for the last 5 years. The use of lesion - targeted therapy for oligometastatic disease is a new concept in urology, aiming at reducing the tumor burden. Therefore, even though this surgical approach might not be associated with a durable response over time, the tumor load is decreased and further cancer progression might be delayed, allowing to postpone the delivery of hormone therapy.""","""['Charlotte Peeters', 'Diederik Ponette', 'Hendrik van Poppel']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Targeted salvage lymphadenectomy in patients treated with radical prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence: complete biochemical response without adjuvant therapy in patients with low volume lymph node recurrence over a long-term follow-up.', 'Long-term outcomes of salvage lymph node dissection for clinically recurrent prostate cancer: results of a single-institution series with a minimum follow-up of 5 years.', 'Pelvic/retroperitoneal salvage lymph node dissection for patients treated with radical prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence and nodal recurrence detected by 11Ccholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography.', 'Contemporary role of salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Management of positive lymph nodes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Oligometastatic prostate cancer: Reality or figment of imagination?', 'Salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with prostate cancer recurrence: A review.']"""

This study investigated the role of TGF-β1 in biological sequelae and tumor regrowth following irradiation, which are critical for the clinical radiation response of prostate cancer. Human and murine prostate cancer cell lines, and corresponding hormone-refractory (HR) cells, were used to examine the radiation response by clonogenic assays in vitro and tumor growth delay in vivo. Biological changes after irradiation, including cell death and tumor regrowth, were examined by experimental manipulation of TGF-β1 signaling. The correlations among tumor radiation responses, TGF-β1 levels, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) recruitment were also evaluated using animal experiments. HR prostate cancer cells appeared more radioresistant and had higher expression of TGF-β1 compared to hormone-sensitive (HS) cells. TGF-β1 expression was positively linked to irradiation and radioresistance, as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Inhibition of TGF-β1 increased tumor inhibition and DNA damage after irradiation. When mice were irradiated with a sub-lethal dose, the regrowth of irradiated tumors was significantly correlated with TGF-β1 levels and Tregs accumulation in vivo. Furthermore, blocking TGF-β1 clearly attenuated Tregs accumulation and tumor regrowth following treatment. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is important in determining the radiation response of prostate cancer, including tumor cell killing and the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, concurrent treatment with a TGF-β1 inhibitor is a potential therapeutic strategy for increasing the radiation response of prostate cancer, particularly for more aggressive or HR cancer cells.  Key message:   • HR prostate cancer cells appeared more radioresistant and had higher expression of TGF-β1. • TGF-β1 was positively linked to the radiation resistance of prostate cancer. • Tumor regrowth following irradiation was significantly correlated with TGF-β1 and Tregs levels. • Blocking TGF-β1 significantly attenuated RT-induced DNA repair and Tregs. • TGF-β1 inhibitor increases the radiation response of HR cancer cells.""","""['Chun-Te Wu', 'Ching-Chuan Hsieh', 'Tzu-Chen Yen', 'Wen-Cheng Chen', 'Miao-Fen Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Mol Med (Berl)""","""['The role of IL-6 in the radiation response of prostate cancer.', 'TGF Beta1 Expression Correlates with Survival and Tumor Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer.', 'Upregulation of long non-coding RNA PlncRNA-1 promotes proliferation and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Role of transforming growth factor-beta1 in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting immunosuppression by TGF-β1 for cancer immunotherapy.', 'A human-in-the-loop based Bayesian network approach to improve imbalanced radiation outcomes prediction for hepatocellular cancer patients with stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Immunomodulatory effects of carbon ion radiotherapy in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy: the dawn of cancer treatment.', 'Exploiting Canonical TGFβ Signaling in Cancer Treatment.', 'Effect of 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 on the Radiation Response in Prostate Cancer: Association With IL-6 Signaling.']"""

Material and methods:   Ten patients were treated definitively for localized prostate cancer with SBRT to a dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions prescribed to a volume encompassing the prostate only. Dose-volume constraints were applied to the rectum, bladder, penile bulb, femoral heads, and prostatic and membranous urethra. Three-field passively scattered proton plans were retrospectively generated using target volumes from the same patients. Dosimetric indices were compared between the SBRT and proton plans using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Results:   All dose constraints were achieved using both ultra-hypofractionated passively scattered proton and SBRT planning. Proton plans demonstrated significant improvement over SBRT in mean dose delivered to the penile bulb (5.2 CGE vs. 11.4 Gy; p=0.002), rectum (6.7 CGE vs. 10.6 Gy; p=0.002), and membranous urethra (32.2 CGE vs. 34.4 Gy; p=0.006) with improved target homogeneity resulting in a significant reduction in hot spots and volumes of tissue exposed to low doses of radiation. Compared to proton planning, SBRT planning resulted in significant improvement in target conformality with a mean index of 1.17 versus 1.72 (p=0.002), resulting in a dose reduction to the volume of bladder receiving more than 90% of the PD (V32.6, 7.5% vs. 15.9%; p=0.01) and mean dose to the left (7.1 Gy vs. 10.4 CGE; p=0.004) and right (4.0 Gy vs. 10.9 CGE; p=0.01) femoral heads.

Metals are recognized as chemical carcinogens where chronic exposures to such metals are implicated in the development of cancer, including prostate cancer. This in vitro study demonstrates the relative death sensitivity of prostatic (RWPE-1) cells to arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) as environmental pollutants through its apoptotic effects and the effect of these chemicals on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene expression as a marker for their carcinogecity. RWPE-1 cells were divided into three groups that were treated with As, Cd, and Cr in three replicates, at three different concentrations for each metal for 48 h. A control group consisted of untreated RWPE1 cells was used. Apoptosis was assessed using comet assay and caspase 3 gene expression; meanwhile, PSA gene expression was evaluated by semiqualitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). One of the novel findings of this study is that arsenic and cadmium at low concentrations decreased apoptosis of RWPE-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner while chromium induced significant concentration-dependent increase in apoptosis. Yet, at the highest concentrations, apoptosis was relatively more induced by all chemicals. Arsenic was the most chemical inhibiting apoptosis in RWPE-1 cells at low concentration. While at the moderate and highest concentrations, cadmium was the most inhibiting chemical of RWPE-1 cells' apoptosis. No distinct differences between treated and untreated cells for PSA gene expression were observed. It can be concluded that As and Cd, at low concentrations, can reduce apoptosis of prostatic cells in a concentration-dependent manner while chromium induced it; however, all metal salts used in this study did not induce PSA gene expression.""","""['Hend M Abo El-Atta', 'Amal A El-Bakary', 'Afaf M Attia', 'Ahmed Lotfy', 'Shery S Khater', 'Ayman Z Elsamanoudy', 'Hussein Abdelaziz Abdalla']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biol Trace Elem Res""","""['Effects of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead on gene expression regulated by a battery of 13 different promoters in recombinant HepG2 cells.', 'Arsenic-specific stem cell selection during malignant transformation.', 'Possible role of caspase-3 inhibition in cadmium-induced blockage of apoptosis.', 'Selenium interactions and toxicity: a review.

We assessed the impact of planning MRI detection of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or adjacent organ invasion on the staging, target volume delineation, doses, and hormonal therapy of patients with prostate cancer undergoing IMRT.  Methods:   The records of 509 consecutive patients with planning MRI scans being treated with IMRT for prostate cancer between January 2010 and July 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Tumor staging and treatment plans before and after MRI were compared.  Results:   Of the 509 patients, 103 (20%) were upstaged and 44 (9%) were migrated to a higher risk category as a result of findings at MRI.

Methods:   The Fluidigm® PCR array was used for multi-transcript profiling of laser microdissected tumours from archival formalin-fixed diagnostic biopsies of patients treated by EBRT or PADT. Cases were matched for disease characteristics and had known 5 year biochemical relapse outcomes (n = 60). Results were validated by immunohistochemistry in a custom needle biopsy tissue microarray. Six biomarkers previously tested only in surgical cohorts were analysed (PTEN, E-Cadherin, EGFR, EZH2, PSMA, MSMB). Transcript and protein expression was correlated with clinical outcome analysed using Kruskal Wallis, Fisher's test and Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   Altered expression of E-Cadherin (p = 0.008) was associated with early relapse after EBRT.

Methods:   One hundred and fifty-five patients (training cohort, 70 patients; temporal validation cohort, 85 patients) underwent mp-MRI and transperineal-template-prostate-mapping (TPM) biopsy. Positive cores were classified by cancer definitions: (1) any-cancer; (2) definition-1 [≥Gleason 4 + 3 or ≥ 6 mm cancer core length (CCL)] [high risk significant]; and (3) definition-2 (≥Gleason 3 + 4 or ≥ 4 mm CCL) cancer [intermediate-high risk significant]. For each, logistic-regression mp-MRI models were derived from the training cohort and validated internally and with the temporal cohort. Sensitivity/specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) curve were calculated. LR model performance was compared to radiologists' performance.  Results:   Twenty-eight of 70 patients from the training cohort, and 25/85 patients from the temporal validation cohort had significant cancer on TPM. The ROC-AUC of the LR model for classification of cancer was 0.73/0.67 at internal/temporal validation. The radiologist A/B ROC-AUC was 0.65/0.74 (temporal cohort). For patients scored by radiologists as Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (Pi-RADS) score 3, sensitivity/specificity of radiologist A 'best guess' and LR model was 0.14/0.54 and 0.71/0.61, respectively; and radiologist B 'best guess' and LR model was 0.40/0.34 and 0.50/0.76, respectively.  Conclusions:   LR models can improve classification of Pi-RADS score 3 lesions similar to experienced radiologists.

The trivalent bispecific antibody TF12 (anti-TROP2 × anti-HSG [histamine-succinyl-glycine]) has shown to effectively target PC. In this study, the efficacy of pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) with multiple cycles of TF12 and (177)Lu-labeled diHSG-peptide (IMP288) in mice with s.c. PC3 tumors was investigated and compared with that of conventional RIT with (177)Lu-labeled anti-TROP-2 mAb hRS7.  Methods:   The potential of one, two, and three cycles of PRIT using the TF12 pretargeted (177)Lu-IMP288 (41 MBq per cycle) was determined in mice with s.c. PC3 tumors, and compared with the efficacy and toxicity of RIT with (177)Lu-hRS7 dosed at the maximum tolerated dose (11 MBq).  Results:   PRIT of two and three cycles showed significantly higher median survival (> 150 days) compared with PRIT of one cycle of TF12 and (177)Lu-IMP288 (111 days, p < 0.001) or the controls (76 days, p < 0.0001). All mice treated with the mAb (177)Lu-hRS7 survived at the end of the experiment (150 days), compared with 80% in the mice that were treated with three cycles of PRIT and 70% in the group that received two cycles of PRIT. Clinically significant hematologic toxicity was found only in the groups that received either three cycles of PRIT (p < 0.0009) or RIT (p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   TROP-2-expressing PC can be targeted efficiently with TF12 and radiolabeled IMP288. (177)Lu-IMP288 accumulated rapidly in the tumors. PRIT of multiple cycles inhibited the growth of s.c. PC3 tumors. Clinically relevant hematological toxicity was observed in the group that received three cycles of PRIT; however, conventional RIT with the parent mAb (177)Lu-hRS7 was at least as effective with similar toxicity.""","""['Catharina M van Rij', 'Cathelijne Frielink', 'David M Goldenberg', 'Robert M Sharkey', 'Susanne Lütje', 'William J McBride', 'Wim J G Oyen', 'Otto C Boerman']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Pretargeted immuno-PET and radioimmunotherapy of prostate cancer with an anti-TROP-2 x anti-HSG bispecific antibody.', 'α- Versus β-Emitting Radionuclides for Pretargeted Radioimmunotherapy of Carcinoembryonic Antigen-Expressing Human Colon Cancer Xenografts.', 'Pretargeted immunoPET of prostate cancer with an anti-TROP-2 x anti-HSG bispecific antibody in mice with PC3 xenografts.', 'Radioimmunotherapy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer with ¹⁷⁷Lu-DOTAhuJ591 Anti Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Specific Monoclonal Antibody.', '177Lu-Labeled aglycosylated anti-L1-CAM monoclonal antibody chCE7.', 'Development and characterization of TrMab‑6, a novel anti‑TROP2 monoclonal antibody for antigen detection in breast cancer.', 'Evaluation of 131II- and 177LuLu-DTPA-A11 Minibody for Radioimmunotherapy in a Preclinical Model of PSCA-Expressing Prostate Cancer.', 'ImmunoPET: Concept, Design, and Applications.', 'Development of Targeted Alpha Particle Therapy for Solid Tumors.', 'Therapeutic Applications of Pretargeting.']"""

The complexes were thoroughly characterized, including multinuclear high resolution NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X-ray analysis (for complexes 1 and 3). The complexes were screened for their in vitro cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines MCF7 (breast carcinoma), HOS (osteosarcoma) and THP-1 (monocytic leukaemia), which identified the complexes 4-6 as the most promising representatives, who antiproliferative activity was further tested against A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), G-361 (melanoma), HeLa (cervical cancer), A2780 (ovarian carcinoma), A2780R (ovarian carcinoma resistant to cisplatin), 22Rv1 (prostate cancer) cell lines. Complexes 4-6 showed a significantly higher in vitro anticancer effect against the employed cancer cells, except for G-361, as compared with the commercially used anticancer drug cisplatin, with IC50 ≈ 1-30 µM.

Methods:   The points on the three-dimensional surfaces of the TV and the VRI were generated. Then, the averaged distances between the points on the TV and the VRI were calculated (CIdistance). The performance of the presented CIs were evaluated by analysing six situations, which were a perfect match, an expansion and a reduction of the distance from the centroid to the VRI compared with the distance from the centroid to the TV by 10%, a lateral shift of the VRI by 3 cm, a rotation of the VRI by 45° and a spherical-shaped VRI having the same volume as the TV. The presented CIs were applied to the clinical prostate and head and neck (H&N) plans.  Results:   For the perfect match, CIdistance was 0 with 0 as the standard deviation (SD). When expanding and reducing, CIdistance was 10 and -10 with SDs <1.3, respectively. With shifting and rotating of the VRI, the CIdistance was almost 0 with SDs >11. The average value of the CIdistance in the prostate and H&N plans was 0.13 ± 7.44 and 6.04 ± 23.27, respectively.

Patients and methods:   Patients received open-label cabozantinib at daily starting doses of 100 mg or 40 mg until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was bone scan response, defined as ≥ 30% reduction in bone scan lesion area. Other efficacy end points included overall survival, pain, analgesic use, and biomarkers.  Results:   One hundred forty-four patients sequentially enrolled in either a 100-mg (n = 93) or 40-mg (n = 51) study cohort. Ninety-one patients (63%) had a bone scan response, often by week 6. Treatment resulted in clinically meaningful pain relief (57% of patients) and reduction or discontinuation of narcotic analgesics (55% of patients), as well as improvements in measurable soft tissue disease, circulating tumor cells, and bone biomarkers. Improvements in each of these outcomes were observed in both cohorts: bone scan response in 73% and 45%, respectively; reductions in measurable soft tissue disease in 80% and 79%, respectively. Median overall survival was 10.8 months for the entire population. Most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were fatigue (22%) and hypertension (14%). Fewer dose reductions because of toxicity were required in the 40-mg group.  Conclusion:   The evidence suggests that cabozantinib has clinically meaningful activity in CRPC.

However, results from previous studies that assess their relationship have been inconsistent. Therefore, we investigated the association of male pattern baldness at age 45 years with risks of overall and subtypes of prostate cancer in a large, prospective cohort—the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.  Methods:   We included 39,070 men from the usual care and screening arms of the trial cohort who had no cancer diagnosis (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) at the start of follow-up and recalled their hair-loss patterns at age 45 years. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated by using Cox proportional hazards regression models with age as the time metric.  Results:   During follow-up (median, 2.78 years), 1,138 incident prostate cancer cases were diagnosed, 571 of which were aggressive (biopsy Gleason score ≥ 7, and/or clinical stage III or greater, and/or fatal).

Adjustment for covariates did not substantially alter these estimates. Other classes of baldness were not significantly associated with overall or subtypes of prostate cancer.

We hypothesized that CYB5A and CYB5R3 polymorphisms would be associated with breast cancer risk in women.  Methods:   We characterized the prevalence of 18 CYB5A and CYB5R3 variants in genomic DNA from African American (AfrAm) and Caucasian (Cauc) women from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study population (1,946 cases and 1,747 controls) and determined their associations with breast cancer risk, with effect modification by smoking.  Results:   A CYB5R3 variant, I1M+6T (rs8190370), was significantly more common in breast cancer cases (MAF 0.0238) compared with controls (0.0169, p = 0.039); this was attributable to a higher MAF in AfrAm cases (0.0611) compared with AfrAm controls (0.0441, p = 0.046; adjusted OR 1.41, CI 0.98-2.04; p = 0.062). When smoking was considered, I1M+6T was more strongly associated with breast cancer risk in AfrAm smokers (adjusted OR 2.10, 1.08-4.07; p = 0.028) compared with never smokers (OR = 1.21; 0.77-1.88; p for interaction = 0.176). I1M+6T and three additional CYB5R3 variants, -251T, I8-1676C, and *392C, as well as two CYB5A variants, 13G and I2-992T, were significantly more common in AfrAms compared with Caucs.  Conclusions:   CYB5R3 I1M+6C>T should be considered in future molecular epidemiologic studies of breast cancer risk in AfrAms.

WNT5A is known to influence the clinical outcome of various cancer types, including prostate cancer, but the exact mechanisms remain unknown. The goal of this study was to assess the relevance of WNT5A for the development and progression of prostate cancer. WNT5A expression was determined in a cDNA and tissue microarray of primary tumor samples in well-defined cohorts of patients with prostate cancer. Compared with benign prostate tissue, the expression of WNT5A and its receptor Frizzled-5 was higher in prostate cancer, and patients with a WNT5A expression above the median had a higher probability of survival after 10 years. Using different osteotropic human prostate cancer cell lines, the influence of WNT5A overexpression and knock-down on proliferation, migration, and apoptosis was assessed. In vitro, WNT5A overexpression induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis and reduced proliferation and migration, whereas WNT5A knock-down showed opposite effects. In vivo, different xenograft models were used to determine the effects of WNT5A on tumor growth. Local tumor growth and tumor growth in the bone microenvironment was considerably diminished after WNT5A overexpression in PC3 cells.

In the present study, the chemosensitizing effect of CNFs and CNTs on cancer cells of urological origin was investigated regarding the underlying mechanisms. Prostate cancer (DU-145, PC-3) and bladder cancer (EJ28) cells were treated with carbon nanomaterials (CNFs, CNTs) and chemotherapeutics (carboplatin, cisplatin) alone as well as in combination for 24 h. Forty-eight(EJ28) or 72 h (DU-145, PC-3) after the end of treatment the effects on cellular proliferation,clonogenic survival, cell death rate and cell cycle distribution were evaluated. Depending on the cell line, simultaneous administration of chemotherapeutics and carbon nanomaterials produced an additional inhibition of cellular proliferation and clonogenic survival of up to 77% and 98%, respectively, compared to the inhibitory effects of the chemotherapeutics alone. These strongly enhanced antiproliferative effects were accompanied by an elevated cell death rate, which was predominantly mediated via apoptosis and not by necrosis. The antitumor effects of combinations with CNTs were less pronounced than those with CNFs. The enhanced effects of the combinatory treatments on cellular function were mostly of additive to partly synergistic nature. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis demonstrated an arrest at the G2/M phase mediated by a monotreatment with chemotherapeutics. Following combinatory treatments, mostly less than or nearly additive increases of cell fractions in the G2/M phase could be observed. In conclusion,the pronounced chemosensitizing effects of CNFs and CNTs were mediated by an enhanced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. The combination of carbon-based nanomaterials and conventional chemotherapeutics represents a novel approach in cancer therapy to bypass chemoresistance by minimizing the chemotherapeutic dosing.""","""['Kati Erdmann', 'Jessica Ringel', 'Silke Hampel', 'Christiane Rieger', 'Doreen Huebner', 'Manfred P Wirth', 'Susanne Fuessel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Nanotechnology""","""['Carbon nanomaterials sensitize prostate cancer cells to docetaxel and mitomycin C via induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation.', 'Carbon nanofibers and carbon nanotubes sensitize prostate and bladder cancer cells to platinum-based chemotherapeutics.', 'Zoledronic acid in combination with serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors induces enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell lines by decreasing the activities of PP1 and PP2A.', 'Delivery of carboplatin by carbon-based nanocontainers mediates increased cancer cell death.', 'Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Carbon Nanofibres: More Than a Cobweb.', 'Carbon nanomaterials sensitize prostate cancer cells to docetaxel and mitomycin C via induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation.', 'MiR-26a and miR-138 block the G1/S transition by targeting the cell cycle regulating network in prostate cancer cells.']"""

The influence of variants in genes related to these states on BPH has not been studied extensively. Thus, we evaluated the association of 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune response genes (IL1B, IL6, IL8, IL10, TNF, CRP, TLR4 and RNASEL) and genes involved in obesity, including insulin regulation (LEP, ADIPOQ, PPARG and TCF7L2), with BPH.  Methods:   BPH cases (N = 568) and age-frequency matched controls (N=568) were selected from among adult male CLUE II cohort participants who responded in 2000 to a mailed questionnaire. BPH was defined as BPH surgery, use of BPH medications or symptomatic BPH (American Urological Association Symptom Index Score ⩾ 15). Controls were men who had not had BPH surgery, did not use BPH medications and whose symptom score was ⩽ 7.

Amplification of EGR-1, TGF-β1 and p14ARF were observed in the two cell lines treated with different stimuli and resulted in a corresponding mRNA and protein expression. The downregulation of TGF-β1 and the attenuation of p14ARF expression by siRNA against Egr-1 predominantly suggested that TGF-β1 and p14ARF may be regulated by the transcription factor EGR-1. A marginal attenuation of cell growth in PC-3 and LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell lines overexpressing p14ARF was observed. Cells transfected with Egr-1 wild-type were able to grow and avoid cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the presence or absence of p14ARF. In addition, EGR-1 stimulated the expression of TGF β-l as well as the accumulation of the p14ARF proteins. The results suggested that TGF-β1 and p14ARF activities in the presence of EGR-1 overexpression can exist independently of the presence of cells carrying a mutant p53 (PC-3 cells) or cells carrying a wild‑type p53 (LNCaP cells). Thus, the effect of EGR-1 on the growth of prostate carcinoma cells may occur through multiple mechanisms, but be independent of p53 expression control.""","""['Eduardo Parra', 'Luis Gutiérrez', 'Jorge Ferreira']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Upregulation of long non-coding RNA PlncRNA-1 promotes proliferation and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Down-regulation of Egr-1 by siRNA inhibits growth of human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3.', 'Overexpression of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1 type II receptor restores TGF-beta1 sensitivity and signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Overexpression of EGR-1 modulates the activity of NF-κB and AP-1 in prostate carcinoma PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines.', 'Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) suppresses growth of B-cell lymphoma cells by p14(ARF)-dependent regulation of mutant p53.', 'Human Epididymis Protein\xa04 and Lewis\xa0y Enhance Chemotherapeutic Resistance in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Through the p38\xa0MAPK Pathway.', 'Tumor suppression by the EGR1, DMP1, ARF, p53, and PTEN Network.', 'GCN5 inhibition prevents IL-6-induced prostate cancer metastases through PI3K/PTEN/Akt signaling by inactivating Egr-1.']"""

Methods:   Data analysis included 1854 men with prostate cancer from a population-based study. Participants completed an assessment of communication variables, physician trust, perceived racism, religious beliefs, traditional health beliefs, and health literacy. A multi-group structural equation modeling approach was used to address the research aims.  Results:   Compared with African Americans, Caucasian Americans had significantly greater mean scores of interpersonal treatment (p<0.01), prostate cancer communication (p<0.001), and physician trust (p<0.001), but lower mean scores of religious beliefs, traditional health beliefs, and perceived racism (all p values <0.001). For both African and Caucasian Americans, better patient-provider communication was associated with more physician trust, less perceived racism, greater religious beliefs (all p-values <0.01), and at least high school education (p<0.05).  Conclusion:   Socio-cultural factors are associated with patient-provider communication among men with cancer. No evidence supported associations differed by race.

One of the goals of this approach is to delay the start of palliative androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), with its negative impact on quality of life.

Patients will be stratified according to the location of metastasis (node vs. bone metastases) and PSA doubling time (≤3 vs. > 3 months). Both surgery and SBRT are allowed as MDT. Active surveillance means 3-monthly PSA testing and re-imaging at PSA progression. The primary endpoint is ADT-free survival. ADT will be started in both arms at time of polymetastatic disease (>3 metastatic lesions), local progression or symptoms.

Study design and methods:   The results of enriching 59 clinical PBMC concentrates for monocytes or lymphocytes from patients with solid tumors or multiple myeloma using a commercial closed system semi-automated counter-flow elutriation instrument (Elutra, Terumo BCT) were evaluated for quality and consistency. Elutriated monocytes (n = 35) were used to manufacture autologous dendritic cells and elutriated lymphocytes (n = 24) were used manufacture autologous T cell therapies. Elutriated monocytes with >10% neutrophils were subjected to density gradient sedimentation to reduce neutrophil contamination and elutriated lymphocytes to RBC lysis.  Results:   Elutriation separated the PBMC concentrates into 5 fractions. Almost all of the lymphocytes, platelets and red cells were found in fractions 1 and 2; in contrast, most of the monocytes, 88.6 ± 43.0%, and neutrophils, 74.8 ± 64.3%, were in fraction 5. In addition, elutriation of 6 PBMCs resulted in relatively large quantities of monocytes in fractions 1 or 2. These 6 PBMCs contained greater quantities of monocytes than the other 53 PBMCs. Among fraction 5 isolates 38 of 59 contained >10% neutrophils. High neutrophil content of fraction 5 was associated with greater quantities of neutrophils in the PBMC concentrate. Following density gradient separation the neutrophil counts fell to 3.6 ± 3.4% (all products contained <10% neutrophils). Following red cell lysis of the elutriated lymphocyte fraction the lymphocyte recovery was 86.7 ± 24.0% and 34.3 ± 37.4% of red blood cells remained.

With long life expectancy, the development of subsequent cancers is an important concern for survivors of thyroid cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence and types of second primary malignancies in Korean patients with thyroid cancer.  Methods:   The study cohort included 178,844 registrants with thyroid cancer from the Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) database between 1993 and 2010. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated using a statistical software program (SEER*Stat 8.0.4).  Results:   Among 178,844 patients with thyroid cancer, 2895 (1.6%) were diagnosed with subsequent second primary malignancies. The overall risks of a second primary cancer were elevated by 6% in patients who had thyroid cancer compared with the general population during the same period. The elevated risks for developing second cancers were observed in all sites except the stomach and cervix. The elevated risk of second primary cancers was observed within the first 10 years of follow-up. Leukemia and cancers of the salivary gland, kidney, prostate, lung, and breast had the most significantly elevated risks as secondary cancers and presented as early as during the first 5 years after the initial diagnosis of thyroid cancer.  Conclusions:   This is the largest, standardized, population-based study to date using nationwide data from the entire Korean population.

(2010) performed a meta-analysis of 5 clinical trials (n=68,402) of 3 Angiotensin II (AngII) receptor subtype AT-1 blockers (ARBs) in cardiovascular disease. It revealed excess new lung cancer diagnoses in the cohorts treated with an ARB and background therapy (0.9% vs. 0.7% in non-ARB control; RR: 1.25; CI: 1.05-1.49; p=0.01). The FDA responded with a larger meta-analysis of 31 clinical trials (n=155,816) of ARBs that found no evidence of any excess of site-specific cancer (lung, breast, prostate), solid/skin cancer or cancer death (FDA safety communication, 3 June 2011). The FDA then re-visited the 19 rodent carcinogenicity assays of 9 ARBs, starting with those for Losartan in 1994, for any evidence of dosage-related lung tumorigenicity in this class. Assays were performed in 5 strains of rats and 5 strains of wild-type and transgenic mice per protocols and dosages sanctioned by FDA's executive carcinogenicity assessment committee (eCAC). Duration was lifetime except for 26-week assays of azilsartan and olmesartan in transgenic Tg rasH2 mice, and an assay of olmesartan in p53(+/-) transgenic mice. The dosages provided exposures approximating, and in most cases up to 20-300times greater than, that in patients. Depending on strain, up to 35% of untreated mice spontaneously developed lung tumors. Regression analysis of placebo-corrected mouse lung tumor incidence collapsed across strains, gender, and ARBs vs. multiples of human exposure revealed no excess lung neoplasia. The R(2) of <0.001 reflected the virtually identical number of treated cohorts with more tumors than its control cohort vs. those with less. Regardless of strain, both control and medicated rats were essentially devoid of lung tumors in the lifetime trials. Accordingly, there was neither promotion of background lung tumors in the mouse, nor initiation of de novo lung tumors in the rat. The negative lung findings in the mouse Tg rasH2 strain are also noteworthy given that, historically, the most prevalent spontaneous tumors in 26week trials in that model are lung adenomas and carcinomas. The negative results of the 19, mostly lifetime, assays for cancer viewed en masse add to the results of the meta-analysis of the shorter clinical trials of ARBs that were benign regardless of statistical method used (random vs. fixed effect), comparator arm (with or without ACE-inhibitors) and major co-factors (smoking or cancer history).""","""['William T Link', 'Albert De Felice']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Regul Toxicol Pharmacol""","""['The Tg rasH2 mouse in cancer hazard identification.', 'NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Diethylphthalate (CAS No. 84-66-2) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Dermal Studies) with Dermal Initiation/ Promotion Study of Diethylphthalate and Dimethylphthalate (CAS No. 131-11-3) in Male Swiss (CD-1(R)) Mice.', 'Antihypertensive drugs and risk of cancer: network meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of 324,168 participants from randomised trials.', 'Historical control data of spontaneous tumors in transgenic CByB6F1-Tg(HRAS)2Jic (Tg.rasH2) mice.', 'Pathological features of spontaneous and induced tumors in transgenic mice carrying a human prototype c-Ha-ras gene used for six-month carcinogenicity studies.', 'Antihypertensive treatment and risk of cancer: an individual participant data meta-analysis.', 'Targeting the renin-angiotensin system to improve cancer treatment: Implications for immunotherapy.', 'Alterations in Gene Expression of Components of the Renin-Angiotensin System and Its Related Enzymes in Lung Cancer.', 'The Comparative Effectiveness of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers in Patients With Diabetes.']"""

However, it is unclear whether cells of the osteoblast lineage signal back to prostate cancer cells, and if so, whether such direct cross-talk can be targeted therapeutically. Using the human prostate cancer cell line, PC3, we identified two novel signalling pathways acting between cells of the osteoblast lineage and cancer cells. First, exposure to RANKL stimulated the expression and release of IL-6 by PC3 cells in vitro (which is known to promote RANKL expression by osteoblasts). Second, treatment of PC3 cells with IL-6 increased the expression of RANK, the cognate receptor of RANKL, and enhanced the RANKL-induced release of IL-6 by PC3 cells. Third, targeted disruption of IL-6 signaling with tocilizumab, a clinically available antibody against the human IL-6 receptor, inhibited skeletal tumor growth in vivo and reduced serum RANKL levels as well as RANK expression by PC3-derived bone tumors. Similar effects were achieved when RANK expression was knocked down in PC3 cells. In contrast, disruption of IL-6 or RANK/RANKL signalling had no effect on PC3 tumor growth in soft tissues, indicating that these signalling pathways act specifically within the bone microenvironment. In conclusion, prostate cancer cells and cells of the osteoblast lineage communicate via two inter-dependent signaling pathways, which through auto-amplification strongly enhance metastatic prostate cancer growth in bone. Both pathways may be targeted for effective therapeutic intervention.""","""['Yu Zheng', 'Dennis Basel', 'Shu-Oi Chow', 'Colette Fong-Yee', 'Sarah Kim', 'Frank Buttgereit', 'Colin R Dunstan', 'Hong Zhou', 'Markus J Seibel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Direct crosstalk between cancer and osteoblast lineage cells fuels metastatic growth in bone via auto-amplification of IL-6 and RANKL signaling pathways.', 'RANKL acts directly on RANK-expressing prostate tumor cells and mediates migration and expression of tumor metastasis genes.', 'DU145 human prostate cancer cells express functional receptor activator of NFkappaB: new insights in the prostate cancer bone metastasis process.', 'Targeting RANKL in breast cancer: bone metastasis and beyond.', 'The RANK/RANKL/OPG triad in cancer-induced bone diseases.', 'Comprehensive investigating of MMR gene in hepatocellular carcinoma with chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Han Chinese population.', 'Osteoclasts directly influence castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'EphA2 Is a Clinically Relevant Target for Breast Cancer Bone Metastatic Disease.', 'GP130 Cytokines in Breast Cancer and Bone.', 'Multiple actions of parathyroid hormone-related protein in breast cancer bone metastasis.']"""

Despite initial disease regression, tumours inevitably recur and progress to an advanced castration-resistant state a major feature of which is metastasis to the bone. Up-regulation of AR cofactors and chaperones that overcome low hormone conditions to maintain basal AR activity has been postulated as a mechanism of therapy relapse. p23, an essential component of the apo-AR complex, acts also after ligand binding to increase AR transcriptional activity and target gene expression, partly by increasing chromatin-loaded holo-receptor-complexes. Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated increased p23 expression in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we further characterise p23 roles in AR signalling and show that it modulates cytosolic AR levels in the absence of hormone, confirming a chaperoning function in the aporeceptor complex and suggesting p23 upregulates AR signalling at multiple stages. Moreover, p23 protein levels significantly increased upon treatment with not only androgen but also clinically relevant anti-androgens. This was in contrast to the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG, which did not modulate expression of the cochaperone - important given the HSP90-independent roles we and others have previously described for p23. Further, we demonstrate p23 is implicated in prostate cancer cell motility and in acquisition of invasiveness capacity through the expression of specific genes known to participate in cancer progression. This may drive metastatic processes in vivo since analysis of prostate tumour biopsies revealed that high nuclear p23 significantly correlated with shorter survival times and with development of metastases in patients with lower grade tumours. We propose that increased p23 expression may allow cells to acquire a more aggressive phenotype, contributing to disease progression, and that p23 is a plausible secondary target in combination with HSP90 inhibition as a potential therapy for advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Laia Querol Cano', 'Derek N Lavery', 'Soraya Sin', 'Emma Spanjaard', 'Greg N Brooke', 'Jessica D Tilman', 'Ahmed Abroaf', 'Luke Gaughan', 'Craig N Robson', 'Rakesh Heer', 'Francesco Mauri', 'Johan de Rooij', 'Keltouma Driouch', 'Charlotte L Bevan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Role of the HSP90-associated cochaperone p23 in enhancing activity of the androgen receptor and significance for prostate cancer.', 'FKBP51 promotes assembly of the Hsp90 chaperone complex and regulates androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'The Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-AAG, prevents the ligand-independent nuclear localization of androgen receptor in refractory prostate cancer cells.', 'Hsp90 as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Drug-mediated targeted disruption of multiple protein activities through functional inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone complex.', 'Specific prostaglandins are produced in the migratory cells and the surrounding substrate to promote Drosophila border cell migration.', 'The p23 co-chaperone is a succinate-activated COX-2 transcription factor in lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis.', 'Comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of PTGES3 and its prognostic role in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Impact of Co-chaperones and Posttranslational Modifications Toward Hsp90 Drug Sensitivity.', 'Emerging Link between Tsc1 and FNIP Co-Chaperones of Hsp90 and Cancer.']"""

Methods:   566 lesions in 235 consecutive patients (65.7 ± 7.9 years, PSA 9.9 ± 8.5 ng/ml) with a multiparametric (mp)-MRI (T2WI, DWI, DCE) of the prostate at 3T were scored using the PI-RADS scoring system. PI-RADS single (PSsingle), summed (PSsum), and overall (PSoverall) scores were determined. All lesions were histologically verified by IB-GB.  Results:   Lesions with a PSsum below 9 contained no prostate cancer (PCa) with Gleason score (GS) ≥ 4+3=7. A PSsum of 13-15 (PSoverall V) resulted in 87.8% (n=108) in PCa and in 42.3% (n=52) in GS ≥ 4+3=7. Transition zone (TZ) lesions with a PSsum of 13-15 (PSoverall V) resulted in 76.3% (n=36) in PCa and in 26.3% (n=10) in GS ≥ 4+3=7, whereas for peripheral zone (PZ) lesions cancer detection rate at this score was 92.9% (n=79) and 49.4% (n=42) for GS ≥ 4+3=7. Using a threshold of PSsum ≥ 10, sensitivity was 86.0%, and negative predictive value (NPV) was 86.2%. For higher grade PCa sensitivity was 98.6%, and NPV was 99.5%.  Conclusion:   A PSsum below 9 excluded a higher grade PCa, whereas lesions with a PSsum ≥ 13 (PSoverall V) represented in 88% PCa, and in 42% higher grade PCa.

Objective:   To determine the accuracy of MR-TRUS image-fusion biopsy in characterizing ITs, as confirmed by correlation with step-sectioned radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective analysis of 135 consecutive patients who sequentially underwent pre-biopsy MR, MR-TRUS image-fusion biopsy, and robotic RP at two centers between January 2010 and September 2013.  Intervention:   Image-guided biopsies of MR-suspected IT lesions were performed with tracking via real-time 3D TRUS. The largest geographically distinct cancer focus (IT lesion) was independently registered on step-sectioned RP specimens.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A validated schema comprising 27 regions of interest was used to identify the IT center location on MR images and in RP specimens, as well as the location of the midpoint of the biopsy trajectory, and variables were correlated.  Results and limitations:   The concordance between IT location on biopsy and RP specimens was 95% (128/135). The coefficient for correlation between IT volume on MRI and histology was r=0.663 (p<0.001). The maximum cancer core length on biopsy was weakly correlated with RP tumor volume (r=0.466, p<0.001). The concordance of primary Gleason pattern between targeted biopsy and RP specimens was 90% (115/128; κ=0.76). The study limitations include retrospective evaluation of a selected patient population, which limits the generalizability of the results.  Conclusion:   Use of MR-TRUS image fusion to guide prostate biopsies reliably identified the location and primary Gleason pattern of the IT lesion in >90% of patients, but showed limited ability to predict cancer volume, as confirmed by step-sectioned RP specimens.

Given uncertainty as to whether specific clinical factors can identify men at increased risk, we sought to develop a prognostic index for risk of fracture in this population.  Materials and methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to identify men who received ADT or RT after being diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 2007-2009. Cox proportional hazards models tested the association of potential risk factors with fracture. In a derivation group, hazard ratios were used to assign points for factors independently related to fracture. The prognostic index was then applied to a validation group.  Results:   The sample of 5824 men had a median age of 73.0 years; 82.9% were white and 8.6% had a fracture within 2 years of treatment for prostate cancer. The Cox model identified 8 variables (age, race, hormone treatment, Elixhauser score, anxiety, Parkinson's, fall-inducing medications and disability status) independently associated with fracture. In the derivation cohort, 4.3% of the sample experienced a fracture in the low-risk group, 8.9% in the intermediate group, and 19.2% in the high-risk group (C statistic, 0.749). The index was applied to the validation cohort (C statistic, 0.782).  Conclusion:   The prognostic index can help to identify patients at increased risk for fracture.

Radical prostatectomy remains a definitive treatment for prostate cancer. However, prostate surgeries are still performed ""blindly"" with the extent of tumor infiltration past the margins of the surgery only being determined postoperatively. An imaging modality that can be used during surgery is needed to help define the tumor margins. With its abundant expression in prostate cancer, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an ideal target for detection of prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to develop PSMA-targeted near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging probes for intraoperative visualization of prostate cancer. We synthesized a high-affinity PSMA ligand (PSMA-1) with low molecular weight and further labeled it with commercially available NIR dyes IRDy800 and Cy5.5. PSMA-1 and PSMA-1-NIR conjugates had binding affinities better than the parent ligand Cys-CO-Glu. Selective binding was measured for each of the probes in both in vitro and in vivo studies using competitive binding and uptake studies. Interestingly, the results indicated that the pharmacokinetics of the probes was dependent of the fluorophore conjugated to the PSMA-1 ligand and varied widely. These data suggest that PSMA-targeted probes have the potential to be further developed as contrast agents for clinical intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery.""","""['Xinning Wang', 'Steve S Huang', 'Warren D W Heston', 'Hong Guo', 'Bing-Cheng Wang', 'James P Basilion']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Evaluation of Novel Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Near-Infrared Imaging Agent for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery of Prostate Cancer.', 'Dual-Modality Image-Guided Surgery of Prostate Cancer with a Radiolabeled Fluorescent Anti-PSMA Monoclonal Antibody.', 'PSMA-targeted NIR probes for image-guided detection of prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of prostate-specific membrane antigen ligands in clinical translation research for diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-targeted low-molecular double conjugates for diagnostics and therapy.', 'Mesoporous semiconductors combined with up-conversion nanoparticles for enhanced photodynamic therapy under near infrared light.', 'A Series of PSMA-Targeted Near-Infrared Fluorescent Imaging Agents.', 'Targeted Chemoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer Using Gold Nanoclusters with Protease Activatable Monomethyl Auristatin E.', 'A low molecular weight multifunctional theranostic molecule for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Intracellular vesicle entrapment of nanobubble ultrasound contrast agents targeted to PSMA promotes prolonged enhancement and stability in vivo and in vitro.']"""

MK-2206 is a potent pan-AKT inhibitor with a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) previously established at 60 mg on alternate days (QOD). Due to a long half-life (60-80 hours), a weekly (QW) MK-2206 schedule was pursued to compare intermittent QW and continuous QOD dosing.  Experimental design:   Patients with advanced cancers were enrolled in a QW dose-escalation phase I study to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profiles of tumor and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The QOD MTD of MK-2206 was also assessed in patients with ovarian and castration-resistant prostate cancers and patients with advanced cancers undergoing multiparametric functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, including dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and intrinsic susceptibility-weighted MRI.  Results:   A total of 71 patients were enrolled; 38 patients had 60 mg MK-2206 QOD, whereas 33 received MK-2206 at 90, 135, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mg QW. The QW MK-2206 MTD was established at 200 mg following dose-limiting rash at 250 and 300 mg. QW dosing appeared to be similarly tolerated to QOD, with toxicities including rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, and hyperglycemia. Significant AKT pathway blockade was observed with both continuous QOD and intermittent QW dosing of MK-2206 in serially obtained tumor and PRP specimens. The functional imaging studies demonstrated that complex multiparametric MRI protocols may be effectively implemented in a phase I trial.  Conclusions:   Treatment with MK-2206 safely results in significant AKT pathway blockade in QOD and QW schedules. The intermittent dose of 200 mg QW is currently used in phase II MK-2206 monotherapy and combination studies (NCT00670488).""","""['Timothy A Yap', 'Li Yan', 'Amita Patnaik', 'Nina Tunariu', 'Andrea Biondo', 'Ivy Fearen', 'Kyriakos P Papadopoulos', 'David Olmos', 'Richard Baird', 'Liliana Delgado', 'Ernestina Tetteh', 'Robert A Beckman', 'Lisa Lupinacci', 'Ruth Riisnaes', 'Shaun Decordova', 'Simon P Heaton', 'Karen Swales', 'Nandita M deSouza', 'Martin O Leach', 'Michelle D Garrett', 'Daniel M Sullivan', 'Johann S de Bono', 'Anthony W Tolcher']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['First-in-man clinical trial of the oral pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in patients with advanced solid tumors.', 'A phase 1 study evaluating the combination of an allosteric AKT inhibitor (MK-2206) and trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive solid tumors.', 'Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of the oral pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors.', 'Phase 1 trial of the oral AKT inhibitor MK-2206 plus carboplatin/paclitaxel, docetaxel, or erlotinib in patients with advanced solid tumors.', ""A phase I trial of MK-2206 in children with refractory malignancies: a Children's Oncology Group study."", 'Role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in mediating endocrine resistance: concept to clinic.', 'Severe Lactic Acidosis Complicated by Insulin-Resistant Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Syndrome in a Patient With Metastatic Breast Cancer Undergoing AKT-Inhibitor Therapy.', 'Clinical Development of AKT Inhibitors and Associated Predictive Biomarkers to Guide Patient Treatment in Cancer Medicine.', 'Targeting lysosomes in human disease: from basic research to clinical applications.', 'Th1 cytokines in conjunction with pharmacological Akt inhibition potentiate apoptosis of breast cancer cells in vitro and suppress tumor growth in vivo.']"""

Ultra scale-down methods are used to characterize cells in terms of their response to process engineering causal factors of hydrodynamic shear stress and time. This response is in turn characterized in terms of causal factors relating to variations as may naturally occur during cell preparation, i.e., passage number, generation number, time of the final passage stage and hold time in formulation medium.  Methods:   To investigate the influence of all of these causal factors we have adopted a non-linear, multivariate predictive artificial neural network (ANN) based modeling approach to help create clearer insights into their effect on cell membrane integrity and surface marker content. A prostate cancer cell line candidate for cancer therapy (P4E6) was used and cell surface markers CD9, CD147 and HLA A-C were investigated.  Results:   All causal factors studied were found to be significant in establishing an ANN model for the prediction of cell quality parameters with the extent of exposure to shear stress being the most significant and then passage number (range 57-66) and generation number (range 10-19) determining most strongly the cells' resistance to shear stress. Both the operation of the final cell passage and the hold time of the cells in a formulation buffer also determine the cells' resistance to shear stress. The processing parameters related to cell handling after preparation, i.e., shear stress and time of exposure were found to be the most influential affecting cell quality.  Conclusion:   CD9 surface marker loss was the most sensitive indicator of the effects of shear stress followed by loss of membrane integrity and then HLA A-C, while CD147 remained unaffected by shear stress or even prone to increase. Also greater stability of cell surface marker presence was noted for cells generated at greater passage numbers or generation numbers or for reduction in hold time in formulation buffer.""","""['Gopal Krishna Dhondalay', 'Katherine Lawrence', 'Stephen Ward', 'Graham Ball', 'Michael Hoare']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Artif Intell Med""","""['An ultra scale-down analysis of the recovery by dead-end centrifugation of human cells for therapy.', 'Ultra scale-down stress analysis of the bioprocessing of whole human cells as a basis for cancer vaccines.', 'Ultra scale-down studies of the effect of shear on cell quality; Processing of a human cell line for cancer vaccine therapy.', 'Sub-population analysis of human cancer vaccine cells--ultra scale-down characterization of response to shear.', 'Comparison of artificial neural network and multiple linear regression in the optimization of formulation parameters of leuprolide acetate loaded liposomes.', 'An ultra scale-down analysis of the recovery by dead-end centrifugation of human cells for therapy.']"""

Alternatively spliced isoforms of ERG have variable biological activities; inclusion of exon 11 (72 base pairs [bp]) is associated with aggressiveness and progression of disease. Exon 10 (81 bp) has also been shown to be alternatively spliced. Within this study, we assess whether ERG protein, messenger RNA (mRNA), and ERG splice isoform mRNA expression is altered as prostate cancer progresses.  Methods:   Detection of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was done using direct methods (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [PCR] and fluorescence in situ hybridization) and indirect methods for ERG mRNA and protein expression using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. A linear equation method was used to quantitatively determine relative proportions of ERG variants (ERG72/Δ72, ERG81/Δ81) for each sample.  Results:   ERG mRNA and protein expression is increased in patients with advanced prostate cancer, with higher levels of ERG expression significantly associated with seminal vesicle invasion (stage pT3b) and biochemical recurrence. Genes involved in cell migration and invasiveness (matrix metalloproteinase 7, osteopontin, and septin 9) are increased in prostate cancers that overexpress ERG.

Since a decrease in CBCT dose is linked to a degradation of image quality, the consequences of dose reduction on the registration process have to be investigated.  Material and methods:   This paper examines image quality and registration of low-contrast structures on an Elekta XVI for the two treatment areas prostate and chest while gradually decreasing the mAs per frame and the number of projections per CBCT to achieve dose reduction.  Results:   Ideal results for image quality were obtained for 1.6 mAs/frame and 377 projections in prostate scans and 0.63 mAs/frame and 440 projections in chest images. Lower as well as higher total mAs lead to a decrease in image quality. In spite of poor image quality, registration can be successfully performed even for lowest possible settings.  Conclusion:   The results for registration allow an extensive dose reduction in both treatment areas. Very low mAs, however, do not qualify for clinical use because subjective judgment of the registration process is impossible. Compared to default presets the use of settings for acceptable image quality already permit a decrease in exposure of about 40 % (29.0 to 16.7 mGy) in prostate scans and 60 % (18.3 to 7.7 mGy) in chest scans.""","""['B Loutfi-Krauss', 'J Köhn', 'N Blümer', 'K Freundl', 'T Koch', 'E Kara', 'C Scherf', 'C Rödel', 'U Ramm', 'J Licher']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['A comprehensive study on decreasing the kilovoltage cone-beam CT dose by reducing the projection number.', 'Quantitative cone-beam CT imaging in radiation therapy using planning CT as a prior: first patient studies.', 'Progressive cone beam CT dose control in image-guided radiation therapy.', 'Mobile C-arm cone-beam CT for guidance of spine surgery: image quality, radiation dose, and integration with interventional guidance.', 'Cone beam computed tomography number errors and consequences for radiotherapy planning: an investigation of correction methods.', 'Prerequisites for the clinical implementation of a\xa0markerless SGRT-only workflow for the treatment of breast cancer patients.', 'Dose Reduction and Low-Contrast Detectability Using Iterative CBCT Reconstruction Algorithm for Radiotherapy.', 'Assessment of female breast dose for thoracic cone-beam CT using MOSFET dosimeters.', 'Cone beam CT dose reduction in prostate radiotherapy using Likert scale methods.']"""

These outcomes occurred in only 37% (58/157) of patients without carrying those fusion transcripts. Three fusion transcripts occurred exclusively in PCa samples from patients who experienced recurrence or PCaerelated death.

Competing risks regression was used to assess prostate cancer-specific mortality (CSM), adjusting for age, Japan Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (J-CAPRA) score, diagnosis year, and treatment type [combined androgen blockade (CAB) vs castration monotherapy], comorbidity, and practice type.  Results:   Men on PADT in J-CaP (13 880 men) were older than those in CaPSURE (1633 men), and had higher-risk disease (mean J-CAPRA score 3.8 vs 2.1, P < 0.001). They more often received CAB: 66.9% vs 46.4% (P < 0.001). Despite different risk profiles between the cohorts, CSM was similar on univariate analysis (log-rank P = 0.88). On multivariable regression, the subhazard ratio for CSM was 0.52 for J-CaP vs CaPSURE (95% confidence interval 0.40-0.68).  Conclusions:   Men on PADT in Japan have less than half the adjusted CSM than those in the USA.

The main biological function of PSA is the liquefaction of the clot formed after ejaculation by cleavage of semenogelins I and II in seminal fluid. PSA also cleaves several other substrates, which may explain its putative functions in prostate cancer and its antiangiogenic activity. We compared the proteolytic efficiency of PSA towards several protein and peptide substrates and studied the effect of peptides stimulating the activity of PSA with these substrates. An endothelial cell tube formation model was used to analyze the effect of PSA-degraded protein fragments on angiogenesis. We showed that PSA degrades semenogelins I and II much more efficiently than other previously identified protein substrates, e.g., fibronectin, galectin-3 and IGFBP-3. We identified nidogen-1 as a new substrate for PSA. Peptides B2 and C4 that stimulate the activity of PSA towards small peptide substrates also enhanced the proteolytic activity of PSA towards protein substrates. Nidogen-1, galectin-3 or their fragments produced by PSA did not have any effect on endothelial cell tube formation. Although PSA cleaves several other protein substrates, in addition to semenogelins, the physiological importance of this activity remains speculative.

Materials and methods:   A total of 77 hospitals performing TRUS-Bx were identified and an e-mail was sent to the Urology Department of those hospitals. The questions in the e-mail included the choice of antibiotics before and after the procedure and the duration of antibiotic therapy after TRUS-Bx.  Results:   A total of 54 hospitals (70.0%) responded to the e-mail. Before TRUS-Bx, all hospitals administered intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis. The percentage of hospitals that used quinolone, cephalosporin, and aminoglycoside alone was 48.1%, 20.4%, and 9.3%, respectively. The percentage of hospitals that used two or more antibiotics was 22.2%. After biopsy, all 54 hospitals prescribed oral antibiotics. The percentage of hospitals that prescribed quinolone alone, cephalosporin alone, or a combination of two or more antibiotics was 77.8%, 20.4%, and 1.8%, respectively. The duration of antibiotic use was more than 3 days in most hospitals (79.6%). Only four hospitals (7.4%) followed the AUA recommendation of a 1-day regimen.

Methods:   Data were extracted for the initial myelosuppressive chemotherapy course for 27,899 patients who began treatment in the period 2006 to 2011. FN-related costs were defined as claims containing FN diagnosis.  Results:   Most patients were men (98.0%); most were 65 years or older (55.8%).

The postoperative time course of these effects and their influence on postoperative lung function is unknown. Therefore, we assessed intra- and extrathoracic airway resistance and nasal air flow in patients with or without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during robotic-assisted prostatectomy.  Methods:   In 55 patients without and 20 patients with COPD spirometric measurements and nasal resistance were obtained before operation, 40 and 120 min, and 1 and 5 days after operation. We measured vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), maximal mid-expiratory and inspiratory flow (MEF50, MIF50), arterial oxygen saturation, and nasal flow. The occurrence of postoperative conjunctival oedema (chemosis) was also assessed.  Results:   In patients without COPD, MEF50/MIF50 increased and nasal flow decreased significantly after surgery (P<0.0001) and normalized within 24 h. VC and FEV1 decreased after operation with a nadir at 24 h and recovered to normal until the fifth day (P<0.0001). In patients with COPD, changes in MEF50/MIF50 and nasal flow were similar, while changes in VC and FEV1 lasted beyond the fifth day (P<0.0001).  Conclusions:   Robotic-assisted prostatectomy in the steep Trendelenburg position led to an increase in upper airway resistance directly after surgery that normalized within 24 h.

These harms must be carefully balanced with the benefits gained in life expectancy and quality of life. Prior research has demonstrated an increasing aggressiveness of care in cancer patients at the end-of-life. To better characterize surgical care in this setting, we sought to examine trends in the use of invasive procedures in patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer on presentation.  Materials and methods:   Using Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results -Medicare data, we identified invasive procedure claims from 1994-2009 for patients diagnosed with incident stage IV breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer patients in 1995-2006. We grouped procedures into surgically relevant categories, using an adaptation of the Clinical Classifications Software, and measured utilization and relative changes over time.  Results:   Of stage IV patients diagnosed in 2002-2006, 96% underwent a procedure during the course of their cancer care including 63% after the diagnostic period, and 25% in the last month of life. Between 1996 and 2006, minimal change was observed in utilization during the diagnostic period (+1.5%). However, there were significant increases during continuing care (+20.7%) and the last month of life (+21.5%). Procedures consistent with primary tumor resection decreased, whereas those with probable palliative intent and those unrelated to cancer increased.  Conclusions:   Nearly all patients who present with metastatic cancer undergo invasive procedures. Although overall utilization is increasing, the specific procedure types indicate that it may be appropriate, enhancing the quality of life in this vulnerable population.""","""['Alvin C Kwok', 'Yue-Yung Hu', 'Christopher M Dodgion', 'Wei Jiang', 'Gladys V Ting', 'Nathan Taback', 'Stuart R Lipsitz', 'Jane C Weeks', 'Caprice C Greenberg']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Surg Res""","""['High-cost imaging in elderly patients with stage IV cancer.', 'Procedural Aggressiveness in Veterans with Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer at the End of Life.', 'Utilization of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hospice at the end of life for patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma.', 'Chemotherapy Use, End-of-Life Care, and Costs of Care Among Patients Diagnosed With Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Sutureless Aortic Valve Replacement for Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Single Technology Assessment of Perceval Sutureless Aortic Valve Internet.', 'Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae related urinary tract infection in adult cancer patients: a multicenter retrospective study, 2015-2019.', 'Conceptualizing and Counting Discretionary Utilization in the Final 100\xa0Days of Life: A Scoping Review.', 'Balancing Hope and Risk Among Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Patients with Late-Stage Cancer: A Qualitative Interview Study.', 'The challenge of sustainability in healthcare systems: frequency and cost of diagnostic procedures in end-of-life cancer patients.', 'Safety of Immediate Posterior Trunk Soft-Tissue Reconstruction in Older Adults.']"""

Principal component analysis showed that miRNA expression is clustered by epithelial cell phenotype, regardless of pathologic status. We also discovered concordance between the miRNA expression profiles of unfractionated epithelial cells from CRPCs, human embryonic stem cells (SCs), and prostate epithelial SCs (both benign and malignant).

Prodrug esters are inactive compounds that can be preferentially activated by esterase enzymes. Moreover, cancer cells often exhibit a high level of intrinsic oxidative stress due to an increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decreased expression of some enzymatic antioxidants. Prodrugs designed to induce additional oxidative stress can selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells already exhibiting a high level of intrinsic oxidative stress. This study focused on the in vitro evaluation of four novel prodrug esters: the R- and S- chiral esters of 4-[(nitrooxy)methyl]phenyl N-acetylalaninate (R- and S-NPAA) and the R- and S- chiral esters of 4-[(nitrooxy)methyl]naphth-1-yl N-acetylalaninate (R- and S-NQM), which are activated, to varying extents, by oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH, EC 3.4.19.1) yielding a quinone methide (QM) intermediate capable of depleting glutathione (GSH), a key intracellular antioxidant. OPH is a serine esterase/protease that is overexpressed in some human tumors and cancer cell lines.  Methods:   To evaluate the chiral ester prodrugs, we monitored cellular GSH depletion, cellular protein carbonyl levels (an oxidative stress biomarker) and cell viability in tumorigenic and nontumorigenic prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   We found that the prodrugs were activated by OPH and subsequently depleted GSH. The S-chiral ester of NPAA (S-NPAA) was two-fold more effective than the R-chiral ester (R-NPAA) in depleting GSH, increasing oxidative stress, inducing apoptosis, and decreasing cell viability in tumorigenic prostate LNCaP cells but had little effect on non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 cells. In addition, we found that that S-NPAA induced apoptosis and decreased cell viability in tumorigenic DU145 and PC3 prostate cell lines. Similar results were found in a COS-7 model that overexpressed active human OPH (COS-7-OPH).  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that prostate tumors overexpressing OPH and/or exhibiting a high level of intrinsic oxidative stress may be susceptible to QM generating prodrug esters that are targeted to OPH with little effect on non-tumorigenic prostate cells.""","""['Christopher A McGoldrick', 'Yu-Lin Jiang', 'Marianne Brannon', 'Koyamangalath Krishnan', 'William L Stone']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Identification of oxidized protein hydrolase as a potential prodrug target in prostate cancer.', 'Differential involvement of reactive oxygen species and nucleoside transporters in cytotoxicity induced by two adenosine analogues in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Activity of aminoferrocene-based prodrugs against prostate cancer.', 'Anticancer boron-containing prodrugs responsive to oxidative stress from the tumor microenvironment.', 'How to Increase Cellular Glutathione.', 'Combretastatin A4-camptothecin micelles as combination therapy for effective anticancer activity.', 'Oxidative stress and prostatic diseases.', ""Horizontal alignment of 5' -> 3' intergene distance segment tropy with respect to the gene as the conserved basis for DNA transcription.""]"""

Methods:   All metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with primary ADT from 2000 to 2009 were reviewed. The prognostic significance of TTPN in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) beyond TTPN and overall survival (OS) beyond TTPN was analyzed using the Cox regression model. The median PFS and OS were plotted against TTPN on a monthly interval. The PFS beyond TTPN and the OS beyond TTPN with reference to TTPN were calculated and presented.  Results:   The study enrolled 419 patients with a median follow-up period of 38 months. The findings showed that TTPN was a significant prognostic indicator for both PFS beyond TTPN (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.99, p = 0.04) and OS beyond TTPN (HR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.47-0.90, p = 0.01) according to Cox regression analyses. The relationship between TTPN and survival beyond TTPN consisted of three phases. In the first phase (<3 months for PFS and <6 months for OS), the survival beyond TTPN increased with TTPN. In the second phase (3-17 months for PFS and 6-20 months for OS), the survival beyond TTPN remained relatively static. In the third phase (>17 months for PFS and >20 months for OS), the survival beyond TTPN increased exponentially with TTPN.

Several miRNAs are differentially expressed in cancer and many are being considered as biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes. Here we quantified the expression of three miRNAs, miR-21, miR-141, and miR-221, from prostate cancer surgical specimens and evaluated their association with disease recurrence after primary therapy.  Methods:   A pilot nested case-control study was designed from a large cohort of men who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1993 and 2001. Total RNA was extracted from malignant prostate tissue of 59 cases (recurrence) and 59 controls. Cases and controls were matched on age, race, pathologic stage, and grade. The relative expression of each miRNA was then determined for each sample by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of recurrence for tertiles of miRNA expression. We noted block storage time effects and thus, used separate tertile cutpoints based on the controls by calendar year of prostatectomy.  Results:   Lower miR-221 expression was associated with a higher risk of recurrence; the ORs were 3.21 for the lowest tertile and 2.63 for the middle tertile compared with the highest tertile of expression (P-trend = 0.02).

Patients and methods:   We prospectively enrolled men with elevated or rising PSA levels and/or abnormal digital rectal examination into our MRI/TRUS fusion-guided prostate biopsy trial. Participants underwent a 3 T mpMRI with an endorectal coil. Three radiologists graded all suspicious lesions on a 5-point Likert scale. MRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsies of suspicious prostate lesions and standard TRUS-guided 12-core biopsies were performed. Analysis of 140 eligible men with at least one previous negative biopsy was performed. We calculated CDRs and estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of mpMRI in predicting any cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer.  Results:   The overall CDR was 65.0% (91/140). Higher level of suspicion on mpMRI was significantly associated with prostate cancer detection (P < 0.001) with an AUC of 0.744 compared with 0.653 and 0.680 for PSA level and PSA density, respectively. The CDRs of MRI/TRUS fusion-guided and standard 12-core biopsy were 52.1% (73/140) and 48.6% (68/140), respectively (P = 0.435). However, fusion biopsy was more likely to detect clinically significant prostate cancer when compared with the 12-core biopsy (47.9% vs 30.7%; P < 0.001). Of the cancers missed by 12-core biopsy, 20.9% (19/91) were clinically significant. Most cancers missed by 12-core biopsy (69.6%) were located in the anterior fibromuscular stroma and transition zone. Using a fusion-biopsy-only approach in men with an MRI suspicion score of ≥4 would have missed only 3.5% of clinically significant prostate cancers.

Several genetic association studies have implicated select 8q24 loci in PRCA risk in AA. The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the association between previously reported 8q24 risk alleles and PRCA in African-Barbadian (AB) men known to have high rates of PRCA.  Methods:   Ten previously reported candidate tag SNPs were genotyped and/or imputed in the 8q24 region in 532 AB men with PRCA and 513 AB controls from the Prostate Cancer in a Black Population (PCBP) study.  Results:   Rs2124036 was significant in AB men, (OR = 2.7, 95% CI (1.3-5.3), P = 0.005, Empirical (max (T), corrected for multiple testing) P = 0.03) for the homozygous C/C genotype. Only a single SNP from this region remained statistically significant in our analysis of our AB population. These results may indicate the presence of a founder effect or due to the chosen SNPs not tagging an ancestral haplotype bearing the 8q24 risk allele(s) in this population or could reflect inadequate power to detect an association. We conducted a meta-analysis including our AB population along with two additional African Caribbean populations from Tobago and Jamaica for SNPs rs16901979 and rs1447295.

Materials and methods:   Patients (n = 286), who underwent a repeated PBx, were analyzed. The various parameters associated with PCa detection were noted in each patient. PSA-MR was also calculated.  Results:   PCa was detected in 63 (22.0%) of 286 patients.

Advanced disease and adverse ADT side effects are often debilitating and negatively impact mood. Social support has been shown to mitigate detrimental effects of stress on mood.  Objective:   This study sought to characterize positive and negative mood in this select patient population and determine whether social support moderated relations between stress and mood.  Methods:   Participants (N = 80) completed the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Perceived Stress Scale, and Derogatis Affect Balance Scale at a single time point. Hierarchical regression models evaluated relations among social support, stress, and mood controlling for relevant covariates. Standard moderation analyses were performed.  Results:   Participants reported higher levels of negative and positive mood compared with published means of localized prostate cancer patients. Overall, mood was more positive than negative. Stress levels were comparable to cancer populations with recurrent disease. Moderated regression analyses showed that social support partially buffered the effects of stress on positive mood; men with high stress and low support reported the lowest levels of positive mood. The model with negative mood as the dependent measure did not support moderation; that is, the relationship between stress and negative mood did not differ by level of social support.  Conclusion:   Among individuals living with advanced prostate cancer, social support may be an important factor that sustains positive mood in the presence of stress. Future work should examine the extent to which social support prospectively impacts health-related quality of life by promoting positive mood.

Both Foxa1 and Foxa2 are also crucial for the specification and differentiation of dopamine (DA) neurons during embryonic development, while about 30% of mice with an embryonic deletion of a single allele of the Foxa2 gene exhibit an age-related asymmetric loss of DA neurons and develop locomotor symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease (PD). Notably, both Foxa1 and Foxa2 factors continue to be expressed in the adult dopamine system. To directly assess their functions selectively in adult DA neurons, we induced genetic deletions of Foxa1/2 transcription factors in mice using a tamoxifen inducible tissue-specific CreERT2 recombinase expressed under control of the dopamine transporter (DAT) promoter (DATCreERT2). The conditional DA neurons-specific ablation of both genes, but not of Foxa2 alone, in early adulthood, caused a decline of striatal dopamine and its metabolites, along with locomotor deficits. At early pre-symptomatic stages, we observed a decline in aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A1 (Aldh1a1) protein expression in DA neurons. Further analyses revealed a decline of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and a complete loss of DAT expression in these neurons. These molecular changes ultimately led to a reduction of DA neuron numbers in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of aged cFoxa1/2 (-/-) mice, resembling the progressive course of PD in humans. Altogether, in this study, we address the molecular, cellular, and functional role of both Foxa1 and Foxa2 factors in the maintenance of the adult dopamine system which may help to find better approaches for PD treatment.""","""['Andrii Domanskyi', 'Heike Alter', 'Miriam A Vogt', 'Peter Gass', 'Ilya A Vinnikov']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Front Cell Neurosci""","""['Transcription factors FOXA1 and FOXA2 maintain dopaminergic neuronal properties and control feeding behavior in adult mice.', 'Foxa1 and Foxa2 function both upstream of and cooperatively with Lmx1a and Lmx1b in a feedforward loop promoting mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neuron development.', 'Foxa1 and Foxa2 regulate multiple phases of midbrain dopaminergic neuron development in a dosage-dependent manner.', ""Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 making molecular inroads into the differential vulnerability of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron subtypes in Parkinson's disease."", 'Dopamine transporter: involvement in selective dopaminergic neurotoxicity and degeneration.', ""Animal models of Parkinson's disease: bridging the gap between disease hallmarks and research questions."", 'Genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Indian and Global Population: A Review.', 'Generation and characterization of NGLY1 patient-derived midbrain organoids.', 'Embryoid Body Cells from Human Embryonic Stem Cells Overexpressing Dopaminergic Transcription Factors Survive and Initiate Neurogenesis via Neural Rosettes in the Substantia Nigra.', ""Genes critical for development and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons are downregulated in Parkinson's disease.""]"""

For the ganglia, SUVmax and SUVmax to background SUVmean ratios were 2.97 ± 0.88 and 7.98 ± 2.84 (range 1.57-6.38 and 2.83-30.6), respectively, and 82.8% of all ganglia showed an uptake ratio of >5.0. For lymph node metastases, SUVmax and SUVmax to background SUVmean ratios were 8.5 ± 7.0 and 23.31 ± 22.23 (range 2.06-35.9 and 5.25-115.8), respectively. In 35 patients (41.2%), no lymph node metastases were found but tracer uptake was seen in the ganglia. Immunohistochemistry confirmed strong PSMA expression in the ganglia.

However, it varies greatly in its behaviour, from indolent non-progressive disease to metastatic cancers with high associated mortality. The aim of this study was to identify predictive biomarkers for patients with localised prostate tumours most likely to progress to aggressive disease, to facilitate future tailored clinical treatment and identify novel therapeutic targets. The expression of 602 genes was profiled using oligoarrays, across three prostate cancer cell lines: CA-HPV-10, LNCaP and PC3, qualitatively identifying several potential prognostic biomarkers. Of particular interest was six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) 1 and STEAP 2 which was subsequently analysed further in prostate cancer tissue samples following optimisation of an RNA extraction method from laser captured cells isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy samples. Quantitative analysis of STEAP1 and 2 gene expression were statistically significantly associated with the metastatic cell lines DU145 and PC3 as compared to the normal prostate epithelial cell line, PNT2. This expression pattern was also mirrored at the protein level in the cells. Furthermore, STEAP2 up-regulation was observed within a small patient cohort and was associated with those that had locally advanced disease. Subsequent mechanistic studies in the PNT2 cell line demonstrated that an over-expression of STEAP2 resulted in these normal prostate cells gaining an ability to migrate and invade, suggesting that STEAP2 expression may be a crucial molecule in driving the invasive ability of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Helen Whiteland', 'Samantha Spencer-Harty', 'Claire Morgan', 'Howard Kynaston', 'David Hywel Thomas', 'Pradeep Bose', 'Neil Fenn', 'Paul Lewis', 'Spencer Jenkins', 'Shareen H Doak']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'STEAP2 Knockdown Reduces the Invasive Potential of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Enhanced expression of SOS1 is detected in prostate cancer epithelial cells from African-American men.', 'MiR-221 expression affects invasion potential of human prostate carcinoma cell lines by targeting DVL2.', 'Regulatory Roles of Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate Family Members in the Occurrence and Development of Malignant Tumors.', 'Ferroptosis regulates key signaling pathways in gastrointestinal tumors: Underlying mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.', 'Prostate cancer extracellular vesicle digital scoring assay - a rapid noninvasive approach for quantification of disease-relevant mRNAs.', 'STEAP2 promotes osteosarcoma progression by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and is regulated by EFEMP2.', 'A Molecular Docking Study of Human STEAP2 for the Discovery of New Potential Anti-Prostate Cancer Chemotherapeutic Candidates.', 'STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.']"""

We and others have previously shown that loss of INPP4B expression correlates with poor prognosis in multiple malignancies and with metastatic spread in prostate cancer.  Results:   We demonstrate that de novo expression of INPP4B in highly invasive human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells suppresses their invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Using global gene expression analysis, we found that INPP4B regulates a number of genes associated with cell adhesion, the extracellular matrix, and the cytoskeleton. Importantly, de novo expressed INPP4B suppressed the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8 and induced PAK6. These genes were regulated in a reciprocal manner following downregulation of INPP4B in the independently derived INPP4B-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway, which is highly active in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells, did not reproduce INPP4B mediated suppression of IL-8 mRNA expression in either cell type. In contrast, inhibition of PKC signaling phenocopied INPP4B-mediated inhibitory effect on IL-8 in either prostate cancer cell line. In PC-3 cells, INPP4B overexpression caused a decline in the level of metastases associated BIRC5 protein, phosphorylation of PKC, and expression of the common PKC and IL-8 downstream target, COX-2. Reciprocally, COX-2 expression was increased in LNCaP cells following depletion of endogenous INPP4B.  Conclusion:   Taken together, we discovered that INPP4B is a novel suppressor of oncogenic PKC signaling, further emphasizing the role of INPP4B in maintaining normal physiology of the prostate epithelium and suppressing metastatic potential of prostate tumors.""","""['Myles C Hodgson', 'Elena I Deryugina', 'Egla Suarez', 'Sandra M Lopez', 'Dong Lin', 'Hui Xue', 'Ivan P Gorlov', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Irina U Agoulnik']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['Estrogen receptor β regulates AKT activity through up-regulation of INPP4B and inhibits migration of prostate cancer cell line PC-3.', 'Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II regulation of androgen receptor activity.', 'INPP4B overexpression suppresses migration, invasion and angiogenesis of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Decreased expression and androgen regulation of the tumor suppressor gene INPP4B in prostate cancer.', 'ELOVL2 restrains cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer via regulation of the tumor suppressor INPP4B.', 'Systematic Analysis of Cellular Signaling Pathways and Therapeutic Targets for SLC45A3:ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Expression patterns and the roles of phosphatidylinositol phosphatases in testis†.', 'INPP4B protects from metabolic\xa0syndrome and associated disorders.', 'Estrogen receptor β regulates AKT activity through up-regulation of INPP4B and inhibits migration of prostate cancer cell line PC-3.', 'AR-dependent phosphorylation and phospho-proteome targets in prostate cancer.']"""

The intrafascial dissection has been proposed to allow a more complete preservation of these bundles. However, this technique harbors a high rate of positive surgical margins, justifying another trend: the interfascial approach. To date, there are still few publications directly comparing these 2 techniques and our study is the first to offer a 2-year follow-up.  Materials and methods:   Our study focused on a two-hundred patients population divided into two consecutive groups. All the patients were continent preoperatively and had a satisfactory IIEF5 score: (1) Group 1 consisted of 100 patients who underwent RALP with the intrafascial approach. They had a mean age of 60.3 years (45-70). The majority of cancers were of the low or moderate risk group of d'Amico. The mean PSA was 7.43ng/ml. Seventy-five patients had a pT2, 24 a pT3 and one patient had a pT4. (2) Group 2 included 100 patients who underwent RALP with the interfascial technique. Patients had a mean age of 61.6±5.96 years (45-72), and their cancers were mostly of the low or moderate risk groups of d'Amico. The mean PSA was 6.3ng/ml. Seventy-four patients had a pT2, 22 a pT3a, and 4 had a pT3b. All patients were evaluated after one and two years of follow-up.  Result:   Rates of positive surgical margins were 45% and 19% respectively for groups 1 and 2 (P<0.0001). The rates of biochemical failure (PSA>0.2ng/ml) at 2 years were 10% and 3%, respectively for groups 1 and 2 (P=0.0447). At 2 years, 2 patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2 were using 2 or more urinary pads. Erection with or without oral medication was maintained in 65 (65%) and 31 (31%) patients respectively for groups 1 and 2 at one year. At 2 years 86 and 65 patients were having spontaneous erection, respectively in groups 1 and 2 (P=0.0006). In addition, 65 and 55 patients were also capable of sexual penetration, respectively in groups 1 and 2 (P=0.0045).  Conclusion:   The intrafascial approach exposed to a very high rate of positive surgical margins while offering only a little benefit in the erectile function preservation at 2 years compared to the interfascial variant. In our series, we did not notice any significant difference between the two techniques concerning the urinary continence.

We tested the hypothesis that the impact of aRT on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in these individuals is related to tumor characteristics.  Methods:   We evaluated 1,107 patients with pN1 prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy and anatomically extended pelvic lymph node dissection between 1988 and 2010 at two tertiary care centers. All patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy with or without aRT. Regression tree analysis stratified patients into risk groups on the basis of their tumor characteristics and the corresponding CSM rate. Cox regression analysis tested the relationship between aRT and CSM rate, as well as overall mortality (OM) rate in each risk group separately.  Results:   Overall, 35% of patients received aRT. At multivariable analysis, aRT was associated with more favorable CSM rate (hazard ratio [HR], 0.37; P < .001). However, when patients were stratified into risk groups, only two groups of men benefited from aRT: (1) patients with positive lymph node (PLN) count ≤ 2, Gleason score 7 to 10, pT3b/pT4 stage, or positive surgical margins (HR, 0.30; P = .002); and (2) patients with PLN count of 3 to 4 (HR, 0.21; P = .02), regardless of other tumor characteristics. These results were confirmed when OM was examined as an end point.  Conclusion:   The beneficial impact of aRT on survival in patients with pN1 prostate cancer is highly influenced by tumor characteristics. Men with low-volume nodal disease (≤ two PLNs) in the presence of intermediate- to high-grade, non-specimen-confined disease and those with intermediate-volume nodal disease (three to four PLNs) represent the ideal candidates for aRT after surgery.""","""['Firas Abdollah', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Damiano Vizziello', 'Maxine Sun', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Mani Menon', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Adjuvant radiation for node-positive disease after prostatectomy: more good news, but who will listen?', 'Potential role for androgen-deprivation therapy and pelvic radiation therapy in node-positive postprostatectomy prostate cancer.', 'Reply to C.G.

Non-hormonal, non-toxic treatments to slow the rise of PSA are desirable. We studied a combination herbal supplement, Prostate Health Cocktail (PHC), in prostate cancer cell lines and in a population of men with BCR.  Methods:   PC3, LAPC3 and LNCaP cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of PHC suspension. Men previously treated for prostate cancer with surgery, radiation or both with rising PSA but no radiographic metastases were treated with three capsules of PHC daily; the primary end point was 50% PSA decline. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were identified using parylene membrane filters.  Results:   PHC showed a strong dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect in androgen-sensitive and independent cell lines in vitro and suppression of androgen receptor expression. Forty eligible patients were enrolled in the clinical trial. Median baseline PSA was 2.8 ng ml(-1) (1.1-84.1) and 15 men (38%) had a PSA decline on study (1-55% reduction); 25 (62%) had rising PSA on study. The median duration of PSA stability was 6.4 months. Two patients had grade 2/3 transaminitis; the only other grade 2 toxicities were hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia and flatulence. There were no significant changes in testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. CTCs were identified in 19 men (47%).  Conclusions:   Although the primary end point was not met, PHC was well tolerated and was associated with PSA declines and stabilization in a significant number of patients. We believe this is the first report of detecting CTCs in men with BCR prostate cancer.

The laser energy absorption was then used to simulate temperature elevations in the tumour embedded in an elliptical human prostate model. The Arrhenius integral was coupled with the heat transfer model to identify heating protocols to induce 100% damage to the tumour, while resulting in less than 5% damage to the surrounding sensitive prostatic tissue.  Results:   Heating time to achieve 100% damage to the tumour was identified to be approximately 630 s when using a laser irradiance of 7 W/cm2 incident on the prostatic urethral surface. Parametric studies were conducted to show how the local blood perfusion rate and urethral surface cooling affect the heating time to achieve the same thermal dosage. The heating time was shorter when cooling at the urethra was not applied and/or with heat-induced vasculature damage.

Here, we investigated whether the anticancer effects of zerumbone are mediated through inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and whether zerumbone can increase the paclitaxel (PTX) sensitivity of prostate cancer cells. Zerumbone exerted significant cytotoxicity of DU145 versus PC3 prostate cancer cells through cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase followed by apoptosis. Zerumbone selectively inhibited JAK2 in both DU145 and PC3 cells. However, the biological axis of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 was inhibited only in DU145 cells as no STAT3 phosphorylation was detected in PC3 cells even after IL-6 stimulation. Other signaling pathways in DU145 cells remained unaffected. The expression of prostate cancer-associated genes, including cyclin D1, IL-6, COX2, and ETV1, was blocked.

We explore whether IMRT offers further reductions in late rectal toxicity for men already being managed with IGRT and compare this with more gradual changes over time.  Methods:   Between 2007 and 2009, 103 patients with PC were treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT n = 52) or IMRT (n = 51) with doses of 74–78 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction. All men had daily IGRT using intra-prostatic gold fiducials. The primary endpoint was incidence of grade ≥2 late rectal toxicity as graded by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale.  Results:   The relative risk of late grade ≥2 rectal toxicity in patients treated with IMRT was 68% less than seen with image-guided 3D-CRT at 36 months post-treatment (7% versus 22%; hazard ratio = 0.32, P = 0.03). IMRT remained a significant protective factor in a multivariate analysis. A discriminant analysis showed that the relative volume of rectal wall exposed to doses over 50 Gy was most strongly associated with late rectal toxicity. Controlling for duration of follow-up, a later year of treatment was the strongest clinical predictor of late rectal toxicity in multivariate modelling (P = 0.03).  Conclusion:   For men with PC managed to doses of 74–78 Gy with IGRT, IMRT leads to reduced rectal toxicity compared with 3D-CRT.

A novel approach of treatment with a mixture of bioactive compounds that share molecular anti-carcinogenic targets may enhance the effect on these targets at low concentrations of individual compound, thereby overcoming the limitations of reduced bioavailability. We therefore investigated whether a combination of three natural products arctigenin (Arc), a novel anti-inflammatory lignan from the seeds of Arctium lappa, green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and curcumin (Cur) increases the chemopreventive potency of individual compounds. LNCaP prostate cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with 2-4 mg/L (about 5-10μM) Cur, 1μM Arc and 40μM EGCG alone or in combination for 48h. In both cell lines treatment with the mixture of Cur, Arc and EGCG synergistically increased the antiproliferative effect. In LNCaP cells both Arc and EGCG increased the pro-apoptotic effect of Cur. Whereas in MCF-7 cells Arc increased the cell apoptosis of Cur while EGCG enhanced cell cycle arrest of Cur at G0/G1 phase. The strongest effects on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were achieved by combining all three compounds in both cell lines. The combination treatment significantly increased the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 proteins, decreased the activation of NFκB, PI3K/Akt and Stat3 pathways and cell migration compared to individual treatment. These results warrant in vivo studies to confirm the efficacy of this novel regimen by combining Arc and EGCG with Cur to enhance chemoprevention in both prostate and breast cancer.""","""['Piwen Wang', 'Bin Wang', 'Seyung Chung', 'Yanyuan Wu', 'Susanne M Henning', 'Jaydutt V Vadgama']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""RSC Adv""","""['Promotion of the anticancer activity of curcumin based on a metal-polyphenol networks delivery system.', 'Epigallocatechin-3-gallate potentiates the effect of curcumin in inducing growth inhibition and apoptosis of resistant breast cancer cells.', 'Arctigenin in combination with quercetin synergistically enhances the antiproliferative effect in prostate cancer cells.', 'Opposing action of curcumin and green tea polyphenol in human keratinocytes.', 'Role of Curcumin and (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-Gallate in Bladder Cancer Treatment: A Review.', 'Combination of epigallocatechin 3 gallate and curcumin improves D-galactose and normal-aging associated memory impairment in mice.', 'Chemotherapeutic Potential of Saikosaponin D: Experimental Evidence.', 'Phytochemical Combination Is More Effective than Individual Components in Reducing Stress Signaling in Rat Hippocampal Neurons and Microglia In Vitro.', 'Combination Therapy Using Polyphenols: An Efficient Way to Improve Antitumoral Activity and Reduce Resistance.', 'Arctigenin: pharmacology, total synthesis, and progress in structure modification.']"""

In the cabazitaxel and abiraterone sequential treatment (CAST) study, the clinical outcome of docetaxel-treated mCRPC patients treated sequentially with both cabazitaxel and abiraterone was studied. Data were collected retrospectively from mCRPC patients at 12 hospitals across the Netherlands who initiated cabazitaxel and/or abiraterone before December 2012. Primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS); secondary measures were progression-free survival (PFS), biochemical PFS, and best clinical and PSA response. Hospital admission data during treatment were collected, as well as toxicities resulting in treatment discontinuation or patient death. Sixty-three and 69 patients received Cab→Abi (cabazitaxel prior to abiraterone) and Abi→Cab before July 10th, 2013, respectively. Median OS was 19.1 months and 17.0 months in Cab→Abi and Abi→Cab treated patients, respectively (p = 0.369). Median PFS and biochemical PFS were significantly longer in Cab→Abi treated patients: 8.1 versus 6.5 (p = 0.050) and 9.5 versus 7.7 months (p = 0.024), respectively. Although partial responses to cabazitaxel occurred in both groups, Abi→Cab treated patients had a significantly decreased antitumor response from cabazitaxel than Cab→Abi treated patients (median PFS 5.0 versus 2.6 months, p < 0.001). Minor differences in toxicities were observed based on therapy sequence; generally, toxicity from cabazitaxel could be severe, while abiraterone toxicity was milder. This retrospective analysis indicates that primary progression on cabazitaxel or abiraterone did not preclude a response to the other agent in mCRPC patients.

Objective:   We assessed long-term HRQOL following various treatments for localized PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study of HRQOL up to 10 yr after treatment used a prospectively accrued, nationwide PCa registry that collects longitudinal patient-reported HRQOL.  Intervention:   Various primary treatments for localized PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The Medical Outcomes Studies 36-item Short Form and the University of California, Los Angeles, Prostate Cancer Index characterized physical function, mental health, and sexual, urinary, and bowel function and bother. Repeated measures mixed-model analysis assessed change in HRQOL by treatment over time, and logistic regression was used to measure the likelihood of a clinically significant decline in HRQOL.  Results and limitations:   Among 3294 men, 1139 (34%) underwent nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (NSRP), 860 (26%) underwent non-NSRP, 684 (21%) underwent brachytherapy, 386 (12%) underwent external beam radiotherapy, 161 (5%) underwent primary androgen deprivation therapy, and 64 (2%) pursued watchful waiting/active surveillance. Median follow-up was 74 mo (interquartile range: 50-102). Most treatments resulted in early declines in HRQOL, with some recovery over the next 1-2 yr and a plateau in scores thereafter. Surgery had the largest impact on sexual function and bother and on urinary function, radiation had the strongest effect on bowel function, and androgen deprivation therapy had the strongest effect on physical function. The main limitation was attrition among the cohort.  Conclusions:   Although most men experience initial declines in HRQOL in the first 2 yr after treatment, there is little change from 3 to 10 yr and most differences between treatments attenuated over time.

Early markers of prognosis for men treated with IAD have not been described.  Patients and methods:   Men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer were treated with 9 months of leuprolide and flutamide followed by a variable off-treatment interval; AD was resumed when prostate specific antigen (PSA) reached a prespecified value (1 ng/mL, radical prostatectomy; 4 ng/mL, intact prostate).

After androgen deprivation therapy androgen receptor signaling is still active in tumor cells. Persistent intratumor steroidogenesis and androgen receptor changes are responsible for this continued activity, which influences the efficacy of prostate cancer treatment. We hypothesized that combining a 5α-reductase inhibitor and an antiandrogen would block intratumor androgen synthesis and androgen receptor protein activity. Thus, it would act synergistically to reduce tumor cell proliferation.  Materials and methods:   The expression level of 5α-reductase and androgen receptor in endocrine therapy naïve prostate cancer and castration resistant prostate cancer tissues, and cell line models was determined by microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Intracellular androgen was measured with radioimmunoassay. Tumor cell proliferation was determined using coloric MTT assay. The synergistic effects of combination treatments on tumor cell proliferation were calculated using the Chou-Talalay equation.  Results:   In all prostate cancer cases 5α-reductase-1 and 3 were up-regulated. Androgen receptor was up-regulated in metastatic prostate cancer and castration resistant prostate cancer cases. The 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride effectively decreased dihydrotestosterone production in prostate cancer and castration resistant prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, dutasteride combined with the novel antiandrogen enzalutamide synergistically suppressed endocrine therapy naïve prostate cancer and castration resistant prostate cancer cell proliferation.  Conclusions:   In this study the combination of a 5α-reductase inhibitor and (novel) antiandrogens synergistically inhibited tumor cell proliferation.

Methods:   We did a multicentre, open-label, early-access protocol trial in 23 countries. We enrolled patients who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after taxane chemotherapy. Participants received oral doses of abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily) and prednisone (5 mg twice a day) in 28-day cycles until disease progression, development of sustained side-effects, or abiraterone acetate becoming available in the respective country. The primary outcome was the number of adverse events arising during study treatment and within 30 days of discontinuation. Efficacy measures (time to prostate-specific antigen [PSA] progression and time to clinical progression) were gathered to guide treatment decisions. We included in our analysis all patients who received at least one dose of abiraterone acetate. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01217697.  Findings:   Between Nov 17, 2010, and Sept 30, 2013, 2314 patients were enrolled into the early-access protocol trial.

The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were hepatotoxicity (188 [8%]), hypertension (99 [4%]), cardiac disorders (52 [2%]), osteoporosis (31 [1%]), hypokalaemia (28 [1%]), and fluid retention or oedema (23 [1%]). 172 (7%) patients discontinued the study because of adverse events (64 [3%] were drug-related), as assessed by the investigator, and 171 (7%) people died. The funder assessed causes of death, which were due to disease progression (85 [4%]), an unrelated adverse experience (72 [3%]), and unknown reasons (14 [1%]). Of the 86 deaths not attributable to disease progression, 18 (<1%) were caused by a drug-related adverse event, as assessed by the investigator. Median time to PSA progression was 8·5 months (95% CI 8·3-9·7) and median time to clinical progression was 12·7 months (11·8-13·8).  Interpretation:   No new safety signals or unexpected adverse events were found in this early-access protocol trial to assess abiraterone acetate for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who progressed after chemotherapy.

The primary aim was to confirm that coverage of the planning target volume (PTV) with the 95% isodose was within tolerance when the ultrasound-determined bladder volume was within individualised patient limits.  Materials and methods:   Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were acquired on 10 occasions during the course of treatment to assess systematic changes in rectal or bladder volume as part of a standard offline image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) protocol. In addition, through a two-part study an ultrasound scan of the bladder was added to the IGRT protocol. In the Part 1 study, the ultrasound-determined bladder volume at the time of treatment simulation in 26 patients was compared with the simulation computed tomography cranio-caudal bladder length. The relationship between the two was used to establish bladder volume tolerance limits for the interventional component of the Part 2 study. In the Part 2 study, 24 patients underwent ultrasound scanning before treatment. When bladder volumes were outside the specified limits, they were asked to drink more water or void as appropriate until the volume was within tolerance.  Results:   Based on the results of the Part 1 study, a 100 ml tolerance was applied in the Part 2 study. Seventy-six per cent of patients found to have bladder volumes outside tolerance were able to satisfactorily adjust their bladder volumes on demand. Comparing the bladder volumes with the CBCT data revealed that the bladder scanner correctly predicted that the target volume would be accurately targeted (using surrogate end points) in 83% of treatment fractions.  Conclusion:   A simple hand-held ultrasound bladder scanner provides a practical, inexpensive, online solution to confirming that the bladder volume is within acceptable, patient-specific limits before treatment delivery, with the potential to improve overall treatment accuracy.""","""['A Haworth', 'A Paneghel', 'M Bressel', 'A Herschtal', 'D Pham', 'K H Tai', 'R Oates', 'J Gawthrop', 'A Cray', 'F Foroudi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Stereotactic ultrasound for target volume definition in a patient with prostate cancer and bilateral total hip replacement.', 'Megavoltage cone beam computed tomography dose and the necessity of reoptimization for imaging dose-integrated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'The Use of Ultrasound Imaging in the External Beam Radiotherapy Workflow of Prostate Cancer Patients.', ""Prostate only radiotherapy using external beam radiotherapy: A clinician's perspective."", 'Assessment of an ultrasound bladder scanner in prostate radiotherapy: A validation study and analysis of bladder filling variability.']"""

Consequently, AR target genes are prominent candidates to be specific for prostate cancer and also important for the survival of the cancer cells. Here we assess the levels of all hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) enzymes in 15 separate clinical gene expression data sets and identify the last enzyme in the pathway, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1), to be highly overexpressed in prostate cancer. We analyzed 3261 prostate cancers on a tissue microarray and found that UAP1 staining correlates negatively with Gleason score (P=0.0039) and positively with high AR expression (P<0.0001). Cells with high UAP1 expression have 10-fold increased levels of the HBP end-product, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). UDP-GlcNAc is essential for N-linked glycosylation occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and high UAP1 expression associates with resistance against inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation (tunicamycin and 2-deoxyglucose) but not with a general ER stress-inducing agent, the calcium ionophore A23187. Knockdown of UAP1 expression re-sensitized cells towards inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation, as measured by proliferation and activation of ER stress markers. Taken together, we have identified an enzyme, UAP1, which is highly overexpressed in prostate cancer and protects cancer cells from ER stress conferring a growth advantage.""","""['H M Itkonen', 'N Engedal', 'E Babaie', 'M Luhr', 'I J Guldvik', 'S Minner', 'J Hohloch', 'M C Tsourlakis', 'T Schlomm', 'I G Mills']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['N-linked glycosylation supports cross-talk between receptor tyrosine kinases and androgen receptor.', 'O-GlcNAc transferase integrates metabolic pathways to regulate the stability of c-MYC in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Discovery of Novel Inhibitors Targeting Multi-UDP-hexose Pyrophosphorylases as Anticancer Agents.', 'Glycosylation is a global target for androgen control in prostate cancer cells.', 'Structure-Based Insight on the Mechanism of N-Glycosylation Inhibition by Tunicamycin.', 'The Hexosamine Biosynthesis Pathway: Regulation and Function.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-secreted glucosamine alters the androgen biosynthesis program in prostate cancer via HSD3B1 upregulation.', 'Integration of O-GlcNAc into Stress Response Pathways.', 'The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway-related gene signature correlates with immune infiltration and predicts prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma.', 'Identification of hexosamine biosynthesis pathway as a novel prognostic signature and its correlation with immune infiltration in bladder cancer.']"""

Predictive factors and risk groups for cancer diagnosis""","""Objectives:   The diagnosis of prostate cancer is obtained with the performance of a prostate biopsy. Repetition of biopsies is required in patients with negative biopsies when there is high suspicion for cancer. The objective of this study is to know the prostate cancer detection rate in second and third prostatic biopsies and to identify the clinical factors with predictive value for positivity. We also want to establish risk groups for cancer diagnosis after one or two previous negative biopsies.  Methods:   Retrospective study of patients undergoing a second or third prostatic biopsy. We determined the rate of cancer diagnosis for both. We performed univariate and multivariate analysis (multiple logistic regression) to analyse any relationship between clinical variables (PSA, PSA density, PSA F/T ratio, PSA velocity, digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasonography, prostate volume, time between biopsies, pathological result and number of cores obtained in the first biopsy) and positivity in the second and third biopsies. Logistic regression analysis was performed to know which factors are predictors for positivity in 2nd and 3 th biopsies. According to the probabilities obtained, different risk groups were established.  Results:   4.532 patients underwent prostate biopsy between 1999 and 2010. 663 patients were included for second biopsy and 191 for third biopsy. Detection rates for prostate cancer were 24,3% and 17.8% respectively. According to the multivariate analysis, the probability for positivity on second biopsy increases when first biopsy was sextant (p=0,049), patients were >65 years old (p=0,005) and PSA density was >0,15 (p=0,000). Four risk groups were established with a range of probability for prostate cancer between 7 and 37%. For third biopsy, predictive variables were: suspicious digital rectal examination (p=0,007), age >64 years (p=0,009), and PSA density >0,20 (p=0,001). Also risk groups were established with probabilities between 1,6 and 61%.  Conclusions:   Detection rate for prostatic cancer in second and third biopsy is high.

Furthermore, in vitro growth and soft agar assays and in vivo growth experiments were performed to determine the function of DUSP6 in cell proliferation. The results showed that the overexpression of DUSP6 suppressed the invasion and growth of DU‑145 human prostate cancer cells, whereas knockdown of DUSP6 promoted the invasion and proliferation of LNCap human prostate adenocarcinoma cells. Further experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of DUSP6 inhibited the proliferation and liver metastasis of DU‑145 cells in mice. In addition, DUSP6 downregulated the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 3 and interleukin 8 in prostate cancer cells.

Radiotherapy is a major method in the curative treatment of prostate cancer however, up to 30% of the patients experience local relapse. Arachidonic acid metabolites have been shown to have important role in cancer. 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) has been proven to significantly influence prostate cancer progression, by apoptosis regulation and by promoting cancer cell survival. In this study we examined whether 12-LOX inhibition may increase radiation sensitivity of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Prostate cancer cell lines were treated with 12-LOX inhibitors, different doses of radiation and the combination of 12-LOX inhibitors and radiation. We measured the effect of these treatments through clonogenic survival and apoptosis in vitro and tumor growth in vivo in a tumor xenograft model. 12-LOX inhibition and radiation both increased apoptosis and decreased clonogenic survival of prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. Combined treatment resulted in a supra-additive effect in vitro. In vivo both 12-LOX inhibition and radiotherapy caused delay in growth of the xenograft tumors but the combined treatment resulted in the strongest growth inhibition. The presented data prove that 12-LOX and its metabolite 12(S)-HETE have a major role in prostate cancer cell progression and radiosensitivity. We have shown by different methods in vitro and in vivo that inhibition of 12-LOX activity significantly sensitizes prostate cancer cells to radiation.

Local anaesthesia was performed in all patients. A week after the procedure the patients filled in a questionnaire regarding the pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, nycturia, rectal bleeding, haematuria, haematospermia or fever symptoms caused by the implantation. The pain caused by the intervention was scored on a 1-10 scale, where 1 was a very weak and 10 was an unbearable pain. Ten days after the implantation a treatment planning CT was performed and subsequently patients started intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) within one week. During the treatments markers were used for daily verification and correction of patient's setup. No patients experienced fever or infection. Based on the questionnaires nobody experienced dysuria or rectal bleeding after implantation. Among the 60 patients studied, five (8 %) had haematospermia, nine (15 %) haematuria, which lasted in average of 3.4 and 1.8 days, respectively.

Materials and methods:   The analysis included 666 non-contrast-enhanced WB-MRIs performed on a 1.5-T scanner between December 2009 and June 2013 in a private hospital in 451 patients 50 years old and younger and 215 patients over 50 years old. The following images were obtained: T2-STIR (whole body-coronal plane), T2-STIR (whole spine-sagittal), T2-TSE with fat-saturation (neck and trunk-axial), T2-FLAIR (head-axial), 3D T1-GRE (thorax-coronal, axial), T2-TSE (abdomen-axial), chemical shift (abdomen-axial). Detected abnormalities were classified as: insignificant (type I), potentially significant, requiring medical attention (type II), significant, requiring treatment (type III).  Results:   There were 3375 incidental findings depicted in 659 (98.9%) subjects: 2997 type I lesions (88.8%), 363 type II lesions (10.8%) and 15 type III lesions (0.4%), including malignant or possibly malignant lesions in seven subjects. The most differences in the prevalence of abnormalities on WB-MRI between patients 50 years old and younger and over 50 years old concerned: brain infarction (22.2%, 45.0% respectively), thyroid cysts/nodules (8.7%, 18.8%), pulmonary nodules (5.0%, 16.2%), significant degenerative disease of the spine (23.3%, 44.5%), extra-spinal degenerative disease (22.4%, 61.1%), hepatic steatosis (15.8%, 24.9%), liver cysts/hemangiomas (24%, 34.5%), renal cysts (16.9%, 40.6%), prostate enlargement (5.1% of males, 34.2% of males), uterine fibroids (16.3% of females, 37.9% of females).

The prevalence of pituitary tumors in the general population is high. Analyzing the Utah Population Database (UPDB), the authors investigated the co-prevalence of other independent primary tumors in patients with known pituitary tumors, both benign and malignant, and in the relatives of these patients.  Methods:   The authors identified individuals in the Utah Cancer Registry diagnosed with pituitary tumors who also had genealogy data in the UPDB and then calculated relative risks (RRs) of other tumors in these patients and their relatives.  Results:   Among the 591 individuals with pituitary tumors, 16 (2.7%) had a malignant pituitary tumor and 77 (13%) had independent primary tumors of other origin. Overall, this is significantly higher than expected (70.6 expected, p = 0.009) within the general population (RR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.06-1.61). A significant excess for several different cancer sites was observed among the first-, second-, and third-degree relatives of the cases, including prostate and other cancers. Independent primary tumors at other sites have markedly elevated co-prevalence in patients harboring pituitary tumors and among their close and distant relatives.

Methods:   A population-based study was carried out using the English cancer registry linked to administrative hospital data. We included men aged 45 years and older diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2000 and 2008. A complication was considered to have occurred if men had been admitted to hospital as a result of urological causes (urinary tract infection/sepsis, hematuria and urinary retention) within 30 days of the transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate. Multivariable logistic regression was carried out to estimate odds ratios, reflecting the impact of risk factors on the complication rate.  Results:   Of the 198,361 included men, 69% were aged between 65 and 84 years. The 30-day complication rate was 3.7% (1.1% for urinary tract infection/sepsis, 1.4% for hematuria and 1.3% for urinary retention). The most important risk factors were age above 85 years (odds ratio 3.85, 95% confidence interval 3.18-4.67, compared with age below 55 years) and three or more comorbidities (odds ratio 3.50, 95% confidence interval 3.17-5.87, compared with no comorbidity). The overall complication rate increased over time (odds ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.34, 2008 compared with 2000), as did the complication rate as a result of urinary tract infection/sepsis (odds ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.41-2.10, 2008 compared with 2000).  Conclusions:   There has been an increase in the complication rate after transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate in England between 2000 and 2008, predominantly as a result of infections.

Until now, the regulation of this pathway was restricted to the transmembrane class of adenylyl cyclases. In the present study, the role of an alternative source of cAMP, the intracellular localized soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), in the radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells was investigated. Pharmacological inhibition of sAC activity led to marked suppression of proliferation, lactate dehydrogenase release, and induction of apoptosis. The combination of ionizing radiation with partial suppression of sAC activity (~50%) immediately after irradiation synergistically inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of sAC in normal prostate epithelial PNT2 cells increased the cAMP content and accelerated cell proliferation under control conditions. The effects of radiation were significantly reduced in transformed PNT2 cells compared with control cells. Analysis of the underlying cellular mechanisms of sAC-induced radioresistance revealed the sAC-dependent activation of B-Raf/ERK1/2 signaling. In agreement with this finding, inhibition of ERK1/2 in prostate cancer cells enhanced the cytotoxic effect of irradiation. In conclusion, the present study suggests that sAC-dependent signaling plays an important role in the radioresistance of prostate cancer cells.

However, because of the comparable efficacy with better tolerability of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) in patients with metastatic disease, GC has become the most commonly used regimen in the neoadjuvant setting.  Objective:   We aimed to assess real-world pathologic response rates to NAC with different regimens in a large, multicenter cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data were collected retrospectively at 19 centers on patients with clinical cT2-4aN0M0 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who received at least three cycles of NAC, followed by radical cystectomy (RC), between 2000 and 2013.  Intervention:   NAC and RC.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was pathologic stage at cystectomy. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to determine factors predictive of pT0N0 and ≤pT1N0 stages.  Results and limitations:   Data were collected on 935 patients who met inclusion criteria. GC was used in the majority of the patients (n=602; 64.4%), followed by MVAC (n=183; 19.6%) and other regimens (n=144; 15.4%). The rates of pT0N0 and ≤pT1N0 pathologic response were 22.7% and 40.8%, respectively. The rate of pT0N0 disease for patients receiving GC was 23.9%, compared with 24.5% for MVAC (p=0.2). There was no difference between MVAC and GC in pT0N0 on multivariable analysis (odds ratio: 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.34]; p=0.6).  Conclusions:   Response rates to NAC were lower than those reported in prospective randomized trials, and we did not discern a difference between MVAC and GC.

Understanding the limitations of tumor detection, particularly in multifocal disease, is important in its clinical application.  Objective:   To determine predictors of CaP detection by mp-MRI as confirmed by whole-mount histopathology.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective study was performed of 122 consecutive men who underwent mp-MRI before radical prostatectomy at a single referral academic center. A genitourinary radiologist and pathologist collectively determined concordance.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The odds of tumor detection were calculated for clinical, MRI, and histopathologic variables using a multivariate logistic regression model.  Results and limitations:   The 122 patients had 283 unique histologically confirmed CaP tumor foci. Gleason score was 6 in 21 (17%), 7 in 88 (72%), and ≥8 in 13 (11%) patients. Of the 122 cases, 44 (36%) had solitary and 78 (64%) had multifocal tumors. Overall mp-MRI sensitivity for tumor detection was 47% (132/283), with increased sensitivity for larger (102/141 [72%] >1.0 cm), higher-grade (96/134 [72%] Gleason ≥7) tumors, and index tumors (98/122 [80%]). Index tumor status, size, and prostate weight were significant predictors of detection in a multivariate analysis, and multifocality did not adversely impact detection of index tumors. A prostatectomy population was necessary by design, which may limit the ability to generalize these results.  Conclusions:   Sensitivity for tumor detection increased with tumor size and grade. Index tumor status and tumor size were the strongest predictors of tumor detection, regardless of tumor focality. Some 80% of index tumors were detected, but nonindex tumor detection, even of high-grade lesions, was poor. These findings have important implications for focal therapy.

In this study, we investigated the clinical significance of CCL19 and its specific receptor CCR7 and its function in our large collection of prostate samples. Between August 2000 and December 2013, 108 patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer (PCa) and 80 with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) were recruited into the study. Quantitative RT-PCR immunohistochemistry analyses were used to quantify CCL19 and CCR7 expression in PCa cell lines and clinical samples. The functional role of CCL19 in PCa cell lines was evaluated by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the protein followed by analyses of cell proliferation and invasion. The positive rate of CCL19 staining was 87.04 % (94/108) in 108 cases of prostatic carcinoma and 16.25 % (13/80) in 80 cases of BPH, and high expression of CCR7 was observed in 83.33 % (90/108) of the PCa tissues versus (17.50 %; 14/80) of the BPH tissues, the difference of CCL19 and CCR7 expression between two groups was statistically significant, respectively. The results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. CCL19 and CCR7 were significantly elevated in all five PCa cell lines when compared to the RWPE-1 cells. Silencing of CCL19 inhibited the proliferation of DU-145 cells which have a relatively high level of CCL19 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and the invasion and migration of DU-145 cells were distinctly suppressed. Our data suggest that the pathogenesis of human PCa maybe mediated by the CCL19/CCR7 axis, and CCL19 inhibition treatment may provide a promising strategy for the anti-tumor therapy of PCa.""","""['Cheng Peng', 'Keliang Zhou', 'Sensheng An', 'Jie Yang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Retraction Note to multiple articles in Tumor Biology.', 'CC-chemokine receptor 7 is overexpressed and correlates with growth and metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Antitumor efficacy of CC motif chemokine ligand 19 in colorectal cancer.', 'CCL19 suppresses gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the CCL19/CCR7/AIM2 pathway.', 'CIP2A mediates prostate cancer progression via the c-Myc signaling pathway.', 'Does CCL19 act as a double-edged sword in cancer development?', 'Advances in Research on the Effects and Mechanisms of Chemokines and Their Receptors in Cancer.', 'Canine transmissible venereal tumour established in immunodeficient mice reprograms the gene expression profiles associated with a favourable tumour microenvironment to enable cancer malignancy.', 'Investigating Potential Molecular Mechanisms of Carcinogenesis and Genes as Biomarkers for Prognosis of Gastric Cancer Based on Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'CCR7 promote lymph node metastasis via regulating VEGF-C/D-R3 pathway in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Stimulation of osteoclast migration and bone resorption by C-C chemokine ligands 19 and 21.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed androgen levels in 196 men diagnosed with prostate cancer. All patients had undergone systematic needle biopsy, and an additional needle biopsy from the peripheral zone was conducted for the simultaneous determination of T and DHT. We analyzed the relationships between T and DHT levels in tissue and blood and Gleason score, clinical stage, and percentage of positive biopsy cores, using multivariate analysis.  Results:   The median T and DHT levels in blood were 3551.0 pg/mL and 330.5 pg/mL, respectively. There was a strong correlation between serum T and DHT. The median T and DHT levels in prostate tissue were 0.5667 pg/mg and 7.0625 pg/mg, respectively. In multivariate analysis, serum prostate-specific antigen and tissue T levels were significantly associated with poor prognosis; high T levels in prostate tissue were significantly related to high Gleason score (p = 0.041), advanced clinical stage (p = 0.002), and a high percentage of positive biopsy cores (p = 0.001).

Its mechanism of action is not fully understood. This prospective trial evaluated the direct immune effects of systemically administered sipuleucel-T on prostatic cancer tissue in the preoperative setting.  Methods:   Patients with untreated localized prostate cancer were treated on an open-label Phase II study of sipuleucel-T prior to planned radical prostatectomy (RP). Immune infiltrates in RP specimens (posttreatment) and in paired pretreatment biopsies were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Correlations between circulating immune response and IHC were assessed using Spearman rank order.  Results:   Of the 42 enrolled patients, 37 were evaluable. Adverse events were primarily transient, mild-to-moderate and infusion related. Patients developed T cell proliferation and interferon-γ responses detectable in the blood following treatment. Furthermore, a greater-than-three-fold increase in infiltrating CD3(+), CD4(+) FOXP3(-), and CD8(+) T cells was observed in the RP tissues compared with the pretreatment biopsy (binomial proportions: all P < .001). This level of T cell infiltration was observed at the tumor interface, and was not seen in a control group consisting of 12 concurrent patients who did not receive any neoadjuvant treatment prior to RP. The majority of infiltrating T cells were PD-1(+) and Ki-67(+), consistent with activated T cells. Importantly, the magnitude of the circulating immune response did not directly correlate with T cell infiltration within the prostate based upon Spearman's rank order correlation.  Conclusions:   This study is the first to demonstrate a local immune effect from the administration of sipuleucel-T.

The University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center implemented a series of breakfasts to improve cancer awareness, screening, and education among African American men. This article describes the rationale for and history of the community intervention.  Community context:   The 21 breakfasts were held from 2008 through mid-2014 in Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor, Michigan. Ypsilanti ranks below Michigan and the nation on most socioeconomic indicators, although most residents are high school graduates (88% in Ypsilanti and 96.5% in Ann Arbor). African American men in Ypsilanti have higher death rates for diseases associated with poor diet and inadequate physical activity compared with Ypsilanti whites and general populations in Michigan and the nation.  Methods:   We conducted a multicomponent qualitative process evaluation including staff meetings, conversations with participants, and focus groups. We collected 425 post-event surveys to evaluate the breakfasts quantitatively.  Outcomes:   Participants were African American (85%), were aged 51 to 70 years (54%), had health insurance (89%), and had some college education (38%). Fifty-three percent of participants reported interest in the breakfast topics including nutrition; 46%, prostate cancer; 34%, colorectal cancer, and 32%, pain management; 62% reported willingness to participate in a clinical trial.  Interpretation:   African American men are interested in learning about health and are willing to attend a health-focused breakfast series.

Of the men in groups 1 and 2, 20% and 29%, respectively, underwent palliative surgical procedures for locally progressing prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy is feasible in well selected men with metastatic prostate cancer who respond well to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy. These men have a long life expectancy, and cytoreductive radical prostatectomy reduces the risk of locally recurrent prostate cancer and local complications.

While its expression changes during prostate carcinogenesis (PCa), the role of SPDEF in prostate cancer remains controversial due to the lack of genetic mouse models. In present study, we generated transgenic mice with the loss- or gain-of-function of SPDEF in prostate epithelium to demonstrate that SPDEF functions as tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Loss of SPDEF increased cancer progression and tumor cell proliferation, whereas over-expression of SPDEF in prostate epithelium inhibited carcinogenesis and reduced tumor cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Transgenic over-expression of SPDEF inhibited mRNA and protein levels of Foxm1, a transcription factor critical for tumor cell proliferation, and reduced expression of Foxm1 target genes, including Cdc25b, Cyclin B1, Cyclin A2, Plk-1, AuroraB, CKS1 and Topo2alpha. Deletion of SPDEF in transgenic mice and cultures prostate tumor cells increased expression of Foxm1 and its target genes. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between SPDEF and Foxm1 levels was found in human prostate cancers. The two-gene signature of low SPDEF and high FoxM1 predicted poor survival in prostate cancer patients. Mechanistically, SPDEF bound to, and inhibited transcriptional activity of Foxm1 promoter by interfering with the ability of Foxm1 to activate its own promoter through auto-regulatory site located in the -745/-660 bp Foxm1 promoter region. Re-expression of Foxm1 restored cellular proliferation in the SPDEF-positive cancer cells and rescued progression of SPDEF-positive tumors in mouse prostates. Altogether, SPDEF inhibits prostate carcinogenesis by preventing Foxm1-regulated proliferation of prostate tumor cells. The present study identified novel crosstalk between SPDEF tumor suppressor and Foxm1 oncogene and demonstrated that this crosstalk is required for tumor cell proliferation during progression of prostate cancer in vivo.""","""['Xin-Hua Cheng', 'Markaisa Black', 'Vladimir Ustiyan', 'Tien Le', 'Logan Fulford', 'Anusha Sridharan', 'Mario Medvedovic', 'Vladimir V Kalinichenko', 'Jeffrey A Whitsett', 'Tanya V Kalin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['SPDEF is overexpressed in gastric cancer and triggers cell proliferation by forming a positive regulation loop with FoxM1.', 'Foxm1 expression in prostate epithelial cells is essential for prostate carcinogenesis.', 'The transcription factor sterile alpha motif (SAM) pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) is required for E-cadherin expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Signatures of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) in cancer.', 'FOXM1 (Forkhead box M1) in tumorigenesis: overexpression in human cancer, implication in tumorigenesis, oncogenic functions, tumor-suppressive properties, and target of anticancer therapy.', 'Mucus Hypersecretion in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Its Treatment.', 'Overexpressed FOXM1 collaborates with MMB to increase WEE1 inhibitor sensitivity in NSCLC.', 'The development of an anti-cancer peptide M1-21 targeting transcription factor FOXM1.', 'FOXM1: Functional Roles of FOXM1 in Non-Malignant Diseases.', 'Landscape and significance of human super enhancer-driven core transcription regulatory circuitry.']"""

Tumor cells express high levels of PCNA, identifying it as a potentially ideal target for cancer therapy. Previously, we identified nine compounds termed PCNA inhibitors (PCNA-Is) that bind directly to PCNA, stabilize PCNA trimer structure, reduce chromatin-associated PCNA, and selectively inhibit tumor cell growth. Of these compounds, PCNA-I1 is most potent. The purposes of this study were to further investigate the effects of targeting PCNA chromatin association on DNA damage and cytotoxicity and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of PCNA-I1 against tumors in mice. Given the important roles of tumor suppressor p53 in regulating sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutics, we performed studies in two human prostate cancer cell lines differing in p53 expression: LNCaP cells (wild-type p53) and PC-3 cells (p53-null). PCNA-I1 induced DNA damage and apoptosis in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells and enhanced DNA damage and apoptosis triggered by cisplatin. PCNA-I1 also induced autophagy in PC-3 cells. A short-term pretreatment with PCNA-I1 reduced colony formation by 50% in both cell lines. These data suggest that, unlike many other cytotoxic drugs, the effects of PCNA-I1 on tumor cells do not depend on expression of p53. Intravenous administrations of PCNA-I1 significantly retarded growth of LNCaP tumors of in nude mice without causing detectable effects on mouse body weight and hematology profiles.

Methods:   We performed post hoc analyses using data from the Krimpen study, a large community-based study in the Netherlands. All men aged 50-75 years, without prostate or bladder cancer, a history of radical prostatectomy, or neurogenic bladder disease, were invited to participate for a response rate of 50%. At baseline, 1,610 men were included. CVD status was compared to LUTS category, using logistic regression, providing odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (OR 95% CI). For the longitudinal analyses in men without CVD at baseline, hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models with the occurrence of a CVD as outcome variable.  Results:   At baseline, 362 men (22%) had a history of CVD. The ORs for CVD for men with moderate to severe LUTS were 2.04 (unadjusted, 95% CI 1.58-2.63), 1.86 (1.43-2.41, adjusted for age), and 1.81 (1.38-2.37, adjusted for age and other confounders).

The mitotic kinase polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is elevated in prostate cancer, where its expression is linked to tumor grade. Notably, Plk1 signaling and lipid metabolism were identified recently as two of the top five most upregulated pathways in a mouse xenograft model of human prostate cancer. Herein, we show that oxidative stress activates both the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and AR signaling in a Plk1-dependent manner in prostate cells. Inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway prevented oxidative stress-induced activation of AR signaling. Plk1 modulation also affected cholesteryl ester accumulation in prostate cancer via the SREBP pathway. Finally, Plk1 inhibition enhanced cellular responses to androgen signaling inhibitors (ASI) and overcame ASI resistance in both cultured prostate cancer cells and patient-derived tumor xenografts. Given that activation of AR signaling and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is sufficient to elevate SREBP-dependent expression of key lipid biosynthesis enzymes in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), our findings argued that Plk1 activation was responsible for coordinating and driving these processes to promote and sustain the development of this advanced stage of disease.

However, various conditions used during biopsy processing for histologic analysis may affect the performance of diagnostic tests, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), or in situ hybridization (ISH). One such condition that may affect diagnostic test performance is fixation duration in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). For example, prostate needle biopsies are often <1 mm in diameter and thus overfixed. It is important to understand the impact of tissue fixation duration on diagnostic test performance to enable optimized assay procedures. This study was designed to study the effect of 10% NBF fixation duration of prostate needle biopsy on multiplexed quantum dot (QD) ISH assay of ERG and PTEN, 2 genes commonly altered in prostate cancer. The samples were also evaluated for H&E staining and ERG and PTEN IHC. H&E staining and ERG and PTEN IHC were acceptable for all the durations of fixation tested. For QD ISH, we observed good signals with biopsy samples fixed from 4 to 120 hours. Biopsy specimens fixed between 8 and 72 hours gave the best signal as scored by the study pathologist. In a separate cohort of 18 routinely processed prostate biopsy cores, all cores were stained successfully with the QD ISH assay, and results were 100% concordant to ERG and PTEN IHC.

However, their large chemical shift displacement error (CSDE) causes lipid signal contamination in the spectral range of interest. Application of high-bandwidth adiabatic pulses is limited by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition. In this study, we aimed to provide an MRSI sequence that overcomes these limitations.  Methods:   Measurements were performed at 3 T with an endorectal receive coil. A semi-LASER sequence was equipped with low RF power demanding gradient-modulated offset-independent adiabaticity (GOIA) refocusing pulses with WURST(16,4) modulation, with a 10 kHz bandwidth.  Results:   Simulations and phantom studies verified that the GOIA pulses select slices with a flat top and sharp edges and minimal CSDE. The sequence timing was tuned to an optimal citrate signal shape at an echo time of 88 ms. Patient studies (n = 10) demonstrated that high quality spectra with reduced lipid artifacts can be obtained from the whole prostate. Compared with PRESS acquisition at 145 ms the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of citrate is increased up to 2.6 and choline up to 1.3.  Conclusion:   An MRSI sequence of the prostate is presented with minimized spectral lipid contamination and improved SNR, to facilitate routine clinical acquisition of metabolic data.""","""['Isabell K Steinseifer', 'Jack J A van Asten', 'Elisabeth Weiland', 'Tom W J Scheenen', 'Marnix C Maas', 'Arend Heerschap']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['Ultra-high-field MR in Prostate cancer: Feasibility and Potential.', 'Flexible proton 3D MR spectroscopic imaging of the prostate with low-power adiabatic pulses for volume selection and spiral readout.', 'High-Quality 3-Dimensional 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of the Prostate Without Endorectal Receive Coil Using A Semi-LASER Sequence.', 'Short symmetric and highly selective asymmetric first and second order gradient modulated offset independent adiabaticity (GOIA) pulses for applications in clinical MRS and MRSI.', 'Prostate MR imaging at high-field strength: evolution or revolution?', 'Improving the Effective Spatial Resolution in 1H-MRSI of the Prostate with Three-Dimensional Overdiscretized Reconstructions.', 'Emerging MR methods for improved diagnosis of prostate cancer by multiparametric MRI.', 'Ultra-high-field MR in Prostate cancer: Feasibility and Potential.', 'Developments in proton MR spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: a complementary tool to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the identification of aggressive prostate cancer at 3.0T.']"""

Epidemiological and clinical studies indicate that a body mass index >30 is associated with increased oxidative DNA damage within the prostate gland and increased prostate cancer-related mortality. Here we provide evidence that obesity promotes worse clinical outcome through induction of metabolic abnormalities known to promote genotoxic stress. We have previously reported that blood serum derived from obese mice may enhance the proliferative and invasive potential of human prostate cancer cell lines ex vivo. Here we show that a 1-h exposure of LNCaP or PacMetUT1 prostate cancer cell lines and nonmalignant RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells to 2% serum from obese mice induces markers of aerobic glycolysis relative to those exposed to serum from nonobese mice. This metabolic change was correlated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased frequency of DNA double-strand breaks. Interestingly, N-tert-Butylhydroxylamine, an antioxidant, significantly suppressed markers of aerobic glycolysis in the cells exposed to the blood serum of obese mice, suggesting that ROS contributes to a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis.

Methods and findings:   We performed a meta-analysis from population-based observational studies comparing ADT vs control aimed at treating PCa in patients with PCa, reporting either CVD or CVM as outcome. Publications were searched using Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library Central Register of observational studies database up to May 31th 2014, and supplementary searches in publications from potentially relevant journals. 6 studies were identified with a total of 129,802 ADT users and 165,605 controls investigating the relationship between ADT and CVD. The incidence of CVD was 10% higher in ADT groups, although no significant association was observed (HR = 1.10, 95%CIs: 1.00-1.21; P = 0.06). For different types of ADT, CVD was related with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (HR = 1.19, 95%CIs: 1.04-1.36; P<0.001) and GnRH plus oral antiandrogen (AA) (HR = 1.46, 95%CIs: 1.03-2.08; P = 0.04), but not with AA alone or orchiectomy. For CVM, 119,625 ADT users and 150,974 controls from 6 eligible studies were included, pooled results suggested that ADT was associated with CVM (HR = 1.17, 95%CIs: 1.04-1.32; P = 0.01). Significantly increased CVM was also detected in GnRH and GnRH plus AA groups. When patients received other treatments (e.g. prostatectomy and radiotherapy) were ruled out of consideration, more increased CVD (HR = 1.19, 95%CIs: 1.08-1.30; P<0.001) and CVM (HR = 1.30, 95%CIs: 1.13-1.50; P<0.001) were found in men treated with ADT monotherapy.

Magnolol, in a 24-h exposure at 40 and 80 μM, was found to be cytotoxic to cells.

The differences in tissue elasticity and stiffness have been used increasingly in breast cancer imaging and help detect potential tumor lesions in the prostate. In this study we localized prostate cancer lesions using shear wave elastography before radical prostatectomy and assessed the examiner independent elasticity threshold for cancer foci detection.  Materials and methods:   Shear wave elastography scanning of the whole prostate was performed before radical prostatectomy in 60 consecutive patients with high, intermediate and low risk disease. Localization of suspected lesions and density threshold (kPa) were recorded in up to 12 areas and resulted in 703 different fields. Shear wave elastography findings were correlated with final pathology. Initially 381 areas were used to establish shear wave elastography cutoffs (development cohort 32 patients). Subsequently these cutoffs were validated in 322 areas (validation cohort 28 patients).  Results:   Using shear wave elastography significant differences were recorded for the elasticity of benign tissue vs prostate cancer nodules at 42 kPa (range 29 to 71.3) vs 88 kPa (range 54 to 132) (all p <0.001). Median cancer lesion diameter was 26 mm (range 18 to 41). Applying the most informative cutoff of 50 kPa to the validation cohort resulted in 80.9% and 69.1% sensitivity and specificity, respectively, and 74.2% accuracy for detecting cancer nodules based on final pathological finding.

In humans, the primary clearance route for orteronel is renal excretion. Human liver microsomal studies indicated that orteronel weakly inhibits CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, with IC50 values of 17.8, 27.7, 30.8 and 38.8 µm, respectively, whereas orteronel does not inhibit CYP2B6, 2D6 or 3A4/5 (IC50 > 100 µm). Orteronel also does not exhibit time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4/5. The results of a static model indicated an [I]/Ki ratio >0.1 for CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19. Therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between orteronel and theophylline, repaglinide, (S)-warfarin and omeprazole, which are sensitive substrates of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, respectively. Simulation of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of these four CYP substrates in the presence and absence of orteronel revealed geometric mean AUC ratios <1.25. Therefore, in accordance with the 2012 US FDA Draft Guidance on DDIs, orteronel can be labeled a 'non-inhibitor' and further clinical DDI evaluation is not required. In PBPK models of moderate and severe renal impairment, the AUC of orteronel was predicted to increase by 52% and 83%, respectively. These results are in agreement with those of a clinical trial in which AUC increases of 38% and 87% were observed in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.""","""['Chuang Lu', 'Ajit Suri', 'Wen Chyi Shyu', 'Shimoga Prakash']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biopharm Drug Dispos""","""['Inhibition of cytochrome P450 by ethambutol in human liver microsomes.', 'Prediction of cytochrome P450-mediated drug clearance in humans based on the measured activities of selected CYPs.', 'The metabolic drug-drug interaction profile of Dabrafenib: in vitro investigations and quantitative extrapolation of the P450-mediated DDI risk.', 'Prediction of drug-drug interaction potential using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.', 'A Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model to Predict the Impact of Metabolic Changes Associated with Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease on Drug Exposure.', 'Evaluation of Renal Impairment Influence on Metabolic Drug Clearance using a Modelling Approach.', 'Identification of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism of trantinterol using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Utility of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling in oncology drug development and its accuracy: a systematic review.', 'Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model of the CYP2D6 Probe Atomoxetine: Extrapolation to Special Populations and Drug-Drug Interactions.', 'Prediction of the Effect of Renal Impairment on the Pharmacokinetics of New Drugs.']"""

Our recent investigations revealed that FOXA1 as a forkhead transcription factor mediates CDKN2A activation in cellular senescence. However, the contribution of this axis in carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here, using a comprehensive collection of cancer microarray data, we found FOXA1 is down-regulated in many cancers compared to their normal counterparts and the positive correlation between FOXA1 and CDKN2A could be observed in prostate and breast cancers with lower EZH2 (epigenetic repressor for CDKN2A) expression. Experimentally, epistasis analysis in prostate and breast cancer cells indicated that higher expression of FOXA1 opposes EZH2-mediated CDKN2A repression, as further depletion of FOXA1 reverts the de-silencing of CDKN2A caused by EZH2 inhibition. Concomitantly, EZH2-depletion suppresses cancer cell cycle progression and this regulation is optimized in the presence of FOXA1 and CDKN2A. A further oncogenic transformation assay suggested that overexpression of EZH2 is insufficient to block RAS-induced CDKN2A activation and loss of FOXA1 is mandatory to potentiate EZH2-mediated CDKN2A silencing and to bypass the senescence barrier. Importantly, using an in vitro histone methyltransferase (HMTase) system, we found FOXA1 directly inhibits EZH2's histone methyltransferase activity through its C-terminal histone binding motif. These data support that positive regulation of CDKN2A by FOXA1 counteracts its tumorigenic repression of by EZH2 in cancers.""","""['Yu Zhang', 'Tanjun Tong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['EZH2 expression in gliomas: Correlation with CDKN2A gene deletion/ p16 loss and MIB-1 proliferation index.', 'Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 depletion induces cellular senescence via histone demethylation along the INK4/ARF locus.', 'Impact of OGT deregulation on EZH2 target genes FOXA1 and FOXC1 expression in breast cancer cells.', 'Multifaceted role of EZH2 in breast and prostate tumorigenesis: epigenetics and beyond.', 'Implications of Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations of CDKN2A (p16(INK4a)) in Cancer.', 'EZH2: An Accomplice of Gastric Cancer.', 'MZF1 mediates oncogene-induced senescence by promoting the transcription of p16INK4A.', 'EZH2 Exacerbates Breast Cancer by Methylating and Activating STAT3 Directly.', 'Association of Genetic Polymorphisms in FOXA1 with the Progression of Genetic Susceptibility to Gastric Cancer.', 'Identification of De Novo Enhancers Activated by TGFβ to Drive Expression of CDKN2A and B in HeLa Cells.']"""

However, fundamental questions about design and format of delivery remain.  Methods:   An exploratory, randomized mixed-method crossover study was conducted to compare a DVD- and Web-based DESI. Randomized participants used either the Web or the DVD first, followed by the alternative format. Participants completed a questionnaire to assess decision-specific knowledge at baseline and a questionnaire and structured qualitative interview after viewing each format. Tracking software was used to capture Web utilization. Transcripts were analyzed using integrated inductive and deductive approaches. Quantitative data were analyzed using exploratory bivariate and multivariate analyses.  Results:   Exploratory knowledge analyses suggest that both formats increased knowledge, with limited evidence that the DVD increased knowledge more than the Web. Format preference varied across participants: 44% preferred the Web, 32% preferred the DVD and 24% preferred 'both'. Patient discussions of preferences for DESI information structure and the importance of a patients' stage of a given decision suggest these characteristics may be important factors underlying variation in utilization, format preferences and knowledge outcomes.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that both DESI formats effectively increase knowledge. Patients' perceptions of these two formats further suggest that there may be no single 'best' format for all patients. These results have important implications for understanding why different DESI formats might be preferable to and more effective for different patients. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between these factors and DESI utilization outcomes across diverse patient populations.""","""['Meghan C Halley', 'Katharine A S Rendle', 'Katherine A Gillespie', 'Katherine M Stanley', 'Dominick L Frosch']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Health Expect""","""['The effect of patient narratives on information search in a web-based breast cancer decision aid: an eye-tracking study.', ""Clinicians' perceptions of digital vs. paper-based decision support interventions."", 'Internet Versus DVD Decision Aids for Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis.', 'Decision Aids for Cancer Screening and Treatment Internet.', 'Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions.', 'Effectiveness of a decision aid for colorectal cancer screening on components of informed choice according to educational attainment: A randomised controlled trial.', 'Comparative Effectiveness of Two Interventions to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening for Those at Increased Risk Based on Family History: Results of a Randomized Trial.', 'Knowledge, attitudes, and worries among different health literacy groups before receiving first invitation to colorectal cancer screening: Cross-sectional study.', 'Assessing Preference Shift and Effects on Patient Knowledge and Decisional Conflict: Cross-Sectional Study of an Interactive Prostate-Specific Antigen Test Patient Decision Aid.', 'A review of paper-based advance care planning aids.']"""

However, this concept is challenged by conflicting evidence showing that the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of senescent tumor cells can have pro- as well as antitumorigenic effects. Herein, we report that, in Pten-null senescent tumors, activation of the Jak2/Stat3 pathway establishes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that contributes to tumor growth and chemoresistance. Activation of the Jak2/Stat3 pathway in Pten-null tumors is sustained by the downregulation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11/SHP2, providing evidence for the existence of a novel PTEN/SHP2 axis. Importantly, treatment with docetaxel in combination with a JAK2 inhibitor reprograms the SASP and improves the efficacy of docetaxel-induced senescence by triggering a strong antitumor immune response in Pten-null tumors.

To address this, we compared the transcriptional effects of TMPRSS2:ERG expression in a transgenic mouse model with those of ERG knockdown in a TMPRSS2:ERG-positive PC cell line. This reveals that ERG represses the expression of a previously unreported set of androgen receptor (AR)-independent neuronal genes that are indicative of neuroendocrine (NE) cell differentiation-in addition to previously reported AR-regulated luminal genes. Cell sorting and proliferation assays performed after sustained ERG knockdown indicate that ERG drives proliferation and blocks the differentiation of prostate cells to both NE and luminal cell types. Inhibition of ERG expression in TMPRSS2:ERG-positive PC cells through blockade of AR signaling is tracked with increased NE gene expression. We also provide evidence that these NE cells are resistant to pharmacological AR inhibition and can revert to the phenotype of parental cells upon restoration of AR/ERG signaling.

An internet survey was compiled from 38 photomicrographs showing duct proliferations: 14 signed out as high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), 17 IDC, and 7 invasive cribriform/ductal carcinoma. Each image was assessed for the presence of 9 histologic criteria ascribed to IDC. Thirty-nine respondents were asked to rate images as (1) benign/reactive, (2) HGPIN, (3) borderline between HGPIN and IDC, (4) IDC, or (5) invasive cribriform/ductal carcinoma. Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.68. There was 70% overall agreement with HGPIN, 43% with IDC, and 73% with invasive carcinoma (P < .001, χ(2)). Respondents considered 19 (50%) of 38 cases as IDC candidates, of which 5 (26%) had a two-thirds consensus for IDC; two-thirds consensus for either borderline or IDC was reached in 9 (47%). Two-thirds consensus other than IDC was reached in the remaining 19 of 38 cases, with 15 supporting HGPIN and 4 supporting invasive carcinoma. Findings that differed across diagnostic categories were lumen-spanning neoplastic cells (P < .001), 2× benign duct diameters (P < .001), duct space contours (round, irregular, and branched) (P < .001), papillary growth (P = .048), dense cribriform or solid growth (both P = .023), and comedonecrosis (P = .015). When the 19 of 38 images that attained consensus for HGPIN or invasive carcinoma were removed from consideration, lack of IDC consensus was most often attributable to only loose cribriform growth (5/19), central nuclear maturation (5/19), or comedonecrosis (3/19). Of the 9 histologic criteria, only 1 retained significant correlation with a consensus diagnosis of IDC: the presence of solid areas (P = .038). One case that attained IDC consensus had less than 2× duct enlargement yet still had severe nuclear atypia and nucleomegaly. Six fold nuclear enlargement was not significant (P = .083), although no image had both 6× nuclei and papillary or loose cribriform growth: a combination postulated as sufficient criteria for IDC. Finally, 20.5% of respondents agreed that an isolated diagnosis of IDC on needle biopsy warrants definitive therapy, 20.5% disagreed, and 59.0% considered the decision to depend upon clinicopathologic variables. Although IDC diagnosis remains challenging, we propose these criteria: a lumen-spanning proliferation of neoplastic cells in preexisting ducts with a dense cribriform or partial solid growth pattern. Solid growth, in any part of the duct space, emerges as the most reproducible finding to rule in a diagnosis of IDC. Comedonecrosis is a rarer finding, but in most cases, it should rule in IDC. Duct space enlargement to greater than 2× the diameter of the largest, adjacent benign spaces is usually present in IDC, although there may be rare exceptions.""","""['Kenneth A Iczkowski', 'Lars Egevad', 'Jun Ma', 'Nicholas Harding-Jackson', 'Ferran Algaba', 'Athanase Billis', 'Philippe Camparo', 'Liang Cheng', 'David Clouston', 'Eva M Comperat', 'Milton W Datta', 'Andrew G Evans', 'David F Griffiths', 'Charles C Guo', 'Seife Hailemariam', 'Wei Huang', 'Peter A Humphrey', 'Zhong Jiang', 'Hillel Kahane', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Francisco G La Rosa', 'Antonio Lopez-Beltran', 'Gregory T MacLennan', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Jennifer Merrimen', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya', 'Maria M Picken', 'Nagarjun Rao', 'Rajal B Shah', 'Jonathan H Shanks', 'Steven S Shen', 'Ossama W Tawfik', 'Lawrence D True', 'Theodorus Van der Kwast', 'Murali Varma', 'Thomas M Wheeler', 'Debra L Zynger', 'Natasha Sahr', 'David G Bostwick']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Ann Diagn Pathol""","""['Atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: relationship to prostatic carcinoma and implication for diagnosis in prostate biopsies.', 'ETS gene aberrations in atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: Implications for the distinction between intraductal carcinoma of the prostate and cribriform high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Clinicopathological analysis of intraductal proliferative lesions of prostate: intraductal carcinoma of prostate, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and atypical cribriform lesion.', 'Atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: clinical significance, differential diagnosis and current concept of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'Identification of Morphologic Criteria Associated with Biochemical Recurrence in Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'PTEN and DNA Ploidy Status by Machine Learning in Prostate Cancer.', 'Interchangeability of light and virtual microscopy for histopathological evaluation of prostate cancer.', 'Identification of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate on tissue specimens using Raman micro-spectroscopy: A diagnostic accuracy case-control study with multicohort validation.']"""

Methods:   Sixteen patients with prostate cancer underwent mpMRI each of which demonstrated a dominant lesion. There were single lesions in 6 patients, two lesions in 4 and 3 lesions in 6 patients. Two dosimetric models and parameters were compared in each case. The first model used 10mm intervals between needles, and the second model used additional needles at 5 mm intervals between each needle in the boost area.  Results:   Three of thirty-two plans did not achieve the plan objectives. These three plans were in the first model. A higher median urethral volume was seen in the 'unsuccessful' group (2.7 cc, and 1.9 cc, respectively, p-value=0.12). Conformity indices of the second model were also better than the first model (COIN index; 0.716 and 0.643, respectively).  Conclusions:   Focal monotherapy based on mpMRI achieves optimal dosimetry by individualizing the needle positions using 5mm spacing rather than 10mm spacing within the boost volume.

In the present study, four structurally related non-natural (18)F-labeled amino acids, (R)- and (S)-[(18)F]FAMP 1 and (R)- and (S)-[(18)F]MeFAMP 2 have been prepared and evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their potential utility in brain and systemic tumor imaging based upon primarily system A transport with positron emission tomography (PET).  Methods:   The transport of enantiomers of [(18)F]FAMP 1 and [(18)F]MeFAMP 2 was measured through in vitro uptake assays in human derived cancer cells including A549 (lung), DU145 (prostate), SKOV3 (ovary), MDA MB468 (breast) and U87 (brain) in the presence and absence of amino acid transporter inhibitors. The in vivo biodistribution of these tracers was evaluated using tumor mice xenografts at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min post injection.  Results:   All four tracers showed moderate to high levels of uptake (1-9%ID/5×10(5) cells) by the cancer cell lines tested in vitro. AAT cell inhibition assays demonstrated that (R)-[(18)F]1 and (S)-[(18)F]1 entered these tumor cells via mixed AATs, likely but not limited to system A and system L. In contrast, (R)-[(18)F]2 and (S)-[(18)F]2 showed high selectivity for system A AAT. Similar to the results of in vitro cell studies, the tumor uptake of all four tracers was good to high and persisted over the 2 hours time course of in vivo studies. The accumulation of these tracers was higher in tumor than most normal tissues including blood, brain, muscle, bone, heart, and lung, and the tracers with the highest in vitro selectivity for system A AAT generally demonstrated the best tumor imaging properties. Higher uptake of these tracers was observed in the pancreas, kidney and spleen compared to tumors.

Methods:   We collected the 13 most frequently used mAbs against GCPII and quantitatively characterized their binding to GCPII by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Using a peptide library, we mapped epitopes recognized by a given mAb. Finally, we assessed the applicability of these mAbs to routine experimental setups, including Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry.  Results:   ELISA and SPR analyses revealed that mAbs J591, J415, D2B, 107-1A4, GCP-05, and 2G7 bind preferentially to GCPII in native form, while mAbs YPSMA-1, YPSMA-2, GCP-02, GCP-04, and 3E6 bind solely to denatured GCPII. mAbs 24.4E6 and 7E11-C5.3 recognize both forms of GCPII.

Patients and methods:   Open ended one-on-one interviews were conducted with patients with prostate cancer who had biochemical failure or metastatic cancer to understand the impacts of disease and treatments on patients' perceptions of their lives. Interviews with 25 patients (7 biochemical failure and 18 metastatic) and 6 clinicians were conducted. Patient responses were analyzed to assess whether information saturation (ie, the point at which no new information is collected) was attained and compared with currently available HRQL instruments. The data informed the development of a comprehensive conceptual model illustrating the impacts of advanced disease and treatments. Clinical expert interviews also informed the conceptual model.  Results:   Patients with prostate cancer reported many of the key symptoms already captured by current measures, such as bone pain, urinary functioning, bowel functioning, and fatigue. However, a number of impacts reported as bothersome by patients were identified that are not fully captured by existing HRQL measures. Specific examples include genital atrophy, muscle atrophy, stamina, body image, and emotional well-being.  Conclusion:   The conceptual model identified herein describes the impacts of prostate cancer and its treatments from the patient's perspective. The model can be useful in identifying key concepts important to patients that should be measured in trials to capture treatment benefits. The model also can help inform the selection of patient-reported outcomes to assess these benefits.""","""['Oliver Sartor', 'Emuella Flood', 'Kathleen Beusterien', 'Josephine Park', 'Iain Webb', 'David MacLean', 'Bruce J O Wong', 'H Mark Lin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Constructing a conceptual framework of patient-reported outcomes for metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life in early breast cancer.', 'Prostate cancer active surveillance and health-related quality of life: results of the Finnish arm of the prospective trial.', 'Development of a Standardized Set of Patient-centered Outcomes for Advanced Prostate Cancer: An International Effort for a Unified Approach.', 'Health-related quality of life, satisfaction, and economic outcome measures in studies of prostate cancer screening and treatment, 1990-2000.', 'Conceptual assessment of HRQOL among Japanese non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) patients.', 'Impact of fatigue on quality of life among breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.', 'Body image, self-esteem, and sense of masculinity in patients with prostate cancer: a qualitative meta-synthesis.', 'Prostate cancer.', 'Promotional Payments Made to Urologists by the Pharmaceutical Industry and Prescribing Patterns for Targeted Therapies.']"""

To date, few studies have focused on this effect of other tumor marker levels. Therefore, we evaluated the dilution effects of a higher plasma volume on lowering the serum concentration of various tumor markers such as CA125 and CA19-9. Data from patients (age ≥40 years) visiting our public health center between March 2007 and March 2013 were gathered. A total of 19,439 male and 11,655 female native Koreans were eligible to have a serum CA125 and CA19-9 screening for ovarian and pancreatic cancer, respectively. CA125 levels in 11,234 women were analyzed. There was a statistically significant trend toward a lower likelihood of having a serum CA125 level >35 U/mL with increased body mass index (BMI), with obese men having a 53.1% lower likelihood than those with a normal BMI. After CA19-9 analysis in 29,978 participants, there was also a significant trend toward a lower likelihood of having a serum CA19-9 level >35 U/mL with increased BMI, with obese men having a 27.0% and obese women having a 32.7% lower likelihood than those with a normal BMI.

As obesity lowers PSA levels, these observations may be influenced by detection bias. We examined the association between obesity and risk of low- and high-grade prostate cancer in REDUCE, in which biopsies were largely independent of PSA.  Methods:   The REDUCE study tested dutasteride for prostate cancer risk reduction in men with a PSA of 2.5 to 10.0 ng/mL and a negative biopsy. Study participants included 6,729 men who underwent at least one on-study biopsy. The association between baseline body mass index (BMI <25 kg/m(2) normal weight; 25-29.9 kg/m(2) overweight; and ≥30 kg/m(2) obese) and risk of high-grade (Gleason ≥7) or low-grade prostate cancer (Gleason <7) versus no prostate cancer was examined using multinomial logistic regression.  Results:   Overall, 1,739 men (27%) were normal weight, 3,384 (53%) overweight, and 1,304 (20%) were obese. Obesity was associated with lower risk of low-grade prostate cancer in both univariable (OR, 0.74; P = 0.001) and multivariable analyses (OR, 0.79; P = 0.01). In univariable analysis, obesity was not associated with high-grade prostate cancer (OR, 1.08; P = 0.50). However, in multivariable analysis, obesity was associated with increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (OR, 1.28; P = 0.042). This analysis was not able to address how obesity may influence prostate cancer progression.  Conclusions:   Obesity is associated with decreased risk of low-grade and increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. These data provide further support to the hypothesis that obesity is associated with aggressive prostate cancer.  Impact:   Obesity is linked with aggressive prostate cancer.

We report updated outcomes from a long-standing active surveillance cohort and factors associated with reclassification.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data on all men enrolled in the active surveillance cohort at our institution with at least 6 months of followup between 1990 and 2013. Surveillance consisted of quarterly prostate specific antigen testing, repeat imaging with transrectal ultrasound at provider discretion and periodic repeat prostate biopsies. Factors associated with repeat biopsy reclassification and local treatment were determined by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. We also analyzed the association of prostate specific antigen density and outcomes stratified by prostate size.  Results:   A total of 810 men who consented to participate in the research cohort were followed on active surveillance for a median of 60 months. Of these men 556 (69%) met strict criteria for active surveillance. Five-year overall survival was 98%, treatment-free survival was 60% and biopsy reclassification-free survival was 40%. There were no prostate cancer related deaths. On multivariate analysis prostate specific antigen density was positively associated with the risk of biopsy reclassification and treatment while the number of biopsies and time between biopsies were inversely associated with the 2 outcomes (each p <0.01). When stratified by prostate volume, prostate specific antigen density remained significantly associated with biopsy reclassification for all strata but prostate specific antigen density was only significantly associated with treatment in men with a smaller prostate.  Conclusions:   Significant prostate cancer related morbidity and mortality remained rare at intermediate followup. Prostate specific antigen density was independently associated with biopsy reclassification and treatment while on active surveillance.""","""['Christopher J Welty', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Hao Nguyen', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'Nannette Perez', 'Kirsten L Greene', 'June M Chan', 'Maxwell V Meng', 'Jeffry P Simko', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Predictors of pathologic progression on biopsy among men on active surveillance for localized prostate cancer: the value of the pattern of surveillance biopsies.', 'Indications for intervention during active surveillance of prostate cancer: a comparison of the Johns Hopkins and Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) protocols.', 'Risk Factors for Biopsy Reclassification over Time in Men on Active Surveillance for Early Stage Prostate Cancer.', ""Defining 'progression' and triggers for curative intervention during active surveillance."", 'Optimization of prostate biopsy in patients considered for active surveillance.

This study investigates the ability and mechanism by which the functional PEDF peptides PEDF34 and PEDF44 suppress tumor growth. The results showed that death receptor pathway was activated by PEDF34 through up-regulation of FasL and activation of caspase-8 in both xenograft tumor tissues and PC-3 cells. FasL knockdown by siRNA or JNK-p inhibition attenuated apoptosis induced by PEDF34. NF-κB and PPARγ are crucial transcription factors for FasL expression. PEDF34 up-regulated PPARγ but did not affect NF-κB. PEDF34-induced up-regulation of FasL was abolished by siRNA-mediated PPARγ knockdown or using PPARγ inhibitor GW9662, whereas inhibition of NF-κB by the inhibitor PDTC or by siRNA had no effect. Furthermore, activation of JNK is necessary for PEDF34-induced up-regulation of FasL. PEDF34 has stronger hydropathicity and more interactions with laminin receptor than PEDF44. Blocking the laminin receptor abolished the up-regulation of FasL and PPARγ by PEDF34. Moreover, PEDF34 uses a similar mechanism to induce apoptosis in both endothelial and cancer cells. This study provides evidence that PEDF34, not PEDF44, serves as the proapoptotic epitope and exerts proapoptotic activity in both cancer and endothelial cells through activation of the extrinsic death receptor pathway. The dual anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activities of PEDF34 suggest that it may be a promising agent for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Qing Gong', 'Shaopeng Qiu', 'Shuai Li', 'Yuedong Ma', 'Mingyuan Chen', 'Yachao Yao', 'Di Che', 'Juan Feng', 'Weibin Cai', 'Jianxing Ma', 'Xia Yang', 'Guoquan Gao', 'Zhonghan Yang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Two functional epitopes of pigment epithelial-derived factor block angiogenesis and induce differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'PEDF inhibits IL8 production in prostate cancer cells through PEDF receptor/phospholipase A2 and regulation of NFκB and PPARγ.', 'PEDF and 34-mer inhibit angiogenesis in the heart by inducing tip cells apoptosis via up-regulating PPAR-γ to increase surface FasL.', 'Cancer cell apoptotic pathways mediated by PEDF: prospects for therapy.', 'Neuroprotective and antiangiogenic actions of PEDF in the eye: molecular targets and therapeutic potential.', 'Receptors that bind to PEDF and their therapeutic roles in retinal diseases.', 'NANO-SBT-PEDF delivery system: A promising approach against ovarian cancer?', 'Pigment epithelium-derived factor inhibits advanced glycation end product-induced proliferation, VEGF and MMP-9 expression in breast cancer cells via interaction with laminin receptor.', 'Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor and Sex Hormone-Responsive Cancers.', 'Malignant ascites: a source of therapeutic protein against ovarian cancer?']"""

The Canadian Laboratory Initiative on Pediatric Reference Intervals (CALIPER) sought to develop a pediatric database of covariate-stratified reference value distributions for 11 key circulating tumor markers, including those used in assessment of patients with childhood or adult cancers.  Methods:   Healthy community children from birth to 18 years of age were recruited to participate in the CALIPER project with informed parental consent. We analyzed serum samples from 400-700 children (depending on the analyte in question) on the Abbott Architect ci4100 and established reference intervals for α-fetoprotein (AFP), antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg), human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), CA15-3, CA19-9, progastrin-releasing peptide (proGRP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), and total and free prostate specific antigen (PSA) according to CLSI C28-A3 statistical guidelines.  Results:   We observed significant fluctuations in biomarker concentrations by age and/or sex in 10 of 11 biomarkers investigated.

We also showed that the crosstalk between the three proteins facilitates anchorage independent growth and tumor growth in nude mice, and that inhibition of this interaction in prostate and colon cancer cells reduces tumorigenicity. In the present study, we show that treatment with Ras and nucleolin inhibitors reduces the oncogenic effect induced by ErbB1 receptor in U87-MG cells. This combined treatment enhances cell death, reduces cell proliferation and cell migration. Moreover, we demonstrate a pivotal role of nucleolin in ErbB1 activation by its ligand. Nucleolin inhibitor prevents EGF-induced receptor activation and its downstream signaling followed by reduced proliferation. Furthermore, inhibition of Ras by Salirasib (FTS), mainly reduces cell viability and motility. The combined treatment, which targets both Ras and nucleolin, additively reduces tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo.

In this study we show that the STAT3 small molecule inhibitor Stattic caused S-phase accumulation at low-dose levels and led to massive apoptosis at a relatively high-dose level in prostate cancer cells. STAT3 knockdown led to the disruption of the microvascular niche which tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and non-tumor initiating cells (non-TICs)depend on. Primary human prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer cell line contained high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH(high)) subpopulations with stem cell-like characteristics, which expressed higher levels of the active phosphorylated form of STAT3 (pSTAT3) than that of non-ALDH(high) subpopulations. Stattic could singnificantly decrease the population of ALDH(high) prostate cancer cells even at low-dose levels. IL-6 can convert non-ALDH(high) cells to ALDH(high) cells in prostate cancer cell line as well as from cells derived from human prostate tumors, the conversion mediated by IL-6 was abrogated in the presence of STAT3 inhibitor or upon STAT3 knockdown. STAT3 knockdown significantly impaired the ability of prostate cancer cells to initiate development of prostate adenocarcinoma. Moreover, blockade of STAT3 signaling was significantly effective in eradicating the tumor-initiating and bulk tumor cancer cell populations in both prostate cancer cell-line xenograft model and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) models. This data suggests that targeting both tumor initiating and differentiated cell populations by STAT3 inhibition is predicted to have greater efficacy for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Zhiqiang Han', 'Xiaoli Wang', 'Liang Ma', 'Lijuan Chen', 'Min Xiao', 'Liang Huang', 'Yang Cao', 'Jian Bai', 'Ding Ma', 'Jianfeng Zhou', 'Zhenya Hong']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['STAT3 is necessary for proliferation and survival in colon cancer-initiating cells.', 'Stattic and metformin inhibit brain tumor initiating cells by reducing STAT3-phosphorylation.', 'Galiellalactone inhibits stem cell-like ALDH-positive prostate cancer cells.', 'STAT3 signaling in prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance: An oncogenic pathway with diverse functions.', 'Role of STAT3 signaling transduction pathways in cancer stem cell-associated chemoresistance.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'LIN28B Enhanced STAT3 Signaling Regulates Inflammatory Response and Chemotherapeutic Resistance in Cholangiocytes.', 'Impact of STAT Proteins in Tumor Progress and Therapy Resistance in Advanced and Metastasized Prostate Cancer.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Binge-like ethanol drinking activates anaplastic lymphoma kinase signaling and increases the expression of STAT3 target genes in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.']"""

Survival analysis accounting for competing risks was used to provide predictions of other-cause and cancer-specific mortality by age, comorbidity, and tumor risk through 14 years of follow-up.  Results:   Older men had a higher absolute risk of other-cause mortality associated with comorbidity. For men with comorbidity counts of 0, 1, 2, and 3+, cumulative incidence of other-cause mortality at 14 years was 9%, 18%, 30%, and 35% for those younger than 60 years; 26%, 26%, and 48%, and 52% for those aged 60-70 years; and 49%, 57%, 66%, and 74% for those older than 70 years.

XMRV is representative of an early founder virus that jumps species from mouse to human cell lines. Relatively little information is available concerning the XMRV integrase (IN), an enzyme that catalyzes a key stage in the retroviral cycle, and whose sequence is conserved among replication competent retroviruses emerging from recombination between the murine endogenous PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2 genomes. Previous studies have shown that IN inhibitors efficiently block XMRV multiplication in cells. We thus aimed at characterizing the biochemical properties and sensitivity of the XMRV IN to the raltegravir, dolutegravir, 118-D-24 and elvitegravir inhibitors in vitro. We report for the first time the purification and enzymatic characterization of recombinant XMRV IN. This IN, produced in Escherichia coli and purified under native conditions, is optimally active over a pH range of 7-8.5, in the presence of Mg(2+) (15 mM and 30 mM for 3'-processing and strand transfer, respectively) and is poorly sensitive to the addition of dithiothreitol. Raltegravir was shown to be a very potent inhibitor (IC50 ∼ 30 nM) whereas dolutegravir and elvitegravir were less effective (IC50 ∼ 230 nM and 650 nM, respectively). The 118-D-24 drug had no impact on XMRV IN activity. Interestingly, the substrate specificity of XMRV IN seems to be less marked compared to HIV-1 IN since XMRV IN is able to process various donor substrates that share little homology.

A reliable estimation of survival is needed for appropriate treatment strategies. Our goal was to assess the value of simple prognostic factors, namely, patient and tumor characteristics, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and patient-reported scores of pain and quality of life, to predict survival in patients with painful bone metastases.  Methods and materials:   In the Dutch Bone Metastasis Study, 1157 patients were treated with radiation therapy for painful bone metastases. At randomization, physicians determined the KPS; patients rated general health on a visual analogue scale (VAS-gh), valuation of life on a verbal rating scale (VRS-vl) and pain intensity. To assess the predictive value of the variables, we used multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses and C-statistics for discriminative value. Of the final model, calibration was assessed. External validation was performed on a dataset of 934 patients who were treated with radiation therapy for vertebral metastases.  Results:   Patients had mainly breast (39%), prostate (23%), or lung cancer (25%). After a maximum of 142 weeks' follow-up, 74% of patients had died. The best predictive model included sex, primary tumor, visceral metastases, KPS, VAS-gh, and VRS-vl (C-statistic = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.70-0.74). A reduced model, with only KPS and primary tumor, showed comparable discriminative capacity (C-statistic = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.69-0.72). External validation showed a C-statistic of 0.72 (95% CI = 0.70-0.73). Calibration of the derivation and the validation dataset showed underestimation of survival.  Conclusion:   In predicting survival in patients with painful bone metastases, KPS combined with primary tumor was comparable to a more complex model. Considering the amount of variables in complex models and the additional burden on patients, the simple model is preferred for daily use.
