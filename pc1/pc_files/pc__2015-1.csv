The phenolic hydroxyl groups of bergenin were protected by benzyl groups with benzyl bromide. Treatment of dibenzyl bergenin with the corresponding acid in the presence of EDC·HCl and DMAP in CH2Cl2, followed by hydrogenation over Pd/C catalysts, afforded derivatives of bergenin esters. All of the target compounds were identified by IR, MS, and (1)H NMR. Twenty-six novel and three known derivatives of bergenin esters were synthesized. Their cytotoxicity values were evaluated by the MTT assay on the inhibition of DU-145 and BGC-823 cells in vitro. Several triply-substituted (3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7a) and doubly-substituted (8b, 9b) bergenin derivatives exhibited higher cytotoxic activity than bergenin. The result showed that the size of substituents and the lipophilicity of the bergenin esters displayed an important role on their cytotoxic activity.""","""['De-Biao Yan', 'Dong-Ping Zhang', 'Ming Li', 'Wen-Yuan Liu', 'Feng Feng', 'Bin DI', 'Qing-Long Guo', 'Ning Xie']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Chin J Nat Med""","""['Synthesis, isolation, stereostructure and cytotoxicity of paclitaxel analogs from cephalomannine.', 'New sesquiterpenoids from Aglaia odorata var. microphyllina and their cytotoxic activity.', 'Anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic 2-arylbenzofurans from Morus wittiorum.', 'Diversity, pharmacology and synthesis of bergenin and its derivatives: potential materials for therapeutic usages.', 'Cancer Therapy with Phytochemicals: Present and Future Perspectives.', 'Chemistry and Pharmacology of Bergenin or Its Derivatives: A Promising Molecule.', 'Medicinal Plants as Therapeutic Alternatives to Combat Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Advances in adjunct therapy against tuberculosis: Deciphering the emerging role of phytochemicals.', 'Bergenin increases osteogenic differentiation and prevents methylglyoxal-induced cytotoxicity in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts.']"""

Materials and methods:   Human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were treated by As2O3 (1 µmol/L), AA (62.5 µmol/L) and combined drugs (1 µmol/L As2O3 plus 62.5 µmol/L AA). Dynamic morphological characteristics were recorded by Cell-IQ system, and growth rate was calculated. Illumina beadchip assay was used to analyze the differential expression genes in different groups. Synergic effects on differential expression genes (DEGs) were analyzed by mixture linear model and singular value decomposition model. KEGG pathway annotations and GO enrichment analysis were performed to figure out the pathways involved in the synergic effects.  Results:   We captured 1987 differential expression genes in combined therapy MG-63 cells. FAT1 gene was significantly upregulated in all three groups, which is a promising drug target as an important tumor suppressor analogue; meanwhile, HIST1H2BD gene was markedly downregulated in the As2O3 monotherapy group and the combined therapy group, which was found to be upregulated in prostatic cancer. These two genes might play critical roles in synergetic effects of AA and As2O3, although the exact mechanism needs further investigation. KEGG pathway analysis showed many DEGs were related with tight junction, and GO analysis also indicated that DEGs in the combined therapy cells gathered in occluding junction, apical junction complex, cell junction, and tight junction.  Conclusions:   AA potentiates the efficacy of As2O3 in MG-63 cells. Systems biology analysis showed the synergic effect on the DEGs.""","""['X C Huang', 'X Y M Maimaiti', 'C W Huang', 'L Zhang', 'Z B Li', 'Z G Chen', 'X Gao', 'T Y Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['Arsenic trioxide induces apoptosis of cutaneous T cell lymphoma cells: evidence for a partially caspase-independent pathway and potentiation by ascorbic acid (vitamin C).', 'Arsenic trioxide restores ERα expression in ERα-negative human breast cancer cells and its treatment efficacy in combination with tamoxifen in xenografts in nude mice.', 'Apoptosis of MR2 cells induced by Tanshinone II A combined with arsenic trioxide.', 'Efficacy of intratumoral chemotherapy using arsenic trioxide (As2O3) sustained release tablets for the treatment of neurogliocytoma in nude mice.', ""Synergic effect of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine and arsenic trioxide in suppressing hepatoma cells."", 'In vitro Cytotoxicity and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Pharmacological Ascorbate in Dogs.']"""

Studies have shown that AKR1C3 is involved in the development of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and that it is a rational drug target for the treatment of CRPC. Baccharin, a component of Brazilian propolis, has been observed to exhibit a high inhibitory potency and selectivity for AKR1C3 over other AKR1C isoforms and is a promising lead compound for developing more potent and selective inhibitors. Here, we report the screening of fifteen baccharin analogs as selective inhibitors against AKR1C3 versus AKR1C2 (type 3 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase). Among these analogs, the inhibitory activity and selectivity of thirteen compounds were evaluated for the first time. The substitution of the 4-dihydrocinnamoyloxy group of baccharin by an acetate group displayed nanomolar inhibitory potency (IC50: 440 nM) and a 102-fold selectivity over AKR1C2. By contrast, when the cinnamic acid group of baccharin was esterified, there was a dramatic decrease in potency and selectivity for AKR1C3 in comparison to baccharin. Low or sub-micromolar inhibition was observed when the 3-prenyl group of baccharin was removed, and the selectivity over AKR1C2 was low. Although unsubstituted baccharin was still the most potent (IC50: 100 nM) and selective inhibitor for AKR1C3, these data provide structure-activity relationships required for the optimization of new baccharin analogs. They suggest that the carboxylate group on cinnamic acid, the prenyl group, and either retention of 4-dihydrocinnamoyloxy group or acetate substituent on cinnamic acid are important to maintain the high potency and selectivity for AKR1C3.""","""['Tianzhu Zang', 'Kshitij Verma', 'Mo Chen', 'Yi Jin', 'Paul C Trippier', 'Trevor M Penning']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Chem Biol Interact""","""['Synthesis of non-prenyl analogues of baccharin as selective and potent inhibitors for aldo-keto reductase 1C3.', 'Selective inhibition of human type-5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C3) by baccharin, a component of Brazilian propolis.', 'Development of potent and selective inhibitors of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) based on N-phenyl-aminobenzoates and their structure-activity relationships.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibitors of type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C3): overview and structural insights.', 'Computational modeling studies reveal the origin of the binding preference of 3-(3,4-di hydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-ylsulfonyl)benzoic acids for AKR1C3 over its isoforms.', 'Access to Highly Strained Tricyclic Ketals Derived from Coumarins.', 'Analogues of Natural Chalcones as Efficient Inhibitors of AKR1C3.', 'Amide Bond Bioisosteres: Strategies, Synthesis, and Successes.', 'Reversal of Apalutamide and Darolutamide Aldo-Keto Reductase 1C3-Mediated Resistance by a Small Molecule Inhibitor.']"""

Objective:   To investigate whether microRNA (miRNA) affects the synthesis and serum levels of PSA.  Design, setting, and participants:   Reporter assays with PSA and KLK2 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) to confirm posttranscriptional regulation was followed by high-throughput screening of the effect of 1129 miRNAs on PSA levels using reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) to identify individual regulatory miRNAs. The candidate miRNAs were investigated further in vitro by Western blot, immunofluorometrics, activity assays, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, reporter assays, and growth assays. Prostate levels of miR-183 were compared with PSA transcript and serum PSA levels in prostate cancer cohorts.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   RankProd was used to evaluate the RPPAs, and the Student t test was used for the in vitro experiments. The Spearman and Cuzick tests were used in the patient material, and overall survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis.  Results and limitations:   Gain-of-function screenings identified 32 miRNAs that increase PSA levels. One of these, miR-183, was found to bind the 3' UTR of PSA directly and increase both protein and messenger RNA levels. Prostatic levels of miR-183 and serum PSA showed correlation in a cohort of 74 men. In addition, miR-183 promotes cellular growth in vitro and correlates to clinical parameters such as World Health Organisation grade and clinical progression.  Conclusions:   The synthesis and serum levels of PSA are directly affected by miR-183 and may be a factor to consider when PSA values are evaluated in clinical settings.

In this study an analysis of the measurement uncertainties in D 90 from low-dose-rate prostate seed brachytherapy was conducted for two common treatment procedures with two different post-implant dosimetry methods. The analysis was undertaken in order to determine the magnitude of D 90 uncertainty, how the magnitude of the uncertainty varied when D 90 was calculated using different dosimetry methods, and which factors were the major contributors to the uncertainty. The analysis considered the prostate as being homogeneous and tissue equivalent and made use of published data, as well as original data collected specifically for this analysis, and was performed according to the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM). It was found that when prostate imaging and seed implantation were conducted in two separate sessions using only CT images for post-implant analysis, the expanded uncertainty in D 90 values were about 25 % at the 95 % confidence interval. When prostate imaging and seed implantation were conducted during a single session using CT and ultrasound images for post-implant analysis, the expanded uncertainty in D 90 values were about 33 %. Methods for reducing these uncertainty levels are discussed. It was found that variations in contouring the target tissue made the largest contribution to D 90 uncertainty, while the uncertainty in seed source strength made only a small contribution. It is important that clinicians appreciate the overall magnitude of D 90 uncertainty and understand the factors that affect it so that clinical decisions are soundly based, and resources are appropriately allocated.""","""['Kent J Gregory', 'John E Pattison', 'Giovanni Bibbo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Australas Phys Eng Sci Med""","""['A comparative study of seed localization and dose calculation on pre- and post-implantation ultrasound and CT images for low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'A systematic study of imaging uncertainties and their impact on 125I prostate brachytherapy dose evaluation.', 'Prostate post-implant dosimetry: interobserver variability in seed localisation, contouring and fusion.', 'Dosimetry accuracy as a function of seed localization uncertainty in permanent prostate brachytherapy: increased seed number correlates with less variability in prostate dosimetry.', 'Impact of MRI-based postimplant dosimetric assessment in prostate brachytherapy using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images.', 'Feasibility and Clinical Value of CT-Guided 125I Brachytherapy for Pain Palliation in Patients With Breast Cancer and Bone Metastases After External Beam Radiotherapy Failure.', 'Deformable registration of x ray and MRI for postimplant dosimetry in low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'The impact of body mass index on dosimetric quality in low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.']"""

The object under test is irradiated by high-power pulses of electromagnetic energy, which heat tissue and cause thermal expansion. Outgoing TA pressure pulses are detected by ultrasound transducers and reconstructed to provide images of the object. The TA contrast mechanism is strongly dependent upon the frequency of the irradiating electromagnetic pulse. When very high frequency (VHF) electromagnetic irradiation is utilized, TA signal production is driven by ionic content. Prostatic fluids contain high levels of ionic metabolites, including citrate, zinc, calcium, and magnesium. Healthy prostate glands produce more ionic metabolites than diseased glands. VHF pulses are therefore expected to generate stronger TA signal in healthy prostate glands than in diseased glands. A benchtop system for performing ex vivo TA computed tomography with VHF energy is described and images are presented. The system utilizes irradiation pulses of 700 ns duration exceeding 20 kW power. Reconstructions frequently visualize anatomic landmarks such as the urethra and verumontanum. TA reconstructions from three freshly excised human prostate glands with little, moderate, and severe cancerous involvement are compared with histology. TA signal strength is negatively correlated with percent cancerous involvement in this small sample size. For the 45 regions of interest analyzed, a reconstruction value of 0.4 mV provides 100% sensitivity but only 29% specificity. This sample size is far too small to draw sweeping conclusions, but the results warrant a larger volume study including comparison of TA images to the gold standard, histology.""","""['S K Patch', 'D Hull', 'M Thomas', 'S K Griep', 'K Jacobsohn', 'W A See']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Toward Quantitative Whole Organ Thermoacoustics With a Clinical Array Plus One Very Low-Frequency Channel Applied to Prostate Cancer Imaging.', 'Volumetric thermoacoustic imaging over large fields of view.', 'Deconvolution-based deblurring of reconstructed images in photoacoustic/thermoacoustic tomography.', 'Imaging of high-intensity focused ultrasound-induced lesions in soft biological tissue using thermoacoustic tomography.', 'Signal processing in scanning thermoacoustic tomography in biological tissues.', 'Pancreatic Cancer detection via Galectin-1-targeted Thermoacoustic Imaging: validation in an in vivo heterozygosity model.', 'Toward Quantitative Whole Organ Thermoacoustics With a Clinical Array Plus One Very Low-Frequency Channel Applied to Prostate Cancer Imaging.']"""

Conclusion:   PPRT recommendations increased after the reporting of a survival benefit in March 2009, but absolute utilization rates remain low, suggesting that the oncologic community remains unconvinced that PPRT is needed for most patients with adverse features.

Shq1 binds to dyskerin (Cbf5 in yeast) at an early step of H/ACA RNP assembly and is subsequently displaced by the H/ACA RNA. Shq1 contains an N-terminal CS and a C-terminal Shq1-specific domain (SSD). Dyskerin harbors many mutations associated with dyskeratosis congenita. Structures of yeast Shq1 SSD bound to Cbf5 revealed that only a subset of these mutations is in the SSD binding site, implicating another subset in the putative CS binding site. Here, we present the crystal structure of human Shq1 CS (hCS) and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and crystal structures of hCS containing a serine substitution for proline 22 that is associated with some prostate cancers. The structure of hCS is similar to yeast Shq1 CS domain (yCS) and consists of two β-sheets that form an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold. The N-terminal affinity tag sequence AHHHHHH associates with a neighboring protein in the crystal lattice to form an extra β-strand. Deletion of this tag was required to get spectra suitable for NMR structure determination, while the tag was required for crystallization. NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments with peptides derived from putative CS binding sites on dyskerin and Cbf5 revealed a conserved surface on CS important for Cbf5/dyskerin binding.

In this study, we have investigated levels of glycoproteins and their fucosylated glycoforms in sera of Pca patients, as well as the potential utility of fucosylated glycoproteins in the identification of aggressive Pca.  Material and methods:   Serum samples from histomorphology-proven Pca cases were included. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidase 1 (TIMP1) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and their fucosylated glycoforms were captured by Aleuria Aurantia Lectin (AAL), followed by the multiplex magnetic bead-based immunoassay. The level of fucosylated glycoproteins was correlated with patients' Gleason score of the tumor.  Result:   Among three fucosylated glycoproteins, the fucosylated PSA was significantly increased and correlated with the tumor Gleason score (p<0.05). The ratio of fucosylated PSA showed a marked increase in aggressive tumors in comparison to non-aggressive tumors. ROC analysis also showed an improved predictive power of fucosylated PSA in the identification of aggressive Pca.

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genetic program is implicated as a significant contributor to prostate cancer progression. As such, targeting the EMT represents an important therapeutic strategy for preventing or treating prostate cancer metastasis. Berberine is a natural alkaloid with significant antitumor activities against many types of cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which berberine represses the metastatic potential of prostate cancer.  Methods:   The effects of berberine on cell migration and invasion were determined by transwell migration assay and Matrigel invasion assay. Expressions of EMT-related genes were determined by an EMT PCR Array and a quantitative RT-PCR. The prognostic relevance of berberine's modulation of EMT-related genes in prostate cancer was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.  Results:   Berberine exerted inhibitory effects on the migratory and invasive abilities of highly metastatic prostate cancer cells. These inhibitory effects of berberine resulted in significant repression of a panel of mesenchymal genes that regulate the developmental EMT. Among EMT-related genes downregulated by berberine, high BMP7, NODAL and Snail gene expressions of metastatic prostate cancer tissues were associated with shorter survival of prostate cancer patients and provide potential therapeutic interventions.

PIAS1 is an AR- and SUMO-interacting protein and a putative transcriptional coregulator overexpressed in prostate cancer. To study the importance of PIAS1 for the androgen-regulated transcriptome of VCaP prostate cancer cells, we silenced its expression by RNAi. Transcriptome analyses revealed that a subset of the AR-regulated genes is significantly influenced, either activated or repressed, by PIAS1 depletion. Interestingly, PIAS1 depletion also exposed a new set of genes to androgen regulation, suggesting that PIAS1 can mask distinct genomic loci from AR access. In keeping with gene expression data, silencing of PIAS1 attenuated VCaP cell proliferation. ChIP-seq analyses showed that PIAS1 interacts with AR at chromatin sites harboring also SUMO2/3 and surrounded by H3K4me2; androgen exposure increased the number of PIAS1-occupying sites, resulting in nearly complete overlap with AR chromatin binding events. PIAS1 interacted also with the pioneer factor FOXA1. Of note, PIAS1 depletion affected AR chromatin occupancy at binding sites enriched for HOXD13 and GATA motifs.

However, therapies targeting the AR signaling axis eventually fail when prostate cancer progresses to the castrate-resistant stage. Stat5a/b, a candidate therapeutic target protein in prostate cancer, synergizes with AR to reciprocally enhance the signaling of both proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that Stat5a/b sequesters antiandrogen-liganded (MDV3100, bicalutamide, flutamide) AR in prostate cancer cells and protects it against proteasomal degradation in prostate cancer. Active Stat5a/b increased nuclear levels of both unliganded and antiandrogen-liganded AR, as demonstrated in prostate cancer cell lines, xenograft tumors, and clinical patient-derived prostate cancer samples. Physical interaction between Stat5a/b and AR in prostate cancer cells was mediated by the DNA-binding domain of Stat5a/b and the N-terminal domain of AR. Moreover, active Stat5a/b increased AR occupancy of the prostate-specific antigen promoter and AR-regulated gene expression in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, both Stat5a/b genetic knockdown and antiandrogen treatment induced proteasomal degradation of AR in prostate cancer cells, with combined inhibition of Stat5a/b and AR leading to maximal loss of AR protein and prostate cancer cell viability.

The preventive tests now are covered with no deductibles or copayments. Reducing out-of-pocket costs increases premiums, resulting in a subsidy to beneficiaries who use the service by nonusers, and by taxpayers who shoulder the bulk of Medicare's costs. Using Medicare fee-for-service claims and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, we estimate the behavioral and financial consequences of these Balanced Budget Act coverage expansions.

Herein, we investigated the inhibitory effects and associated mechanism/s of action of Procyanidin B2-3,3″-di- O-gallate (B2G2), a major component of grape seed extract, on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human prostate microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Our results showed that B2G2 (10-40 μM) inhibits growth and induces death in both HUVECs and HPMECs. Additional studies revealed that B2G2 causes a G1 arrest in cell cycle progression of HUVECs by down-regulating cyclins (D1 and A), CDKs (Cdk2 and Cdc2) and Cdc25c phosphatase and up-regulating CDK inhibitors (p21 and p27) expression. B2G2 also induced strong apoptotic death in HUVECs through increasing p53, Bax and Smac/Diablo expression while decreasing Bcl-2 and survivin levels. Additionally, B2G2 inhibited the growth factors-induced capillary tube formation in HUVECs and HPMECs. Interestingly, conditioned media (CCM) from prostate cancer (PCA) cells (LNCaP and PC3) grown under normoxic (~21% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions significantly enhanced the tube formation in HUVECs, which was compromised in presence of conditioned media from B2G2-treated PCA cells. B2G2 also inhibited the motility and invasiveness of both HUVECs and HPMECs. Mechanistic studies showed that B2G2 targets VEGFR2/PI3K/Akt and integrin signaling molecules which are important for endothelial cells survival, proliferation, tube formation and motility. Overall, we report that B2G2 inhibits several attributes of angiogenesis in cell culture; therefore, it warrants further investigation for efficacy for angioprevention and cancer control.""","""['Rahul Kumar', 'Gagan Deep', 'Michael F Wempe', 'Rajesh Agarwal', 'Chapla Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Curr Cancer Drug Targets""","""['Differential effect of grape seed extract and its active constituent procyanidin B2 3,3″-di-O-gallate against prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Procyanidin B2 3,3″-di-O-gallate induces oxidative stress-mediated cell death in prostate cancer cells via inhibiting MAP kinase phosphatase activity and activating ERK1/2 and AMPK.', 'Procyanidin B2 3,3(″)-di-O-gallate, a biologically active constituent of grape seed extract, induces apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells via targeting NF-κB, Stat3, and AP1 transcription factors.', 'Increasing traffic on vascular routes.', 'Integrins and cancer.', 'Construction Of High Loading Natural Active Substances Nanoplatform and Application in Synergistic Tumor Therapy.', 'Procyanidin B2 inhibits angiogenesis and cell growth in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells through the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway.', 'Proanthocyanidin B2 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells by suppressing the PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Grape Powder Supplementation Attenuates Prostate Neoplasia Associated with Pten Haploinsufficiency in Mice Fed High-Fat Diet.', 'Tamarind: A diet-based strategy against lifestyle maladies.']"""

Methods:   A cohort of 208 patients cumulatively treated between June 2008 and December 2012 qualified for study inclusion, each undergoing total-gland cryoablation for prostate cancer. The degree of saturated prostate cryoablation was defined as the average prostate volume per cryoprobe (APVC), and divided into four groups (groups 1-4: <3 ml, 3 to <4 ml, 4 to <5 ml, ≧5 ml, respectively). Post-ablative complications were measured prospectively at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 by using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Biochemical failure was gauged by Phoenix criterion. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and Chi-square test were used to compare clinical characteristics of therapeutic subsets. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied for comparison of recurrence risk between groups.  Results:   APVC group 1 had the highest pre-operative PSA value and smallest prostate size among the groups. Multivariate analysis of risks of biochemical failures revealed that the larger the APVC, the higher the hazard (p for trend = 0.01). Compared to the group 1 patients, the hazard ratios of biochemical failures in groups 2-4 were 4.4 (confidence interval (CI): 0.5-37), 8.8 (CI 1.1-73), and 9.4 (CI 1.1-78), respectively.

To clarify the roles of MST4, STK25 and PDCD10 in prostate carcinogenesis, we examined MST4, STK25 and PDCD10 expression in tissue microarray blocks containing 110 cores of BPH and 160 cores of PC immunohistochemically and evaluated their correlation with clinicopathological findings. MST4 was not expressed in all the BPH cases and expressed in 38.7% of PC cases (P < 0.0001). STK25 expression was found in 77.3% of BPH cases and 93.1% of PC cases (P < 0.0001). PDCD10 staining was considered weak in 82 (74.5%) and strong in 28 (25.5%) of BPH cases. However, in prostate cancer cases, PDCD10 staining was weak in 95 (59.4%) and strong in 65 (40.6%) (P < 0.05).

However, its protein expression in human organs and significance in human diseases are unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze HHLA2 protein expression in normal human tissues and cancers, as well as its prognostic significance, to explore mechanisms regulating HHLA2 expression, and to identify candidate HHLA2 receptors.  Experimental design:   An immunohistochemistry protocol and a flow cytometry assay with newly generated monoclonal antibodies were developed to examine HHLA2 protein. HHLA2 gene copy-number variation was analyzed from cancer genomic data. The combination of bioinformatics analysis and immunologic approaches was established to explore HHLA2 receptors.  Results:   HHLA2 protein was detected in trophoblastic cells of the placenta and the epithelium of gut, kidney, gallbladder, and breast, but not in most other organs. In contrast, HHLA2 protein was widely expressed in human cancers from the breast, lung, thyroid, melanoma, pancreas, ovary, liver, bladder, colon, prostate, kidney, and esophagus. In a cohort of 50 patients with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer, 56% of patients had aberrant expression of HHLA2 on their tumors, and high HHLA2 expression was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis and stage. The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that HHLA2 copy-number gains were present in 29% of basal breast cancers, providing a potential mechanism for increased HHLA2 protein expression in breast cancer. Finally, Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2 (TMIGD2) was identified as one of the receptors for HHLA2.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the anticancer properties of four pennogenyl saponins (PS1-PS4) on a panel of human cancer and normal cell lines, and explore the potential mechanisms underlying the selective anticancer effects of the steroidal saponins in cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Differences in the anticancer activity of pennogenyl saponins were examined by MTT assay in human cancer cell lines (HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, UACC-257 melanoma cells, MCF-7 breast and PC-3 prostate cancer cells) and normal human cell lines (L-02 liver cells and HEK293 kidney cells). Flow cytometry analysis, JC-1 staining and western blot analysis were applied to detect the effects of anticancer pennogenyl saponins on apoptosis, cell cycle, and expression and/or activation of main effectors involved in the potential signaling pathways.  Results:   Among the tested four saponins, only PS1 and PS2 selectively inhibited cell growth in HepG2, MCF-7 and PC-3 cells. Moreover, PS1 and PS2 could significantly induce apoptosis and cell cycle G2/M arrest in HepG2 cells, which were at least associated with activation of mitochondrial caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic cascades, inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases.  Conclusions:   PS1 and PS2 had potent and selective anticancer activity to breast, liver and prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   To further clarify the association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and prostate cancer, and assess genetic variability in relation to both LTL and prostate cancer, we performed a nested case-control study (922 cases and 935 controls). The participants provided blood in 1993-1995 and were followed through August 2004 (prostate cancer incidence) or until 28 February 2013 (lethal or fatal prostate cancer). Relative LTL was measured by quantitative PCR and was calculated as the ratio of telomere repeat copy number to a single gene (36B4) copy number (T/S). Genotyping was performed using the TaqMan OpenArray SNP Genotyping Platform. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all prostate cancer and subtypes defined by Gleason grade, stage and lethality (metastasis or death).  Results:   We observed a positive association between each s.d. increase in LTL and all (multivariable-adjusted OR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.22), low-grade (OR 1.13, 95% CI:1.01-1.27), and localised (OR 1.12, 95% CI:1.01-1.24) prostate cancer. Associations for other subtypes were similar, but did not reach statistical significance. In subgroup analyses, associations for high grade and advanced stage (OR=2.04, 95% CI 1.00-4.17; Pinteraction=0.06) or lethal disease (OR=2.37, 95% CI 1.19-4.72; Pinteraction=0.01) were stronger in men with a family history of the disease compared with those without. The minor allele of SNP, rs7726159, which has previously been shown to be positively associated with LTL, showed an inverse association with all prostate cancer risk after correction for multiple testing (P=0.0005).  Conclusion:   In this prospective study, longer LTL was modestly associated with higher risk of prostate cancer. A stronger association for more aggressive cancer in men with a family history of the disease needs to be confirmed in larger studies.""","""['B Julin', 'I Shui', 'C M Heaphy', 'C E Joshu', 'A K Meeker', 'E Giovannucci', 'I De Vivo', 'E A Platz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Leukocyte telomere length is associated with aggressive prostate cancer in localized prostate cancer patients.', 'Prediagnosis Leukocyte Telomere Length and Risk of Ovarian Cancer.', 'Association of leukocyte telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes with endometrial cancer risk in Caucasian Americans.', 'Leukocyte Telomere Length and Pancreatic Cancer Risk: Updated Epidemiologic Review.', 'Association between telomere length and mitochondrial copy number and cancer risk in humans: A meta-analysis on more than 300,000 individuals.', 'The Relationship between Telomere Length and Nucleoplasmic Bridges and Severity of Disease in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Association of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid intake with leukocyte telomere length in US males.', 'Rap1 prevents fusions between long telomeres in fission yeast.', 'Overcoming Obstacles in Liquid Biopsy Developments for Prostate Cancer.', 'Depression, religiosity, and telomere length in the Study on Stress, Spirituality, and Health (SSSH).']"""

Tryptophyllins are a group of peptides mainly found in the skin of members of this genus. In this study, a novel tryptophyllin (TPH) type 3 peptide, named AcT-3, has been isolated and structurally-characterised from the skin secretion and lyophilised skin extract of the red-eye leaf frog, Agalychnis callidryas. The peptide was identified in and purified from the skin secretion by reverse-phase HPLC. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and MS/MS fragmentation sequencing established its primary structure as: pGlu-Gly-Lys-Pro-Tyr-Trp-Pro-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Pro-Glu, with a non-protonated molecular mass of 1538.19Da. The mature peptide possessed the canonical N-terminal pGlu residue that arises from post-translational modification of a Gln residue. The deduced open-reading frame consisted of 63 amino acid residues encoding a highly-conserved signal peptide of approximately 22 amino acid residues, an intervening acidic spacer peptide domain, a single AcT-3 encoding domain and a C terminal processing site. A synthetic replicate of AcT-3 was found to antagonise the effect of BK on rat tail artery smooth muscle and to contract the intestinal smooth muscle preparations.

We demonstrate that DFO, Dp44mT, and DpC significantly decrease constitutive phosphorylation of the STAT3 transcription factor at Tyr705 in the pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 as well as the prostate cancer cell line DU145. These compounds also significantly decrease the dimerized STAT3 levels, the binding of nuclear STAT3 to its target DNA, and the expression of downstream targets of STAT3, including cyclin D1, c-myc, and Bcl-2. Examination of upstream mediators of STAT3 in response to these ligands has revealed that Dp44mT and DpC could significantly decrease activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src and activation of cAbl in DU145 and MIAPaCa-2 cells. In contrast to the effects of Dp44mT, DpC, or DFO on inhibiting STAT3 activation, the negative control compound di-2-pyridylketone 2-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone, or the DFO:Fe complex, which cannot bind cellular iron, had no effect. This demonstrates the role of iron-binding in the activity observed. Immunohistochemical staining of PANC-1 tumor xenografts showed a marked decrease in STAT3 in the tumors of mice treated with Dp44mT or DpC compared with the vehicle.

The diagnostic value of AZGP1 in serum of prostate and breast cancer patients has been reported. Analyzing ""The Cancer Genome Atlas"" data, we found that in colon cancer AZGP1 gene expression was upregulated at transcriptional level. We hypothesized that AZGP1 could be used as a diagnostic marker of colon cancer. First, we confirmed AZGP1 expression was higher in a set of 28 tumor tissues than in normal colonic mucosa tissues by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot in a Chinese population. We verified that serum concentration of AZGP1 was higher in 120 colon cancer patients compared with 40 healthy controls by ELISA (p < 0.001). Then receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive diagnostic value of AZGP1 in serum. The area under the curve (AUC) of AZGP1 was 0.742 (p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.656-0.827) in between the AUC of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the AUC of CA19-9, suggesting that predictive diagnostic value of AZGP1 is between CEA and Carbohydrate 19-9 (CA19-9). The combination of AZGP1 with traditional serum biomarkers, CEA and CA19-9, could result in better diagnostic results. To further validate the diagnostic value of AZGP1, a tissue microarray containing 190 samples of primary colon cancer tissue paired with normal colonic tissue was analysed and the result showed that AZGP1 was significantly upregulated in 68.4% (130 of 190) of the primary cancer lesions. In contrast, there was a weakly positive staining in 29.5% (56 of 190) of the normal colonic tissue samples (p < 0.001).

Due to the lipid-driven metabolic phenotype of PCa, imaging with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) is suboptimal, since tumors tend to have low avidity for glucose.  Procedures:   We have used the fat oxidation inhibitor etomoxir (2-[6-(4-chlorophenoxy)-hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate) that targets carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase-1 (CPT-1) to increase glucose uptake in PCa cell lines. Small hairpin RNA specific for CPT1A was used to confirm the glycolytic switch induced by etomoxir in vitro. Systemic etomoxir treatment was used to enhance [(18)F]FDG-positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG-PET) imaging in PCa xenograft mouse models in 24 h.  Results:   PCa cells significantly oxidize more of circulating fatty acids than benign cells via CPT-1 enzyme, and blocking this lipid oxidation resulted in activation of the Warburg effect and enhanced [(18)F]FDG signal in PCa mouse models.

Patients and methods:   VTBC was established through partnership between urologists performing transperineal biopsies of the prostate (TPB) at three institutions in Melbourne. Consecutive patients who had TPB, as first biopsy or repeat biopsy after previous negative transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy, between September 2009 and September 2013 in the VTBC database were included. Data for each patient were collected prospectively (except for TPB before 2011 in one institution), based on the minimum dataset published by the Ginsburg Study Group. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors predictive of cancer detection on TPB.  Results:   In all, 160 patients were included in the study, of whom 57 had TPB as first biopsy and 103 had TPB as repeat biopsy after previous negative TRUS biopsies. The median patient age at TPB was 63 years, with the repeat-biopsy patients having a higher median serum PSA level (5.8 ng/mL for first biopsy and 9.6 ng/mL for repeat biopsy) and larger prostate volumes (40 mL for first biopsy, and 51 mL for repeat biopsy). Prostate cancer was detected in 53% of first-biopsy patients and 36% of repeat-biopsy patients, of which 87% and 81%, respectively, were clinically significant cancers, defined as a Gleason score of ≥7, or more than three positive cores of Gleason 6. Of the cancers detected in repeat biopsies, 75% involved the anterior region (based on the Ginsburg Study Group's recommended biopsy map), while 25% were confined exclusively within the anterior region; a lower proportion of only 5% of cancers detected in first biopsies were confined exclusively within the anterior region. Age, serum PSA level and prostate volume were predictive of cancer detection in repeat biopsies, while only age was predictive in first biopsies.  Conclusions:   TPB is an alternative approach to TRUS biopsy of the prostate, offering a high rate of detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. It provides excellent sampling of the anterior region of the prostate, which is often under-sampled using the TRUS approach, and should be considered as an option for all men in whom a prostate biopsy is indicated.""","""['Wee Loon Ong', 'Mahesha Weerakoon', 'Sean Huang', 'Eldho Paul', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Daniel Moon', 'Declan Murphy', 'Jeremy Grummet']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Combined T2 and diffusion-weighted MR imaging with template prostate biopsies in men suspected with prostate cancer but negative transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies.', 'Magnetic Resonance and Ultrasound Image Fusion Supported Transperineal Prostate Biopsy Using the Ginsburg Protocol: Technique, Learning Points, and Biopsy Results.', 'Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Patients and methods:   Patients aged <68 years with normal preoperative EF who underwent nsRP for localised prostate cancer (Gleason ≤7, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <10 ng/mL) were randomised after nsRP 1:1:1 to 9-month double-blind treatment with tadalafil 5 mg OaD, tadalafil 20 mg PRN, or placebo, followed by 6-week drug-free washout, and 3-month open-label OaD treatment (all patients). Recovery of EF was defined as an International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-EF domain score of ≥22 and normal orgasmic function was defined based on IIEF Question 10. Both parameters were analysed at the end of washout using logistic regression including terms for treatment, country, visit, visit-by-treatment interaction, age group, nerve-sparing score (perfect = 2, non-perfect >2), and surgical approach (open surgery, robot-assisted laparoscopy, conventional laparoscopy, other). Time to EF recovery was analysed post hoc with a Cox proportional-hazards model including terms for treatment, age-group, country, surgical approach and surgery-by-treatment interaction.  Results:   Of 422 patients treated, 189 underwent open surgery, 115 robot-assisted laparoscopy, 88 conventional laparoscopy and 30 surgery classified as 'other'. The odds of achieving EF recovery at the end of drug-free washout were about twice as high for the robot-assisted laparoscopy group compared with the open surgery group (odds ratio 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24, 4.72; P = 0.029).

This report describes studies performed 30 years ago, which demonstrate utility and shortfalls of xenografting to preclinical modeling.  Methods:   We subcutaneously implanted male nude mice with small prostate cancer fragments from transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) from 29 patients. Successful xenografts were passaged into new host mice. They were characterized using histology, immunohistochemistry for marker expression, flow cytometry for ploidy status, and in some cases by electron microscopy and response to testosterone. Two xenografts were karyotyped by G-banding.  Results:   Tissues from 3/29 donors (10%) gave rise to xenografts that were successfully serially passaged in vivo. Two, (UCRU-PR-1, which subsequently was replaced by a mouse fibrosarcoma, and UCRU-PR-2, which combined epithelial and neuroendocrine features) have been described. UCRU-PR-4 line was a poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma derived from a patient who had undergone estrogen therapy and bilateral castration after his cancer relapsed. Histologically, this comprised diffusely infiltrating small acinar cell carcinoma with more solid aggregates of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The xenografted line showed histology consistent with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and stained positively for prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and the cytokeratin cocktail, CAM5.2, with weak staining for prostate specific antigen (PSA). The line failed to grow in female nude mice. Castration of three male nude mice after xenograft establishment resulted in cessation of growth in one, growth regression in another and transient growth in another, suggesting that some cells had retained androgen sensitivity.

Conclusions:   Xenografts provide a clinically relevant model of prostate cancer, although establishing serially transplantable prostate cancer patient derived xenografts is challenging and requires rigorous characterization and high quality starting material. Xenografting from advanced prostate cancer is more likely to succeed, as xenografting from well differentiated, localized disease has not been achieved in our experience.

Genetic association studies over databases offer an attractive starting point for gene discovery.  Materials and methods:   The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Phenome Genome Integrator (PheGenI) tool was enriched for pancreatic cancer-associated traits. The genes associated with the trait were characterized using diverse bioinformatics tools for Genome-Wide Association (GWA), transcriptome and proteome profile and protein classes for motif and domain.  Results:   Two hundred twenty-six genes were identified that had a genetic association with pancreatic cancer in the human genome. This included 25 uncharacterized open reading frames (ORFs). Bioinformatics analysis of these ORFs identified putative druggable proteins and biomarkers including enzymes, transporters and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling proteins. Secreted proteins including a neuroendocrine factor and a chemokine were identified. Five out of these ORFs encompassed non coding RNAs. The ORF protein expression was detected in numerous body fluids, such as ascites, bile, pancreatic juice, milk, plasma, serum and saliva. Transcriptome and proteome analyses showed a correlation of mRNA and protein expression for nine ORFs. Analysis of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database revealed a strong correlation across copy number variations and mRNA over-expression for four ORFs. Mining of the International Cancer Gene Consortium (ICGC) database identified somatic mutations in a significant number of pancreatic patients' tumors for most of these ORFs. The pancreatic cancer-associated ORFs were also found to be genetically associated with other neoplasms, including leukemia, malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma and prostate carcinomas, as well as other unrelated diseases and disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, coronary diseases, attention deficit disorder and addiction.  Conclusion:   Based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), copy number variations, somatic mutational status and correlation of gene expression in pancreatic tumors at the mRNA and protein level, expression specificity in normal tissues and detection in body fluids, six ORFs emerged as putative leads for pancreatic cancer.

Our group has previously shown that elevated plasma TIMP-1 levels predict poor survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients; however, the underlying source and impact of elevated circulating TIMP-1 protein is unknown.  Methods:   In this study, we used qRT-PCR, ELISA and immunohistochemistry to evaluate TIMP-1 expression in androgen-sensitive and resistant prostate cancer (PC) cell lines, tumor tissues and patient sera, and to correlate TIMP-1 levels to expression of chromogranin A (CGA), an established marker of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). We also explored the relationship between TIMP-1 overexpression and induction of NED by overexpressing TIMP-1 in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells, as well as by inducing NED of LNCaP cells with IL-6.  Results:   Patients with CRPC have significantly higher serum TIMP-1 levels compared to patients with hormone-sensitive disease. Although circulating TIMP-1 levels were increased, peripheral blood cells were not the source of elevation. Instead, elevated TIMP-1 expression was associated with higher expression of CGA in both blood and metastatic tumor tissue. We further show that androgen receptor (AR) and PSA non-expressing prostate cancer cell lines known to display NED phenotypes such as PC-3, PC-3M, and DU145 cells, expressed high levels of TIMP-1, in contrast to AR (+) and PSA (+) adenocarcinoma cell lines such as LNCaP, VCaP, and LAPC-4, which had barely detectable levels of TIMP-1. In addition, ectopic overexpression of TIMP-1 in LNCaP cells did not induce NED. However, TIMP-1 mRNA expression was elevated >10-fold during IL-6-induced NED of LNCaP cells, suggesting that TIMP-1 overexpression accompanies, but is not the driving force for NED. Finally, we show that conditioned media from androgen-resistant PC-3, PC-3M, and DU145 cells induced TIMP-1 mRNA expression in primary prostate stromal fibroblasts in an ERK and NF-κB dependent manner.  Conclusions:   We provide in vitro and clinical evidence to support the association between NED and elevated circulating TIMP-1 expression in CRPC.

Data from epidemiological, eco-environmental, nutritional prevention and clinical trials suggest that selenium Se(IV) can prevent prostate cancer. Selol, a new organic semisynthetic derivative of Se(IV), is a mixture of selenitetriglycerides. This mixture is non-toxic and non-mutagenic, and after po treatment - 56-times less toxic (in mice) than sodium selenite. It exhibits strong anti-cancer activity in vitro in many cancer cell lines and can overcome the cell resistance to doxorubicin. Selol seems a promising compound for prostate cancer therapy.

Results and conclusions:   The anticancer activity of Selol involves perturbation of the redox regulation in the androgen dependent hPCa (LNCaP) cells, but not in healthy cells.

In this study, we investigated the clinical significance of CIP2A and its function in our large collection of prostate samples. Between August 2000 and December 2013, 126 patients with histologically confirmed PCa and 92 with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) were recruited into the study. Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to quantify CIP2A expression in PCa clinical samples and cell lines. The relationships between CIP2A expression and clinicopathological features were analyzed. The functional role of CIP2A in PCa cells was evaluated by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the protein followed by analyses of cell proliferation and invasion. High expression of CIP2A staining was 86.51 % (109/126) in 126 cases of PCa and 17.39 % (16/92) in 92 cases of BPH, and the difference of CIP2A expression between PCa and BPH was statistically significant. CIP2A was significantly elevated in all five PCa cell lines when compared to the RWPE-1 cells at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Silencing of CIP2A inhibited the proliferation of DU-145 cells which have a relatively high level of CIP2A in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and the invasion and migration of DU-145 cells were distinctly suppressed. Furthermore, CIP2A knockdown led to substantial reductions in c-Myc levels in PCa cell lines, but no significant change in phosphorylated Akt expression after CIP2A knockdown in DU-145 cells. Our data suggest that the pathogenesis of human PCa maybe mediated by CIP2A, and CIP2A inhibition treatment may provide a promising strategy for the antitumor therapy of PCa, and thus CIP2A could represent selective targets for the molecularly targeted treatments of PCa.""","""['Zexiong Guo', 'Dehao Liu', 'Zexuan Su']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Erratum to: CIP2A mediates prostate cancer progression via the c-MYC signaling pathway.', 'Retraction Note to multiple articles in Tumor Biology.', 'CIP2A mediates prostate cancer progression via the c-Myc signaling pathway.', 'CC-chemokine receptor 7 is overexpressed and correlates with growth and metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of CIP2A is an independent prognostic indicator in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and its depletion suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth.', 'Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, an emerging human oncoprotein and a potential cancer therapy target.', 'The role of CIP2A in cancer: A review and update.', 'Comparative Proteomic Profiling of Tumor-Associated Proteins in Human Gastric Cancer Cells Treated with Pectolinarigenin.', 'Genistein targets the cancerous inhibitor of PP2A to induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of Pten deficient Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer by Targeting of the SET - PP2A Signaling axis.', 'PP2A inhibition as a novel therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Activation of the Tumor Suppressor PP2A Emerges as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy for Treating Prostate Cancer.']"""

We used two synthetic, non-steroidal LXR agonists, T0901317 and GW3965, to investigate the effects of LXR agonist modulation on prostate specific antigen (PSA) via the expressions of androgen receptors (AR), LXRα, or LXRβ, in prostate carcinoma cells.  Methods:   LXRα- or LXRβ-knockdown cells were transduced with specific shRNA lentiviral particles. LXRα and LXRβ expressions were assessed by immunoblotting and RT-qPCR assays. Cell proliferation was determined by (3) H-thymidine incorporation assays. The effects of LXR agonists and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on PSA expression were determined by ELISA, immunoblotting, or transient gene expression assays.  Results:   Treatment with either T0901317 or GW3965 significantly attenuated cell proliferation of LNCaP cells. T0901317 treatment suppressed PSA expression while GW3965 treatment enhanced PSA expression. The increase of PSA promoter activity by GW3965 was dependent on the expression of AR. Either LXRα- or LXRβ-knockdown did not affect the activation of androgen on PSA gene expression. However, as compared with mock knockdown-LNCaP cells, the LXRα-knockdown but not the LXRβ-knockdown attenuated the effects of T0901317 and GW3965 on PSA expressions.

Using methylation profiling in a series of multi-focal prostate tumours, we identify promoter methylation of the transcription factor HES5 as an early event in prostate tumourigenesis. We confirm that this epigenetic alteration occurs in 86-97% of cases in two independent prostate cancer cohorts (n=49 and n=39 tumour-normal pairs). Treatment of prostate cancer cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased HES5 expression and downregulated its transcriptional target HES6, consistent with functional silencing of the HES5 gene in prostate cancer.

Previous studies have suggested similar associations between a selection of these SNPs and hereditary PC (HPC). Our aim was to evaluate the effect of all known PC risk SNPs and their discriminative value for SPC and HPC.  Methods:   Seventy-four PC susceptibility SNPs (reported in literature up to June 2014) were genotyped in a population-based series of 620 SPC patients, 312 HPC patients from the national Dutch registry and 1819 population-based referents. Association analyses were performed using logistic regression, focusing on directional consistency of the odds ratios (ORs) with those in the original reports, that is, whether the OR was in the same direction as in the original report. Discriminative performance was evaluated by a genetic risk score used in logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.  Results:   Directional consistency was seen for 62 SNPs in SPC and 64 SNPs in HPC, 56 of which overlapped. ORs were mostly higher for HPC with 22 ORs >1.25 versus 5 for SPC. Discriminative performance was better for HPC with an area under the ROC curve of 0.73 versus 0.64 for SPC.  Conclusions:   A large overlap was found for the associations between low-penetrance susceptibility SNPs and SPC and HPC, suggesting a similarity in genetic etiology. This warrants a reconsideration of ""HPC"" and a restrictive policy toward prostate-specific antigen testing in men with a positive family history.

In contrast, when an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity (Auranofin; Au, 1µM), was combined with 2DG+DHEA or DHEA-alone for 24h, clonogenic cell killing was significantly increased in all three human cancer cell lines.

Redox Western blot analysis of PC-3 cells also supported the conclusion that thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) oxidation was enhanced by treatment DHEA+Au and inhibited by NAC. Importantly, normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were not as sensitive to 2DG, DHEA, and Au combinations as their cancer cell counterparts (MDA-MB-231).

Aging is accompanied by a progressive increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 17 (IL-17), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine that becomes dysregulated with age. However, the contribution of IL-17 to age-related prostate tumorigenesis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of age-related IL-17 dysregulation in prostate tumorigenesis.  Methods:   Serum and splenic T-lymphocytes from young GPAT-1 knock-out aging-mimic T cell mice as well as young and aged wild-type mice were collected. shRNA was used to knock down the IL-17 receptor in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and RWPE-1 non-transformed prostate epithelial cells, which were then exposed to the mouse sera or conditioned media from stimulated T-lymphocytes. NF-κB activation, NF-κB target gene expression, and cell proliferation were all measured in these cells by luciferase assay, qPCR, Western blot analysis, and MTT assay, respectively.  Results:   T-lymphocyte-secreted IL-17 from aging-mimic mice induced NF-κB activity and target gene expression in LNCaP and RWPE-1 cells. It also promoted proliferation of these cells.  Conclusion:   Aging-mimic T cell mice produce increased levels of IL-17, which stimulates the pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway in prostate epithelial cells. NF-κB increases inflammation, carcinogenesis and metastatic potential in the prostate. These findings provide evidence that the dysregulation of cytokine production seen in aged T cells may directly contribute to the increased risk for prostate cancer in the elderly.""","""['Alejandra De Angulo', 'Robert Faris', 'Benjamin Daniel', 'Christopher Jolly', 'Linda deGraffenried']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Age-related alterations in T-lymphocytes modulate key pathways in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Commentary on ""age-related alterations in T-lymphocytes modulate key pathways in prostate tumorigenesis.""

Thus, new treatment modalities are urgently needed. Elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidase (Nox) enzymes is implicated in tumorigenesis of the prostate and other tissues. However, the identity of the Nox enzyme(s) involved in prostate carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. Analysis of radical prostatectomy tissue samples and benign and malignant prostate epithelial cell lines identified Nox5 as an abundantly expressed Nox isoform. Consistently, immunohistochemical staining of a human PCa tissue microarray revealed distinct Nox5 expression in epithelial cells of benign and malignant prostatic glands. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Nox5 impaired proliferation of Nox5-expressing (PC-3, LNCaP) but not Nox5-negative (DU145) PCa cell lines. Similar effects were observed upon ROS ablation via the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine confirming ROS as the mediators. In addition, Nox5 silencing increased apoptosis of PC-3 cells. Concomitantly, protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ) protein levels and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation were reduced. Moreover, the effect of Nox5 knockdown on PC-3 cell proliferation could be mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of JNK. Collectively, these data indicate that Nox5 is expressed at functionally relevant levels in the human prostate and clinical PCa. Moreover, findings herein suggest that Nox5-derived ROS and subsequent depletion of PKCζ and JNK inactivation play a critical role in modulating intracellular signaling cascades involved in the proliferation and survival of PCa cells. © 2014 The Authors.

Methods:   We compared the efficacy of our novel RSI-MRI technique with standard MRI for detecting extraprostatic extension (EPE) among 28 PCa patients who underwent MRI and RSI-MRI prior to radical prostatectomy, 10 with histologically proven pT3 disease.

Distortion correction of the RSI maps was performed using the alternating phase-encode technique.  Results:   27 patients were evaluated, excluding one patient where distortion could not be performed.

The survivorship needs in advanced cancer have been overlooked and understudied. The potential role of SCPs for survivors with advanced or metastatic cancer is unknown and was explored in this study.  Methods:   We conducted two focus groups of survivors with advanced or metastatic cancer. Participants reviewed a sample JourneyForward™ SCP modified for advanced cancer. Sessions were audiotaped and transcribed; transcripts and field notes were evaluated using inductive content analysis.  Results:   Sixteen survivors with metastatic cancer participated: 12 (75 %) were female, 15 (94 %) were white, and median age was 66 (range 55-80); 9 participants had breast cancer, 4 colon, 2 prostate, and 1 ovarian cancer. Participants believed that an SCP would be most helpful after initial diagnosis and treatment, but not as helpful once the cancer progressed. They thought a ""cancer care plan"" focusing solely on the current management would be better to concisely summarize the treatment plan and time frame for the next segment of care for those with advanced cancer. Most participants endorsed the need to have written information to reinforce verbal information received during medical visits since it was difficult to remember information provided. Participants expected their oncologist to assume primary responsibility for coordination of the care plan, but anticipated an important supportive role for primary care providers. To this end, they emphasized the need for better communication between providers.  Conclusions:   A cancer care plan developed by the oncologist, similar to an SCP but more focused on current management, may be more useful for survivors with advanced cancer. Exploring this topic in larger groups of more diverse survivors with advanced cancer will help to elucidate the details a written plan of care should contain, and how to promote effective coordination between oncology and primary care providers.  Implications for cancer survivors:   There are many transitions of care along the cancer journey. A written plan of care, similar to an SCP, may be useful for survivors with advanced cancer.""","""['D K Mayer', 'M Green', 'D K Check', 'A Gerstel', 'R C Chen', 'G Asher', 'S B Wheeler', 'L C Hanson', 'D L Rosenstein']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Implementing survivorship care plans for colon cancer survivors.', 'An Assessment to Inform Pediatric Cancer Provider Development and Delivery of Survivor Care Plans.', 'Survivorship care plans: is there buy-in from community oncology providers?', 'The impact of cancer survivorship care plans on patient and health care provider outcomes: a current perspective.', 'Survivorship care plans in cancer: a systematic review of care plan outcomes.', 'Implementation of Survivorship Care Plans in Patients With Glioblastoma.', 'Evaluation of a Technology-Based Survivor Care Plan for Breast Cancer Survivors: Pre-Post Pilot Study.', 'The Needs of Women Treated for Ovarian Cancer: Results From a #gyncsm Twitter Chat.', 'Identifying barriers to cancer survivors sharing their survivorship care plans with their healthcare provider.', 'Survivorship after treatment of pancreatic cancer: insights via an Internet-based survivorship care plan tool.']"""

Among others, TGFβ1 regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) through activation of Smads. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that the αvβ6 integrin interacts with TGFβ receptor II (TβRII) through the β6 cytoplasmic domain and promotes Smad3 activation in prostate cancer (PrCa) cells. Another related αv integrin, αvβ5, as well as the αvβ6/3 integrin, which contains a chimeric form of β6 with a β3 cytoplasmic domain, do not associate with TβRII and fail to show similar responses. We provide evidence that αvβ6 is required for up-regulation of MMP2 by TGFβ1 through a Smad3-mediated transcriptional programme in PrCa cells. The functional relevance of these results is underscored by the finding that αvβ6 modulates cell migration in an MMP2-dependent manner on an αvβ6-specific ligand, latency-associated peptide (LAP)-TGFβ. Overall, these mechanistic studies establish that expression of a single integrin, αvβ6, is sufficient to promote activation of Smad3, regulation of MMP2 levels and consequent catalytic activity, as well as cell migration.

In the current study, we aimed to identify the relative expression of plasma MD-miniRNA and its diagnostic performance in differentiating prostate cancer and prostatic hyperplasia patients from healthy controls, compared with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. All of the clinical participants (63 prostate cancer patients, 32 prostatic hyperplasia patients, and 50 healthy controls) were obtained from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University in China between January 2013 and April 2014. Clinical characteristics were well matched. Plasma samples were extracted to test the relative expression of MD-miniRNA using the method of qRT-PCR. SPSS 22.0 statistical software package was used to analyze the data and GraphPad Prism 6.0 was used to generate the graphs. Relativity expression of plasma MD-miniRNA was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer, compared with prostatic hyperplasia patients and healthy controls. Serum PSA level revealed similar differences among these groups. MD-miniRNA presented a relatively high diagnostic accuracy with AUC of 0.86 (95 % CI 0.80-0.93) in differentiating prostate cancer patients from healthy controls. Simultaneously, MD-miniRNA was able to discriminate prostate cancer patients from prostatic hyperplasia controls with AUC of 0.79 (95 % CI 0.70-0.88). In addition, MD-miniRNA displayed a better diagnostic performance than PSA level. However, the panel of these two biomarkers revealed the best diagnostic performance, compared with either single biomarker. Results of this study showed that plasma MD-miniRNA could serve as a promising and noninvasive biomarker for diagnosing prostate cancer.

NaBu belongs to a class of histone deacetylase inhibitors with potential anticancer function. T-type calcium channel expression constitutes an important route for calcium influx in tumor cells that may trigger changes in cell proliferation and differentiation. In this work we investigated the role NaBu on the differentiation of lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cells and its effect on T-type Ca(2+) channel expression. NaBu stimulates the morphological and molecular differentiation of LNCaP cells. Stimulation of LNCaP cells with NaBu evokes a significant increase in the expression of the Cav3.2 T-type channel subunits. Furthermore, the increased Cav3.2 expression promotes membrane insertion of T-type Ca(2+) channels capable of generating fast inactivating Ca(2+) currents, sensitive to 100μM Ni(2+) ions. Inhibition of T-type Ca(2+) channel function reduces the outgrowth of neurite-like processes in LNCaP cells. NaBu-evoked expression of T-type Ca(2+) channels is also involved in the regulation of cell viability. Inhibition of T-type Ca(2+) channels causes a significant reduction in the viability of LNCaP cells treated with 1mM NaBu, suggesting that Ca(2+) influx via T-type channels can promote cell proliferation. However, increased expression of T-type Ca(2+) channels enhanced the cytotoxic effect of thapsigargin and paclitaxel on cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate that NaBu stimulates T-type Ca(2+) channel expression, thereby regulating both the morphological differentiation and growth of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Erika M Weaver', 'Francis J Zamora', 'Yvonne A Puplampu-Dove', 'Ezechielle Kiessu', 'Jennifer L Hearne', 'Miguel Martin-Caraballo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Functional upregulation of the H2S/Cav3.2 channel pathway accelerates secretory function in neuroendocrine-differentiated human prostate cancer cells.', 'Posttranscriptional regulation of T-type Ca(2+) channel expression by interleukin-6 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Different effect of sodium butyrate on cancer and normal prostate cells.', 'Functional specificity of T-type calcium channels and their roles in neuronal differentiation.', 'T-type calcium channels blockers as new tools in cancer therapies.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'CACNA1D overexpression and voltage-gated calcium channels in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'Butyrate Ameliorates Mitochondrial Respiratory Capacity of The Motor-Neuron-like Cell Line NSC34-G93A, a Cellular Model for ALS.', 'Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of Membrane Transport Proteins: Focus on Cancer and Chemoresistance.', 'Role of Calcium Signaling in Prostate Cancer Progression: Effects on Cancer Hallmarks and Bone Metastatic Mechanisms.']"""

Overcoming this process is a critical step in early cancer development. The druggable orphan nuclear receptor TLX (NR2E1) is characterized as an important regulator of neural stem cells and is also implicated in the development of some brain tumours. However, its exact functional roles in cancer growth regulation still remain unclear. Here we report that TLX can act as a promoter of tumourigenesis in prostate cancer by suppressing oncogene-induced senescence. We determined that TLX exhibited an increased expression in high-grade prostate cancer tissues and many prostate cancer cell lines. Functional studies revealed that TLX could perform an oncogenic function in prostate cancer cells, as its knockdown triggered cellular senescence and cell growth arrest in vitro and in vivo, whereas its over-expression promoted the malignant growth of prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, enhancement of TLX activity, by either ectopic expression or ligand stimulation, could potently prevent doxorubicin-induced senescence in prostate cancer cells and also allow prostatic epithelial cells to escape oncogene-induced senescence induced either by activated oncogene H-Ras(G12V) or knockdown of tumour suppressor PTEN, via a mechanism of direct but differential transcriptional regulation of two senescence-associated genes, repression of CDKN1A and transactivation of SIRT1. Together, our present study shows, for the first time, that TLX may play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis through its suppression of oncogene-induced senescence, and also suggests that targeting the senescence-regulatory TLX is of potential therapeutic significance in prostate cancer.""","""['Dinglan Wu', 'Shan Yu', 'Lin Jia', 'Chang Zou', 'Zhenyu Xu', 'Lijia Xiao', 'Kam-Bo Wong', 'Chi-Fai Ng', 'Franky L Chan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor TLX recruits histone deacetylases to repress transcription and regulate neural stem cell proliferation.', 'ERRgamma suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth of androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells and its implication as a therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1): contemporary view on its role in senescence and oncogenesis.', 'Nuclear Receptor TLX in Development and Diseases.', 'The nuclear receptor TLX (NR2E1) inhibits growth and progression of triple- negative breast cancer.', 'Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-NO signaling axis functions to promote the growth of prostate cancer stem-like cells.', 'Genetic variation of macronutrient tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster.', 'Oleic acid is an endogenous ligand of TLX/NR2E1 that triggers hippocampal neurogenesis.', 'The Transcriptional Repressor Orphan Nuclear Receptor TLX Is Responsive to Xanthines.']"""

Patients and methods:   mCRPC patients with ≥ 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline after 6 cycles of D+P were randomized to either GM-CSF or observation (Obs). At disease progression (PD), D+P was reinitiated for 6 cycles followed by the same ""off chemotherapy"" regimen in patients eligible for chemotherapy interruption. The sequence was repeated until PD during chemotherapy, lack of PSA response to chemotherapy, or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was time to chemotherapy resistance (TTCR).  Results:   Of 125 patients enrolled, 52 (42%) experienced ≥ 50% PSA decline on induction D+P and were randomized to GM-CSF (n = 27) or Obs (n = 25). The median time to PD was 3.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-3.5) and 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.5-2.4) during the initial course of GM-CSF and Obs, respectively. Twelve of 26 (46%) patients responded to a second course of D+P. Eleven randomized patients (21%) experienced PD during chemotherapy, precluding accurate assessment of TTCR. The remaining 41 randomized patients discontinued study for lack of PSA response to chemotherapy (n = 8), patient choice to not restart chemotherapy with PSA PD (n = 13), toxicity (n = 7), or study withdrawal (n = 13).  Conclusion:   Conducting a prospective study in mCRPC with maintenance immunotherapy within the framework of intermittent chemotherapy was feasible.

Objective:   To compare the ability to reduce PC mortality and the risk of overdiagnosis between organized and opportunistic screening.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Göteborg screening study invited 10 000 randomly selected men for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing every 2 yr since 1995, with a prostate biopsy recommended for men with PSA ≥2.5 ng/ml. The control group of 10 000 men not invited has been exposed to a previously reported increased rate of opportunistic PSA testing. Both groups were followed until December 31, 2012.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Observed cumulative PC incidence and mortality rates in both groups were calculated using the actuarial method. Using historical data from 1990-1994 (pre-PSA era), we calculated expected PC incidence and mortality rates in the absence of any PSA testing. The number needed to invite (NNI) and the number needed to diagnose (NND) were calculated by comparing the expected versus observed incidence and mortality rates.  Results and limitations:   At 18 yr, 1396 men were diagnosed with PC and 79 men died of PC in the screening group, compared to 962 and 122, respectively, in the control group. In the screening group, the observed cumulative PC incidence/mortality was 16%/0.98% compared to expected values of 6.8%/1.7%. The corresponding values for the control group were 11%/1.5% and 6.9%/1.7%. Organized screening was associated with an absolute PC-specific mortality reduction of 0.72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.94%) and relative risk reduction of 42% (95% CI 28-54%). There was an absolute reduction in PC deaths of 0.20% (95% CI -0.06% to 0.47%) and a relative risk reduction of 12% (95% CI -5 to 26%) associated with opportunistic PSA testing. NNI and NND were 139 (95% CI 107-200) and 13 for organized biennial screening and 493 (95% CI 213- -1563) and 23 for opportunistic screening. The extent of opportunistic screening could not be measured; incidence trends were used as a proxy.  Conclusions:   Organized screening reduces PC mortality but is associated with overdiagnosis. Opportunistic PSA testing had little if any effect on PC mortality and resulted in more overdiagnosis, with almost twice the number of men needed to be diagnosed to save one man from dying from PC compared to men offered an organized biennial screening program.

However, the pathological role and the regulatory mechanisms of CD44v6 have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, the expression levels of CD44v6 were shown to be significantly higher in ovarian cancer tissues, as compared with adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, the upregulated expression levels of CD44v6 were correlated with disease recurrence and poor survival in patients. The expression of CD44v6 was knocked down in the CAOV3 ovarian cell line, by transfection of a specific small hairpin RNA. The present study showed a correlation between the aggression, viability, invasion and migration of the ovarian cancer cells, with the expression of CD44v6. In addition, the expression of CD44v6 was positively correlated with the expression levels of β‑catenin and tumor growth factor‑β, which indicates that the effects of CD44v6 on ovarian cancer cell aggression may be mediated by these two signaling pathways.

Methods:   From January 2003 to December 2008, 38 pactients with T3a prostate cancer aged from 48 to 81 years (mean: 71 years) were enrolled, with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels ranged from 10.000 to 99.800 µg/L (mean: 56.300 µg/L), Gleason score from 5 to 9 (mean: 7.6) and percentage of positive biopsy cores from 10.0% to 100% (mean: 65.3%). All patients were treated by permanent interstitial brachytherapy combined with external radiotherapy and hormone therapy. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The predictive factors including patient's age, prostate volume, serum pre-treatment PSA, Gleason score and percentage of positive biopsy cores were used for univariate analysis on biochemical failure-free, distant metastasis-free and overall survival.  Results:   The mean follow-up was 69 months (range: 9-109 months).Nineteen patients experienced biochemical failure. The average biochemical failure time was 13.4 months (range: 1-40 months). There were 13 patients developed as distant metastatic prostate cancer since average 19.7 months (range: 1-70 months) after brachytherapy. Of all patients, 9 died of prostate cancer recurrence, while 6 passed away because of other reasons, with an average of 52.2 months (range: 9.0- 98.5 months). The 5-year biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), cancer specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) rate were 44.1%, 68.6%, 82.4 and 75.8%, respectively.

Besides their desired high binding affinity to the receptor, the suitability of radiolabeled peptides as targeting vectors for molecular imaging and therapy depends on additional aspects such as high tumor-to-background ratio, favorable clearance pattern from nontarget tissue, and sufficient metabolic stability in vivo. This study reports how a switch from the prosthetic group, N-succinimidyl-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB), to 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) effects the metabolic pathway of an (18)F-labeled bombesin derivative, QWAV-Sar-H-FA01010-Tle-NH2. (18)F-Labeled bombesin derivatives represent potent peptide ligands for selective targeting of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor-expressing prostate cancer. Radiosynthesis of (18)F-labeled bombesin analogues [(18)F]FBz-Ava-BBN2 and [(18)F]FDG-AOAc-BBN2 was achieved in good radiochemical yields of ~50% at a specific activity exceeding 40 GBq/μmol. Both nonradioactive compounds FBz-Ava-BBN2 and FDG-AOAc-BBN2 inhibited binding of [(125)I]Tyr(4)-bombesin(1-14) in PC3 cells with IC50 values of 9 and 16 nM, respectively, indicating high inhibitory potency. Influence of each prosthetic group was further investigated in PC3 mouse xenografts using dynamic small animal PET imaging. In comparison to [(18)F]FBz-Ava-BBN2, total tumor uptake levels were doubled after injection of [(18)F]FDG-AOAc-BBN2 while renal elimination was increased. Blood clearance and in vivo metabolic stability were similar for both compounds. The switch from [(18)F]SFB to [(18)F]FDG as the prosthetic group led to a significant reduction in lipophilicity which resulted in more favorable renal clearance and increased tumor uptake.

The transketolase-like 1 gene (TKTL1) encodes an enzyme representing an essential component of this pathway. Its expression has been demonstrated to correlate with stage and outcome in various tumors. The aim of the present study was to assess expression patterns and the prognostic role of TKTL1 in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).  Patients and methods:   The expression of TKTL1 was assessed in a tissue microarray consisting of histopathologically benign and malign tissue of 112 patients who underwent radical cystectomy due to MIBC. Cytoplasmatic and nuclear expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry and compared separately with clinicopathologic parameters and outcome.  Results:   Cytoplasmatic expression of TKTL1 was exclusively present in tumor tissue. In contrast, the proportion of nuclei positive for TKTL1 was higher in histopathologically benign tissue compared with malign tissue. No correlation was observed between cytoplasmatic or nuclear TKTL1 expression and tumor stage, grade or the presence of metastases. Patients with lymph node involvement showed a decreased frequency of cytoplasmatic expression compared with node-negative patients (p = 0.01). However, no further correlation was observed between the expression of TKTL1 and clinical outcome of patients.  Conclusions:   The present study shows that the cytoplasmatic expression of TKTL1 is specific for MIBC tissue compared with histopathologically benign urothelium. This specific expression is present in a subgroup of MIBC potentially identifying patients with activated PPP suitable for a targeted inhibition of sugar metabolism.

PC3 human and RM‑1 mouse prostate cancer cells were treated with increasing concentrations of berberine, followed by analysis of the cell viability with an MTT assay. The results demonstrated that berberine markedly inhibited the proliferation of PC3 and RM‑1 cells, and that the inhibitory effects to PC3 and RM‑1 were enhanced in a concentration‑ and time‑dependent manner. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle of PC3 human prostate cancer cells, and the results demonstrated that G0/G1 phase arrest was induced following treatment with 10 µM berberine (P<0.05). However, with an increased concentration of berberine (50 µM) the survival rate of PC3 cells at the G2/M phase was significantly increased compared with the cells treated with 10 µM berberine, which suggests that different cell cycle signaling pathways were activated when PC3 cells were treated with low and high concentrations of berberine.

Results:   The recombinant vector was correctly constructed by DNA sequencing and restriction endonuclease digestion. Myc-CaP cells were successfully transfected with XAGE-1b gene by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. The transfected cells exhibited increased IFN-γ secretion, decreased IL-6 secretion and enhanced killing activity. Tumor grew slower in XAGE-1b-modified FVB mice than in wild-type FVB mice. High dendritic cell expression and low myeloid-derived suppressor cell expression were observed in tumor tissues expressed with XAGE-1b.

Nowadays, voluntary prevention is made more effective thanks to the new sophisticated diagnostic technologies applied worldwide by diagnostic imaging. Epidemiological data about the incidence and causes of death among the Italian population have shown that screening programmes should be aimed first at fighting the following diseases: prostatic carcinoma, lung cancer, colorectal carcinoma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, aortic and peripheral vascular disease. GPs do not generally give good or adequate instructions concerning voluntary prevention programmes; GPs may not even be aware of this type of prevention which could represent a valuable option together with the existing mass screening programmes. Therefore, in the following analysis, we aim to outline the correct diagnostic pathway for the prevention of diseases having the highest incidence in our country and which represent the most frequent causes of death.

Due to the low number of such events, their relationship to dosimetric parameters has not been well characterized.  Methods and materials:   A total of 3126 patients were treated with low dose rate brachytherapy from 1998 through 2010. 2464 had implant alone, and 313 had implant preceded by 44-46Gy supplemental external beam radiation (EBRT). Post-implant dosimetry was based on a CT scan obtained on the day of implant, generally within 30min of the procedure. Every patient's record was reviewed for occurrence of rectal complications.  Results:   Eight of 2464 patients (0.32%) treated with brachytherapy alone developed a radiation-related rectal fistula. Average prostatic and rectal dose parameters were moderately higher for fistula patients than for patients without a severe rectal complication. For instance, the average R100 was 1.2±0.75cc for fistula patients, versus 0.37±0.88cc for non-fistula patients. However, the fistula patients' values were well within the range of values for patients without a rectal complication. Four patients had some attempt at repair or reconstruction, but long-term functional outcomes were not favorable.  Conclusions:   Rectal fistulas are a very uncommon potential complication of prostate brachytherapy, which can occur even in the setting of acceptable day 0 rectal doses. Their occurrence is not easily explained by standard dosimetric or clinical factors.""","""['Kent Wallner', 'Stephen Sutlief', 'Carl Bergsagel', 'Gregory S Merrick']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Morbidity effect of the time gap between supplemental beam radiation and Pd-103 prostate brachytherapy.', 'Rectal bleeding after high-dose-rate brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: impact of rectal dose in high-dose-rate brachytherapy on occurrence of grade 2 or worse rectal bleeding.', 'Dose constraint for minimizing grade 2 rectal bleeding following brachytherapy combined with external beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: rectal dose-volume histogram analysis of 457 patients.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.', 'Importance of post-implant dosimetry in permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Safety and efficacy of 3D-printed templates assisted CT-guided radioactive iodine-125 seed implantation for the treatment of recurrent cervical carcinoma after external beam radiotherapy.', 'Rectotumoral fistula formation occurring more than 5 years after carbon ion radiotherapy for sacral chordoma: A case report.', 'Mesalazine suppository for the treatment of refractory ulcerative chronic radiation proctitis.', 'A Systematic Post-QUANTEC Review of Tolerance Doses for Late Toxicity After Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Pelvic Catastrophe after Elastic Band Ligation in an Irradiated Rectum.']"""

Methods:   From February 1, 2012, through October 31, 2012, preoperative urine samples were obtained from patients with a presumptive diagnosis of RCC based on an imaged renal mass, prostate cancer, or transitional cell bladder cancer. Imaged renal masses were diagnosed postnephrectomy—as malignant or benign—by histology. Urine AQP1 and PLIN2 concentrations were measured by using a sensitive and specific Western blot and normalized to urine creatinine concentration.  Results:   Median concentrations of urine AQP1 and PLIN2 in patients with clear cell and papillary RCC (n=47) were 29 and 36 relative absorbance units/mg urine creatinine, respectively. In contrast, median concentrations in patients with bladder cancer (n=22) and prostate cancer (n=27), patients with chromophobe tumors (n=7), and patients with benign renal oncocytomas (n=9) and angiomyolipomas (n=7) were all less than 10 relative absorbance units/mg urine creatinine (Kruskal-Wallis test, P<.001 vs RCC for both biomarkers) and comparable with those in healthy controls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.99 to 1.00 for both biomarkers.  Conclusion:   These results support the specificity and sensitivity of urine AQP1 and PLIN2 concentrations for RCC.

Early diagnosis and treatment are successful against prostate cancer, yet the clinical treatment of advanced prostate cancer remains a challenge. Gemcitabine is used to treat a broad spectrum of solid tumors; however, the clinical response of prostate cancer patients to gemcitabine is limited. In the present study, we showed that HMGN5, a nucleosome binding protein that can unfold chromatin by binding to histone (H1), is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and plays an oncogenic role in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and development by activating the MAPK signaling pathway. We also found that sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to gemcitabine was positively correlated with HMGN5 expression. Knockdown of HMGN5 expression reduced the sensitivity of PC-3 cells to gemcitabine, and ectopic HMGN5 expression in DU145 cells enhanced the sensitivity to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine decreased HMGN5 expression, consequently leading to inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway and cleavage of the PARP protein. Finally, we showed that PC-3 cells acquire gemcitabine resistance by gradual loss of HMGN5 expression. The present study suggests that HMGN5 is a potential biomarker for treating prostate cancer, and patients with a high level HMGN5 will benefit from gemcitabine treatment.""","""['Zhongqiang Guo', 'Xiaoyu Zhang', 'Xuesong Li', 'Feng Xie', 'Boxing Su', 'Min Zhang', 'Liqun Zhou']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['The high-mobility group nucleosome-binding domain 5 is highly expressed in breast cancer and promotes the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells.', 'HMGN5 knockdown sensitizes prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation.', 'Small interfering RNA targeting HMGN5 induces apoptosis via modulation of a mitochondrial pathway and Bcl-2 family proteins in prostate cancer cells.', 'Research advances in HMGN5 and cancer.', 'HMGN5/NSBP1: a new member of the HMGN protein family that affects chromatin structure and function.', 'Characterization of Novel Progression Factors in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Based on Global Comparative Proteome Analysis.', 'HMGN5 Silencing Suppresses Cell Biological Progression via AKT/MAPK Pathway in Human Glioblastoma Cells.', 'Oncogenic zinc finger protein ZNF322A promotes stem cell-like properties in lung cancer through transcriptional suppression of c-Myc expression.', 'New and Old Genes Associated with Primary and Established Responses to Paclitaxel Treatment in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Knockdown of HMGN5 increases the chemosensitivity of human urothelial bladder cancer cells to cisplatin by targeting PI3K/Akt signaling.']"""

Materials and methods:   From 1995 to 2014 we evaluated 557 and 251 men at very low and at low risk, respectively, who were on active surveillance and compliant with prostate biopsies. Our primary study outcome was reclassification to higher risk disease by grade or extent. Freedom from reclassification was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach with adjustment for covariates using the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   Within the first 2 years of surveillance patient survival free of reclassification by grade (p = 0.20) and by any biopsy criteria (p = 0.25) was similar in men with very low and low risk disease. After 2 years men with low risk disease were 2.4 times more likely to be diagnosed with a Gleason score of greater than 6 than men with very low risk disease (p = 0.002, HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.9-3.5). Additionally, beyond 2 years on surveillance the risk of lifetime reclassification by grade and by any criteria decreased by 30% and 35% (each p <0.0001, HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60-0.76 and HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57-0.72, respectively) with each biopsy that showed no reclassification.  Conclusions:   The reclassification rate during surveillance is not equally distributed across time or risk groups. Due to misclassification at diagnosis the reclassification rate in very low and low risk groups is similar in the first 2 years but differs significantly beyond 2 years. The risk of reclassification decreases with time for each nonreclassifying biopsy beyond 2 years.""","""['Ridwan Alam', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Patricia Landis', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Mufaddal Mamawala']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Obesity is associated with risk of progression for low-risk prostate cancers managed expectantly.', 'Outcomes of Active Surveillance after Initial Surveillance Prostate Biopsy.', 'Extended followup and risk factors for disease reclassification in a large active surveillance cohort for localized prostate cancer.', 'Active surveillance: the Canadian experience.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'The impact of age on prostate cancer progression and quality of life in active surveillance patients.', 'Determining Clinically Based Factors Associated With Reclassification in the Pre-MRI Era using a Large Prospective Active Surveillance Cohort.', 'Super active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer | Opinion: Yes.', 'Active surveillance outcomes in prostate cancer patients: the use of transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy for patient selection.', 'Randomized Trial of Partial Gland Ablation with Vascular Targeted Phototherapy versus Active Surveillance for Low Risk Prostate Cancer: Extended Followup and Analyses of Effectiveness.']"""

The PC-3 cells were cultured under hypoxia or normoxia for 48 h and were then treated with increasing concentrations of pristimerin from 0 to 0.8 µmol/l, under normoxia. Hypoxia‑inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was detected by western blotting. Proliferation was assessed with the CCK-8 assay. Transwell invasion assay was used to analyze the potency of invasion. Stem cell characteristics were detected by sphere formation, colony formation assay and western blotting, including CD44, KLF4, OCT4 and AGO2, which are stem cell characteristic-related markers. EMT was confirmed by the expression changes of EMT-related markers, including N-cadherin, fibronectin, vimentin and ZEB1, which were evaluated by western blotting. The addition of pristimerin to the medium reduced the hypoxia-induced PC-3 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Pristimerin effectively inhibited hypoxia‑induced invasion of the PCa cells in vitro. Moreover, the treatment of cells with pristimerin induced the reversal of hypoxia-induced stem cell characteristics and EMT, which was confirmed by sphere formation, colony formation assay and the expression changes of CSC- and EMT-related markers. The reversal of hypoxia‑induced stem cell characteristics and EMT in the PCa cells by low-dose pristimerin was dose‑dependent. These results showed that treatment with pristimerin may be a potential strategy for the suppression of hypoxia-induced metastasis through the reversal of hypoxia-induced stem cell characteristics and EMT in cancer cells, which justifies the potential use of pristimerin as a practical chemopreventive approach for patients with PCa.""","""['Jianwei Zuo', 'Yuanqing Guo', 'Xinsheng Peng', 'Yubo Tang', 'Xintao Zhang', 'Peiheng He', 'Shuaihua Li', 'Qingde Wa', 'Jinglei Li', 'Shuai Huang', 'Dongliang Xu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Pristimerin Inhibits Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis by Targeting PC-3 Stem Cell Characteristics and VEGF-Induced Vasculogenesis of BM-EPCs.', 'MiR-21 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression in third-sphere forming breast cancer stem cell-like cells.', 'Anti-cancer effect of pristimerin by inhibition of HIF-1α involves the SPHK-1 pathway in hypoxic prostate cancer cells.', 'The biological kinship of hypoxia with CSC and EMT and their relationship with deregulated expression of miRNAs and tumor aggressiveness.', 'Alternative splicing modulates cancer aggressiveness: role in EMT/metastasis and chemoresistance.', ""Let's Go 3D!

From a large population-based database, this study aimed to report prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) rates of men diagnosed with various presentations of prostate cancer and to examine the adequacy of the current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.  Patients and methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1997 to 2005. PCSM was reported by the classification of extent of disease provided by the SEER database, for clinically staged and pathologically staged cohorts.  Results:   Using the cumulative incidence method, PCSM at 10 years for all patients (n = 354,326) was 5% for clinically localized (CL) lesions, 7% for T3aN0M0, 14% for T3bN0M0, 26% for T4N0M0, 27% for TanyN1M0, and 66% for TanyNanyM1. Within the pathologically staged subgroup (n = 108,135), PCSM at 10 years was 1% for CL lesions, 4% for T3aN0M0, 9% for T3bN0M0, 9% for T4N0M0, and 19% for TanyN1M0.  Conclusion:   Staging of any disease site aims to accurately communicate, prognosticate, and guide management for that particular level of disease. Stage IV prostate cancer is a diverse group, with PCSM in the subgroups ranging from 9% to 68% in this study.

Among patients, 7 cases were treated with debris spondylectomy (group A), 7 cases with piecemeal spondylectomy (group B), 6 cases with total en bloc spondylectomy (group C). Statistical analysis was used to compare the three groups with respect to surgical trauma (including operative time, transoperative bleeding, and intraoperative blood transfusion), clinical symptoms (by VAS score at 1 week after operation), surgical procedures conditions (by AP and lateral X-rays), and long-term results (by recurrence and death information).  Results:   All patients were followed up from 6 to 36 months with an average of (16.50 ± 7.88) months. Operative time for debris spondylectomy was (6.14 ± 0.68) h, intraoperative bleeding was (3 457.14 ± 399.40) ml, and intraoperative blood transfusion was (2 771.43 ± 423.14) ml. Operative time for piece-meal spondylectomy was (4.93 ± 0.61) h, intraoperative bleeding was (1 942.86 ± 378.51) ml, and intraoperative blood transfusion was (1 500.00 ± 336.65) ml. Operative time for total en bloc spondylectomy was(4.17 ± 0.67) h, intraoperative bleeding was (1 341.67 ± 361.13) ml, and intraoperative blood transfusion was (916.67 ± 321.66) ml. There was significant differences in operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative blood transfusion between three groups (P < 0.05). In terms of these factors, total en bloc spondylectomy had the best outcome followed by piecemeal spondylectomy. All pains had released, VAS score decreased obviously at 1 week after operation (P < 0.05), and there was no significant differences between three groups (P > 0.05). Surgical effects were well with these methods according to the evaluation of AP and lateral X-rays . At final follow-up, group A had 4 recurrences (2 with breast cancer, 1 with prostate cancer,and 1 with thyroid cancer) and 3 deaths (2 with lung cancer and 1 with thyroid cancer); group B had 2 recurrences (1 with breast cancer and 1 with prostate cancer) and 3 deaths (1 with lung cancer, 1 with breast cancer and 1 with kidney cancer);group C had no recurrences and 2 deaths for lung cancer.

The objective is classification of benign and malignant regions on transverse relaxation time weighted (T2W), dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images. Compared with conventional wavelet filters, shearlet has inherent directional sensitivity, which makes it suitable for characterizing small contours of cancer cells. By applying a multi-scale decomposition, the shearlet transform captures visual information provided by edges detected at different orientations and multiple scales in each region of interest (ROI) of the images.

The variability in medical image contouring is a source of uncertainty in radiation treatment planning. Consensus contour of a given case, which was proposed to reduce the variability, is generated by combining the manually generated contours of several clinicians. However, having access to several clinicians (e.g., radiation oncologists) to generate a consensus contour for one patient is costly. This paper presents an algorithm that automatically generates a consensus contour for a given case using the atlases of different clinicians.

Based on the fundamental role played by angiogenesis in cancer growth and development, several dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging methods have been developed to probe tumor angiogenic vasculature. In DCE magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pharmacokinetic modeling allows estimating quantitative parameters related to the physiology underlying tumor angiogenesis. In particular, novel magnetic resonance dispersion imaging (MRDI) enables quantitative assessment of the microvascular architecture and leakage, by describing the intravascular dispersion kinetics of an extravascular contrast agent with a dispersion model. According to this model, the tissue contrast concentration at each voxel is given by the convolution between the intravascular concentration, described as a Brownian motion process according to the convective-dispersion equation, with the interstitium impulse response, represented by a mono-exponential decay, and describing the contrast leakage in the extravascular space. In this work, an improved formulation of the MRDI method is obtained by providing an analytical solution for the convolution integral present in the dispersion model. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by means of dedicated simulations in terms of estimation accuracy, precision, and computation time. Moreover, a preliminary clinical validation was carried out in five patients with proven PCa. The proposed method allows for a reduction by about 40% of computation time without any significant change in estimation accuracy and precision, and in the clinical performance.""","""['S Turco', 'A J E M Janssen', 'C Lavini', 'J J de la Rosette', 'H Wijkstra', 'M Mischi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Magnetic resonance dispersion imaging for localization of angiogenesis and cancer growth.', 'Prostate cancer localization by novel magnetic resonance dispersion imaging.', 'Evaluation of Dispersion MRI for Improved Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in a Multicenter Study.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of the prostate.', 'Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI in prostate cancer.']"""

Hence, fluorescence spectroscopy could be used to quantify these fluctuations to identify prostate cancer. An optical biopsy needle with a light sensitive optical probe at the tip of the inner needle was developed to take prostate biopsies after measuring tissue fluorescence with a laboratory fluorometer. The optical probe consists of eight 100 μm fibers for tissue excitation and a single 200 μm fiber to capture fluorescence spectra. Random biopsy cores were taken from 20 surgically excised prostates after measuring fluorescence spectra of tissue between 295-550nm for several excitations between 280-350nm. Each biopsy core was histopathologically classified and correlated with corresponding spectra. Prostate biopsies were grouped into benign or malignant based on the histological findings. Out of 187 biopsy cores, 109 were benign and 78 were malignant. Partial least square analysis of tissue spectra was performed to identify diagnostically significant principal components as potential classifiers.

Results:   Polygenic risk quartiles 1 to 4 comprised 9, 18, 25, and 48% of the cases, respectively. For a prostate-specific antigen test sensitivity of 80% and MST of 9 years, 43, 30, 25, and 19% of the prevalent screen-detected cancers in quartiles 1 to 4, respectively, were likely to be overdiagnosed cancers.

Here we present evidence that BTG3 binds and suppresses AKT, a kinase frequently deregulated in cancers. BTG3 ablation results in increased AKT activity that phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Consequently, we also observed elevated β-catenin/T-cell factor activity, upregulation of mesenchymal markers, and enhanced cell migration. Consistent with these findings, BTG3 overexpression suppressed tumor growth in mouse xenografts, and was associated with diminished AKT phosphorylation and reduced β-catenin in tissue specimens. Significantly, a short BTG3-derived peptide was identified, which recapitulates these effects in vitro and in cells.

We report the operative details and surgical techniques of a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) experiences for organ confined prostate cancer.  Methods:   Between the years of 2009 and 2012, 68 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent fascia-sparing intrafascial nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and anatomic vesicourethral anastomosis. None of the patients were incontinent. 48 of them had an IIEF-5 potency score equal or greater than 22, without receiving phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Our techniques included preservation of the bladder neck, preservation of the endopelvic fascia and puboprostatic ligaments, a nerve-sparing intrafascial approach, selective suturing of the dorsal venous complex, and anterior and posterior reconstruction. We evaluated the patients at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 12th postoperative months to determine if these techniques are correlated with early recovery of urinary continence and potency.  Results:   The mean operation time was 258.2±78.5 minutes, and the mean estimated blood loss was 111.2±22.9 cc during the operation. A nerve-sparing procedure was performed bilaterally in 62 (91.2 %) cases and unilaterally in 6 (8.8%) cases. The mean drain extraction time was 2.3±0.9 days, and the mean hospital stay was 3.4±1.1 days. The catheter was removed on postoperative day 9.9±0.9. The surgical margin was positive in 10 (14.7%) patients. The continence rates at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 74.2%, 76.9%, 80.6%, and 95.6%, respectively. During the same period, among the patients without ED, the potency rates were 29.4%, 38.2%, 54.1%, and 75%, respectively All operations were completed successfully, and there were no major complications.

New therapeutic targets are emerging; in particular, dsRNA receptors Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and cytosolic helicases expressed by cancer cells, once activated, exert a pro-apoptotic effect in different tumors. We previously demonstrated that the synthetic analog of dsRNA poly(I:C) induces apoptosis in the androgen-dependent PCa cell line LNCaP in a TLR3-dependent fashion, whereas only a weak apoptotic effect is observed in the more aggressive and androgen-independent PCa cells PC3 and DU145. In this paper, we characterize the receptors and the signaling pathways involved in the remarkable apoptosis induced by poly(I:C) transfected by Lipofectamine (in-poly(I:C)) compared with the 12-fold higher free poly(I:C) concentration in PC3 and DU145 cells. By using genetic inhibition of different poly(I:C) receptors, we demonstrate the crucial role of TLR3 and Src in in-poly(I:C)-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we show that the increased in-poly(I:C) apoptotic efficacy is due to a higher binding of endosomal TLR3. On the other hand, we show that in-poly(I:C) binding to cytosolic receptors MDA5 and RIG-I triggers IRF3-mediated signaling, leading uniquely to the up-regulation of IFN-β, which likely in turn induces increased TLR3, MDA5, and RIG-I proteins. In summary, in-poly(I:C) activates two distinct antitumor pathways in PC3 and DU145 cells: one mediated by the TLR3/Src/STAT1 axis, leading to apoptosis, and the other one mediated by MDA5/RIG-I/IRF3, leading to immunoadjuvant IFN-β expression.""","""['Sara Palchetti', 'Donatella Starace', 'Paola De Cesaris', 'Antonio Filippini', 'Elio Ziparo', 'Anna Riccioli']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Synergy between RA and TLR3 promotes type I IFN-dependent apoptosis through upregulation of TRAIL pathway in breast cancer cells.', 'MDA5 complements TLR3 in suppression of neuroblastoma.', 'Double-stranded RNA induces an antiviral defense status in epidermal keratinocytes through TLR3-, PKR-, and MDA5/RIG-I-mediated differential signaling.', 'Anticancer function of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid.', 'dsRNA-activation of TLR3 and RLR signaling: gene induction-dependent and independent effects.', 'Evidence of Copper Nanoparticles and Poly I:C Modulating Cas9 Interaction and Cleavage of COR (Conserved Omicron RNA).', 'Differential Gene Expression Induced by Different TLR Agonists in A549 Lung Epithelial Cells Is Modulated by CRISPR Activation of TLR10.', 'ER stress promotes mitochondrial DNA mediated type-1 interferon response in beta-cells and interleukin-8 driven neutrophil chemotaxis.', 'PKR and TLR3 trigger distinct signals that coordinate the induction of antiviral apoptosis.', 'Intratumoural immunotherapy: activation of nucleic acid sensing pattern recognition receptors.']"""

In this study, we have investigated whether transfer of integrins through exosomes between prostate cancer (PrCa) cells occurs and whether transferred integrins promote cell adhesion and migration. Among others, we have focused on the αvβ6 integrin, which is not detectable in normal human prostate but is highly expressed in human primary PrCa as well as murine PrCa in Pten(pc-/-) mice. After confirming the fidelity of the exosome preparations by electron microscopy, density gradient, and immunoblotting, we determined that the αvβ6 integrin is actively packaged into exosomes isolated from PC3 and RWPE PrCa cell lines. We also demonstrate that αvβ6 is efficiently transferred via exosomes from a donor cell to an αvβ6-negative recipient cell and localizes to the cell surface. De novo αvβ6 expression in an αvβ6-negative recipient cell is not a result of a change in mRNA levels but is a consequence of exosome-mediated transfer of this integrin between different PrCa cells. Recipient cells incubated with exosomes containing αvβ6 migrate on an αvβ6 specific substrate, latency-associated peptide-TGFβ, to a greater extent than cells treated with exosomes in which αvβ6 is stably or transiently down-regulated by shRNA or siRNA, respectively. Overall, this study shows that exosomes from PrCa cells may contribute to a horizontal propagation of integrin-associated phenotypes, which would promote cell migration, and consequently, metastasis in a paracrine fashion.""","""['Carmine Fedele', 'Amrita Singh', 'Brad J Zerlanko', 'Renato V Iozzo', 'Lucia R Languino']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Exosomal αvβ6 integrin is required for monocyte M2 polarization in prostate cancer.', 'Small extracellular vesicle-mediated ITGB6 siRNA delivery downregulates the αVβ6 integrin and inhibits adhesion and migration of recipient prostate cancer cells.', 'Integrin αvβ6 promotes an osteolytic program in cancer cells by upregulating MMP2.', 'Defining the role of integrin alphavbeta6 in cancer.', 'The roles of integrin αvβ6 in cancer.', 'The therapeutic potential of exosomes in lung cancer.', 'cRGD-Functionalized Silk Fibroin Nanoparticles: A Strategy for Cancer Treatment with a Potent Unselective Naphthalene Diimide Derivative.', 'NetrinG1+ cancer-associated fibroblasts generate unique extracellular vesicles that support the survival of pancreatic cancer cells under nutritional stress.', 'TNTdetect.AI: A Deep Learning Model for Automated Detection and Counting of Tunneling Nanotubes in Microscopy Images.', 'Extracellular Vesicles Secreted by Mouse Decidual Cells Carry Critical Information for the Establishment of Pregnancy.']"""

Unfortunately, all men develop resistance to primary castrating therapy and secondary androgen deprivation therapies (ADTs). Resistance develops in part because castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells adaptively up-regulate AR levels through overexpression, amplification, and expression of ligand-independent variants in response to chronic exposure to a low-testosterone environment. However, preclinical models suggest that AR overexpression represents a therapeutic liability that can be exploited via exposure to supraphysiologic testosterone to promote CRPC cell death. Preclinical data supported a pilot study in which 16 asymptomatic CRPC patients with low to moderate metastatic burden were treated with testosterone cypionate (400 mg intramuscular; day 1 of 28) and etoposide (100 mg oral daily; days 1 to 14 of 28). After three cycles, those with a declining prostate-specific antigen (PSA) continued on intermittent testosterone therapy monotherapy. Castrating therapy was continued to suppress endogenous testosterone production, allowing for rapid cycling from supraphysiologic to near-castrate serum testosterone levels, a strategy termed bipolar androgen therapy (BAT). BAT was well tolerated and resulted in high rates of PSA (7 of 14 evaluable patients) and radiographic responses (5 of 10 evaluable patients). Although all men showed eventual PSA progression, four men remained on BAT for ≥1 year. All patients (10 of 10) demonstrated PSA reductions upon receiving androgen-ablative therapies after BAT, suggesting that BAT may also restore sensitivity to ADTs.

In this study, we isolated and characterized stem-like cells present in the immortalized human prostate cell line, RWPE-1. We used a reporter system with green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the promoter of s-SHIP (for stem-SH2-domain-containing 5'-inositol phosphatase) whose stem cell-specific expression has been previously shown. We observed that s-SHIP-GFP-expressing RWPE-1 cells showed stem cell characteristics such as increased expression of stem cell surface markers (CD44, CD166, TROP2) and pluripotency transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2), and enhanced sphere-forming capacity and resistance to arsenite-induced cell death. Concomitant increased expression of the long noncoding RNA H19 was observed, which prompted us to investigate a putative role in stemness for this oncofetal gene. Targeted suppression of H19 with siRNA decreased Oct4 and Sox2 gene expression and colony-forming potential in RWPE-1 cells. Conversely, overexpression of H19 significantly increased gene expression of these two transcription factors and the sphere-forming capacity of RWPE-1 cells. Analysis of H19 expression in various prostate and mammary human cell lines revealed similarities with Sox2 expression, suggesting that a functional relationship may exist between H19 and Sox2. Collectively, we provide the first evidence that s-SHIP-GFP promoter reporter offers a unique marker for the enrichment of human stem-like cell populations and highlight a role in stemness for the long noncoding RNA H19.""","""['Hélène Bauderlique-Le Roy', 'Constance Vennin', 'Guillaume Brocqueville', 'Nathalie Spruyt', 'Eric Adriaenssens', 'Roland P Bourette']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Stem Cells Dev""","""['PIM protein kinases regulate the level of the long noncoding RNA H19 to control stem cell gene transcription and modulate tumor growth.', 'Increased level of H19 long noncoding RNA promotes invasion, angiogenesis, and stemness of glioblastoma cells.', 'Oncofetal H19 RNA promotes tumor metastasis.', 'Long noncoding RNA in prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNAs in normal and pathological pluripotency.', 'Prognostic analysis of m6A-related lncRNAs as potential biomarkers in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinom.', 'Signaling Pathways and Targeted Therapies for Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'Long Non-Coding RNAs at the Chromosomal Risk Loci Identified by Prostate and Breast Cancer GWAS.', 'Reporter gene systems for the identification and characterization of cancer stem cells.', 'Propagation and Maintenance of Cancer Stem Cells: A Major Influence of the Long Non-Coding RNA H19.']"""

Then, the clinical relevance between OLR1 (the ox-LDL receptor) expression and PCa was analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. We also investigated the function of ox-LDL in PCa cell lines in vitro. Phosphorylation protein chips were used to analyze cell signaling pathways in ox-LDL-treated PC-3 cells. The ox-LDL level was found to be significantly correlated with N stage of prostate cancer. OLR1 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis in the TCGA cohort. In vitro, ox-LDL stimulated the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LNCaP and PC-3 in a dose-dependent manner. The results of phosphoprotein microarray illustrated that ox-LDL could influence multiple signaling pathways of PC-3. Activation of proliferation promoting signaling pathways (including β-catenin, cMyc, NF-κB, STAT1, STAT3) as well as apoptosis-associating signaling pathways (including p27, caspase-3) demonstrated that ox-LDL had complicated effects on prostate cancer.

Malignant enlargements must be differentiated from benign enlargements for adequate treatment of each patient. High serum total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) levels suggest malignancy, but some of the biopsies done due to a serum tPSA value >4 ng/mL would be negative for malignancy because of the low specificity of tPSA for prostate cancer. This study aims to compare the histologic findings of all prostate specimens obtained from core needle biopsy, open simple prostatectomy, and transurethral resection of the prostate with the respective serum tPSA values in an attempt to decipher the role of serum tPSA in the management of these patients.

Though it has been well-documented over past two decades that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood can be used as a biomarker for metastatic cancer, there are enormous challenges in capturing and identifying CTCs with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Because of the heterogeneous expression of CTC markers, it is now well understood that a single CTC marker is insufficient to capture all CTCs from the blood. Driven by the clear need, this study reports for the first time highly efficient capture and accurate identification of multiple types of CTCs from infected blood using aptamer-modified porous graphene oxide membranes. The results demonstrate that dye-modified S6, A9, and YJ-1 aptamers attached to 20-40 μm porous garphene oxide membranes are capable of capturing multiple types of tumor cells (SKBR3 breast cancer cells, LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and SW-948 colon cancer cells) selectively and simultaneously from infected blood. Our result shows that the capture efficiency of graphene oxide membranes is ~95% for multiple types of tumor cells; for each tumor concentration, 10 cells are present per milliliter of blood sample. The selectivity of our assay for capturing targeted tumor cells has been demonstrated using membranes without an antibody. Blood infected with different cells also has been used to demonstrate the targeted tumor cell capturing ability of aptamer-conjugated membranes. Our data also demonstrate that accurate analysis of multiple types of captured CTCs can be performed using multicolor fluorescence imaging. Aptamer-conjugated membranes reported here have good potential for the early diagnosis of diseases that are currently being detected by means of cell capture technologies.""","""['Bhanu Priya Viraka Nellore', 'Rajashekhar Kanchanapally', 'Avijit Pramanik', 'Sudarson Sekhar Sinha', 'Suhash Reddy Chavva', 'Ashton Hamme nd', 'Paresh Chandra Ray']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['A platform for primary tumor origin identification of circulating tumor cells via antibody cocktail-based in\xa0vivo capture and specific aptamer-based multicolor fluorescence imaging strategy.', 'A rapid and simple method for efficient capture and accurate discrimination of circulating tumor cells using aptamer conjugated magnetic beads and surface-enhanced Raman scattering imaging.', 'Polyester fabric sheet layers functionalized with graphene oxide for sensitive isolation of circulating tumor cells.', 'Multifunctional hybrid graphene oxide for circulating tumor cell isolation and analysis.', 'Aptamer-Based Methods for Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells and Their Potential for Personalized Diagnostics.', 'Double spiral chip-embedded micro-trapezoid filters (SMT filters) for the sensitive isolation of CTCs of prostate cancer by spectral detection.', 'Identification and Engineering of Aptamers for Theranostic Application in Human Health and Disorders.', 'Recent Development of Nanomaterials-Based Cytosensors for the Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Capture and selective release of multiple types of circulating tumor cells using smart DNAzyme probes.', 'Immunomagnetic separation of circulating tumor cells with microfluidic chips and their clinical applications.']"""

In a two-country study, we investigated the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of prostate cancer survivors up to 18 years post-diagnosis.  Methods:   Postal questionnaires were administered in 2012 to 6559 prostate cancer (ICD10 C61) survivors 2-18 years post-diagnosis, identified through population-based cancer registries in Ireland. HRQoL was measured using QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25. HRQoL, functional and symptom scores were compared by primary treatment(s) using multiple linear regression.  Results:   Fifty-four percent responded (n = 3348). After controlling for socio-demographic and clinical factors, global HRQoL varied significantly by primary treatment (p < 0.001); compared to radical prostatectomy (RP), survivors who received androgen deprivation therapy alone (ADT; p < 0.001) or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) without concurrent ADT (p = 0.001) had significantly lower global HRQoL. The global HRQoL of men who received brachytherapy (p = 0.157), EBRT with concurrent ADT (p = 0.940) or active surveillance/watchful waiting (p = 0.388) was not significantly different from men treated with RP. There were statistically and clinically significant differences in general (fatigue, pain, dyspnoea, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, financial difficulties) and disease-specific symptoms (sexual, urinary, bowel, ADT) by primary treatment. Fatigue and insomnia scores were high for survivors in all treatment groups.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer survivors' long-term HRQoL varied with primary treatment.

Most participants used ICTs on a daily basis for various purposes including health information seeking. Most participants were open to a novel, computer-based intervention if the system was easy to use and its animated avatars were culturally appropriate. Because study participants had low exposure to IDM for PrCA, but frequently used ICTs, IDM interventions using ICTs (e.g., computers) hold promise for AA men and should be explored for feasibility and effectiveness.

Results:   KUD773 induced the anti-proliferative effect and subsequent apoptosis in PC-3 and DU-145 (two HRPC cell lines); whereas, it showed less active in normal prostate cells. Further examination showed that KUD773 inhibited tubulin polymerization and induced an increase of mitotic phosphoproteins and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) phosphorylation, indicating a mitotic arrest of the cell cycle through an anti-tubulin action. The kinase assay demonstrated that KUD773 inhibited Aurora A activity. KUD773 induced an increase of Cdk1 phosphorylation at Thr(161) (a stimulatory phosphorylation site) and a decrease of phosphorylation at Tyr(15) (an inhibitory phosphorylation site), suggesting the activation of Cdk1.

This project aimed to validate the deliverability of online adapted plans and develop a proof-of-concept online delivery monitoring system for online adaptive radiation therapy QA.  Methods:   The first part of this project benchmarked automatically online adapted prostate treatment plans using traditional portal dosimetry IMRT QA. The portal dosimetry QA results of online adapted plans were compared to original (unadapted) plans as well as randomly selected prostate IMRT plans from our clinic. In the second part, an online delivery monitoring system was designed and validated via a simulated treatment with intentional multileaf collimator (MLC) errors. This system was based on inputs from the dynamic machine information (DMI), which continuously reports actual MLC positions and machine monitor units (MUs) at intervals of 50 ms or less during delivery. Based on the DMI, the system performed two levels of monitoring/verification during the delivery: (1) dynamic monitoring of cumulative fluence errors resulting from leaf position deviations and visualization using fluence error maps (FEMs); and (2) verification of MLC positions against the treatment plan for potential errors in MLC motion and data transfer at each control point. Validation of the online delivery monitoring system was performed by introducing intentional systematic MLC errors (ranging from 0.5 to 2 mm) to the DMI files for both leaf banks. These DMI files were analyzed by the proposed system to evaluate the system's performance in quantifying errors and revealing the source of errors, as well as to understand patterns in the FEMs. In addition, FEMs from 210 actual prostate IMRT beams were analyzed using the proposed system to further validate its ability to catch and identify errors, as well as establish error magnitude baselines for prostate IMRT delivery.  Results:   Online adapted plans were found to have similar delivery accuracy in comparison to clinical IMRT plans when validated with portal dosimetry IMRT QA. FEMs for the simulated deliveries with intentional MLC errors exhibited distinct patterns for different MLC error magnitudes and directions, indicating that the proposed delivery monitoring system is highly specific in detecting the source of errors. Implementing the proposed QA system for online adapted plans revealed excellent delivery accuracy: over 99% of leaf position differences were within 0.5 mm, and >99% of pixels in the FEMs had fluence errors within 0.5 MU. Patterns present in the FEMs and MLC control point analysis for actual patient cases agreed with the error pattern analysis results, further validating the system's ability to reveal and differentiate MLC deviations. Calculation of the fluence map based on the DMI was performed within 2 ms after receiving each DMI input.  Conclusions:   The proposed online delivery monitoring system requires minimal additional resources and time commitment to the current clinical workflow while still maintaining high sensitivity to leaf position errors and specificity to error types. The presented online delivery monitoring system therefore represents a promising QA system candidate for online adaptive radiation therapy.""","""['Taoran Li', 'Qiuwen Wu', 'Yun Yang', 'Anna Rodrigues', 'Fang-Fang Yin', 'Q Jackie Wu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Implementation of phantom-less IMRT delivery verification using Varian DynaLog files and R/V output.', 'MO-D-BRB-09: Treatment Delivery QA for Online Adaptive Radiation Therapy Based on Dynamic Machine Information (DMI): A Feasibility Study.', 'Evaluation of MLC leaf positioning accuracy for static and dynamic IMRT treatments using DAVID in vivo dosimetric system.', 'Utilising the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training System to Support Undergraduate Teaching of IMRT, VMAT, DCAT Treatment Planning, and QA Concepts.', 'Tolerance limits and methodologies for IMRT measurement-based verification QA: Recommendations of AAPM Task Group No. 218.', 'Working alliance in low-intensity internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for depression in primary care in Spain: A qualitative study.', 'Application programming in C# environment with recorded user software interactions and its application in autopilot of VMAT/IMRT treatment planning.']"""

KIM software was written to process kilovoltage (kV) images streamed from a standard C-arm linear accelerator with a gantry-mounted kV x-ray imaging system. A 120° pretreatment kV imaging arc was acquired to build the patient-specific 2D to 3D motion correlation. The kV imager was activated during the megavoltage (MV) treatment, a dual arc VMAT prostate treatment, to estimate the 3D prostate position in real-time. All necessary ethics, legal, and regulatory requirements were met for this clinical study. The quality assurance processes were completed and peer reviewed.  Results:   During treatment, a prostate position offset of nearly 3 mm in the posterior direction was observed with KIM. This position offset did not trigger a gating event. After the treatment, the prostate motion was independently measured using kV/MV triangulation, resulting in a mean difference of less than 0.6 mm and standard deviation of less than 0.6 mm in each direction. The accuracy of the marker segmentation was visually assessed during and after treatment and found to be performing well. During treatment, there were no interruptions due to performance of the KIM software.  Conclusions:   For the first time, KIM has been used for real-time image guidance during cancer radiotherapy. The measured accuracy and precision were both submillimeter for the first treatment fraction. This clinical translational research milestone paves the way for the broad implementation of real-time image guidance to facilitate the detection and correction of geometric and dosimetric errors, and resultant improved clinical outcomes, in cancer radiotherapy.""","""['Paul J Keall', 'Jin Aun Ng', ""Ricky O'Brien"", 'Emma Colvill', 'Chen-Yu Huang', 'Per Rugaard Poulsen', 'Walther Fledelius', 'Prabhjot Juneja', 'Emma Simpson', 'Linda Bell', 'Florencia Alfieri', 'Thomas Eade', 'Andrew Kneebone', 'Jeremy T Booth']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Real-Time 3D Image Guidance Using a Standard LINAC: Measured Motion, Accuracy, and Precision of the First Prospective Clinical Trial of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring-Guided Gating for Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Quality assurance for the clinical implementation of kilovoltage intrafraction monitoring for prostate cancer VMAT.', 'The first clinical implementation of a real-time six degree of freedom target tracking system during radiation therapy based on Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring (KIM).', 'Dynamic targeting image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Review of Real-Time 3-Dimensional Image Guided Radiation Therapy on Standard-Equipped Cancer Radiation Therapy Systems: Are We at the Tipping Point for the Era of Real-Time Radiation Therapy?', 'Dynamic intrafractional position monitoring with implanted fiducial markers for enhanced accuracy in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'X-ray source arrays for volumetric imaging during radiotherapy treatment.', 'Implementation of triggered kilovoltage imaging for stereotactic radiotherapy of the spine for patients with spinal fixation hardware.', 'Evaluation of internal margins for prostate for step and shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy using different margin formulas.', 'Automatic Detection and Tracking of Marker Seeds Implanted in Prostate Cancer Patients using a Deep Learning Algorithm.']"""

Although much quicker than graphical optimization, an experienced treatment planner is required for both methods. With automated inverse algorithms, the procedure to achieve the desired dose distribution is often based on trial-and-error.  Methods:   A new approach for stepping source prostate brachytherapy treatment planning was developed as a quick and user-friendly alternative. This approach consists of the combined use of two novel tools: Enhanced geometrical optimization (EGO) and interactive inverse planning (IIP). EGO is an extended version of the common geometrical optimization method and is applied to create a dose distribution as homogeneous as possible. With the second tool, IIP, this dose distribution is tailored to a specific patient anatomy by interactively changing the highest and lowest dose on the contours.  Results:   The combined use of EGO-IIP was evaluated on 24 prostate cancer patients, by having an inexperienced user create treatment plans, compliant to clinical dose objectives. This user was able to create dose plans of 24 patients in an average time of 4.4 min/patient. An experienced treatment planner without extensive training in EGO-IIP also created 24 plans. The resulting dose-volume histogram parameters were comparable to the clinical plans and showed high conformance to clinical standards.  Conclusions:   Even for an inexperienced user, treatment planning with EGO-IIP for stepping source prostate brachytherapy is feasible as an alternative to current optimization algorithms, offering speed, simplicity for the user, and local control of the dose levels.""","""['Anna M Dinkla', 'Rob van der Laarse', 'Kees Koedooder', 'H Petra Kok', 'Niek van Wieringen', 'Bradley R Pieters', 'Arjan Bel']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A comparison of inverse optimization algorithms for HDR/PDR prostate brachytherapy treatment planning.', 'A comparison of anatomy-based inverse planning with simulated annealing and graphical optimization for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Knowledge-based inverse treatment planning for low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Optimization in treatment planning of high dose-rate brachytherapy - Review and analysis of mathematical models.', 'Treatment planning for multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy of breast cancer - from Paris system to anatomy-based inverse planning.']"""

This study aimed to validate a method for evaluation of delivered intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) dose based on multimodal deformable image registration (dir) for prostate treatments.  Methods:   A pelvic phantom was scanned with CT and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Both images were digitally deformed using two realistic patient-based deformation fields. The original CT was then registered to the deformed CBCT resulting in a secondary deformed CT. The registration quality was assessed as the ability of the dir method to recover the artificially induced deformations. The primary and secondary deformed CT images as well as vector fields were compared to evaluate the efficacy of the registration method and it's suitability to be used for dose calculation. plastimatch, a free and open source software was used for deformable image registration. A B-spline algorithm with optimized parameters was used to achieve the best registration quality. Geometric image evaluation was performed through voxel-based Hounsfield unit (HU) and vector field comparison. For dosimetric evaluation, IMRT treatment plans were created and optimized on the original CT image and recomputed on the two warped images to be compared. The dose volume histograms were compared for the warped structures that were identical in both warped images. This procedure was repeated for the phantom with full, half full, and empty bladder.  Results:   The results indicated mean HU differences of up to 120 between registered and ground-truth deformed CT images. However, when the CBCT intensities were calibrated using a region of interest (ROI)-based calibration curve, these differences were reduced by up to 60%. Similarly, the mean differences in average vector field lengths decreased from 10.1 to 2.5 mm when CBCT was calibrated prior to registration. The results showed no dependence on the level of bladder filling. In comparison with the dose calculated on the primary deformed CT, differences in mean dose averaged over all organs were 0.2% and 3.9% for dose calculated on the secondary deformed CT with and without CBCT calibration, respectively, and 0.5% for dose calculated directly on the calibrated CBCT, for the full-bladder scenario. Gamma analysis for the distance to agreement of 2 mm and 2% of prescribed dose indicated a pass rate of 100% for both cases involving calibrated CBCT and on average 86% without CBCT calibration.  Conclusions:   Using deformable registration on the planning CT images to evaluate the IMRT dose based on daily CBCTs was found feasible. The proposed method will provide an accurate dose distribution using planning CT and pretreatment CBCT data, avoiding the additional uncertainties introduced by CBCT inhomogeneity and artifacts. This is a necessary initial step toward future image-guided adaptive radiotherapy of the prostate.""","""['M Moteabbed', 'G C Sharp', 'Y Wang', 'A Trofimov', 'J A Efstathiou', 'H-M Lu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Toward adaptive radiotherapy for head and neck patients: Feasibility study on using CT-to-CBCT deformable registration for ""dose of the day"" calculations.', 'Investigating deformable image registration and scatter correction for CBCT-based dose calculation in adaptive IMPT.', 'Evaluation of on-board kV cone beam computed tomography-based dose calculation with deformable image registration using Hounsfield unit modifications.', 'A review of dose calculation approaches with cone beam CT in photon and proton therapy.', '""Patient-specific validation of deformable image registration in radiation therapy: Overview and caveats"".', 'Adaptive proton therapy.', 'Effect of computed tomography value error on dose calculation in adaptive radiotherapy with Elekta X-ray volume imaging cone beam computed tomography.', 'Analysis of the Influence of Peripheral Anatomical Changes for CBCT-Guided Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Trajectory log analysis and cone-beam CT-based daily dose calculation to investigate the dosimetric accuracy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy for gynecologic cancer.', 'Quantification of accumulated dose and associated anatomical changes of esophagus using weekly Magnetic Resonance Imaging acquired during radiotherapy of locally advanced lung cancer.']"""

MRI can also provide functional information such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) which depicts the molecular diffusion processes in biological tissues. The combination of anatomical and functional imaging techniques is widely used in oncology, e.g., for prostate cancer diagnosis and staging. However, acquisition-specific distortions as well as physiological motion lead to misalignments between T2 and DWI and consequently to a reduced diagnostic value. Image registration algorithms are commonly employed to correct for such misalignment.  Methods:   The authors compare the performance of five state-of-the-art nonrigid image registration techniques for accurate image fusion of DWI with T2.

However, little is known about the molecular basis of this association. We have previously demonstrated that NE cells promote metastasis of a human prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) with overexpression of the gelsolin gene. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interactions between NE cells and LNCaP cells and the involvement of gelsolin in contributing to the invasive potential of LNCaP cells. In addition, we examined whether neurotensin induced gelsolin-mediated invasion. We used the NE cell line NE-CS that was established from the prostate of the LPB-Tag 12T-10 transgenic mouse. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting gelsolin or not targeting it was transfected into LNCaP cells. Cell invasion was assessed by Matrigel invasion assay. The supernatant of NE-CS cells and neurotensin induced the transformation of LNCaP cells. Neurotensin was observed in the supernatant of NE-CS cells but not in LNCaP cells. The siRNA targeting of gelsolin resulted in inhibition of invasion of LNCaP cells in the culture medium with neurotensin added, and in the supernatant of NE-CS cells with epidermal growth factor. The invasive potential of LNCaP cells enhanced by neurotensin or the supernatant of NE-CS cells through neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) was blocked by a phospholipase Cγ inhibitor and an intracellular calcium chelator, with concomitant gelsolin suppression.

The expression level of FSHR correlates strongly with the response of tumors to antiangiogenic therapies. In this study, an immunoPET tracer was developed for imaging of FSHR in different cancer types. A monoclonal antibody (FSHR-mAb) against FSHR was conjugated with S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA) and used for subsequent (64)Cu-labeling. NOTA-FSHR-mAb preserved FSHR specificity/affinity, confirmed by flow cytometry measurements. (64)Cu-labeling was successfully conducted with decent yields (∼25%) and high specific activity (0.93 GBq/mg).

Mixed methods were used to examine responses to an open-ended question about current unmet needs from a survey of 2-, 5-, and 10-year cancer survivors.  Methods:   Qualitative techniques were used to code themes of unmet needs from open-ended responses.

Results:   There were 1514 responses to the open-ended question on unmet needs. Respondents ranged in age from 24 to 97 years and included proportionately more women, and 18% were minorities (black and Hispanic). Sixteen themes of unmet needs were identified. The number and type of unmet needs were not associated with the time since cancer treatment. Breast cancer survivors identified more unmet needs than other survivors. Male survivors and especially prostate cancer survivors identified personal control problems as current needs. Older cancer survivors identified fewer unmet needs on average than younger survivors.

At 6 months, 5 of 13 (38%) pts had PSADT ≥ 200% of the baseline PSADT and were continued on study for an additional 24 weeks of treatment. Two patients had durable PSA response for more than 1 year. Digoxin was well tolerated with possible relation of one grade 3 back pain. No patients had evidence of digoxin toxicity. The digoxin dose was lowered in 2 patients for significant ECGs changes (sinus bradycardia and QT prolongation), and there were probable digoxin-related ECG changes in 3 patients. Plasma VEGF was detected in 4 (25%) patients.  Conclusions:   Digoxin was well tolerated and showed a prolongation of PSDAT in 38% of the patients. However, there was no significant difference comparing that of similar patients on placebo from historical data.

Materials and methods:   MR images obtained of 83 patients with prostate cancer using 1.5-T MRI systems with an endorectal coil were compared to images collected from 83 patients with a 3.0-T MRI system. Prostate diameters were measured, and image quality was evaluated by one American Board of Radiology (ABR)-certified radiologist (reader 1) and one ABR-certified diagnostic medical physicist (reader 2). The likelihood of the presence of peripheral zone cancer in each sextant and local extent was rated and compared to histopathologic findings.  Results:   Prostate anterior-posterior diameter measured by both readers was significantly shorter with 1.5-T endorectal MRI than with 3.0-T MRI. The overall image quality score difference was significant only for reader 1. Both readers found that the two MRI systems provided a similar diagnostic accuracy in cancer localization, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle involvement.  Conclusions:   Nonendorectal coil 3.0-T MRI provides prostate images that are natural in shape and that have comparable image quality to those obtained at 1.5 T with an endorectal coil, but not superior diagnostic performance.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study analyzed 469 patients who were treated between 2003 and 2010 with dose escalated radiation therapy to a minimum dose of 7560 cGy for prostate cancer at the New York Harbor Department of Veterans Affairs. Biochemical failure-free survival (bFFS) and distant metastatic-free survival (DMFS) were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox Regression were used to measure the impact of covariates on biochemical control.  Results:   The median follow-up was 61 months and 95.3% of patients were followed at least 2 years. The 5-year bFFS for National Cancer Care Network low, intermediate and high risk disease were 90.3%, 86.9% and 77.3% respectively (P=0.001). Patients with high risk disease were more likely to develop metastatic disease. The 5-year DMFS was 99.1% for low risk, 98.8% for intermediate risk and 94.5% for high-risk (P<0.001). There were 8 prostate cancer related deaths, of which 6 had high risk disease and 2 had intermediate risk disease. The 5-year prostate cancer specific survival was 98.4%. Toxicities were generally mild, however there were two genitourinary toxicity related deaths, though in both patients there were confounding medical issues that may have contributed to their deaths.

This study investigated the effects of complexing iron (Fe3+) to the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and LAQ824 (LAQ) prior to their encapsulation into PEGylated liposomes, and investigated whether this technique could improve drug solubility, in vitro release and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. METHODS. The reaction stoichiometry, binding constants and solubility were measured for Fe complexes of SAHA and LAQ. The complexes were passively encapsulated into PEGylated liposomes and characterized by size distribution, zeta-potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE), and in vitro drug release studies. PC-3 cells were used to verify the in vitro anticancer activity of the formulations. In vivo pharmacokinetic properties of liposomal LAQ-Fe (L-LAQ-Fe) was evaluated in rats. RESULTS. SAHA and LAQ form complexes with Fe at 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, with a binding constant on the order of 104 M-1. Fe complexation improved the aqueous solubility and the liposomal encapsulation efficiency of SAHA and LAQ (29-35% EE, final drug concentration > 1 mM). Liposomal encapsulated complexes (L-HDACi-Fe) exhibited sustained in vitro release properties compared to L-HDACi but cytotoxicity on PC-3 cells was comparable to free drugs. The PK of L-LAQ-Fe revealed 15-fold improvement in the plasma t1/2 (12.11 h)and 211-fold improvement in the AUC∞ (105.7 µg·h/ml) compared to free LAQ (0.79 h, 0.5 µg·h/ml). Similarly, the plasma t1/2 of Fe was determined to be 11.83 h in a separate experiment using radioactive Fe-59. The majority of Fe-59 activity was found in liver and spleen of rats and correlates with liposomal uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system. CONCLUSIONS.

Imaging plays a pivotal role in restaging by helping to distinguish between local relapse and metastatic disease (i.e., lymph-node and skeletal metastases). At present, the most promising tools for assessing PCa patients with biochemical recurrence are multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with radio-labeled choline derivatives. The main advantage of mpMRI is its high diagnostic accuracy in detecting local recurrence, while choline-PET/CT is able to identify lymph-node metastases when they are not suspicious on morphological imaging. The most recent advances in the field of fusion imaging have shown that multimodal co-registration, synchronized navigation, and combined interpretation are more valuable than the individual; separate assessment offered by different diagnostic techniques. The objective of the present essay was to describe the value of bimodal choline-PET/mpMRI fusion imaging and trimodal choline-PET/mpMRI/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in the assessment of PCa recurrence after RP and RT. Bimodal choline-PET/mpMRI fusion imaging allows morphological, functional, and metabolic information to be combined, thereby overcoming the limitations of each separate imaging modality.

In this study, we explored its anti-tumor effect and the molecular mechanism in human prostate cancer PC-3 cell lines. Firstly, cell viability was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit (CCK-8) assay. The PC-3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of peperotetraphin for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The results showed that peperotetraphin inhibited the growth of PC-3 cell in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Next, the cell cycle distributions were analyzed by flow cytometric analysis (FCM), and the data suggested that peperotetraphin could significantly induce cell cycle arrested at the G1-S phase transition. Then, the cell apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining analysis, the data confirmed apoptosis-inducing activity of peperotetraphin and the apoptosis rates increased from 3.9 to 32.3 % when treated with increasing concentrations of peperotetraphin from 0 to 50 µM.

The results showed that the expression levels of Bax and the activity of caspase-3 were upregulated, whereas the expression levels of Bcl-2 were downregulated compared with those of the control.

However, there is still incomplete understanding about the role of FOXO transcription factors in prostate cancer progression. In this investigation, we demonstrate that FOXO3a significantly inhibits the expression β-catenin in prostate cancer cells. The mechanism of inhibiting β-catenin expression involves the FOXO3a-mediated transactivated microRNA-34b/c, which consequently suppressed β-catenin mRNA expression by targeting the untranslated regions (UTRs) of β-catenin. Additionally, FOXO3a can directly bind to β-catenin, and competes with TCF for interaction with β-catenin, thereby inhibiting β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity and reducing the expression of β-catenin target genes. Furthermore, prostate cancer cells expressing FOXO3a shRNAs display mesenchymal characteristics, including enhanced cell migration and differential regulation of the EMT markers, whereas knockdown of β-catenin results in reversal of shFOXO3a-mediated EMT phenotypic changes. Collectively, these observations demonstrated that FOXO3a inhibits malignant phenotypes that are dependent on β-catenin-dependent modulation of EMT-related genes, and provided fresh insight into the mechanisms by which a FOXO3a-miR-34b/c axis restrains canonical β-catenin signaling cascades in prostate cancer cell.""","""['Hao Liu', 'Jiang Yin', 'Hongsheng Wang', 'Guanmin Jiang', 'Min Deng', 'Ge Zhang', 'Xianzhang Bu', 'Shaohui Cai', 'Jun Du', 'Zhimin He']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['SIRT3 inhibits prostate cancer metastasis through regulation of FOXO3A by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Foxo3a-mediated overexpression of microRNA-622 suppresses tumor metastasis by repressing hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in ERK-responsive lung cancer.', 'Interaction of FOXO with beta-catenin inhibits beta-catenin/T cell factor activity.', 'Interaction of nuclear receptors with the Wnt/beta-catenin/Tcf signaling axis: Wnt you like to know?', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Multi-omic profiling reveals an RNA processing rheostat that predisposes to prostate cancer.', 'Reprogramming of ovarian aging epigenome by resveratrol.', 'FoxO3 and oxidative stress: a multifaceted role in cellular adaptation.', 'ncRNA-mediated overexpression of ubiquitin-specific proteinase 13 contributes to the progression of prostate cancer via modulating AR signaling, DNA damage repair and immune infiltration.', 'The Role of miRNA-182 and FOXO3 Expression in Breast Cancer.']"""

MRGB was performed with a closed unit at 1.5 Tesla, an MRI compatible biopsy device, a needle guide, and a titanium double-shoot biopsy gun.  Result:   At prebiopsy MRI, in the 23 patients, a total of 26 suspicious areas to which the MRGB should be directed were found, 23 of them in the peripheral zone and three in the transitional zone. The needle guide was depicted and could be positioned with MRI guidance in all 23 patients. The duration of the procedure ranged from 35 to 55 min (mean 40 min). MRGB was well tolerated by all patients, and no major complications were observed. The detection rate for the diagnosis of PCa was 80, and 90 % of detected PCa were of intermediate aggressiveness.  Conclusion:   MRGB has the potential to improve cancer detection rates in men with suspected PCa to deliver the relevant treatment as soon as possible.""","""['Valeria Panebianco', 'Flavio Barchetti', 'Guglielmo Manenti', 'Tommaso Aversa', 'Carlo Catalano', 'Giovanni Simonetti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiol Med""","""['MRI-guided biopsy of the prostate increases diagnostic performance in men with elevated or increasing PSA levels after previous negative TRUS biopsies.', 'Prospective study of diagnostic accuracy comparing prostate cancer detection by transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy versus magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with subsequent MR-guided biopsy in men without previous prostate biopsies.', 'Impact of magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate biopsy in the supine position on the detection of significant prostate cancer in an inhomogeneous patient cohort.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate biopsy: institutional analysis and systematic review.', 'Kinematics modelling and dynamics analysis of an SMA-actuated active flexible needle for feedback-controlled manipulation in phantom.', 'Office-Based, Single-Sided, Low-Field MRI-Guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'MRI-directed biopsy for primary detection of prostate cancer in a population of 223 men: MRI In-Bore vs MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion-targeted techniques.', '""In-Bore"" MRI-Guided Prostate Biopsy for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Results from 140 Consecutive Patients.', 'Impact of the integration of proton magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy to PI-RADS 2 for prediction of high grade and high stage prostate cancer.']"""

The procedure was uneventful in 90% of mice. No difference in tumor vs. body temperature was observed. Changes at electrode-tumor junctions were immediate, with dryness and acidity (pH2-3) at the anode and oedema and alkalinity (pH10-12) at the cathode. This was accompanied by cellular alterations, found more pronounced at the cathode. Such acidic and alkaline conditions were cytotoxic in vitro and dissolved cells at pH>10. In mice, tumor destruction was extensive by 24h with almost undetectable blood prostate specific antigen (LNCaP model) and covered the whole tumor surface by 4 days. EChT was most efficient at 25-30 mA/cm(2) for 60 min, yielding the longest recurrence-free survival and higher cure rates, especially with 4 Pt-Ir electrodes.

Studies have shown that plasma CT-like proteasomal activity may be a powerful biomarker for risk stratification in hematologic malignancies. We hypothesized that circulating proteasomes could also be used to stratify risk for patients with PCa. A total of 109 patients with suspected PCa underwent prostatic biopsies were enrolled. Subjects were divided into non-cancer, low-risk PCa, and high-risk PCa groups. Three different proteasomal activity markers (CT-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like) were measured and compared among the three groups. The proteasomal target proteins, Ub-prs, Hsp70, Bax, and P27 in plasma and prostate tissues were also evaluated. Multivariate analysis was used to assess whether CT-like activity was a predictor of PCa progression. Only proteasomal CT-like activity in the high-risk group was statistically higher than in the non-cancer group (P < 0.05). The expression of Ub-prs, Hsp70, Bax, and P27 protein was decreased in both plasma and PCa tissue of high-risk patients. CT-like activity was found to be an independent predictor of high-risk PCa. Subjects with CT-like activity ≥55 had a 2.15-fold higher risk of having high-risk PCa as compared to those with a CT-like activity of <55 (P = 0.021).

Materials and methods:   With research ethics board approval, 254 patients underwent mp-MRI [diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE)] over a 1-year period at a single tertiary-care referral centre for prostate disease. All studies were reported by fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists. To determine to what extent parametric tests were used, radiology reports were searched for terms indicating usage of DWI/DCE and studies were reviewed to determine whether post-processing of DCE was performed. Midway through the study, an internal continuing medical education (CME) programme was instituted (consisting of lectures, electronic reading material, intra- and inter-departmental prostate rounds) and a standardized reporting template was introduced. Utilization of functional imaging was compared between radiologists by years of experience and by number of examinations interpreted, by study indication, and before and after CME.  Results:   Overall, both DWI and DCE were used in 50.7% of examinations. DWI (67.3%) was more frequently used than DCE (56.3%). DCE contrast curves were generated in 33.5% of studies, and quantitative analysis was performed in only one patient. Use of parametric tests was higher after CME (60.6% versus 40.4%), p = 0.009. There was no correlation between the use of parametric tests and years of experience, (p = 0.94), and there was no association with the number of examinations interpreted (p = 0.19-0.97). There was no association between the use of parametric tests and study indication, (p = 0.16); however, contrast curves were produced more frequently in non-staging studies, (p = 0.027).

Methods:   Fifty patients with low-risk organ-confined PCa were randomly assigned to two groups of equal number to receive TVSSLRP and nsELRP, respectively. Comparisons were made between the two groups of patients in such demographic and baseline data as age, comorbidity, body mass index (BMI), serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, bioptic Gleason score, clinical stage, IIEF-5 score, nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT), penile brachial index (PBI), and penile arterial blood flow velocity as well as in such surgery-related parameters as operation duration, blood loss, blood transfusion, intraoperative complications, positive surgical margin, catheterization time, hospital stay, and postoperative Gleason score, pathologic stage, urinal pad use, PSA level, IIEF-5 score, NPT, PBI and PABFV.  Results:   All the operations were successfully performed. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups either in the demographic and baseline data or in intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion rate, complications, and positive surgical margin. No intraoperative complications and positive surgical margins were found in either group. Compared with nsELRP, TVSSLRP achieved a significantly shorter operation duration ([151.46 ± 40.68] min vs [105.92 ± 26.21] min, P <0.05), catheterization time ([13.01 ± 1.64] d vs [11.24 ± 1.17] d, P <0.05), and hospital stay ([15.76 ± 4.65] d vs [12.92 ± 4.29] d, P <0.05). On the first day and at 1, 3 and 6 months after catheter removal, the urinary continence rates in the TVSSLRP and nsELRP groups were 84% vs 52% (P <0.05), 100% vs 84%, 100% vs 96%, and 100% vs 96%, respectively; and at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, the erectile potency rates were 48% vs 28% (P <0.05), 64% vs 52%, and 76% vs 68%, respectively, with an IIEF-5 score ≥ 18, all evidently higher in the TVSSLRP than in the nsELRP group. The penile brachial index and arterial blood flow velocity of the two groups of patients exhibited no significant differences before and after surgery, nor did postoperative complications (grade II) between the TVSSLRP and nsELRP groups (32% vs 40%, P >0.05). The Gleason score and pathologic stage were increased after surgery, but with remarkable differences between the two groups (P >0.05). No biochemical recurrence was found in either group during a 12-month follow-up.

The sensitivity and specificity of the MSP-DB were compared to those of the MSP.  Results:   The probes specifically hybridized with the methylated targets only in the MSP-DB, which allowed detecting GSTP1 and RASSF1A methylation in 23 of 50 and 14 of 50 patients with prostate cancer and in 2 of 17 and 4 of 17 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. MSP-DB following the MSP assay improved the sensitivity of detection to more than 0.01 % methylated status of a given high CpG-rich region. One methylated MSP product corresponding to the GSTP1, lack of methylated cytosine, was clearly detected on gel electrophoresis but barely visible on MSP-DB. Thus, the MSP-DB is suitable to eliminate the risk of false-positive results.  Conclusion:   The MSP-DB dispels the weakness of MSP and increases the sensitivity to simultaneous methylation analysis of multiple genes. The MSP-DB is advantageous for the promotion of DNA methylation markers in progressing quickly toward clinical application.""","""['Vo Thi Thuong Lan', 'Nguyen Thu Trang', 'Doan Thi Hong Van', 'Ta Bich Thuan', 'Ta Van To', 'Vuong Dieu Linh', 'Nguyen Quynh Uyen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Promoter methylation profile of GSTP1 and RASSF1A in prostate cancerand benign hyperplasia in Vietnamese men.', 'Methylation of multiple genes in prostate cancer and the relationship with clinicopathological features of disease.', 'Detection of aberrant promoter methylation of GSTP1, RASSF1A, and RARβ2 in serum DNA of patients with breast cancer by a newly established one-step methylation-specific PCR assay.', 'GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation as a molecular biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Molecular detection of prostate cancer: a role for GSTP1 hypermethylation.', 'The Mismatch Repair System (MMR) in Head and Neck Carcinogenesis and Its Role in Modulating the Response to Immunotherapy: A Critical Review.', 'Association of glutathione-S-transferase p1 gene promoter methylation and the incidence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Materials and methods:   All consecutive cases of NS-RC carried out between 1997 and 2012 were retrospectively analysed. NS-RC included nerve-sparing cysto-vesicleprostatectomy (NS-CVP), capsule-sparing cystectomy (CS-C) and seminal-sparing cysto-prostatectomy (SS-CP). Peri-operative parameters and post-operative outcomes were analysed.  Results:   Overall, 90 patients underwent NS-RC, 35 (38.9 %) of whom received a NS-CVP, while 36 (40 %) and 19 (21.1 %) underwent capsule CS-C and SS-CP, respectively. No difference was registered comparing oncologic outcomes of the three different techniques; however, two local recurrences after CS-C were attributed to the surgical technique. Complete post-operative daytime and night-time urinary continence (UC) at 24 and 48 months was achieved in 94.4 and 74.4 % and in 88.8 and 84.4 % of cases, respectively. CS-C showed both the best UC and sexual function preservation rate at early follow-up (24 months). Overall, a satisfactory post-operative erectile function (IIEF-5 ≥ 22) was proved in 57 (68.6 %) and 54 (65.0 %) patients at 24 and 48 months, respectively. Significant difference was found when comparing sexual function preservation rate of NS-CVP (28.5 %) to that of CS-C (91.6 %) and SS-CP (84.2 %).  Conclusion:   NS-RC for male patients accounted for 7.4 % of overall radical cystectomy. To a limited extent of the selected organ-confined bladder cancers treated, the three different procedures analysed showed comparable results in terms of local recurrence and cancer-specific survival. Both CS-C and SS-CP procedures provided excellent functional outcomes when compared to original NS-CVP.""","""['R Colombo', 'F Pellucchi', 'M Moschini', 'A Gallina', 'R Bertini', 'A Salonia', 'P Rigatti', 'F Montorsi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Nerve-sparing radical cystectomy has a beneficial impact on urinary continence after orthotopic bladder substitution, which becomes even more apparent over time.', 'Neobladder with prostatic capsule and seminal-sparing cystectomy for bladder cancer: a step in the wrong direction.', 'Prostate sparing cystectomy for bladder cancer: A two-center study.', 'Long-term functional and oncological outcomes of nerve-sparing and prostate capsule-sparing cystectomy: a single-centre experience.', 'Systematic review of the oncological and functional outcomes of pelvic organ-preserving radical cystectomy (RC) compared with standard RC in women who undergo curative surgery and orthotopic neobladder substitution for bladder cancer.', 'Prospective evaluation of functional outcomes in 395 patients with an ileal neobladder 1 year after radical cystectomy.', 'Development and evaluation of a rehabilitation training compliance scale for patients with urinary incontinence.', 'Oncological and functional outcomes of organ-preserving cystectomy versus standard radical cystectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Systematic review of robotic radical cystectomy functional and quality of life outcomes.', 'Modified completely intrafascial radical cysprostatectomy for bladder cancer: a single-center, blinded, controlled study.']"""

Methods:   A total of 146 patients with PSA levels between 0.2 and 1 ng/ml with negative conventional imaging who did not receive salvage treatment were prospectively enrolled. Imaging acquisition protocol included an early dynamic phase (1-8 min), a conventional whole body (10-20 min), and a late phase (30-40 min). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were measured. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of positive PET/CT.  Results:   The median trigger PSA was 0.6 ng/ml (IQR 0.43-0.76). Median PSA doubling time (PSA DT) was 7.91 months (IQR 4.42-11.3); median PSA velocity (PSAV) was 0.02 ng/ml per month (IQR 0.02-0.04). Overall, (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT was positive in 111 of 146 patients (76 %). Out of 111 positive examinations, 80 (72.1 %) were positive only in the early dynamic phase. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 78.9, 76.9, 97.2, 26.3, and 78.7 %, respectively.

However, little attention has been focused on the biological profile of the host model and its potential effects on the bio-distribution and tumor targeting of the tracer compound under study. We specifically investigated the dissimilarity in bio-distribution of (111)In-DTPA-5A10, which targets free prostate specific antigen (fPSA), in two animal models.  Methods:   In vivo bio-distribution studies of (111)In-DTPA-5A10 were performed in immunodeficient BALB/c-nu or NMRI-nu mice with subcutaneous (s.c.) LNCaP tumors. Targeting-specificity of the tracer was assessed by quantifying the uptake in (a) mice with s.c. xenografts of PSA-negative DU145 cells as well as (b) BALB/c-nu or NMRI-nu mice co-injected with an excess of non-labeled 5A10. Finally, the effect of neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn) inhibition on the bio-distribution of the conjugate was studied by saturating FcRn-binding capacity with nonspecific IgG1.  Results:   The inherent biological attributes of the mouse model substantially influenced the bio-distribution and pharmacokinetics of (111)In-DTPA-5A10. With LNCaP xenografts in BALB/c-nu mice (with intact B and NK cells but with deficient T cells) versus NMRI-nu mice (with intact B cells, increased NK cells and absent T cells), we observed a significantly higher hepatic accumulation (26 ± 3.9 versus 3.5 ± 0.4%IA/g respectively), and concomitantly lower tumor uptake (25 ± 11 versus 52 ± 10%IA/g respectively) in BALB/c-nu mice. Inhibiting FcRn by administration of nonspecific IgG1 just prior to (111)In-DTPA-5A10 did not change tumor accumulation significantly.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated that the choice of immunodeficient mouse model importantly influence the bio-distribution of (111)In-DTPA-5A10. This study further highlighted important considerations in the evaluation of preclinical tracers, with respect to gaining information on their performance in the translational setting.

Hepsin suppressed CDK11p58 IRES activity in PCa by modulating unr expression and eIF-2α phosphorylation. Further studies revealed that hepsin inhibited the expression of unr by directly binding to unr IRES element and suppressing its activity, and also repressed eIF-2α phosphorylation through down-regulating the expression and phosphorylation of general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2).

Contrary to the traditional view that speckles are adverse to segmentation, we exploit intrinsic properties induced by speckles to facilitate the task, based on the observations that sizes and orientations of speckles provide salient cues to determine the prostate boundary. Since the speckle orientation changes in accordance with a statistical prior rule, rotation-invariant texture feature is extracted along the orientations revealed by the rule. To address the problem of feature changes due to different speckle sizes, TRUS images are split into several arc-like strips. In each strip, every individual feature vector is sparsely represented, and representation residuals are obtained. The residuals, along with the spatial coherence inherited from biological tissues, are combined to segment the prostate preliminarily via graph cuts. After that, the segmentation is fine-tuned by a novel level sets model, which integrates (1) the prostate shape prior, (2) dark-to-light intensity transition near the prostate boundary, and (3) the texture feature just obtained. The proposed method is validated on two 2-D image datasets obtained from two different sonographic imaging systems, with the mean absolute distance on the mid gland images only 1.06±0.53 mm and 1.25±0.77 mm, respectively.

Methods and materials:   We evaluated 156 patients with biopsy-proven, clinically localized PCa who underwent RP between January 2013 and December 2013 at 2 tertiary care institutions. Blood and urinary specimens were collected before initial prostate biopsy for [-2] pro-prostate-specific antigen (PSA), its derivates, and PCA3 measurements. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine the variables that were potentially predictive of tumor volume > 0.5 ml, pathologic Gleason sum ≥ 7, pathologically confirmed significant PCa, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesicles invasions.  Results:   On multivariate analyses and after bootstrapping with 1,000 resampled data, the inclusion of PHI significantly increased the accuracy of a baseline multivariate model, which included patient age, total PSA, free PSA, rate of positive cores, clinical stage, prostate volume, body mass index, and biopsy Gleason score (GS), in predicting the study outcomes.

Although both PHI and PCA3 significantly improved predictive accuracy to predict extracapsular extension compared with the baseline model, achieving independent predictor status (all P's < 0.01), only PHI led to a significant improvement in the prediction of seminal vesicles invasions (AUC = 92.2, P < 0.05 with a gain of 3.6%). In the subset of patients with GS ≤ 6, PHI significantly improved predictive accuracy by 7.6% compared with the baseline model (AUC = 89.7 vs. 97.3) to predict pathologically confirmed significant PCa and by 5.9% compared with the baseline model (AUC = 83.1 vs. 89.0) to predict pathologic GS ≥ 7.

To evaluate the cancer-height relationship, we carried out a study using international data, comparing various cancer rates with average adult height of women and men in different countries.  Methods:   An ecological analysis of the relationship between country-specific cancer incidence rates and average adult height was conducted for twenty-four anatomical cancer sites. Age-standardized rates were obtained from GLOBOCAN 2008. Average female (112 countries) and male (65 countries) heights were sourced and compiled primarily from national health surveys. Graphical and weighted regression analysis was conducted, taking into account BMI and controlling for the random effect of global regions.  Results:   A significant positive association between a country's average adult height and the country's overall cancer rate was observed in both men and women. Site-specific cancer incidence for females was positively associated with height for most cancers: lung, kidney, colorectum, bladder, melanoma, brain and nervous system, breast, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, corpus uteri, ovary, and leukemia. A significant negative association was observed with cancer of the cervix uteri. In males, site-specific cancer incidence was positively associated with height for cancers of the brain and nervous system, kidney, colorectum, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, prostate, testicular, lip and oral cavity, and melanoma.  Conclusion:   Incidence of cancer was associated with tallness in the majority of anatomical/cancer sites investigated.

As the U.S. population ages, cancer screening increases, and cancer treatments improve, millions more Americans will be classified as cancer survivors in the future.

Many survivors are older and have comorbidities, which should be addressed to optimize function and longevity. Common late effects of cancer and its treatment include second primary cancers, sexual dysfunction, and psychosocial issues. Cancer recurrence is a significant concern. After treatment for colorectal cancer, intensive surveillance, including colonoscopy, imaging, and serology, confers an overall survival benefit. Breast cancer survivors should receive annual mammography. Prostate cancer survivors should undergo prostate-specific antigen testing every six to 12 months. Melanoma survivors should be counseled on sun protection, including daily sunscreen use, and recognizing characteristics of potentially malignant skin lesions. Female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma who were treated with chest or axillary radiation between 10 and 30 years of age are at high risk of breast cancer, and should be screened with mammography and magnetic resonance imaging annually starting eight to 10 years after the diagnosis.

The aim of this study was to investigate PTP1B amplification in gastric cancer and its association with poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients, and further determine the role of PTP1B in gastric tumorigenesis. Our data demonstrated that PTP1B was significantly up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues as compared with matched normal gastric tissues by using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. In addition, copy number analysis showed that PTP1B was amplified in 68/131 (51.9%) gastric cancer cases, whereas no amplification was found in the control subjects. Notably, PTP1B amplification was positively associated with its protein expression, and was significantly related to poor survival of gastric cancer patients. Knocking down PTP1B expression in gastric cancer cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and induced cell cycle arrested and apoptosis. Mechanically, PTP1B promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation, survival and invasiveness through modulating Src-related signaling pathways, such as Src/Ras/MAPK and Src/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. Collectively, our data demonstrated frequent overexpression and amplification PTP1B in gastric cancer, and further determined the oncogenic role of PTP1B in gastric carcinogenesis.

Prostate plans were created using 10 MV 3D-CRT (78 Gy in 39 fractions) and 6 MV 5-field IMRT (78 Gy in 39 fractions), VMAT (78 Gy in 39 fractions, with standard flattened and energy-matched FFF beams) and SABR (42.7 Gy in 7 fractions with standard flattened and energy-matched FFF beams). Dose-volume histograms from pelvic planning CT scans of three prostate patients, each planned using all 6 techniques, were used to calculate organ equivalent doses (OED) and excess absolute risks (EAR) of second rectal and bladder cancers, and pelvic bone and soft tissue sarcomas, using mechanistic, bell-shaped and plateau models. For organs distant to the treatment field, chamber measurements recorded in an anthropomorphic phantom were used to calculate OEDs and EARs using a linear model. Ratios of OED give relative radiation-induced second cancer risks. SABR resulted in lower second cancer risks at all sites relative to 3D-CRT. FFF resulted in lower second cancer risks in out-of-field tissues relative to equivalent flattened techniques, with increasing impact in organs at greater distances from the field. For example, FFF reduced second cancer risk by up to 20% in the stomach and up to 56% in the brain, relative to the equivalent flattened technique. Relative to 10 MV 3D-CRT, 6 MV IMRT or VMAT with flattening filter increased second cancer risks in several out-of-field organs, by up to 26% and 55%, respectively. For all techniques, EARs were consistently low. The observed large relative differences between techniques, in absolute terms, were very low, highlighting the importance of considering absolute risks alongside the corresponding relative risks, since when absolute risks are very low, large relative risks become less meaningful. A calculated relative radiation-induced second cancer risk benefit from SABR and FFF techniques was theoretically predicted, although absolute radiation-induced second cancer risks were low for all techniques, and absolute differences between techniques were small.""","""['Louise J Murray', 'Christopher M Thompson', 'John Lilley', 'Vivian Cosgrove', 'Kevin Franks', 'David Sebag-Montefiore', 'Ann M Henry']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Comparison of VMAT-SABR treatment plans with flattening filter (FF) and flattening filter-free (FFF) beam for localized prostate cancer.', 'The Effect of Flattening Filter Free on Three-dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT), Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) Plans for Metastatic Brain Tumors from Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Volumetric modulation arc radiotherapy with flattening filter-free beams compared with static gantry IMRT and 3D conformal radiotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer: a feasibility study.', 'Advances in Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Efficacy of flattening-filter-free beam in stereotactic body radiation therapy planning and treatment: A systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'Cellular Damage in the Target and Out-Of-Field Peripheral Organs during VMAT SBRT Prostate Radiotherapy: An In Vitro Phantom-Based Study.', 'Urological complications after radiation therapy-nothing ventured, nothing gained: a Narrative Review.', 'Risk for second bladder and rectal malignancies from cervical cancer irradiation.', 'Secondary cancer risk from modern external-beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer patients: Impact of fractionation and dose distribution.', 'VMAT for prostate cancer with 6-MV and 10-MV photons: Impact of beam energy on treatment plan quality and model-based secondary cancer risk estimates.']"""

Since miRNAs suppress the expression of their target genes, we hypothesized that some miR-21 targets may act as tumor suppressors, and thus their expression would be anticipated to be reduced by the high miR-21 levels observed in various human cancers. By microarray analysis and quantitative PCR we identified and validated FBXO11 (a member of the F-box subfamily lacking a distinct unifying domain) as a miR-21 target gene. FBXO11 is a component of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex that targets proteins for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. By loss of function and gain of function studies, we show that FBXO11 acts as a tumor suppressor, promotes apoptosis and mediates the degradation of the oncogenic protein BCL6. The critical role that FBXO11 plays in miR-21-mediated tumorigenesis was demonstrated by a rescue experiment, in which silencing FBXO11 in miR-21KD cancer cells restored their high tumorigenicity. Expression of miR-21 and FBXO11 are inversely correlated in tumor tissue, and their expression correlates with patient survival and tumor grade. High FBXO11 expression correlates with better patient survival and lower tumor grade consistent with its tumor suppressor activity. In contrast high miR-21 expression, which correlates with poor patient survival and higher tumor grade, is consistent with its oncogenic activity. Our results identify FBXO11 as a novel miR-21 target gene, and demonstrate that the oncogenic miRNA miR-21 decreases the expression of FBXO11, which normally acts as a tumor suppressor, and thereby promotes tumorigenesis.""","""['Chuan He Yang', 'Susan R Pfeffer', 'Michelle Sims', 'Junming Yue', 'Yinan Wang', 'Vijay G Linga', 'Elena Paulus', 'Andrew M Davidoff', 'Lawrence M Pfeffer']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['miR-376a inhibits the proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma by targeting FBXO11.', 'FBXO11 targets BCL6 for degradation and is inactivated in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.', 'MiRNA-621 sensitizes breast cancer to chemotherapy by suppressing FBXO11 and enhancing p53 activity.', 'MicroRNA regulation of F-box proteins and its role in cancer.', 'The Role of miR-21 in Cancer.', 'The Role of miRNAs in the Development, Proliferation, and Progression of Endometrial Cancer.', 'FBXO11 constitutes a major negative regulator of MHC class II through ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of CIITA.', 'Effect of Photodynamic Therapy on the microRNA Level in Breast Cancer Tissues of Female Wistar Rats.', 'Specific Antibodies to the Fragments of Meningococcal IgA1 Protease during the Formation of Immunity to Bacterial Infections.', 'Disease progression role as well as the diagnostic and prognostic value of microRNA-21 in patients with cervical cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Accordingly, the impact of cancer treatment on sexual function is gaining more attention. To prospectively evaluate the impact of radical prostatectomy (RP) on male, female and conjugal sexual function. Patients were prospectively assessed by an urologist and a sexologist before and 6 months after robot-assisted laparoscopic RP (RALP). RALP was performed with uni- or bilateral neurovascular bundle preservation by a single surgeon. Postoperatively, all patients were prescribed tadalafil 20 mg, 3 times a week during 6 months. Male and female sexual functions were evaluated by using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Lock-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (MAT). Continuous variables were analyzed with rank-sum and t-tests, as needed, and categorical variables with chi-squared tests. All tests were two-sided, with a P-value ⩽ 0.05 considered significant. Twenty-one couples were included. Mean patient male and female age was 62.4 and 60.7 years, respectively. Bilateral nerve sparing was performed in 12/21 (57%) patients. Median preoperative IIEF-5 was 20/25, corresponding to mild erectile dysfunction (ED). Median preoperative FSFI and MAT were both within normal range (28/36 and 114/158, respectively). Six months following surgery, both IIEF-5 (11/25) and FSFI (25/36) had significantly dropped (P=0.007 and 0.003, respectively). Postoperative decreases in IIEF-5 and FSFI scores were associated within couples. MAT scores (115/158), however, remained unaffected by RALP, showing an unmodified relationship satisfaction postoperatively. Finally, bilateral nerve sparing surgery preserved not only male but also female sexual function. This study shows that the expected short-term post-RALP ED is associated with a worsening of female sexual function, whereas nerve sparing surgery has a protective effect on both the patient's and his partner's sexual function with a significant effect of bilateral over unilateral neurovascular bundle preservation. Furthermore, we found that conjugal complicity remains stable throughout the first semestrial postoperative period despite the decrease in sexual function.""","""['S-N Tran', 'G J Wirth', 'G Mayor', 'C Rollini', 'F Bianchi-Demicheli', 'C E Iselin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Impot Res""","""['Effects of tadalafil treatment on erectile function recovery following bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a randomised placebo-controlled study (REACTT).', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prospective comprehensive assessment of sexual function after retropubic non nerve sparing radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Strategies to promote recovery of cavernous nerve function after radical prostatectomy.', 'Surgical Techniques for Managing Post-prostatectomy Erectile Dysfunction.', ""Psychosocial contributors to patients' and partners' postprostate cancer sexual recovery: 10 evidence-based and practical considerations."", 'Predictors of Patient and Partner Satisfaction Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Erectile dysfunction.']"""

Using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, bone mineral density (BMD), fat body mass (FBM), and lean body mass (LBM) were determined at baseline, and after 1 and 2 years in 53 non-metastatic prostate cancer (PC) patients with high-risk disease treated with adjuvant ADT. Changes in these parameters were correlated with patient outcome in terms of adverse skeletal events, disease recurrence, and overall survival. ADT led to a significant decrease in BMD (p < 0.03) and LBM (p < 0.03), and an increase in FBM, (p < 0.0001). Changes in BMD failed to show any relationship with time to skeletal-related events (SRE), disease recurrence, and death. FBM increase was a significant predictor of higher risk of SRE [hazard ratio (HR) 3.024, 95 % CI 1.004-10.353, p < 0.02], higher risk of death (HR 2.373, 95 % CI 1.012-5.567, p = 0.04), and a non-significant higher risk of disease recurrence (HR 2.219, 95 % CI 0.956-5.150, p = 0.13).

Methods:   Five-year actuarial biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS) and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCaSS) were calculated for 675 patients treated with DE-IG-IMRT and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients had intermediate-risk (IR) and high-risk (HR) disease. A search was conducted identifying Australian reports from 2005 onwards of IR and HR patients treated with surgery or brachytherapy, reporting actuarial outcomes at 3 years or later.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 59 months, our 5-year bDFS was 93.3% overall: 95.5% for IR and 91.3% for HR disease. MFS was 96.9% overall (99.0% IR, 94.9% HR), and PCaSS was 98.8% overall (100% IR, 97.7% HR). Prevalence of Grade 2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity at 5 years was 1.3% and 1.6%, with 0.3% Grade 3 genitourinary toxicity and no Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity. Eight reports of brachytherapy and surgery were identified. The HDR brachytherapy series' median 5-year bDFS was 82.5%, MFS 90.0% and PCaSS 97.9%. One surgical series reported 5-year bDFS of 65.5% for HR patients. One LDR series reported 5-year bDFS of 85% for IR patients.

Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a non-invasive and label-free technique that can detect radiation response through assessment of radiation-induced biochemical changes in tumor cells. In the current study, single-cell RS identified specific radiation-induced responses in four human epithelial tumor cell lines: lung (H460), breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), and prostate (LNCaP), following exposure to clinical doses of radiation (2-10 Gy). At low radiation doses (2 Gy), H460 and MCF-7 cell lines showed an increase in glycogen-related spectral features, and the LNCaP cell line showed a membrane phospholipid-related radiation response. In these cell lines, only spectral information from populations receiving 10 Gy or less was required to identify radiation-related features using principal component analysis (PCA). In contrast, the MDA-MB-231 cell line showed a significant increase in protein relative to nucleic acid and lipid spectral features at doses of 6 Gy or higher, and high-dose information (30, 50 Gy) was required for PCA to identify this biological response. The biochemical nature of the radiation-related changes occurring in cells exposed to clinical doses was found to segregate by status of p53 and radiation sensitivity. Furthermore, the utility of RS to identify a biological response in human tumor cells exposed to therapeutic doses of radiation was found to be governed by the extent of the biochemical changes induced by a radiation response and is therefore cell line specific. The results of this study demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of single-cell RS to identify and measure biological responses in tumor cells exposed to standard radiotherapy doses.""","""['Samantha J Harder', 'Quinn Matthews', 'Martin Isabelle', 'Alexandre G Brolo', 'Julian J Lum', 'Andrew Jirasek']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Appl Spectrosc""","""['Biochemical signatures of in vitro radiation response in human lung, breast and prostate tumour cells observed with Raman spectroscopy.', 'Raman spectroscopy of single human tumour cells exposed to ionizing radiation in vitro.', 'Raman spectroscopy identifies radiation response in human non-small cell lung cancer xenografts.', 'A quantitative overview of radiosensitivity of human tumor cells across histological type and TP53 status.', 'Overview of radiosensitivity of human tumor cells to low-dose-rate irradiation.', 'Understanding radiation response and cell cycle variation in brain tumour cells using Raman spectroscopy.', 'Raman Spectroscopy Revealed Cell Passage-Dependent Distinct Biochemical Alterations in Radiation-Resistant Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Raman spectroscopy and convolutional neural networks for monitoring biochemical radiation response in breast tumour xenografts.', 'Raman microspectroscopy and machine learning for use in identifying radiation-induced lung toxicity.', 'Application of Advanced Non-Linear Spectral Decomposition and Regression Methods for Spectroscopic Analysis of Targeted and Non-Targeted Irradiation Effects in an In-Vitro Model.']"""

Aim of the present study was to investigate the combined and stepwise use of the four most broadly available urine markers to detect tumor recurrence in patients undergoing surveillance of NMIBC.  Patients and methods:   483 patients with history of NMIBC were included. Cytology, UroVysion, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunocytology (uCyt+), and NMP22 ELISA were performed before surveillance cystoscopy. Characteristics of single tests and combinations were assessed by contingency analysis.  Results:   128 (26.5%) patients had evidence of tumor recurrence. Sensitivities and negative predictive values (NPVs) of the single tests ranged between 66.4-74.3 and 82.3-88.2%. Two-marker combinations showed sensitivities and NPVs of 80.5-89.8 and 89.5-91.2%. A stepwise application of the two-test combinations with highest accuracy (cytology and FISH; cytology and uCyt+; uCyt+ and FISH) showed NPVs for high-risk recurrences (G3/Cis/pT1) of 98.8, 98.8, and 99.1%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Combinations of cytology, FISH, immunocytology, and NMP22 show remarkable detection rates for recurrent NMIBC.

Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF1) is a key transcription factor in the Wnt signaling pathway, and has been suggested to be involved in regulation of cell proliferation and invasion. Here, the molecular mechanism of miR-34a and LEF1 in cooperatively regulating prostate cancer cell invasion is described. Molecular profiling analysis of miRNA levels in prostate cancer cells revealed a negative correlation between miR-34a and LEF1 expression, and the downregulation of LEF1 by miR-34a was confirmed by luciferase assays. Furthermore, miR-34a specifically repressed LEF1 expression through direct binding to its 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). miR-34a modulated the levels of LEF1 to regulate EMT in prostate cancer cells. Functionally, miR-34a negatively correlated with the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through LEF1. An analysis of miR-34a expression levels in matched human tumor and benign tissues demonstrated consistent and statistically significant downregulation of miR-34a in primary prostate cancer specimens. These data strongly suggest that miR-34a/LEF1 regulation of EMT plays an important role in prostate cancer migration and invasion.

Objective:   To describe a new resource for quality of care research based on a linkage between the Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS®) patient surveys and the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data.  Design:   This is an observational study of CAHPS respondents and includes both fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries with and without cancer. The data linkage includes: CAHPS survey data collected between 1998 and 2010 to assess patient reports on multiple aspects of their care, such as access to needed and timely care, doctor communication, as well as patients' global ratings of their personal doctor, specialists, overall health care, and their health plan; SEER registry data (1973-2007) on cancer site, stage, treatment, death information, and patient demographics; and longitudinal Medicare claims data (2002-2011) for fee-for-service beneficiaries on utilization and costs of care.  Participants:   In total, 150,750 respondents were in the cancer cohort and 571,318 were in the non-cancer cohort.  Main measures:   The data linkage includes SEER data on cancer site, stage, treatment, death information, and patient demographics, in addition to longitudinal data from Medicare claims and information on patient experiences from CAHPS surveys.  Key results:   Sizable proportions of cases from common cancers (e.g., breast, colorectal, prostate) and short-term survival cancers (e.g., pancreas) by time since diagnosis enable comparisons across the cancer care trajectory by MA vs. FFS coverage.

If UTF contain cytomorphologically atypical cells, the diagnosis often becomes more challenging. The authors previously analyzed the outcome of patients with benign-appearing UTF in 274 noninstrumented VU specimens. In this retrospective study, noninstrumented VU specimens containing UTF with atypical cytomorphological features (AUTF) were evaluated and compared with the previous results.  Methods:   The Johns Hopkins Hospital electronic pathology database was searched for VU cases containing UTF over a 5-year period.  Results:   A total of 170 noninstrumented VU specimens containing AUTF were identified. Twenty-four specimens had subsequent or coincidental surgical pathology specimens with the following overall rates of neoplasia: high-grade urothelial carcinoma: 8.8% (15 specimens), low-grade urothelial neoplasia: 1.2% (2 specimens), and prostate carcinoma invading the bladder: 0.6% (1 specimen). A total of 49 specimens (28.8%) were diagnosed with urolithiasis on follow-up. Twenty-five cases had follow-up cytology specimens, all of which were negative for malignancy. Of 72 cases without histopathologic, radiologic, or cytopathologic follow-up, 62 (86.1%) had a mean clinical follow-up of 22.5 months and 10 cases did not have clinical follow-up.  Conclusions:   The presence of AUTF in noninstrumented VU is associated with low rates of urothelial neoplasia but a statistically higher risk of urothelial neoplasia than the presence of BUTF (10.0% vs 4.4%; P<.05). In particular, the rate of high-grade urothelial carcinoma is significantly higher in noninstrumented VU specimens containing AUTF than those containing BUTF (8.8% vs 0.7%; P<.0001).

Patients and methods:   Patients with LpC having prostate volume ≤90 cm(3) were enrolled in the present study. Patients were treated with SBRT alone or in combined modality (SBRT + EBRT). SBRT was performed using a CyberKnife System (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, California) and fiducial tracking system.  Results:   From February 2008 to July 2013, 21 patients for monotherapy (38 Gy/4 fractions) and 5 for combined modality (9.5 Gy/2 fractions plus 46 Gy/23 fractions EBRT) were enrolled. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was administered in 16 of the 26 patients. The median pretreatment PSA was 9.4 (range, 4.5-14.3) ng/mL. All patients completed the planned therapy. Acute Grade 1 toxicity was observed in 18 patients, genitourinary (GU) in 12 / 26 patients, and gastrointestinal (GI) in 6 / 26 patients. Acute Grade 2 GU toxicity was reported in 1 / 26 patients, and Grade 2 GI toxicity was observed in 2 / 26 patients. The median PSA nadir was 0.15 (range, 0.02 = 1.4) ng/mL. Late toxicities were observed in 5 / 26 patients: Grade 1 GU (3 of 26), Grade 2 GU (1 of 26), and Grade 1 GI (1 of 26). Median follow-up was 21.5 (range, 8-65) months.  Conclusions:   Our preliminary results of SBRT ""simulating"" HDR for LpC confirm a minimal toxicity and an optimal PSA response.

Methods:   The medical records of 4233 consecutive men with PSA levels of 3.0-10.0 ng/mL, who underwent prostate biopsy between 2007 and 2012 at our institute, were reviewed. The clinicopathologic characteristics were compared between patients with a PSA level of 3.0-4.0 ng/mL and those with a PSA level of 4.0-10.0 ng/mL. Predictive factors for high-grade (Gleason score ≥7) or insignificant cancer (defined according to the Epstein criteria) in men with a PSA level of 3.0-4.0 ng/mL were assessed.  Results:   The high-grade disease rates were similar between men with a PSA level of 3.0-4.0 ng/mL and those with a PSA level of 4.0-10.0 ng/mL (50.5% and 53.1%, respectively). The rates of clinically insignificant cancer were higher in men with a PSA level of 3.0-4.0 ng/mL than in those with a PSA level of 4.0-10.0 ng/mL (28.4% vs 12.5%; P <.001). However, among patients with clinically insignificant cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy, only 20% of those with a PSA level of 3.0-4.0 ng/mL and 16% of those with a PSA level of 4.0-10.0 ng/mL showed pathologically insignificant cancer. Prostate volume was an independent predictor of high-grade disease in men with PSA levels of 3.0-4.0 ng/mL.  Conclusion:   More than half of the cancer patients had high-grade disease in men with a PSA level of 3.0-4.0 ng/mL, and most cases of clinically insignificant cancer were diagnosed as significant cancer on prostatectomy specimens, suggesting that the optimal PSA threshold for prostate biopsy in Korean men is 3.0 ng/mL.""","""['Seung-Kwon Choi', 'Cheryn Song', 'Myungsun Shim', 'Gyeong Eun Min', 'Jinsung Park', 'In Gab Jeong', 'Jun Hyuk Hong', 'Choung-Soo Kim', 'Hanjong Ahn']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Prediction of pathological outcomes for a single microfocal (≤3 mm) Gleason 6 prostate cancer detected via contemporary multicore (≥12) biopsy in men with prostate-specific antigen ≤10 ng/mL.', 'Predictive value of four kallikrein markers for pathologically insignificant compared with aggressive prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens: results from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer section Rotterdam.', 'Detection rates of nonpalpable prostate cancer in Korean men with prostate-specific antigen levels between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/mL.', 'Prospective evaluation of men with stage T1C adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Nonpalpable stage T1c prostate cancer: prediction of insignificant disease using free/total prostate specific antigen levels and needle biopsy findings.', 'Use of docetaxel plus androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer in Korean patients: A retrospective study.', 'Current Trends in the Incidence and Survival Rate of Urological Cancers in Korea.']"""

Here, we not only detected significant decreases in plasma adiponectin levels in prostate cancer patients, but also showed significant decreases in adiponectin receptor I (AdipoR1) levels in the resected prostate cancer specimen. Prostate cancer cell lines examined in the current study had all lower levels of adiponectin and AdipoR1, compared to normal healthy prostate tissue. Moreover, overexpression of adiponectin in prostate cancer cells decreased production of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), while adiponectin depletion increased VEGF-A. Furthermore, adiponectin seemed to activate AMPK/TSC2 to inhibit mTor-mediated activation of VEGF-A.

In prostate cancer (PC), determination of DTCs is critically discussed as there are conflicting results on their prognostic value. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence and prognostic role of DTCs in PC patients with a high risk of disease recurrence.  Methods:   248 patients with clinically localized PC undergoing radical prostatectomy with features of increased risk of recurrence (PSA ≥10 ng/ml or Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3 = 7 or pT ≥3) were included. All patients underwent intraoperative bone marrow (BM) aspiration biopsy. BM cells were evaluated by immunocytochemistry for cytokeratines and the apoptosis marker caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 (M30). Results of immunocytochemistry were correlated with clinical and pathological parameters and clinical outcome of the patients.  Results:   Of 248 patients, 47 (19.0%) had evidence of DTCs at time of radical prostatectomy. In 17 of these 47 patients (36.2%), DTCs expressed the apoptosis marker M30. We observed no correlation between the presence of DTCs and tumor stage, nodal stage, prostate-specific antigen, or Gleason score. After a median-follow-up of 58 months (23-76), no differences in rates of biochemical recurrence, development of metastases and cancer-specific death were observed between patients with and without DTCs while apoptosis markers had no role.  Conclusions:   In a single-centre cohort of patients with increased risk for disease recurrence, the presence of DTCs at the time of prostatectomy does not influence clinical outcome. For the first time in patients with PC, DTCs were evaluated for immunocytological features indicating apoptosis.

We propose CYP3A5 is part of a feedback loop that modulates the sensitivity of AR to androgen exposure. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of regulation of AR expression by CYP3A5.  Methods:   To identify the role of CYP3A5 in regulating AR signaling, CYP3A5 protein expression was inhibited using CYP3A5 siRNA and azamulin. Both cell fractionation and immunocytochemical approaches in combination with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and R1881 treatment were used to evaluate changes in AR nuclear translocation.  Results:   CYP3A5 siRNA blocked growth of LNCaP and C4-2 cells by 30-60% (P ≤ 0.005). Azamulin, a CYP3A pharmacologic inhibitor, reduced the growth of LNCaP, C4-2 and 22RV1 lines by ∼ 40% (P ≤ 0.005). CYP3A5 siRNA inhibited growth in response to DHT and R1881 treatment in LNCaP and C4-2 by decreasing nuclear AR localization and resulting in diminished PSA and TMPRSS2 expression. Decreased AR nuclear localization resulting from CYP3A5 inhibition resulted in growth inhibition comparable to IC60 and IC40 of bicalutamide in LNCaP and C4-2 cell lines. Conversely, the CYP3A inducer rifampicin enhanced AR nuclear localization.  Conclusion:   As CYP3A5 regulates the nuclear translocation of AR; co-targeting CYP3A5 may provide a novel strategy for enhancing the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy.

Based on previous observations that NUSAP1 expression is enhanced by E2F1, we hypothesized that NUSAP1 expression is regulated, at least in part, by loss of RB1 via the RB1/E2F1 axis.  Methods:   Using Significance Analysis of Microarrays, we examined RB1, E2F1, and NUSAP1 transcript levels in prostate cancer gene expression datasets. We compared NUSAP1 expression levels in DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines via use of cDNA microarray data, RT-qPCR, and Western blots. In addition, we used lentiviral expression constructs to knockdown RB1 in prostate cancer cell lines and transient transfections to knockdown E2F1, and investigated RB1, E2F1, and NUSAP1 expression levels with RT-qPCR and Western blots. Finally, in DU145 cells or PC-3 cells that stably underexpress RB1, we used proliferation and invasion assays to assess whether NUSAP1 knockdown affects proliferation or invasion.  Results:   NUSAP1 transcript levels are positively correlated with E2F1 and negatively correlated with RB1 transcript levels in prostate cancer microarray datasets. NUSAP1 expression is elevated in the RB1-null DU145 prostate cancer cell line, as opposed to LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines. Furthermore, NUSAP1 expression increases upon knockdown of RB1 in prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC-3) and decreases after knockdown of E2F1. Lastly, knockdown of NUSAP1 in DU145 cells or PC-3 cells with stable knockdown of RB1 decreases proliferation and invasion of these cells.  Conclusion:   Our studies support the notion that NUSAP1 expression is upregulated by loss of RB1 via the RB1/E2F1 axis in prostate cancer cells.

Materials and methods:   Indocyanine green was injected into the prostate under transrectal ultrasound guidance just before surgery. Intraoperative fluorescence imaging was performed using a near-infrared camera system in 66 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer after a 10-patient pilot test to optimize indocyanine green dosing, observation timing and injection method. Lymphatic vessels were visualized and followed to identify the sentinel lymph nodes. Confirmatory pelvic lymph node dissection including all fluorescent nodes and open radical prostatectomy were performed in all patients.  Results:   Lymphatic vessels were successfully visualized in 65 patients (98%) and sentinel lymph nodes in 64 patients (97%). Sentinel lymph nodes were located in the obturator fossa, internal and external iliac regions, and rarely in the common iliac and presacral regions. A median of 4 sentinel lymph nodes per patient was detected. Three lymphatic pathways, the paravesical, internal and lateral routes, were identified. Pathological examination revealed metastases to 9 sentinel lymph nodes in 6 patients (9%). All pathologically positive lymph nodes were detected as sentinel lymph nodes using this imaging. No adverse reactions due to the use of indocyanine green were observed.  Conclusions:   Intraoperative fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green during open prostatectomy enables the detection of lymphatic vessels and sentinel lymph nodes with high sensitivity. This novel method is technically feasible, safe and easy to apply with minimal additional operative time.""","""['Keiji Yuen', 'Tetsuya Miura', 'Iori Sakai', 'Akiko Kiyosue', 'Masuo Yamashita']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Visualisation of the lymph node pathway in real time by laparoscopic radioisotope- and fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node dissection in prostate cancer staging.', 'Fluorescence-enhanced robotic radical prostatectomy using real-time lymphangiography and tissue marking with percutaneous injection of unconjugated indocyanine green: the initial clinical experience in 50 patients.', 'A Specific Mapping Study Using Fluorescence Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Patients with Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer Undergoing Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection.', 'Advances in sentinel node dissection in prostate cancer from a technical perspective.', 'Sentinel node mapping with indocyanine green and endoscopic near-infrared fluorescence imaging in endometrial cancer.

This report describes the incidence, drivers, cost, and morbidity of overtreatment of low-risk prostate cancer within the United States.  Methods:   The SEER-Medicare Program was used to identify 11,744 men aged 66 years or older diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer in 2004 through 2007. Overtreatment of prostate cancer was defined as definitive treatment of a patient with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. Expected survival was estimated using NCCN methodology. Costs were the amount paid by Medicare in years after minus year before diagnosis. Toxicities were relevant Medicare diagnoses/interventions. P values are 2-sided.  Results:   Of 3001 men with low-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy of less than 10 years, 2011 men (67%) were overtreated. On multivariable logistic regression, overtreated men were more likely to be married (odds ratio [OR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05-1.59; P=.02), reside in affluent regions (P<.001), and harbor more advanced disease at diagnosis (P<.001). Two-year toxicity was greater in overtreated patients (P<.001). Relative to active surveillance/watchful waiting/observation, the median additional cost per definitive treatment was $18,827 over 5 years; the cumulative annual cost attributable to overtreatment in the United States was $58.7 million. The ability to avoid treating the 80% of men with low-grade disease who will never die of prostate cancer would save $1.32 billion per year nationally.  Conclusions:   Overtreatment of low-risk prostate cancer is partially driven by sociodemographic factors and occurs frequently, with marked impact on patient quality of life and health-related costs.""","""['Ayal A Aizer', 'Xiangmei Gu', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Neil E Martin', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Andrew S Hyatt', 'Powell L Graham', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Jim C Hu', 'Paul L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['Total Medicare Costs Associated With Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer in Elderly Men.', 'The cost-effectiveness of active surveillance compared to watchful waiting and radical prostatectomy for low risk localised prostate cancer.', 'Impact of serious mental illness on the treatment and mortality of older patients with locoregional high-grade (nonmetastatic) prostate cancer: retrospective cohort analysis of 49\xa0985 SEER-Medicare patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2013.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Does including histological outcomes in a multiparametric MRI report improve prostate biopsy decision making?', 'A Novel Risk Score (P-score) Based on a Three-Gene Signature, for Estimating the Risk of Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis and Microsimulation of Serial Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Active Surveillance of Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of the treatment of men with prostate cancer between the US and England: an international population-based study.', 'Time Trends in Use of Radical Prostatectomy by Tumor Risk and Life Expectancy in a National Veterans Affairs Cohort.']"""

A truncating mutation (IVS2 + 1G>A, 1100delC or del5395) was associated with a higher risk of thyroid cancer (OR = 5.7; p = 0.006), than was the missense mutation I157T (OR = 2.8; p = 0.0001). CHEK2 mutation carriers reported a family history of breast cancer 2.2 times more commonly than non-carriers (16.4% vs.8.1%; p = 0.05). A CHEK2 mutation was found in seven of 11 women (63%) with multiple primary cancers of the breast and thyroid (OR = 10; p = 0.0004).

Methods and materials:   Retrospective study of 700 patients who underwent transperineal ultrasound-guided iodine-125 PPB (145 Gy) between January 2000 and July 2012. Median age was 64.8 years (range, 35-79). Most patients (638 of 700; 91%) had low-risk disease (D'Amico criteria). Eighty-five patients (12%) received hormonal treatment. Overall survival, cause-specific survival, and biochemical relapse-free survival were calculated and estimated using actuarial and Kaplan-Meier methods. Differences between groups were assessed using the log-rank test.  Results:   Median followup was 63 months (range, 6-164).

All patients were diagnosed due to suspicious prostate findings and elevated PSA serum levels and underwent PCT followed by core biopsy and radical prostatectomy. Blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), and permeability-surface (PS) area product were computed in the suspected PCa area and normal prostatic tissue. Core biopsy followed by prostatectomy was performed 2-4 weeks after PCT. Correlation between PCT findings and PSA levels, Gleason score, and pTNM stage were analyzed.  Results:   The mean age of patients was 64 years. All patients had elevated PSA levels (mean value 6.2 ng/ml). Nineteen patients (15.9%) were at low risk of recurrence, 91 (76.5%) were at moderate risk, and 9 (7.6%) were at high risk according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria.

Methods:   Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) - Medicare database, patients were over age 65 and diagnosed between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2011 with any stage of cancer when the cause of death, as defined by SEER, was cancer; or with stage 4 cancer, who died of any cause. We employed multiple logistic regression models to identify patient and health systems factors associated with palliative radiation use.  Results:   50% of patients received RT in the last 6 months of life. RT was used less frequently in older patients and in non-Hispanic white patients. Similar patterns were observed in the last 14 days of life. Chemotherapy use in the last 6 months of life was strongly correlated with receiving RT in the last 6 months (OR 2.72, 95% CI: 2.59-2.88) and last 14 days of life (OR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.40-1.66). Patients receiving RT accrued more emergency department visits, radiographic exams and physician visits (all comparisons p < 0.0001).

Recently, the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) rs2294008 C>T polymorphism was found to be associated with different pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer developments. However, whether PSCA rs2294008 C>T polymorphism is associated with severity of gastric mucosal atrophy is unclear. We examined the influence of the PSCA rs2294008 C>T polymorphism on susceptibility to H. pylori-related diseases and the relationships between PSCA polymorphism and gastric mucosal atrophy.  Methods:   PSCA rs2294008 C>T polymorphism was assessed in H. pylori-positive Japanese patients (n = 488) with noncardia gastric cancer (n = 193), gastric ulcer (n = 84), duodenal ulcer (n = 61), and atrophic gastritis (n = 150), as well as in H. pylori-negatives (n = 266).  Results:   Frequency of PSCA rs2294008 C/C genotype in duodenal ulcer was 36.1%, which was significantly higher than those with gastric cancer (12.4%), gastric ulcer (19.0%), gastritis (10.7%), and H. pylori-negatives (19.5%) (p < .001). Compared with duodenal ulcer, having the T allele significantly increased the risk of gastric cancer (OR: 3.97, 95% CI: 2.02-7.80; p < .001), gastric ulcer (2.40, 1.13-5.10; p = .023), and gastritis (4.72, 2.26-9.86; p < .001). Mean pepsinogen (PG) I/PG II ratio in T allele carriers (2.17 ± 0.75) was significantly lower than that in C/C genotype (3.39 ± 1.27, p < .001).  Conclusions:   The PSCA rs2294008 C>T polymorphism is associated with differing susceptibilities to H. pylori-associated diseases. The PSCA rs2294008 C>T polymorphism may be acting through induction of gastric mucosal atrophy, finally leading to development of gastric ulcer and gastric cancer in PSCA rs2294008 T allele carriers, but not duodenal ulcer.""","""['Hitomi Ichikawa', 'Mitsushige Sugimoto', 'Takahiro Uotani', 'Shu Sahara', 'Mihoko Yamade', 'Moriya Iwaizumi', 'Takanori Yamada', 'Satoshi Osawa', 'Ken Sugimoto', 'Hiroaki Miyajima', 'Yoshio Yamaoka', 'Takahisa Furuta']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Helicobacter""","""['Prostate Stem Cell Antigen Gene Polymorphism Is Associated with H. pylori-related Promoter DNA Methylation in Nonneoplastic Gastric Epithelium.', 'Association of PSCA rs2294008 gene variants with poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to gastric cancer and decreased risk of duodenal ulcer disease.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen gene TT genotype and development of intestinal metaplasia in Helicobacter pylori infection.', 'Possible role of genetic factors on reduced risk for gastric cancer among duodenal ulcer patients.', 'Helicobacter pylori virulence genes and host genetic polymorphisms as risk factors for peptic ulcer disease.', 'Chemoprevention of gastric cancer development after Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy in an East Asian population: Meta-analysis.', 'Evidence for PTGER4, PSCA, and MBOAT7 as risk genes for gastric cancer on the genome and transcriptome level.', 'Association between PSCA gene polymorphisms and the risk of cancer: an updated meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.', 'Efficacy of the Kyoto Classification of Gastritis in Identifying Patients at High Risk for Gastric Cancer.', 'Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric pathology: insights from in vivo and ex vivo models.']"""

In the present work, we studied the effect of PTN on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human endothelial cells and the involvement of ROS in PTN-induced cell migration. Exogenous PTN significantly increased ROS levels in a concentration and time-dependent manner in both human endothelial and prostate cancer cells, while knockdown of endogenous PTN expression in prostate cancer cells significantly down-regulated ROS production. Suppression of RPTPβ/ζ through genetic and pharmacological approaches, or inhibition of c-src kinase activity abolished PTN-induced ROS generation. A synthetic peptide that blocks PTN-ανβ3 interaction abolished PTN-induced ROS generation, suggesting that ανβ3 is also involved. The latter was confirmed in CHO cells that do not express β3 or over-express wild-type β3 or mutant β3Y773F/Y785F. PTN increased ROS generation in cells expressing wild-type β3 but not in cells not expressing or expressing mutant β3. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or Erk1/2 inhibition suppressed PTN-induced ROS production, suggesting that ROS production lays down-stream of PI3K or Erk1/2 activation by PTN. Finally, ROS scavenging and xanthine oxidase inhibition completely abolished both PTN-induced ROS generation and cell migration, while NADPH oxidase inhibition had no effect. Collectively, these data suggest that xanthine oxidase-mediated ROS production is required for PTN-induced cell migration through the cell membrane functional complex of ανβ3 and RPTPβ/ζ and activation of c-src, PI3K and ERK1/2 kinases.""","""['Sotiria Tsirmoula', 'Margarita Lamprou', 'Maria Hatziapostolou', 'Nelly Kieffer', 'Evangelia Papadimitriou']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Microvasc Res""","""['Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 mediates pleiotrophin-induced endothelial cell migration.', 'Integrin alpha(v)beta(3) is a pleiotrophin receptor required for pleiotrophin-induced endothelial cell migration through receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta.', 'Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta is a functional binding partner for vascular endothelial growth factor.', 'Pleiotrophin and its receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta as regulators of angiogenesis and cancer.', 'Anaplastic lymphoma kinase: ""Ligand Independent Activation"" mediated by the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway.', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Zeta 1 as a Potential Target in Cancer Therapy and Diagnosis.', 'Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitor Febuxostat Exerts an Anti-Inflammatory Action and Protects against Diabetic Nephropathy Development in KK-Ay Obese Diabetic Mice.', 'Deficiency of the clock gene Bmal1 affects neural progenitor cell migration.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 mediates pleiotrophin-induced endothelial cell migration.', 'p66Shc regulates migration of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.']"""

Here, we find CRIPTO expression as especially high in a subgroup of primary prostate carcinomas with poorer outcome, wherein resides cancer cell clones with mesenchymal traits. Experimental studies in PCa models showed that one notable function of CRIPTO expression in prostate carcinoma cells may be to augment PI3K/AKT and FGFR1 signaling, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and sustains a mesenchymal state. In the observed signaling events, FGFR1 appears to function parallel to AKT, and the two pathways act cooperatively to enhance migratory, invasive and transformation properties specifically in the CRIPTO overexpressing cells.

Here we report that Skp2 modulates JARID1B and H3K4me3 levels in vitro in cultured cells and in vivo in mouse models. We demonstrated that Skp2 inactivation decreased H3K4me3 levels, along with a reduction of cell growth, cell migration and malignant transformation of Pten/Trp53 double null MEFs, and further restrained prostate tumorigenesis of Pten/Trp53 mutant mice. Mechanistically, Skp2 decreased the K63-linked ubiquitination of JARID1B by E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, thus decreasing JARID1B demethylase activity and in turn increasing H3K4me3. In agreement, Skp2 deficiency resulted in an increase of JARID1B ubiquitination and in turn a reduction of H3K4me3, and induced senescence through JARID1B accumulation in nucleoli of PCa cells and prostate tumors of mice. Furthermore, we showed that the elevations of Skp2 and H3K4me3 contributed to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in mice, and were positively correlated in human PCa specimens.

Purified exosomes impaired classical adipogenic differentiation, skewing differentiation towards alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) positive myofibroblastic cells.

Methods and materials:   Planning datasets for 754 participants in the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial were available, with Late Effects of Normal Tissues (LENT) Subjective, Objective, Management, and Analytic (SOMA) toxicity assessment to a median of 72 months. A rank sum method was used to define dose-volume cut-points as near-continuous functions of dose to 3 GI anatomical regions, together with a comprehensive assessment of significance. Univariate and multivariate ordinal regression was used to assess the importance of cut-points at each dose.  Results:   Dose ranges providing significant cut-points tended to be consistent with those showing significant univariate regression odds-ratios (representing the probability of a unitary increase in toxicity grade per percent relative volume). Ranges of significant cut-points for rectal bleeding validated previously published results. Separation of the lower GI anatomy into complete anorectum, rectum, and anal canal showed the impact of mid-low doses to the anal canal on urgency and tenesmus, completeness of evacuation and stool frequency, and mid-high doses to the anorectum on bleeding and stool frequency. Derived multivariate models emphasized the importance of the high-dose region of the anorectum and rectum for rectal bleeding and mid- to low-dose regions for diarrhea and urgency and tenesmus, and low-to-mid doses to the anal canal for stool frequency, diarrhea, evacuation, and bleeding.

Methods and materials:   Patient data were obtained from the ProCaRS database, which contains 7974 prostate cancer patients treated with primary radiation therapy at four Canadian cancer institutions from 1994 to 2010. Propensity score matching was used to obtain the following 3 matched cohorts with balanced baseline prognostic factors: (1) low-risk LDR-BT versus EBRT; (2) intermediate-risk LDR-BT versus EBRT; and (3) intermediate-risk HDR-BT+EBRT versus EBRT. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to compare differences in bFFS (primary endpoint) and OS in the 3 matched groups.  Results:   Propensity score matching created acceptable balance in the baseline prognostic factors in all matches. Final matches included 2 1:1 matches in the intermediate-risk cohorts, LDR-BT versus EBRT (total n=254) and HDR-BT+EBRT versus EBRT (total n=388), and one 4:1 match in the low-risk cohort (LDR-BT:EBRT, total n=400). Median follow-up ranged from 2.7 to 7.3 years for the 3 matched cohorts. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that all BT treatment options were associated with statistically significant improvements in bFFS when compared with EBRT in all cohorts (intermediate-risk EBRT vs LDR-BT hazard ratio [HR] 4.58, P=.001; intermediate-risk EBRT vs HDR-BT+EBRT HR 2.08, P=.007; low-risk EBRT vs LDR-BT HR 2.90, P=.004). No significant difference in OS was found in all comparisons (intermediate-risk EBRT vs LDR-BT HR 1.27, P=.687; intermediate-risk EBRT vs HDR-BT+EBRT HR 1.55, P=.470; low-risk LDR-BT vs EBRT HR 1.41, P=.500).

Objectives:   This study aimed to report the prevalence of numbness/tingling (N/T) and neuropathic pain in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) vs. other cancers, describe the prevalence of moderate-to-severe N/T by specific clinical variables, and examine factors associated with the presence of these symptoms.  Methods:   A total of 3106 outpatients with colorectal (n = 718), breast (n = 1544), lung (n = 524), or prostate (n = 320) cancer were enrolled at any point in their treatment.

Population-based studies have established that, since the frequency of this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) varies between geographic regions, the associated proportion of prostate cancer (PrCa) risk contribution is also highly variable by country.  Patients and methods:   This is the largest comprehensive case-control study assessing the prevalence of the HOXB13 G84E variant to date and is the first in the UK population. We genotyped 8652 men diagnosed with PrCa within the UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study (UKGPCS) and 5252 healthy men from the UK ProtecT study.  Results:   HOXB13 G84E was identified in 0.5% of the healthy controls and 1.5% of the PrCa cases, and it was associated with a 2.93-fold increased risk of PrCa [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94-4.59; P = 6.27 × 10(-8)]. The risk was even higher among men with family history of PrCa [odds ratio (OR) = 4.53, 95% CI 2.86-7.34; P = 3.1 × 10(-8)] and in young-onset PrCa (diagnosed up to the age of 55 years; OR = 3.11, 95% CI 1.98-5.00; P = 6.1 × 10(-7)). There was no significant association between Gleason Score, presenting prostate specific antigen, tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage or NCCN risk group and carrier status. HOXB13 G84E was not associated with overall or cancer-specific survival. We found that the polygenic PrCa risk score (PR score), calculated using the 71 known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PrCa and the HOXB13 G84E variant act multiplicatively on PrCa risk. Based on the estimated prevalence and risk, this rare variant explains ∼1% of the familial risk of PrCa in the UK population.  Conclusions:   The clinical importance of HOXB13 G84E in PrCa management has not been established.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of CTC enumeration with clinical disease characteristics and overall survival in men with mCRPC at our institution.  Design:   CTCs were enumerated using the CellSearch method in a prospective correlative study in men with mCRPC starting a new systemic therapy. The primary objective was to determine the clinical phenotype of the subset of men with mCRPC who have a poor prognosis and low CTCs. Secondary end points included associations of CTCs with survival and known prognostic biomarkers, before therapy and at progression.  Results:   At baseline, median CTC count was 16 cells and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 178 ng/ml. At progression, median CTC count was 42, PSA level was 245 ng/ml, levels of lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase rose, and level of hemoglobin dropped.

Multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed independent predictors for postoperative aggressive pathological features (i.e., a pathological Gleason score [GS] ≥ 7, extracapsular extension [ECE], seminal vesicle invasion [SVI], and positive surgical margins [PSM]) and GS upgrading.

Significantly higher rates of pathological GS ≥ 7 were observed in groups with a low TT level (46.3% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.01), low BT level (44.3% vs. 33.1%; P<0.001), and low FT level (46.8% vs. 32.9%; P = 0.001). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that only low BT and FT levels were independent predictors of pathological GS ≥ 7 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.76; P<0.001 and OR = 1.39; P<0.001, respectively) and GS upgrading (OR = 2.82; P<0.001 and OR = 1.71; P<0.001, respectively), but there was no significant correlation between low circulating testosterone levels and ECE, SVI, or PSM. Furthermore, BMI (OR = 1.28; P = 0.04) and MetS (OR = 1.19; P = 0.01) were only correlated with PSM.  Conclusion:   Hypogonadism, obesity, and MetS were not independent predictors of pathological GS ≥ 7, ECE, or SVI after RP. Our data suggest that only low BT and FT levels, which might logically result in an active androgen-depleted environment, were linked with high-grade PCa.""","""['Priscilla Léon', 'Thomas Seisen', 'Olivier Cussenot', 'Sarah J Drouin', 'Susanna Cattarino', 'Eva Compérat', 'Raphaële Renard-Penna', 'Pierre Mozer', 'Marc-Olivier Bitker', 'Morgan Rouprêt']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Preoperative hypogonadism is not an independent predictor of high-risk disease in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Obesity and hypogonadism are associated with an increased risk of predominant Gleason 4 pattern on radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Preoperative low serum testosterone is associated with high-grade prostate cancer and an increased Gleason score upgrading.', 'Meta-analysis of metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'Influence of plasmatic testosterone during natural history of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Low serum total testosterone level as a predictor of upgrading in low-risk prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Dietary tomato inhibits angiogenesis in TRAMP prostate cancer but is not protective with a Western-style diet in this pilot study.', 'Luteinizing Hormone Levels Relate to the Unfavorable Pathology of Prostate Cancer.', 'Hypogonadism and prostate cancer detection on multiparametric MRI and mpMRI-TRUS fusion biopsy.', 'The accumulation of metabolic syndrome components is associated with higher risk of positive surgical margin among patients with localized prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Of the 16 patients, 4 received a total dose of 7800 cGy to the prostate alone, 7 received 8000 cGy to the prostate alone, and 5 received 8000 cGy to the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes. The mean (range) of testicular dose with an IMRT plan was 54.7 cGy (21.1 to 91.9) and 59.0 cGy (25.1 to 93.4) with a VMAT plan. In 12 cases, the mean VMAT dose was higher than the mean IMRT dose, with a mean difference of 4.3 cGy (p = 0.019).

This study aimed to identify approaches to empowering African American men as proactive participants in prostate cancer decision making using an established community-campus partnership employing elements of community-based participatory research methods. Community stakeholders with an interest in, and knowledge about, health care in two local African American communities were recruited and completed key informant interviews (N = 39). Grounded theory coding identified common themes related to prostate cancer knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and responses to them. Common barriers such as gender roles, fear, and fatalism were identified as barriers to work-up and treatment, and both communities' inadequate and inaccurate prostate cancer information described as the key problem. To build on community strengths, participants said the change must come from inside these communities, not be imposed from the outside. To accomplish this, they suggested reaching men through women, connecting men to doctors they can trust, making men's cancer education part of broader health education initiatives designed as fun and inexpensive family entertainment events, and having churches bring community members in to speak on their experiences with cancer. This study demonstrated the success of community engagement to identify not only barriers but also local strengths and facilitators to prostate cancer care in two suburban/rural African American communities.

UPR induces several molecular chaperones including heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), which corrects protein misfolding and improves survival of cancer cells and resistance to tumoricidal therapy although prolonged activation of UPR induces cell death. The HSP90 inhibitor, 17AAG, has shown promise against various solid tumors, including prostate cancer (PC). However, therapeutic doses of 17AAG elicit systemic toxicity. In this manuscript, we describe a new paradigm where the combination therapy of a non-ablative and non-invasive low energy focused ultrasound (LOFU) and a non-toxic, low dose 17AAG causes synthetic lethality and significant tumoricidal effects in mouse and human PC xenografts. LOFU induces ER stress and UPR in tumor cells without inducing cell death. Treatment with a non-toxic dose of 17AAG further increased ER stress in LOFU treated PC and switch UPR from a cytoprotective to an apoptotic response in tumors resulting significant induction of apoptosis and tumor growth retardation. These observations suggest that LOFU-induced ER stress makes the ultrasound-treated tumors more susceptible to chemotherapeutic agents, such as 17AAG. Thus, a novel therapy of LOFU-induced chemosensitization may be designed for locally advanced and recurrent tumors.""","""['Subhrajit Saha', 'Payel Bhanja', 'Ari Partanen', 'Wei Zhang', 'Laibin Liu', 'Wolfgang Tomé', 'Chandan Guha']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncoscience""","""['Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LOFU)-mediated Acoustic Immune Priming and Ablative Radiation Therapy for in situ Tumor Vaccines.', 'Intratumor injection of the Hsp90 inhibitor 17AAG decreases tumor growth and induces apoptosis in a prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Protein kinase CK2 protects multiple myeloma cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis and from the cytotoxic effect of HSP90 inhibition through regulation of the unfolded protein response.', 'Role of the unfolded protein response in determining the fate of tumor cells and the promise of multi-targeted therapies.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response in gliomagenesis, tumor progression and as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma.', 'Functional micro/nanobubbles for ultrasound medicine and visualizable guidance.', 'Focused Ultrasound for Immunomodulation of the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Antitumorigenic Effect of Hsp90 Inhibitor SNX-2112 on Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma is Enhanced by Low-Intensity Ultrasound.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Pathway, the Unfolded Protein Response, Modulates Immune Function in the Tumor Microenvironment to Impact Tumor Progression and Therapeutic Response.', 'Auranofin Protects Intestine against Radiation Injury by Modulating p53/p21 Pathway and Radiosensitizes Human Colon Tumor.']"""

We assessed the association between ERG rearrangement status and clinical benefit from abiraterone acetate.  Experimental design:   COU-AA-302 is a phase III trial comparing abiraterone acetate and prednisone versus prednisone in chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. ERG status was evaluated by FISH on archival tumors. End points included radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), time to PSA progression (TTPP), rate of ≥50% PSA decline from baseline, and overall survival (OS). Cox regression was used to evaluate association with time-to-event measures and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel for PSA response.  Results:   ERG status was defined for 348 of 1,088 intention-to-treat patients. ERG was rearranged in 121 of 348 patients with confirmed ERG status (35%). Cancers with an ERG fusion secondary to deletion of 21q22 and increased copy number of fusion sequences (class 2+ Edel) had a greater improvement in rPFS after abiraterone acetate and prednisone [22 vs. 5.4 months; HR (95% confidence interval, CI), 0.31 (0.15-0.68); P = 0.0033] than cancers with no ERG fusion [16.7 vs. 8.3 months; 0.53 (0.38-0.74); P = 0.0002] or other classes of ERG rearrangement.

The current study reports the mechanism of cytotoxicity of citrus-derived obacunone and OG on human androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells. Both limonoids exhibited time- and dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation, with more than 60% inhibition of cell viability at 100 μM, after 24 and 48 h. Analysis of fragmentation of DNA, activity of caspase-3, and cytosolic cytochrome-c in the cells treated with limonoids provided evidence for activation of programmed cell death by limonoids. Treatment of LNCaP cells with obacunone and OG resulted in dose-dependent changes in expression of proteins responsible for the induction of programmed cell death through the intrinsic pathway and down-regulation of Akt, a key molecule in cell signaling pathways. In addition, obacunone and OG also negatively regulated an inflammation-associated transcription factor, androgen receptor, and prostate-specific antigen, and activated proteins related to the cell cycle, confirming the ability of limonoids to induce cytotoxicity through multiple pathways.

However, classic genetic CaP engineering in mouse makes this a daunting task because generation, breeding based combination of alterations and non-invasive monitoring of disease are too time consuming and costly. To address the unmet need, we recently developed RapidCaP mice, which endogenously recreate human PTEN-mutant metastatic CaP based on Cre/Luciferase expressing viral infection, that is guided to Pten(loxP)/Trp53(loxP) prostate. Here we use a sensitized, non-metastatic Pten/Trp53-mutant RapidCaP system for functional validation of human metastasis drivers in a much accelerated time frame of only 3-4months. We used in vivo RNAi to target three candidate tumor suppressor genes FOXP1, RYBP and SHQ1, which reside in a frequent deletion on chromosome 3p and show that Shq1 cooperates with Pten and p53 to suppress metastasis.

Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia, and circulating insulin and C-peptide, a biomarker of insulin levels, have been positively associated with colorectal cancer risk. However, whether a similar relationship exists for colorectal adenomas, an established colorectal cancer precursor, is unclear.  Methods:   In a nested case-control study of 273 colorectal adenoma cases and 355 matched controls from the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, serum C-peptide levels were measured by a chemiluminescent immunometric assay. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal adenoma within quartiles of C-peptide. Further, to explore the temporal stability of C-peptide, repeat samples from the incident adenoma cases (n=50) and controls (n=30), over a 5-year period were assayed and the intra-class correlations (ICC) estimated.  Results:   In a multivariable model that included established colorectal adenoma risk factors, C-peptide levels were not associated with colorectal adenoma (Q4 vs. Q1, OR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.52-1.31; P-trend 0.32); similar null associations were observed by gender, by adenoma subsite and for advanced adenomas. Among control participants, the ICC value over a 5-year period was 0.66.

Usually, men with metastatic disease will progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We aimed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tumor samples from non-castrated and castrated men from LNCaP Orthotopic xenograft models of prostate cancer and to study the mechanisms of CRPC.  Material/methods:   In this work, GSE46218 containing 4 samples from non-castrated men and 4 samples from castrated men was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. We identified DEGs using limma Geoquery in R, the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) method in Bioconductor, and Bias methods, followed by constructing an integrated regulatory network involving DEGs, miRNAs, and TFs using Cytoscape. Then, we analyzed network motifs of the integrated gene regulatory network using FANMOD. We selected regulatory modules corresponding to network motifs from the integrated regulatory network by Perl script. We preformed gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in the regulatory modules using DAVID.  Results:   We identified total 443 DEGs. We built an integrated regulatory network, found three motifs (motif 1, motif 2 and motif 3), and got two function modules (module 1 corresponded to motif 1, and module 2 corresponded to motif 2). Several GO terms (such as regulation of cell proliferation, positive regulation of macromolecule metabolic process, phosphorylation, and phosphorus metabolic process) and two pathways (pathway in cancer and Melanoma) were enriched. Furthermore, some significant DEGs (such as CAV1, LYN, FGFR3 and FGFR3) were related to CPRC development.

The principal treatment for PCa is androgen deprivation therapy, although the majority of patients eventually develop a lethal castrate-resistant form of the disease, where despite low serum testosterone levels AR signalling persists. Advanced PCa often has hyper-activated RAS/ERK1/2 signalling thought to be due to loss of function of key negative regulators of the pathway, the details of which are not fully understood.  Methods:   We recently carried out a genome-wide study and identified a subset of 226 novel androgen-regulated genes (PLOS ONE 6:e29088, 2011). In this study we have meta-analysed this dataset with genes and pathways frequently mutated in PCa to identify androgen-responsive regulators of the RAS/ERK1/2 pathway.  Results:   We find the PTGER4 and TSPYL2 genes are up-regulated by androgen stimulation and the ADCY1, OPKR1, TRIB1, SPRY1 and PTPRR are down-regulated by androgens. Further characterisation of PTPRR protein in LNCaP cells revealed it is an early and direct target of the androgen receptor which negatively regulates the RAS/ERK1/2 pathway and reduces cell proliferation in response to androgens.

In patients with hip replacements or a previously irradiated hip, this arrangement is contraindicated. The use of non-lateral beams is possible, but not well described. Here we report a multi-institutional experience for patients treated with at least one non-lateral proton beam for prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   Between 2010 and 2014, 20 patients with organ-confined prostate cancer and a history of hip prosthesis underwent proton therapy utilizing at least one anterior oblique beam (defined as between 10° and 85° from vertical) at one of three proton centers.  Results:   The median follow-up was 6.4 months. No patients have developed PSA failure or distant metastases. The median planning target volume (PTV) D95 was 79.2 Gy (RBE) (range 69.7-79.9).

Material and methods:   In 15 patients with localized prostate cancer, prostate volumes and dominant intra-prostatic lesions were delineated on pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delineations and MRI were registered to trans-rectal ultrasound images in the operating theater. The patients received CLDR-BT treatment to the total prostate volume. The implantation consisted of two parts: an experimental focal plan covering the dominant intra-prostatic lesion (F-GTV), followed by a plan containing additional seeds to achieve entire prostate coverage. Isodose surfaces were reconstructed using follow-up computed tomography (CT). The focal dose was emulated by reconstructing seeds from the focal plan only. The distance to agreement between planned and delivered isodose surfaces and F-GTV coverage was determined to calculate the margin required for robust treatment.  Results:   If patients had been treated only focally, the target volume would have been reduced from an average of 40.9 cm3 for the entire prostate to 5.8 cm3 for the focal plan. The D90 for the F-GTV in the focal plan was 195±60 Gy, the V100 was 94% [range 71-100%]. The maximum distance (cd95) between the planned and delivered isodose contours was 0.48 cm.

Cycloartan-24-ene-1α,2α,3β-triol (MY-1) was isolated from Commiphora myrrha, and its structure was determined through 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

MY-1 showed cytotoxic activity on PC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 9.6 µM at 24 h. MY-1 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that MY-1 regulated the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), p53 and caspase-3 in the PC-3 cells.

Here, human PAP-specific aptamers were screened from a 2'-fluoropyrimidine (FY)-modified RNA library by SELEX. The candidate aptamer families were identified within six rounds followed by analysis of their sequences and PAP-specific binding. A gel shift assay was used to identify PAP binding aptamers and the 6N aptamer specifically bound to PAP with a Kd value of 118 nM. RT-PCR and fluorescence labeling analyses revealed that the 6N aptamer bound to PAP-positive mammalian cells, such as PC-3 and LNCaP. IMR-90 negative control cells did not bind the 6N aptamer. Systematic minimization analyses revealed that 50 nucleotide sequences and their two hairpin structures in the 6N 2'-FY RNA aptamer were equally important for PAP binding.

Our aim in this pilot study was to explore feasibility of simultaneous PET/MRI to guide localization of prostate lesions for dynamic FDG analysis using a graphical approach.  Methods:   Three patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent simultaneous FDG PET/MRI, incorporating dynamic prostate imaging. Histology and multiparametric MRI findings were used to localize tumors, which in turn guided identification of tumors on FDG images. Regions of interest were manually placed on tumor and benign prostate tissue. Blood activity was extracted from a region of interest placed on the femoral artery on PET images. FDG data were analyzed by graphical analysis using the influx constant Ki (Patlak analysis) when FDG binding seemed irreversible and distribution volume VT (reversible graphical analysis) when FDG binding seemed reversible given the presence of washout.  Results:   Given inherent coregistration, simultaneous acquisition facilitated use of MRI data to localize small lesions on PET and subsequent graphical analysis in all cases. In 2 cases with irreversible binding, tumor had higher Ki than benign using Patlak analysis (0.023 vs 0.006 and 0.019 vs 0.008 mL/cm3 per minute). In 1 case appearing reversible, tumor had higher VT than benign using reversible graphical analysis (0.68 vs 0.52 mL/cm3).

The human cancer cell lines, such as hepatic (Hep-G2), colon (Caco-2), prostate (PC-3), and breast (MCF-7), were propagated at 37°C; air/CO2 (95:5 v/v) using the ATCC-formulated RPMI-1640 Medium and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), while the mouse macrophage cell line (TIB-71) was propagated at 37°C; air/CO2 (95:5 v/v) using the ATCC-formulated DMEM and 10% FBS. All cells were plated at a density of ∼5000 cells/well. After overnight incubation, the cells were treated with 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μg/mL of CGE an additional 72 h. Inhibition of cell proliferation of 80-90% was observed for Hep-G2, MCF-7, TIB-71, and PC-3 cells, but only 40-55% for the Caco-2 cells when treated with 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μg/mL. In a coculture study of Caco-2 and TIB-71 cells, inhibition of cell proliferation of 90% was observed for Caco-2 cells compared to the 40-55% when cultured separately.

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage are drivers of AKI-associated pathology; however, the pathways that mediate these events are poorly defined.

Treatment with the AMPK agonist AICAR or the antioxidant agent acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR) restored SIRT3 expression and activity, improved renal function, and decreased tubular injury in WT animals, but had no effect in Sirt3-/- mice. Moreover, Sirt3-deficient mice given cisplatin experienced more severe AKI than WT animals and died, and neither AICAR nor ALCAR treatment prevented death in Sirt3-/- AKI mice. In cultured human tubular cells, cisplatin reduced SIRT3, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation, while restoration of SIRT3 with AICAR and ALCAR improved cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

Design:   This was a phase 3 study with 2 treatment periods: a previously reported 12-month double-blind, placebo-controlled phase and a 12-month open-label phase.  Setting:   This was a multicenter study conducted in North America and Europe.  Participants:   A total of 228 men entered the open-label phase and 219 completed the study.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective study on 1525 patients who underwent prostate needle biopsy (PB) over a period of four years (2009-2012) was performed. For each patient the following were analyzed: age, prostate volume, digital rectal examination (DRE), serum total prostate specific antigen (tPSA), number of the cores taken. All PB were examined in HE staining and in difficult cases, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for basal cell markers was performed in order to establish a correct diagnosis. According to morphological criteria and IHC results, all PB were classified into four category of diagnosis: PCa, ASAP, high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and benign (including normal tissue, inflammatory lesions, and prostatic atrophy). In ASAP cases, a rebiopsy was performed.  Results:   PCa detection on the first biopsy was 69.77%, with a 3% incidence of ASAP and 1% of HGPIN, values similar with those in the literature. After rebiopsy the overall detection rate of PCa was improved to 71.01%, with a detection rate of 41.17% on the second biopsy.  Conclusions:   PCa diagnosis is the result of a complex algorithm including DRE, tPSA, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) examination and TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.

Despite this early effect, advanced prostate cancer is resilient to such treatment. Recent evidence shows that derivatives of Cannabis sativa and its analogs may exert a protective effect against different types of oncologic pathologies. The purpose of the present study was to detect the presence of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) on cancer cells with a prostatic origin and to evaluate the effect of the in vitro use of synthetic analogs. In order to do this, we used a commercial cell line and primary cultures derived from prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The presence of the CB1 and CB2 receptors was determined by immunohistochemistry where we showed a higher expression of these receptors in later stages of the disease (samples with a high Gleason score). Later, treatments were conducted using anandamide, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol and a synthetic analog of anandamide, methanandamide. Using the MTT assay, we proved that the treatments produced a cell growth inhibitory effect on all the different prostate cancer cultures. This effect was demonstrated to be dose-dependent. The use of a specific CB1 receptor blocker (SR141716) confirmed that this effect was produced primarily from the activation of the CB1 receptor. In order to understand the MTT assay results, we determined cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry, which showed no variation at the different cell cycle stages in all the cultures after treatment. Treatment with endocannabinoids resulted in an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells as determined by Annexin V assays and caused an increase in the levels of activated caspase-3 and a reduction in the levels of Bcl-2 confirming that the reduction in cell viability noted in the MTT assay was caused by the activation of the apoptotic pathway. Finally, we observed that endocannabinoid treatment activated the Erk pathway and at the same time, produced a decrease in the activation levels of the Akt pathway. Based on these results, we suggest that endocannabinoids may be a beneficial option for the treatment of prostate cancer that has become nonresponsive to common therapies.""","""['O Orellana-Serradell', 'C E Poblete', 'C Sanchez', 'E A Castellón', 'I Gallegos', 'C Huidobro', 'M N Llanos', 'H R Contreras']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Anandamide inhibits the growth of colorectal cancer cells through CB1 and lipid rafts.', 'Suppression of nerve growth factor Trk receptors and prolactin receptors by endocannabinoids leads to inhibition of human breast and prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'Synthetic and endogenous cannabinoids protect retinal neurons from AMPA excitotoxicity in\xa0vivo, via activation of CB1 receptors: Involvement of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling pathways.', 'The endocannabinoid-CB receptor system: Importance for development and in pediatric disease.', 'The endocannabinoid system: a new target for the regulation of energy balance and metabolism.', 'Could cannabinoids provide a new hope for ovarian cancer patients?', 'Cannabidiol and Cannabis Sativa as a potential treatment in vitro prostate cancer cells silenced with RBBp6 and PC3 xenograft.', ""The Plant Derived 3-3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) Behaves as CB2 Receptor Agonist in Prostate Cancer Cellular Models."", 'The Effect of Cannabis Plant Extracts on Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma and the Quest for Cannabis-Based Personalized Therapy.', 'Cannabinoids as Prospective Anti-Cancer Drugs: Mechanism of Action in Healthy and Cancer Cells.']"""

Multiplex immunostaining of CTNNB1, its putative transcriptional target gene lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1), and the epithelial marker E-cadherin were examined in clinical human prostate specimens with or without histological BPH (pure epithelial or mixed stromal-epithelial nodules). BPH specimens were obtained from 24 men who experienced LUTS and underwent transurethral resection of the prostate surgery. Control specimens were tumor-adjacent histologically normal prostate tissue from 48 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. The resulting multispectral images were unmixed and optical densities recorded to quantify staining abundance, cellular (membranous, cytoplasmic, and nuclear) and tissue localization (stromal versus epithelial), and determination of percentage of CTNNB1-positive cells. The following CTNNB1 indices were significantly higher in BPH compared to normal prostate tissue: overall staining intensity, staining intensity in prostate stromal cell membranes, cytoplasm and nuclei, and prostate epithelial cell nuclei. The following LEF1 indices were significantly lower in BPH compared to tumor-adjacent normal prostate tissue: stromal LEF1 staining intensity, percentage of LEF1-positive stromal cells, and intensity of LEF1 staining in stromal cell membranes, cytoplasm, and nuclei. The percentage of stromal cells with CTNNB1(+)/LEF1(-) nuclei was higher and percentage of stromal cells with CTNNB1(-)/LEF1(+) nuclei was lower in BPH compared to tumor-adjacent normal prostate tissues. These results support the hypothesis that CTNNB1 expression increases in specific BPH tissue compartments. Further, since nuclear LEF1 staining does not coincide with cytoplasmic or nuclear CTNNB1 staining, it does not appear to be a reliable index of CTNNB1 activity in adult human prostate.""","""['Tyler M Bauman', 'Chad M Vezina', 'Wei Huang', 'Paul C Marker', 'Richard E Peterson', 'William A Ricke']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Clin Exp Urol""","""['Expression and colocalization of β-catenin and lymphoid enhancing factor-1 in prostate cancer progression.', 'Sex steroid receptor expression and localization in benign prostatic hyperplasia varies with tissue compartment.', 'Prostatic osteopontin expression is associated with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The influence of asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis on the onset and progression of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with histologic benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Comprehensive patient evaluation for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Genetic background but not prostatic epithelial beta-catenin influences susceptibility of male mice to testosterone and estradiol-induced urinary dysfunction.', 'Hyperspectral and multispectral imaging in digital and computational pathology: a systematic review Invited.', 'Single-Cell Analysis Identifies LY6D as a Marker Linking Castration-Resistant Prostate Luminal Cells to Prostate Progenitors and Cancer.', 'Fluorescence of Picrosirius Red Multiplexed With Immunohistochemistry for the Quantitative Assessment of Collagen in Tissue Sections.', 'Quantitation of Protein Expression and Co-localization Using Multiplexed Immuno-histochemical Staining and Multispectral Imaging.']"""

MAA causes embryo malformation and spermatocyte death through inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Little is known about MAA's effects on cancer cells. In this study, two immortalized human normal prostatic epithelial cell lines (RWPE-1 and pRNS-1-1) and four human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2B, PC-3, and DU-145) were treated with MAA at different doses and for different time periods. Cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle analysis were performed using flow cytometry and chemical assays. Gene expression and binding to DNA were assessed using real-time PCR, Western blot, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses. We found that MAA dose-dependently inhibited prostate cancer cell growth through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. MAA-induced apoptosis was due to down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic gene baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat containing 2 (BIRC2, also named cIAP1), leading to activation of caspases 7 and 3 and turning on the downstream apoptotic events. MAA-induced cell cycle arrest (mainly G1 arrest) was due to up-regulation of p21 expression at the early time and down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK2 expression at the late time. MAA up-regulated p21 expression through inhibition of HDAC activities, independently of p53/p63/p73. These findings demonstrate that MAA suppresses prostate cancer cell growth by inducing growth arrest and apoptosis, which suggests that MAA could be used as a potential therapeutic drug for prostate cancer.""","""['Keshab R Parajuli', 'Qiuyang Zhang', 'Sen Liu', 'Neil K Patel', 'Hua Lu', 'Shelya X Zeng', 'Guangdi Wang', 'Changde Zhang', 'Zongbing You']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Clin Exp Urol""","""['Total triterpenoids from Ganoderma Lucidum suppresses prostate cancer cell growth by inducing growth arrest and apoptosis.', 'Aminomethylphosphonic acid and methoxyacetic acid induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'SRJ23, a new semisynthetic andrographolide derivative: in vitro growth inhibition and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) induced cell growth inhibition, G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Growth of human prostate cancer cells is significantly suppressed in vitro with sodium butyrate through apoptosis.', 'Bioinformatics Prediction and Analysis of MicroRNAs and Their Targets as Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer: A Preliminary Study.', 'Total triterpenoids from Ganoderma Lucidum suppresses prostate cancer cell growth by inducing growth arrest and apoptosis.', 'Aminomethylphosphonic acid and methoxyacetic acid induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.']"""

We performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between CXCR4 expression and the clinicopathological features of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Data were collected from studies comparing Gleason score, T stage, and the presence of metastasis with CXCR4 levels in human prostate cancer samples. The studies were pooled, and the odds ratio (OR) of CXCR4 expression for clinical and pathological variables was calculated.  Results:   Five articles were eligible for the current meta-analysis. We found no relationship between CXCR4 expression and Gleason score (<7 vs. ≥7). The forest plot using the fixed-effects model indicated an OR of 1.585 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.793~3.171; p=0.193). Further, CXCR4 expression was not associated with the T stage (<T3 vs. ≥T3), and the relevant meta-analysis showed OR=1.803 (95% CI: 0.756~4.297, p=0.183). However, increased CXCR4 expression was strongly associated with metastatic disease with a fixed-effects pooled OR of 7.459 (95% CI: 2.665~20.878, p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Our meta-analysis showed that the higher CXCR4 protein expression in prostate cancer specimens is significantly associated with the presence of metastatic disease.

Structural modeling followed by functional analyses further revealed that phenylalanine-rich α1-helix in endostatin-which shares structural similarity with noncanonical nuclear receptor box in AR-antagonizes AR transcriptional activity by occupying the activation function (AF)-2 binding interface for coactivators and N-terminal AR AF-1. Together, our data suggest that endostatin can be recognized as an endogenous AR inhibitor that impairs receptor function through protein-protein interaction.

Methods:   Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWIs) for 31 patients with PCa (65.2 ± 7.1 years) were obtained pre-operatively at different b-values (0, 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 s mm(-2)) on a 3-T MRI. cDWIs at b = 2000 were generated by using six b-value combinations: 0-100 s mm(-2) (cDWI0-100); 0-500 s mm(-2) (cDWI0-500); 100-500 s mm(-2) (cDWI100-500); 0-1000 s mm(-2) (cDWI0-1000); 100-1000 s mm(-2) (cDWI100-1000); and 500-1000 s mm(-2) (cDWI500-1000). These cDWIs and measured DWIs with b = 2000 s mm(-2) (mDWI2000) were evaluated in this setting. To assess image quality for each DWI, contrast ratios (CRs) of cancerous and non-cancerous lesions were evaluated. To compare the detectability of PCa for each DWI, receiver operating characteristic analysis was used.  Results:   CRs of all cDWIs were significantly higher than those of mDWI2000 (p < 0.05). Areas under the curve of cDWI0-100 (0.62) and cDWI0-500 (0.65) were significantly smaller (p < 0.05) than those of others (cDWI100-500, 0.72; cDWI0-1000, 0.73; cDWI100-1000, 0.71; cDWI500-1000, 0.74; mDWI2000, 0.72).

In human carcinoma cells, overexpression of brachyury associates with the occurrence of the phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), acquisition of metastatic propensity and resistance to a variety of anti-cancer therapeutics. Brachyury is preferentially expressed in human tumors vs. normal adult tissues, and high levels of this molecule associate with poor prognosis in patients with lung, colon and prostate carcinomas, and in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. Brachyury is immunogenic in humans and vaccines against this novel oncotarget are currently undergoing clinical investigation. While our group and others have employed various anti-brachyury antibodies to interrogate the above findings, we report here on the development and thorough characterization of a novel rabbit monoclonal antibody (MAb 54-1) that reacts with distinct high affinity and specificity with human brachyury. MAb 54-1 was successfully used in ELISA, western blot, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays to evaluate expression of brachyury in various human tumor cell lines and tissues.

Interrogation of human data revealed that increased Top2a expression in primary tumors selected patients with more aggressive disease. Further, significant positive correlation was observed between Top2a and the histone methyltransferase, Ezh2. Combination of the Top2 poison etoposide with the Ezh2 inhibitor GSK126 or DZNep significantly increased cell death in vitro in murine and human prostate cancer cell lines. Additionally, combination therapy extended time to progression and increased therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Overall, our studies demonstrate that patients screened for Top2a and Ezh2 expression would exhibit significant response to a combinational treatment involving low dose etoposide combined with Ezh2 inhibition.

Their antitumor efficacy, when used as single agents, is limited. Oncolytic adenoviruses have low infection activity, and cancer cells develop resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here, we explored combining prostate-restricted replication competent adenovirus-mediated TRAIL (PRRA-TRAIL) with lovastatin, a commonly used cholesterol-lowering drug, as a potential therapy for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Lovastatin significantly enhanced the efficacy of PRRA-TRAIL by promoting the in vivo tumor suppression, and the in vitro cell killing and apoptosis induction, via integration of multiple molecular mechanisms. Lovastatin enhanced PRRA replication and virus-delivered transgene expression by increasing the expression levels of CAR and integrins, which are critical for adenovirus 5 binding and internalization. Lovastatin enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis by increasing death receptor DR4 expression. These multiple effects of lovastatin on CAR, integrins and DR4 expression were closely associated with cholesterol-depletion in lipid rafts. These studies, for the first time, show correlations between cholesterol/lipid rafts, oncolytic adenovirus infection efficiency and the antitumor efficacy of TRAIL at the cellular level.

Methods:   A total of 16 patients with 18 isolated lymph nodes with recurrent prostate cancer were treated between 2008 and 2013. All patients underwent [(11)C] choline-positron emission tomography/computed tomography before SBRT. Two patients were treated in different sessions for metachronous metastases. Ten patients received androgen deprivation therapy concomitant to SBRT (total dose range, 12-35 Gy, delivered in 1-5 daily fractions).  Results:   The mean and median follow-up periods were 29.35 and 29.38 months, respectively (range, 6.3-68.8 months). Local disease control and a decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen were obtained in 15 of 16 patients (94%); only 1 patient had an in-field progression. In the 6 patients without androgen deprivation therapy at the time of SBRT, the mean time of deferment of palliative androgen deprivation therapy was 23.7 months (range, 2.5-51 months). At last follow-up, 8 patients had active prostate cancer disease; biochemical progression was observed after a mean time of 7.9 months from the completion of SBRT. One patient died of disease. Overall survival was 94%. The 2-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 44%. Late toxicity (gastrointestinal) was observed in 1 patient who had a G3 toxicity.

Mortality was calculated using competing risk regression analyses, taking into account PCa risk category, age and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI).  Results:   In men with low-risk PCa, all-cause mortality was lower compared with that in corresponding PCa-free men: 10-year all-cause mortality was 18% for men diagnosed at age 70 years, with a CCI score of 0, and 21% among corresponding control subjects. Of these cases, 31% died from cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with 37% of the corresponding control subjects. For men with low-risk PCa, 10-year PCa-mortality was 0.4, 1 and 3% when diagnosed at age 50, 60 and 70 years, respectively. PCa was the third most common cause of death (18%), after CVD (31%) and other cancers (30%). By contrast, PCa was the most common cause of death in men with intermediate- and high-risk localized PCa.  Conclusions:   Men with low-risk PCa had lower all-cause mortality than PCa-free men because of lower CVD mortality, driven by early detection selection; however, for men with intermediate- or high-risk disease, the rate of PCa death was substantial, irrespective of CCI score, and this was even more pronounced for those diagnosed at age 50 or 60 years.""","""['Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'Yasin Folkvaljon', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Olof Akre', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Hans Garmo', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Long-term outcomes among noncuratively treated men according to prostate cancer risk category in a nationwide, population-based study.', 'Mortality among men with locally advanced prostate cancer managed with noncurative intent: a nationwide study in PCBaSe Sweden.', 'Treatment with curative intent and survival in men with high-risk prostate cancer.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are believed to have considerable therapeutic potential due to their role in regulating gene expression and cellular pathways. Identifying miRNAs that efficiently target genes and pathways is a key step in using these molecules for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, computational methods have been devised to help identify candidate miRNAs for each gene/pathway. MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways are known to have essential roles in cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation in different cancers including prostate cancer. Herein, we tried to identify miRNAs that target these pathways in the context of prostate cancer as therapeutic molecules. Genes involved in these pathways were analyzed with various algorithms to identify potentially targeting miRNAs. miR-23a and miR-23b were then selected as the best potential candidates that target a higher number of genes in these pathways with greater predictive scores. We then analyzed the expression of candidate miRNAs in LNCAP and PC3 cell lines as well as prostate cancer clinical samples. miR-23a and miR-23b showed a significant downregulation in cell line and tissue samples, a finding which is consistent with overactivation of these pathways in prostate cancer. In addition, we overexpressed miR-23a and miR-23b in LNCAP and PC3 cell lines, and these two miRNAs decreased IL-6R expression which has a critical role in these pathways.

However, the mechanism of action is not fully understood. Our laboratory previously showed that EGCG inhibits heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). We used nontumorigenic (NT), tumorigenic, and metastatic cancer cells from a novel human prostate cancer progression model to test the hypotheses that certain stages are more or less sensitive to EGCG and that sensitivity is related to HSP90 inhibition. Treatment of cells with EGCG, novobiocin, or 17-AAG resulted in more potent cytotoxic effects on tumorigenic and metastatic cells than NT cells. When tumorigenic or metastatic cells were grown in vivo, mice supplemented with 0.06% EGCG in drinking water developed significantly smaller tumors than untreated mice. Furthermore, EGCG prevented malignant transformation in vivo using the full prostate cancer model. To elucidate the mechanism of EGCG action, we performed binding assays with EGCG-Sepharose, a C-terminal HSP90 antibody, and HSP90 mutants. These experiments revealed that EGCG-Sepharose bound more HSP90 from metastatic cells compared with NT cells and binding occurred through the HSP90 C-terminus. In addition, EGCG bound HSP90 mutants that mimic both complexed and uncomplexed HSP90. Consistent with HSP90 inhibitory activity, EGCG, novobiocin, and 17-AAG induced changes in HSP90-client proteins in NT cells and larger differences in metastatic cells.

Support from a relationship partner can ameliorate psychological distress, but many studies treat relationship status as a dichotomous predictor without accounting for level of support provided by the partner.  Methods:   The current study is a secondary analysis of a sample of 292 prostate cancer survivors recruited by nine Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) sites around the USA to a larger randomized controlled trial. Self-reported distress was measured at a baseline visit using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and partner support was measured using the Social Network and Support Assessment (SNSA). Post hoc groups consisting of unmarried survivors, married survivors with low partner support (SNSA scores below the median), and married survivors with high partner support (SNSA scores above the median) were compared on distress using univariate and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyses.  Results:   Married prostate cancer survivors with high partner support reported significantly lower levels of psychological distress than the other two groups on the total distress scale (16.20-19.19 points lower, p < 0.001). After adjusting for multiple comparisons, this pattern was also seen for subscales of distress.  Conclusions:   This study highlights the importance of assessing both partner support and marital status when evaluating a survivor's psychosocial functioning and support network.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Assessing support could improve understanding of the association between partner support and prostate cancer survivors' psychological distress and could lead to interventions to bolster support and reduce distress.""","""['Charles Kamen', 'Karen M Mustian', 'Charles Heckler', 'Michelle C Janelsins', 'Luke J Peppone', 'Supriya Mohile', 'James M McMahon', 'Raymond Lord', 'Patrick J Flynn', 'Matthias Weiss', 'David Spiegel', 'Gary R Morrow']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['Quality of life of couples dealing with cancer: dyadic and individual adjustment among breast and prostate cancer survivors and their spousal caregivers.', 'Levels of fatigue and distress in senior prostate cancer survivors enrolled in a 12-week randomized controlled trial of Qigong.', 'Intolerance of uncertainty, cognitive complaints, and cancer-related distress in prostate cancer survivors.', 'Psychological, social and welfare interventions for psychological health and well-being of torture survivors.', 'A literature review of the social and psychological needs of ovarian cancer survivors.', 'Efficacy in urinary symptom burden, psychological distress, and self-efficacy of education-enhanced interventions in prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analyses.', 'Psychological recovery and well-being of spouses of patients with prostate cancer 5 years after primary treatment in Finland: a follow-up survey.', 'Encouraging Patients to Ask Questions: Development and Pilot Testing of a Question Prompt List for Patients Undergoing a Biopsy for Suspected Prostate Cancer.', 'Marital status and perceived stress in men with advanced prostate cancer: A randomized-controlled trial of cognitive behavioral stress management.', ""Undergoing radical treatment for prostate cancer and its impact on wellbeing: A qualitative study exploring men's experiences.""]"""

Moreover, despite the apparent overlap between FCR and manifestations of some psychiatric disorders, no study has yet evaluated the comorbidity of clinical levels of FCR. The goals of this study were to assess the capacity of the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory severity subscale, to consider a shorter form of the FCRI (FCRI-SF), to screen for clinical levels of FCR, and to assess its psychiatric comorbidity.  Methods:   Sixty French-Canadian cancer survivors (73% of those eligible) who had been treated within the past 4 years for localized breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer were randomly selected. Participants were administered a clinical interview assessing FCR, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and self-report scales.  Results:   A cutoff score of 13 or higher on the FCRI-SF was associated with optimal sensitivity (88%) and specificity (75%) rates for the screening of clinical levels of FCR. Cancer survivors with clinical levels of FCR were significantly more likely to meet the criteria for a current psychiatric disorder (60%) than patients with nonclinical levels (29%). Anxiety disorders tended to be the most common comorbid disorders.

Economic evaluations are an integral component of this necessary research. Ascertainment of reliable health-care cost and quality-of-life estimates to inform such studies has historically been challenging, but recent advances in informatics in the United Kingdom provide new opportunities.  Methods:   The costs of hospital care for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer disease-free survivors were calculated over 15 months from initial diagnosis of cancer using routinely collected data within a UK National Health Service (NHS) Hospital Trust. Costs were linked at patient level to patient-reported outcomes and registry-derived sociodemographic factors. Predictors of cost and the relationship between costs and patient-reported utility were examined.  Results:   The study population included 223 breast cancer patients, 145 colorectal and 104 prostate cancer patients. The mean 15-month cumulative health-care costs were £12 595 (95% CI £11 517-£13 722), £12 643 (£11 282-£14 102) and £3722 (£3263-£4208), per-patient respectively. The majority of costs occurred within the first 6 months from diagnosis. Clinical stage was the most important predictor of costs for all cancer types. EQ-5D score was predictive of costs in colorectal cancer but not in breast or prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   It is now possible to evaluate health-care cost using routine NHS data sets.

Methods:   We interviewed 3713 workers or their next of kin in 2008-2011, and sought medical records for self-reported disease. These workers were a subset of a previously studied cohort of 32,254 community residents and workers. We estimated historical PFOA serum levels via a job-exposure matrix based on over 2000 serum measurements. Non-occupational exposure from drinking water was also estimated. Lifetime serum cumulative dose (combining occupational and non-occupational exposure) was our exposure metric. We studied 17 disease outcomes with more than 20 validated cases.  Results:   The median measured serum level was 113 ng/mL in 2005 (n=1881), compared with 4 ng/mL in the US. Ulcerative colitis (10-year lag) showed a significant trend (p≤0.05) with increasing dose (quartile rate ratios (RRs)=1.00, 3.00, 3.26, 6.57, n=28, p for trend=0.05), similar to earlier findings in the community study. Rheumatoid arthritis (no lag) showed a positive trend in a categorical trend test (RRs=1.00, 2.11, 4.08, 4.45, n=23, p for trend=0.04). Positive non-significant trends were also observed for prostate cancer, non-hepatitis liver disease and male hypothyroidism, which have been implicated in other studies. A significant negative trend was found for bladder cancer and asthma with medication. No marked trends were seen for high cholesterol, which had been seen in the community study.

Here, we present the prespecified final analysis of the trial, assessing the effect of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone on overall survival, time to opiate use, and use of other subsequent therapies.  Methods:   In this placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised phase 3 study, 1088 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naive prostate cancer stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology performance status (0 vs 1) were randomly assigned with a permuted block allocation scheme via a web response system in a 1:1 ratio to receive either abiraterone acetate (1000 mg once daily) plus prednisone (5 mg twice daily; abiraterone acetate group) or placebo plus prednisone (placebo group). Coprimary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival analysed in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00887198.  Findings:   At a median follow-up of 49.2 months (IQR 47.0-51.8), 741 (96%) of the prespecified 773 death events for the final analysis had been observed: 354 (65%) of 546 patients in the abiraterone acetate group and 387 (71%) of 542 in the placebo group. 238 (44%) patients initially receiving prednisone alone subsequently received abiraterone acetate plus prednisone as crossover per protocol (93 patients) or as subsequent therapy (145 patients). Overall, 365 (67%) patients in the abiraterone acetate group and 435 (80%) in the placebo group received subsequent treatment with one or more approved agents. Median overall survival was significantly longer in the abiraterone acetate group than in the placebo group (34.7 months [95% CI 32.7-36.8] vs 30.3 months [28.7-33.3]; hazard ratio 0.81 [95% CI 0.70-0.93]; p=0.0033). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events of special interest were cardiac disorders (41 [8%] of 542 patients in the abiraterone acetate group vs 20 [4%] of 540 patients in the placebo group), increased alanine aminotransferase (32 [6%] vs four [<1%]), and hypertension (25 [5%] vs 17 [3%]).  Interpretation:   In this randomised phase 3 trial with a median follow-up of more than 4 years, treatment with abiraterone acetate prolonged overall survival compared with prednisone alone by a margin that was both clinically and statistically significant.

We used data collected on the baseline questionnaire, as well as results from the baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal examination (DRE), to define prevalent BPH/LUTS-related outcomes as evidence of LUTS (self-reported diagnosis of an enlarged prostate/BPH, BPH surgery or nocturia [waking ≥2 times/night to urinate]) and evidence of prostate enlargement (PSA > 1.4 ng/mL or prostate volume ≥30 mL) in men without prostate cancer. We created a similar definition of incident BPH using data from the follow-up questionnaire completed 5-13 years after enrolment (self-reported diagnosis of an enlarged prostate/BPH or nocturia), data on finasteride use during follow-up, and results from the follow-up PSA tests and DREs.

Of these, 202/652 (30.9%) of the AS patients with very low-/low-risk disease were managed in the public sector, vs 450/652 (69%) of very low-/low-risk AS patients being managed in the private sector. In our cohort, patients with very low- and low-risk disease, managed in a private hospital, were more likely to be on AS (P = 0.005). AS patients in the private sector were also a median of 2.8 years younger (median 65.6 vs 68.4 years, P < 0.001); had a lower median PSA level (5.3 vs 6.7 ng/mL, P < 0.001); and had lower biopsy Gleason score and clinical staging. There was no significant difference in the uptake of AS demographically, in our cohort of men between metropolitan and regional areas.  Conclusion:   In this contemporary registry-based population, AS is being used in a significant proportion of patients. The proportion of men progressing to intervention is lower than that reported in the current literature. Patients are more likely to be on AS if they are managed in a private hospital, with no differences in the uptake of AS, from metropolitan to regional areas.""","""['Mahesha Weerakoon', 'Nathan Papa', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Sue Evans', 'Jeremy Millar', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Damien Bolton', 'Declan G Murphy']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Gleason pattern 4: active surveillance no more.', 'Patterns of care for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Victoria from 2008 to 2011.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'A retrospective analysis of Victorian and South Australian clinical registries for prostate cancer: trends in clinical presentation and management of the disease.', 'Large institutional variations in use of androgen deprivation therapy with definitive radiotherapy in a population-based cohort of men with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Identifying intermediate-risk candidates for active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'Changing nationwide trends away from overtreatment among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy over the past 25\xa0years.', 'Active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer: well established, yet avoided?', 'A Multicenter Single-Arm Objective Performance Criteria Trial to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of High-Frequency Irreversible Electroporation as Primary Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Study Protocol.', 'Active surveillance for prostate cancer: selection criteria, guidelines, and outcomes.', 'Feasibility and early toxicity of focal or partial brachytherapy in prostate cancer patients.']"""

Patients and methods:   Of 6 176 RP patients in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE), 305 patients with high-risk pathological features (margin positivity, Gleason score 8-10, or pT3-4) who underwent postoperative RT were examined, either in the adjuvant (≤6 months after RP with undetectable PSA levels, 76 patients) or salvage setting (>6 months after RP or pre-RT PSA level of >0.1 ng/mL, 229 patients). Early (PSA level of ≤1.0 ng/mL, 180 patients) or late salvage RT (PSA level >1.0 ng/mL, 49 patients) was based on post-RP, pre-RT PSA level. Multivariable Cox regression examined associations with all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality and/or metastases (PCSMM).  Results:   After a median of 74 months after RP, 65 men had died (with 37 events of PCSMM). Adjuvant and salvage RT patients had comparable high-risk features. Compared with adjuvant, salvage RT (early or late) had an increased association with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.7, P = 0.018) and with PCSMM (HR 4.0, P = 0.015). PCSMM-free survival differed by further stratification of timing, with 10-year estimates of 88%, 84%, and 71% for adjuvant, early salvage, and late salvage RT, respectively (P = 0.026). For PCSMM-free survival and OS, compared with adjuvant RT, late salvage RT had statistically significantly increased risk; however, early salvage RT did not.  Conclusion:   This analysis suggests that patients who underwent early salvage RT with PSA levels of <1.0 ng/mL may have comparable metastasis-free survival and OS compared with adjuvant RT; however, late salvage RT with a PSA level of >1.0 ng/mL is associated with worse clinical outcomes.""","""['Charles C Hsu', 'Alan T Paciorek', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Mack Roach rd', 'I-Chow J Hsu', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Postoperative Radiation Therapy for Patients at High-Risk of Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: Does Timing Matter?', 'Does a positive margin always mandate adjuvant radiotherapy?', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Prostate-specific antigen persistence after radical prostatectomy as a predictive factor of clinical relapse-free survival and overall survival: 10-year data of the ARO 96-02 trial.', 'Early salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy.', 'The efficacy of postprostatectomy radiotherapy in patients with an isolated elevation of serum prostate-specific antigen.', 'Sociodemographic and Geographic Disparities of Prostate Cancer Treatment Delay in Tennessee: A Population-Based Study.', 'The prognosis benefits of adjuvant versus salvage radiotherapy for patients after radical prostatectomy with adverse pathological features: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Surgical method influences specimen margins and biochemical recurrence during radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Variation in the use of postoperative radiotherapy among high-risk patients following radical prostatectomy.']"""

We examined the association between PBT and mortality in patients who received surgical treatment of prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.  Materials and methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data set from 1992-2009, we identified 28,854 men with prostate cancer, 5462 patients with bladder cancer, and 14,379 patients with renal cell carcinoma who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP), radical cystectomy (RC), or radical (RN) or partial nephrectomy (PN) as primary therapy. Univariate and multivariate models were used to evaluate the association of PBT with cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM).  Results:   The rate of PBT in bladder and kidney cancer have been increasing over time, and PBT in prostate cancer steadily increased and peaked in 2002 and declined afterward. The median follow-up for the RP, RC, and RN/PN cohorts were 70 months, 21 months, and 39 months, respectively. In the RP cohort, PBT was associated with greater CSM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.609; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.235-2.097; P = .0004) and ACM (HR, 1.121; 95% CI, 1.006-1.251; P = .0394). In the RC cohort, PBT was not associated with greater CSM (HR, 1.047; 95% CI, 0.917-1.195; P = .4962) or ACM (HR, 1.095; 95% CI, 0.998-1.200; P = .0547). In the nephrectomy cohort, PBT was associated with greater CSM (HR, 1.365; 95% CI, 1.167-1.597; P = .0001) and ACM (HR, 1.402; 1.273-1.544; P < .0001).  Conclusion:   PBT was associated with increased CSM and ACM for prostate and kidney cancer in a multivariate model. Although these data do not identify a causative relationship between PBT and mortality, efforts made to limit PBT in patients who undergo urologic cancer surgery can yield long-term survival benefits.""","""['Ayman Soubra', 'Joseph R Zabell', 'Oluwakayode Adejoro', 'Badrinath R Konety']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['The impact of perioperative blood transfusion on cancer recurrence and survival following radical cystectomy.', 'The impact of perioperative blood transfusion on survival after nephrectomy for non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).', 'Peri-operative allogeneic blood transfusion does not adversely affect oncological outcomes after radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer: a propensity score-weighted European multicentre study.', 'Perioperative Blood Transfusion Promotes Worse Outcomes of Bladder Cancer after Radical Cystectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The impact of perioperative blood transfusion on survival and recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Red Blood Cell-Derived Microparticles Exert No Cancer Promoting Effects on Colorectal Cancer Cells In Vitro.', 'Removal of EpCAM-positive tumor cells from blood collected during major oncological surgery using the Catuvab device- a pilot study.', 'CTCs detection from intraoperative salvaged blood in RCC-IVC thrombus patients by negative enrichment and iFISH identification: a preliminary study.', 'Prognostic impact of perioperative blood transfusions on oncological outcomes of patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy: A systematic review.', 'Red blood cell transfusions and the survival in patients with cancer undergoing curative surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Here we show that both targeted mutation and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) silencing of CD24 retard the growth, progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. CD24 competitively inhibits ARF binding to NPM, resulting in decreased ARF, increase MDM2 and decrease levels of p53 and the p53 target p21/CDKN1A. CD24 silencing prevents functional inactivation of p53 by both somatic mutation and viral oncogenes, including the SV40 large T antigen and human papilloma virus 16 E6-antigen. In support of the functional interaction between CD24 and p53, in silico analyses reveal that TP53 mutates at a higher rate among glioma and prostate cancer samples with higher CD24 mRNA levels.

Methods:   We conducted a seven-institution retrospective study of mCRPC patients treated with enzalutamide between January 2009 and February 2014. We compared the baseline characteristics, PSA declines, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), duration on enzalutamide and overall survival (OS) across subgroups defined by prior abiraterone and/or docetaxel.  Results:   Of 310 patients who received enzalutamide, 36 (12%) received neither prior abiraterone nor prior docetaxel, 79 (25%) received prior abiraterone, 30 (10%) received prior docetaxel and 165 (53%) received both prior abiraterone and prior docetaxel.

In the logistic analysis of SRD5A2 polymorphisms with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria, two SNPs (rs508562, rs11675297) and haplotype 1 displayed significant results (odds ratio [OR], 1.76; p=0.05; OR, 1.88-2.02; p=0.01-0.04; OR, 0.59; p=0.02, respectively). rs508562, rs11675297, rs2208532, and haplotype 1 (OR, 1.49; p=0.05; OR, 2.02; p=0.05; OR, 2.01; p=0.04; OR, 0.56-0.64, p=0.03-0.04, respectively) had significant associations with Gleason score. rs508562, rs11675297, and haplotype 1 (OR, 1.41-2.34; p=0.004-0.05; OR, 1.74-1.82; p=0.03-0.05; OR, 0.42-0.67; p=0.0005-0.03, respectively) were significantly associated with clinical stage.  Conclusions:   We conclude that there was no significant association between SRD5A2 SNPs and the risk of prostate cancer in the Korean population. However, we found that some SNPs and 1 haplotype influenced PSA level, Gleason score, and clinical stage.""","""['Se Young Choi', 'Hae Jong Kim', 'Hyun Sub Cheong', 'Soon Chul Myung']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Korean J Urol""","""['SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 are associated with treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia with the combination of 5α-reductase inhibitors and α-adrenergic receptor antagonists.', 'Comprehensive evaluation of the association between prostate cancer and genotypes/haplotypes in CYP17A1, CYP3A4, and SRD5A2.', 'The association of 5alpha-reductase II (SRD5A2) and 17 hydroxylase (CYP17) gene polymorphisms with prostate cancer patients in the Turkish population.', 'Steroid 5-{alpha}-reductase Type 2 (SRD5a2) gene polymorphisms and risk of prostate cancer: a HuGE review.', 'Genotyping the High Altitude Mestizo Ecuadorian Population Affected with Prostate Cancer.', 'Risk Allele Frequency Analysis and Risk Prediction of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms for Prostate Cancer.', 'Discovering pathways in benign prostate hyperplasia: A functional genomics pilot study.', 'Associations of SRD5A2/CYP17/CYP19/VDR gene polymorphisms with the development and clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia: a case-control study in northern Chinese population.']"""

Prostate specific membrane antigen, given its favorable molecular characteristics, holds a promise as an ideal target for prostate cancer-specific nuclear imaging. In this study, we evaluated our initial results of PSMA based PET/CT imaging in prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 22 patients with a median age and serum PSA level of 68 years and 4.15 ng/ml, respectively underwent Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT in our hospital between Februrary and August 2014. Their charts were retrospectively reviewed in order to document the clinical characteristics, the indications for and the results of PSMA based imaging and the impact of Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT findings on disease management.  Results:   The most common indications were rising PSA after local ± adjuvant treatment followed by staging and metastatic evaluation before definitive or salvage treatment. All except 2 patients had prostatic ± extraprostatic PSMA positive lesions. For those who had a positive result; treatment strategies were tailored accordingly. Above the PSA level of 2 ng/ml, none of the PSMA based nuclear imaging studies revealed negative results.  Conclusions:   PSMA based nuclear imaging has significantly impacted our way of handling patients with prostate cancer. Its preliminary performance in different clinical scenarios and ability to detect lesions even in low PSA values seems fairly promising and deserves to be supplemented with further clinical studies.""","""['Mehmet Onur Demirkol', 'Ömer Acar', 'Burcu Uçar', 'Sultan Rana Ramazanoğlu', 'Yeşim Sağlıcan', 'Tarık Esen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Prospective Comparison of 18F-Fluoromethylcholine Versus 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients Who Have Rising PSA After Curative Treatment and Are Being Considered for Targeted Therapy.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Current use of PSMA-PET in prostate cancer management.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Interactions of Urea-Based Inhibitors with Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.', 'Phase 3 multicenter randomized trial of PSMA PET/CT prior to definitive radiation therapy for unfavorable intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer PSMA dRT: study protocol.', '68Ga-Prostate-specific membrane antigen (psma) positron emission tomography (pet) in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Early differences in dynamic uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in primary prostate cancer: A test-retest study.', 'Prostate Specific Antigen and Prostate Specific Antigen Doubling Time Predict Findings on 18F-DCFPyL Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography in Patients with Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.']"""

Our previous study showed a novel LncRNA FR0348383 is up-regulated in over 70% of PCa compared with matched benign tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of urinary FR0348383 for men undergoing prostate biopsy due to elevated PSA (PSA > 4.0 ng/ml) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE).  Methods:   Post-DRE first-catch urine specimens prior to prostate biopsies were prospectively collected. After the whole transcriptome amplification, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction was applied to quantify urine FR0348383 and PSA levels. The FR0348383 score was calculated as the ratio of PSA and FR0348383 mRNA (PSA mRNA/FR0348383 mRNA × 1000). The diagnostic value of FR0348383 score was evaluated by logistic regression and decision curve analysis.  Results:   213 cases with urine samples containing sufficient mRNA were included, 94 cases had serum PSA level 4.0-10.0 ng/ml. PCa was identified in 72 cases. An increasing FR0348383 score was correlated with an increasing probability of a positive biopsy (P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic analysis indicated FR0348383 score (P < 0.001), PSA (P = 0.004), age (P = 0.007), prostate volume (P < 0.001) were independent predictors of PCa. ROC analysis demonstrated FR0348383 score outperformed PSA, %free PSA, and PSA Density in the prediction of PCa in the subgroup of patients with grey area PSA (AUC: 0.815 vs. 0.562 vs. 0.599 vs. 0.645). When using a probability threshold of 30% in the grey zone cohort, The FR0348383 score would save 52.0% of avoidable biopsies without missing any high grade cancers.  Conclusions:   FR0348383 transcript in post-DRE urine may be a novel biomarker for detection of PCa with great diagnostic value, especially in the grey zone cohort.

Small RNA sequencing and examination of PCa-associated miRNAs miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-375 and miR-125b was performed on 20 specimens. We compared findings from prostate biopsies using D'Amico and PRIAS classifications and in relation to whole gland histopathology following radical prostatectomy. Multivariate logistic regression modeling and clinical risk (incorporating standard clinicopathological variables) were performed for all ejaculate-based markers.  Results:   While Hepsin alone was not of predictive value, the Hepsin:PCA3 ratio together with serum PSA, expressed as a univariate composite score based on multivariate logistic regression, was shown to be a better predictor than PSA alone of prostate cancer status (AUC 0.724 vs. 0.676) and risk, using D'Amico (AUC 0.701 vs. 0.680) and PRIAS (AUC 0.679 vs. 0.659) risk stratification criteria as classified using prostate biopsies. It was also possible to analyse a subgroup of patients for miRNA expression with miR-200c (AUC 0.788) and miR-375 (AUC 0.758) showing best single marker performance, while a combination of serum PSA, miR-200c, and miR-125b further improved prediction for prostate cancer status when compared to PSA alone determined by biopsy (AUC 0.869 vs. 0.672; P < 0.05), and risk (D'Amico/PRIAS) as well as by radical prostatectomy histology (AUC 0.809 vs. 0.690). For prostate cancer status by biopsy, at a sensitivity of 90%, the specificity of the test increased from 11% for PSA alone to 67% for a combination of PSA, miR-200c, and miR-125b.  Conclusions:   These results show that use of a combination of different types of genetic markers in ejaculate together with serum PSA are at least as sensitive as those reported in DRE urine. Furthermore, a combination of serum PSA and selected miRNAs improved prediction of prostate cancer status.

In China, the diagnostic and fatality rate of PCa is increasing yearly.  Methods:   To characterize underlying molecular mechanisms, the microRNA (miRNA) profile of high-grade PCa, low-grade PCa, and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) were compared using high-throughput Illumina sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) methods. Moreover, a variety of biological information softwares and databases were applied to predict the target genes of miRNA, molecular functions, and signal pathways.  Results:   Eighteen miRNAs were differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 2, P < 0.05), of which thirteen were upregulated and five were downregulated by sequencing. This was confirmed by qRT-PCR in more clinical tissue samples. In the tumors, miRNAs (miR-125b-5p, miR-126-5p, miR-151a-5p, miR-221-3p, and miR-222-3p) were significantly upregulated with downregulation of miR-486-5p. In addition, 13 novel miRNAs were identified from three prostate tissue libraries, with 12 of them assayed in 21 human normal tissues by qRT-PCR. Multiple databases indicated target genes for these differentially expressed miRNAs. Function annotation of target genes indicated that most of them tend to target genes involved in signal transduction and cell communication, especially cancer-related PI3K-Akt and p53 signaling pathway.  Conclusions:   The small RNA transcriptomes obtained in this study uncovers six differentially expressed miRNAs and 12 novel miRNAs, and provides a better understanding of the expression and function of miRNAs in the development of PCa and reveals several miRNAs in PCa that may have biomarker and therapeutic potentials.""","""['Chunjiao Song', 'Huan Chen', 'Tingzhang Wang', 'Weiguang Zhang', 'Guomei Ru', 'Juan Lang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Comparative microRNA profiling of prostate carcinomas with increasing tumor stage by deep sequencing.', 'Exosomes from bulk and stem cells from human prostate cancer have a differential microRNA content that contributes cooperatively over local and pre-metastatic niche.', 'Identification of the microRNA expression profile in the regenerative neonatal mouse heart by deep sequencing.', 'Assessment of miR-98-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-326 and miR-4289 Expression as Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'miRNAs as novel biomarkers in the management of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs as clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Combined miR-486 and GP88 (Progranulin) Serum Levels Are Suggested as Supportive Biomarkers for Therapy Decision in Elderly Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'miR-32 promotes MYC-driven prostate cancer.', 'miR-486 as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.', 'MicroRNA profiles in five pairs of early gastric cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues.']"""

Patients and methods:   The study included 3 348 men surviving prostate cancer for 2-18 years after diagnosis. A cross-sectional, postal survey of 6 559 survivors diagnosed 2-18 years ago with primary, invasive prostate cancer (ICD10-C61) identified via national, population-based cancer registries in Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. Questions included symptoms at diagnosis, primary treatments and physical symptoms (erectile dysfunction [ED]/urinary incontinence [UI]/bowel problems/breast changes/loss of libido/hot flashes/fatigue) experienced 'ever' and at questionnaire completion ('current'). Symptom proportions were weighted by age, country and time since diagnosis. Bonferroni corrections were applied for multiple comparisons.  Results:   Adjusted response rate 54%; 75% reported at least one 'current' physical symptom ('ever' 90%), with 29% reporting at least three. Prevalence varied by treatment. Overall, 57% reported current ED and this was highest after radical prostatectomy (RP, 76%) followed by external beam radiotherapy with concurrent hormone therapy (HT, 64%).

'Current' hot flashes (41%), breast changes (18%) and fatigue (28%) were reported more often by patients on HT.  Conclusion:   Symptoms after prostate cancer treatment are common, often multiple, persist long-term and vary by treatment method. They represent a significant health burden. An estimated 1.6% of men aged >45 years are survivors of prostate cancer and currently experiencing an adverse physical symptom.

These findings suggest that PTP1B functions as a double-facet molecule in tumors, and the role of PTP1B in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown. The present study demonstrates that the expression of PTP1B in NSCLC tissue is significantly higher than its expression in benign lung disease and is associated with the stage and overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients. In vitro studies have demonstrated that PTP1B promotes the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells by reducing the expression of p-src (Tyr527), which activates src and ERK1/2. This study provides the first exploration of the role of PTP1B in the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC and subsequently elucidates the role of PTP1B in cancer.

For this reason, the identification of the relationships between diseases and genes is important in biology. We propose a method called LGscore, which identifies disease-related genes using Google data and literature data. To implement this method, first, we construct a disease-related gene network using text-mining results. We then extract gene-gene interactions based on co-occurrences in abstract data obtained from PubMed, and calculate the weights of edges in the gene network by means of Z-scoring. The weights contain two values: the frequency and the Google search results. The frequency value is extracted from literature data, and the Google search result is obtained using Google. We assign a score to each gene through a network analysis. We assume that genes with a large number of links and numerous Google search results and frequency values are more likely to be involved in disease. For validation, we investigated the top 20 inferred genes for five different diseases using answer sets. The answer sets comprised six databases that contain information on disease-gene relationships. We identified a significant number of disease-related genes as well as candidate genes for Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, colon cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer.

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an easily determinable marker of systemic inflammation, has been associated with clinical outcome in various cancer entities. In the present study, we validated the prognostic relevance of an elevated NLR in a cohort of European prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Data from 415 consecutive prostate cancer patients treated with 3D conformal radiotherapy at a single tertiary academic center from 1999 to 2007 were included in this retrospective study. Clinical progression-free survival (PFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. To evaluate the prognostic relevance, univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were performed for each end point.  Results:   Based on previously published studies, an NLR ≥ 5 was selected as cutoff value for external validation. Multivariate analysis identified an increased NLR as an independent prognostic factor for clinical PFS [hazard ratio (HR) 3.09, 95 % CI 1.64-5.82, p < 0.001], DMFS (HR 3.51, 95 % CI 1.80-6.85, p < 0.001), and OS (HR 2.16, 95 % CI 1.17-3.99, p = 0.013).

Materials and methods:   A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to examine the effect of late rectal toxicity and compare the costs and quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) of IMRT-O and IMRT+S. The main assumption of this modeling study was that disease progression, genito-urinary toxicity and survival were equal for both comparators.  Results:   For all patients, IMRT+S revealed a lower toxicity than IMRT-O. Treatment follow-up and toxicity costs for IMRT-O and IMRT+S amounted to €1604 and €1444, respectively, thus saving €160 on the complication costs at an extra charge of €1700 for the spacer in IMRT+S. The QALYs yielded for IMRT-O and IMRT+S were 3.542 and 3.570, respectively. This results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €55,880 per QALY gained. For a ceiling ratio of €80,000, IMRT+S had a 77% probability of being cost-effective.

Method:   This study used a qualitative design to examine perceptions regarding susceptibility and screening. Data were collected at a community health center and three predominantly African American churches in North Carolina. Study participants were 46 African American men and women who attended one of four ""listening sessions"" for pretesting PCa educational materials (average age = 55 years). Listening sessions of 1.5-hour duration were conducted to pretest materials; while presenting the materials, researchers probed beliefs and knowledge about PCa screening. The sessions were recorded and transcribed, and the transcripts were qualitatively analyzed using grounded theory.  Results:   The four emergent themes indicated that participants (1) cited behavioral, psychosocial, and biological reasons why African American men have higher PCa risk compared with others; (2) knew about the controversy and had varying responses and intentions; (3) believed screening could save lives, so it should be used regardless of the 2012 recommendation; and (4) felt that women can help men go to the doctor and make screening decisions.

Taxanes and vinca alkaloids are two groups of tubulin-binding agents in cancer chemotherapy. Besides tubulin binding, these groups of agents can also down-regulate protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9, two important cancer-associated zinc-dependent endopeptidases in invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanism of action waits to be explored. In this study, protein levels but not mRNA expressions of MMP-2 and -9 were down-regulated by paclitaxel (a microtubule-stabilization agent), vincristine and evodiamine (two tubulin-depolymerization agents). These agents induced an increase of protein expression of cyclin B1, MPM2 (mitosis-specific phosphoprotein) and polo-like kinase (PLK) 1 phosphorylation. The data showed a negative relationship between the levels of mitotic proteins and MMP-2 and -9 expressions. MG132 (a specific cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor) blocked mitotic entry and arrested cell cycle at G2 phase, preventing down-regulation of MMP-2 and -9. Cell cycle synchronization experiments by thymidine block or nocodazole treatment showed that mitotic exit inhibited the down-regulation of MMP-2 and -9, confirming negative relationship between cell mitosis and protein levels of MMP-2 and -9 expressions. Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 1 is a key kinase in mitotic entry. Knockdown of Cdk1 almost completely inhibited the down-regulation of MMP-2 and -9 induced by tubulin-binding agents. In conclusion, the data suggest that mitotic entry and Cdk1 plays a central role in down-regulation of MMP-2 and -9 protein expressions. Tubulin-binding agents cause mitotic arrest and Cdk1 activation, which may contribute largely to the down-regulation of both MMP-2 and -9 expressions.""","""['Wei-Ling Chang', 'Chia-Chun Yu', 'Ching-Shih Chen', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['MT-4 suppresses resistant ovarian cancer growth through targeting tubulin and HSP27.', 'FRET-Based Sorting of Live Cells Reveals Shifted Balance between PLK1 and CDK1 Activities During Checkpoint Recovery.', 'Piperine inhibits proliferation of human osteosarcoma cells via G2/M phase arrest and metastasis by suppressing MMP-2/-9 expression.', 'Anti-mitotic therapies in cancer.', 'Less understood issues: p21(Cip1) in mitosis and its therapeutic potential.', 'Evodiamine as an anticancer agent: a comprehensive review on its therapeutic application, pharmacokinetic, toxicity, and metabolism in various cancers.', 'Research progress on the pharmacological effects of matrine.', 'A Unified Transcriptional, Pharmacogenomic, and Gene Dependency Approach to Decipher the Biology, Diagnostic Markers, and Therapeutic Targets Associated with Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Activation of PERK Contributes to Apoptosis and G2/M Arrest by Microtubule Disruptors in Human Colorectal Carcinoma Cells ‡.', 'Shortest path counting in probabilistic biological networks.']"""

We investigated whether the human BCRP promoter contains a functional cAMP response element (CRE). 8Br-cAMP, a cAMP analogue, increased the activity of a BCRP promoter reporter construct and BCRP mRNA in human carcinoma cells. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway activation also led to an increase in p-CREB and in BCRP promoter reporter activity via two major downstream EGFR signaling pathways: the phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. EGF treatment increased the phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, ERK and CREB, while simultaneously enhancing BCRP mRNA and functional protein expression. EGF-stimulated CREB phosphorylation and BCRP induction were diminished by inhibition of EGFR, PI3K/AKT or RAS/MAPK signaling. CREB silencing using RNA interference reduced basal levels of BCRP mRNA and diminished the induction of BCRP by EGF. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that a putative CRE site on the BCRP promoter bound p-CREB by a point mutation of the CRE site abolished EGF-induced stimulation of BCRP promoter reporter activity. Furthermore, the CREB co-activator, cAMP-regulated transcriptional co-activator (CRTC2), is involved in CREB-mediated BCRP transcription: androgen depletion of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells increased both CREB phosphorylation and CRTC2 nuclear translocation, and enhanced BCRP expression. Silencing CREB or CRTC2 reduced basal BCRP expression and BCRP induction under androgen-depletion conditions.

To investigate the mechanism of action, detailed biological studies of compounds 9a and 9b were carried out on the human prostate cancer cell line, DU-145. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that these compounds induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Tubulin polymerization assay and immunofluorescence analysis results suggested that these compounds effectively inhibit microtubule assembly formation in DU-145.

The objective of our study was to evaluate diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging for predicting extracapsular extension (ECE) in patients with prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS. One hundred seventeen patients underwent preoperative 3-T MRI and radical prostatectomy. Two radiologists evaluated ECE with T2-weighted imaging based on the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS). Then, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the tumor calculated from two b values (0, 1000 s/mm(2)) was measured. Interreader agreement of T2-weighted imaging scores was assessed with weighted kappa statistics. We compared T2-weighted imaging scores and ADC values between patients with ECE and those without ECE using the unpaired Student t test and evaluated their association with ECE using logistic regression analyses and ROC curves incorporating prostate-specific antigen value, Gleason score, clinical stage, and greatest percentage involved core length. The ADC values were also tested for differences between patients with ECE and those without ECE in subgroups stratified by the T2-weighted imaging criteria shown to have a high specificity for ECE. RESULTS. Fifty (42.7%) patients had ECE. There was substantial agreement for T2-weighted imaging scores (κ = 0.613). T2-weighted imaging scores and ADCs were significantly different in patients with ECE and those without ECE (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the greatest percentage involved core length, T2-weighted imaging score, and ADC (p < 0.05) were independently predictive of ECE. The AUCs for these variables (range, 0.733-0.770) were not significantly different except for the AUC for clinical stage (0.552). The use of a high specificity (92.5%) setting for ECE divided the patients into the following groups: patients with a T2-weighted imaging score of ≥ 4 (n = 20) and patients with a T2-weighted imaging score of < 4 (n = 97). In patients with a T2-weighted imaging score of ≥ 4, the ADC was not significantly different between patients with ECE and those without ECE (p = 0.555). However, among patients with a T2-weighted imaging score of ≤ 3, the ADC value was significantly lower in patients with ECE (mean ± SD, 0.794 ± 0.116) than in those without ECE (1.027 ± 0.339) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. T2-weighted imaging scores and ADCs were independently associated with ECE, and the ADC had incremental value in patients without a high suspicion of ECE on T2-weighted imaging.""","""['Sungmin Woo', 'Jeong Yeon Cho', 'Sang Youn Kim', 'Seung Hyup Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Prostate cancer: utility of diffusion-weighted imaging as a marker of side-specific risk of extracapsular extension.', 'Value of diffusion-weighted imaging at 3 T for prediction of extracapsular extension in patients with prostate cancer: a preliminary study.', 'Diffusion-weighted MRI as a predictor of extracapsular extension in prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative Prostate MRI.', 'Comparison of single-shot EPI and multi-shot EPI in prostate DWI at 3.0\xa0T.', 'The role of MRI in prostate cancer: current and future directions.', 'The Quantitative Assessment of Using Multiparametric MRI for Prediction of Extraprostatic Extension in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging in prostate cancer.', 'MRI-based radiomics models to assess prostate cancer, extracapsular extension and positive surgical margins.']"""

These models, however, focus on healthy tissues and do not incorporate data from tumors. The objective of this study was to apply a tissue composition-based model to six marketed antineoplastic drugs (docetaxel, DOC; doxorubicin, DOX; gemcitabine, GEM; methotrexate, MTX; topotecan, TOP; and fluorouracil, 5-FU) to predict their Kp values in three human tumor xenografts (HCT-116, H2122, and PC3) as well as in healthy tissues (brain, muscle, lung, and liver) under steady-state in vivo conditions in female NCR nude mice. The mechanisms considered in the tissue/tumor composition-based model are the binding to lipids and to plasma proteins, but the transporter effect was also investigated. The method consisted of analyzing tissue composition, performing the pharmacokinetics studies in mice, and calculating the corresponding in vivo Kp values. Analyses of tumor composition indicated that the tumor xenografts contained no or low amounts of common transporters by contrast to lipids. The predicted Kp values were within twofold and threefold of the measured values in 77% and 93% of cases, respectively. However, predictions for brain for each drug, for liver for MTX, and for each tumor xenograft for GEM were disparate from the observed values, and, therefore, not well served by the model. Overall, this study is the first step toward the mechanism-based prediction of Kp values of small molecules in healthy and tumor tissues in mouse when no transporter and permeation limitation effect is evident. This approach will be useful in selecting compounds based on their abilities to penetrate human cancer xenografts with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, thereby increasing therapeutic index for chemotherapy in oncology study.""","""['Patrick Poulin', 'Yung-Hsiang Chen', 'Xiao Ding', 'Stephen E Gould', 'Cornelis Eca Hop', 'Kirsten Messick', 'Jason Oeh', 'Bianca M Liederer']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Pharm Sci""","""['Correlation of tissue-plasma partition coefficients between normal tissues and subcutaneous xenografts of human tumor cell lines in mouse as a prediction tool of drug penetration in tumors.', 'Drug Distribution to Human Tissues: Prediction and Examination of the Basic Assumption in In Vivo Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) Research.', 'Correlation of pharmacokinetics with the antitumor activity of Cetuximab in nude mice bearing the GEO human colon carcinoma xenograft.', 'Prediction of the volume of distribution of a drug: which tissue-plasma partition coefficients are needed?', 'Plasma vs heart tissue concentration in humans - literature data analysis of drugs distribution.', ""Mechanistic Multiscale Pharmacokinetic Model for the Anticancer Drug 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (Gemcitabine) in Pancreatic Cancer."", 'Prediction of Tumor-to-Plasma Ratios of Basic Compounds in Subcutaneous Xenograft Mouse Models.', 'Multiscale Modeling of Antibody-Drug Conjugates: Connecting Tissue and Cellular Distribution to Whole Animal Pharmacokinetics and Potential Implications for Efficacy.', 'Pharmacokinetic modeling of therapies for systemic lupus erythematosus.']"""

We also proved their higher affinity of binding and efficacy on cell viability compared to nonmodified TFOs. To overcome possible off-target effects, we tested wild-type PPRHs, which proved to be capable of binding to their target sequence with more affinity, displaying a higher stability of binding and a higher effect in terms of cell viability.

NF-κB has been proven to promote cancer cell survival, and targeting this pathway will halt the growth of cancer cells. Efforts have been made to produce semisynthetic derivatives of andrographolide with improved anticancer potency and selectivity. Subsequently, the effect of a selected derivative, 3,14,19-tripropionylandrographolide (SRS06), was tested for its action against NF-κB.  Methods:   Screening against 60 US National Cancer Institute (NCI) human cancer cell lines representing leukemia and non-small cell lung (NSCL), colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast cancers was performed to determine the tumor type selectivity and potency of SRS06. Microculture tetrazolium, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and sulforhodamine B assays were used to determine the in vitro anticancer activity, while Western blot studies were performed to ascertain the inhibitory effect of SRS06 on the NF-κB signaling cascade. The TransAM™ p65 assay kit was used to determine NF-κB p65 DNA binding activity in the NSCL cancer cell line A549.  Results:   From the NCI screening, SRS06 was found to exhibit potent growth-inhibitory effects on multiple cancer cell lines with 10-fold lower 50% growth inhibition (GI50) compared with andrographolide. It was also discerned that the compound preferentially targeted melanoma, CNS, renal, colon, ovarian, prostate, and NSCL cancer cell lines. The DNA fragmentation assay indicated that the main mode of cell death of SRS06-treated A549 cells was via apoptosis.

All treatments to date are based on symptomatic relief, not a fundamental understanding of the cause of the disease. However, recent advances have shown that even subclinical varicoceles, which are more common than generally realized, cause retrograde blood flow from the testes past the prostate gland causing over a 130-fold increase in free testosterone in the veins near the prostate. By treating the varicoceles via embolization of the internal spermatic vein and its communicating and connected vessels the prostate enlargement can be reversed with corresponding symptomatic relief. So, varicose veins in the pampiniform venous plexus, varicoceles, are the direct cause of BPH. But what causes varicoceles? Recent research has uncovered the role of vitamin K in the calcification of varicose veins as well as a role in the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the media layer of the vein wall. Vitamin K is intimately involved in the formation of varicose veins. The hypothesis is that poor prostate health is essentially a vitamin K insufficiency disorder. By providing vitamin K in the right form and quantity, along with other supporting nutrients and phytochemicals, it is likely that excellent prostate health can be extended much longer, and perhaps poor prostate health can be reversed. A protective role for vitamin K with respect to advanced prostate cancer was already found in the Heidelberg cohort of the EPIC study. This hypothesis can be further evaluated in studies examining the connection between vitamin K and varicoceles, and also by examining the connection between varicoceles and benign prostate hyperplasia. If this hypothesis is found to be true, management of prostate health will be radically altered. Rather than focusing on prostate health as a hormonal imbalance, prostate enlargement will be seen as a result of poor health of the veins in general and the internal spermatic veins in particular. Factors which promote the health of the veins will become a greater focus of research, including the role of vitamin K. Finally, the emerging understanding of the cause of BPH will empower men to take care of their bodies so they can enjoy much better health through their entire lifespan.""","""['Michael S Donaldson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Hypotheses""","""['Reversal of benign prostate hyperplasia by selective occlusion of impaired venous drainage in the male reproductive system: novel mechanism, new treatment.', 'Varicocele is the root cause of BPH: Destruction of the valves in the spermatic veins produces elevated pressure which diverts undiluted testosterone directly from the testes to the prostate.', 'Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Long-term follow-up of prostate volume reduction after sclerotherapy of the internal spermatic veins.', 'Paying the price for standing tall: Fluid mechanics of prostate pathology.', 'The varicocele.']"""

Since PSMA expression is also found in the kidneys, renal tracer uptake can be dose-limiting. Because kidney kinetics differ from tumor kinetics, serial application of PSMA inhibitors such as 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (PMPA) may improve the kidney-to-tumor ratio. In this study, we evaluated the effect of PMPA on the biodistribution of 2 promising PSMA ligands.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer xenografts (LNCaP) were transplanted subcutaneously into mice. After injection of (125)I-MIP1095, a 16-h latency period was allowed for tracer clearance from the blood and renal calices. After baseline scintigraphy, PMPA was injected in doses of 0.2-50 mg/kg (n = 3 per dose, 5 controls), followed by scans at 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after PMPA injection. Kidney and tumor displacement was determined as a percentage of baseline. A shortened but similar design was used to evaluate the PSMA ligand MIP1404, which contains a chelate for (99m)Tc/rhenium.  Results:   PMPA injection 16 h after MIP1095 translated into a rapid and quantitative relevant displacement of renal activity. Tumor uptake was reduced to a significantly lesser extent in a dose-dependent manner. PMPA doses of 0.2-1 mg/kg appear optimal for sustaining nearly complete tumor uptake while simultaneously achieving near-total blocking of specific renal PSMA binding. The effect was successfully validated with the PSMA ligand MIP1404.  Conclusion:   PSMA-targeted radionuclide therapy can benefit from serial PMPA comedication by reducing off-target radiation to the kidneys. These data will be used for a first approximation in clinical translation, although in patients an optimization of the dose and time schedule may be necessary.""","""['Clemens Kratochwil', 'Frederik L Giesel', 'Karin Leotta', 'Matthias Eder', 'Torsten Hoppe-Tich', 'Hagop Youssoufian', 'Klaus Kopka', 'John W Babich', 'Uwe Haberkorn']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['99mTc-labeled small-molecule inhibitors of prostate-specific membrane antigen for molecular imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Towards Personalized Treatment of Prostate Cancer: PSMA I&T, a Promising Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Theranostic Agent.', 'Preclinical evaluation of novel glutamate-urea-lysine analogues that target prostate-specific membrane antigen as molecular imaging pharmaceuticals for prostate cancer.', 'PSMA Ligands for Radionuclide Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancer: Clinical Status.', 'The Rise of PSMA Ligands for Diagnosis and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeted Alpha-Particle Therapy: A Review of Current Trials.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a PSMA-Targeting Homodimer with an Optimized Linker for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Current and upcoming radionuclide therapies in the direction of precision oncology: A narrative review.', 'Pharmacological Optimization of PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy.', 'Current Status of PSMA-Targeted Radioligand Therapy in the Era of Radiopharmaceutical Therapy Acquiring Marketing Authorization.']"""

To minimise bias, the UCD should be independently verified by expert reviewers, blinded to death certificate data and trial arm. We investigated whether standardising the information submitted for UCD assignment in a population-based randomised controlled trial of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer reduced the reviewers' ability to correctly guess the trial arm.  Methods:   Over 550 General Practitioner (GP) practices (>415,000 men aged 50-69 years) were cluster-randomised to PSA testing (intervention arm) or the National Health Service (NHS) prostate cancer risk management programme (control arm) between 2001 and 2007. Assignment of UCD was by independent reviews of researcher-written clinical vignettes that masked trial arm and death certificate information. A period of time after the process began (the initial phase), we analysed whether the reviewers could correctly identify trial arm from the vignettes, and the reasons for their choice. This feedback led to further standardisation of information (second phase), after which we re-assessed the extent of correct identification of trial arm.  Results:   1099 assessments of 509 vignettes were completed by January 2014. In the initial phase (n = 510 assessments), reviewers were unsure of trial arm in 33% of intervention and 30% of control arm assessments and were influenced by symptoms at diagnosis, PSA test result and study-specific criteria. In the second phase (n = 589), the respective proportions of uncertainty were 45% and 48%. The percentage of cases whereby reviewers were unable to determine the trial arm was greater following the standardisation of information provided in the vignettes. The chances of a correct guess and an incorrect guess were equalised in each arm, following further standardisation.

Methods:   We investigated 283 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer retrospectively.

Hypertension was defined as systolic BP (SBP)⩾130mmHg or diastolic BP⩾85mmHg.  Results:   Among 283 patients, 41 (14%) developed biochemical recurrence subsequently. We performed a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to assess the association of each obesity measurement and SBP with biochemical recurrence using clinical predictors as potential confounders. No association was observed between any obesity measurement assessed and biochemical recurrence. Adjusting for each of BMI, WC and VAT, a higher SBP was associated significantly with biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], adjusted for VAT=1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.02-1.07). Adjusting for obesity (BMI⩾25kg/m(2)), hypertension was also associated significantly with biochemical recurrence (HR=2.08; 95% CI=1.09-3.97). Compared with normotensive patients, those with untreated and uncontrolled hypertension had a significantly increased risk of biochemical recurrence (HR=2.45; 95% CI=1.06-5.66).

Synthesis of these compounds primarily involved lithiated toluamide-benzonitrile cycloaddition, Suzuki coupling, and nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Eight of the derivatives were selectively toxic against human ductal breast epithelial tumor cells (T47D), human prostate cancer cells (DU145), and human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-15), but had no effect on normal human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A). The topo inhibitory activities of the diarylisoquinoline compounds were relatively dependent upon their chemical structure. 3,4-Diarylisoquinolones generally did not inhibit topo I and only showed moderate inhibition of topo II. In contrast, several 3,4-diarylisoquinolinamines showed superior topo I inhibitory activity. Isoquinolinamine derivatives had greater affinity for topo I than for topo II. Topo inhibition by 3,4-diarylisoquinolines was further supported by docking models showing intercalative and/or H-bond interactions between these compounds and the DNA/topo(s).

We use simulation modeling to project the impact of adding PCA3 to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening on prostate cancer detection and mortality in the United States.  Methods:   We used data from a recent study of PCA3 in men referred for prostate biopsy to extend an existing simulation model of PSA growth, disease progression, and survival. We specified several PSA-PCA3 strategies designed to improve specificity and reduce overdiagnosis. Using these strategies to screen a cohort of men biennially between ages 50 and 74, we projected true- and false-positive tests, overdiagnoses, and lives saved relative to a PSA-based strategy with a cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL for biopsy referral.  Results:   We identified several PSA-PCA3 strategies that substantially reduced false-positive tests and overdiagnoses while preserving the majority of lives saved. PCA3>35 for biopsy referral in men with PSA between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL retained 85% of lives saved while approximately halving false positives and reducing overdiagnoses by 25%.

The known antimitotic CIL-102 was moderately active against the growth of PC-3 prostate cancer cells with an IC50 value of 2.69 μM while it was more potent against the growth of A549, MCF-7 and M-10 cells with IC50 values of 0.61, 0.31 and 0.95 μM, respectively. However, the cytotoxic profiles of its N-alkylated derivatives, 6a - 6c, were reversed and strongly inhibited PC-3 cell growth with IC50 values of less than 1.0 μM but only weakly against the growth of A549, MCF-7 and M-10 cells. These results indicated that N-alkylation of CIL-102 increased not only selectivity but also the antiproliferative potency against PC-3 cell growth. Among these derivatives synthesized, N-(4-acetylphenyl)-N-(furo[2,3-b]quinolin- 4-yl)methylamine (6a) and its N-ethyl counterpart 6b are the two most active CIL-102 derivatives against PC-3 cell growth with IC50 value of 0.22 and 0.20 μM, respectively. Compound 6a is less cytotoxic to normal human M-10 cells than 6b and therefore was selected for further mechanism studies. The flow cytometry studies clearly indicated that compound 6a induced cell accumulation in G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner after 24 h-treatment. While the proliferation of LNCaP C-81 prostate cancer cells was also strongly suppressed by compound 6a; compound 11a exhibited better selective activity toward LNCaP C-81 prostate cancer cells over RWPE-1 non-cancerous prostate epithelia.

In Tobago, KS is not common; however, HHV-8 seropositivity has been reported to be 39.9% in men with prostate cancer compared to <22.9% in healthier women and men. To understand HHV-8 transmission, we examined HHV-8 seroconversion and seroreversion, and risk factors for these changes in Tobago men. Serum specimens from a sub-cohort of Tobago Prostate Survey men, aged 40-81 years (n = 381/442), were collected at baseline and a subsequent visit between 3 and 9 years and tested for HHV-8 seropositivity using an immunofluorescence assay for antibodies against HHV-8 lytic antigens. Poisson distribution was used to calculate HHV-8 seroconversion and seroreversion rates and their 95% confidence intervals. Differences in baseline characteristics between HHV-seroconverters versus persistent HHV-8 seronegative men and HHV-8 seroreverters versus HHV-8 seropositive men were examined. HHV-8 seropositivity was 12.3% (N = 381) at baseline, with HHV-8 seropositivity significantly higher in increasing age groups, 40-49 (4.0%) to 70-81 (37.5%) years (P-value trend <0.0001). HHV-8 seroconversion and seroreversion rates were 0.23 per 100 person-years (95% C.I., 0.06-0.58) and 2.42 per 100 person-years (95% C.I., 0.89-5.26), respectively.

Some functions of melatonin are mediated by its membrane receptors but others are receptor-independent. For the latter, melatonin must enter into the cell. Melatonin is a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan and reportedly easily crosses biological membranes due to its amphipathic nature. However, the mechanism by which melatonin enters into cells remains unknown. Changes in redox state, endocytosis pathways, multidrug resistance, glycoproteins or a variety of strategies have no effect on melatonin uptake. Herein, it is demonstrated that members of the SLC2/GLUT family glucose transporters have a central role in melatonin uptake. When studied by docking simulation, it is found that melatonin interacts at the same location in GLUT1 where glucose does. Furthermore, glucose concentration and the presence of competitive ligands of GLUT1 affect the concentration of melatonin into cells. As a regulatory mechanism, melatonin reduces the uptake of glucose and modifies the expression of GLUT1 transporter in prostate cancer cells. More importantly, glucose supplementation promotes prostate cancer progression in TRAMP mice, while melatonin attenuated glucose-induced tumor progression and prolonged the lifespan of tumor-bearing mice. This is the first time that a facilitated transport of melatonin is suggested. In fact, the important role of glucose transporters and glucose metabolism in cell fate might explain some of the diverse functions described for melatonin.""","""['David Hevia', 'Pedro González-Menéndez', 'Isabel Quiros-González', 'Ana Miar', 'Aida Rodríguez-García', 'Dun-Xian Tan', 'Russel J Reiter', 'Juan C Mayo', 'Rosa M Sainz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Pineal Res""","""['Melatonin Decreases Glucose Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Cells: A 13C Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomic Study.', 'Regulation of GLUT transporters by flavonoids in androgen-sensitive and -insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Melatonin uptake in prostate cancer cells: intracellular transport versus simple passive diffusion.', 'The dark side of glucose transporters in prostate cancer: Are they a new feature to characterize carcinomas?', 'Melatonin Uptake by Cells: An Answer to Its Relationship with Glucose?', ""The Melatonin-Mitochondrial Axis: Engaging the Repercussions of Ultraviolet Radiation Photoaging on the Skin's Circadian Rhythm."", 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'Antiviral effect of melatonin on Japanese encephalitis virus infection involves inhibition of neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation in SH-SY5Y cells.', 'Potential Roles of Melatonin in Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity: From Cellular Mechanisms to Clinical Application.', 'Aging-Related Ovarian Failure and Infertility: Melatonin to the Rescue.']"""

Two study groups were considered: group 1 included patients with International Prostate Symptom Score ≤7 (mild) and group 2 included patients with International Prostate Symptom Score ≥8 (moderate to severe). Student's t-test and logistic regression were carried out to detect a predictive factor of International Prostate Symptom Score ≤7 at 24 months.  Results:   The mean International Prostate Symptom Score was 5.58 ± 6.6, 11.12 ± 7.1 and 7.62 ± 6 at baseline, 1 month and 3 months, respectively (P <0.0001).

This study aimed to compare the quantitative proteomic responses to PLB treatment in human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells using the approach of stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). The data were finally validated using Western blot assay. First, the bioinformatic analysis predicted that PLB could interact with 78 proteins that were involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, immunity, and signal transduction. Our quantitative proteomic study using SILAC revealed that there were at least 1,225 and 267 proteins interacting with PLB and there were 341 and 107 signaling pathways and cellular functions potentially regulated by PLB in PC-3 and DU145 cells, respectively. These proteins and pathways played a critical role in the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and reactive oxygen species generation. The proteomic study showed substantial differences in response to PLB treatment between PC-3 and DU145 cells. PLB treatment significantly modulated the expression of critical proteins that regulate cell cycle, apoptosis, and EMT signaling pathways in PC-3 cells but not in DU145 cells. Consistently, our Western blotting analysis validated the bioinformatic and proteomic data and confirmed the modulating effects of PLB on important proteins that regulated cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, and EMT in PC-3 and DU145 cells. The data from the Western blot assay could not display significant differences between PC-3 and DU145 cells. These findings indicate that PLB elicits different proteomic responses in PC-3 and DU145 cells involving proteins and pathways that regulate cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, reactive oxygen species production, and antioxidation/oxidation homeostasis. This is the first systematic study with integrated computational, proteomic, and functional analyses revealing the networks of signaling pathways and differential proteomic responses to PLB treatment in prostate cancer cells. Quantitative proteomic analysis using SILAC represents an efficient and highly sensitive approach to identify the target networks of anticancer drugs like PLB, and the data may be used to discriminate the molecular and clinical subtypes, and to identify new therapeutic targets and biomarkers, for prostate cancer. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential of quantitative proteomic analysis in the identification of new targets and biomarkers for prostate cancer.""","""['Jia-Xuan Qiu', 'Zhi-Wei Zhou', 'Zhi-Xu He', 'Ruan Jin Zhao', 'Xueji Zhang', 'Lun Yang', 'Shu-Feng Zhou', 'Zong-Fu Mao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['Anticancer Effects and Mechanisms of Action of Plumbagin: Review of Research Advances.', 'Plumbagin suppresses epithelial to mesenchymal transition and stemness via inhibiting Nrf2-mediated signaling pathway in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'Plumbagin induces cell cycle arrest and autophagy and suppresses epithelial to mesenchymal transition involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated pathway in human pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Induction of apoptosis and autophagy via sirtuin1- and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated pathways by plumbagin in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Emerging role of plumbagin: Cytotoxic potential and pharmaceutical relevance towards cancer therapy.', 'Expression Signatures of Long Noncoding RNAs in Left Ventricular Noncompaction.', 'Anticancer Effects and Mechanisms of Action of Plumbagin: Review of Research Advances.', 'Reversal of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition by Natural Anti-Inflammatory and Pro-Resolving Lipids.', 'A quantitative proteomic response of hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells to danusertib, a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor.', 'Differential gene expression induced by anti-cancer agent plumbagin is mediated by androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.']"""

Osteoporosis is characterized by a progressive loss of bone mass and microarchitecture, which leads to increased fracture risk. Denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody resembling natural IgG2 immunoglobulin, has antiresorptive activity and is distinguished from other antiresorptive drugs. It mimics osteoprotegerin (OPG) that binds to RANKL and hence does not allow RANKL to bind with RANK receptor, thereby inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, activation and survival exerting primarily antiresorptive action. Denosumab trials have shown its efficacy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, unresectable giant cell tumor of bone and significant effect in non-metastatic prostate cancer and delay in the time-to-first skeletal related events (SRE) and subsequent SRE with denosumab than zoledronic acid in patients. It is available as 60 mg/ml in pre-filled syringes and approved for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (60 mg s.c. twice yearly), unresectable giant cell tumor of bone in adults and skeletally mature adolescents (120 mh s.c. monthly), prevention of skeletal-related events and to increase bone mass in patients at high risk for fracture including androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer or adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.

As X-ray energies differ, we hypothesized that 18-MV photon IMRT may be better for large patients and tomotherapy may be more suitable for small patients. Thus, we compared dose-volume parameters for the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs) in 59 patients with T1-3 N0M0 prostate cancer who had been treated using 5-field IMRT. For these same patients, tomotherapy plans were also prepared for comparison. In addition, plans of 18 patients who were actually treated with tomotherapy were analyzed. The evaluated parameters were homogeneity indicies and a conformity index for the PTVs, and D2 (dose received by 2% of the PTV in Gy), D98, Dmean and V10-70 Gy (%) for OARs. To evaluate differences by body size, patients with a known body mass index were grouped by that index ( <21; 21-25; and >25 kg/m(2)). For the PTV, all parameters were higher in the tomotherapy plans compared with the 5-field IMRT plans. For the rectum, V10 Gy and V60 Gy were higher, whereas V20 Gy and V30 Gy were lower in the tomotherapy plans. For the bladder, all parameters were higher in the tomotherapy plans. However, both plans were considered clinically acceptable. Similar trends were observed in 18 patients treated with tomotherapy. Obvious trends were not observed for body size. Tomotherapy provides equivalent dose distributions for PTVs and OARs compared with 18-MV 5-field IMRT.

Tumor growth and metastasis are supported by RUNX family transcriptional scaffolding proteins, which mediate the assembly of nuclear-matrix-associated gene-regulatory hubs. We used proteomic analysis to identify RUNX2-dependent protein-protein interactions associated with the nuclear matrix in bone, breast and prostate tumor cell types and found that RUNX2 interacts with three distinct proteins that respond to DNA damage - RUVBL2, INTS3 and BAZ1B. Subnuclear foci containing these proteins change in intensity or number following UV irradiation. Furthermore, RUNX2, INTS3 and BAZ1B form UV-responsive complexes with the serine-139-phosphorylated isoform of H2AX (γH2AX). UV irradiation increases the interaction of BAZ1B with γH2AX and decreases histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation levels, which mark accessible chromatin. RUNX2 depletion prevents the BAZ1B-γH2AX interaction and attenuates loss of H3K9 and H3K56 acetylation. Our data are consistent with a model in which RUNX2 forms functional complexes with BAZ1B, RUVBL2 and INTS3 to mount an integrated response to DNA damage.

The aim of this study was to evaluate focal lesions of the testes with diameters of <10 mm using sonoelastography, B-mode sonography (US), and colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDU).  Methods:   Thirty patients who were referred to our outpatient clinics for varicocoeles, scrotal pain, scrotal enlargements, epididymitis, palpable testicular nodules, or infertility, were prospectively enrolled into this study. Ultrasound evaluations had revealed that 27 subjects had focal testicular lesions with diameters of <10 mm and 3 subjects had 10-mm spherical non-homogeneous testicular nodules. All lesions were evaluated using semiquantitative sonoelastography, and the patients underwent orchifunicolectomies. The testicular lesions were examined histopathologically. The vascularization of the lesions and the surrounding testicular parenchyma was evaluated by analysing the immunohistochemical distribution of the cluster of differentiation 31 and by calculating the vascular indices (VI). Potential associations between the strain ratios (stiffness of the lesions) and the VI were tested.  Results:   Analyses of the strain fields obtained using semiquantitative sonoelastography yielded different values for the masses and the surrounding tissues, which led to significant increases in the strain ratios. Sonoelastography upheld all of the diagnoses that were suspected when the patients were physically examined, when the serum markers were analysed, and after the patients had undergone US and CDU. Histopathological examinations confirmed the neoplastic characteristics of these masses. A significant inverse correlation was determined between the sonoelastographic strain ratio and the VI (Pearson correlation coefficient, r, = - 0.93; P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Our investigation shows that semiquantitative sonoelastography may provide additional objective information to support the algorithm used to diagnose testicular lesions. This might be of crucial diagnostic importance for lesions with diameters of <10 mm, particularly if they are not palpable, are negative for serum tumour markers, and if the findings from ultrasonography and CDU are equivocal. The findings from semiquantitative sonoelastography might indicate the need for surgical exploration. Further investigations with larger numbers of patients are required to corroborate these data and to support the use of semiquantitative sonoelastography in the evaluation of testicular lesions.""","""['Antonio Luigi Pastore', 'Giovanni Palleschi', 'Piero Maceroni', 'Giorgia Manfredonia', 'Domenico Autieri', 'Jessica Cacciotti', 'Barbara Sardella', 'Natale Porta', 'Vincenzo Petrozza', 'Antonio Carbone']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Imaging""","""['Incidentally detected non-palpable testicular tumours in adults at scrotal ultrasound: impact of radiological findings on management Radiologic review and recommendations of the ESUR scrotal imaging subcommittee.', 'Real-time sonoelastography for the evaluation of testicular lesions.', 'Value of high resolution compression elastography and color doppler sonography in characterisation of breast lesions: comparison of different high-frequency transducers.', 'Elasto-sonography of the testis: preliminary experience.', 'Sonoelastography in daily clinical routine.', 'Elastography of focal testicular lesions: current concepts and utility.', 'Evaluation of the diagnostic efficacy of strain elastography in infertile population with normal and abnormal semen parameters.', ""'Real-time sonoelastography' in anterior urethral strictures: A novel technique for assessment of spongiofibrosis."", 'Diagnostic value of qualitative and strain ratio elastography in the differential diagnosis of non-palpable testicular lesions.', 'Incidentally detected non-palpable testicular tumours in adults at scrotal ultrasound: impact of radiological findings on management Radiologic review and recommendations of the ESUR scrotal imaging subcommittee.']"""

A significant reduction of EphA5 transcripts in high-grade prostate cancer tissue was shown using a transcriptomic analysis, compared to the low-grade prostate cancer tissue. As less is known about the mechanism of EphA5 downregulation and the function of EphA5, here we investigated the expression and an epigenetic change of EphA5 in prostate cancer and determined if these findings were correlated with clinicopathologic characteristics of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Seven prostate cell lines (RWPE-1, LNCap, LNCap-LN3, CWR22rv-1, PC-3, PC-3M-LN4, and DU145), thirty-nine BPH, twenty-two primary prostate carcinomas, twenty-three paired noncancerous and cancerous prostate tissues were examined via qRT-PCR, methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite sequencing, immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The role of EphA5 in prostate cancer cell migration and invasion was examined by wound healing and transwell assay.  Results:   Downregulation or loss of EphA5 mRNA or protein expression was detected in 28 of 45 (62.2%) prostate carcinomas, 2 of 39 (5.1%) hyperplasias, and all 6 prostate cancer cell lines. Methylation of the EphA5 promoter region was present in 32 of 45 (71.1%) carcinoma samples, 3 of 39 (7.7%) hyperplasias, and the 6 prostate cancer cell lines. Among 23 paired prostate carcinoma tissues, 16 tumor samples exhibited the hypermethylation of EphA5, and 15 of these 16 specimens (93.8%) shown the downregulation of EphA5 expression than that of their respectively matched noncancerous samples. Immunostaining analysis demonstrated that the EphA5 protein was absent or down-regulated in 10 of 13 (76.9%) available carcinoma samples, and 8 of these 10 samples (80.0%) exhibited hypermethylation. The frequency of EphA5 methylation was higher in cancer patients with an elevated Gleason score or T3-T4 staging. Following the treatment of 6 prostate cancer cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, the levels of EphA5 mRNA were significantly increased. Prostate cancer cells invasion and migration were significantly suppressed by ectopic expression of EphA5 in vitro.

The margins of most cancer types are not well demarcated because the cancer diffusely infiltrates the surrounding tissues. Furthermore, cancers may be multifocal and characterized by the presence of microscopic satellite lesions. Such microscopic foci represent a major reason for persistence of cancer, local recurrences, and metastatic spread, and are usually impossible to visualize with currently available imaging technologies. An imaging method to reveal the true extent of tumors is desired clinically and surgically. We show the precise visualization of tumor margins, microscopic tumor invasion, and multifocal locoregional tumor spread using a new generation of surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) nanoparticles, which are termed SERRS nanostars. The SERRS nanostars feature a star-shaped gold core, a Raman reporter resonant in the near-infrared spectrum, and a primer-free silication method. In genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and sarcoma, and in one human sarcoma xenograft model, SERRS nanostars enabled accurate detection of macroscopic malignant lesions, as well as microscopic disease, without the need for a targeting moiety. Moreover, the sensitivity (1.5 fM limit of detection) of SERRS nanostars allowed imaging of premalignant lesions of pancreatic and prostatic neoplasias.

Patients and methods:   We created a centralized database-accessible only by nonurologist researchers-within a cancer epidemiology center, after ethics approval from that institution. A single researcher prospectively entered baseline, treatment, and clinical/biochemical follow-up data from all patients treated with HIFU in the state of Victoria over the study period.  Results:   We accrued 108 patients, of whom 103 had been staged as having clinically localized disease. Ninety-three patients (86.1%) had low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Forty-four patients (40.5%) had persistent mild urinary incontinence at 3 months after treatment, and 3 of these ultimately underwent further surgical procedures to correct incontinence. Twenty-seven patients (25%) additionally experienced occasions of urinary retention in the first 3 months after treatment because of passage of tissue. Twenty-nine patients had achieved a prostate-specific antigen level of <0.2 ng/mL at 3 months after HIFU. Fifty-six patients underwent post-HIFU prostate biopsy, and this was positive for residual cancer in 51 cases.

At the beginning of this century, the expected survival of mCRPC patients was not more than 12 months. After the introduction of docetaxel in the clinical practice in 2004, and the recent availability of new drugs cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and radium-223 the landscape is dramatically changed with an expected median survival of about three years. The possibility of administering docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, and enzalutamide as first line treatment, and cabazitaxel, abiretone acetate, and enzalutamide as second line, as well as the availability of radium-223 for the treatment of mCRPC patients regardless of chemotherapy administration, changed the natural history of the disease. At the same time, it is probable that also the biology of the disease is changing with the appearance of mechanisms of resistance which are common to all the drugs. This plays a central role in sequencing the available drugs not only in the first and second line setting but also beyond the second line. The future challenges for the oncologists will be to develop new drugs able to overcome the resistances, mainly when they are native, to find the optimal sequence to optimize the use of available drugs, to place at the best place other active drugs, such as vaccines and radiopharmaceuticals, to exploit the new drugs also in a hormone-sensitive phase.""","""['Orazio Caffo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Recenti Prog Med""","""['Third-line Enzalutamide Following Docetaxel and Abiraterone in Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cross-resistance between taxanes and new hormonal agents abiraterone and enzalutamide may affect drug sequence choices in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'Patient characteristics and overall survival in patients with post-docetaxel metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in the community setting.', 'Lentiviral vector-mediated insertional mutagenesis screen identifies genes that influence androgen independent prostate cancer progression and predict clinical outcome.']"""

The effect of evodiamine on the protein expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), caspase-3 and survivin were detected by performing western blot analysis. Evodiamine inhibited the growth of human osteosarcoma U2OS cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis. Western blotting demonstrated that evodiamine downregulated the expression of Bcl-2, caspase-3 and survivin, and upregulated the expression of Bax in human osteosarcoma cells.

We undertook this study to determine if treatment in the modern era resulted in decreased second malignancies. Patients diagnosed with stage I-II cHL between 1988 and 2009 who received radiation therapy (RT) were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Freedom from second malignancy (FFSM) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis (UVA) was performed using the Log-Rank test, and included age, gender, year of diagnosis, and stage. Multivariable analysis (MVA) was performed using Cox Proportional Hazards modeling. The study cohort included 8807 patients. The median age at diagnosis was 32 years (range: 2-85). The majority of patients had stage II disease (n = 6044, 69%), 597 (7%) had extranodal involvement (ENI), and 1925 (22%) had B symptoms. Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 7.2 years (range: 0-22). Five hundred twenty-three (6%) patients developed a second malignancy. Median latency to second malignancy was 5.8 years (range: 0.1-21.5). Of the 523 patients that developed a second malignancy, 228 (44%) occurred in the first 5 years, 139 (27%) were diagnosed between years 5-10, and 156 (30%) beyond 10 years. The 10 year FFSM for patients treated between 1988 and 1999 was 93.0% versus 95.1% for patients treated between 2000 and 2009 (P = 0.04), On MVA, treatment between 2000 and 2009 was associated with a HR for second malignancy of 0.77 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.62-0.96, P = 0.02) compared to the treatment between 1988 and 1999. Our analysis suggests that in patients treated with RT for stage I or II cHL, treatment prior to 2000 had a slightly higher risk of second malignancy compared to treatment in 2000 and later.

However, this cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among American men due to castration-resistant progression, suggesting that novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed for this life-threatening condition. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110β is a major cellular signaling molecule and has been identified as a critical factor in prostate cancer progression. In a recent report, we established a nanomicelle-based strategy to deliver p110β-specific inhibitor TGX221 to prostate cancer cells by conjugating the surface of nanomicelles with a RNA aptamer against prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) present in all clinical prostate cancers. In this study, we tested this nanomicellar TGX221 for its in vivo anti-tumor effect in mouse xenograft models.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines LAPC-4, LNCaP, C4-2 and 22RV1 were used to establish subcutaneous xenograft tumors in nude mice. Paraffin sections from xenograft tumor specimens were used in immunohistochemistry assays to detect AKT phosphorylation, cell proliferation marker Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), as well as 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Quantitative PCR assay was conducted to determine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene expression in xenograft tumors.  Results:   Although systemic delivery of unconjugated TGX221 significantly reduced xenograft tumor growth in nude mice compared to solvent control, the nanomicellar TGX221 conjugates completely blocked tumor growth of xenografts derived from multiple prostate cancer cell lines. Further analyses revealed that AKT phosphorylation and cell proliferation indexes were dramatically reduced in xenograft tumors received nanomicellar TGX221 compared to xenograft tumors received unconjugated TGX221 treatment. There was no noticeable side effect by gross observation or at microscopic level of organ tissue section.  Conclusion:   These data strongly suggest that prostate cancer cell-targeted nanomicellar TGX221 is an effective anti-cancer agent for prostate cancer.""","""['Ruibao Chen', 'Yunqi Zhao', 'Yan Huang', 'Qiuhong Yang', 'Xing Zeng', 'Wencong Jiang', 'Jihong Liu', 'J Brantley Thrasher', 'M Laird Forrest', 'Benyi Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Characterization of a novel p110β-specific inhibitor BL140 that overcomes MDV3100-resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'P110β Inhibition Reduces Histone H3K4 Di-Methylation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Dissociation between androgen responsiveness for malignant growth vs. expression of prostate specific differentiation markers PSA, hK2, and PSMA in human prostate cancer models.', 'Cannabinoids and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of Animal Studies.', 'PI3K/p110β-specific inhibitors in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Aptamers as Theragnostic Tools in Prostate Cancer.', 'Advances in Polyhydroxyalkanoate Nanocarriers for Effective Drug Delivery: An Overview and Challenges.', 'The PTEN Conundrum: How to Target PTEN-Deficient Prostate Cancer.', 'Enhancement of FAK alleviates ventilator-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury.', 'Alternol eliminates excessive ATP production by disturbing Krebs cycle in prostate cancer.']"""

However, what represents an adverse pathologic outcome in this setting is unknown. We aimed at assessing the optimal definition of misclassification and its effect on recurrence in AS candidates treated with radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   Overall, 1,710 patients eligible for AS according to Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance criteria treated with RP between 2000 and 2013 at 3 centers were evaluated. Patients were stratified according to pathology results at RP: organ-confined disease and pathologic Gleason score ≤ 6 (group 1); organ-confined disease and Gleason score 3+4 (group 2); and non-organ-confined disease, Gleason score ≥ 4+3, and nodal invasion (group 3). Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as 2 consecutive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ 0.2 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier curves assessed time to BCR. Multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the association between pathologic features and BCR. Multivariable logistic regression analyses identified the predictors of adverse pathologic characteristics.  Results:   Overall, 926 (54.2%), 653 (33.0%), and 220 (12.9%) patients were categorized in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Median follow-up was 32.2 months. The 5-year BCR-free survival rate was 94.2%. Patients in group 3 had lower BCR-free survival rates compared with those in group 1 (79.1% vs. 97.0%, P<0.001). No differences were observed between patients included in group 1 vs. group 2 (97.0% vs. 94.7%, P = 0.1). These results were confirmed at multivariable analyses and after stratification according to margin status. Older age and PSA density ≥ 10 ng/ml/ml were associated with higher risk of unfavorable pathologic characteristics (i.e., inclusion in group 3; all P<0.001).  Conclusions:   Among patients eligible for AS treated with RP, only men with Gleason score ≥ 4+3 or non-organ-confined disease at final pathology were at increased risk of BCR.

In this case, delivery is enhanced by a variety of approaches including lipid or polymer conjugation, particle-mediated delivery, hydrodynamic delivery, ultrasound or electroporation. Electroporation was originally used as a laboratory tool to deliver DNA to bacterial and mammalian cells in culture. Electrode development allowed this technique to be modified for in vivo use. After preclinical therapeutic studies, clinical delivery of cell impermeant chemotherapeutic agents progressed to clinical delivery of plasmid DNA. One huge benefit of this delivery technique is its malleability. The pulse protocol used for plasmid delivery can be fine-tuned to control the levels and duration of subsequent transgene expression. This fine-tuning allows transgene expression to be tailored to each therapeutic application. Effective and appropriate expression induces the desired clinical response that is a critical component for any gene therapy. This chapter focuses on clinical trials using in vivo electroporation or electrotransfer as a plasmid delivery method. The first clinical trial was initiated in 2004, and now more than fifty trials use electric fields for gene delivery.

There are evidences showing that some of the components of γ-oryzanol can modulate genes involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer, as caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and prostate specific androgen-regulated gene (PCGEM1).  Methods:   To determine the effects of γ-oryzanol on prostate cancer cell survival we evaluated the cell viability and biomass by MTT and sulforhodamine B assays, respectively. Cell death, cell cycle and pERK1/2 activity were assessed by flow cytometry. The changes in gene expression involved in the survival and progression of prostate cancer cav-1 and PCGEM1 genes were evaluated by quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cav-1 protein by immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopy analysis.  Results:   We found that γ-oryzanol decreases cell viability and culture biomass by apoptosis and/or necrosis death in androgen unresponsive (PC3 and DU145) and responsive (LNCaP) cell lines, and signals through pERK1/2 in LNCaP and DU145 cells. γ-oryzanol also appears to block cell cycle progression at the G2/M in PC3 and LNCaP cells and at G0/G1 in DU145 cells. These effects were accompanied by a down regulation in the expression of the cav-1 in both androgen unresponsive cell lines and PCGEM1 gene in DU145 and LNCaP cells.  Conclusion:   In summary, we used biochemical and genetics approaches to demonstrate that γ-oryzanol show a promising adjuvant role in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Gabriela E Hirsch', 'Mariana M Parisi', 'Leo A M Martins', 'Claudia M B Andrade', 'Florencia M Barbé-Tuana', 'Fátima T C R Guma']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Differential effects of cholesterol and phytosterols on cell proliferation, apoptosis and expression of a prostate specific gene in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Antioxidant effects of gamma-oryzanol on human prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of apoptosis by a prostate-specific and prostate cancer-associated noncoding gene, PCGEM1.', 'Gamma-oryzanol: an important component in rice brain oil.', 'Biological and Pharmacological Effects of Gamma-oryzanol: An Updated Review of the Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Anthocyanins in Red Jasmine Rice (Oryza sativa L.)

Methods:   The study involved 267 prostate cancer patients as cases (214 cases from Han population and 53 cases from Hui population) and 534 prostatic hyperplasia patients as controls (428 cases from Han population and 106 cases from Hui population). All the patients were collected from the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University during January of 2007 to September of 2013. The level of fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), total prostate specific antigen (T-PSA), free prostate specific antigen (F-PSA) and free/total prostate specific antigen (F/T-PSA) were collected from the clinical medical records of the patients. Data were analyzed by the conditional logistic regression method, and attributable risk proportion(ARP) was calculated.  Results:   In Hui population, the risk of prostate cancer for drinkers was 20.48 times higher than the non-drinkers (35.8% (19/53) to 5.7% (6/106), OR = 20.48, 95% CI: 4.95-84.66). The high level of F-PSA significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer for Hui group (83.0% (44/53) to 55.7% (59/106), OR = 4.27, 95%CI: 1.18-15.43). In contrast, the high TG level decreased the risk of prostate cancer for Hui group (18.9% (10/53) to 20.8% (22/106), OR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07-0.83). In Han population, the risk of prostate cancer for smokers was 1.89 times higher than the non-smokers (55.1% (118/214) to 39.7% (170/428), OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.28-2.78). Either high level of T-PSA or F-PSA increased the risk of prostate cancer for Han group (86.4% (185/214) to 53.7% (230/428),OR = 2.34, 95%CI:1.22-4.52;85.5% (183/214) to 56.1% (240/428), OR = 2.43, 95% CI:1.29-4.59). However, the high TG level or high ratio of F/T-PSA decreased the risk of prostate cancer (15.4% (33/214) to 18.7% (80/428), OR = 0.59, 95% CI:0.36-0.98; 53.3% (114/214) to 73.4% (314/428), OR = 0.53, 95% CI:0.36-0.78). The APRs of drinking and high level of F-PSA in Han populations were 66.6%, 62.4% in Hui populations , and the APRs of smoking and high level of T-PSA, high level of F-PSA were 33.8%, 71.3%, 67.3% in Han populations.  Conclusion:   Both drinking and high level of F-PSA might be the risky factors of prostate cancer while the high TG level might be protective factor for Hui group. However, for Han population, smoking, high T-PSA level, and high F-PSA level might be risky factors for prostate cancer while the high TG level and high ratio of F/T-PSA might be protective factors.

Understanding these differences may assist future studies on causes of prostate cancer. To address such, we leverage the unique resource of the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) combined with Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER).  Methods:   Prostate cancer counts and population denominators by race (black, white), age, calendar year, and U.S. census division, for the period 1999-2008, were extracted from NPCR and SEER. We calculated age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) and estimated annual percent changes (EAPC) by race and census division. We assessed black-to-white incidence rate ratios (BWIRR) by census division and by calendar period.  Results:   This analysis included 1,713,471 prostate cancer cases and 1,217 million person-years. Black ASRs ranged from 176 per 100,000 person-years in Mountain division to 259 in Middle Atlantic. BWIRRs ranged from 1.20 in Western divisions to 1.72 in Southeastern divisions. EAPCs indicated that prostate cancer incidence is not decreasing in East South Central, unlike all other divisions. White EAPCs displayed similar variations by census division, resulting in modest temporal changes in BWIRRs.  Conclusions:   Within the U.S., there exists significant geographic variability in prostate cancer incidence rates. Although there are large geographic differences in BWIRRs, temporal trends are fairly stable. This may indicate that primary factors affecting prostate cancer incidence rates vary geographically but affect both black and white men to a similar degree.""","""['Michael B Cook', 'Philip S Rosenberg', 'Frances A McCarty', 'Manxia Wu', 'Jessica King', 'Christie Eheman', 'William F Anderson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Trends in the Incidence of Fatal Prostate Cancer in the United States by Race.', 'Geographic Distribution of Racial Differences in Prostate Cancer Mortality.', 'Ultraviolet index and racial differences in prostate cancer incidence and mortality.', 'Prostate cancer in black and white Americans.', 'The epidemiology of prostate cancer in the United States.', 'An Up-to-date Assessment of US Prostate Cancer Incidence Rates by Stage and Race: A Novel Approach Combining Multiple Imputation with Age and Delay Adjustment.', 'Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Incidence, Distant Stage Diagnosis, and Mortality by U.S. Census Region and Age Group, 2012-2015.', 'A Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database analysis of the prognostic value of organ-specific metastases in patients with advanced prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Mortality Rate and Years of Life Lost Due to Prostate Cancer in Yazd Province, Iran: A 10-year study.', 'Prospective investigation of risk factors for prostate cancer in the UK Biobank cohort study.']"""

While adult weight gain has diverse advantages over body mass index in measuring adiposity, systematic reviews on adult weight gain in relation to adiposity-related cancers are lacking.  Methods:   PubMed and Embase were searched through September 2014 for prospective observational studies investigating the relationship between adult weight gain and the risk of 10 adiposity-related cancers. Dose-response meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model to estimate summary relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each cancer type. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   A total of 50 studies were included. For each 5kg increase in adult weight gain, the summary relative risk was 1.11 (95% CI = 1.08 to 1.13) for postmenopausal breast cancer among no- or low-hormone replacement therapy (HRT) users, 1.39 (95% CI = 1.29 to 1.49) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02 to 1.16) for postmenopausal endometrial cancer among HRT nonusers and users, respectively, 1.13 (95% CI = 1.03 to 1.23) for postmenopausal ovarian cancer among no or low HRT users, 1.09 (95% CI = 1.04 to 1.13) for colon cancer in men. The relative risk of kidney cancer comparing highest and lowest level of adult weight gain was 1.42 (95% CI = 1.11 to 1.81). Adult weight gain was unrelated to cancers of the breast (premenopausal women, postmenopausal HRT users), prostate, colon (women), pancreas, and thyroid. An increase in risk associated with adult weight gain for breast cancer was statistically significantly greater among postmenopausal women (P heterogeneity = .001) and HRT nonusers (P heterogeneity = .001); that for endometrial cancer was alike among HRT nonusers (P heterogeneity = .04).

Because miRNAs fulfill function via the regulation of their target genes and because the current number of experimentally validated targets is insufficient, some existing methods have inferred potential disease miRNAs based on the predicted targets. It is difficult for these methods to achieve excellent performance due to the high false-positive and false-negative rates for the target prediction results. Alternatively, several methods have constructed a network composed of miRNAs based on their associated diseases and have exploited the information within the network to predict the disease miRNAs. However, these methods have failed to take into account the prior information regarding the network nodes and the respective local topological structures of the different categories of nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop a method that exploits the more useful information to predict reliable disease miRNA candidates.  Results:   miRNAs with similar functions are normally associated with similar diseases and vice versa. Therefore, the functional similarity between a pair of miRNAs is calculated based on their associated diseases to construct a miRNA network. We present a new prediction method based on random walk on the network. For the diseases with some known related miRNAs, the network nodes are divided into labeled nodes and unlabeled nodes, and the transition matrices are established for the two categories of nodes. Furthermore, different categories of nodes have different transition weights. In this way, the prior information of nodes can be completely exploited. Simultaneously, the various ranges of topologies around the different categories of nodes are integrated. In addition, how far the walker can go away from the labeled nodes is controlled by restarting the walking. This is helpful for relieving the negative effect of noisy data. For the diseases without any known related miRNAs, we extend the walking on a miRNA-disease bilayer network. During the prediction process, the similarity between diseases, the similarity between miRNAs, the known miRNA-disease associations and the topology information of the bilayer network are exploited. Moreover, the importance of information from different layers of network is considered. Our method achieves superior performance for 18 human diseases with AUC values ranging from 0.786 to 0.945. Moreover, case studies on breast neoplasms, lung neoplasms, prostatic neoplasms and 32 diseases further confirm the ability of our method to discover potential disease miRNAs.

In the present study, we analysed the prognostic relevance of elevated plasma CRP levels in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.  Methods:   A total of 261 prostate cancer patients treated with 3D-conformal radiotherapy were evaluated retrospectively. Cancer specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS) and clinical disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. To evaluate the independent prognostic significance of CRP plasma levels, multivariate Cox regression models were applied.  Results:   The median follow-time was 80months. Applying receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, the optimal cut-off level for the plasma CRP was 8.6mgl(-1). An elevated CRP level was associated with decreased CSS in univariate (hazard ratio (HR) 3.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-7.91; p=0.006) and multivariate analysis (HR 4.31, 95% CI 1.22-15.1; p=0.023). Furthermore, a significant association with OS was detected in univariate (HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.57-4.59; p<0.001) and multivariate analyses (HR 3.24, 95% CI 1.84-5.71, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis also showed a significant association between plasma CRP and clinical DFS (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.02-4.17; p=0.043).  Conclusions:   In the present study, an elevated plasma CRP (⩾8.6mgl(-1)) has been identified as a prognostic factor for poor CSS, OS and DFS in prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. The association between elevated CRP levels and poor prognosis was independent of other measures of prognosis such as tumour stage, Gleason grading and prostate specific antigen (PSA) level at diagnosis.

Collimator and gantry angle adjustments can correct these rotations in intensity modulated radiation therapy. Modern volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatments, however, include a wide range of beam orientations that differ in modulation, and corrections require dynamic collimator rotations. The aim of this study was to implement a rotation correction strategy for VMAT dose delivery and validate it for left-right prostate rotations.  Methods and materials:   Clinical VMAT treatment plans of 5 prostate cancer patients were used. Simulated left-right prostate rotations between +15° and -15° were corrected by collimator rotations. We compared corrected and uncorrected plans by dose volume histograms, minimum dose (Dmin) to the prostate, bladder surface receiving ≥78 Gy (S78) and rectum equivalent uniform dose (EUD; n=0.13). Each corrected plan was delivered to a phantom, and its deliverability was evaluated by γ-evaluation between planned and delivered dose, which was reconstructed from portal images acquired during delivery.  Results:   On average, clinical target volume minimum dose (Dmin) decreased up to 10% without corrections. Negative left-right rotations were corrected almost perfectly, whereas Dmin remained within 4% for positive rotations. Bladder S78 and rectum EUD of the corrected plans matched those of the original plans. The average pass rate for the corrected plans delivered to the phantom was 98.9% at 3% per 3 mm gamma criteria. The measured dose in the planning target volume approximated the original dose, rotated around the simulated left-right angle, well.  Conclusions:   It is feasible to dynamically adjust the collimator angle during VMAT treatment delivery to correct for prostate rotations. This technique can safely correct for left-right prostate rotations up to 15°.""","""['Johan de Boer', 'Anne Lisa Wolf', 'Yenny Z Szeto', 'Marcel van Herk', 'Jan-Jakob Sonke']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Strategies for online organ motion correction for intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer: prostate, rectum, and bladder dose effects.', 'Strategy for online correction of rotational organ motion for intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Variations in dosimetric distribution and plan complexity with collimator angles in hypofractionated volumetric arc radiotherapy for treating prostate cancer.', 'Radiation therapy to the head and neck.

Downregulation of HLA-I is observed in primary and metastatic prostate cancers, which facilitates them escape from immune surveillance, thereby promotes prostate cancer progression. In addition, elevated level of growth factors like TGF-β or EGF in microenvironment is related to the prostate cancer deterioration. Thus, we wondered whether TGF-β or EGF was involved in the regulation of HLA-I during the development of prostate cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated that TGF-β and EGF both downregulated the expression of HLA-I, thereby attenuated the cytotoxic T cell mediated lysis of prostate cancer cells. Next, we revealed that TGF-β and EGF induced downregulation of HLA-I is associated with classical epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) morphological changes and expression profiles. We further illustrated that overexpression of Snail is crucial for HLA-I downregulation and its association with EMT. At last, we discussed that NF-κB/p65 is the plausible target for Snail to induce HLA-I downregulation. Taken together, this is the first evidence to reveal that both TGF-β and EGF can induce HLA-I downregulation which is then proven to be associated with EMT in prostate cancer cells.

In phase II, patients received LEN at 25 mg (day 1-21) with CTX at 50 mg PO QD (day 1-28) on a 28-day cycle. Nineteen patients in phase I were evaluable for toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not observed at any of the dose levels (DLs) tested. Six patients received treatment in phase II before the trial was closed. A ≥ 50% reduction in PSA was observed in 31.7% evaluable patients. Radiographically, one patient had a partial response. Stable disease was documented in 68% of evaluable patients after two therapy cycles. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) decreased in 22.7% and remained stable in 31.8% of patients. Baseline numbers of peripheral MDSCs (MDSC; Lin-DR(-)CD11b(+)) were significantly increased in patients versus normal donors, and were decreased by chemotherapy. At baseline, MDSCs correlated directly with CTCs, and inversely with T- and B cell frequency supporting their immunosuppressive activity. The combination of LEN and metronomic CTX can be safely administered, reversing cellular immunosuppression in this group of elderly patients with mCRPC.

NR2F1-dependent dormancy is recapitulated by a co-treatment with the DNA-demethylating agent 5-Aza-C and retinoic acid across various cancer types. NR2F1-induced quiescence is dependent on SOX9, RARβ and CDK inhibitors. Intriguingly, NR2F1 induces global chromatin repression and the pluripotency gene NANOG, which contributes to dormancy of DTCs in the bone marrow.

Materials and methods:   A549 and H1299 lung carcinoma, MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma, U87MG and T98G glioblastoma, DU145 and PC3 prostate carcinoma and MRC5 normal fetal lung fibroblasts cell lines were studied. After 3-day exposure to 34°C, 37°C and 40°C, cell viability was determined. Cell proliferation (ki67 index), apoptosis (Caspase 9) and HSP90 expression was studied by confocal microscopy.  Results:   Viability/proliferation experiments demonstrated that MRC5 fibroblasts were extremely sensitive to hyperthermia, while they were the most resistant to hypothermia. T98G and A549 were thermo-tolerant, the remaining being thermo-sensitive to a varying degree. Nonetheless, as a universal effect, hypothermia reduced viability/proliferation in all cell lines. Hyperthermia sharply induced Caspase 9 in the U87MG most thermo-sensitive cell line. In T98G and A549 thermo-tolerant cell lines, the levels of Caspase 9 declined. Moreover, hyperthermia strongly induced the HSP90 levels in T98G, whilst a sharp decrease was recorded in the thermo-sensitive PC3 and U87MG cell lines. Hyperthermia sensitized thermo-sensitive cancer cell lines to cisplatin and temozolomide, whilst its sensitizing effect was diminished in thermo-tolerant cell lines.  Conclusions:   The existence of thermo-tolerant and thermo-sensitive cancer cell lines was confirmed, which further encourages research to classify human tumor thermic predilection for patient stratification in clinical trials. Of interest, mild hypothermia had a universal suppressing effect on cancer cell proliferation, further supporting the radio-sensitization hypothesis through reduction of oxygen and metabolic demands.""","""['Dimitra Kalamida', 'Ilias V Karagounis', 'Achilleas Mitrakas', 'Sofia Kalamida', 'Alexandra Giatromanolaki', 'Michael I Koukourakis']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['APE1/REF-1 down-regulation enhances the cytotoxic effects of temozolomide in a resistant glioblastoma cell line.', 'Inhibition of 90-kD heat shock protein potentiates the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in human glioma cells.', 'Combined effect of temozolomide and hyperthermia on human melanoma cell growth and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity.', 'Thermo-Sensitive Vesicles in Controlled Drug Delivery for Chemotherapy.', 'Stem Cell Behavior at Hypothermia: A Review Article.', 'Transcriptional Regulation of the Colorectal Cancer Stem Cell Markers, Nanog and Oct4, Induced by a Thermodynamic-Based Therapy Approach.', 'Cytostatic hypothermia and its impact on glioblastoma and survival.', 'Comparative heating efficiency and cytotoxicity of magnetic silica nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia treatment on human breast cancer cells.', 'Confined migration induces heterochromatin formation and alters chromatin accessibility.', 'Development of a Highly Responsive Organofluorine Temperature Sensor for 19F Magnetic Resonance Applications.']"""

Methods:   This was an imaging companion trial (American College of Radiology Imaging Network [ACRIN] 6687) to a multicenter metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tissue biomarker-guided therapeutic trial (NCT00918385). Men with bone metastatic CRPC underwent (18)F-fluoride PET before and 12 weeks after initiation of dasatinib (100 mg daily). Dynamic imaging was performed over a 15-cm field of view for trial assessments. The primary endpoint was to determine whether changes in (18)F-fluoride incorporation in tumor and normal bone occurred in response to dasatinib. Other endpoints included differential effect of dasatinib between (18)F-fluoride incorporation in tumor and normal bone, (18)F-fluoride transport in bone metastases, correlation with progression-free survival (PFS), prostate-specific antigen, and markers of bone turnover.  Results:   Eighteen participants enrolled, and 17 underwent interpretable baseline (18)F-fluoride PET imaging before initiation of dasatinib. Twelve of 17 patients underwent on-treatment PET imaging. Statistically significant changes in response to dasatinib were identified by the SUVmaxavg (average of maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax] for up to 5 tumors within the dynamic field of view) in bone metastases (P = 0.0002), with a significant differential (18)F-fluoride PET response between tumor and normal bone (P < 0.0001).

Treatment of human gastric cancer cells with YM155 differentially induced cell death dependent on the stability of cIAP1 as well as survivin. Transfection with cIAP1 expression plasmids decreased cell sensitivity to YM155, whereas knockdown of endogenous cIAP1 using RNA interference enhanced sensitivity to YM155. In addition, double knockdown of survivin and cIAP1 significantly induced cell death in the YM155-resistant cell line, MKN45. We also showed that YM155 induced autoubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of cIAP1. Surprisingly, survivin affected the stability of cIAP1 through binding, contributing to cell sensitivity to YM155.

Experimental design:   To define functional roles of ARFL and AR-Vs in ENZ-R CRPC, we designed 3 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting exon-1, intron-1, and exon-8 in AR pre-mRNA to knockdown ARFL alone or with AR-Vs, and examined their effects in three CRPC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts.  Results:   ENZ-R-LNCaP cells express high levels of both ARFL and AR-V7 compared with CRPC-LNCaP; in particular, ARFL levels were approximately 12-fold higher than AR-V7. Both ARFL and AR-V7 are highly expressed in the nuclear fractions of ENZ-R-LNCaP cells even in the absence of exogenous androgens. In ENZ-R-LNCaP cells, knockdown of ARFL alone, or ARFL plus AR-Vs, similarly induced apoptosis, suppressed cell growth and AR-regulated gene expression, and delayed tumor growth in vivo. In 22Rv1 cells that are inherently ENZ-resistant, knockdown of both ARFL and AR-Vs more potently suppressed cell growth, AR transcriptional activity, and AR-regulated gene expression than knockdown of ARFL alone. Exon-1 AR-ASO also inhibited tumor growth of LTL-313BR patient-derived CRPC xenografts.  Conclusions:   These data identify the AR as an important driver of ENZ resistance, and while the contributions of ARFL and AR-Vs can vary across cell systems, ARFL is the key driver in the ENZ-R LNCaP model.

This technique will prove to be valuable to radiotherapy departments that are looking to optimise their CBCT imaging protocols as it allows a rapid evaluation of the impact of any changes on patient dose.

The aim of the strategy is to appoint patients with potentially lethal prostate cancer to curatively intended treatment, while patients with slowly evolving tumours are spared from an unnecessary curative intervention.  Material and methods:   All data included were derived from a single-institution active surveillance cohort of 317 patients which was followed prospectively at Rigshospitalet from 2002 until 2013. The patients were managed with serial PSA measurements, repeated biopsies, and regular digital rectal examinations. The programme recommended change of management from active surveillance to curatively intended treatment based on PSA doubling time, deteriorating histopathology in repeated prostatic biopsies, and increased clinical tumour category.  Results:   The programme entailed close monitoring during the first 5 years with 3-4 out-patient contacts annually. Altogether, 2-3 biopsy sessions were performed in most patients. Complications necessitating hospital admissions arose in almost 10% of the repeated biopsy sessions. The 5-year cumulative incidence of curatively intended treatment was estimated to be 39.5%. Active surveillance resulted in a 34.8% cost-reduction following 3.7 years compared to the estimated cost of immediate radical prostatectomy. The calculated PSA doubling times were associated with wide 95% confidence intervals, which resulted in a significant risk of being misclassified according to the definition of progression. The interobserver agreement of biopsy histopathology between expert uropathologist was substantial. Still, the pathologists' disagreement would have resulted in different treatment recommendations in up to 10% of the re-evaluated biopsies. Neither PSA doubling time nor increased clinical tumour category was associated with final histopathological findings following subsequent radical prostatectomy. Although the level of significance was only met in univariate analysis, biopsy progression was associated with defined final histopathological findings at radical prostatectomy that was perceived as unacceptable for a continued observational strategy.  Conclusion:   The thesis has demonstrated that active surveillance is feasible and reduces the number of patients undergoing curative intended treatment.

This study investigated the expression and prognostic significance of PTOV1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction and western blot analysis were performed to examine PTOV1 expression in 11 HCC cell lines and 2 normal hepatic cell lines. PTOV1 expression levels were also determined in 8 pairs of tissue samples taken from primary HCC tumors and the matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissue from the same patient. Immunohistochemistry assays assessed PTOV1 protein expression in paraffin-embedded clinical samples taken from 215 HCC patients. The correlation of PTOV1 expression with the clinicopathological parameters was evaluated along with the prognostic impact of PTOV1 expression in these HCC patients. PTOV1 mRNA and protein were overexpressed in HCC cell lines compared with normal liver cell lines and were overexpressed in primary HCC samples compared with the matched noncancerous liver tissue samples. In the paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 215 HCC patients, PTOV1 protein expression was significantly correlated with T classification, N classification, clinical stage, and serum α-fetoprotein. HCC patients with higher PTOV1 expression had shorter survival times than patients with lower PTOV1 expression.

The major mechanisms underlying such resistance are androgen receptor (AR) overexpression, androgen-independent activation of AR, and AR mutation. To address this problem, we developed an AR pure antagonist, CH5137291, with AR nuclear translocation-inhibiting activity, and compared its activity and characteristics with that of bicalutamide. Cell lines corresponding to the mechanisms of castration resistance were used: LNCaP-BC2 having AR overexpression and LNCaP-CS10 having androgen-independent AR activation. VCaP and LNCaP were used as hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells. In vitro functional assay clearly showed that CH5137291 inhibited the nuclear translocation of wild-type ARs as well as W741C- and T877A-mutant ARs. In addition, it acted as a pure antagonist on the transcriptional activity of these types of ARs. In contrast, bicalutamide did not inhibit the nuclear translocation of these ARs, and showed a partial/full agonistic effect on the transcriptional activity. CH5137291 inhibited cell growth more strongly than bicalutamide in VCaP and LNCaP cells as well as in LNCaP-BC2 and LNCaP-CS10 cells in vitro. In xenograft models, CH5137291 strongly inhibited the tumor growth of LNCaP, LNCaP-BC2, and LNCaP-CS10, whereas bicalutamide showed a weaker effect in LNCaP and almost no effect in LNCaP-BC2 and LNCaP-CS10 xenografts. Levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in plasma correlated well with the antitumor effect of both agents. CH5137291 inhibited the growth of LNCaP tumors that had become resistant to bicalutamide treatment. A docking model suggested that CH5137291 intensively collided with the M895 residue of helix 12, and therefore strongly inhibited the folding of helix 12, a cause of AR agonist activity, in wild-type and W741C-mutant ARs. In cynomolgus monkeys, the serum concentration of CH5137291 increased dose-dependently and PSA level decreased 80% at 100 mg/kg.

We applied a previously generated nomogram based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to predict active surveillance eligibility based on repeat biopsy outcomes.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of 85 patients who met active surveillance criteria at study entry based on initial biopsy and who then underwent 3.0 Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with subsequent magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion guided prostate biopsy between 2007 and 2012. We assessed the accuracy of a previously published nomogram in patients on active surveillance before confirmatory biopsy. For each cutoff we determined the number of biopsies avoided (ie reliance on magnetic resonance imaging alone without rebiopsy) over the full range of nomogram cutoffs.  Results:   We assessed the performance of the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging active surveillance nomogram based on a decision to perform biopsy at various nomogram generated probabilities. Based on cutoff probabilities of 19% to 32% on the nomogram the number of patients who could be spared repeat biopsy was 27% to 68% of the active surveillance cohort. The sensitivity of the test in this interval was 97% to 71% and negative predictive value was 91% to 81%.  Conclusions:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging based nomograms may reasonably decrease the number of repeat biopsies in patients on active surveillance by as much as 68%.

These men originated either from the prospective population-based screening program (P-AS) or were diagnosed by opportunistic screening (O-AS).  Results:   Overall, n = 86 (45.0%) originated from the P-AS group, whereas n = 105 (55.0%) from the O-AS group.

Patients and methods:   38,861 prostate cancer patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2010 and living in the catchment area of the Munich Cancer Registry were analysed.  Results:   Pre-therapeutic prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increased substantially in the early 1990s. A shift from capsule-exceeding tumours to capsule-limited tumours also took place especially in the 1990s. The proportion of radical prostatectomy increased continuously over the last 20 years from 20% to almost 50% whereas hormone therapy decreased from 55% to 18%. Radiation therapy and transurethral resection of the prostate increased slightly from about 5% to 10%. The 5- and 10-year relative survival rates increased from 92% to 97% and from 86% to 92%, respectively.  Conclusions:   2 reasons may account for the rise in survival rates over 20 years: First, the establishment of widely used PSA testing resulted in a shift towards more favourable T categories due to the detection of many additional small tumours as well as the noticeable change in initial treatment strategy towards more radical prostatectomies.

However, it is unclear how self-organization by this mechanism remains robust when interfacial energies become heterogeneous in either time or space. The ducts and acini of the human mammary gland are prototypical heterogeneous and dynamic tissues comprising two concentrically arranged cell types. To investigate the consequences of cellular heterogeneity and plasticity on cell positioning in the mammary gland, we reconstituted its self-organization from aggregates of primary cells in vitro. We find that self-organization is dominated by the interfacial energy of the tissue-ECM boundary, rather than by differential homo- and heterotypic energies of cell-cell interaction. Surprisingly, interactions with the tissue-ECM boundary are binary, in that only one cell type interacts appreciably with the boundary. Using mathematical modeling and cell-type-specific knockdown of key regulators of cell-cell cohesion, we show that this strategy of self-organization is robust to severe perturbations affecting cell-cell contact formation. We also find that this mechanism of self-organization is conserved in the human prostate.

Its function in prostate cancer, however, is unknown.  Methods:   Stable shRNA silencing was achieved in naturally overexpressing prostate cancer cells, followed by Affymetrix expression analysis. Fold changes of ⩾2 and ⩽-2 were considered valid and t-tests P-values of ⩽0.01 were considered statistically significant. Potential EGR3 target genes were validated by real-time qPCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gain-of-function experiments. Promoter analysis confirmed the presence of consensus binding sites in the promoters of target genes.  Results:   Early Growth Response 3 regulates the expression of ∼330 genes, 35% of which are involved in immune responses and inflammatory processes, and 15% crosstalk with the NF-κB signalling pathway. In particular, EGR3 induces the expression of over 50 secreted cytokines, growth factors, and matrix remodelling factors. Two interleukins of great relevance to prostate cancer, IL6 and IL8, were further validated as EGR3 target genes: both promoters contain EGR consensus binding sites and are pulled down in intact cells by EGR3 chromatin immunoprecipitation. Silencing of EGR3 decreased IL6 and IL8 expression, whereas overexpression of EGR3 in nontransformed cells induced IL6 and IL8 expression.  Conclusions:   Chronic inflammation plays a critical role in prostate cancer and elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL8 and IL6, in particular, contributes to disease progression and to the onset of castration resistance. It is shown for the first time that EGR3 is involved in the upregulation of both IL6 and IL8. Together with our previous observation that EGR3 is highly expressed in prostate tumours compared with normal tissue and strongly correlates with IL6 and IL8 expression in clinical samples, the present study suggests that EGR3 promotes excessive production of IL6 and IL8 observed during the progression of prostate cancer.""","""['V T Baron', 'R Pio', 'Z Jia', 'D Mercola']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Early growth response 3 (Egr3) is highly over-expressed in non-relapsing prostate cancer but not in relapsing prostate cancer.', 'Overexpressing miR‑335 inhibits DU145 cell proliferation by targeting early growth response 3 in prostate cancer.', 'Loss of EGR3 is an independent risk factor for metastatic progression in prostate cancer.', 'Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines initiate multiple prostate cancer biologic pathways of cellular proliferation, heterogeneity and metastasis in a racially diverse population and underlie the genetic/biologic mechanism of racial disparity: Update.', 'Early growth response 2 and Egr3 are unique regulators in immune system.', 'Long noncoding RNA antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus inhibition alleviates airway remodeling in asthma through the regulation of the microRNA-7-5p/early growth response factor 3 axis.', 'The EGR3 regulome of infant KMT2A-r acute lymphoblastic leukemia identifies differential expression of B-lineage genes predictive for outcome.', 'Epigenome-Wide Association Studies of the Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide and Bronchodilator Drug Response in Moderate-to-Severe Pediatric Asthma.', 'Intrafusal-fiber LRP4 for muscle spindle formation and maintenance in adult and aged animals.', 'The Immediate Early Response of Lens Epithelial Cells to Lens Injury.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 87,415 patients in the NCDB who underwent minimally invasive radical prostatectomy between 2010 and 2011. We compared surgical outcomes and treatment facility characteristics between converted and nonconverted cases. Multivariable analysis was done to evaluate conversion risk factors.  Results:   There were 82,338 robot-assisted (94%) and 5,077 laparoscopic (6%) radical prostatectomies, and 1,080 conversions (1.2%). Fewer robot-assisted cases were converted than laparoscopic cases (0.9% vs 6.5%, p <0.001). The median yearly treatment facility volume of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy was 32 (IQR 10-72). Patients who underwent conversion were more likely to be rehospitalized within 30 days (4.4% vs 2.7%, p = 0.002) and have a postoperative hospital stay of greater than 2 days (40.4% vs 15.1%, p <0.001) than those without conversion. Facilities in the lowest quartile of the yearly volume of the minimally invasive procedure represented 3.8% of minimally invasive radical prostatectomies but accounted for 22.9% of conversions. The second, third and fourth quartiles of yearly treatment facility minimally invasive volume predicted a lower likelihood of conversion compared to the first quartile (each p <0.001). Facility type (eg academic or community) did not predict conversion. Black race (vs white OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.24-1.86, p <0.001) and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (OR 4.68, 95% CI 3.79-5.78, p <0.001) predicted higher odds of conversion.  Conclusions:   Open conversion during minimally invasive radical prostatectomy is a rare event. However, it is significantly more likely for pure laparoscopic surgery, in black men and at low volume facilities.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously approved the therapeutic vaccine, sipuleucel-T, which is composed of autologous antigen-presenting cells cultured with a fusion protein [prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF)]. Although sipuleucel-T has been shown to prolong the median survival of patients for 4.1 months, more robust therapeutic effects may be expected by modifying the vaccination protocol. In the present study, we aimed to develop and validate a novel vaccination strategy using multiple PAP-fused cytokines for prostate cancer treatment. Using a super gene expression (SGE) system that we previously established to amplify the production of a recombinant protein, significant amounts of PAP-fused cytokines [human GMCSF, interleukin-2 (IL2), IL4, IL7 and mouse GMCSF and IL4] were obtained. We examined the activity of the fusion proteins in vitro to validate their cytokine functions. A significant upregulation of dendritic cell differentiation from monocytes was achieved by PAP-GMCSF when used with the other PAP-fused cytokines. The PAP-fused human IL2 significantly increased the proliferation of lymphocytes, as determined by flow cytometry. We also investigated the in vivo therapeutic effects of multiple PAP-fused cytokines in a mouse prostate cancer model bearing prostate-specific antigen (PSA)- and PAP-expressing tumors. The simultaneous intraperitoneal administration of PAP-GMCSF, -IL2, -IL4 and -IL7 significantly prevented tumor induction and inhibited the tumor growth in the PAP-expressing tumors, yet not in the PSA-expressing tumors. The in vivo therapeutic effects with the multiple PAP-fused cytokines were superior to the effects of PAP-GMCSF alone. We thus demonstrated the advantages of the combined use of multiple PAP-fused cytokines including PAP-GMCSF, and propose a promising prostatic antigen-vaccination strategy to enhance the therapeutic effects.""","""['Kei Fujio', 'Masami Watanabe', 'Hideo Ueki', 'Shun-Ai Li', 'Rie Kinoshita', 'Kazuhiko Ochiai', 'Junichiro Futami', 'Toyohiko Watanabe', 'Yasutomo Nasu', 'Hiromi Kumon']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Novel prostate acid phosphatase-based peptide vaccination strategy induces antigen-specific T-cell responses and limits tumour growth in mice.', 'Dual antigen target-based immunotherapy for prostate cancer eliminates the growth of established tumors in mice.', 'Immunotherapy of hormone-refractory prostate cancer with antigen-loaded dendritic cells.', 'Development of sipuleucel-T: autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Vaccine therapy with sipuleucel-T (Provenge) for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Vaccines for Genitourinary Tumors: Recent Progresses and Future Possibilities.', 'Immunotherapy of prostate cancer using novel synthetic DNA vaccines targeting multiple tumor antigens.', 'Probing the toxic mechanism of bisphenol A with acid phosphatase at the molecular level.', 'Immunotherapy as a Promising Treatment for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Nanoparticles for Effective Combination Therapy of Cancer.']"""

The bone is the third most common site of metastasis.  Methods:   This is a retrospective study of patients with metastatic bone disease who were referred to the Orthopaedic Department of University Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia, between January 2004 and October 2009.  Results:   A total of 151 patients (51.0% men, 49.0% women) had metastatic bone disease, with the highest incidence at the age range of 50-59 years. The commonest primary cancer was breast (23.3%), followed by lung (21.2%), prostate (9.3%), thyroid (7.3%) and renal cell carcinoma (5.3%); unknown primary cancer was 6.6%. There was long bone involvement in 52.7% of cases, axial bone in 44.5%, and both long and axial bones in 2.8%. The majority (90.1%) were symptomatic, with pain as the commonest symptom. 106 (70.2%) patients had pathological fractures. Neurological deficit was reported in 90.7% of patients, with 41.1% having extraskeletal metastases. 67.8% of the lesions were osteolytic, 24.3% were sclerotic, and 7.9%, mixed. Palliative and therapeutic interventions were undertaken for 62.0% of patients. The mean survival times were: breast 21.0; thyroid 20.7; prostate 20.3; lung 16.0; and unknown primary cancer 32.6 months.  Conclusion:   In our study, breast and lung cancers were the commonest primary cancers in metastatic bone disease. Most patients had more than one site of involvement, pain at presentation and pathological fractures. Surgery is beneficial to relieve pain and improve function and neurology.

The study was performed on the hormone-resistant cell line PC-3. Cells were treated with clinically relevant concentrations of docetaxel and zoledronic acid either as single agents or in sequence and combination. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed along with the prenylation status of the GTPases Ras and RhoA. Following 1-mM zoledronic acid treatment, inhibition of the prenylation of H-Ras and Rho A was observed along with an increase in the unprenylated form in the cytoplasm. Docetaxel 1 nM and zoledronic acid 1 mM also showed an increase in the unprenylated form of both small GTP-binding proteins in the cytoplasm and a reduction of protein in the membrane fraction. Overall, zoledronic acid followed by docetaxel was the best regimen producing the greatest reduction in cell viability and increase in apoptosis. At the highest concentrations of zoledronic acid and docetaxel, zoledronic acid followed by docetaxel was also the most effective at reducing the prenylation of both H-Ras and RhoA at the membrane. We have demonstrated that clinically achievable concentrations of zoledronic acid and docetaxel cause a reduction in the prenylation of both H-Ras and Rho A and a reduction of protein movement into the membrane.

Mice with ""humanized"" AR (hAR) alleles that modified AR transcriptional strength by varying polyglutamine tract (Q-tract) length were crossed with mice expressing a prostate-specific, AR-responsive ETV1 transgene (ETV1(Tg)). While hAR allele did not grossly affect ETV1-induced neoplasia, ETV1 strongly antagonized global AR regulation and repressed critical androgen-induced differentiation and tumor suppressor genes, such as Nkx3-1 and Hoxb13. When Pten was varied to determine its impact on disease progression, mice lacking one Pten allele (Pten(+/-) ) developed more frequent prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Yet, only those with the ETV1 transgene progressed to invasive adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, progression was more frequent with the short Q-tract (stronger) AR, suggesting that the AR, ETV1, and PTEN pathways cooperate in aggressive disease. On the Pten(+/-) background, ETV1 had markedly less effect on AR target genes. However, a strong inflammatory gene expression signature, notably upregulation of Cxcl16, was induced by ETV1. Comparison of mouse and human patient data stratified by the presence of E26 transformation-specific ETS fusion genes highlighted additional factors, some not previously associated with prostate cancer but for which targeted therapies are in development for other diseases.

In the present study, we examined whether methyl supplementation with the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) inhibits prostate cancer associated skeletal metastasis.  Experimental approach:   Highly invasive human prostate cancer cells PC-3 and DU-145 were treated with vehicle alone, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) or SAM and their effects on tumour cell proliferation, invasion, migration and colony formation were monitored. For in vivo studies, control (SAH) and SAM-treated PC-3 cells were injected into the tibia of Fox chase SCID mice and skeletal lesions were determined by X-ray and μCT. To understand possible mechanisms involved, we delineated the effect of SAM on the genome-wide methylation profile of PC-3 cells.  Key results:   Treatment with SAM resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumour cell proliferation, invasion, cell migration, colony formation and cell cycle characteristics. Animals injected with 250 μM SAM-treated cells developed significantly smaller skeletal lesions, which were associated with increases in bone volume to tumour volume ratio and connectivity density as well as decreased trabecular spacing. Genome-wide methylation analysis showed differential methylation in several key signalling pathways implicated in prostate cancer including the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. A selective STAT3 inhibitor decreased tumour cell invasion, effects which were less pronounced as compared with SAM.

Such is true for cancer tissues arising in the prostate. However, the precise role of stromal tissue in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate adenocarcinoma is not well described. We undertook this current investigation to examine the changes in orientation of the extracellular matrix and correlate with prostatic cancer progression. We used a novel form of image analysis called gray level entropy matrix (GLEM) texture analysis to evaluate morphometric changes in stromal tissues. We used normal prostatic tissue obtained from cadaveric specimen and compared with BPH, prostatic intraepithelium neoplastic, hormone responsive prostatic adenocarcinoma and castration-resistant prostatic adenocarcinoma tissues. GLEM showed higher entropy in disease-resistant prostatic tissues, compared with benign forms of all spectra of pathologically diagnosed prostatic tissues (P < 0.05, ANOVA, between groups). Higher entropy is reflective of the disorganized morphological organization of the stroma, possibly reflecting the reactive matrix. In contrast, ELISA revealed that although individually correlated with the progressive stages of benign and carcinomatous prostatic tissues and trend correlation between groups, intergroup comparisons failed to arrive at statistical significance of comparisons between markers of neovasculogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (beta1-integrin, E-cadherin, MMP3) and osteogenic metastasis (RANKL and osteoprotegerin).

We aim to investigate biological significance of NFATc1, a NFAT isoform shown to function as an oncogene in a sarcoma model, in human prostate cancer.  Methods:   We first determined the expression levels of NFAT in prostate cell lines and tissue specimens. We then assessed the effects of NFAT inhibition via NFATc1-small interfering RNA (siRNA) as well as immunosuppressants including cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) on prostate cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression levels of NFATc1 were significantly elevated in prostatic carcinomas, compared with non-neoplastic prostate or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia tissues, and in high-grade (Gleason scores ≥7) tumors. NFATc1 positivity in carcinomas, as an independent prognosticator, also correlated with the risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. In prostate cancer cell lines, CsA and FK506 inhibited NFATc1 expression and its nuclear translocation, NFAT transcriptional activity, and the expression of c-myc, a downstream target of NFAT. NFAT silencing or treatment with these NFAT inhibitors resulted in decreases in cell viability/colony formation and cell migration/invasion, as well as increases in apoptosis, in androgen receptor (AR)-negative, AR-positive/androgen-sensitive, and AR-positive/castration-resistant lines. No significant additional inhibition in the growth of NFAT-siRNA cells by CsA and FK506 was seen, whereas these agents, especially FK506, further inhibited their invasion. In xenograft-bearing mice, CsA and FK506 significantly retarded tumor growth.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that NFATc1 plays an important role in prostate cancer outgrowth. Thus, NFATc1 inactivation, especially using CsA and FK506, has the potential of being a therapeutic approach for not only hormone-naïve but also castration-resistant prostate cancers.""","""['Takashi Kawahara', 'Eiji Kashiwagi', 'Hiroki Ide', 'Yi Li', 'Yichun Zheng', 'Hitoshi Ishiguro', 'Hiroshi Miyamoto']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Cyclosporine A and tacrolimus inhibit bladder cancer growth through down-regulation of NFATc1.', 'Cyclosporine A and tacrolimus inhibit urothelial tumorigenesis.', 'The immunophilin ligands cyclosporin A and FK506 suppress prostate cancer cell growth by androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms.', 'Selective inhibitors of nuclear factor of activated T cells: potential therapeutic drugs for the treatment of immunological and inflammatory diseases.', 'Isoform-Selective NFAT Inhibitor: Potential Usefulness and Development.', 'Proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of human lung cancer cells are associated with NFATc1.', 'Role of prostate cancer stem-like cells in the development of antiandrogen resistance.', 'Morphological Characteristics and Transcriptome Landscapes of Chicken Follicles during Selective Development.', 'Decoding the Phosphatase Code: Regulation of Cell Proliferation by Calcineurin.', 'Drug repositioning by merging active subnetworks validated in cancer and COVID-19.']"""

Methods:   Using cross-sectional data and validated scales, we investigated the extent to which clinical, demographic, belief, and personality characteristics are associated with emotional distress assessed with the Distress Thermometer in 1425 men newly diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer (pretreatment).  Results:   Beliefs potentially amenable to psychoeducational interventions [low self-efficacy for decision-making (B =-0.11, p = 0.02), low confidence in cancer control (B =-0.03, p < 0.001), and masculine identity threat (B =-0.26, p = 0.001)] were associated with higher emotional distress, as well as personality factors [low optimism (B =-0.04, p = 0.052) and low resilience (B =-0.83, p < 0.001)].  Conclusions:   Findings provide a framework for the development of interventions for prostate cancer patients with elevated emotional distress.

Androgens have been recognized as a major promoter of PCa development and progression. However, the mechanism of androgen action in PCa, especially in PCa cell invasion and metastasis remains largely unclear. SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor-1 (SMURF1) is a C2-WW-HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays important roles in cancer cell metastasis. Whether there is a relationship between androgens and SMURF1 expression is not known.  Methods:   The effect of androgens on the expression of SMURF1 in PCa cell lines was examined by Western blot analyses and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Gene transfection was performed by electroporation to manipulate the expression levels of proteins studied. The binding of AR to the SMURF1 gene enhancer was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Cell migration and invasion was measured by wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively.  Results:   We found that expression of SMURF1 is upregulated by androgens in PCa cell lines and that this effect of androgens is mediated through the androgen receptor (AR). We further showed that androgens regulate SMURF1 expression at transcriptional level and provided evidence that AR transcriptionally activates SMURF1 by binding to its enhancer that contains a canonical half androgen responsive element (ARE). Finally, we demonstrated that SMURF1 is important for androgen-induced invasion of PCa cells.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate for the first time that SMURF1 is a bona fide target gene of the AR.

A responder is described by a piecewise linear function, represented by an intercept, a PSA decline rate, a period of PSA decline, and a PSA rising rate; a nonresponder is described by an increasing linear function with an intercept and a PSA rising rate. Each trajectory is classified as a linear or a piecewise linear function with a certain probability, and the weighted average of these two functions sufficiently characterizes a variety of patterns of PSA trajectories. Furthermore, this mixture structure enables us to derive clinically useful endpoints such as a response rate and time-to-progression, as well as biologically meaningful endpoints such as a cancer cell killing fraction and tumor growth delay. We compare our model with the most commonly used dynamic model in the literature and show its advantages. Finally, we illustrate our approach using data from two multicenter prostate cancer trials.

Despite this, there is a trend for the increasing adoption of RARP at great cost to health services across the world. The aim was to critically analyze the learning curve and outcomes for LRP and RARP for two experience- and volume-matched surgeons who have completed the learning curve for LRP and RARP.  Patients and methods:   Two experience- and volume-matched LRP and RARP surgeons who have completed the learning curve were compared with respect to their learning curve and outcomes for RARP and LRP. There were 531 RARP and 550 LRPs analyzed from April 2003 until January 2012 at two relatively high-volume United Kingdom centers. Outcome measures included operative time, blood loss, complication rate (Clavien-Dindo grade III), positive surgical margin (PSM) rate, and early continence rate.  Results:   Learning curves for blood loss, operative times, and complication rate were similar between groups. The overall PSM rate and pT2 PSM rate learning curves were longer for RARP compared with LRP but shorter for early continence. Apical PSM showed no learning curve for RARP; however, a long learning curve for LRP and the rate was lower for RARP than for LRP (P=<0.001).  Conclusions:   This study of RARP and LRP identified that both modalities had long learning curves. Despite the long learning curve for RARP, significant benefits in lower PSM rates and better early continence in comparison with LRP exist. There are benefits to patients with RARP over LRP, especially those linked to better apical dissection (apical PSM and early continence).""","""['Daniel W Good', 'Grant D Stewart', 'Alexander Laird', 'Jens-Uwe Stolzenburg', 'Declan Cahill', 'S Alan McNeill']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Learning curve of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: Comprehensive evaluation and cumulative summation analysis of oncological outcomes.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy learning curve for experienced laparoscopic surgeons: does it really exist?', 'Superior Biochemical Recurrence and Long-term Quality-of-life Outcomes Are Achievable with Robotic Radical Prostatectomy After a Long Learning Curve-Updated Analysis of a Prospective Single-surgeon Cohort of 2206 Consecutive Cases.', 'Retropubic, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a critical review of outcomes reported by high-volume centers.', 'The learning curves of major laparoscopic and robotic procedures in urology: a systematic review.', 'Learning curves in laparoscopic and robot-assisted prostate surgery: a systematic search and review.', 'A Combined Technology to Protect the Anatomic Integrity of Distal Urethral Sphincter Complex in Radical Prostatectomy Improves Early Urinary Continence Recovery Without Sacrifice of Oncological Outcomes.', 'Incidence and risk factors of inguinal hernia occurred after radical prostatectomy-comparisons of different approaches.', 'Real-time assessment of learning curve for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.']"""

RhoB has different effects on cell migration depending on the cell type and conditions, but the molecular basis for this variability is unclear. RhoB regulates trafficking of membrane receptors and integrins. We have previously shown that RhoB depletion alters focal adhesion dynamics and reduces surface levels of β1 integrin in PC3 prostate cancer cells, correlating with increased migration speed.  Results:   Here we show that RhoB depletion reduces cell-cell adhesion and downregulates E-cadherin levels as well as increasing internalized E-cadherin in DU145 prostate cancer cells. This is accompanied by increased migration speed. RhoB localizes to cell-cell junctions together with E-cadherin in DU145 cells. RhoB depletion also reduces N-cadherin levels in PC3 cells, which do not express E-cadherin.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that RhoB alters migration of cells with cell-cell adhesions by regulating cadherin levels. We propose that the relative contribution of integrins and cadherins to cell migration underlies the variable involvement for RhoB in this process and that the downregulation of RhoB in some epithelial cancers could contribute to the weakening of epithelial cell-cell junction during tumor progression.""","""['Francisco M Vega', 'Mairian Thomas', 'Nicolas Reymond', 'Anne J Ridley']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['RhoB regulates uPAR signalling.', 'RhoB enhances migration and MMP1 expression of prostate cancer DU145.', 'DLC1 induces expression of E-cadherin in prostate cancer cells through Rho pathway and suppresses invasion.', 'RhoA, RhoB and RhoC have different roles in cancer cell migration.', 'Gene of the month: E-cadherin (CDH1).', 'MiR-21 Is Induced by Hypoxia and Down-Regulates RHOB in Prostate Cancer.', 'The histone demethylase KDM2B activates FAK and PI3K that control tumor cell motility.', 'The multifarious regulation of the apical junctional complex.', 'Stage-dependent differential gene expression profiles of cranial neural crest-like cells derived from mouse-induced pluripotent stem cells.', 'Proteomic characterization of bovine granulosa cells in dominant and subordinate follicles.']"""

We studied the effect of miR-204 modulation on master transcription factors important for lineage development, cell differentiation and prostate cancer bone marrow metastasis. We followed c-MYB, ETS1 and RUNX2 transcript and protein expression and the miR-204 affected global proteome. We further investigated if these transcription factors exert an effect on miR-204 expression (qPCR, luciferase reporter assay) by silencing them using esiRNA. We found dualistic miR-204 effects, either acting as a tumor suppressor on c-MYB, or as an oncomiR on ETS1. RUNX2 and ETS1 regulation by miR-204 was ERG fusion dependent, demonstrating regulatory circuitry disruption in advanced metastatic models. miR-204 also differentially affected mRNA splicing and protein stability. miR-204 levels were found dependent on cancer hypermethylation and supported by positive feedback induced by all three transcription factors. In this regulatory circuitry among miR-204, c-MYB, RUNX2 and ETS1, the c-MYB was found to induce all three other members, but its expression was differentially affected by the methylation status in lymph node vs. bone metastasis.

Methods:   Forty-nine patients treated with iodine-125 permanent seed prostate brachytherapy with low-activity seeds of 0.30-0.37 mCi were identified. For each of these patients, 2 patients with similar prostate volume (±2 cc) were paired: one treated with intermediate seed activity (0.44-0.46 mCi) and one with high seed activity (0.60-0.66 mCi). The doses to prostate and rectum were compared using CT on Day 30.  Results:   A total of 147 patients divided into the three seed activity groups were analyzed. Mean prostate volume was 35.7 cc (standard deviation [SD], 11.70). Compared with low-activity seeds, implants with high-activity seeds consisted of an average of 22 seeds and 4.7 needles less. The dose to the prostate (prostate volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose [V100], prostate volume receiving 150% of the prescribed dose, and minimal dose covering 90% of the prostate volume expressed in Gy) was not higher on Day 30 (p = 0.58-0.97).

The success of this approach hinges on the accuracy of rare variant imputation, which remains controversial. For example, a recent study suggested that one cannot adequately impute the HOXB13 G84E mutation associated with prostate cancer risk (carrier frequency of 0.0034 in European ancestry participants in the 1000 Genomes Project). We show that by utilizing the 1000 Genomes Project data plus an enriched reference panel of mutation carriers we were able to accurately impute the G84E mutation into a large cohort of 83,285 non-Hispanic White participants from the Kaiser Permanente Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging cohort. Imputation authenticity was confirmed via a novel classification and regression tree method, and then empirically validated analyzing a subset of these subjects plus an additional 1,789 men from Kaiser specifically genotyped for the G84E mutation (r2 = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.37–0.77). We then show the value of this approach by using the imputed data to investigate the impact of the G84E mutation on age-specific prostate cancer risk and on risk of fourteen other cancers in the cohort. The age-specific risk of prostate cancer among G84E mutation carriers was higher than among non-carriers. Risk estimates from Kaplan-Meier curves were 36.7% versus 13.6% by age 72, and 64.2% versus 24.2% by age 80, for G84E mutation carriers and non-carriers, respectively (p = 3.4x10-12). The G84E mutation was also associated with an increase in risk for the fourteen other most common cancers considered collectively (p = 5.8x10-4) and more so in cases diagnosed with multiple cancer types, both those including and not including prostate cancer, strongly suggesting pleiotropic effects.

In the present study, we examined whether morusin has a potential as an anti-cancer agent in prostate cancer. We found that morusin suppressed viability of prostate cancer cells, but little effect in normal human prostate epithelial cells. Morusin also reduced STAT3 activity by inhibiting its phosphorylation, nuclear accumulation, and DNA binding activity. In addition, morusin down-regulated expression of STAT3 target genes encoding Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Survivin, c-Myc and Cyclin D1, which are involved in regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle.

The normal development and maturation of the prostate gland, as well as early progression of prostate cancer, is dependent on androgens acting on the androgen receptor (AR). The actual mechanism by which PhIP interacts with our biological system and its potential interaction at the AR has yet to be fully defined. Here, we describe our work in evaluating the molecular events associated with PhIP-mediated disruption of AR function in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate, by molecular docking simulation, that PhIP and its metabolite can bind to the ligand-binding domain (LBD). The binding competes with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the native AR binding cavity of the receptor. In vitro assays show that PhIP increase AR protein expression in LNCaP cells and alters its responsiveness through PSA protein and mRNA expression. We propose that the mechanism for the tissue-specific carcinogenicity seen in the rat prostate tumors and the presumptive human prostate cancer associated with the consumption of well-done meat may be mediated by this receptor activation.

Methods:   The expression of LSD1 and E-cadherin in prostate cancer was detected using immunohistochemistry, and the relationship between the expressions of these two molecules was analyzed by correlation analysis. Furthermore, LNCap cell line was treated with Pargyline (an inhibitor of LSD1), and Western blot was used to analyze LSD1 and E-cadherin expression.  Results:   LSD1 expression increased significantly in prostate cancer specimens compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Further analysis testified that LSD1 expression was positively correlated with higher Gleason Score, distant metastases, and poor prognosis (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, E-cadherin expression decreased significantly in prostate cancer specimens compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia (P < 0.05) and was negatively correlated with higher Gleason Score, distant metastases (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed that LSD1 expression was negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression in prostate cancer (rs = -0.486, P = 0.001). Positive LSD1 expression and negative E-cadherin expression were significantly correlated with high 2-year progression (occurrence of castration-resistant prostate cancer) rate and low 5-year survival rate (P < 0.05). Moreover, Pargyline inhibited activity of LSD1 and up-regulated E-cadherin expression.

The implications of targeted biopsy alone vs standard extended-sextant biopsy or the 2 modalities combined are not well understood.  Objective:   To assess targeted vs standard biopsy and the 2 approaches combined for the diagnosis of intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective cohort study of 1003 men undergoing both targeted and standard biopsy concurrently from 2007 through 2014 at the National Cancer Institute in the United States. Patients were referred for elevated level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or abnormal digital rectal examination results, often with prior negative biopsy results. Risk categorization was compared among targeted and standard biopsy and, when available, whole-gland pathology after prostatectomy as the ""gold standard.""  Interventions:   Patients underwent multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging to identify regions of prostate cancer suspicion followed by targeted MR/ultrasound fusion biopsy and concurrent standard biopsy.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary objective was to compare targeted and standard biopsy approaches for detection of high-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3); secondary end points focused on detection of low-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score 3 + 3 or low-volume 3 + 4) and the biopsy ability to predict whole-gland pathology at prostatectomy.  Results:   Targeted MR/ultrasound fusion biopsy diagnosed 461 prostate cancer cases, and standard biopsy diagnosed 469 cases. There was exact agreement between targeted and standard biopsy in 690 men (69%) undergoing biopsy. Targeted biopsy diagnosed 30% more high-risk cancers vs standard biopsy (173 vs 122 cases, P < .001) and 17% fewer low-risk cancers (213 vs 258 cases, P < .001). When standard biopsy cores were combined with the targeted approach, an additional 103 cases (22%) of mostly low-risk prostate cancer were diagnosed (83% low risk, 12% intermediate risk, and 5% high risk). The predictive ability of targeted biopsy for differentiating low-risk from intermediate- and high-risk disease in 170 men with whole-gland pathology after prostatectomy was greater than that of standard biopsy or the 2 approaches combined (area under the curve, 0.73, 0.59, and 0.67, respectively; P < .05 for all comparisons).

The results demonstrated that Du145 cells treated with cisplatin for 48 h had an IC50 value >200 µM; however, following transfection of Pdcd5 in combination with treatment with various concentrations of cisplatin, the proliferation rates of Du145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells were significantly decreased in a dose‑dependent manner, with IC50 values of 114.1 and 50.6 µM, respectively.

However, the regulatory role of the p53 gene in SACC and the PNI process remains unknown. In the present study, we employed RNA interference technique to downregulate p53 gene expression in SACC-83 cells to explore the role of p53 in the PNI process. Our results showed that the downregulation of the p53 gene induced significant 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes' in SACC-83 cells, including decreased expression levels of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, EMA and CK5) and increased expression levels of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, N-cadherin and C-cadherin). The downregulation of p53 also caused a lower apoptotic index of Annexin V-FITC/PI and a lower number of SACC-83 cells in the second G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the downregulation of the p53 gene resulted in a significant increase in PNI activity in the SACC-83 cells. Thus, our findings revealed that downregulation of p53 promoted in vitro PNI activity through 'EMT-like changes' in SACC-83 cells.

Since leptin is produced by adipocytes, the serum leptin level is higher in obese than in non-obese individuals. However, the effects of leptin remain controversial and unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of leptin on PCa cell aggressiveness. Three human PCa cell lines (LNCaP, DU145 and PC-3) were treated with recombinant leptin for 28 days. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were estimated using the WST assay, a wound-healing assay, and a BD Matrigel invasion assay, respectively. The mechanism underlying the proliferative effect of leptin was investigated by cell transfections with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against the leptin receptor (ObR) or forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), and by immunocytochemistry. Long-term exposure of PCa cells to leptin enhanced their proliferation, migration and invasion. Leptin increased ObR expression and enhanced Akt phosphorylation constitutively. Leptin also increased the phosphorylation of FOXO1 via PI3K signaling and FOXO1 gene silencing enhanced PCa cell proliferation. Leptin induced the translocation of FOXO1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 suppressed this translocation. These results suggested that leptin regulated the subcellular localization of FOXO1 and induced Akt phosphorylation. Additionally, we revealed that leptin increased the expression of cyclin D1 and decreased the expression of p21 protein. In conclusion, long-term exposure to leptin increased the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells through inactivation of FOXO1. This inactivation resulted from exclusion of FOXO1 from the nucleus and its restriction to the cytoplasm through PI3K/Akt signaling. Our findings contribute to an understanding of the association between obesity and PCa aggressiveness.""","""['Terutaka Noda', 'Tadahiko Kikugawa', 'Nozomu Tanji', 'Noriyoshi Miura', 'Seiji Asai', 'Shigeki Higashiyama', 'Masayoshi Yokoyama']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Inhibition of BRD4 suppresses tumor growth in prostate cancer via the enhancement of FOXO1 expression.', 'FOXO1 inhibits Runx2 transcriptional activity and prostate cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Upregulation of miR-153 promotes cell proliferation via downregulation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene in human prostate cancer.', 'Molecular mechanisms of FOXO1 in adipocyte differentiation.', 'Leptin signalling, obesity and prostate cancer: molecular and clinical perspective on the old dilemma.', 'Prediagnostic markers of insulin resistance and prostate cancer risk and death: A pooled study.', 'Interplay between Prostate Cancer and Adipose Microenvironment: A Complex and Flexible Scenario.', 'Bioassay-Guided extraction of andrographis paniculata for intervention of in-vitro prostate cancer progression in metabolic syndrome environment.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Signaling Role of Adipocyte Leptin in Prostate Cell Proliferation Induced by Trichomonas vaginalis.']"""

We searched for a global phenotypic characteristic that was highly conserved among cancer stem cells, across multiple tumor types, to provide a mutation-independent approach to cancer therapy. This would allow us to target cancer stem cells, effectively treating cancer as a single disease of ""stemness"", independently of the tumor tissue type. Using this approach, we identified a conserved phenotypic weak point - a strict dependence on mitochondrial biogenesis for the clonal expansion and survival of cancer stem cells. Interestingly, several classes of FDA-approved antibiotics inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis as a known ""side-effect"", which could be harnessed instead as a ""therapeutic effect"". Based on this analysis, we now show that 4-to-5 different classes of FDA-approved drugs can be used to eradicate cancer stem cells, in 12 different cancer cell lines, across 8 different tumor types (breast, DCIS, ovarian, prostate, lung, pancreatic, melanoma, and glioblastoma (brain)). These five classes of mitochondrially-targeted antibiotics include: the erythromycins, the tetracyclines, the glycylcyclines, an anti-parasitic drug, and chloramphenicol. Functional data are presented for one antibiotic in each drug class: azithromycin, doxycycline, tigecycline, pyrvinium pamoate, as well as chloramphenicol, as proof-of-concept. Importantly, many of these drugs are non-toxic for normal cells, likely reducing the side effects of anti-cancer therapy. Thus, we now propose to treat cancer like an infectious disease, by repurposing FDA-approved antibiotics for anti-cancer therapy, across multiple tumor types. These drug classes should also be considered for prevention studies, specifically focused on the prevention of tumor recurrence and distant metastasis. Finally, recent clinical trials with doxycycline and azithromycin (intended to target cancer-associated infections, but not cancer cells) have already shown positive therapeutic effects in cancer patients, although their ability to eradicate cancer stem cells was not yet appreciated.""","""['Rebecca Lamb', 'Bela Ozsvari', 'Camilla L Lisanti', 'Herbert B Tanowitz', 'Anthony Howell', 'Ubaldo E Martinez-Outschoorn', 'Federica Sotgia', 'Michael P Lisanti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Drug therapy: Can the mitochondrial adverse effects of antibiotics be exploited to target cancer metabolism?', 'Doxycycline, Azithromycin and Vitamin C (DAV): A potent combination therapy for targeting mitochondria and eradicating cancer stem cells (CSCs).', 'Targeting cancer stem cell propagation with palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor: Telomerase drives tumor cell heterogeneity.', 'A mitochondrial based oncology platform for targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs): MITO-ONC-RX.', 'Mitochondrial biogenesis is required for the anchorage-independent survival and propagation of stem-like cancer cells.', 'Cancer stem cells in drug resistant lung cancer: Targeting cell surface markers and signaling pathways.', 'Unravelling the Therapeutic Potential of Antibiotics in Hypoxia in a Breast Cancer MCF-7 Cell Line Model.', 'RNA binding protein: coordinated expression between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in tumors.', 'Cancer stem cell fate determination: mito-nuclear communication.', 'The role of tumor microenvironment on cancer stem cell fate in solid tumors.', 'Amino Acid Metabolism in Bone Metastatic Disease.']"""

Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) expression in PCa has been reported by several studies and its involvement in the progression towards androgen-independent PCa has been discussed. External irradiation is one of the existing therapies, which has been demonstrated to be efficient in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of advanced PCa. However, 20-40% of patients develop recurrent and more aggressive PCa within 10 years. The current study investigates the involvement of HER2 in survival and radioresistance in PCa cells and we hypothesized that, by monitoring HER2 expression, treatment may be personalized. The PCa cell lines, LNCap, PC3 and DU-145, received a 6 Gy single dose of external irradiation. The number of PC3 cells was not affected by a single dose of radiation, whereas a 5-fold decrease in cell number was detected in LNCap (P<0.00001) and DU-145 (P<0.0001) cells. The HER2 expression in PC3 exhibited a significant increase post irradiation, however, the expression was stable in the remaining cell lines.

This study examined orteronel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed after docetaxel therapy.  Patients and methods:   In our study, 1,099 men were randomly assigned in a 2:1 schedule to receive orteronel 400 mg plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily or placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily, stratified by region (Europe, North America [NA], and non-Europe/NA) and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form worst pain score. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Key secondary end points (radiographic progression-free survival [rPFS], ≥ 50% decrease of prostate-specific antigen [PSA50], and pain response at 12 weeks) were to undergo statistical testing only if the primary end point analysis was significant.  Results:   The study was unblinded after crossing a prespecified OS futility boundary.

However, the tremendous dynamic range of the plasma proteome has so far hampered the identification of such low abundant markers. To overcome this challenge we analyzed the plasma microparticle proteome, and reached an unprecedented depth of over 3000 plasma proteins in single runs. To add a quantitative dimension, we developed PROMIS-Quan-PROteomics of MIcroparticles with Super-Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) Quantification, a novel mass spectrometry-based technology for plasma microparticle proteome quantification. PROMIS-Quan enables a two-step relative and absolute SILAC quantification. First, plasma microparticle proteomes are quantified relative to a super-SILAC mix composed of cell lines from distinct origins. Next, the absolute amounts of selected proteins of interest are quantified relative to the super-SILAC mix. We applied PROMIS-Quan to prostate cancer and compared plasma microparticle samples of healthy individuals and prostate cancer patients. We identified in total 5374 plasma-microparticle proteins, and revealed a predictive signature of three proteins that were elevated in the patient-derived plasma microparticles. Finally, PROMIS-Quan enabled determination of the absolute quantitative changes in prostate specific antigen (PSA) upon treatment.

Materials and methods:   In total, 173 patients were included. The following prognostic factors were assessed: primary cancer site, age, gender, albumin and haemoglobin levels, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), analgesic use, pain intensity, number of extraspinal bone metastases and visceral metastases, presence of tumour-conditioned spinal canal stenosis and metastatic spinal cord compression, and extension of spinal metastatic disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ongoing systemic treatment, use of bisphosphonates and response to radiotherapy were also evaluated. A simple scoring system for predicting survival was used.  Results:   The following predictive factors were found to be significant in multivariate analysis: primary cancer site, KPS, albumin level, number of visceral metastases and analgesic use. Three survival groups were proposed. The overall survival probabilities for groups 1-3 were 13, 46 and 94% at 6 months; 4, 28 and 79% at 12 months, respectively.

Methods:   We extracted data from the National Cancer Database in 2010 and 2011 on 17,943 low-risk patients (Gleason score = 3+3, prostate-specific antigen < 10 ng/ml, and cT1-T2) who underwent RP. We identified men who delayed RP by>6 months after diagnosis and measured the effect of delayed RP on pathologic upgrading, upstaging, nodal metastases, and positive surgical margins.  Results:   Overall, 16,818 underwent RP ≤ 6 months, 894 at 6 to 9 months, 169 at 9 to 12 months, and 62 at>12 months from diagnostic biopsy. Furthermore, upgrading occurred in 43%, upstaging in 9%, positive surgical margins in 16%, and nodal metastases in 0.3% of men. Upgrading, upstaging, or nodal metastases occurred in 45% of men. On multivariable analysis, higher prostate-specific antigen (4.1-9.9 ng/ml vs. 0.1-2.4 ng/ml; odds ratio [OR] = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.66-2.10),>2 positive biopsy cores (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.57-1.81), ≥ 34% positive biopsy cores (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18-1.39), black race (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05-1.28), and time from biopsy to RP>12 months (vs. ≤ 6 mo: OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.01-2.84) each independently increased the composite risk of adverse pathology (all P< 0.05).  Conclusion:   In the United States, nearly half of men with low-risk prostate cancer experience at least one adverse pathologic outcome at RP.

In this paper, a combined rigid and deformable registration technique is proposed to register pre-treatment diagnostic 3T magnetic resonance (MR) images of the prostate, with the identified target tumor(s), to intra-treatment 1.5T MR images. The pre-treatment T2-weighted MR images were acquired with patients in a supine position using an endorectal coil in a 3T scanner, while the intra-treatment T2-weighted MR images were acquired in a 1.5T scanner before insertion of the needle with patients in the semi-lithotomy position. Both the rigid and deformable registration algorithms employ an intensity-based distance metric defined based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptors (MIND) between images. The optimization routine for estimating the rigid transformation parameters is initialized using four pairs of manually selected approximate corresponding points on the boundaries of the prostate. In this paper, the problem of deformable image registration is approached from the perspective of state estimation for dynamical systems. The registration algorithm employs a rather generic dynamic linear elastic model of the tissue deformation discretized by the finite element method (FEM). We use the model in a classical state estimation framework to estimate the deformation of the prostate based on the distance metric between pre- and intra-treatment images. Our deformable registration results using 17 sets of prostate MR images showed that the proposed method yielded a target registration error (TRE) of 1.87 ± 0.94 mm,2.03 ± 0.94 mm, and 1.70 ± 0.93 mm for the whole gland (WG), central gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ), respectively, using 76 manually-identified fiducial points. This was an improvement over the 2.67 ± 1.31 mm, 2.95 ± 1.43 mm, and 2.34 ± 1.11 mm, respectively for the WG, CG, and PZ after rigid registration alone. Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) in the WG, CG and PZ were 88.2 ± 5.3, 85.6 ± 7.6 and 68.7 ± 6.9 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the mean absolute distances (MAD) between surfaces was 1.26 ± 0.56 mm and 1.27 ± 0.55 mm in the WG and CG, after deformable registration. These results indicate that the proposed registration technique has sufficient accuracy for localizing prostate tumors in MRI-guided targeted biopsy or focal therapy of clinically localized prostate cancer.""","""['Bahram Marami', 'Shahin Sirouspour', 'Suha Ghoul', 'Jeremy Cepek', 'Sean R H Davidson', 'David W Capson', 'John Trachtenberg', 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Registration of prostate histology images to ex vivo MR images via strand-shaped fiducials.', 'Evaluation of three-dimensional finite element-based deformable registration of pre- and intraoperative prostate imaging.', 'Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'A review of 3D/2D registration methods for image-guided interventions.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'Accurate validation of ultrasound imaging of prostate cancer: a review of challenges in registration of imaging and histopathology.', 'Comparison of Elastic and Rigid Registration during Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-Guided Prostate Biopsy: A Multi-Operator Phantom Study.', '3D Registration of mpMRI for Assessment of Prostate Cancer Focal Therapy.', 'Accuracy of Elastic Fusion of Prostate Magnetic Resonance and Transrectal Ultrasound Images under Routine Conditions: A Prospective Multi-Operator Study.']"""

Methods:   Two techniques, jaw tracking and static jaw, were used respectively to develop the d-IMRT plans for 28 cancer patients with various lesion sites: head and neck, lungs, esophageal, abdominal, prostate, rectal and cervical. The dose volume histograms (DVH) and selected dosimetric indexes for the whole body and for organs at risk (OARs) were compared. A two dimensional ionization chamber Array Seven29 (PTW, Freiburg, Germany) and OCTAVIUS Octagonal phantom (PTW, Freiburg, Germany) were used to verify all the plans.  Results:   For all patients, the treatment plans using both techniques met the clinical requirements. The V5, V10, V20, V30, V40 (volumes receiving 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 Gy at least, respectively), mean dose (Dmean) for the whole body and V5, V10, V20, Dmean for lungs in the JTT d-IMRT plans were significantly less than the corresponding values of the SJT d-IMRT plans (p < 0.001). The JTT d-IMRT plans deposited lower maximum dose (Dmax) to the lens, eyes, brainstem, spinal cord, and right optic nerve, the doses reductions for these OARs ranged from 2.2% to 28.6%. The JTT d-IMRT plans deposited significantly lower Dmean to various OARs (all p values < 0.05), the mean doses reductions for these OARs ranged from 1.1% to 31.0%, and the value reductions depend on the volume and the location of the OARs. The γ evaluation method showed an excellent agreement between calculation and measurement for all techniques with criteria of 3%/3 mm.  Conclusions:   Both jaw tracking and static jaw d-IMRT plans can achieve comparable target dose coverage. JTT displays superior OARs sparing than SJT plans. These results are of clinical importance, especially for the patients with large and complex targets but close to some highly radio-sensitive organs to spare, and for patients with local recurrent or secondary primary malignant lesion within a previously irradiated area.""","""['Zhongsu Feng', 'Hao Wu', 'Yibao Zhang', 'Yunjun Zhang', 'Jinsheng Cheng', 'Xu Su']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['A comparative study of identical VMAT plans with and without jaw tracking technique.', 'Evaluation of fixed-jaw IMRT and tangential partial-VMAT radiotherapy plans for synchronous bilateral breast cancer irradiation based on a dosimetric study.', 'Dosimetric comparison between 2-dimensional radiation therapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy in treatment of advanced T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma: to treat less or more in the planning organ-at-risk volume of the brainstem and spinal cord.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'Pitfalls and Challenges to Consider before Setting up a Lung Cancer Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy Service: A Review of the Reported Clinical Experience.', 'Dosimetric impacts of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-based anatomic changes in intensity-modulated radiotherapy for cervical cancer.', 'Dosimetric Importance of Implementing Jaw Tracking Technique in Radiotherapy Treatment Plan Execution.', 'Selection Strategy of Jaw Tracking in VMAT Planning for Lung SBRT.', 'Comparison of combinations of irradiation techniques and jaw conditions in intensity-modulated radiotherapy for lung cancer.', 'Dosimetric comparison and biological evaluation of fixed-jaw intensity-modulated radiation therapy for T-shaped esophageal cancer.']"""

This limits surgical planning, which could be modified to account for focal extracapsular extension with image directed guidance for wider excision. In this study we evaluate the performance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in extracapsular extension detection and determine which preoperative variables predict extracapsular extension on final pathology when multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging predicts organ confined disease.  Materials and methods:   From May 2007 to March 2014, 169 patients underwent pre-biopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy, extended sextant 12-core biopsy and radical prostatectomy at our institution. A subset of 116 men had multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging negative for extracapsular extension and were included in the final analysis.  Results:   The 116 men with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging negative for extracapsular extension had a median age of 61 years (IQR 57-66) and a median prostate specific antigen of 5.51 ng/ml (IQR 3.91-9.07). The prevalence of extracapsular extension was 23.1% in the overall population. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for extracapsular extension were 48.7%, 73.9%, 35.9% and 82.8%, respectively. On multivariate regression analysis only patient age (p=0.002) and magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy Gleason score (p=0.032) were independent predictors of extracapsular extension on final radical prostatectomy pathology.  Conclusions:   Because of the low sensitivity of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for extracapsular extension, further tools are necessary to stratify men at risk for occult extracapsular extension that would otherwise only become apparent on final pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy Gleason score can help identify which men with prostate cancer have extracapsular extension that may not be detectable by imaging.""","""['Dima Raskolnikov', 'Arvin K George', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami', 'Baris Turkbey', 'M Minhaj Siddiqui', 'Nabeel A Shakir', 'Chinonyerem Okoro', 'Jason T Rothwax', 'Annerleim Walton-Diaz', 'Sandeep Sankineni', 'Daniel Su', 'Lambros Stamatakis', 'Maria J Merino', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Peter A Pinto']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['The role of magnetic resonance image guided prostate biopsy in stratifying men for risk of extracapsular extension at radical prostatectomy.

Materials and methods:   Using an institutional database we identified a cohort of 847 patients with biopsy Gleason 8-10 disease who received definitive local therapy with radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy between January 2001 and December 2011. Multivariable Cox modeling was used to assess the association of Gleason score 8 vs 9-10 with time to biochemical recurrence, metastasis and overall survival, and evaluate treatment by Gleason score interaction. Median followup in the cohort was 5.3 years.  Results:   Baseline patient characteristics were similar for biopsy Gleason 8 vs 9-10. Gleason 9-10 disease was associated with higher prostate specific antigen at diagnosis. As local treatment such patients were also more likely to have received radiation therapy (58% vs 46%, p = 0.001) and neoadjuvant/adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (64% vs 49%, p <0.001). Those with higher grade disease were at increased risk for metastasis (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.11-1.79).

We created an age adjusted comorbidity index that predicts other cause mortality in men with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We sampled 1,598 men consecutively diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1998 and 2004 at West Los Angeles and Long Beach Veterans Affairs hospitals. We used competing risks regression in testing and validation cohorts to determine the risk of nonprostate cancer related (ie other cause) mortality associated with age at diagnosis and PCCI score. We converted risk into a 10-point scoring system and calculated 2, 5 and 10-year cumulative incidence of other cause mortality by age adjusted PCCI scores.  Results:   PCCI score and age were associated with similar hazards of other cause mortality in the testing and validation cohorts. Each 6-year increase in age at diagnosis of greater than 60 was equivalent to 1 additional PCCI point. After correcting PCCI score for age the age adjusted PCCI scores were strongly predictive of other cause mortality. The subhazard ratio of other cause mortality vs 0 for a score of 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-9 and 10+ was 2.0 (95% CI 1.3-3.0), 4.0 (95% CI 2.6-6.1), 8.7 (95% CI 5.7-13.3), 14.7 (95% CI 9.4-22.8) and 43.2 (95% CI 26.6-70.4), respectively. The 10-year cumulative incidence of other cause mortality was 10%, 19%, 35%, 60%, 79% and 99%, respectively.  Conclusions:   The age adjusted PCCI strongly stratifies the risk of long-term, other cause mortality. It may be incorporated into shared decision making to decrease overtreatment of older and chronically ill men with prostate cancer.""","""['Timothy J Daskivich', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Atreya Dash', 'Christopher Saigal', 'Mark S Litwin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['External Validation of the Prostate Cancer Specific Comorbidity Index: A Claims Based Tool for the Prediction of Life Expectancy in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Weighted versus unweighted Charlson score to predict long-term other-cause mortality in men with early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Improved prediction of long-term, other cause mortality in men with prostate cancer.', 'Overtreatment of men with low-risk prostate cancer and significant comorbidity.', 'Comparative effectiveness of aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment among men with early-stage prostate cancer and differing comorbid disease burdens at diagnosis.', 'Development and validation of a life expectancy calculator for US patients with prostate cancer.', 'Estimating patient health in prostate cancer treatment counseling.', 'Using an Automated Electronic Health Record Score To Estimate Life Expectancy In Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer In The Veterans Health Administration.', 'The role of chemotherapy in patients with T1bN0M0 triple-negative breast cancer: a real-world competing risk analysis.', 'Patient Reported vs Claims Based Measures of Health for Modeling Life Expectancy in Men with Prostate Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   We included men in the study with lower risk disease managed initially with active surveillance and upgraded to Gleason score 3+4 or greater. Patient demographics and disease characteristics were compared. Kaplan-Meier curve was used to estimate the treatment-free probability stratified by initial upgrade (3+4 vs 4+3 or greater), Cox regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with treatment and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors associated with adverse outcome at surgery.  Results:   The final cohort comprised 219 men, with 150 (68%) upgraded to 3+4 and 69 (32%) to 4+3 or greater. Median time to upgrade was 23 months (IQR 11-49). A total of 163 men (74%) sought treatment, the majority (69%) with radical prostatectomy. The treatment-free survival rate at 5 years was 22% for 3+4 and 10% for 4+3 or greater upgrade. Upgrade to 4+3 or greater, higher prostate specific antigen density at diagnosis and shorter time to initial upgrade were associated with treatment. At surgical pathology 34% of cancers were downgraded while 6% were upgraded. Cancer volume at initial upgrade was associated with adverse pathological outcome at surgery (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.19-9.29, p=0.02).  Conclusions:   After Gleason score upgrade most patients elected treatment with radical prostatectomy. Among men who deferred definitive intervention, few experienced additional upgrading.

Methods:   The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, receiver operator curve, and area under the curve (AUC) were compared for 6 published AS criteria (National Comprehensive Cancer Network; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance Study; Johns Hopkins-Epstein; University of California at San Francisco; and University of Miami) to predict organ-confined Gleason score 6 disease at prostatectomy in AAs and white Americans (WAs) with low-risk cancer. We also compared clinical parameters for AAs with favorable prostatectomy pathology with those for AAs with unfavorable pathology, and then used preoperative variables associated with unfavorable pathology as an additional exclusion criteria for AS.  Results:   Of 468 patients with low-risk disease, 308 of 402 (76.6%) WAs and 55 of 66 (83.3%) AAs were eligible for AS by one or more criteria (P = .23). For WAs, Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance Study criteria had the highest rate of favorable pathology (81.7%) and the best performance (AUC = 0.70) in determining appropriate candidates for AS. However, all 6 AS criteria performed poorly for AA patients, with all AUCs ≤0.52. When comparing AAs with favorable pathology with AAs with unfavorable pathology, only family history of prostate cancer was statistically significant (11 of 25 [47.8%] vs. 8 of 41 [22.2%]; P = .04). When adjusting AS criteria in AAs to exclude those with a positive family history, the AUC increased most for the University of California at San Francisco (from 0.52 to 0.6) and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center criteria (from 0.50 to 0.58).

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 39 patients with CRPC. LPREs were defined as regional symptoms caused by local progression and categorized into urinary events and rectal events. Urinary events were defined as ureteral obstruction, acute urinary retention, or hematuria requiring treatment, and rectal events were rectal obstruction or rectal bleeding caused by tumor invasion.  Results:   The median prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis was 185 ng/mL. During the median follow-up period of 4.4 years, 10 patients (25.6%) had LPREs. Urinary events were observed in 8 patients (20.5%) and rectal events in 2 (5.1%). The proportion of T4 in patients with LPREs was higher than in those without LPREs (70.0% vs. 10.3%; P <.001). Stage T4 at diagnosis was an independent factor to predict LPREs in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 8.62; P = .004). The 5-year cumulative incidence of LPREs in patients with stage T4 was 70.0%, whereas in those with stage ≤T3, they were 3.6% (P <.001).  Conclusion:   Patients with stage T4 at diagnosis are more likely to have a risk of LPREs than those with stage ≤T3.

ADT greatly influenced sexual and hormonal functions and bothers in patients who received IMRT with ADT. The patient-perceived satisfaction at 12 months after the treatments was approximately 80% in both treatment groups, and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. At 12 months after the treatments, urinary function (P = .001) was identified as the most significant predictor of patient-perceived satisfaction, although it was not associated with the treatment type.  Conclusion:   The majority of patients with high-risk PCA who received RP or IMRT with ADT reported high patient-perceived satisfaction after the treatments. This study showed that improvement in urinary function might contribute to patient-perceived satisfaction after the treatments.""","""['Shinya Yamamoto', 'Hitoshi Masuda', 'Shinji Urakami', 'Yasuhisa Fujii', 'Kimihiko Sakamoto', 'Takuyo Kozuka', 'Masahiko Oguchi', 'Iwao Fukui', 'Junji Yonese']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Reply: To PMID 25623703.', 'Factors associated with treatment received by men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Queensland, Australia.', 'Long-term quality of life in disadvantaged men with prostate cancer on androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Bother problems in prostate cancer patients after curative treatment.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Biological effect of neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy assessed on specimens from radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'Radiation therapy compared to radical prostatectomy as first-line definitive therapy for patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The efficacy and safety of radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Caution with Use of the EPIC-50 Urinary Bother Scale: How Voiding Dysfunction Modifies its Performance.']"""

Over the past decade, dramatic changes in the management of advanced prostate cancer have proceeded alongside changes in end-of-life care. But, the impact of these contemporary advances in management of mCaP and its implications on US health care expenditure remains unknown.  Methods:   Patients hospitalized with mCaP from 1998 to 2010 were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (n = 100,220). Temporal trends in incidence and charges were assessed by linear regression. Complex samples logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of in-hospital mortality, elevated hospital charges beyond the 75th percentile and hospice utilization.  Results:   Between 1998 and 2010, admissions for mCaP decreased at a rate of -5.95% per year (P <.001), whereas per-incident charges increased at the rate of 6.1% (P <.001) annually; the national economic burden of care was stable. Over the study period, hospice use increased 488.0% per year (P <.001) but was significantly lower among black (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; P = .01) and Hispanic (OR, 0.65; P = .03) patients. In multivariable analyses, hospice utilization was associated with decreased odds of elevated hospital charges beyond the 75th percentile (OR, 0.84; P = .02).  Conclusion:   Despite a decline in hospitalizations for mCaP, the economic burden of care has remained stable. Increasing use of hospice services has moderated the effect of rising per-incident hospital charges, highlighting the importance of promoting access to hospice in the right clinical setting. These findings have important policy implications, particularly as advances in treatment are expected to further increase expenditures related to the inpatient management of mCaP.""","""['Jesse D Sammon', 'Rana R McKay', 'Simon P Kim', 'Akshay Sood', 'Shyam Sukumar', 'Matthew H Hayn', 'Jim C Hu', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'James O Peabody', 'Fred Saad', 'Maxine Sun', 'Briony Varda', 'Mani Menon', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Reply: To PMID 25623683.', 'Reply: To PMID 25623683.', 'Editorial comment.', 'The use of health services among elderly patients with stage IV prostate cancer in the initial period following diagnosis.', 'Resource Use in the Last Year of Life Among Patients Who Died With Versus of Prostate Cancer.', 'Emergency Department Utilization in Patients With Neurogenic Bladder: Contemporary Burden and National Trends in Prevalence, Inpatient Admission, and Associated Charges, 2006-2011.', 'Hispanics and Hospice: A Systematic Literature Review.', 'Characteristics of hospitalized dermatomyositis patients with underlying malignancy: a nationally representative retrospective cohort study.', 'Conceptualizing and Counting Discretionary Utilization in the Final 100\xa0Days of Life: A Scoping Review.', 'Acute care in glioblastoma: the burden and the consequences.', 'The Clinical Course of Patients With Prostate-Specific Antigen ≥100\u2009ng/ml: Insight Into a Potential Population for Targeted Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening.']"""

Methods:   We reanalyzed data from REDUCE, a randomized trial of dutasteride for prostate cancer chemoprevention in men with prior negative biopsy. We evaluated whether statistical models using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA velocity could help predict the result of repeat prostate biopsy separately for dutasteride and placebo groups. Area under the curve was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation.  Results:   PSA velocity improved discrimination at 4 years in the dutasteride group but not at 2 years nor in the placebo group. At 2 years, dutasteride improved discrimination of PSA slightly (0.616 vs. 0.603 for any grade cancer; 0.681 vs. 0.676 for high-grade disease). Between-group differences in cancer rates at 4 years were small.  Conclusion:   Clinicians who are willing to treat at least 23 patients with dutasteride for 2 years to avoid 1 prostate cancer diagnosis should offer dutasteride after initial negative biopsy.

However, the linkage of macrophages and TR4 and their impacts on PCa metastasis remains unclear.  Results:   Knocking-down TR4 in human PCa cells (C4-2, CWR22Rv1), but not in human macrophages cells (THP-1), led to suppress the macrophages infiltration to PCa cells. The consequences of such suppression of the recruitment of macrophages toward PCa then resulted in suppressing the PCa cell invasion. Mechanism dissection found that knocking-down TR4 in PCa cells suppressed metastasis-related genes including MMP2, with induction of TIMP-1. Interruption assays using TIMP-1 neutralizing antibody could then reverse TR4-macrophage-mediated PCa invasion. IHC staining showed higher TR4 level, more macrophage infiltration, lower TIMP-1 and stronger MMP2/MMP9 in tumor tissues of the Gleason score 5 + 4 patients compared with the Gleason score 3 + 3 patients.

Deregulation of several deubiquitinating enzymes has been linked to tumor development but their specific role in prostate cancer progression remains unexplored.  Methods:   RNAi screening was used to investigate the role of the ovarian tumor proteases (OTU) family of deubiquitinating enzymes on the proliferation and invasion capacity of prostate cancer cells. RhoA activity was measured in relation with OTUB1 effects on prostate cancer cell invasion. Tumor xenograft mouse model with stable OTUB1 knockdown was used to investigate OTUB1 influence in tumor growth.  Results:   Our RNAi screening identified OTUB1 as an important regulator of prostate cancer cell invasion through the modulation of RhoA activation. The effect of OTUB1 on RhoA activation is important for androgen-induced repression of p53 expression in prostate cancer cells. In localized prostate cancer tumors OTUB1 was found overexpressed as compared to normal prostatic epithelial cells. Prostate cancer xenografts expressing reduced levels of OTUB1 exhibit reduced tumor growth and reduced metastatic dissemination in vivo.

Prostate cancer was analysed in detail.  Patients and methods:   Population and death certification data from stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, prostate, leukaemias and total cancers were obtained from the World Health Organisation database and Eurostat. Figures were derived for the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. Projected 2015 numbers of deaths by age group were obtained by linear regression on estimated numbers of deaths over the most recent time period identified by a joinpoint regression model.  Results:   A total of 1,359,100 cancer deaths are predicted in the EU in 2015 (766,200 men and 592,900 women), corresponding to standardised death rates of 138.4/100,000 men and 83.9/100,000 women, falling 7.5% and 6%, respectively, since 2009. In men, predicted rates for the three major cancers (lung, colorectum and prostate) are lower than in 2009, falling 9%, 5% and 12%. Prostate cancer showed predicted falls of 14%, 17% and 9% in the 35-64, 65-74 and 75+ age groups. In women, breast and colorectal cancers had favourable trends (-10% and -8%), but predicted lung cancer rates rise 9% to 14.24/100,000 becoming the cancer with the highest rate, reaching and possibly overtaking breast cancer rates--though the total number of deaths remain higher for breast (90 800) than lung (87 500). Pancreatic cancer has a negative outlook in both sexes, rising 4% in men and 5% in women between 2009 and 2015.  Conclusions:   Cancer mortality predictions for 2015 confirm the overall favourable cancer mortality trend in the EU, translating to an overall 26% fall in men since its peak in 1988, and 21% in women, and the avoidance of over 325,000 deaths in 2015 compared with the peak rate.""","""['M Malvezzi', 'P Bertuccio', 'T Rosso', 'M Rota', 'F Levi', 'C La Vecchia', 'E Negri']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['European cancer mortality predictions for the year 2014.', 'European cancer mortality predictions for the year 2016 with focus on leukaemias.', 'European cancer mortality predictions for the year 2018 with focus on colorectal cancer.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in Europe: Estimates for 40 countries and 25 major cancers in 2018.', 'Cancer, cigarette smoking and premature death in Europe: a review including the Recommendations of European Cancer Experts Consensus Meeting, Helsinki, October 1996.', 'A neural network model to screen feature genes for pancreatic cancer.', 'Impact of cancer on income, wealth and economic outcomes of adult cancer survivors: a scoping review.', 'Prediction of the Invasiveness of Ground-Glass Nodules in Lung Adenocarcinoma by Radiomics Analysis Using High-Resolution Computed Tomography Imaging.', 'Recent advances of NEAT1-miRNA interactions in cancer.', 'Higher Incidence of Diabetes in Cancer Patients Compared to Cancer-Free Population Controls: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

TWIST1 is a dimeric basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor existing as TWIST1-TWIST1 or TWIST1-E12/47. TWIST1 partner choice and DNA binding can be influenced during development by phosphorylation of Thr125 and Ser127 of the Thr-Gln-Ser (TQS) motif within the bHLH of TWIST1. The significance of these TWIST1 phosphorylation sites for metastasis is unknown. We created stable isogenic prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing TWIST1 wild-type, phospho-mutants, and tethered versions. We assessed these isogenic lines using assays that mimic stages of cancer metastasis. In vitro assays suggested the phospho-mimetic Twist1-DQD mutation could confer cellular properties associated with pro-metastatic behavior. The hypo-phosphorylation mimic Twist1-AQA mutation displayed reduced pro-metastatic activity compared to wild-type TWIST1 in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation of the TWIST1 TQS motif was necessary for pro-metastatic functions. In vivo analysis demonstrates that the Twist1-AQA mutation exhibits reduced capacity to contribute to metastasis, whereas the expression of the Twist1-DQD mutation exhibits proficient metastatic potential. Tethered TWIST1-E12 heterodimers phenocopied the Twist1-DQD mutation for many in vitro assays, suggesting that TWIST1 phosphorylation may result in heterodimerization in prostate cancer cells. Lastly, the dual phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor BEZ235 strongly attenuated TWIST1-induced migration that was dependent on the TQS motif. TWIST1 TQS phosphorylation state determines the intensity of TWIST1-induced pro-metastatic ability in prostate cancer cells, which may be partly explained mechanistically by TWIST1 dimeric partner choice.""","""['Rajendra P Gajula', 'Sivarajan T Chettiar', 'Russell D Williams', 'Katriana Nugent', 'Yoshinori Kato', 'Hailun Wang', 'Reem Malek', 'Kekoa Taparra', 'Jessica Cades', 'Anvesh Annadanam', 'A-Rum Yoon', 'Elana Fertig', 'Beth A Firulli', 'Lucia Mazzacurati', 'Timothy F Burns', 'Anthony B Firulli', 'Steven S An', 'Phuoc T Tran']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Oxidative stress drives disulfide bond formation between basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors.', 'The twist box domain is required for Twist1-induced prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Akt/PKB-mediated phosphorylation of Twist1 promotes tumor metastasis via mediating cross-talk between PI3K/Akt and TGF-β signaling axes.', 'Phosphoregulation of Twist1 provides a mechanism of cell fate control.', 'The role of TWIST1 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancers.', 'Unpacking the Complexity of Epithelial Plasticity: From Master Regulator Transcription Factors to Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Twist1 induces chromosomal instability (CIN) in colorectal cancer cells.', 'TWIST1 Heterodimerization with E12 Requires Coordinated Protein Phosphorylation to Regulate Periostin Expression.', 'Synaptotagmin 7 in twist-related protein 1-mediated epithelial - Mesenchymal transition of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Roles of the Phosphorylation of Transcriptional Factors in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.']"""
