Materials and methods:   Thirty-nine consecutive patients who had 3.0T MP-MRI and subsequent MRI/TRUS fusion prostate biopsy were included and 73 MRI-identified targets were sampled by 177 cores. The pre-biopsy MP-MRI consisted of T2-weighted, diffusion weighted (DWI), and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) images. The association of quantitative MRI measurements with biopsy histopathology findings was assessed by Mann-Whitney U- test and Kruskal-Wallis test.  Results:   Of 73 targets, biopsy showed benign prostate tissue in 46 (63%), cancer in 23 (31.5%), and atypia/high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in four (5.5%) targets. The median volume of cancer-positive targets was 1.3 cm3. The cancer-positive targets were located in the peripheral zone (56.5%), transition zone (39.1%), and seminal vesicle (4.3%). Nine of 23 (39.1%) cancer-positive targets were higher grade cancer (Gleason grade > 6). Higher grade targets and cancer-positive targets compared to benign lesions exhibited lower mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value (952.7 < 1167.9 < 1278.9), and lower minimal extracellular volume fraction (ECF) (0.13 < 0.185 < 0.213), respectively. The difference in parameters was more pronounced between higher grade cancer and benign lesions.  Conclusions:   Our findings from a pilot study indicate that quantitative MRI parameters can predict malignant histology on MRI/TRUS fusion prostate biopsy, which is a valuable technique to ensure adequate sampling of MRI-visible suspicious lesions under TRUS guidance and may impact patient management. The DWI-based quantitative measurement exhibits a stronger association with biopsy findings than the other MRI parameters.""","""['Seyed Saeid Dianat', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Ulrik M Hamper', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Katarzyna J Macura']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'A prospective, blinded comparison of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-ultrasound fusion and visual estimation in the performance of MR-targeted prostate biopsy: the PROFUS trial.', 'Multiparametric MRI-targeted TRUS prostate biopsies using visual registration.', 'Kinematic and mechanical modelling of a novel 4-DOF robotic needle guide for MRI-guided prostate intervention.', 'Comparison of two commonly used methods in measurement of cancer volume in prostate biopsy.', 'The Role of Tumor Oxygenation Tested by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Prostate Cancer Grading.', 'Analysis of histological findings obtained combining US/mp-MRI fusion-guided biopsies with systematic US biopsies: mp-MRI role in prostate cancer detection and false negative.', 'Active surveillance for prostate cancer: current evidence and contemporary state of practice.']"""

Specific, cell-permeable inhibitors of protein kinase A abolish CTR-stimulated invasion of PC cells. Since PKA is ubiquitously distributed in cells, the present study examined the mechanism(s) by which CTR-stimulated PKA activity is regulated in time and space. CT reduced cell adhesion but increased invasion of PC cells. Both these actions were abolished by st-Ht31 inhibitory peptide suggesting the involvement of an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) in CT action. Next, we identified the AKAP associated with CT action by the subtraction of potential AKAP candidates using siRNAs. Knock-down of membrane-associated AKAP2, but not other AKAPs, abolished CT-stimulated invasion. Stable knock-down of AKAP2 in PC3-CTR cells remarkably decreased their cell proliferation, invasion, clonogenicity and ability to form orthotopic tumors and distant metastases in nude mice. Re-expression of AKAP2-wt restored these characteristics. Primary PC specimens displayed remarkable upregulation of CTR/AKAP2 expression as compared to benign prostates. Metastatic cancers displayed significantly higher CTR/AKAP2 expression than localized cancers. These results for the first time demonstrate that AKAP2 is expressed in human prostates, its expression is elevated in metastatic prostate cancer, and the knock-down of its expression remarkably decreased tumorigenicity and metastatic ability of prostate cancer cells.

Previous research identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) principally associated with circulating PSA levels rather than with prostate cancer risk (TERT rs2736098, FGFR2 rs10788160, TBX3 rs11067228, KLK3 rs17632542). Removing the genetic contribution to PSA levels may improve the ability of the remaining biologically-determined variation in PSA to discriminate between high and low risk of progression within men with identified prostate cancer. We investigate whether incorporating information on the PSA-SNPs improves the discrimination achieved by a single PSA threshold in men with raised PSA levels.  Materials and methods:   Men with PSA between 3-10 ng/mL and histologically-confirmed prostate cancer were categorised as high or low risk of progression (Low risk: Gleason score≤6 and stage T1-T2a; High risk: Gleason score 7-10 or stage T2C). We used the combined genetic effect of the four PSA-SNPs to calculate a genetically corrected PSA risk score. We calculated the Area under the Curve (AUC) to determine how well genetically corrected PSA risk scores distinguished men at high risk of progression from low risk men.  Results:   The analysis includes 868 men with prostate cancer (Low risk: 684 (78.8%); High risk: 184 (21.2%)). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicate that including the 4 PSA-SNPs does not improve the performance of measured PSA as a screening tool for high/low risk prostate cancer (measured PSA level AUC = 59.5% (95% CI: 54.7,64.2) vs additionally including information from the 4 PSA-SNPs AUC = 59.8% (95% CI: 55.2,64.5) (p-value = 0.40)).  Conclusion:   We demonstrate that genetically correcting PSA for the combined genetic effect of four PSA-SNPs, did not improve discrimination between high and low risk prostate cancer in men with raised PSA levels (3-10 ng/mL).

Methods:   For analysis we used 251 cancer cases and 246 age-matched non-cancer cases from the San Antonio Biomarkers Of Risk (SABOR) screening study. For cancer cases, pre-diagnostic serum was utilized for sarcosine measurement. Controls were defined as men who had been followed at least for 5 years on study with no prostate cancer diagnosis; sarcosine was measured on the initial baseline serum. HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used for serum sarcosine quantification. The association of sarcosine with prostate cancer was assessed using area underneath the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), and logistic regression adjusting for PSA, digital rectal exam, family history, age, race, and history of a prior negative biopsy. Among cancer cases, nominal logistic regression was used for the association of sarcosine with Gleason grade.  Results:   Sarcosine levels were overlapping between the prostate cancer cases (median 15.8 uM, range 6.2 to 42.5 uM) and controls (median 16.2 uM, range 6.4 to 53.6 uM).

However, the molecular determinants of PC metastasis are unclear. Previously, we reported that germline variation influences metastasis in the C57BL/6-Tg(TRAMP)8247Ng/J (TRAMP) mouse model of PC. These mice develop prostate tumors similar to a subset of poor outcome, treatment-associated human PC tumors. Here, we used TRAMP mice to nominate candidate genes and validate their role in aggressive human PC in PC datasets and cell lines. Candidate metastasis susceptibility genes were identified through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in 201 (TRAMP × PWK/PhJ) F2 males. Two metastasis-associated QTLs were identified; one on chromosome 12 (LOD = 5.86), and one on chromosome 14 (LOD = 4.41). Correlation analysis using microarray data from (TRAMP × PWK/PhJ) F2 prostate tumors identified 35 metastasis-associated transcripts within the two loci. The role of these genes in susceptibility to aggressive human PC was determined through in silico analysis using multiple datasets. First, analysis of candidate gene expression in two human PC datasets demonstrated that five candidate genes were associated with an increased risk of aggressive disease and lower disease-free survival. Second, four of these genes (GNL3, MAT1A, SKA3, and ZMYM5) harbored SNPs associated with aggressive tumorigenesis in the PLCO/CGEMS GWAS of 1172 PC patients. Finally, over-expression of GNL3 and SKA3 in the PC-3 human PC cell line decreased in vitro cell migration and invasion.

Acute genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities occurred in 105 (49%) and 98 patients (45.8%), respectively, with only 2 cases of grade III GI toxicity. Late GU and GI toxicities occurred in 17 (7.9%) and 20 (9.3%) patients, respectively, with 1 grade III GI toxicity and 2 grade III GU toxicities. Risk factors for late toxicity were age and RT dose and technique, which were unrelated to acute toxicity.

Particularly in prostate cancer, several reports have suggested that ASA plays a role in improved outcomes. Therefore, we studied the role of ASA in a uniquely African American population, which is known to harbor more aggressive and biologically different disease compared to the general population.  Methods:   We identified 289 African American men with prostate cancer who were treated with definitive radiation therapy to a dose of ≥7560 cGy. The median follow-up was 76 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze biochemical failure-free survival (bFFS), distant progression-free survival (DMPFS), and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS). Multivariate Cox regression was used to analyze the impact of covariates on all endpoints.  Results:   There were 147 men who were ASA+ and 142 who were ASA-. The 7-year bFFS was 80.9% for ASA+ men and 70.3% for ASA- men (p = 0.03). On multivariate analysis, ASA use was associated with a significant reduction in biochemical recurrences (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.93, p = 0.03). The 7-year DMPFS was 98.4% for ASA+ and 91.8% for ASA- men (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, ASA use was associated with a decreased risk of distant metastases (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06-0.91, p = 0.04). The 7-year PCSS was 99.3% for ASA+ and 96.9% for ASA- men (p = 0.07).  Conclusions:   In this study, ASA use was associated with improved biochemical outcomes and reduced distant metastases.

AKR1C3 protein is elevated within prostate cancer tissue, it contributes to the formation of androgens and downstream stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). Elevated expression of AKR1C3 is also reported in acute myeloid leukemia but the target nuclear receptors have been identified as members of the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPARs) subfamily. Thus, AKR1C3 cancer biology is likely to be tissue dependent and hormonally linked to the availability of ligands for both the steroidogenic and non-steroidogenic nuclear receptors.  Methods:   In the current study we investigated the potential for AKR1C3 to regulate the availability of prostaglandin-derived ligands for PPARg mainly, prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2). Using prostate cancer cell lines with stably reduced AKR1C3 levels we examined the impact of AKR1C3 upon proliferation mediated by PPAR ligands.  Results:   These studies revealed knockdown of AKR1C3 had no effect upon the sensitivity of androgen receptor independent prostate cancer cells towards PPAR ligands. However, the reduction of levels of AKR1C3 was accompanied by a significantly reduced mRNA expression of a range of HDACs, transcriptional co-regulators, and increased sensitivity towards SAHA, a clinically approved histone deacetylase inhibitor.  Conclusions:   These results suggest a hitherto unidentified link between AKR1C3 levels and the epigenetic status in prostate cancer cells. This raises an interesting possibility of a novel rational to target AKR1C3, the utilization of AKRIC3 selective inhibitors in combination with HDAC inhibition as part of novel epigenetic therapies in androgen deprivation therapy recurrent prostate cancer.""","""['Craig L Doig', 'Sebastiano Battaglia', 'Farhat L Khanim', 'Christopher M Bunce', 'Moray J Campbell']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['AKR1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/prostaglandin F synthase): Roles in malignancy and endocrine disorders.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 mediated prostaglandin D2 metabolism augments the PI3K/Akt proliferative signaling pathway in human prostate cancer cells.', 'The Steroidogenic Enzyme AKR1C3 Regulates Stability of the Ubiquitin Ligase Siah2 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Novel inhibition of AKR1C3 and androgen receptor axis by PTUPB synergizes enzalutamide treatment in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Plasma Exosomal AKR1C3 mRNA Expression Is a Predictive and Prognostic Biomarker in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic values of AKR1C3 and AKR1D1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Data-driven human transcriptomic modules determined by independent component analysis.', 'AKR1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/prostaglandin F synthase): Roles in malignancy and endocrine disorders.']"""

Methods:   Three types of errors in Multi Leaf Collimator (MLC) position and dose delivery were simulated separately in the delivery of five prostate and five head and neck (H&N) VMAT plans: (i) Gantry independent: a systematic shift in MLC position and variation in output to the whole arc; (ii) Gantry dependent: sag in MLC position and output variation as a function of gantry angle; (iii) Control point specific MLC and output errors introduced to only a specific number of Control Points (CP). The difference in local and global gamma (γ) pass rate between the no-error and error-simulated measurements with 2%/2 mm and 3%/3 mm tolerances was calculated to assess the sensitivity of ArcCHECK.

The Statistical Decomposition Algorithm (SDA) is a method for automatically generating sCT images from a single MR image volume, based on automatic tissue classification in combination with a model trained using a multimodal template material. This study compares dose calculations between sCT generated by the SDA and conventional CT in the male pelvic region.  Methods:   The study comprised ten prostate cancer patients, for whom a 3D T2 weighted MRI and a conventional planning CT were acquired. For each patient, sCT images were generated from the acquired MRI using the SDA. In order to decouple the effect of variations in patient geometry between imaging modalities from the effect of uncertainties in the SDA, the conventional CT was nonrigidly registered to the MRI to assure that their geometries were well aligned. For each patient, a volumetric modulated arc therapy plan was created for the registered CT (rCT) and recalculated for both the sCT and the conventional CT. The results were evaluated using several methods, including mean average error (MAE), a set of dose-volume histogram parameters, and a restrictive gamma criterion (2% local dose/1 mm).  Results:   The MAE within the body contour was 36.5 ± 4.1 (1 s.d.) HU between sCT and rCT. Average mean absorbed dose difference to target was 0.0% ± 0.2% (1 s.d.) between sCT and rCT, whereas it was -0.3% ± 0.3% (1 s.d.) between CT and rCT. The average gamma pass rate was 99.9% for sCT vs rCT, whereas it was 90.3% for CT vs rCT.  Conclusions:   The SDA enables a highly accurate MRI only workflow in prostate radiotherapy planning. The dosimetric uncertainties originating from the SDA appear negligible and are notably lower than the uncertainties introduced by variations in patient geometry between imaging sessions.""","""['Carl Siversson', 'Fredrik Nordström', 'Terese Nilsson', 'Tufve Nyholm', 'Joakim Jonsson', 'Adalsteinn Gunnlaugsson', 'Lars E Olsson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'Investigating the generalisation of an atlas-based synthetic-CT algorithm to another centre and MR scanner for prostate MR-only radiotherapy.', 'A dual model HU conversion from MRI intensity values within and outside of bone segment for MRI-based radiotherapy treatment planning of prostate cancer.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'A review of substitute CT generation for MRI-only radiation therapy.', 'Clinical validation of MR imaging time reduction for substitute/synthetic CT generation for prostate MRI-only treatment planning.', 'Improving the clinical workflow of a MR-Linac by dosimetric evaluation of synthetic CT.', 'History of Technological Advancements towards MR-Linac: The Future of Image-Guided Radiotherapy.', 'Possibilities and challenges when using synthetic computed tomography in an adaptive carbon-ion treatment workflow.', 'Development of an anthropomorphic multimodality pelvic phantom for quantitative evaluation of a deep-learning-based synthetic computed tomography generation technique.']"""

Methods:   Five patients with low or intermediate risk prostate cancer were evaluated retrospectively in this IRB-approved study. For each patient, a VMAT plan with one 358° arc was generated on the planning CT (PCT) to deliver 78 Gy in 39 fractions. Five representative pretreatment cone beam CTs (CBCT) were selected for each patient. The CBCT images were registered to PCT by a human observer, which consisted of an initial automated registration with three degrees-of-freedom, followed by manual adjustment for agreement at the prostate/rectal wall interface. To determine the optimal treatment position for each CBCT, a search was performed centering on the observer-matched position (OM-position) utilizing a score function based on radiobiological and dosimetric indices (EUDprostate, D99prostate, NTCPrectum, and NTCPbladder) for the prostate, rectum, and bladder. We termed the optimal treatment position the radiobiologically optimized couch shift position (ROCS-position).  Results:   The dosimetric indices, averaged over the five patients' treatment plans, were (mean ± SD) 79.5 ± 0.3 Gy (EUDprostate), 78.2 ± 0.4 Gy (D99prostate), 11.1% ± 2.7% (NTCPrectum), and 46.9% ± 7.6% (NTCPbladder). The corresponding values from CBCT at the OM-positions were 79.5 ± 0.6 Gy (EUDprostate), 77.8 ± 0.7 Gy (D99prostate), 12.1% ± 5.6% (NTCPrectum), and 51.6% ± 15.2% (NTCPbladder), respectively. In comparison, from CBCT at the ROCS-positions, the dosimetric indices were 79.5 ± 0.6 Gy (EUDprostate), 77.3 ± 0.6 Gy (D99prostate), 8.0% ± 3.3% (NTCPrectum), and 46.9% ± 15.7% (NTCPbladder). Excessive NTCPrectum was observed on Patient 5 (19.5% ± 6.6%) corresponding to localization at OM-position, compared to the planned value of 11.7%. This was mitigated with radiobiologically optimized localization, resulting in a reduced NTCPrectum value of 11.3% ± 3.5%.

Methods:   The authors propose to project the navigated plan onto the Pareto surface as a postprocessing step to the navigation. The projection attempts to find a Pareto optimal plan that is at least as good as or better than the initial navigated plan with respect to all objective functions. An augmented form of projection is also suggested where dose-volume histogram constraints are used to prevent that the projection causes a violation of some clinical goal. The projections were evaluated with respect to planning for intensity modulated radiation therapy delivered by step-and-shoot and sliding window and spot-scanned intensity modulated proton therapy. Retrospective plans were generated for a prostate and a head and neck case.  Results:   The projections led to improved dose conformity and better sparing of organs at risk (OARs) for all three delivery techniques and both patient cases. The mean dose to OARs decreased by 3.1 Gy on average for the unconstrained form of the projection and by 2.0 Gy on average when dose-volume histogram constraints were used. No consistent improvements in target homogeneity were observed.  Conclusions:   There are situations when Pareto navigation leaves room for improvement in OAR sparing and dose conformity, for example, if the approximation of the Pareto surface is coarse or the problem formulation has too permissive constraints.

However, as with most therapeutic agents, there is a difference in clinical efficacy among patients receiving PPV. Therefore, a useful biomarker is urgently needed for prognosticating clinical outcomes to preselect patients who would benefit the most from PPV. In this retrospective study, to detect a molecular prognosticator of clinical outcomes for PPV, we analyzed whole-genome gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients before administration of PPV. Cox regression analysis revealed that mRNA expression of myeloperoxidase, haptoglobin, and neutrophil elastase was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) among vaccinated CRPC patients (adjusted P < 0.01). By promoter sequence analysis of these three genes, we found that rs5472 of haptoglobin (HP), an acute-phase plasma glycoprotein, was strongly correlated to OS of vaccinated CRPC patients (P = 0.0047, hazard ratio 0.47; 95 % confidence interval 0.28-0.80). Furthermore, both HP mRNA expression in PBMCs and protein level in plasma of CRPC patients before administration of PPV exhibited rs5472 dependence (P < 0.001 for mRNA expression and P < 0.05 for protein level).

Median age was 72 years (range 48-87 years), and the median PSA level at the time of FCH PET/CT scan was 4.41 ng/mL (0.22-18.13 ng/mL). 45 patients (34.4%) had a Gleason score (GS) >7, and the residual subjects had a GS ≤ 7. The assessment of true or false-positive FCH PET/CT findings was made by magnetic resonance imaging (n = 34) and/or biopsy in 75/131 cases. A χ (2) test and a Z Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were used to assess the correlation between clinical variables (age, PSA, GS, type of therapy) and FCH PET/CT findings.  Results:   FCH PET/CT resulted truly positive (TP) for recurrent disease in the prostatic gland/fossa in 59/75 patients (79%) and falsely positive (FP) in 16 subjects (21%). The median value of PSA at the time of FCH PET/CT scan was higher in TP as compared to FP, although not statistically significant (4.76 vs. 3.04 ng/mL p > 0.05). Similarly, median age, GS categories, and the type of therapy were similar between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, when matching GS categories and PSA values, we found that the number of patients with TP findings were higher in the case of a PSA > 2 ng/mL, independently from the GS (ranging between 74% and 92%). Conversely, FP rate ranged between 50% and 65% in patients with a PSA ≤ 2 ng/mL, especially in the case of GS ≤ 7, whereas FP was around 25% in those with a GS >7 and PSA > 2 ng/mL.

Low risk stage I non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, which are confined to the testes, are commonly treated by orchiectomy and surveillance. Up to 20 % of patients with this diagnosis relapse, usually within 1-2 years of follow up, but very rarely after more than 5 years. The most common sites of relapse are the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the mediastinum, and the lungs. We describe a case of relapse in the prostate over 20 years after initial diagnosis, which has not been described in the literature so far.  Case presentation:   This report presents a 49-year-old white British man with relapsed testicular non-seminomatous germ cell tumour 22 years after initial treatment with orchidectomy only. He relapsed with a prostatic mass, haematospermia and back pain. His prostate specific antigen levels were within normal range. Alpha feto-protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels were elevated, and his human chorionic gonadotrophin levels were normal. A biopsy confirmed undifferentiated malignant tumour, shown immunohistochemically to be a yolk sac tumour. The patient was initially treated with bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy, but developed bleomycin-related pulmonary side effects after two cycles. His treatment was changed and he completed four cycles of chemotherapy by receiving two cycles of etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin. Post treatment blood tumour markers were normal, but a follow up computed tomography showed a mass in the base of the prostate, the trigone and the left distal ureter which was surgically resected. The histology from the surgical resection was of necrotic tissue. The patient is now in follow up at 3 years after treatment with no evidence of residual disease on computed tomography. His Alpha feto-protein, beta human chorionic gonadotrophin and lactate dehydrogenase levels are normal.  Conclusions:   Very late relapse in stage I non-seminomatous germ cell tumours is extremely rare and the prostate is a highly unusual site of relapsed disease. For diagnosis of late relapse, this case confirms the value of serum biomarkers in germ cell tumours, in particular non-seminomatous germ cell tumours.""","""['Tobias Janowitz', 'Sarah Welsh', 'Anne Y Warren', 'Jane Robson', 'Benjamin Thomas', 'Ashley Shaw', 'Nicola L Ainsworth', 'David E Neal', 'Danish Mazhar']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Res Notes""","""['Urologic treatment of testicular germ cell cancer.', 'A case of spermatic cord teratoma in low-stage testicular cancer managed by surveillance.', 'Orchidectomy alone in testicular stage I non-seminomatous germ-cell tumours.', 'Histological outcome of delayed orchidectomy after primary chemotherapy for metastatic germ cell tumour of the testis.', 'Clinical presentation of testicular germinal cancer.', 'Primary undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells in liver and rapidly developing multiple metastases after curative hepatectomy: a case report.']"""

To investigate the comprehensive effect of FTOrs8050136 polymorphism on cancer risk based on a pooled result. Carcinogenesis is closely related to obesity. Both obesity and cancer share common pathogenic factors such as hereditary susceptibility and environmental predisposition. Recently, several studies had reported that the FTOrs8050136 polymorphism, a genetic variation highly associated with obesity, can be a potential cancer risk factor, while these results were inconsistent. With the help of PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure considerable research was done for potential studies without language restriction. Pooled odds ratio combined with 95 % confidence interval was employed to evaluate the potential correlations, and subgroup analyses were performed based on the cancer types and ethnic populations. There were eight articles comprising 21,810 cases and 85,070 controls met the eligibility criteria. Overall, there was no significant association between the FTOrs8050136 polymorphism and cancer risk (P = 0.163). Subgroup analysis illustrated that no association existed between the FTOrs8050136 polymorphism and cancer risk in Caucasians (P = 0.809), Asians (P = 0.412) and the mixed population (P = 0.093). With regard to cancer types, the result suggested that the FTOrs8050136 polymorphism had no connection with pancreatic cancer (P = 0.089), endometrial cancer (P = 0.353), prostate cancer (P = 0.578), colorectal cancer (P = 0.054) and melanoma (P = 0.357), while the inverse result was obtained in the subgroup of papillary thyroid cancer (P = 0.010).

The aim of this study is to analyze the rate of PSMs according to preoperative risk groups in a large cohort of patients treated with RARP and ORP in a single institution with standardized surgical technique and pathological examination.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated 6,194 consecutive patients with PCa undergoing either ORP (71.1%) or RARP (28.9%) between 1992 and 2014. Logistic regression analyses were used to test the association between type of surgery and PSMs in each preoperative risk group (low vs. intermediate vs. high) after adjusting for confounders.  Results:   Overall, 21.6% patients had PSMs. RARP was associated with a lower rate of PSMs in low-risk (11.5 vs. 15.4%, P = 0.01), intermediate-risk (18.9 vs. 23.5%, P = 0.008), and high-risk patients (19.7 vs. 30.1%, P<0.001). In multivariable analyses, after stratification according to risk group categories, no difference in PSMs between RARP and ORP was observed for low-risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.87, P = 0.46) and intermediate-risk patients (OR = 0.84, P = 0.19). Conversely, RARP was associated with lower odds of PSMs in high-risk patients (OR = 0.69, P = 0.04). Similar results were observed when our analyses were repeated after accounting for pathological characteristics, in patients treated between 2006 and 2014 and in a cohort of men treated by high-volume surgeons (all P≤ 0.03).

Treatment of ESCC is largely ineffective due to lack of detection at early stages of the disease. In recent years, miRNA, a small RNA molecule, has drawn much attention to researchers as a potential biomarker for esophageal cancer. miR-93 and miR-143 are two miRNA molecules reported to be frequently deregulated in various cancers, including prostate, stomach, cervix, and etc. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression levels of these miRNAs and evaluate their diagnostic and therapeutic potential in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, total RNA was extracted from 30 tumor tissues and 30 nontumor tissues of esophageal tumor margins, using RNX-plus solution. After validating the quality and quantity of total RNA, cDNAs of interest were synthesized using microRNA-specific cDNA Synthesis Kit. The expression level of miR-93 and miR-143 was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR with miRNA-specific primers. Finally, the obtained data was analyzed by SPSS ver.20 software and paired t test was performed to observe the significance of difference between groups. The expression level of miR-93 was significantly increased and of miR-143 was significantly decreased in most of the examined tumor tissues, compared to nontumor tissues. Also, our findings did not detect correlation between mir-93 and mir-143 expressions in regard to stage and grade of the samples. These findings suggest that the deregulation of these miRNAs may play an important role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Both miR-93 and miR-143 might be used as potential biomarkers in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Pain flare, a transient worsening of the bone pain after RT, has been described in previous reports with different incidence rates. The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate the incidence of pain flare following RT for painful bone metastases and evaluate its effects on pain control and functionality of the patients.  Methods:   Between June 2010 and June 2014, 204 patients were enrolled in this study and 135 patients with complete data were evaluable. Pain flare was defined as a 2- point increase in worst pain score as compared with baseline with no decrease in analgesic intake or a 25% increase in analgesic intake as compared with baseline with no decrease in worst pain score. All pain medications and worst pain scores were collected before, daily during, and for 10 days after RT. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was filled out on the pretreatment and at the 4 weeks follow-up visit.  Results:   There were 90 men (66.7%) and 45 women (33.3%). Mean age was 66 years (SD 9.8). The most common primary cancer site was lung in 42 patients (31.1%), followed by prostate in 27 patients (20.0%). Forty-two patients (31.1%) patients received a single fraction of 8 Gy and 83 (61.5%) received 20 Gy in five fractions. The overall pain flare incidence across all centers was 51/135 (37.7%). The majority of pain flares occurred on days 1-5 (88.2%). The mean duration of the pain flare was 3 days (SD: 3). There were no significant relationships between the occurrence of pain flare and collected variables. All BPI items measured four weeks after end of RT showed significant improvement as compared with pretreatment scores (p < 0.001). No significant differences in BPI time trends were found between patients with and without flare pain.  Conclusion:   Pain flare is a common event, occurring in nearly 40% of the patients that receive palliative RT for symptomatic bone metastases.

Physical activity and exercise can positively influence such side effects and improve quality of life. However, the majority of prostate cancer survivors are not physically active. Thus, supportive interventions, such as supervised exercise programs, are necessary.

Methods/design:   The ProCaLife study is a quasi-randomized controlled intervention trial evaluating a specific 26-week physical exercise program for prostate cancer survivors in the rehabilitation phase following medical treatment. Participants are assigned to one of two intervention groups (supervised multi-modal physical exercise including or not including further behavior-oriented techniques) or a control group (not receiving any supervised intervention). Exercise sessions are performed twice weekly and contain specific aerobic, strengthening, flexibility, balance, relaxation and pelvic floor/sphincter exercises as well as mixed games. Behavior-oriented techniques include physical activity-related knowledge transfer and barriers management. The primary endpoint quality of life and secondary psychological/psychosocial, urological, physical fitness and physical activity outcomes are assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up time points.

In recent years, SL has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer: by targeting the SL partners of altered genes in cancer cells, these cells can be selectively killed while sparing the normal cells. Consequently, a number of studies have attempted prediction of SL interactions in human, a majority by extrapolating SL interactions inferred through large-scale screens in model organisms. However, these predicted SL interactions either do not hold in human cells or do not include genes that are (frequently) altered in human cancers, and are therefore not attractive in the context of cancer therapy.  Results:   Here, we develop a computational approach to infer SL interactions directly from frequently altered genes in human cancers. It is based on the observation that pairs of genes that are altered in a (significantly) mutually exclusive manner in cancers are likely to constitute lethal combinations. Using genomic copy-number and gene-expression data from four cancers, breast, prostate, ovarian and uterine (total 3980 samples) from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identify 718 genes that are frequently amplified or upregulated, and are likely to be synthetic lethal with six key DNA-damage response (DDR) genes in these cancers. By comparing with published data on gene essentiality (~16000 genes) from ten DDR-deficient cancer cell lines, we show that our identified genes are enriched among the top quartile of essential genes in these cell lines, implying that our inferred genes are highly likely to be (synthetic) lethal upon knockdown in these cell lines. Among the inferred targets are tousled-like kinase 2 (TLK2) and the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 7 (USP7) whose overexpression correlates with poor survival in cancers.  Conclusion:   Mutual exclusivity between frequently occurring genetic events identifies synthetic lethal combinations in cancers. These identified genes are essential in cell lines, and are potential candidates for targeted cancer therapy.

We addressed here the question of whether a common DNA methylation signature of invasion exists in cancer cells from different origins that differentiates invasive from non-invasive cells. We identified a common DNA methylation signature consisting of hyper- and hypomethylation and determined the overlap of differences in DNA methylation with differences in mRNA expression using expression array analyses. A pathway analysis reveals that the hypomethylation signature includes some of the major pathways that were previously implicated in cancer migration and invasion such as TGF beta and ERBB2 triggered pathways. The relevance of these hypomethylation events in human tumors was validated by identification of the signature in several publicly available databases of human tumor transcriptomes. We shortlisted novel invasion promoting candidates and tested the role of four genes in cellular invasiveness from the list C11orf68, G0S2, SHISA2 and TMEM156 in invasiveness using siRNA depletion. Importantly these genes are upregulated in human cancer specimens as determined by immunostaining of human normal and cancer breast, liver and prostate tissue arrays. Since these genes are activated in cancer they constitute a group of targets for specific pharmacological inhibitors of cancer invasiveness.

Methods:   Three large prospective population-based studies (the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study; the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial; and the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Study) were pooled to investigate the association between self-reported frequency of aspirin and nonaspirin NSAID use one year prior to baseline (no use, ≤ 2/week, >2-6/week, and ≥ 7/week) and subsequent risk of thyroid cancer. A Cox regression proportional hazard model was used to estimate aggregated hazard ratios (HR) adjusted for cohort, sex, race/ethnicity, weight, smoking status, and alcohol intake.  Results:   There were 388,577 participants in the pooled cohort, with 481 cases of thyroid cancer. No significant risk reduction was observed with regular use of nonaspirin NSAIDs (HR = 1.14 [confidence interval (CI) 0.84-1.55]), and/or regular use of aspirin (HR = 1.06 [CI 0.82-1.39]). The multivariate regression analysis confirmed as previously reported in the literature that female sex, obesity class I (body mass index [BMI] = 30-34.99 kg/m(2)), and obesity class II (BMI = 35-35.99 kg/m(2)) were independently associated with an increased thyroid cancer risk. Current smoking status and moderate and excessive alcohol use were also confirmed as independent risk factors associated with a reduced thyroid cancer risk.  Conclusions:   Neither nonaspirin NSAIDs nor aspirin use is associated with a reduced risk of thyroid cancer. Women and obesity are associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, whereas smoking and alcohol use are associated with decreased risk of thyroid cancer.""","""['Dhaval Patel', 'Cari M Kitahara', 'Yikyung Park', 'Linda M Liao', 'Martha Linet', 'Electron Kebebew', 'Naris Nilubol']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Thyroid""","""['Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and bladder cancer: a pooled analysis.', 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of prostate cancer in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.', ""Association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the incidence of lung cancer in the Iowa women's health study."", 'Body mass index and cancer incidence:a prospective cohort study in northern China.', 'Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and ovarian cancer risk: findings from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study and systematic review.', 'Correlation between obesity and clinicopathological characteristics in patients with papillary thyroid cancer: a study of 1579 cases: a retrospective study.', 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially aspirin, are linked to lower risk and better survival of hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis.', 'Associations between aspirin use and the risk of cancers: a meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'The changing incidence of thyroid cancer.']"""

We conducted a population-based cohort study to determine whether using statins in prostate cancer patients is associated with reduced all-cause mortality rates. Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The study cohort comprised 5179 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer who used statins for at least 6 months between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2010. To form a comparison group, each patient was randomly frequency-matched (according to age and index date) with a prostate cancer patient who did not use any type of statin-based drugs during the study period. The study endpoint was mortality. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using Cox regression models. Among prostate cancer patients, statin use was associated with significantly decreased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.60-0.71). This phenomenon was observed among various types of statin, age groups, and treatment methods. Analyzing the defined daily dose of statins indicated that both low- and high-dose groups exhibited significantly decreased death rates compared with nonusers, suggesting a dose-response relationship. The results of this population-based cohort study suggest that using statins reduces all-cause mortality among prostate cancer patients, and a dose-response relationship may exist.""","""['Li-Min Sun', 'Ming-Chia Lin', 'Cheng-Li Lin', 'Shih-Ni Chang', 'Ji-An Liang', 'I-Ching Lin', 'Chia-Hung Kao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Statin Use and Prostate Cancer Survival in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Statin Use and the Risk of Prostate Cancer in Ischemic Heart Disease Patients in Taiwan.', 'Prostate cancer survival among statin users after prostatectomy in a Finnish nationwide cohort.', 'Postdiagnosis Statin Use and Mortality in Danish Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Association between statins and clinical outcomes among men with prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association Between Statin Exposure and Incidence and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis Based on Observational Studies.', 'Statin Use and Survival Among Men Receiving Androgen-Ablative Therapies for Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Statin Use Is Associated with Better Prognosis of Patients with Prostate Cancer after Definite Therapies: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.', 'Effect of Statins on All-Cause Mortality in Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Propensity Score-Matched Studies.', 'The Association of Prediagnostic Statin Use with Aggressive Prostate Cancer from the Multiethnic Cohort Study.']"""

After treatment with BSN and CAP at various concentrations, the synergistic cytotoxic effect of PC-3 cells was analyzed by MTT method, proliferation, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, colony formation, and Western blotting. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of BSN and CAP on the constitutive expressions of MMP-9/2, their enzymatic activities, cellular migration, and cell invasion were also investigated. The cytotoxicity was synergistically increased in combination compared with the single drug used; moreover, proliferation, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and colony formation were significantly suppressed and anti-apoptotic-, proliferative-, and metastatic-related proteins were clearly abolished in the combination group. Besides, constitutive MMP-9/2 expression, their enzymatic activities, cell migration, and tumor cell invasion were inhibited, and TIMP-1 was up-regulated in the combination group in PC-3 cells.

Although predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, there is evidence that Mcl-1 exhibits nuclear localization where it is thought to protect against DNA damage-induced cell death. The role of Mcl-1 in mediating resistance to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in prostate cancer (PCa) is not known. We show in human PCa cell lines and in TRAMP, a transgenic mouse model of PCa, that the combination of the antimitotic agent ENMD-1198 (analog of 2-methoxyestradiol) with betulinic acid (BA, increases proteotoxic stress) targets Mcl-1 by increasing its proteasomal degradation, resulting in increased γH2AX (DNA damage) and apoptotic/necrotic cell death. Knockdown of Mcl-1 in CRPC cells leads to elevated γH2AX, DNA strand breaks, and cell death after treatment with 1198 + BA- or doxorubicin. Additional knockdowns in PC3 cells suggests that cytoplasmic Mcl-1 protects against DNA damage by blocking the mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor and thereby preventing its nuclear translocation and subsequent interaction with the cyclophilin A endonuclease. Overall, our results suggest that chemotherapeutic agents that target Mcl-1 will promote cell death in response to DNA damage, particularly in CRPC.""","""['Teresita Reiner', 'Alicia de Las Pozas', 'Ricardo Parrondo', 'Deanna Palenzuela', 'William Cayuso', 'Priyamvada Rai', 'Carlos Perez-Stable']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncoscience""","""['ABT-737, a small molecule Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist, increases antimitotic-mediated apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Multifocal Signal Modulation Therapy by Celecoxib: A Strategy for Managing Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Corosolic acid, a natural triterpenoid, induces ER stress-dependent apoptosis in human castration resistant prostate cancer cells via activation of IRE-1/JNK, PERK/CHOP and TRIB3.', 'Is cisplatin-induced cell death always produced by apoptosis?', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', '5,6-Dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through inhibiting of Mcl-1 expression.', 'Inducing apoptosis by using microRNA in radio-resistant prostate cancer: an in-silico study with an in-vitro validation.', 'Protein Levels of Anti-Apoptotic Mcl-1 and the Deubiquitinase USP9x Are Cooperatively Upregulated during Prostate Cancer Progression and Limit Response of Prostate Cancer Cells to Radiotherapy.', 'Identification of F-Box/SPRY Domain-Containing Protein 1 (FBXO45) as a Prognostic Biomarker for TMPRSS2-ERG-Positive Primary Prostate Cancers.', 'Myeloid cell leukemia-1: a formidable barrier to anticancer therapeutics and the quest of targeting it.']"""

Various treatments have been suggested, including radiotherapy, antifibrinolytics, bladder irrigation with alum solution, transurethral surgery and angioembolization, none of which have proven effectiveness. In the last years cryoablation has become a valid therapeutic option for prostate cancer. In our experience we used this 'new' technique as haemostatic therapy.  Methods:   We selected four patients with gross haematuria affected by locally advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer, who had already been treated with primary radiotherapy. We used third-generation cryotherapy: under ultrasonographic guidance, we inserted six cryoprobes, two in each of the vascular pedicles reaching at least -60°C, and three thermometers. We then induced two freeze-thaw cycles.  Results:   After the operation the haematuria stopped in all patients and at 9-month follow up we observed a mean of four red cells (range three to five) in the urinary sediment with no evidence of bacteriuria. Prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen and postmicturition residue were significantly reduced. Qmax improved significantly too.  Conclusion:   Our experience has given us good results with minimal intra- and postoperative complications.

Flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that the derivative could realize the cellular uptake of nanoparticles in an energy-dependent and clathrin-mediated pathway and obtain a high DNAzyme concentration in the cytoplasm through further endosomal escape. After DNAzyme transfection, expression level of aurora kinase A would be downregulated at the protein level. Meanwhile, the inhibition of cell proliferation was observed through 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and cell colony formation assay, attributing to the activation of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Through flow cytometric analysis, an early apoptotic ratio of 25.93% and G2 phase of 22.58% has been detected after N-Ac-L-Leu-PEI-mediated DNAzyme transfection. Finally, wound healing and Transwell migration assay showed that DNAzyme transfection could efficiently inhibit the cell migration.

We obtained an average overall classification accuracy between 82.5% and 94%, which was higher than Support Vector Machine, Random Forest or a Sparse Bayesian GLM using double exponential priors. Additionally, SBGG outperforms the other 3 methods in correctly identifying pre-metastatic stages of cancer progression, which can prove extremely valuable for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Importantly, using Geneset Cohesion Analysis Tool, we found that the top 100 genes produced by SBGG had an average functional cohesion p-value of 2.0E-4 compared to 0.007 to 0.131 produced by the other methods.  Conclusions:   Using GDP in a Bayesian GLM model applied to cancer progression data results in better subclass prediction. In particular, the method identifies pre-metastatic stages of prostate cancer with substantially better accuracy and produces more functionally relevant gene sets.""","""['Behrouz Madahian', 'Sujoy Roy', 'Dale Bowman', 'Lih Y Deng', 'Ramin Homayouni']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['The Spike-and-Slab Lasso Generalized Linear Models for Prediction and Associated Genes Detection.', 'Gene expression profile class prediction using linear Bayesian classifiers.', 'Variational Bayes procedure for effective classification of tumor type with microarray gene expression data.', 'Relevance Vector Machines: Sparse Classification Methods for QSAR.', 'Bayesian neural networks for bivariate binary data: an application to prostate cancer study.', 'Proceedings of the 2015 MidSouth Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Society (MCBIOS) Conference.']"""

AMBRA1 and the autophagic protein sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1; p62) expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot on tissue samples from both benign and malignant prostatic lesions. The data reported in this pilot study demonstrated an increased expression of AMBRA1 and SQSTM1, which were also associated with an accumulation of LC3II in prostate cancer but not in benign lesion. In the present study we found that: (i) at variance with benign lesion, prostate cancer cells underwent SQSTM1 accumulation, i.e., clearly displayed a defective autophagic process but, also, (ii) prostate cancer accumulated AMBRA1 and (iii) this increase positively correlated with the Gleason score.

Both global and local 2D gamma evaluations were performed with criteria of 3%/3 mm, 2%/2 mm, 1%/2 mm and 2%/1 mm. In this study, the global and local gamma-index calculated the differences in doses relative to the maximum dose and the dose at the current measurement point, respectively. Using log files acquired during delivery, the differences in parameters at every control point between the VMAT plans and the log files were acquired. The differences in dose-volumetric parameters between reconstructed VMAT plans using the log files and the original VMAT plans were calculated. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (rs) were calculated between the passing rates and those differences.  Results:   Considerable correlations with statistical significances were observed between global 1%/2 mm, local 1%/2 mm and local 2%/1 mm and the MLC position differences (rs = -0.712, -0.628 and -0.581).

Methods:   Forty-two men with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy participated in the study. Pelvic floor muscles parameters were evaluated using the anal perineometer. An 8-hour pad test was used with the catheter removed.  Results:   The greatest change in strength occurred during the last 3 months, i.e., from the third to the sixth month following surgery (P ≤ 0.05). The average amount of urinary incontinence on the day of catheter removal was approximately 311 g per 8 hr. Urinary incontinence decreased by 93.6% from the day of catheter removal 6 months later. A strong correlation (P ≤ 0.001) of reverse dependence was determined between pelvic floor muscle strength before surgery and the amount of urinary incontinence 6 months following surgery.  Conclusion:   The greatest change of pelvic floor muscles strength and endurance occurred during the third to the sixth month following surgery. The greatest change in urinary incontinence occurred during the first month following surgery. Pelvic floor muscle strength causes a greater decrease in urinary incontinence than endurance. The greater the pelvic floor muscle strength before surgery, the lower the amount of urinary incontinence.

Methods:   A PET library was developed with 15 unique prostate-related educational modules relating to diagnosis, treatment options, and potential side effects. The PET collected data regarding its use, and those data were used to conduct a retrospective analysis.

We have previously shown in a murine model that prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) deficiency leads to increased cell proliferation and development of prostate adenocarcinoma. The association between PAP and prostate cancer has been reported. Indeed, high PAP enzymatic activity is detected in the serum of patients with metastatic disease while its expression is reduced in prostate cancer tissue. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the onset of the disease remains poorly understood. We previously identified a novel transmembrane prostatic acid phosphatase (TMPAP) isoform, which interacts with snapin. TMPAP is expressed on the plasma membrane, as well as endosomal/lysosomal and exosomal membrane vesicles by means of a tyrosine-based lysosomal targeting motif (Yxxϕ).  Methods:   We used stable overexpression of the secreted isoform (SPAP) and TMPAP in LNCaP cells, live cell imaging, microarray and qRT-PCR analyses, and fluid phase uptake of HRP and transferrin.  Results:   Our results indicate that the stable overexpression of TMPAP, but not SPAP in LNCaP cells reduces cell growth while increasing endo/exocytosis and cell size.

Therefore, we proposed to analyze Notch family members transcription and expression, including ligands (Dll1, 3, 4 and Jagged1 and 2), receptors (Notch1-4) and effectors (Hes1, 2, 5 and Hey1, 2, L), in both normal and tumor bearing mouse prostates to better understand the dynamics of Notch signaling in prostate tumorigenesis.  Methods:   Wild type mice and transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model (TRAMP) mice were sacrificed at 18, 24 or 30 weeks of age and the prostates collected and processed for either whole prostate or prostate cell specific populations mRNA analysis and for protein expression analysis by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.  Results:   We observed that Dll1 and Dll4 are expressed in the luminal compartment of the mouse healthy prostate, whereas Jagged2 expression is restricted to the basal and stromal compartment. Additionally, Notch2 and Notch4 are normally expressed in the prostate luminal compartment while Notch2 and Notch3 are also expressed in the stromal layer of the healthy prostate. As prostate tumor development takes place, there is up-regulation of Notch components. Particularly, the prostate tumor lesions have increased expression of Jagged1 and 2, of Notch3 and of Hey1. We have also detected the presence of activated Notch3 in prostatic tumors that co-express Jagged1 and ultimately the Hey1 effector.

We examine the effects of coffee on NF-κB and on the regulation of selected genes in human-derived prostate cancer cells (PC3) and in PC3 xenografts in athymic nude mice. PC3 cells stably transduced with an NF-κB-luciferase reporter were used both in vitro and for xenografts. NF-κB activity was measured by reporter assays, DNA binding and in vivo imaging. Gene expression was measured in PC3 cells, xenografts and tumor microenvironment by low-density arrays. Western blotting of activated caspases was used to quantify apoptosis. Coffee inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB activity and DNA-binding in PC3 cells. Furthermore, coffee increased apoptosis and modulated expression of a number of inflammation- and cancer-related genes in TNFα-treated PC3 cells. In vivo imaging revealed a 31% lower NF-κB-luciferase activation in the xenografts of the mice receiving 5% coffee compared to control mice. Interestingly, we observed major changes in gene expression in the PC3 cells in xenografts as compared to PC3 cells in vitro.

In hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is widely used, but an eventual failure on ADT heralds the passage to the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stage. Because predicting time to failure on ADT would allow improved planning of personal treatment strategy, we aimed to develop a predictive personalization algorithm for ADT efficacy in HSPC patients.  Methods:   A mathematical mechanistic model for HSPC progression and treatment was developed based on the underlying disease dynamics (represented by prostate-specific antigen; PSA) as affected by ADT. Following fine-tuning by a dataset of ADT-treated HSPC patients, the model was embedded in an algorithm, which predicts the patient's time to biochemical failure (BF) based on clinical metrics obtained before or early in-treatment.  Results:   The mechanistic model, including a tumor growth law with a dynamic power and an elaborate ADT-resistance mechanism, successfully retrieved individual time-courses of PSA (R(2) = 0.783). Using the personal Gleason score (GS) and PSA at diagnosis, as well as PSA dynamics from 6 months after ADT onset, and given the full ADT regimen, the personalization algorithm accurately predicted the individual time to BF of ADT in 90% of patients in the retrospective cohort (R(2) = 0.98).  Conclusions:   The algorithm we have developed, predicting biochemical failure based on routine clinical tests, could be especially useful for patients destined for short-lived ADT responses and quick progression to CRPC. Prospective studies must validate the utility of the algorithm for clinical decision-making.""","""['Moran Elishmereni', 'Yuri Kheifetz', 'Ilan Shukrun', 'Graham H Bevan', 'Debashis Nandy', 'Kyle M McKenzie', 'Manish Kohli', 'Zvia Agur']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Predictive factor analysis of time to progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy.', 'A simple prognostic model involving prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase and albumin for predicting the time required to progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer in patients who received androgen deprivation therapy.', 'The Role of PCA 3 as a Prognostic Factor in Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Treated with Docetaxel.', 'The utility of prostate-specific antigen in the management of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Hormone naïve prostate cancer: predicting and maximizing response intervals.', 'From Fitting the Average to Fitting the Individual: A Cautionary Tale for Mathematical Modelers.', 'Mathematical model of hormone sensitive prostate cancer treatment using leuprolide: A small step towards personalization.', 'Intermittent Hormone Therapy Models Analysis and Bayesian Model Comparison for Prostate Cancer.', 'Nomogram Incorporating Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography Predicting Time to the Development of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Personal response to immune checkpoint inhibitors of patients with advanced melanoma explained by a computational model of cellular immunity, tumor growth, and drug.']"""

The objectives of the study were to evaluate whether dosimetric differences exist and to investigate whether differences are dependent on patient body habitus.  Methods and materials:   Forty patients with various body habitus who had previously received treatment to the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes with VMAT techniques were chosen. Patients were planned in the Pinnacle(3) treatment planning system with double or triple SmartArc plans with 6- and 10-MV photon energies. All patients were optimized with the same planning objectives and normalized such that 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) received the prescription dose. Patients were evaluated for PTV and organ at risk (OAR) parameters for the bladder, rectum, small bowel, penile bulb, and sigmoid colon. Metrics used for comparison were D2%, D98%, homogeneity, conformity, and dose falloff for the PTV and D(2%), D(mean), V(80%), V(60%), and V(40%) for OARs. Statistical differences were evaluated with a paired-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test with a significance level of .05.  Results:   For the PTV, there were no statistically significant differences in D(mean), D(2cc), conformation number, and homogeneity index values, but the dose falloff parameters, R50 and R25, showed a median improvement of 6.7% (P<.01) and 6.2% (P<.01), respectively, with 10 MV. A correlation between patient anterior-posterior distance (d(AP)) and percentage reduction in R50 of 0.436% per centimeter (P<.01) was determined. For OARs, statistically significant reductions in dose metrics were found in the small bowel and bladder, but increases in the D(2cc) of 3.5% in the penile bulb (P<.01) and 0.2% in the rectum (P=.02) were shown with 10 MV. The use of 10 MV also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the total number of monitor units of 15.9% (P<.01) compared with 6 MV.  Conclusions:   The study showed that 10 MV provides a faster dose falloff than 6 MV for patients whose prostate and pelvic lymph nodes are treated using a VMAT technique irrespective of body habitus; however, the improvement in dose falloff is dependent on body habitus and increases as the patient body habitus increases.""","""['D N Stanley', 'T Popp', 'C S Ha', 'G P Swanson', 'T Y Eng', 'N Papanikolaou', 'A N Gutiérrez']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['The dosimetric effects of photon energy on the quality of prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Effect of photon-beam energy on VMAT and IMRT treatment plan quality and dosimetric accuracy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Improvement of conformal arc plans by using deformable margin delineation method for stereotactic lung radiotherapy.', 'Which photon energy for intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arctherapy in 2019?.', 'The use of Hybrid Techniques in Whole-Breast Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review.', 'VMAT for prostate cancer with 6-MV and 10-MV photons: Impact of beam energy on treatment plan quality and model-based secondary cancer risk estimates.', 'Defining the Optimal Time of Adaptive Replanning in Prostate Cancer Patients with Weight Change during Volumetric Arc Radiotherapy: A Dosimetric and Mathematical Analysis Using the Gamma Index.', 'Efficacy of a rectal spacer with prostate SABR-first UK experience.', 'Class solutions for SABR-VMAT for high-risk prostate cancer with and without elective nodal irradiation.']"""

Patients and method:   From 2003 to 2011, a total 567 men who presented out urological department completed the questionnaires including International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), incontinence-frequency score (IFS) from the UCLA prostate cancer index, MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Among 230 patients with no coexisting morbidity, the relations between each LUTS score of IPSS indices and IFS and 8 domain scores of SF-36 were analyzed by Pearson's product-moment correlation and stepwise multiple regression analysis.  Result:   Univariate analysis showed that the IFS had a significant correlation with all of 8 domain scores of SF-36, and also the IPSS item scores of urgency, nocturia and straining correlated significantly with multiple domain scores of SF-36. In multiple regression analysis, the proportionate contributions of LUTS to each SF-36 domain scores were low (R2 was 10% or less). Incontinence was considered as the most influential factor that had a negative impact on HRQOL in 7 SF-36 domains of physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning and mental health. Additionally, nocturia, straining and urgency were significantly associated with deficit of HRQOL in 4 SF-36 domains (role-physical, general health perception, role-emotional, mental health), 2 domains (bodily pain, social functioning) and 1 domain (role-emotional) of SF-36, respectively.

Dutasteride lowers prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, which may lead to delays in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). This study investigated patients who underwent prostate biopsy (PBx) while receiving dutasteride to investigate whether this agent affects the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.  Patients and methods:   PBx was performed on six patients receiving dutasteride for > 3 months at our medical institutions between January 2010 and June 2013. No patients underwent PBx before dutasteride administration. We performed PBx both for patients with high initial PSA levels and for those with elevated PSA levels with or without initial PSA decline after dutasteride administration. We also investigated clinicopathological findings.  Results:   Mean age at the start of administration was 69.5 ± 5.9 years (range, 59-77 years), mean duration of administration was 14.1 ± 7.4 months (range, 4.0-23.5 months), mean prostate volume at the start of administration was 70.4 ± 30.7 ml (range, 18.8-104.6 ml), and mean PSA level at the start of administration was 7.7 ± 3.3 ng/ml (range, 4.9-14.2 ng/ml). PSA density was 0.098 ± 0.045 ng/ml/cm3 (range, 0.042-0.181 ng/ml/cm3), and PSA level at PBx was 5.4 ± 2.7 ng/ml (range, 2.5-10.7 ng/ml). We detected three PCa patients, and clinical stage in each case was cT1cN0M0. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in two cases, and androgen-deprivation therapy was performed in one case.

However, accurate MR-TRUS registration remains a challenging task, due to the great intensity variation between two modalities, the lack of intrinsic fiducials within the prostate, the large gland deformation caused by the TRUS probe insertion, and distinctive biomechanical properties in patients and prostate zones. To address these challenges, a personalized model-to-surface registration approach is proposed in this study. The main contributions of this paper can be threefold. First, a new personalized statistical deformable model (PSDM) is proposed with the finite element analysis and the patient-specific tissue parameters measured from the ultrasound elastography. Second, a hybrid point matching method is developed by introducing the modality independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND) to weight the Euclidean distance between points to establish reliable surface point correspondence. Third, the hybrid point matching is further guided by the PSDM for more physically plausible deformation estimation. Eighteen sets of patient data are included to test the efficacy of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach provides more accurate and robust MR-TRUS registration than state-of-the-art methods do. The averaged target registration error is 1.44 mm, which meets the clinical requirement of 1.9 mm for the accurate tumor volume detection. It can be concluded that the presented method can effectively fuse the heterogeneous image information in the elastography, MR, and TRUS to attain satisfactory image alignment performance.""","""['Yi Wang', 'Jie-Zhi Cheng', 'Dong Ni', 'Muqing Lin', 'Jing Qin', 'Xiongbiao Luo', 'Ming Xu', 'Xiaoyan Xie', 'Pheng Ann Heng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Learning Non-rigid Deformations for Robust, Constrained Point-based Registration in Image-Guided MR-TRUS Prostate Intervention.', 'Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'Imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis: present role and future perspectives.', 'Meta-Learning Initializations for Interactive Medical Image Registration.', 'Machine Learning in Prostate MRI for Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Opportunities.', 'Fully automated quantification of in vivo viscoelasticity of prostate zones using magnetic resonance elastography with Dense U-net segmentation.', 'Real-time multimodal image registration with partial intraoperative point-set data.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.']"""

It incorporates a novel tumor candidate identification algorithm to efficiently and thoroughly identify the regions of concern and constructs a comprehensive radiomics feature model to detect tumorous regions. In contrast to conventional automated classification schemes, this radiomics-based feature model aims to ground its decisions in a way that can be interpreted and understood by the diagnostician. This is done by grouping features into high-level feature categories which are already used by radiologists to diagnose prostate cancer: Morphology, Asymmetry, Physiology, and Size (MAPS), using biomarkers inspired by the PI-RADS guidelines for performing structured reporting on prostate MRI. Clinical mpMRI data were collected from 13 men with histology-confirmed prostate cancer and labeled by an experienced radiologist. These annotated data were used to train classifiers using the proposed radiomics-driven feature model in order to evaluate the classification performance. The preliminary experimental results indicated that the proposed model outperformed each of its constituent feature groups as well as a comparable conventional mpMRI feature model.

We found that the prevalence of HPV infection was 18.93% (95% CI = 17.84-20.05%) in prostate cancer cases, and most of which were high-risk HPV types (17.73%, 95% CI = 16.52-18.99%). The prevalence varied by region, PCR primers used, publication calendar period and Gleason score. Our study also showed a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer with the positivity of overall HPV detected in prostate tissues (OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.29-2.49) and revealed the geographic variation of association strength (P < 0.001).

We have shown that inhibition of GSK-3β activity triggered a profound autophagic response and subsequent necrotic cell death after serum deprivation in prostate cancer cells. In this study, we dissected the mechanisms involved in GSK-3β inhibition-triggered autophagy.  Methods:   Prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells were used in the study. Multiple GSK-3β specific inhibitors were used including small chemicals TDZD8, Tideglusib, TWS119, and peptide L803-mts. Western blot assay coupled with phospho-specific antibodies were used in detecting signal pathway activation. ATP levels were assessed with ATPLite kit and HPLC methods. Autophagy response was determined by evaluating Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B) processing and p62 protein stability in Western blot assays. Immunofluorescent microscopy was used to detect LKB1 translocation.  Results:   Inhibition of GSK-3β activity resulted in a significant decline of cellular ATP production, leading to a significant increase of AMP/ATP ratio, a strong trigger of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. In parallel with increased LC-3B biosynthesis and p62 protein reduction, the classical sign of autophagy induction, AMPK was activated after inhibition of GSK-3β activity. Further analysis revealed that Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) but not Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) is involved in AMPK activation and autophagy induction triggered by GSK-3β inhibition. Meanwhile, GSK-3β inhibition promoted LKB1 translocation from nuclear to cytoplasmic compartment and enhanced LKB1 interaction with its regulatory partners Mouse protein-25 (MO25) and STE20-related adaptor (STRAD).

Moreover, little is known about the optimal type of social support, or its mechanism effect between coping and emotional outcome in men affected by this disease to identify areas for clinical intervention. This study aimed to empirically test the propositions of social support theory in ""real time"" within individual men living with and beyond prostate cancer.  Methods:   Purposeful sub-sample from a larger prospective longitudinal study of prostate cancer survivors, took part in real time data collection using mobile technology.

Electronic data were analysed using time series analysis.  Results:   Majority of response rates were >90%. Men reported a lack of satisfaction with their support over time. Testing the propositions of social support theory ""within individuals"" over time demonstrated different results for main effect, moderation and mediation pathways that linked coping and social support to emotional outcome.

IL-20 is associated with tumor promotion in the pathogenesis of oral, bladder, and breast cancer. However, little is known about the role of IL-20 in prostate cancer. We hypothesize that IL-20 promotes the growth of prostate cancer cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed that IL-20 and its receptors were expressed in human PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines and in prostate tumor tissue from 40 patients. In vitro, IL-20 upregulated N-cadherin, STAT3, vimentin, fibronectin, RANKL, cathepsin G, and cathepsin K, and increased the migration and colony formation of prostate cancer cells via activated p38, ERK1/2, AKT, and NF-κB signals in PC-3 cells. We investigated the effects of anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody 7E on prostate tumor growth in vivo using SCID mouse subcutaneous and intratibial xenograft tumor models. In vivo, 7E reduced tumor growth, suppressed tumor-mediated osteolysis, and protected bone mineral density after intratibial injection of prostate cancer cells. We conclude that IL-20 is involved in the cell migration, colony formation, and tumor-induced osteolysis of prostate cancer. Therefore, IL-20 might be a novel target for treating prostate cancer.""","""['Yu-Hsiang Hsu', 'Cheng-Ying Wu', 'Chung-Hsi Hsing', 'Wei-Ting Lai', 'Li-Wha Wu', 'Ming-Shi Chang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody suppresses breast cancer progression and bone osteolysis in murine models.', 'Anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody alleviates inflammation in oral cancer and suppresses tumor growth.', 'RANKL acts directly on RANK-expressing prostate tumor cells and mediates migration and expression of tumor metastasis genes.', 'The therapeutic potential of anti-interleukin-20 monoclonal antibody.', 'Interleukin-6 regulation of prostate cancer cell growth.', 'IL-20RB mediates tumoral response to osteoclastic niches and promotes bone metastasis of lung cancer.', 'IL-20 Cytokines Are Involved in Epithelial Lesions Associated with Virus-Induced COPD Exacerbation in Mice.', 'Expression of IL-20 Receptor Subunit β Is Linked to EAE Neuropathology and CNS Neuroinflammation.', 'AKT in Bone Metastasis of Solid Tumors: A Comprehensive Review.', 'IL-20R Activation via rIL-19 Enhances Hematoma Resolution through the IL-20R1/ERK/Nrf2 Pathway in an Experimental GMH Rat Pup Model.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 2,880 patients with a complete data set and a mean follow-up of 10.3 years were studied; 425 of them (15%) had a history of hormonal treatment prior to surgery. The cumulative incidence of deaths from prostate cancer was determined by univariate and multivariate competing risk analysis. Cox proportional hazard models for competing risks were used to study combined effects of the variables on prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   A higher portion of specimens with a history of neoadjuvant hormonal treatment were assigned Gleason scores of 8-10 (28 vs. 17%, p < 0.0001). The mortality curves in the Gleason score strata <8 vs. 8-10 were at large congruent in patients with and without neoadjuvant hormonal treatment. In patients with neoadjuvant hormonal treatment, a Gleason score of 8-10 was an independent predictor of prostate cancer-specific mortality; the hazard ratio was, however, somewhat lower than in patients without neoadjuvant hormonal treatment.

We have previously observed a U-shaped association between IGF-I and cancer mortality. This study test the hypotheses of a U-shaped association between IGF-I and incident cancer.  Design:   Elderly men (2368), randomly recruited from the general community.  Methods:   IGF-I was measured in a cohort of elderly men. Complete data for incident cancer were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Statistical analyses included Cox proportional hazards regressions with or without a spline approach.  Results:   Three hundred and sixty-nine participants had incident cancer after baseline. Prostate cancer was most frequent (n = 140). There was no association between serum IGF-I and all cancer or prostate cancer incidence. However, there was a nonlinear association between IGF-I and nonprostate cancer incidence (P = <0·05). Exploratory analyses were performed for low and high serum IGF-I (quintiles 1 and 5) vs intermediate (quintiles 2-4, referent). There was a tendency of increased nonprostate cancer risk in men with high IGF-I (HR = 1·26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0·92-1·71, P = 0·15). After excluding participants with follow-up of less than 2·6 years (half median follow-up time), to control for potential diagnostic delay, the association was statistically significant (HR = 1·55, CI: 1·03-2·35).  Conclusion:   There was a significant nonlinear association between IGF-I and nonprostate cancer. No association between IGF-I and prostate cancer was observed.

In this study, we found that miR-212 is downregulated in PCa tissues when compared with benign adjacent regions (n = 40). Also, we observed reduced levels of circulatory miR-212 in serum from PCa patients (n = 40) when compared with healthy controls (n = 32). Elucidating the functional role of miR-212, we demonstrate that miR-212 negatively modulates starvation induced autophagy in PCa cells by targeting sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Overexpression of miR-212 also leads to inhibition of angiogenesis and cellular senescence.

Recently, regression forest was adopted for organ deformable segmentation on 2D medical images by training one landmark detector for each point on the shape model. However, it seems impractical for regression forest to guide 3D deformable segmentation as a landmark detector, due to large number of vertices in the 3D shape model as well as the difficulty in building accurate 3D vertex correspondence for each landmark detector. In this paper, we propose a novel boundary detection method by exploiting the power of regression forest for prostate and rectum segmentation. The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) we introduce regression forest as a local boundary regressor to vote the entire boundary of a target organ, which avoids training a large number of landmark detectors and building an accurate 3D vertex correspondence for each landmark detector; (2) an auto-context model is integrated with regression forest to improve the accuracy of the boundary regression; (3) we further combine a deformable segmentation method with the proposed local boundary regressor for the final organ segmentation by integrating organ shape priors. Our method is evaluated on a planning CT image dataset with 70 images from 70 different patients. The experimental results show that our proposed boundary regression method outperforms the conventional boundary classification method in guiding the deformable model for prostate and rectum segmentations. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, our method also shows a competitive performance.""","""['Yeqin Shao', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Qian Wang', 'Xin Yang', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['A 3D global-to-local deformable mesh model based registration and anatomy-constrained segmentation method for image guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Accurate Segmentation of CT Male Pelvic Organs via Regression-Based Deformable Models and Multi-Task Random Forests.', 'Online updating of context-aware landmark detectors for prostate localization in daily treatment CT images.', 'Automatic delineation of the diaphragm in computed tomographic images.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Automatic multi-organ segmentation in computed tomography images using hierarchical convolutional neural network.', 'CNN-based hierarchical coarse-to-fine segmentation of pelvic CT images for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Iterative Label Denoising Network: Segmenting Male Pelvic Organs in CT From 3D Bounding Box Annotations.', 'CT Male Pelvic Organ Segmentation via Hybrid Loss Network With Incomplete Annotation.', 'Deep learning-based three-dimensional segmentation of the prostate on computed tomography images.']"""

Seeds can migrate and edema of the prostate affects the position of seeds. Seed movements directly influence dosimetry which relates to treatment quality. We present a method that tracks all individual seeds over time allowing quantification of seed movements. This linking procedure was tested on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) datasets of 699 patients. These datasets were acquired intraoperatively during a dynamic implantation procedure, that combines both imaging modalities. The procedure was subdivided in four automatic linking steps. (I) The Hungarian Algorithm was applied to initially link seeds in CBCT and the corresponding TRUS datasets. (II) Strands were identified and optimized based on curvature and linefits: non optimal links were removed. (III) The positions of unlinked seeds were reviewed and were linked to incomplete strands if within curvature- and distance-thresholds. (IV) Finally, seeds close to strands were linked, also if the curvature-threshold was violated. After linking the seeds an affine transformation was applied. The procedure was repeated until the results were stable or the 6th iteration ended. All results were visually reviewed for mismatches and uncertainties. Eleven implants showed a mismatch and in 12 cases an uncertainty was identified. On average the linking procedure took 42 ms per case. This accurate and fast method has the potential to be used for other time spans, like Day 30, and other imaging modalities. It can potentially be used during a dynamic implantation procedure to faster and better evaluate the quality of the permanent prostate implant.""","""['Hendrik Westendorp', 'Tonnis T Nuver', 'Marinus A Moerland', 'André W Minken']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Edema and Seed Displacements Affect Intraoperative Permanent Prostate Brachytherapy Dosimetry.', 'Impact of transrectal ultrasound- and computed tomography-based seed localization on postimplant dosimetry in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Intraoperative adaptive brachytherapy of iodine-125 prostate implants guided by C-arm cone-beam computed tomography-based dosimetry.', 'Impact of selection of post-implant technique on dosimetry parameters for permanent prostate implants.', 'Localization of linked 125I seeds in postimplant TRUS images for prostate brachytherapy dosimetry.']"""

Methods:   Between March 2007 and September 2013, we prospectively analysed 937 patients who were referred to our centre for RP. Clinical, pathological and biological data have been prospectively collected. Preoperative total testosterone (TT) and bioavailable testosterone (BT) serum determinations were carried out. The threshold for low serum testosterone was set at TT<3 ng/ml. Preoperative PSA value was registered. Gleason score (GS) and predominant Gleason pattern were determined in prostate biopsies and in prostate tissue specimens, crosschecked by two uro-pathologists.  Results:   Nine hundred and thirty-seven consecutive patients were included. In all, 14.9% patients had low TT in the population. An exact match between biopsy and prostate specimens in GS grading was observed for 50.6% patients (n=474). Also, 40.9% of all patients were upgraded (n=383): 45.3% (n=63) in low serum testosterone patients and 40.1% (n=320) in normal serum testosterone patients. For prostate specimens, the proportion of patients with predominant Gleason pattern 4 was higher in patients with low TT compared with normal TT (41.7% vs 29.1%, P=0.0029). In all, 20.1% were upgraded from predominant Gleason pattern 3 on biopsies specimen to predominant Gleason 4 pattern on the prostate specimen in patients with low TT, whereas 11.6% were upgraded for normal TT patients (P=0.002).  Conclusions:   Low serum testosterone is an independent risk factor for predominant Gleason pattern 4 on prostate specimen after RP and for upgrading from low- to high-grade cancer between prostate needle biopsies and RP specimen.

Methods:   From 2010 onwards, consecutive patients undergoing 12-core prostate biopsy were enrolled. Body mass index was measured before the biopsy. Blood samples were collected and tested for: PSA, fasting glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoproteins. Blood pressure was also recorded.

Here, we examined the anti-cancer effect of Exendin-4 and metformin using a prostate cancer model.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cells were treated with Exendin-4 and/or metformin. Cell proliferation was quantified by growth curves and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assay. TUNEL assay and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation were examined in LNCaP cells. For in vivo experiments, LNCaP cells were transplanted subcutaneously into the flank region of athymic mice, which were then treated with Exendin-4 and/or metformin. TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry were performed on tumors.  Results:   Exendin-4 and metformin additively decreased the growth curve, but not the migration, of prostate cancer cells. The BrdU assay revealed that both Exendin-4 and metformin significantly decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, metformin, but not Exendin-4, activated AMPK and induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. The anti-proliferative effect of metformin was abolished by inhibition or knock down of AMPK. In vivo, Exendin-4 and metformin significantly decreased tumor size, and further significant tumor size reduction was observed after combined treatment. Immunohistochemistry on tumors revealed that the P504S and Ki67 expression decreased by Exendin-4 and/or metformin, and that metformin increased phospho-AMPK expression and the apoptotic cell number.

In this work, by integrating two independent signal amplification approaches, hybridization chain reaction and catalytic hairpin assembly, we report an enzyme-free and dual amplified approach for highly sensitive detection of a human prostate cancer biomarker, miR-141. The presence of miR-141 triggers the self-assembly of two hairpin DNAs into dsDNA polymers, which co-localize two split segments of ssDNA into proximity. Subsequently, these co-localized ssDNA sequences further act as triggers to initiate catalytic assembly of two fluorescently quenched hairpin DNAs to form numerous dsDNA strands, resulting in the recovery of the fluorescent emissions and remarkably amplified signals for highly sensitive detection of miR-141 down to 0.3 fM. In addition, this method is also selective for the target miRNA against other control sequences.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy holds promise for repairing tissue damage due to RP. Because animal studies accurately replicating post-RP clinical UI and ED are lacking, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the urological benefits of MSC in this setting. To determine whether and by which mechanisms MSC can repair damages to both striated urethral sphincter (SUS) and penis in the same animal, we delivered human multipotent adipose stem cells, used as MSC model, in an immunocompetent rat model replicating post-RP UI and ED. In this model, we demonstrated by using noninvasive methods in the same animal from day 7 to day 90 post-RP injury that MSC administration into both the SUS and the penis significantly improved urinary continence and erectile function. The regenerative effects of MSC therapy were not due to transdifferentiation and robust engraftment at injection sites. Rather, our results suggest that MSC benefits in both target organs may involve a paracrine process with not only soluble factor release by the MSC but also activation of the recipient's secretome. These two effects of MSC varied across target tissues and damaged-cell types. In conclusion, our work provides new insights into the regenerative properties of MSC and supports the ability of MSC from a single source to repair multiple types of damage, such as those seen after RP, in the same individual.""","""['René Yiou', 'Meriem Mahrouf-Yorgov', 'Céline Trébeau', 'Marc Zanaty', 'Cécile Lecointe', 'Richard Souktani', 'Patricia Zadigue', 'Florence Figeac', 'Anne-Marie Rodriguez']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Stem Cells""","""['Safety and Potential Effect of a Single Intracavernous Injection of Autologous Adipose-Derived Regenerative Cells in Patients with Erectile Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy: An Open-Label Phase I Clinical Trial.', 'Multipotent stromal cell therapy for cavernous nerve injury-induced erectile dysfunction.', 'Stem cell therapies in post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction: a critical review.', 'Monitoring of erectile and urethral sphincter dysfunctions in a rat model mimicking radical prostatectomy damage.', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'Platelet-rich plasma: a comparative and economical therapy for wound healing and tissue regeneration.', 'Replacing Needle Injection by a Novel Waterjet Technology Grants Improved Muscle Cell Delivery in Target Tissues.', 'Role of regenerative therapies on erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy.', 'In vitro study on promoting migration ability of rat adipose derived stem cells modified by stromal cell-derived factor 1α.', 'Development of Male External Urethral Sphincter and Tissue-Resident Stem/Progenitor Cells in Rats.']"""

However, whether targeting the β-catenin pathway will prove effective as a CRPC treatment remains unknown. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a critical regulator in many cell cycle events, and its level is significantly elevated upon castration of mice carrying xenograft prostate tumors. Indeed, inhibition of Plk1 has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in several in vivo studies. Here, we show that Plk1 is a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Plk1 inhibition or depletion enhances the level of cytosolic and nuclear β-catenin in human prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling significantly potentiates the antineoplastic activity of the Plk1 inhibitor BI2536 in both cultured prostate cancer cells and CRPC xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, axin2, a negative regulator of the β-catenin pathway, serves as a substrate of Plk1, and Plk1 phosphorylation of axin2 facilitates the degradation of β-catenin by enhancing binding between glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and β-catenin. Plk1-phosphorylated axin2 also exhibits resistance to Cdc20-mediated degradation. Overall, this study identifies a novel Plk1-Wnt signaling axis in prostate cancer, offering a promising new therapeutic option to treat CRPC.""","""['Jie Li', 'Anju Karki', 'Kurt B Hodges', 'Nihal Ahmad', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Klaus Strebhardt', 'Timothy L Ratliff', 'Stephen F Konieczny', 'Xiaoqi Liu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['Inhibition of Plk1 represses androgen signaling pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Plk1 Inhibition Enhances the Efficacy of BET Epigenetic Reader Blockade in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting Plk1 to Enhance Efficacy of Olaparib in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cross Talk between Wnt/β-Catenin and CIP2A/Plk1 Signaling in Prostate Cancer: Promising Therapeutic Implications.', 'Dysregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by protein kinases in hepatocellular carcinoma and its therapeutic application.', 'CDC20 Is Regulated by the Histone Methyltransferase, KMT5A, in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'From Basic Science to Clinical Practice: The Role of Cancerous Inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase 2A (CIP2A)/p90 in Cancer.', 'Wnt16 signaling in bone homeostasis and osteoarthristis.', 'CDC20 is a novel biomarker for improved clinical predictions in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

With Japan's rapidly society aging, both the prevalence and mortality of prostate cancer are expected to increase in the future. The objective of this study was to estimate and predict the cost of illness (COI) associated with prostate cancer in Japan.  Methods:   Using a COI method based on available data from government office statistics, we estimated the COI for 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2011. We then predicted the COI for 2014, 2017, and 2020 using fixed model estimation and variable model estimation. With fixed model estimation, only estimated future population was used as a variable. Variable model estimation considered the time trend of health-related indicators in the past 15 years. We derived the COI from the sum of direct and indirect costs (morbidity and mortality).  Results:   We found the predicted future COI of prostate cancer to be 354.7-378.3 billion yen in 2014, 370.8-421.0 billion yen in 2017, and 385.3-474.1 billion yen in 2020. Regardless of the estimation model, we found that COI would increase compared with the baseline year 2011 (307.3 billion yen). The direct costs for inpatient and outpatient treatment, laboratory tests, and drugs accounted for 60-75% of the COI of prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   The results of this study suggest that the COI of prostate cancer in Japan has steadily increased and is expected to rise in the future. Direct costs comprised the largest proportion of the COI and are anticipated to continue expanding; this will result in increased burden on public funds in Japan, where a universal public insurance system operates.

We have previously developed a radiation-sensitizing RNA aptamer-shRNA chimera that selectively delivers DNA-PK targeting shRNAs to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive cells in the absence of transfection reagents. Although these chimera are effective, their synthesis requires in vitro transcription and their evaluation was limited to intratumoral administration. Here, we have developed a second-generation aptamer-siRNA chimera that can be assembled through the annealing of three separate chemically synthesized components. The resulting chimera knocked down DNA-PK in PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells, without the need of additional transfection reagents, and enhanced the efficacy of radiation-mediated cell death. Following intravenous injection, the chimera effectively knocked down DNA-PK in established subcutaneous PSMA-positive tumors.

The present controlled study examined effect of PN on satisfaction with cancer-related care.  Methods:   Patients who presented with a symptom or abnormal screening test (n = 1788) or definitive diagnosis (n = 445) of breast, cervical, colorectal, or prostate cancer from eight Patient Navigator Research Program sites were included in one of two groups: intervention (PN) or comparison (usual care or usual care plus cancer educational materials). Trained patient navigators met with intervention group participants to help them assess and identify resources to address barriers to cancer diagnostic or treatment care. Using a validated instrument, we assessed participants' satisfaction with their cancer diagnostic or treatment care up to 3 months after diagnostic resolution of a cancer-related abnormality or within 3 months of initiation of cancer treatment.  Results:   Overall, patients reported high satisfaction with diagnostic care and cancer treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between PN and control groups in satisfaction with cancer-related care (p > 0.05). Hispanic and African American participants were less likely to report high satisfaction with cancer care when compared to White patients. Middle-aged participants with higher education, higher household income, private insurance, owning their own home, working full-time, and those whose primary language is English had higher satisfaction with cancer-related diagnostic care.  Conclusions:   PN had no statistically significant effect on patients' satisfaction with cancer-related care. Further research is needed to define the patient populations who might benefit from PN, content of PN that is most useful, and services that might enhance PN.

Both Notch and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are believed to be involved in prostate cancer. How the interaction between the two pathways contributes to prostate cancer progression to androgen independence is still elusive.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cells were grown in RPMI 1,640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 10% charcoal-stripped heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FCS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin in 75 cm2 polystyrene flasks, and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 . Cell proliferation, invasion were performed with cell counting, matrigel assay in vitro. Dual luciferase assays were performed using reporter plasmids with ARE (Androgen Response Element, ARE). RNA interference was applied to gene silence. Tumorigenicity of cancer cells was evaluated by mouse xenograft in vivo.  Results:   A subpopulation of casodex resistant prostate cancer cells were identified with an overexpressed androgen receptor (AR) and aggressive phenotypes, characterized with high proliferation, invasion in vitro and enhanced tumorigenesis in vivo. Gene profiling for androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent LNCaP-CR revealed that both CSL and AKT gave the similar expressional pattern upon casodex treatment. Immunoblot demonstrated that CSL and AKT were dramatically suppressed in androgen dependent LNCaP cells, but slightly inhibited in LNCaP-CR cells as well as other androgen independent prostate cancer cells. Further studies indicated that CSL regulates AKT, and subsequently AR in prostate cancer cells. AKT mediates casodex resistance and androgen independence through regulation of cyclin D1.  Conclusion:   CSL-AKT-AR axis might play an important role in prostate cancer progression.

Thus, the high risk of cancers of the esophagus and cervix uteri in blacks (relative to whites) and colorectal cancers in whites show little change over time.

Demographic data were used to establish each year's population and the data corresponding to the prevalence of prostate cancer patients, performing a descriptive study. Thus, the use of PSA in patients with or without prostate cancer was studied.  Results:   25.700 PSA petitions are issued annually in our department over a total of 67.000 males older than 45. This entails a cost of 332.815 Euros annually. Within the group of patients with no prostate cancer diagnosis, it was noticed that the percentage of individuals with at least one annual PSA petition per decade of age is of 23% in males in their fifties, 40% in their sixties, 46% in their seventies, and 36% in their eighties or successive decades. Furthermore, in these cancer-free patients, around 3.800 annual petitions fall on individuals over 75 and with PSA under 4 ng/ml, from which 20% are repeated petitions over the same individual in the same year. Over 1100 males under 45 have an annual PSA. Regarding the average PSA value for decade of age in cancer-free patients, it is of 0.89 +/- 0.4 ng/ml in the forties decade, 1.26 +/- 1.07 ng/ml in the fifties, 1.67 +/- 1.38 ng/ml in the sixties, 1.96 +/- 1.78 ng/ml in the seventies, and 2.24 +/- 2.16 ng/ml in the eighties.

Methods:   The study included 129 patients treated with iodine-125 seeds Brachytherapy, 98 patients treated with Laparoscopic RP (LRP), and 61 patients treated with Robotic RP (RRP) at our institution between December 1999 and January 2010, who had a low-risk disease according to D'Amico criteria (PSA <10 ng/mL, Gleason < or = 6, cT1c-T2a), or an intermediate-risk disease (PSA = or >10 and < 20 ng/mL, Gleason = 7, cT2b), but with a tumor burden of up to 30%. Follow-up was conducted with PSA at 1, 3, and 6 months, and then every six months. As for Brachytherapy, annual digital rectal examinations were also performed. A PSA level increase of 2 ng/mL above the nadir in Brachytherapy (confirmed in 2 cases) and a PSA value greater than 0.2 ng/mL after RP were considered BCR.  Results:   Overall mean follow-up was 60.5 months (R:1-152), with a mean time for BCR of 51.7 months (R:1-138). Estimated 5-year Biochemical Recurrence-free Survival (BCRFS) in patients with D'Amico low-risk was 85.7%, 77.2% and 90.7% (p 0.336), while for intermediate-risk it was 75.8%, 68.1% and 65.1% (p 0.114), for Brachytherapy, LRP and RRP respectively. In the univariate analysis, the Gleason score 7, a clinical stage T2b, and a D'Amico intermediate-risk were associated with an increased BCR risk, and treatment with Brachytherapy was associated with a decreased BCR risk, all these being statistically significant. In the multivariate analysis, only the Gleason score 7 was significant; treatment with LRP, RRP or Brachytherapy was not associated with a greater BCR risk.

Patients & methods:   All mCRPC patients planned for DCT chemotherapy rechallenge in our institutions were evaluated.  Results:   Of 128 patients, 98 achieved disease control on the initial DCT round. After a treatment holiday of 8.3 months, the 98 responsive patients underwent a second DCT round, with 56 cases achieving again disease control.

Lastly, after a further 4.2-month treatment holiday, eight patients underwent a fourth DCT round and two responded. Median time to definitive disease progression for the whole population was 16.4 months.  Conclusions:   Rechallenge with DCT may be considered a suitable treatment option for mCRPC patients recurring after a successful DCT chemotherapy.

Aim:   To explore patient experiences up to and following a raised PSA test.  Methods:   Thirty-one general practices within the Midland region were recruited. Community laboratory databases were used to identify all men with a first raised PSA test during 2010. Questionnaires were sent to these men.  Results:   One hundred and ninety-four (63%) eligible responses were received from 307 eligible men delivered questionnaires. For 54% of men this was their first PSA test. Most men (66%) identified that their PSA test was initiated by their GP. Forty-three percent of men identified having symptoms at the time of their first raised PSA test. A digital rectal examination (DRE) was performed on 73% of men at the time of the test. Fifty-eight percent of men were referred to see a specialist. Maori men were less likely to be referred after a raised PSA. Of all men referred, 61% received a biopsy.  Discussion:   PSA testing is predominantly initiated by GPs.

Such infections are largely attributable to quinolone resistant microorganisms which colonize the rectal vault and are translocated into the bloodstream during the biopsy procedure. A povidone iodine rectal preparation (PIRP) at time of biopsy is a simple, reproducible method to reduce rectal microorganism colony counts and therefore resultant infections following TRUS PNB. All patients are administered three days of oral antibiotic therapy prior to biopsy. The PIRP technique involves initially positioning the patient in the standard manner for a TRUS PNB. Following digital rectal examination, 15 ml of a 10% solution of commercially available povidone iodine is mixed with 5 ml of 1% lidocaine jelly to create slurry. A 4 cmx4 cm sterile gauze is soaked in this slurry and then inserted into the rectal vault for 2 min after which it is removed. Thereafter, a disposable cotton gynecologic swab is used to paint both the perianal area and the rectal vault to a distance of 3 cm from the anus. The povidone iodine solution is then allowed to dry for 2-3 min prior to proceeding with standard transrectal ultrasonography and subsequent biopsy. This PIRP technique has been in practice at our institution since March of 2012 with an associated reduction of post-biopsy infections from 4.3% to 0.6% (p=0.02). The principal advantage of this prophylaxis regimen is its simplicity and reproducibility with use of an easily available, inexpensive agent to reduce infections. Furthermore, the technique avoids exposing patients to additional systemic antibiotics with potential further propagation of multi-drug resistant organisms. Usage of PIRP at TRUS PNB, however, is not applicable for patients with iodine or shellfish allergies.""","""['Jay D Raman', 'Kathleen K Lehman', 'Kalyan Dewan', 'Girish Kirimanjeswara']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Procedural povidone iodine rectal preparation reduces bacteriuria and bacteremia following prostate needle biopsy.', 'Peri-procedural povidone-iodine rectal preparation reduces microorganism counts and infectious complications following ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the prostate.', 'Risk factors for and prophylactic effect of povidone-iodine rectal cleansing on infectious complications after prostate biopsy: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Update on Strategies to Reduce Infectious Complications After Prostate Biopsy.', 'Update on techniques to prevent infections associated with prostate needle biopsy.', 'Prostate biopsy-infection prophylaxis and patient preparation.', 'Topical antiseptic at time of transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsy is associated with fewer severe clinical infections and improves antibiotic stewardship.', 'Topical rectal antiseptic at time of prostate biopsy: how a resident patient safety project has evolved into institutional practice.']"""

LSD1 interacted with androgen receptor (AR) and promoted androgen-dependent transcription of target genes, such as PSA, by ligand-induced demethylation of mono- and dimethylated histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9). Meanwhile, the phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) had received considerable attention in tumor recurrence and metastasis. This study examined the effect of Pargyline (an inhibitor of LSD1) on the process of EMT in vitro and in vivo. SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with LNCap cells. Pargyline was given intraperitoneally or not after castration (implemented with Bilateral orchidectomy), then PSA levels in serum and tumor were determined to assess time to androgen-independent progression. The results showed that LSD1 expression was up-regulated when PCa progressed to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). Pargyline reduced LNCap cells migration and invasion ability, and inhibited the process of EMT by up-regulating expression of E-cadherin, and down-regulating expressions of N-cadherin and Vimentin in vitro and in vivo. Although, Pargyline did not change the level of AR, it reduced PSA expression both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Pargyline delayed prostate cancer transition from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent state (CRPC).

Thus, assessing patient treatment preferences is critical for developing an effective decision support system.

We analysed the presence of HER-2 expression in primary tumors in men undergoing radical prostatectomy, its association with clinical and pathological findings, and its expression in secondary circulating prostate cells (CPCs) during follow up, as well as links with biochemical failure and the effects of androgen blockade.  Materials and methods:   Consecutive men undergoing radical prostatectomy for histologically confirmed prostate cancer were analyzed. HER-2 expression in the primary tumor was assessed using the HercepTest®, CPCs were identified from blood samples using standard immunocytochemistry with anti-PSA and positive samples with the HercepTest® to determine HER-2 expression. The influence of HER-2 expression on the frequency of biochemical failure and effects of androgen blockade was determined.  Results:   144 men with a mean age of 64.8±10.3 years participated, with a median follow up of 8.2 years. HER-2 was expressed in 20.8% of primary tumors; it was associated with vascular infiltration and older age, but not with other clinical pathological findings. Some 40.3% of men had secondary CPCs detected, of which 38% expressed HER-2. Men CPC (+) had a higher frequency of biochemical failure, but there was no difference in HER-2 expression of CPCs with the frequency of biochemical failure. After androgen blockade, men with HER-2 (+) positive secondary CPCs had a higher frequency of disease progression to castrate resistant disease.  Conclusions:   HER-2 plays a dual role in the progression of prostate cancer; firstly it may increase the potential of tumor cells to disseminate from the primary tumor via the blood by increasing vascular infiltration. In the presence of androgens, there is no survival advantage of expressing HER-2, but once biochemical failure has occurred and androgen blockade started, HER-2 positive cells are resistant to treatment, survive and grow leading to castration resistant disease.""","""['Nigel P Murray', 'Eduardo Reyes', 'Cynthia Fuentealba', 'Omar Jacob', 'Nelson Orellana']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Elimination of primary circulating prostate cells after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer decreases the risk of future biochemical failure.', 'Comparison of the Walz Nomogram and Presence of Secondary Circulating Prostate Cells for Predicting Early Biochemical Failure after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer in Chilean Men.', 'Limited improvement of incorporating primary circulating prostate cells with the CAPRA score to predict biochemical failure-free outcome of radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Qualitative and quantitative hormonal regulation in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Current state of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Her2 Expression in Circulating Tumor Cells Is Associated with Poor Outcomes in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Expression of ERBB Family Members as Predictive Markers of Prostate Cancer Progression and Mortality.', 'C-erbB-2 expression is related with pathological progression of gastric cancer: results of a non-radioactive in situ hybridization.', 'Systems Oncology: Bridging Pancreatic and Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Minimal residual disease in prostate cancer patients after primary treatment: theoretical considerations, evidence and possible use in clinical management.']"""

Materials and methods:   Data of a total of 873 patients who consulted Urology Outpatient Clinics of Fatih Sultan Mehmet Training and Research Hospital between February 2008 and April 2014 scheduled for prostate biopsy were screened retrospectively. PSA levels, prostate volumes, prebiopsy whole blood cell counts, neutrophil and platelet counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), biopsy results and Gleason scores in patients who had established diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) were evaluated.  Results:   This study was performed on a total of 873 cases, with an age range 48-76 years, divided into three groups as for biopsy results. with diagnoses of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (n=304, 34.8 %), PCa (n=265, 30.4%) and histological prostatitis (n=304; 34.8%). Intra- and intergroup comparative evaluations were performed. White blood cell and neutrophil counts in the histological prostatitis group were significantly higher than those of the BPH and PCa groups (p=0.001; p=0.004; p<0.01). A statistically significant intergroup difference was found for PLR (p=0.041; p<0.05) but not lymphocyte count (p>0.05). According to pairwise comparisons, PLR were significantly higher in the PCa group relative to BPH group (p=0.018, p<0.05, respectively). Though not statistically significant, higher PLR in cases with PCa in comparison with the prostatitis group was remarkable (p=0.067, and p>0.05, respectively).  Conclusions:   Meta-analyses showed that in patients with PSA levels over 4 ng/ml, positive predictive value of PSA is only 25 percent. Therefore, novel markers which can both detect clinically significant prostate cancer, and also prevent unnecessary biopsies are needed.

DNA damage repair mechanisms have been implicated in human cancer. Accumulating evidence indicates that the fidelity of the response to DNA double-strand breaks is critical for maintaining genome integrity. RAD51 is a central player in double-strand break repair via homologous recombination, and its alterations may confer and increase the risk of cancer. RAD51 functioning depends on the indirect or direct interactions with BRCA1 and BRCA2. To evaluate the contribution of RAD51 to sporadic prostate cancer, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosomal region 15q14-21.1 (RAD51 locus) was determined and compared to LOH in 17q21.31 (BRCA1 locus) and 13q12.3-13.1 (BRCA2 region). DNA was isolated from prostate biopsies and matched peripheral blood of 50 patients. The regions 15q14-21.1, 17q21.31, and 13q12.3-13.1 were examined using microsatellite markers on chromosome 15 (D15S118, D15S214, D15S1006), chromosome 17 (D17S855, D17S1323), and chromosome 13 (D13S260, D13S290), respectively. The LOH in tumors was analyzed by PCR with fluorescently labeled primers and an ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer. Allele sizing was determined by GeneScan version 3.1.2 and Genotyper version 2.5 software (Applied Biosystems, USA). LOH was identified in 57.5, 23, and 40 % for chromosomal regions 15q14-21.1, 17q21.31, and 13q12.3-13.1, respectively. Twenty-six percent of studied cases manifested LOH for at least one marker in 15q14-21.1 exclusively.

The results of our phase II study suggest that low-dose EMP is a safe treatment option with the same efficacy in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Background:   We evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose estramustine phosphate (EMP) in Japanese patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Patients and methods:   The present study was a single-arm, nonrandomized prospective study in which all patients received EMP orally twice daily for a total dose of 280 mg/day. A total of 31 patients with CRPC were enrolled from December 2009 to December 2012 at 5 institutions in Japan. The primary endpoint was the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, defined as a 50% decline in the serum PSA level, confirmed ≥ 3 weeks later. The secondary endpoints included the objective response rate, interval to PSA progression, PSA response duration, progression-free survival, disease-specific survival, overall survival, safety, and quality-of-life assessment using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate scores.  Results:   Ten patients (32%) had a PSA response, and no patient had an objective response. The treatment was well tolerated, and the most frequent toxicities were grade 1 to 2 nausea/vomiting, anorexia, and gynecomastia.

There are currently no guidelines or consensus on prostate cancer (CaP) screening in these patients. In light of the recent United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, we conducted a survey of transplantation surgeons to gain a better understanding of practice patterns among U.S. centers.  Materials and methods:   A 14-question multiple-choice online survey was e-mailed to 195 U.S. renal transplantation centers. The questionnaire assessed CaP screening and treatment practices. The survey also evaluated characteristics of the respondent's institution. Descriptive statistics were used for each of the responses, and associations were made with program characterization using logistic or linear regression models.  Results:   A total of 90 surgeons responded, representing 65 of 195 programs (33% response rate). Overall, 89% of respondents reported routinely screening for CaP in renal transplantation candidates and 71% had set guidelines for PSA screening. The most common age to start PSA screening was 50 years (51%) and 79% of respondents reported no age limit to stop PSA screening. Definitive treatment of CaP was required before proceeding to transplantation in 45% of respondents. Active surveillance was a viable option in 67% of responders. Most respondents (73%) replied that the waiting time for eligibility after treatment depended on the CaP stage and risk.  Conclusions:   Although most programs have guidelines on PSA screening in renal transplantation candidates, there is still variation nationwide in screening and treatment practices. AS is a viable treatment option in most of the programs. Our results suggest a benefit of a consensus panel to recommend guidelines in this population.""","""['Greg E Gin', 'Jorge F Pereira', 'Alan D Weinberg', 'Reza Mehrazin', 'Susan M Lerner', 'John P Sfakianos', 'Courtney K Phillips']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""[""Urologists' personal feelings on PSA screening and prostate cancer treatment."", 'Evaluation and Active Treatment versus Active Surveillance of Localized Prostate Cancer in Renal Transplant Patients in the Era of Low and Very Low Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'What Have Patients Been Hearing From Providers Since the 2012 USPSTF Recommendation Against Routine Prostate Cancer Screening?', 'Prostate specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: knowledge of, attitudes towards, and utilization among primary care physicians.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in U.S. men ACPM position statement on preventive practice.', 'Treatment patterns and survival of low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer in end-stage kidney disease: A retrospective population cohort study.', 'Delaying Kidney Transplantation in Patients With Prostate Cancer: Is It Warranted?', 'The effect of subsequent immunosuppressant use in organ-transplanted patients on prostate cancer incidence: a retrospective analysis using the Korean National Health Insurance Database.', 'Pretransplant solid organ malignancy and organ transplant candidacy: A consensus expert opinion statement.', 'Management of Active Surveillance-Eligible Prostate Cancer during Pretransplantation Workup of Patients with Kidney Failure: A Simulation Study.']"""

To date, clinical studies targeting this network were disappointing and call for thorough analysis of the IGF network in cancer models. We highlight the oncogenic effects controlled by IGF1R and INSR in prostate cancer cells and show similarities as well as differences after receptor knockdown (KD). In PC3 prostate cancer cells stably transduced with inducible short hairpin RNAs, targeting IGF1R or INSR attenuated cell growth and proliferation ultimately driving cells into apoptosis. IGF1R KD triggered rapid and strong antiproliferative and proapoptotic responses, whereas these effects were less pronounced and delayed after INSR KD. Down-regulation of the antiapoptotic proteins myeloid cell leukemia-1 and survivin was observed in both KDs, whereas IGF1R KD also attenuated expression of prosurvival proteins B cell lymphoma-2 and B cell lymphoma-xL. Receptor KD induced cell death involved autophagy in particular upon IGF1R KD; however, no difference in mitochondrial energy metabolism was observed. In a mouse xenograft model, induction of IGF1R or INSR KD after tumor establishment eradicated most of the tumors. After 20 days of receptor KD, tumor cells were found only in 1/14 IGF1R and 3/14 INSR KD tumor remnants. Collectively, our data underline the oncogenic functions of IGF1R and INSR in prostate cancer namely growth, proliferation, and survival in vitro as well as in vivo and identify myeloid cell leukemia-1 and survivin as important mediators of inhibitory and apoptotic effects.""","""['Philipp Ofer', 'Isabel Heidegger', 'Iris E Eder', 'Bernd Schöpf', 'Hannes Neuwirt', 'Stephan Geley', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Petra Massoner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Oncogenic functions of IGF1R and INSR in prostate cancer include enhanced tumor growth, cell migration and angiogenesis.', 'Systems Analysis of Insulin and IGF1 Receptors Networks in Breast Cancer Cells Identifies Commonalities and Divergences in Expression Patterns.', 'Diverse functions of IGF/insulin signaling in malignant and noncancerous prostate cells: proliferation in cancer cells and differentiation in noncancerous cells.', 'Minireview: nuclear insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors: a novel paradigm in signal transduction.', 'Targeting the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway for cancer therapy.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in colorectal cancer: a review.', 'Inhibition of Janus Kinase 1 synergizes docetaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.', 'Periprostatic adipose tissue promotes prostate cancer resistance to docetaxel by paracrine IGF-1 upregulation of TUBB2B beta-tubulin isoform.', 'Kinome Array Profiling of Patient-Derived Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Identifies Differentially Active Protein Tyrosine Kinases.']"""

The androgen receptor drives prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression to lethal metastatic castration-resistant disease. Here we used RNA-Seq coupled with bioinformatic analyses of androgen-receptor (AR) binding sites and clinical PCa expression array data to identify ST6GalNAc1 as a direct and rapidly activated target gene of the AR in PCa cells. ST6GalNAc1 encodes a sialytransferase that catalyses formation of the cancer-associated sialyl-Tn antigen (sTn), which we find is also induced by androgen exposure. Androgens induce expression of a novel splice variant of the ST6GalNAc1 protein in PCa cells. This splice variant encodes a shorter protein isoform that is still fully functional as a sialyltransferase and able to induce expression of the sTn-antigen. Surprisingly, given its high expression in tumours, stable expression of ST6GalNAc1 in PCa cells reduced formation of stable tumours in mice, reduced cell adhesion and induced a switch towards a more mesenchymal-like cell phenotype in vitro. ST6GalNAc1 has a dynamic expression pattern in clinical datasets, beingsignificantly up-regulated in primary prostate carcinoma but relatively down-regulated in established metastatic tissue. ST6GalNAc1 is frequently upregulated concurrently with another important glycosylation enzyme GCNT1 previously associated with prostate cancer progression and implicated in Sialyl Lewis X antigen synthesis. Together our data establishes an androgen-dependent mechanism for sTn antigen expression in PCa, and are consistent with a general role for the androgen receptor in driving important coordinate changes to the glycoproteome during PCa progression.""","""['Jennifer Munkley', 'Sebastian Oltean', 'Daniel Vodák', 'Brian T Wilson', 'Karen E Livermore', 'Yan Zhou', 'Eleanor Star', 'Vasileios I Floros', 'Bjarne Johannessen', 'Bridget Knight', 'Paul McCullagh', 'John McGrath', 'Malcolm Crundwell', 'Rolf I Skotheim', 'Craig N Robson', 'Hing Y Leung', 'Lorna W Harries', 'Prabhakar Rajan', 'Ian G Mills', 'David J Elliott']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', 'Glycosylation is an Androgen-Regulated Process Essential for Prostate Cancer Cell Viability.', 'Manipulating prohibitin levels provides evidence for an in vivo role in androgen regulation of prostate tumours.', 'Androgen Receptor Regulation of Local Growth Hormone in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Glycosylation is a global target for androgen control in prostate cancer cells.', 'Integrative analysis of the ST6GALNAC family identifies GATA2-upregulated ST6GALNAC5 as an adverse prognostic biomarker promoting prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Role of Truncated O-GalNAc Glycans in Cancer Progression and Metastasis in Endocrine Cancers.', 'Upregulation of GALNT7 in prostate cancer modifies O-glycosylation and promotes tumour growth.', 'Sialyltransferases and Neuraminidases: Potential Targets for Cancer Treatment.', 'A Sweet Warning: Mucin-Type O-Glycans in Cancer.']"""

Prostate cancer therapy is severely hampered by lack of response and development of resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in patients. Therefore, the development and discovery of new drugs have become an urgent clinical need. Interferons (IFNs), a family of pleiotropic cytokines, exert antitumor activities due to their anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory and proapoptotic functions. Here, we report that pretreatment of prostate cancer PC-3 cells with IFNs sensitized these cells to double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)-induced apoptosis. The enhancement effect of IFN treatment was dependent on IFN subtypes, in particular, IFN γ. In comparison with IFN α or β, IFN γ treatment remarkably augmented apoptosis in PC-3 cells induced with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthesized form of dsRNA. We demonstrated that IFN-signaling was necessary for these effects by using mutant cell lines. Transfection of 2-5A, the activator of RNase L, or silencing of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) by siRNA did not have any significant impact on this event, suggesting that neither RNase L nor PKR was involved in poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis in the cells. Further investigation of the apoptotic pathway revealed that Bak, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2family, was synergistically up-regulated by IFN γ and poly I:C, whereas other members of the family were not affected. Knocking down of Bak demonstrated its contribution to poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis in the cells.

However, the high throughput accurate quantification of glycoproteins is technically challenging due to the scarcity of robust assays to detect and quantify glycoproteins. Here we describe the development of multiplexed targeted MS assays to quantify N-linked glycosite-containing peptides in serum using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Each assay was characterized by its performance metrics and criteria established by the National Cancer Institute's Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI CPTAC) to facilitate the widespread adoption of the assays in studies designed to confidently detect changes in the relative abundance of these analytes. An in-house developed software program, MRMPlus, was used to compute assay performance parameters including specificity, precision, and repeatability. We show that 43 selected N-linked glycosite-containing peptides identified in prostate cancer tissue studies carried out in our group were detected in the sera of prostate cancer patients within the quantitative range of the developed PRM assays. A total of 41 of these formerly N-linked glycosite-containing peptides (corresponding to 37 proteins) were reproducibly quantified based on their relative peak area ratios in human serum during PRM assay development, with 4 proteins showing differential significance in serum from nonaggressive (NAG) vs aggressive (AG) prostate cancer patient serum (n = 50, NAG vs AG). The data demonstrate that the assays can be used for the high throughput and reproducible quantification of a panel of formerly N-linked glycosite-containing peptides.

Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in PCa metastasis and hold great promise as therapeutic targets. In this study, we found that miR-573 expression is significantly lower in metastatic tissues than matched primary PCa. Its downregulation is correlated with high Gleason score and cancer-related mortality of PCa patients (P = 0.041, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Through gain- and loss-of function experiments, we demonstrated that miR-573 inhibits PCa cell migration, invasion and TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, miR573 directly targets the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene. Knockdown of FGFR1 phenocopies the effects of miR-573 expression on PCa cell invasion, whereas overexpression of FGFR1 partially attenuates the functions of miR-573. Consequently, miR-573 modulates the activation of FGFR1-downstream signaling in response to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Importantly, we showed that GATA3 directly increases miR-573 expression, and thus down-regulates FGFR1 expression, EMT and invasion of PCa cells in a miR-573-dependent manner, supporting the involvement of GATA3, miR-573 and FGFR1 in controlling the EMT process during PCa metastasis. Altogether, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which miR-573 modulates EMT and metastasis of PCa cells, and suggest miR-573 as a potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target for PCa management.""","""['Lin Wang', 'Guanhua Song', 'Weiwei Tan', 'Mei Qi', 'Lili Zhang', 'Jonathan Chan', 'Jindan Yu', 'Jinxiang Han', 'Bo Han']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'miR-195 Inhibits EMT by Targeting FGF2 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Double-negative feedback loop between ZEB2 and miR-145 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem cell properties in prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Stromal-induced downregulation of miR-1247 promotes prostate cancer malignancy.', 'Feedback Modulation between Human INO80 Chromatin Remodeling Complex and miR-372 in HCT116 Cells.', 'Lipid metabolism-related miRNAs with potential diagnostic roles in prostate cancer.', 'Five EMT-Related Gene Signatures Predict Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patient Outcome.', 'MicroRNA 573 Rescues Endothelial Dysfunction during Dengue Virus Infection under PPARγ Regulation.', 'ATF6α promotes prostate cancer progression by enhancing PLA2G4A-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism and protecting tumor cells against ferroptosis.']"""

Recursive partitioning was used to define a threshold for VEGFR1 clustering that could segregate patients based on time to biochemical recurrence (TTBR). Multivariate analyses were used to determine whether VEGFR1 clustering, age, pathologic T-stage, Gleason score, or baseline PSA could independently predict TTBR. A randomized, phase II clinical trial comparing axitinib for 28 days followed by radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (RP/PLND) to RP/LND alone was then conducted, with the primary endpoint of demonstrating downregulation of VEGFR1-positve cell clustering in benign lymph nodes.

VEGFR1 clustering was an independent predictor of TTBR in a multivariate analysis. Only 11 out of the planned 44 patients were accrued to the phase II trial. While preoperative axitinib was safe and well tolerated, there was no sign of clinical activity or VEGFR1 downregulation.

An inverse correlation between the expression of ERβ and IKKβ/p65 was also observed in the prostates of ERβ knockout (BERKO) mice, Gleason grade 5 prostate tumors and analysis of prostate cancer databases.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1367 patients who underwent RP between November 2003 and April 2012. Patients who underwent a concurrent biopsy/procedure in other organs, had evidence of acute infection, or had systemic inflammatory disease were excluded. We divided the patients by NLR level and analyzed their perioperative outcomes. To determine NLR significance, we performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis of the pathological adverse outcomes and a Cox proportional hazard analysis of the biochemical recurrence (BCR), which was defined as a prostate-specific antigen level ≥0.2 ng/mL on two consecutive tests.  Results:   Among the 1367 patients, 158 (11.6 %) in the high-NLR (≥2.5) group had a higher biopsy Gleason score (p < 0.001), pathological Gleason score (p < 0.001), and pathological stage (p < 0.001) than patients in the low-NLR (<2.5) group (n = 1209, 88.4 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that high NLR was significantly correlated with adverse pathological outcomes of higher pathological stage (HR 1.688; 95 % CI 1.142-2.497; p = 0.009) and extracapsular extension (HR 1.698; 95 % CI 1.146-2.516; p = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly worse BCR-free survival (p < 0.001) in patients with a high NLR. A high NLR was a significant predictor of BCR after RP (HR 1.358; 95 % CI 1.008-1.829; p = 0.044).  Conclusions:   High NLR was significantly related to unfavorable clinicopathological outcomes and worse BCR-free survival.

The objective was: 1) To compare the volumetric IRE ablation zone on grey-scale transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) with histopathology findings; 2) To determine a reliable imaging modality to visualize the IRE ablation effects accurately.  Methods:   A prospective phase I-II study was performed in 16 patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy (RP). IRE of the prostate was performed 4 weeks before RP. Prior to, and 4 weeks after the IRE treatment, imaging was performed by TRUS, CEUS, and mpMRI. 3D-analysis of the ablation volumes on imaging and on H&E-stained whole-mount sections was performed. The volumes were compared and the correlation was calculated.  Results:   Evaluation of the imaging demonstrated that with T2-weighted MRI, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, and CEUS, effects of IRE are visible.

Because PRZ is also able to induce apoptosis in malignant cells, its cytotoxicity is a focus of interest in cancer research. Besides inducing apoptosis, PRZ was shown to serve as a substrate for an amine uptake mechanism originally discovered in neurones called transport-P. In line with our hypothesis that transport-P is an endocytotic mechanism also present in non-neuronal tissue and linked to the cytotoxicity of PRZ, we tested the uptake of QAPB, a fluorescent derivative of PRZ, in cancer cell lines in the presence of inhibitors of transport-P and endocytosis. Early endosomes and lysosomes were visualised by expression of RAB5-RFP and LAMP1-RFP, respectively; growth and viability of cells in the presence of PRZ and uptake inhibitors were also tested. Cancer cells showed co-localisation of QAPB with RAB5 and LAMP1 positive vesicles as well as tubulation of lysosomes. The uptake of QAPB was sensitive to transport-P inhibitors bafilomycin A1 (inhibits v-ATPase) and the antidepressant desipramine. Endocytosis inhibitors pitstop(®) 2 (general inhibitor of endocytosis), dynasore (dynamin inhibitor) and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (cholesterol chelator) inhibited the uptake of QAPB. Bafilomycin A1 and methyl-β-cyclodextrin but not desipramine were able to preserve growth and viability of cells in the presence of PRZ. In summary, we confirmed the hypothesis that the cellular uptake of QAPB/PRZ represents an endocytotic mechanism equivalent to transport-P. Endocytosis of QAPB/PRZ depends on a proton gradient, dynamin and cholesterol, and results in reorganisation of the LAMP1 positive endolysosomal system. Finally, the link seen between the cellular uptake of PRZ and cell death implies a still unknown pro-apoptotic membrane protein with affinity towards PRZ.""","""['Robert Fuchs', 'Anika Stracke', 'Nadine Ebner', 'Christian Wolfgang Zeller', 'Anna Maria Raninger', 'Matthias Schittmayer', 'Tatjana Kueznik', 'Markus Absenger-Novak', 'Ruth Birner-Gruenberger']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Toxicology""","""['Prazosin induced lysosomal tubulation interferes with cytokinesis and the endocytic sorting of the tumour antigen CD98hc.', 'Quantitative imaging in live human cells reveals intracellular alpha(1)-adrenoceptor ligand-binding sites.', 'Pharmacological implications of cellular localization of alpha1-adrenoceptors in native smooth muscle cells.', 'Apoptotic impact of alpha1-blockers on prostate cancer growth: a myth or an inviting reality?', 'Advances in the design and synthesis of prazosin derivatives over the last ten years.', 'Prazosin induced lysosomal tubulation interferes with cytokinesis and the endocytic sorting of the tumour antigen CD98hc.', 'Characterization of the endolysosomal system in human chordoma cell lines: is there a role of lysosomes in chemoresistance of this rare bone tumor?', 'The Role of α1-Adrenoceptor Antagonists in the Treatment of Prostate and Other Cancers.']"""

Methods:   Monoexponential and biexponential repair models have been used for patients with prostate cancer to study the loss of biochemical control at 5 years for several clinically relevant irradiation times. The theoretical predictions were compared with newly reported clinical results from 4607 patients undergoing conventionally fractionated and hypofractionated prostate radiation therapy.  Results:   Time-demanding irradiation techniques appear to lead to biochemical control rates that sometimes are about 10-20 percentage points below predictions that neglect intrafraction repair. This difference appears to be of the same order of magnitude as that predicted by moderately slow to slow repair taking place during the irradiation time. The impact is largest for the patient risk groups receiving doses corresponding to the steepest part of the dose-response curve. By contrast, for treatment techniques requiring irradiation times shorter than about 20 min, the impact of intrafraction repair appears to be much smaller and probably difficult to be observed in the light of other sources of uncertainty in clinical data.  Conclusion:   Neglecting intrafraction repair might overestimate the effectiveness of some treatment schedules and could also influence any subsequent estimations of fractionation sensitivity for prostate tumours.

Objective:   To evaluate the performance of hospitals that treat patients with cancer using Medicare data for outcome ascertainment and risk adjustment and to assess whether hospital rankings based on these measures are altered by the addition of cancer-specific information.  Design, setting, and participants:   Risk-adjusted cumulative mortality rates of patients with cancer were captured in Medicare claims data from 2005 through 2009 nationally and assessed at the hospital level. Similar analyses were conducted using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data for the subset of the United States covered by the SEER program to determine whether the inclusion of cancer-specific information (only available in cancer registries) in risk adjustment altered measured hospital performance. Data were from 729 279 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries treated for cancer in 2006 at hospitals treating 10 or more patients with each of the following cancers, according to Medicare claims: lung, prostate, breast, colon, and other. An additional sample of 18 677 similar patients were included from the SEER-Medicare administrative data.  Main outcomes and measures:   Risk-adjusted mortality overall and by cancer category, stratified by type of hospital; measures of correlation and agreement between hospital-level outcomes risk adjusted using Medicare data alone and Medicare data with SEER data.  Results:   There were large survival differences between different types of hospitals that treat Medicare patients with cancer. At 1 year, mortality for patients treated by hospitals exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system was 10% lower than at community hospitals (18% vs 28%) across all cancers, and the pattern persisted through 5 years of follow-up and within specific cancer categories. Performance ranking of hospitals was consistent with or without SEER-Medicare disease stage information (weighted κ ≥ 0.81).  Conclusions and relevance:   Potentially important outcome differences exist between different types of hospitals that treat patients with cancer after risk adjustment using information in Medicare administrative data. This type of risk adjustment may be adequate for evaluating hospital performance, since the additional adjustment for data available only in cancer registries does not seem to appreciably alter measures of performance.""","""['David G Pfister', 'David M Rubin', 'Elena B Elkin', 'Ushma S Neill', 'Elaine Duck', 'Mark Radzyner', 'Peter B Bach']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Data Errors in Table.', 'Assessing whether cancer stage is needed to evaluate measures of hospital surgical performance.', 'Area-level variations in cancer care and outcomes.', 'Comparison of 30-day mortality models for profiling hospital performance in acute ischemic stroke with vs without adjustment for stroke severity.', 'Treatment disparities for disabled medicare beneficiaries with stage I non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Updated Overview of the SEER-Medicare Data: Enhanced Content and Applications.', 'The RECOURSE Study: Long-term Oncologic Outcomes Associated With Robotically Assisted Minimally Invasive Procedures for Endometrial, Cervical, Colorectal, Lung, or Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Learning and visualizing chronic latent representations using electronic health records.', 'Factors Mediating Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Delayed Treatment of Breast Cancer.', 'Making National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center Knowledge Accessible to Community Oncologists via an Online Tumor Board: Longitudinal Observational Study.', 'Between-hospital variations in 3-year survival among patients with newly diagnosed gastric, colorectal, and lung cancer.']"""

Although it has been held for some time that the transcription factor Sp1 is the main stimulator of AR gene transcription, comprehensive knowledge of the regulation of the AR gene remains incomplete. Here we describe and characterise in detail two novel active regulatory elements in the 5'UTR of the human AR gene. Both of these elements contain overlapping binding sites for the positive transcription factor Sp1 and the repressor protein pur-α. Aberrant cell signalling is characteristic of PCa and the transcriptional activity of the AR promoter in PCa cells is dependent upon the relative amounts of the two transcription factors. Together with our corroboration of the dominant role of Sp1, the findings support the rationale of targeting this transcription factor to inhibit tumour progression.

The functional significance of this loss is incompletely understood. The present study explores the effects of restored GSTP1 expression on glutathione levels, accumulation of oxidative DNA damage, and prostate cancer cell survival following oxidative stress induced by protracted, low dose rate ionizing radiation (LDR).  Methods:   GSTP1 protein expression was stably restored in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The effect of GSTP1 restoration on protracted LDR-induced oxidative DNA damage was measured by GC-MS quantitation of modified bases. Reduced and oxidized glutathione levels were measured in control and GSTP1 expressing populations. Clonogenic survival studies of GSTP1- transfected LNCaP cells after exposure to protracted LDR were performed. Global gene expression profiling and pathway analysis were performed.  Results:   GSTP1 expressing cells accumulated less oxidized DNA base damage and exhibited decreased survival compared to control LNCaP-Neo cells following oxidative injury induced by protracted LDR. Restoration of GSTP1 expression resulted in changes in modified glutathione levels that correlated with GSTP1 protein levels in response to protracted LDR-induced oxidative stress. Survival differences were not attributable to depletion of cellular glutathione stores. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis following GSTP1 restoration suggests this protein plays a key role in regulating prostate cancer cell survival.  Conclusions:   The ubiquitous epigenetic silencing of GSTP1 in prostate cancer results in enhanced survival and accumulation of potentially promutagenic DNA adducts following exposure of cells to protracted oxidative injury suggesting a protective, anti-neoplastic function of GSTP1. The present work provides mechanistic backing to the tumor suppressor function of GSTP1 and its role in prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Omar Y Mian', 'Mohamed H Khattab', 'Mohammad Hedayati', 'Jonathan Coulter', 'Budri Abubaker-Sharif', 'Julie M Schwaninger', 'Ravi K Veeraswamy', 'James D Brooks', 'Lisa Hopkins', 'Debika Biswal Shinohara', 'Brian Cornblatt', 'William G Nelson', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Theodore L DeWeese']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Protection against oxidative DNA damage and stress in human prostate by glutathione S-transferase P1.', 'piR-31470 epigenetically suppresses the expression of glutathione S-transferase pi 1 in prostate cancer via DNA methylation.', 'Protection against 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine cytotoxicity and DNA adduct formation in human prostate by glutathione S-transferase P1.', 'Preneoplastic prostate lesions: an opportunity for prostate cancer prevention.', 'Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) hypermethylation in prostate cancer: review 2007.', 'Comparative and integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic-wide DNA methylation changes in African American prostate cancer.', 'Chemopreventive Activity of Ellagitannins from Acer pseudosieboldianum (Pax) Komarov Leaves on Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting GSTP1-dependent ferroptosis in lung cancer radiotherapy: Existing evidence and future directions.', 'Blood-based liquid biopsies for prostate cancer: clinical opportunities and challenges.', 'Health inequity drives disease biology to create disparities in prostate cancer outcomes.']"""

To achieve such a plan, patient-specific dosimetric goals reflecting each patient's unique anatomy should be defined and adopted in the treatment planning procedure for plan quality control. This study is to develop such a personalized treatment plan quality control tool by predicting patient-specific dosimetric endpoints (DEs). The incorporation of patient specific DEs is realized by a multi-OAR geometry-dosimetry model, capable of predicting optimal DEs based on the individual patient's geometry. The overall quality of a treatment plan is then judged with a numerical treatment plan quality indicator and characterized as optimal or suboptimal. Taking advantage of clinically available prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plans, we built and evaluated our proposed plan quality control tool. Using our developed tool, six of twenty evaluated plans were identified as sub-optimal plans. After plan re-optimization, these suboptimal plans achieved better OAR dose sparing without sacrificing the PTV coverage, and the dosimetric endpoints of the re-optimized plans agreed well with the model predicted values, which validate the predictability of the proposed tool. In conclusion, the developed tool is able to accurately predict optimally achievable DEs of multiple OARs, identify suboptimal plans, and guide plan optimization.

It decreased protein levels of cyclin D1, Cdc25A and phosphorylated Rb, but activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor and signal transducer, leading to inhibition of downstream mTOR-p70S6K signaling. Knockdown of AMPKα significantly rescued nitroxoline-induced inhibition of cyclin D1-Rb-Cdc25A axis indicating AMPK-dependent mechanism. However, cytoprotective autophagy was simultaneously evoked by nitroxoline. Comet assay and Western blot analysis demonstrated DNA damaging effect and activation of Chk2 other than Chk1 to nitroxoline action. Instead of serving as a DNA repair transducer, nitroxoline-mediated Chk2 activation was identified to function as a pro-apoptotic inducer.

We sought to characterize mechanisms underpinning CD44-promoted adhesion of BLBC cells to vascular endothelial monolayers and extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates. Stimulation with hyaluronan (HA), the native ligand for CD44, increased expression and activation of β1-integrin receptors, and increased α5-integrin subunit expression. Adhesion assays confirmed that CD44-signalling potentiated BLBC cell adhesion to endothelium and Fibronectin in an α5B1-integrin-dependent mechanism. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed HA-promoted association of CD44 with talin and the β1-integrin chain in BLBC cells. Knockdown of talin inhibited CD44 complexing with β1-integrin and repressed HA-induced, CD44-mediated activation of β1-integrin receptors. Immunoblotting confirmed that HA induced rapid phosphorylation of cortactin and paxillin, through a CD44-dependent and β1-integrin-dependent mechanism. Knockdown of CD44, cortactin or paxillin independently attenuated the adhesion of BL-BCa cells to endothelial monolayers and Fibronectin. Accordingly, we conclude that CD44 induced, integrin-mediated signaling not only underpins efficient adhesion of BLBC cells to BMECs to facilitate extravasation but initiates their adhesion to Fibronectin, enabling penetrant cancer cells to adhere more efficiently to underlying Fibronectin-enriched matrix present within the metastatic niche.""","""['Suzanne McFarlane', 'Cheryl McFarlane', 'Nicola Montgomery', 'Ashleigh Hill', 'David J J Waugh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Cortactin underpins CD44-promoted invasion and adhesion of breast cancer cells to bone marrow endothelial cells.', 'CD44 enhances invasion of basal-like breast cancer cells by upregulating serine protease and collagen-degrading enzymatic expression and activity.', 'Regulation of ionizing radiation-induced adhesion of breast cancer cells to fibronectin by alpha5beta1 integrin.', 'Novel CD44-downstream signaling pathways mediating breast tumor invasion.', 'SOD2, a Potential Transcriptional Target Underpinning CD44-Promoted Breast Cancer Progression.', 'RAD-TGTs: high-throughput measurement of cellular mechanotype via rupture and delivery of DNA tension probes.', 'Moderate Constraint Facilitates Association and Force-Dependent Dissociation of HA-CD44 Complex.', 'Proteoglycans Determine the Dynamic Landscape of EMT and Cancer Cell Stemness.', 'CD44 In Sarcomas: A Comprehensive Review and Future Perspectives.', 'Morphological Phenotyping of Organotropic Brain- and Bone-Seeking Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Tumor Cells.']"""

Materials and methods:   Sixty-six consecutive male patients (mean [SD] age, 65.4 [10.8] years) with clinically suspected prostate cancer were included. All patients underwent multiparametric MRI of the prostate (T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and DCE-MRI) on a 3 T MRI scanner. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) score of the detected lesions (group A: PI-RADS ≤3, n = 32; group B: PI-RADS >3, n = 34). In all patients, DCE-MRI was performed using a CAIPIRINHA-Dixon-TWIST volume interpolated breath-hold examination sequence (spatial resolution, 3 × 1.2 × 1.2 mm; temporal resolution, 5 seconds; total sampling duration, 4:10 minutes [250 seconds]) with body weight-adapted administration of contrast agent (gadobutrol, Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany). Five DCE-MRI series with different acquisition durations ranging from 50 to 250 seconds were retrospectively generated from the original data sets. Pharmacokinetic parameters (ie, Ktrans, Kep, Ve, and iAUC60) were calculated for the different sampling durations using the Tofts model. Both lesion groups and all 5 DCE-MRI series were compared regarding pharmacokinetic parameters. Diagnostic accuracy for the detection of potentially malignant lesions was calculated for all 5 series using receiver operating characteristic analysis.  Results:   For all 5 series, Ktrans, Kep, and iAUC60 in patient group B were significantly higher than the respective parameters in patient group A (all P ≤ 0.008). In both groups, Ktrans, Kep, and iAUC60 remained constant at 200 and 150 seconds acquisition duration and did not significantly differ from parameters estimated from the original data sets (250 seconds; all P ≥ 0.310). Ve did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P ≥ 0.337) and acquisition time did not have a significant effect on this parameter (P ≥ 0.275). Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed consistent diagnostic accuracy for the different series; only diagnostic accuracy of Kep decreased with lowered sampling duration, showing lowest accuracy for the 50-second series (0.682; 95% confidence interval, 0.553-0.811).

Many types of cultured cells have been induced to migrate directionally within electrical fields in vitro using a process known as galvanotaxis. The underlying mechanism by which cells sense electrical fields is unknown. In this study, we assembled a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) galvanotaxis system and found that mouse fibroblasts and human prostate cancer PC3 cells migrated to the cathode. By comparing the effects of a pulsed direct current, a constant direct current and an anion-exchange membrane on the directed migration of mouse fibroblasts, we found that these cells responded to the ionic flow in the electrical fields. Taken together, the observed effects of the calcium content of the medium, the function of the store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) and the intracellular calcium content on galvanotaxis indicated that calcium ionic flow from the anode to the cathode within the culture medium permeated the cells through SOCs at the drift velocity, promoting migration toward the cathode. The RTK-PI3K pathway was involved in this process, but the ROCK and MAPK pathways were not. PC3 cells and mouse fibroblasts utilized the same mechanism of galvanotaxis. Together, these results indicated that the signaling pathway responsible for cathode-directed cellular galvanotaxis involved calcium ionic flow from the anode to the cathode within the culture medium, which permeated the cells through SOCs, causing cytoskeletal reorganization via PI3K signaling.""","""['Liang Guo', 'Chunyan Xu', 'Dong Li', 'Xiulan Zheng', 'Jiebing Tang', 'Jingyi Bu', 'Hui Sun', 'Zhengkai Yang', 'Wenjing Sun', 'Xiaoguang Yu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Electric field-directed fibroblast locomotion involves cell surface molecular reorganization and is calcium independent.', 'Calcium influx differentially regulates migration velocity and directedness in response to electric field application.', 'Biphasic monopolar electrical stimulation induces rapid and directed galvanotaxis in adult subependymal neural precursors.', 'Store-operated calcium entry: unveiling the calcium handling signalplex.', 'Cellular mechanisms of direct-current electric field effects: galvanotaxis and metastatic disease.', 'Direct-Current Electrical Field Stimulation of Patient-Derived Colorectal Cancer Cells.', 'Galvanotactic Migration of Glioblastoma and Brain Metastases Cells.', 'Electrically synchronizing and modulating the dynamics of ERK activation to regulate cell fate.', 'Electrical Circuits That Supply Constant Electric Fields In Vitro.', 'Vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cell galvanotactic response and differential migratory behavior.']"""

ASPN contains an aspartic acid (D)-repeat domain and germline polymorphisms in D-repeat-length have been associated with degenerative diseases. Associations of germline ASPN D polymorphisms with risk of prostate cancer progression to metastatic disease have not been assessed.  Experimental design:   Germline ASPN D-repeat-length was retrospectively analyzed in 1,600 men who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer and in 548 noncancer controls. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to test the associations of ASPN variations with risk of subsequent oncologic outcomes, including metastasis. Orthotopic xenografts were used to establish allele- and stroma-specific roles for ASPN D variants in metastatic prostate cancer.  Results:   Variation at the ASPN D locus was differentially associated with poorer oncologic outcomes.

We retrospectively analyzed 155 adult male patients with an initial PSA level≤10 ng/mL and whose PSA levels had been checked more than two times at least 6 months before they had been diagnosed with PCa, with test intervals of more than 3 months. Patients with a urinary tract infection, and patients who had previously undergone cystoscopy or surgery of the prostate were excluded. We separated patients into two groups according to Gleason sum [Gleason sum≤7 (n=134) or Gleason sum≥8 (n=21)] and the presence of extracapsular invasion [organ confined (n=129) or extracapsular invasion (n=26)]. Differences between the groups were compared.  Results:   The group with a Gleason sum≥8 or extracapsular invasion of PCa showed high PSAV and significantly lower %fPSA. There were no significant differences in PSAD and the presence of an abnormality on DRE between two groups.  Conclusion:   In PCa patients treated with other therapies besides prostatectomy, a high PSA velocity and a low %fPSA may predict high grade PCa with a Gleason sum≥8 or the presence of extracapsular invasion.""","""['Sang Jin Kim', 'Tae Yoong Jeong', 'Dae Seon Yoo', 'Jinsung Park', 'Seok Cho', 'Seok Ho Kang', 'Sang Hyub Lee', 'Seung Hyun Jeon', 'Tchun Yong Lee', 'Sung Yul Park']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Yonsei Med J""","""['The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'A comparative performance analysis of total prostate-specific antigen, percentage free prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific antigen velocity and urinary prostate cancer gene 3 in the first, second and third repeat prostate biopsy.', 'Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP): Is a repeat biopsy necessary ASAP?

Thus, several novel therapeutic strategies have been developed to target altered ROS and Ca(2+) signaling pathways in prostate cancer. Here, we investigate alterations of intracellular Ca(2+) and inhibition of cell viability caused by ROS in primary human prostate epithelial cells (hPECs) from healthy tissue and prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145, and PC3). In hPECs, LNCaP and DU145 H2O2 induces an initial Ca(2+) increase, which in prostate cancer cells is blocked at high concentrations of H2O2. Upon depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores, store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is activated. SOCE channels can be formed by hexameric Orai1 channels; however, Orai1 can form heteromultimers with its homolog, Orai3. Since the redox sensor of Orai1 (Cys-195) is absent in Orai3, the Orai1/Orai3 ratio in T cells determines the redox sensitivity of SOCE and cell viability. In prostate cancer cells, SOCE is blocked at lower concentrations of H2O2 compared with hPECs. An analysis of data from hPECs, LNCaP, DU145, and PC3, as well as previously published data from naive and effector TH cells, demonstrates a strong correlation between the Orai1/Orai3 ratio and the SOCE redox sensitivity and cell viability. Therefore, our data support the concept that store-operated Ca(2+) channels in hPECs and prostate cancer cells are heteromeric Orai1/Orai3 channels with an increased Orai1/Orai3 ratio in cells derived from prostate cancer tumors. In addition, ROS-induced alterations in Ca(2+) signaling in prostate cancer cells may contribute to the higher sensitivity of these cells to ROS.""","""['Christian Holzmann', 'Tatiana Kilch', 'Sven Kappel', 'Kathrin Dörr', 'Volker Jung', 'Michael Stöckle', 'Ivan Bogeski', 'Christine Peinelt']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biophys J""","""['STIM1 and Orai1 mediate CRAC channel activity and are essential for human glioblastoma invasion.', 'A novel native store-operated calcium channel encoded by Orai3: selective requirement of Orai3 versus Orai1 in estrogen receptor-positive versus estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Differential redox regulation of ORAI ion channels: a mechanism to tune cellular calcium signaling.', 'Store-operated Ca(2+) entry.', 'Role of Orai3 in the Pathophysiology of Cancer.', 'NNAT is a novel mediator of oxidative stress that suppresses ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Reactive Oxygen Species and Endothelial Ca2+ Signaling: Brothers in Arms or Partners in Crime?', 'Ultrasensitive System for Electrophysiology of Cancer Cell Populations: A Review.', 'Arachidonic acid-regulated calcium signaling in T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis promotes synovial inflammation.']"""

Although the literature suggests a role for the cytoskeleton in counteracting these stresses, there has been no systematic evaluation of which filaments are responsible or to what degree. Here, using a three-dimensional spheroid model, we show that cytoskeletal filaments do not actively support compressive loads in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. However, modulation of tonicity can induce alterations in spheroid size. We find that under compression, tumor cells actively efflux sodium to decrease their intracellular tonicity, and that this is reversible by blockade of sodium channel NHE1. Moreover, although polymerized actin does not actively support the compressive load, it is required for sodium efflux. Compression-induced cell death is increased by both sodium blockade and actin depolymerization, whereas increased actin polymerization offers protective effects and increases sodium efflux. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cancer cells modulate their tonicity to survive under compressive solid stress.""","""['Daniel J McGrail', 'Kathleen M McAndrews', 'Chandler P Brandenburg', 'Nithin Ravikumar', 'Quang Minh N Kieu', 'Michelle R Dawson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biophys J""","""[]"""

Inflammation has recently been identified as an independent risk factor for LUTS and depression. This study aimed to assess the association between depression, anxiety and LUTS, and the moderating influence of systemic inflammation, in the presence of other biopsychosocial confounders.  Methods:   Participants were randomly-selected from urban, community-dwelling males aged 35-80 years at recruitment (n = 1195; sample response rate:67.8%). Of these, 730 men who attended baseline (2002-5) and follow-up clinic visits (2007-10), with complete outcome measures, and without prostate or bladder cancer and/or surgery, neurodegenerative conditions, or antipsychotic medications use, were selected for the present study. Unadjusted and multi-adjusted regression models of incident storage and voiding LUTS and incident depression and anxiety were combined with serum inflammatory markers (high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO), soluble e-selectin (e-Sel)) and socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assessed the moderating effect of inflammatory markers.  Results:   The incidence of storage, voiding LUTS, depression and anxiety was 16.3% (n = 108), 12.1% (n = 88), 14.5% (n = 108), and 12.2% (n = 107). Regression models demonstrated that men with depression and anxiety at baseline were more likely to have incident storage, but not voiding LUTS (OR: 1.26, 99%CI: 1.01-4.02; and OR:1.74; 99%CI:1.05-2.21, respectively). Men with anxiety and storage LUTS at baseline were more likely to have incident depression (OR: 2.77, 99%CI: 1.65-7.89; and OR:1.45; 99%CI:1.05-2.36, respectively), while men with depression and voiding LUTS were more likely to have anxiety at follow-up (OR: 5.06, 99%CI: 2.81-9.11; and OR:2.40; 99%CI:1.16-4.98, respectively). CRP, TNF-α, and e-Sel were found to have significant moderating effects on the development of storage LUTS (1.06, 0.91-1.96, R2 change: 12.7%), depression (1.17, 1.01-1.54, R2 change: 9.8%), and anxiety (1.35, 1.03-1.76, R2 change: 10.6%), respectively.

Objective:   To molecularly profile archived biopsy specimens from a case of early-onset PCa that rapidly progressed to NePC to identify drivers of the aggressive course and mechanisms of NePC origin and progression.  Design, setting, and participants:   A 47-year-old patient presented with metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma (Gleason score 9). After a 6-month response to androgen deprivation therapy, the patient developed jaundice and liver biopsy revealed exclusively NePC. Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)-isolated DNA was performed from the diagnostic prostate biopsy and the liver biopsy at progression.  Intervention:   Androgen deprivation therapy for adenocarcinoma followed by multiagent chemotherapy for NePC.  Main outcomes and measures:   Identification of the mutational landscape in primary adenocarcinoma and NePC liver metastasis. Whether the NePC arose independently or was derived from the primary adenocarcinoma was considered based on mutational profiles.  Results:   A deleterious somatic SMAD4 L535fs variant was present in both prostate and liver specimens; however, a TP53 R282W mutation was exclusively enriched in the liver specimen. Copy number analysis identified concordant, low-level alterations in both specimens, with focal MYCL amplification and homozygous PTEN, RB1, and MAP2K4 losses identified exclusively in the NePC specimen. Integration with published genomic profiles identified MYCL as a recurrently amplified in NePC.  Conclusions and relevance:   NGS of routine biopsy samples from an exceptional non-responder identified SMAD4 as a driver of the aggressive course and supports derivation of NePC from primary adenocarcinoma (transdifferentiation).""","""['Kunal C Kadakia', 'Scott A Tomlins', 'Saagar K Sanghvi', 'Andi K Cani', 'Kei Omata', 'Daniel H Hovelson', 'Chia-Jen Liu', 'Kathleen A Cooney']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Hematol Oncol""","""['Biallelic tumour suppressor loss and DNA repair defects in de novo small-cell prostate carcinoma.', 'The long noncoding RNA landscape of neuroendocrine prostate cancer and its clinical implications.', 'Clinical features of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Molecular events in neuroendocrine prostate cancer development.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'Imaging of Neuroendocrine Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Case Report: Systemic Treatment and Serial Genomic Sequencing of Metastatic Prostate Adenocarcinoma Progressing to Small Cell Carcinoma.', 'Immune molecular profiling of a multiresistant primary prostate cancer with a neuroendocrine-like phenotype: a case report.', 'Systems Biology of Cancer Metastasis.', 'Tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma: a distinct clinicopathologic entity with a characteristic genomic profile.']"""

Methods:   Microdissection of the prostate, enzymatic digestion, and preparation of single cells was performed from murine and human prostates. Adult PESC marker expressions were compared between a group of C57BL/6 mice and a separate group of castrated C57BL/6 mice. Surface markers CD13/CD271 on human prostate epithelial progenitor cells were evaluated by FACS analyses in cells cultured under novel stem cell conditions. The effect of neurotrophins NGF, NT3, and BDNF were evaluated with respect to their influence on proliferation and activation of human basal PESCs in vitro.  Results:   We demonstrate the highest percentage of CD49f+ and Trop2+ expressing cells in the urethra near prostatic regions of WT mice (Trop2+ proximal: 10% vs. distal to the urethra: 3%, P < 0.001). While a marked increase of Trop2 expressing cells can be measured both in the proximal and distal prostatic regions after castration, the most prominent increase in Trop2+ cells can be measured in the prostatic tissue distant to the urethra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proportion of syndecan-1 expressing cells greatly increases in the regions proximal to the urethra after castration (WT: 5% vs. castrated: 40%). We identified heterogeneous CD13 and nerve growth factor receptor (p75(NGFR), CD271) expression on CD49f(+)/TROP2(high) human basal PESCs. Addition of the neurotrophins NT3, BDNF, and NGF to the stem cell media led to a marked temporary increase in the proliferation of human basal PESCs.  Conclusions:   Our results in mice support the model, in which the proximal urethral region contains the prostate stem cell niche while a stronger androgen-dependent regulation of adult prostate stem cells can be found in the peripheral prostatic tissue.

In this retrospective analysis of a multi-institutional cohort treated by radical prostatectomy (179 CA, 121 AA), we evaluated associations among molecular subtype, race, anatomic tumor location, and androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Subtype (m-ERG(+), m-ETS(+), m-SPINK1(+), or triple-negative) was determined using distribution-based outlier analysis. AR signaling was investigated using gene expression profiling of canonical AR targets. m-ERG(+) was more common in CA than AA men (47% vs 22%, p<0.001). AA men were more likely to be m-SPINK1(+) (13% vs 7%; p=0.069) and triple-negative (50% vs 37%; p=0.043). Racial differences in molecular subtypes did not persist when tumors were analyzed by location, suggesting a biologically important relationship between tumor location and subtype. Accordingly, anterior tumor location was associated with higher Decipher scores and lower global AR signaling.

Loss of SPINT2 expression in tumors has been associated with gene promoter hypermethylation; however, little is known about the mechanisms of SPINT2 deregulation in prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to analyze SPINT2 expression levels and understand the possible regulation by SPINT2 promoter hypermethylation in PCa. In a cohort of 57 cases including non-neoplastic and PCa tissues, SPINT2 expression and promoter methylation was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and methylation-specific PCR, respectively. Methylation status of the SPINT2 promoter was also evaluated by bisulfite sequencing and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. Oncomine and TCGA databases were used to perform in silico PCa analysis of SPINT2 mRNA and methylation levels. A reduction in SPINT2 expression levels from non-neoplastic to PCa tissues was observed; however, none of the cases exhibited SPINT2 promoter methylation. Both bisulfite sequencing and 5-aza demonstrated that SPINT2 promoter is not methylated in PCa cells. Bioinformatics approaches did not show downregulation of SPINT2 at the mRNA level and, in corroboration with our results, SPINT2 promoter region is reported to be unmethylated. Our study suggests an involvement of SPINT2 in PCa tumorigenesis, probably in association with a post-translational regulation of SPINT2.""","""['Márcia Santos Pereira', 'Gisele Caravina de Almeida', 'Filipe Pinto', 'Marta Viana-Pereira', 'Rui Manuel Reis']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Histochem Cytochem""","""['SPINT2 is hypermethylated in both IDH1 mutated and wild-type glioblastomas, and exerts tumor suppression via reduction of c-Met activation.', 'Study on the methylation status of SPINT2 gene and its expression in cervical carcinoma.', 'DNA methylation paradigm shift: 15-lipoxygenase-1 upregulation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer by atypical promoter hypermethylation.', 'Hypermethylation of Cyclin D2 is associated with loss of mRNA expression and tumor development in prostate cancer.', 'Serine peptidase inhibitor Kunitz type 2 (SPINT2) in cancer development and progression.', 'Discovering Breast Cancer Biomarkers Candidates through mRNA Expression Analysis Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas Database.', 'Dysregulation of Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases and Ligand-Dependent Activation of MET in Urological Cancers.', 'Loss of SPINT2 expression frequently occurs in glioma, leading to increased growth and invasion via MMP2.', 'The Gene Master Regulators (GMR) Approach Provides Legitimate Targets for Personalized, Time-Sensitive Cancer Gene Therapy.', 'Deciphering the scalene association among type-2 diabetes mellitus, prostate cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia via enrichment analysis of disease-gene network.']"""

However, R-bicalutamide was discovered to exhibit some agonistic properties in clinical application. According to reports, the W741L AR mutation may lead to resistance towards R-bicalutamide. But the mechanism of the R-bicalutamide switch from an antagonist to an agonist due to the mutation of AR W741L is still not so clear. Another molecule, S-1, owing to a very similar structure to R-bicalutamide, is always agonistic to both the wild type and W741L AR. The main difference between these two chemicals is that S-1 has an ether linkage while R-bicalutamide has a sulfonyl group. To study the drug-resistant mechanism caused by W741L mutation and the opposite effects arising from subtle structure differences, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations were employed to explore the interaction mechanisms between R-bicalutamide/S-1 and WT/W741L AR. The calculated binding free energies are in accordance with the reported experimental values. The obtained results indicate that M895 and W741 are vital amino acids in the antagonism of R-bicalutamide. The bulkier substitution of sulfonyl and tryptophan push aside M895, together with helix 12 (H12), to expose the ligand-binding domain resulting in the antagonistic conformation of the AR. If W741 is mutated to L741, the B-ring of these two chemicals would shift toward L741. At the same time, M895 dragging helix H12, would also move closer to L741. So H12 tends to cover the AR ligand-binding domain to a certain degree, changing the androgen receptor from an antagonistic to an agonistic conformation, which may explain the agonism of R-bicalutamide to the mutant W741L AR.""","""['Hongli Liu', 'Xiaoli An', 'Shuyan Li', 'Yuwei Wang', 'Jiazhong Li', 'Huanxiang Liu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Biosyst""","""['Molecular mechanism of R-bicalutamide switching from androgen receptor antagonist to agonist induced by amino acid mutations using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation.', 'Learning from estrogen receptor antagonism: structure-based identification of novel antiandrogens effective against multiple clinically relevant androgen receptor mutants.', 'Molecular basis of agonicity and antagonicity in the androgen receptor studied by molecular dynamics simulations.', 'Developments in nonsteroidal antiandrogens targeting the androgen receptor.', 'Non-Steroidal Androgen Receptor Antagonists and Prostate Cancer: A Survey on Chemical Structures Binding this Fast-Mutating Target.', 'Structure-Based Study to Overcome Cross-Reactivity of Novel Androgen Receptor Inhibitors.', 'Chrysophanol localizes in mitochondria to promote cell death through upregulation of mitochondrial cyclophilin D in HepG2 cells.', 'An Overview of Next-Generation Androgen Receptor-Targeted Therapeutics in Development for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor degradation by the proteolysis-targeting chimera ARCC-4 outperforms enzalutamide in cellular models of prostate cancer drug resistance.', 'Precision medicine applications in prostate cancer.']"""

Here we find that seven different mouse models of human osteolytic bone metastases-representing breast, lung and prostate cancers, as well as multiple myeloma-exhibited impaired muscle function, implicating a role for the tumor-bone microenvironment in cancer-associated muscle weakness. We found that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, released from the bone surface as a result of metastasis-induced bone destruction, upregulated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), resulting in elevated oxidization of skeletal muscle proteins, including the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel (RyR1). The oxidized RyR1 channels leaked Ca(2+), resulting in lower intracellular signaling, which is required for proper muscle contraction. We found that inhibiting RyR1 leakage, TGF-β signaling, TGF-β release from bone or Nox4 activity improved muscle function in mice with MDA-MB-231 bone metastases. Humans with breast- or lung cancer-associated bone metastases also had oxidized skeletal muscle RyR1 that is not seen in normal muscle. Similarly, skeletal muscle weakness, increased Nox4 binding to RyR1 and oxidation of RyR1 were present in a mouse model of Camurati-Engelmann disease, a nonmalignant metabolic bone disorder associated with increased TGF-β activity.

Patients with high PSA levels have to undergo unnecessary but physically painful and expensive procedure such as prostate biopsies repeatedly. The reliability of PC test can be greatly increased by finding a protein that is secreted selectively by malignant, but not normal, prostate cells. A recently discovered novel protein, referred as neuroendocrine marker (NEM), is secreted only by malignant prostate cells and released in blood circulation. Although NEM seems to be significantly more reliable based on the data obtained from a limited cohort, currently available NEM ELISA is not suitable for undertaking a large study. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to develop an alternative, label-free assay system that can reliably measure NEM and PSA in patient samples. Herein an optofluidic chip that can reliably detect PSA as well as NEM in patient samples has been developed. The optofluidic chip, which consists of arrayed nanopore-based sensors fabricated from anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) thin film, offers improved sensitivity upon the optimization of the concentration of the detector antibodies immobilized on the sensor surface. The results demonstrate that the chip is reliable, extremely sensitive and requires just 1 µl of patient serum (or even less) to measure PSA and NEM even in a non-cancer individual. Compared with the traditional ELISA for PSA, the nanopore-based sensor assay is 50-100 fold more sensitive, and offers many advantages such as elimination of labeled antigen, need for sophisticated equipment and highly trained individuals. These advantages, along with the low cost, should make the technology suitable for point-of-care application to screen elderly male populations for PC and to monitor the progress of patients undergoing PC treatment.""","""['Salah Alzghoul', 'Mohammad Hailat', 'Sandra Zivanovic', 'Long Que', 'Girish V Shah']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Silver nanoprism etching-based plasmonic ELISA for the high sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen.', 'Ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for PSA biomarker detection in prostate cancer cells using gold nanoparticles/PAMAM dendrimer loaded with enzyme linked aptamer as integrated triple signal amplification strategy.', 'High-sensitivity immunoassay with surface plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy using a plastic sensor chip: application to quantitative analysis of total prostate-specific antigen and GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-linked prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Prostatic specific antigen and bone scan in the diagnosis and follow-up of prostate cancer.

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results 9 database, we compared the most up-to-date age-specific estimates that might have been obtained with the database including patients diagnosed up to 2001 with 10-year survival later observed for patients diagnosed in 1997-2001.  Results:   For cancers with little or no increase in survival over time, the various estimates of 10-year relative survival potentially available by the end of 2001 were generally rather similar. For malignancies with strongly increasing survival over time, including breast and prostate cancer and all hematological malignancies, the boomerang method provided estimates that were closest to later observed 10-year relative survival in 23 of the 34 groups assessed.

Materials and methods:   Men undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer were included. Men with a history of pelvic surgery and/or radiation and/or trauma, obesity, or neurological diseases were excluded. Nerve conduction studies were performed before and after prostate removal. The St. Mark's pudendal electrode was used for pudendal (control) stimulation. The ProPep Nerve-Monitoring System (ProPep Surgical, Austin, TX) was used to stimulate the neurovascular bundle at the level of the prostate base, mid, and apex. ProPep needle electrodes inserted into the RS were used to measure evoked compound motor action potential response. Results were only included if a valid pudendal control was elicited.  Results:   Seventeen men in total underwent investigation. Valid measurements were obtained after initial quality control in seven. In two cases, evidence of sphincteric activation was observed, providing evidence to support neurovascular bundle innervation of the RS. In the other five patients, no intrapelvic nerve supply was demonstrated.  Conclusion:   Somatic nerve supply to the RS is variable. Direct intrapelvic supply to the RS may exist in some men.

Objective:   To compare adverse pathologic outcomes in men with favorable-risk prostate cancer who underwent delayed prostatectomy after surveillance (DPAS) to those who elected immediate prostatectomy (IRP).  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective AS registry from 2004 to 2014. From the Johns Hopkins AS program (n = 1298), we identified a subset of men who underwent DPAS (n = 89) and was representative of the entire cohort, not just those that were reclassified to higher risk. These men were compared with men who underwent IRP (n = 3788).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We measured adverse pathologic features (primary Gleason pattern ≥ 4, seminal vesicle invasion [SVI], or lymph node [LN] positivity). Multivariable models were adjusted for age, prostate-specific antigen density, and baseline risk classification.  Results and limitations:   Delayed prostatectomy occurred at a median of 2.0 yr (range: 0.6-9.0) after diagnosis. The DPAS and IRP cohorts demonstrated similar proportions of men with primary Gleason pattern ≥ 4 (17% vs 20%; p = 0.11), SVI (3.3% vs 3.2%; p = 0.53), LN positivity (2.3% vs 1.2%; p = 0.37), and overall adverse pathologic features (21.3% vs 17.0%; p = 0.32). The adjusted odds ratio of adverse pathology was 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-2.79; p = 0.13) for DPAS as compared with IRP. Limitations include a modest cohort size and a limited number of events.  Conclusions:   In men with favorable-risk cancer, the decision to undergo AS is not independently associated with adverse pathologic outcomes.  Patient summary:   This report compares men with favorable-risk prostate cancer who elected active surveillance with those who underwent immediate surgery accounting for evidence that approximately one-third of men who choose surveillance will eventually undergo treatment. Our findings suggest that men who are closely followed with surveillance may have similar outcomes to men who elect immediate surgery, but additional research is needed.""","""['Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'Debasish Sundi', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Patricia Landis', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Mufaddal Mamawala']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Another Reason to Consider Active Surveillance.', 'Re: Jeffrey J.

HA fragments act through HA receptors including CD44, LYVE1, TLR2, 4 and the receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM/HMMR). RHAMM is a multifunctional protein with both intracellular and extracellular roles in cell motility and proliferation. Extracellular RHAMM binds directly to HA fragments while intracellular RHAMM binds directly to ERK1 and tubulin. Both HA and regions of tubulin (s-tubulin) are anionic and bind to basic amino acid-rich regions in partner proteins, such as in HA and tubulin binding regions of RHAMM. We used this as a rationale for developing bioinformatics and SPR (surface plasmon resonance) based screening to identify high affinity anionic RHAMM peptide ligands. A library of 12-mer peptides was prepared based on the carboxyl terminal tail sequence of s-tubulin isoforms and assayed for their ability to bind to the HA/tubulin binding region of recombinant RHAMM using SPR. This approach resulted in the isolation of three 12-mer peptides with nanomolar affinity for RHAMM. These peptides bound selectively to RHAMM but not to CD44 or TLR2,4 and blocked RHAMM:HA interactions. Furthermore, fluorescein-peptide uptake by PC3MLN4 prostate cancer cells was blocked by RHAMM mAb but not by CD44 mAb. These peptides also reduced the ability of prostate cancer cells to degrade collagen type I. The selectivity of these novel HA peptide mimics for RHAMM suggest their potential for development as HA mimetic imaging and therapeutic agents for HA-promoted disease.""","""['Kenneth Virgel N Esguerra', 'Cornelia Tolg', 'Natalia Akentieva', 'Matthew Price', 'Choi-Fong Cho', 'John D Lewis', 'James B McCarthy', 'Eva A Turley', 'Leonard G Luyt']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Integr Biol (Camb)""","""['Ras-transformed cells express both CD44 and RHAMM hyaluronan receptors: only RHAMM is essential for hyaluronan-promoted locomotion.', 'The hyaluronan receptors CD44 and Rhamm (CD168) form complexes with ERK1,2 that sustain high basal motility in breast cancer cells.', 'Interactions of peptide mimics of hyaluronic acid with the receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM).', 'Deregulation of hyaluronan synthesis, degradation and binding promotes breast cancer.', 'Design of peptide mimetics to block pro-inflammatory functions of HA fragments.', 'Increased expression of HMMR in renal cell carcinoma is an independent prognostic factor.', 'The role of RHAMM in cancer: Exposing novel therapeutic vulnerabilities.', 'Proteoglycans in Toll-like receptor responses and innate immunity.', 'RHAMM Is a Multifunctional Protein That Regulates Cancer Progression.', 'Effect of injectable composites of calcium sulfate and hyaluronate in enhancing osteogenesis.']"""

Measurement of TERC, TERT, and telomerase activity revealed that only the epithelial stem-like and progenitor fractions expressed high levels of telomerase activity (p<0.01) and individual enzyme components (p<0.01). Telomerase activity and TERT expression were not detected in stromal cells. Telomere length measurements reflected this activity, although the average telomere length of (telomerase-negative) luminal cells was equivalent to that of telomerase-expressing stem/progenitor cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of patient-derived BPH arrays identified distinct areas of luminal hyperproliferation, basal hyperproliferation, and basal-luminal hyperproliferation, suggesting that basal and luminal cells can proliferate independently of each other. We propose a separate lineage for the luminal and basal cell components in BPH.  Patient summary:   We unexpectedly found an enzyme called telomerase in the cells that maintain benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), suggesting that telomerase inhibitors could be used to alleviate BPH symptoms.""","""['Jayant K Rane', 'Sarah Greener', 'Fiona M Frame', 'Vincent M Mann', 'Matthew S Simms', 'Anne T Collins', 'Daniel M Berney', 'Norman J Maitland']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Maintaining a Healthy Balance: Targeting TERT to Stem Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia show shorter leukocyte telomere length but no association with telomerase gene polymorphisms in Han Chinese males.', 'Stem cell features of benign and malignant prostate epithelial cells.', 'An appraisal of telomerase activity in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Detection of telomerase activity in prostate massage samples improves differentiating prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Association of TERT gene polymorphisms with clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia in a Chinese Han population of the Northwest region.', 'Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia show shorter leukocyte telomere length but no association with telomerase gene polymorphisms in Han Chinese males.', 'Cancer telomeres and white crows.', 'Phospholipase D inhibitors reduce human prostate cancer cell proliferation and colony formation.', 'Telomeres and telomerase in prostate cancer development and therapy.']"""

There are only few human studies showing the presence of PACAP and its receptors in urogenital tumors; therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare PACAP-LI in different healthy and pathological human samples from urogenital organs (kidney, urinary bladder, prostate, testis) with radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. Similar to our earlier observations, the PACAP27-LI was significantly lower compared to PACAP38-LI in all samples. We did not find significant alterations in PACAP-LI between healthy and tumoral samples from the urinary bladder and testis. On the other hand, we found significantly lower PACAP38-LI level in kidney tumors compared with healthy tissue samples, and we showed higher PACAP27-LI in prostatic cancer compared to samples from benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Methods and materials:   Between January 2002 and September 2013, 413 low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients were treated with HDR brachytherapy monotherapy to 2700-2800 cGy in two fractions (n = 85), iodine-125 LDR brachytherapy monotherapy to 14,500 cGy in one fraction (n = 249), or IMRT monotherapy to 7400-8100 cGy in 37-45 fractions (n = 79) without pelvic lymph node irradiation. No androgen deprivation therapy was given. Patients used an international prostate symptoms score questionnaire, an expanded prostate cancer index composite-26 bowel questionnaire, and a sexual health inventory for men questionnaire to assess their urinary, bowel, and sexual HRQOL, respectively, pretreatment and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months posttreatment.

To evaluate how these changes may affect the field of radiation oncology, we evaluated the association of insurance status with the use of brachytherapy in cancers for which this treatment technique is used.  Methods and materials:   A total of 190,467 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 95,292 (50.0%) had breast cancer, 61,096 (32.1%) had prostate cancer, 28,194 (14.8%) had endometrial cancer, and 5885 (3.1%) had cervical cancer. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the association between insurance status and receipt of brachytherapy among patients treated definitively for prostate and cervical cancer or postoperatively for breast and endometrial cancer.  Results:   The rates of non-Medicaid insurance were 49.9% (cervical), 85.3% (endometrial), 87.4% (breast), and 90.9% (prostate) (P<.001). In a logistic regression, patients who received radiation therapy were less likely to receive brachytherapy if they had Medicaid coverage (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.61, P<.001) or did not have insurance coverage (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.45-0.56, P<.001) compared with those with non-Medicaid insurance. On subset analysis, patients with Medicaid coverage or without insurance coverage were significantly less likely to receive brachytherapy than were those with non-Medicaid insurance for all 4 sites, except for patients with endometrial cancer.  Conclusions:   Despite being a cost-effective treatment modality, brachytherapy is less often used in the definitive or postoperative management of cancer in patients with Medicaid coverage or without insurance.

The effect on prostate volume is mediated by a reduction in dihydrotestosterone; however, this reduction is counterbalanced by a 25% rise in serum testosterone levels. Therefore, 5-ARI use might have systemic effects and differentially affect bone mineral density, muscular mass and strength, as well as falls, all of which are major determinants of fractures in older men.  Methods:   We conducted a nationwide cohort study of all Swedish men who used 5-ARI by comparing their risk of hip fracture, any type of fracture and of falls with matched control men randomly selected from the population and unexposed to 5-ARI.  Results:   During 1 417 673 person-years of follow-up, 10 418 men had a hip fracture, 19 570 any type of fracture and 46 755 a fall requiring hospital care. Compared with unexposed men, current users of 5-ARI had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.96 (95% CI 0.91-1.02) for hip fracture, an HR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.98) for all fracture and an HR of 0.99 (95% CI 0.96-1.02) for falls. Former users had an increased risk of hip fractures (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19).

However, the role of RILP in other cancers and the underlying mechanism for RILP in regulating the invasion of cancer cells remain to be investigated. In this study, we showed that overexpression of RILP in breast cancer cells inhibits the migration and invasion, whereas the depletion of RILP by RNAi-mediated knockdown promotes the migration and invasion. We identified RalGDS (Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator) as a novel interacting partner for RILP, and truncation analysis revealed the N-terminal region of RILP is responsible for interacting with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain of RalGDS.

However, it has not been widely investigated whether the pretreatment NLR is associated with the pathological characteristics of prostate cancer (PCa) and biochemical recurrence in PCa patients receiving radical prostatectomy (RP).In this cohort study, a total of 1688 PCa patients who had undergone RP were analyzed retrospectively, and a subset of 237 of these patients were evaluated to determine the relationship between pretreatment NLR and biochemical recurrence. Patients were divided into a high-NLR group (NLR ≥2.36) and a low-NLR group (NLR < 2.36) according to the pretreatment NLR. The association between the pretreatment NLR and pathological stage and lymph node involvement was evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Time of biochemical recurrence was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox's proportional hazard regression model was used to compare the time of biochemical recurrence between the groups.As compared with patients in the low-NLR group, those in the high-NLR group had an increased risk of pT3-4 disease (odds ratio (OR), 1.883; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.419-2.500; P < 0.001), and a 1.7-fold increased risk of lymph node involvement (OR, 1.685; 95% CI, 1.101-2.579; P = 0.016). For the subset of 237 patients, those with a high NLR showed a significantly shorter median biochemical recurrence-free survival time (51.9 months) than those with a low NLR (76.5 months; log-rank test, P = 0.019). However, multivariate analysis indicated that the NLR was not an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.388; 95% CI, 0.909-2.118; P = 0.129).Our findings suggest that the pretreatment NLR may be associated with pathological stage and lymph node involvement in PCa patients receiving RP, and that PCa patients with a high NLR may have a higher rate of biochemical recurrence following RP than those with a low NLR.""","""['Gui-Ming Zhang', 'Yao Zhu', 'Xiao-Cheng Ma', 'Xiao-Jian Qin', 'Fang-Ning Wan', 'Bo Dai', 'Li-Jiang Sun', 'Ding-Wei Ye']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['High preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio predicts biochemical recurrence in patients with localized prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Neutrophil and Lymphocyte Counts as Clinical Markers for Stratifying Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic impact of preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio after radical prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer.', 'Outcome after radical prostatectomy with a pretreatment prostate biopsy Gleason score of >/=8.', 'Predictors of biochemical recurrence after Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Analysis of 359 cases with a median follow-up period of 26\xa0months.', 'Improving the Post-Operative Prediction of BCR-Free Survival Time with mRNA Variables and Machine Learning.', 'The Values of Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio in Predicting Biochemical Recurrence in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Pretreatment Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio: A Prognostic Biomarker of Survival in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'Assessment of PSIM (Prostatic Systemic Inflammatory Markers) Score in Predicting Pathologic Features at Robotic Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Who Met the Inclusion Criteria for Active Surveillance.', 'Preoperative Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Following Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Here, we report a seminal crosstalk between dying and residual live tumor cells during treatment with DTX that can result in outgrowth of a chemoresistant population. Survival was due to the induction of secretory/cytoplasmic clusterin (sCLU), which is a potent anti-apoptotic protein known to bind and sequester Bax from mitochondria, to prevent caspase 3 activation. sCLU induction in live cells depended on HMGB1 release from dying cells. Supernatants from DTX-treated DU145 tumor cells, which were shown to contain HMGB1, effectively induced sCLU from newly-plated DU145 tumor cells and protected them from DTX toxicity. Addition of anti-HMBG1 to the supernatant or pretreatment of newly-plated DU145 tumor cells with anti-TLR4 or anti-RAGE markedly abrogated sCLU induction and protective effect of the supernatant. Mechanistically, HMGB1 activated NFκB to promote sCLU gene expression and prevented the translocation of activated Bax to mitochondria to block cell death. Importantly, multiple currently-used chemotherapeutic drugs could release HMGB1 from tumor cells. These results suggest that acquisition of chemoresistance may involve the HMGB1/TLR4-RAGE/sCLU pathway triggered by dying cells to provide survival advantage to remnant live tumor cells.""","""['Junmin Zhou', 'Xianghong Chen', 'Danielle L Gilvary', 'Melba M Tejera', 'Erika A Eksioglu', 'Sheng Wei', 'Julie Y Djeu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Induction of clusterin by AKT--role in cytoprotection against docetaxel in prostate tumor cells.', 'Clusterin knockdown using the antisense oligonucleotide OGX-011 re-sensitizes docetaxel-refractory prostate cancer PC-3 cells to chemotherapy.', 'Clusterin over-expression modulates proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Clusterin and chemoresistance.', 'Secretory Clusterin: A Promising Target for Chemoresistance of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Mechanisms involved in the HMGB1 modulation of tumor multidrug resistance (Review).', 'Cell death, therapeutics, and the immune response in cancer.', 'Emerging mitochondrial signaling mechanisms in cardio-oncology: beyond oxidative stress.', 'Chemotherapy Resistance: Role of Mitochondrial and Autophagic Components.', 'Inflammation, Extracellular Matrix Remodeling, and Proteostasis in Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

While active surveillance is increasingly utilized, the majority of patients are currently treated with radical prostatectomy. In order to avoid over-treatment, there is an indisputable need for reliable biomarkers to identify the potentially aggressive and lethal cases. Nuclear intermediate filament proteins called lamins play a role in chromatin organization, gene expression and cell stiffness. The expression of lamin A is associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer but to date the prognostic value of the lamins has not been tested in other solid tumors.  Methods:   We studied the expression of different lamins with immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray material of 501 PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection. Patients were divided into two staining categories (low and high expression). The correlation of lamin expression with clinicopathological variables was tested and the association of lamin status with biochemical recurrence (BCR) and disease specific survival (DSS) was further analyzed.  Results:   Low expression of lamin A associated with lymph node positivity (p<0.01) but not with other clinicopathological variables and low expression had a borderline independent significant association with DSS (HR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-1.0; p = 0.052). Similarly, low lamin C expression associated with poorer survival (HR = 0.2; 95% CI 0.1-0.6; p = 0.004). Lamin B1 expression did not associate with clinicopathological variables but high expression independently predicted BCR in multivariable Cox regression analysis (HR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-2.9; p = 0.023). Low expression of lamin B2 correlated with lymph node positivity (p<0.01) and predicted unfavorable DSS (HR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-1.0; p = 0.047).  Conclusions:   These results suggest differential roles for lamins in PCa progression. Reduced amounts of lamin A/C and B2 increase risk for lymph node metastasis and disease specific death possibly through increased nuclear deformability while high expression of lamin B1 predicts disease recurrence.""","""['Irena Saarinen', 'Tuomas Mirtti', 'Heikki Seikkula', 'Peter J Boström', 'Pekka Taimen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Differential expression of nuclear lamins in normal and cancerous prostate tissues.', 'Nuclear C-MYC expression level is associated with disease progression and potentially predictive of two year overall survival in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of p53 nuclear accumulation in localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Partners and post-translational modifications of nuclear lamins.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'LMNB1, a potential marker for early prostate cancer progression.', 'Long Noncoding RNA SNHG1 Regulates LMNB2 Expression by Sponging miR-326 and Promotes Cancer Growth in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'CLICK-enabled analogues reveal pregnenolone interactomes in cancer and immune cells.', 'Tailoring Cellular Function: The Contribution of the Nucleus in Mechanotransduction.', 'Lamin A/C: Function in Normal and Tumor Cells.']"""

In the current study, we sought to validate the molecular model using time-dependent measures of AUC and predictive values for discriminating lethal from non-lethal prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using data from the initial study, we fit survival models for men with prostate cancer who were participants in the Physicians' Health Study (PHS; n = 276). Based on these models, we generated prognostic risk scores in an independent population, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; n = 347) to evaluate external validity. In each cohort, men were followed prospectively from cancer diagnosis through 2011 for development of distant metastasis or cancer mortality. We measured protein tumor expression of PTEN, SMAD4, SPP1, and CCND1 on tissue microarrays.  Results:   During a median of 11.9 and 14.3 years follow-up in the PHS and HPFS cohorts, 24 and 32 men (9%) developed lethal disease.

In this study we investigate, by the comet assay, the ability of 3,4-DHPEA to inhibit the H2O2 induced DNA damage when pre-incubated with PBMC and then removed before the exposure of cells to H2O2. Low doses of 3,4-DHPEA (10-100 μM) pre-incubated for 30 min with PBMC reduced the DNA damage induced by the treatment with H2O2 200 μM for 5 min at 4 °C. Prolonging the exposure time up to 6 h completely prevented the DNA damage. Furthermore we extensively analysed, by the MTT assay, the anti-proliferative activities of 3,4-DHPEA on breast (MDA and MCF-7), prostate (LNCap and PC3) and colon (SW480 and HCT116) cancer cell lines and correlated these effects with the H2O2 accumulation. The concentration of H2O2 in the culture medium was measured by the ferrous ion oxidation-xylenol orange method. The proliferation of all the cell lines was inhibited but at different levels: the prostate cancer cells were more resistant to the growth inhibition with respect to breast and colon cancer cells. The ability of the different cell lines to remove H2O2 from the culture medium was inversely correlated with their sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effect of 3,4-DHPEA.

In the case of both cancer types, prognoses are precarious and depend on many factors, such as the size of the primary tumor, infiltration of regional lymph nodes, histological grade and occurrence of distant metastases.  Objectives:   The objective of this work is to verify the coincidence of prostate cancer and bladder cancer in patients who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy in Wroclaw Medical University, Department of Urology and Oncological Urology, as well as to indicate factors that may influence the peri- and post-operative course.  Material and methods:   We have retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy for muscular-invasive bladder cancer between 2009 and 2014, which comprised of 116 male patients. We managed to establish telephone and personal contact with the patients.  Results:   Seventeen of the 116 patients were diagnosed with coincidental prostate cancer in post-operative histological examination (14.6%). This result is lower than in other series of cystoprostatectomy cases (range 23-68%). The mean age of patient was 68.9 years and the median was 69.5 years. Factors influencing the peri- and post-operative periods were not statistically significant.  Conclusions:   Serum PSA level and DRE should be performed more often on patients prepared for radical cystoprostatectomy. An accurate pre-operative assessment of cancer infiltration is required for both types of tumors. Complete resection of prostate prevents residual neoplasm infiltration. It is important to take into account the possibility of primary prostate tumor occurrence in patients qualified for radical cystectomy.

Patients who received initial radiation therapy had an increased risk of subsequent rectal cancer, although this was still lower than that of the general male population.

We measured the impact of direct-to-consumer genomic risk information on changes to perceived risk (ΔPR) of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer among personal genomic testing (PGT) customers. We hypothesized that ΔPR would reflect directionality of risk estimates, attenuate with time, and be modified by participant characteristics.  Methods:   Pathway Genomics and 23andMe customers were surveyed prior to receiving PGT results, and 2 weeks and 6 months post-results. For each cancer, PR was measured on a 5-point ordinal scale from ""much lower than average"" to ""much higher than average."" PGT results, based on genotyping of common genetic variants, were dichotomized as elevated or average risk. The relationship between risk estimate and ΔPR was evaluated with linear regression; generalized estimating equations modeled this relationship over time.  Results:   With the exception of lung cancer (for which ΔPR was positive regardless of result), elevated risk results were significantly associated with positive ΔPR, and average risk results with negative ΔPR (e.g., prostate cancer, 2 weeks: least squares-adjusted ΔPR = 0.77 for elevated risk versus -0.21 for average risk; p-valuedifference < 0.0001) among 1154 participants. Large changes were rare: for each cancer, <4 % of participants overall reported a ΔPR of ±3 or more units. Effect modification by age, cancer family history, and baseline interest was observed for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, respectively. A pattern of decreasing impact on ΔPR over time was consistently observed, but this trend was significant only in the case of colorectal cancer.  Conclusions:   We have quantified the effect on consumer risk perception of returning genetic-based cancer risk information directly to consumers without clinician mediation. Provided via PGT, this information has a measurable but modest effect on perceived cancer risk, and one that is in some cases modified by consumers' non-genetic risk context. Our observations of modest marginal effect sizes, infrequent extreme changes in perceived risk, and a pattern of diminishing impact with time, suggest that the ability of PGT to effect changes to cancer screening and prevention behaviors may be limited by relatively small changes to perceived risk.""","""['Deanna Alexis Carere', 'Tyler VanderWeele', 'Tanya A Moreno', 'Joanna L Mountain', 'J Scott Roberts', 'Peter Kraft', 'Robert C Green;PGen Study Group']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['Personal Genomic Testing for Cancer Risk: Results From the Impact of Personal Genomics Study.', 'Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing: User Motivations, Decision Making, and Perceived Utility of Results.', 'Diet and exercise changes following direct-to-consumer personal genomic testing.', 'Genetic and familial factors influencing breast, colon, prostate and lung cancers.', 'Direct-to-consumer personal genome testing and cancer risk prediction.', 'Polygenic Scores in the Direct-to-Consumer Setting: Challenges and Opportunities for a New Era in Consumer Genetic Testing.', ""May direct-to-consumer genetic testing have an impact on general practitioners' daily practice? a cross-sectional study of patients' intentions towards this approach."", 'Cascading After Peridiagnostic Cancer Genetic Testing: An Alternative to Population-Based Screening.', 'What do people think about genetics?

Methods:   CEST z-spectra were acquired at high-field [11.7 Tesla (T)] from citrate and spermine solutions at physiological pH (6.5) using saturation power 6 μT. CEST was performed at different temperatures to determine exchange regimes (slow, intermediate or fast). For low pH solutions of spermine, exchange rates were estimated from resonance line width, fitting z-spectra using the Bloch equations incorporating exchange, and using quantifying exchange using saturation time experiments (QUEST). These rates were extrapolated to physiological pH.  Results:   Citrate showed little CEST effect at pH 6.5 and temperature (T) = 310 K (maximum 0.001% mM(-1) ), indicating fast exchange, whereas spermine showed greater CEST effects (maximum 0.2% mM(-1) ) indicating intermediate-to-fast exchange. Extrapolating data acquired from low pH spermine solutions predicts exchange rates at pH 6.5 and T of 310 K of at least 2 × 10(4) s(-1) .  Conclusion:   Citrate and spermine show minimal CEST effects at 11.7T even using high saturation power. These effects would be much less than 2% at clinical field-strengths due to relatively faster exchange and would be masked by CEST from proteins. Magn Reson Med 76:742-746, 2016. © 2015 The Authors.

Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive. Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type. In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.""","""['Martin Peifer', 'Falk Hertwig', 'Frederik Roels', 'Daniel Dreidax', 'Moritz Gartlgruber', 'Roopika Menon', 'Andrea Krämer', 'Justin L Roncaioli', 'Frederik Sand', 'Johannes M Heuckmann', 'Fakhera Ikram', 'Rene Schmidt', 'Sandra Ackermann', 'Anne Engesser', 'Yvonne Kahlert', 'Wenzel Vogel', 'Janine Altmüller', 'Peter Nürnberg', 'Jean Thierry-Mieg', 'Danielle Thierry-Mieg', 'Aruljothi Mariappan', 'Stefanie Heynck', 'Erika Mariotti', 'Kai-Oliver Henrich', 'Christian Gloeckner', 'Graziella Bosco', 'Ivo Leuschner', 'Michal R Schweiger', 'Larissa Savelyeva', 'Simon C Watkins', 'Chunxuan Shao', 'Emma Bell', 'Thomas Höfer', 'Viktor Achter', 'Ulrich Lang', 'Jessica Theissen', 'Ruth Volland', 'Maral Saadati', 'Angelika Eggert', 'Bram de Wilde', 'Frank Berthold', 'Zhiyu Peng', 'Chen Zhao', 'Leming Shi', 'Monika Ortmann', 'Reinhard Büttner', 'Sven Perner', 'Barbara Hero', 'Alexander Schramm', 'Johannes H Schulte', 'Carl Herrmann', ""Roderick J O'Sullivan"", 'Frank Westermann', 'Roman K Thomas', 'Matthias Fischer']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nature""","""['TERT rearrangements are frequent in neuroblastoma and identify aggressive tumors.', 'Telomere biology including TERT rearrangements in neuroblastoma: a useful indicator for surgical treatments.', 'Distinct transcriptional MYCN/c-MYC activities are associated with spontaneous regression or malignant progression in neuroblastomas.', 'How Do Telomere Abnormalities Regulate the Biology of Neuroblastoma?', 'TERT-mediated and ATRX-mediated Telomere Maintenance and Neuroblastoma.', 'An overview of the role of telomeres and telomerase in pre‑neoplastic lesions (Review).', 'Etiology of super-enhancer reprogramming and activation in cancer.', 'Defining the landscape of circular RNAs in neuroblastoma unveils a global suppressive function of MYCN.', 'Single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics unravel the role of monocytes in neuroblastoma bone marrow metastasis.', 'Functional polymorphisms of the TET1 gene increase the risk of neuroblastoma in Chinese children.']"""

Design and setting:   Three community juries held at the University of Sydney over 6 months in 2014.  Participants:   Forty participants from New South Wales, of diverse social and cultural backgrounds and with no experience of prostate cancer, recruited through public advertising: two juries of mixed gender and ages; one all-male jury of PSA screening age.  Results:   In contrast to Royal Australian College of General Practitioners guidelines, the three juries concluded that GPs should initiate discussions about PSA testing with asymptomatic men over 50 years of age. The mixed juries voted for GPs offering detailed information about all potential consequent benefits and harms before PSA testing, and favoured a cooling-off period before undertaking the test. The all-male jury recommended a staggered approach to providing information. They recommended that written information be available to those who wanted it, but eight of the 12 jurors thought that doctors should discuss the benefits and harms of biopsy and treatment only after a man had received an elevated PSA test result.  Conclusions:   Informed jury participants preferred that GPs actively supported individual men in making decisions about PSA testing, and that they allowed a cooling-off period before testing.

Several recent large-scale cancer prevention trials with high dose of α-tocopherol, however, yielded disappointing results. Whether vitamin E prevents or promotes cancer is a serious concern. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of the different forms of tocopherols would enhance our understanding of this topic. In this study, we demonstrated that δ-T was the most effective tocopherol form in inhibiting prostate cancer cell growth, by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. By profiling the effects of δ-T on the cell signaling using the phospho-kinase array, we found that the most inhibited target was the phosphorylation of AKT on T308. Further study on the activation of AKT by EGFR and IGFR revealed that δ-T attenuated the EGF/IGF-induced activation of AKT (via the phosphorylation of AKT on T308 induced by the activation of PIK3). Expression of dominant active PIK3 and AKT in prostate cancer cell line DU145 in which PIK3, AKT, and PTEN are wild type caused the cells to be reflectory to the inhibition of δ-T, supporting that δ-T inhibits the PIK3-mediated activation of AKT. Our data also suggest that δ-T interferes with the EGF-induced EGFR internalization, which leads to the inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent activation of AKT.

D2-40 is used to identify the lymphatic vessels and to assess the lymphatic vessel density (LVD). Expression of claudin-4 may be related to invasion and progression of carcinoma cells in several primary tumors. Aim To evaluate intra- and peritumoral LVD through immunohistochemical expression of D2-40 in relation to claudin-4 expression and clinicopathological parameters in prostatic adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods Immunohistochemical staining procedure was performed on 53 paraffin-embedded blocks of radical prostatectomy specimens for prostatic adenocarcinoma using anti D2-40 and claudin-4 antibodies. Sections were evaluated for mean LVD in intratumoral and peritumoral tissues assessed by D2-40 expression. Results LVD in intratumoral tissues was significantly lower compared with peritumoral areas (P = .0001). Peritumoral mean LVD was significantly higher in cases with lymphovascular invasion (P = .041) and in cases with positive lymph node metastasis (P = .003) than intratumoral mean LVD. High claudin-4 expression was significantly correlated with high tumor grade (P = .0001), lymphovascular invasion (P = .006), and positive lymph node metastasis (P = .004).

Conclusion Increased peritumoral mean LVD in prostatic adenocarcinoma is associated with lymphovascular invasion and positive lymph node metastasis.

Patients and methods:   From January 2003 to November 2014, 315 simple prostatectomies were performed using three techniques, LSP, RSP, and IF-RSP; of the patients who underwent these procedures, 236 met the inclusion criteria for this study.  Results:   No statistically significant difference (SSD) was found in preoperative or perioperative variables. Of the postoperative variables that were analyzed, an SSD (p > 0.01) in prostate-specific antigen levels was found, with levels of 0.07 ± 1.1 ng/mL following IF-RSP, and the detection rate of prostate adenocarcinoma (26%) and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN; 12%) was higher for IF-RSP. We also found that lower International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) were associated with LSP, at 4.8 ± 3.2. Erectile function was reduced in IF-RSP patients in the first 6 months after surgery but was similar in all patient groups at 12 months after surgery; continence and other measured parameters were also similar at 12 months for all three techniques.  Conclusion:   The IF-RSP technique is safe and effective, with results at 1-year follow-up for continence, IPSS, and Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores similar to those for the LSP and RSP techniques. IF-RSP also offers the advantages that it does not require postoperative irrigation, has an increased ability to detect prostate cancer (CA) and HG-PIN, and avoids the risk of future cancer and subsequent reintervention for possible new prostate growth.""","""['Oscar Dario Martín Garzón', 'Raed A Azhar', 'Leonardo Brunacci', 'Nelson Emilio Ramirez-Troche', 'Luis Medina Navarro', 'Luis Cesar Hernández', 'Luciano Nuñez Bragayrac', 'René Javier Sotelo Noguera']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Laparoscopic simple prostatectomy versus robot-assisted simple prostatectomy for large benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative trials.', 'Open vs Laparoscopic Simple Prostatectomy: A Comparison of Initial Outcomes and Cost.', 'Robot-Assisted Versus Open Simple Prostatectomy for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Large Glands: A Propensity Score-Matched Comparison of Perioperative and Short-Term Outcomes.', 'Transvesical robotic simple prostatectomy: initial clinical experience.', 'Prostatectomy for benign prostate disease: open, laparoscopic and robotic techniques.', 'Robot-assisted simple prostatectomy for prostates greater than 100\xa0g.', 'Robotic assisted simple prostatectomy versus other treatment modalities for large benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of over 6500 cases.', 'Laparoscopic simple prostatectomy versus robot-assisted simple prostatectomy for large benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative trials.', 'From open simple to robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy (RASP) for large benign prostate hyperplasia: the time has come.', 'Endoscopic transvesical adenomectomy of the prostate, a new minimally invasive approach for large benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Objective:   To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ODM-201 tablet products and preliminary long-term safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of ODM-201 in chemotherapy-naive men with mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Thirty patients were enrolled in this open-label phase 1 trial. Patients received a single 600-mg dose of ODM-201 in capsules with food and one 600-mg dose of ODM-201 tablet product (TabA or TabB) with food and in the fasted state in a random order. In the extension, patients received 600mg twice daily ODM-201 taken with food in capsules.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We analyzed the pharmacokinetics of ODM-201 tablet formulations. Safety and tolerability were assessed until disease progression or an intolerable adverse event (AE). Antitumor activity was assessed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and imaging.  Results and limitations:   The capsule:TabA ratio of area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last sample at 48h was 1.06 (90% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.24); the capsule:TabB ratio was 0.97 (90% CI, 0.82-1.14). At week 12, 25 of 30 patients (83%) had a PSA response (≥50% reduction from baseline). Median time to radiographic progression was 66 wk (95% CI, 41-79). Most common AEs were fatigue (n=4 [13%]) and nausea (n=4 [13%]).  Conclusions:   The study showed that the tablet formulation of ODM-201 had similar pharmacokinetics compared with the capsule.

The purpose of this study was to compare organ-at-risk (OAR) dosimetry between hemigland (HG) and WG stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) plans.  Methods:   Volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy-based SBRT plans were designed to treat the left HG, right HG and WG in eight patients, using five fractions of 8 Gy. OARs of interest included the contralateral HG, rectum, urinary bladder, urethra, penile bulb and contralateral neurovascular bundle.  Results:   Rectal V80% (the percentage of a normal structure receiving a dose of 80%) and V90% were significantly lower with HG plans than with WG plans (median values of 4.4 vs 2.5 cm(3) and 2.1 vs 1.1 cm(3), respectively, p < 0.05 by Student's t-test). Bladder V50% was also reduced significantly in HG plans (32.3 vs 17.4 cm(3), p < 0.05), with a trend towards reduction of V100% (3.4 vs 1.3 cm(3), p = 0.09). Urethral maximum dose and mean doses to the penile bulb and contralateral neurovascular bundle were also reduced significantly (42.0 vs 39.7 Gy, p < 0.00001; 13.3 vs 9.2 Gy, p < 0.05; and 40.2 vs 19.3 Gy, p < 0.00001, respectively).  Conclusion:   Targeting an HG volume rather than a WG volume when delivering SBRT can offer statistically significant reductions for all OARs. Given the large magnitude of the reduction in dose to these OARs, it is anticipated that HG SBRT could offer a superior toxicity profile when compared with WG SBRT. This is likely to be most relevant in the context of salvaging a local failure after radiation therapy.  Advances in knowledge:   The dosimetric feasibility of HG SBRT is demonstrated. When compared with WG SBRT plans, the HG plans demonstrate statistically significant and large magnitude reduction in doses to the rectum, bladder, urethra, penile bulb and contralateral neurovascular bundle, suggesting the possibility of improved toxicity outcomes with HG SBRT.

Unlike MR images, kVCT does not provide precise information on target volume extension. Since neither kVCT nor MRI may be suitable for contouring in patients with ferrous hip prostheses, this study evaluated whether megavoltage CT (MVCT) reduced interobserver variability.  Methods:   Two patients without hip prostheses and one patient (Patient 3) with hip prostheses were enrolled. Six radiation oncologists contoured prostate, rectum and bladder on kVCT (Patients 1 and 3), MRI (Patient 2) and MVCT images (Patient 3). MVCT was acquired with fine, normal and coarse modalities. Interobserver variability for each organ was analysed using conformity index (CI) and coefficient of variation (CV).  Results:   In patients without hip prostheses, CIs were higher in prostate contouring with MRI than with kVCT, indicating lower interobserver variability with MRI. Very slight variations were seen in rectum and bladder contouring. In the patient with hip prostheses (Patient 3), contouring on kVCT lowered CI and increased CV in the prostate, bladder and rectum. The differences were more marked in the prostate. Only fine modality MVCT reduced interobserver variability and only for the prostate.  Conclusion:   Even though greater noise and less soft-tissue contrast increase contouring variability with MVCT than with kVCT, lack of artefacts on MVCT could provide better image definition by this modality in hip prosthesis patients in whom MRI is precluded.

Methods:   A total of 1473 cancer patients treated in the Tianjin Medical University General Hospital from 2009 to 201 were selected, including 845 males and 628 females in the age of 56 ± 17 years. The activities of von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), factor VII (F VII:A), factor VIII (F VIII:A), antithrombin (AT:A), protein C (PC:A) and protein S (PS:A) were assayed using an ACL TOP 700 blood coagulation analyzer. The level of D-dimer (D-D) was assayed using the Biomerieux Mini Vidas Automated Immunoassay Analyzer. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to analyze the diagnostic performance of the parameters. Cox regression analysis model was applied to evaluate the effect on prognosis, and Kaplan-Meier curve was used to implement the survival analysis.  Results:   The levels of vWF:Ag, D-D, and F VIII:A were significantly higher in all the specified tumor groups ( except the other tumor group ) than that of the control groups (P < 0.05). F VIII:A was significantly higher than that in the control group in all tumor groups except the renal carcinoma, prostatic cancer, lymphoma groups and the other tumor group (P < 0.05). The PC:A level was significantly lower in all tumor patients groups than in the control group, except glioma, breast cancer, gastric carcinoma, renal carcinoma and the other tumors groups (P < 0.05). The PS: A level was significantly lower in all tumor groups than in the control group, except the glioma, breast cancer, prostatic cancer, lymphoma and the other tumors groups (P<0.05). The AT: A level was significantly lower in all tumor groups than in the control group (P<0.05). When the optimum cut-off point of vWF:Ag for VTE diagnosis was 192% in the cancer group, the area under ROC curve = 0.828 (95% CI: 0.716 to 0.939). When the optimum cut-off point of D-dimer for VTE diagnosis was 1484 ng/ml in the cancer group, the area under ROC curve = 0.915 (95% confidence interval: 0. 840 to 0.988). When the optimum cut-off point of PC: A for VTE diagnosis was 75.2% in the cancer group, the area under ROC curve = 0.764 (95% confidence interval: 0.630 to 0.898). The Cox analysis showed that age, surgery, chemotherapy and D-dimer were independent risk factors for VTE event within three months in cancer patients. The cumulative probability of VTE was increased significantly in the cancer patients if whose plasma D-dimer level was over the cut-off value.  Conclusions:   The plasma D-dimer level is obviously increased in cancer patients, and there is a relevance to thrombosis risk stratification and VTE cumulative probability.

Unfortunately, current therapies are not curative for castration resistant PC and a better understanding of AR regulation could identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers to aid treatment of this disease. The AR is known to be regulated by a number of post-translational modifications and we have recently identified the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp12 as a positive regulator of AR. We determined that Usp12 deubiquitinates the AR resulting in elevated receptor stability and activity. Furthermore, Usp12 silencing was shown to reduce proliferation of PC cells.Usp12 is known to require the co-factors Uaf-1 and WDR20 for catalytic activity. In this report we focus further on the role of Uaf-1 and WDR20 in Usp12 regulation and investigate if these co-factors are also required for controlling AR activity. Firstly, we confirm the presence of the Usp12/Uaf-1/WDR20 complex in PC cells and demonstrate the importance of Uaf-1 and WDR20 for Usp12 stabilisation. Consequently, we show that individual silencing of either Uaf-1 or WDR20 is sufficient to abrogate the activity of the Usp12 complex and down-regulate AR-mediated transcription via receptor destabilisation resulting in increased apoptosis and decreased colony forming ability of PC cells.

Method:   Men and their wives (n = 64 couples) were randomly assigned to either the ET or UC group. Couples in the ET group engaged in partnered strength-training twice weekly for 6 months. Multilevel modeling was used to explore the effects of ET on husband and wife engagement in both affectionate and sexual behaviors over time.  Results:   Controlling for relationship quality, wives in ET showed significant increases in engagement in affectionate behaviors compared to wives in UC. No intervention effects were found for husbands.  Conclusion:   Couple-based approaches to physical intimacy, after a cancer diagnosis, that facilitate collaborative engagement in nonsexual physical activities for the couple have potential to be effective for wives.

Based on encouraging results from studies on benzophenone thiosemicarbazone cathepsin inhibitors, a series of fourteen benzoylbenzophenone thiosemicarbazone analogues were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against cathepsins L and B. Thiosemicarbazone inhibitors 3-benzoylbenzophenone thiosemicarbazone 1, 1,3-bis(4-fluorobenzoyl)benzene thiosemicarbazone 8, and 1,3-bis(2-fluorobenzoyl)-5-bromobenzene thiosemicarbazone 32 displayed the greatest potency against cathepsin L with low IC50 values of 9.9 nM, 14.4 nM, and 8.1 nM, respectively. The benzoylbenzophenone thiosemicarbazone analogues evaluated were selective in their inhibition of cathepsin L compared to cathepsin B. Thiosemicarbazone analogue 32 inhibited invasion through Matrigel of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by 70% at 10 μM. Thiosemicarbazone analogue 8 significantly inhibited the invasive potential of PC-3ML prostate cancer cells by 92% at 5 μM. The most active cathepsin L inhibitors from this benzoylbenzophenone thiosemicarbazone series (1, 8, and 32) displayed low cytotoxicity toward normal primary cells [in this case human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)]. In an initial in vivo study, 3-benzoylbenzophenone thiosemicarbazone (1) was well-tolerated in a CDF1 mouse model bearing an implanted C3H mammary carcinoma, and showed efficacy in tumor growth delay. Low cytotoxicity, inhibition of cell invasion, and in vivo tolerability are desirable characteristics for anti-metastatic agents functioning through an inhibition of cathepsin L.

Patients and methods:   A total of 431 patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent prostate brachytherapy (BT) with or without neoadjuvant CAB for ≥ 6 months with mean follow-up time of 64.6 months (range 24-108 months) were evaluated retrospectively. Of those 431, 232 patients received BT in combination with neoadjuvant CAB for ≥ 6 months. Biochemical recurrence-free rates (BRFRs) in 364 patients with at least 3 years of follow-up were evaluated by log-rank test.  Results:   BRFR in patients with low-, intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer were 98.1, 94.2 and 89.1%, respectively. In patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer only, neoadjuvant CAB was significantly associated with BRFR (p = 0.0468). Especially in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer with radiation dose received by 90% of the prostate (D90) < 180 Gy, neoadjuvant CAB exerted a favorable impact on BRFR (p = 0.0429). On multivariate analyses, neoadjuvant CAB and D90 were independent predictors of BRFR (p = 0.0061 and p < 0.0001, respectively).

The AR functions as a ligand dependent transcription factor which recruits multiple enzymatically distinct epigenetic coregulators to facilitate transcriptional regulation in response to androgens. Over-expression of AR coregulators is implicated in cancer. We have shown that over-expression of KDM1A, an AR coregulator, contributes to PCa recurrence by promoting VEGFA expression. However the mechanism(s) whereby AR coregulators are increased in PCa remain poorly understood. In this study we show that the microRNA hsa-miR-137 (miR137) tumor suppressor regulates expression of an extended network of transcriptional coregulators including KDM1A/LSD1/AOF1, KDM2A/JHDM1A/FBXL11, KDM4A/JMJD2A, KDM5B JARID1B/PLU1, KDM7A/JHDM1D/PHF8, MED1/TRAP220/DRIP205 and NCoA2/SRC2/TIF2. We show that expression of miR137 is increased by androgen in LnCaP androgen PCa responsive cells and that the miR137 locus is epigenetically silenced in androgen LnCaP:C4-2 and PC3 independent PCa cells. In addition, we found that restoration of miR137 expression down-regulates expression of VEGFA, an AR target gene, which suggests a role of miR137 loss also in cancer angiogenesis. Finally we show functional inhibition of miR137 function enhanced androgen induction of PSA/KLK3 expression. Our data indicate that miR137 functions as an androgen regulated suppressor of androgen signaling by modulating expression of an extended network of transcriptional coregulators. Therefore, we propose that epigenetic silencing of miR137 is an important event in promoting androgen signaling during prostate carcinogenesis and progression.""","""['Emeli M Nilsson', 'Kristian B Laursen', 'Jonathan Whitchurch', 'Andrew McWilliam', 'Niels Ødum', 'Jenny L Persson', 'David M Heery', 'Lorraine J Gudas', 'Nigel P Mongan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['KDM1A triggers androgen-induced miRNA transcription via H3K4me2 demethylation and DNA oxidation.', 'FOXP1 is an androgen-responsive transcription factor that negatively regulates androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Overexpression of lysine-specific demethylase 1 promotes androgen-independent transition of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells through activation of the AR signaling pathway and suppression of the p53 signaling pathway.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Prostate specific antigen gene regulation by androgen receptor.', 'Intratumoral Restoration of miR-137 Plus Cholesterol Favors Homeostasis of the miR-137/Coactivator p160/AR Axis and Negatively Modulates Tumor Progression in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'The KDM5B and KDM1A lysine demethylases cooperate in regulating androgen receptor expression and signalling in prostate cancer.', 'NOX Dependent ROS Generation and Cell Metabolism.', 'Exploring anti-androgen therapies in hormone dependent prostate cancer and new therapeutic routes for castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor and microRNA Interactions in Androgen-Dependent Diseases.']"""

Previously, we reported the ability of a small molecule compound, C1, to induce ROS dependent autophagy associated apoptosis in human cancer cell lines and primary tumor cells (Wong C. et al. 2010). Our ongoing investigations have unraveled a hitherto undefined novel signaling network involving hyper-phosphorylation of Akt and Akt-mediated ROS production in cancer cell lines. Interestingly, drug-induced Akt activation is selectively seen in cell lines that carry mutant KRAS; HCT116 cells that carry the V13D KRAS mutation respond favorably to C1 while HT29 cells expressing wild type KRAS are relatively resistant. Of note, not only does the compound target mutant KRAS expressing cells but also induces RAS activation as evidenced by the PAK pull down assay. Corroborating this, pharmacological inhibition as well as siRNA mediated silencing of KRAS or Akt, blocked C1-induced ROS production and rescued tumor colony forming ability in HCT116 cells. To further confirm the involvement of KRAS, we made use of mutant KRAS transformed RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells. Notably, drug-induced ROS generation and death sensitivity was significantly higher in RWPE-1-KRAS cells than the RWPE-1-vector cells, thus confirming the results obtained with mutant KRAS colorectal carcinoma cell line. Lastly, we made use of HCT116 mutant KRAS knockout cells (KO) where the mutant KRAS allele had been deleted, thus expressing a single wild-type KRAS allele. Exposure of the KO cells to C1 failed to induce Akt activation and mitochondrial ROS production. Taken together, results show the involvement of activated Akt in ROS-mediated selective targeting of mutant KRAS expressing tumors, which could have therapeutic implications given the paucity of chemotherapeutic strategies specifically targeting KRAS mutant cancers.""","""['Kartini Iskandar', 'Majidah Rezlan', 'Shazib Pervaiz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Synthetic Lethality of a Novel Small Molecule Against Mutant KRAS-Expressing Cancer Cells Involves AKT-Dependent ROS Production.', 'Knockdown of PAK4 or PAK1 inhibits the proliferation of mutant KRAS colon cancer cells independently of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling.', 'Adenoviral-mediated expression of a kinase-dead mutant of Akt induces apoptosis selectively in tumor cells and suppresses tumor growth in mice.', 'Sorafenib inhibits non-small cell lung cancer cell growth by targeting B-RAF in KRAS wild-type cells and C-RAF in KRAS mutant cells.', 'Screen for Inhibitors of STK33 Kinase Activity.', 'Physalin A induces G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in human non-small cell lung cancer cells: involvement of the p38 MAPK/ROS pathway.']"""

Methods and materials:   At the time of submission, 28 cancer patients (head and neck, pelvis, and prostate) undergoing fractionated external beam radiation therapy (24 IMRT, 4 VMAT) had ≥1 treatment fraction verified in real time (131 fractions or 881 fields). EPID images acquired continuously during treatment were synchronized and compared with model-generated transit EPID images within a frame time (∼0.1 s). A χ comparison was performed to cumulative frames to gauge the overall delivery quality, and the resulting pass rates were reported graphically during treatment delivery.

Here we present a comprehensive structural and computational study aimed at dissecting the importance of the effector function for GCPII binding and affinity. To this end we determined crystal structures of human GCPII in complex with a series of phosphoramidate-based inhibitors harboring effector functions of diverse physicochemical characteristics. Our data show that higher binding affinities of phosphoramidates, compared to matching phosphonates, are linked to the presence of additional hydrogen bonds between Glu424 and Gly518 of the enzyme and the amide group of the phosphoramidate. While the positioning of the P1' glutamate-derived module within the S1' pocket of GCPII is invariant, interaction interfaces between effector functions and residues lining the entrance funnel are highly varied, with the positively charged arginine patch defined by Arg463, Arg534 and Arg536 being the only 'hot-spot' common to several studied complexes. This variability stems in part from the fact that the effector/GCPII interfaces generally encompass isolated areas of nonpolar residues within the entrance funnel and resulting van der Waals contacts lack the directionality typical for hydrogen bonding interactions. The presented data unravel a complexity of binding modes of inhibitors within non-prime site(s) of GCPII and can be exploited for the design of novel GCPII-specific compounds.

These increased RR are radiation specific for lung and breast cancer but not for NHL; (3) AML latencies were brief compared to those of A-bomb survivors; and (4) there was a marked excess risk of acute promyelocytic leukemia in persons receiving radiation therapy.

We FACS-purified and transcriptionally profiled basal and luminal epithelial populations from the benign and cancerous regions of primary human prostates. High-throughput RNA sequencing showed the basal population to be defined by genes associated with stem cell signaling programs and invasiveness. Application of a 91-gene basal signature to gene expression datasets from patients with organ-confined or hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer revealed that metastatic small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma was molecularly more stem-like than either metastatic adenocarcinoma or organ-confined adenocarcinoma. Bioinformatic analysis of the basal cell and two human small cell gene signatures identified a set of E2F target genes common between prostate small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and primary prostate basal cells.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been useful in visualizing and localizing tumor candidates and with the use of endorectal coils (ERC), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved. The coils introduce intensity inhomogeneities and the surface coil intensity correction built into MRI scanners is used to reduce these inhomogeneities. However, the correction typically performed at the MRI scanner level leads to noise amplification and noise level variations.  Methods:   In this study, we introduce a new Monte Carlo-based noise compensation approach for coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI which allows for effective noise compensation and preservation of details within the prostate. The approach accounts for the ERC SNR profile via a spatially-adaptive noise model for correcting non-stationary noise variations. Such a method is useful particularly for improving the image quality of coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI data performed at the MRI scanner level and when the original raw data is not available.  Results:   SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) analysis in patient experiments demonstrate an average improvement of 11.7 and 11.2 dB respectively over uncorrected endorectal MRI, and provides strong performance when compared to existing approaches.  Discussion:   Experimental results using both phantom and patient data showed that ACER provided strong performance in terms of SNR, CNR, edge preservation, subjective scoring when compared to a number of existing approaches.  Conclusions:   A new noise compensation method was developed for the purpose of improving the quality of coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI data performed at the MRI scanner level. We illustrate that promising noise compensation performance can be achieved for the proposed approach, which is particularly important for processing coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI data performed at the MRI scanner level and when the original raw data is not available.""","""['Dorothy Lui', 'Amen Modhafar', 'Masoom A Haider', 'Alexander Wong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Med Imaging""","""['Noise-Compensated, Bias-Corrected Diffusion Weighted Endorectal Magnetic Resonance Imaging via a Stochastically Fully-Connected Joint Conditional Random Field Model.', 'Development and evaluation of a multichannel endorectal RF coil for prostate MRI at 7T in combination with an external surface array.', 'Monte Carlo bias field correction in endorectal diffusion imaging.', 'Prostate MRI: Is Endorectal Coil Necessary?-A Review.', 'Doctor, a patient is on the phone asking about the endorectal coil!', 'Quality Comparison of 3 Tesla multiparametric MRI of the prostate using a flexible surface receiver coil versus conventional surface coil plus endorectal coil setup.', 'Two-centre comparative experimental study of biparametric MRI at 3.0\u2009T with and without endorectal coil using kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) as a phantom for human prostate.', 'Partition Weighted Approach for Estimating the Marginal Posterior Density with Applications.']"""

The mainstay of urological follow-up is to ensure urine transport and voiding function; also, the diagnosis and treatment of urological malignancies following renal transplantats is growing in importance. As urological malignancies are one of the three most common tumors following renal transplantation (RT), meticulous and regular urological evaluation is a central part of follow-up care after RT.  Recommendations:   Urological evaluation following RT must ensure correct urine transport and voiding function. Transplant ureter strictures, relevant ureteral reflux and voiding dysfuntion (e.g., neurologic dysfunction, benign prostate hypeplasia) must be excluded or treated. Urinary tract infection (UTI), which can be life threatening in the immunosuppressed transplant recipient, must be diagnosed and treated consequently and for an adequate period of time. Prophylaxis of UTIs is indicated in patients with recurrent symptomatic UTI as well as in the initial 6 months following renal transplantation. Asymptomatic bacteriuria must not necessarily be treated. The incidence of urological malignancies like renal cell carcinoma, urothelial cancer of the bladder, and penile carcinoma is increased following RT, while the incidence of prostate and testis cancer is the same as in the nontransplant population. Surgical and nonsurgical treatment options do not differ from the normal population.

In addition, the expression of LMO1 in human PCa tissues was significantly higher than that in benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues. Moreover, LMO1 appeared to be a novel coactivator to enhance AR transcriptional activities, followed by the elevation of expression of P21 and PSA, downstream targets of AR.

Although tumors were consistently smaller in macrophage-depleted mice, paradoxical results of macrophage depletion on bone were observed. Histomorphometric and micro-CT analyses demonstrated that clodronate-treated mice had increased bone volume, while MAFIA mice had reduced bone volume.

Methods:   TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA) human ABC transporter plates were used for the gene expression profiling in 10 PCa and 6 NPT specimens.

Results:   Expression of eight ABC transporter genes (ABCA8, ABCB1, ABCC6, ABCC9, ABCC10, ABCD2, ABCG2, and ABCG4) was significantly down-regulated in PCa as compared to NPT, and only two genes (ABCC4 and ABCG1) were up-regulated. Down-regulation of ABC transporter genes was prevalent in the TMPRSS2-ERG-negative cases. A detailed analysis of ABCB1 expression confirmed TLDA results: a reduced level of the transcript was identified in PCa in comparison to NPT (p = 0.048). Moreover, the TMPRSS2-ERG-negative PCa cases showed significantly lower expression of ABCB1 in comparison to NPT (p = 0.003) or the fusion-positive tumors (p = 0.002).

Meta-analysis of these studies showed that an ELRP approach was associated with a significantly shorter postoperative catheterization time (MD: 1.99; 95% CI: 0.52 to 3.54; P = 0.008), less blood transfusion rate (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.03 to 4.06; P = 0.04), shorter intestinal function recovery time (MD: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.09; P < 0.0001) and shorter hospitalization days (MD: 2.71; 95% CI: 1.03 to 4.39; P = 0.002). In addition, our results showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups in operation time (MD: 19.39; 95% CI: -6.67 to 45.44; P = 0.014), intraoperative blood loss (MD: 4.89; 95% CI: -105.00 to 114.79; P = 0.93) and total complication rate (RR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.74; P = 0.27). In summary, our meta-analysis showed that ELRP is likely to be a safe and feasible alternative for localized PCa patients compared with TLRP.""","""['Cao De Hong', 'Liu Liang Ren', 'Wei Qiang', 'Wang Jia', 'Hu Ying Chun', 'Yang Lu', 'Liu Zheng Hua', 'Li Heng Ping', 'Yan Shi Bing', 'Li Yun Xiang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer: a meta analysis.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal approach in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A meta-analysis.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', 'Transperitoneal or extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: does the approach matter?', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of Perioperative, Functional, and Oncological Outcomes of Transperitoneal and Extraperitoneal Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'A comparison of perioperative outcome between robot-assisted and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: experience of a single institution.', 'Intrafascial versus interfascial nerve sparing in radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Shorter GGN Repeats in Androgen Receptor Gene Would Not Increase the Risk of Prostate Cancer.']"""

We aim to evaluate the safety, short-term functional and oncological outcomes of focal IRE in low-intermediate risk PCa.  Methods:   Between February 2013 and May 2014, 32 consecutive men underwent IRE at a single centre. Patients with low-intermediate risk PCa who had not received previous PCa treatment were included for analysis. The tumour was ablated using 3-6 electrodes, ensuring a minimum 5-mm safety margin around the visible magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion. Follow-up included recording Clavien complications, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaires (baseline, 1.5, 3, 6 months), 6-month multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) and 7-month biopsy. Findings on mp-MRI and biopsy were sub-divided into infield, adjacent or outfield of the treatment zone.  Results:   Twenty-five men were included for final analysis. Safety follow-up revealed one Clavien Grade 3 complication and five Grade 1 complications. Functional follow-up confirmed no significant change in American Urological Association urinary symptom score, sexual or bowel function. Infield, there were no suspicious findings on mp-MRI (n=24) or biopsy (n=21) in all patients. Adjacent to the treatment zone, five (21%) had suspicious findings on mp-MRI with four (19%) proving to be significant on biopsy. Outfield, there were two (8%) with suspicious findings on mp-MRI and one (5%) significant finding on biopsy. For the five patients with significant findings on follow-up biopsy, one is awaiting repeat IRE, one had radical prostatectomy and three remained on active surveillance.  Conclusions:   In selected patients with low-intermediate risk PCa, focal IRE appears to be safe with minimal morbidity. There were no infield recurrences and 76% of patients were histologically free of significant cancer at 8 months. Almost all recurrences were adjacent to the treatment zone, and this was addressed by widening the treatment margins.""","""['F Ting', 'M Tran', 'M Böhm', 'A Siriwardana', 'P J Van Leeuwen', 'A M Haynes', 'W Delprado', 'R Shnier', 'P D Stricker']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Feasibility and safety of focal irreversible electroporation as salvage treatment for localized radio-recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Focal irreversible electroporation as primary treatment for localized prostate cancer.', 'Preliminary Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Detect Residual Prostate Cancer Following Focal Therapy with Irreversible Electroporation.', 'Surveillance after prostate focal therapy.', 'Update on the ICUD-SIU consultation on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging in localised prostate cancer.', 'Real-Time and Delayed Imaging of Tissue and Effects of Prostate Tissue Ablation.', 'Narrative review-focal therapy: are we ready to change the prostate cancer treatment paradigm?', 'Boosting the Immune Response-Combining Local and Immune Therapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Extended Focal Ablation of Localized Prostate Cancer With High-Frequency Irreversible Electroporation: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.', 'Transforming Commercial Copper Sulfide into Injectable Hydrogels for Local Photothermal Therapy.']"""

Methods:   Men with localized PC treated with radical prostatectomy at the Durham VA Medical Center and whose prostatectomy tissues were included in a tissue microarray (TMA) linked to long-term outcomes. We performed immunohistochemical studies using validated antibodies against E-cadherin and Ki-67 and mesenchymal biomarkers including N-cadherin, vimentin, SNAIL, ZEB1 and TWIST. Association studies were conducted for each biomarker with baseline clinical/pathologic characteristics an risk of PSA recurrence over time.  Results:   Two hundred and five men contributed TMA tissue and had long-term follow-up (median 11 years). Forty-three percent had PSA recurrence; three died of PC. The majority had high E-cadherin expression (86%); 14% had low/absent E-cadherin expression. N-cadherin was rarely expressed (<4%) and we were unable to identify an E-to-N-cadherin switch as independently prognostic. No associations with clinical risk group, PSA recurrence or Gleason sum were noted for SNAIL, ZEB1, vimentin or TWIST, despite heterogeneous expression between patients.

The chemo-preventive role of SFN is associated with its histone de-acetylase inhibitor activity. However, the effect of SFN on chromatin composition and dynamic folding, especially in relation to HDAC inhibitor activity, remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that SFN can inhibit the expression and activity of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, in 2 prostate cancer cell lines. This decrease in gene expression is correlated with SFN-induced changes in chromatin structure and composition. The SFN-mediated changes in levels of histone post-translational modifications, more specifically acetylation of histone H3 lysine 18 and di-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4, 2 modifications linked with high risk of prostate cancer recurrence, were associated with regulatory elements within the hTERT promoter region. Chromatin condensation may also play a role in SFN-mediated hTERT repression, since expression and recruitment of MeCP2, a known chromatin compactor, were altered in SFN treated prostate cancer cells. Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) of MeCP2 showed enrichment over regions of the hTERT promoter with increased nucleosome density. These combined results strongly support a role for SFN in the mediation of epigenetic events leading to the repression of hTERT in prostate cancer cells. This ability of SFN to modify chromatin composition and structure associated with target gene expression provides a new model by which dietary phytochemicals may exert their chemoprevention activity.""","""['Ata Abbas', 'J Adam Hall', 'William L Patterson rd', 'Emily Ho', 'Anna Hsu', 'Fahd Al-Mulla', 'Philippe T Georgel']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Sulforaphane causes epigenetic repression of hTERT expression in human breast cancer cell lines.', 'Mechanisms for the Inhibition of Colon Cancer Cells by Sulforaphane through Epigenetic Modulation of MicroRNA-21 and Human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT) Down-regulation.', 'Differential effects of sulforaphane on histone deacetylases, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in normal prostate cells versus hyperplastic and cancerous prostate cells.', 'Dietary histone deacetylase inhibitors: from cells to mice to man.', 'Modulation of histone deacetylase activity by dietary isothiocyanates and allyl sulfides: studies with sulforaphane and garlic organosulfur compounds.', 'Prospective Epigenetic Actions of Organo-Sulfur Compounds against Cancer: Perspectives and Molecular Mechanisms.', 'The Anticancer Potential of Plant-Derived Nutraceuticals via the Modulation of Gene Expression.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.', 'Role of Flavonoids as Epigenetic Modulators in Cancer Prevention and Therapy.', 'Sulforaphane: A Broccoli Bioactive Phytocompound with Cancer Preventive Potential.']"""

The tumor‑bearing nude mice were divided into three groups: The USMB+RFA group was treated with USMB immediately followed by RFA, the RFA group was treated with RFA alone, and the control group remained untreated. The animals underwent enhanced US to calculate the tumor volumes, ablation volumes and ablation rates. Subsequently, the tumors were excised for hematoxylin and eosin staining, to identify necrosis in the tumors following the treatments, and immunohistochemical staining, to analyze the apoptotic index (AI), proliferative index (PI) and microvessel density (MVD) at 1, 4 and 7 days post-treatment. Each group contained five mice at each time‑point. Necrosis was apparent in the center of the tumors in the treatment groups. Ablation lesion volumes of the USMB+RFA group were larger than those in the RFA group at 1 and 4 days post‑treatment (P=0.002 and P=0.022, respectively), and the ablation rates of the USMB+RFA group were significantly higher, compared with the RFA group at the three time‑points (all P<0.001). There were fewer apoptotic cells and more proliferative cells in the RFA group, compared with the control group 1,4 and 7 days post‑treatment (all P<0.05). The AI of the USMB+RFA group was higher than that of the control group and lower than that of the RFA group 1 day post-treatment (P=0.034 and P=0.016, respectively). The PI of the USMB+RFA group was lower than that of the control group and higher than that of the RFA group 4 and 7 days post-treatment (all P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in MVD among the three groups throughout the experiment.

The biochemical recurrence-free survival was calculated by using the Phoenix criterion (PSA>nadir+2 ng/mL). The functional complications were assessed clinically and through standardised questionnaires.  Results:   The condition of 191 patients was assessed at a mean follow-up of 55.5 ± 22.7 months. In 10,1% of the treatments, an incident during the medical procedure was observed with the volume of the prostate (P=0.026) as risk factor. The overall survival, the survival and the metastatic free survival rate were respectively 89.5%, 98.4% and 97.4%. The biochemical free survival rate for 5 years was 87.5%, 69% and 39% respectively for the low, medium and high-risk groups of d'Amico classification. Eighty-six percent of the patients with a PSA nadir ≤ 0.3 ng/mL were relapse free at 5 years. Whereas only 48% of the patients with a nadir>0.3 ng/mL did not. Only 17.8% of the patients had a rescue treatment with an average delay of 31.1 months. The urinary and sexual impairment was significant but 78.1% of the patients were dry at the end of the study. The most common complication found in 18.3% of the patients was the prostatic obstruction.

Methods:   A collective of prostate cancer and head-and-neck cancer patients treated at our institution during the year 2013 was retrospectively analyzed. For all treatment fractions (3078 in total), the kind of acquired set-up image and the performed couch shift before treatment were assessed. The distribution of couch corrections was compared for three different imaging systems available at our institution: the treatment beam line operating at 6 MV, a dedicated imaging beam line of nominally 1 MV, and the kVision system at 70-121 kV. Shifts were analyzed for planar and cone-beam CT images. Based on the set-up corrections, CTV to PTV expansion margins were calculated.  Results:   The difference in set-up corrections performed for the three energies and both techniques (planar vs. CBCT) was not significant for head-and-neck cancer patients. For prostate cancer all shifts had equal variance. Averages ranged from -0.7 to +0.7 mm.

Cancer data for indigenous people are scarce and incidence has not previously been collectively reported in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the USA. We aimed to investigate and compare, for the first time, the cancer burden in indigenous populations in these countries.  Methods:   We derived incidence data from population-based cancer registries in three states of Australia (Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory), New Zealand, the province of Alberta in Canada, and the Contract Health Service Delivery Areas of the USA. Summary rates for First Nations and Inuit in Alberta, Canada, were provided directly by Alberta Health Services. We compared age-standardised rates by registry, sex, cancer site, and ethnicity for all incident cancer cases, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, diagnosed between 2002 and 2006. Standardised rate ratios (SRRs) and 95% CIs were computed to compare the indigenous and non-indigenous populations of each jurisdiction, except for the Alaska Native population, which was compared with the white population from the USA.  Findings:   We included 24 815 cases of cancer in indigenous people and 5 685 264 in non-indigenous people from all jurisdictions, not including Alberta, Canada. The overall cancer burden in indigenous populations was substantially lower in the USA except in Alaska, similar or slightly lower in Australia and Canada, and higher in New Zealand compared with their non-indigenous counterparts. Among the most commonly occurring cancers in indigenous men were lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer. In most jurisdictions, breast cancer was the most common cancer in women followed by lung and colorectal cancer. The incidence of lung cancer was higher in indigenous men in all Australian regions, in Alberta, and in US Alaska Natives than in their non-indigenous counterparts. For breast cancer, rates in women were lower in all indigenous populations except in New Zealand (SRR 1·23, CI 95% 1·16-1·32) and Alaska (1·14, 1·01-1·30). Incidence of cervical cancer was higher in indigenous women than in non-indigenous women in most jurisdictions, although the difference was not always statistically significant.  Interpretation:   There are clear differences in the scale and profile of cancer in indigenous and non-indigenous populations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the USA. Our findings highlight the need for much-improved, targeted programmes of screening, vaccination, and smoking cessation, among other prevention strategies. Governments and researchers need to work in partnership with indigenous communities to improve cancer surveillance in all jurisdictions and facilitate access to cancer data.

Materials and methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we studied 11,604 men with clinical T3N0M0 PCa from 1998 to 2012, with treatment categorized as radiation, radical prostatectomy (RP), or no curative therapy. We calculated rate of treatment type by year of diagnosis to investigate trends in treatment patterns, further stratifying by clinical T3a, defined as unilateral and bilateral extracapsular extension (n = 3,842), vs. T3b (defined as extension to seminal vesicles (n = 3,665). Finally, a multivariable logistic regression analysis measured association of demographic and clinical variables with type of treatment received for years 2010 to 2011.  Results:   Rates of prostatectomy increased significantly from 1998 to 2012 (12.5% vs. 44.4%), radiation decreased significantly (55.8% vs. 38.4%), and receipt of no treatment also decreased (31.7% vs. 17.2%, all P<0.001). These trends were similar for clinical T3a and T3b. Rates of prostatectomy surpassed radiation by 2008 in clinical T3a, reaching 49.8% vs. 37.1%, respectively, in 2012 (P = 0.002), and were statistically similar to radiation in 2012 for clinical T3b, reaching 41.6% vs. 42.1% (P = 0.92). Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that patients were less likely to receive prostatectomy than radiation if biopsy Gleason scores of 8 to 10 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.41, 0.32-0.53), higher initial prostate-specific antigen (AOR = 0.97, 0.97-0.98), and older age (AOR = 0.92, 0.90-0.03, all P<0.01). The likelihood of RP was similar among cT3b vs. cT3a (AOR = 0.95, 0.71-1.26, P = 0.74).

At the end of 7 cycles of therapy in 55 patients, an undetectable PSA was achieved in 31%. However, the combination did not meet the pre-specified level of activity for further development.  Background:   We conducted a phase II study in men with castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer to test the hypothesis that AT-101, a small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, has clinical activity in patients initiating androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for metastatic prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Patients with metastatic prostate cancer scheduled to start, or who had recently (within 6 weeks) initiated, ADT were enrolled. ADT with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide was started 6 weeks before initiation of oral AT-101, 20 mg/day for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint of the study was the percentage of patients with an undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (≤ 0.2 ng/mL) after 7.5 months (1.5 months of ADT alone plus 6 months of combined ADT and AT-101). To assess for an association between chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (CHD1) and drug sensitivity, fluorescence in situ hybridization with confocal microscopy was assessed in a subgroup of patients.  Results:   A total of 55 patients were enrolled, with median age of 61 years and a median PSA level of 27.6 ng/dL. Of the 55 patients, 72% had a Gleason score ≥ 8. Three patients had visceral metastases, and the remaining patients had bone or nodal metastasis. An undetectable PSA level was achieved in 31% of the patients. Of the 31 patients, 12 experienced serious adverse events, 7 of which were considered related to study therapy. Most of the related adverse events were gastrointestinal and nervous system disorders.

Materials and methods:   Urinary symptoms (dysuria, haematuria, incontinence and frequency) from 754 participants from TROG 03.04-RADAR trial were analysed. Relative (R1-R75 Gy) and absolute (A60-A75Gy) bladder dose-surface area receiving more than a threshold dose and equivalent uniform dose using exponent a (range: a ∈[1 … 100]) were derived. The dose-symptom correlates were analysed using; peak-symptom (logistic), multiple-event (generalised estimating equation) and event-count (negative binomial regression) models.  Results:   Stronger dose-symptom correlates were found for incontinence and frequency using multiple-event and/or event-count models. For dysuria and haematuria, similar or better relationships were found using peak-symptom models. Dysuria, haematuria and high grade (⩾ 2) incontinence were associated to high dose (R61-R71 Gy). Frequency and low grade (⩾ 1) incontinence were associated to low and intermediate dose-surface parameters (R13-R41Gy). Frequency showed a parallel behaviour (a=1) while dysuria, haematuria and incontinence showed a more serial behaviour (a=4 to a ⩾ 100). Relative dose-surface showed stronger dose-symptom associations.  Conclusions:   For certain endpoints, the multiple-event and event-count models provide stronger correlates over peak-symptom models.

Materials and methods:   There were 2211 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with RT from 1988 to 2008 at our institution. There were 991 patients (44.8%) who received ADT at the time of RT for a median of 6.1 months. Salvage ADT was initiated prior to CE in 365 men (16.5%) at a median of 5.5 years (range: 0.6 to 18.4 years) after RT and continued for a median of 4.3 years. A nomogram was constructed to predict the 10-year risk of CE ""post-RT"" (i.e., after RT).  Results:   Patients receiving ADT at the time of RT exhibited significantly higher 10-year incidence of CE (19.6%, 95% CI 17.0%-22.6%) than those not receiving ADT (14.3%, 95% CI 12.2%-16.7%, P = .005). On multivariate analysis, both ADT at the time of RT (P = .007) and the time of salvage (P = .0004) were associated with increased CE risk, as were advanced age (P = .02), smoking (P = .0007), history of diabetes (P = .0007), and history of CE before RT (P < .0001). A nomogram using patient age, smoking status, history of pre-RT CE, history of diabetes, and ADT use at the time of RT predicted the rate of 10-year CE with a C-index of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.88).

However, quercetin suffers from poor metabolic stability, which appears to offset its pharmacological efficacy. Recently, we isolated quercetin-6-C-β-D-glucopyranoside (QCG) from Ulmus wallichiana planchon that has greater stability profile over quercetin. In the present study, the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of QCG on prostate cancer cells were assessed. QCG inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation by arresting cells at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and induces apoptosis as evident from cytochrome c release, cleavage of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.

We evaluated whether global hypomethylation, measured through LINE-1 methylation, and GSTP1 hypermethylation on a negative biopsy are associated with subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis.  Experimental design:   We performed a case-control study nested in an unselected series of 737 men who received at least two prostate biopsies at least three months apart at the Molinette Hospital (Turin, Italy). Two pathology wards were included for replication purposes. The study included 67 cases and 62 controls in Ward 1 and 62 cases and 66 controls in Ward 2. We used pyrosequencing to analyze LINE-1 and GSTP1 methylation in the negative biopsies. Odds ratios (OR) of prostate cancer diagnosis were estimated using conditional logistic regression.  Results:   After mutual adjustment, GSTP1 hypermethylation was associated with an OR of prostate cancer diagnosis of 5.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.7-14.9) in Ward 1 and 2.0 (0.8-5.3) in Ward 2, whereas an association was suggested only for low LINE-1 methylation levels (<70% vs. 70%-74%) with an OR of 2.1 (0.5-9.1) in Ward 1 and 1.6 (0.4-6.1) in Ward 2. When the two wards were combined the association was stronger for tumors with Gleason score ≥ 4+3 [GSTP1 hypermethylation: 9.2 (2.0-43.1); LINE-1 (<70% vs. 70%-74%): 9.2 (1.4-59.3)]. GSTP-1 alone improved the predictive capability of the model (P = 0.007).

Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have very limited treatment options, with docetaxel as the first-line standard of care, for which resistance to this chemotherapeutic ultimately develops. Therefore, finding ways to sensitize tumors to chemotherapies and to limit chemoresistance provides a viable strategy to extend the survival of mCRPC patients. This study investigated the role of Kindlin-2 (FERMT2/K2), a member of the Kindlin family of FERM domain proteins and key regulators of the adhesive functions mediated by integrin, in the sensitization of mCRPC to chemotherapeutics. Loss of K2, which is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells derived from mCRPC tumors, compared with those cells derived from androgen-dependent tumors, significantly enhanced apoptosis and cell death of docetaxel-treated PC3 cells. Furthermore, it was determined that K2-mediated sensitization to docetaxel treatment is the result of inhibition of β1-integrin signaling. Finally, miR-138 specifically targeted K2 and inhibited its expression, thereby regulating a miR-138/K2/β1-integrin signaling axis in mCRPC that is critical for the modulation of sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. Thus, these data identify a novel signaling axis where K2 in combination with chemotherapeutics provides a new target for the treatment of mCRPC.  Implications:   Targeted inhibition of Kindlin-2 in combination with chemotherapy represents an effective treatment option for mCRPC.""","""['Khalid Sossey-Alaoui', 'Edward F Plow']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer is associated with androgen receptor activation and loss of KDM5D expression.', 'Silencing of miR-193a-5p increases the chemosensitivity of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.', 'Systemic therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Taxane-based Combination Therapies for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Kindlins as modulators of breast cancer progression.', 'circCYP24A1 promotes Docetaxel resistance in prostate Cancer by Upregulating ALDH1A3.', 'Targeted Deletion of Kindlin-2 in Mouse Mammary Glands Inhibits Tumor Growth, Invasion, and Metastasis Downstream of a TGF-β/EGF Oncogenic Signaling Pathway.', 'The roles of integrins in cancer.', 'Role of noncoding RNA in drug resistance of prostate cancer.']"""

Although studies regarding the EMT mechanisms are usual in terms of gene expression and protein functions, little is known about the involvement of lipids in EMT. In this work, an untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed to reveal which lipids are involved in the EMT process. DU145 prostate cancer cells were treated with TNFα, a well-known EMT inducer. After 6 hours of treatment, a decrease of cell membrane E-cadherin as well as a reduction in its gene expression were observed. Also, the mesenchymal markers Vimentin and Snail were up-regulated, suggesting that EMT started below 6 hours of treatment. Lipid extracts of untreated and TNFα-treated cells at short times were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Multivariate data analysis methods were applied to decipher which lipids presented significant changes after EMT induction. Among the results obtained, a significant increase of twelve unsaturated triacylglycerides (TAGs) was observed. This increase of TAGs was also observed for cells treated with TGFβ (another EMT inducer), suggesting that this feature is a common mechanism in the EMT process. In conclusion, this work reported for the first time a TAG accumulation through EMT induction.

Targeting AR axis is a standard strategy for prostate cancer treatment; however, the role of AR in autophagic processes is still not fully understood. In the present study, we found that AR played a negative role in AR degrader celastrol-induced autophagy. Knockdown of AR in AR-positive prostate cancer cells resulted in enhanced autophagy. Ectopic expression of AR in AR-negative prostate cancer cells, or gain of function of the AR signaling in AR-positive cells, led to suppression of autophagy. Since miR-101 is an inhibitor of autophagy and its expression was decreased along with AR in the process of celastrol-induced autophagy, we hypothesize that AR inhibits autophagy through transactivation of miR-101. AR binding site was defined in the upstream of miR-101 gene by luciferase reporter and ChIP assays. MiR-101 expression correlated with AR status in prostate cancer cell lines. The inhibition of celastrol-induced autophagy by AR was compromised by blocking miR-101; while transfection of miR-101 led to inhibition of celastrol-induced autophagy in spite of AR depletion. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the AR binding site in miR-101 gene led to decreased suppression of autophagy by AR. Finally, autophagy inhibition by miR-101 mimic was found to enhance the cytotoxic effect of celastrol in prostate cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that AR inhibits autophagy via transactivation of miR-101, thus combination of miR-101 mimics with celastrol may represent a promising therapeutic approach for treating prostate cancer.""","""['Jianquan Guo', 'Xuemei Huang', 'Hui Wang', 'Huanjie Yang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Autophagy in the pharmacological activities of celastrol (Review).', 'Downregulation of miR-17-92a cluster promotes autophagy induction in response to celastrol treatment in prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA let-7c suppresses androgen receptor expression and activity via regulation of Myc expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Celastrol suppresses tumor cell growth through targeting an AR-ERG-NF-κB pathway in TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene expressing prostate cancer.', 'Celastrol as an emerging anticancer agent: Current status, challenges and therapeutic strategies.', 'Autophagy in the pharmacological activities of celastrol (Review).', 'Autophagic mechanisms in longevity intervention: role of natural active compounds.', 'Recent advance of herbal medicines in cancer- a molecular approach.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Celastrol Downmodulates Alpha-Synuclein-Specific T Cell Responses by Mediating Antigen Trafficking in Dendritic Cells.']"""

However, despite initial promising reports, the broad application of this aptamer delivery technology awaits the development of methods that can verify and confirm delivery of aptamers to the cytoplasm of target cells where the RNAi machinery resides. We recently developed a functional assay (RIP assay) to confirm cellular uptake and subsequent cytoplasmic release of an RNA aptamer which binds to a cell surface receptor expressed on prostate cancer cells (PSMA). To assess cytoplasmic delivery, the aptamer was chemically conjugated to saporin, a ribosome inactivating protein toxin that is toxic to cells only when delivered to the cytoplasm (where it inhibits the ribosome) by a cell-targeting ligand (e.g., aptamer). Here, we describe the chemistry used to conjugate the aptamer to saporin and discuss a gel-based method to verify conjugation efficiency. We also detail an in vitro functional assay to confirm that the aptamer retains function following conjugation to saporin and describe a cellular assay to measure aptamer-mediated saporin-induced cytotoxicity.""","""['David D Dickey', 'Gregory S Thomas', 'Justin P Dassie', 'Paloma H Giangrande']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Cell-internalization SELEX: method for identifying cell-internalizing RNA aptamers for delivering siRNAs to target cells.', 'Dual-aptamer-based delivery vehicle of doxorubicin to both PSMA (+) and PSMA (-) prostate cancers.', 'A RNA-DNA Hybrid Aptamer for Nanoparticle-Based Prostate Tumor Targeted Drug Delivery.', 'Advance in the study of targeting delivery system for siRNA mediated by aptamers.', 'Cell-targeting aptamers act as intracellular delivery vehicles.', 'Streptavidin-Saporin: Converting Biotinylated Materials into Targeted Toxins.', 'Modular cell-internalizing aptamer nanostructure enables targeted delivery of large functional RNAs in cancer cell lines.', 'Selection and Identification of Skeletal-Muscle-Targeted RNA Aptamers.', 'Structural computational modeling of RNA aptamers.']"""

Our results demonstrate this set of flexible PAMAM dendrimers are indeed safe and effective nonviral vectors for SiRNA delivery and hold great promise for further applications in functional genomics and RNAi-based therapies.""","""['Xiaoxuan Liu', 'Ling Peng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Arginine-terminated generation 4 PAMAM dendrimer as an effective nanovector for functional siRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo.', 'Impact of siRNA overhangs for dendrimer-mediated siRNA delivery and gene silencing.', 'Structurally flexible triethanolamine-core poly(amidoamine) dendrimers as effective nanovectors to deliver RNAi-based therapeutics.', 'A Dual Targeting Dendrimer-Mediated siRNA Delivery System for Effective Gene Silencing in Cancer Therapy.', 'Poly (amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer mediated delivery of drug and pDNA/siRNA for cancer therapy.', 'Pro-Inflammatory Versus Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Dendrimers: The Two Faces of Immuno-Modulatory Nanoparticles.', 'Current Progress in Non-viral RNAi-Based Delivery Strategies to Lymphocytes.', 'In Vivo Bio-distribution and Efficient Tumor Targeting of Gelatin/Silica Nanoparticles for Gene Delivery.']"""

These intense cell stressors trigger a protective cell survival mechanism heralded by the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is induced by an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following cell starvation. Although the ER stress response is implicated in cytoprotection, its precise role during anti-angiogenic therapy remains unclear. One of the major proteins involved in ER stress is glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), which binds to unfolded proteins and dissociates from membrane-bound ER stress sensors. To determine the role of ER stress responses during anti-angiogenic therapy and the potential role of GRP78 in combined therapy in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), we used GRP78 overexpressing or knockdown RCC cells under hypoxic or hypoglycemic conditions in vitro and in animal models treated with sunitinib. Here, we report that GRP78 plays a crucial role in protecting RCC cells from hypoxic and hypoglycemic stress induced by anti-angiogenic therapy. Knockdown of GRP78 using siRNA inhibited cancer cell survival and induced apoptosis in RCC cells in vitro and also resulted in ER stress-induced apoptosis and hypoxic/hypoglycemic stress-induced apoptosis by inactivating the PERK/eIF-2α pathway. Finally, GRP78 knockdown showed potent suppression of tumor growth and enhanced the antitumor effect of sunitinib in RCC xenografts. Our findings suggest that GRP78 may serve as a novel therapeutic target in combination with anti-angiogenic therapy for the management of RCC.""","""['Kyung Seok Han', 'Na Li', 'Pater A Raven', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Sebastian Frees', 'Susan Ettinger', 'Ki Chung Park', 'Sung Joon Hong', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Alan I So']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['EIF3D promotes sunitinib resistance of renal cell carcinoma by interacting with GRP78 and inhibiting its degradation.', 'Protein kinase CK2 protects multiple myeloma cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis and from the cytotoxic effect of HSP90 inhibition through regulation of the unfolded protein response.', 'Mammalian ECD Protein Is a Novel Negative Regulator of the PERK Arm of the Unfolded Protein Response.', 'ER stress, hypoxia tolerance and tumor progression.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response in gliomagenesis, tumor progression and as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Association between diabetes and cancer.

We sought to compare short-term outcomes for pain and morbidity after RALP with SPT vs UC drainage.  Methods:   Between August 2012 and 2014, 159 men underwent a RALP and prospectively completed a questionnaire addressing postoperative pain and satisfaction. Group 1 (n = 94) underwent a RALP by one surgeon who placed a UC and removed it between postoperative day (POD) 7 and 10. Group 2 (n = 65) underwent a RALP by a different surgeon who placed an SPT and UC. On POD 1, the UC was removed. On POD 9, the SPT was capped and removed on POD 11 if the patient was voiding adequately. Preoperative and intraoperative data, complications, questionnaires, and patient-reported morbidity, including unplanned telephone calls and emergency department (ED) visits, were compared between groups.  Results:   Patient characteristics were similar between groups. One week after surgery, the penile pain score was statistically significantly lower in Group 2 compared to Group 1 (56.9% and 79.8%, respectively, reported minimal-to-moderate pain, p = 0.003). Bladder spasms and overall pain were not significantly higher for Group 1 compared to Group 2 (p > 0.05). When asked ""How big a problem has your urine storage device been?,"" 20.2% of patients in Group 1 reported it as a ""moderate-to-big"" problem compared to 10.8% in Group 2 (p > 0.05). The number of catheter-related unplanned telephone encounters did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.7), however, although not statistically significant, 4.6% of patients in Group 2 presented to the ED with catheter-related issues (p = 0.07).

In parallel, an in silico model was developed to substantiate the ANN simulations. The ANN model with modified sigmoid function was used for disease prediction, whereas the hyperbolic tangent function was used to predict folate hydrolase 1 (FOLH1) and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression. PyMOL models of GCPII variants were developed, and their affinity toward the folylpolyglutamate (FPG) ligand was tested using glide score analysis. Of the eight genetic variants of GCPII, p.P160S alone conferred protection against both of the cancers. This variant exhibited higher affinity toward FPG compared with wild GCPII (-2.06 vs. -1.69); and positive correlation was observed between the P160S variant and circulating folate (r = 0.60). The ANN model for disease prediction showed significant predictability associated with GCPII variants toward breast cancer (area under the curve (AUC): 1.00) and prostate cancer (AUC: 0.97), with clear distinguishing ability of healthy controls (AUC: 0.96). The ANN models for the expression of FOLH1 and PSMA explained 60.5% and 86.7% of the variability, respectively.

Materials and methods:   Data from 10,323 patients with prostate cancer (PCa), who had radical prostatectomy between 1998 and 2012, were analyzed regarding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and age at diagnosis, T stage, and Gleason score. A trend over time was determined by using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test.  Results:   Median age at surgery was 65 years (1998: 63.7; 2012: 66.5). The proportion of low-risk tumors decreased from 39% in 2005 to 25% in 2012, while the intermediate-risk tumors showed a continuous increase since 1998 from 35 to 52% in 2012. The proportion of patients with a Gleason score ≤ 6 decreased from 60% in 1998 to 25 % in 2012. The Gleason score groups 7a and 7b, however, increased from 12 to 46, % and 12 to 19%, respectively. The proportion of tumors with a Gleason score of 8-10 decreased from 16 to 10%. The proportion of organ-confined prostate cancer increased from 1998 to 2007 continuously from 57 to 73%. Since 2007 the proportion dropped to 64%.  Conclusions:   In this national population a trend towards inverse stage migration can be noted. Both the increase in Gleason score ≥ 6 and intermediate-risk tumors can be explained by the modification of the Gleason score. The tendency towards higher age and nonorgan-confined cancers at surgery could be dependent of the growing recognition of radical prostatectomy as a treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer, on the one hand, and the increase of alternative treatments for low-risk cancers, on the other hand.""","""['A Walther', 'M Kron', 'T Klorek', 'J E Gschwend', 'K Herkommer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Histopathological prostate cancer characteristics at radical prostatectomy after population based screening.', 'Under staging and under grading in a contemporary series of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: results from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor database.', 'Improved risk stratification for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy using a novel risk group system based on prostate specific antigen density and biopsy Gleason score.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Prospective evaluation of men with stage T1C adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Radical prostatectomy in locally advanced prostate cancer.']"""

In all cases, exfoliated urinary cells from half of the urine sample underwent immunocytochemical assessment for ERG protein expression. Exfoliated cells in the remaining half underwent assessment of TMPRSS2:ERG status using either nested reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR (151 cases) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; eight cases). Corresponding tissue samples were evaluated using FISH to determine chromosomal gene fusion tissue status and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine ERG protein expression. Results were correlated with clinicopathological variables.  Results:   The sensitivity and specificity of urinary ERG immunocytochemistry (ICC) for PCa were 22.7 and 100%, respectively. ERG ICC results correlated with advanced tumour grade, stage and higher serum PSA. In comparison, urine TMPRSS2:ERG transcript analysis had 27% sensitivity and 98% specificity for PCa detection. On tissue IHC, ERG staining was highly specific for PCa. In all, 52% of cancers harboured foci of ERG staining; however, only 46% of cancers that were found to have ERG overexpression were positive on urine ICC.

We hypothesized that pretreatment DAB2IP reduction would predict worse prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS). Immunohistochemistry of pretreatment biopsies was scored by an expert genitourinary pathologist. Other endpoints analyzed include freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), castration resistance-free survival (CRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Seventy-nine patients with NCCN-defined high-risk prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy from 2005 to 2012 at our institution were evaluated. Twenty-eight percent (22/79) of pretreatment biopsies revealed DAB2IP-reduction. The median follow up times were 4.8 years and 5.3 years for patients in the DAB2IP-reduced group and DAB2IP-retained group, respectively. Patients with reduced DAB2IP demonstrated worse outcome compared to patients retaining DAB2IP, including FFBF (4-year: 34 vs. 92%; P < 0.0001), CRFS (4-year: 58 vs. 96%; P = 0.0039), DMFS (4-year: 58 vs. 100%; P = 0.0006), and PCSS (5-year: 83 vs. 100%; P = 0.0102). Univariate analysis showed T stage, N stage, and Gleason score were statistically significant variables. Pretreatment tumor DAB2IP status remained significant in multivariable analyses. This study suggests that about one-fourth of men with high-risk prostate cancer have decreased tumor expression of DAB2IP. This subpopulation with reduced DAB2IP has a suboptimal response and worse malignancy-specific survival following radiation therapy and androgen deprivation.

NLR was calculated by prebiopsy neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. We excluded patients who had evidence of acute prostatitis, a history of prostate surgery, and any systemic inflammatory disease. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze prostate cancer detection. After adjusting for confounding factors, predictive values were determined according to the receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve, both including and excluding the NLR variable. In univariate analyses, NLR was a significant predictor of prostate cancer detection (P < 0.001). In multivariate analyses, a higher NLR was significantly associated with prostate cancer detection after adjusting for other factors (OR = 1.372, P= 0.038). The addition of NLR increased the accuracy from 0.712 to 0.725 (P = 0.005) in the multivariate model for prostate cancer detection.

Research approach:   Multiple case study design embedded in a larger randomized, controlled trial of a nurse-led patient navigation intervention. .  Setting:   Community-based research conducted via in-home visits and by phone with participants residing in non-metropolitan areas of a mid-Atlantic state.   Participants:   Rural-dwelling adults aged 60 years or older with early-stage breast or prostate cancer and the people who support them (11 dyads).   Methodologic approach:   An approach to grounded theory analysis was used to evaluate the fit between existing theoretical knowledge and case findings and to generate new knowledge about the cancer recovery process.   Findings:   Working toward normalcy was a core process of cancer recovery prompted by participants' internal experiences and external interactions with their environments. This ongoing, iterative, and active process involved multiple concurrent strategies that were not necessarily medically oriented or cancer specific. Working toward normalcy resulted in movement along a continuum of self-appraisal anchored between participants experiencing life as completely disrupted by cancer to a life back to normal. A greater sense of normalcy was associated with higher engagement in valued activities and increased physical and psychological well-being.   Conclusions:   In addition to the core process of working toward normalcy, multiple theories from nursing, sociology, psychology, and gerontology helped to explain case findings. This knowledge could serve as a foundation on which to design survivorship care that supports the goals of cancer survivors working toward normalcy post-treatment.  Interpretation:   Post-treatment wellness goals can include a desire to reestablish or maintain a sense of normalcy. Nursing actions that promote survivors' efforts to be perceived as capable, stay engaged in valued activities and roles, maintain a sense of control over their lives and bodies, and make plans for the future may help meet this goal.

Analyzing geographic patterns and temporal trends may help identify high-risk populations, suggest the degree of PSA testing, and provide clues to etiology. We used incidence data available from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and certain cancer registries for 43 populations across five continents during a median period of 24 years. Trends in overall prostate cancer rates showed five distinct patterns ranging from generally monotonic increases to peaking of rates followed by declines, which coincide somewhat with changes in the prevalence of PSA testing. Trends in age-specific rates generally mirrored those in the overall rates, with several notable exceptions. For populations where overall rates increased rapidly and then peaked, exemplified in North America and Oceania, the highest incidence tended to be most pronounced and occurred during earlier calendar years among older men compared with younger ones. For populations with almost continual increases in overall rates, exemplified in Eastern Europe and Asia, peaks were evident among men aged ≥ 75 years in many instances. Rates for ages 45-54 years did not clearly stabilize or decline in the majority of studied populations. Global geographic variation remained substantial for both overall and age-specific incidence rates regardless of levels of PSA testing, with the lowest rates consistently in Asia.

Methods:   This was a 48-week Phase III, open-label, parallel-group comparative study. TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5 mg (6M group) and TAP-144-SR (3M) 11.25 mg (3M group) were administered to 81 and 79 subjects, respectively. The primary endpoint was the rate of serum testosterone suppression to the castrate level (≤100 ng/dl).  Results:   Serum testosterone of all subjects excluding one subject in the 3M group was suppressed to the castrate level throughout 48 weeks. The estimated between-group difference (6M group - 3M group) in suppression rate was 1.3% (95% confidence interval: -3.4, 6.8), and its lower confidence interval was more than -10% of the pre-determined allowable limit value to judge the non-inferiority.

Our objective was to compare the incidence of four urological cancers (kidney, bladder, prostate and testicular) among six 'non-White' ethnic groups in England (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African, Black Caribbean and Chinese) to each other and to Whites.  Methods:   We obtained Information on ethnicity for all urological cancer registrations from 2001 to 2007 (n = 329,524) by linkage to the Hospital Episodes Statistics database. We calculated incidence rate ratios adjusted for age, sex and income, comparing the six ethnic groups (and combined 'South Asian' and 'Black' groups) to Whites and to each other.  Results:   There were significant differences in the incidence of all four cancers between the ethnic groups (all p < 0.001). In general, 'non-White' groups had a lower incidence of urological cancers compared to Whites, except prostate cancer, which displayed a higher incidence in Blacks. (IRR 2.55) There was strong evidence of differences in risk between Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis for kidney, bladder and prostate cancer (p < 0.001), and between Black Africans and Black Caribbeans for all four cancers (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   The risk of urological cancers in England varies greatly by ethnicity, including within groups that have traditionally been analysed together (South Asians and Blacks). In general, these differences are not readily explained by known risk factors, although the very high incidence of prostate cancer in both black Africans and Caribbeans suggests increased genetic susceptibility. g.""","""['Mahiben Maruthappu', 'Isobel Barnes', 'Shameq Sayeed', 'Raghib Ali']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Incidence of gastrointestinal cancers by ethnic group in England, 2001-2007.', 'Incidence of haematological malignancies by ethnic group in England, 2001-7.', 'Incidence of breast and gynaecological cancers by ethnic group in England, 2001-2007: a descriptive study.', 'Incidence of kidney, bladder, and prostate cancers in Korea: An update.', 'Incidence of urological cancers in neurological patients: a review of the literature from the EAU Young Academic Urologist Functional Group.', 'Differences in cancer incidence by broad ethnic group in England, 2013-2017.', 'Combined Open Prostatectomy and Kidney Surgery: Feasibility and 12-Month Outcome.', 'Immune Inflammation Pathways as Therapeutic Targets to Reduce Lethal Prostate Cancer in African American Men.', 'An overview of cancer health disparities: new approaches and insights and why they matter.', 'High mortality risk of prostate cancer patients in Asia and West Africa: A systematic review.']"""

Methods:   The present prospective study analyzed 42 patients from both genders underwent surgical treatment for rectal adenocarcinoma with curative intent. The version of the International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire validated for the Portuguese language was applied at two time-points: immediately before and 6 months after surgery. Risk factors for urinary dysfunction were analysed by means of logistic regression and Student's t-test.  Results:   Eight (19%) participants exhibited moderate-to-severe urinary dysfunction 6 months after surgery; the average IPSS increased from 1.43 at baseline to 4.62 six months after surgery (P<0.001). None of the variables assessed as potential risk factors exhibited statistical significance, i.e., age, gender, distance from tumour to anal margin, neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, type of surgery, surgical approach (laparoscopy or laparotomy), and duration of surgery.

QDs represent an ideal detection material for in situ hybridization (ISH) because they may provide unprecedented resolution and strong signal intensities that are not attainable with traditional fluorophores. Unfortunately, lack of reliability has been an impediment to widespread adoption of QD-based fluorescence in situ hybridization (QD FISH) technology. By optimizing QD-to-target accessibility, we have developed a QD FISH staining procedure that dramatically improves the reliability of an automated ERG/PTEN QD FISH assay (91% 1st pass rate). Here, we report improvements to the assay that protects QD fluorescence from quenching due to trace amounts of heavy metals and minimizes QD background signals. When using this method, highly-consistent staining was observed with the ERG/PTEN QD FISH assay in prostate tissue. Successful staining of several other clinically-relevant genetic markers was also possible. We further demonstrated improved reliability for determining HER2 gene status in breast cancer, identifying anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene break-apart in non-small cell lung cancer, and detecting human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The enhanced QD FISH assay allows for examining complicated genetic aberrances without use of enzymatic amplification.

It is originally derived from the Caribbean marine tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata and currently produced synthetically. Trabectedin is active against a variety of tumor cell lines growing in culture. The present study focused on the effect of trabectedin in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and spheroid formation in prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs). Cluster of differentiation (CD) 133+high/CD44+high prostate CSCs were isolated from the DU145 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line through flow cytometry. We studied the growth-inhibitory effects of trabectedin and its molecular mechanisms on human prostate CSCs and non-CSCs. DU-145 and PC-3 CSCs were treated with 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 nM trabectedin for 24, 48 and 72 h and the growth inhibition rates were examined using the sphere-forming assay. Annexin-V assay and immunofluorescence analyses were performed for the detection of the cell death. Concentration-dependent effects of trabectedin on the cell cycle were also evaluated. The cells were exposed to the different doses of trabectedin for 24, 48 and 72 h to evaluate the effect of trabectedin on the number and diameter of spheroids. According to the results, trabectedin induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis at the IC50 dose, resulting in a significant increase expression of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, p53 and decrease expression of bcl-2 in dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analyses revealed that trabectedin induces dose-dependent G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest, particularly at high-dose treatments. Three-dimensional culture studies showed that trabectedin reduced the number and diameter of spheroids of DU145 and PC3 CSCs. Furthermore, we have found that trabectedin disrupted cell-cell interactions via E-cadherin in prostasphere of DU-145 and PC-3 CSCs. Our results showed that trabectedin inhibits cellular proliferation and accelerates apoptotic events in prostate CSCs; and may be a potential effective therapeutic agent against prostate cancer.""","""['Eda Acikgoz', 'Ummu Guven', 'Fahriye Duzagac', 'Ruchan Uslu', 'Mikail Kara', 'Burak Cem Soner', 'Gulperi Oktem']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) promotes G2/M phase arrest via p53 expression and induces apoptosis through caspase- and mitochondria-dependent signaling pathways in human prostate cancer DU 145 cells.', 'A diverse induction of apoptosis by trabectedin in MCF-7 (HER2-/ER+) and MDA-MB-453 (HER2+/ER-) breast cancer cells.', 'Anti-angiogenic effects of trabectedin (Yondelis; ET-743) on human breast cancer cells.', 'Trabectedin (ET-743): evaluation of its use in advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.', 'Trabectedin in soft tissue sarcomas.', 'Increased soluble E‑cadherin of spheroid formation supplemented with fetal bovine serum in colorectal cancer cells.', 'Marine Power on Cancer: Drugs, Lead Compounds, and Mechanisms.', 'Therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting of neuronal pentraxin receptor to control metastasis in gastric cancer.', ""3',4'-Dihydro-2'H-spiroindoline-3,1'-isoquinolin-2-ones as potential anti-cancer agents: synthesis and preliminary screening."", 'Adaptive phenotypic modulations lead to therapy resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia cells.']"""

A contracted lower uterine segment (LUS) and a relaxed uterine fundal myometrium (FUN) during pregnancy are required to prevent pressure on the cervix from the fetal head due to gravity. With the onset of labor, this regionalization of myometrial function must be reversed, allowing descent of the fetus, dilation of the cervix, and expulsion of the fetus through the birth canal. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear.  Objective and design:   This study sought to identify phenotypic regionalization of LUS and FUN during pregnancy, RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the human myometrial transcriptome. Real-time PCR and immunoblotting were applied to validate sequencing results. Cell contraction/adhesion assays and gene microarrays were used to study the cellular functions of the identified genes.  Results:   Homeobox A13 (HoxA13), prostacyclin synthase (PTGIS), and periostin (POSTN) genes are more highly expressed in LUS than FUN of nonlaboring, but not laboring, myometrial cells at term. HoxA13 up-regulates transcription of PTGIS and POSTN genes. Elevated HoxA13 expression enhances myometrial cell contractility and cell-cell adhesion. Gene microarray studies show that HoxA13-regulated genes are associated with immune response, gap junction/cell adhesion, and pregnancy.  Conclusion:   The LUS expresses higher levels of HoxA13, PTGIS, and POSTN, and is more contractile than the FUN at term prior to labor. This pregnancy-maintaining regionalization of myometrial function may be mediated by HoxA13.""","""['LiangLiang Liu', 'Haolong Li', 'Daryanaz Dargahi', 'Oksana Shynlova', 'Donna Slater', 'Steven J M Jones', 'Stephen J Lye', 'Xuesen Dong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['HoxA13 Stimulates Myometrial Cells to Secrete IL-1β and Enhance the Expression of Contraction-Associated Proteins.', 'HoxA10 and HoxA11 Regulate the Expression of Contraction-Associated Proteins and Contribute to Regionalized Myometrium Phenotypes in Women.', 'Human myometrial gene expression before and during parturition.', 'Integration of endocrine and mechanical signals in the regulation of myometrial functions during pregnancy and labour.', 'Myometrial progesterone responsiveness and the control of human parturition.', 'A single-cell atlas of murine reproductive tissues during preterm labor.', 'MYB and ELF3 differentially modulate labor-inducing gene expression in myometrial cells.', 'Transcriptomic profiling of the telomerase transformed Mesenchymal stromal cells derived adipocytes in response to rosiglitazone.', 'A single-cell atlas of the myometrium in human parturition.', 'Transcriptional control of parturition: insights from gene regulation studies in the myometrium.']"""

Few data exist regarding the prevalence of soft-tissue metastases at the initial diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   This study analyzed 232 men with nonmetastatic (M0) castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who developed metastases detected by a bone scan or computed tomography (CT). All bone scans and CT scans within the 30 days before or after the mCRPC diagnosis were reviewed. The rate of soft-tissue metastases among those undergoing CT was determined. Then, predictors of soft-tissue metastases and visceral and lymph node metastases were identified.  Results:   Compared with men undergoing CT (n = 118), men undergoing only bone scans (n = 114) were more likely to have received primary treatment (P = .048), were older (P = .013), and less recently developed metastases (P = .018). Among those undergoing CT, 52 (44%) had soft-tissue metastases, including 20 visceral metastases (17%) and 41 lymph node metastases (35%), whereas 30% had no bone involvement. In a univariable analysis, only prostate-specific antigen (PSA) predicted soft-tissue metastases (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; P = .047), and no statistically significant predictors of visceral metastases were found. A higher PSA level was associated with an increased risk of lymph node metastases (OR, 1.38; P = .014), whereas receiving primary treatment was associated with decreased risk (OR, 0.36; P = .015).  Conclusions:   The data suggest that there is a relatively high rate of soft-tissue metastasis (44%) among CRPC patients undergoing CT at the initial diagnosis of metastases, including some men with no bone involvement. Therefore, forgoing CT during a metastatic evaluation may lead to an underdiagnosis of soft-tissue metastases and an underdiagnosis of metastases in general.

This elevated expression is associated with protection against apoptosis, increased metastasis and poor prognosis. Inhibitors of fatty acid synthase, such as the cerulenin synthetic analog C75, decrease prostate cancer cell proliferation, increase apoptosis and decrease tumor growth in experimental models. Although radiotherapy is widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer patients, the risk of damage to neighboring normal organs limits the radiation dose that can be delivered. In this study, we examined the potential of fatty acid synthase inhibition to sensitize prostate cancer cells to radiotherapy. The efficacy of C75 alone or in combination with X irradiation was examined in monolayers and in multicellular tumor spheroids. Treatment with C75 alone decreased clonogenic survival, an effect that was abrogated by the antioxidant. C75 treatment also delayed spheroid growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The radiosensitizing effect of C75 was indicated by combination index values between 0.65 and 0.71 and the reduced surviving fraction of clonogens, in response to 2 Gy X irradiation, from 0.51 to 0.30 and 0.11 in the presence of 25 and 35 μM C75, respectively. This increased sensitivity to radiation was reduced by the presence of the antioxidant. The C75 treatment also enhanced the spheroid growth delay induced by X irradiation in a supra-additive manner. The level of radiation-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells was increased further by C75, which induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, but only at a concentration greater than that required for radiosensitization. Radiation-induced G2/M blockade was not affected by C75 treatment. These results suggest the potential use of fatty acid synthase inhibition to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy of prostate carcinoma and that C75-dependent cell cycle arrest is not responsible for its radiosensitizing effect.""","""['Colin Rae', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'John W Babich', 'Robert J Mairs']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiat Res""","""['Fatty acid synthase inhibitors cerulenin and C75 retard growth and induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in human melanoma A-375 cells.', 'Synthesis and antitumor activity of an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase.', 'Different fatty acid metabolism effects of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and C75 in adenocarcinoma lung cancer.', 'Growth arrest induced by C75, A fatty acid synthase inhibitor, was partially modulated by p38 MAPK but not by p53 in human hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Pharmacological inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN)--catalyzed endogenous fatty acid biogenesis: a new family of anti-cancer agents?', 'Overcoming Radiation Resistance in Gliomas by Targeting Metabolism and DNA Repair Pathways.', 'Lipogenesis inhibitors: therapeutic opportunities and challenges.', 'Ribosomal Protein S6: A Potential Therapeutic Target against Cancer?', 'Metabolic response to radiation therapy in cancer.', 'Enhancing 223Ra Treatment Efficacy by Anti-β1 Integrin Targeting.']"""

In this study, we aim to elucidate the role of the GR in docetaxel-resistant PCa in order to improve the current PCa therapies. GR expression was analyzed in a tissue microarray of primary PCa specimens from chemonaive and docetaxel-treated patients, and in cultured PCa cell lines with an acquired docetaxel resistance (PC3-DR, DU145-DR, and 22Rv1-DR). We found a robust overexpression of the GR in primary PCa from docetaxel-treated patients and enhanced GR levels in cultured docetaxel-resistant human PCa cells, indicating a key role of the GR in docetaxel resistance. The capability of the GR antagonists (RU-486 and cyproterone acetate) to revert docetaxel resistance was investigated and revealed significant resensitization of docetaxel-resistant PCa cells for docetaxel treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner, in which a complete restoration of docetaxel sensitivity was achieved in both androgen receptor (AR)-negative and AR-positive cell lines. Mechanistically, we demonstrated down-regulation of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 upon GR antagonism, thereby defining potential treatment targets. In conclusion, we describe the involvement of the GR in the acquisition of docetaxel resistance in human PCa. Therapeutic targeting of the GR effectively resensitizes docetaxel-resistant PCa cells.

In this study, we demonstrated that estrogen (17β-estradiol [E2]) has biphasic effects on prostate tumor growth. A lower dose of E2 increased tumor growth in mouse xenograft models using DU145 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells, whereas a higher dose significantly decreased tumor growth. We found that anchorage-independent apoptosis in these cells was inhibited by E2 treatment. Similarly, in vivo angiogenesis was suppressed by E2. Interestingly, these effects of E2 were abolished by knockdown of either estrogen receptor β (ERβ) or Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor 5 (KLF5). Ιn addition, E2 suppressed KLF5-mediated transcription through ERβ, which inhibits proapoptotic FOXO1 and proangiogenic PDGFA expression. Furthermore, we revealed that a nonagonistic ER ligand GS-1405 inhibited FOXO1 and PDGFA expression through the ERβ-KLF5 pathway and regulated prostate tumor growth without ERβ transactivation. Therefore, these results suggest that E2 biphasically modulates prostate tumor formation by regulating KLF5-dependent transcription through ERβ and provide a new strategy for designing ER modulators, which will be able to regulate prostate cancer progression with minimal adverse effects due to ER transactivation.""","""['Yuka Nakajima', 'Asami Osakabe', 'Tsuyoshi Waku', 'Takashi Suzuki', 'Kensuke Akaogi', 'Tetsuya Fujimura', 'Yukio Homma', 'Satoshi Inoue', 'Junn Yanagisawa']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['Estrogen regulates tumor growth through a nonclassical pathway that includes the transcription factors ERβ and KLF5.', 'Estrogen receptor β: switching to a new partner and escaping from estrogen.', '17β-Estradiol regulates oxidative stress in prostate cancer cell lines according to ERalpha/ERbeta ratio.', 'Estrogens and mechanisms of prostate cancer progression.', 'Clinical significance of estrogen receptor β in breast and prostate cancer from biological aspects.', 'Krüppel-like factors in tumors: Key regulators and therapeutic avenues.', 'Intratumoral Treatment with 5-Androstene-3β, 17α-Diol Reduces Tumor Size and Lung Metastasis in a Triple-Negative Experimental Model of Breast Cancer.', 'The roles and regulation of the KLF5 transcription factor in cancers.', 'Current knowledge of Krüppel-like factor 5 and vascular remodeling: providing insights for therapeutic strategies.', 'Estrogen Receptor Beta (ERβ): A Ligand Activated Tumor Suppressor.']"""

We investigated whether current smokers with 20 to 29 pack-years have similar lung cancer risks as eligible former smokers and also whether they have a different demographic profile.  Methods:   The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) was a randomly assigned screening trial of subjects age 55 to 74 years with chest radiographs (CXR) used for lung cancer. Subjects completed a baseline questionnaire containing smoking history questions. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age and sex, were utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for various smoking history groups. Next, we utilized the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which inquired about smoking history and race/ethnicity, to analyze the demographic profiles of various high-risk smoking history categories. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   The PLCO cohort included 18 114 former and 12 243 current LDCT-eligible smokers, plus 2283 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers. The hazard ratio for 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers compared with eligible (30+ pack-year) former smokers was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75 to 1.5). Based on the NHIS, 10 million persons in the United States are currently LDCT eligible; an additional 1.6 million (16%, 95% CI = 13.6% to 19.0%) are 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers. The percentage increase in eligibles if 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers were included was substantially greater for women than men (22.2%, 95% CI = 17.9% to 26.7%; vs 12.2%, 95% CI = 9.3% to 15.3%, P < .001) and for minorities than non-Hispanic whites (30.0%, 95% CI = 24.2% to 36.0%; vs 14.1%, 95% CI = 11.1% to 17.0%, P < .001).

Due to a limited detection rate of established positron emission tomography (PET) tracers, there is a clinical need for innovative tumor-specific PET compounds addressing new imaging targets. The aim of this study was to compare the properties of [(18)F]Bombesin (BAY 86-4367) as an innovative biomarker for prostate cancer imaging targeting the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor and [(11)C]Choline ([(11)C]CHO) in a human prostate tumor mouse xenograft model by small animal PET/X-ray computed tomography (CT).  Procedures:   We carried out a dual-tracer small animal PET/CT study comparing [(18)F]Bombesin and [(11)C]CHO. The androgen-independent human prostate tumor cell line PC-3 was implanted subcutaneously in the flanks of nu/nu NMRI mice (n = 10) (PET/CT measurements of two [(11)C]Choline mice could not be analyzed due to technical reasons). [(18)F]Bombesin and [(11)C]CHO PET/CT imaging was performed about 3-4 weeks after the implantation of PC-3 cells on two separate days. After the intravenous tail vein injection of 14 MBq [(18)F]Bombesin and 37 MBq [(11)C]CHO, respectively, a dynamic study over 60 min was acquired in list mode using an Inveon animal PET/CT scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions). The sequence of [(18)F]Bombesin and [(11)C]CHO was randomized. Image analysis was performed using summed images as well as dynamic data. To calculate static and dynamic tumor-to-muscle (T/M), tumor-to-blood (T/B), liver-to-blood (L/B), and kidney-to-blood (K/B) ratios, 4 × 4 × 4 mm(3) volumes of interest (VOIs) of tumor, muscle (thigh), liver, kidney, and blood derived from transversal slices were used.  Results:   The mean T/M ratio of [(18)F]Bombesin and [(11)C]CHO was 6.54 ± 2.49 and 1.35 ± 0.30, respectively. The mean T/B ratio was 1.83 ± 0.79 for [(18)F]Bombesin and 0.55 ± 0.10 for [(11)C]CHO. The T/M ratio as well as the T/B ratio for [(18)F]Bombesin were significantly higher compared to those for [(11)C]CHO (p < 0.001, respectively). Kidney and liver uptake was statistically significantly lower for [(18)F]Bombesin (K/B 3.41 ± 0.81, L/B 1.99 ± 0.38) compared to [(11)C]CHO [K/B 7.91 ± 1.85 (p < 0.001), L/B 6.27 ± 1.99 (p < 0.001)]. The magnitudes of the time course of T/M and T/B ratios (T/M and T/Bdyn ratios) were statistically significantly different (showing a higher uptake of [(18)F]Bombesin compared to [(11)C]CHO); additionally, also the change of the T/M and T/B ratios over time was significantly different between both tracers in the dynamic analysis (p < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, there was a statistically significantly different change of the K/B and L/B ratios over time between the two tracers in the dynamic analysis (p = 0.026 and p < 0.001, respectively).

Objective:   To determine long-term outcomes with respect to the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) in a prospective AS cohort. Early results have already been published; we now present findings with long-term follow-up.  Design, setting, and participants:   A subset of patients (n=86) underwent pre-enrolment DW-MRI in a prospective AS study between 2002 and 2006. Inclusion criteria were untreated prostate cancer, clinical T1/T2a/N0M0, Gleason ≤ 3+4, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <15 ng/ml. Protocol follow-up was by biopsy at 18-24 mo and then every 24 mo, with regular PSA measurement.  Intervention:   Men underwent baseline DW-MRI in addition to standard sequences. ADC was measured from the index lesion on T2-weighted images. To avoid influencing treatment decisions, DW-MRI sequence results were not available to the AS study investigators.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Baseline ADC was analysed with respect to time to radical treatment (TRT) and time to adverse histology (TAH). Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 9.5 yr (interquartile range 7.9-10.0 yr). On univariate analysis, ADC below the median was associated with shorter TAH (hazard ratio [HR] 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-3.89; p<0.014) and TRT (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.49-4.32; p<0.001). Median TRT was 9.3 yr (95% CI 7.0-11.6 yr) for patients with ADC above the median and only 2.4 yr (95% CI 1.5-6.0 yr) for ADC below the median. For TRT, addition of ADC to a multivariate model of baseline variables resulted in a significant improvement in model fit (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.14-1.54; p<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis for TRT revealed an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% CI 0.70-0.88). The number of variables included in the multivariate model was limited by sample size.  Conclusions:   Long-term follow-up for this study provides strong evidence that ADC is a useful marker when selecting patients for AS. Routine DW-MRI is now being evaluated in our ongoing AS study for initial assessment and as an alternative to repeat biopsy.

There is ample anecdotal evidence that the clinical application of electroporation is often associated with loud sounds and extremely high currents that exceed the devices design limit after which the devices cease to function. The goal of this paper is to elucidate and quantify the biophysical and biochemical basis for this phenomenon. Using an experimental design that includes clinical data, a tissue phantom, sound, optical, ultrasound and MRI measurements, we show that the phenomenon is caused by electrical breakdown across ionized electrolysis produced gases near the electrodes. The breakdown occurs primarily near the cathode. Electrical breakdown during electroporation is a biophysical phenomenon of substantial importance to the outcome of clinical applications.

A novel 8-protein prognostic assay generates a risk score at time of biopsy that is predictive of prostate cancer aggressiveness and can inform treatment decisions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using the assay to inform treatment decisions compared with usual care.  Patients and methods:   We developed a simulation model to estimate quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and cost outcomes for the 8-protein assay and usual care strategies. Risk classification outcomes, treatment distributions, costs, health state utilities, and mortality rates were derived from the assay's validation study and the peer-reviewed literature. Outcomes included incremental QALYs, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratios. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the most influential inputs and to explore joint uncertainty in outcomes, respectively.  Results:   The 8-protein assay strategy resulted in 0.04 more QALY and $700 less in costs compared with usual care (and thus was ""dominant""). The cost-effectiveness of the assay strategy was most sensitive to the assay cost, the active surveillance health state utility, and the proportion of low-risk patients receiving active surveillance (vs. treatment) in usual care. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the assay strategy decreased cost and increased QALYs in 86.9% and 58.3% of simulations, respectively.

Materials and methods:   Boost volumes were identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in 11 patients with high-risk prostate cancer. Patients were treated using a dose-painting approach; the boost dose was limited to 86 Gy in 37 fractions, while keeping the rectal normal tissue complication probability to 5-6%. Rotational intensity-modulated radiotherapy was used with daily image guidance and fiducial markers.  Results:   The median dose to the prostate (outside the boost volume) and urethra was 75.4 Gy/37 fractions (range 75.1-75.8 Gy), whereas the median boost dose was 83.4 Gy (range 79.0-87.4 Gy). The tumour control probability (TCP) (Marsden model) increased from 71% for the standard plans to 83.6% [76.6-86.8%] for the dose-painting boost plans. The mean (Lyman-Kutcher-Burman) normal tissue complication probability for rectal bleeding was 5.2% (range 3.3-6.2%) and 5.2% for faecal incontinence (range 3.6-7.8%). All patients tolerated the treatment well, with a low acute toxicity profile. At a median follow-up of 36 months (range 24-50) there was no grade 3 late toxicity. Two patients had grade 2 late urinary toxicity (urethral stricture, urinary frequency and urgency), one patient had grade 1 and one grade 2 late rectal toxicity. The mean prostate-specific antigen at follow-up was 0.81 ng/ml after stopping hormone therapy; one patient relapsed biochemically at 32 months (2.70 ng/ml).  Conclusions:   The toxicity for this radiobiological guided dose-painting protocol was low, but we have only treated a small cohort with limited follow-up time.

There is increasing interest within the field of exercise oncology surrounding potential strategies to remediate these adverse outcomes. This study compared 4 weeks of moderate-intensity exercise (MIE) and high-intensity exercise (HIE) training on peak oxygen consumption (V̇O2peak) and body composition in colorectal cancer survivors.  Methods:   Forty seven post-treatment colorectal cancer survivors (HIE = 27 months post-treatment; MIE = 38 months post-treatment) were randomised to either HIE [85-95 % peak heart rate (HRpeak)] or MIE (70 % HRpeak) in equivalence with current physical activity guidelines and completed 12 training sessions over 4 weeks.  Results:   HIE was superior to MIE in improving absolute (p = 0.016) and relative (p = 0.021) V̇O2peak. Absolute (+0.28 L.min(-1), p < 0.001) and relative (+3.5 ml.kg(-1).min(-1), p < 0.001) V̇O2 peak were increased in the HIE group but not the MIE group following training. HIE led to significant increases in lean mass (+0.72 kg, p = 0.002) and decreases in fat mass (-0.74 kg, p < 0.001) and fat percentage (-1.0 %, p < 0.001), whereas no changes were observed for the MIE group. There were no severe adverse events.  Conclusions:   In response to short-term training, HIE is a safe, feasible and efficacious intervention that offers clinically meaningful improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition for colorectal cancer survivors.

Adjuvant radiotherapy (XRT) has been shown to increase freedom from BCR, but its impact on overall survival is controversial and it may represent overtreatment for some. The present study, therefore, sought to identify men with SVI at higher risk for BCR after RP in the absence of adjuvant XRT.  Methods:   We identified 180 patients in our institutional database who underwent RP from 1990 to 2011 who had pT3bN0-1 disease. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate freedom from BCR for the overall cohort and substratified by Gleason score, PSA, surgical margin status, and lymph node positivity. Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to determine demographic and histopathological factors predictive of BCR. Time-dependent ROC curve analysis was conducted to assess the ability of the UCSF-CAPRA score to predict BCR.  Results:   Median age was 64 years, and 52.8% of patients were preoperative D'Amico high risk. At RP, 41.4% had a positive surgical margin (PSM), and 12.2% had positive lymph nodes (LN). The most common sites of PSM were the peripheral zone (56.8%) and the apex (32.4%). Positive bladder neck margin (HR = 7.01, P = 0.035) and PSA 10-20 versus ≤10 (HR = 1.63, P = 0.047) predicted higher BCR in multivariable analyses. Median follow-up was 26 months, and 2-, 3-, and 5-year BCR-free rates were 56.1%, 49.0%, and 39.5%. Log rank tests showed that freedom from BCR was significantly less for Gleason 9-10, PSA >20, PSM, and N1 patients. The area under curve (AUC) for CAPRA in predicting BCR was 0.713 at 2 years, 0.692 at 3 years, and 0.641 at 5 years. Increasing CAPRA score was associated with an increased risk of BCR (HR = 1.33, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   pT3b prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease commonly associated with several high-risk features. Stratifying men with SVI by prognostic features (i.e., Gleason, PSA, node status, surgical margin status) and using these features to augment the CAPRA score will improve identification of those at higher risk for BCR that should be strongly considered for adjuvant XRT.""","""['Matthew J Pagano', 'Michael J Whalen', 'David J Paulucci', 'Balaji N Reddy', 'Justin T Matulay', 'Michael Rothberg', 'Kyle Scarberry', 'Trushar Patel', 'Edan Y Shapiro', 'Arindam RoyChoudhury', 'James McKiernan', 'Mitchell C Benson', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Lymph node yield during radical prostatectomy does not impact rate of biochemical recurrence in patients with seminal vesicle invasion and node-negative disease.', 'Risk stratification of patients with extraprostatic extension and negative lymph nodes at radical prostatectomy: identifying optimal candidates for adjuvant therapy.', 'Factors influencing biochemical recurrence in patients who have received salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Perineural invasion as an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Impact of positive surgical margin on biochemical recurrence in localized prostate cancer.', 'Factors affecting biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy in patients with positive and negative surgical margin.', 'Intratumoral Heterogeneity Determines the Expression of mTOR-pathway Proteins in Prostate Cancer.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer with seminal vesicle involvement (T3b): A multicentric retrospective analysis.', 'The impact of lymphovascular invasion in patients with prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy and its association with their clinicopathological features: An updated PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Specificity gains were examined for sbx versus comb-bx when the endpoint consisted of postoperatively favorable PCa at RP. Sensitivity gains were examined, when analyses focused on postoperatively unfavorable PCa.  Results:   Comb-bx resulted in higher correct overall Gleason assignment (68.3 vs. 56.7 %, p = 0.008) than sbx. Similarly, lower rates of undergrading (21.2 vs. 36.3 %, p < 0.001) were recorded.

Here we have investigated how the differences in bone turnover affect seeding of tumour cells and/or development of overt osteolytic bone metastasis using in vivo models of hormone-independent breast and prostate cancer.  Methods:   Cohorts of 6 (young) and 16 (mature)-week old BALB/c nude mice were culled 1, 7 and 21 days after received intracardiac injection of luciferase expressing human prostate (PC3) or breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines labelled with a fluorescent cell membrane dye (Vybrant DiD). The presence of growing bone metastases was determined by bioluminescence using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) and followed by anatomical confirmation of tumour metastatic sites post mortem, while the presence of individual fluorescently labelled tumour cells was evaluated using two-photon microscopy ex vivo. The bone remodelling activities were compared between young and mature naïve mice (both male and female) using micro-CT analysis, ELISA and bone histomorphometry.  Results:   Both prostate and breast cancer cells generated higher numbers of overt skeletal lesions in young mice (~80%) than in mature mice (~20%). Although mature mice presented with fewer overt bone metastases, the number of tumour cells arriving/colonizing in the tibias was comparable between young and mature animals. Young naïve mice had lower bone volume but higher bone formation and resorption activities compared to mature animals.

It is frequently deleted and inactivated in prostate cancer and may exert a tumor suppressor function. However, how KLF5 inhibits the progression of prostate cancer is still not clear. In the present study, we identified how KLF5 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) pathway, which can induce apoptosis in cancer, regulate each other in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.  Material and methods:   The expression of messenger RNA and protein was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and western blot analysis, respectively. To identify whether KLF5 regulates the activity of TNFα downstream pathway, we constructed a stable KLF5 knockdown or KLF5 overexpressing cell line with lentivirus-containing short hairpin RNA targeting KLF5 or full-length KLF5 in LNCaP cells. Cell apoptosis was determined through flow cytometry assay. In addition, the regulation of KLF5 on target gene transcription was detected by reporter luciferase activity assay, and the binding of KLF5 on target promoter was detected through oligonucleotides pull-down analysis.  Results:   We found that TNFα induced the expression of KLF5 at both messenger RNA and protein levels; moreover, TNFα up-regulated KLF5 through TNF receptor 1 but not through TNF receptor 2 in LNCaP cells. Knockdown of KLF5 decreased apoptosis induced by TNFα, whereas cell apoptosis was increased by KLF5 overexpression. Consistently, expression of cleaved PARP and caspase-3 induced by TNFα was decreased by KLF5 knockdown, whereas it was increased by overexpressed KLF5. JNK activity is essential for the apoptosis induced by TNFα. We found that knockdown of KLF5 not only decreased the phosphorylation of JNK induced by TNFα, but also down-regulated the transcription of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), an upstream kinase of JNK, by binding to the MKK7 promoter.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that KLF5 is an essential transcription regulator of MKK7 kinase and promotes the apoptosis induced by TNFα in LNCaP cells. Loss of KLF5 in prostate cancer may decrease cell response to TNFα-inducing apoptosis and facilitate cancer initiation and progression; moreover, KLF5 could be a potential molecular marker for predicting the effect of high-dose TNFα on tumor growth inhibition in prostate cancer.""","""['Qi Shi', 'Yang Gao', 'Shan Xu', 'Chong Du', 'Feng Li', 'Xiao-Shuang Tang', 'Jing Jia', 'Xinyang Wang', 'Luke Chang', 'Dalin He', 'Peng Guo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['KLF5 promotes apoptosis induced by phorbol ester as an effector of the autocrine factor TNFα in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'PC-SPES: Molecular mechanism to induce apoptosis and down-regulate expression of PSA in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Klf5 deletion promotes Pten deletion-initiated luminal-type mouse prostate tumors through multiple oncogenic signaling pathways.', 'ML264: An Antitumor Agent that Potently and Selectively Inhibits Krüppel-like Factor Five (KLF5) Expression: A Probe for Studying Colon Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Targeting Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) for cancer therapy.', 'Krüppel-like factor 5 promotes the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma via the baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 gene.', 'The roles and regulation of the KLF5 transcription factor in cancers.', 'The long non-coding RNA TUG1-miR-9a-5p axis contributes to ischemic injuries by promoting cardiomyocyte apoptosis via targeting KLF5.', 'KLF5 promotes apoptosis induced by phorbol ester as an effector of the autocrine factor TNFα in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'KLF16 promotes proliferation in gastric cancer cells via regulating p21 and CDK4.']"""

Experimental design:   Retrospectively obtained contrast CT from 72 patients with primary RCC were used to establish threshold values for Low, Intermediate and High tumor vascularity. Paired histopathology specimens from 33 of these patients were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to correlate CT with IMP-3 expression. IMP-3 gene expression studies were performed on RCC and poorly vascular prostate cancer (PC) human bone metastases samples to confirm presence of IMP3 in metastatic samples from RCC. Gene expression studies were performed on RCC 786-O and PC3 cell lines to confirm the presence of high expression of IMP3 in the RCC cell line.  Results:   IMP-3 expression positively correlated with CT vascular enhancement (p<0.01). IMP3 expression by IHC was strongly positive in all RCC, but weak in PC bone metastases.

Likewise, routine clinicopathological features cannot clearly distinguish aggressive from indolent tumors at the time of diagnosis; thus, new prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed. The DNA methylation variant 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC, an oxidized derivative of 5-methylcytosine) has recently emerged as a new diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker candidate for several human malignancies. However, this remains to be systematically investigated for PC. In this study, we determined 5hmC levels in 311 PC (stratified by ERG status) and 228 adjacent non-malignant (NM) prostate tissue specimens by immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray, representing a large radical prostatectomy (RP) cohort with long clinical follow-up. We investigated possible correlations between 5hmC and routine clinicopathological variables and assessed the prognostic potential of 5hmC by Kaplan-Meier and uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses in ERG+ (n = 178) vs. ERG- (n = 133) PCs using biochemical recurrence (BCR) as endpoint.  Results:   We observed a borderline significant (p = 0.06) reduction in 5hmC levels in PC compared to NM tissue samples, which was explained by a highly significant (p < 0.001) loss of 5hmC in ERG- PCs. ERG status was not predictive of BCR in this cohort (p = 0.73), and no significant association was found between BCR and 5hmC levels in ERG+ PCs (p = 0.98). In contrast, high 5hmC immunoreactivity was a significant adverse predictor of BCR after RP in ERG- PCs, independent of Gleason score, pathological tumor stage, surgical margin status, and pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (hazard ratio (HR) (95 % confidence interval (CI)): 1.62 (1.15-2.28), p = 0.006).  Conclusions:   This is the first study to demonstrate a prognostic potential for 5hmC in PC.

Its overexpression has been detected in both local and metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), making it a potential therapeutic target. We previously reported that silencing PSCA by small interfering RNA targeting human PSCA (siRNA-PSCA) inhibited biological activity of PSCA-positive PCa cells leading to reduced proliferation, motility and invasion in vitro. In this study, we extended this in vitro findings to in vivo settings in order to investigate the effects of this specific siRNA on the tumor growth and metastasis development of PCa in vivo.  Materials and methods:   The siRNA-PSCA and ectopically overexpressed-PSCA vector were constructed and transfected into human PCa PC-3M and LNCaP cells, respectively, and were subcutaneously inoculated into the male SCID mice. Tumor growth was measured with a caliper, and formation of metastasis in mice bearing xenograft tumors was studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and autopsy analysis. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the expression levels of PSCA protein in tumor tissues from xenograft and distant metastases.  Results:   Consistent with our previous in vitro findings, the subcutaneous xenografts of PC-3M-siPSCA exhibited the almost completely inhibited expression of PSCA protein in their tumors tissues (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively), and consequently had a significant reduction in tumor growth volumes (P < 0.05 for all), and metastasis onset and sites (P < 0.001 for all) compared to those of PC-3M and PC-3M-siScrm. Conversely, LNCaP-PSCA showed significantly enhanced primary tumor growth and metastasis formation of xenografts compared to LNCaP-vehicle and LNCaP cells (P < 0.001 for all). Moreover, the up-regulated expression of PSCA protein was detected in the distant metastases of xenograft tumors from all groups.  Conclusions:   Taken together, these observations suggest that PSCA has a promoting role in the growth and metastasis of PCa and siRNA-PSCA may be a potential therapeutic strategy for PSCA-positive PCa.""","""['Zhigang Zhao', 'Jun He', 'Ran Kang', 'Shankun Zhao', 'Luhao Liu', 'Futian Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Small interference RNA-mediated silencing of prostate stem cell antigen attenuates growth, reduces migration and invasion of human prostate cancer PC-3M cells.', 'PSCA regulates IL-6 expression through p38/NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer.', 'PSCA promotes prostate cancer proliferation and cell-cycle progression by up-regulating c-Myc.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen and cancer risk, mechanisms and therapeutic implications.', 'Role of prostate stem cell antigen in prostate cancer research.', 'miR-199b-5p-DDR1-ERK signalling axis suppresses prostate cancer metastasis via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Cancer cell death induced by nanomagnetolectin.', 'Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer Is Mediated by the Kinase NEK6.']"""

We found the upregulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) in human PCa and cultured PCa cells, but not in normal prostates and non-tumorigenic prostate cells. To understand the role of NFATc1 in prostate tumorigenesis in situ, we temporally and spatially controlled the activation of NFATc1 in mouse prostate and showed that such activation resulted in prostatic adenocarcinoma with features similar to those seen in human PCa. Our results indicate that the activation of a single transcription factor, NFATc1 in prostatic luminal epithelium to PCa can affect expression of diverse factors in both cells harboring the genetic changes and in neighboring cells through microenvironmental alterations. In addition to the activation of oncogenes c-MYC and STAT3 in tumor cells, a number of cytokines and growth factors, such as IL1β, IL6 and SPP1 (osteopontin, a key biomarker for PCa), were upregulated in NFATc1-induced PCa, establishing a tumorigenic microenvironment involving both NFATc1 positive and negative cells for prostate tumorigenesis. To further characterize interactions between genes involved in prostate tumorigenesis, we generated mice with both NFATc1 activation and Pten inactivation in prostate. We showed that NFATc1 activation led to acceleration of Pten null-driven prostate tumorigenesis by overcoming the PTEN loss-induced cellular senescence through inhibition of p21 activation. This study provides direct in vivo evidence of an oncogenic role of NFATc1 in prostate tumorigenesis and reveals multiple functions of NFATc1 in activating oncogenes, in inducing proinflammatory cytokines, in oncogene addiction, and in overcoming cellular senescence, which suggests calcineurin-NFAT signaling as a potential target in preventing PCa.""","""['K R Manda', 'P Tripathi', 'A C Hsi', 'J Ning', 'M B Ruzinova', 'H Liapis', 'M Bailey', 'H Zhang', 'C A Maher', 'P A Humphrey', 'G L Andriole', 'L Ding', 'Z You', 'F Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Activation of NFAT signaling establishes a tumorigenic microenvironment through cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms.', 'Down-Regulation of Nfatc1 Suppresses Proliferation, Migration, Invasion, and Warburg Effect in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Klf5 deletion promotes Pten deletion-initiated luminal-type mouse prostate tumors through multiple oncogenic signaling pathways.', 'Role of epithelial mesenchymal transition in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Prostate-Specific G-Protein Coupled Receptor, an Emerging Biomarker Regulating Inflammation and Prostate Cancer Invasion.', 'Thrombin Cleavage of Osteopontin and the Host Anti-Tumor Immune Response.', 'Fibrillin-1 mutation contributes to Marfan syndrome by inhibiting Cav1.2-mediated cell proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells.', 'Expression of the Calcium-Binding Protein CALB1 Is Induced and Controls Intracellular Ca2+ Levels in Senescent Cells.', 'Calcineurin in development and disease.', 'miRNA and lncRNA Expression Networks Modulate Cell Cycle and DNA Repair Inhibition in Senescent Prostate Cells.']"""

Pharmacists are positioned to play a key role in providing patients with the education required to assure an optimal treatment course is carried out.  Methods:   Two cohorts of patients receiving abiraterone, bicalutamide, or enzalutamide for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer seen in our outpatient cancer center 21 months before and 24 months after the implementation of a pharmacist-led oral chemotherapy-monitoring program in December of 2012 were retrospectively compared.

The median time to CRPC of all enrolled patients with ADT was 20.60±1.60 months. The median time to CRPC was 11.20±1.31 months in the CADT group as compared with 22.60±2.08 months in the IADT group. In multivariate analysis, percentage of positive core (p=0.047; hazard ratio [HR], 0.976; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.953-1.000), Gleason score (p=0.007; HR, 1.977; 95% CI, 1.206-3.240), lymph node metastasis (p=0.030; HR, 0.498; 95% CI, 0.265-0.936), bone metastasis (p=0.028; HR, 1.921; 95% CI, 1.072-3.445), and CADT vs. IADT (p=0.003; HR, 0.254; 95% CI. 0.102-0.633) were correlated with the duration of progression to CRPC. The IADT group presented a significantly longer median time to CRPC compared with the CADT group. Additionally, patients in the IADT group showed a longer duration in median time to CRPC in subgroup analysis according to the Gleason score.  Conclusions:   This study found that IADT produces a longer duration in median time to CRPC than does CADT.""","""['Ja Yoon Ku', 'Jeong Zoo Lee', 'Hong Koo Ha']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Korean J Urol""","""['Prognostic value of testosterone during androgene deprivation therapy.', 'Population-based Assessment of Intermittent Androgen Deprivation Therapy Utilization for Relapsed, Nonmetastatic, Hormone-sensitive Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Factors predicting progression to castrate-resistant prostate cancer in patients with advanced prostate cancer receiving long-term androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: translating randomized controlled trials into clinical practice.', 'Intermittent androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: a critical review focused on phase 3 trials.', 'Intermittent, low-dose, antiandrogen monotherapy as an alternative therapeutic option for patients with positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy.']"""

The cancer incidence is different in various countries and in country provinces. Geographical differences in the cancer incidence lead to be important to conduct an epidemiological study of the disease. This study aimed to investigate cancer epidemiology and trend in the province of Qom, located in center of Iran.  Method:   This is an analytical cross-sectional study carried out based on re-analysis cancer registry report and the disease management center of health ministry from 2004 to 2008 in the province of Qom. To describe incidence time trends, we carried out join point regression analysis using the software Join point Regression Program, Version 4.1.1.1.  Results:   There were 3,029 registered cases of cancer during 5 years studied. Sex ratio was 1.32 (male to female). Considering the frequency and mean standardized incidence, the most common cancer in women were breast, skin, colorectal, stomach, and esophagus, respectively while in men the most common cancers included skin, stomach, colorectal, bladder, and prostate, respectively. There was an increasing and significant trend, according to the annual percentage change (APC) equal to 8.08% (CI: 5.1-11.1) for all site cancer in women.  Conclusion:   The incidence trend of all cancers was increasing in this area. Hence, planning for identifying risk factors and performing programs for dealing with the disease are essential.""","""['Hosein Rafiemanesh', 'Narjes Rajaei-Behbahani', 'Yousef Khani', 'Sayedehafagh Hosseini', 'Zahra Pournamdar', 'Abdollah Mohammadian-Hafshejani', 'Shahin Soltani', 'Seyedeh Akram Hosseini', 'Salman Khazaei', 'Hamid Salehiniya']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Glob J Health Sci""","""['Epidemiology and trend of cancers in the province of Kerman: southeast of Iran.', 'Incidence, Trends and Epidemiology of Cancers in North West of Iran.', 'Cancer epidemiology and trends in Sistan and Baluchestan province, Iran.', 'Five common cancers in Iran.', 'A diversity of cancer incidence and mortality in West Asian populations.', 'National and subnational burden of female and male breast cancer and risk factors in Iran from 1990 to 2019: results from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019.', 'Assessing the compliance of educational curricula of selected disciplines with the content standards of cancer-related palliative care.', 'Beliefs, fear and awareness of women about breast cancer: Effects on mammography screening practices.', 'Climate change and health in Iran: a narrative review.', 'Genetic and molecular biology of bladder cancer among Iranian patients.']"""

Aberrant sphingolipid signaling through sphingosine kinases and their product, sphingosine-1-phosphate, can promote proliferation, drug resistance, angiogenesis, and inflammation. The sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitor ABC294640 is undergoing clinical testing in cancer patients, and in this study we investigated the effects this first-in-class inhibitor in castration-resistant prostate cancer. In vitro, ABC294640 decreased prostate cancer cell viability as well as the expression of c-Myc and the androgen receptor, while lysosomal acidification increased. ABC294640 also induced a greater than 3-fold increase in dihydroceramides that inversely correlated with inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase (DEGS) activity. Expression of sphingosine kinase 2 was dispensable for the ABC294640-mediated increase in dihydroceramides. In vivo, ABC294640 diminished the growth rate of TRAMP-C2 xenografts in syngeneic hosts and elevated dihydroceramides within tumors as visualized by MALDI imaging mass spectroscopy. The plasma of ABC294640-treated mice contained significantly higher levels of C16- and C24:1-ceramides (but not dihydro-C16-ceramide) compared with vehicle-treated mice. In summary, our results suggest that ABC294640 may reduce the proliferative capacity of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells through inhibition of both sphingosine kinase 2 and dihydroceramide desaturase, thereby providing a foundation for future exploration of this small-molecule inhibitor for the treatment of advanced disease.""","""['Heather Venant', 'Mehrdad Rahmaniyan', 'E Ellen Jones', 'Ping Lu', 'Michael B Lilly', 'Elizabeth Garrett-Mayer', 'Richard R Drake', 'Jacqueline M Kraveka', 'Charles D Smith', 'Christina Voelkel-Johnson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Proteasomal degradation of sphingosine kinase 1 and inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase by the sphingosine kinase inhibitors, SKi or ABC294640, induces growth arrest in androgen-independent LNCaP-AI prostate cancer cells.', 'ABC294640, a sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitor, enhances the antitumor effects of TRAIL in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Downregulation of Critical Oncogenes by the Selective SK2 Inhibitor ABC294640 Hinders Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Targeting Sphingosine Kinases for the Treatment of Cancer.', 'Sphingosine kinase, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and apoptosis.', 'Irisin Is Target of Sphingosine-1-Phosphate/Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor-Mediated Signaling in Skeletal Muscle Cells.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Sphingosine Kinase 2 in Stromal Fibroblasts Creates a Hospitable Tumor Microenvironment in Breast Cancer.', 'The Sphingosine Kinase 2 Inhibitor Opaganib Protects Against Acute Kidney Injury in Mice.', 'Opaganib Protects against Radiation Toxicity: Implications for Homeland Security and Antitumor Radiotherapy.']"""

We used this cell line to investigate cell cycle modulation and apoptotic cell death induction by flow cytometry, expression of apoptotic proteins by Western blot and apoptotic morphology by visual observation. Tested androstane derivatives affected the cell cycle distribution and induced apoptosis and necrosis. Compounds had different and specific mode of action, depending on derivative type and exposure time. Some compounds induced significant apoptosis measured by Annexin V test compared to reference compound formestane. Higher expression of pro-apoptotic BAX, downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and cleavage of PARP protein were confirmed in almost all treated samples, but the lack of caspase-3 activation suggested the induction of apoptosis in caspase-independent manner. More cells with apoptotic morphology were observed in samples after prolonged treatment.

The analysis also examines how these in turn impact anxiety and depression among older adult, long-term cancer survivors.  Methods:   Data from a longitudinal study of 245 older-adult (age 60+ years), long-term survivors (5 or more years after diagnosis) of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer are examined to identify the measurement properties and structure of general health and cancer-related health worries. Based on that measurement analysis, structural equation models (SEM) are used to estimate the relative importance of cancer-related and other illness predictors on cancer-related worry and general health worry and how these two forms of worry affect both anxiety (POMS) and depression (CES-D).  Results:   The results from the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of health worries identify two relatively independent measures of health worry, one of general health worry and a second of cancer-related worries that includes fears of recurrence, new cancers, and follow-up testing. SEM analyses identified the importance of current cancer-related symptoms and comorbidities on cancer-related worry. It also documents the primacy of non-cancer symptoms and general health worry as predictors of anxiety and depression among older survivors.  Conclusions:   The fact that cancer-related symptoms continue to be associated with cancer-related worries years after diagnosis speaks to the significance of these continuing sequelae. While the findings suggest the relative independence of cancer-related worries and general health worries, both are correlated with anxiety and depression. This may be particularly problematic as survivors age and symptoms related to new health problems increase, while cancer-related symptoms persist.

Reduced levels of circulating androgens, due to andropause or androgen deprivation therapies, alter androgen receptor (AR) coactivator expression. Coactivators shift the balance towards enhanced AR-mediated gene transcription that promotes progression to androgen-resistance. Disruptions in coregulators may represent a molecular switch that reactivates latent bone metastasis. Changes in AR-mediated transcription in androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-resistant C4-2 cells were analyzed for AR coregulator recruitment in co-culture with Saos-2 and THP-1. The Saos-2 cell line derived from human osteosarcoma and THP-1 cell line representing human monocytes were used to display osteoblast and osteoclast activity. Increased AR activity in androgen-resistant C4-2 was due to increased AR expression and SRC1/TIF2 recruitment and decreased SMRT/NCoR expression. AR activity in both cell types was decreased over 90% when co-cultured with Saos-2 or THP-1 due to dissociation of AR from the SRC1/TIF2 and SMRT/NCoR coregulators complex, in a ligand-dependent and cell-type specific manner. In the absence of androgens, Saos-2 decreased while THP-1 increased proliferation of LNCaP cells. In contrast, both Saos-2 and THP-1 decreased proliferation of C4-2 in absence and presence of androgens.

Given that few data exist on patient physician communication with regard to this field of therapy and adherence, we conducted a survey of patient members of a German support organization.  Patients and methods:   We developed a structured questionnaire that was tested in a pilot version and then programmed as an online questionnaire.  Results:   The questionnaire was completed by 694 patients. While 58 % of participants rated the information they received as comprehensive, 42 % did not. Fifty-one percentage stated that they were informed of side effects in detail, and 35 % received information on supportive treatments available in the event of side effects. Patients with higher education more often reported receiving information on side effects (p = 0.036) as well as alternatives for treatment (p = 0.001). Only 13 % stated that their questions were answered in detail, with 43 % receiving no answers or only non-detailed answers. Additional information was sought by 82 %, mostly from the Internet (67 %) and patient support groups (66 %). Seventy-six percentage experienced side effects that imposed limitations on their daily activities. Of those patients with side effects, 60 % reported that their physicians did not react to their complaints. There is a significant association between side effects in general and depression in particular and non-adherence (p < 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively). In contrast, better information on side effects is associated with better adherence (p < 0001).  Conclusion:   In order to improve adherence, detailed information on side effects and comprehensive supportive care is most important.

We examined whether it helps visualize periprostatic microvessels and improves visualization of the neurovascular bundle.  Methods:   We developed a photoacoustic imaging (PAI) system with a hand-held probe combining optical illumination and a conventional linear array ultrasound probe. In experiments with a phantom model, it was able to visualize vessels with diameters as small as 300 μm within a depth of 10 mm. We also developed a TRUS type probe for our photoacoustic imaging system and used it to intraoperatively monitor periprostatic tissues in seven patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer who were undergoing non-nerve-sparing retropubic radical prostatectomy. Images of periprostatic tissues from resected prostatectomy specimens were also obtained using the linear photoacoustic probe, and the consistency of the microvessel distribution and co-existence of nerve fibers was examined by double immunostaining of paraffin-embedded sections with anti-CD31 and anti-S-100 antibodies.  Results:   Intraoperative monitoring of periprostatic tissues with the TRUS photoacoustic probe showed substantial signals on the posterolateral surface of the prostate and clearly demonstrated the location and extent of the neurovascular bundle better than does TRUS alone. Photoacoustic images of the periprostatic tissues in resected specimens also showed substantial signals that were especially strong on the posterolateral surface of the prostate. Nerve fibers were closely co-localized with periprostatic microvessels and the pattern of their distribution was consistent with that of PAI signals.

Methods:   Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after docetaxel were eligible for enrollment. This study was executed as a randomized discontinuation trial. During a lead-in phase of two 28-Day cycles, all patients received saracatinib. Afterward, patients with radiographically stable disease were randomized to either saracatinib or placebo. Patients continued treatment until evidence of new metastasis.

The 70% of patients who progressed after the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade 3 toxicity.

Emerging research and the onset of prostate-specific antigen screening in East Asian countries suggests that this may not be the case. We sought to analyze epidemiology and molecular genetic data and recent trends in the management of prostate cancer among East Asian men.  Methods and materials:   We performed literature searches using PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar to examine current literature on prostate cancer in East Asian men. Additionally, articles were searched for further references related to the topic.  Results:   Recent studies have reported increasing incidence of prostate cancer identified in East Asian men. Prostate cancer mortality has increased and is currently the fourth leading cause of death among men in Shanghai, China. Although prostate cancer was considered less aggressive among East Asian men, studies suggest that it is similarly aggressive to prostate cancer in Western populations. Molecular markers such as the TEMPRESS:ERG fusion gene and PTEN loss may provide novel methods of screening East Asian men for prostate cancer. National-level guidelines for prostate cancer screening and management are only available in Japan.  Conclusions:   The prevalence of prostate cancer in East Asian men is likely similar to that in Western male populations. East Asian men present at higher stages of prostate cancer, likely because of a lack of standardized screening protocols. Urologists in Western countries should screen East Asian men for prostate cancer using the same standards as used for Western men.""","""['M Francesca Monn', 'Alexander J Tatem', 'Liang Cheng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer among East Asian men: Screening and management strategies.', 'Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Prostate cancer: an emerging threat to the health of aging men in Asia.', 'Prostate-specific antigen-based population screening for prostate cancer: current status in Japan and future perspective in Asia.', 'Global Trends and Prostate Cancer: A Review of Incidence, Detection, and Mortality as Influenced by Race, Ethnicity, and Geographic Location.', 'Prostate cancer risk is three-fold higher among men, aged 50-64, of African descent compared with men of Asian-Indian descent in Trinidad and Tobago.', 'Whole-exome sequencing reveals a comprehensive germline mutation landscape and identifies twelve novel predisposition genes in Chinese prostate cancer patients.', 'Different Trends in the Incidence and Mortality Rates of Prostate Cancer Between China and the USA: A Joinpoint and Age-Period-Cohort Analysis.', 'Shh Overexpression Is Correlated with GRP78 and AR Expression in Primary Prostate Cancer: Clinicopathological Features and Outcomes in a Chinese Cohort.', 'Quercetin Enhanced Paclitaxel Therapeutic Effects Towards PC-3 Prostate Cancer Through ER Stress Induction and ROS Production.', 'Interactions between cancer cells and bone microenvironment promote bone metastasis in prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Six radiologists independently reviewed paired 3-T axial T2-weighted high-resolution 2D and 3D FSE endorectal MR images of the prostates of 85 men in two sessions. In the first session (n = 85), each reader selected his or her preferred images; in the second session (n = 28), they determined their confidence in tumor identification and compared the depiction of the prostatic anatomy, tumor conspicuity, and subjective intrinsic image quality of images. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model, logistic regression, and the paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for statistical analyses.  Results:   Three readers preferred the 2D acquisition (67-89%), and the other three preferred the 3D images (70-80%). The option for one of the techniques was not associated with any of the predictor variables.

The aim of this work was identification of potential diagnostic biomarkers for characterization of different types of prostate tumors. NotI-microarrays with 180 clones associated with chromosome 3 genes/loci were applied to determine genetic and epigenetic alterations in 33 prostate tumors. For 88 clones, aberrations were detected in more than 10% of tumors. The major types of alterations were DNA methylation and/or deletions. Frequent methylation of the discovered loci was confirmed by bisulfite sequencing on selective sampling of genes: FGF12, GATA2, and LMCD1. Three genes (BHLHE40, BCL6, and ITGA9) were tested for expression level alterations using qPCR, and downregulation associated with hypermethylation was shown in the majority of tumors.

Maspin, which is also known as mammary serine protease inhibitor, has been suggested to be a valuable focus for targeted cancer therapy. Specifically, maspin has been shown to be upregulated after androgen ablation therapy. Gemcitabine is used as a first-line therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, but its disease control rate is low. Furthermore, the role of maspin in the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine for HIPC remains unclear. The expression levels of maspin in PC-3 and DU145 cells were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Furthermore, the expression of maspin was silenced using shRNA technology to generate maspin-KD cells. The cytotoxicity of gemcitabine to prostate cancer cells was assessed using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-3,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, whereas flow cytometry analyses and annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis assays were used to assess the ability of gemcitabine to induce apoptosis in maspin-KD and control cells. Additionally, the expression patterns of anti-apoptosis proteins (myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)) and pro-apoptosis proteins (Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)) were determined by Western blotting. In this study, PC-3 cells were more resistant to gemcitabine administration than DU145 cells, which correlated with the higher expression levels of maspin observed in PC-3 cells. Furthermore, maspin knockdown enhanced gemcitabine-induced cell death, as evidenced by the increased number of apoptotic cells. Gemcitabine treatment upregulated the levels of anti-apoptosis proteins (Mcl-2 and Bcl-2) in both scrambled control and maspin-KD cells; however, the fold changes in Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expression were larger in gemcitabine-treated scrambled control cells than in maspin-KD cells. Finally, our findings indicate for the first time that maspin may mediate the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine in HIPC. Our results demonstrate that maspin knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells to gemcitabine. Therefore, combining gemcitabine with a drug that targets maspin might constitute a valuable strategy for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Chien-Yu Huang', 'Yu-Jia Chang', 'Sheng-Dean Luo', 'Batzorig Uyanga', 'Feng-Yen Lin', 'Cheng-Jeng Tai', 'Ming-Te Huang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Maspin Enhances the Anticancer Activity of Curcumin in Hormone-refractory Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Contrasting roles of H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 in regulation of apoptosis and gemcitabine resistance in human pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells become sensitive to gemcitabine due to the upregulation of ABCB1.', ""5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine enhances maspin expression and inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of the bladder cancer T24 cell line."", 'Lentinan reduces tumor progression by enhancing gemcitabine chemotherapy in urothelial bladder cancer.', 'Identification of candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for pancreatic carcinoma.', 'Sulforaphane-cysteine-induced apoptosis via phosphorylated ERK1/2-mediated maspin pathway in human non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'Research advances in HMGN5 and cancer.']"""

We aimed to determine whether genes within the five major stress-related signaling pathways are differentially expressed in tumor tissue when comparing prostate cancer patients with lethal and nonlethal disease.  Experimental design:   We measured mRNA expression of 51 selected genes involved in predetermined stress-related signaling pathways (adrenergic, glucocorticoid, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, and muscarinic systems) in tumor tissue and normal prostate tissue collected from prostate cancer patients in the Physicians' Health Study (n = 150; n = 82 with normal) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (n = 254; n = 120 with normal). We assessed differences in pathway expression in relation to prostate cancer lethality as the primary outcome and to biomarkers as secondary outcomes.  Results:   Differential mRNA expression of genes within the adrenergic (P = 0.001), glucocorticoid (P < 0.0001), serotoninergic (P = 0.0019), and muscarinic (P = 0.0045) pathways in tumor tissue was associated with the risk of lethality. The adrenergic pathway was also statistically significant (P = 0.001) when comparing against differential expression of genes not involved in the pathways. In adjacent normal prostate tissue, none of the pathways was clearly differentially expressed between lethal and nonlethal prostate cancer. The glucocorticoid and adrenergic pathways were associated with cell proliferation, while the glucocorticoid pathway was additionally associated with angiogenesis and perineural invasion.  Conclusions:   Our study suggests that stress-related signaling pathways, particularly the adrenergic and glucocorticoid, may be dysregulated in the tumors of men whose prostate cancer proves to be lethal, and motivates further investigation of these pathways in functional studies.""","""['Donghao Lu#', 'Jennifer A Sinnott#', 'Unnur Valdimarsdóttir', 'Fang Fang', 'Travis Gerke', 'Svitlana Tyekucheva', 'Michelangelo Fiorentino', 'Mats Lambe', 'Howard D Sesso', 'Christopher J Sweeney', 'Kathryn M Wilson', 'Edward L Giovannucci', 'Massimo Loda', 'Lorelei A Mucci#', 'Katja Fall#']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Dysregulated stress-related signalling pathways associated with lethality of prostate cancer.', 'Expression and Genetic Variation in Neuroendocrine Signaling Pathways in Lethal and Nonlethal Prostate Cancer among Men Diagnosed with Localized Disease.', 'The Prostate Stromal Transcriptome in Aggressive and Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Beta-adrenergic signaling promotes tumor angiogenesis and prostate cancer progression through HDAC2-mediated suppression of thrombospondin-1.', 'Beta-adrenergic signaling on neuroendocrine differentiation, angiogenesis, and metastasis in prostate cancer progression.', 'β-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'Association of Neighborhood Deprivation With Prostate Cancer and Immune Markers in African American and European American Men.', 'The Role of Perineural Invasion in Prostate Cancer and Its Prognostic Significance.', 'Neuroendocrine pathways and breast cancer progression: a pooled analysis of somatic mutations and gene expression from two large breast cancer cohorts.', 'Gene Expression Pathways in Prostate Tissue Associated with Vigorous Physical Activity in Prostate Cancer.']"""

A molecularly targeted fluorescent probe offers the potential for real-time intraoperative imaging. The goal of this study was to develop a probe for image-guided prostate cancer surgery.  Experimental design:   An antibody fragment (cys-diabody, cDb) against prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) was conjugated to a far-red fluorophore, Cy5. The integrity and binding of the probe to PSCA was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, size exclusion, and flow cytometry, respectively. Subcutaneous models of PSCA-expressing xenografts were used to assess the biodistribution and in vivo kinetics, whereas an invasive intramuscular model was utilized to explore the performance of Cy5-cDb-mediated fluorescence guidance in representative surgical scenarios. Finally, a prospective, randomized study comparing surgical resection with and without fluorescent guidance was performed to determine whether this probe could reduce the incidence of positive margins.  Results:   Cy5-cDb demonstrated excellent purity, stability, and specific binding to PSCA. In vivo imaging showed maximal signal-to-background ratios at 6 hours. In mice carrying PSCA(+) and negative (-) dual xenografts, the mean fluorescence ratio of PSCA(+/-) tumors was 4.4:1. In surgical resection experiments, residual tumors <1 mm that were missed on white light surgery were identified and resected using fluorescence guidance, which reduced the incidence of positive surgical margins (0/8) compared with white light surgery alone (7/7).  Conclusions:   Fluorescently labeled cDb enables real-time in vivo imaging of prostate cancer xenografts in mice, and facilitates more complete tumor removal than conventional white light surgery alone.""","""['Geoffrey A Sonn', 'Andrew S Behesnilian', 'Ziyue Karen Jiang', 'Kirstin A Zettlitz', 'Eric J Lepin', 'Laurent A Bentolila', 'Scott M Knowles', 'Daniel Lawrence', 'Anna M Wu', 'Robert E Reiter']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Surgical Guidance in Prostate Cancer: ""From Molecule to Man"" Translations.', 'Dual-Modality ImmunoPET/Fluorescence Imaging of Prostate Cancer with an Anti-PSCA Cys-Minibody.', 'Dual-Modality Immuno-PET and Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of Pancreatic Cancer Using an Anti-Prostate Stem Cell Antigen Cys-Diabody.', 'Near-Infrared Dye-Labeled Anti-Prostate Stem Cell Antigen Minibody Enables Real-Time Fluorescence Imaging and Targeted Surgery in Translational Mouse Models.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen and cancer risk, mechanisms and therapeutic implications.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: a Jekyll and Hyde molecule?', 'Dispersion Performances of Naphthalimides Doped in Dual Temperature- and pH-Sensitive Poly (N-Isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic Acid) Shell Assembled with Vinyl-Modified Mesoporous SiO2 Core for Fluorescence Cell Imaging.', 'On-demand radiosynthesis of N-succinimidyl-4-18Ffluorobenzoate (18FSFB) on an electrowetting-on-dielectric microfluidic chip for 18F-labeling of protein.', 'Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of EGFR-Overexpressing Tumors in the Mouse Xenograft Model Using scFv-IRDye800CW and Cetuximab-IRDye800CW.', 'Fluorescence Molecular Targeting of Colon Cancer to Visualize the Invisible.', 'Tri-functional platform for construction of modular antibody fragments for in vivo 18F-PET or NIRF molecular imaging.']"""

Thus, unveiling the mechanism regulating CSCs and candidate target molecules will provide new strategy to cure the patients.  Experimental design:   The stem-like cell properties were determined by a prostasphere assay and dye exclusion assay. To find critical stem cell marker and reveal regulation mechanism, basic biochemical and molecular biologic methods, such as quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, reporter gene assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, were used. In addition, to determine the effect of combination therapy targeting both CSCs and its progeny, in vitro MTT assay and in vivo xenograft model was used.  Results:   We demonstrate immortalized normal human prostate epithelial cells, appeared nontumorigenic in vivo, become tumorigenic, and acquire stem cell phenotype after knocking down a tumor suppressor gene. Also, those stem-like cells increase chemoresistance to conventional anticancer reagent. Mechanistically, we unveil that Wnt signaling is a key pathway regulating well-known stem cell marker CD44 by directly interacting to the promoter. Thus, by targeting CSCs using Wnt inhibitors synergistically enhances the efficacy of conventional drugs. Furthermore, the in vivo mouse model bearing xenografts showed a robust inhibition of tumor growth after combination therapy.

We aim to evaluate the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after brachytherapy, which so far remains unknown in this population.  Methods and materials:   From 2005 to 2013, 371 patients received (125)I brachytherapy of 145 Gy for early-stage prostate cancer. Eligibility criteria were cTNM ≤T2c, Gleason score ≤7, and initial PSA ≤15 ng/mL. Pretreatment androgen deprivation therapy was allowed. PSA bounce was defined as an increase of ≥0.4 ng/mL, lasting ≥6 months, followed by a decrease without any anticancer therapy. We examined PSA kinetics during followup.  Results:   For the 274 patients with at least 24 months followup, median age was 62 years old (range, 45-76). Initial PSA was <10 ng/mL in 244 and 10-15 ng/mL in 30 patients; 40 received androgen deprivation therapy. With a median followup of 50 months (range, 24-125), PSA declined continuously in 168 (61%) patients, bounced in 87 (31%), and initially declined and then rose in 22 (8%) patients. Among these latter patients, 18 presented clinical recurrence. Mean bounce intensity was 2.0 ng/mL (median, 1.2; range, 0.4-12.4). Bounces occurred in average 12 months after brachytherapy. Patients with bounce were significantly younger: mean age 59 vs. 63 years old in patients without bounce, p <0.001. Bounce was also significantly associated with the immediate post-brachytherapy PSA, mean 4.0 among bounce cases vs. 2.9 among non-bounce cases, p < 0.001. Bounce was not associated with recurrence.

Objective:   To comprehensively map miRNA regulation of genes relevant for PCa proliferation through phenotypic screening and tumor expression data.  Design, setting, and participants:   Gain-of-function screening with 1129 miRNA molecules was performed in five PCa cell lines, measuring proliferation, viability, and apoptosis. These results were integrated with changes in miRNA expression from two cohorts of human PCa (188 tumors in total). For resulting miRNAs, the predicted targets were collected and analyzed for patterns with gene set enrichment analysis, and for their association with biochemical recurrence free survival.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Rank product statistical analysis was used to evaluate miRNA effects in phenotypic screening and for expression differences in the prostate tumor cohorts. Expression data were analyzed using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method and the patient material was subjected to Kaplan-Meier statistics.  Results and limitations:   Functional screening identified 25 miRNAs increasing and 48 miRNAs decreasing cell viability. Data integration resulted in 14 miRNAs, with aberrant expression and effect on proliferation. These miRNAs are predicted to regulate >3700 genes, of which 28 were found up-regulated and 127 down-regulated in PCa compared with benign tissue. Seven genes, FLNC, MSRB3, PARVA, PCDH7, PRNP, RAB34, and SORBS1, showed an inverse association to their predicted miRNA, and were identified to significantly correlate with biochemical recurrence free survival in PCa patients.  Conclusions:   A systematic in vitro screening approach combined with in vivo expression and gene set enrichment analysis provide unbiased means for revealing novel miRNA-target links, possibly driving the oncogenic processes in PCa.

A vast number of replicates of probe pairs representing both alleles of SNPs on 14 loci allows accurate estimation of the difference in signal intensities both within and between probe pairs. The majority of probe-pairs with sufficiently high expression have significant differences in expression levels within the pair and the difference shows concordance with the genotype of the samples. With two or more replicates of each probe, the allele-to-allele variance dominates the error in estimating the difference within the probe-pair, ten replicates are needed for adequate power in calling a true difference within a single probe-pair. Using the expression level of the probe within the probe-pair that has the higher value gives more accurate estimates. When using probes at loci containing known SNP's one should use probes containing both alleles of the SNP.""","""['Sigrun Helga Lund', 'Asgeir Sigurdsson', 'Sigurjon Axel Gudjonsson', 'Julius Gudmundsson', 'Daniel Fannar Gudbjartsson', 'Thorunn Rafnar', 'Kari Stefansson', 'Gunnar Stefansson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Data Min Bioinform""","""['Hybridization modeling of oligonucleotide SNP arrays for accurate DNA copy number estimation.', 'Detecting imbalanced expression of SNP alleles by minisequencing on microarrays.', 'A multi-array multi-SNP genotyping algorithm for Affymetrix SNP microarrays.', 'Allelotyping of pooled DNA with 250 K SNP microarrays.', 'Single-nucleotide polymorphism masking.']"""

Results from a National Survey""","""Most professional organizations, including the American College of Physicians and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, emphasize that screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test should only occur after a detailed discussion between the health-care provider and patient about the known risks and potential benefits of the test. In fact, guidelines strongly advise health-care providers to involve patients, particularly those at elevated risk of prostate cancer, in a ""shared decision making"" (SDM) process about PSA testing. We analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey 2011-2012-a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey-to examine the extent to which health professionals provided men with information critical to SDM prior to PSA testing, including (1) that patients had a choice about whether or not to undergo PSA testing, (2) that not all doctors recommend PSA testing, and (3) that no one is sure if PSA testing saves lives. Over half (55 %) of men between the ages of 50 and 74 reported ever having had a PSA test. However, only 10 % of men, regardless of screening status, reported receiving all three pieces of information: 55 % reported being informed that they could choose whether or not to undergo testing, 22 % reported being informed that some doctors recommend PSA testing and others do not, and 14 % reported being informed that no one is sure if PSA testing actually saves lives. Black men and men with lower levels of education were less likely to be provided this information. There is a need to improve patient-provider communication about the uncertainties associated with the PSA test.

Objective:   The objectives were to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of TAK-385 on LH and testosterone.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a three-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose-escalation study in 176 healthy male UK volunteers.  Interventions:   Part 1, single doses of TAK-385 (0 [placebo], 80, 120, 180, or 360 mg). Part 2, 14-day TAK-385 (0, 20, 40, 80, or 180 mg) daily. Part 3, 28-day TAK-385 (40 [with loading dose], 60, 80, or 160 mg) or placebo daily. Parts 2 and 3 included men aged 40-75 years.  Main outcome measures:   Main outcome measures included plasma concentrations of TAK-385, LH, and testosterone.  Results:   Oral TAK-385 was readily absorbed, and steady state was reached in ≤ 14 days. Food reduced TAK-385 systemic exposure by 47-52%. Mean serum testosterone levels declined ≤ 6 hours after TAK-385 administration. Loading doses up to 360 mg on day 1 or 360 mg on day 1 followed by 240 mg on day 2 reduced the time to achieve castrate testosterone levels from ≥ 7 to <3 days. TAK-385 doses ≥ 80 mg/d achieved sustained medical castration and trough TAK-385 concentrations >4 ng/mL. After discontinuation of TAK-385 on day 28, testosterone levels normalized in most subjects in ≤ 28 days. Common adverse events included bradycardia, headache, and hot flush (all grade ≤ 2).

Methods:   A total of 242 cases of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for patients with localized prostate cancer were considered for this study. Each novice surgeon carried out a step-by-step robot-assisted radical prostatectomy procedure by following technical checkpoints and time limits that were established on the basis of previous surgical performance by a mentor. If technical checkpoints could not be accomplished, or the times were being exceeded, a mentor replaced the novice surgeon to finish the operative step or the surgery. Furthermore, if total blood loss exceeded 500 mL, a mentor completed the surgery. The primary end-point was the number of cases required for a new surgeon to successfully complete the entire robot-assisted radical prostatectomy procedure. Clinicopathological outcomes and any cases that deviated more than the standard deviation were also analyzed.  Results:   Median patient age, serum prostate-specific antigen level (ng/mL), and Gleason score at diagnosis were 68 years, 7.6 and 7, respectively.

Objective:   To evaluate racial disparities in the use, quality of care, and outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP) in elderly men (≥ 65 years) with nonmetastatic PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective analysis of outcomes stratified according to race (black vs non-Hispanic white) included 2020 elderly black patients (7.6%) and 24,462 elderly non-Hispanic white patients (92.4%) with localized PCa who underwent RP within the first year of PCa diagnosis in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database between 1992 and 2009. The study was performed in 2014.  Main outcomes and measures:   Process of care (ie, time to treatment, lymph node dissection), as well as outcome measures (ie, complications, emergency department visits, readmissions, PCa-specific and all-cause mortality, costs) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Multivariable conditional logistic regression and quantile regression were used to study the association of racial disparities with process of care and outcome measures.  Results:   The proportion of black patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent RP within 90 days was 59.4% vs 69.5% of non-Hispanic white patients (P < 001). In quantile regression of the top 50% of patients, blacks had a 7-day treatment delay compared with non-Hispanic whites. (P < 001). Black patients were less likely to undergo lymph node dissection (odds ratio [OR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.66-0.80]; P < .001) but had higher odds of postoperative visits to the emergency department (within 30 days: OR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.18-1.86]); after 30 days or more (OR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.19-1.76]) and readmissions (within 30 days: OR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.02-1.61]); ≥ 30 days (OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.07-1.51]) compared with non-Hispanic whites. The surgical treatment of black patients was associated with a higher incremental annual cost (the top 50% of blacks spent $1185.50 (95% CI , $804.85-1 $1566.10; P < .001) more than the top 50% of non-Hispanic whites). There was no difference in PCa-specific mortality (P = .16) or all-cause mortality (P = .64) between black and non-Hispanic white men.

As yet, there are no validated descriptions of prostate cancer subgroups derived from integrated genomics linked with clinical outcome.  Methods:   In a study of 482 tumour, benign and germline samples from 259 men with primary prostate cancer, we used integrative analysis of copy number alterations (CNA) and array transcriptomics to identify genomic loci that affect expression levels of mRNA in an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) approach, to stratify patients into subgroups that we then associated with future clinical behaviour, and compared with either CNA or transcriptomics alone.  Findings:   We identified five separate patient subgroups with distinct genomic alterations and expression profiles based on 100 discriminating genes in our separate discovery and validation sets of 125 and 103 men. These subgroups were able to consistently predict biochemical relapse (p = 0.0017 and p = 0.016 respectively) and were further validated in a third cohort with long-term follow-up (p = 0.027). We show the relative contributions of gene expression and copy number data on phenotype, and demonstrate the improved power gained from integrative analyses. We confirm alterations in six genes previously associated with prostate cancer (MAP3K7, MELK, RCBTB2, ELAC2, TPD52, ZBTB4), and also identify 94 genes not previously linked to prostate cancer progression that would not have been detected using either transcript or copy number data alone. We confirm a number of previously published molecular changes associated with high risk disease, including MYC amplification, and NKX3-1, RB1 and PTEN deletions, as well as over-expression of PCA3 and AMACR, and loss of MSMB in tumour tissue.

Presently, there are no effective therapies against IBC and a paucity of model systems. Our aim was to develop a clinically relevant IBC model that would allow investigations on the role of chemokine receptors in IBC metastasis. Primary cultures of tumor cells were isolated from pleural exudates of an IBC patient and grown as spheres or monolayers. We developed a human xenograft model where patient-derived IBC cells, stably transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing fluorescent and bioluminescent markers, were inoculated directly into the left ventricle of mice. Our in vivo data show that these IBC cells (FC-IBC02A) are able to seed and proliferate into various organs, including brain, lungs, lymph nodes, and bone, closely replicating the metastatic spread observed in IBC patients. Moreover, cells were able to generate tumors when grafted in the mammary fat pad of mice. RT-PCR and microscopy studies revealed expression of both CXCR4 and ACKR3 receptors in FC-IBC02A cells. Furthermore, CXCL12 (the endogenous chemokine ligand of these receptors) induced transendothelial migration of these cells and stimulated signaling pathways involved in cell survival and migration - an effect reduced by CXCR4 or ACKR3 antagonists. This new model can be used to develop chemokine-based pharmacological approaches against the IBC metastatic process.

Interest in proton beams has increased due to superior normal-tissue sparing they afford. Our goal was to dosimetrically compare 3D conformal proton boost plans with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans with respect to target coverage and avoiding organs at risk.  Methods:   Treatment planning computer tomography scans of ten patients were selected. For each patient, two hypothetical but realistic GTVs each with a fixed volume were contoured in different anatomical locations of the prostate. IMRT and proton beam plans were created with a prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy to the initial planning target volume (PTV) including the PTV of the seminal vesicles (PSV), 70.2 Gy to the PTV of the prostate (PPS), and 90 Gy to the PTV of the gross tumor volumes (PGTVs). For proton plans, uncertainties of range and patient setup were accounted for; apertures were adjusted until the dose-volume coverage of PTVs matched that of the IMRT plan. For both plans, prescribed PTV doses were made identical to allow for comparing normal-tissue doses.  Results:   Protons delivered more homogeneous but less conformal doses to PGTVs than IMRT did and comparable doses to PSV and PPS. Volumes of bladder and rectum receiving doses higher than 65 Gy were similar for both plans. However, volumes receiving less than 65 Gy were significantly reduced, i.e., protons reduced integral dose by 45.6 % and 26.5 % for rectum and bladder, respectively. This volume-sparing was also seen in femoral heads and penile bulb.  Conclusions:   Protons delivered comparable doses to targets in dose homogeneity and conformity and spared normal tissues from intermediate-to-low doses better than IMRT did. Further improvement of dose sparing and changes in homogeneity and conformity may be achieved by reducing proton range uncertainties and from implementing intensity modulation.""","""['Inhwan Yeo', 'Prashanth Nookala', 'Ian Gordon', 'Reinhard Schulte', 'Stanley Barnes', 'Abiel Ghebremedhin', 'Ning Wang', 'Gary Yang', 'Ted Ling', 'David Bush', 'Jerry Slater', 'Baldev Patyal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Radiotherapy treatment of early-stage prostate cancer with IMRT and protons: a treatment planning comparison.', 'Assessment of different IMRT boost delivery methods on target coverage and normal-tissue sparing.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Dosimetric study of pelvic proton radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Global democratisation of proton radiotherapy.', 'A treatment planning study of urethra-sparing intensity-modulated proton therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'A biological modelling based comparison of radiotherapy plan robustness using photons vs protons for focal prostate boosting.', 'Stability of daily rectal movement and effectiveness of replanning protocols for sparing rectal doses based on the daily CT images during proton treatment for prostate cancer.', 'A planning study of focal dose escalations to multiparametric MRI-defined dominant intraprostatic lesions in prostate proton radiation therapy.', 'Long-term outcomes of proton therapy for prostate cancer in Japan: a multi-institutional survey of the Japanese Radiation Oncology Study Group.']"""

Here, we aimed to explore the role of PDLIM2 and the effect of the PDLIM2 gene suppression on oncogenic phenotypes of human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-like cells.  Methods:   We used human CRPC-like cell lines (PC3, DU145, and C4-2B) for our experiments. Transcription levels of PDLIM2 and relevant genes were measured by real time-PCR and protein expression was analyzed by western blot. Cell viability, proliferation, clonogenic growth, and tumor sphere formation were examined after a specific inhibition of PDLIM2 using RNA interference. Flow cytometry was used to examine apoptotic cell death and cell cycle disturbances. Wound healing and transwell migration assays were performed to investigate the invasion capabilities of CRPC-like cells. Additionally, key oncogenic signaling pathways were examined using western blot. Lastly, we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of PDLIM2 suppression on tumor growth of human CRPC xenografts in mice.  Results:   We observed a significant enhancement of PDLIM2 expression in human CRPC-like cell lines, while a specific inhibition of PDLIM2 reduced cell viability and proliferation due to apoptotic cell death. Conversely, PDLIM2 overexpression significantly reduced cell proliferation compared to the negative control in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Moreover, PDLIM2 suppression led to a decrease of clonogenic growth and tumor sphere formation in three-dimensional cultures with the G2/M cell cycle arrest in human CRPC-like cells. PDLIM2 inhibition also attenuated cellular migration and invasion capabilities of human CRPC-like cells, and reduced the expression of mesenchymal marker. Among several oncogenic signaling pathways, only the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade was decreased by PDLIM2 inhibition and reciprocally, ERK inhibition down-regulated PDLIM2 expression. Importantly, PDLIM2 inhibition remarkably compromised tumor growth in a human CRPC xenograft model.  Conclusion:   In summary, the suppression of PDLIM2 significantly reduced such oncogenic phenotypes as proliferation, clonogenicity, invasiveness, and tumor cell growth in human CRPC-like cells both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that PDLIM2 may be considered a novel therapeutic target gene for treating human CRPC.""","""['Minyong Kang', 'Kyoung-Hwa Lee', 'Hye Sun Lee', 'Yong Hyun Park', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Ja Hyeon Ku', 'Hyeon Hoe Kim', 'Cheol Kwak']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['S100A3 suppression inhibits in vitro and in vivo tumor growth and invasion of human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Suppression of LIM and SH3 Domain Protein 1 (LASP1) Negatively Regulated by Androgen Receptor Delays Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'NPRL2 enhances autophagy and the resistance to Everolimus in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PDLIM2 and Its Role in Oncogenesis--Tumor Suppressor or Oncoprote?.', 'TCTP Has a Crucial Role in the Different Stages of Prostate Cancer Malignant Progression.', 'Pyrogallol from Spirogyra neglecta Inhibits Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells via Modulating Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin Signaling Pathway.', 'Tsc2 mutation rather than Tsc1 mutation dominantly causes a social deficit in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex.', 'High Expression of PDLIM2 Predicts a Poor Prognosis in Prostate Cancer and Is Correlated with Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Immune Cell Infiltration.', 'Systematic evaluation of the prognostic and immunological role of PDLIM2 across 33 cancer types.', 'Kruppel like factor 10 up-regulates PDZ and LIM domain containing protein 2 via nuclear factor kappa-B pathway to inhibit proliferation and inflammatory of fibroblastoid synovial cell in rheumatoid arthritis.']"""

In this study, we found that CAFs could induce prostate cancer cell EMT and invasion through a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway, which exploits reactive oxygen species (ROS) to drive a migratory and aggressive phenotype of prostate carcinoma cells.

When injected subcutaneously into male athymic nude mice, LNCaP and its derivatives rarely metastasize.

JHU-LNCaP-SM cells express the same mutated androgen receptor (AR) but unlike LNCaP, are no longer androgen dependent for growth. The cells demonstrate an attenuated androgen responsiveness in transcriptional assays and retain androgen sensitive expression of PSA, AR, and PSMA. Unlike parental LNCaP, JHU-LNCaP-SM cells quickly form subcutaneous tumors in male athymic nude mice, reliably metastasize to the lymph nodes and display a striking intra-tumoral and spreading hemorrhagic phenotype as tumor xenografts.

This pattern has never been validated in the setting of intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD). Objective is to analyze the prognostic significance for PCa of recurrent patterns in PSA kinetics in patients undergoing IAD.  Methods:   A retrospective study was conducted on 377 patients treated with IAD. On-treatment period (ONTP) consisted of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist injections combined with oral androgen receptor antagonist. Off-treatment period (OFTP) began when PSA was lower than 4 ng/ml. ONTP resumed when PSA was higher than 20 ng/ml. PSA values of each OFTP were fitted with three basic patterns: exponential (PSA(t) = λ.e(αt)), linear (PSA(t) = a.t), and power law (PSA(t) = a.t(c)). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression model analyzed predictive factors for oncologic outcomes.  Results:   Only 45% of the analyzed OFTPs were exponential. Linear and power law PSA kinetics represented 7.5% and 7.7%, respectively. Remaining fraction of analyzed OFTPs (40%) exhibited complex kinetics. Exponential PSA kinetics during the first OFTP was significantly associated with worse oncologic outcome. The estimated 10-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 46% for exponential versus 80% for nonexponential PSA kinetics patterns. The corresponding 10-year probability of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) was 69% and 31% for the two patterns, respectively.

The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of clinicians with using EPIC-26 in a clinical setting for patients receiving curative radiotherapy.  Methods:   Ten clinicians reviewed EPIC-26 scores either before or during weekly clinical encounters with patients receiving curative radiation treatment for prostate cancer. After a period of 2 months, clinicians underwent individual semi-structured interviews where they were asked about their views on measuring patient-reported outcomes in practice, the value of EPIC-26, impressions on patient acceptability, and operational issues.  Results:   There was a general willingness and acceptance by clinicians to use EPIC-26 for routine clinical practice. Clinician participants found EPIC-26 to be generally informative, and added value to the clinical encounter by providing additional information that was specific to prostate cancer patients. EPIC-26 was also felt to improve overall communication and provide additional insight into the patient experience.

It was initially believed that PR was a useful diagnostic marker of estrogen receptor activity, but increasingly PR has been recognised to play an important biological role in breast homeostasis, carcinogenesis and metastasis. Although PR expression is almost exclusively observed in estrogen receptor positive tumors, few studies have investigated the cellular mechanisms of PR action in the context of ongoing estrogen signalling.  Methods:   In this study, we contrast PR function in estrogen pretreated ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells with vehicle treated ZR-75-1 and T-47D breast cancer cells using expression microarrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing.  Results:   Estrogen cotreatment caused a dramatic increase in the number of genes regulated by progesterone in ZR-75-1 cells. In T-47D cells that have naturally high levels of PR, estrogen and progesterone cotreatment resulted in a reduction in the number of regulated genes in comparison to treatment with either hormone alone. At a genome level, estrogen pretreatment of ZR-75-1 cells led to a 10-fold increase in the number of PR DNA binding sites detected using ChIP-sequencing. Time course assessment of progesterone regulated genes in the context of estrogen pretreatment highlighted a series of important regulatory pathways, including those driven by epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR). Importantly, progesterone applied to cells pretreated with estradiol resulted in switching of the PAM50-determined intrinsic breast cancer subtype from Luminal A to Basal-like, and increased the Oncotype DX® Unscaled Recurrence Score.  Conclusion:   Estrogen pretreatment of breast cancer cells increases PR steady state levels, resulting in an unequivocal progesterone response that upregulates key members of growth factor pathways.

These structural alterations result from histone posttranslation modifications such as acetylation and methylation on key arginine and lysine residues, or by alterations to DNA methylation. Other known epigenetic mechanisms invoke histone variant exchange or utilize noncoding RNAs (lncRNA/miRNA). Drugs which can target the epigenetic regulatory machinery are currently undergoing clinical trials in a wide variety of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Here we describe RNA isolation and the subsequent Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) methods, post-epigenetic drug treatment, to identify genes, which may be responsive to such epigenetic targeting agents. In addition, we depict a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to determine the association between chromatin transcription markers and DNA following pretreatment of cell cultures with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDi). This assay allows us to determine whether treatment with an HDi dynamically remodels the promoter region of genes, as judged by the differences in the PCR product between our treated and untreated samples.

Our studies demonstrated that carcinogens disrupt the circadian expression of circadian genes (CGs) and circadian-controlled genes (CCGs) during the early stages of rat mammary carcinogenesis. A chemopreventive regimen of methylselenocysteine (MSC) restored the circadian expression of CGs and CCGs, including PERIOD 2 (PER2) and estrogen receptor β (ERS2), to normal. The present study evaluated whether changes in CG and CCG expression in whole blood can serve as indicators of circadian disruption in shift workers.  Methods:   Fifteen shift workers were recruited to a crossover study. Blood samples were drawn before (6 PM) and after (8 AM) completing a night shift after at least seven days on floating night-shift rotation, and before (8 AM), during (1 PM), and after (6 PM) completing seven days on day shift. The plasma melatonin level and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of PER2, nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group d, member 1 (NR1D1), and ERS2 were measured, and the changes in levels of melatonin and gene expression were evaluated with statistical analyses.  Results:   The mRNA expression of PER2 was affected by shift (p = 0.0079); the levels were higher in the evening for the night shift, but higher in the morning for the day shift. Increased PER2 expression (p = 0.034) was observed in the evening on the night versus day shifts. The melatonin level was higher in the morning for both day shifts (p = 0.013) and night shifts (p <0.0001).  Conclusion:   Changes in the level of PER2 gene expression can serve as a biomarker of disrupted circadian rhythm in blood cells. Therefore, they can be a useful intermediate indicator of efficacy in future MSC-mediated chemoprevention studies.""","""['Ming Zhu Fang', 'Pamela Ohman-Strickland', 'Kathie Kelly-McNeil', 'Howard Kipen', 'Benjamin F Crabtree', 'Jenny Pan Lew', 'Helmut Zarbl']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sleep Med""","""['Length polymorphism in the Period 3 gene is associated with sleepiness and maladaptive circadian phase in night-shift workers.', 'Circadian phase, sleepiness, and light exposure assessment in night workers with and without shift work disorder.', 'A compromise phase position for permanent night shift workers: circadian phase after two night shifts with scheduled sleep and light/dark exposure.', 'Impacts of shift work on sleep and circadian rhythms.', 'Measuring Light at Night and Melatonin Levels in Shift Workers: A Review of the Literature.', 'Circadian Rhythm Disruption as a Contributor to Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer.', 'Circadian Rhythms Within the Female HPG Axis: From Physiology to Etiology.', 'Relationship between Night Shifts and Risk of Breast Cancer among Nurses: A Systematic Review.', 'Chronotype and social jetlag influence human circadian clock gene expression.', 'Rapid resetting of human peripheral clocks by phototherapy during simulated night shift work.']"""

Cancer screening behaviors were assessed via self-report. Perceived discrimination was measured using the Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaire. Confounder-adjusted multivariable polytomous logistic regression models assessed the association between perceived discrimination and adherence to cancer screening guidelines.  Results:   Among women eligible for screening, 72.1 % were adherent to cervical cancer screening guidelines and 71.3 %were adherent to breast cancer screening guidelines. In participants aged 50–74, 24.6 % of women and 27.0 % of men were adherent to fecal occult blood test guidelines; 43.5 % of women and 34.8 % of men were adherent to colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy guidelines; 41.0 % of men were adherent to prostate-specific antigen screening guidelines. Health insurance coverage, rather than perceived ethnic discrimination,was the variable most associated with receiving breast, cervical,colorectal, or prostate cancer screening.

As part of a hospital-based case-control study of the Singaporean male population, we investigated associations between organohalogen exposure and risk of prostate cancer. Trace residue concentrations of 74 organohalogen contaminants, including several PCBs, OCPs and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), were determined in serum samples (n = 120) using gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). A variety of OCPs, PCBs and HFRs were detected in samples of both patients and controls. Mean concentrations of p,p' DDT, p,p' DDE, PCB 118, PCB 138, PCB 153 and PCB 187 were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in serum of patients. p,p' DDE measured in serum of patients was relatively high (mean:13,700 ng/g lipid, 95% CI:7000-26,800). Odds ratios (ORs) of OCPs and PCBs in many cases exceeded 1. ORs for p,p' DDE and PCB-153 at the highest tertile (>67th) were 5.67 (95% CI, 2.37-13.54) and 2.14 (95% CI, 0.99 to 4.66), respectively. The results suggest that exposure to DDTs and PCBs may be associated with prostate cancer risk in Singaporean males. No such association was observed for the organohalogen flame retardants studied, including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The study provides novel information regarding the occurrence, levels and potential associations with prostate cancer risk for several organohalogen contaminants in the Singapore population.

Material and methods:   This was a French multicentre prospective study that included 93 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at least 1 year before Surgimesh M-SLING(®) implantation for the treatment of PPI. Data were collected preoperatively, and patients were followed at 3, 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Objective outcome measures included number of pads per day, 24-h pad-test, maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax ) and urinary retention. We also analysed Urinary Symptom Profile (USP(®) ) score, degree of erectile dysfunction, patients' satisfaction level, postoperative pain and procedure complications. Length of catheterization and hospitalization periods were also recorded. Patients were considered cured if no protection was used and/or daily pad weight was <2 g. Patients whose condition was considered to have improved reduced their daily urinary losses by >50%. Those not included in any of the aforementioned groups were assessed as unchanged or to have deteriorated, and were considered as treatment failures.  Results:   The mean hospitalization period was 1.57 ± 0.70 days. All patients remained catheterized for 1.17 ± 0.48 days. Intention-to-treat analysis at 24 months showed that 34.4% of patients were cured, 27.1% had improved, and 19.4% were considered failures. Two patients experienced transient urinary retention. USP questionnaire scores showed a significant decrease in incontinence and prevalence of hyperactive bladder. There was a nonsignificant tendency for reduced severe erectile dysfunction (ED), and a shift towards moderate ED was observed. No severe complications occurred.

Objective:   To test the impact of PSA level on cancer control after eSRT according to pathologic tumour characteristics.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 716 node-negative patients with undetectable postoperative PSA who experienced a PSA rise after RP. All patients received eSRT, defined as local radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicle bed, delivered at PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/ml. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after eSRT was defined as two consecutive PSA values ≥ 0.2 ng/ml.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable Cox regression analysis tested the association between pre-eSRT PSA level and BCR after eSRT. Covariates consisted of pathologic stage (pT2 vs pT3a vs pT3b or higher), pathologic Gleason score (≤ 6, 7, or ≥ 8), and surgical margin status (negative vs positive). We tested an interaction with PSA level and baseline pathologic risk for the hypothesis that BCR-free survival differed by pre-eSRT PSA level. Three pathologic risk factors were identified: pathologic stage pT3b or higher, pathologic Gleason score ≥ 8, and negative surgical margins.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up among patients who did not experience BCR after eSRT was 57 mo (interquartile range: 27-105). At 5 yr after eSRT, BCR-free survival rate was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78-85). At multivariable Cox regression analysis, pre-eSRT PSA level was significantly associated with BCR after eSRT (hazard ratio: 4.89; 95% CI, 1.40-22.9; p < 0.0001). When patients were stratified according to the number of risk factors at final pathology, patients with at least two pathologic risk factors showed an increased risk of 5-yr BCR as high as 10% per 0.1 ng/ml of PSA level compared with only 1.5% in patients with one or no pathologic risk factors.  Conclusions:   In this retrospective study, cancer control after eSRT greatly depended on pretreatment PSA. The absolute PSA level had a different prognostic value depending on the pathologic characteristics of the tumour. In patients with more adverse pathologic features, eSRT conferred better cancer control when administered at the very first sign of PSA rise. Conversely, the benefit of eSRT was less evident in men with favourable disease at RP.  Patient summary:   In this retrospective study, cancer control after early salvage radiation therapy (eSRT) was influenced by pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. This effect was highest in men with at least two of the following pathologic features: pT3b/pT4 disease, pathologic Gleason score ≥ 8, and negative surgical margins.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate the OS prognostic ability of RECIST changes after adjusting for prognostic factors. In the VENICE trial, the OS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.99; p=0.045) for patients with a partial response (PR) compared to those without PR, and 1.78 (95% CI 1.07-2.95; p=0.026) for those with progressive disease (PD) compared to those without PD. After adjusting for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes, PD remained significant (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.10-3.12; p=0.020). Data from the MAINSAIL trial corroborated the association of PR (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22-1.18; p=0.12) and PD (HR 3.51, 95% CI 1.92-6.43; p<0.001) with OS. After adjusting for PSA changes, PD was associated with poor OS (HR 2.36, 95% CI 1.11-5.04; p=0.026). Given the association between RECIST changes and OS, more frequent detection of measurable disease with current imaging techniques, and the poor reliability of bone scan and PSA changes, assessment of RECIST changes on treatment with novel agents in patients with measurable tumors may provide an objective signal of efficacy.  Patient summary:   In this study, we found an association between changes in objectively measurable tumors according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer receiving docetaxel chemotherapy. Since bone scan and prostate-specific antigen changes are unreliable and measurable tumors are more frequently detected now because of better radiographic technology, a focus on RECIST changes should be considered during drug development to provide an objective signal of efficacy.""","""['Guru Sonpavde', 'Gregory R Pond', 'Arnoud J Templeton', 'Abderrahim Fandi', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Mark Rosenthal', 'Andrew J Armstrong', 'Daniel P Petrylak']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Validation of the Association of RECIST Changes With Survival in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated on SWOG Study S0421.', 'Integration of Bone and Computed Tomography Scans to Assess Bone Metastasis in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiographic progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-2 criteria as an intermediate endpoint for drug development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Second-line treatment options in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a comparison of key trials with recently approved agents.', 'Effect of Single-agent Daily Prednisone on Outcomes and Toxicities in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Pooled Analysis of Prospective Studies.', 'Current and potential future role of PSMA-PET in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Validation of the Association of RECIST Changes With Survival in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated on SWOG Study S0421.', 'Prevalence of Measurable Disease in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'METastasis Reporting and Data System for Prostate Cancer: Practical Guidelines for Acquisition, Interpretation, and Reporting of Whole-body Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Evaluations of Multiorgan Involvement in Advanced Prostate Cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   Cancer stage, age, and year of diagnosis were obtained for all men aged >50 years diagnosed with prostate cancer in Norway during the period 1980-2010. Three calendar-time periods (1980-1989, 1990-2000, and 2001-2010) and three age groups (50-65, 66-74, and ≥75 years) were defined. Birth cohorts were categorised into four intervals: ≤1915, 1916-1925, 1926-1940 and ≥1941. We used Poisson regressions to conduct both a time period and cohort-based analysis of trends in the incidence of localised, regional, and distant cancer for each combination of age groups and calendar-time periods or birth cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we explored the effect of cohorts on the stage-specific incidence graphically with a Poisson regression using 5-year age groups, and by estimating cumulative incidence rates for each birth cohort.  Results:   The annual incidence of localised cancers among men aged 50-65 and 66-74 years rose from 41.4 and 255.2 per 100 000, respectively, before the introduction of PSA testing to 137.9 and 418.7 in 2001-2010 afterwards, corresponding to 3.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1-3.5] and 1.6 (95% CI 1.6-1.7) fold increases. The incidence of regional cancers increased by a factor seven among men aged <75 years. The incidence of distant cancers in men aged ≥75 years decreased by 29% (95% CI 25-33%). These findings were confirmed in the cohort-based approach.

Despite recent improvements in their management, UC remain an aggressive disease associated with a poor outcome. Following disease progression on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, very few effective treatment options are available and none of them have shown significant improvement in overall survival. Alterations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway including amplification, mutations and overexpression are common in UC. Pre-clinical data suggest that the presence of such dysregulations may confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors.  Materials and methods:   We present here the case of a patient with a metastatic UC of the renal pelvis with lymph node metastases treated with the selective FGFR inhibitor AZD4547.  Results:   To date, the patient has been on a study drug for 32 months with acceptable tolerance and maintained radiological partial response as per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Exploratory biomarker analysis showed FGFR3, FGFR1, FGF-ligand and fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) expression in the patient's tumour, together with the presence of a germ-line mutation in the FGFR3 extracellular binding domain. This is not a known hotspot mutation, and the functional significance remains unclear.  Conclusions:   The FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 exhibits antitumour activity in a metastatic urothelial cancer displaying FGFR1, FGFR3, FGF-ligand and FRS2 expression. This lends support to the further exploration of FGFR inhibitors in urothelial cancer.

Materials and methods:   We assessed TED risk for 42 263 men with PCa who were receiving ADT compared with a matched cohort of 190 930 without PCa. The associations between ADT and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) were analysed using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models, while accounting for previous PCa-related surgeries and the following proxies for disease progression: transurethral resection of the prostate, palliative radiotherapy and nephrostomy.  Results:   Between 1997 and 2013, 11 242 men with PCa received anti-androgen monotherapy, 26 959 men received gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, 1 091 men received combined androgen blockade and 3 789 men underwent orchiectomy. When accounting for previous surgeries and proxies of disease progression, GnRH agonist users and surgically castrated men had a higher risk of TED than the comparison cohort: hazard ratios (HRs) 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-1.98) and 1.61 (95% CI 1.15-2.28), respectively. Men on anti-androgen monotherapy had a lower risk: HR for DVT 0.49 (95% CI 0.33-0.74). TED risk was highest among those who switched from anti-androgen to GnRH agonists: HR for PE 2.55 (95% CI 1.76-3.70). This increased from 2.52 (95% CI 1.54-4.12) in year 1, to 4.05 (95% CI 2.51-6.55) in year 2.  Conclusion:   The incidence of TED among men on ADT increased with the duration of therapy and the risk was highest for those who switched regimen, suggesting that disease progression as well as ADT contribute to the propagation of TED risk. Nonetheless, these findings support the hypothesis that only men with a relevant indication should receive systemic ADT.""","""[""Sean O'Farrell"", 'Karin Sandström', 'Hans Garmo', 'Pär Stattin', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Association of androgen deprivation therapy with thromboembolic events in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association between duration and type of androgen deprivation therapy and risk of diabetes in men with prostate cancer.', 'Risk and timing of cardiovascular disease after androgen-deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer.', 'Quantifying observational evidence for risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Stroke related to androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.', 'Cardiovascular outcomes after curative prostate cancer treatment: A population-based cohort study.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy with leuprolide increases abdominal adiposity without causing cardiac dysfunction in middle-aged male mice: effect of sildenafil.', 'Low Risk of Venous Thromboembolism After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Through Systemic Image Assessment: A Prospective Study.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy in High-Risk Localized and Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'The Value of Real-World Data in Understanding Prostate Cancer Risk and Improving Clinical Care: Examples from Swedish Registries.']"""

Assays that can reduce patients' risks are urgently needed. In this study, we set up a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method to detect epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem cell gene expression status in peripheral blood to validate whether they could complement CTC enumeration. From January 2013 to June 2014 we collected peripheral blood from 70 mCRPC patients and enumerated CTC in these blood samples using CellSearch system. At the same time, stem cell-related genes (ABCG2, PROM1 and PSCA) and EMT-related genes (TWIST1 and vimentin) were detected in these peripheral blood samples using an RT-qPCR assay. Patient overall survival (OS) and treatment methods were recorded in the follow-up. For patients who received first-line chemotherapy, docetaxel plus prednisone, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) and PSA response rate were recorded. At the time of analysis, 35 patients had died of prostate cancer with a median follow-up of 16.0 months. Unfavorable CTC enumerations (CTC ≥5/7.5 ml) were predictive of shorter OS (p = 0.01). Also, positive stem cell gene expression indicated poor prognosis in mCRPC patients (p = 0.01). However, EMT gene expression status failed to show any prognostic value in OS (p = 0.78). A multivariate analysis indicated that serum albumin (p = 0.04), ECOG performance status (p < 0.01), CTC enumeration (p = 0.02) and stem cell gene expression status (p = 0.01) were independent prognostic factors for OS. For the 40 patients categorized into the favorable CTC enumeration group, positive stem cell gene expression also suggested poor prognosis (p < 0.01). A combined prognostic model consisting of stem cell gene expression and CTC enumeration increased the concordance probability estimated value from 0.716 to 0.889 in comparison with CTC enumeration alone. For patients who received docetaxel plus prednisone as first-line chemotherapy, positive stem cell gene expression suggested a poor PSA-PFS (p = 0.01) and a low PSA response rate (p = 0.008). However, CTC enumeration and EMT gene expression status did not affect PSA-PFS or PSA response rates. As a result, detection of peripheral blood stem cell gene expression could complement CTC enumeration in predicting OS and docetaxel-based treatment effects in mCRPC patients.""","""['Kun Chang', 'Yun-Yi Kong', 'Bo Dai', 'Ding-Wei Ye', 'Yuan-Yuan Qu', 'Yue Wang', 'Zhong-Wei Jia', 'Gao-Xiang Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Categorical versus continuous circulating tumor cell enumeration as early surrogate marker for therapy response and prognosis during docetaxel therapy in metastatic prostate cancer patients.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Oncologic Response and Hospitalization Rate of Patients Receiving Cabazitaxel in the Fourth-Line and Beyond in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Analysis of a Retrospective Cohort and a Structured Literature Review.', 'PSA response rate as a surrogate marker for median overall survival in docetaxel-based first-line treatments for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an analysis of 22 trials.', 'Integration of Liquid Biopsies in Clinical Management of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Presence of CD133-positive circulating tumor cells predicts worse progression-free survival in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Mesenchymal and Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver-3 Status in Circulating Tumor Cells May Serve as a Crucial Prognostic Marker for Assessing Relapse or Metastasis in Postoperative Patients With Colorectal Cancer.', 'Dual-procedural separation of CTCs in cutaneous melanoma provides useful information for both molecular diagnosis and prognosis.', 'The Discordance of Gene Mutations between Circulating Tumor Cells and Primary/Metastatic Tumor.']"""

Here we have demonstrated that flavokawain A (FKA), a novel chalcone from the kava plant, selectively inhibited the growth of pRb deficient cell lines and resulted in a proteasome-dependent and ubiquitination-mediated Skp2 degradation. Degradation of Skp2 by FKA was found to be involved in a functional Cullin1, but independent of Cdh1 expression. Further studies have demonstrated that FKA docked into the ATP binding pocket of the precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8)-activating enzyme (NAE) complex, inhibited NEDD8 conjugations to both Cullin1 and Ubc12 in PC3 cells and Ubc12 NEDDylation in an in vitro assay. Finally, dietary feeding of the autochthonous transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice with FKA inhibited the formation of high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia lesions (HG-PIN) and prostate adenocarcinomas, reduced the tumor burden and completely abolished distant organ metastasis. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that dietary FKA feeding resulted in marked anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects via down-regulation of Skp2 and NEDD8 and up-regulation of p27/Kip1 in the prostate of TRAMP mice.

In the present study, we examined the antitumor activity of CDDO-Me for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells with and without activating K-ras mutations. Treatment of K-ras mutant MiaPaCa-2 and K-ras normal BxPC-3 cells with CDDO-Me elicited strong antiproliferative and proapoptopic responses in both cell lines in culture.

In mice with orthotopic MiaPaCa-2 xenografts, treatment with CDDO-Me prolonged the survival of mice when administered following the surgical resection of tumors.

The present study demonstrated that hypoxia induced the expression and secretion of FKN in the DU145 prostate cancer cell line. Furthermore, inhibiting the activity of FKN with the anti‑FKN FKN‑specific antibody markedly inhibited hypoxia‑induced DU145 cell proliferation. Under normoxic conditions, DU145 cell proliferation markedly increased following exogenous administration of human recombinant FKN protein, and the increase was significantly alleviated by anti‑FKN, indicating the importance of FKN in DU145 cell proliferation. In addition, subsequent determination of cell cycle distribution and expression levels of two core cell cycle regulators, cyclin E and cyclin‑dependent kinase (CDK)2, suggested that FKN promoted the G1/S phase transition by upregulating the expression levels of cyclin E and CDK2. The results of the present study demonstrated that hypoxia led to the upregulation of the secretion and expression of FKN, which enhanced cell proliferation by promoting cell cycle progression in the prostate cancer cells.

In patients with prostate cancer, gene expression of TRPM4 is elevated. Recently, TRPM4 was identified as a cancer driver gene in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer.We investigated TRPM4 protein expression in cancer tissue samples from 20 patients with prostate cancer. We found elevated TRPM4 protein levels in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostate cancer tissue compared to healthy tissue.

The effects of protracted exposure to BPA on the adult prostate have not been studied. We subjected Noble rats to 32 weeks of BPA (low or high dose) or 17β-estradiol (E2) in conjunction with T replenishment. T treatment alone or untreated groups were used as controls. Circulating T levels were maintained within the physiological range in all treatment groups, whereas the levels of free BPA were elevated in the groups treated with T+low BPA (1.06 ± 0.05 ng/mL, P < .05) and T+high BPA (10.37 ± 0.43 ng/mL, P < .01) when compared with those in both controls (0.1 ± 0.05 ng/mL). Prostatic hyperplasia, low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and marked infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the PIN epithelium (P < .05) were observed in the lateral prostates (LPs) of T+low/high BPA-treated rats. In contrast, only hyperplasia and high-grade PIN, but no aberrant immune responses, were found in the T+E2-treated LPs. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in LPs identified differential changes between T+BPA vs T+E2 treatment. Expression of multiple genes in the regulatory network controlled by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α was perturbed by the T+BPA but not by the T+E2 exposure. Collectively these findings suggest that the adult rat prostate, under a physiologically relevant T environment, is susceptible to BPA-induced transcriptomic reprogramming, immune disruption, and aberrant growth dysregulation in a manner distinct from those caused by E2.

This study investigated if STAT1 loss was associated with patient outcome measures and the phenotypic consequence of STAT1 silencing. STAT1 expression was assessed in two patient cohorts with localised (n = 78) and advanced prostate cancer at initial diagnosis (n = 39) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Impact of STAT1 silencing on prostate cancer cells lines was assessed using Cell Death detection ELISA, TLDA gene signature apoptosis arrays, WST-1 assay, xCELLigence system, clonogenic assay, and wound healing assay. In the localised patient cohort, low expression of STAT1 was associated with shorter time to disease recurrence (3.8 vs 7.3 years, P = 0.02) and disease specific survival (6.6 vs 9.3 years, P = 0.05). In the advanced patient cohort, low expression was associated with shorter time to disease recurrence (2.0 vs 3.9 years, P = 0.001). When STAT1 was silenced in PC3 cells (AR negative) and LNCaP cells (AR positive) silencing did not influence levels of apoptosis in either cell line and had little effect on cell viability in the LNCaP cells. In contrast, STAT1 silencing in the PC3 cells resulted in a pronounced increase in cell viability (WST-1 assay: mock silenced vs STAT1 silenced, P < 0.001), clonagenicity (clonogenic assay: mock silenced vs STAT1 silenced, P < 0.001), and migration (wound healing: mock silenced vs STAT1 silenced, P < 0.001).

GST pull-down and RIP assays demonstrated that the 3' end of MALAT1 interacts with the N-terminal of EZH2. Knockdown of MALAT1 impaired EZH2 recruitment to its target loci and upregulated expression of EZH2 repressed genes. Further studies indicated that MALAT1 plays a vital role in EZH2-enhanced migration and invasion in CRPC cell lines. Meta-analysis and RT-qPCR of patient specimens demonstrated a positive correlation between MALAT1 and EZH2 expression in human CRPC tissues. Finally, we showed that MALAT1 enhances expression of PRC2-independent target genes of EZH2 in CRPC cells in culture and patient-derived xenografts. Together, these data indicate that MALAT1 may be a crucial RNA cofactor of EZH2 and that the EZH2-MALAT1 association may provide a new avenue for development new strategies for treatment of CRPC.""","""['Dejie Wang', 'Liya Ding', 'Liguo Wang', 'Yu Zhao', 'Zhifu Sun', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Jun Zhang', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Posttranscriptional silencing of the lncRNA MALAT1 by miR-217 inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition via enhancer of zeste homolog 2 in the malignant transformation of HBE cells induced by cigarette smoke extract.', 'MALAT1 long ncRNA promotes gastric cancer metastasis by suppressing PCDH10.', 'LncRNA MALAT1 promotes development of mantle cell lymphoma by associating with EZH2.', 'EZH2 in Bladder Cancer, a Promising Therapeutic Target.', 'Functional roles of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 in gliomas.', 'Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis of Oncogenic EZH2 Mutants: From Epigenetic Reprogramming to Molecular Signatures.', 'The Talented LncRNAs: Meshing into Transcriptional Regulatory Networks in Cancer.', 'Non-coding RNAs and Exosomal Non-coding RNAs in Traumatic Brain Injury: the Small Player with Big Actions.', 'Emerging RNA-Based Therapeutic and Diagnostic Options: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Long Non-coding RNAs: Pivotal Epigenetic Regulators in Diabetic Retinopathy.']"""

P-gp expression in cells leads to the elimination of a variety of chemically unrelated, mostly cytotoxic compounds. Administration of chemotherapeutics during therapy frequently selects for cells that over express P-gp and are therefore capable of robustly exporting diverse compounds, including chemotherapeutics, from the cells. P-gp thus confers multidrug resistance to a majority of drugs currently available for the treatment of cancers and diseases like HIV/AIDS. The search for P-gp inhibitors for use as co-therapeutics to combat multidrug resistances has had little success to date. In a previous study (Brewer et al., Mol Pharmacol 86: 716-726, 2014), we described how ultrahigh throughput computational searches led to the identification of four drug-like molecules that specifically interfere with the energy harvesting steps of substrate transport and inhibit P-gp catalyzed ATP hydrolysis in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrate that three of these compounds reversed P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance of cultured prostate cancer cells to restore sensitivity comparable to naïve prostate cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel. Potentiation concentrations of the inhibitors were <3 μmol/L. The inhibitors did not exhibit significant toxicity to noncancerous cells at concentrations where they reversed multidrug resistance in cancerous cells. Our results indicate that these compounds with novel mechanisms of P-gp inhibition are excellent leads for the development of co-therapeutics for the treatment of multidrug resistances.""","""['Courtney A Follit', 'Frances K Brewer', 'John G Wise', 'Pia D Vogel']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pharmacol Res Perspect""","""['In vitro and in vivo reversal of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance by a novel potent modulator, XR9576.', 'Pharmacologic approaches to reversing multidrug resistance.', 'In silico screening for inhibitors of p-glycoprotein that target the nucleotide binding domains.', 'Inhibitory effect of steroidal alkaloids on drug transport and multidrug resistance in human cancer cells.', 'New insight into p-glycoprotein as a drug target.', 'A cell-based high-throughput screen identifies inhibitors that overcome P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated multidrug resistance.', 'Optimizing Targeted Inhibitors of P-Glycoprotein Using Computational and Structure-Guided Approaches.', 'Achillin Increases Chemosensitivity to Paclitaxel, Overcoming Resistance and Enhancing Apoptosis in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Line Resistant to Paclitaxel (Hep3B/PTX).', 'Prolonged inhibition of P-glycoprotein after exposure to chemotherapeutics increases cell mortality in multidrug resistant cultured cancer cells.', 'CRISPR/Cas9, a new approach to successful knockdown of ABCB1/P-glycoprotein and reversal of chemosensitivity in human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line.']"""

To develop a novel and selective radiosensitizer, we studied the radiosensitizing effects and associated mechanisms of silibinin in prostate cancer. The radiosensitizing effect of silibinin with ionizing radiation (IR) was assessed on radioresistant prostate cancer cell lines by clonogenic, cell cycle, cell death, and DNA repair assays. Tumor xenograft growth, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of tumor tissues, and toxicity-related parameters were measured in vivo. Silibinin (25 μmol/L) enhanced IR (2.5-10 Gy)-caused inhibition (up to 96%, P < 0.001) of colony formation selectively in prostate cancer cells, and prolonged and enhanced IR-caused G2-M arrest, apoptosis, and ROS production. Mechanistically, silibinin inhibited IR-induced DNA repair (ATM and Chk1/2) and EGFR signaling and attenuated the levels of antiapoptotic proteins. Specifically, silibinin suppressed IR-induced nuclear translocation of EGFR and DNA-PK, an important mediator of DSB repair, leading to an increased number of γ-H2AX (ser139) foci suggesting lesser DNA repair. In vivo, silibinin strongly radiosensitized DU145 tumor xenograft inhibition (84%, P < 0.01) with higher apoptotic response (10-fold, P < 0.01) and reduced repair of DNA damage, and rescued the mice from IR-induced toxicity and hematopoietic injury. Overall, silibinin enhanced the radiotherapeutic response via suppressing IR-induced prosurvival signaling and DSB repair by inhibiting nuclear translocation of EGFR and DNA-PK.

Therefore, we hypothesized that mitochondrial function will be stably and dynamically altered at each stage of the prostate tumor development. We tested this hypothesis in RWPE-1 cells and its tumorigenic clones with progressive malignant characteristics (RWPE-1 < WPE-NA22 < WPE-NB14 < WPE-NB11 < WPE-NB26) using high-throughput respirometry. Our studies demonstrate that mitochondrial content do not change with increasing malignancy. In premalignant cells (WPE-NA22 and WPE-NB14), OXPHOS is elevated in presence of glucose or glutamine alone or in combination compared to RWPE-1 cells and decreases with increasing malignancy. Glutamine maintained higher OXPHOS than glucose and suggests that it may be an important substrate for the growth and proliferation of prostate epithelial cells. Glycolysis significantly increases with malignancy and follow a classical Warburg phenomenon. Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is significantly lower in tumorigenic clones and invasive WPE-NB26 does not utilize FAO at all. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the mitochondrial oncobioenergetic index (MOBI), a mathematical representation of oncobioenergetic profile of a cancer cell, which increases significantly upon transformation into localized premalignant form and rapidly falls below the normal as they become aggressive in prostate tumorigenesis. We have validated this in five prostate cancer cell lines and MOBI appears to be not related to androgen dependence or mitochondrial content, but rather dependent on the stage of the cancer. Altogether, we propose that MOBI could be a potential biomarker to distinguish aggressive cancer from that of indolent disease.""","""['Praveen K Vayalil', 'Aimee Landar']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Mitochondrial oncobioenergetics of prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Tumor necrosis factor alpha increases aerobic glycolysis and reduces oxidative metabolism in prostate epithelial cells.', 'Evaluation of the chemopreventive potential of retinoids using a novel in vitro human prostate carcinogenesis model.', 'Human cell lines as an in vitro/in vivo model for prostate carcinogenesis and progression.', 'The causes of cancer revisited: ""mitochondrial malignancy"" and ROS-induced oncogenic transformation - why mitochondria are targets for cancer therapy.', 'New Pathway for Cisplatin Prodrug to Utilize Metabolic Substrate Preference to Overcome Cancer Intrinsic Resistance.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Metabolic changes during prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Mitochondrial health quality control: measurements and interpretation in the framework of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine.']"""

The stricture was assessed using cystoscopy and urethrocystography. The patients with patent urethral lumens were initially treated with minimally invasive procedures. Open surgery was indicated for the presence of urethral lumen obliteration or when faced with failure of endoscopic treatment. Urinary continence following the prostatectomy was determinant in selecting the surgical approach (abdominal or perineal).  Results:   Thirty-nine patients treated for vesicourethral anastomotic stricture were recorded. The mean age was 64.4 years, and the mean follow-up was 40.3 months.

Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare, we identified all patients diagnosed with T1a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who underwent either pLTA or lapLTA between 2000 and 2009. Overall complications at 30 days and mortality at 90 days were examined for both groups. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to evaluate the effect of the approach on perioperative complications. A second model was fitted to test for associations between patient or tumor characteristics and type of LTA approach.  Results:   Overall, 516 patients diagnosed with T1a RCC were identified. Of those, 289 (56%) were treated with pLTA and 227 (44%) were treated with lapLTA. LapLTA-treated patients were younger (median 76 vs 78, P < .001) and healthier (median Charlson comorbidity index 2.1 vs 2.7, P = .03) than their counterpart. After pLTA and lapLTA, overall complication rates were 21% and 25%, respectively (P = .3). Similarly, 90-day mortality rates did not differ between the two groups (P = 1). After adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics, LTA approach was not associated with perioperative complications (odds ratio: 1.38, P = .1).

Increasing life expectancy and aging population are important factors for increasing cancer incidences in developing countries. National programs are essential for prevention and control of cancer in any society. This study aimed to investigate cancer epidemiology and trends in the province of Hamadan, located in Northwest Iran.  Materials and methods:   This analytical study was carried out based on cancer registry data from 2004 to 2009 in the province of Hamadan, analyzed using STATA (version 12) software for descriptive tests and Join point 4.1.1.1 software for analytical tests.  Results:   There were 7,767 registered cases of cancer during the 6 years studied. Of the total cases registered, 59.1% (4,592 cases) involved men and 40.9% (3,175 cases) occurred in women. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) increased from 72.9 to 132.0 in males and 48.2 to 115.0 in females during the 6 years of the study (p<0.001). The most common cancers were skin, stomach, breast, bladder, and leukemia. In women, teh most common were breast, skin, stomach, colorectal, and leukemia, in that order, and in men skin, stomach, bladder, leukemia, and prostate cancers.  Conclusions:   The cancer incidence is greater in men that women in this region but with increasing trends in both sexes. Planning regarding education in prevention of exposure to risk factors and control strategies is required to decrease the incident cases.

Materials and methods:   A single centre, prospective study of men with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy between 2004 and 2014 was conducted, with registration of clinical-pathological details, total serum PSA pre-surgery, Gleason score, extracapsular extension, positive surgical margins, infiltration of lymph nodes, seminal vesicles and pathological stage. Secondary circulating prostate cells were obtained using differential gel centrifugation and assessed using standard immunocytochemistry with anti-PSA. Biochemical failure was defined as a PSA >0.2ng/ml, predictive values werecalculated using the Walz nomagram and CPC detection.  Results:   A total of 326 men participated, with a median follow up of 5 years; 64 had biochemical failure within two years. Extracapsular extension, positive surgical margins, pathological stage, Gleason score ≥ 8, infiltration of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes were all associated with higher risk of biochemical failure. The discriminative value for the nomogram and circulating prostate cells was high (AUC >0.80), predictive values were higher for circulating prostate cell detection, with a negative predictive value of 99%, sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 75%.  Conclusions:   The nomagram had good predictive power to identify men with a high risk of biochemical failure within two years. The presence of circulating prostate cells had the same predictive power, with a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value. The presence of secondary circulating prostate cells identifies a group of men with a high risk of early biochemical failure.

The prostate specific antigen (PSA) test is the most widely used for screening for prostate cancer; however, its low specificity elevates the number of unnecessarily biopsies. Serum human kallikrein-2 (hK2) is considered as a promising marker, and especially its ratio to fPSA, for predicting the presence of malignancy to select the best choice referring to biopsy or surveillance. In this study, we investigated the role of hK2 and its combinations with other markers to discriminate prostate cancer from benign diseases in Syrian patients.  Materials and methods:   In this prospective oriented cross-sectional cohort study, serum samples were collected from patients referred to many Hospitals in Damascus, Syria, between May 2011 and March 2012, and diagnosed with biopsy proven benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer (PCa). Serum was analyzed for hK2, PSA and fPSA, and the ratios of fPSA/PSA and hK2/fPSA were calculated.  Results:   We found that mean hK2/fPSA ratios were significantly higher (P=0.01) in prostate cancer patients than in the BPH or control groups. Also the ratio hk2/fPSA gave the largest area under the curve (AUC:0.96) which was significantly larger than for fPSA/PSA (AUC:0.41) indicative of higher specificity.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that the ratio of hK2/fPSA might be superior to the use of fPSA/PSA alone. The hK2 could be shown to enhance the early detection of prostate cancer; especially the ratio hK2/fPSA improves specificity and hence may reduce the number of negative biopsies.""","""['Dala-Maria Bachour', 'Emil Chahin', 'Sahar Al-Fahoum']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['The combination of human glandular kallikrein and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) enhances discrimination between prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with moderately increased total PSA.', 'Association of free-prostate specific antigen subfractions and human glandular kallikrein 2 with volume of benign and malignant prostatic tissue.', 'Discrimination of men with prostate cancer from those with benign disease by measurements of human glandular kallikrein 2 (HK2) in serum.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'The role of molecular forms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA or hK3) and of human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2) in the diagnosis and monitoring of prostate cancer and in extra-prostatic disease.', 'Pre-diagnosis urine exosomal RNA (ExoDx EPI score) is associated with post-prostatectomy pathology outcome.', 'Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) in the Gray Area: Construction of 2 Predictive Models.', 'Multivariable Models Incorporating Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Efficiently Predict Results of Prostate Biopsy and Reduce Unnecessary Biopsy.', 'Using clinical parameters to predict prostate cancer and reduce the unnecessary biopsy among patients with PSA in the gray zone.', 'Establishment of two new predictive models for prostate cancer to determine whether to require prostate biopsy when the PSA level is in the diagnostic gray zone (4-10 ng ml-1).']"""

Methods:   An initial ranking was constructed from previous work identifying 'avoidable deaths' for 21 common cancers in the UK. In a two-round modified Delphi exercise, 22 experts, all experienced across multiple cancers, used an evidence pack summarising recent relevant publications and their own experience to adjust this ranking. Participants also answered on a Likert scale whether they anticipated mortality or morbidity benefits for each cancer from expedited diagnosis.  Results:   Substantial changes in ranking occurred in the Delphi exercise. Finally, expedited diagnosis was judged to provide the greatest mortality benefit in breast cancer, uterine cancer and melanoma, and least in brain and pancreatic cancers. Three cancers, prostate, brain and pancreas, attracted a median answer of 'disagree' to whether they expected mortality benefits from expedited diagnosis of symptomatic cancer.  Conclusions:   Our results can guide future research, with emphasis given to studying interventions to improve symptomatic diagnosis of those cancers ranked highly.

In this study, we showed that DAB2IP knockdown could significantly enhance in vitro growth and colony formation of PCa cells following ADT as well as tumorigenicity in pre-castrated nude mice. In addition, DAB2IP loss stabilized mitochondrial transmembrane potential, prevented release of cytochrome c, Omi/HtrA2 and Smac from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and inhibited intrinsic apoptosis induced by ADT. Mechanistically, DAB2IP could interact with the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) via its unique PR domain and suppress STAT3 phosphorylation and transactivation, leading to the inhibition of survivin expression in PCa cells. Moreover, the luminal epithelia in DAB2IP(-/-) mice with more activated STAT3 and survivin expression were resistant to castration-induced apoptosis.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves clinical outcome, but tumors often recur and progress to androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC) which no longer responds to ADT. The progression to AIPC is due to genetic alterations that allow PC cancer cells to grow in the absence of androgen. Here we performed an insertional mutagenesis screen using a replication-incompetent lentiviral vector (LV) to identify the genes that promote AIPC in an orthotopic mouse model. Androgen sensitive PC cells, LNCaP, were mutagenized with LV and injected into the prostate of male mice. After tumor development, mice were castrated to select for cells that proliferate in the absence of androgen. Proviral integration sites and nearby dysregulated genes were identified in tumors developed in an androgen deficient environment. Using publically available datasets, the expression of these candidate androgen independence genes in human PC tissues were analyzed. A total of 11 promising candidate AIPC genes were identified: GLYATL1, FLNA, OBSCN, STRA13, WHSC1, ARFGAP3, KDM2A, FAM83H, CLDN7, CNOT6, and B3GNT9.

Docetaxel is a standard first-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) after the failure of hormone therapy. However, most mCRPC patients who receive docetaxel experience only transient benefits and rapidly develop incurable drug resistance, which is closely correlated with the p53 mutation status. Mutant p53s were recently reported to regulate the metabolic pathways via sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Therefore, targeting the SREBP metabolic pathways with docetaxel as a combination therapy may offer a potential strategy to improve anti-tumor efficacy and delay cellular drug resistance in mCRPC harboring mutant p53s. Our previous data showed that fatostatin, a new SREBP inhibitor, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in androgen receptor (AR)-positive PCa cell lines and xenograft mouse models. In this study, we demonstrated that mutant p53s activate the SREBP-mediated metabolic pathways in metastatic AR-negative PCa cells carrying mutant p53s. By blocking the SREBP pathways, fatostatin inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in metastatic AR-negative PCa cells harboring mutant p53s. Furthermore, the combination of fatostatin and docetaxel resulted in greater proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction compared with single agent treatment in PCa cells in vitro and in vivo, especially those with mutant p53s.

The objectives of this study were to examine trajectories of physical activity (PA) and physical function (PF) over a 2-year lifestyle counseling study and to identify characteristics of the trajectory groups.  Methods:   This was a secondary analysis of Reach Out to Enhance Wellness, a randomized controlled trial of home-based lifestyle counseling. The 641 participants were older (≥65 years), overweight (body mass index [BMI], 25 to <40 kg/m(2)), long-term community-dwelling survivors (>5 years) of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States (21 states) who had been randomly assigned to an immediate intervention or a 12-month-wait-listed control arm. The main outcome measures were PA and PF trajectory group membership.  Results:   Three PA groups and 5 PF trajectory groups were observed. The baseline BMI (P < .001) and self-efficacy for performing strength (P < .0001) and endurance exercises (P < .0002) were the strongest predictors of achieving the highest amount of PA and the most favorable functional trajectory over 2 years. Individuals with low baseline self-efficacy, no PA, and a Short Form 36 PF subscale score < 65 did not benefit from the intervention.  Conclusions:   This study identified characteristics of survivors who benefited from home-based interventions and suggested alternative approaches for survivors requiring more structured and intensive interventions to promote behavioral changes.""","""['Miriam C Morey', 'Cindy K Blair', 'Richard Sloane', 'Harvey Jay Cohen', 'Denise C Snyder', 'Wendy Demark-Wahnefried']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Effects of home-based diet and exercise on functional outcomes among older, overweight long-term cancer survivors: RENEW: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Reach out to enhance wellness home-based diet-exercise intervention promotes reproducible and sustainable long-term improvements in health behaviors, body weight, and physical functioning in older, overweight/obese cancer survivors.', 'Results of the Exercise and Nutrition to Enhance Recovery and Good Health for You (ENERGY) Trial: A Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention in Overweight or Obese Breast Cancer Survivors.', 'Promoting healthy lifestyles in older cancer survivors to improve health and preserve function.', 'Exercise Interventions for Preserving Physical Function Among Cancer Survivors in Middle to Late Life.', 'Health, social care and technological interventions to improve functional ability of older adults living at home: An evidence and gap map.', 'Psychosocial Determinants of Lifestyle Change after a Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Exploring maintenance of physical activity behaviour change among people living with and beyond gastrointestinal cancer: a cross-sectional qualitative study and typology.', 'Correlates of poor adherence to a healthy lifestyle among a diverse group of colorectal cancer survivors.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of maintenance of physical activity behaviour change in cancer survivors.']"""

Materials and methods:   We conducted a cohort study of a 2% nationwide random sample of Korean National Health Insurance. A total of 1,382 patients who had undergone active treatments for newly diagnosed PC between 2003 and 2013 were included. Time trends in primary treatment of PC, including radical surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were analyzed.  Results:   Total number of patients undergoing active treatments increased significantly (162%). Surgery cases showed the most significant increase, from 22.4% in 2003 to 45.4% in 2013, while the relative proportion of ADT showed a tendency to decrease from 60.3% in 2003 to 45.4% in 2013, and the relative proportion of RT was variable over 10 years (from 7.2% to 18.4%). While treatment patterns differed significantly according to age (p < 0.001) and income classes (p=0.014), there were differences in primary treatment according to residential area. In multinomial logistic regression analysis, older patients showed significant association with ADT or RT compared to surgery, while patients with higher income showed significant association with surgery.  Conclusion:   Treatment pattern in Korean PC patients has changed remarkably over the last 10 years. Sociodemographic factors do affect the primary treatment choice.

Methods:   All men (n=2817) referred to the Department of Urology at Frederiksberg Hospital with suspicion of having PCa in the period 1 January 2007-31 January 2014 were identified. Based on the referral date, patients were categorised as pre-Movember (1 January 2007-31 January 2011) and Movember (1 February 2011-31 January 2014), respectively. Annual referral-rates/100.000 inhabitants were calculated and compared with rate-ratio (RR) tests.  Results:   The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at referral dropped significantly from 9.8 ng/mL in 2007-2011 to 7.9 ng/mL in 2011-2014,p< 0.001. The incidence rate of men referred with suspicion of PCa increased from 134/100.000 in the pre-Movember period to 168/100.000 in the Movember period (RR 1.25 [95% CI 1.16-1.35]). In contrast to what we anticipated, there was no increase in referral in the months following the campaign. The incidence rates of men diagnosed with PCa and low-risk PCa were similar in the Movember period and the pre-Movember period (PCa: RR 1.08 [0.97-1.21]; low-risk PCa: RR 1.29 [0.98-1.73]).  Conclusions:   After the initiation of the Movember campaign a significant decline in the PSA level at referral and an increase in the number of patients referred under suspicion of PCa was observed; however, only minor differences in referral patterns and PCa diagnosis were detected.

Given that human prostate cancer arises from precancerous lesions such as high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN), which frequently have lost phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor permitting phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) oncogenic signaling, we tested the efficacy of MSeA to inhibit HG-PIN progression in Pten prostate-specific knockout (KO) mice and assessed the mechanistic involvement of p53-mediated cellular senescence and of the androgen receptor (AR). We observed that short-term (4 weeks) oral MSeA treatment significantly increased expression of P53 and P21Cip1 proteins and senescence-associated-β-galactosidase staining, and reduced Ki67 cell proliferation index in Pten KO prostate epithelium. Long-term (25 weeks) MSeA administration significantly suppressed HG-PIN phenotype, tumor weight, and prevented emergence of invasive carcinoma in Pten KO mice. Mechanistically, the long-term MSeA treatment not only sustained P53-mediated senescence, but also markedly reduced AKT phosphorylation and AR abundance in the Pten KO prostate. Importantly, these cellular and molecular changes were not observed in the prostate of wild-type littermates which were similarly treated with MSeA. Because p53 signaling is likely to be intact in HG-PIN compared with advanced prostate cancer, the selective superactivation of p53-mediated senescence by MSeA suggests a new paradigm of cancer chemoprevention by strengthening a cancer progression barrier through induction of irreversible senescence with additional suppression of AR and AKT oncogenic signaling.""","""['Lei Wang', 'Xiaolan Guo', 'Ji Wang', 'Cheng Jiang', 'Maarten C Bosland', 'Junxuan Lü', 'Yibin Deng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of Pten gene-knockout mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'Persistent p21Cip1 induction mediates G(1) cell cycle arrest by methylseleninic acid in DU145 prostate cancer cells.', 'PKB/AKT and ERK regulation of caspase-mediated apoptosis by methylseleninic acid in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'IL-6/STAT3/ARF: the guardians of senescence, cancer progression and metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'PTEN, more than the AKT pathway.', 'Effect of Dietary Methylseleninic Acid and Se-Methylselenocysteine on Carcinogen-Induced, Androgen-Promoted Prostate Carcinogenesis in Rats.', 'Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of Pten gene-knockout mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'Role of GDF15 in methylseleninic acid-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Combined Acylselenourea-Diselenide Structures: New Potent and Selective Antitumoral Agents as Autophagy Activators.', 'Methylseleninic Acid Provided at Nutritional Selenium Levels Inhibits Angiogenesis by Down-regulating Integrin β3 Signaling.']"""

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib.  Methods:   We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies.  Results:   Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%.

Functional studies of miR-223 were carried out to investigate cell proliferation, migration, and invasion using PC3 and PC3M PCa cell lines. Restoration of miR-223 significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion in PCa cells. In silico database and genome-wide gene expression analyses revealed that ITGA3 and ITGB1 were direct targets of miR-223 regulation. Knockdown of ITGA3 and ITGB1 significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion in PCa cells by regulating downstream signaling. Moreover, overexpression of ITGA3 and ITGB1 was observed in PCa clinical specimens. Thus, our data indicated that downregulation of miR-223 enhanced ITGA3/ITGB1 signaling and contributed to cancer cell migration and invasion in PCa cells.

We report here the unexpected formation of membrane tubes from lymph node cancer prostate (LNCaP) cell aggregates in the absence of external applied forces. The spreading of LNCaP aggregates deposited on adhesive glass substrates coated with fibronectin is very limited because cell-cell adhesion is stronger than cell-substrate adhesion. Some cells on the aggregate periphery are very motile and try to escape from the aggregate, leading to the formation of membrane tubes. Tethered networks and exchange of cargos between cells were observed as well. Growth of the tubes is followed by either tube retraction or tube rupture. Hence, even very cohesive cells are successful in escaping aggregates, which may lead to epithelial mesenchymal transition and tumor metastasis.

Based on both age-dependent models and doses to critical organs, the risk of second tumor induction was evaluated simulating the small field (prostate and seminal vesicles) and large field (whole pelvis) for Helical Tomotherapy and Rapid Arc. The doses to the organs closest to the treatment volume were derived from treatment planning system data. Whereas, due to the lack of calculation algorithms where leakage and internal radiation scattering are unreliable at a large distance from target, the doses to the organs outside the treatment volume were measured in an anthropomorphic phantom. Doses from Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) were also assessed on phantom measurements. The Lifetime Attributable Risk (LAR) for second tumor induction increases from 2.2 to 13.7% as irradiated volume increases and age decreases. IGRT could add a non-negligible factor to the risk when daily set-up verification with high-resolution modality is included. As prostate cancer is detected earlier, the probability of an increase in early stage patients rises, and life expectancy thus increases. Radiotherapy has improved its capability in the tailoring of the dose around the target at the cost of a greater dose to surrounding organs, thus increasing the risk of second tumor induction, especially for those patients expected to survive 15 y or more.""","""['Riccardo Calandrino', 'Lucia Perna', 'Maria Luisa Belli', 'Andrea Botti', 'Mauro Cattaneo', 'Claudio Fiorino', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Mauro Iori']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Health Phys""","""['Improved clinical outcomes with high-dose image guided radiotherapy compared with non-IGRT for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Hypofractionated Dose Escalated 3D Conformal Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Outcomes from a Mono-Institutional Phase II Study.', 'A treatment planning and acute toxicity comparison of two pelvic nodal volume delineation techniques and delivery comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus volumetric modulated arc therapy for hypofractionated high-risk prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Benefit of intensity modulated and image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'IMRT combined to IGRT: increase of the irradiated volume.

In this study, we present evidence that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway might be activated in prostate cancer cells after androgen-deprivation to promote androgen-independent growth, partly through enhanced interaction of β-catenin with TCF4. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cells were more prone to activate a Wnt-reporter, and inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway increased sensitivity of these cells to the second-generation antiandrogen, enzalutamide.

Computed tomography (CT) perfusion is an emerging functional imaging modality that measures tissue perfusion through dynamic CT scanning following intravenous administration of contrast medium. This noninvasive technique provides a quantitative basis for assessing tumor angiogenesis. CT perfusion has been utilized on a variety of organs including lung, prostate, liver, and brain, with promising results in cancer diagnosis, disease prognostication, prediction, and treatment monitoring. In this paper, we focus on assessing the extent to which CT perfusion characteristics can be used to discriminate liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors from normal liver tissues. The neuroendocrine liver metastases were analyzed by distributed parameter modeling to yield tissue blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), permeability (PS), and hepatic arterial fraction (HAF), for tumor and normal liver. The result reveals the potential of CT perfusion as a tool for constructing biomarkers from features of the hepatic vasculature for guiding cancer detection, prognostication, and treatment selection.""","""['Yuan Wang', 'Brian P Hobbs', 'Chaan S Ng']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Metastases to the liver from neuroendocrine tumors: effect of duration of scan acquisition on CT perfusion values.', 'The role of perfusion CT as a follow-up modality after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization: an experimental study in a rabbit model.', 'CT perfusion in normal liver and liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors treated with targeted antivascular agents.', 'Hepatocellular nodules in liver cirrhosis: state of the art CT evaluation (perfusion CT/volume helical shuttle scan/dual-energy CT, etc.).', 'Comparative accuracy of intravenous contrast-enhanced CT versus noncontrast CT plus intravenous contrast-enhanced CT in the detection and characterization of patients with hypervascular liver metastases: a critically appraised topic.', 'A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for 68GaGa-(HA-)DOTATATE to predict whole-body distribution and tumor sink effects in GEP-NET patients.', 'Imaging-based characterization of convective tissue properties.', 'Evaluation of skeletal muscle perfusion in a canine hind limb ischemia model using CT perfusion imaging.', 'A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Functional Data Classification with Application to Hepatic Tissue Characterization.']"""

Purpose:   To evaluate the value of MRI for predicting PCSM in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   A total of 318 patients underwent MRI followed by RP. MRI was assessed for the presence of clinically significant cancer using a five-point Likert scale, where ≥4 was considered positive. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses was used to determine the relationship of preoperative factors with PCSM. PCSM was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between factors using the log-rank test.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 104 months, 11 (3.5%) patients died of prostate cancer. One hundred and four (32.7%) patients had clinically significant prostate cancer on MRI. Univariate analysis revealed that Gleason grade, greatest percentage of involved core length (GPCL), and clinically significant cancer on MRI were significantly related to PCSM (P = 0.001-0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that GPCL (hazard ratio [HR], 1.028; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.000-1.057; P = 0.048) and clinically significant cancer on MRI (HR, 10.903; 95% CI, 1.287-92.374; P = 0.028) were independent predictors of PCSM. The 5 - and 10-year PCSM rates were 0.6% and 1.3% in patients with GPCL <50% and 5.1% and 8.6% in those with GPCL ≥50% (P = 0.012). Patients without clinically significant cancer on MRI showed 5 - and 10-year PCSM rates of 0% and 0.5%, respectively, whereas those with clinically significant cancer on MRI showed rates of 8% and 14.2%, respectively (P < 0.001).

The treatment effect on overall survival (OS), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response analysed by quartile duration of prior gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) or androgen receptor (AR) antagonist.  Intervention:   Patients were randomised to AA (1000mg, orally once daily) plus prednisone (5mg, orally twice daily) or placebo plus prednisone. Prior endocrine therapy was GnRHa (COU-AA-301, n=1127 [94%]; COU-AA-302, n=1057 [97%], 45.1 mo or 36.7 mo median duration, respectively) and/or orchiectomy (COU-AA-301, n=78 [7%] COU-AA-302, n=44 [4%]); castrated patients received prior AR antagonists (COU-AA-301, n=1015 [85%]; COU-AA-302, n=1078 [99%], 15.7 mo or 16.1 mo median duration, respectively).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox model was used to obtain hazard ratio and associated 95% confidence interval with statistical inference by log rank statistic.  Results and limitations:   Clinical benefit with AA was observed for OS, rPFS, and PSA response for nearly all quartiles with GnRHa or AR antagonists in both COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-302. In COU-AA-301, patients with a longer duration of prior endocrine therapy tended to have greater AA OS, rPFS, and PSA response benefit, with lead-time chemotherapy bias potentially impacting COU-AA-301 results.

MRI sequences included T1-w native, T1-w contrast-enhanced, T2-w fat-saturated and diffusion-weighted sequences (DWIb800). Discordant PET-positive and morphological findings were evaluated. Standardized uptake values (SUV) of PET-positive LNs and bone lesions were quantified and their morphological size and conspicuity determined.  Results:   Comparing the PET components, the proportion of discordant PSMA-positive suspicious findings was very low (98.5 % of 64 LNs concordant, 100 % of 28 bone lesions concordant). Two PET-positive bone metastases could not be confirmed morphologically using CTlow-dose, but could be confirmed using MRI.

Patients and methods:   We conducted a prospective single-centre study of men who underwent radical prostatectomy as monotherapy for prostate cancer. Clinicopathological findings were used to calculate the CAPRA score. At 90 days after surgery, blood was taken for CPC detection, mononuclear cells were obtained using differential gel centrifugation, and CPCs were identified using immunocytochemistry. A CPC was defined as a cell expressing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) but not CD45. The CPC test results were defined as positive or negative. Patients were followed up for up to 5 years and biochemical recurrence was defined as a PSA level >0.2 ng/mL. The validity of the CAPRA score was calibrated using partial validation, and Cox proportional hazard regression to build three models: a CAPRA score model, a CPC model and a CAPRA/CPC combined model.  Results:   A total of 321 men, with a mean age of 65.5 years, participated in the study. After 5 years of follow-up the biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 98.55%. For the model that included CAPRA score there was a hazard ratio (HR) of 7.66, for the CPC model there was an HR of 34.52 and for the combined model there were HRs of 2.60 for CAPRA score and 22.5 for CPC. Using the combined model, 23% of men changed from the low-risk to the high-risk category, or vice versa.  Conclusion:   The incorporation of CPC detection significantly improved the model's discriminative ability in establishing the probability of biochemical recurrence; patients in the high-risk group according to CAPRA score who are negative for CPCs have a much better prognosis. The addition of CPC detection gives clinically significant information to aid the decision on who may be eligible for adjuvant therapy.""","""['Nigel P Murray', 'Socrates Aedo', 'Eduardo Reyes', 'Nelson Orellana', 'Cynthia Fuentealba', 'Omar Jacob']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Limited improvement of incorporating primary circulating prostate cells with the CAPRA score to predict biochemical failure-free outcome of radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Combining the Prostate Cancer Risk Index (PRIX) with the Presence of Secondary Circulating Prostate Cells to Predict the Risk of Biochemical Failure after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.', '10 Year Biochemical Failure Free Survival of Men with CD82 Positive Primary Circulating Prostate Cells Treated by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic value of the CAPRA clinical prediction rule: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.', 'The CAPRA-S score versus subtypes of minimal residual disease to predict biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy.', 'Minimal residual disease in prostate cancer patients after primary treatment: theoretical considerations, evidence and possible use in clinical management.', 'Utility of cell-free nucleic acid and circulating tumor cell analyses in prostate cancer.', 'Minimum Residual Disease in Patients Post Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: Theoretical Considerations, Clinical Implications and Treatment Outcome.', 'Diabetes and beta-adrenergic blockage are risk factors for metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

We explored the associations between tumor expression of caspases and IAPs and clinicopathological features of prostate cancer--clinical and pathological T stage, Gleason score, preoperative serum PSA levels, perineural invasion, lymph node involvement, surgical margin status and overall survival--and evaluated its capability to predict biochemical progression after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Protein expression of caspases (procaspase-8, cleaved caspase-8, procaspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7 and procaspase-9) and IAPs (cIAP1/2, cIAP2, NAIP, Survivin and XIAP) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in radical prostatectomy samples from 84 prostate cancer patients.

The present study aimed to compare outcomes, including mortality, of RP and EBRT for localized PC.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 891 patients with cT1-4N0M0 PC who underwent either RP (n = 569) or EBRT (n = 322) with curative intent at our single institution between 2005 and 2012. Of the EBRT patients, 302 (93.8%) underwent intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Related to these, other-cause mortality (OCM) was also calculated. Biochemical recurrence-free survival was assessed as a secondary endpoint. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis.  Results:   Median follow-up durations were 53 and 45 months, and median ages were 66 and 70 years (P <0.0001), in the RP and EBRT groups, respectively. As a whole, significantly better prognoses of the RP group than the EBRT group were observed for both OS and CSS, although OCM was significantly higher in the EBRT group. There was no death from PC in men with low and intermediate D'Amico risks, except one with intermediate-risk in the EBRT group. In high-risk patients, significantly more patients died from PC in the EBRT group than the RP group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the RP group to be an independent prognostic factor for better CSS. On the other hand, the EBRT group had a significantly longer biochemical recurrence-free survival than the RP group.

However, inhibition of AR or PI3K/mTOR alone results in a reciprocal feedback activation. Therefore, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of the AR and PI3K/mTOR pathway might lead to a synergistic inhibition of cell growth and overcome drug resistance in CRPC. Here, we reported that androgen-depletion increased AR protein level and Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 in LNCaP cells. Moreover, we developed resistance cell lines of LNCaP to Enzalutamide (or MDV3100), an AR inhibitor (named as LNCaP 'MDV-R') and PF-04691502, a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor (named as LNCaP 'PF-R'). MTS analysis showed that LNCaP 'PF-R' was strongly resistant to Enzalutamide treatment, and on the other hand, LNCaP 'MDV-R' was 6-fold resistant to PF-04691502 treatment. Mechanistically, LNCaP 'MDV-R' cells had significantly reduced AR, loss of PSA and increase Akt activity in contrast with LNCaP 'PF-R' cells. Combined inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and AR pathways with a variety of small molecular inhibitors led to a synergistic suppression of cell proliferation and a profound increase of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in both androgen-dependent LNCaP and independent CRPC 22Rv1 cell lines.

Patients and methods:   Sera from 495 patients (425 with PCa and 70 men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), were measured with six different assays [three automated assays (a-PSA) and three manual ELISA based assay (m-PSA)]. Variability, agreement and bias were measured and compared among assays using Bland Altman plots and Passing and Bablok regression analysis. The possible impact of inter-assay variability on important clinical scenarios was also studied.  Results:   All the assays were well correlated (r: 0.88-0.98); however there was significant disagreement and bias between the systems, which were more pronounced among the a-PSA assays. The Bland Altman plot showed that the variability was high between the m-PSA assays and the standard Abbott system with mean difference of 3.8-5.8ng/ml. In contrast, the a-PSA had better agreement with mean difference of 0.8-2.3ng/ml.

Although radiation therapy offers clinical benefit over other therapeutic modalities, the success of this therapeutic modality is commonly hampered by the resistance of advanced tumors. So far, the mechanisms governing tumor resistance to radiotherapy are not discussed in detail. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the resistance of PCa to radiation therapy is attributed to elevated expression of Hepatoma Up-Regulated Protein (HURP). In PCa cells, the induction of HURP expression suppresses γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis. γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis of PCa cells is associated with expression of E2F1, p53, p21 proteins together with the phosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1 (ASK1), c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and histone family member X (H2AX). Whereas, the induction of HURP expression is able to suppress γ-irradiation-induced effects on E2F1, p53, p21, ATM, ASK1, JNK and ATM, and H2AX. Also, inhibition of γ-irradiation-induced- cytochrome c release, cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were noted in PCa cells induced for HURP expression. The observed radio-resistance of PCa is thought to be the consequence of HURP-mediated destabilization of p53 and ATM proteins that are essential for the modulation of γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis. Thus, based on our findings, PCa resistance to radiation therapy results from the deregulation of ASK1/ JNK; ATM/ H2AX; ATM/p53 and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2)/ E2F-1 in response to the elevated expression of HURP.""","""['Mohamed Hassan', 'Abdelouahid El Khattouti', 'Ahmed Ejaeidi', 'Tangeng Ma', 'William A Day', 'Ingrid Espinoza', 'Srinivasan Vijayakumar', 'Christian R Gomez']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Infiltrating mast cells increase prostate cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistances via modulation of p38/p53/p21 and ATM signals.', 'Knockdown of HURP inhibits the proliferation of hepacellular carcinoma cells via downregulation of gankyrin and accumulation of p53.', 'Overcoming the radioresistance of prostate cancer cells with a novel Bcl-2 inhibitor.', 'Profiles of Radioresistance Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer.', 'Revisiting p53 for cancer-specific chemo- and radiotherapy: ten years after.', 'The crescent-like Golgi ribbon is shaped by the Ajuba/PRMT5/Aurora-A complex-modified HURP.', 'High Expression of DLGAP5 Indicates Poor Prognosis and Immunotherapy in Lung Adenocarcinoma and Promotes Proliferation through Regulation of the Cell Cycle.', 'Knockdown of DLGAP5 suppresses cell proliferation, induces G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in ovarian cancer.', 'Identification and prognostic value of DLGAP5 in endometrial cancer.', 'Melanoma stem cell maintenance and chemo-resistance are mediated by CD133 signal to PI3K-dependent pathways.']"""

Here, we use whole genome sequencing of a prostate cancer tumor, computational analyses, and experimental validation to identify and predict novel oncogenic activity arising from a point mutation in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor protein. We demonstrate that this mutation (p.A126G) produces an enzymatic gain-of-function in PTEN, shifting its function from a phosphoinositide (PI) 3-phosphatase to a phosphoinositide (PI) 5-phosphatase. Using cellular assays, we demonstrate that this gain-of-function activity shifts cellular phosphoinositide levels, hyperactivates the PI3K/Akt cell proliferation pathway, and exhibits increased cell migration beyond canonical PTEN loss-of-function mutants. These findings suggest that mutationally modified PTEN can actively contribute to well-defined hallmarks of cancer. Lastly, we demonstrate that these effects can be substantially mitigated through chemical PI3K inhibitors.

Patients and methods:   This study included 128 Japanese patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2000 through 2012 whose serum testosterone level and BMI were measured before treatment. Associations between clinical parameters, including pre-treatment serum testosterone level and BMI, and Gleason score at biopsy were examined.  Results:   The median serum testosterone and BMI were 434 ng/dl (interquartile range=362-542 ng/dl) and 23.5 kg/m(2) (interquartile range=21.7-25.4 kg/m(2)), respectively. Gleason score at biopsy was <7, 7 and >7 for 58 patients (45.3%), 52 patients (40.6%) and 18 patients (14.1%), respectively. On univariate analysis, positive finding at digital rectal examination (DRE), high prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis and low serum testosterone level, but not BMI, were correlated with high Gleason score at biopsy. Multivariate analysis identified positive finding at DRE and low serum testosterone level as significant predictors of a high Gleason score at prostate biopsy. By combining these parameters, the predictive ability of a high Gleason score was improved.

Here, we examined the effects of Dkk-3 on the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), which mediate the effects of TGF-β on extracellular matrix disassembly during tissue morphogenesis and promote invasion of tumor cells. Silencing of Dkk-3 in prostate epithelial cells resulted in increased expression and enzyme activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Inhibition of MMP-9 partially restored normal acinar morphogenesis in Dkk-3-silenced RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells. In PC3 prostate cancer cells, Dkk-3 inhibited TGF-β-dependent migration and invasion. Inhibition was mediated by the Dkk-3 C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (Cys2), which also inhibited TGF-β-induced expression of MMP9 and MMP13. In contrast, Dkk-3, but not Cys2, increased formation of normal acini in Dkk-3-silenced prostate epithelial cells.

We found that macrophages infiltrating PC were mainly of an M2 type and correlated with a more aggressive tumor and poor patient prognosis. Furthermore, the M1/M2 ratio was significantly decreased in PC compared to CRC. Using in vitro cell culture experiments, we could show that factors secreted from CRC and PC cells induced macrophages of a proinflammatory or immunosuppressive phenotype, respectively. These macrophages differentially affected autologous T lymphocyte proliferation and activation. Consistent with this, CRC specimens were found to have higher degrees of infiltrating T-helper 1 cells and active cytotoxic T lymphocytes, while PC specimens displayed functionally inactive T cells.

Treatment of human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and PC-3) with UA inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in both cell lines as characterized by the increased Annexin V-binding. The induction of apoptosis by UA was associated with a decrease in the levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, survivin, and activated caspase-3. Treatment with UA also inhibited the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR signaling proteins. Further, administration of UA significantly inhibited the growth of LNCaP prostate tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice, which was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis of tumor cells and decreased expression of PI3K downstream factors, such as p-Akt and p-mTOR in tumor xenograft tissues.

Surgery of the primary tumor has been avoided in these patients as there is no strong evidence that supports a beneficial effect. From the biological point of view, it appears rational to hypothesize that the primary tumor may contribute to the establishment and growth of metastases. Considering this, we propose that cytoreductive surgery (CS) in advanced metastatic stage slows the progression of metastatic disease. To test this, we used a mouse model of resectable orthotopic prostate cancer (PCa) and performed CS.

It is unknown if these molecular subtypes have a different etiology. We evaluated aspirin and non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in association with T2E fusion status.  Methods:   Subjects were from a population-based case-control study of PCa. T2E fusion status for prostatectomy cases (n=346) was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Medication use was determined from questionnaires. Logistic regression, controlling for age, race, PCa family history and PSA screening, was used to evaluate the association of T2E fusion status according to medication use.  Results:   T2E fusion was present in 171 (49%) cases, with younger cases more likely to be fusion positive (P<0.01). Current aspirin use was associated with a 37% risk reduction of T2E-positive tumors (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.93). Aspirin use was not associated with T2E negative PCa (adjusted OR 0.99, 0.69-1.42). There were no associations between PCa fusion status and use of nonaspirin NSAIDs or acetaminophen.  Conclusions:   Aspirin was associated with a significant reduction in the relative risk of T2E fusion positive, but not T2E negative, PCa. As inflammation and androgen pathways are implicated in prostate carcinogenesis, additional studies of anti-inflammatory medications in relation to these PCa subtypes are warranted.""","""['J L Wright', 'L Chéry', 'S Holt', 'D W Lin', 'M Luedeke', 'A E Rinckleb', 'C Maier', 'J L Stanford']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Calcium Channel Blocker Use and Risk of Prostate Cancer by TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusion Status.', 'Obesity and Prostate Cancer Risk According to Tumor TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusion Status.', 'Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor affects the survival of primary prostate cancer patients depending on TMPRSS2-ERG status.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.', 'Aspirin in the Management of Patients with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radiotherapy: Friend or Foe?', 'Use of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs for Chemoprevention of Inflammation-induced Prostate Cancer.', 'Family history of prostate cancer and the incidence of ERG- and phosphatase and tensin homolog-defined prostate cancer.', 'A Prospective Study of Aspirin Use and Prostate Cancer Risk by TMPRSS2:ERG Status.', 'Corpora amylacea in prostatectomy tissue and associations with molecular, histological, and lifestyle factors.', 'Association of tumor-infiltrating T-cell density with molecular subtype, racial ancestry and clinical outcomes in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Patients with prostate cancer who were hormone-naive and scheduled to receive long-term ADT were recruited between 2011 and 2013. Body weight, abdominal circumference and blood testing associated with lipid and glucose metabolism were recorded every 3 months during 1 year of ADT. Computed tomography (CT) was performed to measure areas of subcutaneous and visceral fat before and after 1 year of ADT. ADT was limited to a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist with or without bicalutamide.  Results:   Of 218 patients registered, data were available from 177 patients who completed 1 year of ADT. Of these, CT was performed before and after 1 year of ADT in 88 patients. Median age was 75 years (range, 49-85 years). Median PSA before ADT was 16.7 ng ml(-1) (range, 0.3-3316). Clinical stage was B (54.2%), C (23.2%) and D (20.9%). Mean increases in body weight and abdominal circumference after 1 year of ADT were 2.9 and 3.0%, respectively. Mean increases in total, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were 10.6, 14.3, 7.8 and 16.2%, respectively. Mean increases in fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were 3.9 and 2.7%, respectively. Lipid alterations were noted in patients without comorbidities, whereas changes in HbA1c were noted in patients with diabetes mellitus at baseline. These lipid and glucose alterations were prominent in the early ADT period. Both visceral and subcutaneous fat, as measured by CT, increased by >20%. The increase in subcutaneous fat was significantly greater than that in visceral fat (P=0.028).  Conclusions:   One year of ADT significantly changed lipid and glucose metabolism in Japanese patients with prostate cancer.

Variables included attitudes women's role, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, behavioral intention, and prostate cancer screening promotion behavior. A survey composed of the Eastland Prostate Cancer Survey subscales that were consistent with the TPB was distributed via e-mail to potential participants. The survey was live for 12 weeks (March 2013 to May 2013). Responses were collated with eSurv.org. Data were analyzed using latent path analysis and structural equation modeling.  Results:   Behavioral intentions in promoting prostate cancer screening significantly predicted the likelihood of the Italian women to adopt self-reported prostate cancer screening promotion behaviors. In addition, the exclusive direct impact of the intentions explained 39% of the variance in self-reported behaviors.  Conclusions:   The TPB could represent a good framework to explain the role of Italian women in prevention behaviors related to the prostatic screening domain.

Methods:   The questionnaire consisted of seven sections: (1) clinical uses of IMRT, (2) treatment planning systems, treatment machines, phantoms for verification and CT scanning, (3) absorbed dose verification, (4) dose distribution verification, (5) fluence map verification, (6) acceptance criteria for each verification, and (7) comments.  Results:   The questionnaire was completed by 129 institutions (response rate: 76.8%). IMRT was performed for prostate cancer in 125 institutions (96.9%), followed by head and neck cancer in 83 (64.3%), and brain tumors in 69 (53.5%). Although at least three individuals were engaged in IMRT QA in 77.5% of the institutions, the number of full-time persons involved in IMRT QA was one or less in 94 institutions (72.9%). This indicated that most institutions in Japan have a staff shortage. More than 90% of the institutions verified both the absorbed dose and dose distribution. The acceptance criterion for the absorbed dose verification was set to ±3% in at least 80% of the institutions. Gafchromic film was used for the majority of dose distribution verifications. The acceptance criteria for dose distribution verification mainly involved gamma analysis and a comparison of dose profiles; however, the judgment of acceptance did not depend on the results of the gamma analysis.  Conclusion:   This survey increases our understanding of how institutions currently perform IMRT QA analysis. This understanding will help to move institutions toward more standardization of IMRT QA in Japan.""","""['Mitsuhiro Nakamura', 'Hiraku Iramina', 'Masanori Takamiya', 'Tomohiro Ono', 'Mami Akimoto', 'Nobutaka Mukumoto', 'Yoshitomo Ishihara', 'Satoru Utsunomiya', 'Takehiro Shiinoki', 'Yuki Miyabe', 'Sayaka Sato', 'Hajime Monzen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Igaku Butsuri""","""['Clinical introduction of a linac head-mounted 2D detector array based quality assurance system in head and neck IMRT.', 'Dosimetric verification of brain and head and neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment using EDR2 films and 2D ion chamber array matrix.', 'National survey of patient specific IMRT quality assurance in China.', 'Tolerance limits and methodologies for IMRT measurement-based verification QA: Recommendations of AAPM Task Group No. 218.', 'Dosimetry tools and techniques for IMRT.', 'Assessment of using a gamma index analysis for patient-specific quality assurance in Japan.', 'Dosimetric Evaluation of the Treatment Plan on Indigenous Heterogeneous Phantoms using Analytical Anisotropic Algorithm and Acuros-XB Algorithm for Different Photon Energies.', 'Multi-institutional evaluation using the end-to-end test for implementation of dynamic techniques of radiation therapy in Thailand.']"""
