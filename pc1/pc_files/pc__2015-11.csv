According to various sources, metastases in the spine are found during autopsy in 30-90% of patients with a history of cancer. So far, there have been no full-scale studies of the quality of life of patients with various metastatic tumors of the spine who underwent surgical treatment in Russian literature. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the need for implementing the comprehensive treatment of patients with metastases in the spine and target setting as the main tool to identify the factors that adversely affect the patients' quality of life.  Material and methods:   The quality of life of 56 patients aged 16 to 81 years was assessed, including 26 males and 30 females. Twenty-six patients underwent surgical treatment between 2002 and 2009, and thirty patients underwent surgical treatment between 2009 and 2014. Kidney cancer was a primary disease in 30.3% of patients, multiple myeloma was a primary disease in 23.1% of cases, and the primary source of a tumor was not identified in cancer screening in 10.5% of cases. There were also isolated cases of melanoma, thymoma, metastases of tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, uterus, ovary, lung, prostate, pancreas, and the thyroid gland, which on the average amounted to 3.5% (1.8 to 7.14%). The quality of life of patients was studied using the EORTC QLQ C30 scale. The patients were surveyed prior to the surgery and then 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgical treatment during 1 year or until death. Preoperative and postoperative contrast-enhanced SCT and MRI examinations were used to control the extent of decompression of neural structures.  Results:   On the basis of these findings, the authors identified the main factors affecting the quality of life of patients and formulated a range of treatment goals for patients with metastases in the spine.  Conclusion:   Surgical treatment has a positive effect on the quality of life of patients with metastases in the spine. However, it is not a key factor in the context of survival rate of these patients. Therefore, a decision on the possibility and necessity of surgical treatment should be taken in cooperation with the patient and oncologists of different specialties.""","""['N A Konovalov', 'A G Nazarenko', 'D S Asyutin', 'A V Solenkova', 'R A Onoprienko', 'B A Zakirov', 'S Yu Timonin', 'I U Cherkiev', 'M A Martynova', ""A V Kosyr'kova"", 'V A Korolishin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Zh Vopr Neirokhir Im N N Burdenko""","""['Postoperative quality-of-life assessment in patients with spine metastases treated with long-segment pedicle-screw fixation.', 'Comparison of minimally invasive surgery with standard open surgery for vertebral thoracic metastases causing acute myelopathy in patients with short- or mid-term life expectancy: surgical technique and early clinical results.', 'Analysis of surgical treatment and effect of spinal metastatic tumors.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Spinal Metastases in the Postoperative Setting: A Secondary Analysis of Mature Phase 1-2 Trials.', 'Quality of life in patients with primary and metastatic brain cancer as reported in the literature using the EORTC QLQ-BN20 and QLQ-C30.', 'Surgical management of spinal metastases of thymic carcinoma: A case report and literature review.', 'Successful treatment of malignant thymoma with sacrum metastases: A case report and review of literature.', ""The preparation of rat's acellular spinal cord scaffold and co-culture with rat's spinal cord neuron in vitro.""]"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 388 men underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, including T2-weighted, diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging before biopsy. Two radiologists used PI-RADS to allocate a score of 1 to 5 for suspicion of significant prostate cancer (Gleason 7 with more than 5% grade 4). PI-RADS 3 to 5 was considered positive. Transperineal template guided mapping biopsy of 18 regions (median 30 cores) was performed with additional manually directed cores from magnetic resonance imaging positive regions. The anatomical location, size and grade of individual cancer areas in the biopsy regions (18) as the primary outcome and in prostatectomy specimens (117) as the secondary outcome were correlated to the magnetic resonance imaging positive regions.  Results:   Of the 388 men who were enrolled in the study 344 were analyzed. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was positive in 77.0% of patients, 62.5% had prostate cancer and 41.6% had significant prostate cancer. The detection of significant prostate cancer by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging had a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 36%, negative predictive value of 92% and positive predictive value of 52%. Adding PI-RADS to the multivariate model, including prostate specific antigen, digital rectal examination, prostate volume and age, improved the AUC from 0.776 to 0.879 (p <0.001). Anatomical concordance analysis showed a low mismatch between the magnetic resonance imaging positive regions and biopsy positive regions (4 [2.9%]), and the significant prostate cancer area in the radical prostatectomy specimen (3 [3.3%]).  Conclusions:   In men with an abnormal prostate specific antigen/digital rectal examination, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging detected significant prostate cancer with an excellent negative predictive value and moderate positive predictive value. The use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to diagnose significant prostate cancer may result in a substantial number of unnecessary biopsies while missing a minimum of significant prostate cancers.""","""['J E Thompson', 'P J van Leeuwen', 'D Moses', 'R Shnier', 'P Brenner', 'W Delprado', 'M Pulbrook', 'M Böhm', 'A M Haynes', 'A Hayen', 'P D Stricker']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging guided diagnostic biopsy detects significant prostate cancer and could reduce unnecessary biopsies and over detection: a prospective study.', 'A Single Center Evaluation of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging against Transperineal Prostate Mapping Biopsy: An Analysis of Men with Benign Histology and Insignificant Cancer following Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy.', 'Comparative analysis of transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy versus magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion guidance.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Use of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) for Prostate Cancer Detection with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Diagnostic Meta-analysis.', 'Predicting prostate cancer in men with PSA levels of 4-10\xa0ng/mL: MRI-based radiomics can help junior radiologists improve the diagnostic performance.', 'The Prostate Health Index and multi-parametric MRI improve diagnostic accuracy of detecting prostate cancer in Asian populations.', 'Recent advances of multimoda ultrasound in image-guided prostate-targeted biopsy.', 'Therapy decisions after diagnosis of prostate cancer in men with negative prostate MRI.', 'Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging can predict prostate cancer with risk for positive surgical margins.']"""

The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of low-dose docetaxel in combination with dexamethasone.  Methods:   Thirty-seven CRPC patients were administered a treatment regimen consisting of 50 mg/m2 docetaxel once every 3-4 weeks and 1 mg dexamethasone daily at our institution, between November 2004 and April 2014.  Results:   Twenty-four patients (65%) had a decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >50%. The median overall survival (OS) and PSA progression-free survival were 26.2 and 10.0 months, respectively. Ten of 12 patients (83%) taking analgesic agents reduced their intake because of decreased pain levels. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia occurred in 2 patients (5%). Nonhematological toxicities were less frequent but sometimes severe. Treatment-related death occurred in 2 octogenarian patients, 1 due to gastric bleeding and the other due to infective endocarditis.  Conclusion:   Low-dose docetaxel in combination with dexamethasone is feasible in Japanese CRPC patients. Hematological toxicity is less than that seen with standard docetaxel therapy, but it is necessary to monitor patients for severe nonhematological toxicities, particularly very elderly patients.""","""['Noriyoshi Miura', 'Nozomu Tanji', 'Yutaka Yanagihara', 'Terutaka Noda', 'Seiji Asai', 'Kenichi Nishimura', 'Akitomi Shirato', 'Yuki Miyauchi', 'Tadahiko Kikugawa', 'Masayoshi Yokoyama']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Chemotherapy""","""['Low-dose prednisolone in first-line docetaxel for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: is there a clinical benefit?', 'Weekly low-dose docetaxel combined with estramustine and dexamethasone for Japanese patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Changes in fPSA level could discriminate tPSA flare-up from tPSA progression in patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer during the initial phase of docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'Metronomic oral cyclophosphamide chemotherapy possibly contributes to stabilization of disease in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a prospective analysis of consecutive cases.', 'Oncological outcome of docetaxel-based chemotherapy for Japanese men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'In vitro and in vivo effects of a recombinant anti-PSMA immunotoxin in combination with docetaxel against prostate cancer.']"""

Prostate cancer cells often metastasize to the bone with a complex microenvironment of cytokines favoring cell survival. In this study, the cell stemness influence of a group of interleukins including IL-3, 6, 10, 11 and 24 on human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 was explored in vitro. Sulforhodamine B(SRB) and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were applied to examine the effect on cell proliferation, and wound healing and transwell assays were used for migration and invasion studies, in addition to colony formation, Western blotting and flowcytometry for the expression of stemness factors and chemotherapy sensitivity. We observed that ILs-3, 6 and 11 stimulated while ILs-10 and 24 inhibited the growth, invasion and migration of both cell lines. Interestingly, ILs-3, 6 and 11 significantly promoted colony formation and increased the expression of SOX2, CD44 and ABCG2 in both prostate cancer cell lines. However, ILs-10 and 24 showed the opposite effect on the expression of these factors. In line with the above findings, treatment with either IL-3 or IL-6 or IL-11 decreased the chemosensitivity to docetaxel while treatment with either IL-10 or IL-24 increased the sensitivity of docetaxel chemotherapy. In conclusion, our results suggest that ILs-3, 6 and 11 function as tumor promoters while ILs-10 and 24 function as tumor suppressors in the prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP in vitro, and such differences may attribute to their different effect on the stemness of PCa cells.""","""['Dandan Yu', 'Yali Zhong', 'Xiaoran Li', 'Yaqing Li', 'Xiaoli Li', 'Jing Cao', 'Huijie Fan', 'Yuan Yuan', 'Zhenyu Ji', 'Baoping Qiao', 'Jian-Guo Wen', 'Mingzhi Zhang', 'Gunnar Kvalheim', 'Jahn M Nesland', 'Zhenhe Suo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['IL-32θ inhibits stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cancer stem cells via the STAT3 pathway in colon cancer.', 'Wild-type p53 suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness in PC-3 prostate cancer cells by modulating miR‑145.', 'Suppression of prostate cancer progression by cancer cell stemness inhibitor napabucasin.', 'Interleukin-6 and prostate cancer: Current developments and unsolved questions.', 'Emerging interleukin targets in the tumour microenvironment: implications for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumours.', 'Role of adipocyte browning in prostate and breast tumor microenvironment.', 'Tumor microenvironment enriches the stemness features: the architectural event of therapy resistance and metastasis.', 'Psychosocial Stress and Age Influence Depression and Anxiety-Related Behavior, Drive Tumor Inflammatory Cytokines and Accelerate Prostate Cancer Growth in Mice.', 'Apoptosis Deregulation and the Development of Cancer Multi-Drug Resistance.', 'Interleukin (IL)-24: Reconfiguring the Tumor Microenvironment for Eliciting Antitumor Response.']"""

However, the order in which mutations occur is an open question and the inference of the temporal ordering at the gene level could potentially impact on patient treatment. Thus, exploiting recent observations suggesting that the occurrence of mutations is a non-memoryless process, we developed a computational approach to infer timed oncogenetic directed acyclic graphs (TO-DAGs) from human tumor mutation data. Such graphs represent the path and the waiting times of alterations during tumor evolution. The probability of occurrence of each alteration in a path is the probability that the alteration occurs when all alterations prior to it have occurred. The waiting time between an alteration and the subsequent is modeled as a stochastic function of the conditional probability of the event given the occurrence of the previous one. TO-DAG performances have been evaluated both on synthetic data and on somatic non-silent mutations from prostate cancer and melanoma patients and then compared with those of current well-established approaches. TO-DAG shows high performance scores on synthetic data and recognizes mutations in gatekeeper tumor suppressor genes as trigger for several downstream mutational events in the human tumor data.""","""['Paola Lecca', 'Nicola Casiraghi', 'Francesca Demichelis']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Estimation of Directed Acyclic Graphs Through Two-stage Adaptive Lasso for Gene Network Inference.', 'Inferring dynamic genetic networks with low order independencies.', 'Causal inference in cumulative risk assessment: The roles of directed acyclic graphs.', 'Association chain graphs: modelling etiological pathways.', 'Cancer evolution: mathematical models and computational inference.', 'Timed hazard networks: Incorporating temporal difference for oncogenetic analysis.', 'Effects of ordered mutations on dynamics in signaling networks.', 'Molecular Evolution of Early-Onset Prostate Cancer Identifies Molecular Risk Markers and Clinical Trajectories.', 'Construction and analysis of gene-gene dynamics influence networks based on a Boolean model.', 'Progression inference for somatic mutations in cancer.']"""

These open-label phase I and II studies [Androgen Receptor Modulation Optimized for Response-1 (ARMOR1) and ARMOR2 part 1] evaluated the efficacy and safety of galeterone in patients with treatment-naive nonmetastatic or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and established a dose for further study.  Experimental design:   In ARMOR1, 49 patients received increasing doses (650-2,600 mg) of galeterone in capsule formulation; 28 patients in ARMOR2 part 1 received increasing doses (1,700-3,400 mg) of galeterone in tablet formulation for 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated biweekly for safety and efficacy, and pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed.  Results:   In ARMOR1, across all doses, 49.0% (24/49) achieved a ≥30% decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA; PSA30) and 22.4% (11/49) demonstrated a ≥50% PSA decline (PSA50). In ARMOR2 part 1, across all doses, PSA30 was 64.0% (16/25) and PSA50 was 48.0% (12/25). In the 2,550-mg dose cohort, PSA30 was 72.7% (8/11) and PSA50 was 54.5% (6/11). Galeterone was well tolerated; the most common adverse events were fatigue, increased liver enzymes, gastrointestinal events, and pruritus. Most were mild or moderate in severity and required no action and there were no apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) events.  Conclusions:   The efficacy and safety from ARMOR1 and ARMOR2 part 1 and the pharmacokinetic results support the galeterone tablet dose of 2,550 mg/d for further study.

Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to evaluate the difference in disease-overall survival associated with the expression levels of FLII and AR. Prostate cancer cells stably expressing FLII or shRNA knockdown were used for functional analyses. Immunoprecipitation, Luciferase reporter, and immunofluorescence staining assays were performed to examine the functional interaction between FLII and AR.  Results:   Our analysis of the expression levels of FLII in a clinical gene expression array dataset showed that the expression of FLII was positively correlated with the overall survival of prostate cancer patients exhibiting high levels of AR expression. Examination of protein and mRNA levels of FLII showed a significant decrease of FLII expression in human prostate cancers. AR and FLII formed a complex in a ligand-dependent manner through the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AR. Subsequently, we observed a competitive binding to AR between FLII and the ligand. FLII inhibited AR transactivation and decreased AR nuclear localization. Furthermore, FLII contributed to castration-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cell growth through AR-dependent signaling, and reintroduction of FLII in prostate cancer cells sensitized the cells to bicalutamide and enzalutamide treatment.

Both GATA-3 and FOXA1 are useful markers for breast carcinoma, but their expression in the different breast cancer subtypes and other neoplasms has not been thoroughly evaluated. We examined the expression of GATA-3 and FOXA1 in estrogen receptor-positive, Her2/neu-positive, and triple-negative breast carcinomas as well as in 10 other common carcinomas, including hepatocellular, colonic, pancreatic, gastric, endometrial (endometrioid), lung, prostatic, renal cell, urothelial, and ovarian serous carcinomas. Primary and metastatic melanomas and mesotheliomas were also evaluated. GATA-3 and FOXA1 staining of estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinomas was seen in 96.6% and 96.2%, respectively. In triple-negative breast carcinomas, GATA-3 and FOXA1 staining was seen in 21.6% and 15.9%, respectively.

However, the mechanisms by which SPOP functions as a tumor suppressor remain poorly understood. Here, we show that SPOP promotes senescence, an important tumor suppression mechanism, by targeting the SENP7 deSUMOylase for degradation. SPOP is upregulated during senescence. This correlates with ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SENP7, which promotes senescence by increasing HP1α sumoylation and the associated epigenetic gene silencing. Ectopic wild-type SPOP, but not its cancer-associated mutants, drives senescence. Conversely, SPOP knockdown overcomes senescence. These phenotypes correlate with ubiquitination and degradation of SENP7 and HP1α sumoylation, subcellular re-localization, and its associated gene silencing. Furthermore, SENP7 is expressed at higher levels in prostate tumor specimens with SPOP mutation (n = 13) compared to those with wild-type SPOP (n = 80). In summary, SPOP acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting senescence through degrading SENP7.""","""['Hengrui Zhu', 'Shancheng Ren', 'Benjamin G Bitler', 'Katherine M Aird', 'Zhigang Tu', 'Emmanuel Skordalakes', 'Yasheng Zhu', 'Jun Yan', 'Yinghao Sun', 'Rugang Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Rep""","""['Speckle-type POZ protein suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration and invasion via ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of SUMO1/sentrin specific peptidase 7.', 'Mutated SPOP E3 Ligase Promotes 17βHSD4 Protein Degradation to Drive Androgenesis and Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Destruction of DDIT3/CHOP protein by wild-type SPOP but not prostate cancer-associated mutants.', 'Deregulation of SPOP in Cancer.', 'The ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP in cancer.', 'SPOP mutations promote tumor immune escape in endometrial cancer via the IRF1-PD-L1 axis.', 'SPOP in Cancer: Phenomena, Mechanisms and Its Role in Therapeutic Implications.', 'SENP7 overexpression protects cancer cells from oxygen and glucose deprivation and associates with poor prognosis in colon cancer.', 'Cancer-Associated Dysregulation of Sumo Regulators: Proteases and Ligases.', 'SENP7 senses oxidative stress to sustain metabolic fitness and antitumor functions of CD8+ T cells.']"""

This study aimed to investigate the prostate tumor uptake, photothermal therapy mediated macromolecular delivery, acute and chronic biodistribution profiles, and organ residence time differences between two nanoparticles, i.e., gold nanocages and gold nanorods. These particles have tunable surface plasmon resonances in the near infrared, but dissimilar shapes. Gold nanocages and nanorods had very different light to heat transduction efficiencies, with gold nanocages requiring 18.4 times fewer particles and approximately half the gold mass of gold nanorods to achieve the same heating profile given a constant laser intensity. It was also observed that while the photothermal macromolecular delivery enhancements were similar for the two systems when dosed by optical density, the tumoral uptake and biodistribution profiles for each of these shapes differed, with the nanocages residing in the liver, kidneys and spleen for less time than the nanorods. Additionally, it was observed that the nanocages were excreted from the body at a higher percentage of injected dose than the nanorods at both the 7 and 28 day time points.

The combination of anatomical and functional imaging provided in this exam significantly increases the accuracy of prostate cancer detection. Computed tomography (CT) imaging has so far been found to be lacking in this regard, however observations at our academic institution as well as evidence present in the literature support the proposition that CT could indeed be helpful in detecting prostate abnormalities that correspond to neoplasm. The purpose of this study was to prove that areas of focal mass-like enhancement on CT imaging directly correlate with prostate neoplasms as revealed on multi-parametric MRI and follow-up targeted biopsy.  Materials and methods:   This was a single institution retrospective study with 27 male subjects. Inclusion criteria required subjects to have a multi-parametric MRI of the prostate between January 1, 2014 and June 1, 2015 and a pelvic venous phase contrast-enhanced CT study between January 1, 2000 and June 1, 2015. Two blinded Radiologists read subjects' CT scans for any abnormalities of the prostate. CT and multi-parametric MRI results were compared and were considered concordant if focal or mass like enhancement to a greater degree than the background parenchyma was detected in the same areas of the prostate on CT scan as areas of decreased T2 signal, perfusion abnormalities, and restricted diffusion on multi-parametric MRI.  Results:   CT results were directly compared to multi-parametric MRI findings and biopsy results. The overall agreement of MRI and CT is 85.19% (95% CI: 67.52-94.08%). The positive percent agreement is 78.95% (95% CI: 54.43-93.95%) and the negative percent agreement is 100.0% (95% CL: 63.06-100.0%). When CT results are directly compared to biopsy results, sensitivity and specificity of CT are 63.64% (95% CI: 30.79-89.07%) and 100.0% (95% CI: 47.82-100.0%). The positive predictive value (PPV) is 100.0% (95% CI: 59.04-100.0%) and the negative predictive value (NPV) is 55.56% (95% CI: 21.2-86.3%). When compared to MRI, CT has a lower sensitivity and a higher specificity, as well as a higher PPV and NPV. Logistic regression analysis did not show a significant relationship between concordance of MRI and CT and Gleason score, time between studies, age, and Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.  Conclusion:   Incidental focal areas of mass-like enhancement in the peripheral prostate detected on venous phase contrast-enhanced CT imaging may indeed correlate with prostate neoplasm and it would be prudent to suggest further work-up with PSA and perhaps multi-parametric MRI, especially in high-risk patients.""","""['Jemianne Bautista Jia', 'Roozbeh Houshyar', 'Sadhna Verma', 'Edward Uchio', 'Chandana Lall']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Seminal vesicle invasion on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging: Correlation with histopathology.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of biparametric vs multiparametric MRI in clinically significant prostate cancer: Comparison between readers with different experience.', '3.0 T multiparametric prostate MRI using pelvic phased-array coil: utility for tumor detection prior to biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.', 'Personalizing approaches to the management of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: role of advanced imaging, genetics and therapeutics.', 'Role of molecular imaging in the detection of localized prostate cancer.', 'Incidental detection of prostate cancer with computed tomography scans.', 'Impact of spectral body imaging in patients suspected for occult cancer: a prospective study of 503 patients.', '4D perfusion CT of prostate cancer for image-guided radiotherapy planning: A proof of concept study.']"""

Methods:   Men with treatment-naïve bone metastatic PC were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 fashion to receive ADT, toremifene 60 mg plus ADT (TOPADT), or raloxifene 60 mg plus ADT (RAPADT). The primary endpoint was the biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate, and secondary endpoints were changes of scores of the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the functional assessment of cancer therapy (FACT).  Results:   A total of 15 men, 5 each, were allocated to one of the three treatment arms. The basal serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 198 ng/mL (median, range; 30-8428).

This burden can be estimated with the metric 'years of life lost' (YLL), which combines overall mortality and age at death.  Methods:   Using United Kingdom data from 2010, we compared research funding from the National Cancer Research Institute to this YLL burden metric for 26 types of cancers in order to identify the discrepancies between cancer research funding allocation and societal burden. We also compared these values to United States data from 2010 and United Kingdom data published in 2005.  Results:   Our study revealed a number of discrepancies between cancer research funding and burden. Some cancers are funded at levels far higher than their relative burden suggests (testicular, leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast, cervical, ovarian, prostate) while other cancers appear under-funded (gallbladder, lung, nasopharyngeal, intestine, stomach, pancreatic, thyroid, oesophageal, liver, kidney, bladder, and brain/central nervous system). United Kingdom funding patterns over the past decade have generally moved to increase funding to previously under-funded cancers with one notable exception showing a converse trend (breast cancer). The broad relationship between United Kingdom and United States funding patterns is similar with a few exceptions (e.g. leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, testicular cancer).  Conclusions:   There are discrepancies between cancer research funding allocation and societal burden in the United Kingdom. These discrepancies are broadly similar in both the United Kingdom and the United States and, while they appear to be improving, this is not consistent across all types of cancer.""","""['Ashley J R Carter', 'Beverly Delarosa', 'Hannah Hur']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Health Res Policy Syst""","""['A comparison of cancer burden and research spending reveals discrepancies in the distribution of research funding.', 'Investments in cancer research awarded to UK institutions and the global burden of cancer 2000-2013: a systematic analysis.', 'Years of life lost (YLL) from cancer is an important measure of population burden--and should be considered when allocating research funds.', 'The case for increased funding for research in pulmonary and critical care.', 'Worldwide under-funding of stroke research.', 'Global trends in oncology research: A mixed-methods study of publications and clinical trials from 2010 to 2019.', 'Improving the Early Diagnosis of Gastric Cancer.', 'Burden of cancer in Poland analysed using potential years of life lost.', 'The relationship between government research funding and the cancer burden in South Korea: implications for prioritising health research.', 'A world map of esophagus cancer research: a critical accounting.']"""

Low PSA levels among men with Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer may be owing to cellular dedifferentiation rather than low disease burden. We hypothesized that men with Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer and low PSA levels have increased risk for advanced disease and worse survival.  Materials and methods:   Men diagnosed from 2004 to 2007 with Gleason 8-10 prostate adenocarcinoma in the National Cancer Data Base were included. Patients were stratified by PSA levels at diagnosis: 0.1 to 3.9, 4.0 to 9.9, 10.0 to 19.9, and≥20.0ng/ml. Outcomes were clinical TNM category, pathologic stage (for prostatectomy patients), and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used.  Results:   A total of 37,283 patients were included. Men with PSA levels of<4.0ng/ml were more likely than those with PSA levels of 4 to 9.9ng/ml to present with clinical T3-4 disease (15% vs. 10%, P<0.001), nodal (4% vs. 2%, P<0.001) and distant (5% vs. 3%, P<0.001) metastasis. However, among patients treated with prostatectomy, lower PSA levels were not associated with increased likelihood of pathologic T3-4 disease or nodal metastasis. Six-year OS was 89.1% (PSA: 0.1-3.9ng/ml) vs. 91.0% (PSA: 4.0-9.9ng/ml) for prostatectomy (log-rank P<0.001), and 75.8% vs. 81.0% for radiotherapy (P<0.001).

The developmental mechanism of prostatitis is not yet unraveled which led to the elaboration of various biomarkers. As changes in asparagine-linked-(N-)-glycosylation were observed between healthy volunteers (HV), patients with benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer patients, a difference could exist in biochemical parameters and urinary N-glycosylation between HV and prostatitis patients. We therefore investigated if prostatic protein glycosylation could improve the diagnosis of prostatitis.  Materials and methods:   Differences in serum and urine biochemical markers and in total urine N-glycosylation profile of prostatic proteins were determined between HV (N=66) and prostatitis patients (N=36). Additionally, diagnostic accuracy of significant biochemical markers and changes in N-glycosylation was assessed.  Results:   Urinary white blood cell (WBC) count enabled discrimination of HV from prostatitis patients (P<0.001). Urinary bacteria count allowed for discriminating prostatitis patients from HV (P<0.001). Total amount of biantennary structures (urinary 2A/MA marker) was significantly lower in prostatitis patients compared to HV (P<0.001). Combining the urinary 2A/MA marker and urinary WBC count resulted in an AUC of 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI)=(0.70-0.89) which was significantly better than urinary WBC count (AUC=0.70, 95% CI=[0.59-0.82], P=0.042) as isolated test.  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated the diagnostic value of urinary N-glycosylation profiling, which shows great potential as biomarker for prostatitis.

In the present study, we aimed to detect metastasis in the pelvic lymph node by using combination of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Single-scattering spectra in the 450-750nm wavelength regions were obtained from the total of 83 reactive lymph node and 12 metastatic lymph node samples from 10 prostatic cancer patients.

The current analysis is to evaluate the burden of fracture risk in the New Zealand prostate cancer (PCa) population treated with ADT, and to understand the subsequent risk of mortality after a fracture.  Methods:   Using datasets created through linking records from the New Zealand Cancer Registry, National Minimal Dataset, Pharmaceutical Collection and Mortality Collection, we studied 25,544 men (aged ≥40 years) diagnosed with PCa between 2004 and 2012. ADT was categorised into the following groups: gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, anti-androgens, combined androgen blockade (GnRH agonists plus anti-androgens), bilateral orchiectomy, and bilateral orchiectomy plus pharmacologic ADT (anti-androgens and/or GnRH agonists).  Results:   Among patients receiving ADT, 10.8 % had a fracture compared to 3.2 % of those not receiving ADT (p < 0.0001). After controlling for age and ethnicity, the use of ADT was associated with a significantly increased risk of any fracture (OR = 2.83; 95 % CI 2.52-3.17) and of hip fracture requiring hospitalisation (OR = 1.82; 95 % CI 1.44-2.30). Those who received combined androgen blockade (OR = 3.48; 95 % CI 3.07-3.96) and bilateral orchiectomy with pharmacologic ADT (OR = 4.32; 95 % CI 3.34-5.58) had the greatest risk of fracture. The fracture risk following different types of ADT was confounded by pathologic fractures and spinal cord compression (SCC). ADT recipients with fractures had a 1.83-fold (95 % CI 1.68-1.99) higher mortality risk than those without a fracture. However, after the exclusion of pathologic fractures and SCC, there was no increased risk of mortality.  Conclusions:   ADT was significantly associated with an increased risk of any fracture and hip fracture requiring hospitalisation. The excess risk was partly driven by pathologic fractures and SCC which are associated with decreased survival in ADT users. Identification of those at higher risk of fracture and close monitoring of bone health while on ADT is an important factor to consider.

This selective usage might be driven by reimbursement constraints or identification of appropriate medical indications.  Introduction:   Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is increasingly being used for imaging a variety of cancers, including urologic cancers. The precise utility of PET scanning for bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not yet well known. We examined the trends in PET scan usage for 3 cancers using a large population-based data set.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed all individuals identified with a diagnosis of nonmetastatic bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and RCC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data set for 2004 to 2009 with follow-up data available to 2010. Logistic regression analysis and χ(2) and trend tests were performed to determine the predictors of performing PET scanning. Separate models were run for each of the cancer diagnoses. All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.3, and P < .05 was considered significant.  Results:   We identified 20,865, 70,414, and 7007 patients with a diagnosis of bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and RCC, respectively, from 2004 to 2009. PET scans had been performed for 3.60% of patients with bladder cancer, 1.09% of those with prostate cancer, and 5.32% of those with RCC. On regression analysis, a more recent year of diagnosis, younger age, and high stage or grade were predictors of PET scan usage for patients with bladder cancer and RCC. A higher Gleason score and higher D'Amico risk group predicted imaging with prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   The usage of PET scanning for bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and RCC is increasing but still very selective. The selective use might be driven by a combination of reimbursement constraints and careful identification of the appropriate medical indication.""","""['Oluwakayode Adejoro', 'Amin Alishahi', 'Ayman Soubra', 'Badrinath Konety']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Positron emission tomography in urologic oncology.', 'FDG in Urologic Malignancies.', 'Recent developments in urologic oncology: positron emission tomography molecular imaging.', 'Variation in positron emission tomography use after colon cancer resection.', 'Recommendation for clinical practice: use of PET-FDG in cancer of the kidney, prostate, testicles, and the urinary bladder.']"""

Objective:   We sought to explore the value of several novel quantitative metrics of Gleason 4 disease for the prediction of BCR in men with Gleason 7 disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed a cohort of 2630 radical prostatectomy cases from 1990-2007. All pathologic Gleason 7 cases were identified and assessed for quantity of Gleason pattern 4. Three methods were used to quantify the extent of Gleason 4: a quantitative Gleason score (qGS) based on the proportion of tumor composed of Gleason pattern 4, a size-weighted score (swGS) incorporating the overall quantity of Gleason 4, and a size index (siGS) incorporating the quantity of Gleason 4 based on the index lesion.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Associations between the above metrics and BCR were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.  Results and limitations:   qGS, swGS, and siGS were significantly associated with BCR on multivariate analysis when adjusted for traditional Gleason score, age, prostate specific antigen, surgical margin, and stage. Using Harrell's c-index to compare the scoring systems, qGS (0.83), swGS (0.84), and siGS (0.84) all performed better than the traditional Gleason score (0.82).  Conclusions:   Quantitative measures of Gleason pattern 4 predict BCR better than the traditional Gleason score.  Patient summary:   In men with Gleason 7 prostate cancer, quantitative analysis of the proportion of Gleason pattern 4 (quantitative Gleason score), as well as size-weighted measurement of Gleason 4 (size-weighted Gleason score), and a size-weighted measurement of Gleason 4 based on the largest tumor nodule significantly improve the predicted risk of biochemical recurrence compared with the traditional Gleason score.""","""['Fang-Ming Deng', 'Nicholas M Donin', 'Ruth Pe Benito', 'Jonathan Melamed', 'Julien Le Nobin', 'Ming Zhou', 'Sisi Ma', 'Jinhua Wang', 'Herbert Lepor']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Is it Time to Start Quantifying the Amount of High-grade Cancer on Pathology?', 'Radical prostatectomy and positive surgical margins: relationship with prostate cancer outcome.', 'The quantitative Gleason score improves prostate cancer risk assessment.', 'New Prostate Cancer Grading System Predicts Long-term Survival Following Surgery for Gleason Score 8-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'Variability in Outcomes for Patients with Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer (Gleason Score 7, International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason Group 2-3) and Implications for Risk Stratification: A Systematic Review.', 'Variance of Tumor Grade at Radical Prostatectomy With Assessment of Each Tumor Nodule Versus Global Grading.', 'Predicting prostate cancer specific-mortality with artificial intelligence-based Gleason grading.', 'Practice patterns related to prostate cancer grading: results of a 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society clinician survey.', 'Up-regulation of LIMK1 expression in prostate cancer is correlated with poor pathological features, lymph node metastases and biochemical recurrence.', 'Reduced Connexin 43 expression is associated with tumor malignant behaviors and biochemical recurrence-free survival of prostate cancer.']"""

The precise estimates of these outcomes have so far been based on small series.  Objective:   This analysis pools the sexual domain related patient reported outcomes from three prospective, registered studies that represent a range of inclusion criteria.  Design, setting, and participants:   One-hundred and eighteen men with localised prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen ≤ 15ng/ml, Gleason ≤ 4+3, stage ≤ T3aN0M0) treated in a tissue-preserving manner using high intensity focused ultrasound from three registered studies were included. Data on International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scores and use of phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors were collected at baseline, and 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, 9 mo, and 12 mo postoperatively. The IIEF-15 total and individual domain scores were used to assess overall sexual function. Urinary function was assessed with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS quality-of-life, and UCLA-Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite continence questionnaires. General health status was derived by means of the Charlson score. Multiple linear regression was used to assess whether age, grade, stage, qualitative scores (IIEF, IPSS, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, Charlson), or focal therapy type duration were associated with IIEF-5 and IIEF-15 scores at 12 mo.  Results and limitations:   Median age was 63 yr (interquartile range [IQR] 52-70 yr). Median IIEF-erectile score at baseline was 23 (IQR 11-28). This declined significantly to 9 (IQR 3-22, p<0.01) at 1 mo, but improved to 20 (IQR 9-29, p=0.30) at 1 yr posttreatment. Changes in total IIEF and other IIEF domains were only significantly different from preoperative values at 1 mo and 3 mo postoperatively. In the same period, the proportion of men using phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors was 10% preoperatively, reaching 43% and 42% at 6 mo and 9 months before declining to 37% at 1 yr. The only baseline determinants of postoperative erectile function were total IIEF and IIEF-erectile function scores (p=0.002). The primary limitation of our study is the relatively short follow-up of 1 yr.  Conclusion:   Men who received a range of tissue preserving therapies from the three pertinent studies experienced small decreases in total IIEF, erectile, and individual sexual domain scores that are not significantly different to those recorded at baseline. The only determinant of erectile dysfunction after tissue preserving therapy was preoperative erectile dysfunction status. Tissue preservation confers a high probability of maintaining erectile function that appears independent of all perioperative factors with the exception of baseline status.  Patient summary:   In this report, the largest prospectively collected and published set of patients with erectile dysfunction outcomes post-focal therapy for prostate cancer, we have found a return to baseline International Index of Erectile Function-erectile and total International Index of Erectile Function scores by 6 mo post-focal therapy which was maintained at 1 yr, with the majority of patients not on any form of medical treatment for their erectile dysfunction at that point. Focal therapy may represent a suitable alternative for men of any age or comorbidity wishing to maintain erectile function.""","""['Tet Yap', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Richard G Hindley', 'Stephanie Guillaumier', 'Neil McCartan', 'Louise Dickinson', 'Mark Emberton', 'Suks Minhas']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Excellent Erectile Function Recovery after Focal Therapy: Is This Enough?', 'Reply from Authors re: Giorgio Gandaglia, Alberto Briganti, Andrea Salonia, Francesco Montorsi.

Methods:   This was an economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised trial of highly distressed adult cancer patients and carers calling cancer helplines. Services used by participants were measured using a resource use questionnaire, and quality-adjusted life years were measured using the assessment of quality of life - eight-dimension - instrument collected through a computer-assisted telephone interview. The base case analysis stratified participants based on the baseline score on the Brief Symptom Inventory.

The results were subjected to sensitivity analysis by varying unit costs for resource use and the method for handling missing data.  Results:   No significant differences were found in overall total costs or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between intervention groups. Bootstrapped data suggest the PI had a higher probability of lower cost and greater QALYs for both carers and patients with high distress at baseline.

An essential prerequisite for obtaining quantitative values from DCE-MRI is the determination of the arterial input function (AIF). However, it is very challenging to accurately estimate the AIF using MR. A comprehensive model, which uses complex data instead of either magnitude or phase, was developed to improve AIF estimation.  Theory and methods:   The model was first applied to simulated data. Subsequently, the accuracy of the estimated contrast agent concentration was validated in a phantom. Finally the method was applied to existing DCE scans of 13 prostate cancer patients.  Results:   The complex signal method combines the complementary strengths of the magnitude and phase method, increasing the precision and accuracy of concentration estimation in simulated and phantom data. The in vivo AIFs show a good agreement between arterial voxels (standard deviation in the peak and tail equal 0.4 mM and 0.12 mM, respectively). Furthermore, the dynamic behavior closely followed the AIF obtained with DCE-CT in the same patients (mean correlation coefficient: 0.92).  Conclusion:   By using the complex signal, the AIF estimation becomes more accurate and precise. This might enable patient specific AIFs, thereby improving the quantitative values obtained from DCE-MRI.

Methods:   Process maps were developed for each phase of care from the initial urologic visit through 12 years of follow-up for robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), cryotherapy, high-dose rate (HDR) and low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), and active surveillance (AS). The last modality incorporated both traditional transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy and multiparametric-MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy. The costs of materials, equipment, personnel, and space were calculated per unit of time and based on the relative proportion of capacity used. TDABC for each treatment was defined as the sum of its resources.  Results:   Substantial cost variation was observed at 5 years, with costs ranging from $7,298 for AS to $23,565 for IMRT, and they remained consistent through 12 years of follow-up. LDR brachytherapy ($8,978) was notably cheaper than HDR brachytherapy ($11,448), and SBRT ($11,665) was notably cheaper than IMRT, with the cost savings attributable to shorter procedure times and fewer visits required for treatment. Both equipment costs and an inpatient stay ($2,306) contributed to the high cost of RALP ($16,946). Cryotherapy ($11,215) was more costly than LDR brachytherapy, largely because of increased single-use equipment costs ($6,292 vs $1,921). AS reached cost equivalence with LDR brachytherapy after 7 years of follow-up.  Conclusions:   The use of TDABC is feasible for analyzing cancer services and provides insights into cost-reduction tactics in an era focused on emphasizing value. By detailing all steps from diagnosis and treatment through 12 years of follow-up for low-risk prostate cancer, this study has demonstrated significant cost variation between competing treatments.""","""['Aaron A Laviana', 'Annette M Ilg', 'Darlene Veruttipong', 'Hung-Jui Tan', 'Michael A Burke', 'Douglas R Niedzwiecki', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Chris R King', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Chandan R Kundavaram', 'Mitchell Kamrava', 'Alan L Kaplan', 'Andrew K Moriarity', 'William Hsu', 'Daniel J A Margolis', 'Jim C Hu', 'Christopher S Saigal']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Time-driven activity-based cost comparison of prostate cancer brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Time-driven activity-based costing of low-dose-rate and high-dose-rate brachytherapy for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Cost of New Technologies in Prostate Cancer Treatment: Systematic Review of Costs and Cost Effectiveness of Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy, Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy, and Proton Beam Therapy.', 'Active surveillance vs. treatment for low-risk prostate cancer: a cost comparison.', 'Economic evaluation of treatments for patients with localized prostate cancer in Europe: a systematic review.', 'Prostate brachytherapy utilization in the COVID-19 era: A\xa0cross-sectional study of radiation oncologists in the United States.', 'Long-Term Medical Resource Consumption of Radical Prostatectomy vs. Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Old Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Pragmatic considerations and approaches for measuring staff time as an implementation cost in health systems and clinics: key issues and applied examples.', 'Feasibility of in-office MRI-targeted partial gland cryoablation for prostate cancer: an IDEAL stage 2A study.', 'Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing of CT-Guided vs MR-Guided Prostate SBRT.']"""

This study aims to examine changes in temporal trends in major cancer mortality.  Materials and methods:   Mortality data for 1993-2012 were obtained from the Korean Statistics Information Service(KOSIS) database and age-standardized to the 2000 Korean population. Joinpoint analysis was used to identify significant changes in trends over time. The annual percentage rate change (APC) was computed for each segment of the trends.  Results:   The age-standardized mortality rates (ASR) for all cancer sites combined decreased by 9.1% and 1.1% in men and women, respectively, from 1983 to 2012. ASRs from cancers of esophagus, stomach, and liver decreased substantially, whereas ASRs from cancer for all other sites increased markedly. ASRs for all cancer sites combined increased until 1994 and thereafter decreased significantly in both genders except for the period of 1998-2002 (APC: -5.5% for men [p<0.05] and 0.07% for women). ASRs for esophagus and liver cancers increased until the early 1990s and thereafter declined, leading to significant decreases [p<0.05] for esophagus cancer (APC: -1.85% for men and -3.82% for women) and liver cancer (APC: -1.55% for men and -0.56% for women) in 1983-2012. ASRs for stomach cancer declined (APC: -4.06% for men and -4.07% for women) except for 1990-1994. ASRs for uterine cancer peaked in 2003 and then declined (APC: 2.85%). ASRs increased significantly until 2002 for colorectal cancer in men (APC: 7.52%) and lung cancer in both genders. The most consistently upward trend was observed for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (APC: 3.55% for men and 5.29% for women; number of joinpoints=0). The greatest ASR increase was seen for prostate cancer for which mortality increased until 2002 at an APC of 12.56%.  Conclusion:   While mortality decreased significantly for esophagus, stomach and liver cancers in recent decades in Korea, challenges still remain for many other cancers, especially pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Surveillance of cancer mortality trends can lend valuable insights as to the prevention and control of cancer.

Twenty-two prostate cancer patients underwent DCE-MRI. Data were acquired on a 3T scanner using an mDixon sequence. Gadobenate dimeglumine was injected twice, at doses of 0.015 and 0.085 mmol/kg. Directly measured AIFs were fitted with empirical mathematical models (EMMs) and compared to the AIF derived from a muscle reference tissue (AIFref). EMMs accurately fitted the AIFs. The 1st and 2nd pass peaks were visualized in AIFLD, but not in AIFSD, thus the peak and shape of AIFSD could not be accurately measured directly. The average scaling factor between AIFSD and AIFLD in the washout phase was only 56% of the contrast dose ratio (~6:1).

We assessed whether MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsies diagnosed more perineural invasion compared with standard techniques. We reviewed our prospectively maintained prostate biopsy database evaluating men who underwent MP-MRI and MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsy between January 2014 and June 2015. Patients underwent MP-MRI followed by 12-core standard biopsy and fusion-guided biopsies of MRI-identified lesions. Patients' clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings were reviewed. A total of 114 patients underwent both 12-core standard biopsy and MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsy. The mean age and prebiopsy prostate-specific antigen of our patient cohort was 64.5 years and 10.7 ng/mL, respectively. Sixty-four of 114 (56%) patients were found to have PCa. Perineural invasion was identified in 19/64 (30%) patients. Of the patients with perineural invasion, 9 were diagnosed on the fusion biopsy only, 2 were diagnosed on standard biopsy only, and 8 were diagnosed on both standard and fusion biopsies. Perineural invasion was significantly associated with higher prostate-specific antigen and with a higher number of cores involved by cancer (P<0.05). Compared with standard biopsy, MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsy improves detection of perineural invasion in PCa. As perineural invasion has only been studied on standard biopsies to date, it is unclear whether this finding has the same clinical significance for MP-MRI targeted lesions.""","""['Jennifer B Gordetsky', 'Jeffrey W Nix', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Higher Prostate Cancer Grade Groups Are Detected in Patients Undergoing Multiparametric MRI-targeted Biopsy Compared With Standard Biopsy.', 'Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in Biopsy-naive Men with Suspected Prostate Cancer Based on Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen Values: Results from a Randomized Prospective Blinded Controlled Trial.', 'Analysis of histological findings obtained combining US/mp-MRI fusion-guided biopsies with systematic US biopsies: mp-MRI role in prostate cancer detection and false negative.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (MRI/US)-fusion biopsy platforms in prostate cancer detection: a systematic review.', 'An update on prostate biopsy in the era of magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Target prostate biopsies: How best to report in synoptic format?', 'PTEN and ERG detection in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion targeted prostate biopsy compared to systematic biopsy.', 'Imaging as a Personalized Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification.', 'Detection of extraprostatic disease and seminal vesicle invasion in patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging-targeted prostate biopsies.', 'Should reporting of peri-neural invasion and extra prostatic extension be mandatory in prostate cancer biopsies? correlation with outcome in biopsy cases treated conservatively.']"""

Here, we report that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3)-a broad stress sensor-suppressed hormone-induced prostate carcinogenesis in mice. Although implantation of testosterone and estradiol (T+E2) pellets for 2 months in wild-type mice rarely induced prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in dorsal prostates (one out of eight mice), the loss of ATF3 led to the appearance of not only PIN but also invasive lesions in almost all examined animals. The enhanced carcinogenic effects of hormones on ATF3-deficient prostates did not appear to be caused by a change in estrogen signaling, but were more likely a consequence of elevated androgen signaling that stimulated differentiation of prostatic basal cells into transformation-preferable luminal cells. Indeed, we found that hormone-induced lesions in ATF3-knockout mice often contained cells with both basal and luminal characteristics, such as p63(+) cells (a basal-cell marker) showing luminal-like morphology, or cells double-stained with basal (CK5(+)) and luminal (CK8(+)) markers. Consistent with these findings, low ATF3 expression was found to be a poor prognostic marker for prostate cancer in a cohort of 245 patients.

We did a quality of life (QoL) substudy to assess PROs up to 24 months after conventionally fractionated or hypofractionated radiotherapy in the Conventional or Hypofractionated High Dose Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer (CHHiP) trial.  Methods:   The CHHiP trial is a randomised, non-inferiority phase 3 trial done in 71 centres, of which 57 UK hospitals took part in the QoL substudy. Men with localised prostate cancer who were undergoing radiotherapy were eligible for trial entry if they had histologically confirmed T1b-T3aN0M0 prostate cancer, an estimated risk of seminal vesicle involvement less than 30%, prostate-specific antigen concentration less than 30 ng/mL, and a WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive a standard fractionation schedule of 74 Gy in 37 fractions or one of two hypofractionated schedules: 60 Gy in 20 fractions or 57 Gy in 19 fractions. Randomisation was done with computer-generated permuted block sizes of six and nine, stratified by centre and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group. Treatment allocation was not masked. UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI), including Short Form (SF)-36 and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), or Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) and SF-12 quality-of-life questionnaires were completed at baseline, pre-radiotherapy, 10 weeks post-radiotherapy, and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-radiotherapy. The CHHiP trial completed accrual on June 16, 2011, and the QoL substudy was closed to further recruitment on Nov 1, 2009. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary endpoint of the QoL substudy was overall bowel bother and comparisons between fractionation groups were done at 24 months post-radiotherapy. The CHHiP trial is registered with ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN97182923.  Findings:   2100 participants in the CHHiP trial consented to be included in the QoL substudy: 696 assigned to the 74 Gy schedule, 698 assigned to the 60 Gy schedule, and 706 assigned to the 57 Gy schedule. Of these individuals, 1659 (79%) provided data pre-radiotherapy and 1444 (69%) provided data at 24 months after radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 50·0 months (IQR 38·4-64·2) on April 9, 2014, which was the most recent follow-up measurement of all data collected before the QoL data were analysed in September, 2014. Comparison of 74 Gy in 37 fractions, 60 Gy in 20 fractions, and 57 Gy in 19 fractions groups at 2 years showed no overall bowel bother in 269 (66%), 266 (65%), and 282 (65%) men; very small bother in 92 (22%), 91 (22%), and 93 (21%) men; small bother in 26 (6%), 28 (7%), and 38 (9%) men; moderate bother in 19 (5%), 23 (6%), and 21 (5%) men, and severe bother in four (<1%), three (<1%) and three (<1%) men respectively (74 Gy vs 60 Gy, ptrend=0.64, 74 Gy vs 57 Gy, ptrend=0·59). We saw no differences between treatment groups in change of bowel bother score from baseline or pre-radiotherapy to 24 months.  Interpretation:   The incidence of patient-reported bowel symptoms was low and similar between patients in the 74 Gy control group and the hypofractionated groups up to 24 months after radiotherapy. If efficacy outcomes from CHHiP show non-inferiority for hypofractionated treatments, these findings will add to the growing evidence for moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy schedules becoming the standard treatment for localised prostate cancer.

Our study showed that silibinin triggered autophagy through up-regulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II, formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) and punctuate of GFP-LC3, which was inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an inhibitor of specific autophagy. In addition, silibinin induced autophagy through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibition of ROS with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a ROS inhibitor, attenuated silibinin-triggered autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA enhanced the silibinin-induced apoptosis through the regulation of caspase-3 and PARP.

Methods:   Using a cross-sectional descriptive design, we recruited 139 men with prostate cancer receiving ADT at two university-based hospitals in South Korea. Participants completed a self-reported questionnaire and underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry testing. BMD (gm/cm(2)), bone health status (normal BMD, osteopenia, and osteoporosis), and lifestyle variables (physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption) were measured.  Results:   The prevalence in our sample was 49.6% for osteopenia and 17.3% for osteoporosis. In multivariate linear regression analyses, BMD was positively associated with body mass index, number of comorbidities, and level of physical activity and negatively associated with being unemployed or retired, having a lower monthly income, and being treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy alone. In logistic regression analyses, potential risk factors for osteoporosis were low monthly income (OR = 4.33, p = 0.011), receipt of radiation therapy (OR = 4.69, p = 0.018), and lack of regular physical activity (OR = 2.63, p = 0.035).

Material and methods:   For patients treated to 78 Gy with IG-IMRT (n=260) or 3D-CRT (n=215), for whom acute toxicity data were available, three types of surface maps were calculated: (1) total anorectum using regular intervals along a central axis with perpendicular slices, (2) the rectum next to the prostate, and (3) the anal canal (horizontal slicing). For each toxicity, an average dose map was calculated for patients with and without the toxicity and subsequently dose difference maps were constructed, 3D-CRT and IG-IMRT separately. P-values were based on permutation tests.  Results:   Dose distributions in patients with grade ⩾2 acute proctitis were significantly different from dose distributions in patients without toxicity, for IG-IMRT and 3D-CRT. At the cranial and posterior rectal site, in areas receiving moderate dose levels (≈25-50 Gy), dose differences up to 10 Gy were identified for IG-IMRT. For pain, cramps, incontinence, diarrhea and mucus loss significant differences were found as well.

Key genes were validated using previously published data and by tissue microarray analysis. Two molecular subgroups were identified with a significant overrepresentation of tumors from patients with biochemical recurrence in one of the groups. We successfully validated key transcripts association with recurrence using two publically available datasets totaling 669 patients. Twelve genes were found to be independent predictors of recurrence in multivariate logistical regression analysis.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed records of patients with urothelial cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent radical cystectomy at 19 contributing institutions from 2000 to 2013. Patients with cT2-4aN0M0 and eventual pN0 disease were selected for this analysis. Estimated overall survival was compared between patients with pT0 and pTa/Tis/T1 disease. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model for overall survival was generated to evaluate hazard ratios for variables of interest.  Results:   Of 1,543 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy during the study period 257 had pT0N0 and 207 had pTa/Tis/T1N0 disease.

We aimed to investigate whether VDR genetic variation influences survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma. The analysis involved 3566 incident single and multiple primary melanoma cases enrolled in the international population-based Genes, Environment, and Melanoma Study. Melanoma-specific survival outcomes were calculated for each of 38 VDR SNPs using a competing risk analysis after adjustment for covariates. There were 254 (7.1%) deaths due to melanoma during the median 7.6 years follow-up period. VDR SNPs rs7299460, rs3782905, rs2239182, rs12370156, rs2238140, rs7305032, rs1544410 (BsmI) and rs731236 (TaqI) each had a statistically significant (trend P values < 0.05) association with melanoma-specific survival in multivariate analysis. One functional SNP (rs2239182) remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing using the Monte Carlo method. None of the SNPs associated with survival were significantly associated with Breslow thickness, ulceration or mitosis.

However, the ability to optimize the fractionation regimen considering the physical dose distribution remains insufficient. This study aims to optimize the fractionation regimen, in which the authors propose a graphical method for selecting the optimal number of fractions (n) and dose per fraction (d) based on dose-volume histograms for tumor and normal tissues of organs around the tumor.  Methods:   Modified linear-quadratic models were employed to estimate the radiation effects on the tumor and an organ at risk (OAR), where the repopulation of the tumor cells and the linearity of the dose-response curve in the high dose range of the surviving fraction were considered. The minimization problem for the damage effect on the OAR was solved under the constraint that the radiation effect on the tumor is fixed by a graphical method. Here, the damage effect on the OAR was estimated based on the dose-volume histogram.  Results:   It was found that the optimization of fractionation scheme incorporating the dose-volume histogram is possible by employing appropriate cell surviving models. The graphical method considering the repopulation of tumor cells and a rectilinear response in the high dose range enables them to derive the optimal number of fractions and dose per fraction. For example, in the treatment of prostate cancer, the optimal fractionation was suggested to lie in the range of 8-32 fractions with a daily dose of 2.2-6.3 Gy.  Conclusions:   It is possible to optimize the number of fractions and dose per fraction based on the physical dose distribution (i.e., dose-volume histogram) by the graphical method considering the effects on tumor and OARs around the tumor. This method may stipulate a new guideline to optimize the fractionation regimen for physics-guided fractionation.""","""['Yasutaka Sugano', 'Masahiro Mizuta', 'Seishin Takao', 'Hiroki Shirato', 'Kenneth L Sutherland', 'Hiroyuki Date']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Graphical representation of the effects on tumor and OAR for determining the appropriate fractionation regimen in radiation therapy planning.', 'A mathematical study to select fractionation regimen based on physical dose distribution and the linear-quadratic model.', 'Limitations of a convolution method for modeling geometric uncertainties in radiation therapy: the radiobiological dose-per-fraction effect.', 'Increasing the Therapeutic Ratio of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy by Individualized Isotoxic Dose Prescription.', 'The linear-quadratic transformation of dose-volume histograms in fractionated radiotherapy.', 'Technical Note: Break-even dose level for hypofractionated treatment schedules.', '4-Methylumbelliferone administration enhances radiosensitivity of human fibrosarcoma by intercellular communication.', 'Selection of external beam radiotherapy approaches for precise and accurate cancer treatment.', 'Comparison of the average surviving fraction model with the integral biologically effective dose model for an optimal irradiation scheme.', 'Optimization of radiotherapy fractionation schedules based on radiobiological functions.']"""

Objective:   To add to the knowledge base regarding efficacy and potential benefits, including reduced side effects and improved quality of life (QoL), of IAD versus CAD in patients with nonmetastatic relapsing or locally advanced PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   A 42-mo phase 3b open-label randomised study in 933 patients from 20 European countries.  Intervention:   Following a 6-mo induction with leuprorelin acetate (Eligard) 22.5mg 3-mo depot, patients were randomised to CAD or IAD with leuprorelin for 36 mo.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression while receiving luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist, defined as three consecutive increasing PSA values ≥ 4 ng/ml ≥ 2 wk apart. Secondary end points included PSA progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), testosterone levels, performance status, and QoL.  Results and limitations:   A total of 933 patients entered the induction phase; 701 were randomised. The median number of injections administered after randomisation was 12 (range: 1-12) for the CAD group and 3 (range: 1-10) for the IAD group. There were no statistically significant or clinically relevant differences between the groups for time to PSA progression, PSA PFS, OS, mean PSA levels over time, or QoL. A similar number of adverse events was observed in each group; the most common were hot flushes and hypertension. Study limitations include the open-label design and absence of formal testosterone recovery assessment.  Conclusions:   IAD and CAD demonstrated similar efficacy, tolerability, and QoL in men with nonmetastatic PCa. The principal benefit of IAD compared with CAD is a potential cost reduction with comparable OS rates. There are no apparent QoL benefits.  Patient summary:   This randomised trial showed that both intermittent and continuous hormone therapy had similar efficacy, tolerability, and quality-of-life profiles in patients with relapsing M0 or locally advanced prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   The immortalized human bladder epithelial cell line SV-HUC-1 and the human bladder cancer cell lines RT-4 and 5637 together with human bladder cancer specimens collected from patients were used. A commercially available bladder cancer microarray was applied to confirm the findings. LC3 (light chain-3) II protein detection was done to determine the presence of autophagy.

Results:   Bladder cancer cell lines showed activated autophagic flux compared to SV-HUC-1 cells, prostate cancer cells and breast cancer cells. Results were confirmed in human bladder cancer specimens. Autophagy inhibition by Baf (bafilomycin) A1, or by knockdown of ATG (autophagy related protein) 7 or 12 induced cytotoxicity in multiple human bladder cell lines. Induction of apoptosis was found in cells with autophagy inhibition. Although the disruption of mitochondria membrane potential or the generation of reactive oxygen species was detected in Baf A1 treated cells, intensity was mild and not thought to be related to apoptosis of bladder cancer cells.

We investigated the association between comorbidity burden and higher risk disease among men eligible for active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   Using the National Cancer Data Base we identified 29,447 cases of low risk (Gleason score 6 or less, cT1/T2a, prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml) prostate cancer managed with prostatectomy from 2010 to 2011. The primary outcome was pathological upgrading (Gleason score greater than 6) or up staging (T3-T4/N1). The association between Charlson score and upgrading/up staging was analyzed using multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   The study sample comprised 29,447 men, of which 449 (1.5%) had Charlson scores greater than 1. At prostatectomy 44% of cases were upgraded/up staged. On multivariate analysis Charlson score greater than 1, age 70 years or greater, nonwhite race, higher prostate specific antigen and higher percentage of cores involved with disease were significantly associated with upgrading/up staging. After further adjusting for age, race, prostate specific antigen and core involvement, Charlson score remained a significant predictor of upgrading/up staging for younger white men. Specifically, white men less than 70 years old with Charlson comorbidity index greater than 1 had 1.3-fold higher odds of upgrading/up staging than men with Charlson comorbidity index 1 or less (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.67, p=0.029).  Conclusions:   Comorbidity burden is strongly and independently associated with pathological upgrading/up staging in men with clinically low risk prostate cancer.

Because disassembly of adhesion complexes through endocytosis of adhesion proteins has been shown to play a role in cell migration, we examined whether Cad11 endocytosis plays a role in Cad11-mediated migration. The mechanism by which Cad11 is internalized is unknown. Using a GST pulldown assay, we found that clathrin binds to the Cad11 cytoplasmic domain but not to that of E-cadherin. Using deletion analysis, we identified a unique sequence motif, VFEEE, in the Cad11 membrane proximal region (amino acid residues 11-15) that binds to clathrin. Endocytosis assays using K(+)-depletion buffer showed that Cad11 internalization is clathrin dependent. Proximity ligation assays showed that Cad11 colocalizes with clathrin, and immunofluorescence assays showed that Cad11 localizes in vesicles that stain for the early endosomal marker Rab5. Deletion of the VFEEE sequence from the Cad11 cytoplasmic domain (Cad11-cla-Δ5) leads to inhibition of Cad11 internalization and reduces Cad11-mediated cell migration in C4-2B and PC3-mm2 prostate cancer cells. These observations suggest that clathrin-mediated internalization of Cad11 regulates surface trafficking of Cad11 and that dynamic turnover of Cad11 regulates the migratory function of Cad11 in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Robert L Satcher', 'Tianhong Pan', 'Mehmet A Bilen', 'Xiaoxia Li', 'Yu-Chen Lee', 'Angelica Ortiz', 'Andrew P Kowalczyk', 'Li-Yuan Yu-Lee', 'Sue-Hwa Lin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['Angiomotin is a novel component of cadherin-11/β-catenin/p120 complex and is critical for cadherin-11-mediated cell migration.', 'Clathrin dependent endocytosis of E-cadherin is regulated by the Arf6GAP isoform SMAP1.', 'Cadherin-11 increases migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells and enhances their interaction with osteoblasts.', 'Non-classical use of clathrin during bacterial infections.', 'Migration cues interpretation by clathrin-coated structures.', 'Opposite changes in the expression of clathrin and caveolin-1 in normal and cancerous human prostate tissue: putative clathrin-mediated recycling of EGFR.', 'Identification of Novel Pyroptosis-Related Gene Signatures to Predict Prostate Cancer Recurrence.', 'The Effects of Mechanical Stretch on Integrins and Filopodial-Associated Proteins in Normal and Glaucomatous Trabecular Meshwork Cells.', 'Green nanotechnology of MGF-AuNPs for immunomodulatory intervention in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Lactic acid promotes metastatic niche formation in bone metastasis of colorectal cancer.']"""

The present study aimed to assess prospectively (over 1 year) different aspects of patients' QoL therapy with triptorelin in daily practice.  Patients and methods:   This prospective, noninterventional study at 129 centers in Germany included 608 patients with advanced PCa treated with triptorelin. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months, using validated EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 questionnaires. Predefined subgroup analyses were performed to assess the impact of demographics, anamnestic and clinical parameters on QoL.  Results and discussion:   The majority of patients with PCa under therapy with triptorelin showed generally stable global QoL over 1 year; approximately one-quarters of the patients had a clinically relevant improvement of their global QoL. In patients without previous PCa therapy and GnRH analogue treatment, significant improvements in global QoL were seen. At the same time, these patients also reported increased treatment-related symptoms. These data indicate that the perception of global QoL is not only influenced by subjective impairment through ADT-related side effects.""","""['A Eisenhardt', 'T Schneider', 'K Scheithe', 'C Colling', 'A Heidenreich;TRIPTOSIX-Studiengruppe']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['An Update on Triptorelin: Current Thinking on Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Quality-of-life outcomes from the Prostate Adenocarcinoma: TransCutaneous Hormones (PATCH) trial evaluating luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists versus transdermal oestradiol for androgen suppression in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for volume reduction, lower urinary tract symptom relief and quality of life improvement in patients with prostate cancer: degarelix vs goserelin plus bicalutamide.', 'Quality of life of 1276 elderly patients with prostate cancer, starting treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist: results of a French observational study.', 'Cardiovascular risk of androgen deprivation therapy for\xa0treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer : Differences\xa0between GnRH antagonists and GnRH agonists.', 'Effects of Initiating or Switching to a Six-Monthly Triptorelin Formulation on Prostate Cancer Patient-Healthcare Interactions and Hospital Resource Use: a Real-World, Retrospective, Non-Interventional Study.', 'Triptorelin for the relief of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with advanced prostate cancer: results of a prospective, observational, grouped-analysis study.', 'An Update on Triptorelin: Current Thinking on Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   This analysis is based on the DVPZ UroCloud data sets from 20 July 2015. The UroCloud reflects the web-based chronological disease development and quality parameters. For the descriptive analysis of particular key figures, available complete data sets were selected.  Results:   Of the centers 22 held a valid certificate and fulfilled all required case numbers and structural prerequisites at the primary certification or recertification. In three cases a reauditing led to requirements before certification. Since 2005 a total of 9650 PCA patients have been pseudonymized and followed up (41,247 follow-up forms, 4.3 forms per patient). In 2014 the median number of newly documented PCA patients was 61 per center (minimum 7 and maximum 295). Radical prostatectomy (RP) dominated with 4491 (56 %) cases followed by primary hormonal therapy (1210 cases, 15 %), irradiation (809, 10 %) and non-interventional therapy, such as active surveillance (AS) or watchful waiting (WW) in 760 cases (10 %). A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction was documented in 50 % of the patients with a preoperative PSA value > 20, in 60 % of pT4 tumors and in 50 % of patients with a tumor Gleason score of 9-10. A positive incision margin (R+) was found in in 15 % of pT2 stages, 41 % of pT3 stages and 85 % of pT4 stages. A secondary intervention was documented in 6.5 % of RP.  Conclusion:   The DVPZ certificate reflects the complete spectrum of treatment of PCA patients. The strength of the certificate lies in the documentation of patient development and a simultaneous collation of quality parameters.""","""['R Berges', 'T Ebert', 'W Schafhauser', 'W Schultze-Seemann', 'M Braun', 'J Herden', 'P Weib', 'M Garcia Schürmann', 'M Reimann', 'C Bornhof', 'F Oberpenning', 'P Baur', 'J Zumbé', 'E Gronau', 'W Diederichs', 'O A Brinkman', 'M Goepel', 'A Göll', 'K Hoefner', 'M Kriegmair', 'S Laabs', 'B Planz', 'G Platz', 'A Heidenreich']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Treatment quality of prostate cancer centers.

We examined the relationship between pre-diagnostic serum levels of vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium and risk of prostate cancer according to tumor aggressiveness.  Methods:   We performed a nested case-control study within the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study on 943 incident prostate cancer cases. Tumor aggressiveness was defined by Gleason score, TNM stage, and serum levels of total prostate-specific antigen. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for different quartiles of serum levels of 25OHD, PTH, and calcium, and for interactions between them.  Results:   We found no significant association when comparing aggressive to non-aggressive disease regarding vitamin D, PTH, or calcium. There was a trend toward an increased risk in low-grade tumors, i.e., Gleason score ≤6, and a significant association regarding Gleason score 7 tumors with OR 1.70 (1.09-2.65) in the highest quartile of vitamin D. Stratifying the analysis yielded several significant findings demonstrating a nonspecific interaction between the metabolites. In men with PTH above median, the risk of aggressive prostate cancer was double in the highest vitamin D quartile, OR 2.01 (1.24-3.25), and for non-aggressive cancer 1.82 (1.25-2.66). There was an inverse effect on risk of prostate cancer in men with PTH above median and vitamin D ≤50 nmol/L, OR 0.25 (0.09-0.71) and calcium ≤2.37 mmol/L, OR 0.53 (0.34-0.82) for aggressive cancer.  Conclusions:   This study showed no significant association when comparing aggressive to non-aggressive disease. There was a possible relationship between vitamin D and low-risk tumors.

Here we show that elevated Wnt signaling derived from Sost deficient osteoblasts promotes PC invasion, while rhSOST has an inhibitory effect. In contrast, rhDKK1 promotes PC elongation and filopodia formation, morphological changes characteristic of an invasive phenotype. Furthermore, rhDKK1 was found to activate canonical Wnt signaling in PC3 cells, suggesting that SOST and DKK1 have opposing roles on Wnt signaling in this context. Gene expression analysis of PC3 cells co-cultured with OBs exhibiting varying amounts of Wnt signaling identified CRIM1 as one of the transcripts upregulated under highly invasive conditions. We found CRIM1 overexpression to also promote cell-invasion. These findings suggest that bone-derived Wnt signaling may enhance PC tropism by promoting CRIM1 expression and facilitating cancer cell invasion and adhesion to bone. We concluded that SOST and DKK1 have opposing effects on PC3 cell invasion and that bone-derived Wnt signaling positively contributes to the invasive phenotypes of PC3 cells by activating CRIM1 expression and facilitating PC-OB physical interaction. As such, we investigated the effects of high concentrations of SOST in vivo.

A combinatorial approach was used to identify miRs that promote prostate cancer progression in a unique set of prostate cancer cell lines, which originate from the parental p69 cell line and extend to a highly tumorigenic/metastatic M12 subline. Together, these cell lines are thought to mimic prostate cancer progression in vivo. Previous network analysis and miR arrays suggested that the loss of hsa-miR-125b together with the overexpression of hsa-miR-22 could contribute to prostate tumorigenesis. The dysregulation of these two miRs was confirmed in human prostate tumor samples as compared to adjacent benign glandular epithelium collected through laser capture microdissection from radical prostatectomies. In fact, alterations in hsa-miR-125b expression appeared to be an early event in tumorigenesis. Reverse phase microarray proteomic analysis revealed ErbB2/3 and downstream members of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways as well as PTEN to be protein targets differentially expressed in the M12 tumor cell compared to its parental p69 cell. Relevant luciferase+3'-UTR expression studies confirmed a direct interaction between hsa-miR-125b and ErbB2 and between hsa-miR-22 and PTEN. Restoration of hsa-miR-125b or inhibition of hsa-miR-22 expression via an antagomiR resulted in an alteration of M12 tumor cell behavior in vitro. Thus, the dual action of hsa-miR-125b as a tumor suppressor and hsa-miR-22 as an oncomiR contributed to prostate tumorigenesis by modulations in PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, key pathways known to influence prostate cancer progression.""","""['William T Budd', 'Sarah J Seashols-Williams', 'Gene C Clark', 'Danielle Weaver', 'Valerie Calvert', 'Emanuel Petricoin', 'Ema A Dragoescu', ""Katherine O'Hanlon"", 'Zendra E Zehner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['MicroRNA-17-3p is a prostate tumor suppressor in vitro and in vivo, and is decreased in high grade prostate tumors analyzed by laser capture microdissection.', 'miR-9 Acts as an OncomiR in Prostate Cancer through Multiple Pathways That Drive Tumour Progression and Metastasis.', 'Tumor suppressor microRNAs, miR-100 and -125b, are regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in primary prostate cells and in patient tissue.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Double Face of miR-708: A Pan-Cancer Player with Dissociative Identity Disorder.', 'ERBB2-PTGS2 axis promotes intervertebral disc degeneration by regulating senescence of nucleus pulposus cells.', 'MicroRNA and Messenger RNA Expression Profiles in Canine Mammary Gland Tumor.', 'Hsa-miR-22-3p inhibits liver cancer cell EMT and cell migration/ invasion by indirectly regulating SPRY2.', 'An Immunocompetent Environment Unravels the Proto-Oncogenic Role of miR-22.', 'MiR-22 Deficiency Fosters Hepatocellular Carcinoma Development in Fatty Liver.']"""

We studied whether CK2 phosphorylates N-terminal end of ECE-1c as well as whether this has a role in migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. CK2 phosphorylated the N-terminal end of ECE-1c and this was precluded upon inhibition of CK2. Inhibition also led to diminished protein levels of both endogen ECE-1 or GFP-fused N-terminal end of ECE-1c in 293T embryonic and DLD-1 colon cancer cells, which highlighted the importance of this motif on UPS-dependent ECE-1c degradation. Full-length ECE-1c mutants designed either to mimic or abrogate CK2-phosphorylation displayed increased or decreased migration/invasion of colon cancer cells, respectively. Moreover, ECE-1c overexpression or its silencing with a siRNA led to increased or diminished cell migration/invasion, respectively.

Recently, it has been inferred that CAV2, a co-factor sub-type of CAV1, cross-talks with CAV1 and promotes tumor growth. We previously reported that plasma CAV1 levels are elevated in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but not in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (non-CRPC), implying that CAV1 may be a therapeutic target for CRPC. However, a correlation of CAV1 and CAV2 expression in PC has not yet been reported. Herein, we analyzed associations between PC progression and plasma CAV1 and -2 in Japanese men, and expression of CAV1 and -2 in PC3 (CRPC) and LNCaP (non-CRPC) cell lines.  Materials and methods:   We investigated plasma samples from 36 patients with CRPC and 22 with non-CRPC. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine plasma levels of CAV1 and -2, and examined correlations with clinicopathological characteristics such as Gleason grade and clinical T stage. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to evaluate CAV1 and CAV2 mRNA in PC cell lines. We also introduced CAV1- and CAV2-specific small interfering (siRNA) into PC3 cells to knock-down (KD) both molecules, and examined its influence on the expression of these genes between PC3 CAV1 and -2 KD cells and control cells.  Results:   Plasma CAV1 and -2 levels in patients with CRPC were significantly higher than in those with non-CRPC (CAV1, p=0.003; CAV2, p<0.001). Plasma levels of CAV1 and -2 were significantly correlated (p<0.001). However, we did not find any significant relationship between CAV1 or CAV2 expression and clinicopathological factors. ELISA and real-time qRT-PCR showed that both proteins and mRNAs in PC3 cells were significantly over-expressed compared to LNCaP cells (p<0.001). In PC3 CAV1 KD cells, expression of CAV2 was suppressed and confirmed the linkage of CAV2 KD and suppression of CAV1 expression.  Conclusion:   There was a significant correlation between plasma CAV-1 and -2 levels and progression of PC. CAV1 and -2 were highly expressed in the PC3 compared to the LNCaP cell line.

Hence, we designed a single-arm phase II trial to explore whether the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus can maintain the response to docetaxel without compromising quality of life.  Methods:   After successful docetaxel induction (75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks; 6-10 cycles), 21 CRPC patients underwent temsirolimus maintenance treatment (25 mg weekly; 4 weeks per cycle). The primary endpoint was the time to treatment failure (TTTF) (i.e., radiological and/or symptomatic progression). The secondary endpoints included the tumor response rate (RECIST 1.0), safety (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate [FACT-P]), pain (Present Pain Intensity [PPI] scale), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) parameters, including time to PSA progression (TTPP) according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group criteria, and serial enumeration of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and endothelial progenitor cells (CEPs).

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   To evaluate the utility of quantitative grading, the fraction of Gleason 3, 4, and 5 patterns seen in biopsies and prostatectomies were recorded. Gleason grade fractions were compared with prostatectomy findings and prostate-specific antigen recurrence.  Results and limitations:   Our data suggest a striking utility of quantitative Gleason grading. In prostatectomy specimens, there was a continuous increase of the risk of prostate-specific antigen recurrence with increasing percentage of Gleason 4 fractions with remarkably small differences in outcome at clinically important thresholds (0% vs 5%; 40% vs 60% Gleason 4), distinguishing traditionally established prognostic groups. Also, in biopsies, the quantitative Gleason scoring identified various intermediate risk groups with respect to Gleason findings in corresponding prostatectomies. Quantitative grading may also reduce the clinical impact of interobserver variability because borderline findings such as tumors with 5%, 40%, or 60% Gleason 4 fractions and very small Gleason 5 fractions (with pivotal impact on the Gleason score) are disclaimed.  Conclusions:   Quantitative Gleason pattern data should routinely be provided in addition to Gleason score categories, both in biopsies and in prostatectomy specimens.  Patient summary:   Gleason score is the most important prognostic parameter in prostate cancer, but prone to interobserver variation. The results of our study show that morphological aspects that define the Gleason grade in prostate cancer represent a continuum. Quantitation of Gleason patterns provides clinically relevant information beyond the traditional Gleason grading categories ≤ 3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 8, 9 -1 0. Quantitative Gleason scoring can help to minimize variations between different pathologists and substantially aid in optimized therapy decision-making.""","""['Guido Sauter', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Till Sebastian Clauditz', 'Till Krech', 'Corinna Wittmer', 'Florian Lutz', 'Maximilian Lennartz', 'Tim Janssen', 'Nayira Hakimi', 'Ronald Simon', 'Mareike von Petersdorff-Campen', 'Frank Jacobsen', 'Katharina von Loga', 'Waldemar Wilczak', 'Sarah Minner', 'Maria Christina Tsourlakis', 'Viktoria Chirico', 'Alexander Haese', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Markus Graefen', 'Uwe Michl', 'Georg Salomon', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Lars Henrik Budäus', 'Elena Hekeler', 'Julia Malsy-Mink', 'Sven Kutzera', 'Christoph Fraune', 'Cosima Göbel', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Thorsten Schlomm']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Utility of Reporting the Percentage of High-grade Prostate Cancer.', 'Gleason Score 7: When Qualitative Change Becomes Quantitative Change.', 'Integrating Tertiary Gleason 5 Patterns into Quantitative Gleason Grading in Prostate Biopsies and Prostatectomy Specimens.', 'A Contemporary Prostate Cancer Grading System: A Validated Alternative to the Gleason Score.', 'Phase 3 study of adjuvant radiotherapy versus wait and see in pT3 prostate cancer: impact of pathology review on analysis.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Clinical characteristics analysis and prognostic nomogram for predicting survival in patients with second primary prostate cancer: a population study based on SEER database.', 'Definitions of ""Cure"" After Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy in Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: Phoenix or Surgical?', 'Preclinical Efficacy of a PARP-1 Targeted Auger-Emitting Radionuclide in Prostate Cancer.', 'The highest percentage of Gleason Pattern 4 is a predictor in intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy Enables Gleason Scoring of Prostate Core Needle Biopsy by a Convolutional Neural Network.']"""

Objective:   Identification of the genomic landscape of HGPIN and the genomic differences between HGPIN and PCA that may drive the progression to PCA.  Design, settings, and participants:   We analyzed 20 regions of paired HGPIN and PCA from six patients using whole-exome sequencing and array-comparative genomic hybridization.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Somatic mutation and copy number alteration (CNA) profiles of paired HGPIN and PCA were measured and compared.  Results and limitations:   The number of total mutations and CNAs of HGPINs were significantly fewer than those of PCAs. Mutations in FOXA1 and CNAs (1q and 8q gains) were detected in both HGPIN and PCA ('common'), suggesting their roles in early PCA development. Mutations in SPOP, KDM6A, and KMT2D were 'PCA-specific', suggesting their roles in HGPIN progression to PCA. The 8p loss was either 'common' or 'PCA-specific'. In-silico estimation of evolutionary ages predicted that HGPIN genomes were much younger than PCA genomes. Our data show that PCAs are direct descendants of HGPINs in most cases that require more genomic alterations to progress to PCA. The nature of heterogeneous HGPIN population that might attenuate genomic signals should further be studied.  Conclusions:   HGPIN genomes harbor relatively fewer mutations and CNAs than PCA but require additional hits for the progression.  Patient summary:   In this study, we suggest a systemic diagram from high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) to prostate cancer (PCA). Our results provide a clue to explain the long latency from HGPIN to PCA and provide useful information for the genetic diagnosis of HGPIN and PCA.""","""['Seung-Hyun Jung', 'Sun Shin', 'Min Sung Kim', 'In-Pyo Baek', 'Ji Youl Lee', 'Sung Hak Lee', 'Tae-Min Kim', 'Sug Hyung Lee', 'Yeun-Jun Chung']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Shifting Paradigms for High-grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia.', 'High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia does not display loss of heterozygosity at the mutation locus in BRCA2 mutation carriers with aggressive prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA alteration and putative target genes in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer: STAT3 and ZEB1 are upregulated during prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Use of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in prostate needle biopsy specimens with isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia as a predictor of prostate adenocarcinoma on follow-up biopsy.', 'Histological markers of risk and the role of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: its morphological and molecular diagnosis and clinical significance.', 'SPOP in Cancer: Phenomena, Mechanisms and Its Role in Therapeutic Implications.', 'The SPOP-ITCH Signaling Axis Protects Against Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Immune infiltration phenotypes of prostate adenocarcinoma and their clinical implications.', 'Decoding the heterogeneous landscape in the development prostate cancer.', 'PIN-like ductal carcinoma of the prostate has frequent activating RAS/RAF mutations.']"""

Methods:   Medical records of 211 Chinese patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2006 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed, with follow-up time of 24.5 ± 27.0 months. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression analyses were applied to address the impact of BMI on adverse pathological outcomes and BCR following prostatectomy. A meta-analysis of published studies from MEDLINE or EMBASE was conducted to determine the relationship between BMI and BCR following prostatectomy among Asian populations.  Results:   Higher BMI was positively correlated with higher biopsy Gleason score (odds ratios (OR) 1.163, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.023-1.322, P = 0.021) and pathological Gleason score (OR 1.220, 95 % CI 1.056-1.410, P = 0.007) in multivariate analysis. BCR was detected in 48 patients (22.7 %). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that higher BMI (hazard ratio (HR) 1.145, 95 % CI 1.029-1.273, P = 0.013) and prostate-specific antigen (HR 1.659, 95 % CI 1.102-2.497, P = 0.015) levels were independent predictors of BCR. The meta-analysis enrolled eight Asian studies of 4145 patients treated by radical prostatectomy. Based on random-effects approach, a 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was correlated with 28 % higher risk of BCR (HR 1.22, 95 % CI 0.86-1.72) without statistical significance.  Conclusions:   The present study suggested that higher BMI was an independent risk factor for a higher Gleason score, as well as an independent predictor of BCR after radical prostatectomy in Chinese patients. Meta-analysis of Asian studies also indicated that obese patients, although without statistical significance, might be more likely to suffer from BCR.""","""['Pei-De Bai', 'Meng-Bo Hu', 'Hua Xu', 'Wen-Hui Zhu', 'Ji-Meng Hu', 'Tian Yang', 'Hao-Wen Jiang', 'Qiang Ding']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Surg Oncol""","""['Predictors of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in an Afro-Caribbean population in Guadeloupe (French West Indies).', 'Radical prostatectomy neutralizes obesity-driven risk of prostate cancer progression.', 'Predictive factors associated with biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy for pathological T2 prostate cancer with negative surgical margins.', 'Abdominal obesity, hypertension, antihypertensive medication use and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Different predictive values of microvessel density for biochemical recurrence among different PCa populations: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'MRI-measured periprostatic adipose tissue volume as a prognostic predictor in prostate cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'MRI-measured adipose features as predictive factors for detection of prostate cancer in males undergoing systematic prostate biopsy: a retrospective study based on a Chinese population.', 'Are Diabetic Patients at Increased Risk for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy?', 'Obesity and biochemical recurrence in clinically localised prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 86,490 patients.', 'Correlation between Body Mass Index and Gleason Score in Men with Prostate Cancer in Southeastern Nigeria.']"""

Methods:   This was a retrospective study, and the data were obtained from our institution's prospective database. Between September 2003 and 2013, a total of 36 consecutive patients with AAA in association with Ca underwent surgical repair. Of these, 9 patients were excluded because the Ca treatment was performed at another service. Most of the patients were male (22) and the most frequent form of neoplasia was prostate Ca. Surgery for AAA repair was performed after the Ca treatment in 19 cases, before Ca treatment in 7 cases and concomitantly in 1 case. The intraoperative characteristics, treatment technique used, complications, patients' clinical evolution, and survival outcomes were analyzed.  Results:   Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was used in 19 cases (70.4%) and conventional open repair (OR) in 8 cases (29.6%). Surgical treatment was uneventful in 19 cases, however, when present, postoperative complications occurred more frequently with EVAR (36.84% vs. 12.5%). There were no cases of death related to the aneurysm surgery. Most of the patients in both groups were alive at the end of the study. The probability of survival in our study was 65.8% at 3 years and 53% at 5 years, with no statistically significant difference between the EVAR and OR groups. The main cause of death was progression of the neoplastic disease.  Conclusions:   Patients who present Ca in association with AAA benefit from surgical treatment of both conditions, simultaneously or not. In these cases, it is important for the treatment to be individualized, and the disease of greater severity should be treated first.

Materials and methods:   Men scheduled for RP from March 1, 2012, to July 31, 2013, were eligible, and partners were invited. The 2.5-hour interactive seminar included multidisciplinary presentations about surgery-related urinary and sexual outcomes, rehabilitation, and couples' work toward recovering sexual intimacy. A satisfaction and knowledge survey was administered immediately afterward. We analyzed demographic and satisfaction data with descriptive statistics and evaluated congruence of patients' and partners' knowledge responses using nonparametric statistics.  Results:   Of 618 patients scheduled, 426 patients and 342 partners attended; 323 couples provided complete data. Over 90% of participants found the seminar informative and 74% found a group setting comfortable; 84% found travel to the seminar burdensome. Most patients and partners (84% and 90%, respectively) expected some urinary incontinence and understood rehabilitation strategies to regain bladder control; 84% of patients and 78% of partners expected postsurgery sexual activity to be different and 73% of patients and 65% of partners expected surgery to make erections worse. Couples were incongruent regarding frequency of incontinence, likelihood of erectile dysfunction, and sex being different after surgery: patients were more realistic.

Methods:   The analysis comprised 50 videos stored in digital format and recorded in a group of 50 patients during image-guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Fluoroscopy time was 10 seconds.

Results:   The average values and standard deviations of respiratory-induced prostate motion in the superior-inferior and left-right (lateral) directions were 2.6 ± 2.1 mm and 0.7 ± 0.7 mm, respectively. The CTV margins calculated according to the van Herk formula based on respiratory prostate motion were 8 mm in the superior-inferior direction and 2 mm in the lateral direction.

Aim:   To examine whether GPs' risk attitude, level of empathy, and burnout status are associated with PSA testing.  Design and setting:   Register and questionnaire study including 129 solo GPs (active in the Central Denmark Region) and 76 672 of their adult male patients with no history of or current prostate cancer diagnosis.  Method:   PSA tests from 2012 were retrieved from a register and classified as incident (that is, the first PSA test within 24 months), repeated normal, or repeated raised tests. This was merged with information on GPs' risk attitudes, empathy, and burnout status from a 2012 survey.  Results:   Patients registered with a GP with a high score on anxiety caused by uncertainty (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00 to 1.06, P = 0.025) or concern about bad outcomes (OR 1.04; 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.08, P = 0.034) were more likely to have an incident PSA test, whereas those registered with a GP with increased tolerance for ambiguity were less likely (OR 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.00, P = 0.025).

The SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 gene, SOX2, is an essential embryonic stem cell gene involved in prostate tumorigenesis. Here we assessed its implications in NED and progression of PC and its diagnostic and prognostic value. Laser microdissection, qRT-PCR, quantitative Methylation-Specific PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze SOX2 gene expression and regulation in 206 PC samples. Results were examined according to the patient's clinical pathological profile and follow-ups. Functional studies were performed using PC cells transfected to overexpress or silence SOX2. SOX2 was consistently downregulated in PC, except in cell clusters lying within lymph node (LN)-positive PC. Multivariate analysis revealed that SOX2 mRNA expression in the primary tumor was significantly associated with LN metastasis. When SOX2 mRNA levels were ≥1.00, relative to (XpressRef) Universal Total RNA, adjusted Odds Ratio was 24.4 (95% CI: 7.54-79.0), sensitivity 0.81 (95% CI: 0.61-0.93) and specificity 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81-0.91). Patients experiencing biochemical recurrence had high median levels of SOX2 mRNA. In both PC and LN metastasis, SOX2 and NED marker, Chromogranin-A, were primarily co-expressed. In PC cells, NED genes were upregulated by SOX2 overexpression and downregulated by its silencing, which also abolished SNAI2/Slug dependent NED. Moreover, SOX2 upregulated neural CAMs, neurotrophins/neurotrophin receptors, pluripotency and epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factors, growth, angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors, and promoted PC cell invasiveness and motility.

This study postulates that Time-To-Treatment could be used as a cancer quality-of -care surrogate in order to identify the association between cancer patient's SES and quality of care in a French comprehensive cancer center.  Methods:   retrospective mono-centered cohort study. All consecutive incoming adult patients diagnosed for breast cancer (BC), prostate cancer (PC), colorectal cancer (CRC), lung cancer (LC) or sarcoma (S) were included between January 2013 and December 2013. The association of EDI and Time-To-Diagnosis (TTD), as well as Time-To-Treatment (TTT) was analyzed using a cox regression, and a strata analysis per tumor site was performed.  Results:   969 patients were included. Primitive tumor site was 505 BC (52%), 169 PC (17%), 145 LC (15%), 116 CRC (12%), and 34 S (4%). Median TTD was 1.41 months (Q1-Q3 0.5 to 3.5 months). Median TTT was 0.9 months (0.4 - 1.4). In a multivariate analysis, we identified the tumor site as a predictive factor to influence TTD, shorter for BC (0.75 months, [0.30- 1.9]) than PC (4.69 months [1.6-29.7]), HR 0.27 95%CI = [0.22-0.34], p < 0.001. TTT was also shorter for BC (0.75 months [0.4-1.1]) than PC (2.02 [0.9-3.2]), HR 0.32 95%CI = [0.27-0.39], p < 0.001. EDI quintiles were not found associated with either TTT or TTD.  Conclusions:   Deprivation estimated by the EDI does not appear to be related to an extension of the Time-to-Diagnosis or Time-to-Treatment in our real-life population.

However, it is difficult to interpret cryptic results by routine experimental methods. In this study, we performed systematic and integrative analysis to detect key miRNAs that contribute to CRPC development. From three DNA microarray datasets, we retrieved 11 outlier microRNAs (miRNAs) that had expression discrepancies between ASPC and CRPC using a specific algorithm. Two of the miRNAs (miR-125b and miR-124) have previously been shown to be related to CRPC. Seven out of the other nine miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis. MiR-210, miR-218, miR-346, miR-197, and miR-149 were found to be over-expressed, while miR-122, miR-145, and let-7b were under-expressed in CRPC cell lines. GO and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that miR-218, miR-197, miR-145, miR-122, and let-7b, along with their target genes, were found to be involved in the PI3K and AKT3 signaling network, which is known to contribute to CRPC development. We then chose five miRNAs to verify the accuracy of the analysis. The target genes of each miRNA were altered significantly upon transfection of specific miRNA mimics in the C4-2 CRPC cell line, which was consistent with our pathway analysis results. Finally, we hypothesized that miR-218, miR-145, miR-197, miR-149, miR-122, and let-7b may contribute to the development of CRPC through the influence of Ras, Rho proteins, and the SCF complex.

A distended rectum contributes to excessive organ movement during treatment, resulting in significant underdosing of the target volume and higher treatment failure rates. The increasing use of highly conformal, precise radiotherapy techniques places greater importance on reducing this risk. We tested whether imaging during radiotherapy helps minimise the negative impact that rectal distension has on long-term tumour control.  Findings:   The rectal diameter (anterior/posterior and lateral) was prospectively measured at radiotherapy planning in 172 consecutive patients undergoing radical radiotherapy with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Daily, and then weekly, imaging during radiotherapy ensured that prostate movement remained within predefined tolerances. Patients were followed up for a median of 72 months with regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements to ascertain biochemical PSA relapse and survival information.  Conclusions:   In this cohort of predominately high-risk localised prostate cancer, rectal distension had no significant impact on PSA relapse.

Twenty men had prior negative biopsies and 12 were biopsy naïve. All biopsies were performed in the supine position using a table-mounted device and an 18 G biopsy gun.  Results:   The overall tumour detection rate was 53% (17/32). Two cores (median; range 1-4) were extracted. Clinically significant cancers were found in 94% (16/17). None of the patients showed any postbiopsy complications. The prostate volumes of patients with cancer were significantly lower (39.3 ml) than those of men without cancer (49.7 ml).

Erectile function was assessed with the IIEF-5 and the question ""Is your erectile function as good as before the surgery (yes/no)"". Patients were included if they were sexually active before surgery and had at least 1 year of follow-up. The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients returning to self-perceived baseline erectile function. Secondary outcome measures included the proportion of patients returning to baseline erectile function according to the IIEF-5 and predictors of return to baseline function.  Results:   Questionnaires from 210 patients were available. Overall, 14 patients (6.7%) reported that their erections were as good as before surgery. Bilateral nerve-sparing was the only significant predictor of a return to baseline erectile function (p = 0.004).

Genetic alternations, alcohol consumption, occupationally harmful exposure and even obesity are well-established risk factors of RCC. Omentin-1 is a plasma adipokine synthesized in visceral adipose tissue, and its circulating serum concentration alters not only in conditions associated with insulin resistance such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), but also in colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. To our best knowledge, the relationship between omentin-1 and RCC has not been clarified previously. Thus, we evaluated serum omentin-1 levels in RCC patients in the current matched case-control study. Forty-one patients newly diagnosed with RCC and forty-two healthy controls confirmed by the comprehensive medical examination were assessed. The omentin-1 concentrations were determined via utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in the paired groups, in which the patients and healthy controls had no statistically significant differences in gender, age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), waist-hip ratio (WHR), estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body-mass index (BMI) and biochemical parameters. The omentin-1 levels in healthy people were 9.86±1.44ng/mL and the circulating omentin-1 levels were dramatically decreased to 3.62±0.76ng/mL in RCC patients (p<0.001). Besides, we revealed a negative correlation between omentin-1 with WHR (r=-0.261, p=0.017) and BMI (r=-0.310, p=0.004), further indicating BMI was the main influential factor on omentin-1 levels (p=0.0091).

Methods:   A retrospective study was conducted, and the accuracy of the multiple-atlas-based segmentation was tested on 30 patients. The effect of library size (LS), number of atlases used for contour averaging and the contour averaging strategy were also studied. The autogenerated contours were compared with the manually drawn contours. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance were used to evaluate the segmentation agreement.  Results:   Mixed results were found between simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) and majority vote (MV) strategies. Multiple-atlas approaches were relatively insensitive to LS. A LS of ten was adequate, and further increase in the LS only showed insignificant gain. Multiple atlas performed better than single atlas for most of the time. Using more atlases did not guarantee better performance, with five atlases performing better than ten atlases. With our recommended setting, the median DSC for the bladder, rectum, prostate, seminal vesicle and femurs was 0.90, 0.77, 0.84, 0.56 and 0.95, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our study shows that multiple-atlas-based strategies have better accuracy than single-atlas approach. STAPLE is preferred, and a LS of ten is adequate for prostate cases. Using five atlases for contour averaging is recommended. The contouring accuracy of seminal vesicle still needs improvement, and manual editing is still required for the other structures.

These models synthesize available data on disease burden and intervention effectiveness to project estimates of the long-term consequences of care, which are often absent when clinical or policy decisions must be made. While models have been influential in informing US cancer screening guidelines under ideal conditions, incorporating detailed data on real-world screening practice has been limited given the complexity of screening processes and behaviors throughout diverse health delivery systems in the United States. We describe the synergies that exist between decision-analytic models and health care utilization data that are increasingly accessible through research networks that assemble data from the growing number of electronic medical record systems. In particular, we present opportunities to enrich cancer screening models by grounding analyses in real-world data with the goals of projecting the harms and benefits of current screening practices, evaluating the value of existing and new technologies, and identifying the weakest links in the cancer screening process where efforts for improvement may be most productively focused. We highlight the example of the National Cancer Institute-funded consortium Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR), a collaboration to harmonize and analyze screening process and outcomes data on breast, colorectal, and cervical cancers across seven research centers.

However, information on associations between RAI dose and second primary malignancy (SPM) is lacking.  Methods:   Patients without antecedent cancer age 20 years or older and newly diagnosed with thyroid cancer were recruited from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database between 1997 and 2010. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for the cancers were calculated to compare the incidence of thyroid cancer with the general population. The association between RAI dosage and cancer development was estimated using time-dependent Cox regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   A total of 692 cases of SPM were identified among 20 235 patients with thyroid cancer. Regarding the latter, 79.7% of the patients were women, the median age was 46 years, and the follow-up period included 134 178 person-years. The SIR for any SPM was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31 to 1.52). A statistically significantly higher SIR was observed in leukemia (2.74), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2.38), prostate (2.30), lung and mediastinum (1.93), pancreas (1.83), kidney (1.81), breast (1.48), and colon-rectum (1.31) cancers. Cumulative RAI dose (per 30 mCi increase) conferred a strong risk for SPM (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.02, P < .001) and leukemia (aHR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.04, P < .001) occurrences. A cumulative RAI dose greater than 150 mCi possessed a statistically significant risk for all cancer combined (aHR = 1.30) and leukemia (aHR = 6.03).

It is becoming increasingly understood that this disease entity continues to evolve over time, acquiring additional and diverse resistance mechanisms with each subsequent therapy used. This dynamic relationship between treatment pressure and disease resistance can be challenging for the managing clinician. The recent discovery of alternate splice variants of the androgen receptor (AR) is one potential mechanism of escape in mCRPC, and recognizing this resistance mechanism might be important for optimal treatment selection for our patients. AR-V7 appears to be the most relevant AR splice variant, and early clinical data suggest that it is a negative prognostic marker in mCRPC. Emerging evidence also suggests that detection of AR-V7 may be associated with resistance to novel hormonal therapy (abiraterone and enzalutamide) but may be compatible with sensitivity to taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel and cabazitaxel). Adding to this complexity is the observation that AR-V7 is a dynamic marker whose status may change across time and depending on selective pressures induced by different therapies. Finally, it is possible that AR-V7 may represent a therapeutic target in mCRPC if drugs can be designed that degrade or inhibit AR splice variants or block their transcriptional activity.

Research and validated instruments for sexual QoL assessment based on heterosexual samples have limited applicability for men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM).  Aim:   We aimed to create a validated instrument for assessing sexual needs and concerns of MSM post-PCa treatment. Here we explore post-PCa treatment sexual concerns for a sample of MSM, as the first part of this multi-phase project.  Methods:   Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 MSM face-to-face or via Internet-based video conferencing. Participants were asked open-ended questions about their experiences of sexual QoL following PCa. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, uploaded to NVivo 8(TM) , and analyzed using qualitative methodology.  Main outcome measure:   We have conducted semi-structure qualitative interviews on 16 MSM who were treated for PCa. Focus was on post-treatment sexual concerns.  Results:   The following themes were inductively derived: (i) erectile, urinary, ejaculation, and orgasmic dysfunctions; (ii) challenges to intimate relationships; and (iii) lack of MSM-specific oncological and psychosocial support for PCa survivorship. Sexual practices pre-treatment ranked in order of frequency were masturbation, oral sex, and anal sex, an ordering that prevailed post-treatment. Sexual QoL decreased with erectile, urinary, and ejaculation dysfunctions. Post-treatment orgasms were compromised. Some single men and men in non-monogamous relationships reported a loss of confidence or difficulty meeting other men post-treatment. Limited access to targeted oncological and psychosocial supports posed difficulties in coping with PCa for MSM.  Conclusions:   The negative impact on sexual QoL can be severe for MSM and requires targeted attention. Penile-vaginal intercourse and erectile function have been the primary focus of sexual research and rehabilitation for men with PCa, and do not adequately reflect the sexual practices of MSM. Our findings suggest that future research dedicated to MSM with PCa is needed to incorporate their sexual practices and preferences specifically into treatment decisions, and that targeted oncological and psychosocial support services are also warranted.""","""['Tsz Kin Lee', 'Ariel Baker Handy', 'Winkle Kwan', 'John Lindsay Oliffe', 'Lori Anne Brotto', 'Richard Joel Wassersug', 'Gary Wayne Dowsett']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Editorial Comment on ""The Impact of Prostate Cancer Treatment on the Sexual Quality of Life for Men-Who-Have-Sex-with-Men"".', 'Sexual rehabilitation and cancer survivorship: a state of art review of current literature and management strategies in male sexual dysfunction among prostate cancer survivors.', 'Health-Related Quality of Life, Psychological Distress, and Sexual Changes Following Prostate Cancer: A Comparison of Gay and Bisexual Men with Heterosexual Men.', 'Exploring the lived experience of gay men with prostate cancer: A phenomenological study.', ""Exploring gay couples' experience with sexual dysfunction after radical prostatectomy: a qualitative study."", 'Functional Quality-of-Life Outcomes Reported by Men Treated for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Literature Review.', 'Sexual characteristics of patients with prostate cancer seen for radiation treatment.', 'Sexual health and treatment-related sexual dysfunction in sexual and gender minorities with prostate cancer.', 'The Anatomy of a Hybrid In-Person and Virtual Sexual Health Clinic in Oncology.', 'Development of a Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire for Men-Who-Have-Sex-With-Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.']"""

These acyl-CoA esters were converted to unsaturated products by AMACR, but their use was limited by non-enzymatic elimination. Fluoride sensors were also investigated as a method of quantifying released fluoride and thus AMACR activity. These sensors generally suffered from high background signal and lacked reproducibility under the assay conditions. In summary, the elimination reaction can be used to characterise inhibitors, but it was not possible to develop a convenient colorimetric or fluorescent assay using 3-fluoro-2-methylacyl-CoA substrates.""","""['Maksims Yevglevskis', 'Guat L Lee', 'Jenny Sun', 'Shiyi Zhou', 'Xiaolong Sun', 'Gabriele Kociok-Köhn', 'Tony D James', 'Timothy J Woodman', 'Matthew D Lloyd']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Org Biomol Chem""","""['The perils of rational design--unexpected irreversible elimination of fluoride from 3-fluoro-2-methylacyl-CoA esters catalysed by α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR; P504S).', 'Structure-activity relationships of rationally designed AMACR 1A inhibitors.', 'Identification of novel small-molecule inhibitors of α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR; P504S) and structure-activity relationships.', 'α-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR): metabolic enzyme, drug metabolizer and cancer marker P504S.', ""Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase--an 'obscure' metabolic enzyme takes centre stage."", 'Racemases and epimerases operating through a 1,1-proton transfer mechanism: reactivity, mechanism and inhibition.', 'Carbon-fluorine bond cleavage mediated by metalloenzymes.']"""

This meta-analysis summarizes studies reporting overall survival, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and biochemical recurrence.  Methods:   PubMed and Embase were systematically reviewed to identify studies investigating the association between metformin use and clinical endpoints among men with prostate cancer while taking confounding by diabetes diagnosis into account. Pooled risk estimates (hazard ratios, HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Sensitivity analyses for quality components and factors for heterogeneity were conducted.  Results:   Of 549 articles identified, nine retrospective cohort studies representing 9,186 patients were included. There was significant heterogeneity between studies, and studies differed in quality. Metformin use was associated with improved overall survival in studies with clear risk window definition (HR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.86-0.90, p < 0.001) and in studies with potential immortal time bias (HR 0.52, 95 % CI 0.41-0.65, p < 0.001). No significant association with prostate cancer-specific mortality was detected (HR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.44-1.31, p = 0.33). Metformin use was associated with a decreased risk of biochemical recurrence (HR 0.79, 95 % CI 0.63-1.00, p = 0.047).  Conclusions:   This meta-analysis suggests a benefit of metformin in men with diabetes and prostate cancer. However, further carefully designed studies are needed to confirm findings and to assess potential generalization to non-diabetic, non-white, and less aggressively treated men with prostate cancer.""","""['Konrad H Stopsack', 'David R Ziehr', 'Jennifer R Rider', 'Edward L Giovannucci']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Impact of metformin on clinical outcomes among men with prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association between metformin therapy and incidence, recurrence and mortality of prostate cancer: evidence from a meta-analysis.', 'Metformin use and all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality among men with diabetes.', 'Metformin Improves Overall Survival of Colorectal Cancer Patients with Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Effect of Metformin and Statin Use on Survival in Pancreatic Cancer Patients: a Systematic Literature Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Effect of Metformin on the Prognosis of Gastric Cancer Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Meta-Analysis Based on Retrospective Cohort Studies.', 'A Retrospective Study of the Effect of Metformin on Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'American Association of Clinical Endocrinology Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan-2022 Update.', 'Prostate cancer-Exercise and Metformin Trial (Pre-EMpT): study protocol for a feasibility factorial randomized controlled trial in men with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer.']"""

This pathway is important in malignant transformation and accumulated evidence indicates that this pathway is involved in tumorigenesis and progression of several cancers. It was possible to assume that activation of JAK/STAT pathway is associated with increase in the expressions of ICAM/1 and VCAM-1. In this study we hypothesized that when cells were maintained as spheroids or monolayers, the structure of cancer stem cells (CSCs) could show differentiation when compared with non-CSCs.  Methods:   DU-145 human prostate cancer cells were cultured using the Ege University molecular embryology laboratory medium supplemented wıth 10% fetal bovine serum. Clusters of differentiation 133 (CD133)(+high)/CD44(+high) prostate CSCs were isolated from the DU145 cell line by using BD FACSAria. CD133//CD44+ CSCs were cultured until confluent with 3% noble agar. The expression of these proteins in CSCs and non-CSCs was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Different expression profiles were observed in the conventional two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) experimental model system when CSCs and non-CSCs were compared. Human prostate CSCs exhibited intense ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 immunoreaction when compared with non-CSCs. These findings were supported by the fact that VCAM-1 on the surface of cancer cells binds to its counterreceptor, the α4β1 integrin (also known as very-late antigen, VLA-4), on metastasis-associated macrophages, triggering VCAM-1-mediated activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase growth and survival pathway in cancer cells.

We reviewed the predictive accuracy of extended 14-core prostate biopsies, in terms of GS and tumor location in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) treated by RP.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 163 patients who underwent RP for clinically localized PCa. Preoperatively, all patients underwent a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate (TRUSBP) with 14-core scheme for suspected PCa. According to GS, patients were categorized as low (GS 2-6), moderate (GS 7), and high (GS 8-10). A comparison between GS and tumor laterality of the needle biopsy and RP specimens was carried out.  Results:   Bioptic GS was low (≤ 6) in 55.9%, moderate (7) in 34.9%, and high (≥8) in 9.2% of the patients. Pathological GS was 40.5, 46.6, and 12.9%, respectively. Of the 66 patients with low GS by RP, 41 (62.1%) were in agreement with TRUSBP, whereas 25 (37.9%) were underestimated by TRUSBP. Of the 76 patients with moderate GS by RP, 47 were in agreement with TRUSBP (61.8%), and 4 were underestimated by TRUSBP (5.3%). In the assessment of tumor laterality, TRUSBP falsely showed 51 cases as unilateral tumors, whereas RP diagnosed that both sides had PCa (p<0.001).  Conclusion:   These data are in line with those of the literature, although the group of low-risk tumors remained the same only in 40.5% of the cases.

However, the risk conferred in men living in China is unkown. We selected 6 previously identified variants as candidates to define their association with PCa in Chinese men.  Methods:   We genotyped 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1465618, rs1983891, rs339331, rs16901966, rs1447295 and rs10090154) using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis and assessed their association with PCa risk in a case-control study of 481 patients and 480 controls in a Chinese population. In addition, the individual and cumulative contribution for the risk of PCa and clinical covariates were analysed.  Results:   We found that 5 of the 6 genetic variants were associated with PCa risk. The T allele of rs339331 and the G allele of rs16901966 showed a significant association with PCa susceptibility: OR (95%CI)= 0.78 (0.64-0.94), p<0.009 and OR (95%CI)= 0.66 (0.54-0.81), p<0.0001, as well as A allele of rs1447295 (OR [95%CI]=1.46 (1.17-1.84), p<0.001) and T allele of rs10090154 (OR [95%CI]= 0.58 (0.46-0.74), p<0.0001). rs339331(T) was associated with a 0.71-fold and 1.42-fold increase of PCa risk by dominant model (p=0.007) and recessive model (p=0.007). rs16901966 (G) was associated with a 0.51-fold and 1.98-fold increase of PCa risk by dominant model (p=0.006) and recessive model (p=0.0058). rs10090154 (T) was associated with a 1.89-fold and 0.53-fold increase of PCa risk by dominant model (p=0.000006) and recessive model (p=0.000006). And, rs1983891(C) was associated with a 0.77-fold increase of PCa risk by recessive model (p=0.045). rs1447295 was associated with a 1.57-fold increase of PCa risk by dominant model (p=0.008). rs1465618 showed no significant association with PCa. The cumulative effects test of risk alleles (rs rs1983891, rs339331, rs16901966, rs1447295 and rs10090154) showed an increasing risk to PCa in a frequency-dependent manner (ptrend=0.001), and men with more than 3 risk alleles had the most significant susceptibility to PCa (OR=1.99, p=0.001), compared with those who had one risk allele (OR=1.17, p=0.486).

To improve the prognosis for HCC patients, there is an urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms of metastasis in HCC. Since protein Serine/Threonine phosphorylation emerges to be an important posttranslational modification critical in signaling process associated with cell proliferation, survival and metastasis, we employed a pair of primary tumor-derived and corresponding lung-metastatic counterparts (PLC/PRF/5-PT and PLC/PRF/5-LM) and aimed to identify these changes using CelluSpot Serine/Threonine kinase peptide array. Upon analysis, we found phosphorylated level of nucleophosmin (NPM) at Threonine 234/237 (p-NPM-Thr234/237) had remarkably high level in metastatic HCC cells (PLC-LM) than the corresponding primary HCC cell line (PLC-PT). Similar observation was observed in another match primary and their metastatic counterparts (MHCC-97L and MHCC-97H). By immunohistochemical staining, p-NPM-Thr234/237 was consistently found to be preferentially expressed in metastatic HCCs when compared with primary HCC in 28 HCC cases (p < 0.0001). By overexpressing Flag-tagged NPM and its phosphorylation site mutant (Thr234/237A) into low p-NPM-Thr234/237 expressing cells (Hep3B and Huh7) using a lentiviral based approach, we demonstrated that p-NPM-Thr234/237 is critical in invasion and migration of HCC cells, and this effect was mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Wild-type NPM was found to physically interact with a metastatic gene, ROCK2, and defective in Thr234/237 phosphorylation decreased its binding affinity, resulting in decrease in ROCK2 mediated signaling pathway.

We identified a total of nine publications, including 5952 cases and 5078 controls, to investigate the effect of COX2 -765G>C on PC risk, and found no significant association in any genetic model tested (CC vs GG: OR = 0.993, 95%CI = 0.923-1.068; GC+CC vs GG: OR = 1.041, 95%CI = 0.931-1.103; CC vs GC+GG: OR = 0.858, 95%CI = 0.689-1.067; CC vs GG: OR = 0.871, 95%CI = 0.689-1.086; GC vs GG: OR = 1.032, 95%CI = 0.945-1.127). Power analysis and tests for publication bias ensured the reliability of our results. This meta-analysis suggested that the functional COX2 -765G>C polymorphism, located in the COX2 gene promoter, is unlikely to be associated with PC risk. However, additional larger, well-designed studies are still required to reach a conclusive result on this issue.""","""['Y-Q Feng', 'Y U Li', 'W-D Xiao', 'G-X Wang', 'Y O Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Genet Mol Res""","""['Roles of Cyclooxygenase-2 gene -765G\u202f>\u202fC (rs20417) and -1195G\u202f>\u202fA (rs689466) polymorphisms in gastric cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Cyclooxygenase-2 -765G>C polymorphism and susceptibility to colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'PTGS2 gene polymorphism -765G>C is associated with coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis.', ""Cyclooxygenase-2 gene polymorphisms and risk of Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis."", 'Association between MMP2-1306 C/T polymorphism and prostate cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis based on 3906 subjects.']"""

Viremia may contribute directly or indirectly to cancer development and may have a differential impact on various cancer types. Our objective was to characterize patterns of HIV viremia in a retrospective, urban, clinical cohort (N = 320) of patients diagnosed with NADCs.  Findings:   The most common NADC's were lung (n = 60), prostate (n = 47), oropharyngeal (n = 32), liver (n = 29), and anal cancer (n = 20) and Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 18). In the year before cancer diagnosis, 66 % of all patients were virally suppressed. Patients with oropharyngeal (70 %) and prostate cancer (78 %) had a higher proportion of visits with suppressed viral loads. Patients diagnosed with anal cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma were infrequently virally suppressed and more frequently had viral loads ≥5 log10 copies/ml in the ten years prior to cancer diagnosis.  Conclusions:   In this cohort of HIV-infected patients diagnosed with NADCs, there were important differences in the patterns and levels of viremia between the different NADCs in the ten years prior to cancer diagnosis.

Previous research suggests that LSD1 is closely related with cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration and invasion in PCa. However, it remains to be elucidated whether LSD1 is correlated with androgen-independent (AI) transition of PCa under androgen-ablated conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the correlation of LSD1 expression with AI transition of human androgen-dependent PCa LNCaP cells. Our data showed that LSD1 was overexpressed in human PCa specimens and in AI PCa LNCaP-AI cells, which were established through a three-month continuous culture of LNCaP cells in androgen-deprived medium. Under androgen-deprived conditions, LNCaP-AI cells grew perfectly with less apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of LSD1 protected the LNCaP cells from androgen deprivation-induced apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest, while knockdown of LSD1 drove LNCaP-AI cells into a higher rate of apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest. Furthermore, LSD1 was found to regulate the androgen receptor (AR) and p53 signaling pathways via demethylation, subsequently influencing apoptosis and cell cycle progression. These findings revealed that overexpression of LSD1 promoted AI transition of PCa LNCaP cells under androgen-ablated conditions via activation of the AR signaling pathway and suppression of the p53 signaling pathway.""","""['Xuechao Li', 'Tao Li', 'Dehong Chen', 'Peng Zhang', 'Yarong Song', 'Hongxue Zhu', 'Yajun Xiao', 'Yifei Xing']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Inhibition of LSD1 by Pargyline inhibited process of EMT and delayed progression of prostate cancer in\xa0vivo.', 'Androgen-independent LNCaP cells are a subline of LNCaP cells with a more aggressive phenotype and androgen suppresses their growth by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1\xa0phase.', 'Activation of p53 signaling and inhibition of androgen receptor mediate tanshinone IIA induced G1 arrest in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Epigenetic regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition by the Lysine-specific demethylase LSD1/KDM1A.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'Mechanisms of carcinogenic activity triggered by lysine-specific demethylase 1A.', 'ACK1-AR and AR-HOXB13 signaling axes: epigenetic regulation of lethal prostate cancers.', 'LSD1: a viable therapeutic target in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma?', 'Oleanolic acid inhibits cell survival and proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo through the PI3K/Akt pathway.']"""

Descriptive statistics was used to analyze outcomes. Docking time was shorter for the SD group [SD: median 13 min (range 10-18); TD: median 21 min (range 15-34)]. None in the SD group and six of 60 patients (10%) in the TD group suffered from temporary (<30 days) unilateral neurological deficits of the lower limbs. In both groups no collisions between the robotic arms occurred. The SD approach is technically feasible.

Materials and methods:   Forty-one patients with unilateral prostate cancer were treated with FC. Patients were stratified using the 2007 Task Force Focal Prostate Cancer Patient selection criteria (Task Force criteria). Posttherapy follow-up included questionnaires, PSA measurement, and TRUS-guided biopsies.  Results:   Complete follow-up was available in 40 patients (median follow-up 63 months; range 12-92 months).

We found that 3-BP rapidly induced cultured androgen-insensitive (PC-3) and androgen-responsive (LNCaP) prostate cancer cell death at low concentrations (IC(50) values of 50 and 70 μM, respectively) with a multimodal mechanism of action. In particular, 3-BP-treated PC-3 cells showed a selective, strong reduction of glyceraldeide 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, due to the direct interaction of the drug with the enzyme. Moreover, 3-BP strongly impaired both glutamate/malate- and succinate-dependent mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential generation and ATP synthesis, concomitant with the inhibition of respiratory chain complex I, II and ATP synthase activities. The drastic reduction of cellular ATP levels and depletion of GSH pool, associated with significant increase in cell oxidative stress, were found after 3-BP treatment of PC-3 cells. Interestingly, the activity of both glyoxalase I and II, devoted to the elimination of the cytotoxic methylglyoxal, was strongly inhibited by 3-BP. Both N-acetylcysteine and aminoguanidine, GSH precursor and methylglyoxal scavenger, respectively, prevented 3-BP-induced PC-3 cell death, showing that impaired cell antioxidant and detoxifying capacities are crucial events leading to cell death. The provided information on the multi-target cytotoxic action of 3-BP, finally leading to PC-3 cell necrosis, might be useful for future development of 3-BP as a therapeutic option for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Daniela Valenti', 'Rosa A Vacca', 'Lidia de Bari']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Bioenerg Biomembr""","""['Screening the yeast genome for energetic metabolism pathways involved in a phenotypic response to the anti-cancer agent 3-bromopyruvate.', 'Inhibition of energy-producing pathways of HepG2 cells by 3-bromopyruvate.', 'Regulation of death induction and chemosensitizing action of 3-bromopyruvate in myeloid leukemia cells: energy depletion, oxidative stress, and protein kinase activity modulation.', 'The HK2 Dependent ""Warburg Effect"" and Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation in Cancer: Targets for Effective Therapy with 3-Bromopyruvate.', '3-Bromopyruvate: targets and outcomes.', '3-Bromopyruvate overcomes cetuximab resistance in human colorectal cancer cells by inducing autophagy-dependent ferroptosis.', '3-Bromopyruvate Suppresses the Malignant Phenotype of Vemurafenib-Resistant Melanoma Cells.', '3-Bromopyruvate inhibits pancreatic tumor growth by stalling glycolysis, and dismantling mitochondria in a syngeneic mouse model.', 'Mitochondrial Respiratory Complexes as Targets of Drugs: The PPAR Agonist Example.', '3-Bromopyruvate-mediated MCT1-dependent metabolic perturbation sensitizes triple negative breast cancer cells to ionizing radiation.']"""

Here we demonstrate an important resistance mechanism initiated from tumor-induced bone. Studies using an osteogenic patient-derived xenograft, MDA-PCa-118b, revealed that tumor cells resistant to cabozantinib, a Met and VEGFR-2 inhibitor, reside in a ""resistance niche"" adjacent to prostate cancer-induced bone. We performed secretome analysis of the conditioned medium from tumor-induced bone to identify proteins (termed ""osteocrines"") found within this resistance niche. In accordance with previous reports demonstrating that activation of integrin signaling pathways confers therapeutic resistance, 27 of the 90 osteocrines identified were integrin ligands. We found that following cabozantinib treatment, only tumor cells positioned adjacent to the newly formed woven bone remained viable and expressed high levels of pFAK-Y397 and pTalin-S425, mediators of integrin signaling. Accordingly, treatment of C4-2B4 cells with integrin ligands resulted in increased pFAK-Y397 expression and cell survival, whereas targeting integrins with FAK inhibitors PF-562271 or defactinib inhibited FAK phosphorylation and reduced the survival of PC3-mm2 cells. Moreover, treatment of MDA-PCa-118b tumors with PF-562271 led to decreased tumor growth, irrespective of initial tumor size. Finally, we show that upon treatment cessation, the combination of PF-562271 and cabozantinib delayed tumor recurrence in contrast to cabozantinib treatment alone. Our studies suggest that identifying paracrine de novo resistance mechanisms may significantly contribute to the generation of a broader set of potent therapeutic tools that act combinatorially to inhibit metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Yu-Chen Lee', 'Song-Chang Lin', 'Guoyu Yu', 'Chien-Jui Cheng', 'Bin Liu', 'Hsuan-Chen Liu', 'David H Hawke', 'Nila U Parikh', 'Andreas Varkaris', 'Paul Corn', 'Christopher Logothetis', 'Robert L Satcher', 'Li-Yuan Yu-Lee', 'Gary E Gallick', 'Sue-Hwa Lin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Integrating Murine and Clinical Trials with Cabozantinib to Understand Roles of MET and VEGFR2 as Targets for Growth Inhibition of Prostate Cancer.', 'Hedgehog signaling inhibition by the small molecule smoothened inhibitor GDC-0449 in the bone forming prostate cancer xenograft MDA PCa 118b.', ""Cabozantinib Inhibits Abiraterone's Upregulation of IGFIR Phosphorylation and Enhances Its Anti-Prostate Cancer Activity."", 'Current role of cabozantinib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer cell survival pathways activated by bone metastasis microenvironment.', 'Endothelial-to-osteoblast transition in normal mouse bone development.', 'Alendronate conjugate for targeted delivery to bone-forming prostate cancer.', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor Activation Reduces Metastatic Prostate Cancer Bone Lesions by Blocking the Endothelial-to-Osteoblast Transition.', 'Advancing Treatment of Bone Metastases through Novel Translational Approaches Targeting the Bone Microenvironment.', 'Prostate tumor-induced stromal reprogramming generates Tenascin C that promotes prostate cancer metastasis through YAP/TAZ inhibition.']"""

Our aim is to calculate the prevalence of urinary incontinence, characteristics of leakage and influential factors, through a historical series.  Methods:   We perform a descriptive, observational and retrospective study of 1310 patients who received treatment for PCa between 1989 and 2011. Prevalence was obtained after 12 months of recovery and using ICS definition. To complete ICIQ-SF and number of pads/day used we perform a cross-sectional study. The series is studied globally and divided in two groups according to oncologic characteristics. We perform a descriptive, comparative and predictive analysis.  Results:   Prevalence of the series was 23.5%, 296 patients. 279 incontinent patients completed ICIQ-SF with a mean score of 11.1±4.03. 16.4% of the patients use 1 pad/day or none, 69% (11.4% of the total) use compress and 22% diapers. 8% of the total use more than 1 pad/day. Clinico-pathological factors divide series in two groups: 1989-1999 with a prevalence of 24.6% and 2000-2011 with 22.8%. Multivariate analysis shows influential factors: age (65 years) (OR:1.65, p=0.013) and prostate volume (50cc) (OR:1.49, p=0.029).  Conclusions:   Urinary incontinence is a disease with some prevalence that varies depending on definition. The most common situation was to leak several times a day (42.2%), a small amount (59.1%), using compress (69%) most of incontinents with a mild (0-7: 88.2%) impact on quality of life.

Methods and materials:   We studied 3618 patients with cT1-T3aN0M0 high-risk or unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate adenocarcinoma treated with radiation at a single institution between 1997 and 2013. Favorable high-risk was defined as T1c disease with either Gleason 4 + 4 = 8 and prostate-specific antigen <10 ng/mL or Gleason 6 and prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL. Competing risks regression was used to determine differences in the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) after controlling for baseline factors and treatment. Our results were validated in a cohort of 13,275 patients using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database.  Results:   Patients with favorable high-risk disease had significantly better PCSM than other men with high-risk disease (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18-0.996, P=.049) and similar PCSM as men with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease (AHR 1.17, 95% CI 0.50-2.75, P=.710). We observed very similar results within the SEER-Medicare cohort (favorable high-risk vs other high-risk: AHR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11-0.41, P<.001; favorable high-risk vs unfavorable intermediate-risk: AHR 0.67, 95% CI 0.33-1.36, P=.268).  Conclusions:   Patients with favorable high-risk prostate cancer have significantly better PCSM than other patients with high-risk disease and similar PCSM as those with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease, who are typically treated with shorter-course androgen deprivation therapy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate an optimized gold immunochromatographic strip device for the detection of PSA, in which the results can be analysed using a Chromogenic Rapid Test Reader to quantitatively assess the test results.  Methods:   This reader measures the reflectance of the signal line via a charge-coupled device camera. For quantitative analysis, PSA concentration was computed via a calibration equation. Capillary blood samples from 305 men were evaluated, and two independent observers interpreted the test results after 12 min. Blood samples were also collected and tested with a conventional quantitative assay.  Results:   Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of the PSA rapid quantitative test system were 100, 96.6, 89.5, 100, and 97.4 %, respectively.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been confirmed to play a critical regulatory role in various biological processes including carcinogenesis, which indicates that lncRNAs are valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The novel lncRNA prostate cancer non-coding RNA 1 (PRNCR1) is located in the susceptible genomic area of CRC, however the functional role of PRNCR1 remains unknown. Thus, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance and biological function of PRNCR1 in CRC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to assess the expression profile of PRNCR1 in CRC tissues and cell lines. An antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was designed to knock down PRNCR1. In a cohort of 63 patients, PRNCR1 was significantly overexpressed in CRC tissues compared with the expression in adjacent tissues, with an average fold increase of 10.55 (P=0.006). Additionally, a high level of PRNCR1 was associated with large tumor volume (P<0.05). Based on receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), we found that the area under the curve (AUC) of PRNCR1 was 0.799 while the AUC of conventional biomarker CEA-CA199 was 0.651, indicating that PRNCR1 could be a sensitive diagnostic biomarker of CRC. Compared with the normal human colorectal epithelial cell line (FHC), PRNCR1 was upregulated in most CRC cell lines (HCT116, SW480, LoVo and HT-29). After knockdown of PRNCR1 by ASO, CRC cell proliferation ability was significantly inhibited. We further found that PRNCR1 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and a significant decrease in the proportion of cells in the S phases. In contrast, PRNCR1 knockdown did not affect cell apoptosis or invasive ability. Hence, these data indicate that PRNCR1 promotes the proliferation of CRC cells and is a potential oncogene of CRC.""","""['Liu Yang', 'Mantang Qiu', 'Youtao Xu', 'Jie Wang', 'Yanyan Zheng', 'Ming Li', 'Lin Xu', 'Rong Yin']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Long noncoding RNA HNF1A-AS1 indicates a poor prognosis of colorectal cancer and promotes carcinogenesis via activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Long non-coding RNA RUNX1-IT1 plays a tumour-suppressive role in colorectal cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation and migration.', 'Long non-coding RNA FOXP4-AS1 is an unfavourable prognostic factor and regulates proliferation and apoptosis in colorectal cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in colorectal cancer.', 'Targeting long non-coding RNAs in cancers: progress and prospects.', 'Long Non-Coding RNA: A Potential Strategy for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.', 'PRNCR1: a long non-coding RNA with a pivotal oncogenic role in cancer.', 'Non-coding RNAs and potential therapeutic targeting in cancer.', 'Target Enrichment Enables the Discovery of lncRNAs with Somatic Mutations or Altered Expression in Paraffin-Embedded Colorectal Cancer Samples.', 'Long non‑coding RNA PRNCR1 exerts oncogenic effects in\xa0tongue squamous cell carcinoma in\xa0vitro and in\xa0vivo by sponging microRNA‑944 and thereby increasing HOXB5\xa0expression.']"""

Methods:   Isolation of juglone, a napthoquinone, from the chloroform extract of the root part of Juglans regia was executed by flash chromatography using silica gel as stationary phase. The isolated Juglone was used as starting material for the further synthesis of a novel series of triazolyl analogs using click chemistry approach to investigate their cytotoxic potential against different human cancer cell lines using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-yl)-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay.  Results:   The different extracts of Juglans regia and the isolated compound (juglone) exhibited satisfactory cytotoxic activity against a panel of eight different human cancer cell lines namely, prostate colon (Colo-205 and HCT-116), breast (T47D), prostate (PC-3 and DU-145), skin (A-431) and lung (NCI-H322 and A549). Interestingly, all the synthesised analogs displayed enhanced and selective cytotoxic activity against lung cancer cell lines only. Of the synthesized derivatives, 15a and 16a displayed the best activity with IC50 of 4.72 and 4.67 μM against A549 cells. Both these derivatives exhibited superior potency to BEZ-235 against both the lung cancer cell lines. So far as the structural aspects are concerned, electron withdrawing substituents at the ortho position of R moiety of the triazolyl analogs seem to be essential for attaining better activity.

We also examined whether the circulating exosomes from PCa patients are transported to mt and carry mtDNA or mt proteins. We have employed next generation sequencing of the whole mt genome in human and Hi-myc PCa. The impact of mtDNA depletion on mt integrity, presence of mtDNA, and protein in sera exosomes was determined. A co-culture of human PCa cells and the circulating exosomes followed by confocal imaging determined co-localization of exosomes and mt. We observed frequent RCI mutations in human and Hi-myc PCa which disrupted corresponding complex protein expression. Depletion of mtDNA in PCa cells influenced mt integrity, increased expression of MFN1, MFN2, PINK1, and decreased expression of MT-TFA. Increased mt fusion and expression of PINK1 and DNM1L were also evident in the Hi-myc tumors.

The concept that 'men with prostate cancer die with rather than of their cancer' has been shown to be false. It is estimated that 10-20% of men in the UK present with locally advanced disease. Median overall survival remains only 3.5 years for men presenting with metastatic disease. The use of LHRH analogues to achieve medical castration has become the gold standard for both locally advanced prostate cancer, combined with radiotherapy, and metastatic disease. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard first-line treatment for advanced disease resulting in improvements in symptoms, radiological findings and PSA levels. Ultimately the majority of men with advanced prostate cancer will develop resistance to ADT Docetaxel is the standard first-line therapy recommended by international guidelines for patients with symptomatic metastatic castrate refractory prostate cancer who are suitable candidates for chemotherapy. More than 90% of patients with castrate refractory prostate cancer have bone metastases.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of kindlin-2, an integrin-binding focal adhesion protein, in the regulation of invasiveness of prostate cancer. We found that downregulation of kindlin-2 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology significantly inhibited the invasion of PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells in a Matrigel Transwell assay. Conversely, overexpression of kindlin-2 promoted the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. Kindlin-2 overexpression was found to activate nuclear factor (NF)-κB-dependent signaling and upregulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2, whereas kindlin-2 silencing led to opposing effects on the expression of NF-κB and MMPs. Most importantly, kindlin-2-induced invasiveness was almost completely abolished by pretreatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling) or co-transfection with MMP-9 or MMP-2 siRNA. Taken together, our data indicate that kindlin-2 promotes the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells largely through NF-κB-dependent upregulation of MMP-9 and MMP-2.

We sought to define whether a hypermethylation profile of patients with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation would predict castrate resistant prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed using a methylation cancer panel in 10 normal prostates and 45 tumor samples from patients placed on androgen deprivation who were followed until castrate resistant disease developed. Castrate resistant disease was defined according to EAU (European Association of Urology) guideline criteria. Two pathologists reviewed the Gleason score, Ki-67 index and neuroendocrine differentiation. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed and relationships with outcome were investigated by Cox regression and log rank analysis.  Results:   We found 61 genes that were significantly hypermethylated in greater than 20% of tumors analyzed. Three clusters of patients were characterized by a DNA methylation profile, including 1 at risk for earlier castrate resistant disease (log rank p = 0.019) and specific mortality (log rank p = 0.002). Hypermethylation of ETV1 (HR 3.75) and ZNF215 (HR 2.89) predicted disease progression despite androgen deprivation. Hypermethylation of IRAK3 (HR 13.72), ZNF215 (HR 4.81) and SEPT9 (HR 7.64) were independent markers of prognosis. Prostate specific antigen greater than 25 ng/ml, Gleason pattern 5, Ki-67 index greater than 12% and metastasis at diagnosis also predicted a negative response to androgen deprivation. Study limitations included the retrospective design and limited number of cases.  Conclusions:   Epigenetic silencing of the mentioned genes could be novel molecular markers for the prognosis of advanced prostate cancer. It might predict castrate resistance during hormone deprivation and, thus, disease specific mortality. Gene hypermethylation is associated with disease progression in patients who receive hormone therapy.

Immunohistochemistry was employed to analyze PBOV1 expression in 17 normal ovaries, 13 cystadenoma tissues, 14 borderline tumor tissues, and 165 clinicopathologically characterized ovarian cancers. There was negative PBOV1 expression in the 17 normal ovarian epithelial tissues. Compared to the normal ovarian epithelial cells, PBOV1 mRNA and protein were overexpressed in ovarian cancer cell lines. There was high PBOV1 protein expression in the ovarian cancer tissues from 59 of the 165 (35.8%) patients; PBOV1 expression was weak in 106 (64.2%) patients. Notably, there were significant negative associations between high PBOV1 expression and ascending histological grade, late pT/pN/pM, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (P<0.05). Patients with high PBOV1 expression had longer overall survival; patients with low PBOV1 expression had shorter survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that PBOV1 upregulation is an independent prognostic indicator for ovarian cancer and might serve as a tumor-suppressor gene. Furthermore, PBOV1 overexpression inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in a tumor transplantation nude mouse model.

In this study, we report a previously unknown role for the cytoplasmic promyelocytic leukaemia (cPML) tumour suppressor in TGF-β signalling-induced regulation of prostate cancer-associated EMT and invasion. We demonstrate that cPML promotes a mesenchymal phenotype and increases the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. This event is associated with activation of TGF-β canonical signalling pathway through the induction of Sma and Mad related family 2 and 3 (SMAD2 and SMAD3) phosphorylation. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic localization of promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) is mediated by its nuclear export in a chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent manner. This was clinically tested in prostate cancer tissue and shown that cytoplasmic PML and CRM1 co-expression correlates with reduced disease-specific survival. In summary, we provide evidence of dysfunctional TGF-β signalling occurring at an early stage in prostate cancer.

To date, the role of whole pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT) has not been clarified especially taking into consideration the benefits of high conformal IMRT (intensity modulated radiotherapy) of complex-shaped target volumes.  Methods:   From 2009 to 2012, 40 patients of high-risk prostate cancer with an increased risk of microscopic lymph node involvement were enrolled into this prospective phase II trial. Patients received at least two months of antihormonal treatment (AT) before radiotherapy continuing for at least 2 years. Helical IMRT (tomotherapy) of the pelvic lymph nodes (51.0 Gy) with a simultaneous integrated, moderate hypofractionated boost (single dose of 2.25 Gy) to the prostate (76.5 Gy) was performed in 34 fractions. PSA levels, prostate-related symptoms and quality of life were assessed at regular intervals for 24 months.  Results:   Of the 40 patients enrolled, 38 finished the treatment as planned. Overall acute toxicity rates were low and no acute grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity occurred. 21.6% of patients experienced acute grade 2 but no late grade ≥ 2 GI toxicity. Regarding GU side effects, results showed 48.6% acute grade 2 and 6.4% late grade 2 toxicity. After a median observation time of 23.4 months the PLATIN 1 trial can be considered as sufficiently safe meeting the prospectively defined aims of the trial. With 34/37 patients free of a PSA recurrence it shows promising efficacy.  Conclusion:   Tomotherapy of the pelvic lymph nodes with a simultaneous integrated boost to the prostate can be performed safely and without excessive toxicity. The combined irradiation of both prostate and pelvic lymph nodes seems to be as well tolerated as the irradiation of the prostate alone.

To evaluate the association between the methylation status in the promoter of estrogen receptor (ER) β,possibly a tumor suppressor gene specific for prostate cancer, and the risk in prostate cancer in a Chinese population, a case-control study that included 56 sporadic prostate cancer cases and 60 healthy controls was conducted. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of all the subjects for analyzing the methylation status of the ERβ promoter by methylation-specific PCR, which was verified by bisulfite genomic sequencing PCR. A significant difference was observed in the methylation frequencies of the ERβ promoter between cancer patients (12/56, 21.4%) and healthy controls (5/60, 8.3%). Prostate cancer (PC-3 and DU-145) and prostatic epithelial (RWPE-1) cell lines were treated with various concentrations of the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-dC. Expression of ERβ was detected at both transcriptional and translational levels. As a result, both mRNA and protein of ERβ were elevated following treatment with increasing concentrations of the demethylating agent.

Methods and materials:   A propensity score analysis of 817 patients who underwent radical radiation therapy with neoadjuvant or adjuvant hormone therapy as primary line management in a cohort study during 2009 to 2013 was conducted. Patients were stratified as follows: group 1, hypertensive patients taking ACEIs (as a study group); group 2, nonhypertensive patients not taking ACEIs; and group 3, hypertensive patients not taking ACEIs (both as control groups). The incidence, severity, and duration of proctitis were the main outcome. χ(2) tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, analysis of variance, risk ratio (RR), confidence interval (CI), Kaplan-Meier plots, and log-rank tests were used.  Results:   The mean age of the participants was 68.91 years, with a follow-up time of 3.38 years. Based on disease and age-matched comparison, there was a statistically significant difference of proctitis grading between the 3 groups: χ(2) (8, n=308) = 72.52, P<.001. The Mann-Whitney U test indicated that grades of proctitis were significantly lower in hypertensive patients taking ACEIs than in nonhypertensive patients not taking ACEIs and hypertensive patients not taking ACEIs (P<.001). The risk ratio (RR) of proctitis in hypertensive patients taking ACEIs was significantly lower than in hypertensive patients not taking ACEIs (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30-0.53, P<.001) and in nonhypertensive patients not taking ACEIs (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.77, P<.001). Time to event analysis revealed that hypertensive patients taking ACEIs were significantly different from the control groups (P<.0001). Furthermore, hypertensive patients taking ACEIs had significantly faster resolution of proctitis (P<.0001).  Conclusion:   Patients who were taking ACEIs were significantly less likely to have high-grade proctitis after radical radiation therapy with neoadjuvant or adjuvant hormone therapy (P<.001).

Our previous studies showed that oligonucleotide-treated LNCaP prostate cancer cells compensate for diminished expression of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), an apoptosis inhibitor, by suppressing the expression of caspase-3 (an apoptosis promoter) while enhancing that of serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT1) (another apoptosis inhibitor). In addition, we found an enhanced expression of the androgen receptor (AR), its p300 and interleukin-6 (IL6) co-activators, polymerase transcription mediator (MED12), and growth-regulating signal transducer (STAT3). The net result was an altered pattern of gene expression often associated with more aggressive and proliferative tumors. To further evaluate adaptive compensatory mechanisms related to tumor resistance, aggression and proliferation, herein we evaluated the level of expression of a proliferation antigen (KI-67) and mitosis-regulating cyclins (B1 and D1). Compared to the relative levels of compensation detailed above, we found the expression of KI-67 to be statistically the most enhanced non-targeted protein yet identified in compensation for suppression of BCL2. Expression of cyclin D1 was also significantly enhanced, although to a much lesser extent. As a result, we propose that oligonucleotide-mediated treatment could be more effective when directed towards KI-67 and BCL2.

Immunohistochemistry was used to examine expression of Rce1 protein in 74 PCa tissues and 30 BPH tissues. The association between Rce1 expression and the specific clinicopathologic features was evaluated by χ(2) tests. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the data. We found that expression of Rce1 mRNA and protein was markedly higher in PCa tissues than in paired BPH tissues. Expression of Rce1 in PCa was strongly associated with clinicopathologic features. It was detected in 69 (93.24%) of 74 PCa tissues by immunohistochemistry, and it was found to be associated with Gleason score (P = .013), T class (P = .015), and distant metastasis (P = .044). Patients with PCa having higher Rce1 expression had substantially shorter survival times than patients with lower Rce1 expression.

This paper presents an algorithm for the prostate gland volume estimation based on the semi-automated segmentation of individual slices in T2-weighted MR image sequences. The proposed sequential registration-based segmentation (SRS) algorithm, which was inspired by the clinical workflow during medical image contouring, relies on inter-slice image registration and user interaction/correction to segment the prostate gland without the use of an anatomical atlas. It automatically generates contours for each slice using a registration algorithm, provided that the user edits and approves the marking in some previous slices. We conducted comprehensive experiments to measure the performance of the proposed algorithm using three registration methods (i.e., rigid, affine, and nonrigid). Five radiation oncologists participated in the study where they contoured the prostate MR (T2-weighted) images of 15 patients both manually and using the SRS algorithm. Compared to the manual segmentation, on average, the SRS algorithm reduced the contouring time by 62% (a speedup factor of 2.64×) while maintaining the segmentation accuracy at the same level as the intra-user agreement level (i.e., Dice similarity coefficient of 91 versus 90%). The proposed algorithm exploits the inter-slice similarity of volumetric MR image series to achieve highly accurate results while significantly reducing the contouring time.""","""['Farzad Khalvati', 'Aryan Salmanpour', 'Shahryar Rahnamayan', 'Masoom A Haider', 'H R Tizhoosh']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Digit Imaging""","""['Inter-slice bidirectional registration-based segmentation of the prostate gland in MR and CT image sequences.', 'Spatially varying accuracy and reproducibility of prostate segmentation in magnetic resonance images using manual and semiautomated methods.', 'Elastic registration of prostate MR images based on estimation of deformation states.', 'A review of segmentation and deformable registration methods applied to adaptive cervical cancer radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Automated methods for hippocampus segmentation: the evolution and a review of the state of the art.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate MRI using convolutional neural networks: Investigating the impact of network architecture on the accuracy of volume measurement and MRI-ultrasound registration.', 'An automated A-value measurement tool for accurate cochlear duct length estimation.', 'Fully automated segmentation of prostate whole gland and transition zone in diffusion-weighted MRI using convolutional neural networks.', 'Segmentation of the prostate on magnetic resonance images using an ellipsoidal shape prior constraint algorithm.']"""

The Discovery of new agents for the treatment of prostate cancer is urgently needed. Compound WZ35, a novel analog of the natural product curcumin, exhibited good anti-prostate cancer activity, with an IC50 of 2.2 μM in PC-3 cells. However, the underlying mechanism of WZ35 against prostate cancer cells is still unclear.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer PC-3 cells and DU145 cells were treated with WZ35 for further proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and mechanism analyses. NAC and CHOP siRNA were used to validate the role of ROS and ER stress, respectively, in the anti-cancer actions of WZ35.  Results:   Our results show that WZ35 exhibited much higher cell growth inhibition than curcumin by inducing ER stress-dependent cell apoptosis in human prostate cells. The reduction of CHOP expression by siRNA partially abrogated WZ35-induced cell apoptosis. WZ35 also dose-dependently induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Furthermore, we found that WZ35 treatment for 30 min significantly induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in PC-3 cells. Co-treatment with the ROS scavenger NAC completely abrogated the induction of WZ35 on cell apoptosis, ER stress activation, and cell cycle arrest, indicating an upstream role of ROS generation in mediating the anti-cancer effect of WZ35.  Conclusions:   Taken together, this work presents the novel anticancer candidate WZ35 for the treatment of prostate cancer, and importantly, reveals that increased ROS generation might be an effective strategy in human prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Xiuhua Zhang', 'Minxiao Chen', 'Peng Zou', 'Karvannan Kanchana', 'Qiaoyou Weng', 'Wenbo Chen', 'Peng Zhong', 'Jiansong Ji', 'Huiping Zhou', 'Langchong He', 'Guang Liang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Increased Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species Mediates the Anti-Cancer Effects of WZ35 via Activating Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'ROS generation mediates the anti-cancer effects of WZ35 via activating JNK and ER stress apoptotic pathways in gastric cancer.', 'Curcumin enhances the effects of irinotecan on colorectal cancer cells through the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway.', 'Anticancer drugs for the modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress.', 'Role of oxidative stress response elements and antioxidants in prostate cancer pathobiology and chemoprevention--a mechanistic approach.', 'Cancer Metabolism: The Role of ROS in DNA Damage and Induction of Apoptosis in Cancer Cells.', 'Monocarbonyl Curcumin Analogues as Potent Inhibitors against Human Glutathione Transferase P1-1.', 'The Impact of Oxidative Stress and AKT Pathway on Cancer Cell Functions and Its Application to Natural Products.', 'ROS-generating, pH-responsive and highly tunable reduced graphene oxide-embedded microbeads showing intrinsic anticancer properties and multi-drug co-delivery capacity for combination cancer therapy.', 'Diarylpentanoid (1,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,4-pentadiene-3-one) (MS13) Exhibits Anti-proliferative, Apoptosis Induction and Anti-migration Properties on Androgen-independent Human Prostate Cancer by Targeting Cell Cycle-Apoptosis and PI3K Signalling Pathways.']"""

We report the prognostic factors and outcomes in patients receiving salvage treatment for LN recurrence after high-dose intensity-modulated RT (IMRT).  Methods:   We studied a cohort of 419 patients with localized prostate adenocarcinoma undergoing definitive IMRT (78 Gy). LN recurrence was diagnosed by size criteria using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging, or abnormal uptake of (18)F-fluorocholine by LNs on positron emission tomography/CT. Overall survival and LN recurrence-free survival (LNRFS) were calculated, and prognostic factors were evaluated.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 60 months, 18 patients (4.3 %) had LN recurrence and a significantly lower 5-year overall survival rate (60 vs. 90 %, p = 0.003). Univariate analysis showed that T3/T4 stage (p = 0.003), Gleason score >7 (p < 0.001), and estimated risk of pelvic LN involvement of >30 % by the Roach formula (p = 0.029) were associated with significantly lower LNRFS. On multivariate analysis, high Gleason score (hazard ratio = 5.99, p = 0.007) was the only independent factor. The 1/2-year overall survivals after LN recurrence were 67/54 %. Patients with isolated LN recurrence (p = 0.003), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time >5 months (p = 0.009), interval between PSA nadir and biochemical failure >12 months (p = 0.035), and PSA <10 ng/ml at LN recurrence (p = 0.003) had significantly better survival. Patients with isolated LN recurrence had significantly better survival when treated with combined RT and hormones than when treated with hormones alone (p = 0.011).

Male gender, age, previous acute radiation enteritis, and chemotherapy were associated with chronic enteritis, but only chemotherapy remained independently related to bowel toxicity after multivariate analysis (OR = 3.59 [95% CI 1.20-10.73]).  Conclusion:   chronic enteritis is common among patients treated with pelvic radiotherapy, especially if chemotherapy is associated. The complication rate is low, but a significant number of patients change their usual diet in order to prevent symptoms.""","""['Ana Hernández-Moreno', 'Alfonso Vidal-Casariego', 'Alicia Calleja-Fernández', 'Georgios Kyriakos', 'Rocío Villar-Taibo', 'Ana Urioste-Fondo', 'Isidoro Cano-Rodríguez', 'María D Ballesteros-Pomar']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nutr Hosp""","""['The prevalence of chronic radiation enteritis following radiotherapy for cervical or endometrial cancer and its impact on quality of life.', 'Radiation enteritis: an overview.', 'Late gastrointestinal complications after pelvic radiotherapy: radiation enteritis.', 'Radiation injury of the small intestine.

In this study, we integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics to analyze 25 paired human prostate cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues, followed by further validation of our findings in an additional cohort of 51 prostate cancer patients and 16 benign prostatic hyperplasia patients. We found several altered pathways aberrantly expressed at both metabolic and transcriptional levels, including cysteine and methionine metabolism, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolism, and hexosamine biosynthesis. Additionally, the metabolite sphingosine demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity for distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia, particularly for patients with low prostate specific antigen level (0-10 ng/ml). We also found impaired sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 signaling, downstream of sphingosine, representing a loss of tumor suppressor gene and a potential key oncogenic pathway for therapeutic targeting.

The relation between diet and prostate cancer is still unclear. Because people do not consume individual foods but rather foods in combination, the assessment of dietary patterns may offer valuable information when determining associations between diet and prostate cancer risk.  Objective:   This study aimed to examine the association between dietary patterns (nonvegetarian, lacto-ovo-vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, vegan, and semi-vegetarian) and prostate cancer incidence among 26,346 male participants of the Adventist Health Study-2.  Design:   In this prospective cohort study, cancer cases were identified by matching to cancer registries. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to estimate HRs by using age as the time variable.  Results:   In total, 1079 incident prostate cancer cases were identified. Around 8% of the study population reported adherence to the vegan diet. Vegan diets showed a statistically significant protective association with prostate cancer risk (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.85). After stratifying by race, the statistically significant association with a vegan diet remained only for the whites (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.86), but the multivariate HR for black vegans showed a similar but nonsignificant point estimate (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.41, 1.18).

Here, we report a novel function of NRP2 as a regulator of endocytosis, which is enhanced in cancer cells and is often associated with increased metastatic potential and drug resistance. We found that NRP2 depletion in human prostate and pancreatic cancer cells resulted in the accumulation of EEA1/Rab5-positive early endosomes concomitant with a decrease in Rab7-positive late endosomes, suggesting a delay in early-to-late endosome maturation. NRP2 depletion also impaired the endocytic transport of cell surface EGFR, arresting functionally active EGFR in endocytic vesicles that consequently led to aberrant ERK activation and cell death. Mechanistic investigations revealed that WD-repeat- and FYVE-domain-containing protein 1 (WDFY1) functioned downstream of NRP2 to promote endosome maturation, thereby influencing the endosomal trafficking of EGFR and the formation of autolysosomes responsible for the degradation of internalized cargo. Overall, our results indicate that the NRP2/WDFY1 axis is required for maintaining endocytic activity in cancer cells, which supports their oncogenic activities and confers drug resistance.

We show that TOP2A promotes tumor aggressiveness by inducing chromosomal rearrangements of genes that contribute to a more invasive phenotype. Anti-androgen treatment alone was ineffective in killing TOP2A overexpressing cells due to activation of an androgen receptor network. TOP2A poisons killed tumor cells more efficiently early in the progression course, while at later stages they provided greater benefit when combined with anti-androgen therapy.

In breast cancer, MB expression is associated with a positive hormone receptor status and patient prognosis. In prostate cancer, another hormone-dependent cancer type, 53% of tumors were recently shown to express MB. Especially in more aggressive prostate cancer specimen MB expression also correlates with increased patient survival rates. Both findings might be due to tumor-suppressing properties of MB in cancer cells. In contrast to muscle, MB transcription in breast and prostate cancer mainly depends on a novel, alternative promoter site. We show here that its associated transcripts can be upregulated by hypoxia and downregulated by estrogens and androgens in MCF7 breast and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, respectively. Bioinformatic data mining of epigenetic histone marks and experimental verification reveal a hitherto uncharacterized transcriptional network that drives the regulation of the MB gene in cancer cells. We identified candidate hormone-receptor binding elements that may interact with the cancer-associated MB promoter to decrease its activity in breast and prostate cancer cells. Additionally, a regulatory element, 250 kb downstream of the promoter, acts as a hypoxia-inducible site within the transcriptional machinery. Understanding the distinct regulation of MB in tumors will improve unraveling the respiratory protein's function in the cancer context and may provide new starting points for developing therapeutic strategies.""","""['Anne Bicker', 'Alexandra M Brahmer', 'Sebastian Meller', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Thomas A Gorr', 'Thomas Hankeln']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Extensive transcriptional complexity during hypoxia-regulated expression of the myoglobin gene in cancer.', 'Endogenous myoglobin in breast cancer is hypoxia-inducible by alternative transcription and functions to impair mitochondrial activity: a role in tumor suppression?', 'Old proteins - new locations: myoglobin, haemoglobin, neuroglobin and cytoglobin in solid tumours and cancer cells.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in human breast and prostate cancer.', 'Myoglobin: From physiological roles to potential implications in cancer.', 'Transcriptomic Profile of Canine Mammary Ductal Carcinoma.', 'Pro-Apoptotic and Anti-Invasive Properties Underscore the Tumor-Suppressing Impact of Myoglobin on a Subset of Human Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Myoglobin regulates fatty acid trafficking and lipid metabolism in mammary epithelial cells.', 'Myoglobin expression by alternative transcript in different mesenchymal stem cells compartments.', 'Reprogramming of Fatty Acid Metabolism in Gynaecological Cancers: Is There a Role for Oestradiol?']"""

Materials and methods:   T2 -weighted and DW-MRI were acquired using a 7T MR scanner, 200 mm bore diameter; 10 TRAMP and 6 C57BL/6 control mice were scanned every 4 weeks from 8 weeks of age until sacrifice at 28-30 weeks. After sacrifice, the genitourinary tract was excised and sectioned for histological analysis. Histology slides registered with DW-MR images allowed for validation of DW-MR images and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as tools for cancer detection and disease stratification. An automated early assessment tool based on ADC threshold values was developed to aid cancer detection and progression monitoring.

Objective:   Delivery of external synthetic Smac peptide into the cytoplasm of malignant cells could greatly improve the efficiency of apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic agents.  Method:   In our study different conjugates based on the seven N-terminal amino acids AVPIAQK of Smac (SmacN7) were produced to obtain a cytoplasm-directed Smac variant. SmacN7 and a point mutant (AVPKAQK) were coupled either to rhodamine alone or to both rhodamine and undecylic aldehyde, which is an antagonist of the Lily-of-the-valley fragrance receptor. The fifth conjugate consisted of rhodamine coupled only to undecylic aldehyde, without SmacN7. The uptake of these five conjugates into three different human cell lines was characterized and quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. A caspase apoptosis assay was performed for cells incubated with the five different conjugates after induction of apoptosis.  Results:   The coupling of undecylic aldehyde to SmacN7 increased the cellular uptake of the correct and mutant conjugates.

Hedgehog pathway was evaluated and competitive 3H-estradiol ligand binding assay was performed. Additionally, antioxidant activity on Nrf2-ARE pathway was evaluated. Bonediol induced a growth inhibition on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 from 8.5 to 20.6 µM). Interestingly, bonediol binds to both estrogen receptors (ERα (2.5 µM) and ERβ (2.1 µM)) and displaces the native ligand E2 (17β-estradiol). No significant activity was found in the Hedgehog pathway. Additionally, activity of bonediol on Nrf2-ARE pathway suggested that bonediol could induce oxidative stress and activation of detoxification enzymes at 1 µM (3.8-fold).

For each sextant, receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-analysis and area under the curve were determined. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and visualized in ROC-curves.  Results:   HS tends to underestimate volume of cancerous lesions, particularly larger lesions >8 ml. Using a 0.2 ml detection threshold, specificity and sensitivity of HS were between 29-68% and 46-78%. For a 0.5 ml detection threshold, sextant-specific specificity increased to 59-92% and sensitivity decreased to 16-54%.

Wound healing assay showed that TA significantly inhibited (92.7%) migration of PCa cells (p<0.0001). In addition, TA was found to have anti-invasive potential on PC-3 cells and it inhibited (80.9%, p<0.0001) invasion of PC-3 cells into matrigel. Only 17.8% of PC-3 cells can form colony in the 0.7% agarose after treatment of cells with TA at the IC50 value concentration. Furthermore, flow cytometry analyses with Annexin V-APC and 7-AAD staining demonstrated that TA increases early apoptosis rate of PC-3 cells by 25.8% and LNCaP cells by 20.9%. Besides, Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses also demonstrated that TA regulates protein and mRNA expressions of CYP17A1, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, NQO1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 enzymes.

Recently, CTCs have been used to generate PDX experimental models of breast and prostate cancer. This manuscript details the method for the generation of prostate cancer PDX models from CTCs developed by our group. Advantages of this method over conventional PDX models include independence from surgical sample collection and generating experimental models at various disease stages. Density gradient centrifugation followed by red blood cell lysis and flow cytometry depletion of CD45 positive mononuclear cells is used to enrich CTCs from peripheral blood samples collected from patients with metastatic disease. The CTCs are then injected into immunocompromised mice; subsequently generated xenografts can be used for functional studies or harvested for molecular characterization. The primary limitation of this method is the negative selection method used for CTC enrichment. Despite this limitation, the generation of PDX models from CTCs provides a novel experimental model to be applied to prostate cancer research.""","""['Estrelania S Williams', 'Veronica Rodriguez-Bravo', 'Uma Chippada-Venkata', 'Janis De Ia Iglesia-Vicente', 'Yixuan Gong', 'Matthew Galsky', 'William Oh', 'Carlos Cordon-Cardo', 'Josep Domingo-Domenech']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Erratum: Generation of Prostate Cancer Patient Derived Xenograft Models from Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Circulating tumor cell investigation in breast cancer patient-derived xenograft models by automated immunofluorescence staining, image acquisition, and single cell retrieval and analysis.', 'Circulating and disseminated tumor cells from breast cancer patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice as a novel model to study metastasis.', 'Ex-vivo characterization of circulating colon cancer cells distinguished in stem and differentiated subset provides useful biomarker for personalized metastatic risk assessment.', 'Functional Studies on Viable Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Extracellular vesicles for personalized therapy decision support in advanced metastatic cancers and its potential impact for prostate cancer.', 'The functional and clinical roles of liquid biopsy in patient-derived models.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Despite major advances in targeted therapy in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas, the overall 5-year survival rate for lung cancer worldwide has not significantly changed for the last few decades. DNA repair deficiency is known to contribute to lung cancer development. In fact, human polymorphisms in DNA repair genes such as xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) are highly associated with lung cancer incidence. However, the direct genetic evidence for the role of XPC for lung cancer development is still lacking. Mutations of the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kras) or its downstream effector genes occur in almost all lung cancer cells, and there are a number of mouse models for lung cancer with these mutations. Using activated Kras, Kras(LA1), as a driver for lung cancer development in mice, we showed for the first time that mice with Kras(LA1) and Xpc knockout had worst outcomes in lung cancer development, and this phenotype was associated with accumulated DNA damage. Using cultured cells, we demonstrated that induced expression of oncogenic KRAS(G12V) led to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as DNA damage, and both can be suppressed by anti-oxidants.

Somatic copy number alterations (CNA) are found in most aggressive primary human prostate cancers, and the overall number of such changes is increased in metastases. Chromosome 10q23 deletions, encompassing PTEN, and amplification of 8q24, harboring MYC, are frequently observed, and the presence of both together portends a high risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality. In extant genetically engineered mouse prostate cancer models (GEMM), isolated MYC overexpression or targeted Pten loss can each produce early prostate adenocarcinomas, but are not sufficient to induce genetic instability or metastases with high penetrance. Although a previous study showed that combining Pten loss with focal MYC overexpression in a small fraction of prostatic epithelial cells exhibits cooperativity in GEMMs, additional targeted Tp53 disruption was required for formation of metastases. We hypothesized that driving combined MYC overexpression and Pten loss using recently characterized Hoxb13 transcriptional control elements that are active in prostate luminal epithelial cells would induce the development of genomic instability and aggressive disease with metastatic potential. Neoplastic lesions that developed with either MYC activation alone (Hoxb13-MYC) or Pten loss alone (Hoxb13-Cre∣Pten(Fl/Fl)) failed to progress beyond prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and did not harbor genomic CNAs. By contrast, mice with both alterations (Hoxb13-MYC∣Hoxb13-Cre∣Pten(Fl/Fl), hereafter, BMPC mice) developed lethal adenocarcinoma with distant metastases and widespread genome CNAs that were independent of forced disruption of Tp53 and telomere shortening. BMPC cancers lacked neuroendocrine or sarcomatoid differentiation, features uncommon in human disease but common in other models of prostate cancer that metastasize. These data show that combined MYC activation and Pten loss driven by the Hoxb13 regulatory locus synergize to induce genomic instability and aggressive prostate cancer that phenocopies the human disease at the histologic and genomic levels.""","""['Gretchen K Hubbard', 'Laura N Mutton', 'May Khalili', 'Ryan P McMullin', 'Jessica L Hicks', 'Daniella Bianchi-Frias', 'Lucas A Horn', 'Ibrahim Kulac', 'Michael S Moubarek', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Charles J Bieberich']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Loss of Nkx3.1 leads to the activation of discrete downstream target genes during prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Characterization of novel cell lines derived from a MYC-driven murine model of lethal metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'MYC overexpression induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and loss of Nkx3.1 in mouse luminal epithelial cells.', 'ER stress in prostate cancer: A therapeutically exploitable vulnerability?', 'Lineage plasticity in cancer: a shared pathway of therapeutic resistance.', 'PROTACs in the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'MYC-driven increases in mitochondrial DNA copy number occur early and persist throughout prostatic cancer progression.', ""Nuclear PTEN's Functions in Suppressing Tumorigenesis: Implications for Rare Cancers."", 'Identification of molecular subtypes and a prognostic signature based on chromatin regulators related genes in prostate cancer.', 'In Vivo Models for Prostate Cancer Research.']"""

Only one of five randomized controlled trials of PSA screening showed an effect on prostate cancer-specific mortality, and the absolute reduction in deaths from prostate cancer was one per 781 men screened after 13 years of follow-up.

Adverse effects of radical prostatectomy include perioperative complications, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. Radiation therapy can cause acute toxicity leading to urinary urgency, dysuria, diarrhea, and rectal pain; late toxicity includes erectile dysfunction, rectal bleeding, and urethral stricture.

In prostate cancer, resistance to ADT is frequently associated with the emergence of androgen-independent splice variants of the AR (AR variants, AR-Vs) that lack the LBD and are constitutively active. Women with breast cancer may be prone to a similar phenomenon. Herein, we show that in addition to the prototypical transcript, the AR gene produces a diverse range of AR-V transcripts in primary breast tumors. The most frequently and highly expressed variant was AR-V7 (exons 1/2/3/CE3), which was detectable at the mRNA level in > 50% of all breast cancers and at the protein level in a subset of ERα-negative tumors. Functionally, AR-V7 is a constitutively active and ADT-resistant transcription factor that promotes growth and regulates a transcriptional program distinct from AR in ERα-negative breast cancer cells. Importantly, we provide ex vivo evidence that AR-V7 is upregulated by the AR antagonist enzalutamide in primary breast tumors.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of insurance status on tumor characteristics and treatment selection in patients with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We identified 20,393 patients younger than 65 years with prostate cancer in the 2010-2011 SEER database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis tested the relationship between insurance status and 2 end points: (1) presenting with low-risk prostate cancer at diagnosis and (2) receiving local treatment of the prostate. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing methods were used to graphically explore the interaction among insurance status, use of local treatment, and baseline risk of cancer recurrence. The latter was defined using the Stephenson nomogram and CAPRA score.  Results:   Overall, 18,993 patients (93%) were insured, 849 (4.2%) had Medicaid coverage, and 551 (2.7%) were uninsured. At multivariable analysis, Medicaid coverage (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57, 0.80; P<.0001) and uninsured status (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46, 0.71; P<.0001) were independent predictors of a lower probability of presenting with low-risk disease. Likewise, Medicaid coverage (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60, 0.86; P=.0003) and uninsured status (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.37, 0.55; P<.0001) were independent predictors of a lower probability of receiving local treatment. In uninsured patients, treatment disparities became more pronounced as the baseline cancer recurrence risk increased (10% in low-risk patients vs 20% in high-risk patients).  Conclusions:   Medicaid beneficiaries and uninsured patients are diagnosed with higher-risk disease and are undertreated. The latter is more accentuated for patients with high-risk prostate cancer.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanistic role and assess clinical utility of the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNP H1) in prostate cancer progression among AA men.  Experimental design:   We employed an unbiased functional genomics approach coupled with suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and custom cDNA microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in microdissected tumors procured from age- and tumor grade-matched AA and Caucasian American (CA) men. Validation analysis was performed in independent cohorts and tissue microarrays. The underlying mechanisms of hnRNPH1 regulation and its impact on androgen receptor (AR) expression and tumor progression were explored.  Results:   Aberrant coexpression of AR and hnRNPH1 and downregulation of miR-212 were detected in prostate tumors and correlate with disease progression in AA men compared with CA men. Ectopic expression of miR-212 mimics downregulated hnRNPH1 transcripts, which in turn reduced expression of AR and its splice variant AR-V7 (or AR3) in prostate cancer cells. hnRNPH1 physically interacts with AR and steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) and primes activation of androgen-regulated genes in a ligand-dependent and independent manner. siRNA silencing of hnRNPH1 sensitized prostate cancer cells to bicalutamide and inhibited prostate tumorigenesis in vivo  Conclusions:   Our findings define novel roles for hnRNPH1 as a putative oncogene, splicing factor, and an auxiliary AR coregulator.

We aimed at assessing the impact of more extensive PLND on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in patients treated with surgery for locally advanced PCa.  Methods:   We examined data of 1586 pT3-T4 PCa patients treated with RP and extended PLND between 1987 and 2012 at a tertiary referral care center. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the relationship between the number of nodes removed and CSM rate, after adjusting for potential confounders. Survival estimates were based on the multivariable models.  Results:   The average number of nodes removed was 19 (median: 17; interquartile range: 11-23). Mean and median follow-up were 80 and 72 months, respectively. At multivariable analyses, Gleason score 8-10 (hazard ratio (HR): 2.5) and a higher number of positive nodes (HR: 1.06) were independently associated with higher CSM rate (all P<0.05). Conversely, higher number of removed LNs (HR: 0.94) and adjuvant radiotherapy (HR: 0.54) were independent predictors of lower CSM rates (all P⩽0.03).  Conclusions:   In pT3-T4 PCa patients, removal of a higher number of LNs during RP was associated with higher cancer-specific survival rates.

The monolayer adsorption of HVJ-E particles was confirmed by quartz crystal microbalance, fluorescent and atomic force microscopy analyses. By developing the HVJ-E coating with an affinity based cell trap within a glass capillary tube, we are able to gently isolate PC-3 from LN-Cap cells that represent adenocarcinoma without compromising cell viability.

On the other hand, it is known that the metabolic reprogramming with augmented glycolytic metabolism and enhanced proliferative capability is a characteristic of prostate cancer cells. The present study investigated the influence of RGN on the glycolytic metabolism of rat prostate by comparing transgenic adult animals overexpressing RGN (Tg-RGN) with their wild-type counterparts. Glucose consumption was significantly decreased in the prostate of Tg-RGN animals relatively to wild-type, and accompanied by the diminished expression of glucose transporter 3 and glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase. Also, prostates of Tg-RGN animals displayed lower lactate levels, which resulted from the diminished expression/activity of lactate dehydrogenase. The expression of the monocarboxylate transporter 4 responsible for the export of lactate to the extracellular space was also diminished with RGN overexpression. These results showed the effect of RGN in inhibiting the glycolytic metabolism in rat prostate, which was underpinned by a reduced cell proliferation index.

We retrospectively reviewed 120 men with clinically localized PCa undergoing mpMRI and radical prostatectomy. We obtained radiologic prediction of pECE from standard radiologic reports (standard read) and by a specialized reader blinded to clinical and pathologic findings (specialized read). We determined the incremental benefit of standard read and specialized read by sequential addition to a baseline clinical parameters-only logistic regression model predicting pECE. The sensitivity and specificity of standard read were 77% and 44%, respectively, whereas those of specialized read were 86% and 81%. The positive likelihood ratio was 1.7 at baseline, 1.7 adding standard read, and 6.5 adding specialized read. The negative likelihood ratio was 0.6 at baseline, 0.5 adding standard read, and 0.1 adding specialized read. Standard read modestly improved prediction of pECE, whereas specialized read improved it moderately.

The C/C genotype for the EZH2 rs3757441 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is linked with poor prognosis in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), but molecular and pathological characterization of this SNP is lacking.  Methods:   119 primary CRCs were analyzed. SNP was evaluated by real-time PCR from colonic healthy tissue, while EZH2 and H3K27me3 expression were studied by immunohistochemistry. We primarily looked for correlation between EZH2 rs3757441 genotypes and EZH2/H3K27me3 expression.

We have developed an in vitro model of androgen-resistance to characterise molecular changes occurring as androgen resistance evolves over time. Our aim is to understand biological network profiles of transcriptomic changes occurring during the transition to androgen-resistance and to validate these changes between our in vitro model and clinical datasets (paired samples before and after androgen-deprivation therapy of patients with advanced prostate cancer).  Methods:   We established an androgen-independent subline from LNCaP cells by prolonged exposure to androgen-deprivation. We examined phenotypic profiles and performed RNA-sequencing. The reads generated were compared to human clinical samples and were analysed using differential expression, pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction networks.  Results:   After 24 weeks of androgen-deprivation, LNCaP cells had increased proliferative and invasive behaviour compared to parental LNCaP, and its growth was no longer responsive to androgen. We identified key genes and pathways that overlap between our cell line and clinical RNA sequencing datasets and analysed the overlapping protein-protein interaction network that shared the same pattern of behaviour in both datasets. Mechanisms bypassing androgen receptor signalling pathways are significantly enriched. Several steroid hormone receptors are differentially expressed in both datasets. In particular, the progesterone receptor is significantly differentially expressed and is part of the interaction network disrupted in both datasets. Other signalling pathways commonly altered in prostate cancer, MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways, are significantly enriched in both datasets.  Conclusions:   The overlap between the human and cell-line differential expression profiles and protein networks was statistically significant showing that the cell-line model reproduces molecular patterns observed in clinical castrate resistant prostate cancer samples, making this cell line a useful tool in understanding castrate resistant prostate cancer.

Methods and results:   Among 3122 men and women free of cardiovascular disease and cancer in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis trial, CAC scoring was performed at baseline (2000-2002) and at follow-up (2010-2012). Over this 10-year period, 85 men (age 63.6±8.3 years) and 50 women (age 62.1±9.8 years) were diagnosed with cancer (predominantly breast, lung, or uterine [52%] in women and prostate or colorectal [78%] in men). The other 2987 subjects (age 59.6±9.2 years for men, 59.7±9.4 years for women) remained cancer free. The incidence of new CAC (baseline Agatston score of zero converting to detectable CAC) was modeled with relative risk regression and compared for cancer versus no cancer. Increase in pre-existing CAC was compared in these groups using linear regression of log transformed CAC. The incidence of CAC was independently associated with cancer history (relative risk 1.32 [P=0.04] and 1.29 [P=0.01] for women and men, respectively). In participants with CAC at baseline, a clear difference of CAC progression was not observed between cancer and noncancer participants (P=0.6 for women, P=0.2 for men).  Conclusions:   A diagnosis of cancer is associated with the development of CAC even after accounting for atherosclerotic risk factors. However, in individuals with pre-existing CAC, it is not clear whether the presence of cancer accelerates CAC over time.""","""['Matthew C Whitlock', 'Joseph Yeboah', 'Gregory L Burke', 'Haiying Chen', 'Heidi D Klepin', 'W Gregory Hundley']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Am Heart Assoc""","""['CT-Detected Growth of Coronary Artery\xa0Calcification in Asymptomatic Middle-Aged Subjects and Association With 15 Biomarkers.', 'Usefulness of Coronary Artery Calcium to Predict Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Men Versus Women (from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis).', 'Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity is associated with coronary calcium in young and middle-aged asymptomatic adults: The Kangbuk Samsung Health Study.', 'Computed Tomography for Coronary Artery Calcification Scoring: Mammogram for the Heart.', 'Coronary Artery Calcification.', 'Long-term and real-life incidence of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity in patients with breast cancer: a Swedish cohort study.', 'Effect of insulin resistance on CAC scores in cancer survivors.', 'The two facets of receptor tyrosine kinase in cardiovascular calcification-can tyrosine kinase inhibitors benefit cardiovascular system?', 'Cancer and cardiovascular disease: can understanding the mechanisms of cardiovascular injury guide us to optimise care in cancer survivors?', 'Fractional Flow Reserve Cardio-Oncology Effects on Inpatient Mortality, Length of Stay, and Cost Based on Malignancy Type: Machine Learning Supported Nationally Representative Case-Control Study of 30 Million Hospitalizations.']"""

The present study examined relationships among ethnicity, HRQoL, and two possible cultural vulnerability factors-fatalistic attitudes and medical mistrust-among an ethnically diverse sample of men with prostate cancer (PC) prior to undergoing active treatment.  Methods:   A total of 268 men with localized PC (30% African American, 29% Hispanic, and 41% non-Hispanic White) were assessed cross-sectionally prior to active treatment. Path analyses examined relationships among ethnicity, vulnerability factors, and HRQoL.  Results:   Ethnicity was not related to HRQoL after controlling for relevant covariates. Hispanic men reported greater cancer fatalism compared with non-Hispanic White men (β = 0.15, p = 0.03), and both Hispanics (β = 0.19, p < 0.01) and African Americans (β = 0.20, p < 0.01) reported greater medical mistrust than non-Hispanic Whites. Fatalism demonstrated a trend toward negatively impacting physical well-being (β = -0.12, p = 0.06), but was not significantly related to emotional well-being (β = -0.10, p = 0.11). Greater medical mistrust was associated with poorer physical (β = -0.14, p = 0.03) and emotional well-being (β = -0.13, p = 0.04).  Conclusions:   Results indicate that fatalistic attitudes and medical system mistrust were more prevalent among minority men. Less trust in the medical system was associated with poorer physical and emotional well-being. Attention to perceptions of the healthcare system and its relation to HRQoL may have implications for targeting culturally driven attitudes that may compromise adjustment to a PC diagnosis.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.""","""['Natalie Escobio Bustillo', 'Heather L McGinty', 'Jason R Dahn', 'Betina Yanez', 'Michael H Antoni', 'Bruce R Kava', 'Frank J Penedo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Knowledge and Attitudes, Preventative Health Behaviors, and Medical Mistrust Among a Racially and Ethnically Diverse Sample of College Women.', 'High Levels of Medical Mistrust Are Associated With Low Quality of Life Among Black and White Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Discrimination and Medical Mistrust in a Racially and Ethnically Diverse Sample of California Adults.', 'Perceptions of prostate cancer in Black African and Black Caribbean men: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Cultural mistrust and use of hospice care: challenges and remedies.', 'Sociocultural factors associated with physical activity in Black prostate cancer survivors.', 'Barriers in Healthcare for Latinx Patients with Limited English Proficiency-a Narrative Review.', '""There\'s no place like home"": Examining the associations between state eviction defense protections and indicators of biopsychosocial stress among survivors of intimate partner violence.', 'Stigma, beliefs and perceptions regarding prostate cancer among Black and Latino men and women.', 'Faith as a Mechanism for Health Promotion among Rural African American Prostate Cancer Survivors: A Qualitative Examination.']"""

Ways to further enhance this effect of celastrol has attracted much research attention.  Methods and results:   Here, we report that celastrol treatment can elevate miR-223 in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and prostate cancer PC3. Down-regulating miR-223 could increase the number of viable cells, yet it further reduced viable cells in samples that were treated by celastrol; up-regulation of miR-223 displayed opposite effects. Celastrol's miR-223 induction might be due to NF-κB inhibition and transient mTOR activation: these two events occurred prior to miR-223 elevation in celastrol-treated cells. NF-κB inhibitor, like celastrol, could induce miR-223; the induction of miR-223 by NF-κB inhibitor or celastrol was reduced by the use of mTOR inhibitor. Finally and interestingly, miR-223 also could affect NF-κB and mTOR and the effects were different between cells treated or not treated with celastrol, thus providing an explanation for differing effects of miR-223 alteration on cellular viability in the presence of celastrol or not.  Conclusions:   For the first time, we disclose that celastrol could induce miR-223 in breast and prostate cancer cells, and that inhibiting miR-223 could further reduce the living cells in celastrol-treated cancer cell lines. We thus provide a novel way to increase celastrol's anti-cancer effects.""","""['Lu Cao', 'Xue Zhang', 'Fanfan Cao', 'Ying Wang', 'Yufan Shen', 'Chunxin Yang', 'Georges Uzan', 'Bin Peng', 'Denghai Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""[""Peptide deformylase inhibitor actinonin reduces celastrol's HSP70 induction while synergizing proliferation inhibition in tumor cells."", 'Celastrol induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by miR-21 inhibiting PI3K/Akt-NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'miR-224 is critical for celastrol-induced inhibition of migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Celastrol as an emerging anticancer agent: Current status, challenges and therapeutic strategies.', 'Molecular targets of celastrol in cancer: Recent trends and advancements.', 'Exosomal miRNA-223-3p derived from tumor associated macrophages promotes pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer 4T1 cells.', 'SHP2 inhibition improves celastrol-induced growth suppression of colorectal cancer.', 'Metabolomic changes of neonatal sepsis: an exploratory clinical study.', 'Platelet-Derived miR-126-3p Directly Targets AKT2 and Exerts Anti-Tumor Effects in Breast Cancer Cells: Further Insights in Platelet-Cancer Interplay.', 'Inhibition of PKC/MEK pathway suppresses β1-integrin and mitigates breast cancer cells proliferation.']"""

The aim of this study was to identify germline copy number variants (CNVs) in Finnish individuals that could contribute to an increased PrCa risk.  Methods:   Genome-wide CNV screening was performed by analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms from 105 PrCa patients and 37 unaffected relatives, representing 31 Finnish hereditary PrCa (HPC) families. The CNVs that aggregated in affected individuals and overlapped with genes implicated in cancer were validated using quantitative PCR in 189 index patients from Finnish HPC families and in 476 controls.  Results:   An intronic deletion (14.7 kb) in the EPHA3 gene coding for class A ephrin receptor was observed in 11.6% of PrCa patients and in 6.1% of controls. The deletion associated with an increased PrCa risk (P = 0.018, OR = 2.06, 95%CI = 1.18-3.61). Although incomplete segregation with affection status was observed, the results show that the deletion was overrepresented in PrCa patients (56.1%) when compared to unaffected male relatives (31.2%). Interestingly, PrCa-specific mortality was higher among EPHA3 deletion carriers (24.3%) than among patients with a normal EPHA3 copy number (3.4%).  Conclusions:   This study is the first investigation of the contribution of germline CNVs to HPC susceptibility in Finland. A novel association between the EPHA3 deletion and PrCa risk was observed and, if confirmed, screening for this variant may aid in risk stratification among HPC patients.""","""['Virpi H Laitinen', 'Oyediran Akinrinade', 'Tommi Rantapero', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Tiina Wahlfors', 'Johanna Schleutker']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['copy number variation analysis in familial BRCA1/2-negative Finnish breast and ovarian cancer.', 'Germline alterations of the RNASEL gene, a candidate HPC1 gene at 1q25, in patients and families with prostate cancer.', 'Identification of germline MLH1 alterations in familial prostate cancer.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Hereditary Predisposition to Prostate Cancer: From Genetics to Clinical Implications.', 'Integrative Analysis of Germline Rare Variants in Clear and Non-Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'A Novel Computational Framework to Predict Disease-Related Copy Number Variations by Integrating Multiple Data Sources.', 'An accurate and powerful method for copy number variation detection.', 'Germline copy number variations are associated with breast cancer risk and prognosis.', 'Candidate predisposing germline copy number variants in early onset colorectal cancer patients.']"""

However, the mechanisms regulating AR activity in CRPC remain incompletely understood. Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) 2 was previously shown to regulate AR activity in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells. Our objective was to further explore the basis of this regulation in CRPC cells.  Methods:   The abundance of CaMKK2 in nuclear fractions of androgen-responsive prostate cancer and CRPC, cells were determined by subcellular fractionation and Western blotting. CaMKK2 association with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and nucleoporins (Nups) including Nup62, were imaged by structured illumination and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. The abundance and subcellular localization of CaMKK2 and Nup62 in human clinical specimens of prostate cancer was visualized by immunohistochemistry. The role of Nups in the growth and viability of CRPC cells was assessed by RNA interference and cell counting. The involvement of CaMKK2 and Nup62 in regulating AR transcriptional activity was addressed by RNA interference, chromatin immunoprecipitation, androgen response element reporter assay, and Western blotting.  Results:   CaMKK2 was expressed at higher levels in the nuclear fraction of CPRC C4-2 cells, than in that of androgen-responsive LNCaP cells. In C4-2 cells, CaMKK2 associated with NPCs of the nuclear envelope and physically interacted with Nup62. CaMKK2 and Nup62 demonstrated pronounced, and similar increases in both expression and perinuclear/nuclear localization in human clinical specimens of advanced prostate cancer relative to normal prostate. Knockdown of Nup62, but not of Nups, 98 or 88, reduced growth and viability of C4-2 cells. Knockdown of Nup62 produced a greater reduction of the growth and viability of C4-2 cells than of non-neoplastic RWPE-1 prostatic cells. Nup62, CaMKK2, and the AR were recruited to androgen response elements of the AR target genes, prostate specific antigen, and transmembrane protease, serine 2. Knockdown of CaMKK2 and Nup62 reduced prostate specific antigen expression and AR transcriptional activity driven by androgen response elements from the prostate-specific probasin gene promoter.  Conclusion:   Nup62 and CaMKK2 are required for optimal AR transcriptional activity and a potential mechanism for AR re-activation in CRPC.""","""['Loukia G Karacosta', 'Laura A Kuroski', 'Wilma A Hofmann', 'Gissou Azabdaftari', 'Michalis Mastri', 'Angela M Gocher', 'Shuhang Dai', 'Allen J Hoste', 'Arthur M Edelman']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A regulatory feedback loop between Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Regulation of the transcriptional coactivator FHL2 licenses activation of the androgen receptor in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Down-regulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 by androgen deprivation induces castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Overexpressed Nup88 stabilized through interaction with Nup62 promotes NF-κB dependent pathways in cancer.', 'Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.', 'Nuclear Pore Glycoprotein 62 Genetic Variant rs9523 is Associated with Clinical Outcomes of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients.', 'Role of Calcium Signaling in Prostate Cancer Progression: Effects on Cancer Hallmarks and Bone Metastatic Mechanisms.', 'Oncogenic potential of nucleoporins in non-hematological cancers: recent update beyond chromosome translocation and gene fusion.']"""

However, phase III trials testing continuous androgen deprivation (CAD) versus IAD have reached inconclusive and seemingly contradictory results. Different design and conduct issues must be critically evaluated to better interpret the results.  Patients and methods:   Seven published phase III trials were examined for prespecified design and outcomes. Treatment specifications; primary end point; superiority versus noninferiority design assumptions, including magnitude of assumed versus observed noninferiority margin (NIM); duration of follow-up; and quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes were considered in terms of the results and conclusions reported.  Results:   Five trials had a superiority and three had a noninferiority primary hypothesis. Only three trials had a uniform population and overall survival (OS) end point. All trials observed better outcomes in terms of OS and progression-free survival (PFS) than assumed at time of study design, translating into prespecified NIMs or hazard ratios that reflected larger absolute differences in OS or PFS between arms. Lower-than-expected event rates also reduced statistical power for the trials. Other factors, including length of follow-up, cause of death, QOL, and primary end point, and their impact on trial interpretation are discussed.  Conclusion:   No trial to date has demonstrated survival superiority of IAD compared with CAD. Trials concluding IAD is noninferior to CAD were based on wide NIMs that included clinically important survival differences, not likely to be considered comparable by physicians or patients. Interim analyses relying on short follow-up and including a majority of non-prostate cancer deaths will favor a noninferiority conclusion and should be interpreted cautiously.

The invasive ability of the prostate cancer cells was evidently inhibited, with the inhibition rates of 32% and 44% of the PC3 cells and 43% and 34% of the DU145 cells for si-HOTAIR1 and si-HOTAIR2, respectively.

Extensive in vitro and in vivo data has confirmed that metastasizing tumor cells can adopt different migratory modes in response to their microenvironment. Here we present a model that uses human stromal cell-derived matrices to demonstrate that plasticity in tumor cell movement is controlled by the tumor-associated collagen receptor Endo180 (CD280, CLEC13E, KIAA0709, MRC2, TEM9, uPARAP) and the crosslinking of collagen fibers by stromal-derived lysyl oxidase (LOX). Human osteoblast-derived and fibroblast-derived ECM supported a rounded 'amoeboid-like' mode of cell migration and enhanced Endo180 expression in three prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, VCaP, DU145). Genetic silencing of Endo180 reverted PC3 cells from their rounded mode of migration towards a bipolar 'mesenchymal-like' mode of migration and blocked their translocation on human fibroblast-derived and osteoblast-derived matrices. The concomitant decrease in PC3 cell migration and increase in Endo180 expression induced by stromal LOX inhibition indicates that the Endo180-dependent rounded mode of prostate cancer cell migration requires ECM crosslinking. In conclusion, this study introduces a realistic in vitro model for the study of metastatic prostate cancer cell plasticity and pinpoints the cooperation between tumor-associated Endo180 and the stiff microenvironment imposed by stromal-derived LOX as a potential target for limiting metastatic progression in prostate cancer.""","""['Matthew P Caley', 'Helen King', 'Neel Shah', 'Kai Wang', 'Mercedes Rodriguez-Teja', 'Julian H Gronau', 'Jonathan Waxman', 'Justin Sturge']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['uPARAP/Endo180: a multifaceted protein of mesenchymal cells.', 'TGFβ1-Endo180-dependent collagen deposition is dysregulated at the tumour-stromal interface in bone metastasis.', 'AGE-modified basement membrane cooperates with Endo180 to promote epithelial cell invasiveness and decrease prostate cancer survival.', 'Endo180 expression with cofunctional partners MT1-MMP and uPAR-uPA is correlated with prostate cancer progression.', 'The collagen receptor uPARAP/Endo180.', 'Collagen-Specific Molecular Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Follow-Up Biomarkers in the Evolution of Prostate Cancer, Levels of S100A4 as a Detector in Plasma.', 'The Extracellular Matrix Stiffening: A Trigger of Prostate Cancer Progression and Castration Resistance?', 'uPARAP/Endo180: a multifaceted protein of mesenchymal cells.', 'Prostate cancer metastasis and soy isoflavones: a dogfight over a bone.']"""

This non-canonical activation of Hh is specifically mediated by Gli2. Furthermore, we show that the N-terminal domain of FOXC1 (aa 1-68) binds directly to an internal region (aa 898-1168) of Gli2, enhancing the DNA-binding and transcription-activating capacity of Gli2.

Moreover, FOXC1 overexpression reduces sensitivity to anti-Hedgehog (Hh) inhibitors in BLBC cells and xenograft tumors.

The purpose of this study was to investigate sexual dysfunction post-RT for localized prostate cancer and to examine whether radiation dose to different penile structures can explain these symptoms.  Methods:   We investigated sexual dysfunction in two treated prostate cancer cohorts and in one non-pelvic-irradiated cohort, 328 sexually active men part of an unselected, population-based study conducted in 2008. The treated subjects were prescribed primary/salvage external-beam RT to 70 Gy@2.0 Gy/fraction. Absorbed RT doses (Dmean and Dmax ) of the corpora cavernosa (CC), the penile bulb (PB), and the total penile structure (CC + PB) were related to 13 patient-reported symptoms on sexual dysfunction by means of factor analysis (FA) and logistic regression.  Results:   Three distinct symptom domains were identified across all cohorts: ""erectile dysfunction"" (ED, two to five symptoms), ""orgasmic dysfunction"" (OD, two to four symptoms), and ""pain"" (two to three symptoms). The strongest predictor for ED symptoms was CC + PB Dmax (P = 0.001-0.03), CC and PB Dmean predicted OD symptoms equally well (P = 0.03 and 0.02-0.05, respectively), and the strongest predictor for pain symptoms was CC + PB Dmean (P = 0.02-0.03).

The five prognostic grade groupings (PGGs) ranging from 1 to 5 are defined as Gleason grades ≤ 6, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 8, and > 8, respectively. Recent work suggests that each group is associated with a distinct risk of biochemical PCa recurrence. In this study, we sought genomic support for PGGs using whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing data for 426 clinically localized PCas treated by radical prostatectomy. After adjustment for tumor purity for the sequencing data, we observed a significant frequency increase in genomic amplifications and deletions (p = 0.013) and in nonsynonymous point mutations (p = 0.008) with increasing risk group. Interestingly, PGG1 (low risk) was entirely haploid, whereas PGG2-5 exhibited increasing polyploidy frequency. Principal component analysis of genomic profiles revealed that PGG1, PGG2, and PGG3 represent distinct classes, but PGG4 and PGG5 exhibit genomic similarity. Together, these observations for the largest PCa genomic data set to date provide support for increasing genomic alterations with increasing PGG. This is the first genomic correlation of the PGG system. Future work will need to explore the clinical utility of PGGs in prospective studies with long-term follow-up.  Patient summary:   Gleason grading for prostate cancer provides important information for guiding clinical care. A new proposal by leading pathologists favors translating Gleason grades into five risk categories. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of the largest genomic data set on prostate cancer to date, we demonstrate molecular support for this new five-tiered system.""","""['Mark A Rubin', 'Gabriele Girelli', 'Francesca Demichelis']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['The New Age of Molecular Taxonomy Approaches.', 'Spatial Intratumor Genomic Heterogeneity within Localized Prostate Cancer Revealed by Single-nucleus Sequencing.', 'Characterization of 1577 primary prostate cancers reveals novel biological and clinicopathologic insights into molecular subtypes.', 'Unfavorable Pathology, Tissue Biomarkers and Genomic Tests With Clinical Implications in Prostate Cancer Management.', 'The mutational landscape of prostate cancer.', 'Multiregional Radiogenomic Assessment of Prostate Microenvironments with Multiparametric MR Imaging and DNA Whole-Exome Sequencing of Prostate Glands with Adenocarcinoma.', 'Clinical characteristics analysis and prognostic nomogram for predicting survival in patients with second primary prostate cancer: a population study based on SEER database.', 'Translational Bioinformatics for Human Reproductive Biology Research: Examples, Opportunities and Challenges for a Future Reproductive Medicine.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.', 'Risk Estimation of Metastatic Recurrence After Prostatectomy: A Model Using Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Targeted Biopsy.', 'Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer: The Impact of Grading Criteria and the Significance of the Amount of Intraductal Carcinoma.']"""

We aimed to develop and validate a model to identify high-risk prostate cancer (with a Gleason score of at least 7) with better test characteristics than that provided by PSA screening alone.  Methods:   The Stockholm 3 (STHLM3) study is a prospective, population-based, paired, screen-positive, diagnostic study of men without prostate cancer aged 50-69 years randomly invited by date of birth from the Swedish Population Register kept by the Swedish Tax Agency. Men with prostate cancer at enrolment were excluded from the study. The predefined STHLM3 model (a combination of plasma protein biomarkers [PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, hK2, MSMB, MIC1], genetic polymorphisms [232 SNPs], and clinical variables [age, family, history, previous prostate biopsy, prostate exam]), and PSA concentration were both tested in all participants enrolled. The primary aim was to increase the specificity compared with PSA without decreasing the sensitivity to diagnose high-risk prostate cancer. The primary outcomes were number of detected high-risk cancers (sensitivity) and the number of performed prostate biopsies (specificity). The STHLM3 training cohort was used to train the STHLM3 model, which was prospectively tested in the STHLM3 validation cohort. Logistic regression was used to test for associations between biomarkers and clinical variables and prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 7. This study is registered with ISCRTN.com, number ISRCTN84445406.  Findings:   The STHLM3 model performed significantly better than PSA alone for detection of cancers with a Gleason score of at least 7 (p<0·0001), the area under the curve was 0·56 (95% CI 0·55-0·60) with PSA alone and 0·74 (95% CI 0·72-0·75) with the STHLM3 model. All variables used in the STHLM3 model were significantly associated with prostate cancers with a Gleason score of at least 7 (p<0·05) in a multiple logistic regression model. At the same level of sensitivity as the PSA test using a cutoff of ≥3 ng/mL to diagnose high risk prostate cancer, use of the STHLM3 model could reduce the number of biopsies by 32% (95% CI 24-39) and could avoid 44% (35-54) of benign biopsies.  Interpretation:   The STHLM3 model could reduce unnecessary biopsies without compromising the ability to diagnose prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 7, and could be a step towards personalised risk-based prostate cancer diagnostic programmes.

Tissue microarray analysis reveals that elevated SET expression correlates with clinical cancer grading, duration of neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) and time to biochemical recurrence. Using prostate regeneration assays, we show that in vivo SET overexpression is sufficient to induce hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Knockdown of SET induced significant reductions in tumorgenesis both in murine and human xenograft models. To further validate SET as a therapeutic target, we conducted in vitro and in vivo treatments using OP449 - a recently characterized PP2A-activating drug (PAD). OP449 elicits robust anti-cancer effects inhibiting growth in a panel of enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cell lines.

However, the majority of studies supporting its prognostic relevance were performed prior to its modification by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) in 2005. Furthermore, the combination of Gleason grading and nuclear/nucleolar subgrading (Helpap score) has been shown to essentially improve grading concordance between biopsy and radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. This prompted us to investigate the modified GS and combigrading (Gleason/Helpap score) in association with clinicopathological features, biochemical recurrence (BCR), and survival. Core needle biopsies and corresponding RP specimens from 580 patients diagnosed with PCa between 2005 and 2010 were evaluated. According to the modified GS, the comparison between biopsy and RP samples resulted in an upgrading from GS 6 to GS 7a and GS 7b in 65% and 19%, respectively. Combigrading further resulted in an upgrading from low grade (GS 6/2a) to intermediate grade PCa (GS 6/2b) in 11.1% and from intermediate grade (GS 6/2b) to high grade PCa (GS 7b/2b) in 22.6%. Overall, well-differentiated PCa (GS 6/2a) was detected in 2.8% of RP specimens, while intermediate grade (GS 6/2b and GS 7a/2b) and high grade cancers (≥ GS 7b) accounted for 39.5% and 57.4% of cases, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, BCR was observed in 17.6% of patients with intermediate (9.8%) or high grade PCa (30.2%), while PSA relapse did not occur in GS 6/2a PCa. In conclusion, adding nuclear/nucleolar subgrading to the modified GS allowed for a more accurate distinction between low and intermediate grade PCa, therefore offering a valuable tool for the identification of patients eligible for active surveillance (AS).""","""['Burkhard Helpap', 'Daniel Ringli', 'Jens Tonhauser', 'Immanuel Poser', 'Jürgen Breul', 'Heidrun Gevensleben', 'Hans-Helge Seifert']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Pathol Oncol Res""","""['Outcomes of Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer with minimal amounts (<6%) vs ≥6% of Gleason pattern 4 tissue in needle biopsy specimens.', 'Role of prostate health index to predict Gleason score upgrading and high-risk prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20094=7 prostate cancer with minimal quantity of gleason pattern 4 on needle biopsy is associated with low-risk tumor in radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The value of the modified Gleason grading system of prostate adenocarcinoma in routine urological diagnostics.', 'The prognostic impact of lung adenocarcinoma predominance classification relating to pathological factors in lobectomy, the Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry Database in 2010.', 'Utility of Newly Proposed Grading System From International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer for Invasive Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'A critical evaluation of visual proportion of Gleason 4 and maximum cancer core length quantified by histopathologists.', 'A Grading System for Invasive Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma: A Proposal From the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Pathology Committee.', 'RRBP1 is highly expressed in prostate cancer and correlates with prognosis.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of 35 consecutive patients (49-78 years, median 71) with newly diagnosed PC (12/35) or recurrence of PC (23/35). PET/CT (Gemini TF16, Philips) was acquired 1 h and 3 h p. i. of 140-392 MBq (300 MBq median) (68)Ga-PSMA, followed by a diagnostic contrast CT. PET findings were correlated with histology or unequivocal CT findings. Semiquantitative PET data (SUVmax, SUV mean) were acquired and target-to-background-ratios (T/B-ratio) were calculated for benign and malign lesions for both time points. Size of lymph nodes (LN) on diagnostic CT was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed for assessment of significant changes of semiquantitative PET-parameters over time and for correlation of size and uptake of lymph nodes.  Results:   One hundred and four lesions were evaluated. Sixty lesions were referenced by histology or unequivocal CT findings, including eight (13.3 %) histopathologically benign lymph nodes, 12 (20 %) histopathologically lymph node metastases, 12 (20 %) primary tumors, three (5 %) local recurrences, and 25 (41.7 %) bone metastases. Forty-four lesions were axillary LN with normal CT-appearance. Benign lesions had significantly lower SUVmax and T/B-ratios compared with malignant findings. Malign lesions showed a significant increase of both parameters over time compared to benign findings. There was no correlation between LN size and SUVmax. The sensitivity, specificity, the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of PET/CT regarding pelvic LN was 94 %, 99 %, 89 %, and 99.5 %, respectively.  Conclusions:   In contrast to benign tissues, the uptake of proven tumor lesions increases on (68)Ga-PSMA-PET/CT over time. A biphasic PET-study may lead to a better detection of tumor lesions in unequivocal findings.""","""['Carsten-Oliver Sahlmann', 'Birgit Meller', 'Caroline Bouter', 'Christian Oliver Ritter', 'Philipp Ströbel', 'Joachim Lotz', 'Lutz Trojan', 'Johannes Meller', 'Sameh Hijazi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Value of 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET for the Assessment of Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence: Comparison with Histopathology After Salvage Lymphadenectomy.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'PSA levels, PSA doubling time, Gleason score and prior therapy cannot predict measured uptake of 68GaPSMA-HBED-CC lesion uptake in recurrent/metastatic prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-radioguided surgery in localized recurrent prostate cancer : Current and future aspects.', 'Novel technology of molecular radio-guidance for lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer by PSMA-ligands.', 'Combined forced diuresis and late acquisition on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT for biochemical recurrent prostate cancer: a clinical practice-oriented study.', 'Evaluation of 68\xa0GaGa-PSMA-I&T PET/CT with additional late scans of the pelvis in prostate-specific antigen recurrence using the PROMISE criteria.', 'The Role of PSMA PET/CT in the Primary Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Prostate Cancer-A Practical Clinical Review.', 'Biphasic GA 68-labeled prostate specific membrane antigen-11 positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans in the differential diagnosis and risk stratification of initial primary prostate cancer.', 'Impact of the Noise Penalty Factor on Quantification in Bayesian Penalized Likelihood (Q.Clear) Reconstructions of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Scans.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively studied the first 155 patients with recurrent prostate cancer (PCA) referred to our university hospital for [(68)Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT.  Results:   PET/CT was positive in 44%, 79% and 89% of patients with PSA levels of ≤1, 1-2 and ≥2 ng/ml, respectively. Patients with high PSA levels showed higher rates of local prostate tumours (p < 0.001), and extrapelvic lymph node (p = 0.037) and bone metastases (p = 0.013). A shorter PSAdt was significantly associated with pelvic lymph node (p = 0.026), extrapelvic lymph node (p = 0.001), bone (p < 0.001) and visceral (p = 0.041) metastases. A high Gleason score was associated with more frequent pelvic lymph node metastases (p = 0.039). In multivariate analysis, both PSA and PSAdt were independent determinants of scan positivity and of extrapelvic lymph node metastases. PSAdt was the only independent marker of bone metastases (p = 0.001). Of 20 patients with a PSAdt <6 months and a PSA ≥2 ng/ml, 19 (95%) had a positive scan and 12 (60%) had M1a disease. Of 14 patients with PSA <1 ng/ml and PSAdt >6 months, only 5 (36%) had a positive scan and 1 (7%) had M1a disease.  Conclusion:   [(68)Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT will identify PCA lesions even in patients with very low PSA levels.

Tissue heterogeneity normal to the beam direction or near the end of range may considerably degrade the ability of prompt gamma imaging to detect proton range shifts. The goal of this study was to systematically investigate the accuracy and precision of range detection from prompt gamma emission profiles for various fractions for intensity modulated proton therapy of prostate cancer, using a comprehensive clinical dataset of 15 different CT scans for 5 patients. Monte Carlo simulations using Geant4 were performed to generate spot-by-spot dose distributions and prompt gamma emission profiles for prostate treatment plans. The prompt gammas were scored at their point of emission. Three CT scans of the same patient were used to evaluate the impact of inter-fractional changes on proton range. The range shifts deduced from the comparison of prompt gamma emission profiles in the planning CT and subsequent CTs were then correlated to the corresponding range shifts deduced from the dose distributions for individual pencil beams. The distributions of range shift differences between prompt gamma and dose were evaluated in terms of precision (defined as half the 95% inter-percentile range IPR) and accuracy (median). In total about 1700 individual proton pencil beams were investigated. The IPR of the relative range shift differences between the dose profiles and the prompt gamma profiles varied between ±1.4 mm and ±2.9 mm when using the more robust profile shifting analysis. The median was found smaller than 1 mm. Methods to identify and reject unreliable spots for range verification due to range mixing were derived and resulted in an average 10% spot rejection, clearly improving the prompt gamma-dose correlation. This work supports that prompt gamma imaging can offer a reliable indicator of range changes due to anatomical variations and tissue heterogeneity in scanning proton treatment of prostate cancer patients when considering prompt gamma emission profiles.""","""['S Schmid', 'G Landry', 'C Thieke', 'F Verhaegen', 'U Ganswindt', 'C Belka', 'K Parodi', 'G Dedes']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A new treatment planning approach accounting for prompt gamma range verification and interfractional anatomical changes.', 'Accounting for prompt gamma emission and detection for range verification in proton therapy treatment planning.', 'Imaging of prompt gamma rays emitted during delivery of clinical proton beams with a Compton camera: feasibility studies for range verification.', 'Range uncertainties in proton therapy and the role of Monte Carlo simulations.', 'Prompt-gamma fall-off estimation with C-ion irradiation at clinical energies, using a knife-edge slit camera: A Monte Carlo study.', 'Comparison of reconstructed prompt gamma emissions using maximum likelihood estimation and origin ensemble algorithms for a Compton camera system tailored to proton range monitoring.', 'Latest developments in in-vivo imaging for proton therapy.']"""

Among the various existing methods for landmark detection, regression-based methods have recently attracted much attention due to their robustness and efficiency. In these methods, landmarks are localised through voting from all image voxels, which is completely different from the classification-based methods that use voxel-wise classification to detect landmarks. Despite their robustness, the accuracy of regression-based landmark detection methods is often limited due to (1) the inclusion of uninformative image voxels in the voting procedure, and (2) the lack of effective ways to incorporate inter-landmark spatial dependency into the detection step. In this paper, we propose a collaborative landmark detection framework to address these limitations. The concept of collaboration is reflected in two aspects. (1) Multi-resolution collaboration. A multi-resolution strategy is proposed to hierarchically localise landmarks by gradually excluding uninformative votes from faraway voxels. Moreover, for informative voxels near the landmark, a spherical sampling strategy is also designed at the training stage to improve their prediction accuracy. (2) Inter-landmark collaboration. A confidence-based landmark detection strategy is proposed to improve the detection accuracy of 'difficult-to-detect' landmarks by using spatial guidance from 'easy-to-detect' landmarks. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments extensively on three datasets for detecting prostate landmarks and head & neck landmarks in computed tomography images, and also dental landmarks in cone beam computed tomography images. The results show the effectiveness of our collaborative landmark detection framework in improving landmark detection accuracy, compared to other state-of-the-art methods.""","""['Yaozong Gao', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Context-guided fully convolutional networks for joint craniomaxillofacial bone segmentation and landmark digitization.', 'A knowledge-based algorithm for automatic detection of cephalometric landmarks on CBCT images.', 'Automatic Craniomaxillofacial Landmark Digitization via Segmentation-Guided Partially-Joint Regression Forest Model and Multiscale Statistical Features.', 'Locally-constrained boundary regression for segmentation of prostate and rectum in the planning CT images.', 'Reliability and reproducibility of three-dimensional cephalometric landmarks using CBCT: a systematic review.', 'Fast and Accurate Craniomaxillofacial Landmark Detection via 3D Faster R-CNN.', 'Deep Geodesic Learning for Segmentation and Anatomical Landmarking.', 'Hierarchical Vertex Regression-Based Segmentation of Head and Neck CT Images for Radiotherapy Planning.', 'Accurate Segmentation of CT Male Pelvic Organs via Regression-Based Deformable Models and Multi-Task Random Forests.']"""

Our approach achieved reasonably accurate classification of Gleason scores (GS) 6(3 + 3) vs. ≥7 and 7(3 + 4) vs. 7(4 + 3) despite the presence of highly unbalanced samples by using two different sample augmentation techniques followed by feature selection-based classification.

Our approach distinguished the GS 7(3 + 4) from GS 7(4 + 3) with 92% accuracy for cancers occurring in both the PZ and TZ and with 93% for cancers occurring in the PZ alone. In comparison, a classifier using only the ADC mean achieved a top accuracy of 58% for distinguishing GS 6(3 + 3) vs. GS ≥7 for cancers occurring in PZ and TZ and 63% for cancers occurring in PZ alone. The same classifier achieved an accuracy of 59% for distinguishing GS 7(3 + 4) from GS 7(4 + 3) occurring in the PZ and TZ and 60% for cancers occurring in PZ alone.

Because age affects treatment decisions, it is important to understand the efficacy and tolerability of therapies for advanced prostate cancer in elderly men. This analysis describes efficacy and safety outcomes in men aged ≥75 years who received enzalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor, in the phase III PREVAIL trial.  Patients and methods:   PREVAIL was a randomised, double-blind, multinational study of oral enzalutamide 160 mg/day (N = 872) versus placebo (N = 845) in chemotherapy-naive men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) were coprimary end points. Subgroup analysis of men aged ≥75 years (elderly) and men aged <75 years was pre-specified for the coprimary end points and adverse events (AEs).  Results:   Among 609 elderly patients (35%) who participated in PREVAIL, median treatment duration was 16.6 and 5.0 months in the enzalutamide and placebo arms, respectively. In the elderly subgroup, OS was greater with enzalutamide than with placebo [32.4 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 27.7-not yet reached] versus 25.1 months (95% CI 22.6-28.0); hazard ratio (HR) = 0.61 (95% CI 0.47-0.79); P = 0.0001], as was rPFS [not yet reached (95% CI 12.3-not yet reached) versus 3.7 months (95% CI 3.6-5.3); HR = 0.17 (95% CI 0.12-0.24); P < 0.0001]. Irrespective of treatment assignment, incidence of AEs was similar between the two age groups, except for an overall higher incidence of falls among elderly patients than younger patients [84/609 (13.8%) versus 62/1106 (5.6%)] and among elderly patients receiving enzalutamide than those receiving placebo [61/317 (19.2%) versus 23/292 (7.9%)].  Conclusions:   Elderly men benefited from treatment with enzalutamide in terms of OS and rPFS. Enzalutamide was well tolerated in the elderly subgroup and those aged <75 years.

Modifications in the surgical technique may help to further improve functional outcomes.  Objective:   To assess the outcome of early catheter removal 48h after surgery, as opposed to standard catheter removal 6 d after surgery following RARP, using a newly developed surgical technique for posterior reconstruction and anastomosis (Aalst technique).  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients scheduled for RARP were prospectively scheduled for early catheter removal at postoperative d 2 (group A, n=37) and standard catheter removal at postoperative d 6 (group B, n=37).  Surgical procedure:   RARP was performed using the Da Vinci Si system. The Aalst technique for the urethro-vesical anastomosis including posterior reconstruction was used as previously described.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was spontaneous voiding after catheter removal. Secondary endpoints were rate of anastomotic urinary leakage after catheter removal, presence and severity of urethral, perineal, and abdominal pain, as well as patient's bother after catheter removal using visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Rate and severity of urinary incontinence after catheter removal were assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Module (ICIQ-MLUTS) questionnaire.  Results and limitations:   There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to baseline and perioperative parameters, as well as pathological features; however, significantly more patients underwent bilateral nerve-sparing procedures in group A (34 vs 23, p=0.008). After catheter removal, patients in both groups showed spontaneous voiding, whereas only 11% and 8% of the patients in group A and group B experienced urinary retention after catheter removal (p=0.7). Patients in group B had significantly higher maximum flow rates, but lower voided volumes after catheter removal in comparison with patients in group A (21ml/s vs 10ml/s, p≤0.001 and 170ml vs 200ml, p≤0.001, respectively). ICIQ-MLUTS questionnaire and VAS scores showed no significant differences between the groups at any time point.  Conclusions:   The Aalst technique allows the removal of catheters 2 d after RARP and results in spontaneous voiding. Early removal showed no increased rate of urinary leakage, no negative impact on short-term continence and on perineal, urethral or penile pain, and no increase in urinary retention rates. Future studies have to confirm these results with longer follow-up including detailed parameters on return to daily activity.  Patient summary:   We provide evidence that it is possible to remove the bladder catheter as early as 2 d after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy without any negative effects on voiding and pain parameters. Thus, leaving the hospital early without a catheter in place could represent a significant and relevant benefit for the patient.""","""['Christian Gratzke', 'Zach Dovey', 'Giacomo Novara', 'Nicolas Geurts', 'Ruben De Groote', 'Peter Schatteman', 'Geert de Naeyer', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Alexandre Mottrie']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Early urethral catheter removal after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Use of Scaffolding Tissue Biografts To Bolster Vesicourethral Anastomosis During Salvage Robot-assisted Prostatectomy Reduces Leak Rates and Catheter Times.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Current techniques to improve outcomes for early return of urinary continence following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Development and Implementation of an Advanced Program for Robotic Treatment of Prostate Cancer-Is Surgical Quality Transferable?', 'Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Breast Surgery: Recent Evidence with Comparative Clinical Outcomes.', 'Clinical significance and risk factors of urethrovesical anastomotic urinary leakage following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional study.', 'Incidence and impact of acute urinary retention after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of enhanced recovery after surgery or fast track surgery pathways in minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Patients were divided into three groups according to their preoperative PV calculated using TRUS (PV ≤ 20 cm(3): group 1, n = 61; 20 < PV < 50 cm(3): group 2, n = 303; PV ≥ 50 cm(3): group 3, n = 72).  Results:   Blood loss was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1 and group 2.

Biochemical recurrence-free survival after RARP was significantly lower in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3.  Conclusions:   A large prostate size was significantly associated with increased blood loss and a higher rate of perioperative complications.

Of tumor-prone prostate epithelial cell types, luminal epithelial cells exhibited the highest transcript and protein abundance of 4EBP1 and the lowest protein synthesis rates, which mediated resistance to both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. Decreasing total 4EBP1 abundance reversed resistance in drug-insensitive cells. Increased 4EBP1 abundance was a common feature in prostate cancer patients who had been treated with the PI3K pathway inhibitor BKM120; thus, 4EBP1 may be associated with drug resistance in human tumors. Our findings reveal a molecular program controlling cell type-specific 4EBP1 abundance coupled to the regulation of global protein synthesis rates that renders each epithelial cell type of the prostate uniquely sensitive or resistant to inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.""","""['Andrew C Hsieh', 'Hao G Nguyen', 'Lexiaochuan Wen', 'Merritt P Edlind', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Won Kim', 'Davide Ruggero']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sci Signal""","""['Molecular mechanisms of resistance to phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, XL765 (SAR245409), shows superior effects to sole PI3K XL147 (SAR245408) or mTOR rapamycin inhibition in prostate cancer cell models.', 'Inhibiting 4EBP1 in Glioblastoma.', 'PI3K-Akt/LKB1-AMPK-mTOR-p70S6K/4EBP1 signaling pathways participate in the regulation of testis development and spermatogenesis: An update.', 'Sirtuin 6 is required for the integrated stress response and resistance to inhibition of transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases.', 'Multi-omic profiling reveals an RNA processing rheostat that predisposes to prostate cancer.', 'The long non-coding RNA PVT1 promotes tumorigenesis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma via interaction with 4EBP1.', 'Regulation of eIF4E guides a unique translational program to control erythroid maturation.', 'Defining cellular population dynamics at single-cell resolution during prostate cancer progression.']"""

Our objective was to develop and apply a lifestyle score for prevention of lethal prostate cancer.  Methods:   We developed a lifestyle score among 42 701 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) followed from 1986 to 2010 and applied it among 20 324 men in the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) followed from 1982 to 2010. One point was given for each of: not currently smoking or quit 10 or more years ago, body mass index under 30 kg/m(2), high vigorous physical activity, high intake of tomatoes and fatty fish, and low intake of processed meat. Diet-only scores (range = 0-3) and total scores (range = 0-6) were calculated. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the risk of lethal prostate cancer, adjusting for potential risk factors of lethal prostate cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   We observed 576 lethal prostate cancer events in HPFS and 337 in PHS. Men with 5-6 vs 0-1 points had a 68% decreased risk of lethal prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.19 to 0.52) in HPFS and a non-statistically significant 38% decreased risk (HR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.30 to 1.26) in PHS. For dietary factors only, men with 3 vs 0 points had a 46% decreased risk (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.96) in the HPFS and a non-statistically significant 30% decreased risk (HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.40 to 1.23) in PHS.

We report our 5-years outcomes in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (T1-T4N0-N1M0) treated with definitive radiotherapy encompassing the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes (intensity modulated radiotherapy, IMRT) and long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Material and methods:   Of the 138 consecutive eligible men all living patients have been followed up to almost 5 years. Survival endpoints for 5-year biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression proportional hazards models were constructed for all survival endpoints. The RTOG morbidity grading system for physician rated toxicity was applied.  Results:   Patients with locally advanced T3-T4 tumors (35 %) and N1 (51 %) have favorable outcome when long-term ADT is combined with definitive radiotherapy encompassing pelvic lymph nodes. The 5-year BFFS, RFS, PCSS and OS were 71.4, 76.2, 94.5 and 89.0 %, respectively. High Gleason sum (9-10) had a strong independent prognostic impact on BFFS, RFS and OS (p = 0.001, <0.001, and 0.005 respectively). The duration of ADT (= > 28 months) showed a significant independent association with improved PCSS (p = 0.02) and OS (p = 0.001). Lymph node involvement was not associated with survival endpoints in the multivariate analysis. The radiotherapy induced toxicity seen in our study population was moderate with rare Grade 3 GI side effects and up to 11 % for Grade 3 GU consisting mainly of urgency and frequency.

A cohort study was performed on primary care data from the QResearch database, including patients with breast, bowel or prostate cancer. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compare the survival from cancer diagnosis of patients taking VGSC-inhibiting drugs with those not exposed to these drugs. Median time to death was 9.7 years in the exposed group and 18.4 years in the unexposed group, and exposure to these medications significantly increased mortality. Thus, exposure to VGSC-inhibiting drugs associates with reduced survival in breast, bowel and prostate cancer patients. This finding is not consistent with the preclinical data. Despite the strengths of this study including the large sample size, the study is limited by missing information on potentially important confounders such as cancer stage, co-morbidities and cause of death.

Based on the hypothesis that PSMA expression can be modulated by variations in androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), we investigated the binding of a PSMA-directed radiopharmaceutical in vitro in order to get an insight of the interactions between altered premedication and PSMA expression before repetitive PSMA-directed PET/CT for therapy response and targeted therapy implementation.  Methods:   The human castration-resistant PCa cell line VCaP (CRPC) was treated with either 1 nmol/L testosterone (T) over 20 passages yielding the androgen-sensitive cell line (revCRPC) or with 5 μmol/L abiraterone acetate (AA) generating the abiraterone-tolerant subtype CRPCAA. In these cell lines, T and AA were varied by either supply or withdrawal of T and AA. PSMA expression of the three cell culture models was detected by Western blot and immunohistochemical staining. For quantitative measurement of tracer uptake, 0.3 nmol/L (68)Ga-labelled PSMA-HBED-CC peptide (100-300 kBq/ml) was added to different treated parallel cultures (n = 9 each). Time-dependent uptake per 10(6) cells of each culture was calculated and evaluated. PSMA mRNA expression was investigated by qPCR.  Results:   PSMA expression increased dependently on intensified ADT in all three basic cell lines. (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC uptake almost doubled during 3 h in all cell lines (p < 0.01). Compared to the basic cells, pre-incubation with abiraterone for 48 h resulted in a significant increased uptake in CRPC (p < 0.001). In revCRPC, 48-h AA pre-incubation resulted in an eightfold higher uptake after 3 h (p < 0.001). Additional withdrawal of external testosterone increased the uptake up to tenfold (p < 0.01). The increase of PSMA expression upon ADT and AA treatments was confirmed by qPCR and Western blot data. Furthermore, in CRPCAA, 48-h AA withdrawal increased the uptake up to fivefold (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   The investigated three PCa cell culture subtypes represent a serial preclinical model of androgen deprivation therapy as a proxy for clinical situations with differing basal PSMA expression. The uptake of PSMA-binding tracers could be stimulated by therapeutic effective short-term variation in premedication in all stages of ADT response. These complex interactions have to be considered in the interpretation of diagnostic imaging using PSMA ligands as well as in the optimal timing of PSMA-based therapies.""","""['B Meller', 'F Bremmer', 'C O Sahlmann', 'S Hijazi', 'C Bouter', 'L Trojan', 'J Meller', 'P Thelen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Follow-Up of Patients with Prostate Cancer with Bone Metastases Who Had Reduced Bone Density after Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Simultaneous 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET/MRI Improves the Localization of Primary Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Novel radionuclide therapy combinations in prostate cancer.', 'The significance of metabolic response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy detected with 68GaGa-PSMA-11-PET/CT in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy.', 'Up-Regulation of PSMA Expression In Vitro as Potential Application in Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Inceptor correlates with markers of prostate cancer progression and modulates insulin/IGF1 signaling and cancer cell migration.', '18F-DCFPyL (PSMA) PET as a radiotherapy response assessment tool in metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of our study was to identify risk factors for PSM in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   A clinical database of all patients that underwent a RARP at our institution was used. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted on the PSM rates for all patients with organ-confined PCa.  Results:   Altogether, 1,600 patients were identified, including 1,085 organ-confined PCa with a PSM rate of 7.8%.

In a subgroup of patients undergoing a nerve-sparing RARP, the quality of the prostate biopsy (OR 2.398, 95% CI 1.325-4.341) was the sole independent risk factor for a PSM.  Conclusion:   An elevated preoperative PSA, surgical experience and a nerve-sparing procedure are all significantly associated with a higher risk for a PSM after RARP.

We have previously demonstrated that in prostate cancer cell lines PDE4D7 is downregulated in advanced cases of the disease. To investigate further the prognostic power of PDE4D7 expression during prostate cancer progression and assess how downregulation of this PDE isoform may affect disease outcome, we have examined PDE4D7 expression in physiologically relevant primary human samples.  Methods:   About 1405 patient samples across 8 publically available qPCR, Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST arrays and RNA sequencing data sets were screened for PDE4D7 expression. The TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement status of patient samples was determined by transformation of the exon array and RNA seq expression data to robust z-scores followed by the application of a threshold>3 to define a positive TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion event in a tumour sample.  Results:   We demonstrate that PDE4D7 expression positively correlates with primary tumour development. We also show a positive association with the highly prostate cancer-specific gene rearrangement between TMPRSS2 and the ETS transcription factor family member ERG. In addition, we find that in primary TMPRSS2-ERG-positive tumours PDE4D7 expression is significantly positively correlated with low-grade disease and a reduced likelihood of progression after primary treatment. Conversely, PDE4D7 transcript levels become significantly decreased in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Conclusions:   We further characterise and add physiological relevance to PDE4D7 as a novel marker that is associated with the development and progression of prostate tumours. We propose that the assessment of PDE4D7 levels may provide a novel, independent predictor of post-surgical disease progression.""","""['R Böttcher', 'D J P Henderson', 'K Dulla', 'D van Strijp', 'L F Waanders', 'G Tevz', 'M L Lehman', 'D Merkle', 'G J L H van Leenders', 'G S Baillie', 'G Jenster', 'M D Houslay', 'R Hoffmann']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""[""The Association of the Long Prostate Cancer Expressed PDE4D Transcripts to Poor Patient Outcome Depends on the Tumour's TMPRSS2-ERG Fusion Status."", 'The cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7) is downregulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and mediates proliferation by compartmentalising cAMP at the plasma membrane of VCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Creating a potential diagnostic for prostate cancer risk stratification (InformMDx™) by translating novel scientific discoveries concerning cAMP degrading phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7).', 'Validation of Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate Phosphodiesterase-4D7 for its Independent Contribution to Risk Stratification in a Prostate Cancer Patient Cohort with Longitudinal Biological Outcomes.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'The CAPRA&PDE4D5/7/9 Prognostic Model Is Significantly Associated with Adverse Post-Surgical Pathology Outcomes.', ""Therapeutic targeting of 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases: inhibition and beyond."", ""The Association of the Long Prostate Cancer Expressed PDE4D Transcripts to Poor Patient Outcome Depends on the Tumour's TMPRSS2-ERG Fusion Status."", 'Inhibition of TPL2 by interferon-α suppresses bladder cancer through activation of PDE4D.', 'Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying postoperative recurrence in prostate cancer by gene expression profiling.']"""

It is unknown whether incidence has changed since the USPSTF recommendation against screening for all men in May 2012.  Objective:   To examine recent changes in stage-specific prostate cancer incidence and PSA screening rates following the 2008 and 2012 USPSTF recommendations.  Design and settings:   Ecologic study of age-standardized prostate cancer incidence (newly diagnosed cases/100,000 men aged ≥50 years) by stage from 2005 through 2012 using data from 18 population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries and PSA screening rate in the past year among men 50 years and older without a history of prostate cancer who responded to the 2005 (n = 4580), 2008 (n = 3476), 2010 (n = 4157), and 2013 (n = 6172) National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).  Exposures:   The USPSTF recommendations to omit PSA-based screening for average-risk men.  Main outcomes and measures:   Prostate cancer incidence and incidence ratios (IRs) comparing consecutive years from 2005 through 2012 by age (≥50, 50-74, and ≥75 years) and SEER summary stage categorized as local/regional or distant and PSA screening rate and rate ratios (SRRs) comparing successive survey years by age.  Results:   Prostate cancer incidence per 100,000 in men 50 years and older (N = 446,009 in SEER areas) was 534.9 in 2005, 540.8 in 2008, 505.0 in 2010, and 416.2 in 2012; rates began decreasing in 2008 and the largest decrease occurred between 2011 and 2012, from 498.3 (99% CI, 492.8-503.9) to 416.2 (99% CI, 411.2-421.2). The number of men 50 years and older diagnosed with prostate cancer nationwide declined by 33,519, from 213,562 men in 2011 to 180,043 men in 2012. Declines in incidence since 2008 were confined to local/regional-stage disease and were similar across age and race/ethnicity groups. The percentage of men 50 years and older reporting PSA screening in the past 12 months was 36.9% in 2005, 40.6% in 2008, 37.8% in 2010, and 30.8% in 2013. In relative terms, screening rates increased by 10% (SRR, 1.10; 99% CI, 1.01-1.21) between 2005 and 2008 and then decreased by 18% (SRR, 0.82; 99% CI, 0.75-0.89) between 2010 and 2013. Similar screening patterns were found in age subgroups 50 to 74 years and 75 years and older.  Conclusions and relevance:   Both the incidence of early-stage prostate cancer and rates of PSA screening have declined and coincide with 2012 USPSTF recommendation to omit PSA screening from routine primary care for men.

We hypothesized that molecular similarity between CTCs and tissue exists at the single cell level when characterized by whole genome sequencing (WGS). By combining the NanoVelcro CTC Chip with laser capture microdissection (LCM), we developed a platform for single-CTC WGS. We performed this procedure on CTCs and tissue samples from a patient with advanced prostate cancer who had serial biopsies over the course of his clinical history. We achieved 30X depth and ≥ 95% coverage. Twenty-nine percent of the somatic single nucleotide variations (SSNVs) identified were founder mutations that were also identified in CTCs. In addition, 86% of the clonal mutations identified in CTCs could be traced back to either the primary or metastatic tumors. In this patient, we identified structural variations (SVs) including an intrachromosomal rearrangement in chr3 and an interchromosomal rearrangement between chr13 and chr15. These rearrangements were shared between tumor tissues and CTCs. At the same time, highly heterogeneous short structural variants were discovered in PTEN, RB1, and BRCA2 in all tumor and CTC samples. Using high-quality WGS on single-CTCs, we identified the shared genomic alterations between CTCs and tumor tissues. This approach yielded insight into the heterogeneity of the mutational landscape of SSNVs and SVs. It may be possible to use this approach to study heterogeneity and characterize the biological evolution of a cancer during the course of its natural history.""","""['Runze Jiang', 'Yi-Tsung Lu', 'Hao Ho', 'Bo Li', 'Jie-Fu Chen', 'Millicent Lin', 'Fuqiang Li', 'Kui Wu', 'Hanjie Wu', 'Jake Lichterman', 'Haolei Wan', 'Chia-Lun Lu', 'William OuYang', 'Ming Ni', 'Linlin Wang', 'Guibo Li', 'Tom Lee', 'Xiuqing Zhang', 'Jonathan Yang', 'Matthew Rettig', 'Leland W K Chung', 'Huanming Yang', 'Ker-Chau Li', 'Yong Hou', 'Hsian-Rong Tseng', 'Shuang Hou', 'Xun Xu', 'Jun Wang', 'Edwin M Posadas']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Genomic Analysis of Localized High-Risk Prostate Cancer Circulating Tumor Cells at the Single-Cell Level.', 'Isolation and genome sequencing of individual circulating tumor cells using hydrogel encapsulation and laser capture microdissection.', 'An Accessible and Unique Insight into Metastasis Mutational Content Through Whole-exome Sequencing of Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Nanostructure embedded microchips for detection, isolation, and characterization of circulating tumor cells.', 'NanoVelcro rare-cell assays for detection and characterization of circulating tumor cells.', 'Single-Cell Sequencing and Its Applications in Liver Cancer.', 'Liquid biopsy at the frontier of detection, prognosis and progression monitoring in colorectal cancer.', 'Deconstructing Pancreatic Cancer Using Next Generation-Omic Technologies-From Discovery to Knowledge-Guided Platforms for Better Patient Management.', 'Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs) in NSCLC: From Prognosis to Therapy Design.', 'Single Cell Genomics for Tumor Heterogeneity.']"""

We have discovered a novel role of ERα in the pathogenesis of prostate tumors. Here, we show that prostate cancer cells express ERα and estrogen induces oncogenic properties in prostate cancer cells through ERα. Importantly, ERα knockdown in the human prostate cancer PacMetUT1 cells as well as pharmacological inhibition of ERα with ICI 182,780 inhibited osteoblastic lesion formation and lung metastasis in vivo. Co-culture of pre-osteoblasts with cancer cells showed a significant induction of osteogenic markers in the pre-osteoblasts, which was attenuated by knockdown of ERα in cancer cells suggesting that estrogen/ERα signaling promotes crosstalk between cancer and osteoblastic progenitors to stimulate osteoblastic tumorigenesis. These results suggest that ERα expression in prostate cancer cells is essential for osteoblastic lesion formation and lung metastasis. Thus, inhibition of ERα signaling in prostate cancer cells may be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit the osteoblastic lesion development as well as lung metastasis in patients with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Sweta Mishra', 'Qin Tai', 'Xiang Gu', 'James Schmitz', 'Ashley Poullard', 'Roberto J Fajardo', 'Devalingam Mahalingam', 'Xiaodong Chen', 'Xueqiong Zhu', 'Lu-Zhe Sun']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Activation of Estrogen Receptor Alpha by Decitabine Inhibits Osteosarcoma Growth and Metastasis.', 'Blockade of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling inhibits osteoblastic tumorigenesis by a novel human prostate cancer cell line.', 'Influence of BMPs on the formation of osteoblastic lesions in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Clinical significance of estrogen receptor β in breast and prostate cancer from biological aspects.', 'Estrogen receptor signaling in prostate cancer: Implications for carcinogenesis and tumor progression.', 'Estrogen and the Vascular Endothelium: The Unanswered Questions.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'Oestrogen-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in endometriosis: Aetiology of vaginal agenesis in Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.', 'Estrogen receptor 1 inhibits the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma via positively regulating lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 under high glucose conditions.', 'Identification of Hub Genes Associated With the Development of Stomach Adenocarcinoma by Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.']"""

Patients and methods:   This is a prospective cohort of patients with prostate cancer who had RP (1117 ORP and 885 RARP) between January 2009 and June 2012. The oncological outcomes of interest were: positive surgical margin (PSM) and biochemical recurrence (BCR), defined as postoperative PSA level of >0.2 ng/mL. The HRQOL outcomes were: sexual and urinary bother, assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite at 1- and 2-years after diagnosis. For univariate comparison of continuous variables the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test were used, and the Pearson's chi-squared test was used for categorical variables. Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple testing, with a threshold for significance of P < 0.003 for univariate analyses. The inverse-probability-treatment-weighting (IPTW) approach was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics between ORP and RARP patients [including age, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categories, hospitals, and year of RP] in all multivariate analyses. Logistic regressions were used to analyse for PSM, Cox regressions for BCR, and ordinal logistic regressions for HRQOL outcomes. All multivariate analyses also adjusted for surgeons' average annual caseload, and employed the robust standard errors for clustering by surgeon.  Results:   ORP and RARP patients were followed for a median of 19 and 17 months, respectively. The proportion of patients with NCCN low-risk prostate cancer was significantly higher among RARP patients (21% vs 26%; P = 0.002). Most RPs was done in private hospitals (77% ORP, and 85% RARP, P < 0.001). A higher proportion of RARP patients were operated by surgeons with higher annual caseloads (65% RARP and 53% ORP operated by surgeons with >20 case/year; P < 0.001). In the IPTW-adjusted multivariate analyses, RARP patients had a lower risk of PSM (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.81), and BCR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.99). In the sensitivity analyses (excluding public hospital patients), the lower PSM risk with RARP remained (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.38-0.81), but the lower BCR risk with RARP was no longer statistically significant (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.12). At 1-year follow-up, 61% of ORP and 59% of RARP patients reported 'moderate-big' sexual bother (P = 0.2), while 14% of ORP and 11% of RARP patients reported 'moderate-big' urinary bother (P = 0.08). The sexual and urinary bothers at 2 years were similar between ORP and RARP. In multivariate analyses, there were no statistically significant differences in the HRQOL outcomes between ORP and RARP.  Conclusions:   We report on a large population-based comparative study of ORP and RARP with better short-term oncological outcomes favouring RARP, but no significant differences in HRQOL outcomes.

Neither sotalol (HR 0.97 95% CI 0.76-1.24) nor digoxin (HR 1.01 95% CI 0.87-1.16) users had a decreased risk of prostate cancer. Similar results were obtained for high-grade (Gleason 7-10) and metastatic prostate cancer. Nevertheless, the risk estimates for Gleason 7-10 prostate cancer tended to decrease by duration of digoxin use (p for trend = 0.052), suggesting that the drug may reduce the risk in long-term usage (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49-1.03). In analysis stratified by screening trial arm, the protective association against Gleason 7-10 disease was observed only in the screening arm (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12-0.84 for men who had used digoxin for 5 years or longer).  Conclusion:   Digoxin or other antiarrhythmic drugs are not associated with any clear decrease in prostate cancer risk. However, digoxin might have a benefit in long-term use by reducing risk of high-grade disease. Further research will be needed to evaluate possible effects on prostate cancer survival.""","""['K J Kaapu', 'T J Murtola', 'L Määttänen', 'K Talala', 'K Taari', 'T L J Tammela', 'A Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Cancer mortality does not differ by antiarrhythmic drug use: A population-based cohort of Finnish men.', 'Sotalol, but not digoxin is associated with decreased prostate cancer risk: A population-based case-control study.', 'Digoxin and prostate cancer survival in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Pharmacologic management of supraventricular tachycardias in children.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the effect of a 2-year home-based endurance training intervention on body composition, biomarkers levels, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time as a surrogate end-point for progressing disease.  Methods:   Out-clinic patients with either biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy or patients managed on active surveillance were randomized to either 24 months (3 times/week) of home-based endurance training or usual care. Aerobic fitness, body composition, insulin sensitivity, and biomarkers were measured at 0, 6, and 24 months of intervention. PSA doubling time (PSADT) was calculated based on monthly PSA measurements.  Results:   Twenty-five patients were enrolled, and 19 patients completed the study. PSADT increased in the training group from 28 to 76 months (p < 0.05) during the first 6 months and was correlated with changes in VO2max (p < 0.01, r (2) = 0.41). The training group lost 3.6 ± 1.0 kg (p < 0.05) exclusively as fat mass, yet the changes in body composition were not associated with the increased PSADT. The training group showed significant improvements in plasma triglycerides, adiponectin, IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and fasting glucose levels, but no changes in insulin sensitivity (measured as Matsuda index), testosterone, cholesterols, fasting insulin, plasma TNF-alpha, IL-6, or leptin levels. The control group showed no changes in any of the evaluated parameters across the 2-year intervention.  Conclusion:   In this small randomized controlled trial, we found that improvements in fitness levels correlated with increasing PSADT, suggesting a link between training and disease progression.""","""['Thine Hvid', 'Birgitte Lindegaard', 'Kamilla Winding', 'Peter Iversen', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Thomas P J Solomon', 'Bente K Pedersen', 'Pernille Hojman']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['PSA doubling time as a predictor of clinical progression after biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Endurance training improves insulin sensitivity and body composition in prostate cancer patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Influence of trigger PSA and PSA kinetics on 11C-Choline PET/CT detection rate in patients with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy.', 'PSA and follow-up after treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Effects of Exercise on Insulin, IGF Axis, Adipocytokines, and Inflammatory Markers in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Feasibility of home-based exercise training during adjuvant treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (EXACT).', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'Behavioral factors to modulate immunotherapy efficacy in cancer.', 'The Impact of Exercise on Improving Body Composition and PSA in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients on Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Effect of high-intensity interval training on aerobic capacity and fatigue among patients with prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.']"""

Notably, miR-124 could restore the apoptotic response of cells resistant to enzalutamide, a drug approved for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We used xenograft models to examine the effects of miR-124 in vivo when complexed with polyethylenimine-derived nanoparticles. Intravenous delivery of miR-124 was sufficient to inhibit tumor growth and to increase tumor cell apoptosis in combination with enzalutamide. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-124 directly downregulated AR splice variants AR-V4 and V7 along with EZH2 and Src, oncogenic targets that have been reported to contribute to prostate cancer progression and treatment resistance.

Nearly all patients with disseminated prostate cancer initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but virtually all patients will relapse and develop incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). A high-throughput RNAi screen to identify signaling pathways regulating prostate cancer cell growth led to our discovery that checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) knockdown dramatically increased prostate cancer growth and hypersensitized cells to low androgen levels. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the effects of CHK2 were dependent on the downstream signaling proteins CDC25C and CDK1. Moreover, CHK2 depletion increased androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity on androgen-regulated genes, substantiating the finding that CHK2 affects prostate cancer proliferation, partly, through the AR. Remarkably, we further show that CHK2 is a novel AR-repressed gene, suggestive of a negative feedback loop between CHK2 and AR. In addition, we provide evidence that CHK2 physically associates with the AR and that cell-cycle inhibition increased this association. Finally, IHC analysis of CHK2 in prostate cancer patient samples demonstrated a decrease in CHK2 expression in high-grade tumors. In conclusion, we propose that CHK2 is a negative regulator of androgen sensitivity and prostate cancer growth, and that CHK2 signaling is lost during prostate cancer progression to castration resistance. Thus, perturbing CHK2 signaling may offer a new therapeutic approach for sensitizing CRPC to ADT and radiation.""","""['Huy Q Ta', 'Melissa L Ivey', 'Henry F Frierson Jr', 'Mark R Conaway', 'Jaroslaw Dziegielewski', 'James M Larner', 'Daniel Gioeli']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'PDCD4 Is an Androgen-Repressed Tumor Suppressor that Regulates Prostate Cancer Growth and Castration Resistance.', 'Transcription of Nrdp1 by the androgen receptor is regulated by nuclear filamin A in prostate cancer.', 'ILP-2: A New Bane and Therapeutic Target for Human Cancers.', 'Emerging Proteins in CRPC: Functional Roles and Clinical Implications.', 'The Role of E3 Ligase Pirh2 in Disease.', 'Androgen receptor negatively regulates mitotic checkpoint signaling to induce docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint Kinase and Drug Resistance of Lung Cancer.']"""

However, the mechanisms supporting DTC survival are poorly understood. DTC extravasation into the bone marrow may be encouraged by low oxygen concentrations that trigger metabolic and molecular alterations contributing to DTC survival. Here, we investigated how the unfolded protein response (UPR), an important cytoprotective program induced by hypoxia, affects the behavior of stressed cancer cells. DTC cell lines established from the bone marrow of patients with breast cancer (BC-M1), lung cancer, (LC-M1), and prostate cancer (PC-E1) were subjected to hypoxic and hypoglycemic conditions. BC-M1 and LC-M1 exhibiting mesenchymal and epithelial properties adapted readily to hypoxia and glucose starvation. Upregulation of UPR proteins, such as the glucose-regulated protein Grp78, induced the formation of filamentous networks, resulting in proliferative advantages and sustained survival under total glucose deprivation. High Grp78 expression correlated with mesenchymal attributes of breast and lung cancer cells and with poor differentiation in clinical samples of primary breast and lung carcinomas. In DTCs isolated from bone marrow specimens from breast cancer patients, Grp78-positive stress granules were observed, consistent with the likelihood these cells were exposed to acute cell stress. Overall, our findings provide the first evidence that the UPR is activated in DTC in the bone marrow from cancer patients, warranting further study of this cell stress pathway as a predictive biomarker for recurrent metastatic disease.""","""['Kai Bartkowiak', 'Marcel Kwiatkowski', 'Friedrich Buck', 'Tobias M Gorges', 'Lars Nilse', 'Volker Assmann', 'Antje Andreas', 'Volkmar Müller', 'Harriet Wikman', 'Sabine Riethdorf', 'Hartmut Schlüter', 'Klaus Pantel']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Discovery of a novel unfolded protein response phenotype of cancer stem/progenitor cells from the bone marrow of breast cancer patients.', 'Most early disseminated cancer cells detected in bone marrow of breast cancer patients have a putative breast cancer stem cell phenotype.', 'Prognostic relevance of disseminated tumour cells from the bone marrow of early stage breast cancer patients - results from a large single-centre analysis.', 'Review: Biological relevance of disseminated tumor cells in cancer patients.', 'Hypoxia-mediated changes in bone marrow microenvironment in breast cancer dormancy.', 'Inhibition of protein translation under matrix-deprivation stress in breast cancer cells.', 'Cellular Dormancy in Cancer: Mechanisms and Potential Targeting Strategies.', 'Proteome Coverage after Simultaneous Proteo-Metabolome Liquid-Liquid Extraction.', 'Autophagy, molecular chaperones, and unfolded protein response as promoters of tumor recurrence.', 'The Clinicopathological Significance of BiP/GRP-78 in Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Public Datasets and Immunohistochemical Detection.']"""

Discussion:   An association between exceeding the minimum number of operations and quality assurance exists, if at all, only vaguely and on no account justifies the absolute numbers necessary for certification. Although good measuring instruments for a Pentafecta analysis are available, the gathering of quality results for a center are limited to questionnaires for functional quality results and in the non-differentiated request for a pT2R1 rate of under 10 % for oncological quality results.  Conclusions:   The reasons for this systematic ignoring of the for the patient so important quality results with a simultaneous excessive regard for standardizing organizational procedure processes are manifold. They comprise valid verifiability of process quality, the unclear effects of standardized treatment pathways on actual operation quality and the capitulation to statistical and patient determined problems with sufficient acquisition of comparable functional OP results.

The mean number of primary cases per year was 159 (range 101-2089), whereby the minimum number of > 100 had been reached by all centers. The median number of radical prostatectomies decreased to 84 (range 35-2145); 6 of 88 centers did not fulfill the minimum number of 50 radical prostatectomies per year. Concerning radiotherapy or brachytherapy no minimal requirements exist.  Results:   The number of operative revisions and wound infections including drainage of lymphoceles following radical prostatectomies and the relative number of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomies in low-risk patients with an IIEF > 22 are described.

Preliminary data further indicate that immunohistochemically detected PD-L1 may be predictive for anti-PD-1 therapy. So far, no data are available on PD-L1 expression in primary prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   Following validation of a monoclonal antibody, immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 expression was performed in two independent, well-characterized cohorts of primary prostate cancer patients following radical prostatectomy (RP), and resulting data were correlated to clinicopathological parameters and outcome.  Results:   In the training cohort (n= 209), 52.2% of cases expressed moderate to high PD-L1 levels, which positively correlated with proliferation (Ki-67,P< 0.001), Gleason score (P= 0.004), and androgen receptor (AR) expression (P< 0.001). Furthermore, PD-L1 positivity was prognostic for biochemical recurrence [BCR;P= 0.004; HR, 2.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-4.25]. In the test cohort (n= 611), moderate to high PD-L1 expression was detected in 61.7% and remained prognostic for BCR in univariate Cox analysis (P= 0.011; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.10-2.02). The correlation of Ki-67 and AR with PD-L1 expression was confirmed in the test cohort (P< 0.001). In multivariate Cox analysis of all patients, PD-L1 was corroborated as independently prognostic for BCR (P= 0.007; HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.11-1.92).  Conclusions:   We provide first evidence that expression of the therapy target PD-L1 is not only highly prevalent in primary prostate cancer cells but is also an independent indicator of BCR, suggesting a biologic relevance in primary tumors. Further studies need to ascertain if PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapy might be a treatment option for hormone-naïve prostate cancers.""","""['Heidrun Gevensleben', 'Dimo Dietrich', 'Carsten Golletz', 'Susanne Steiner', 'Maria Jung', 'Thore Thiesler', 'Michael Majores', 'Johannes Stein', 'Barbara Uhl', 'Stefan Müller', 'Jörg Ellinger', 'Carsten Stephan', 'Klaus Jung', 'Peter Brossart', 'Glen Kristiansen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: PD-L1 expression is common and indicates poor prognosis.', 'The prognostic role of immune checkpoint markers programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in a large, multicenter prostate cancer cohort.', 'PD-L1 promoter methylation is a prognostic biomarker for biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients following radical prostatectomy.', 'Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Expression Is Associated with a Better Prognosis and Diabetic Disease in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients.', 'The prognostic value of PD-L1 expression for non-small cell lung cancer patients: a meta-analysis.', 'Predictive biomarkers for programmed death-1/programmed death ligand immune checkpoint inhibitors in nonsmall cell lung cancer.', 'Potential of Personalized Dendritic Cell-Based Immunohybridoma Vaccines to Treat Prostate Cancer.', 'DNA Damage Repair Pathways in Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review of Molecular Mechanisms, Emerging Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Precision Oncology.', 'Immunogenomic profiles associated with response to life-prolonging agents in prostate cancer.', 'PD-L1, CD4+, and CD8+ Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) Expression Profiles in Melanoma Tumor Microenvironment Cells.', 'Prevalence of tumour-infiltrating CD103+ cells identifies therapeutic-sensitive prostate cancer with poor clinical outcome.']"""

We evaluated the efficacy of 32-week football training on bone mineral density (BMD) and physical functioning in men undergoing ADT for PCa. Football training improved the femoral shaft and total hip BMD and physical functioning parameters compared to control.  Introduction:   ADT is a mainstay in PCa management. Side effects include decreased bone and muscle strength and increased fracture rates. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of 32 weeks of football training on BMD, bone turnover markers (BTMs), body composition, and physical functioning in men with PCa undergoing ADT.  Methods:   Men receiving ADT >6 months (n = 57) were randomly allocated to a football training group (FTG) (n = 29) practising 2-3 times per week for 45-60 min or to a standard care control group (CON) (n = 28) for 32 weeks. Outcomes were total hip, femoral shaft, femoral neck and lumbar spine (L2-L4) BMD and systemic BTMs (procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide, osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen). Additionally, physical functioning (postural balance, jump height, repeated chair rise, stair climbing) was evaluated.  Results:   Thirty-two-week follow-up measures were obtained for FTG (n = 21) and for CON (n = 20), respectively. Analysis of mean changes from baseline to 32 weeks showed significant differences between FTG and CON in right (0.015 g/cm(2)) and left (0.017 g/cm(2)) total hip and in right (0.018 g/cm(2)) and left (0.024 g/cm(2)) femoral shaft BMD, jump height (1.7 cm) and stair climbing (-0.21 s) all in favour of FTG (p < 0.05).

Therefore, understanding how ARs regulate the human transcriptome is of paramount importance. The early effects of castration on human PCa have not previously been studied 27 patients medically castrated with degarelix 7 d before radical prostatectomy. We used mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression array (validated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) to compare resected tumour with matched, controlled, untreated PCa tissue. All patients had levels of serum androgen, with reduced levels of intraprostatic androgen at prostatectomy. We observed differential expression of known androgen-regulated genes (TMPRSS2, KLK3, CAMKK2, FKBP5). We identified 749 genes downregulated and 908 genes upregulated following castration. AR regulation of α-methylacyl-CoA racemase expression and three other genes (FAM129A, RAB27A, and KIAA0101) was confirmed. Upregulation of oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) expression was observed in malignant epithelia and was associated with differential expression of ESR1-regulated genes and correlated with proliferation (Ki-67 expression).  Patient summary:   This first-in-man study defines the rapid gene expression changes taking place in prostate cancer (PCa) following castration.

Objective:   To examine rates of complications other than urinary incontinence and impotence for older patients treated for PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Population-based retrospective cohort study of patients aged 65-79 yr receiving radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy (RT) from 2001 to 2008 in the US Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results and Medicare linked databases.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   Complications were organised in three categories: urologic procedures, rectal-anal procedures, and major surgeries. We analysed the role of primary treatment on the number of complications using negative binomial regression.  Results and limitations:   Among 60476 men, 14492 underwent primary surgery and 45984 underwent primary RT; 33418 (55%) experienced at least one complication (mean: 2.6 complications per patient). For both groups, complications peaked within 2 yr of treatment but continued at a steady rate for 10 yr. Patients treated with radiation had higher rates of urologic procedures (adjusted relative rate [aRR]: 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.3; p<0.0001) and rectal-anal procedures (aRR: 1.4; 95% CI, 1.4-1.5; p<0.0001) but a lower rate of major surgeries (aRR: 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9; p<0.0001) compared with those having surgery. Because patients treated with RT were older and more comorbid, selection bias limits the strength of conclusions that can be drawn from this data.  Conclusions:   Complications are common following PCa cancer treatment and occur many years after treatment. The primary treatment is an important predictor of complication rates that may inform treatment decisions and long-term survivorship plans.  Patient summary:   We examined complications after prostate cancer treatment in a large American population. Patients treated with radiotherapy rather than surgery had higher rates of complications requiring urologic procedures and rectal-anal procedures but lower rates of open surgeries. However, we were only able to examine men aged >65 yr, and this, along with the observational study technique, means that these results may not apply to all patients and that factors beyond those that we could measure may have affected these results.""","""['Christopher J D Wallis', 'Alyson Mahar', 'Patrick Cheung', 'Sender Herschorn', 'Laurence H Klotz', 'Ashraf Al-Matar', 'Girish S Kulkarni', 'Yuna Lee', 'Ronald T Kodama', 'Steven A Narod', 'Robert K Nam']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Incidence of complications other than urinary incontinence or erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a population-based cohort study.', 'Hospitalizations to Manage Complications of Modern Prostate Cancer Treatment in Older Men.', 'External Beam Radiotherapy Increases the Risk of Bladder Cancer When Compared with Radical Prostatectomy in Patients Affected by Prostate Cancer: A Population-based Analysis.', 'Survival and Complications Following Surgery and Radiation for Localized Prostate Cancer: An International Collaborative Review.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Association between Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer and Mental Health Outcomes.', 'Sustainable functional urethral reconstruction: Maximizing early continence recovery in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The scope, presentation, and management of genitourinary complications in patients presenting with high-grade urethral complications after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Longitudinal Comparison of Patient-Level Outcomes and Costs Across Prostate Cancer Treatments With Urinary Problems.', 'The cost of treatment and its related complications for men who receive surgery or radiation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Following surgery, sexually active patients who had undergone either RARP or ORP prospectively completed a 28-item questionnaire including sensitive issues regarding sexual function (eg, climacturia and PO). Rates of postoperative climacturia and PO were compared for RARP and ORP patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to assess estimated rates of recovery from either climacturia or PO after both procedures. Cox regression models tested predictors of recovery from those conditions. Overall, 221 (29.5%) of 749 patients reported climacturia, without differences between RARP and ORP. Conversely, PO was significantly more frequently reported after ORP than after RARP (46 [11.6%] vs 25 [7.1%] patients, respectively; p=0.04). At Kaplan-Meier analysis, recovery from climacturia over time was faster and greater after RARP than after ORP (8.5% vs 5%, respectively, at 24-mo assessment and 48% vs 15%, respectively, at 84-mo assessment; p<0.01). Conversely, no differences were found between groups in terms of postoperative recovery from PO. At multivariable analysis, only RARP achieved independent predictor status for recovery from climacturia after adjusting for other functional outcomes. Conversely, no variables were significantly associated with recovery from postoperative PO.

Materials and methods:   A total of 122 cases with indications of PCa were randomly allocated into two groups for this randomized controlled study. TRUSPB was performed randomly using either an 18G or 20G needle for core biopsies (62 cases with 18G and 60 cases with 20G). Detection rate, pain, and complications were assessed after the procedure.  Results:   The cancer detection rate in the 18G group (40.3%) did not differ from that in the 20G group (35.0%). However, the number of patients with pain was significantly lower in 20G group (P < 0.05). The number of patients with self-limiting hematuria decreased in both groups after the biopsy procedure (18G: 38 cases; 20G: 16 cases; P < .0001). Hematochezia occurred in 11 cases (9 cases [14.5%] in the 18G group; 2 cases [3.4%] in the 20G group). The number of patients with infection, dysuria, and urinary retention tended to be lower in 20G group.

Materials and methods:   We evaluated retrospectively 512 patients in our clinic who had undergone 12 core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsies. The cores were divided into two groups: one with cancer (group 1) and one without cancer (group 2). We also classified Gleason scores as poorly differentiated (scores of 7-10) and moderately differentiated (scores of 5-6); these scores were compared with each other in terms of the core length. The core lengths of the groups were compared using a Student's t-test. A P value of less than .05 was considered to be statistically significant.  Results:   Of the 512 patients, 76 (15%) had PCa. In total, we evaluated 912 cores of prostate biopsy samples from the 76 patients. Since 92 cores included insufficient tissue and rectal mucosa, we were not able to evaluate them. The remaining 820 cores were divided into two groups. Cancer was detected in 302 cores; 518 cores were benign in nature. The average core length in group 1 was 11.9 ± 4.4 mm, and the average core length in group 2 was 11.1 ± 5.1 mm (P = .015). The core lengths of poorly differentiated and moderately differentiated cancers were similar: 12.3 ± 4.2 mm and 11.7 ± 4.5 mm, respectively (P = .25).  Conclusion:   Increasing cancer detection rates in cores may be related to core length in TRUS-guided prostate biopsies in PCa patients.""","""['Omer Gokhan Doluoglu', 'Cem Nedim Yuceturk', 'Muzaffer Eroglu', 'Berat Cem Ozgur', 'Arif Demirbas', 'Tolga Karakan', 'Selen Bozkurt', 'Berkan Resorlu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['Visually Estimated MRI Targeted Prostate Biopsy Could Improve the Detection of Significant Prostate Cancer in Patients with a PSA Level <10 ng/mL.', 'Length of prostate biopsy cores: does it impact cancer detection?', 'Free-hand transperineal targeted prostate biopsy with real-time fusion imaging of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound: single-center experience in China.', 'The Efficacy of Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Biopsy Versus Transperineal Template Biopsy of the Prostate in Diagnosing Prostate Cancer in Men with Previous Negative Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.']"""

Microtubule-associated protein MAP1S (originally named C19ORF5) is a widely-distributed homologue of neuronal-specific MAP1A and MAP1B with which autophagy marker light chain 3 (LC3) was originally co-purified. MAP1S bridges autophagic components with microtubules and mitochondria through LC3 and positively regulates autophagy flux from autophagosomal biogenesis to degradation. The MAP1S-mediated autophagy suppresses tumorigenesis as suggested in a mouse liver cancer model and in prostate cancer patients. The TGFβ signaling pathway plays a central role in pancreatic tumorigenesis, and high levels of TGFβ suggest a tumor suppressive function and predict a better survival for some patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In this study, we try to understand the relationship between TGFβ and MAP1S-mediated autophagy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.  Methods:   We collected the tumor and its adjacent normal tissues from 33 randomly selected patients of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas to test the association between TGFβ and autophagy markers MAP1S and LC3. Then we tested the cause and effect relation between TGFβ and autophagy markers in cultured pancreatic cancer cell lines.  Results:   Here we show that levels of TGFβ and autophagy markers MAP1S and LC3 are dramatically elevated in tumor tissues from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. TGFβ increases levels of MAP1S protein and enhances autophagy flux.  Conclusion:   TGFβ may suppress the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas by enhancing MAP1S-mediated autophagy.""","""['Kun Song', 'Wei Hu', 'Fei Yue', 'Jing Zou', 'Wenjiao Li', 'Qi Chen', 'Qizhi Yao', 'Weijia Sun', 'Leyuan Liu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Autophagy defects suggested by low levels of autophagy activator MAP1S and high levels of autophagy inhibitor LRPPRC predict poor prognosis of prostate cancer patients.', 'Microtubule-associated protein 1S (MAP1S) bridges autophagic components with microtubules and mitochondria to affect autophagosomal biogenesis and degradation.', 'Fast clearance of lipid droplets through MAP1S-activated autophagy suppresses clear cell renal cell carcinomas and promotes patient survival.', 'SMAD4 and the TGFβ Pathway in Patients with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Obesity, autophagy and the pathogenesis of liver and pancreatic cancers.', 'Molecular mechanisms of microRNA-216a during tumor progression.', 'Integration of TGF-β-induced Smad signaling in the insulin-induced transcriptional response in endothelial cells.', 'Overexpression of microRNA-216a inhibits autophagy by targeting regulated MAP1S in colorectal cancer.', 'Autophagy acts through TRAF3 and RELB to regulate gene expression via antagonism of SMAD proteins.', 'The TGF-β/Smad4 Signaling Pathway in Pancreatic Carcinogenesis and Its Clinical Significance.']"""

The compounds were isolated by column chromatography and identified by NMR (¹H, (13)C, HMQC, HMBC and COSY) and LC-HRMS. A cell based assay was carried out to evaluate the preliminary cytotoxic properties of the flavonoids against UVW glioma and PC-3M prostate cancer cells as well as non-tumour cell lines. The obtained results showed that acacetin, tiliroside, a mixture of acacetin + apigenin and the sulphated flavonoids 2a + 2b exhibited inhibitory activity against at least one of the cell lines tested.

Most cardiac metastases are asymptomatic; symptoms from cardiac metastasis were seen in advanced stage and many of these cases were reported to have a poor prognosis. So it is important to find asymptomatic cardiac metastasis and to start chemotherapy early in order to improve the patient's prognosis.  Case presentation:   A 73-year-old Asian man was referred to our hospital because of a right ventricular tumor. He had a history of left ureteral cancer 9 years ago. In screening echocardiography for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a low echogenic tumor was detected in his right ventricular apex, and characteristic ST segment elevation was detected in electrocardiography. An (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed abnormal uptake in his right ventricular apex tumor and prostate, and a biopsy of the prostatic tumor showed urothelial carcinoma cells. He received systemic gemcitabine, paclitaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy for the urothelial carcinoma, and the cardiac tumor size was reduced temporarily. Finally, he died of multiple organ failure 16 months after his first admission, but his survival period was relatively longer than previous reports.  Conclusions:   We experienced a case of a metastatic cardiac tumor from urothelial carcinoma. We found asymptomatic cardiac metastasis by screening echocardiography and electrocardiography.

Research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer (PC) patients' side effects has been lacking. Our primary goal was to determine the feasibility of recruiting PC patients on a clinical trial of yoga while they underwent external beam radiation therapy (RT).  Methods:   Twice-weekly yoga interventions were offered throughout the RT course (6-9 weeks). Baseline demographic information was collected. Feasibility was declared if 15 of the first 75 eligible PC patients approached (20%) were successfully accrued and completed the intervention. Additional end points included standardized assessments of fatigue, erectile dysfunction (ED), urinary incontinence (UI), and quality of life (QOL) at time points before, during, and after RT.  Results:   Between May 2013 and June 2014, 68 eligible PC patients were identified. 23 patients (34%) declined, and 45 (56%) consented to the study. 18 (40%) were voluntarily withdrawn due to treatment conflicts. Of the remaining 27, 12 (30%) participated in ≥50% of classes, and 15 (59%) were evaluable. Severity of fatigue scores demonstrated significant variability, with fatigue increasing by week 4, but then improving over the course of treatment (P = .008). ED, UI, and general QOL scores demonstrated reassuringly stable, albeit not significant trends.  Conclusions:   A structured yoga intervention of twice-weekly classes is feasible for PC patients during a 6- to 9-week course of outpatient radiotherapy. Preliminary results are promising, showing stable measurements in fatigue, sexual health, UI, and general QOL.""","""['Avital Mazar Ben-Josef', 'E Paul Wileyto', 'Jerry Chen', 'Neha Vapiwala']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['Effect of Eischens Yoga During Radiation Therapy on Prostate Cancer Patient Symptoms and Quality of Life: A Randomized Phase II Trial.', 'Prospective evaluation of the prevalence and severity of fatigue in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radical external beam radiotherapy and neoadjuvant hormone therapy.', 'Examining a therapeutic yoga program for prostate cancer survivors.', 'Effects of yoga in inflammatory bowel diseases and on frequent IBD-associated extraintestinal symptoms like fatigue and depression.', 'Mind-body medicine in integrative uro-oncology : Studies and areas of application.', 'The Interplay between Vascular Function and Sexual Health in Prostate Cancer: The Potential Benefits of Exercise Training.', 'Growth of Integrative Medicine at Leading Cancer Centers Between 2009 and 2016: A Systematic Analysis of NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center Websites.', 'Intervention for patient reported urinary symptoms in prostate cancer survivors: Systematic review.', 'Yoga Therapy in Children with Cystic Fibrosis Decreases Immediate Anxiety and Joint Pain.']"""

Improvement of radiotherapeutic efficacy may therefore require combination therapy. We have investigated the consequences of treating primary prostate epithelial cells with gamma irradiation and photodynamic therapy (PDT), both of which act through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Primary prostate epithelial cells were cultured from patient samples of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer prior to treatment with PDT or gamma irradiation. Cell viability was measured using MTT and alamar blue assay, and cell recovery by colony-forming assays. Immunofluorescence of gamma-H2AX foci was used to quantify DNA damage, and autophagy and apoptosis were assessed using Western blots. Necrosis and senescence were measured by propidium iodide staining and beta-galactosidase staining, respectively. Both PDT and gamma irradiation reduced the colony-forming ability of primary prostate epithelial cells. PDT reduced the viability of all types of cells in the cultures, including stem-like cells and more differentiated cells. PDT induced necrosis and autophagy, whereas gamma irradiation induced senescence, but neither treatment induced apoptosis.

The study was conducted based on data taken from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).

All participants were followed from the date of enrollment until ischemic stroke, death, or the end of the 5-year follow-up period. The 5-year risk of ischemic stroke in the present study was 1.7%. Ischemic stroke has a better correlation with CHADS2 (CHADS2 score = 0 to 1: 0.02%, CHADS2 score = 2 to 3: 13.9%, CHADS2 score ≥ 4: 44.4%; AUC = 0.978) than CCIS (CCIS = 0 to 1: 1.6%, CCIS = 2 to 3: 1.7%, CCIS ≥ 4: 3.8%; AUC = 0.520).

Exposure to environmental toxicants, such as inorganic arsenic (iAs), has also been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer.  Objective:   The role of iAs exposure in stromal signaling in the tumor microenvironment has been largely unexplored. Our objective was to elucidate molecular mechanisms of iAs-induced changes to stromal signaling by an enriched prostate tumor microenvironment cell population, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (ASCs).  Results:   ASC-conditioned media (CM) collected after 1 week of iAs exposure increased prostate cancer cell viability, whereas CM from ASCs that received no iAs exposure decreased cell viability. Cytokine array analysis suggested changes to cytokine signaling associated with iAs exposure. Subsequent proteomic analysis suggested a concentration-dependent alteration to the HMOX1/THBS1/TGFβ signaling pathway by iAs. These results were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, confirming a concentration-dependent increase in HMOX1 and a decrease in THBS1 expression in ASC following iAs exposure. Subsequently, we used a TGFβ pathway reporter construct to confirm a decrease in stromal TGFβ signaling in ASC following iAs exposure.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest a concentration-dependent alteration of stromal signaling: specifically, attenuation of stromal-mediated TGFβ signaling following exposure to iAs. Our results indicate iAs may enhance prostate cancer cell viability through a previously unreported stromal-based mechanism. These findings indicate that the stroma may mediate the effects of iAs in tumor progression, which may have future therapeutic implications.

Mutations in chromatin regulators often result in more stem-like cells that seed a bulk leukemic population. Inhibitors targeting these proteins represent an emerging class of therapeutics, and identifying further chromatin regulators that promote disease progression may result in additional drug targets. We identified the chromatin-modifying protein CHD8 as necessary for cell survival in a mouse model of BCR-Abl+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This disease has a poor prognosis despite treatment with kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-Abl. Although implicated as a risk factor in autism spectrum disorder and a tumor suppressor in prostate and lung cancer, the mechanism of CHD8's activity is still unclear and has never been studied in the context of hematopoietic malignancies. Here we demonstrate that depletion of CHD8 in B-ALL cells leads to cell death. While multiple B cell malignancies were dependent on CHD8 expression for survival, T cell malignancies displayed milder phenotypes upon CHD8 knockdown. In addition, ectopic expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain in a T cell malignancy partially alleviated the detrimental effect of CHD8 depletion. Our results demonstrate that CHD8 has a context-dependent role in cell survival, and its inhibition may be an effective treatment for B lymphoid malignancies.""","""['Jennifer R Shingleton', 'Michael T Hemann']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Overexpression/enhanced kinase activity of BCR/ABL and altered expression of Notch1 induced acute leukemia in p210BCR/ABL transgenic mice.', 'The signaling axis atypical protein kinase C λ/ι-Satb2 mediates leukemic transformation of B-cell progenitors.', 'Adaptive Immunity to Leukemia Is Inhibited by Cross-Reactive Induced Regulatory T Cells.', 'The ARF tumor suppressor in acute leukemias: insights from mouse models of Bcr-Abl-induced acute lymphoblastic leukemia.', 'Leukemia cell lines: in vitro models for the study of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia.', 'Autism-associated CHD8 keeps proliferation of human neural progenitors in check by lengthening the G1 phase of the cell cycle.', 'Role of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell maintenance.', 'Sentinels of chromatin: chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins in development and disease.', 'The Mechanisms of CHD8 in Neurodevelopment and Autism Spectrum Disorders.', 'The chromatin remodeler CHD8 governs hematopoietic stem/progenitor survival by regulating ATM-mediated P53 protein stability.']"""

Results:   There was significant correlation between 13N-ammonia and 18F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of primary PC (κ=0.425, P=0.001) and no significant difference in sensitivity (60.2 vs. 54.5%) and specificity (100 vs. 83.3%).

The concordance correlation coefficient was used to evaluate agreement and reproducibility at different b values. Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the pattern of relative measurement difference between b value combinations. The relationship between ADC values and Gleason score was tested by Spearman rank correlation.  Results:   ADC values varied depending on the b value combination selected.

Materials and methods:   The study included 193 patients (mean age, 61 ± 7 years) who underwent 3-T MRI with DWI (b values, 50 and 1000 s/mm(2)) before prostatectomy. Histogram metrics were derived from 3D volumes of interest encompassing the entire lesion on ADC maps. Pathologic features from radical prostatectomy and subsequent BCR were recorded for each patient. The Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney test were used to compare ADC-based metrics and pathologic features between patients with and patients without BCR. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to construct multivariable models for prediction of BCR, which were assessed by ROC analysis.  Results:   BCR occurred in 16.6% (32/193) of patients. Variables significantly associated with BCR included primary Gleason grade, Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margin, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, MRI tumor volume, mean whole-lesion ADC, entropy ADC, and mean ADC of the bottom 10th, 10-25th, and 25-50th percentiles (p ≤ 0.019). Significant independent predictors of BCR at multivariable analysis were primary Gleason grade, extraprostatic extension, mean of the bottom 10th percentile ADC, and entropy ADC (p = 0.002-0.037). The AUC of this multivariable model was 0.94 for prediction of BCR; the AUC of pathologic features alone was 0.89 (p = 0.001).  Conclusion:   A model integrating whole-lesion ADC metrics had significantly higher performance for prediction of BCR than did standard pathologic features alone and may help guide postoperative prognostic assessments and decisions regarding adjuvant therapy.""","""['Andrew B Rosenkrantz', 'Justin M Ream', 'Paul Nolan', 'Henry Rusinek', 'Fang-Ming Deng', 'Samir S Taneja']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Whole-Tumor Quantitative Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Histogram and Texture Analysis to Predict Gleason Score Upgrading in Intermediate-Risk 3 + 4 = 7 Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer aggressiveness: assessment with whole-lesion histogram analysis of the apparent diffusion coefficient.', 'Apparent diffusion coefficient value and ratio as noninvasive potential biomarkers to predict prostate cancer grading: comparison with prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Prognostic significance of lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'The utility of quantitative ADC values for differentiating high-risk from low-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Incremental prognostic value of ADC histogram analysis in patients with high-risk prostate cancer receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Differentiating prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia using whole-lesion histogram and texture analysis of diffusion- and T2-weighted imaging.', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Features of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer Following Radical Prostatectomy Based on Multiparametric MRI and Immunohistochemistry Analysis of MRI-guided Biopsy Specimens.', 'Baseline Volumetric T2 Relaxation Time Histogram Analysis: Can It Be Used to Predict the Response to Intravenous Methylprednisolone Therapy in Patients With Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy?']"""

However, the majority of examples reported have involved manual trapping of cells, which is time consuming and may lead to different cell lines being analysed in discrete batches. A simple, low-cost microfluidic flow chamber is introduced which allows single cells to be optically trapped and analysed in an automated fashion, greatly reducing the level of operator input required. Two implementations of the flow chamber are discussed here; a basic single-channel device in which the fluid velocity is controlled manually, and a dual-channel device which permits the automated capture and analysis of multiple cell lines with no operator input. Results are presented for the discrimination of live epithelial prostate cells and lymphocytes, together with a consideration of the consequences of traditional 'batch analysis' typically used for LTRS of live cells.""","""['S Casabella', 'P Scully', 'N Goddard', 'P Gardner']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Optical tweezers for medical diagnostics.', 'Laser Tweezers Raman Microspectroscopy of Single Cells and Biological Particles.', 'Real-Time, Label-Free Detection of Local Exocytosis Outside Pancreatic β Cells Using Laser Tweezers Raman Spectroscopy.', 'Recent advances in laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy (LTRS) for label-free analysis of single cells.', 'Raman Spectroscopy of Optically Trapped Single Biological Micro-Particles.', 'Optofluidic Tweezers: Efficient and Versatile Micro/Nano-Manipulation Tools.', 'Raman profile alterations of irradiated human nasopharyngeal cancer cells detected with laser tweezer Raman spectroscopy.', 'Advances in the analysis of single extracellular vesicles: A critical review.', 'Development overview of Raman-activated cell sorting devoted to bacterial detection at single-cell level.', 'Fatty-Acid Uptake in Prostate Cancer Cells Using Dynamic Microfluidic Raman Technology.']"""

Materials and methods:   Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed at 1.5T in nine patients with treatment-naïve metastatic prostate cancer (20 lesions) before antiandrogen treatment, after 1, 2, and 3 months of treatment, and thereafter every 4 months over 31 months or until antiandrogen resistance was detected. Tumor volumes were stable over time. Time courses of the ADCs when averaged over entire lesions and on functional diffusion maps (fDMs) were analyzed using marginal linear model (MLM) analysis.  Results:   Starting at 1 month, MLM analysis revealed decreasing mean ADCs (P = 0.001) over time. Simultaneously, the percentage of voxels with significantly higher ADCs decreased (P = 0.004), whereas the percentage of voxels with significantly lower ADCs increased (P < 0.001) on fDMs. Both mean ADCs (P = 0.042) and percentages of voxels with significantly higher ADCs on fDMs (P = 0.039) decreased more rapidly over time in patients with a shorter progression-free interval (PFI). Likewise, higher (P = 0.001) and more rapidly increasing (P = 0.002) percentages of voxels with significantly lower ADCs on fDMs were associated with a shorter PFI.  Conclusion:   The results of our pilot study suggest that the evolution of ADCs over time may permit early identification of antiandrogen resistance in bone metastases. J. Magn. Reson.

However, unfavorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetics properties such as low solubility, poor bioavailability, and systemic toxicity, are limiting its therapeutic application. In this context, the development of innovative nanocarriers can be useful to overcome these issues, and nanoencapsulation would represent a powerful strategy. In this study, we developed novel CL-loaded poly(ε-caprolactone) nanoparticles (NPs), and investigated their antiproliferative efficacy on prostate cancer cells. CL-NPs were prepared using a nanoprecipitation method and fully characterized by physicochemical techniques. The antiproliferative effects on LNCaP, DU-145, and PC3 cell lines of CL-NPs, compared to those of free CL at different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 µM), were investigated. Moreover, fluorescence microscopy was utilized to examine the cellular uptake of the nanosystems. Furthermore, to elucidate impact of nanoencapsulation on the mechanism of action, Western analyses were conducted to explore apoptosis, migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis alteration of prostate cancer cells. The results confirmed that CL-NPs inhibit proliferation dose dependently in all prostate cancer cells, with inhibitory concentration₅₀ less than 2 µM. In particular, the NPs significantly increased cytotoxicity at lower/medium dose (0.5 and 1.0 µM) on DU145 and PC3 cell lines with respect to free CL, with modulation of apoptotic and cell cycle machinery proteins. To date, this represents the first report on the development of biocompatible polymeric NPs encapsulating CL. Our findings offer new perspectives for the exploitation of developed CL-NPs as suitable prototypes for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Vanna Sanna', 'Jean Christopher Chamcheu', 'Nicolino Pala', 'Hasan Mukhtar', 'Mario Sechi', 'Imtiaz Ahmad Siddiqui']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Resveratrol-loaded nanoparticles based on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) and poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) blend for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Elaboration and characterization of curcumin-loaded Tri-CL-mPEG three-arm copolymeric nanoparticles by a microchannel technology.', 'Sugar-decorated mesoporous silica nanoparticles as delivery vehicles for the poorly soluble drug celastrol enables targeted induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.', 'Celastrol as an emerging anticancer agent: Current status, challenges and therapeutic strategies.', 'Celastrol: A Potential Natural Lead Molecule for New Drug Design, Development and Therapy for Memory Impairment.', 'Surface-Modified Inhaled Microparticle-Encapsulated Celastrol for Enhanced Efficacy in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.', 'Effect of Lipophilic Chains on the Antitumor Effect of a Dendritic Nano Drug Delivery System.', 'Celastrol: A lead compound that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, the activity of viral and human cysteine proteases, and virus-induced IL-6 secretion.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Nanotechnology-Based Celastrol Formulations and Their Therapeutic Applications.']"""

Nanocarriers (lipid vesicles) targeted to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is unique to human neovasculature for a variety of solid tumors, were loaded with the α-particle generator actinium-225 and were compared with a PSMA-targeted radiolabeled antibody. Actinium-225 emits a total of four α-particles per decay, providing highly lethal and localized irradiation of targeted cells with minimal exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. Lipid vesicles were derivatized with two types of PSMA-targeting ligands: a fully human PSMA antibody (mAb) and a urea-based, low-molecular-weight agent. Target selectivity and extent of internalization were evaluated on monolayers of human endothelial cells (HUVEC) induced to express PSMA in static incubation conditions and in a flow field. Both types of radiolabeled PSMA-targeted vesicles exhibit similar killing efficacy, which is greater than the efficacy of the radiolabeled control mAb when compared on the basis of delivered radioactivity per cell. Fluorescence confocal microscopy demonstrates that targeted vesicles localize closer to the nucleus, unlike antibodies which localize near the plasma membrane. In addition, targeted vesicles cause larger numbers of dsDNAs per nucleus of treated cells compared with the radiolabeled mAb. These findings demonstrate that radionuclide carriers, such as PSMA-targeted lipid-nanocarriers, which localize close to the nucleus, increase the probability of α-particle trajectories crossing the nuclei, and, therefore, enhance the killing efficacy of α-particle emitters.""","""['Charles Zhu#', 'Amey Bandekar#', 'Michelle Sempkowski', 'Sangeeta Ray Banerjee', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Frank Bruchertseifer', 'Alfred Morgenstern', 'Stavroula Sofou']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen liposomes loaded with 225Ac for potential targeted antivascular α-particle therapy of cancer.', '(2S)-2-(3-(1-Carboxy-5-(4-211At-Astatobenzamido)Pentyl)Ureido)-Pentanedioic Acid for PSMA-Targeted α-Particle Radiopharmaceutical Therapy.', 'Targeting of prostate-specific membrane antigen for radio-ligand therapy of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Radiolabeled enzyme inhibitors and binding agents targeting PSMA: Effective theranostic tools for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-Targeted Nanotheranostics for Imaging and Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Radioconjugates for Targeted Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel PSMA-Targeted Probe for NIRF-Guided Surgery and Photodynamic Therapy: Synthesis and Preclinical Validation.', 'PSMA-targeted theranostics of solid tumors: applications beyond prostate cancers.', 'Two diverse carriers are better than one: A case study in α-particle therapy for prostate specific membrane antigen-expressing prostate cancers.']"""

However, it is not clear to what extent linkage disequilibrium with fully pathogenic mutations might account for this association. There is scant information about the effect of K3326X in other hormone-related cancers.  Methods:   Using weighted logistic regression, we analyzed data from the large iCOGS study including 76 637 cancer case patients and 83 796 control patients to estimate odds ratios (ORw) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for K3326X variant carriers in relation to breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer risks, with weights defined as probability of not having a pathogenic BRCA2 variant. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling, we also examined the associations of K3326X with breast and ovarian cancer risks among 7183 BRCA1 variant carriers. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   The K3326X variant was associated with breast (ORw = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.17 to 1.40, P = 5.9x10(-) (6)) and invasive ovarian cancer (ORw = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.43, P = 3.8x10(-3)). These associations were stronger for serous ovarian cancer and for estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (ORw = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.70, P = 3.4x10(-5) and ORw = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.28 to 1.76, P = 4.1x10(-5), respectively). For BRCA1 mutation carriers, there was a statistically significant inverse association of the K3326X variant with risk of ovarian cancer (HR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.84, P = .013) but no association with breast cancer. No association with prostate cancer was observed.  Conclusions:   Our study provides evidence that the K3326X variant is associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers independent of other pathogenic variants in BRCA2. Further studies are needed to determine the biological mechanism of action responsible for these associations.""","""['Huong D Meeks', 'Honglin Song', 'Kyriaki Michailidou', 'Manjeet K Bolla', 'Joe

This case study proves the feasibility of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy as an outpatient procedure.  Method:   This report highlights the first, half-day, robotic prostatectomy performed on a 57-year-old man with localized prostate cancer. This operation was proposed to the subject because of his excellent physical condition and favorable environmental factors. He chose to undergo the surgery voluntarily.

Methods:   Eighty-seven prostate and 72 breast cancer survivors participated in an 8-week exercise and supportive group psychotherapy intervention (n = 84) or control (n = 75) group. Intervention participants were randomized to low-to-moderate intensity exercise (LIG; n = 44; 60-65 % VO2peak, 50-65 % one repetition maximum (1RM)) or moderate-to-high intensity exercise (HIG; n = 40; 75-80 % VO2peak, 65-80 % 1RM) while controls continued usual care. Before and after the 8 weeks, all participants completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast or -Prostate to assess quality of life (QOL) and Behavioural Regulations of Exercise Version 2 for exercise motivation. Intervention participants also completed a follow-up assessment 4 months post-intervention.  Results:   All three groups improved in QOL from baseline to post-intervention, with no significant differences. From post-intervention to follow-up, the LIG and HIG similarly maintained QOL scores. Between baseline and post-intervention, both intervention arms improved their motivation to exercise compared to the controls (p = 0.004). At the 4-month follow-up, the HIG had maintained their overall exercise motivation (p < 0.001) and both domains of intrinsic motivation (identified regulation, p = 0.047; intrinsic regulation, p = 0.007); however, the LIG had regressed.  Conclusions:   The structured intervention was successful at improving autonomous exercise motivation, regardless of exercise intensity. However, only those participants who had exercised at a higher intensity sustained their improvement. Intervention participation did not improve QOL more than controls.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Higher-intensity exercise is more likely to result in more sustainable increases in motivation to exercise among cancer survivors.""","""['Eric Martin', 'Claudio Battaglini', 'Beth Hands', 'Fiona L Naumann']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['Higher-Intensity Exercise Results in More Sustainable Improvements for VO2peak for Breast and Prostate Cancer Survivors.', 'An individual-based versus group-based exercise and counselling intervention for improving quality of life in breast cancer survivors.

A Danish cohort study of 45 326 prostate cancer patients diagnosed during 1995-2011""","""Background:   Many prostate cancer patients die of other causes, but it remains unknown whether comorbidity interacts synergistically with prostate cancer to increase the mortality rate beyond that explained by the individual risks of comorbidity and prostate cancer.  Methods:   A nationwide cohort study of 45 326 Danish prostate cancer patients diagnosed during 1995-2011, each matched to approximately five men from the general population on age and individual comorbidities in the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). We calculated five-year mortality rates and interaction contrasts as a measure of the excess mortality rate explained by synergy between prostate cancer and comorbidity.  Results:   Five-year mortality was 46.8% in prostate cancer patients and 25.8% in matched men from the general population. For prostate cancer patients with a CCI score of 2-3, the mortality rate was 250 per 1000 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI): 236, 263], and interaction between comorbidity and prostate cancer accounted for 20% of the total mortality rate (50 deaths per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 35, 65) in the first year following cancer diagnosis. The interaction was mainly present for patients with metastatic disease and those not treated with prostatectomy.  Conclusion:   Up to 20% of all deaths among men who had both prostate cancer and comorbidities could be explained by the comorbidity-prostate cancer interaction. The mortality attributable to comorbidity itself and the mortality attributable to the interaction may be reduced by successful treatment of the comorbidity.""","""['Anne Gulbech Ording', 'Erzsébet Horváth-Puhó', 'Timothy L Lash', 'Vera Ehrenstein', 'Michael Borre', 'Mogens Vyberg', 'Henrik Toft Sørensen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer, comorbidity, and the risk of venous thromboembolism: A cohort study of 44,035 Danish prostate cancer patients, 1995-2011.', 'Does comorbidity interact with colorectal cancer to increase mortality?

The increased expression of genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes found in bone metastatic tissue from patients suggests that up-regulated steroidogenesis might contribute to tumor growth at the metastatic site. Because of the overall sclerotic phenotype, we hypothesize that osteoblasts regulate the intratumoral steroidogenesis of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in bone. We here show that osteoblasts alter the steroidogenic transcription program in CRPC cells, closely mimicking the gene expression pattern described in CRPC. Osteoblast-stimulated LNCaP-19 cells displayed an increased expression of genes encoding for steroidogenic enzymes (CYP11A1, HSD3B1, and AKR1C3), estrogen signaling-related genes (CYP19A1, and ESR2), and genes for DHT-inactivating enzymes (UGT2B7, UGT2B15, and UGT2B17). The observed osteoblast-induced effect was exclusive to osteogenic CRPC cells (LNCaP-19) in contrast to osteolytic PC-3 and androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. The altered steroid enzymatic pattern was specific for the intratibial tumors and verified by immunohistochemistry in tissue specimens from LNCaP-19 xenograft tumors. Additionally, the overall steroidogenic effect was reflected by corresponding levels of progesterone and testosterone in serum from castrated mice with intratibial xenografts. A bi-directional interplay was demonstrated since both proliferation and Esr2 expression of osteoblasts were induced by CRPC cells in steroid-depleted conditions. Together, our results demonstrate that osteoblasts are important mediators of the intratumoral steroidogenesis of CRPC and for castration-resistant growth in bone. Targeting osteoblasts may therefore be important in the development of new therapeutic approaches.""","""['Malin Hagberg Thulin', 'Maria E Nilsson', 'Pontus Thulin', 'Jocelyn Céraline', 'Claes Ohlsson', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Karin Welén']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['The roles of RUNX2 and osteoclasts in regulating expression of steroidogenic enzymes in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Osteoblasts stimulate the osteogenic and metastatic progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer in a novel model for in vitro and in vivo studies.', 'Nuclear Receptor LRH-1 Functions to Promote Castration-Resistant Growth of Prostate Cancer via Its Promotion of Intratumoral Androgen Biosynthesis.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Classical and Non-Classical Roles for Pre-Receptor Control of DHT Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Osteoblast Secretome Modulated by Abiraterone Treatment Affects Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation.', 'Osteoclasts directly influence castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Osteoblasts Promote Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation Through Androgen Receptor Independent Mechanisms.', 'CLICK-enabled analogues reveal pregnenolone interactomes in cancer and immune cells.', 'Osteoblasts Generate Testosterone From DHEA and Activate Androgen Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed Medicare claims data for 175,181 elderly adults with lung, colorectal, female breast, or prostate cancer diagnosis who died in 2008. The end-of-life costs were quantified as total Medicare expenditures for the last 12 months of care including inpatient, outpatient, physician services, hospice, home health, skilled nursing facilities (SNF), and durable medical expenditure. Linear regression models were used to estimate rural-urban differences in log-transformed end-of-life costs and logistic regressions were used to estimate probability of service use, adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities.  Findings:   On average, elderly cancer patients cost Medicare $51,273, $50,274, $62,815, and $50,941 in the last year for breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancer, respectively. Rural patients cost Medicare about 10%, 6%, 8%, and 4% less on end-of-life care than their urban counterparts for breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancer, respectively. Rural cancer patients were less likely to use hospice and home health, more likely to use outpatient and SNF, and they cost Medicare less on inpatient and physician services and more on outpatient care conditional on service use.  Conclusions:   The lower Medicare spending on end-of-life care for the rural cancer patients suggests disparities based on place of residence.

Because most patients with HGPIN do not harbor or develop PCa, clinical, pathological, or molecular markers that predict of PCa risk are of clinical significance.  Materials and methods:   Overall, 155 men with a diagnosis of isolated HGPIN, which was based on the results of extended biopsy, and who underwent at least one repeat biopsy were analyzed for ERG oncoprotein (ERG) expression and clinicopathological parameters to determine the risk of finding PCa in subsequent biopsies.  Results:   Of 155 patients diagnosed with HGPIN on initial biopsy, 39 (25%) had PCa on subsequent biopsies. For men with only one repeat biopsy, the cancer detection rate was 22%. Most (54%) PCas were detected in≤6 months of rebiopsy. ERG expression was present in 15 patients with HGPIN (9.6%). Patients with ERG expression in HGPIN were more likely to have PCa in repeat biopsy, with 9 (60%) ERG-positive and 30 (21%) of ERG-negative patients having PCa (P = 0.001). Multifocal involvement (P = 0.0001), cribriform morphology (P = 0.004), and bilaterality (P = 0.0075) of HGPIN were other significant risk factors. On multivariable analysis, only the presence of ERG positivity and multifocality remained significant parameters in detecting PCa on a repeat biopsy. The presence of ERG-negative focal HGPIN involving one core, which accounted for 46% of patients, had minimal (16%) PCa risk on subsequent biopsy. In total, 8 patients (89%) ERG-positive HGPIN had PCa identified at identical sites on subsequent biopsy, of which 5 (71%) were ERG positive.  Conclusions:   The status of ERG expression in HGPIN along with other histological parameters stratifies patients into low- and high-risk groups for having PCa on subsequent biopsy.

To date, traditional linkage and association studies have identified only a limited number of genes and specific gene variants that account for only a small proportion of PC risk. To identify novel PC predisposition genes we performed whole-exome sequencing of PC-affected men from families with a significant history of PC.  Methods and materials:   Exome sequencing was performed on 5 PC-affected men from 3 families where there were multiple cases of PCs and where diagnostic testing returned a negative result for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Genotyping was performed for all potentially predisposing variants detected within each family on the affected and unaffected male participants.  Results:   Essential splice site, missense, and stop-lost variants were filtered against a recently published candidate gene list. A total of 19 truncating variants and 17 missense variants were identified for genotyping in all prostate-affected and unaffected male participants. In all, 3 missense variants, PCTP, MCRS1, and ATRIP, demonstrated complete segregation and 1 missense variant, PARP2, demonstrated partial segregation with PC. In addition, 3 truncating variants, CYP3A43, DOK3, and PLEKHH3, demonstrated complete segregation and 3 truncation mutations, HEATR5B, GPR124, and HKR1, demonstrated partial segregation with PC. No segregating variants between the 3 families were shared.  Conclusions:   In all, 10 truncating or missense variants showed either complete or partial segregation with PC in the relevant families.

RP consisted of retropubic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, involving 84 cases and 111 cases, respectively. BCR was defined as a prostate serum antigen (PSA) level ≥0.2 ng/mL. BCR-free survival (BCRFS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Preoperative predictors of BCR were assessed with Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis.  Results:   Eighty-nine patients (45.6 %) experienced recurrence. BCRFS rates 3 and 5 years after RP were 58 and 50 %, respectively. Prostate volume, transition zone volume, and Gleason score were not significantly associated with BCR. Patients with higher preoperative PSA, PSA density (PSAD), PSA density of the transition zone, percentage of positive cores (PPC), and PPC from the dominant side showed significantly lower BCRFS. The PPC from the dominant side and PSAD were significant independent prognostic factors for BCR. Using these variables, the hazard ratio of BCR could be calculated and patients stratified into three risk groups. The 5-year BCRFS rates for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 64.9 %, 48.1 %, and 21.3 %, respectively.

Structured surgical training and objective assessment are critical for outcomes.  Objective:   To develop and validate a modular training and assessment pathway via Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA) for trainees undertaking RARP and evaluate learning curves (LCs) for procedural steps.  Design, setting, and participants:   This multi-institutional (Europe, Australia, and United States) observational prospective study used HFMEA to identify the high-risk steps of RARP. A specialist focus group enabled validation. Fifteen trainees who underwent European Association of Urology robotic surgery curriculum training performed RARP and were assessed by mentors using the tool developed. Results produced LCs for each step. A plateau above score 4 indicated competence.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We used a modular training and assessment tool (RARP Assessment Score) to evaluate technical skills. LCs were constructed. Multivariable Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and κ coefficient analyses were used.  Results and limitations:   Five surgeons were observed for 42 console hours to map steps of RARP. HFMEA identified 84 failure modes and 46 potential causes with a hazard score ≥8. Content validation created the RARP Assessment Score: 17 stages and 41 steps. The RARP Assessment Score was acceptable (56.67%), feasible (96.67%), and had educational impact (100%). Fifteen robotic surgery trainees were assessed for 8 mo. In 426 RARP cases (range: 4-79), all procedural steps were attempted by trainees. Trainees were assessed with the RARP Assessment Score by their expert mentors, and LCs for individual steps were plotted. LCs demonstrated plateaus for anterior bladder neck transection (16 cases), posterior bladder neck transection (18 cases), posterior dissection (9 cases), dissection of prostatic pedicle and seminal vesicles (15 cases), and anastomosis (17 cases). Other steps did not plateau during data collection.  Conclusions:   The RARP Assessment Score based on HFMEA methodology identified critical steps for focused RARP training and assessed surgeons. LCs demonstrate the experience necessary to reach a level of competence in technical skills to protect patients.  Patient summary:   We developed a safety and assessment tool to gauge the technical skills of surgeons performing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Improvement was monitored, and measures of progress can be used in future to guide mentors when training surgeons to operate safely.""","""['Catherine Lovegrove', 'Giacomo Novara', 'Alex Mottrie', 'Khurshid A Guru', 'Matthew Brown', 'Ben Challacombe', 'Richard Popert', 'Johar Raza', 'Henk Van der Poel', 'James Peabody', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Kamran Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Pilot Validation Study of the European Association of Urology Robotic Training Curriculum.', 'Modular Training for Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Where to Begin?', 'Quantifying the ""Assistant Effect"" in Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP): Measures of Technical Performance.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Getting ready for the first robotic prostatectomy, from basics to real practice.', ""Predictors of trainees' proficiency during the learning curve of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy at high- -volume institutions: results from a multicentric series."", 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: learning curves and outcomes from an Australian perspective.', 'Description of the technique for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in canine cadavers: 2D vs. 3D camera.', 'Long-term oncologic outcomes of robot-assisted radical cystectomy: update series from a high-volume robotic center beyond 10\xa0years of follow-up.', 'Video labelling robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and the role of artificial intelligence (AI): training a novice.']"""

Methods:   We obtained dose-population histograms (DPHs) of 20 helical tomotherapy treatment plans for prostate cancer by simulating the effects of different systematic errors (Σ) and random errors (σ) on these plans. We obtained dosimetric margins and margin reductions due to random errors (random margins) by fitting the theoretical results of coverages for Gaussian distributions with coverages of the planned D99% obtained from the DPHs.  Results:   The dosimetric margins obtained for helical tomotherapy prostate treatments were 3.3 mm, 3 mm, and 1 mm in the lateral (Lat), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI) directions. Random margins showed parabolic dependencies, yielding expressions of 0.16σ(2), 0.13σ(2), and 0.15σ(2) for the Lat, AP, and SI directions, respectively. When focusing on values up to σ = 5 mm, random margins could be fitted considering Gaussian penumbras with standard deviations (σp) equal to 4.5 mm Lat, 6 mm AP, and 5.5 mm SI.  Conclusions:   Despite complex dose distributions in helical tomotherapy treatment plans, we were able to simplify the behaviour of our plans against treatment errors to single values of dosimetric and random margins for each direction. These margins allowed us to develop specific margin recipes for the respective treatment technique. The method is general and could be used for any treatment technique provided that DPHs can be obtained.""","""['David Sevillano', 'Cristina Mínguez', 'Alicia Sánchez', 'Alberto Sánchez-Reyes']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Dosimetric impacts of gantry angle misalignment on prostate cancer treatment using helical tomotherapy.', 'Evaluation of clinical margins via simulation of patient setup errors in prostate IMRT treatment plans.', 'Evaluation of dosimetric margins in prostate IMRT treatment plans.', 'Margin evaluation in the presence of deformation, rotation, and translation in prostate and entire seminal vesicle irradiation with daily marker-based setup corrections.', 'Correlation between dosimetric effect and intrafraction motion during prostate treatments delivered with helical tomotherapy.']"""

However, the reported associations between carotenoids and prostate cancer have been heterogeneous and lacking data on interactions with nucleotide sequence variations and genomic biomarkers.  Objective:   To examine the associations between carotenoid levels and the risk of high-grade prostate cancer, also considering antioxidant-related genes and tumor instability.  Methods:   We measured plasma levels of carotenoids and genotyped 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, XRCC1, and OGG1 among 559 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. We performed copy number analysis in a subset of these men (n = 67) to study tumor instability assessed as Fraction of the Genome Altered (FGA). We examined associations between carotenoids, genotypes, tumor instability and risk of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason grade ≥ 4 + 3) using logistic and linear regression.  Results:   Circulating carotenoid levels were inversely associated with the risk of high-grade prostate cancer; odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing highest versus lowest quartiles were: 0.34 (95% CI: 0.18-0.66) for α-carotene, 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15-0.63) for β-carotene, 0.55 (0.28-1.08) for lycopene and 0.37 (0.18-0.75) for total carotenoids. SNPs rs25489 in XRCC1, rs699473 in SOD3 and rs1052133 in OGG1 modified these associations for α-carotene, β-carotene and lycopene, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). The proportion of men with a high degree of FGA increased with Gleason Score (P < 0.001). Among men with Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4, higher lycopene levels were associated with lower FGA (P = 0.04).  Conclusion:   Circulating carotenoids at diagnosis, particularly among men carrying specific somatic variations, were inversely associated with risk of high-grade prostate cancer. In exploratory analyses, higher lycopene level was associated with less genomic instability among men with low-grade disease which is novel and supports the hypothesis that lycopene may inhibit progression of prostate cancer early in its natural history.""","""['Tobias Nordström', 'Erin L Van Blarigan', 'Vy Ngo', 'Ritu Roy', 'Vivian Weinberg', 'Xiaoling Song', 'Jeffry Simko', 'Peter R Carroll', 'June M Chan', 'Pamela L Paris']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Lower prostate cancer risk in men with elevated plasma lycopene levels: results of a prospective analysis.', 'Antioxidant and vitamin E transport genes and risk of high-grade prostate cancer and prostate cancer recurrence.', 'Relationship between plasma carotenoids and prostate cancer.', 'Increased dietary and circulating lycopene are associated with reduced prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Effect of Carotene and Lycopene on the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.', 'Plasma Micronutrient Profile of Prostate Cancer Cases Is Altered Relative to Healthy Controls-Results of a Pilot Study in South Australia.', 'Can Diet Prevent Urological Cancers?

Therefore, it is important to investigate additional treatment options that could achieve greater efficacy. Because of tumor heterogeneity and the development of resistance to treatment with single agents, combination therapies using existing drugs with new agents can potentially broaden individual therapeutic windows and achieve improved efficacy and safety profiles. The objective of the current studies was to evaluate the efficacy of combination of enzalutamide (ENZ) with prostate specific membrane antigen antibody drug conjugate (PSMA ADC) to inhibit CRPC patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in a preclinical setting.  Methods:   Subcutaneous LuCaP 96CR prostate cancer PDX bearing mice were treated with a single dose of PSMA ADC (2.0 mg/kg) or 5 days a week ENZ (50 mg/kg) as monotherapy or with a combination of these two agents. The effects of the PSMA ADC+ENZ combination were compared to PSMA ADC alone, ENZ alone, and placebo control. IHC analyses were performed to determine PSMA, AR, ARV7, and GR expression and effects on proliferation.  Results:   All treatments inhibited tumor progression but with different efficacy. At 6 weeks, in the control and ENZ groups all tumors were progressing, while in the PSMA ADC group only 5/11 were progressing, two remained unchanged and four tumors had decreased tumor volume. Moreover, all animals in the PSMA ADC+ENZ group had smaller tumors at week 6 when compared to their size at enrollment (week 0). A 14-week followup showed that all three treatments resulted in significant survival benefits but the combination effects were the most pronounced resulting in PSMA ADC+ENZ versus ENZ HR = 0.093 (P = 0.0045) and PSMA ADC+ENZ versus PSMA ADC HR = 0.051 (P = <0.0001) with no deaths observed in the combination group.  Conclusions:   Our results clearly indicate that the combination of PSMA ADC+ENZ possesses strong antitumor activity and significantly improves survival over ENZ monotherapy using the LuCaP 96CR PDX model. These results provide a strong rationale for clinical testing of PSMA ADC in combination with ENZ and/or other androgen-directed treatment strategies.""","""['Vincent A DiPippo', 'Holly M Nguyen', 'Lisha G Brown', 'William C Olson', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Eva Corey']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['PSMA ADC monotherapy in patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following abiraterone and/or enzalutamide: Efficacy and safety in open-label single-arm phase 2 study.', 'Efficacy studies of an antibody-drug conjugate PSMA-ADC in patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Combination AZD5363 with Enzalutamide Significantly Delays Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer in Preclinical Models.', 'Efficacy and safety of second-line agents for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.

Herein, we investigated the use of Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC ((68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC) for this purpose.  Methods:   PC patients (n = 1,889) undergoing (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT or PET/MR scans were evaluated retrospectively for suggestive lung lesions. For up to 5 lesions per patient, location, CT diameter, CT morphology, and SUVmax were determined. The standard for classification was either histopathologic evaluation or, in the case of PC metastases, responsivity to antihormone therapy. A comparison of the different classes was executed by Student t test. Prostate-specific antigen and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) immunohistochemistry were performed if histologic samples were available; (68)Ga-PSMA autoradiography was performed on an exemplary case of PET-positive lung cancer.  Results:   Eighty-nine lesions in 45 patients were identified, of which 76 were classified as PC (39 proven, 37 highly probable), 7 as primary lung cancer, and 2 as activated tuberculosis; 4 lesions remained unclear. The mean SUVmax was 4.4 ± 3.9 for PC metastases and 5.6 ± 1.6 for primary lung cancer (P = 0.408). Additionally, substantial differences in SUVmax intraindividually were detected. The 2 tuberculous lesions showed an SUVmax of 7.8 and 2.5. Using immunohistochemistry, we could demonstrate PSMA expression in the neovasculature of several PSMA PET-positive lung cancers as well as in tuberculous lesions from our histologic database.  Conclusion:   Quantitative (SUV) analysis of (68)Ga-PSMA PET was not able to discriminate reliably between pulmonary metastases and primary lung cancer in PC patients. The reason for the unexpectedly high tracer uptake in non-PC lesions is not completely clear. PSMA expression in neovasculature provides a possible explanation for this finding; however, other contributing factors, such as tracer binding to proteins other than PSMA, cannot be excluded at present.""","""['Thomas Pyka', 'Gregor Weirich', 'Ingo Einspieler', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Jörg Theisen', 'Georgios Hatzichristodoulou', 'Kristina Schwamborn', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['68GaPSMA-HBED-CC Uptake in Osteolytic, Osteoblastic, and Bone Marrow Metastases of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Biodistribution of (68)GaPSMA-HBED-CC in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Characterization of Uptake in Normal Organs and Tumour Lesions.', 'Value of 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET for the Assessment of Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence: Comparison with Histopathology After Salvage Lymphadenectomy.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in prostate cancer.', 'Performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for Prostate Cancer Management at Initial Staging and Time of Biochemical Recurrence.', 'Preclinical and pilot clinical evaluation of a small-molecule carbonic anhydrase IX targeting PET tracer in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'PSMA Expression in Solid Tumors beyond the Prostate Gland: Ready for Theranostic Applications?', 'PSMA PET-CT in the Diagnosis and Staging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Positron emission tomography imaging of lung cancer: An overview of alternative positron emission tomography tracers beyond F18 fluorodeoxyglucose.', 'Cancers and Benign Processes on 68 Ga PSMA PET-CT Imaging Other than Prostate Cancer.']"""

Specific aims of this study were to (1) describe the levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex (MOPC) enzymes, fatigue, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) before and at completion of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PC); (2) examine relationships over time among levels of MOPC enzymes, fatigue, and HRQOL; and (3) compare levels of MOPC enzymes in men with clinically significant and nonsignificant fatigue intensification during EBRT.  Methods:   Fatigue was measured by the revised Piper Fatigue Scale and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue subscale (FACT-F). MOPC enzymes (Complexes I-V) and mitochondrial antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 were measured in peripheral blood using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and completion of EBRT. Participants were categorized into high or low fatigue (HF vs. LF) intensification groups based on amount of change in FACT-F scores during EBRT.  Results:   Fatigue reported by the 22 participants with PC significantly worsened and HRQOL significantly declined from baseline to EBRT completion. The HF group comprised 12 men with clinically significant change in fatigue (HF) during EBRT. Although no significant changes were observed in MOPC enzymes from baseline to EBRT completion, there were important differences in the patterns in the levels of MOPC enzymes between HF and LF groups.

Materials and methods:   A two-loop ERC (ERC-2L) and a microstrip-loop ERC (ERC-ML) were compared at 7T in terms of transmit and receive performance. The best-performing ERC was evaluated alone and in combination with the ESA through 1) simulations on both phantom and an anatomically correct numerical human model to assess B1+ transmit and specific absorption rate (SAR) efficiencies, and 2) phantom experiments to calculate B1+ transmit efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Phantom studies were also performed to look at heating when using the ERC as a transmitter and for comparing the new coil against a single-channel balloon-type ERC (ERC-b). High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions were performed on a single healthy subject using the two-channel ERC combined with the ESA.  Results:   Compared to the ERC-ML, the ERC-2L demonstrated 20% higher SAR efficiency and higher SNR 3 cm from the coil. The presence of a tuned and detuned ERC-2L did not alter the peak local SAR of the ESA alone; however, the detuned ERC-2L had 45% less peak local SAR around the rectum compared to the tuned ERC-2L. The receive-only version of the ERC-2L improved the SNR 4.7-fold and 1.3-fold compared to the ESA and ERC-b, respectively. In combination with the ESA, the ERC-2L supported in-plane voxel-size of 0.36 × 0.36 mm(2) in T2 -weighted anatomic imaging.

The tumor typically develops in the atrophic, pachydermatous, hyperkeratotic skin of limbs affected by long-standing lymphedema. Clinical data associated with Stewart-Treves syndrome and lymphedema management have rarely been published.  Methods and results:   In the period between 1980 and 2009, ten patients with Stewart-Treves syndrome were diagnosed and treated at the Foeldiklinik, Hinterzarten, Germany. Nine of the ten patients were female. Five patients had previously suffered from breast cancer (and were treated with mastectomy); two from other malignancies; two patients had primary lymphedema, and one had undergone lower extremity lymphadenectomy. All cancer patients had undergone radiation treatment. In all cases, the sarcoma developed in non-irradiated areas 6-48 years (average 16.3 years) after the onset of lymphedema. None of the patients had received complex decongestive physical therapy (CDT). Two patients had above-elbow amputation, one had shoulder exarticulation, two patients had wide excision and skin grafting, two patients had above-knee amputation procedure, two patients had a below-knee amputation procedure, and one patient had no surgical treatment at all. The time to recurrence after surgery, time to metastasis, patient survival and CDT were recorded.  Conclusions:   Patients with lymphedema should be closely examined starting 5 years from the time of lymphedema onset, paying special attention to those with associated malignancies. Only early diagnosis and treatment by radical ablative surgery confers a reasonable prognosis with this rare but aggressive disease.

The ubiquitin-ligase tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was recently linked to regulate intramembrane proteolytic cleavage of the TβRI in cancer cells. Subsequently, the intracellular domain (ICD) of TβRI enters in an unknown manner into the nucleus, where it promotes the transcription of pro-invasive genes, such as MMP2 and MMP9. Here we show that the endocytic adaptor molecules APPL1 and APPL2 are required for TGFβ-induced nuclear translocation of TβRI-ICD and for cancer cell invasiveness of human prostate and breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, APPL proteins were found to be expressed at high levels in aggressive prostate cancer tissues, and to be associated with TβRI in a TRAF6-dependent manner.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET is a promising new modality for staging prostate cancer, with recent studies showing potential advantages over traditional computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear medicine bone scan imaging. However, the impact of PSMA PET on the decision-making of radiation oncologists and outcomes after radiotherapy is yet to be determined. Our aim was to determine the impact of PSMA PET on a radiation oncologist's clinical practice.  Findings:   Patients in a radiation oncology clinic who underwent PSMA PET were prospectively recorded in an electronic oncology record. Patient demographics, outcomes of imaging, and impact on decision-making were evaluated. Fifty-four patients underwent PSMA PET between January and May 2015. The major reasons for undergoing PET included staging before definitive (14.8%) or post-prostatectomy (33.3%) radiotherapy, and investigation of PSA failures following definitive (16.7%) or post-prostatectomy (33.3%) radiotherapy. In 46.3% of patients PSMA was positive after negative traditional imaging, in 9.3% PSMA was positive after equivocal imaging, and in 13.0% PSMA was negative after equivocal imaging. PSMA PET changed radiotherapy management in 46.3% of cases, and hormone therapy in 33.3% of patients, with an overall change in decision-making in 53.7% of patients.

This comorbidity is often quantified by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) using specific weights (1, 2, 3, or 6) for different comorbidities. It has been shown that the CCI increases at different times and with different sizes, so that traditional time to event analysis is not adequate to assess these temporal changes. Here, we present a method to model temporal changes in CCI in cancer patients using data from PCBaSe Sweden, a nation-wide population-based prospective cohort of men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Our proposed model is based on the assumption that a change in comorbidity, as quantified by the CCI, is an irreversible one-way process, i.e., CCI accumulates over time and cannot decrease.  Methods:   CCI was calculated based on 17 disease categories, which were defined using ICD-codes for discharge diagnoses in the National Patient Register. A state transition model in discrete time steps (i.e., four weeks) was applied to capture all changes in CCI. The transition probabilities were estimated from three modelling steps: 1) Logistic regression model for vital status, 2) Logistic regression model to define any changes in CCI, and 3) Poisson regression model to determine the size of CCI change, with an additional logistic regression model for CCI changes ≥ 6. The four models combined yielded parameter estimates to calculate changes in CCI with their confidence intervals.  Results:   These methods were applied to men with low-risk prostate cancer who received active surveillance (AS), radical prostatectomy (RP), or curative radiotherapy (RT) as primary treatment. There were large differences in CCI changes according to treatment.  Conclusions:   Our method to model temporal changes in CCI efficiently captures changes in comorbidity over time with a small number of regression analyses to perform - which would be impossible with tradition time to event analyses. However, our approach involves a simulation step that is not yet included in standard statistical software packages. In our prostate cancer example we showed that there are large differences in development of comorbidities among men receiving different treatments for prostate cancer.""","""['Lars Lindhagen', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'David Robinson', 'Pär Stattin', 'Hans Garmo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['Undertreatment of Men in Their Seventies with High-risk Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'How to measure temporal changes in care pathways for chronic diseases using health care registry data.', 'Association of the Charlson comorbidity index and hypertension with survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Impact of comorbidities at diagnosis on prostate cancer treatment and survival.', 'Impact of age and comorbidities on long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional competing-risks analysis.', 'Modeling Disease Trajectories for Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Using Nationwide Population-based Data.', 'Long-term Outcomes Among Men Undergoing Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer in Sweden.', 'Population-based estimates of age and comorbidity specific life expectancy: a first application in Swedish males.', 'Studying trajectories of multimorbidity: a systematic scoping review of longitudinal approaches and evidence.', 'The burden of chronic diseases among Australian cancer patients: Evidence from a longitudinal exploration, 2007-2017.']"""

Important socioeconomic screening disparities have been reported. However, trends in PCa screening and social disparities have not been investigated in Switzerland, a high risk country for PCa. We used data from five waves (from 1992-2012) of the population-based Swiss Health Interview Survey to evaluate trends in PCa screening and its association with socioeconomic indicators.  Methods:   We used multivariable Poisson regression to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) adjusting for demographics, health status, and use of healthcare.  Results:   The study included 12,034 men aged ≥50 years (mean age: 63.9). Between 1992 and 2012, ever use of PCa screening increased from 55.3% to 70.0% and its use within the last two years from 32.6% to 42.4% (p-value <0.05). Income, education, and occupational class were independently associated with PCa screening. PCa screening within the last two years was greater in men with the highest (>$6,000/month) vs. lowest income (≤$2,000) (46.5% vs. 38.7% in 2012, PR for overall period =1.29, 95%CI: 1.13-1.48). These socioeconomic disparities did not significantly change over time.  Conclusions:   This study shows that about half of Swiss men had performed at least one PCa screening. Men belonging to high socioeconomic status are clearly more frequently screened than those less favored.

In order to decipher the function of its potential N-glycosylation site, we produced pro-KLK2 in Leishmania tarentolae cells and compared it with its non-glycosylated counterpart from Escherichia coli expression. Mass spectrometry revealed that Asn-95 carries a core glycan, consisting of two GlcNAc and three hexoses. Autocatalytic activation was retarded in glyco-pro-KLK2, whereas the activated glyco-form exhibited an increased proteolytic resistance. The specificity patterns obtained by the PICS (proteomic identification of protease cleavage sites) method are similar for both KLK2 variants, with a major preference for P1-Arg. However, glycosylation changes the enzymatic activity of KLK2 in a drastically substrate-dependent manner. Although glyco-KLK2 has a considerably lower catalytic efficiency than glycan-free KLK2 toward peptidic substrates with P2-Phe, the situation was reverted toward protein substrates, such as glyco-pro-KLK2 itself. These findings can be rationalized by the glycan-carrying 99-loop that prefers to cover the active site like a lid. By contrast, the non-glycosylated 99-loop seems to favor a wide open conformation, which mostly increases the apparent affinity for the substrates (i.e. by a reduction of Km). Also, the cleavage pattern and kinetics in autolytic inactivation of both KLK2 variants can be explained by a shift of the target sites due to the presence of the glycan.

Here, we evaluated the expression of PSGR protein, studied its diagnostic and prognostic value in PCa, and also explored its role in cancer cell growth and invasion.  Methods:   The expression of PSGR in paired adjacent normal prostate, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and PCa were determined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays constructed from 150 radical prostatectomy specimens. The effects of PSGR on PCa cell growth and invasion were investigated using human PCa cell lines.  Results:   Membranous and cytoplasmic PSGR staining was observed at luminal epithelial cells of prostate. PSGR protein expression was significantly higher in PIN compared to normal prostate. Interestingly, the expression of PSGR decreased as PIN progressed to PCa. Low PSGR expression in PCa was associated with high Gleason score, and poor overall survival. Activated PSGR increased cancer cell invasive ability, but retarded cell growth. PSGR did not affect mTOR activity, but suppressed P70 S6 kinase activity.  Conclusions:   PSGR may participate in PCa progression through affecting cell proliferation and invasion. High expression of PSGR in PIN may implicate its role in early neoplastic transformation of PCa.

In preclinical trials, the Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor ganetespib demonstrated potent inhibition of solid tumor growth, with superior potency than prior Hsp90 inhibitors. Given the promising preclinical outcome and favorable pharmacologic properties of ganetespib, we conducted a phase II trial of single-agent ganetespib in patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The primary objective of the study was to determine the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate.  Methods:   Patients with mCRPC who had been previously treated with docetaxel were enrolled after meeting eligibility criteria. All patients received ganetespib at 200 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28 days (one cycle). Subjects who tolerated therapy were continued on ganetespib until disease progression. Considering that Hsp90 acetylation may confer insensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors and maspin inhibits protein deacetylation, maspin-associated molecular markers were evaluated.  Results:   Eighteen patients were recruited into the trial; most were Caucasian, had performance status 1, had received prior docetaxel, and were heavily pretreated. Of the 17 patients who were treated, none attained 6-month PFS. Only 2 patients achieved PFS > 4 months. The median PFS was 1.9 months. As per the study design, the trial was terminated after the interim analysis. The most frequent types of Grade 3 toxicity were dehydration, diarrhea, and fatigue. Molecular markers provided little additional insight regarding drug activity.  Conclusions:   Ganetespib demonstrated minimal clinical activity in men with mCRPC. The true 6-month PFS rate was, at most, 0.20.

One reason for failure could stem from the mismatch of antigenic signatures of vaccine cells and cancer in situ. Hence, it is possible that vaccine cells expressed antigens differently than tumor cells in situ. We hypothesized that cells grown in vitro at low oxygen tension (pO2) provide a better antigen match to tumors in situ and could reveal a more relevant antigenic landscape than cells grown in atmospheric pO2.  Methods:   We tested this hypothesis by comparing PCa cells propagated at pO2 = 2 kPa and 20 kPa. To identify potential tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), we prepared PCa cell lysates, resolved them by two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting using spontaneous antibodies from plasma derived from PCa patients and control subjects. Antibody-labeled spots were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and validated by ELISA. We selected hypoxia-regulated HSP70 and hnRNP L and hypoxia-independent HSP60 and determined the frequency of plasma samples reacting with these molecules.  Results:   Frequency of HSP60-reactive plasma was low in healthy controls [1.3 % (1/76)], while it was elevated in PCa patients [13.0 % (7/54); p < 0.05]. These data suggest a humoral immune response to HSP60 in PCa. Levels of autoantibodies to HSP70 did not differ from healthy controls [3.7 % (2/54)] in PCa patients [5.3 % (2/38)]. Similarly, hnRNP L autoantibodies did no differ between healthy controls [6.1 % (3/49)] and PCa patients [5.3 % (2/38)].  Conclusions:   Overall our results suggest the value of hypoxia as a modifier of the cellular and antigenic landscape of PCa cells. By modifying the immune reactivity of PCa cells in culture, manipulation of pO2 can be proposed as a new avenue for improving diagnosis, prognosis and immunotherapy for PCa.""","""['Tangeng Ma', 'Claire A Schreiber', 'Gaylord J Knutson', 'Abdelouahid El Khattouti', 'Marcelo J Sakiyama', 'Mohamed Hassan', 'Mary Christine Charlesworth', 'Benjamin J Madden', 'Xinchun Zhou', 'Stanimir Vuk-Pavlović', 'Christian R Gomez']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Res Notes""","""['Evaluation and characterization of anti-RalA autoantibody as a potential serum biomarker in human prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer-associated autoantibodies in serum against tumor-associated antigens as potential new biomarkers.', 'Using Serological Proteome Analysis to Identify Serum Anti-Nucleophosmin 1 Autoantibody as a Potential Biomarker in European-American and African-American Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Proteomics in diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Autoantibodies against heat shock proteins as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.', 'Rationale for Combining Radiotherapy and Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Patients With Hypoxic Tumors.', 'Hypoxia on the Expression of Hepatoma Upregulated Protein in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   A Siemens Skyra 3T MR imaging (MRI) scanner with laser bridge, flat couch, and pelvic coil mounts was used to scan 39 patients scheduled for external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. For sCT generation a whole-pelvis MRI scan (1.6 mm 3-dimensional isotropic T2w SPACE [Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrasts using different flip angle Evolution] sequence) was acquired. Three additional small field of view scans were acquired: T2w, T2*w, and T1w flip angle 80° for gold fiducials. Patients received a routine planning CT scan. Manual contouring of the prostate, rectum, bladder, and bones was performed independently on the CT and MR scans. Three experienced observers contoured each organ on MRI, allowing interobserver quantification. To generate a training database, each patient CT scan was coregistered to their whole-pelvis T2w using symmetric rigid registration and structure-guided deformable registration. A new multi-atlas local weighted voting method was used to generate automatic contours and sCT results.  Results:   The mean error in Hounsfield units between the sCT and corresponding patient CT (within the body contour) was 0.6 ± 14.7 (mean ± 1 SD), with a mean absolute error of 40.5 ± 8.2 Hounsfield units.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the survival benefit of adding WPRT versus PO-RT for high-risk, node-negative prostate cancer, using the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB).  Methods and materials:   Patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated from 2004 to 2006, with available data for RT volume, coded as prostate and pelvis (WPRT) or prostate alone (PO-RT) were included. Multivariate analysis (MVA) and propensity-score matched analysis (PSM) were performed. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) based on overall survival (OS) using Gleason score (GS), T stage, and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was also conducted.  Results:   A total of 14,817 patients were included: 7606 (51.3%) received WPRT, and 7211 (48.7%) received PO-RT. The median follow-up time was 81 months (range, 2-122 months). Under MVA, the addition of WPRT for high-risk patients had no OS benefit compared with PO-RT (HR 1.05; P=.100). On subset analysis, patients receiving dose-escalated RT also did not benefit from WPRT (HR 1.01; P=.908). PSM confirmed no survival benefit with the addition of WPRT for high-risk patients (HR 1.05; P=.141). In addition, RPA was unable to demonstrate a survival benefit of WPRT for any subset.

To our knowledge it is unknown whether this cell shedding also occurs during minimally invasive prostatectomy, which minimizes tumor palpation and uses earlier vascular control. We tested the impact of robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy on intraoperative circulating tumor cell levels.  Materials and methods:   Circulating tumor cell counts were compared in peripheral blood specimens from 25 patients treated with robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy preoperatively vs intraoperatively after prostate excision, in addition to 11 healthy blood donors. Circulating tumor cell detection was performed using EpCAM immunomagnetic enrichment and multiparametric flow cytometry quantification of viable EpCAM positive/prostate specific membrane antigen positive/CD45 negative cells. Intraoperative cell counts and increases were tested in univariable analyses for associations with perioperative variables, histopathology and postoperative progression.  Results:   Circulating tumor cells were detected in 0% of healthy controls compared to 48% and 52% of prostatectomy cases preoperatively and intraoperatively, respectively (range 1 to 8 cells). There was no difference in the incidence or mean number of circulating tumor cells preoperatively vs intraoperatively. Of the patients 60% had no intraoperative change from preoperative levels. Intraoperative cell increases vs decreases were equally infrequent (each 20%) with no intraoperative increase greater than 1 circulating tumor cell. Intraoperative circulating tumor cell detection was not significantly associated with prostatectomy operative characteristics, histopathology or early postoperative progression at a median 21-month followup.  Conclusions:   Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy does not cause significant intraoperative increases in circulating tumor cells in contrast to historical reports of open prostatectomy. These findings may aid urologists in counseling candidates for robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy regarding the possibility of intraoperative tumor cell shedding.""","""['Eric C Kauffman', 'Min-Jung Lee', 'Sylvia V Alarcon', 'Sunmin Lee', 'Anthony N Hoang', 'Annerleim Walton Diaz', 'Raju Chelluri', 'Srinivas Vourganti', 'Jane B Trepel', 'Peter A Pinto']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['A comparison of the incidence and location of positive surgical margins in robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'A direct comparison of robotic assisted versus pure laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single institution experience.', 'Characteristics of positive surgical margins in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, open retropubic radical prostatectomy, and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a comparative histopathologic study from a single academic center.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: conventional and robotic.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Perioperative change of circulating tumor cells in cytoreductive radical prostatectomy for oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: the preliminary safety evidence from long-term oncologic outcomes.', 'Circulating Tumor Cell Detection by Liquid Biopsy during Early-Stage Endometrial Cancer Surgery: A Pilot Study.', 'Immunophenotype Rearrangement in Response to Tumor Excision May Be Related to the Risk of Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Therapeutic targeting of ATR yields durable regressions in small cell lung cancers with high replication stress.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictor of Treatment Response in Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

There are two isoforms of discoidin domain receptor (DDR), DDR1 and DDR2. These receptors play a major role in the adhesion, motility and cell proliferation. Due to the important role of DDR2 in the development of tumor extension, this receptor is pivotal in the field of carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the mRNA and protein expression of DDR2, in the malignant, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and normal tissues of patients with prostate cancer. In this study the gene and protein expression of DDR2 in adjacent normal (n=40), BPH (n=40), and malignant (n=40) prostate tissue were measured using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Then, the correlation of DDR2 gene and protein expression with prognostic factors such as age, tumor grade, tumor stage, lymph node involvement, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration were evaluated. The relative mRNA and protein expression level of DDR2 in malignant and benign prostate tissue was significantly higher than those of adjacent normal tissues (P<0.01). This expression was found to increase approximately 3.5 and 2.1 fold for mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Spearman test indicated a significant correlation between DDR2 mRNA and protein expression with prognostic factors such as tumor grade, stage, lymph node involvement, and serum PSA concentration. However, significant correlation with age was not observed.

The main function of this proteoglycan is the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis; however, more recently described roles for fibromodulin have expanded to include regulation of angiogenesis, reprogramming of human fibroblasts into pluripotent cells, modulation of TGF-β activity, inflammatory processes and association with metastatic phenotypes. Additionally, fibromodulin has been identified as a novel tumor-associated antigen in leukemia, lymphoma, and leiomyoma. Knowledge about its expression in the prostate is limited.  Methods:   Fibromodulin expression was analyzed in two different malignant and one non-tumorigenic prostatic cell lines in culture, and in benign and malignant human prostate tissue. Expression was analyzed by real time PCR, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. DNA sequencing was performed on a PCR fragment amplified with primers specific for the FMOD gene from cDNA obtained from the cultured cell lines.  Results:   Both immunostaining and real time PCR analysis of cell lines indicated that fibromodulin was differentially expressed in the cancerous cell lines compared to the non-tumorigenic cell line. Likewise, cancerous tissue expressed significantly higher levels of intracellular fibromodulin compared to matched, benign tissue from the same patients, as well as compared to tissue from patients with only benign disease.  Conclusions:   The expression of fibromodulin was higher in prostatic cancer cells (cell-lines and human tissue) than in normal/benign prostatic cells.

A patient specific target anatomy for seed placement is usually determined by contouring a set of collected transrectal ultrasound images prior to implantation. Standard-of-care in prostate brachytherapy is to delineate the clinical target anatomy, which closely follows the real prostate boundary. Subsequently, the boundary is dilated with respect to the clinical guidelines to determine a planning target volume. Manual contouring of these two anatomical targets is a tedious task with relatively high observer variability. In this work, we aim to reduce the segmentation variability and planning time by proposing an efficient learning-based multi-label segmentation algorithm. We incorporate a sparse representation approach in our methodology to learn a dictionary of sparse joint elements consisting of images, and clinical and planning target volume segmentation. The generated dictionary inherently captures the relationships among elements, which also incorporates the institutional clinical guidelines. The proposed multi-label segmentation method is evaluated on a dataset of 590 brachytherapy treatment records by 5-fold cross validation. We show clinically acceptable instantaneous segmentation results for both target volumes.""","""['Saman Nouranian', 'Mahdi Ramezani', 'Ingrid Spadinger', 'William J Morris', 'Septimu E Salcudean', 'Purang Abolmaesumi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['A multi-atlas-based segmentation framework for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prostate high-dose-rate brachytherapy: Transrectal ultrasound based planning, a technical note.', 'Semiautomatic 3-D prostate segmentation from TRUS images using spherical harmonics.', 'The role of transrectal ultrasound on prostatic cryotherapy and brachytherapy.', 'Prostate cancer treatment with radioactive seed implantation.', 'A Robust and Explainable Structure-Based Algorithm for Detecting the Organ Boundary From Ultrasound Multi-Datasets.', 'Exploring the Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Ultrasound Prostate Segmentation Using Adaptive Selection Principal Curve and Smooth Mathematical Model.', 'Artificial Intelligence and Its Impact on Urological Diseases and Management: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature.', 'Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Prostate Cancer Patient Management-Current Trends and Future Perspectives.']"""

However, the complex in vivo environment makes it challenging to employ PDX models to investigate tumor-stromal interactions, such as those that mediate prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis. Thus, we engineered a defined three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel system capable of supporting the co-culture of PCa PDX cells and osteoblastic cells to recapitulate the PCa-osteoblast unit within the bone metastatic microenvironment in vitro. Our 3D model not only maintained cell viability but also preserved the typical osteogenic phenotype of PCa PDX cells. Additionally, co-culture cellularity was maintained over that of either cell type cultured alone, suggesting that the PCa-osteoblast cross-talk supports PCa progression in bone, as is hypothesized to occur in patients with prostatic bone metastasis. Strikingly, osteoblastic cells co-cultured with PCa PDX tumoroids organized around the tumoroids, closely mimicking the architecture of PCa metastases in bone. Finally, tumor-stromal signaling mediated by the fibroblast growth factor axis tightly paralleled that in the in vivo counterpart. Together, these findings indicate that this 3D PCa PDX model recapitulates important pathological properties of PCa bone metastasis, and validate the use of this model for controlled and systematic interrogation of complex in vivo tumor-stromal interactions.""","""['Eliza L S Fong', 'Xinhai Wan', 'Jun Yang', 'Micaela Morgado', 'Antonios G Mikos', 'Daniel A Harrington', 'Nora M Navone', 'Mary C Farach-Carson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Prostate cancer cells induce osteoblast differentiation through a Cbfa1-dependent pathway.', 'Secretome analysis of an osteogenic prostate tumor identifies complex signaling networks mediating cross-talk of cancer and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment.', 'Prostate cancer cell-stromal cell crosstalk via FGFR1 mediates antitumor activity of dovitinib in bone metastases.', 'New targets for therapy in prostate cancer: modulation of stromal-epithelial interactions.', 'Application of Prostate Cancer Models for Preclinical Study: Advantages and Limitations of Cell Lines, Patient-Derived Xenografts, and Three-Dimensional Culture of Patient-Derived Cells.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'Establishment and Characterization of Patient-Derived Xenograft Model of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Derived from Malignant Pleural Effusions.', 'GelMA, Click-Chemistry Gelatin and Bioprinted Polyethylene Glycol-Based Hydrogels as 3D Ex Vivo Drug Testing Platforms for Patient-Derived Breast Cancer Organoids.', 'Nano-Hydroxyapatite/PLGA Mixed Scaffolds as a Tool for Drug Development and to Study Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Bone.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.']"""

DNA-methyltransferases (DNMTs), which catalyze the transfer of methyl-groups to CpG islands of gene promoters, are overactive in cancers and can be inhibited by DNMT-inhibitors to re-express the tumor suppressors. The FDA-approved nucleoside DNMT-inhibitors like 5-Azacytidine and 5-Aza-deoxycytidine carry notable concerns due to their off-target toxicity, therefore non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors are desirable for prolonged epigenetic therapy. Disulfiram (DSF), an antabuse drug, inhibits DNMT and prevents proliferation of cells in prostate and other cancers, plausibly through the re-expression of tumor suppressors like ER-β. To increase the DNMT-inhibitory activity of DSF, its chemical scaffold was optimized and compound-339 was discovered as a doubly potent DSF-derivative with similar off-target toxicity. It potently and selectively inhibited cell proliferation of prostate cancer (PC3/DU145) cells in comparison to normal (non-cancer) cells by promoting cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, accompanied with inhibition of total DNMT activity, and re-expression of ER-β (mRNA/protein). Bisulfite-sequencing of ER-β promoter revealed that compound-339 demethylated CpG sites more efficaciously than DSF, restoring near-normal methylation status of ER-β promoter. Compound-339 docked on to the MTase domain of DNMT1 with half the energy of DSF. In xenograft mice-model, the tumor volume regressed by 24% and 50% after treatment with DSF and compound-339, respectively, with increase in ER-β expression. Apparently both compounds inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation by re-expressing the epigenetically repressed tumor-suppressor ER-β through inhibition of DNMT activity.

Elevated expression of CXCR4, and its ligand CXCL12, play important roles in promoting cancer metastasis. Cancer cells have the potential for rapid and unlimited growth in an area that may have restricted blood supply, as oxidative stress is a common feature of solid tumors. Recent studies have reported that enhanced expression of cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a critical enzyme responsible for regulation of superoxide radicals, may increase the aggressive and invasive potential of malignant cells in some cancers.  Methods:   We used a variety of biochemical approaches and a prostate cancer cell line to study the effects of SOD1 on CXCR4 signaling.  Results:   Here, we report a direct interaction between SOD1 and CXCR4. We showed that SOD1 interacts directly with the first intracellular loop (ICL1) of CXCR4 and that the CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated regulation of AKT activation, apoptosis and cell migration in prostate cancer (PCa) cells is differentially modulated under normal versus hypoxic conditions when SOD1 is present.

So far, only basic health care is provided. Here we analyzed the cancer mortality in this region as a first step towards epidemiological data for cancer prevention.  Methods:   We calculated the age-adjusted mortality rates according to world standard (AMRWs) for the major cancer sites in both males and females between 2003 and 2012, and estimated the differences between the capital and more central districts of Itapúa vs. remote districts.  Results:   There were about 2000 cancer deaths in the decade studied, with AMRWs for all malignancies of 90.9/100,000 in males from central vs. 49.1/100,000 in remote districts and 69.0/100,000 vs. 45.0/100,000 in women. Cancer was mentioned in 12.4% of all death certificates and outweighed mortality from certain infectious and parasitic diseases (3.6%). Cause of death was ill-defined in 19.6% of all death certificates, especially in remote regions and among the elderly. The part of cancer located in the uterus (47.8%) or cell type of neoplasm of the lymphatic or hematopoietic system (73.1%) were often not specified. The uterus (mainly the cervix) (C53-C55) was the leading cancer site in women with AMRWs of 17.2/100,000 in central and 14.0/100,000 in remote districts, followed by the breast. Lung and prostate were the leading cancer sites among men. The lung cancer mortality rate was 19.3/100,000 in the central region but 9.5/100,000 in remote districts. Although children comprised 36% of the population, only 24 death certificates listed cancer as cause of death in this decade.  Conclusions:   Analysis of cancer mortality in this rural region of Paraguay, which lacks resources for diagnostics and care, revealed an already large number of cases, with higher rates in the central region than in remote districts. Lung and uterus (primarily the cervix) are common cancer sites and indicate the potential for prevention. However, the quality of the vital statistics needs to be improved. The true cancer burden is most likely underestimated, especially in remote regions and children.""","""['Manuel Codas', 'Beate Pesch', 'Madita Adolphs', 'Carolina Madrazo', 'Cristian Matthias', 'Evelyn Heinze', 'Dirk Taeger', 'Thomas Behrens', 'Alcides Chaux', 'Thomas Brüning']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['State of health of populations residing in geothermal areas of Tuscany.', 'Analysis of cancer incidence and mortality in Henan province, 2009.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Excess Mortality from Mental, Neurological, and Substance Use Disorders in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.', 'On the Remote Cause of Epidemic Diseases.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate distribution features of bone metastases in pulmonary and prostate cancers. Bone scintigraphies were performed in 460 patients with pulmonary cancer and 144 patients with prostate cancer. Patients were divided into three groups according to the total number of bone metastases: few bone metastases, moderate bone metastases, and extensive bone metastases. We compared the distribution of bone metastases in the two cancers, and analyzed the relationship between the distribution of metastatic lesions and their metastatic patterns. A total of 2279 and 2000 lesions of bone metastases were detected in 258 patients with pulmonary cancer and 102 patients with prostate cancer, respectively. In patients with few bone metastases, the distributions of metastatic lesions in the vertebrae (χ2 = 16.0, P = 0.000) and thoracic bones (χ2 = 20.7, P = 0.002) were significantly different between pulmonary and prostate cancers. In cases with moderate bone metastases, the distributions in the vertebrae (χ2 = 6.6, P = 0.010), pelvis (χ2 = 15.1 P = 0.000), and thoracic bones (χ2 = 38.8, P = 0.000) were also significantly different between the two cancers. However, in patients with extensive bone metastases, the distributions were very similar. As the total number of bone metastases increased, their distribution in pulmonary cancer did not noticeably change, but the distribution in the vertebrae and thoracic bones of prostate cancer patients significantly changed. Accordingly, the distribution characteristics of bone metastases differed in pulmonary and prostate cancers, mainly in the early stages of metastasis.""","""['Changyin Wang', 'Ying Shen', 'Shaobo Zhu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Study on the distribution features of bone metastases in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical features of pathologically confirmed metastatic bone tumors--a report of 390 cases.', 'Pattern and distribution of bone metastases in common malignant tumors.', 'Bone metastasis from prostate cancer.', 'Bone metastases: Part I--Pathophysiology.', 'Palliative Arterial Embolization for Metastases of the Sternum.', 'Automatic identification of suspicious bone metastatic lesions in bone scintigraphy using convolutional neural network.', 'A MYC and RAS co-activation signature in localized prostate cancer drives bone metastasis and castration resistance.', 'Features of Spinal Metastases: A Retrospective View.', 'Patterns of Bone Failure in Localized Prostate Cancer Previously Irradiated: The Preventive Role of External Radiotherapy on Pelvic Bone Metastases.']"""

Participants were men referred for a trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy because of an elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) level or abnormal findings on digital rectal examination. Urine samples were collected from patients with prostate cancer (n = 59) and cancer-free controls (n = 43), on the day of their biopsy, prior to their procedure. VOCs from the headspace of basified urine samples were extracted using solid-phase micro-extraction and analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Classifiers were developed using Random Forest (RF) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification techniques. PSA alone had an accuracy of 62-64% in these samples. A model based on 4 VOCs, 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol, pentanal, 3-octanone, and 2-octanone, was marginally more accurate 63-65%. When combined, PSA level and these four VOCs had mean accuracies of 74% and 65%, using RF and LDA, respectively. With repeated double cross-validation, the mean accuracies fell to 71% and 65%, using RF and LDA, respectively. Results from VOC profiling of urine headspace are encouraging and suggest that there are other metabolomic avenues worth exploring which could help improve the stratification of men at risk of prostate cancer.

Human testis have a glandular function as a part of the reproductive and the endocrine system, but no data are available on SPs in human testis and prostate under healthy and pathologic conditions.  Objective:   The aim of the study was the detection and characterization of the surfactant proteins A, B, C and D (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D) in human testis. Additionally tissue samples affected by testicular cancer were investigated.  Results:   Surfactant proteins A, B, C and D were detected using RT-PCR in healthy testis. By means of Western blot analysis, these SPs were detected at the protein level in normal testis, seminoma and seminal fluid, but not in spermatozoa. Expression of SPs was weaker in seminoma compared to normal testicular tissue. SPs were localized in combination with vimentin immunohistochemically in cells of Sertoli and Leydig.  Conclusion:   Surfactant proteins seem to be inherent part of the human testis. By means of physicochemical properties the proteins appear to play a role during immunological and rheological process of the testicular tissue. The presence of SP-B and SP-C in cells of Sertoli correlates with their function of fluid secretion and may support transportation of spermatozoa. In seminoma the expression of all SP's was generally weaker compared to normal germ cells.

As TRIM59 has been reported to act as a proto-oncogene that affects both Ras and RB signal pathways in prostate cancer models, we here focused on the role of TRIM59 in the regulation of NSCLC cell proliferation and migration. We reported that TRIM59 protein was significantly increased in various NSCLC cell lines. SiRNA-induced knocking down of TRIM59 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of NSCLC cell lines by arresting cell cycle in G2 phase. Moreover, TRIM59 knocking down affected the expression of a number of cell cycle proteins including CDC25C and CDK1. Finally, we knocked down TRIM59 and found that p53 protein expression levels did not upregulate, so we proposed that TRIM59 may promote NSCLC cell growth through other pathways but not the p53 signaling pathway.""","""['Weihua Zhan', 'Tianyu Han', 'Chenfu Zhang', 'Caifeng Xie', 'Mingxi Gan', 'Keyu Deng', 'Mingui Fu', 'Jian-Bin Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['TRIM59 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'TRIM59 is up-regulated in gastric tumors, promoting ubiquitination and degradation of p53.', 'TRIM59 is upregulated and promotes cell proliferation and migration in human osteosarcoma.', 'COMMD9 promotes TFDP1/E2F1 transcriptional activity via interaction with TFDP1 in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Progress of SLFN family proteins in tumor and virus infection.', 'Cross talk between tumor stemness and microenvironment for prognosis and immunotherapy of uveal melanoma.', 'TRIM4 Expression Related to Malignant Progression and Cisplatin Resistance in Osteosarcoma.', 'Pan-cancer illumination of TRIM gene family reveals immunology regulation and potential therapeutic implications.', 'TRIM family contribute to tumorigenesis, cancer development, and drug resistance.', 'TRIM66 Promotes Malignant Progression of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells via Targeting MMP9.']"""

By means of a pilot study, we aim to test the ability of the 4KsT to identify HGPC in prostate biopsies (Bx) and compare the test with other multivariate prognostic models such as the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator 2.0 (PCPTRC 2.0) and the European Research Screening Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator 4 (ERSPC-RC 4).  Material and methods:   Fifty-one patients underwent a prostate Bx according to standard clinical practice, with a minimum of 10 cores. The diagnosis of HGPC was agreed upon by 4 uropathologists. We compared the predictions from the various models by using the Mann-Whitney U test, area under the ROC curve (AUC) (DeLong test), probability density function (PDF), box plots and clinical utility curves.  Results:   Forty-three percent of the patients had PC, and 23.5% had HGPC. The medians of probability for the 4KsT, PCPTRC 2.0 and ERSPC-RC 4 were significantly different between the patients with HGPC and those without HGPC (p≤.022) and were more differentiated in the case of 4KsT (51.5% for HGPC [25-75 percentile: 25-80.5%] vs. 16% [P 25-75: 8-26.5%] for non-HGPC; p=.002). All models presented AUCs above 0.7, with no significant differences between any of them and 4KsT (p≥.20). The PDF and box plots showed good discriminative ability, especially in the ERSPC-RC 4 and 4KsT models. The utility curves showed how a cutoff of 9% for 4KsT identified all cases of HGPC and provided a 22% savings in biopsies, which is similar to what occurs with the ERSPC-RC 4 models and a cutoff of 3%.  Conclusions:   The assessed predictive models offer good discriminative ability for HGPCs in Bx. The 4KsT is a good classification model as a whole, followed by ERSPC-RC 4 and PCPTRC 2.0. The clinical utility curves help suggest cutoff points for clinical decisions: 9% for 4KsT and 3% for ERSPC-RC 4.

PAK6, which is overexpressed in prostate cancer, was recently reported to localize to cell-cell adhesions and to drive epithelial cell colony escape. Here we report that PAK6 targeting to cell-cell adhesions occurs through its N-terminus, requiring both its Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain and an adjacent polybasic region for maximal targeting efficiency. We find PAK6 localization to cell-cell adhesions is Cdc42-dependent, as Cdc42 knockdown inhibits PAK6 targeting to cell-cell adhesions. We further find the ability of PAK6 to drive epithelial cell colony escape requires kinase activity and is disrupted by mutations that perturb PAK6 cell-cell adhesion targeting. Finally, we demonstrate that all type II PAKs (PAK4, PAK5 and PAK6) target to cell-cell adhesions, albeit to differing extents, but PAK1 (a type I PAK) does not. Notably, the ability of a PAK isoform to drive epithelial colony escape correlates with its targeting to cell-cell adhesions.

To our knowledge the resultant effect of conflicting recommendations and disparities in access to care on prostate specific antigen screening in black men is unknown.  Materials and methods:   We compared the rate of self-reported prostate specific antigen screening in black men relative to that in nonHispanic white men. The BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) 2012 data set was used to identify asymptomatic men 40 to 99 years old who reported undergoing prostate specific antigen screening in the last 12 months. Age, education, income, residence location, marital status, health insurance, regular access to a health care provider and a health care provider recommendation to undergo screening were extracted. Subgroup analyses by race and age were performed using complex samples logistic regression models to assess the odds of undergoing prostate specific antigen screening.  Results:   In 2012 there were 122,309 survey respondents (weighted estimate 54.5 million) in the study population, of whom 29% of black and 32% of nonHispanic white men reported undergoing prostate specific antigen screening. Younger black males had higher rates and odds of screening than nonHispanic white men of a similar age (ages 45 to 49, 50 to 54 and 55 to 59 years OR 1.66, 1.58 and 1.36, respectively). Among black men only a higher education level (graduates vs nongraduates OR 2.12), regular access to a health care provider (OR 2.05) and a health care provider recommendation for screening (OR 8.43) were independently associated with prostate specific antigen screening.  Conclusions:   Despite long-standing disparities in health care access black males 45 to 60 years old have a higher rate and probability of prostate specific antigen screening than nonHispanic white men. Among black men educational attainment had a more pronounced association. In contrast the association with health care provider recommendations was less pronounced relative to that in nonHispanic white men.

Incidental prostatic uptake is often found on FDG-PET/CT. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical relevance of incidental prostatic uptake on FDG-PET/CT.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed 108 consecutive male patients with bladder cancer who underwent FDG-PET/CT and subsequently radical cystoprostatectomy between May 2009 and November 2014. PET/CT scans were blindly reviewed by a dedicated nuclear medicine physician for incidental prostatic FDG uptake. If present, the maximum standardized uptake value was determined. Subsequently incidental prostatic uptake was categorized as suspect, indeterminate or nonsuspect for prostate cancer.  Results:   Incidental prostatic uptake was present in 43 of 108 patients (40%). Of these 43 patients 13 (30%) had occult prostate cancer in cystoprostatectomy specimens. Overall prostate cancer was found in 25 of 108 specimens (23%). If all incidental prostatic uptake was regarded as prostate cancer, the sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET/CT for prostate cancer detection were 52% and 64%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 30% and 82%, respectively. If only lesions labeled suspect or indeterminate were regarded as prostate cancer, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 32%, 76%, 29% and 79%, respectively. Categorizing indeterminate lesions as nonprostate cancer did not improve diagnostic accuracy.

The open approach is still the standard method. Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery offers advantages that are applicable to partial nephrectomy, such as the use of the Firefly® system with near-infrared fluorescence.  Objective:   To demonstrate the implementation of fluorescence in nephron-sparing surgery.  Case report:   This case concerned a 37-year-old female smoker, with obesity. The patient had a right kidney tumour measuring 31 mm, which was found using tomography. She therefore underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, with a warm ischaemia time of 22 minutes and the use of fluorescence with the Firefly® system to guide the resection. There were no complications. The tumour was a pT1aN0M0 renal cell carcinoma, with negative margins. Robot-assisted renal laparoscopic surgery is employed for nephron-sparing surgery, with good oncological and functional results. The combination of the Firefly® technology and intraoperative ultrasound can more accurately delimit the extent of the lesion, increase the negative margins and decrease the ischaemia time.  Conclusion:   Near-infrared fluorescence in robot-assisted partial nephrectomy is useful for guiding the tumour resection and can potentially improve the oncological and functional results.""","""['V Cornejo-Dávila', 'M Nazmy Jr', 'N Kella', 'M A Palmeros-Rodríguez', 'J G Morales-Montor', 'C Pacheco-Gahbler']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with hydrodissection.', 'Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy: Superiority over laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.', 'Occlusion angiography using intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan (CEUS): a novel technique demonstrating segmental renal blood supply to assist zero-ischaemia robot-assisted partial nephrectomy.', 'Intraoperative Imaging Techniques to Support Complete Tumor Resection in Partial Nephrectomy.', ""What's new in robotic partial nephrectomy."", 'Intraoperative assessment and postsurgical treatment of prostate cancer tumors using tumor-targeted nanoprobes.', 'Percutaneous hook wire assistance during laparoscopic excision of an intrarenal mass.', ""Urological technology: where will we be in 20 years' time?""]"""

Metabolites, which are the terminal products of cellular regulatory process, can be affected by multi-omic processes. In this work, we propose a powerful method, MetPriCNet, to predict and prioritize disease candidate metabolites based on integrated multi-omics information. MetPriCNet prioritized candidate metabolites based on their global distance similarity with seed nodes in a composite network, which integrated multi-omics information from the genome, phenome, metabolome and interactome. After performing cross-validation on 87 phenotypes with a total of 602 metabolites, MetPriCNet achieved a high AUC value of up to 0.918. We also assessed the performance of MetPriCNet on 18 disease classes and found that 4 disease classes achieved an AUC value over 0.95. Notably, MetPriCNet can also predict disease metabolites without known disease metabolite knowledge. Some new high-risk metabolites of breast cancer were predicted, although there is a lack of known disease metabolite information. A predicted disease metabolic landscape was constructed and analyzed based on the results of MetPriCNet for 87 phenotypes to help us understand the genetic and metabolic mechanism of disease from a global view.""","""['Qianlan Yao', 'Yanjun Xu', 'Haixiu Yang', 'Desi Shang', 'Chunlong Zhang', 'Yunpeng Zhang', 'Zeguo Sun', 'Xinrui Shi', 'Li Feng', 'Junwei Han', 'Fei Su', 'Chunquan Li', 'Xia Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Deciphering the Core Metabolites of Fanconi Anemia by Using a Multi-Omics Composite Network.', 'Prioritizing candidate diseases-related metabolites based on literature and functional similarity.', 'Global Prioritizing Disease Candidate lncRNAs via a Multi-level Composite Network.', ""Trans-Omics: How To Reconstruct Biochemical Networks Across Multiple 'Omic' Layers."", 'Metabolome 2.0: quantitative genetics and network biology of metabolic phenotypes.', 'MultiNEP: a multi-omics network enhancement framework for prioritizing disease genes and metabolites simultaneously.', 'Multi-omics profiling approach in food allergy.', 'Integrated Analysis of Gut Microbiome and Lipid Metabolism in Mice Infected with Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae.', 'Deciphering the Core Metabolites of Fanconi Anemia by Using a Multi-Omics Composite Network.', 'Interpretation of network-based integration from multi-omics longitudinal data.']"""

We report the mid-term oncological and functional results of primary hemiablation high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in a prospective cohort of patients.  Methods:   Over 8 years, hemiablation HIFU was primarily performed in 50 selected patients with biopsy-proven clinically localized unilateral, low-intermediate risk prostate cancer in complete concordance with the prostate cancer lesions identified by magnetic resonance imaging with precise loci matching on multimodal approach. Post-treatment follow-up included regular serial PSA measurements. Biochemical recurrence was reported using Stuttgart and Phoenix criteria. The latter was used as a threshold to offer whole-gland biopsies.  Results:   Complete follow-up was available for all patients and the median follow-up was 39.5 months (range: 6-94). Mean nadir PSA value was 1.6 ng ml(-1), which represents 72% reduction compared with initial PSA pre-treatment value (P<0.001). Median time to achieve PSA nadir was 3 months. Biochemical recurrence, according to Phoenix and Stuttgart definition, occurred in 28 and 36% of patients, respectively. The 5-year actuarial metastases-free survival, cancer-specific survival and overall survival rates were 93, 100 and 87%, respectively. Out of the eight patients undergoing biopsy, six patients had a positive biopsy for cancer occurring in the untreated contralateral (n=3) or treated ipsilateral lobe (n=1) or bilaterally (n=2). A Clavien-Dindo grade 3b complication occurred in two patients. Complete continence (no pads) and erection sufficient for intercourse were documented in 94 or 80% of patients, respectively.  Conclusion:   Hemiablation HIFU therapy, delivered with intention to treat, for carefully selected patients affords mid-term promising functional and oncological outcomes.

MR-only treatment planning approaches have been developed to avoid errors introduced during the MR-CT registration process. The purpose of this study is to evaluate calculated dose distributions after incorporating a novel synthetic CT (synCT) derived from magnetic resonance simulation images into prostate cancer treatment planning and to compare dose distributions calculated using three previously published MR-only treatment planning methodologies.  Methods:   An IRB-approved retrospective study evaluated 15 prostate cancer patients that underwent IMRT (n = 11) or arc therapy (n = 4) to a total dose of 70.2-79.2 Gy. Original treatment plans were derived from CT simulation images (CT-SIM). T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and balanced turbo field echo images were acquired on a 1.0 T high field open MR simulator with patients immobilized in treatment position. Four MR-derived images were studied: bulk density assignment (10 HU) to water (MRW), bulk density assignments to water and bone with pelvic bone values derived either from literature (491 HU, MRW+B491) or from CT-SIM population average bone values (300 HU, MRW+B300), and synCTs. Plans were recalculated using fixed monitor units, plan dosimetry was evaluated, and local dose differences were characterized using gamma analysis (1 %/1 mm dose difference/distance to agreement).  Results:   While synCT provided closest agreement to CT-SIM for D95, D99, and mean dose (<0.7 Gy (1 %)) compared to MRW, MRW+B491, and MRW+B300, pairwise comparisons showed differences were not significant (p < 0.05). Significant improvements were observed for synCT in the bladder, but not for rectum or penile bulb. SynCT gamma analysis pass rates (97.2 %) evaluated at 1 %/1 mm exceeded those from MRW (94.7 %), MRW+B300 (94.0 %), or MRW+B491 (90.4 %). One subject's synCT gamma (1 %/1 mm) results (89.9 %) were lower than MRW (98.7 %) and MRW+B300 (96.7 %) due to increased rectal gas during MR-simulation that did not affect bulk density assignment-based calculations but was reflected in higher rectal doses for synCT.  Conclusions:   SynCT values provided closest dosimetric and gamma analysis agreement to CT-SIM compared to bulk density assignment-based CT surrogates. SynCTs may provide additional clinical value in treatment sites with greater air-to-soft tissue ratio.""","""['Joshua Kim', 'Kim Garbarino', 'Lonni Schultz', 'Kenneth Levin', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'M Salim Siddiqui', 'Indrin J Chetty', 'Carri Glide-Hurst']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Implementation of a novel algorithm for generating synthetic CT images from magnetic resonance imaging data sets for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of synthetic CT for magnetic resonance-only based radiotherapy planning of lung cancer.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of magnetic resonance-generated synthetic CT for radiation treatment of rectal cancer.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'A review of substitute CT generation for MRI-only radiation therapy.', 'Dose accumulation for MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy: From practical considerations to state-of-the-art clinical implementation.', 'A pilot study of same-day MRI-only simulation and treatment with MR-guided adaptive palliative radiotherapy (MAP-RT).', 'Quality assurance for MRI-only radiation therapy: A voxel-wise population-based methodology for image and dose assessment of synthetic CT generation methods.', 'Emergence of MR-Linac in Radiation Oncology: Successes and Challenges of Riding on the MRgRT Bandwagon.', 'Dosimetric Accuracy of MR-Guided Online Adaptive Planning for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiotherapy on 1.5 T MR-Linac.']"""

Using an analytical framework inspired by Science and Technology Studies and Feminist Technoscience, I describe the interplay between machines and bodies and the implications of materialities and agency. I argue that patients' bodies play a part in producing scans within acceptable limits of machines as set out through organisational arrangements. In doing so I argue that bodies are fabricated into the order of work prescribed and embedded within and around the CBCT system, becoming, not only the subject of resulting images, but part of that image. The scan is not therefore a representation of a passive subject (a body) but co-produced by the work of practitioners and patients who actively control (and contort) and discipline their body according to protocols and instructions and the CBCT system. In this way I suggest they are 'con-forming' the CBCT image.

We examined the potential social discrepancies in the access of LTA and EM.  Materials and methods:   A total of 1860 patients with cT1a kidney cancer who had undergone either LTA (n = 553) or EM (n = 1307) from 2000 to 2009 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. The baseline patient data (age, comorbidity status, defined as Charlson comorbidity index [CCI], and several sociodemographic variables) and tumor characteristics were examined. A multivariable analysis predicting access to LTA compared with EM was fitted. The subgroup analyses focused on patients aged ≥ 75 years with a CCI of ≥ 2.  Results:   Compared with LTA patients, the EM patients were significantly older (median age, 78 vs. 77 years; P < .001), more frequently unmarried (43% vs. 37%; P = .02), more frequently of African-American ethnicity (14% vs. 8%; P = .005), and more frequently of low socioeconomic status (SES; 55% vs. 46%; P = .001). No differences were seen according to gender, population density, CCI, or tumor size. In a multivariable analysis predicting access to LTA over EM, older age, African-American ethnicity, male gender, low SES, and unmarried status were associated with lower access to LTA (P ≤ .04 for all). In the subgroup of older and sicker patients, none of the previous sociodemographic characteristics represented barriers to LTA access (P ≥ .1 for all).  Conclusion:   Sociodemographic characteristics might represent barriers to LTA access for patients with SRMs managed nonoperatively.

The aim of this study is to explore the within- and between-country variability of cancer incidence to motivate high-quality ecologic studies. We extracted age-standardized incidence rate estimates (world standard population) from 135 regions for the ten most frequent invasive cancers in Europe for non-Hispanic white populations from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, Volume X. We fitted weighted multilevel Poisson regression models with random country effects for each cancer and sex. We estimated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A high ICC indicates a low within- and a high between-country variability of rates. The two cancer sites with the highest ICC among men were prostate cancer (0.96, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99) and skin melanoma (0.78, 0.64-0.93). Among women, high ICCs were observed for lung cancer (0.84, 0.73-0.95) and breast cancer (0.80, 0.69-0.91). The two most prominent sex differences for ICC occurred for cancers of the head and neck (men: 0.70, 0.55-0.85, women: 0.19, 0.08-0.30) and breast cancer (men: 0.04, 0.01-0.07, women: 0.80, 0.69-0.91).

We describe the first label-free real-time ultra-high frequency acoustic wave biosensor prototype capable of detecting the breast and prostate cancer metastasis biomarker, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). Two different linkers - 11-trichlorosilyl-undecanoic acid pentafluorophenyl ester (PFP) and S-(11-trichlorosilyl-undecanyl)-benzothiosulfonate (TUBTS) - were used to immobilize whole anti-PTHrP antibodies and Fab' fragments to surfaces as biorecognition elements. The biosensor surfaces were optimized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the ultra-high frequency electromagnetic piezoelectric acoustic sensor (EMPAS). One optimized whole antibody-based surface (PFP/protein G'/whole antibodies/ethanolamine) and one optimized Fab' fragment-based surface (TUBTS/Fab' fragments) were tested as biosensors. It was determined that an in-line injection of bovine serum albumin prior to analyte injection yielded the most minimally fouling surfaces. Each surface was tested with no mass amplification and with sandwich-type secondary antibody mass amplification.

The PCA3 long non-coding RNA is a unique PCa biomarker and oncogene that has been widely studied. This gene has been mainly exploited as an accurate diagnostic urine biomarker for PCa detection. In this study, the PCA3 promoter was introduced into a new transcriptional amplification system named the 3-Step Transcriptional Amplification System (PCA3-3STA) and cloned into type 5 adenovirus. PCA3-3STA activity was highly specific for PCa cells, ranging between 98.7- and 108.0-fold higher than that for benign primary prostate epithelial or non-PCa cells, respectively. In human PCa xenografts, PCA3-3STA displayed robust bioluminescent signals at levels that are sufficient to translate to positron emission tomography (PET)-based reporter imaging. Remarkably, when freshly isolated benign or cancerous prostate biopsies were infected with PCA3-3STA, the optical signal produced from primary PCa biopsies was significantly higher than from benign prostate biopsies (4.4-fold, p < 0.0001). PCA3-3STA therefore represents a PCa-specific expression system with the potential to target, with high accuracy, primary or metastatic PCa epithelial cells for imaging, vaccines, or gene therapy.""","""['Bertrand Neveu', 'Pallavi Jain', 'Bernard Têtu', 'Lily Wu', 'Yves Fradet', 'Frédéric Pouliot']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Development of a Transcriptional Amplification System Based on the PEG3 Promoter to Target Androgen Receptor-Positive and -Negative Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Differential display code 3 (DD3/PCA3) in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Evaluation of a short RNA within Prostate Cancer Gene 3 in the predictive role for future cancer using non-malignant prostate biopsies.', 'New targets for therapy in prostate cancer: differential display code 3 (DD3(PCA3)), a highly prostate cancer-specific gene.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Sex steroid modulation of macrophages within the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'A transcriptional biosensor to monitor single cancer cell therapeutic responses by bioluminescence microscopy.', 'Using ex vivo culture to assess dynamic phenotype changes in human prostate macrophages following exposure to therapeutic drugs.', 'p38 MAPK Inhibition Mitigates Hypoxia-Induced AR Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

We investigate whether mode of detection, i.e. 'PSA detected' or 'clinically detected', was associated with psychological wellbeing among prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   A cross-sectional postal questionnaire was administered in 2012 to 6559 prostate cancer (ICD10 C61) survivors up to 18 years post-diagnosis, identified through population-based cancer registries in Ireland. Psychological wellbeing was assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between mode of detection and depression, anxiety and stress, adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical confounders.  Results:   The response rate was 54 % (3348/6262). Fifty-nine percent of survivors were diagnosed with asymptomatic PSA-tested disease. Prevalence of depression (13.8 vs 20.7 %; p < 0.001), anxiety (13.6 vs 20.9 %; p < 0.001) and stress (8.7 vs 13.8 %; p < 0.001) were significantly lower among survivors diagnosed with PSA-detected, than clinically detected disease. After adjusting for clinical and socio-demographic factors, survivors with clinically detected disease had significantly higher risk of depression (odds ratio (OR) = 1.46 95 % CI 1.18, 1.80; p = 0.001), anxiety (OR = 1.36 95 % CI 1.09, 1.68; p = 0.006) and stress (OR = 1.43 95 % CI 1.11, 1.85; p = 0.006) than survivors with PSA-detected disease.  Conclusions:   These findings contribute to the ongoing debate on benefits and risks of PSA testing and may be considered by policy makers formulating population-based prostate cancer screening policies. The relatively high prevalence of negative psychological states among survivors means that a 'risk-adapted approach' should be implemented to screen survivors most at risk of psychological morbidity for psychological health, and mode of detection could be considered as a risk stratum.""","""['Frances J Drummond', ""Eamonn O'Leary"", 'Anna Gavin', 'Heather Kinnear', 'Linda Sharp']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Cancer-related symptoms predict psychological wellbeing among prostate cancer survivors: results from the PiCTure study.', 'Establishing a population-based patient-reported outcomes study (PROMs) using national cancer registries across two jurisdictions: the Prostate Cancer Treatment, your experience (PiCTure) study.', 'The influence of stress, depression, and anxiety on PSA screening rates in a nationally representative sample.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Benefits and Harms of Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence Update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'A cost analysis of a community-based support centre for cancer patients and their families in Ireland: the EVeCANs study.', 'Pain, fatigue and depression symptom cluster in survivors of prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life among symptomatic compared to PSA-detected prostate cancer survivors - results from a UK wide patient-reported outcomes study.', 'What predicts emotional response in men awaiting prostate biopsy?']"""

Focal dose escalation to the dominant intraprostatic lesions (DIPL) may lead to improved PCA control. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in most PCAs. (68)Ga-labelled PSMA inhibitors have demonstrated promising results in detection of PCA with PET/CT. The aim of this study was to compare (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT with MRI for gross tumour volume (GTV) definition in primary PCA.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 22 patients with primary PCA analysed after (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI. GTVs were delineated on MR images by two radiologists (GTV-MRIrad) and two radiation oncologists separately. Both volumes were merged leading to GTV-MRIint. GTVs based on PET/CT were delineated by two nuclear medicine physicians in consensus (GTV-PET). Laterality (left, right, and left and right prostate lobes) on mpMRI, PET/CT and pathological analysis after biopsy were assessed.  Results:   Mean GTV-MRIrad, GTV-MRIint and GTV-PET were 5.92, 3.83 and 11.41 cm(3), respectively. GTV-PET was significant larger then GTV-MRIint (p = 0.003).

Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted on men age 50years and older in Southeastern Michigan pre (n=3647) and post (n=3618) USPSTF recommendation. PSA screening, transrectal ultrasound, and prostate biopsy rates were evaluated pre/post using a generalized piecewise linear model with a Poisson distribution, and log link. A knot was placed at year 2011 to estimate pre/post slope coefficients. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the marginal probability of a prostate diagnosis as a logistic function of pre and post-period, and comorbidities.  Results:   PSA utilization significantly increased (β=0.28; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.31) during the pre-period, but significantly decreased in the post-period (β=-0.29; 95% CI: -0.34, -0.25).

However, if some studies identified estrogens as causative agents of PCa, others indicated that these steroids have a protective role counteracting prostate overgrowth. The tyrosine kinase receptor c-KIT and its ligand, the stem cell factor (SCF), have been associated with the control of cell proliferation/apoptosis and prostate carcinogenesis, and studies show that estrogens regulate their expression in different tissues, though, in the case of prostate this remains unknown. The present study aims to evaluate the role of 17β-estradiol (E2) in regulating the expression of SCF/c-KIT in human prostate cell lines and rat prostate, and to investigate the consequent effects on prostate cell proliferation and apoptosis. qPCR, Western Blot, and immuno(cito)histochemistry analysis showed that E2-treatment decreased the expression of SCF and c-KIT both in human prostate cells and rat prostate. Furthermore, the diminished expression of SCF/c-KIT was underpinned by the diminished prostate weight and reduced proliferation index. On the other hand, the results of TUNEL labelling, the increased activity of caspase-3, and the augmented expression of caspase-8 and Fas system in the prostate of E2-treated animals indicated augmented apoptosis in response to E2. The obtained results demonstrated that E2 down-regulated the expression of SCF/c-KIT system in prostate cells, which was associated with antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. Moreover, these findings support the protective role of estrogens in PCa and open new perspectives on the application of estrogen-based therapies.""","""['Marília I Figueira', 'Sara Correia', 'Cátia V Vaz', 'Henrique J Cardoso', 'Inês M Gomes', 'Ricardo Marques', 'Cláudio J Maia', 'Sílvia Socorro']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Estrogenic regulation of testicular expression of stem cell factor and c-kit: implications in germ cell survival and male fertility.', 'Glutamate-induced apoptosis in primary cortical neurons is inhibited by equine estrogens via down-regulation of caspase-3 and prevention of mitochondrial cytochrome c release.', 'The stem cell factor/c-kit receptor pathway enhances proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells.', 'The stem cell factor (SCF)/c-KIT system in carcinogenesis of reproductive tissues: What does the hormonal regulation tell us?', 'Hormonal regulation of c-KIT receptor and its ligand: implications for human infertility?', 'Tissue distribution of stem cell factor in adults.', 'The effect of mast cells on the biological characteristics of prostate cancer cells.']"""

We evaluated TRPM4 protein expression and correlated the expression level with biochemical recurrence (BR) following radical prostatectomy (RP).  Material and methods:   The study included 614 patients who had undergone RP. TRPM4 immunohistochemical staining was performed on samples of benign tissue, tissue containing PIN glands and PCa tissue using a commercially available polyclonal antibody. Staining intensity was recorded by two independent observers using a four-tired semi-quantitative grading system (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) converted into H-scores. Interobserver agreement was calculated by linear weighted kappa statistics. The association between staining intensity and BR was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and uni- and multiple Cox proportional hazard regression models.  Results:   Significantly higher staining intensity was found in PCa glands compared to benign glands (p < 0.001). The concordance rate in TRPM4 staining intensities for benign, PIN and PCa tissue ranged from 86.0 to 91.5 %, corresponding to linear weighted kappa values of 0.566-0.789.

Comparative data from controlled studies are lacking and clinical opinions diverge about the benefits and harms of treatment options. Consequently, there is limited guidance for patients regarding the impact of treatment decisions on quality of life. There are opportunities for public health to intervene at several decision-making points. Information on typical quality of life outcomes associated with specific prostate cancer treatments could help patients select treatment options. From 2003 to present, the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at CDC has supported projects to explore patient information-seeking behavior post-diagnosis, caregiver and provider involvement in treatment decision making, and patient quality of life following prostate cancer treatment. CDC's work also includes research that explores barriers and facilitators to the presentation of active surveillance as a viable treatment option and promotes equal access to information for men and their caregivers. This article provides an overview of the literature and considerations that initiated establishing a prospective public health research agenda around treatment decision making. Insights gathered from CDC-supported studies are poised to enhance understanding of the process of shared decision making and the influence of patient, caregiver, and provider preferences on the selection of treatment choices.

The aim of this study was to detect MEG3 expression in clinical prostate cancer tissues, investigate its biological functions in the development of prostate cancer and the underlying mechanism.  Methods:   MEG3 expression levels were detected by qRT-PCR in both tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 21 prostate cancer patients. The effects of MEG3 on PC3 and DU145 cells were assessed by MTT assay, colony formation assay, western blot and flow cytometry. Transfected PC3 cells were transplanted into nude mice, and the tumor growth curves were determined.  Results:   MEG3 decreased significantly in prostate cancer tissues relative to adjacent normal tissues. MEG3 inhibited intrinsic cell survival pathway in vitro and in vivo by reducing the protein expression of Bcl-2, enhancing Bax and activating caspase 3. We further demonstrated that MEG3 inhibited the expression of cell cycle regulatory protein Cyclin D1 and induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase.

Patients and methods:   Initial diagnosis Gleason score was obtained in 1048 of 1195 (COU-AA-301, post-docetaxel) and 996 of 1088 (COU-AA-302, chemotherapy-naïve) patients treated with AA 1 g plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily by mouth or placebo plus prednisone. Efficacy end points included radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). Distributions and medians were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) by Cox model.  Results:   Baseline characteristics were similar across studies and treatment groups. Regardless of Gleason score, AA treatment significantly improved rPFS in post-docetaxel [Gleason score <8: median, 6.4 versus 5.5 months (HR = 0.70; 95% CI 0.56-0.86), P = 0.0009 and Gleason score ≥8: median, 5.6 versus 2.9 months (HR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.48-0.72), P < 0.0001] and chemotherapy-naïve patients [Gleason score <8: median, 16.5 versus 8.2 months (HR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.40-0.62), P < 0.0001 and Gleason score ≥8: median, 13.8 versus 8.2 months (HR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.49-0.76), P < 0.0001].

Conclusion:   OS and rPFS trends demonstrate AA treatment benefit in patients with pre- or post-chemotherapy mCRPC regardless of Gleason score at initial diagnosis. The initial diagnostic Gleason score in patients with mCRPC should not be considered in the decision to treat with AA, as tumour metastases may no longer reflect the histology at the time of diagnosis.

Although there is no consensus on which patients are eligible for active surveillance, prostate specific antigen above 10 ng/ml is generally excluded. In an attempt to determine the validity of using a prostate specific antigen cutoff of 10 ng/ml to counsel men considering active surveillance we analyzed a multi-institution database to determine the pathological outcome in men with prostate specific antigen greater than 10 ng/ml but histologically favorable risk prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We queried a prospectively maintained database of men with histologically favorable risk prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2003 and 2015. The cohort was categorized into 3 groups based on prostate specific antigen level, including low-less than 10 ng/ml, intermediate-10 or greater to less than 20 and high-20 or greater. Associations of prostate specific antigen group with adverse pathological and oncologic outcomes were analyzed.  Results:   Of 2,125 patients 1,327 were categorized with histologically favorable risk disease. However on multivariate analyses the rates of up staging and upgrading were similar between the intermediate and low prostate specific antigen groups. In contrast compared to the intermediate prostate specific antigen group the high group had higher incidences of up staging (p = 0.02) and upgrading to 4 + 3 or greater disease (p = 0.046). Biochemical recurrence-free survival rates revealed no pairwise intergroup differences except between the low and high groups.

Also OPG has been associated with several organ pathologies. The widespread expression of OPG suggests that OPG may have multiple biological activities that are yet to be explored.  Methods:   The anchorage-independent sphere cultures of the adherent cells were instrumental in our study as it provided a deeper insight into the complexity of a 3D tumor. Cytokine profiling was performed for OPG's detection in the microenvironment. ELISA and western blotting were performed to quantify the OPG secretion and measure the protein levels respectively. OPG expression was detected in human breast cancer tissue samples by IHC. To decipher OPG's role in tumor aggressiveness both recombinant human OPG as well as OPG rich and depleted breast cancer cell conditioned media were tested. Western blotting and MTT assay were performed to detect changes in signaling pathways and proliferation that were induced in presence of OPG. Onset of aneuploidy, in presence of OPG, was measured by cell cycle analysis and western blotting. Finally, human Breast Cancer qBiomarker Copy Number PCR Array was used to detect how OPG remarkably induced gene copy numbers for oncogenic pathway regulators.  Results:   SUM149PT and SUM1315M02 cells secrete high levels of the cytokine OPG compared to primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). High expression of OPG was also detected in human breast cancer tissue samples compared to the uninvolved tissue from the same patient. OPG induced proliferation of control HMEC spheres and triggered the onset of aneuploidy in HMEC sphere cultures. OPG induced the expression of aneuploidy related kinases Aurora-A Kinase (IAK-1), Bub1 and BubR1 probably through the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and syndecan-1 receptors via the Erk, AKT and GSK3(3 signaling pathway. Gene copy numbers for oncogenic pathway regulators such AKT1, Aurora-A Kinase (AURKA or IAK-1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MYC with a reduction in the copy numbers of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), PTEN and DNA topoisomerase 2 alpha (TOP2A) were induced in presence of OPG.

It does so specifically through inhibiting function of this enzyme and by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a role in the progression of prostate adenocarcinomas. We investigated the clinicopathological significance of Hexim1, TGFβ, SMAD2, and SMAD7 expression in prostate adenocarcinoma cells, and assessed associations between TAMs density and these proteins.  Methods:   The cases of 100 patients diagnosed with prostate acinar adenocarcinoma who had undergone radical prostatectomy were retrospectively examined. Each was reviewed for Gleason score, cancer stage, and specific histopathological features. Original slides were re-examined, and new slides were prepared and immunostained with Hexim1, TGFβ, SMAD2, SMAD7 and CD68.  Results:   Hexim1 expression was positively correlated with Gleason score, cancer stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, extracapsular extension, and positive surgical margin. TAMs density was positively correlated with Gleason score, cancer stage, perineural invasion, extracapsular extension, and positive surgical margin. TAMs density was positively correlated with Hexim1 expression and TGFβ expression. More advanced cancer stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and extracapsular extension were correlated with strong Hexim1 expression, strong SMAD2 expression, and mild SMAD7 expression, respectively. Strong Hexim1 expression, strong TGFβ expression, and mild SMAD7 expression were associated with higher Gleason score. Strong Hexim1 expression was correlated with strong TGFβ expression and mild SMAD7 expression. Strong Hexim1 expression, strong SMAD2 expression, and mild expression of SMAD7 were associated with disease progression. Strong SMAD2 expression was associated with shorter disease-free survival.  Conclusion:   The results suggest that greater TAMs density, strong Hexim1 expression, strong SMAD2 expression, and mild SMAD7 expression play important roles in the progression of prostate adenocarcinoma. Further investigation of these proteins will help facilitate the definitive prognosis of prostate adenocarcinomas.

The nomogram risk estimates for extra-capsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicles involvement (SVI), and pelvic lymph nodes involvement (LNI) were used to adapt radiotherapy treatment volumes based on a risk threshold of ≥15 % in all cases. A planning guide was used to delineate target volumes and organs at risk (OAR). Up to three dose levels were administered over 28 fractions; 70Gy for gross disease in the prostate +/- seminal vesicles (2.5Gy/fraction), 61.6Gy for subclinical peri-prostatic disease (2.2Gy/fraction) and 50.4Gy to pelvic nodes (1.8Gy/fraction). Data regarding protocol adherence, nomogram use, radiotherapy dose distribution, and acute toxicity were collected.  Results:   Nomogram use 100 % of patients were treated for ECE, 88.9 % for SVI, and 70.4 % for LNI. The three areas at risk of LRS were appropriately treated according to the study protocol in 98.8 % cases. The MSKCC nomogram estimates for LRS differed significantly between the time of recruitment and analysis. Contouring protocol compliance Compliance with the trial contouring protocol for up to seven target volumes was 93.0 % (159/171). Compliance with protocol for small bowel contouring was poor (59.3 %). Dose constraints compliance Compliance with dose constraints for target volumes was 97.4 % (191/196). Compliance with dose constraints for OAR was 88.2 % (285/323). Acute toxicity There were no grade 3 acute toxicities observed. 20/27 (74.1 %) and 6/27 (22.2 %) patients experienced a grade 2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity respectively.  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated the feasibility of this novel risk-adapted radiation treatment protocol for HRPC. This study has identified key learning points regarding this approach, including the importance of standardization and updating of risk quantification tools, and the utility of an observer to verify their correct use.

However, the rarity of circulating tumor cells and DTCs poses a substantial challenge to the consistent success in analyzing their molecular features, including genomic aberrations. Herein, we describe optimized and robust methods to reproducibly detect genomic copy number alterations in samples of 2 to 40 cells after whole-genome amplification with the use of a high-resolution single-nuclear polymorphism-array platform and refined computational algorithms. We have determined the limit of detection for heterogeneity within a sample as 50% and also demonstrated success in analyzing single cells. We validated the genes in genomic regions that are frequently amplified or deleted by real-time quantitative PCR and nCounter copy number quantification. We further applied these methods to DTCs isolated from individuals with advanced prostate cancer to confirm their highly aberrant nature. We compared copy number alterations of DTCs with matched metastatic tumors isolated from the same individual to gain biological insight.

Furthermore, no clinical trial has assessed the role of RT in patients with node-positive (N+) M0 disease. The STAMPEDE Trial includes such individuals, allowing an exploratory multivariate analysis of the impact of radical RT.  Objective:   To describe survival and the impact on failure-free survival of RT by nodal involvement in these patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   Cohort study using data collected for patients allocated to the control arm (standard-of-care only) of the STAMPEDE Trial between October 5, 2005, and May 1, 2014. Outcomes are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs derived from adjusted Cox models; survival estimates are reported at 2 and 5 years. Participants were high-risk, hormone-naive patients with newly diagnosed M0 prostate cancer starting long-term HT for the first time. Radiotherapy is encouraged in this group, but mandated for patients with node-negative (N0) M0 disease only since November 2011.  Exposures:   Long-term HT either alone or with RT, as per local standard. Planned RT use was recorded at entry.  Main outcomes and measures:   Failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival.  Results:   A total of 721 men with newly diagnosed M0 disease were included: median age at entry, 66 (interquartile range [IQR], 61-72) years, median (IQR) prostate-specific antigen level of 43 (18-88) ng/mL. There were 40 deaths (31 owing to prostate cancer) with 17 months' median follow-up. Two-year survival was 96% (95% CI, 93%-97%) and 2-year FFS, 77% (95% CI, 73%-81%). Median (IQR) FFS was 63 (26 to not reached) months. Time to FFS was worse in patients with N+ disease (HR, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.46-2.81]) than in those with N0 disease. Failure-free survival outcomes favored planned use of RT for patients with both N0M0 (HR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.18-0.61]) and N+M0 disease (HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.29-0.79]).  Conclusions and relevance:   Survival for men entering the cohort with high-risk M0 disease was higher than anticipated at study inception. These nonrandomized data were consistent with previous trials that support routine use of RT with HT in patients with N0M0 disease. Additionally, the data suggest that the benefits of RT extend to men with N+M0 disease.

Using our immunosensor, we demonstrate sequential amperometric detection of three tumor markers: CA125, CEA, and PSA.

The intrinsic pathway is mediated by the mitochondria via the release of cytochrome C while the extrinsic pathway is prompted by death receptor signals and bypasses the mitochondria. These two pathways are closely related to cell proliferation and survival signaling cascades, which thereby constitute possible targets for cancer therapy. In previous studies we introduced two plant derived isomeric flavonoids, flavone A and flavone B which induce apoptosis in highly tumorigenic cancer cells of the breast, colon, pancreas, and the prostate. Flavone A displayed potent cytotoxic activity against more differentiated carcinomas of the colon (CaCo-2) and the pancreas (Panc28), whereas flavone B cytotoxic action is observed on poorly differentiated carcinomas of the colon (HCT 116) and pancreas (MIA PaCa). Apoptosis is induced by flavone A in better differentiated colon cancer CaCo-2 and pancreatic cancer Panc 28 cells via the intrinsic pathway by the inhibition of the activated forms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and pS6, and subsequent loss of phosphorylation of Bcl-2 associated death promoter (BAD) protein, while apoptosis is triggered by flavone B in poorly differentiated colon cancer HCT 116 and MIA PaCa pancreatic cancer cells through the extrinsic pathway with the concomitant upregulation of the phosphorylated forms of ERK and c-JUN at serine 73.

Results:   We revealed that PACE4 siRNA exhibited antitumor activity by inducing apoptosis, as determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltet-razolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell cycle analysis, Hoechst staining, caspase-3/7 activity, and western blot analysis. In addition, PACE4 siRNA significantly increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, which led to the release of cytochrome c.

Having a first-degree relative with a SI-NET has been shown to confer a substantial risk arising from shared environment and genetics. Heritable risk was examined using a computerized genealogy linked to historical statewide cancer data. A population-based analysis of the observed familial clustering of SI-NETs was performed to assess the genetic risk in distant relatives. A test for significant excess relatedness of 384 individuals with genealogy data and histologically confirmed SI-NETs was performed by comparing pairwise relatedness of cases to 1000 sets of matched controls. Overall significant excess pairwise relatedness was found for the 384 cases (P<0.001) and was still observed when closer than first cousin relationships were ignored (P=0.041). Relative risks (RRs) for SI-NETs were estimated as a ratio of observed to expected number of SI-NET cases among each relationship class. Siblings have a 13.4-fold (P<0.0001) and parents have a 6.5-fold (P=0.143) RR, suggesting both genetic and environmental influences. The risk extends out to third-degree relatives with a 2.3-fold RR (P=0.008). Metachronous cancers were also reported in 26% of the SI-NET cases demonstrating an increased RR of colon, bladder, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, and prostate cancers. Although SI-NETs are rare, relatives of these cases are at a significantly elevated risk of developing a SI-NET due to heritable genetic factors. Definition of the genetic risk factors will be an important tool for earlier diagnosis and better outcomes for SI-NETs.""","""['Deborah W Neklason', 'James VanDerslice', 'Karen Curtin', 'Lisa A Cannon-Albright']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Clinical Features, Management, and Molecular Characteristics of Familial Small Bowel Neuroendocrine Tumors.', 'A plausible role for actin gamma smooth muscle 2 (ACTG2) in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumorigenesis.', 'Somatic mutation of CDKN1B in small intestine neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Melatonin Immunoreactivity in Malignant Small Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumours.', 'Genetics and epigenetics in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours.', 'Diagnostic value of whole-mount crypt analysis of ileal biopsy specimens for the patients with familial small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors.', 'WNT2 activation through proximal germline deletion predisposes to small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors and intestinal adenocarcinomas.', 'Clinical Features, Management, and Molecular Characteristics of Familial Small Bowel Neuroendocrine Tumors.', 'Early life exposures associated with risk of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Loss of copy of MIR1-2 increases CDK4 expression in ileal neuroendocrine tumors.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a national, population-based Internet survey of adults aged 40+ to characterize perceptions about about cancer screening, the importance of information sources, cancer screening knowledge, values and preferences for screening, and the most influential drivers of decisions.  Results:   Among 1452 participants who completed the survey, the mean age was 60, and 94% were insured. Most participants reported feeling well informed about cancer screening, though only 21% reported feeling extremely well informed. Most participants correctly answered about 50% of the knowledge questions, with the majority markedly overestimating lifetime risk of cancer diagnoses and mortality. Participants rated health care providers as the most important source of information.  Conclusion:   Although respondents considered themselves well informed about cancer they performed poorly on knowledge questions.

This work examines a novel isothiocyanate-functionalized bifunctional chelate based on 2,2'-dipicolylamine (DPA) specifically designed for complexing the fac-[M(I)(CO)3](+) core. Two strategies (postlabeling and prelabeling) were explored using the isothiocyanate-functionalized DPA to determine the effectiveness of assembly on the overall yield and purity of the complex with amine containing biomolecules. A model amino acid (lysine) examined (1) amine conjugation of isothiocyanate-functionalized DPA followed by complexation with fac-[M(I)(CO)3](+) (postlabeling) and (2) complexation of fac-[M(I)(CO)3](+) with isothiocyanate-functionalized DPA followed by amine conjugation (prelabeling). Conducted with stable Re and radioactive (99m)Tc analogs, both strategies formed the product in good to excellent yields under macroscopic and radiotracer concentrations. A synthetic peptide (AE105) which targets an emerging biomarker in CaP prognosis, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), was also explored using the isothiocyanate-functionalized DPA strategy. In vitro PC-3 (uPAR+) cell uptake assays with the (99m)Tc-labeled peptide (8a) showed 4.2 ± 0.5% uptake at 4 h. In a murine model bearing PC-3 tumor xenografts, in vivo biodistribution of 8a led to favorable tumor uptake (3.7 ± 0.7% ID/g) at 4 h p.i. with relatively low accumulation (<2% ID/g) in normal organs not associated with normal peptide excretion.

For this purpose, we constructed a comprehensive CRPC regulatory network by integrating multiple pathways such as the MEK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT pathways. We studied the feedback loops of this network and found that AKT was involved in all detected negative feedback loops. We translated the network into a predictive Boolean model and analyzed the stable states and the control effects of genes using novel methods. We found that the stable states naturally divide into two obvious groups characterizing PC3 and DU145 cells respectively. Stable state analysis further revealed that several critical genes, such as PTEN, AKT, RAF, and CDKN2A, had distinct expression behaviors in different clusters.

Methods:   all had prostate-specific antigen, Gleason scores and clinical stage recorded prior to treatment. Biochemical relapse was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA)>0.4 ng/mL for radical prostatectomy, and any elevation equal or higher than 2 ng/mL over the PSA nadir for implanted patients. To analyze the effect of treatment on biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS), Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were generated.

Overdiagnosis and sampling errors represent major limitations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy (MRTB) detects higher proportion of significant PCa and reduces diagnosis of insignificant PCa. Costs prevent MRTB from becoming the new standard in PCa diagnosis. The present study aimed at assessing whether added costs of MRI outweigh benefits of MRTB in a cost-utility model.  Materials and methods:   A Markov model was developed to estimate quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY) and costs for 2 strategies (the standard 12-core TRUSGB strategy and the MRTB strategy) over 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. MRI was used as triage test in biopsy-naive men with clinical suspicion of PCa.

The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) provide robust prospective databases with clinical information and rates of cancer development. PLCO and NLST were used to identify risk factors for RCC.  Methods:   Data were extracted from PLCO and NLST to stratify risk of RCC by sex, race, age at inclusion, obesity, and smoking status. Incidence rates between groups were compared using the chi-square test. We excluded urothelial carcinomas.  Results:   Overall, 701/154,118 and 190/53,242 RCCs were detected in PLCO and NLST, respectively. Incidence rates were higher in men (PLCO: 0.56 vs. 0.28/1000 person y, NLST: 0.73 vs. 0.35/1000 person y; both with P<0.0001). In the PLCO, male sex, age>60 years, obesity, and intensity of smoking were associated with higher risk of developing RCC. In the NLST, sex and morbid obesity increased the risk for RCC but age, ethnicity, and smoking intensity were not predictors. There was no effect of screening for other cancers on detection of RCC. High-grade (grades ≥3) RCCs were diagnosed in 145 (20.7%) and 60 (31.6%) in the PLCO and NLST. In PLCO, age (60-64y), male sex, obesity, and current smokers with>50 pack years were at increased risk for high-grade RCC. In NLST, only male sex was an independent predictor of high-grade RCC.  Conclusions:   Age over 60 years, male sex, smoking intensity, and obesity affect the risk of RCC.

The aim was to describe risk factors for biochemical recurrence (BCR) and death, as well as BCR rates and overall survival (OS) rates in both treatment groups.  Patients and methods:   Overall, 5,619 patients with localized prostate cancer underwent either RP (n = 5,200) or HDR-BT (n = 419) between 1999 and 2009. Median follow-up time was 72.4 months. Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed for the overall cohort and for a propensity score-matched cohort to predict BCR and OS rates. Within the matched cohort, stratified analyses were repeated for HDR-BT alone (n = 206) and HDR-BT plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (n = 213). Sensitivity analyses were performed to adjust for prostate-specific antigen rebound.  Results:   The 5-year BCR-free survival rates were 82.1% vs. 80.3% (P<0.01) for RP and HDR-BT, respectively. Corresponding 5-year OS rates were 97.1% vs. 92.4% (P<0.01). In the propensity score-matched cohort, 5-year BCR-free survival rates were 80.3% vs. 77.1%; P = 0.06 and 5-year OS rates were 95.7% vs. 92.4%; P = 0.5. In multivariable models, the overall HDR-BT exerted no significant effect on BCR, and the same results were recorded in the matched cohort. In stratified analyses, HDR-BT alone vs. RP increased BCR risk (1.45; P<0.01); conversely, HDR-BT plus ADT vs. RP decreased BCR risk (hazard ratio = 0.66; P = 0.02).

Polyomavirus is emerging as a potential causative agent for genitourinary tract cancer in post-kidney transplant patients. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has a proven role in squamous cancers, but has not been studied in genitourinary malignancies in transplantation. Of 2345 kidney transplants performed at our center over the past 20 years, we identified 16 patients with 20 genitourinary cancers (0.7%), including 13 bladder/ureter carcinomas, 5 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), and 2 prostate carcinomas. We performed immunohistochemical staining for polyomavirus large T antigen and p16, followed by in situ hybridization for HPV in p16+ cases. Four cases of high-grade invasive urothelial bladder carcinomas were positive for large T. Large T+ urothelial carcinomas developed at least 8 years posttransplant in young men, 3 with history of BK polyoma viremia, 2 of whom had native kidney failure due to reflux/obstruction. In situ hybridization for high-risk HPV was negative in all tested cases. Overall, 3 patients died of carcinoma. All 5 RCCs were negative for both large T and p16; 2 prostate cancers were p16 negative and p16+/HPV negative, respectively. Thus, our study shows a relatively high prevalence of large T antigen in urothelial carcinoma in kidney transplant patients (31%), but not in RCC. Although sample size is small, young patients with obstructive disease may be at particular risk for developing large T-positive urothelial carcinoma.

Methods:   We model the needle-tissue as a discretized structure composed of several virtual, weightless, rigid links connected by virtual helical springs whose stiffness coefficient is found using a pattern search algorithm that only requires the force applied at the needle tip during insertion and the needle deflection measured at an arbitrary insertion depth. Needle tip deflections can then be predicted for different insertion depths.  Results:   Verification of the proposed method in synthetic and biological tissue shows a deflection estimation error of [Formula: see text]2 mm for images acquired at 35 % or more of the maximum insertion depth, and decreases to 1 mm for images acquired closer to the final insertion depth. We also demonstrate the utility of the model for prostate brachytherapy, where in vivo needle deflection measurements obtained during early stages of insertion are used to predict the needle deflection further along the insertion process.

Methods:   In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians' Health Study, we followed 1044 incident prostate cancer cases diagnosed between 1986 and 2009 for cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. A genetically validated PTEN immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs). TMPRSS2:ERG status was previously assessed in a subset of cases by a genetically validated IHC assay for ERG. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age and body mass index at diagnosis, Gleason grade, and clinical or pathologic TNM stage were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association with lethal disease. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   On average, men were followed 11.7 years, during which there were 81 lethal events. Sixteen percent of cases had complete PTEN loss in all TMA cores and 9% had heterogeneous PTEN loss across cores. After adjustment for clinical-pathologic variables, complete PTEN loss was associated with lethal progression (HR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2 to 2.9). The association of PTEN loss (complete or heterogeneous) with lethal progression was only among men with ERG-negative (HR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.7 to 5.7) but not ERG-positive (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7 to 2.2) tumors.

While this strategy allows human cells to maintain more than 25,000 genes, histone binding can also block gene expression. Consequently, cells express histone acetyl transferases (HATs) to acetylate histone lysines and release DNA for transcription. Conversely, histone deacetylases (HDACs) are employed for restoring the positive charge on the histones, thereby silencing gene expression by increasing histone-DNA binding. It has previously been shown that histones bind and silence viral DNA, while hyperacetylation of histones via HDAC inhibition restores viral gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with Entinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, enhances transgene (luciferase) expression by up to 25-fold in human prostate and murine bladder cancer cell lines when used with cationic polymers for plasmid DNA delivery. Entinostat treatment altered cell cycle progression, resulting in a significant increase in the fraction of cells present in the G0/G1 phase at low micromolar concentrations. While this moderate G0/G1 arrest disappeared at higher concentrations, a modest increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells and a decrease in cell proliferation were observed, consistent with the known anticancer effects of the drug. DNase accessibility studies revealed no significant change in plasmid transcriptional availability with Entinostat treatment. However, quantitative PCR studies indicated that Entinostat treatment, at the optimal dose for enhancing transgene expression, led to an increase in the amount of plasmid present in the nucleus in two cancer cell lines. Taken together, our results show that Entinostat enhances polymer- mediated transgene expression and can be useful in applications related to transient protein expression in mammalian cells.

FABPs are involved in binding and storing hydrophobic ligands such as long-chain fatty acids, as well as transporting these ligands to the appropriate compartments in the cell. FABP5 is overexpressed in multiple types of tumours. Furthermore, up-regulation of FABP5 is strongly associated with poor survival in triple-negative breast cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the specific up-regulation of the FABP5 gene in these cancers remain poorly characterized. In the present study, we determined that FABP5 has a typical CpG island around its promoter region. The DNA methylation status of the CpG island in the FABP5 promoter of benign prostate cells (PNT2), prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU-145, 22Rv1 and LNCaP) and human normal or tumour tissue was assessed by bisulfite sequencing analysis, and then confirmed by COBRA (combined bisulfite restriction analysis) and qAMP (quantitative analysis of DNA methylation using real-time PCR). These results demonstrated that overexpression of FABP5 in prostate cancer cells can be attributed to hypomethylation of the CpG island in its promoter region, along with up-regulation of the direct trans-acting factors Sp1 (specificity protein 1) and c-Myc. Together, these mechanisms result in the transcriptional activation of FABP5 expression during human prostate carcinogenesis. Importantly, silencing of Sp1, c-Myc or FABP5 expression led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, indicating that up-regulation of FABP5 expression by Sp1 and c-Myc is critical for the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Koichiro Kawaguchi', 'Ayumi Kinameri', 'Shunsuke Suzuki', 'Shogo Senga', 'Youqiang Ke', 'Hiroshi Fujii']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem J""","""['Fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) promotes lipolysis of lipid droplets, de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in cancer cells.', 'Fatty acid activated PPARγ promotes tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells by up regulating VEGF via PPAR responsive elements of the promoter.', 'Regulation of the ITGA2 gene by epigenetic mechanisms in prostate cancer.', 'FABP5 as a novel molecular target in prostate cancer.', 'The emerging role of fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) in cancers.', 'Steered Molecular Dynamics Simulations Study on FABP4 Inhibitors.', 'Oncogenic role and potential regulatory mechanism of fatty acid binding protein 5 based on a pan-cancer analysis.', 'Fatty acid binding protein 5 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by degradation of Krüppel-like factor 9 mediated by miR-889-5p via cAMP-response element binding protein.', 'Fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5)-related signal transduction pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells: a potential therapeutic target.', 'The Biological Functions and Regulatory Mechanisms of Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5 in Various Diseases.']"""

Although inverse associations have been observed for overall mortality, data for cause-specific mortality are sparse. Additionally, few studies have considered exclusively decaffeinated coffee intake or use of coffee additives. Coffee intake was assessed at baseline by self-report in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Among 90,317 US adults without cancer at study baseline (1998-2001) or history of cardiovascular disease at study enrollment (1993-2001), 8,718 deaths occurred during 805,644 person-years of follow-up from 1998 through 2009.

All cases required major abdominal surgery between the radical laparoscopic prostatectomy and the RUF treatment due to various complications. In no case was radiation therapy indicated prior to or after the repair. A perineal approach was performed in the 5 cases as the first option. One case required a second operation with a combined approach (abdominal and perineal) due to persistent fistulae.  Results:   After a minimum of 12 months of follow-up, 5 cases had resolved the RUF. Two patients presented urinary incontinence, and one patient had an anastomotic stricture that required internal urethrotomy. The other patients had no long-term complications.

To evaluate its clinical impact and relationship with key genomic alterations in prostate cancer, AQP5 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 12427 prostate cancers. The analysis revealed weak to moderate immunostaining in normal prostate epithelium. In prostate cancers AQP5 staining levels were more variable and also included completely negative and highly overexpressing cases. Negative, weak, moderate, and strong AQP5 staining was found in 25.0%, 32.5%, 32.5%, and 10.0% of 10239 interpretable tumors. Comparison of AQP5 expression levels with tumor characteristics showed a dichotomous pattern with both high and low staining levels being linked to unfavorable tumor phenotype. AQP5 was negative in 28%, 23%, 24%, and 35% of tumors with Gleason score ≤3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3 and ≥4 + 4, while the rate of strongly positive cases continuously increased from 7.0% over 10.0% and 12.0% to 13.0% in cancers with Gleason score ≤3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3 and ≥4 + 4. AQP5 expression was also related to ERG positivity and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion (P < .0001 each). Strong AQP5 positivity was seen in 15.5% of ERG-positive and 5.8% of ERG-negative cancers (P < .0001) as well as in 14.7% of cancers with PTEN deletion and 9.4% of cancers without PTEN deletion. Remarkably, both negativity and strong positivity of AQP5 were linked to unfavorable disease outcome. This was however only seen in subgroups defined by TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and/or PTEN deletion. In summary, AQP5 can be both overexpressed and lost in subgroups of prostate cancers. Both alterations are linked to unfavorable outcome in molecularly defined cancer subgroups.

The purpose of this work is to compare three treatment strategies for IMPT to determine potential advantages and disadvantages of ion prostate cancer therapy.  Materials and methods:   Simulations for three treatment strategies, conventional one-plan radiotherapy (ConvRT), image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) were performed employing a dataset of 10 prostate cancer patients with six CT scans taken at one week intervals. The simulation results, using a geometric margin concept (7-2 mm) as well as patient-specific internal target volume definitions for IMPT were analyzed by target coverage and exposure of critical structures on single fraction dose distributions.  Results:   All strategies led to clinically acceptable target coverage in patients exhibiting small prostate motion (mean displacement <4 mm), but IGRT and especially ART led to significant sparing of the rectum. In 20% of the patients, prostate motion exceeded 4 mm causing insufficient target coverage for ConvRT (V95mean = 0.86, range 0.63-0.99) and IGRT (V95mean = 0.91, range 0.68-1.00), while ART maintained acceptable target coverage.

Subjective QoL did not depend on the stage of cancer treatment, type of therapy, or significant deterioration in the patient's state of health in the last stage of disease. Both disease and therapy have impact on quality of life in all its dimensions, in particular as regards the patient's physical functioning and his frequent fatigue.

Options include total salvage (TS) or focal salvage (FS). TS often leads to severe late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Differences in rectal dosimetry between TS and FS are presented and dose constraints proposed to reduce late severe GI toxicity (>90 days).  Methods and materials:   Intraoperative dosimetry and 30-day CT-dosimetry of 20 FS and 28 TS patients were evaluated. GI toxicity was evaluated using the common terminology criteria for adverse events-4. With receiver operating characteristic analysis, dosimetry cutoff values to prevent severe late GI toxicity were assessed.  Results:   FS reduces rectal dose significantly. Median D(0.1cc), D(1cc), D(2cc), and V100 reductions were 38 Gy (p = 0.002), 46 Gy (p < 0.0001), 46 Gy (p < 0.0001), and 0.41 cc (p = 0.0001), respectively, compared with TS. FS patients had no late severe GI toxicity. TS patients with severe GI toxicity (41%, n = 11) showed significantly higher rectal doses than TS patients without GI toxicity (59%, n = 16). Median D(0.1cc), D(1cc), D(2cc), and V100 differences were 29 Gy (p < 0.001), 17 Gy (p = 0.001), 28 Gy (p < 0.001), and 0.45 cc (p = 0.001). With receiver operating characteristic analysis, restrictions for the D(0.1cc), D(1cc), D(2cc), and V100 are <160 Gy (area under the curve [AUC], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.00), <119 Gy (AUC, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74-1.00), <102 Gy (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77-1.00), and <0.38 cc (AUC, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.00), respectively.

This study aimed to explore the impact of APC mutational mosaicism in unexplained polyposis.  Methods:   To comprehensively screen for somatic low-level APC mosaicism, high-coverage next-generation sequencing of the APC gene was performed using DNA from leucocytes and a total of 53 colorectal tumours from 20 unrelated patients with unexplained sporadic adenomatous polyposis. APC mosaicism was assumed if the same loss-of-function APC mutation was present in ≥ 2 anatomically separated colorectal adenomas/carcinomas per patient. All mutations were validated using diverse methods.  Results:   In 25% (5/20) of patients, somatic mosaicism of a pathogenic APC mutation was identified as underlying cause of the disease. In 2/5 cases, the mosaic level in leucocyte DNA was slightly below the sensitivity threshold of Sanger sequencing; while in 3/5 cases, the allelic fraction was either very low (0.1-1%) or no mutations were detectable. The majority of mosaic mutations were located outside the somatic mutation cluster region of the gene.  Conclusions:   The present data indicate a high prevalence of pathogenic mosaic APC mutations below the detection thresholds of routine diagnostics in adenomatous polyposis, even if high-coverage sequencing of leucocyte DNA alone is taken into account.

The Men's Prostate Cancer Survivorship Retreat, or ""men's retreat,"" was developed targeting Alaska Native and non-Native men who were survivors of prostate cancer. The program brought together survivors in a supportive environment to discuss and share their experiences.  Objective:   Despite the proven effectiveness of support groups for improving quality of life for cancer patients, men typically do not participate in formal support groups. This descriptive study was conducted to explore the needs of Alaska Native and non-Native prostate cancer survivors and assess satisfaction and acceptability of a men's cancer survivorship retreat in Alaska.  Methods:   Prostate cancer survivors (N=80) who attended men's retreats during 2009-2013 were asked to complete a retreat application and post-retreat evaluation. Comments regarding social support, helpful and valuable aspects of the retreat including overall satisfaction were reported.  Results:   A men's retreat with activities that engage men can be successful for prostate cancer survivors. Many men returned for successive retreats.

Study finding:   DC altered cell proliferation, decreased viability and increased apoptosis in Vero and MCF-7 cell lines but did not show any toxic effect on mouse ovarian tissues and developing oocytes in vitro and in vivo.  What is known already:   DC suppresses cell proliferation and increases apoptosis in various cancer cells such as breast, urogenital and melanoma. DC has also been reported to alter the anticancer effects of several chemotherapeutics, including cisplatin, gemcitabine and doxorubicin in prostate, liver and uroepithelial cancer cells, respectively.  Study design, samples/materials, methods:   Vero (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) and MCF-7 (human cancerous breast epithelial cells) cell lines and mouse granulosa cells isolated from 21-day-old female BALB/c mice (n = 21) were used to assess the effects of DC (10, 50, 100 and 200 µm) for 24 and 48 h on cell proliferation, viability and apoptotic cell death. In vivo experiments were performed with a single i.p. injection of 32 mg/kg DC in 21-day-old female BALB/c mice (n = 12). Following 48 h, animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and histological sections of isolated ovaries were evaluated for apoptosis. Viability assays were based on the trypan blue dye exclusion method and an automated cell counter device was used. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) and Annexin-V immunofluorescence were assessed by 3D confocal microscopy to address apoptotic cell death. We also assessed whether DC inhibits cell proliferation and viability through NQO1 [NAD(P)H Quinone Oxidoreductase 1], an intracellular inhibitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The meiotic spindle and chromosomes were studied in mouse oocytes by α-β-tubulin and 7-aminoactinomycine D (7-AAD) immunostaining in vitro and in vivo.  Main results and the role of chance:   DC does not block oocyte maturation and no significant alteration was noted in meiotic spindle or chromosome morphology in metaphase-II (M-II) stage oocytes following DC treatment in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, exposure to DC for 24 h suppressed cell proliferation (P = 0.026 at 200 µm), decreased viability (P = 0.002 at 200 µm) and increased apoptosis (P = 0.048 at 100 µm) in Vero and MCF-7 cell lines, compared with controls. These changes were not related to intracellular NQO1 levels. Mouse granulosa cells were unaffected by 50 or 100 µm DC treatment for 24 and 48 h in vitro. DC treatment in vivo did not alter the number of primordial follicles or the ratio of apoptosis in primordial, primary and secondary follicles, as well as in antral follicles, compared with the controls.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   DC was tested for ovarian toxicity only in isolated mouse oocytes/ovaries and healthy BALB/c mice. No cancer formation was used as an in vivo test model. The possibility that DC may potentiate ovarian toxicity when combined with traditional chemotherapeutic agents, such as mitomycin-C, cisplatin, gemcitabine and doxorubicin, must be taken into account, as DC is known to alter their effects in some cancer cells.  Wider implications of the findings:   The present study evaluated, for the first time, the effect of DC on ovarian tissue. The results suggested that DC is not toxic to ovarian tissues and developing oocytes; therefore, DC should be assessed further as a potential anticancer agent when female fertility preservation is a concern.

Methods and materials:   We retrospectively studied the dosimetric effect of catheter displacement in 20 patients treated with HDR prostate brachytherapy with salvage intention. The catheter loadings, with optimized dwell positions, from the first fraction were transferred to the catheter positions in the second fraction.  Results:   Median catheter displacement was 8.7 ± 3.3 mm (range, 2.7 ± 1.1 mm-14.7 ± 1.7 mm). D90% median variations for IPSA and GO were -10% with a maximum of -59%, and -29% with a maximum of -63%, respectively. V100% median variation was -11% with a maximum of -37% for IPSA, and -20% with a maximum of -37% for GO. V150/V100 implant median variations were 15% and 9% for IPSA and GO with maximum values of 65% and 47%, respectively (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed for V200/V100 indices, nor were any significant differences found for organs at risk. Correlation between mean catheter displacement and dosimetric indices was found only in the planning target volume D90% and V100%; linear regression slopes were -2.0% per mm and -2.6% per mm for IPSA vs. -2.4% per mm and -3.5% per mm for GO.  Conclusions:   IPSA does not present any additional risk compared with GO in HDR prostate brachytherapy when catheter uncertainties are taken into account. Moreover, IPSA optimization preserves planning target volume coverage better than GO, suggesting that it may be superior when catheter displacement is considered.""","""['Gabriel Reynés-Llompart', 'Francisco Pino', 'Ignasi Modolell', 'Cristina Gullón', 'Joan Pera', 'Cristina Gutierrez', 'Cristina Picón']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Comparison of inverse planning simulated annealing and geometrical optimization for prostate high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Early clinical experience with anatomy-based inverse planning dose optimization for high-dose-rate boost of the prostate.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Optimization in treatment planning of high dose-rate brachytherapy - Review and analysis of mathematical models.']"""

Methods:   Between 11/2009 and 06/2014, 18 patients with isolated lymph node metastases after definitive prostate cancer therapy received radiotherapy to the affected lymph nodes with a total dose of 50.4 or 54.0 Gray (Gy). All patients had continuously rising levels of PSA despite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS), clinical failure-free survival (CFFS) and freedom from local failure were assessed, as was the toxicity profile.  Results:   Of the 18 patients, 17 had high-risk prostate cancer. Radiotherapy was performed at a median interval of 64.55 [interquartile range (IQR) 23.2-153.8] months after definitive therapy. ADT was administered for a median (IQR) time of 3.8 (3.2-24.7) months prior to irradiation. The median (IQR) follow-up was 15.59 (5.3-28.5) months with 94.1 % freedom from local failure. The median BPFS and CFFS were 5.85 (IQR 3.0-20.3) and 9.60 months (IQR 5.9-28.8), respectively. No grade III acute or grade II late toxicity was observed. Only two patients developed local relapse.

PTEN loss is one of the most recurrent alterations in prostate cancer associated with an aggressive phenotype, however, the occurrence of PTEN loss in insignificant prostate cancer has not been reported and its role in the separation of insignificant from significant prostate cancer is unclear. An integrated analysis of PTEN loss was, therefore, performed for structural variations, point mutations and protein expression in clinically insignificant (48 cases) and significant (76 cases) prostate cancers treated by radical prostatectomy. Whole-genome mate pair sequencing was performed on tumor cells isolated by laser capture microdissection to characterize PTEN structural alterations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization probes were constructed from the sequencing data to detect the spectrum of these PTEN alterations. PTEN loss by mate pair sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization occurred in 2% of insignificant, 13% of large volume Gleason score 6, and 46% of Gleason score 7 and higher cancers. In Gleason score 7 cancers with PTEN loss, PTEN alterations were detected in both Gleason pattern 3 and 4 in 57% of cases by mate pair sequencing, 75% by in situ hybridization and 86% by immunohistochemistry. PTEN loss by sequencing was strongly associated with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, biochemical recurrence, PTEN loss by in situ hybridization and protein loss by immunohistochemistry. The complex nature of PTEN rearrangements was unveiled by sequencing, detailing the heterogeneous events leading to homozygous loss of PTEN. PTEN point mutation was present in 5% of clinically significant tumors and not in insignificant cancer or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.

However, it is a significant challenge to chemically produce the 41-residue and three-disulfide cross-bridged LDLa module which is highly prone to aspartimide formation due to the presence of several aspartic acid residues. Known palliative measures, including addition of HOBt to piperidine for N(α) -deprotection, failed to completely overcome this side reaction. For this reason, an elegant native chemical ligation approach was employed in which two segments were assembled for generating the linear LDLa protein. Acquisition of correct folding was achieved by using either a regioselective disulfide bond formation or global oxidation strategies.

The aim of our study is to investigate the expression and functional role of Hec1 in human PCa. Hec1 expression was measured in 10 pairs of PCa cancerous and non-cancerous tissue samples by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. The effects of Hec1 on PCa cells were studied by RNAi approach. Apoptosis and cell cycle were analysed by flow cytometry. Cells viability was evaluated using cell counting Kit-8. Cyclin B1-Cdc2 (cell division cycle 2) activity was measured by ELISA assay. Long non-coding (Lnc)RNAs regulated by Hec1 were gained from bioinformatics analysis. The role of LncRNA BX647187, regulated by Hec1, was finally characterized in PCa cells by siRNA. Our results showed that Hec1 mRNA and protein were significantly overexpressed in Human PCa tissues and several PCa cell lines. Silencing Hec1 markedly suppressed proliferation, promoted apoptosis and induced cell-cycle arrest in G2/M-phase in PCa cells. Through bioinformatics analysis and knockdown Hec1 in PCa cells, we found LncRNA BX647187 was positively regulated by Hec1. We further demonstrated that suppression of BX647187 in PCa cells significantly reduced cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Thus, we conclude that Hec1 is consistently overexpressed in human PCa and Hec1 is closely linked with human PCa progression through the meditator LncRNA BX647187.

However, there is a lack of consensus regarding which incontinence surgery should be associated with a penile implant.  Aims:   To evaluate the combined implantation of a penile prosthesis and the adjustable continence therapy ProACT in patients with post-RP-ED and post-RP-SUI.  Methods:   We implanted the ProACT device and a penile prosthesis synchronously (n = 6) and asynchronously (n = 4) in 10 patients with moderate post-RP-SUI and severe post-RP-ED. We evaluated the effects on urinary incontinence using the ICIQ and PGI-I scores and pad use. We evaluated the effect on sexual function using the EHS and Global Assessment Questionnaire (GAQ), and we evaluated satisfaction with the penile prosthesis on a 5-point scale. Postoperative pain associated with each procedure was evaluated by a numeric rating scale.  Results:   No cases of urinary retention or prosthesis infection were observed. Postoperative pain was mainly related to penile prosthesis implantation. After a mean follow-up of 22.7 ± 20.9 months (range: 6-53), significant improvements of the ICIQ score (15.3 ± 3.7 vs. 4.7 ± 2.3, P < 0.001) and pad use per day (2.8 ± 1.2 vs. 0.3 ± 0.5, P < 0.001) were observed compared with baseline. According to the PGI-I questionnaire, eight patients described a very much improved (n = 6) or much improved (n = 2) urinary condition. All patients declared an EHS = 4 with the use of penile prosthesis; all patients were very satisfied (n = 6) or satisfied (n = 4) with their penile prosthesis. All patients answered the GAQ positively.  Conclusion:   The combined implantation of a Pro-ACT device and penile prosthesis represents a feasible therapeutic option in patients with post-RP-SUI and post-RP-ED. The absence of postoperative pain associated with the ProACT procedure may represent the main interest in this therapy.""","""['René Yiou', 'Michèle Binhas']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['The ""Mini-Jupette"" sling at the time of inflatable penile prosthesis implantation: Adequate treatment for erectile dysfunction with mild incontinence and/or climacturia after radical prostatectomy.', 'Andrianne Mini-Jupette Graft at the Time of Inflatable Penile Prosthesis Placement for the Management of Post-Prostatectomy Climacturia and Minimal Urinary Incontinence.', 'Management of end-stage erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy by simultaneous dual implantation using a single trans-scrotal incision: surgical technique and outcomes.', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'Management of Climacturia During Inflatable Penile Prosthesis Surgery.', 'Penile implant infection factors: a contemporary narrative review of literature.', 'Tissue Engineering and Its Potential to Reduce Prostate Cancer Treatment Sequelae-Narrative Review.', 'Future considerations in prosthetic urology.', 'Surgical Techniques for Managing Post-prostatectomy Erectile Dysfunction.', 'Review of surgical implant procedures for male incontinence after radical prostatectomy according to IDEAL framework.']"""

Specific attention is paid to external beam radiotherapy treatments for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   using different biological models that account for spectral, bystander, and low dose hypersensitivity effects, the RBE was calculated for different points moving radially out from isocentre for a typical single arc VMAT prostate case. The RBE was found by taking the ratio of the equivalent dose with the physical dose. Equivalent doses were calculated by determining what physical dose would be necessary to produce the same overall biological effect as that predicted using the different biological models.  Results:   spectral effects changed the RBE out-of-field less than 2%, whereas response models incorporating low dose hypersensitivity and bystander effects resulted in a much more profound change of the RBE for out-of-field doses. The bystander effect had the largest RBE for points located just outside the edge of the primary radiation beam in the cranial caudal (z-direction) compared to low dose hypersensitivity and spectral effects. In the coplanar direction, bystander effect played the largest role in enhancing the RBE for points up to 8.75 cm from isocentre.  Conclusions:   spectral, bystander, and low dose hypersensitivity effects can all increase the RBE for out-of-field radiation doses. In most cases, bystander effects seem to play the largest role followed by low dose hypersensitivity. Spectral effects were unlikely to be of any clinical significance. Bystander, low dose hypersensitivity, and spectral effect increased the RBE much more in the cranial caudal direction (z-direction) compared with the coplanar directions.""","""['Michael Balderson', 'Brandon Koger', 'Charles Kirkby']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Effect of edema, relative biological effectiveness, and dose heterogeneity on prostate brachytherapy.', 'Significance and implementation of RBE variations in proton beam therapy.', 'Neutron relative biological effectiveness in Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors: a critical review.', 'MIRD continuing education: Bystander and low dose-rate effects: are these relevant to radionuclide therapy?', 'The potential impact of ultrathin filter design on dosimetry and relative biological effectiveness in modern image-guided small animal irradiators.']"""

Here we create a normal prostate tissue-specific eQTL data set and apply this data set to previously identified prostate cancer (PrCa)-risk SNPs in an effort to identify candidate target genes. The eQTL data set is constructed by the genotyping and RNA sequencing of 471 samples. We focus on 146 PrCa-risk SNPs, including all SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with each risk SNP, resulting in 100 unique risk intervals. We analyse cis-acting associations where the transcript is located within 2 Mb (±1 Mb) of the risk SNP interval. Of all SNP-gene combinations tested, 41.7% of SNPs demonstrate a significant eQTL signal after adjustment for sample histology and 14 expression principal component covariates. Of the 100 PrCa-risk intervals, 51 have a significant eQTL signal and these are associated with 88 genes.

Survival benefits of docetaxel (D) added to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) were shown in the CHAARTED trial in patients with metastatic high-volume disease (HVD).  Objective:   To assess the impact of metastatic burden and to update overall survival (OS) data of the GETUG-AFU15 study.  Design, setting, and participants:   Randomized phase 3 trial of ADT plus D versus ADT alone in 385 mNCPC patients; median follow-up of 7 yr.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary end point was OS. Secondary end points were biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Retrospective analysis was by tumor volume.  Results and limitations:   After a median follow-up of 83.9 mo, median OS in the overall population was 62.1 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5-73.7) and 48.6 mo (95% CI, 40.9-60.6) for ADT plus D and ADT arms, respectively (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.88 [95% CI, 0.68-1.14]; p=0.3). Median OS in ADT plus D and ADT arms, respectively, was for HVD patients: 39.8 mo (95% CI, 28.0-53.4) versus 35.1 mo (95% CI, 29.9-43.6) (HR: 0.78 [95% CI, 0.56-1.09]; p=0.14), for low-volume disease (LVD) patients; median was not reached (NR; 95% CI, 69.5-NR) and 83.4 mo (95% CI, 61.8-NR) (HR: 1.02 [95% CI, 0.67-1.55]; p=0.9). For upfront metastatic patients, OS was 52.6 mo (95% CI, 43.3-66.8) and 41.5 mo (95% CI, 36.3-54.5), respectively (HR: 0.93 [95% CI, 0.69-1.25]; p=0.6). The bPFS (HR: 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.94]; p=0.014) and rPFS (HR: 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58-0.97]; p=0.030) were significantly longer in the ADT plus D arm. Limitations included the retrospective analysis of metastatic extent and the lack of statistical power to detect a significant difference in subgroups.  Conclusions:   The post hoc analyses of the GETUG-AFU15 study demonstrated a nonsignificant 20% reduction in the risk of death in the HVD subgroup. Patients with LVD had no survival improvement with early D.  Patient summary:   In this study, docetaxel added to castration did not improve survival in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, partly due to methodological issues. However, early chemotherapy should be discussed with all patients, given the data of three randomized trials including GETUG-AFU15.""","""['Gwenaelle Gravis', 'Jean-Marie Boher', 'Florence Joly', 'Michel Soulié', 'Laurence Albiges', 'Franck Priou', 'Igor Latorzeff', 'Remy Delva', 'Ivan Krakowski', 'Brigitte Laguerre', 'Frédéric Rolland', 'Christine Théodore', 'Gael Deplanque', 'Jean-Marc Ferrero', 'Stéphane Culine', 'Loïc Mourey', 'Philippe Beuzeboc', 'Muriel Habibian', 'Stéphane Oudard', 'Karim Fizazi;GETUG']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['It Is Time to Harmonize the Design and Conduct of Clinical Trials in Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Burden of Metastatic Castrate Naive Prostate Cancer Patients, to Identify Men More Likely to Benefit from Early Docetaxel: Further Analyses of CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 Studies.', 'Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Addition of Docetaxel to Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Patients with Hormone-sensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Correlation of Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics with Overall Survival and Radiological Progression-free Survival in Metastatic Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer Treated with Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone or Placebos Added to Androgen Deprivation Therapy: Post Hoc Analysis of Phase 3 LATITUDE Study.', 'Should docetaxel be standard of care for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer?
