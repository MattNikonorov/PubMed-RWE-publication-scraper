Objective:   The aim of this study was to explore the correlates and predictors for finding benefit from prostate cancer among a sample of men undergoing androgen deprivation.  Methods:   Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression modeling were performed on data collected in an acute tertiary hospital outpatient setting (N = 209) between July 2011 and December 2013 to determine correlates and predictors for finding benefit from prostate cancer.  Results:   Multiple linear regression modeling showed that while the 6 predictors of self-reported coping, depression, anxiety, distress, resilience, and hope explained 38% of the variance in finding benefit, coping provided the strongest and statistically significant predictive contribution.  Conclusions:   Self-reported coping was strongly predictive of finding benefit from prostate cancer, but questions remain about if subtypes of coping strategies can be more or less predictive of finding benefit. Self-reported levels of depression, anxiety, distress, resilience, and hope had a less predictive and nonsignificant role in finding benefit from prostate cancer and raise questions about their function in this subpopulation.  Implications for practice:   The findings suggest that coping strategies can maximize finding benefit from prostate cancer. Knowledge of influential coping strategies for finding benefit from prostate cancer can be immensely valuable to support men in rebuilding positive meaning amid a changed illness reality. Developing practice initiatives that foster positive meaning-making coping strategies seems valuable.""","""['Elizabeth C Pascoe', 'David Edvardsson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""['Which coping strategies can predict beneficial feelings associated with prostate cancer?', 'African-centered coping, resilience, and psychological distress in Black prostate cancer patients.', 'Dyadic effects of coping strategies on emotional state and quality of life in prostate cancer patients and their spouses.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Coping Strategies Used by Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A Literature Review.', 'Coping strategies of patients with advanced lung or colorectal cancer in six European countries: Insights from the ACTION Study.', 'The Association Between Resilience and Mental Health in the Somatically Ill.', 'Acceptance, social support, benefit-finding, and depression in women with gynecological cancer.', 'Coping Well with Advanced Cancer: A Serial Qualitative Interview Study with Patients and Family Carers.']"""

We have investigated the use of metabolomics analyses of blood samples for separating PCa patients and controls with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Methods:   Blood plasma and serum samples from 29 PCa patient and 21 controls with BPH were analysed by metabolomics analysis using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and gas chromatography.

Potential toxicity of argentatin B was evaluated in CD-1 mice. Its effect on tumor growth was tested in a HCT-15 and PC-3 xenograft model. Argentatin B induced an increment of cells in sub G1, but did not produce apoptosis. Proliferation of both cell lines was inhibited by argentatin B. Forty-three percent HCT-15, and 66% PC-3 cells showed positive SA-β-galactosidase staining. The expression of PCNA was decreased, p21 expression was increased in both cell lines, but p27 expression increased only in PC-3 cells after treatment.

Ductal adenocarcinoma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, because no specific tumor markers are known. Docetaxel has been used for acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate, a common type of prostate cancer, but it is largely ineffective for ductal adenocarcinoma. Earlier studies suggested that the chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin might be effective for ductal adenocarcinoma. Here we report two patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate that did not respond to docetaxel, but responded to the gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy. Patient 1 was a 59-year-old man who had lung metastasis despite androgen deprivation therapy with undetectable levels of prostate-specific antigen and who presented with brain metastasis during docetaxel chemotherapy. Pathological examination of the resected brain tumor revealed ductal adenocarcinoma with positive immunostaining for carcinoembryonic antigen. The gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy achieved partial response of the lung metastasis with serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels decreasing from 11.4 ng/mL to 2.9 ng/mL. Patient 2 was a 69-year-old man with lung metastasis. Local progression appeared during androgen deprivation therapy, and the subsequent transurethral biopsy revealed ductal adenocarcinoma with positive immunostaining for neuron-specific enolase. Bone and distant lymph node metastasis appeared despite docetaxel chemotherapy. Six courses of the gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy achieved partial response of metastatic lesions, with serum neuron-specific enolase levels decreasing from 118 ng/mL to 2.6 ng/mL. The gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy is a potential option for treatment of advanced ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate.""","""['Yoshihiro Kamiyama', 'Koji Mitsuzuka', 'Mika Watanabe', 'Naoki Kawamorita', 'Shigeyuki Yamada', 'Yasuhiro Kaiho', 'Akihiro Ito', 'Haruo Nakagawa', 'Yoichi Arai']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tohoku J Exp Med""","""['Carbohydrate antigen 19-9-positive prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma effectively treated with cisplatin and gemcitabine.', 'Short-term efficacy of combined chemotherapy of gemcitabine and cisplatin on advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Gemcitabine and vinorelbine followed by weekly docetaxel in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a phase II trial of sequential chemotherapy.', 'Gemcitabine + Cisplatin combinations in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Carboplatin plus irinotecan induced partial response in a patient with small cell carcinoma of the prostate; a case report.', 'Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate or seminal vesicle adenocarcinoma: An multi-disciplinary team (MDT) case report and literature review.']"""

While restoration of microRNA-145 (miR-145) expression reduces chemoradioresistance in glioblastoma and suppress prostate cancer proliferation, migration and invasion, the role of miR-145 in response to radiation therapy for prostate cancer is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-145 in determining the tumor response to radiation treatment in prostate cancer. Human prostate cancer cells LNCAP and PC3 were transfected with miR-145 mimic. Clonogenic assay was used to determine whether overexpression of miR-145 could alter radiation response in vitro. Immunofluorescence of γ-H2AX and flow cytometric analysis of phosphorylated histone H3 were performed to investigate the potential mechanisms contributing to the enhanced radiation-induced cell killing induced by miR-145. In addition, a qPCR-based array was used to detect the possible miR-145-mediated regulated genes involved. Tumor growth delay assays and survival curves were then analyzed in an animal model to investigate whether miR-145 induced radiosensitivity in vivo. Furthermore, miR-145 expression was assessed in 30 prostate tumor tissue biopsies taken prior to neoadjuvant radiotherapy using miRNA arrays. Our current study suggested that ectopic expression of miR-145 significantly sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation and we used γ-H2AX phosphorylation as a surrogate marker of radiotherapy response versus miR-145 expression levels. We observed significantly more foci per cell in the group treated with miR-145 and radiation. In addition, mitotic catastrophe was significantly increased in cells receiving miR-145 and radiation. The above results suggest that miR-145 appears to reduced the efficiency of the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks in cells. A detailed examination of the involvement of the DNA repair pathway showed that miR-145 reduced the expression of 10 genes involved in DNA repair according to a qPCR-based array data. Irradiation of subcutaneous PC3 tumors in mice treated with R11-miR-145 (a cellular permeable peptide, previously reported) resulted in an increase in radiation-induced tumor growth delay and lived the longest after combination treatment. Moreover, miR-145 expression was significantly increased in patients demonstrating good response (PSA < 2.0 ng/ml/year) to neoadjuvant radiotherapy, while expression of the miR-145-regulated DNA repair genes was significantly decreased. In conclusion, these data suggest a possible mechanism for miR-145 radiosensitivity, potentially through down regulating of DNA repair. This novel study shows a role for miR-145 in modulating radiosensitivity in vivo and highlights the need for further study investigating the potential role of miR-145 as both a predictive marker of response and a novel therapeutic agent with which to enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy.""","""['Pijun Gong', 'Tingting Zhang', 'Dalin He', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiat Res""","""['miR-205 enhances radiation sensitivity of prostate cancer cells by impairing DNA damage repair through PKCε and ZEB1 inhibition.', 'Knockdown of microRNA-1323 restores sensitivity to radiation by suppression of PRKDC activity in radiation-resistant lung cancer cells.', 'Long noncoding RNA GAS5 modulates α-Solanine-induced radiosensitivity by negatively regulating miR-18a in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Epigenetic interventions increase the radiation sensitivity of cancer cells.', 'Targeting MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'MicroRNAs as clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Stem Cells: An Ever-Hiding Foe.', 'Personalized management of prostate cancer: from molecular and imaging markers to radiogenomics.', 'The Influence of miRNAs on Radiotherapy Treatment in Prostate Cancer - A Systematic Review.', 'MicroRNAs as Epigenetic Determinants of Treatment Response and Potential Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The aim of our study was to assess their role in counseling for radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We analyzed 30 videotaped preoperative consultations prior to radical prostatectomy. Thereof, 14 included the patients' female partner and 16 took place without partner attendance. We performed quantitative and qualitative conversation analysis to compare both settings.  Results:   Mean age of patients was 61 (47-73) years; 13% (4/30) did not have a partner. Duration of preoperative consultations was 20 (10-32) min. Physicians spoke most of the time (93%, range 71-99%), followed by patients (7%, range 1-20%) and spouses (2%, range 0-8%). Patients whose spouse was present at the consultation tended to have a more averted posture (50% vs. 25%, p = 0.04) and tended to speak less often (5% vs. 8%, p = 0.02). In 4 of 14 (29%) consultations, the spouses tended to be more dominant, speaking more frequently. Qualitative analysis showed several examples of emotional support and helpful contributions by spouses. Difference of opinion occurred when pros and cons of a nerve-sparing approach were discussed. The spouses' impact appeared to influence the final decision of men contemplating a nerve-sparing approach in 1 of 14 conversations.  Conclusions:   Spouses appear to play a complex and sometimes ambivalent role in counseling for radical prostatectomy. Especially when discussing a nerve-sparing approach, urologist should focus on the patients' true needs while interacting with both partners.

The authors recently validated a radiobiological model which takes into account tumor location and tumor characteristics including tumor cell density, Gleason score, and hypoxia in order to plan optimal dose distributions for focal therapy. The authors propose that this model can be informed using multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and in this study present a registration framework developed to map prostate mpMRI and histology data, where histology will provide the ""ground truth"" data regarding tumor location and biology. The authors aim to apply this framework to a growing database to develop a prostate biological atlas which will enable MRI based planning for prostate focal therapy treatment.  Methods:   Six patients scheduled for routine radical prostatectomy were used in this proof-of-concept study. Each patient underwent mpMRI scanning prior to surgery, after which the excised prostate specimen was formalin fixed and mounted in agarose gel in a custom designed sectioning box. T2-weighted MRI of the specimen in the sectioning box was acquired, after which 5 mm sections of the prostate were cut and histology sections were microtomed. A number of image processing and registration steps were used to register histology images with ex vivo MRI and deformable image registration (DIR) was applied to 3D T2w images to align the in vivo and ex vivo MRI data. Dice coefficient metrics and corresponding feature points from two independent annotators were selected in order to assess the DIR accuracy.  Results:   Images from all six patients were registered, providing histology and in vivo MRI in the ex vivo MRI frame of reference for each patient. Results demonstrated that their DIR methodology to register in vivo and ex vivo 3D T2w MRI improved accuracy in comparison with an initial manual alignment for prostates containing features which were readily visible on MRI. The average estimated uncertainty between in vivo MRI and histology was 3.3 mm, which included an average error of 3.1 mm between in vivo and ex vivo MRI after applying DIR. The mean dice coefficient for the prostate contour between in vivo and ex vivo MRI increased from 0.83 before DIR to 0.93 after DIR.  Conclusions:   The authors have developed a registration framework for mapping in vivo MRI data of the prostate with histology by implementing a number of processing steps and ex vivo MRI of the prostate specimen. Validation of DIR was challenging, particularly in prostates with few or mostly linear rather than spherical shaped features. Refinement of their MR imaging protocols to improve the data quality is currently underway which may improve registration accuracy. Additional mpMRI sequences will be registered within this framework to quantify prostate tumor location and biology.""","""['H M Reynolds', 'S Williams', 'A Zhang', 'R Chakravorty', 'D Rawlinson', 'C S Ong', 'M Esteva', 'C Mitchell', 'B Parameswaran', 'M Finnegan', 'G Liney', 'A Haworth']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Voxel-wise correlation of positron emission tomography/computed tomography with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and histology of the prostate using a sophisticated registration framework.', 'Preliminary experience with a novel method of three-dimensional co-registration of prostate cancer digital histology and in vivo multiparametric MRI.', 'Technical Note: Method to correlate whole-specimen histopathology of radical prostatectomy with diagnostic MR imaging.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer: A review and update for urologists.', 'Prostate MR Imaging for Posttreatment Evaluation and Recurrence.', 'Parametric maps of spatial two-tissue compartment model for prostate dynamic contrast enhanced MRI - comparison with the standard tofts model in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'U-Net Architecture for Prostate Segmentation: The Impact of Loss Function on System Performance.', 'Detecting localised prostate cancer using radiomic features in PSMA PET and multiparametric MRI for biologically targeted radiation therapy.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for radiation therapy response monitoring in soft tissue sarcomas: a histology and MRI co-registration algorithm.', 'Semi-quantitative and quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI parameters as prostate cancer imaging biomarkers for biologically targeted radiation therapy.']"""

In this study, the authors performed an analysis of three adaptive treatment strategies that combine information from both bony and gold marker registrations. The robustness of those treatments against the interfraction prostate movements was evaluated.  Methods:   A retrospective study was conducted on five prostate cancer patients with 7-13 daily cone-beam CTs (CBCTs). The clinical target volumes (CTVs) consisting of pelvic lymph nodes, prostate, and seminal vesicles as well as the OARs were delineated on each CBCT and the initial CT. Three adaptive strategies were analyzed. Two of these methods relied on a two-step patient positioning at each fraction. First step: a bony registration was used to deliver the nodal CTV prescription. Second step: a gold marker registration was then used either to (1) complete the dose delivered to the prostate (complement); (2) or give almost the entire prescription to the prostate with a weak dose gradient between the targets to compensate for possible motions (gradient). The third method (COR) used a pool of precalculated plans based on images acquired at previous treatment fractions. At each new fraction, a plan is selected from that pool based on the daily position of prostate center-of-mass. The dosimetric comparison was conducted and results are presented with and without the systematic shift in the prostate position on the CT planning. The adaptive strategies were compared to the current clinical standard where all fractions are treated with the initial nonadaptive plan.  Results:   The minimum daily prostate D95% is improved by 2%, 9%, and 6% for the complement, the gradient, and the COR approaches, respectively, compared to the nonadaptive method. The average nodal CTV D95% remains constant across the strategies, except for the gradient approach where a reduction of 7% is observed. However, a correction of the systematic shift reduced the problem, and the adaptive strategies remain robust against the prostate movement across the fraction. The bladder V55Gy is reduced by 35% on average for the adaptive strategies.  Conclusions:   Because they offer increased CTV coverage and OAR sparing, adaptive methods may be suitable candidates for simple and efficient adaptive treatment strategies for prostate cancer. Margin reduction and systematic error correction in the prostate position improve the protection of the OAR and the dose coverage. A cumulative dose to simulate a complete treatment would show real effects and allow a better comparison between each method.""","""['Audrey Cantin', 'Luc Gingras', 'Bernard Lachance', 'William Foster', 'Julie Goudreault', 'Louis Archambault']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric consequences of prostate-based couch shifts on the precision of dose delivery during simultaneous IMRT irradiation of the prostate, seminal vesicles and pelvic lymph nodes.', 'Effect of MLC leaf width on treatment adaptation and accuracy for concurrent irradiation of prostate and pelvic lymph nodes.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Automated volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole pelvic prostate radiotherapy.']"""

There is a need for accurate 3D in vivo patient dose verification using electronic portal imaging device (EPID) measurements. This work presents a model-based technique to compute full three-dimensional patient dose reconstructed from on-treatment EPID portal images (i.e., transmission images).  Methods:   EPID dose is converted to incident fluence entering the patient using a series of steps which include converting measured EPID dose to fluence at the detector plane and then back-projecting the primary source component of the EPID fluence upstream of the patient. Incident fluence is then recombined with predicted extra-focal fluence and used to calculate 3D patient dose via a collapsed-cone convolution method. This method is implemented in an iterative manner, although in practice it provides accurate results in a single iteration. The robustness of the dose reconstruction technique is demonstrated with several simple slab phantom and nine anthropomorphic phantom cases. Prostate, head and neck, and lung treatments are all included as well as a range of delivery techniques including VMAT and dynamic intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).  Results:   Results indicate that the patient dose reconstruction algorithm compares well with treatment planning system computed doses for controlled test situations. For simple phantom and square field tests, agreement was excellent with a 2%/2 mm 3D chi pass rate ≥98.9%. On anthropomorphic phantoms, the 2%/2 mm 3D chi pass rates ranged from 79.9% to 99.9% in the planning target volume (PTV) region and 96.5% to 100% in the low dose region (>20% of prescription, excluding PTV and skin build-up region).  Conclusions:   An algorithm to reconstruct delivered patient 3D doses from EPID exit dosimetry measurements was presented. The method was applied to phantom and patient data sets, as well as for dynamic IMRT and VMAT delivery techniques. Results indicate that the EPID dose reconstruction algorithm presented in this work is suitable for clinical implementation.""","""['Eric Van Uytven', 'Timothy Van Beek', 'Peter M McCowan', 'Krista Chytyk-Praznik', 'Peter B Greer', 'Boyd M C McCurdy']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['An in vivo dose verification method for SBRT-VMAT delivery using the EPID.', 'Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'In aqua vivo EPID dosimetry.', 'Dosimetric verification of IMRT and 3D conformal treatment delivery using EPID.', 'A literature review of electronic portal imaging for radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'A structure-based gamma evaluation method for identifying clinically relevant dose differences in organs at risk.', 'The fast calibration model for dosimetry with an electronic portal imaging device.', 'Extending in aqua portal dosimetry with dose inhomogeneity conversion maps for accurate patient dose reconstruction in external beam radiotherapy.', 'A recurrent neural network for rapid detection of delivery errors during real-time portal dosimetry.', 'A feasibility study for in vivo treatment verification of IMRT using Monte Carlo dose calculation and deep learning-based modelling of EPID detector response.']"""

The goal of this study was to investigate genes with outlier expression with prognostic association in high-risk prostate cancer patients as potential biomarkers and drug targets.  Experimental design:   We interrogated microarray gene expression data from prostatectomy samples from 545 high-risk prostate cancer patients with long-term follow-up (mean 13.4 years). Three independent clinical datasets totaling an additional 545 patients were used for validation. Novel prognostic outlier genes were interrogated for impact on oncogenic phenotypes in vitro using siRNA-based knockdown. Association with clinical outcomes and comparison with existing prognostic instruments was assessed with multivariable models using a prognostic outlier score.  Results:   Analysis of the discovery cohort identified 20 prognostic outlier genes. Three top prognostic outlier genes were novel prostate cancer genes; NVL, SMC4, or SQLE knockdown reduced migration and/or invasion and outlier expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis. Increased prognostic outlier score was significantly associated with poor prognosis independent of standard clinicopathologic variables. Finally, the prognostic outlier score prognostic association is independent of, and adds to existing genomic and clinical tools for prognostication in prostate cancer (Decipher, the cell-cycle progression signature, and CAPRA-S).

In androgen-dependent tissues T is reduced to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) because of the presence of the 5α-reductase enzyme. This androgen is more active than T, since it has a higher affinity for the androgen receptor (AR). When this mechanism is altered, androgen-dependent diseases, including prostate cancer, could result. The aim of this study was to synthesize several 16-dehydropregnenolone acetate derivatives containing a triazole ring at C-21 and a linear or alicyclic ester moiety at C-3 of the steroidal skeleton. These steroids were designed as potential inhibitors of the activity of both types (1 and 2) of 5α-reductase. The cytotoxic activity of these compounds was also evaluated on a panel of PC-3, MCF7, and SK-LU-1 human cancer cell lines. The results from this study showed that with the exception of steroids 20-oxo-21-(1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-yl)pregna-5,16-dien-3β-yl-propionate and 20-oxo-21-(1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-yl)pregna-5,16-dien-3β-yl-pentanoate, the compounds exhibit a lower inhibitory activity for both isoenzymes of 5α-reductase than finasteride. Furthermore the 3β-hydroxy-21-(1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-yl)pregna-5,16-dien-20-one and 20-oxo-21-(1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-yl)pregna-5,16-dien-3β-yl-acetate derivatives display 80% cytotoxic activity on the SK-LU-1 cell line.

Internalizing GRPR agonists were initially proposed for prolonged lesion retention, but a shift of paradigm to GRPR antagonists has recently been made. Surprisingly, radioantagonists, such as [(99m)Tc]DB1 ((99m)Tc-N4'-DPhe(6),Leu-NHEt(13)]BBN(6-13)), displayed better pharmacokinetics than radioagonists, in addition to their higher inherent biosafety. We introduce here [(68)Ga]SB3, a [(99m)Tc]DB1 mimic-carrying, instead of the (99m)Tc-binding tetraamine, the chelator DOTA for labeling with the PET radiometal (68)Ga.  Methods:   Competition binding assays of SB3 and [(nat)Ga]SB3 were conducted against [(125)I-Tyr(4)]BBN in PC-3 cell membranes. Blood samples collected 5 min postinjection (pi) of the [(67)Ga]SB3 surrogate in mice were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for degradation products. Likewise, biodistribution was performed after injection of [(67)Ga]SB3 (37 kBq, 100 μL, 10 pmol peptide) in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing PC-3 xenografts. Eventually, [(68)Ga]SB3 (283 ± 91 MBq, 23 ± 7 nmol) was injected into 17 patients with breast (8) and prostate (9) cancer. All patients had disseminated disease and had received previous therapies. PET/CT fusion images were acquired 60-115 min pi.  Results:   SB3 and [(nat)Ga]SB3 bound to the human GRPR with high affinity (IC50: 4.6 ± 0.5 nM and 1.5 ± 0.3 nM, respectively). [(67)Ga]SB3 displayed good in vivo stability (>85 % intact at 5 min pi). [(67)Ga]SB3 showed high, GRPR-specific and prolonged retention in PC-3 xenografts (33.1 ± 3.9%ID/g at 1 h pi - 27.0 ± 0.9%ID/g at 24 h pi), but much faster clearance from the GRPR-rich pancreas (≈160%ID/g at 1 h pi to <17%ID/g at 24 h pi) in mice. In patients, [(68)Ga]SB3 elicited no adverse effects and clearly visualized cancer lesions. Thus, 4 out of 8 (50 %) breast cancer and 5 out of 9 (55 %) prostate cancer patients showed pathological uptake on PET/CT with [(68)Ga]SB3.  Conclusion:   [(67)Ga]SB3 showed excellent pharmacokinetics in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice, while [(68)Ga]SB3 PET/CT visualized lesions in about 50 % of patients with advanced and metastasized prostate and breast cancer.

However, urine is a complex substrate that can be separated in several fractions. In this study we compared the levels of PCa-specific biomarkers (PCA3 and ERG) and KLK3 as prostate-specific reference gene in three urine substrates-whole urine, urinary sediment (cell pellet) and exosomes-and evaluated the influence of performing a digital rectal examination (DRE) prior to urine sampling.  Methods:   First-voided urine samples were prospectively obtained before and after DRE from 29 men undergoing prostate biopsies. The urine was separated in whole urine, cell pellet and exosomes and the biomarker levels were measured with RT-qPCR.  Results:   PCa was identified in 52% (15/29) of men. In several samples the mRNA levels were below the analytical limit of detection (BDL). The biomarker levels were highest in whole urine and significantly higher after DRE in all substrates. In PCa patients higher levels of PCA3 and ERG were found in all urine substrates after DRE compared to non-PCa patients.  Conclusions:   This is the first study in which urinary PCa-specific biomarker levels were compared directly in three separate urine fractions. These results suggest that whole urine could be the urine substrate of choice for PCa-diagnostics based on analytical sensitivity, which is reflected directly in the high informative rate. Moreover, the significant positive effect of performing a DRE prior to urine sampling is confirmed. These findings could be of influence in the development of PCa-diagnostic urine tests.""","""['Rianne J Hendriks', 'Siebren Dijkstra', 'Sander A Jannink', 'Martijn G Steffens', 'Inge M van Oort', 'Peter F A Mulders', 'Jack A Schalken']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Chem Lab Med""","""['The way of prostate cancer diagnostics.', 'A molecular signature of PCA3 and ERG exosomal RNA from non-DRE urine is predictive of initial prostate biopsy result.', 'Detection of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcripts and prostate cancer antigen 3 in urinary sediments may improve diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection and Prognosis: From Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) to Exosomal Biomarkers.', 'Urinary Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Gene-Transcript Expression in Urine Supernatant and Urine Cell-Sediment Are Different but Equally Useful for Detecting Prostate Cancer.', 'The diagnostic role and mechanistic functions of exosomal lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Combination of PI-RADS score and mRNA urine test-A novel scoring system for improved detection of prostate cancer.', 'Nanomaterials-Based Urinary Extracellular Vesicles Isolation and Detection for Non-invasive Auxiliary Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Morphometric analysis of multicellular 3D organoids is particularly important when additional components such as the extracellular matrix and tumour microenvironment are included in the model. The complexity of such models has so far limited their successful implementation. There is a great need for automatic, accurate and robust image segmentation tools to facilitate the analysis of such biologically relevant 3D cell culture models. We present a segmentation method based on Markov random fields (MRFs) and illustrate our method using 3D stack image data from an organotypic 3D model of prostate cancer cells co-cultured with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The 3D segmentation output suggests that these cell types are in physical contact with each other within the model, which has important implications for tumour biology. Segmentation performance is quantified using ground truth labels and we show how each step of our method increases segmentation accuracy. We provide the ground truth labels along with the image data and code. Using independent image data we show that our segmentation method is also more generally applicable to other types of cellular microscopy and not only limited to fluorescence microscopy.""","""['Sean Robinson', 'Laurent Guyon', 'Jaakko Nevalainen', 'Mervi Toriseva', 'Malin Åkerfelt', 'Matthias Nees']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Software tools for 3D nuclei segmentation and quantitative analysis in multicellular aggregates.', 'Quantitative Phenotypic Image Analysis of Three-Dimensional Organotypic Cultures.', 'A 3D global-to-local deformable mesh model based registration and anatomy-constrained segmentation method for image guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Automatic 3D segmentation of multiphoton images: a key step for the quantification of human skin.', 'A review of 3D vessel lumen segmentation techniques: models, features and extraction schemes.', 'Spatiotemporal Tracking of Different Cell Populations in Cancer Organoid Models for Investigations on Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Software tools for 3D nuclei segmentation and quantitative analysis in multicellular aggregates.', 'Machine learning-aided quantification of antibody-based cancer immunotherapy by natural killer cells in microfluidic droplets.', 'Machine learning and image-based profiling in drug discovery.', 'Comprehensive high-throughput image analysis for therapeutic efficacy of architecturally complex heterotypic organoids.']"""

Combinations of α-tomatine and curcumin synergistically inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Effects of the α-tomatine and curcumin combination were associated with synergistic inhibition of NF-κB activity and a potent decrease in the expression of its downstream gene Bcl-2 in the cells.

The aim of this study was to screen differentially expressed miRNAs in prostate cancer and analyze the functions and signal pathways of their target genes. MATERIAL AND METHODS High-throughput data of miRNAs were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A total of 551 samples (52 normal and 499 prostate cancer cases) and 1046 miRNAs expression values were selected for further analysis. Differentially expressed miRNAs between normal and prostate cancer tissues were identified using SAMR. StarBase and TargetScan software were used to predict the miRNAs' target group and target genes, respectively. GO functional and KEGG pathway analysis was conducted on up/down-regulated expressed miRNA with DAVID. Finally, survival analysis was performed to evaluate the association of differently expressed miRNAs signature and overall survival of prostate cancer patients. RESULTS A total of 162 miRNAs were differentially expressed between normal and prostate cancer samples, including 128 up-regulated and 38 down-regulated ones; hsa-mir-153-2, hsa-mir-92a-1, and hsa-mir-182 (up-regulated); and hsa-mir-29a, hsa-mir-10a, and hsa-mir-221 (down-regulated) were identified as good biomarkers. In GO and KEGG analysis, target genes of down-regulated miRNAs were significantly enriched in positive ion combination and JAK-STAT pathway annotation, respectively; the ones with up-regulated miRNAs were significantly enriched in the function of plasma membrane and MARK signaling pathway annotation, respectively. Patients were categorized into low- or high-score groups according to their risk scores from each miRNA. The patients in the low-score group had better overall survival compared with those in high-score group. CONCLUSIONS The 6 differentially expressed miRNAs and their target genes were used to define important molecular targets that could serve as prognostic and predictive markers in the treatment of prostate cancer. Further research on the function of the target genes in the MAPK signal pathway could provide references for treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Zhang Xiaoli', 'Wei Yawei', 'Liu Lianna', 'Li Haifeng', 'Zhang Hui']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Five miRNAs Considered as Molecular Targets for Predicting Esophageal Cancer.', 'Five miRNAs considered as molecular targets for predicting neuroglioma.', 'A nine-miRNA signature as a potential diagnostic marker for breast carcinoma: An integrated study of 1,110 cases.', 'The potential of microRNAs as human prostate cancer biomarkers: A meta-analysis of related studies.', 'Role of microRNAs in the development, prognosis and therapeutic response of patients with prostate cancer.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', 'miR-106b as an emerging therapeutic target in cancer.', 'Prognostic values of the core components of the mammalian circadian clock in prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Human Prostate Tissue MicroRNAs and Their Predicted Target Pathways Linked to Prostate Cancer Risk Factors.']"""

However, little is known about the stem/progenitor properties of transformed cells within tumors. Using the aggressive Pten/Tp53-null mouse model of prostate cancer, we show that two classes of luminal progenitors exist within a tumor. Not only did tumors contain previously described multipotent progenitors, but also a major population of committed luminal progenitors. Luminal cells, sorted directly from tumors or grown as organoids, initiated tumors of adenocarcinoma or multilineage histological phenotypes, which is consistent with luminal and multipotent differentiation potentials, respectively. Moreover, using organoids we show that the ability of luminal-committed progenitors to self-renew is a tumor-specific property, absent in benign luminal cells. Finally, a significant fraction of luminal progenitors survived in vivo castration. In all, these data reveal two luminal tumor populations with different stem/progenitor cell capacities, providing insight into prostate cancer cells that initiate tumors and can influence treatment response.""","""['Supreet Agarwal', 'Paul G Hynes', 'Heather S Tillman', 'Ross Lake', 'Wassim G Abou-Kheir', 'Lei Fang', 'Orla M Casey', 'Amir H Ameri', 'Philip L Martin', 'Juan Juan Yin', 'Phillip J Iaquinta', 'Wouter R Karthaus', 'Hans C Clevers', 'Charles L Sawyers', 'Kathleen Kelly']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Rep""","""['Illuminating the Properties of Prostate Luminal Progenitors.', 'Self-renewing Pten-/- TP53-/- protospheres produce metastatic adenocarcinoma cell lines with multipotent progenitor activity.', 'Developing a Novel Two-Dimensional Culture System to Enrich Human Prostate Luminal Progenitors that Can Function as a Cell of Origin for Prostate Cancer.', 'Characterizing the contribution of stem/progenitor cells to tumorigenesis in the Pten-/-TP53-/- prostate cancer model.', 'Stem cells in genetically-engineered mouse models of prostate cancer.', 'The many ways to make a luminal cell and a prostate cancer cell.', 'Prostate organoids: emerging experimental tools for translational research.', 'TRIM28 promotes luminal cell plasticity in a mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'Innate Immune Program in Formation of Tumor-Initiating Cells from Cells-of-Origin of Breast, Prostate, and Ovarian Cancers.', 'Nonmalignant AR-positive prostate epithelial cells and cancer cells respond differently to androgen.', ""Urological cancer organoids, patients' avatars for precision medicine: past, present and future.""]"""

These hypermethylation regions occurred not only in the promoters of genes but also in gene bodies and at intergenic regions that are enriched for DNA-protein binding sites. Integration with existing RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and survival data revealed regions where DNA methylation correlates with reduced gene expression associated with poor outcome.

Due to the low specificity of current diagnosis methods for detecting prostate cancer, identification of new biomarkers is highly desirable. The study was conducted to determine the clinical utility of the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) assay to predict biopsy-detected cancers in Chinese men.  Methods:   The study included men who had a biopsy at The Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University from January 2013 to December 2013. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were used to test PCA3 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA. The diagnostic accuracy of the PCA3 score for predicting a positive biopsy outcome was studied using sensitivity and specificity, and it was compared with PSA.  Results:   The probability of a positive biopsy increased with increasing PCA3 scores. The mean PCA3 score was significantly higher in men with prostate cancer (198.03, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 74.79-321.27) vs benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (84.31, 95 % CI 6.47-162.15, P < 0.01). The PCA3 score (cutoff 35) had a sensitivity of 85.7 % and specificity of 62.5 %. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed higher areas under the ROC curve for the PCA3 score vs PSA, but without statistical significance.  Conclusions:   Increased PCA3 in biopsy tissue correlated with prostate cancer and the PCA3 assay may improve the diagnosis efficacy as the PCA3 score being independent of PSA level. The diagnostic significance of urinary PCA3 testing should be explored in future study to determine the prediction value in guiding biopsy decision as the clinical relevance of current study was limited for PCA3 testing based on biopsy tissue in a limited number of Chinese men.""","""['Jin Huang', 'Kathleen H Reilly', 'Hui-Zhen Zhang', 'Hai-Bo Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Prostate health index and prostate cancer gene 3 score but not percent-free Prostate Specific Antigen have a predictive role in differentiating histological prostatitis from PCa and other nonneoplastic lesions (BPH and HG-PIN) at repeat biopsy.', 'PCA3 sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection in patients with abnormal PSA and/or suspicious digital rectal examination.

Methods:   We conducted a prospective, observational study among general practitioners in Army Medical Unit by sending them a self-assessment questionnaire. Physicians should report on their practices for screening cancers with official screening recommendations. Compliance rates with the recommendations were reviewed. Screening practices for other cancers (prostate cancer, melanoma, thyroid cancer, lung cancer, testicular cancer) were assessed.  Results:   A total of 133 questionnaires were analyzed. Despite a strong involvement of army general health practitioners, guidelines adherence rates (examination frequency, ages of screening beginning and ending) were of 4% for cervical cancer, 7% for breast cancer, and 37% for colorectal cancer. Those rates are comparable to those reported with civilian general practitioners. For cancers without screening recommendation, practitioners felt highly concerned, especially for the most common cancers among the military population. One third of physicians stated that they had diagnosed a testicular cancer through routine screening.

This paper describes the enhancement of a curriculum for training lay health advisors, called prostate cancer ambassadors, on informed decision-making for prostate cancer screening. Adult learning theory informed the structuring of the training sessions to be interactive, self-directed, and engaging. Trainings were developed in a manner that made the material relevant to the learners and encouraged co-learning. The research team developed strategies, such as using discussions and interactive activities, to help community members weigh the pros and cons of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and to make an informed decision about screening. Furthermore, activities were developed to bolster four social cognitive theory constructs: observational learning, self-efficacy for presenting information to the community and for making an informed decision themselves, collective efficacy for presenting information to the community, and outcome expectations from those presentations. Games, discussions, and debates were included to make learning fun and encourage discovery. Practice sessions and team-building activities were designed to build self-efficacy for sharing information about informed decision-making. Topics added to the original curriculum included updates on prostate cancer screening, informed decision-making for screening, skills for being a lay health advisor, and ethics. This dynamic model and approach to lay health advisor (ambassador) training is flexible: while it was tailored for use with prostate cancer education, it can be adjusted for use with other types of cancer and even other diseases.""","""['Anissa I Vines', 'Jaimie C Hunter', 'Veronica A Carlisle', 'Alan N Richmond']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Prostate Cancer Ambassadors: Process and Outcomes of a Prostate Cancer Informed Decision-Making Training Program.', 'Building Capacity in a Rural North Carolina Community to Address Prostate Health Using a Lay Health Advisor Model.', 'Addressing the challenge of informed decision making in prostate cancer community outreach to African American men.', 'Social ecological predictors of prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal examination in black American men.', 'Decision making and prostate cancer screening.', 'Prostate Cancer Ambassadors: Process and Outcomes of a Prostate Cancer Informed Decision-Making Training Program.']"""

However, little is known about its function in cancer.  Method:   We investigated the mRNA profile alterations induced by Esrrb expression and its synthetic ligand DY131 in human prostate cancer DU145 cells via RNA-Seq analysis.  Results:   We distinguished 67 mRNAs differentially expressed by Esrrb alone. Although DY131 alone did not change any gene, treatment of DY131 in the presence of Esrrb altered 1161 mRNAs. These observations indicated Esrrb had both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent activity. When Esrrb was expressed, DY131 treatment further regulated 15 Esrrb-altered mRNAs. DY131 acted as an antagonist for 11 of 15 mRNAs (wdr52, f13a1, pxdn, spns2, loc100506599, tagln, loc441454, tkel1, sema3f, zcwpw2, sdc2) and as an agonist for 4 of the 15 mRNAs (rarres3, oasl, padi2, ddx60). Gene ontology analyses showed altered genes are related to transcription and translation regulation, cell proliferation and apoptosis regulation, and cellular metabolism.

Here, we investigate the genomic sequences around fusion junctions to better understand the transcriptional mechanisms mediating fusion transcription/splicing. We analyzed data from prostate (cancer) cells as previous studies have shown extensively that these cells readily undergo fusion transcription.  Results:   We used the FusionMap program to identify high-confidence fusion transcripts from RNAseq data. The RNAseq datasets were from our (N = 8) and other (N = 14) clinical prostate tumors with adjacent non-cancer cells, and from the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line that were mock-, androgen- (DHT), and anti-androgen- (bicalutamide, enzalutamide) treated. In total, 185 fusion transcripts were identified from all RNAseq datasets. The majority (76%) of these fusion transcripts were 'read-through chimeras' derived from adjacent genes in the genome. Characterization of sequences at fusion loci were carried out using a combination of the FusionMap program, custom Perl scripts, and the RNAfold program. Our computational analysis indicated that most fusion junctions (76%) use the consensus GT-AG intron donor-acceptor splice site, and most fusion transcripts (85%) maintained the open reading frame. We assessed whether parental genes of fusion transcripts have the potential to form complementary base pairing between parental genes which might bring them into physical proximity. Our computational analysis of sequences flanking fusion junctions at parental loci indicate that these loci have a similar propensity as non-fusion loci to hybridize. The abundance of repetitive sequences at fusion and non-fusion loci was also investigated given that SINE repeats are involved in aberrant gene transcription. We found few instances of repetitive sequences at both fusion and non-fusion junctions. Finally, RT-qPCR was performed on RNA from both clinical prostate tumors and adjacent non-cancer cells (N = 7), and LNCaP cells treated as above to validate the expression of seven fusion transcripts and their respective parental genes. We reveal that fusion transcript expression is similar to the expression of parental genes.  Conclusions:   Fusion transcripts maintain the open reading frame, and likely use the same transcriptional machinery as non-fusion transcripts as they share many genomic features at splice/fusion junctions.""","""['John Lai', 'Jiyuan An', 'Inge Seim', 'Carina Walpole', 'Andrea Hoffman', 'Leire Moya', 'Srilakshmi Srinivasan', 'Joanna L Perry-Keene;Australian Prostate Cancer Bioresource;Chenwei Wang', 'Melanie L Lehman', 'Colleen C Nelson', 'Judith A Clements', 'Jyotsna Batra']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Erratum to: Fusion transcript loci share many genomic features with non-fusion loci.', 'ChimPipe: accurate detection of fusion genes and transcription-induced chimeras from RNA-seq data.', 'Bone extracellular matrix induces homeobox proteins independent of androgens: possible mechanism for androgen-independent growth in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Widespread splicing of repetitive element loci into coding regions of gene transcripts.', 'Discovery and Classification of Fusion Transcripts in Prostate Cancer and Normal Prostate Tissue.', 'Advances in Transcriptomics: Investigating Cardiovascular Disease at Unprecedented Resolution.', 'Overview of research on fusion genes in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Signatures of Fusion Proteins in Cancer.', 'A New Era of Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.', 'FusionPro, a Versatile Proteogenomic Tool for Identification of Novel Fusion Transcripts and Their Potential Translation Products in Cancer Cells.', 'Genome-wide colocalization of RNA-DNA interactions and fusion RNA pairs.']"""

Moreover, although attachment and greater disclosure of sexual orientation have been associated with health outcomes, their associations in this population have been largely unexamined. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether greater outness about one's sexual orientation significantly mediated the associations between anxious and avoidant attachment and illness intrusiveness among gay men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Ninety-two gay and bisexual men who had received a diagnosis of prostate cancer in the past 4 years were recruited for the present study. Self-report questionnaires assessed demographic and medical variables, attachment, outness level and comfort, and illness intrusiveness. Bootstrapping procedures were used to assess for mediation.  Results:   Results suggested significant associations between anxious attachment, outness comfort, and illness intrusiveness. Less comfort with outness significantly mediated the association between greater anxious attachment and more illness intrusiveness. Avoidant attachment was not significantly associated with illness intrusiveness.  Conclusions:   Findings support the mediating role of the subjective experience of being an out gay man in the association between anxious attachment and illness intrusiveness. These results suggest that facilitating greater comfort with outness would be beneficial for illness adjustment among gay men with prostate cancer whom have more anxious attachment styles.

Materials and methods:   We examined the experience of 224 men treated with radical prostatectomy from 1997 to 2009 at Kaiser Permanente Northwest, a large prepaid health plan in Portland, Oregon. Study subjects had aggressive prostate cancer with at least 1 of several criteria such as preoperative prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or greater, pathological Gleason score 8 or greater, stage pT3 disease or positive surgical margins at prostatectomy. The primary end point was clinical recurrence or metastasis after surgery evaluated using a time dependent c-index. Secondary end points were biochemical recurrence and salvage treatment failure. We compared the performance of Decipher alone to the widely used CAPRA-S (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical) score, and assessed the independent contributions of Decipher, CAPRA-S and their combination for the prediction of recurrence and treatment failure.  Results:   Of the 224 patients treated 12 experienced clinical recurrence, 68 had biochemical recurrence and 34 experienced salvage treatment failure. At 10 years after prostatectomy the recurrence rate was 2.6% among patients with low Decipher scores but 13.6% among those with high Decipher scores (p=0.02). When CAPRA-S and Decipher scores were considered together, the discrimination accuracy of the ROC curve was increased by 0.11 compared to the CAPRA-S score alone (combined c-index 0.84 at 10 years after radical prostatectomy) for clinical recurrence.

After intravenous administration of fluorescein 15 patients underwent in vivo intraoperative confocal laser endomicroscopy of prostatic and periprostatic structures using a 2.6 or 0.85 mm imaging probe. Standard robotic instruments were used to grasp and maneuver the confocal laser endomicroscopy probes for image acquisition. Confocal laser endomicroscopy imaging was performed ex vivo on fresh prostate specimens from 20 patients. Confocal video sequences acquired in vivo and ex vivo were reviewed and analyzed, with additional image processing using a mosaicing algorithm. Processed confocal images were compared with standard hematoxylin and eosin analysis of imaged regions.  Results:   Confocal laser endomicroscopy was successfully integrated with robotic surgery, including co-registration of confocal video sequences with white light and probe handling with standard robotic instrumentation. Intraoperative confocal laser endomicroscopy imaging of the neurovascular bundle before and after nerve sparing dissection revealed characteristic features including dynamic vascular flow and intact axon fibers.

The aim of this study was to compare the cytotoxic, antioxidant and antitumoral activities of an ethanolic extract of Egyptian propolis (EEP) in vitro with an established chemotherapeutic drug such as doxorubicin (DOX), and the effects of their combination against the PC3 human prostate cancer cell line. Cellular viability and IC50 levels with EEP, DOX and their (v/v) combination were detected by sulphorhodamine-B (SRB) assay after incubation of PC3 cells for 72 h with different doses (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μg/ml). Two selected doses of IC50 and IC25 were applied to cells for 24h for antitumor evaluation assay of treatment compounds. EEP and its (v/v) combination with DOX showed significant antitumor potential besides high antioxidant properties of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase (CAT), nitric oxide (NO) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels when compared with the control untreated cells. DNA fragmentation assay and semi quantitative RT-PCR analyses for p53 and Bax genes showed that EEP activated cellular apoptosis and increased the mRNA expression levels more than other treatment.

Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed on its chemopreventive action, including ceramide accumulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress induction and NFκB inhibition. However, the precise mechanisms by which capsaicin exerts its anti-proliferative effect in prostate cancer cells remain questionable. Herein, we have tested the involvement of autophagy on the capsaicin mechanism of action on prostate cancer LNCaP and PC-3 cells.The results showed that capsaicin induced prostate cancer cell death in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, increased the levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II, a marker of autophagy) and the accumulation of the cargo protein p62 suggesting an autophagy blockage. Moreover, confocal microscopy revealed that capsaicin treatment increased lysosomes which co-localized with LC3 positive vesicles in a similar extent to that produced by the lysosomal protease inhibitors E64 and pepstatin pointing to an autophagolysosomes breakdown inhibition. Furthermore, we found that capsaicin triggered ROS generation in cells, while the levels of ROS decreased with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger. Co-treatment of cells with NAC and capsaicin abrogated the effects of capsaicin on autophagy and cell death. Normal prostate PNT2 and RWPE-1 cells were more resistant to capsaicin-induced cytotoxicity and did not accumulate p62 protein.Taken together, these results suggest that ROS-mediated capsaicin-induced autophagy blockage contributes to antiproliferation in prostate cancer cells, which provides new insights into the anticancer molecular mechanism of capsaicin.""","""['Ágata Ramos-Torres', 'Alicia Bort', 'Cecilia Morell', 'Nieves Rodríguez-Henche', 'Inés Díaz-Laviada']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['α-Solanine induces ROS-mediated autophagy through activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and inhibition of Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'Inhibiting ROS-STAT3-dependent autophagy enhanced capsaicin-induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Chrysin induces death of prostate cancer cells by inducing ROS and ER stress.', 'Effect of capsaicin on prostate cancer cells.', 'Anticancer Properties and Pharmaceutical Applications of Plumbagin: A Review.', 'Targeting the Interplay of Autophagy and ROS for Cancer Therapy: An Updated Overview on Phytochemicals.', 'Role of Plant-Derived Active Constituents in Cancer Treatment and Their Mechanisms of Action.', 'The Natural Chemotherapeutic Capsaicin Activates AMPK through LKB1 Kinase and TRPV1 Receptors in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Capsaicin exerts therapeutic effects by targeting tNOX-SIRT1 axis and augmenting ROS-dependent autophagy in melanoma cancer cells.', 'Capsaicin Potentiates Anticancer Drug Efficacy Through Autophagy-Mediated Ribophorin II Downregulation and Necroptosis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells.']"""

Their impacts to PCa therapy, however, remained unclear. Here we found PCa could recruit more mast cells than normal prostate epithelial cells then alter PCa chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitivity, leading to PCa more resistant to these therapies. Mechanism dissection revealed that infiltrated mast cells could increase p21 expression via modulation of p38/p53 signals, and interrupting p38-p53 signals via siRNAs of p53 or p21 could reverse mast cell-induced docetaxel chemotherapy resistance of PCa. Furthermore, recruited mast cells could also increase the phosphorylation of ATM at ser-1981 site, and inhibition of ATM activity could reverse mast cell-induced radiotherapy resistance. The in vivo mouse model with xenografted PCa C4-2 cells co-cultured with mast cells also confirmed that mast cells could increase PCa chemotherapy resistance via activating p38/p53/p21 signaling. Together, our results provide a new mechanism showing infiltrated mast cells could alter PCa chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitivity via modulating the p38/p53/p21 signaling and phosphorylation of ATM.

Materials and methods:   Using register data on all men in Stockholm County in 2013 (n = 1,052,841), the limited-duration point prevalence of PSA testing and time between test and prostate biopsy or repeat testing were analysed. Patterns of follow-up were assessed using Kaplan-Meier product limit estimators and Cox proportional hazard models. Educational length was categorized as short (≤ 9 years), intermediate (10-12 years) or long (≥ 13 years).  Results:   PSA testing increased with educational length in all age groups. Among men aged 50-69 years, 61% with long and 54% with short education had had a PSA test within the preceding 10 years (p < 0.001). In men with PSA 4-10 ng/ml, 40% [95% confidence interval (CI) 38-41] with long and 27% (95% CI 26-29) with short education underwent a prostate biopsy within 12 months. After adjusting for PSA level and age, educational length was still associated with the chance of having a prostate biopsy in men with PSA 4-10 ng/ml (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.12-1.31), but not in men with higher PSA values.  Conclusion:   PSA testing increased with educational length. Men with long education were more likely to have a prostate biopsy after an increased PSA value below 10 ng/ml than men with short education.

In silico analysis of FYN expression in prostate cancer cell line databases revealed an association with the expression of neuroendocrine (NE) markers such as CHGA, CD44, CD56, and SYP. The loss of FYN abrogated the invasion of PC3 and ARCaPM cells in response to MET receptor ligand HGF. FYN also contributed to the metastatic potential of NEPC cells in two mouse models of visceral metastasis with two different cell lines (PC3 and TRAMPC2-RANKL). The activation of MET appeared to regulate neuroendocrine (NE) features as evidenced by increased expression of NE markers in PC3 cells with HGF. Importantly, the overexpression of FYN protein in DU145 cells was directly correlated with the increase of CHGA. Thus, our data demonstrated that the neuroendocrine differentiation that occurs in PCa cells is, at least in part, regulated by FYN kinase.

Sustained activation of AR under androgen-deprived conditions may be due to its interaction with co-activators, such as p52 NF-κB subunit, and/or an increase in its stability by phosphorylation that delays its degradation. Here we identified a specific inhibitor of AR/p52 interaction, AR/p52-02, via a high throughput screen based on the reconstitution of Gaussia Luciferase. We found that AR/p52-02 markedly inhibited growth of both castration-resistant C4-2 (IC50 ∼6 μM) and parental androgen-dependent LNCaP (IC50 ∼4 μM) human prostate cancer cells under low androgen conditions. Growth inhibition was associated with significantly reduced nuclear p52 levels and DNA binding activity, as well as decreased phosphorylation of AR at serine 81, increased AR ubiquitination, and decreased AR transcriptional activity as indicated by decreased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA levels in both cell lines. AR/p52-02 also caused a reduction in levels of p21(WAF/CIP1), which is a direct AR targeted gene in that its expression correlates with androgen stimulation and mitogenic proliferation in prostate cancer under physiologic levels of androgen, likely by disrupting the AR signaling axis. The reduced level of cyclinD1 reported previously for this compound may be due to the reduction in nuclear presence and activity of p52, which directly regulates cyclinD1 expression, as well as the reduction in p21(WAF/CIP1), since p21(WAF/CIP1) is reported to stabilize nuclear cyclinD1 in prostate cancer.

The present study examined the effects of PEDF on cell growth, in addition to the gene expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is involved in prostate cancer progression, in the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line. Exogenous Cav led to a dose-dependent upregulation of the mRNA expression of IL-8 in PC-3 cells, which was blocked by treatment with 1 or 10 nM PEDF, or following the overexpression of small interfering RNAs directed against Cav. Cav (10 nM) increased DNA synthesis in PC-3 cells, which was again suppressed by the administration of 10 nM PEDF.

Despite numerous oncogenic alterations implicated in metastatic prostate cancer, mutations of kinases are rare. Several lines of evidence suggest that nonmutated kinases and their pathways are involved in prostate cancer progression, but few kinases have been mechanistically linked to metastasis. Using a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics dataset in concert with gene expression analysis, we selected over 100 kinases potentially implicated in human metastatic prostate cancer for functional evaluation. A primary in vivo screen based on overexpression of candidate kinases in murine prostate cells identified 20 wild-type kinases that promote metastasis. We queried these 20 kinases in a secondary in vivo screen using human prostate cells. Strikingly, all three RAF family members, MERTK, and NTRK2 drove the formation of bone and visceral metastasis confirmed by positron-emission tomography combined with computed tomography imaging and histology. Immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays indicated that these kinases are highly expressed in human metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer tissues. Our functional studies reveal the strong capability of select wild-type protein kinases to drive critical steps of the metastatic cascade, and implicate these kinases in possible therapeutic intervention.""","""['Claire M Faltermeier', 'Justin M Drake', 'Peter M Clark', 'Bryan A Smith', 'Yang Zong', 'Carmen Volpe', 'Colleen Mathis', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Brandon Castor', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Owen N Witte']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Prostate cancer: A walk on the wild side - wild-type kinases promote metastasis.', 'Driven to metastasize: Kinases as potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Screening for functional kinases in metastatic prostate cancer: a glimmer of hope for kinase inhibition.', 'Prostate cancer: A walk on the wild side - wild-type kinases promote metastasis.', 'Severe combined immunodeficient-hu model of human prostate cancer metastasis to human bone.', 'CCR5 receptor antagonists block metastasis to bone of v-Src oncogene-transformed metastatic prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Animal models of bone metastasis.', 'Exploring tumor-normal cross-talk with TranNet: role of the environment in tumor progression.', 'Advancements in Oncoproteomics Technologies: Treading toward Translation into Clinical Practice.', 'Protein kinase CK2 - diverse roles in cancer cell biology and therapeutic promise.', 'MEK inhibitor sensitivity in BRAF fusion-driven prostate cancer.', 'HGK promotes metastatic dissemination in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   An epidemiological, cross-sectional, multicentre study was conducted. 567 PCa patients that had undergone radical prostatectomy (RP) and received postoperative RT between February and December of both 2006 and 2011 participated in the study. In patients from 2006, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EPIC questionnaire. Investigators completed a specific survey on two clinical cases of adjuvant and salvage RT.  Results:   70.6 % of patients received salvage RT versus 29.4 % who received adjuvant RT; no significant differences were found in terms of frequency for each procedure between both the years. Regarding the survey, a positive surgical margin was the main criteria used in adjuvant RT decision making. In terms of salvage RT scenario, 85.7 % of the investigators stated that adjuvant RT should have been offered instead, 81.4 % of the investigators agreed on a PSA score >0.2 ng/mL as the main criteria for identifying biochemical recurrence after RP, and 67.4 % of investigators did not consider any PSA score for ruling out salvage RT treatment.  Conclusions:   Most patients are referred to RO departments to receive salvage RT. Despite the publication of three IA evidence level randomized clinical trials, the patterns for using adjuvant and salvage RT did not change from 2006 to 2011, although patients' profile did.

We assessed unmet needs in 10 domains: day-to-day activities, financial expenses, emotional concerns, medical treatment, cancer information, home care, nutrition, physical concerns, family relationships, and spirituality. We also assessed self-reported measures related to quality of life. This national sample of AAPI cancer survivors included people from 14 states and two territories who had been diagnosed with a broad range of cancers, including cancer of the breast, ovary/uterus/cervix, prostate, blood, and other sites. Over 80 % reported at least one unmet need. Participants reported an average of 8.4 unmet needs, spanning an average of 3.9 domains. Most commonly reported were unmet needs pertaining to physical concerns (66 %), day-to-day activities (52 %), and emotional concerns (52 %). This is the first report of unmet needs in a national sample of AAPI cancer survivors with a range of different cancer types.

The purpose of this workshop was to discuss potential indications, current available evidence, and designs for future trials to provide the evidence needed by patients and providers to decide how and when to use PGA.  Methods:   A workshop evaluating PGA for prostate cancer was held in New Orleans, Louisiana, in May 2015. Invited experts representing all stakeholders and attendees discussed the regulatory development of medical products, technology available, potential indications, and designs of trials to evaluate this modality of therapy.  Results:   The panel presented the current information on the technologies available to perform PGA, the potential indications, and results of prior consensus conferences. Use of magnetic resonance imaging for patient selection, guide therapy, and follow-up was discussed. Designs of trials to assess PGA outcomes were discussed.  Conclusion:   The general consensus was that currently available technologies are capable of selective ablation with reasonable accuracy, but that criteria for patient selection remain debatable, and long-term cancer control remains to be established in properly designed and well-performed prospective clinical trials. Concerns include the potential for excessive, unnecessary use in patients with low-risk cancer and, conversely, that current diagnostic techniques may underestimate the extent and aggressiveness of some cancers, leading to inadequate treatment.""","""['Jonathan P Jarow', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Samir S Taneja', 'Peter T Scardino']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urology""","""['SPARED Collaboration: Patient Selection for Partial Gland Ablation in Men with Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Drug and device development for localized prostate cancer: report of a Food and Drug Administration/American Urological Association public workshop.', 'Standardized Nomenclature and Surveillance Methodologies After Focal Therapy and Partial Gland Ablation for Localized Prostate Cancer: An International Multidisciplinary Consensus.', 'Clinical trial design for the development of new therapies for nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer: report of a Food and Drug Administration and American Urological Association public workshop.', 'Oncological control following partial gland ablation for intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Combination of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transperineal template-guided mapping prostate biopsy to determine potential candidates for focal therapy.', ""Minimally Invasive Procedures in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer: an Interventional Radiologist's Perspective."", 'The effect of different surface treatment methods on the physical, chemical and biological performances of a PGA scaffold.', 'Defining the index lesion for potential salvage partial or hemi-gland ablation after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Using spatial tracking with magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound-guided biopsy to identify unilateral prostate cancer.']"""

Since their cultivation is a problem, TFs in Taiwan are primarily imported from China, which has a problem with pesticide residues. Thus, the question of whether the Taiwan cultivated TFs, T1, and T6 showed similar or even better results than TFs from China (CH) was assessed in the present study. The results of the physicochemical tests of these TFs showed that T1 extracted by hot water (T1H) has the highest concentration of polysaccharide; meanwhile, T6 extracted by cold water (T6C) showed the highest amount of protein. Regarding the immune modulatory effects of these TFs, hot water extracts of these TFs augmented significantly the inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-[Formula: see text] mRNA expression than those of cold water extracts. On the other hand, the cold water extracts of TFs, especially of T1C, obviously suppressed cancer cell survival better than those of hot water extracts. Interestingly, we found that hot water extracts of TFs may augment necrotic cell death, whereas, cold water extracts of TFs induce apoptosis. Furthermore, we also showed that these TFs activate caspase-3 cleavage, up regulate the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and decrease MMP-9 expressions in PC-3 cells.

Thus, other therapeutic options are needed as alternatives or in addition to the classic approaches to prevent or delay tumor progression. Catecholamines participate to the control of prostate cell functions by the activation of alpha1-adrenoreceptors (alpha1-AR) and increased sympathetic activity has been linked to PC development and evolution. Molecular and pharmacological studies identified three alpha1-AR subtypes (A, B and D), which differ in tissue distribution, cell signaling, pharmacology and physiological role. Within the prostate, alpha1A-ARs mainly control stromal cell functions, while alpha1B- and alpha1D- subtypes seem to modulate glandular epithelial cell growth. The possible direct contribution of alpha1D-ARs in tumor biology is supported by their overexpression in PC. The studies here presented investigate the ""in vitro"" antitumor action of A175, a selective alpha1D-AR antagonist we have recently obtained by modifying the potent, but not subtype-selective alpha1-AR antagonist (S)-WB4101, in the hormone-refractory PC3 and DU145 PC cell lines. The results indicate that A175 has an alpha1D-AR-mediated significant and dose-dependent antiproliferative action that possibly involves the induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis. In addition, A175 reduces cell migration and adhesiveness to culture plates. In conclusion, our work clarified some cellular aspects promoted by alpha1D-AR activity modulation and supports a further pharmacological approach in the cure of hormone-refractory PC, by targeting specifically this AR subtype.""","""['Alessandra Colciago', 'Ornella Mornati', 'Nicola Ferri', 'Luca Franco Castelnovo', 'Laura Fumagalli', 'Cristiano Bolchi', 'Marco Pallavicini', 'Ermanno Valoti', 'Paola Negri-Cesi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Pharmacol Res""","""['Dominance of the alpha1B-adrenergic receptor and its subcellular localization in human and TRAMP prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Structure-activity relationships in 1,4-benzodioxan-related compounds. 8.(1) {2-2-(4-chlorobenzyloxy)phenoxyethyl}-2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxy)ethylamine (clopenphendioxan) as a tool to highlight the involvement of alpha1D- and alpha1B-adrenoreceptor subtypes in the regulation of human PC-3 prostate cancer cell apoptosis and proliferation.', 'Contraction of Rat Cauda Epididymis Smooth Muscle to α1-Adrenoceptor Activation Is Mediated by α1A-Adrenoceptors.', 'The role of alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes in benign prostatic hyperplasia-from bed to bench.', 'Recent progress in alpha1-adrenergic receptor research.', 'The downregulation of NCXs is positively correlated with the prognosis of stage II-IV colon cancer.', 'Drug Repositioning of the α1-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonist Naftopidil: A Potential New Anti-Cancer Drug?', 'Tumor-induced neurogenesis and immune evasion as targets of innovative anti-cancer therapies.', 'A Genomic-clinicopathologic Nomogram for the Preoperative Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Bladder Cancer.']"""

The relationship between a clinical history of prostatitis and histologic inflammation in terms of how these two manifestations of prostatic inflammation jointly contribute to prostate cancer risk and whether racial differences exist in this relationship is uncertain.  Methods:   Using a nested design within a cohort of men with benign prostate tissue specimens, we analyzed the data on both clinically-diagnosed prostatitis (NIH categories I-III) and histological inflammation in 574 prostate cancer case-control pairs (345 white, 229 African American).  Results:   Clinical prostatitis was not associated with increased prostate cancer risk in the full sample, but showed a suggestive inverse association with prostate cancer in African Americans (odds ratio (OR)=0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.27-0.81). In whites, clinical prostatitis increased risk by 40%, but was only associated with a significant increased prostate cancer risk in the absence of evidence of histological inflammation (OR=3.56; 95% CI=1.15-10.99). Moreover, PSA velocity (P=0.008) and frequency of PSA testing (P=0.003) were significant modifiers of risk. Clinical prostatitis increased risk of prostate cancer almost three-fold (OR=2.97; 95% CI=1.40-6.30) in white men with low PSA velocity and about twofold in white men with more frequent PSA testing (OR=1.91; 95% CI=1.09-3.35).  Conclusions:   In our cohort of men with benign prostate specimens, race, and histological inflammation were important cofactors in the relationship between clinical prostatitis and prostate cancer. Clinical prostatitis was associated with a slightly decreased risk for prostate cancer in African American men. In white men, the relationship between clinical prostatitis and prostate cancer risk was modified by histological prostatic inflammation, PSA velocity, and frequency of PSA testing-suggesting a complex interplay between these indications of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer detection.""","""['B A Rybicki', 'O N Kryvenko', 'Y Wang', 'M Jankowski', 'S Trudeau', 'D A Chitale', 'N S Gupta', 'A Rundle', 'D Tang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Potential effect of anti-inflammatory drug use on PSA kinetics and subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis: Risk stratification in black and white men with benign prostate biopsy.', 'Inflammatory infiltrate (prostatitis) in whole mounted radical prostatectomy specimens from black and white patients is not an etiology for racial difference in prostate specific antigen.', 'Inflammation in prostate biopsies of men without prostatic malignancy or clinical prostatitis: correlation with total serum PSA and PSA density.', 'Current Knowledge of the Potential Links between Inflammation and Prostate Cancer.', 'The issue of prostate cancer evaluation in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen and chronic prostatitis.', 'The association between prostatitis and risk of prostate cancer: a National Health Insurance Database study.', 'Serum thymidine kinase 1 concentration as a predictive biomarker in prostate cancer.', 'Genetic Contributions to Prostate Cancer Disparities in Men of West African Descent.', 'Racial differences in the systemic inflammatory response to prostate cancer.', 'Increased Preoperative Plasma Level of Microbial 16S rDNA Translocation Is Associated With Relapse After Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Thus, the objective of the present study was to refine the AUA/ASTRO guideline for ART in patients at risk for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP. To this end, we reviewed our prospectively maintained database and selected 193 patients who met the AUA/ASTRO ART criteria. With a median follow-up of 24.0 months, BCR rate was 17.6% (34/193). When stratified by the Gleason score, BCR rate in men with Gleason score 6 was 6.8%. There was no significant association between BCR-free survival and surgical margin (P = 0.690) and pathologic stage (P = 0.353) in patients with the Gleason score 6. However, in patients with positive surgical margins (PSMs)/pathologic stage ≥T3, there was a significant difference in BCR-free survival according to Gleason score (≤ 7 vs 8-10, P = 0.047). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that pathologic stage ≥T3 (HR = 2.106; P= 0.018), PSMs (HR = 2.411; P= 0.003), and pathologic Gleason score 8-10 (HR = 4.715; P< 0.001) were independent predictors of BCR after RP. Therefore, in addition to pathologic stage ≥T3 and PSMs, Gleason score 8-10 predicts BCR after RP.

Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds bind to XPO-1 and block its ability to export cargo proteins. Here, we investigated the effects of a new class of SINE compounds in models of prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   We evaluated the expression of XPO-1 in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Next, six SINE (KPT-127, KPT-185, KPT-205, KPT-225, KPT-251 and KPT-330) compounds having different potency with broad-spectrum, tumor-selective cytotoxicity, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles were tested in a panel of prostate cancer cells representing distinct differentiation/progression states of disease and genotypes. Two SINE candidates for clinical trials (KPT-251 and KPT-330) were also tested in vivo in three cell models of aggressive prostate cancer engrafted in male nude mice.  Results and conclusions:   XPO-1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer compared to normal or hyperplastic tissues. Increased XPO-1 expression, mainly in the nuclear compartment, was associated with increased Gleason score and bone metastatic potential supporting the use of SINEs in advanced prostate cancer. SINE compounds inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of tumor cells, but did not affect immortalized non-transformed prostate epithelial cells. Nuclei from SINE treated cells showed increased protein localization of XPO-1, survivin and cyclin D1 followed by degradation of these proteins leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Oral administration of KPT-251 and KPT-330 in PC3, DU145 and 22rv1 tumor-bearing nude mice reduced tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis and induced apoptosis. Our results provide supportive evidence for the therapeutic use of SINE compounds in advanced/castration resistant prostate cancers and warrants further clinical investigation.""","""['Giovanni Luca Gravina', 'Andrea Mancini', 'Patrizia Sanita', 'Flora Vitale', 'Francesco Marampon', 'Luca Ventura', 'Yosef Landesman', 'Dilara McCauley', 'Michael Kauffman', 'Sharon Shacham', 'Claudio Festuccia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Erratum to: KPT-330, a potent and selective exportin-1 (XPO-1) inhibitor, shows antitumor effects modulating the expression of cyclin D1 and survivin in prostate cancer models.', 'Pharmacological treatment with inhibitors of nuclear export enhances the antitumor activity of docetaxel in human prostate cancer.', 'Anti-tumor activity of selective inhibitors of XPO1/CRM1-mediated nuclear export in diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: the role of survivin.', 'Selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) as novel therapeutics for prostate cancer.', 'Selinexor for the treatment of multiple myeloma.', 'Selinexor (KTP-330) - a selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE): anti-tumor activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).', 'The Complex Relationship between Hypoxia Signaling, Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Inflammation in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease: Insights from the Molecular Mechanisms to Therapeutic Approaches.', 'High Throughput Fluorescence-Based In Vitro Experimental Platform for the Identification of Effective Therapies to Overcome Tumour Microenvironment-Mediated Drug Resistance in AML.', 'Synthetic lethal targeting of TET2-mutant haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by XPO1 inhibitors.', 'The efficacy of selinexor (KPT-330), an XPO1 inhibitor, on non-hematologic cancers: a comprehensive review.', 'The molecular mechanism and challenge of targeting XPO1 in treatment of relapsed and refractory myeloma.']"""

Methods:   Fatigue was measured in 40 men with prostate cancer (20 receiving EBRT and 20 controls on active surveillance) using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F). EBRT subjects were followed from baseline to midpoint and end point of EBRT, while controls were seen at one time point. EBRT subjects were categorized into high- and low-fatigue groups based on change in FACT-F scores from baseline to EBRT completion. Full genome microarray was performed from peripheral leukocyte RNA to determine gene expression changes related to fatigue phenotypes. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed the most differentially expressed gene in the microarray experiment.  Results:   At baseline, mean FACT-F scores were not different between EBRT subjects (44.3 ± 7.16) and controls (46.7 ± 4.32, p = .24). Fatigue scores of EBRT subjects decreased at treatment midpoint (38.6 ± 9.17, p = .01) and completion (37.6 ± 9.9, p = .06), indicating worsening fatigue. Differential expression of 42 genes was observed between fatigue groups when EBRT time points were controlled. Membrane-spanning four domains, subfamily A, member (MS4A1) was the most differentially expressed gene and was associated with fatigue at treatment end point (r = -.46, p = .04).  Conclusion:   Fatigue intensification was associated with MS4A1 downregulation, suggesting that fatigue during EBRT may be related to impairment in B-cell immune response.

Although this is a common practice, there are controversial studies on its usefulness. We wanted to compare the rate of prostate cancer diagnosis between processing samples in 2 containers and processing them in individual containers to see if there are differences. Our secondary objective was to check the rate of diagnosis of various tumour subtypes in each of the 2 groups.  Material and methods:   A retrospective observational study was conducted of 2,601 cases of prostate biopsies. Ten cores were extracted in each biopsy. We divided the sample into 2 groups: biopsies sent in 2 containers to the department of pathology (left and right lobes) or sent in 10 (one for each cylinder), according to the different criteria used in our centre in the past. We then classified the cases according to the absence of neoplasia, insignificant tumour (involvement of just 1 cylinder, <5%, Gleason score<7), Gleason 6 or Gleason≥7. A bivariate statistical analysis was performed using the chi-squared test.  Results:   A total of 1,777 participants were included in the 2-container group, and 824 were included in the 10-container group. We diagnosed a rate of 32.4% of cancers in the 2-container group and 40% in the 10-container group, a difference that was statistically significant (P<.001). The insignificant carcinomas were diagnosed more often in the 2-container group than in the 10-container group (6.4% vs. 4.3%, respectively; P=.03). Samples with a Gleason score of 6 were diagnosed more often in the 10-container group than in the 2-container group (11.9% vs. 8.1%, respectively; P=.002). The same occurred with the Gleason score≥7 (23.8% in the 10-container group vs. 17.9% in the 2-container group; P<.001).

Here, we have proposed a novel approach for identifying synergistic gene interactions directly from the continuous expression levels, using a minimum spanning tree (MST)-based algorithm. We have used this approach to find pairs of synergistically interacting genes in prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Sixty consecutive male patients (age, 64.5 ± 7.0 years) with clinically suspected prostate cancer were included. All patients underwent multiparametric MRI of the prostate (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging, and DCE-MRI) on a 3 T MRI scanner. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score of the detected lesions (group A: PI-RADS score ≤3, n = 30; group B: PI-RADS score >3, n = 30). In all patients, DCE-MRI was performed using a CAIPIRINHA-Dixon-TWIST Volume-Interpolated Breath-Hold Examination sequence (spatial resolution, 3 × 1.2 × 1.2 mm; temporal resolution, 5 seconds; total sampling duration, 4:10 minutes [250 seconds]) with body weight-adapted administration of contrast agent (gadobutrol, Gadovist; Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany). Six DCE-MRI series with different temporal resolutions ranging from 5 to 30 seconds per time point were retrospectively generated from the original data sets. Semiquantitative parameters (ie, wash-in, wash-out, and time-to-peak [TTP]) as well as pharmacokinetic parameters (ie, Ktrans, Kep, and ve) were calculated for the different temporal resolutions. Both lesion groups and all 6 DCE-MRI series were compared regarding semiquantitative and pharmacokinetic parameters. Diagnostic accuracy for the detection of potentially malignant lesions was calculated for all 6 series using ROC analysis.  Results:   A significant effect of temporal resolution was found on wash-in (P < 0.001). Series with temporal resolution lower than 10 s/time point showed significantly lower wash-in values with more pronounced effects in group B compared with group A. For 30-second series, the differences between both groups diminished reaching insignificant levels (P = 0.052), resulting in a significant decrease of the diagnostic accuracy of wash-in (area under the curve, 0.609; 95% confidence interval, 0.451-0.766; P < 0.015). No significant effects were detected on wash-out. For TTP, a significant effect of temporal resolution was detected (P < 0.001) with significantly increasing TTP levels for all down-sampled series compared with the original 5-second series. These effects did not impact the diagnostic accuracy of TTP. No significant effects of temporal resolution were detected on pharmacokinetic parameters (P < 0.112).

Herein, we discuss an alternative compound, the La(III) complex, [La(L(1))2Cl3]·7H2O based on a Schiff base ligand 2,3-dihydro-1H-indolo-[2,3-b]-phenazin-4(5H)-ylidene)benzothiazole-2-amine (L(1)), and report in vitro cell studies. Results of antitumor activity using cell viability assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and nuclear condensation in PC-3 (Human, prostate carcinoma) cells show that the metal complex is more potent than ligand. La(III) complexes have been synthesized by reaction of lanthanum(III) salt in 1:2M ratio with ligands L(1) and 3-(ethoxymethylene)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indolo[2,3-b]-phenazin-4(5H)-ylidene)benzathiazole-2-amine (L(2)) in methanol.

We assessed lung cancer risk by race, ethnicity, and sex among a nationally representative population eligible for lung cancer screening based on Medicare criteria.  Methods:   We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007-2012 to assess lung cancer risk by sex, race and ethnicity among persons satisfying Medicare age and pack-year smoking eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening. We assessed Medicare eligibility based on age (55-77 years) and pack-years (≥ 30). We assessed 6-year lung cancer risk using a risk prediction model from Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening trial that was modified in 2012 (PLCOm2012). We compared the proportions of eligible persons by sex, race and ethnicity using Medicare criteria with a risk cut-point that was adjusted to achieve comparable total number of persons eligible for screening.  Results:   Among the 29.7 million persons aged 55-77 years who ever smoked, we found that 7.3 million (24.5%) were eligible for lung cancer screening under Medicare criteria. Among those eligible, Blacks had statistically significant higher (4.4%) and Hispanics lower lung cancer risk (1.2%) than non-Hispanic Whites (3.2%). At a cut-point of 2.12% risk for lung screening eligibility, the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics showed statistically significant changes. Blacks eligible rose by 48% and Hispanics eligible declined by 63%. Black men and Hispanic women were affected the most. There was little change in eligibility among Whites.  Conclusion:   Medicare eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening do not align with estimated risk for lung cancer among Blacks and Hispanics.

The purpose of this study is to find significant receptors or biological markers for OAB-related symptoms for establishment of potential order-made therapeutic strategies. The overactive bladder symptom scores (OABSS) and international prostate symptom scores (IPSS)/quality of life (QOL) were questioned in all the 18 patients with OAB diagnosis. Their bladder mucosal tissues were taken from the random biopsy of bladder cancer suspected patients without any finding such as inflammation or carcinoma in situ. They were investigated quantitatively by immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings for inflammatory or immune-system (Interleukin (IL)-6 and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)), Caspase-3 apoptosis markers, angiogenesis (CD-31), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (E-cadherin) and muscarinic receptor (Muscarine-2 (M)-2), adrenergic receptors (ARs) (alpha 1-d (α1-d) and beta-3 (β-3)). The statistical correlation between the expressions of these 5 markers and 3 receptors and these symptom scores were examined under the comparison between OAB patients and control patients who had urgency score with less than 2 in OABSS. The OABSS and IPSS/QOL was 7.39 ± 2.69 and 21.2 ± 6.59/4.33 ± 1.33, respectively but those of control patients were 2.00 ± 1.41 and 10.1 ± 9.52/2.14 ± 1.46, respectively (P<0.05). Regarding the correlation of those markers' expressions and symptom scores, in OAB patients, OABSS total significantly correlated with β-3 AR expressions (P=0.0457). IPSS post-voiding significantly correlated with β-3 AR expressions (P=0.0308) but no significant relationship in control patients (P>0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that β-3 AR in our tested 8 markers or receptors was correlated strongly with OAB-related symptoms.

A search was made through our Urologic Pathology files for prostate needle core biopsies that were obtained via TMRI-GB. Forty-six patients were identified. Mean patient (PT) age was 62 years (range: 50-78 years). Twenty one of 46 PTs (46%) had a history of PCa, 10/46 PTs (22%) had a history of negative TRUS-GB and rising PSA, and the remaining 15/46 PTs (32%) had never undergone biopsy. Cancer detection rate on TMRI-GB was 57% for PTs with a prior diagnosis of PCa, 50% for PTs with a history of benign biopsy, and 67% who were biopsy naïve. An average of 3.16 cores were sampled from malignant lesions and an average of 2.74 were sampled from benign lesions (P=0.02). TMRI-GB has a higher cancer detection rate than TRUS-GB. TMRI-GB may have a critical role as a tool for active surveillance, tumor mapping, and primary detection of PCa, which will likely evolve as the ability to identify malignant lesions improve.

Our study confirms that the expression of KLK10 in prostate cancer tissue and cell lines (PC3, DU145, and LNCaP clone FGC) is low. Given that the androgen-independent growth characteristic of the PC3 cell line is more similar to clinical castration-resistant prostate cancer, we studied the role of KLK10 in PC3. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that over-expressing KLK10 in PC3 could decelerate tumour proliferation, which was accompanied with an increase in apoptosis and suppression of glucose metabolism. The related proteins, such as Bcl-2 and HK-2, were down-regulated subsequently. Furthermore, by up-regulating Bcl-2 or HK-2 respectively in the PC3-KLK10 cell line, we observed a subsequent increase of cell proliferation and a synchronous up-regulation of HK-2 and Bcl-2. Besides, KLK10 expression was also increased by Bcl-2 and HK-2, which suggests that there is a negative feedback loop between KLK10 and Bcl-2/HK-2.

Objective:   To investigate the incidence and clinical impact of minute PCa missed on routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides, but retrieved by α-methylacyl-CoA-racemase (AMACR) immunohistochemistry.  Methods:   AMACR immunohistochemistry was used to detect PCa missed on H&E slides in a series of consecutive 1,672 PNB including 1,003 patients without evidence of PCa, and 669 patients with PCa meeting pathological criteria for active surveillance (PCAS) under current clinical investigation, including Gleason score ≤7 (3 + 4), <33% of biopsies involved by cancer, <50% of any core involved by cancer. Using improved multicore (pre-) embedding techniques a single AMACR immunostain/patient was sufficient to detect missed lesions.  Results:   In patients without histological evidence of PCa, AMACR immunohistochemistry retrieved minute PCa in 33 of 1,003 patients (3.29%) and atypical small acinar proliferations (ASAP) in 17 of 1,003 patients (1.69%).

The expression of LKB1 at protein level was measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. The relationship between LKB1 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics was estimated by chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the overall survival of PCa patients with different LKB1 expression. Cox regression analysis was performed to estimate the significance of LKB1 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics in the prognosis of PCa patients. RESULTS The relative expression of LKB1 at mRNA level was significantly lower in PCa tissues than in the normal tissues (P<0.001).

The effects of these drugs are, however, limited and novel treatment strategies are required. Clear-cell type renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is chemo-resistant, in part, due to expression of multidrug resistance proteins such as p-glycoprotein. Cabazitaxel, a tubulin-binding taxane drug used for castration-resistant prostate cancer, has less affinity for p-glycoprotein compared to docetaxel. In the current study, the effects of docetaxel and cabazitaxel on ccRCC cells were investigated.  Materials and methods:   The expression of p-glycoprotein was evaluated in the ccRCC cell lines, Caki-1, KMRC-1 and OS-RC-2 by western blotting. Cells were treated with cabazitaxel or docetaxel, and growth kinetics and tubulin polymerization were determined by the WST-1 assay and cell-based tubulin polymerization assay, respectively. Intracellular drug concentrations were measured by chromatography. AKT activation after treatment was examined by western blotting.  Results:   All ccRCC cell lines expressed p-glycoprotein. Cabazitaxel inhibited cell growth and induced tubulin polymerization more potently than docetaxel. The intracellular concentration of cabazitaxel was much higher than docetaxel in all cell lines. Both docetaxel and cabazitaxel inhibit AKT phosphorylation at 5 min among three cells.

Focusing on the Polycomb protein EZH2 that deposits the H3K27me3 (trimethylation of Lys27 of histone H3) mark, we showed that its high expression in solid tumors is a consequence, not a cause, of tumorigenesis. In mouse and human models, EZH2 is dispensable for prostate cancer development and restrains breast tumorigenesis. High EZH2 expression in tumors results from a tight coupling to proliferation to ensure H3K27me3 homeostasis. However, this process malfunctions in breast cancer. Low EZH2 expression relative to proliferation and mutations in Polycomb genes actually indicate poor prognosis and occur in metastases. We show that while altered EZH2 activity consistently modulates a subset of its target genes, it promotes a wider transcriptional instability.

Higher BMI also increases estrogen production.  Methods:   We estimated the proportion of the BMI-ER(+) breast cancer association mediated through estrogen in a case-control study nested within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Participants included 143 women with invasive ER(+) breast cancer and 268 matched controls, all postmenopausal and never having used hormone therapy at baseline. We used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to measure 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites in baseline serum. We calculated BMI from self-reported height and weight at baseline. We estimated the mediating effect of unconjugated estradiol on the BMI-ER(+) breast cancer association using Aalen additive hazards and Cox regression models.  Results:   All estrogens and estrogen metabolites were statistically significantly correlated with BMI, with unconjugated estradiol most strongly correlated [Pearson correlation (r) = 0.45]. Approximately 7% to 10% of the effect of overweight, 12% to 15% of the effect of obesity, and 19% to 20% of the effect of a 5 kg/m(2) BMI increase on ER(+) breast cancer risk was mediated through unconjugated estradiol. The BMI-breast cancer association, once adjusted for unconjugated estradiol, was not modified by further adjustment for two metabolic ratios statistically significantly associated with both breast cancer and BMI.  Conclusion:   Circulating unconjugated estradiol levels partially mediate the BMI-breast cancer association, but other potentially important estrogen mediators (e.g., bioavailable estradiol) were not evaluated.

This cross-cancer site, pooled analysis was performed to increase the power to detect common variants of DNA repair genes associated with cancer susceptibility.  Methods:   We conducted a cross-cancer analysis of 60,297 single nucleotide polymorphisms, at 229 DNA repair gene regions, using data from the NCI Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON) Network. Our analysis included data from 32 GWAS and 48,734 controls and 51,537 cases across five cancer sites (breast, colon, lung, ovary, and prostate). Because of the unavailability of individual data, data were analyzed at the aggregate level. Meta-analysis was performed using the Association analysis for SubSETs (ASSET) software. To test for genetic associations that might escape individual variant testing due to small effect sizes, pathway analysis of eight DNA repair pathways was performed using hierarchical modeling.  Results:   We identified three susceptibility DNA repair genes, RAD51B (P < 5.09 × 10(-6)), MSH5 (P < 5.09 × 10(-6)), and BRCA2 (P = 5.70 × 10(-6)).

Conclusions:   Only three susceptibility loci were identified, which had all been previously reported.

Ectopic expression of ACSL4 in ACSL4-negative PCa cells increases proliferation, migration and invasion, while ablation of ACSL4 in PCa cells expressing endogenous ACSL4 reduces cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The cell proliferative effects were observed both in vitro, as well as in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis of human PCa tissue samples indicated ACSL4 expression is increased in malignant cells compared with adjacent benign epithelial cells, and particularly increased in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) when compared with hormone naive PCa. In cell lines co-expressing both ACSL4 and AR, proliferation was independent of exogenous androgens, suggesting that ACSL4 expression may lead to CRPC. In support for this hypothesis, ectopic ACSL4 expression induced resistance to treatment with Casodex, via decrease in apoptosis.

We reported previously that the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1α) can enhance AR activity by dephosphorylating a site in the AR hinge region (Ser650) and thereby decrease AR nuclear export. In this study we show that PP1α increases the expression of wildtype as well as an S650A mutant AR, indicating that it is acting through one or more additional mechanisms. We next show that PP1α binds primarily to the AR ligand binding domain and decreases its ubiquitylation and degradation. Moreover, we find that the PP1α inhibitor tautomycin increases phosphorylation of AR ubiquitin ligases including SKP2 and MDM2 at sites that enhance their activity, providing a mechanism by which PP1α may suppress AR degradation. Significantly, the tautomycin mediated decrease in AR expression was most pronounced at low androgen levels or in the presence of the AR antagonist enzalutamide. Consistent with this finding, the sensitivity of LNCaP and C4-2 PCa cells to tautomycin, as assessed by PSA synthesis and proliferation, was enhanced at low androgen levels or by treatment with enzalutamide. Together these results indicate that PP1α may contribute to stabilizing AR protein after androgen deprivation therapies, and that targeting PP1α or the AR-PP1α interaction may be effective in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).""","""['Xiaming Liu', 'Weiwei Han', 'Sarah Gulla', 'Nicholas I Simon', 'Yanfei Gao', 'Changmeng Cai', 'Hongmei Yang', 'Xiaoping Zhang', 'Jihong Liu', 'Steven P Balk', 'Shaoyong Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Regulation and targeting of androgen receptor nuclear localization in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor phosphorylation and activity are regulated by an association with protein phosphatase 1.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'AR-v7 protein expression is regulated by protein kinase and phosphatase.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The crosstalk between ubiquitination and endocrine therapy.', 'Tautomycin and enzalutamide combination yields synergistic effects on castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variant 7 functions independently of the full length receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation and targeting of androgen receptor nuclear localization in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Posttranslational regulation of androgen dependent and independent androgen receptor activities in prostate cancer.']"""

In this work, we investigated the expression of miR-150 in prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) and explored its regulation over p27 in the development of CSCs.  Materials and methods:   MiR-150 expression in CD144 or CD44 positive primary prostate cells and in DU145 cell line was measured. It regulation over CSCs was measured using tumor sphere assay and qRT-PCR analysis of CSC related Oct4, Nestin and Nanog genes. The direct binding between miR-150 and 3'UTR of p27 mRNA was verified using dual luciferase, qRT-PCR and western blot assay. The influence of miR-150-p27 axis on prostate CSC properties was further investigated.  Results:   Findings of this study found miR-150 expression was significantly upregulated in CD44+ or CD133+ subgroups of prostate cancer cells. MiR-150 could directly target 3'UTR of p27 and decrease its expression, through which it increased the number and volume of tumor sphere formed by DU145 cells, as well as the expression of CSC related Oct4, Nestin and Nanog genes.

It deacetylates a wide range of histone and nonhistone proteins; hence, it has good therapeutic importance. SIRT1 was believed to be overexpressed in many cancers (prostate, colon) and inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis). Hence, designing inhibitors against SIRT1 could be considered valuable. Both structure-based and ligand-based drug design strategies were employed to design novel inhibitors utilizing high-throughput virtual screening of chemical databases. An energy-based pharmacophore was generated using the crystal structure of SIRT1 bound with a small molecule inhibitor and compared with a ligand-based pharmacophore model that showed four similar features. A three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model was developed and validated to be employed in the virtual screening protocol. Among the designed compounds, Lead 17 emerged as a promising SIRT1 inhibitor with IC50 of 4.34 μM and, at nanomolar concentration (360 nM), attenuated the proliferation of prostate cancer cells (LnCAP). In addition, Lead 17 significantly reduced production of reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing pro inflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and TNF-α. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory potential of the compound was ascertained using an animal paw inflammation model induced by carrageenan. Thus, the identified SIRT1 inhibitors could be considered as potent leads to treat both cancer and inflammation.""","""['Venkat Koushik Pulla', 'Dinavahi Saketh Sriram', 'Srikant Viswanadha', 'Dharmarajan Sriram', 'Perumal Yogeeswari']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Chem Inf Model""","""['Novel tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors from small molecule library screening for their therapeutic activity profiles against rheumatoid arthritis using target-driven approaches and binary QSAR models.', 'Identification and characterization of novel indole based small molecules as anticancer agents through SIRT1 inhibition.', '3D QSAR pharmacophore based virtual screening and molecular docking for identification of potential HSP90 inhibitors.', 'Application of QSAR and shape pharmacophore modeling approaches for targeted chemical library design.', 'How much successful are the medicinal chemists in modulation of SIRT1: A critical review.', ""Virtual Screening in the Identification of Sirtuins' Activity Modulators."", 'Correlations between SIRT1 gene polymorphisms and diabetic kidney disease.', 'Reverse Screening Methods to Search for the Protein Targets of Chemopreventive Compounds.', 'Identification of Bichalcones as Sirtuin Inhibitors by Virtual Screening and In Vitro Testing.']"""

Methods:   This historical cohort study was conducted in two hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients who were diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer and prescribed androgen deprivation therapy between January 2006 and December 2011 were included. Details of skeletal-related events and mortality were examined.  Results:   The median follow-up was 28 (range, 1-97) months. Of 119 patients, 52 (43.7%) developed skeletal-related events throughout the study, and the majority received bone irradiation for pain control. The median actuarial overall survival and cancer-specific survival for patients with skeletal-related events were significantly shorter than those without skeletal-related events (23 vs 48 months, P=0.003 and 26 vs 97 months, P<0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that the adjusted hazard ratio of presence of skeletal-related events on overall and cancer-specific survival was 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-5.10; P=0.002) and 3.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.87-8.23; P<0.001), respectively.

The major cause of mortality can be attributed to metastasis. Cancer metastasis involves sequential and interrelated events. miRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are implicated in this process. miR-195 is downregulated in many human cancers. However, the roles of miR-195 in PCa metastasis and EMT remain unclear. In this study, data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prostate cancer database were re-analysed to detect miR-195 expression and its roles in PCa. miR-195 was then overexpressed in castration-resistant PCa cell lines, DU-145 and PC-3. The role of miR-195 in migration and invasion in vitro was also investigated, and common markers in EMT were evaluated through Western blot analysis. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the target gene of miR-195; were validated in PCa cells. In MSKCC data re-analyses, miR-195 was poorly expressed in metastatic PCa; miR-195 could be used to diagnose metastatic PCa by measuring the corresponding expression. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was 0.705 (P = 0.017). Low miR-195 expression was characterised with a shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) time. miR-195 overexpression suppressed cell migration, invasion and EMT. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) was confirmed as a direct target of miR-195. FGF2 knockdown also suppressed migration, invasion and EMT; by contrast, increased FGF2 partially reversed the suppressive effect of miR-195. And data from ONCOMINE prostate cancer database showed that PCa patients with high FGF2 expression showed shorter RFS time (P = 0.046). Overall, this study demonstrated that miR-195 suppressed PCa cell metastasis by downregulating FGF2. miR-195 restoration may be considered as a new therapeutic method to treat metastatic PCa.""","""['Chunhui Liu', 'Han Guan', 'Yiduo Wang', 'Ming Chen', 'Bin Xu', 'Lei Zhang', 'Kai Lu', 'Tao Tao', 'Xiaowen Zhang', 'Yeqing Huang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['MiR-573 inhibits prostate cancer metastasis by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'microRNA-802 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition through targeting flotillin-2 in human prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Stromal-induced downregulation of miR-1247 promotes prostate cancer malignancy.', 'LRSAM1 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Promotes Choriocarcinoma Progression and Metastasis via p53/p21 Signaling Impediment.', 'Efficacy of green tea extract on PC3 prostate cancer cells through upregulation of miR-195 expression and suppression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'miR-195 Inhibits Proliferation and Enhances Apoptosis of OSCC Cells via Targeting TLR4.', 'hsa-miR-195-5p inhibits cell proliferation of human thyroid carcinoma cells via modulation of p21/cyclin D1 axis.', 'Inhibin subunit beta A promotes cell proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.']"""

Results from a randomized trial on the impacts of acquiring Medicaid coverage""","""Background:   The Oregon Medicaid lottery provided a unique opportunity to assess the causal impacts of health insurance on cancer screening rates within the framework of a randomized controlled trial. Prior studies regarding the impacts of health insurance have almost always been limited to observational evidence, which cannot be used to make causal inferences.  Methods:   The authors prospectively followed a representative panel of 16,204 individuals from the Oregon Medicaid lottery reservation list, collecting data before and after the Medicaid lottery drawings. The study panel was divided into 2 groups: a treatment group of individuals who were selected in the Medicaid lottery (6254 individuals) and a control group who were not (9950 individuals). The authors also created an elevated risk subpanel based on family cancer histories. One year after the lottery drawings, differences in cancer screening rates, preventive behaviors, and health status were compared between the study groups.  Results:   Medicaid coverage resulted in significantly higher rates of several common cancer screenings, especially among women, as well as better primary care connections and self-reported health outcomes. There was little evidence found that acquiring Medicaid increased the adoption of preventive health behaviors that might reduce cancer risk.  Conclusions:   Medicaid coverage did not appear to directly impact lifestyle choices that might reduce cancer risk, but it did provide access to important care and screenings that could help to detect cancers earlier. These findings could have long-term population health implications for states considering or pursuing Medicaid expansion.

Our data demonstrate that TM4SF3 exhibits androgen-induced repression of the mRNA but up-regulation of the protein. The androgen positive effect on the TM4SF3 protein is of significant interest in view of the procancer functions of both androgens and tetraspanin proteins. Androgen positively regulates TM4SF3 protein stability by inhibiting its proteasome-dependent degradation. This androgen stabilization of TM4SF3 is involved in promoting PCa cell invasion and migration of both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa cells. Although confirming androgen up-regulation of the TM4SF3 protein, we observed that TM4SF3 is localized not only to the membrane, but also, surprisingly, the nuclei of PCa cells. This novel nuclear localization of TM4SF3 depends on androgen-induced nuclear localization of androgen receptor (AR) in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa cell lines. TM4SF3 interacts with AR both in PCa cell types and in vitro, strongly suggesting a direct interaction. This direct interaction is required for the stabilization of not only TM4SF3, but also remarkably AR, because down-regulation of TM4SF3 resulted in reduced AR protein levels. As expected of an important AR regulator, TM4SF3 regulates androgen-dependent gene expression in and proliferation of PCa cells. Importantly, a direct correlation between AR and TM4SF3 protein levels and nuclear colocalization were also observed in prostate tumors, strongly suggesting that the mutual stabilization resulting from the AR-TM4SF3 interaction is found in tumors and that this interaction is important in PCa biology.""","""['Meenakshi Bhansali', 'Jun Zhou', 'Lirim Shemshedini']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['The Transmembrane Protein TM4SF3 Interacts With AR and AR-V7 and is Recruited to AR Target Genes.', 'Estrogen induces androgen-repressed SOX4 expression to promote progression of prostate cancer cells.', 'The tumor suppressor ING1b is a novel corepressor for the androgen receptor and induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Degradation and beyond: control of androgen receptor activity by the proteasome system.', 'Tspan8-β-catenin positive feedback loop promotes melanoma invasion.', 'Peptide B targets soluble guanylyl cyclase α1 and kills prostate cancer cells.', 'The cancer-associated cell migration protein TSPAN1 is under control of androgens and its upregulation increases prostate cancer cell migration.', 'Non-canonical functions of claudin proteins: Beyond the regulation of cell-cell adhesions.']"""

We therefore conducted a case-control study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to assess the effect of adrenergic blockers on the incidence of prostate, lung, bowel and breast cancers. From among patients aged 18 years or older who contributed at least 2 years of prospectively gathered data between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 2012, we selected incident cases of relevant cancers and controls, frequency matched 10 : 1 by age.

A total of 18 968 colorectal, 19 082 lung, 21 608 prostate and 29 109 breast cancers were identified. We found no evidence of a protective effect of adrenergic blockade in lung and prostate cancers and found a slightly increased risk for colorectal and breast cancers in users.

Currently available therapies for metastatic PCa are only marginally effective, hence novel treatment modalities are urgently required. Considerable evidence(s) suggest that deregulated activation of oncogenic transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of PCa. Thus, agents that can abrogate STAT3 activation could form the basis of novel therapy for PCa patients. In the present study, we analyzed whether the potential anticancer effects of nimbolide (NL), a limonoid triterpene derived from Azadirachta indica, against PCa cell lines and transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model are mediated through the negative regulation of STAT3 pathway.  Results:   Data from the in vitro studies indicated that NL could significantly inhibit cell viability, induce apoptosis, and suppress cellular invasion and migration. Interestingly, NL also abrogated STAT3 activation and this effect was found to be mediated via an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to GSH/GSSG imbalance. Oral administration of NL significantly suppressed the tumor growth and metastasis in TRAMP mouse model without exhibiting any significant adverse effects.  Innovation:   The present study demonstrates the critical role of GSH/GSSG imbalance-mediated ROS production contributing to the STAT3 inhibitory and tumor-suppressive effect of NL in PCa.  Conclusion:   Overall, our findings indicate that NL exhibits significant anticancer effects in PCa that may be primarily mediated through the ROS-regulated inhibition of STAT3 signaling cascade.""","""['Jingwen Zhang', 'Kwang Seok Ahn', 'Chulwon Kim', 'Muthu K Shanmugam', 'Kodappully Sivaraman Siveen', 'Frank Arfuso', 'Ramar Perumal Samym', 'Amudha Deivasigamanim', 'Lina Hsiu Kim Lim', 'Lingzhi Wang', 'Boon Cher Goh', 'Alan Prem Kumar', 'Kam Man Hui', 'Gautam Sethi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Antioxid Redox Signal""","""['Formononetin-induced oxidative stress abrogates the activation of STAT3/5 signaling axis and suppresses the tumor growth in multiple myeloma preclinical model.', 'The STAT3 Inhibitor Galiellalactone Effectively Reduces Tumor Growth and Metastatic Spread in an Orthotopic Xenograft Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 regulates the effects of paclitaxel on Stat3 activation and cellular survival in lung cancer cells.', 'Nimbolide, a Neem Limonoid, Is a Promising Candidate for the Anticancer Drug Arsenal.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 as a therapeutic target for cancer and the tumor microenvironment.', 'The role of oxygen tension in cell fate and regenerative medicine: implications of hypoxia/hyperoxia and free radicals.', 'Ampelopsin targets in cellular processes of cancer: Recent trends and advances.', 'Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.)-Derived Phytochemicals Target Multiple Signaling Pathways to Confer Oncopreventive and Oncotherapeutic Effects.', 'Special Issue ""Role of STAT3 in Oncogenesis"".', 'Unraveling the Potential Role of NEDD4-like E3 Ligases in Cancer.']"""

Current diagnosis of canine UC and PC requires histopathological examination of a biopsy. Such specimens require specialized medical equipment and are invasive procedures, limiting the availability of diagnosis by histopathology for many canine patients. Access to a non-invasive means to confirm diagnosis is currently an unmet need. Recently, the canine BRAF V595E mutation was detected in ~80% of canine UCs and PCs. In this study, we developed a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay for detection of the canine BRAF V595E mutation in canine urogenital tumors. The assay was evaluated in DNA samples prepared from biopsy specimens of UC (n = 48) and PC (n = 27), as well and non-neoplastic bladder epithelium (n = 38). In addition the assay was assessed for use with DNA isolated from free catch urine samples derived from canine patients with UC (n = 23), PC (n = 3), as well as from dogs with cystitis and healthy controls (n = 37). In all cases the sensitivity to detect the mutant allele was compared with conventional Sanger sequencing. ddPCR had superior sensitivity for detection of the V595E mutation: 75% of UC, 85% of PC, and 0% of control samples were mutation positive, respectively, and the V595E mutation was detected at a level as low as just 1 in 10,000 alleles (~0.01%). Furthermore, the ddPCR assay identified the mutation in free catch urine samples from 83% of canine UC and PC patients, demonstrating its utility as a non-invasive means of diagnosis.

Methods:   Between August 1, 2009, and March 31, 2013, 380 patients underwent RARP. Of these, 25 patients had undergone surgery for primary bladder outlet obstruction (TURP, 20 patients; OP, 5 patents) (group 1). A match-paired analysis was performed to identify 36 patients without a history of prostate surgery with equivalent clinicopathologic characteristics to serve as a control group (group 2). Patients followed up for 12 months were assessed.  Results:   Both groups were similar with respect to preoperative characteristics, as mean age, body mass index, median prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, clinical stage, the biopsy Gleason score, D'Amico risk, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification score, the International Prostate Symptom Score, continence, and potency status. RARP resulted in longer console and anastomotic time, as well as higher blood loss compared with surgery-naive patients. We noted a greater rate of urinary leakage (pelvic drainage, >4 d) in group 1 (12% vs 2,8%). The anastomotic stricture rate was significantly higher in group 1 (16% vs 2.8%).

During tumor progression, epithelial cells decrease the number of adhesion molecules, change their polarity and position, rearrange their cytoskeleton and increase their migratory and invasive capacities. These changes are known under the concept of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is characterized by an upregulation of certain transcription factors, including SNAIL1, which represses genes that are characteristic of an epithelial phenotype, including E‑cadherin, and indirectly increase the expression levels of genes, which are associated with the mesenchymal phenotype. It has been suggested that the transcription factor, SNAIL1, decreases the proliferation and increases the migratory and invasive capacities of PCa cell lines. The present study was performed using LNCaP and PC3 cell lines, in which the expression levels of SNAIL1 were increased or silenced through the use of lentiviral vectors. The expression levels of EMT markers were quantified using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. In addition, cell survival was analyzed using an MTS assay; cell proliferation was examined using an antibody targeting Ki‑67; migration on plates with 8 µm pores to allow the passage of cells; and invasiveness was analyzed using a membrane chamber covered in dried basement membrane matrix solution. The levels of apoptosis were determined using a Caspase 3/7 assay containing a substrate modified by caspases 3 and 7. The results demonstrated that the overexpression and silencing of SNAIL1 decreased cell proliferation and survival. However, the overexpression of SNAIL1 decreased apoptosis, compared with cells with the SNAIL1‑silenced cells, in which cell apoptosis increased. The migration and invasive capacities increased in the cells overexpressing SNAIL1, and decreased when SNAIL1 was silenced. In conclusion, PCa cells overexpressing SNAIL1 exhibited characteristics of an EMT phenotype, whereas the silencing of the SNAIL1 transcriptional repressor promoted an epithelial‑like phenotype, with decreased migration and invasion, characteristic of mesenchymal cells.""","""['Luis A Osorio', 'Nancy M Farfán', 'Enrique A Castellón', 'Héctor R Contreras']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Over-expression of lipocalin 2 promotes cell migration and invasion through activating ERK signaling to increase SLUG expression in prostate cancer.', 'TRPM4 channel is involved in regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Sex-determining region Y-box protein 3 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in osteosarcoma cells via transcriptional activation of Snail1.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'Central role of Snail1 in the regulation of EMT and resistance in cancer: a target for therapeutic intervention.', 'Cancer Stem Cells and Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Targeting tumor-intrinsic PD-L1 suppresses the progression and aggressiveness of head and neck cancer by inhibiting GSK3β-dependent Snail degradation.', 'A novel epithelial-mesenchymal transition gene signature for the immune status and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Overexpression of N-cadherin increased the efficiency of colony and tumor spheroid formation and the stemness factor expression (including c-Myc, Klf4, Sox2 and Oct4), and vice versa. Furthermore, microarray analysis and western blot analysis mechanistically proved that N-cadherin activated ErbB signaling pathway by upregulating the expression of Grb2, pShc and pERK1/2. Importantly, the regulation of N-cadherin on EMT and stemness was counteracted by lapatinib, a specific ErbB signaling pathway inhibitor.

Even though the regulatory role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the control of tumor metastases has been well described in numerous types of cancer, the importance in bone metastasis of PCa remains largely unknown. In the present study, the differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between the primary PCa and bone metastatic PCa samples by comparing their expression profiling using miRNA microarray, and 4 miRNAs (miR‑335, ‑543, ‑196 and ‑19a) were noted to be significantly downregulated in bone metastasis compared with primary PCa. Among those, the downregulation of 2 miRNAs (miR‑335 and ‑543) was confirmed in a total of 20 paired primary PCa and bone metastasis samples using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Using the online target prediction tool, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was found to be a shared target of miR‑335 and ‑543, which was further verified using the luciferase assay. By examining the expression pattern of eNOS in primary PCa and skeletal metastatic samples, the mRNA and protein expression levels of eNOS were markedly upregulated in the metastatic samples. Furthermore, exogenous overexpression of miR‑335 and ‑543 significantly downregulated the expression level of eNOS, and substantially compromised the ability of migration and invasion in vitro.

Sodium orthovanadate (SOV) is a vanadium compound, and exhibited antineoplastic activity in certain types of human cancer cells, including lung, kidney and prostate cancer cells.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of SOV on the apoptosis of NB cells and to explore how PIWIL2 is involved in the mechanism underlying this effect. In the present study, SH‑SY5Y cells were treated with SOV and the optimal concentration was determined for further assays. Cell apoptosis, cell count, viability, the cell cycle, and the expression of PIWIL2 mRNA and protein were then determined. The results showed that SOV could induce cell apoptosis, reduce the percentage of viable cells, induce accumulation of SH‑SY5Y cells at the G2/M and S phase of the cell cycle, and inhibit the expression of PIWIL2 and Bcl‑2 mRNA and protein. The results suggested that the underlying mechanisms may be, at least in part, due to SOV inhibiting the expression of PIWIL2.

Recent findings have revealed that hormone stimulation of certain nuclear receptors induces rapid, dynamic changes in DNA methylation patterns alongside transcriptional responses at a subset of target loci, over time. However, the ability of androgen receptor (AR) to dynamically regulate gene transcription is relatively under-studied and its role in the regulation of DNA methylation patterns remains to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate in normal prostate cells that hormone stimulated AR activity results in dynamic changes in the transcription rate and DNA methylation patterns at the AR target genes, TIPARP and SGK1. Time-resolved chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments on the SGK1 locus reveals dynamic recruitment of AR and RNA Polymerase II, as well as the recruitment of proteins involved in the DNA demethylation process, TET1 and TDG. Furthermore, the presence of DNA methylation at dynamic regions inhibits protein binding and transcriptional activity of SGK1. These findings establish AR activity as a contributing factor to the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation patterns at target genes in prostate biology and infer further complexity involved in nuclear receptor mediation of transcriptional regulation.""","""['Vineet K Dhiman', 'Kristopher Attwood', 'Moray J Campbell', 'Dominic J Smiraglia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Transcriptional regulation of RKIP expression by androgen in prostate cells.', 'Coregulator recruitment and histone modifications in transcriptional regulation by the androgen receptor.', 'The corepressors silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor and nuclear receptor corepressor are involved in agonist- and antagonist-regulated transcription by androgen receptor.', 'Dynamic regulation of the angiotensinogen gene by DNA methylation, which is influenced by various stimuli experienced in daily life.', 'Functions of DNA methylation: islands, start sites, gene bodies and beyond.', 'Differential Expression of Steroid Hormone Receptors and Ten Eleven Translocation Proteins in Endometrial Cancer Cells.', 'Tracing TET1 expression in prostate cancer: discovery of malignant cells with a distinct oncogenic signature.', 'The role of TET proteins in stress-induced neuroepigenetic and behavioural adaptations.', 'Dynamic patterns of DNA methylation in the normal prostate epithelial differentiation program are targets of aberrant methylation in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen-induced epigenetic modulations in the ovary.']"""

This is the first study to address whether β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2)- mediated signaling may affect CRPC progression in vivo. By immunohistochemical analyses, we observed that low levels of ADRB2 is associated with a more rapid development of CRPC in a Norwegian patient cohort. To elucidate mechanisms by which ADRB2 may affect CRPC development, we stably transfected LNCaP cells with shRNAs to mimic low and high expression of ADRB2. Two UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, involved in phase II metabolism of androgens, were strongly downregulated in two LNCaP shADRB2 cell lines. The low-ADRB2 LNCaP cell lines displayed lowered glucuronidation activities towards androgens than high-ADRB2 cells. Furthermore, increased levels of testosterone and enhanced androgen responsiveness were observed in LNCaP cells expressing low level of ADRB2. Interestingly, these cells grew faster than high-ADRB2 LNCaP cells, and sustained their low glucuronidation activity in castrated NOD/SCID mice. ADRB2 immunohistochemical staining intensity correlated with UGT2B15 staining intensity in independent TMA studies and with UGT2B17 in one TMA study. Similar to ADRB2, we show that low levels of UGT2B15 are associated with a more rapid CRPC progression.

Concerns about overscreening and overdiagnosis subsequently led professional guidelines (circa 2000 and later) to recommend against routine PSA testing. We evaluated trends in prostate cancer incidence, including late-stage diagnoses, from 1995 through 2012.  Methods:   We used joinpoint regression analyses to evaluate all-, localized/regional-, and distant-stage prostate cancer incidence trends based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. We stratified analyses by age (50-69, 70+). We reported incidence trends as annual percent change (APC).  Results:   Overall age-adjusted incidence rates for localized/regional stage prostate cancer have been declining since 2001, sharply from 2010 to 2012 [APC, -13.1; 95% confidence intervals (CI), -23.5 to -1.3]. Distant-stage incidence rates have declined since 1995, with greater declines from 1995 to 1997 (APC, -8.4; 95% CI, -2.3 to -14.1) than from 2003 to 2012 (APC, -1.0; 95% CI, -1.7 to -0.4). Distant-stage incidence rates declined for men ages 70+ from 1995 to 2012, but increased in men ages 50 to 69 years from 2004 to 2012 (APC, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.2 to 3.2).

Tumor penetrating peptide RPARPAR (receptor: NRP-1) and tumor homing peptide GKRK (receptor: p32) were used as affinity ligands on the AgNPs. The binding and uptake of the peptide-functionalized AgNPs by cultured PPC-1 prostate cancer and M21 melanoma cells was dependent on the cell surface expression of the cognate peptide receptors. Barcoded peptide-functionalized AgNPs were synthesized from silver and palladium isotopes. The cells were incubated with a cocktail of the barcoded nanoparticles [RPARPAR (R), GKRK (K), and control], and cellular binding and internalization of each type of nanoparticle was assessed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.

This study aimed to examine changes in survival between the pretargeted and targeted therapy periods in advanced RCC patients in a real-world setting. Utilizing the 2000-2010 SEER Research files, a pre-post study design with a contemporaneous comparison group was employed to examine differences in survival outcomes for patients diagnosed with advanced RCC (study group) or advanced prostate cancer (comparison group, for whom no significant treatment innovations happened during this period) across the pretargeted therapy era (2000-2005) and the targeted therapy era (2006-2010). RCC patients diagnosed in the targeted therapy era (N = 6439) showed improved survival compared to those diagnosed in the pretargeted therapy era (N = 7231, hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause death: 0.86, P < 0.01), while the change between the pre-post periods was not significant for advanced prostate cancer patients (HR: 0.97, P = 0.08). Advanced RCC patients had significantly larger improvements in overall survival compared to advanced prostate cancer patients (z = 4.31; P < 0.01). More detailed year-to-year analysis revealed greater survival improvements for RCC in the later years of the posttargeted period. Similar results were seen for cause-specific survival. Subgroup analyses by nephrectomy status, age, and gender showed consistent findings. Patients diagnosed with advanced RCC during the targeted therapy era had better survival outcomes than those diagnosed during the pretargeted therapy era.

The effects of AX2 on mTOR, PTEN, PI3K, and Akt at the protein level and mRNA were determined by western blotting and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), respectively. Concurrently, the effects of AX2 on expression levels of MiRNA144 and MiRNA126 in PC-3 were measured by real-time RT-PCR. The association of MiRNA144 with 3'-UTR of mTOR was identified using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Gene System. The direct effect of MIRNA144 on the mTOR/PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway was determined by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting. Apoptosis of PC-3 cells induced by AX2 was determined by MTT and flow cytometry. The results indicated that mTOR/PTEN/PI3K/Akt were decreased and PTEN was increased by AX (1, 10 µmol/l) at protein and mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. MiRNA144 was decreased, whereas MiRNA126 was increased by AX2. MiRNA144 associated with 3'-UTR of mTOR was corroborated. Overexpression of MiRNA144 decreased mTOR, but did not affect PTEN, PI3K, or Akt. The proliferation rates of AX2 on PC-3 cells were decreased. It suggests that AX2 induces apoptosis of PC-3 cells via meddling in the mTOR/PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, but those effects are compounded by MiRNA144.

Cabazitaxel is a second-line taxane chemotherapeutic agent that provides additional survival benefits to patients with advanced disease. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanism of action of combined cabazitaxel and androgen receptor (AR) targeting in preclinical models of advanced prostate cancer. We found that cabazitaxel induced mitotic spindle collapse and multinucleation by targeting the microtubule depolymerizing kinesins and inhibiting AR. In androgen-responsive tumors, treatment with the AR inhibitor, enzalutamide, overcame resistance to cabazitaxel. Combination treatment of human CRPC xenografts with cabazitaxel and enzalutamide reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and led to multinucleation, while retaining nuclear AR. In a transgenic mouse model of androgen-responsive prostate cancer, cabazitaxel treatment induced MET, glandular redifferentiation, and AR nuclear localization that was inhibited by androgen deprivation. Collectively, our preclinical studies demonstrate that prostate tumor resistance to cabazitaxel can be overcome by antiandrogen-mediated EMT-MET cycling in androgen-sensitive tumors but not in CRPC. Moreover, AR splice variants may preclude patients with advanced disease from responding to cabazitaxel chemotherapy and antiandrogen combination therapy. This evidence enables a significant insight into therapeutic cross-resistance to taxane chemotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Sarah K Martin', 'Hong Pu', 'Justin C Penticuff', 'Zheng Cao', 'Craig Horbinski', 'Natasha Kyprianou']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgens modify therapeutic response to cabazitaxel in models of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the Androgen Receptor Confers In Vivo Cross-resistance Between Enzalutamide and Docetaxel, But Not Cabazitaxel, in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Continued androgen signalling inhibition improves cabazitaxel efficacy in prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of resistance to systemic therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Molecular mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Apalutamide, Darolutamide and Enzalutamide for Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (nmCRPC): A Critical Review.', 'Impact of Circadian Rhythms on the Development and Clinical Management of Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Integrated Therapeutic Targeting of the Prostate Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

The rational design pursued focused on five analogues of a clinically established antiangiogenic compound (sunitinib), from which a lead candidate (SAN1) was conjugated to the targeting peptide [d-Lys(6)]-GnRH, generating SAN1GSC. Conjugation of SAN1 did not disrupt any of its antiangiogenic or cytotoxic properties in GnRH-R-expressing prostate and breast tumor cells. Daily SAN1GSC treatments in mouse xenograft models of castration-resistant prostate cancer resulted in significant tumor growth delay compared with equimolar SAN1 or sunitinib alone. This efficacy correlated with inhibited phosphorylation of AKT and S6, together with reduced Ki-67 and CD31 expression. The superior efficacy of the peptide-drug conjugate was also attributed to the finding that higher amounts of SAN1 were delivered to the tumor site (∼4-fold) following dosing of SAN1GSC compared with equimolar amounts of nonconjugated SAN1. Importantly, treatment with SAN1GSC was associated with minimal hematotoxicity and cardiotoxicity based on measurements of the left ventricular systolic function in treated mice.

Here, we reported the mode of mechanism underlying MA1-mediated cytotoxicity through induction of apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy in prostate cancer (PCa) cells.  Methods:   Human PCa cells PC3 and LNCaP were treated with MA1, and cell viability, apoptosis, necrosis, mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress and autophagy were analyzed, respectively. Pharmacological inhibitors, transient transfection of plasmids and siRNAs were then used to identify the roles of oxidative stress and autophagy in MA1-triggered cell death.  Results:   In both PC3 and LNCaP cells, MA1 inhibited cell proliferation and triggered oxidative stress via the rapid accumulation of reactive oxygen species and a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Mitochondrial damage by MA1 triggered caspase activation and intracellular ATP deletion, leading to apoptosis and necrosis, respectively. Meanwhile, MA1 activated autophagy as indicated by conversion of LC3BI to LC3BII and increased GFP-tagged LC3B punctate dots. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy or knocking down LC3B attenuated MA1-mediated cell death. Excessive oxidative stress and decreased ATP stimulated AMPK/mTOR pathway, which led to induction of MA1-mediated autophagy.  Conclusions:   Coaction of apoptotic, necrotic and autophagic cell death induced by mitochondrial damage defines a novel mechanism contributing to the growth suppression of MA1 in prostate cancer cells, and activation of autophagy might be a potential strategy for improving its chemotherapeutic effects.""","""['Yongqing Liu', 'Ming Wang', 'Dawei Wang', 'Xiaobin Li', 'Wei Wang', 'Hongxiang Lou', 'Huiqing Yuan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['4-Nonylphenol induces apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis in Sertoli cells: Involvement of ROS-mediated AMPK/AKT-mTOR and JNK pathways.', 'Sodium meta-arsenite induces reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy in both androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor alleviated 6-OHDA-induced cell damage via ROS-AMPK/mTOR mediated autophagic inhibition.', 'Reactive oxygen species regulation of autophagy in cancer: implications for cancer treatment.', 'Reactive oxygen species and autophagy modulation in non-marine drugs and marine drugs.', ""AMPK's double-faced role in advanced stages of prostate cancer."", 'Preclinical Development of Seriniquinones as Selective Dermcidin Modulators for the Treatment of Melanoma.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Malformin-A1 (MA1) Sensitizes Chemoresistant Ovarian Cancer Cells to Cisplatin-Induced Apoptosis.', 'Natural Cyclopeptides as Anticancer Agents in the Last 20 Years.']"""

Radiotherapy remains the gold-standard treatment; however, laboratory and clinical work suggest that pregabalin may be useful in treating CIBP. The aim of this study was to examine pregabalin in patients with CIBP receiving radiotherapy.  Patients and methods:   A multicenter, double-blind randomized trial of pregabalin versus placebo was conducted. Eligible patients were age ≥ 18 years, had radiologically proven bone metastases, were scheduled to receive radiotherapy, and had pain scores ≥ 4 of 10 (on 0-to-10 numeric rating scale). Before radiotherapy, baseline assessments were completed, followed by random assignment. Doses of pregabalin and placebo were increased over 4 weeks. The primary end point was treatment response, defined as a reduction of ≥ 2 points in worst pain by week 4, accompanied by a stable or reduced opioid dose, compared with baseline. Secondary end points assessed average pain, interference of pain with activity, breakthrough pain, mood, quality of life, and adverse events.  Results:   A total of 233 patients were randomly assigned: 117 to placebo and 116 to pregabalin. The most common cancers were prostate (n = 88; 38%), breast (n = 77; 33%), and lung (n = 42; 18%). In the pregabalin arm, 45 patients (38.8%) achieved the primary end point, compared with 47 (40.2%) in the placebo arm (adjusted odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.81; P = .816). There were no statistically significant differences in average pain, pain interference, or quality of life between arms. There were differences in mood (P = .031) and breakthrough pain duration (P = .037) between arms. Outcomes were compared at 4 weeks.

Methods:   As part of a two-round quality improvement study, breast and prostate cancer patients and their medical and radiation oncology clinicians completed semi-structured interviews about their use of PatientViewpoint. The patient interview addressed different phases of the PRO completion workflow: reminders, completing the survey, and viewing the results. The clinician interviews asked about use of PatientViewpoint, integration with the clinical workflow, barriers to use, and helpful and desired features. Responses were recorded, categorized, and reviewed. After both rounds of interviews, modifications were made to PatientViewpoint.  Results:   Across the two rounds, 42 unique patients (n = 19 in round 1, n = 23 in round 2) and 12 clinicians (all in both rounds) completed interviews. For patients, median age was 65, 81 % were white, 69 % were college graduates, 80 % had performance status of 0, 69 % had loco-regional disease, and 81 % were regular computer users. In the quality improvement interviews, patients identified numerous strengths of the system, including its ability to flag issues for discussion with their provider. Comments included confusion about how scores were presented and that the value of the system was diminished if the doctor did not look at the results. Requests included tailoring questions to be applicable to the individual and providing more explanation about the score meaning, including having higher scores consistently indicating either better or worse status. Clinicians also provided primarily positive feedback about the system, finding it helpful in some cases, and confirmatory in others. Their primary concern was with impact on their workflow.  Conclusions:   Systematically collected feedback from patients and clinicians was useful to identify ways to improve a system to incorporate PRO measures into oncology practice.

However, the proteins histone deacetylase 6 interacts with, and thus its role in cancer cells, remains poorly characterized. Histone deacetylase 6 deacetylase activity has recently been shown to be required for efficient basal autophagic flux. Autophagy is often dysregulated in cancer cells and may confer stress resistance and allow for cell maintenance and a high proliferation rate. Tubacin may therefore slow cancer cell proliferation by decreasing autophagic flux.

Exosomes are small membranous vesicles of 50-150 nm in diameter, which are secreted into the extracellular space and supposedly serve as vehicles for signal and effector molecules to modulate adjacent target cells. We characterized the mRNA and protein composition as well as cellular functions of prostate cancer cell-derived exosomes.  Methods:   Exosomes were prepared from prostate cancer cell culture supernatant by ultracentrifugation and subsequently characterized by dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. Exosomal mRNA and protein composition were analyzed by DNA microarrays and gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. Physiological effects of exosomes were studied by means of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase release cell assays. Using a SILAC approach, putative uptake of exosomal human proteins in canine cells and canine de novo synthesis of proteins specified by exosome-transferred human mRNA was analyzed in MDCK cells via mass spectrometry.  Results:   Preparations of exosomes revealed typical cup shaped particles of 150 nm in diameter. Analysis of mRNA and protein composition of exosomes exhibited a wide range of mRNA and protein species. Interestingly, the packaging of at least small proteins into exosomes was apparently unspecific, as shown with the example of two model proteins. In cell culture incubation experiments exosomal preparations of prostate cancer cells caused anti-proliferative effects. MS analysis revealed the uptake of exosomal human proteins into canine cells after 6 hr of incubation.

Since IDC-P, unlike PIN, was strongly correlated with aggressive prostate cancer, differentiation of these is too necessary. So we evaluated immunohistopathological patterns and the prognostic factors of IDC-P and HGPIN, in radical prostatectomy samples.  Methods:   We evaluated 250 radical prostatectomy and detected 210 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma without IDC-P foci, 40 cases with adenocarcinoma concomitant IDC-P, and 40 cases HGPIN; therefore, we evaluated immunohistopathological criteria in these groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS and P-value <0.05 was considered as the statistical significant level.  Results:   PSA level was significantly higher in IDC-P compared with non-IDC-P patients (15.7 ± 3.1 vs. 10.2 ± 4.3, P = 0.041).

However, association studies conducted in Northern and Southern Chinese have provided conflicting results. Therefore, here we performed fine mapping of FOXP4 to identify the association with PCa and the potential application in Chinese men.  Methods:   We examined 11 variants spaced approximately 55 kb apart spanning FOXP4 using high-resolution melting-curve analysis and sequencing methods in 286 PCa patients and 630 controls, and the association between these variants and PCa risk was evaluated. Additionally, we evaluated the cumulative effect of rs4714476 and 2 variants in 8q24 (rs16901966, rs10090154) confirmed in our previous study.  Results:   Of 11 SNPs, only rs4714476-C at the 5' near gene of FOXP4 was associated with increased age-adjusted PCa risk (p = 0.012, OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.06 - 1.63) and aggressive PCa (p = 0.026). The CG haplotype covering rs4714476-C demonstrated significant differences between PCa cases and controls (p = 0.009). The cumulative effect analysis showed men who carried any combination of 1, 2, or 3 risk genotypes had a gradually increased PCa risk (age-adjusted OR is from 1.244 to 3.312).  Conclusions:   These data suggest that rs4714476 at the 5' near gene of FOXP4 potentially contributes to the susceptibility of PCa in Chinese men.

The quality of the performance of Chinese clinical laboratories on tumor markers is partly reflected through analysis of EQA results. This report presents an 8-year EQA result of the six most common tumor markers from 2006 to 2013.  Methods:   Ten freeze-dried EQA samples were distributed to participants every year. Satisfactory performance was defined as scores of more than 80% of acceptable responses with the evaluation criterion of ± 25%. The robust coefficient of variability (CV) between laboratories and percentage difference against the target value of each sample were also calculated by year.  Results:   A total number of 1154 laboratories submitted results in 2013, which was more than threefold of 2006. The proportion of laboratories with satisfactory performance showed an overall rising trend over the years and was up to 95% for the second survey in 2013. The overall decrease of robust CV was observed for all analytes including alpha fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), total prostate specific antigen (t-PSA), cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3), and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) except for CEA, which exhibited a rise followed by a flat trend.

Materials and methods:   F-FCH and F-FDG PET/CT were performed 15±9 days apart on the same PET/CT system and acquisition and reconstruction parameters.

Results:   Of 77 consecutive patients who underwent F-FCH PET/CT scans for suspected prostate cancer recurrence, 10 (13%) were suspected to have a second malignancy because of F-FCH PET pattern inconsistency with that of prostate cancer (n=6), because of a history of a second malignancy with similar metastatic patterns (n=2) or inconsistency between disease burden and prostate-specific antigen value (n=2). Seventy lesions were studied, with a final diagnosis of prostate cancer, other cancers and benign disease in 55, nine and six lesions, respectively. F-FCH SUVmean and F-FCH/F-FDG SUVmean ratios were significantly different between prostate cancer, nonprostate cancer and benign disease (P<0.0001 and P=0.04, respectively). Receiving operating characteristic analysis showed that the F-FCH/F-FDG ratios were not better than F-FCH SUVmean in discriminating prostate cancer from nonprostate cancer and benign diseases (sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve were 69%, 80%, 0.71 and 84%, 80% and 0.89, respectively).

Many tumor cells have suppressed expression of a key enzyme, argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), which converts citrulline to arginine. These tumor cells become arginine auxotrophic, as they can no longer synthesize endogenous arginine intracellularly from citrulline, and are therefore sensitive to arginine depletion therapy. However, since ADI-PEG20 only depletes extracellular arginine due to low internalization, ASS1-expressing cells are not susceptible to treatment since they can synthesize arginine intracellularly. Recent studies have found that several factors influence ASS1 expression. In this study, we evaluated the effect of hypoxia, frequently encountered in many solid tumors, on ASS1 expression and its relationship to ADI-resistance in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. It was found that MDA-MB-231 cells developed ADI resistance in hypoxic conditions with increased ASS1 expression. To restore ADI sensitivity as well as achieve tumor-selective delivery under hypoxia, we constructed a pH-sensitive cell penetrating peptide (CPP)-based delivery system to carry ADI inside cells to deplete both intra- and extracellular arginine. The delivery system was designed to activate the CPP-mediated internalization only at the mildly acidic pH (6.5-7) associated with the microenvironment of hypoxic tumors, thus achieving better selectivity toward tumor cells. The pH sensitivity of the CPP HBHAc was controlled by recombinant fusion to a histidine-glutamine (HE) oligopeptide, generating HBHAc-HE-ADI. The tumor distribution of HBHAc-HE-ADI was comparable to ADI-PEG20 in a mouse xenograft model of human breast cancer cells in vivo. In addition, HBHAc-HE-ADI showed increased in vitro cellular uptake in cells incubated in a mildly acidic pH (hypoxic conditions) compared to normal pH (normoxic conditions), which correlated with pH-sensitive in vitro cytotoxicity in hypoxic MDA-MB-231 and human prostate cancer PC3 cells. Together, we conclude that the HBHAc-HE-based peptide delivery offers a useful means to overcome hypoxia-induced resistance to ADI in breast cancer cells, and to target the mildly acidic tumor microenvironment.""","""['Tzyy-Harn Yeh', 'Yun-Ru Chen', 'Szu-Ying Chen', 'Wei-Chiang Shen', 'David K Ann', 'Jennica L Zaro', 'Li-Jiuan Shen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Hypoxia-induced nitric oxide production and tumour perfusion is inhibited by pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20).', 'Intracellular delivery of recombinant arginine deiminase (rADI) by heparin-binding hemagglutinin adhesion peptide restores sensitivity in rADI-resistant cancer cells.', 'Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening uncovers a novel inflammatory pathway critical for resistance to arginine-deprivation therapy.', 'Targeted cellular metabolism for cancer chemotherapy with recombinant arginine-degrading enzymes.', 'Bench-to-Bedside Studies of Arginine Deprivation in Cancer.', 'Unlocking the Potential of Arginine Deprivation Therapy: Recent Breakthroughs and Promising Future for Cancer Treatment.', 'Enhancement of anti-tumor activity in melanoma using arginine deiminase fused with 30Kc19α protein.', 'Phase I study of ADI-PEG20 plus low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Development of a Neuroprotective Erythropoietin Modified with a Novel Carrier for the Blood-Brain Barrier.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibition is synthetically lethal with arginine deprivation in pancreatic cancers with low argininosuccinate synthetase 1 expression.']"""

Intuitively, most urologists expect that a more rapid PSA decline in response to ADT would be positively associated with extended survival. Recently, we have reported that prolonged gradual serum PSA decline after ADT is strongly associated with favorable prognosis in PCa patients, however, the mechanism remains unknown. We investigated the role of fibroblasts in serum PSA decline after ADT. We performed in vitro experiments using androgen-sensitive, androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate epithelial cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and RWPE-1 cells), commercially available prostate stromal cells (PrSC), and primary cultures of prostate fibroblasts (pcPrFs). In LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells, PSA production was increased by co-culture with fibroblasts under androgen-deprived conditions. In an in vivo model using LNCaP cells, serum PSA declined rapidly after ADT becoming undetectable within 14 days in mice inoculated with LNCaP cells alone. In contrast, when LNCaP cells were co-inoculated with fibroblasts, serum PSA levels were still high on 14 days post ADT and did not drop to undetectable levels until 21 days post ADT. Tumor volumes and Ki67 labeling indices were not altered between days 14 and 21 post ADT in mice inoculated with LNCaP cells; however, those in mice inoculated with LNCaP cells plus fibroblasts decreased gradually. PSA protein was detected in all tumors on 21 days post ADT by immunohistochemical staining. Microvessel densities were higher on 14 days post ADT for tumors from mice inoculated with LNCaP cells plus fibroblasts as compared with LNCaP cells alone. In summary, co-inoculation of fibroblasts with LNCaP cells prolonged serum PSA decline after ADT and enhanced the efficacy of ADT. Prolonged serum PSA decline may indicate the presence of protective fibroblasts that preserve the AR dependence of PCa cells, improving treatment efficacy.""","""['Takeshi Sasaki', 'Kenichiro Ishii', 'Yoichi Iwamoto', 'Manabu Kato', 'Manabu Miki', 'Hideki Kanda', 'Kiminobu Arima', 'Taizo Shiraishi', 'Yoshiki Sugimura']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Lab Invest""","""['The Importance of Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Nadir after Primary Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Hormone-Naïve Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Prostate fibroblasts enhance androgen receptor splice variant 7 expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Serum prostate specific antigen levels in mice bearing human prostate LNCaP tumors are determined by tumor volume and endocrine and growth factors.', 'Time to prostate-specific antigen nadir independently predicts overall survival in patients who have metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The mechanism of inflammation, expression and function of chemokines and chemokine receptors in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa) remain unclear. The purpose of present study is to detect differential expression and function of chemokines and chemokine receptors (CCRs) in BPH and PCa.  Methods:   BPH-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were co-cultured in Transwell chambers, and human normal prostate (NP) tissues, BPH tissues and PCa tissues were collected. CCR gene-chips were used to analyze and compare the differential expression of CCRs in BPH-1 cells, BPH-1 cells co-cultured with PBMCs, and LNCaP cells. The differential expression of CCRs was detected and validated using real-time PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF). The proliferation of LNCaP cells was also investigated after the knockdown CXCR5.  Results:   RESULTS of gene-chips indicated that there was low or no expression of CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR3 and CXCR5 in BPH-1 cells, whereas the expression of these receptors in BPH-1 cells was increased by PBMCs, and the expression was high in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, real-time PCR and western blotting confirmed the above mentioned results. IF verified no or low expression of CXCR1, CXCR3 and CXCR5 in NP tissues, low or moderate expression in BPH and high expression in PCa. However, CCR10 was not expressed at detectable levels in the three groups. The growth and proliferation of LNCaP cells was markedly inhibited after down-regulation of CXCR5.  Conclusions:   PCa cells expressed high levels of CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR3 and CXCR5. Although BPH cells did not express these factors, their expression was up-regulated when BPH-1 cells were incubated with inflammatory cells. Finally, down-regulation of CXCR5 inhibited the growth and proliferation of LNCaP cells.""","""['Lu Yang', 'Liang Gao', 'Yongji Chen', 'Zhuang Tang', 'Yuchun Zhu', 'Ping Han', 'Xiang Li', 'Qiang Wei']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Med Sci""","""['Proliferation of Prostate Stromal Cell Induced by Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Epithelial Cell Stimulated With Trichomonas vaginalis via Crosstalk With Mast Cell.', 'Clinical and biological significance of CXCR5 expressed by prostate cancer specimens and cell lines.', 'Analysis of the inflammatory network in benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.', 'Prostate stem cells in the development of benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer: emerging role and concepts.', 'Regulative role of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis in the tumor microenvironment.', 'CXCL13 Signaling in the Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

To study the dynamic regulation of the EMT process, we developed novel genetically defined cellular and in vivo model systems from which epithelial, EMT and mesenchymal-like tumor cells with Pten deletion and Kras activation can be isolated. When cultured individually, each population has the capacity to regenerate all three tumor cell populations, indicative of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. Despite harboring the same genetic alterations, mesenchymal-like tumor cells are resistant to PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibitors, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may regulate the EMT process, as well as dictate the heterogeneous responses of cancer cells to therapy. Among differentially expressed epigenetic regulators, the chromatin remodeling protein HMGA2 is significantly upregulated in EMT and mesenchymal-like tumors cells, as well as in human mCRPC. Knockdown of HMGA2, or suppressing HMGA2 expression with the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589, inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity and stemness activities in vitro and markedly reduces tumor growth and metastasis in vivo through successful targeting of EMT and mesenchymal-like tumor cells. Importantly, LBH589 treatment in combination with castration prevents mCRPC development and significantly prolongs survival following castration by enhancing p53 and androgen receptor acetylation and in turn sensitizing castration-resistant mesenchymal-like tumor cells to androgen deprivation therapy. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that cellular plasticity is regulated epigenetically, and that mesenchymal-like tumor cell populations in mCRPC that are resistant to conventional and targeted therapies can be effectively treated with the epigenetic inhibitor LBH589.""","""['M Ruscetti', 'E L Dadashian', 'W Guo', 'B Quach', 'D J Mulholland', 'J W Park', 'L M Tran', 'N Kobayashi', 'D Bianchi-Frias', 'Y Xing', 'P S Nelson', 'H Wu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Validation of histone deacetylase 3 as a therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Suppression of triple-negative breast cancer metastasis by pan-DAC inhibitor panobinostat via inhibition of ZEB family of EMT master regulators.', 'Combinatorial antitumor effect of HDAC and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibition in a Pten defecient model of prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Signaling and Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Emerging Biomarkers and Opportunities for Precision Therapeutics.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition regulators in prostate cancer: Androgens and beyond.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity landscape: principles of design and mechanisms of regulation.', 'SYTL2 promotes metastasis of prostate cancer cells by enhancing FSCN1-mediated pseudopodia formation and invasion.', 'Correlation between the expression of CD24 on circulating tumor cells and prognosis in breast cancer.', 'Emerging roles of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the cellular plasticity of cancer cells.', 'Emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory network links EMT and androgen receptor-dependent resistance in prostate cancer.']"""

Previous studies have described that several T-UCRs show differential expressions in cancers and might be involved in cancer development. We investigated the transcriptional levels of representative 26 T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differently expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and gastric cancer (GC). A quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the downregulation of Uc.158+A expression by a DNA methylation-associated mechanism, which was restored by 5-Aza-dC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) treatment. Bisulfite genomic sequencing using cell lines and tissue samples demonstrated cancer-specific CpG hypermethylation in both GC and PCa. However, Uc.416+A was only overexpressed in GC and we identified an miR-153 binding site in the possible regulatory region of Uc.416+A using online databases. Along with a forced expression or knockdown of miR-153 in MKN-74 GC cells, the transcriptional levels of Uc.416+A were significantly disturbed. A luciferase reporter gene assay supported the direct regulation of Uc.416+A expression by miR-153. Furthermore, Uc.416+A was associated with cell growth through the regulation of IGFBP6 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6) in GC. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology.""","""['K Goto', 'S Ishikawa', 'R Honma', 'K Tanimoto', 'N Sakamoto', 'K Sentani', 'N Oue', 'J Teishima', 'A Matsubara', 'W Yasui']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Role of transcribed ultraconserved regions in gastric cancer and therapeutic perspectives.', 'Expression and function of Uc.160+, a transcribed ultraconserved region, in gastric cancer.', 'Downregulation of microRNA-27b-3p via aberrant DNA methylation contributes to malignant behavior of gastric cancer cells by targeting GSPT1.', 'Correlation between the single-site CpG methylation and expression silencing of the XAF1 gene in human gastric and colon cancers.', 'Transcribed ultraconserved region in human cancers.', 'Transcribed Ultraconserved Regions: New regulators in cancer signaling and potential biomarkers.', 'Role of transcribed ultraconserved regions in gastric cancer and therapeutic perspectives.', 'Transcribed Ultraconserved Regions in Cancer.', 'Noncoding RNA actions through IGFs and IGF binding proteins in cancer.', 'The transcribed ultraconserved region uc.160+ enhances processing and A-to-I editing of the miR-376 cluster: hypermethylation improves glioma prognosis.']"""

Daidzein, one of the soy isoflavones present in soy-based foods, has been shown to exert anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo. We herein investigated the inhibitory effects of S-equol, an isoflavandiol metabolized from daidzein by bacterial flora in the intestines, on the LnCaP, DU145 and PC3 human prostate cancer cell lines. Our results showed that S-equol and R-equol inhibited the growth of all three cell lines. Additional studies revealed that S-equol caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in PC3 cells by downregulating Cyclin B1 and CDK1 and upregulating CDK inhibitors (p21 and p27), as well as inducing apoptosis by upregulating Fas ligand (FasL) and the expression of proapoptotic Bim. Additionally, S-equol increased the expression of FOXO3a, decreased the expression of p-FOXO3a and enhanced the nuclear stability of FOXO3a. S-equol also decreased the expression of MDM2, which serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p-FOXO3a, thus preventing p-FOXO3a degradation by the proteasome. Mechanistic studies showed that S-equol targeted the Akt/FOXO3a pathway, which is important for prostate cancer cell survival, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with S-equol inhibited the growth of PC3 xenograft tumors in BALB/c nude mice. Overall, the data from the present study demonstrate that S-equol has significant anti-prostate cancer activities in vitro and in vivo, and indicate that its anticancer effects were likely associated with the activation of FOXO3a via an Akt-specific pathway and inhibitory effects on MDM2 expression. The results not only provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this unique secondary metabolite of a natural anti-cancer compound, but also provide a basis for the development of daidzein and its analogs as novel anticancer agents.""","""['Zongliang Lu', 'Rui Zhou', 'Ya Kong', 'Jiajia Wang', 'Wanyuan Xia', 'Jing Guo', 'Jie Liu', 'Hailan Sun', 'Kai Liu', 'Jian Yang', 'Mantian Mi', 'Hongxia Xu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Curr Cancer Drug Targets""","""['Platycodin D induces tumor growth arrest by activating FOXO3a expression in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'T63, a new 4-arylidene curcumin analogue, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through activation of the reactive oxygen species-FOXO3a pathway in lung cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of AKT promotes FOXO3a-dependent apoptosis in prostate cancer.', 'FOXO3a signaling pathway in prostate cancer: Progress in studies.', 'Soy isoflavones and prostate cancer: a review of molecular mechanisms.', 'The role of isoflavones in augmenting the effects of radiotherapy.', 'Salviae\xa0miltiorrhiza against human lung cancer: A review of its mechanism (Review).', 'Gut Microbiota-Assisted Synthesis, Cellular Interactions and Synergistic Perspectives of Equol as a Potent Anticancer Isoflavone.', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.', 'FOXO3a-ROS pathway is involved in androgen-induced proliferation of prostate cancer cell.']"""

Patients and methods:   Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), exonic SNP rs12422149 and intronic SNPs rs1789693 and rs1077858, were genotyped in an independent validation cohort of 616 patients with PC who were treated with ADT at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 1996 to 2013. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for known prognostic factors estimated the association of these genetic variants with TTP and OS in patients receiving ADT. The expression of SLCO2B1 was examined in prostatectomy samples, and the impact of SLCO2B1 expression level on DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) uptake was evaluated in cell lines.  Results:   The association between exonic SNP rs12422149 and TTP in patients treated with ADT was confirmed in univariable (P = .019) and multivariable analyses (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.72 for GG v AA/AG; P = .049). Because OS had not been previously evaluated, we examined the association in the combined initial and validation cohorts (N = 1,094). The intronic SNP rs1077858 was associated with OS in both univariable (P = .009; Bonferroni's method adjusted P = .027) and multivariable analyses (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.71 for GG v AA/AG; P = .012).

However, EMT has not been fully explored in clinical specimens of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) metastases. To assess EMT in CRPC, gene expression analysis was performed on 149 visceral and bone metastases from 62 CRPC patients and immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 185 CRPC bone and visceral metastases from 42 CRPC patients. In addition, to assess the potential of metastases to seed further metastases the mitochondrial genome was sequenced at different metastatic sites in one patient. TGFβ was increased in bone versus visceral metastases. While primarily cytoplasmic; nuclear and cytoplasmic Twist were significantly higher in bone than in visceral metastases. Slug and Zeb1 were unchanged, with the exception of nuclear Zeb1 being significantly higher in visceral metastases. Importantly, nuclear Twist, Slug, and Zeb1 were only present in a subset of epithelial cells that had an EMT-like phenotype. Underscoring the relevance of EMT-like cells, mitochondrial sequencing revealed that metastases could seed additional metastases in the same patient. In conclusion, while TGFβ expression and EMT-associated protein expression is present in a considerable number of CRPC visceral and bone metastases, nuclear Twist, Slug, and Zeb1 localization and an EMT-like phenotype (elongated nuclei and cytoplasmic compartment) was only present in a small subset of CRPC bone metastases.

This is a general problem of non-in situ techniques, whereas results from in situ techniques are often difficult to quantify. The use of bulk tissue, which is not precisely characterized in terms of histology, has long been the basis for molecular analysis. It has, however, become apparent, that this simple approach is not sufficient for a detailed analysis of molecular alterations, which might be restricted to a specific tissue phenotype (e.g., tumor or normal tissue, stromal or epithelial cells). Microdissection is a method to provide minute amounts of histologically characterized tissues for molecular analysis with non-in situ techniques and has become an indispensable research tool. If tissue diversity is moderate and negligible, manual microdissection can be an easy and cost-efficient method of choice. In contrast, the advantage of laser microdissection is a very exact selection down to the level of a single cell, but often with a considerable time exposure to get enough material for the following analyses. The latter issue and the method of tissue preparation needed for laser microdissection are the main problems to solve if RNA, highly sensitive to degradation, shall be analyzed.

Methods:   We identified men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database who had open or robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy from 2006 to 2013. Univariable logistic regression was used to test the association between age, race, body mass index, total biopsy cores, number of positive biopsy cores, risk group, year, center, surgical volume and surgical technique on pelvic lymph node dissection use. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to examine surgical technique and pelvic lymph node dissection performance. Spearman's correlation examined temporal changes in pelvic lymph node dissection utilization stratified by risk group and surgical technique.  Results:   A total of 1425 men met inclusion criteria; 67% of them underwent pelvic lymph node dissection. On multivariable analysis, robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy was associated with an 92% decreased use of pelvic lymph node dissection in low-risk, 84% decreased in intermediate-risk and 91% decreased in high-risk men (all P < 0.001). In robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, there was a trend for increased pelvic lymph node dissection utilization over time in high-risk men (Spearman; P = 0.077) reaching ~85% in 2012-2013, which was accompanied by increased use in low-risk men (P = 0.016). For open radical prostatectomy, fewer pelvic lymph node dissections were carried out in low-risk men over time, decreasing to ~35% (P = 0.047) in 2012-2013, whereas rates remained high for high-risk men throughout (~95%; P = 0.621).  Conclusion:   Regardless of risk group, pelvic lymph node dissection is carried out significantly less during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. For robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection utilization increased over time for high-risk men, but rates also increased for low-risk men.

Whilst it is a well-documented side-effect of estrogen therapy in females, we describe what we believe to be the first report in the literature of erythema nodosum as a result of estrogen therapy in a male.  Case presentation:   A 64-year-old Afro-Caribbean man with locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate agreed to participate in a randomized controlled trial comparing estrogen patches with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs to achieve androgen deprivation, and was allocated to the group receiving estrogen patches. One month later he presented with tender lesions on his shins and painful swelling of his ankles, wrists, and left shoulder. This was followed by progressive severe fatigue that required hospital admission, where he was diagnosed with erythema nodosum by a rheumatologist. Two months after discontinuing the estrogen patches the erythema nodosum, and associated symptoms, had fully resolved, and to date he remains well with no further recurrence.  Conclusion:   Trial results may establish transdermal estrogen as an alternative to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs in the management of prostate cancer, and has already been established as a therapy for male to female transsexuals. It is essential to record the toxicity profile of transdermal estrogen in men to ensure accurate safety information. This case report highlights a previously undocumented toxicity of estrogen therapy in men, of which oncologists, urologists, and endocrinologists need to be aware.

This study is the first to comparatively evaluate image processing and registration methods used to register the rectums in EBRT and HDR CTs of prostate cancer patients. The focus is on the rectum due to planned future analysis of rectal dose-volume response.  Methods:   For 64 patients, the EBRT CT was retrospectively registered to the HDR CT with rigid registration and non-rigid registration methods in VelocityAI. Image processing was undertaken on the HDR CT and the rigidly-registered EBRT CT to reduce the impact of discriminating features on alternative non-rigid registration methods applied in the software suite for Deformable Image Registration and Adaptive Radiotherapy Research (DIRART) using the Horn-Schunck optical flow and Demons algorithms. The propagated EBRT-rectum structures were compared with the HDR structure using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD) and average surface distance (ASD). The image similarity was compared using mutual information (MI) and root mean squared error (MSE). The displacement vector field was assessed via the Jacobian determinant (JAC). The post-registration alignments of rectums for 21 patients were visually assessed.  Results:   The greatest improvement in the median DSC relative to the rigid registration result was 35 % for the Horn-Schunck algorithm with image processing. This algorithm also provided the best ASD results. The VelocityAI algorithms provided superior HD, MI, MSE and JAC results. The visual assessment indicated that the rigid plus deformable multi-pass method within VelocityAI resulted in the best rectum alignment.  Conclusions:   The DSC, ASD and HD improved significantly relative to the rigid registration result if image processing was applied prior to DIRART non-rigid registrations, whereas VelocityAI without image processing provided significant improvements. Reliance on a single rectum structure-correspondence metric would have been misleading as the metrics were inconsistent with one another and visual assessments. It was important to calculate metrics for a restricted region covering the organ of interest. Overall, VelocityAI generated the best registrations for the rectum according to the visual assessment, HD, MI, MSE and JAC results.""","""['Calyn R Moulton', 'Michael J House', 'Victoria Lye', 'Colin I Tang', 'Michele Krawiec', 'David J Joseph', 'James W Denham', 'Martin A Ebert']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Deformable image registration for contour propagation from CT to cone-beam CT scans in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Propagation of target and organ at risk contours in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using deformable image registration.', 'Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Development and performance assessment of an advanced Lucas-Kanade algorithm for dose mapping of cervical cancer external radiotherapy and brachytherapy plans.', 'Evaluation of Deformable Image Registration-Based Contour Propagation From Planning CT to Cone-Beam CT.', 'Prostate external beam radiotherapy combined with high-dose-rate brachytherapy: dose-volume parameters from deformably-registered plans correlate with late gastrointestinal complications.']"""

The financial benefits of performing prostatectomies at high-volume centers (HVC) are unexplored.  Methods:   A base case--referent scenario--where the share of prostatectomies at high- and low-volume centers were evenly divided at 50% was defined. Additional scenarios with increasing shares of prostatectomies at HVC with 10% increments were also modeled. Using a lower probability of PSAR as the only advantage of more experienced surgeons, the savings that would result from fewer recurrences, avoidance of salvage radiation therapy (SRT) and management of fewer men with metastatic cancer were calculated.  Results:   The savings associated with performing 80% of radical prostatectomy at HVC were $177, $357 and $559 per prostatectomy at 5, 10 and 20 years, respectively. These savings would offset referral costs of up to $1833 per prostatectomy referral at no additional total societal costs. Given the longer average biochemical failure-free survival with prostatectomies at HVC, referral costs of more than $1833 may be cost effective.  Conclusions:   Under the conservative assumption of accounting for lower rates of PSAR as the only benefit of surgery in an HVC, performing prostatectomies at an HVC was associated with savings that may offset part of the initial referral costs.""","""['A Barzi', 'E A Klein', 'T B Dorff', 'D I Quinn', 'S Sadeghi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Access to high-volume surgeons and the opportunity cost of performing radical prostatectomy by low-volume providers.', 'Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'Health Economic Analysis of Open and Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Surgery for Prostate Cancer Within the Prospective Multicentre LAPPRO Trial.', 'Systematic review and economic modelling of the relative clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery for removal of the prostate in men with localised prostate cancer.', 'Salvage radical prostatectomy as management of locally recurrent prostate cancer: outcomes and complications.', 'Comparison between intra- and postoperative outcomes of the da Vinci SP and da Vinci Xi robotic platforms in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of Clinical Outcomes of Radical Prostatectomy versus IMRT with Long-Term Hormone Therapy for Relatively Young Patients with High- to Very High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Influence of the facility caseload on the subsequent survival of men with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Access to high-volume surgeons and the opportunity cost of performing radical prostatectomy by low-volume providers.']"""

Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is the most common cancer in men. High gradus-prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) lesions precede invasive cancer. Prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) implies a complete absence of basal cells and stromal invasion by malignant acini. Estrogen receptor (ER) is located in nuclei of acinar basal and secretory cells and partially in stromal cells. The aim of this research was to demonstrate and localize ER in BPH and in PCa of different Gleason scores. Considering literature data for ER-beta. expression in different morphologic prostate lesions, it is assumed that there is expression of ER-beta in most moderately differentiated PCa, and that the observed receptor expression is lost with increasing of the Gleason score.  Methods:   Four groups of patients were formed: the control with BPH and three experimental groups with PCa of different grades and scores, according to the Gleason grading system. The patients were male of various ages suspected of PCa, based on clinical and laboratory parameters. The study was conducted in a period 2010-2012. None of the patients received prior hormonal therapy. Sextant byopsies with BPH and PCa were treated for ER-beta (Novacastra). Localization and intensity of ER-beta expression is reported through the score: 0 = zero; 1 = < 1%; 2 = 1-10%; 3=11-33%; 4= 34-66%; 5- > 66%. Positive fibroblasts and endothelial cells are used for comparison.  Results:   ER-beta expression in acinar epithelial cells was the weakest in well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. A decline of ER-beta expression was noticed in malignant lesions of the prostate vs. benign ones. Less differentiated adenocarcinomas showed a decrease of ER-beta expression in basal and in the secretory cells. ER-beta expression in basal cells was stronger than in secretory ones in BPH and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Conclusion:   ER-beta expression was most pronounced in BHP samples and declined in malignant prostate lesions.

The aim of this observational, retrospective study was to analyze the particularities of urinary disorders, which appeared in patients with diabetes, admitted in a urology ward.  Material and methods:   A total of 6910 patients admitted in ""Th. Burghele"" Hospital from January 2013 to July 2014 were analyzed. Only admissions in urology wards and the first hospitalization of the patient were elements that were taken into account. Data was taken from the Hipocrate medical information system and Easy Medical Pro laboratory medical software. Study variables were age and sex of patients, the main discharge diagnosis, the number of days of hospitalization and the laboratory analyses collected on the day of admission. The data of the whole lot was analyzed and then an analysis on subgroups of patients was done.  Results:   There were 16.52% (n=1142) patients with diabetes in the total group of analyzed patients. Urinary stones were the most frequent cause of hospitalization, both in patients with diabetes and in patients without diabetes (28.5%, respectively 37.5%). The average age was 60.01 years and the mean duration of hospitalization was 6.52 days. Patients with diabetes hospitalized for urinary stones, renal cancer, and infectious pathology were significantly older than patients without diabetes. The presence of diabetes prolonged hospitalization in the case of patients with kidney stones, kidney cancer and in those with infectious pathology. The most common malignancy was bladder cancer in both groups of patients. Malignancies were more common in diabetics (19.08% vs. 15.98%) and diabetes was a risk factor for malignancy in our study. In particular, patients with diabetes had a significantly increased risk of bladder cancer. In the analyzed group, diabetes was positively associated with prostate adenoma, genital infections, and prostate infections.  Conclusions:   Diabetes increased the risk for certain urological diseases (bladder cancer, prostate adenoma, prostate and genital infections), it prolonged hospitalizations, and it was associated with certain features of laboratory analysis (leukocytosis, decreased glomerular filtration rate).""","""['I Verde', 'E Rusu', 'E Suliman', 'A Costache', 'P Armean']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Med Life""","""['Frequency of diabetes mellitus and nature of treatment in urologic diseases.', 'Community-acquired urinary tract infections in the internal and nephrology ward: etiology and selected risk factors.', 'The future of urology: nonagenarians admitted to a urological ward.', 'Natural history of peptic ulcer disease in Poland.

Objective:   In the present study, the aim was to investigate in vitro anti-oxidant, cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects of Achillea teretifolia Willd extracts (Turkish name: Beyaz civanperÇemi).  Materials and methods:   The anti-oxidant potential of the extracts was analyzed by the free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and total phenolic content methods. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was used to detect cytotoxicity of the extracts onhuman prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and PC-3) and human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells. mRNA expression levels of pro-apoptotic (bax, caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic (bcl-2) genes were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   The results showed that extracts exhibited a remarkable DPPH scavenging activity, and total phenolic content of the methanol extract was higher than that of the water extract. As time and concentration were increased, the methanol extract exhibited a more powerful cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cells. In prostate cancer cells, the levels of mRNA expression of the bax and caspase-3 genes were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05), whereas the expression of bcl-2 was down-regulated (P < 0.05). In HGF cells, there were no cytotoxic effect and apoptosis induction triggered by the extracts.  Conclusion:   The methanol extract had more powerful anti-oxidant, cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects than the water extract.

Most of these studies relied on self-reported outcomes to determine efficacy of the therapy which could allow response bias to affect their results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nightly sildenafil citrate therapy during penile rehabilitation, using nocturnal penile rigidity (RigiScan(™), Gotop Medical, Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) in addition to the IIEF-EF. Patients with localized prostate cancer and normal erectile function prior to nsRP were randomized to take either nightly 50 mg sildenafil citrate or placebo starting the night following surgery. Both groups were allowed on-demand sildenafil citrate. Erectile function was evaluated at 2 weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-operatively, with a final assessment made at 13 months, following a 1 month drug washout. At all time points, self-reported (IIEF-EF) and objective (RigiScan(™)) measures were obtained and evaluated. About 74 of 97 randomized patients completed the study. On completion, 40% of patients in each group had normal erectile function based on RigiScan(™) (p = 1.0).

Multivariable analysis showed no significant differences in erectile function based on treatment intervention. Results did show that African-American men in this cohort were at higher risk for lower RigiScan(™) scores over time (OR: 0.48, p = 0.0399).

In this study, we identified the intermediate signaling molecules and specialized cell structures which are activated by LPA, resulting in enhanced cellular invasion. LPA-induced Akt and IκBα signaling pathways were necessary for RhoA and NF-κB activation, and these LPA effects were abolished by RhoA inhibition. Mice injected with PC-3 cells expressing dominant-negative RhoA N19 developed significantly less tumor growth compared with those injected with control (pcDNA 3.1). In addition, LPA treatment increased functional invadopodia formation. Activation of RhoA and NF-κB through the Akt and IκBα signaling pathway was required for LPA-stimulated gelatin degradation activity. LPA administration increased tumor growth and osteolytic lesions in a mouse xenograft model. These results indicate that LPA promotes PC-3 cell invasion by increasing functional invadopodia formation via upregulating RhoA and NF-κB signaling which contributes to prostate cancer progression.

Its mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, but previous studies show immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the tumor inhibiting effect of tasquinimod in bone of castrated mice as well as to elucidate its working mechanism related to bone microenvironment.  Methods:   Effects of tasquinimod on prostate cancer metastasis to bone was studied in an intratibial xenograft model. Animals were treated with tasquinimod and tumor establishment and growth, immunological status, as well as markers for bone remodeling were analyzed. Direct effects of tasquinimod on osteoblasts were studied in vitro.  Results:   Establishment and growth of tumors in the bone after intratibial implantation in castrated mice was suppressed by tasquinimod treatment. The treatment effect was linked to decreased potential for immunosuppression in the pre-metastatic niche in bone (lower levels of CD206 and Arg1 expression in combination with increased iNOS expression) as well as in the tumor microenvironment (less Gr1 and CD206 staining). The shift to a pro-inflammatory, anti-tumorigenic milieu was also reflected in serum by increased levels of IFN-γ, CCL4, IL-5, LIX, IP-10, and MCP-1 as well as decreased TGF-β. Tasquinimod treatment also affected expression of factors involved in the pre-metastatic niche in the bone microenvironment (Lox, Cdh2, Cdh11, and Cxcl12). In addition, tasquinimod treatment caused a decreased osteogenic response indicated by decreased expression of Ocn, Runx2, and Col1a2 and increased expression of osteoclast stimulating CSF2. In vitro studies on mouse osteoblasts showed impaired osteoblast mineralization upon tasquinimod treatment.  Conclusions:   The present study shows that tasquinimod reduces establishment and progression of tumor growth in bone likely through a combination of effects on the pre-metastatic niche, homing, immunological status, and osteogenesis. It was concluded that tasquinimod interferes with the metastatic process, presumably by inhibition of tumor establishment. Hence, our data suggest that tasquinimod might be most effective in inhibiting the occurrence of new metastatic lesions.""","""['Lisa U Magnusson', 'Malin Hagberg Thulin', 'Pascale Plas', 'Anders Olsson', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Karin Welén']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Inhibition of metastasis in a castration resistant prostate cancer model by the quinoline-3-carboxamide tasquinimod (ABR-215050).', 'The quinoline-3-carboxamide anti-angiogenic agent, tasquinimod, enhances the anti-prostate cancer efficacy of androgen ablation and taxotere without effecting serum PSA directly in human xenografts.', 'Tasquinimod: How to act on microenvironment in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Upregulation of CRMP4, a new prostate cancer metastasis suppressor gene, inhibits tumor growth in a nude mouse intratibial injection model.', 'Bone microenvironment-targeted manipulations for the treatment of osteoblastic metastasis in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'S100A8/S100A9 Promote Progression of Multiple Myeloma via Expansion of Megakaryocytes.', 'Advancing Treatment of Bone Metastases through Novel Translational Approaches Targeting the Bone Microenvironment.', 'Costimulatory Effect of Rough Calcium Phosphate Coating and Blood Mononuclear Cells on Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells In Vitro as a Model of In Vivo Tissue Repair.', 'Phase Ib Trial of Cabazitaxel and Tasquinimod in Men With Heavily Pretreated Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC): The CATCH Trial.', 'Diagnostic, prognostic and predictive value of cell-free miRNAs in prostate cancer: a systematic review.']"""

Methods:   Data from 542 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2006 were analyzed. The impact of preoperative variables including age, prostate-specific antigen, biopsy Gleason sum, clinical stage, and ACCI on OM, CSM, and OCM were analyzed according to risk groups, with a median follow-up of 101 months.  Results:   Subjects were stratified into either the high-risk group (n = 241) or the non-high-risk group (n = 301).

To identify novel transcriptional collaborators of EZH2 in cancers, a computational approach was developed that integrates protein-DNA binding data, cell perturbation gene expression data, and compendiums of tumor expression profiles. This holistic approach identified E2F1, a known mediator of the Rb tumor suppressor, as a transcriptional collaborator of EZH2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Subsequent analysis and experimental validation found EZH2 and E2F1 cobind to a subset of chromatin sites lacking H3K27 trimethylation, and activate genes that are critical for prostate cancer progression. The collaboration of EZH2 and E2F1 in transcriptional regulation is also observed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines, where activation of the transcriptional network is concordant with the cellular response to the EZH2 inhibitor.

At dimensions below ~420 μm in diameter, as suggested by a simple metabolite transport model and confirmed experimentally, continuous perfusion is not required to keep samples alive, considerably simplifying the technical challenges. For the long-term culture of MDTs, we describe a simple microfluidic platform that can reliably trap samples in a low shear stress environment. We report the analysis of MDT viability for eight different types of tissues (four mouse xenografts derived from human cancer cell lines, three from ovarian and prostate cancer patients, and one from a patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia) analyzed by both confocal microscopy and flow cytometry over an 8-day incubation period. Finally, we provide a proof of principle for chemosensitivity testing of human tissue from a cancer patient performed using the described MDT chip method.

Tumor-stromal interactions are a dynamic process that involves both cell-cell communications and extracellular vesicles and soluble factors. Growing body of evidence suggests that microRNAs are part of the payload that comprises the extracellular vesicles. microRNAs induce reactive stroma and thus convert normal stroma into tumor-associated stroma to promote aggressive tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Landmark published studies demonstrate that expression of specific microRNAs of DLK1-DIO3 stem cell cluster correlates with patient survival in metastatic prostate cancer.

Herein, we evaluated the association of FH with clinicopathologic outcomes among men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   We identified 16,472 men who underwent RP between 1987 and 2010 at Mayo Clinic. Patients were considered to have a positive FH if at least one first-degree relative had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associations of FH with clinicopathologic features and survival were evaluated using logistic and Cox regression analyses.  Results:   Overall, 5323 (32.3 %) men reported a FH of prostate cancer. Median follow-up was 9.9 years (IQR 5.9, 15.5). Patients with a FH were significantly more likely to have low-risk disease (47.7 vs. 43.0 %; p < 0.0001) and were significantly more likely to have organ-confined disease at RP (79.2 vs. 74.4 %; p < 0.0001). Men with FH had a significantly higher 10-year cancer-specific (99 vs. 97 %; p < 0.001) and overall survival (92 vs. 85 %; p < 0.001) than men without FH. Moreover, on multivariable analysis, FH of prostate cancer remained independently associated with reduced cancer-specific (HR 0.68; p = 0.003) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.69; p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   In this surgical population, FH of prostate cancer was associated with lower-risk disease at diagnosis, more favorable pathology at RP, and significantly better cancer-specific and overall survival.

Because of its overexpression in a number of human cancers and its essential role in cell proliferation, transformation, and cell cycle progression, PRMT5 has been recently proposed to function as an oncoprotein in cancer cells. However, how its expression is regulated in cancer cells remains largely unknown. We have previously demonstrated that the transcription of PRMT5 can be negatively regulated by the PKC/c-Fos signaling pathway through modulating the transcription factor NF-Y in prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that PRMT5 undergoes polyubiquitination, possibly through multiple lysine residues. We also identified carboxyl terminus of heat shock cognate 70-interacting protein (CHIP), an important chaperone-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase that couples protein folding/refolding to protein degradation, as an interacting protein of PRMT5 via mass spectrometry. Their interaction was further verified by co-immuoprecipitation, GST pull-down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. In addition, we provided evidence that the CHIP/chaperone system is essential for the negative regulation of PRMT5 expression via K48-linked ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Given that down-regulation of CHIP and overexpression of PRMT5 have been observed in several human cancers, our finding suggests that down-regulation of CHIP may be one of the mechanisms underlying PRMT5 overexpression in these cancers.""","""['Huan-Tian Zhang', 'Ling-Fei Zeng', 'Qing-Yu He', 'W Andy Tao', 'Zhen-Gang Zha', 'Chang-Deng Hu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) promotes basal and geldanamycin-induced degradation of estrogen receptor-alpha.', 'The chaperone-assisted E3 ligase C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) targets PTEN for proteasomal degradation.', 'E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP interacts with C-type lectin-like receptor CLEC-2 and promotes its ubiquitin-proteasome degradation.', 'CHIP: a co-chaperone for degradation by the proteasome.', 'Exploring the Rampant Expansion of Ubiquitin Proteomics.', 'The dual role of p63 in cancer.', 'TRAF6 Promotes PRMT5 Activity in a Ubiquitination-Dependent Manner.', 'Protein homeostasis in the aged and diseased heart.', 'PRMT5-mediated regulatory arginine methylation of RIPK3.', 'Chaperone-assisted E3 ligase CHIP: A double agent in cancer.']"""

Here, we demonstrated that chemo- and radiotherapy agents such as camptothecin (CPT) and γ irradiation decrease EZH2 expression in various PCa cell lines. We provided evidence that functional p53 and RB proteins are required for CPT- and irradiation-induced downregulation of EZH2 in CRPC cells.

Among these, choline kinase alpha (CHKA) expression was evaluated in benign (n = 195), prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) (n = 153) and prostate cancer (PCa) lesions (n = 359). We interrogated how CHKA regulates AR signaling using biochemical assays and investigated androgen regulation of CHKA expression in men with PCa, both untreated (n = 20) and treated with an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor degarelix (n = 27). We studied the effect of CHKA inhibition on the PCa transcriptome using RNA sequencing and tested the effect of CHKA inhibition on cell growth, clonogenic survival and invasion. Tumor xenografts (n = 6 per group) were generated in mice using genetically engineered prostate cancer cells with inducible CHKA knockdown. Data were analyzed with χ(2) tests, Cox regression analysis, and Kaplan-Meier methods. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   CHKA expression was shown to be androgen regulated in cell lines, xenografts, and human tissue (log fold change from 6.75 to 6.59, P = .002) and was positively associated with tumor stage. CHKA binds directly to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AR, enhancing its stability. As such, CHKA is the first kinase identified as an AR chaperone. Inhibition of CHKA repressed the AR transcriptional program including pathways enriched for regulation of protein folding, decreased AR protein levels, and inhibited the growth of PCa cell lines, human PCa explants, and tumor xenografts.  Conclusions:   CHKA can act as an AR chaperone, providing, to our knowledge, the first evidence for kinases as molecular chaperones, making CHKA both a marker of tumor progression and a potential therapeutic target for PCa.""","""['Mohammad Asim', 'Charles E Massie', 'Folake Orafidiya', 'Nelma Pértega-Gomes', 'Anne Y Warren', 'Mohsen Esmaeili', 'Luke A Selth', 'Heather I Zecchini', 'Katarina Luko', 'Arham Qureshi', 'Ajoeb Baridi', 'Suraj Menon', 'Basetti Madhu', 'Carlos Escriu', 'Scott Lyons', 'Sarah L Vowler', 'Vincent R Zecchini', 'Greg Shaw', 'Wiebke Hessenkemper', 'Roslin Russell', 'Hisham Mohammed', 'Niki Stefanos', 'Andy G Lynch', 'Elena Grigorenko', ""Clive D'Santos"", 'Chris Taylor', 'Alastair Lamb', 'Rouchelle Sriranjan', 'Jiali Yang', 'Rory Stark', 'Scott M Dehm', 'Paul S Rennie', 'Jason S Carroll', 'John R Griffiths', 'Simon Tavaré', 'Ian G Mills', 'Iain J McEwan', 'Aria Baniahmad', 'Wayne D Tilley', 'David E Neal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Choline Kinase α Mediates Interactions Between the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells to Promote Drug Resistance and Xenograft Tumor Progression.', 'Down-regulation of protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide attenuates tumor progression and is an independent prognostic predictor of survival in prostate cancer.', 'Neoisoliquiritin exerts tumor suppressive effects on prostate cancer by repressing androgen receptor activity.', 'BAG1L: a promising therapeutic target for androgen receptor-dependent prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Ultrastructural analysis of prostate cancer tissue provides insights into androgen-dependent adaptations to membrane contact site establishment.', 'Biosynthesis and Significance of Fatty Acids, Glycerophospholipids, and Triacylglycerol in the Processes of Glioblastoma Tumorigenesis.', 'Neurogenesis manifestations of solid tumor and tracer imaging studies: a narrative review.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'VEGF Overexpression Significantly Increases Nanoparticle-Mediated siRNA Delivery and Target-Gene Downregulation.']"""

ED is usually related to cardiovascular disease or is an iatrogenic cause of pelvic surgery. Many non-surgical treatments have been developed with results that are controversial, while surgical treatment has reached high levels of satisfaction. The aim is to evaluate outcomes and complications related to prosthesis implant in patients suffering from ED not responding to conventional medical therapy or reporting side effects with such a therapy. One hundred eighty Caucasian male suffering from ED were selected. The patient population were divided into two groups: 84 patients with diabetes and metabolic syndrome (group A) and 96 patients with dysfunction following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer (group B). All subjects underwent primary inflatable penile prosthesis implant with an infrapubic minimally invasive approach. During 12 months of follow-up, we reported 3 (1.67%) explants for infection, 1 (0.56%) urethral erosion, 1 (0.56%) prosthesis extrusion while no intraoperative complications were reported. Mean International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) was 8.2 ± 4.0 and after the surgery (12 months later) was 20.6 ± 2.7. The improvement after the implant is significant in both groups without a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P-value 0.65). Mean Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) score 1 year after the implant is 72.2 ± 20.7, and there was no statistically significant difference between groups A and B (P-value 0.55).

IL-27 inhibits the growth and invasiveness of different cancers and therefore represents a potential anti-tumor agent. By contrast, it may exert immune-regulatory properties in different biological systems. We reported that IL-27 induces the expression of the IL-18 inhibitor IL-18BP, in human Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) cells, thus potentially limiting the immune response. Here, we tested whether IL-27 may modulate other immune-regulatory molecules involved in EOC progression, including Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and Programmed Death-Ligand (PD-L)1. IDO and PD-L1 were not constitutively expressed by EOC cells in vitro, but IL-27 increased their expression through STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Differently, cells isolated from EOC ascites showed constitutive activation of STAT1 and STAT3 and IDO expression. These findings, together with the expression of IL-27 in scattered leukocytes in EOC ascites and tissues, suggest a potential role of IL-27 in immune-regulatory networks of EOC. In addition, IL-27 induced IDO or PD-L1 expression in monocytes and in human PC3 prostate and A549 lung cancer cells. A current paradigm in tumor immunology is that tumor cells may escape from immune control due to ""adaptive resistance"" mediated by T cell-secreted IFN-γ, which induces PD-L1 and IDO expression in tumor cells.

However, there has also been concern about the over diagnosis and overtreatment of patients with indolent cancers. We performed a population based analysis to evaluate the trade-off between excess treatment and prevention.  Materials and methods:   We used the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey from 2001 to 2010 to determine rates of prostate specific antigen screening. We used the SEER database to identify all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1988 (pre-prostate specific antigen screening) to 2010. Demographic, staging and treatment data were collected. Cases were classified as early (low/intermediate risk), high risk, node positive or metastatic disease.  Results:   Prostate specific antigen screening rates in the last 2 years were 54% for men older than 40 years, including 71% for those older than 60, and did not vary during 2001 to 2010. Comparing 1988 and 2000 to 2010, per 100,000 men the incidence of early prostate cancer increased (61.7 to 113.7), while high risk cancer increased (20.7 to 28.2), node positive cancer decreased (3.7 to 1.8) and metastatic cancer decreased (13.6 to 6.2). The rate of definitive primary treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy) for men with early cancer increased from 47% to 67% (p <0.001).  Conclusions:   Prostate specific antigen screening has led to an additional diagnosis of 5.8 cases of early stage cancer and 3.9 cases receiving treatment for early cancer for every 1 less case of stage IV disease at initial diagnosis. This ratio represents the worst-case scenario for overtreatment and provides a quantitative basis for studying the effect of prostate specific antigen screening.""","""['Xinglei Shen', 'Parvesh Kumar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Trends in incidence and 5-year mortality in men with newly diagnosed, metastatic prostate cancer-A population-based analysis of 2 national cohorts.', 'Trends in Prostate Cancer Incidence Rates and Prevalence of Prostate Specific Antigen Screening by Socioeconomic Status and Regions in the United States, 2004 to 2013.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Pathological Outcome following Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Prostate Specific Antigen Greater than 10 ng/ml and Histologically Favorable Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent Changes in Prostate Cancer Screening Practices and Epidemiology.', 'A randomized controlled trial for acupuncture combined with conventional therapy in the treatment of pain caused by prostate cancer: Study protocol clinical trial (SPIRIT compliant).', 'Quality of Prostate MRI: Is the PI-RADS Standard Sufficient?', 'Assessment of the efficacy of Chinese patent medicine on treating pain caused by prostate cancer: A protocol for systematic review and meta analysis.', 'Traditional Chinese medicine on treating pain caused by prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Treatment patterns of high-dose-rate and low-dose-rate brachytherapy as monotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Our previous data indicate that, in breast cancer cells, DDR1 interacts with IGF-1R and positively modulates IGF-1R expression and biological responses, suggesting that the DDR1-IGF-IR cross-talk may play an important role in cancer. In this study, we set out to evaluate whether IGF-I stimulation may affect DDR1 expression. Indeed, in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) IGF-I induced significant increase of DDR1 protein expression, in a time and dose dependent manner. However, we did not observe parallel changes in DDR1 mRNA. DDR1 upregulation required the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway while the ERK1/2, the p70/mTOR and the PKC pathways were not involved. Moreover, we observed that DDR1 protein upregulation was induced by translational mechanisms involving miR-199a-5p suppression through PI3K/AKT activation. This effect was confirmed by both IGF-II produced by cancer-associated fibroblasts from human breast cancer and by stable transfection of breast cancer cells with a human IGF-II expression construct. Transfection with a constitutively active form of AKT was sufficient to decrease miR-199a-5p and upregulate DDR1. Accordingly, IGF-I-induced DDR1 upregulation was inhibited by transfection with pre-miR-199a-5p, which also impaired AKT activation and cell migration and proliferation in response to IGF-I. These results demonstrate that, in breast cancer cells, a novel pathway involving AKT/miR-199a-5p/DDR1 plays a role in modulating IGFs biological responses. Therefore, this signaling pathway may represent an important target for breast cancers with over-activation of the IGF-IR axis.""","""['Roberta Matà', 'Chiara Palladino', 'Maria Luisa Nicolosi', 'Anna Rita Lo Presti', 'Roberta Malaguarnera', 'Marco Ragusa', 'Daniela Sciortino', 'Andrea Morrione', 'Marcello Maggiolini', 'Veronica Vella', 'Antonino Belfiore']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['A novel functional crosstalk between DDR1 and the IGF axis and its relevance for breast cancer.', 'Discoidin domain receptor 1 modulates insulin receptor signaling and biological responses in breast cancer cells.', 'Novel cross talk between IGF-IR and DDR1 regulates IGF-IR trafficking, signaling and biological responses.', 'Effect of microRNA-135a on Cell Proliferation, Migration, Invasion, Apoptosis and Tumor Angiogenesis Through the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways are involved in IGF-1-induced VEGF-C upregulation in breast cancer.', 'Metformin sensitises osteosarcoma to chemotherapy <em>via</em> the IGF-1R/miR-610/FEN1 pathway.', 'Treating Alpelisib-Induced Hyperinsulinemia in Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer - A Real-Life Experience.', 'Focusing on discoidin domain receptors in premalignant and malignant liver diseases.', 'Insulin resistance, autophagy and apoptosis in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: Association with PI3K signaling pathway.', 'A network map of discoidin domain receptor 1(DDR1)-mediated signaling in pathological conditions.']"""

Longitudinal observations on the efficacy of A. annua in patients are, however missing as of yet.  Methods:   Clinical diagnosis was performed by imaging techniques (MRT, scintigraphy, SPECT/CT) and blood examinations of standard parameters from clinical chemistry. Immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor material was performed to determine the expression of several biomarkers (cycloxygenase-2 (COX2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), Ki-67, MYC, oxidized low density lipoprotein (lectin-like) receptor 1 (LOX1), p53, P-glycoprotein, transferrin receptor (TFR, CD71), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), von Willebrand factor (CD31)). The immunohistochemical expression has been compared with the microarray-based mRNA expression of these markers in two prostate carcinoma cell lines (PC-3, DU-145).  Results:   A patient with prostate carcinoma (pT3bN1M1, Gleason score 8 (4+4)) presented with a prostate specific antigen (PSA) level >800 µg/l. After short-term treatment with bacalitumide (50 mg/d for 14 days) and long-term oral treatment with A. annua capsules (continuously 5 × 50 mg/d), the PSA level dropped down to 0.98 µg/l. MRT, scintigraphy and SPECT/CT verified tumor remission. Seven months later, PSA and ostase levels increased, indicating tumor recurrence and skeletal metastases. Substituting A. annua capsules by artesunate injections (2 × 150 mg twice weekly i.v.) did not prohibit tumor recurrence. PSA and ostase levels rose to 1245 µg/l and 434 U/l, respectively, and MRT revealed progressive skeletal metastases, indicating that the tumor acquired resistance. The high expression of MYC, TFR, and VEGFC in the patient biopsy corresponded with high expression of these markers in the artemisinin-sensitive PC-3 cells compared to artemisinin-resistant DU-145 cells.

In this study, through deep-sequencing of size fractionated small RNA libraries we profiled the miRNAs of prostate epithelial (PrEC) and stromal (PrSC) cells. Over 50 million reads were obtained for PrEC in which 860,468 were unique sequences. Similarly, nearly 76 million reads for PrSC were obtained in which over 1 million were unique reads. Expression of many miRNAs of broadly conserved and poorly conserved miRNA families were identified. Sixteen highly expressed miRNAs with significant change in expression in PrSC than PrEC were further analyzed in silico. ConsensusPathDB showed the target genes of these miRNAs were significantly involved in adherence junction, cell adhesion, EGRF, TGF-β and androgen signaling. Let-7 family of tumor-suppressor miRNAs expression was highly pervasive in both, PrEC and PrSC cells. In addition, we have also identified several miRNAs that are unique to PrEC or PrSC cells and their predicted putative targets are a group of transcription factors. This study provides perspective on the miRNA expression in PrEC and PrSC, and reveals a global trend in miRNA interactome. We conclude that the most abundant miRNAs are potential regulators of development and differentiation of the prostate gland by targeting a set of growth factors.

We use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to consider asymmetric lipid membrane models whose compositions are based on the lipidomics data determined for exosomes released by PC-3 prostate cancer cells. The simulations show interdigitation to be exceptionally strong for long-chain sphingomyelin (SM) molecules. In asymmetric membranes the amide-linked chain of SM is observed to extend deep into the opposing membrane leaflet. Interestingly, we find that the conformational order of the amide-linked SM chain increases the deeper it penetrates to the opposing leaflet. Analysis of this finding reveals that the amide-linked SM chain interacts favorably with the lipid chains in the opposite leaflet, and that cholesterol modulates the effect of SM interdigitation by influencing the conformational order of lipid hydrocarbon chains in the opposing (cytosolic) leaflet.""","""['Tomasz Róg', 'Adam Orłowski', 'Alicia Llorente', 'Tore Skotland', 'Tuulia Sylvänne', 'Dimple Kauhanen', 'Kim Ekroos', 'Kirsten Sandvig', 'Ilpo Vattulainen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Ordered raft domains induced by outer leaflet sphingomyelin in cholesterol-rich asymmetric vesicles.', 'Long-chain GM1 gangliosides alter transmembrane domain registration through interdigitation.', 'Effect of hydrophobic mismatch and interdigitation on sterol/sphingomyelin interaction in ternary bilayer membranes.', 'Regulation of the transbilayer movement of diacylglycerol in the plasma membrane.', 'Atom-scale molecular interactions in lipid raft mixtures.', 'Building Asymmetric Lipid Bilayers for Molecular Dynamics Simulations: What Methods Exist and How to Choose One?', 'Innovative antibacterial electrospun nanofibers mats depending on piezoelectric generation.', 'Dysregulation of cellular membrane homeostasis as a crucial modulator of cancer risk.', 'Structural basis for acyl chain control over glycosphingolipid sorting and vesicular trafficking.', 'Phosphatidylserine and Phosphatidylethanolamine Asymmetry Have a Negligible Effect on the Global Structure, Dynamics, and Interactions of the KRAS Lipid Anchor.']"""

The post-SRT nadir <0.1 ng/ml correlated significantly with less recurrences and with better overall survival. In multivariable Cox analysis restricted to pre-SRT parameters, a pre-SRT PSA ⩾0.2 ng/ml had the strongest impact (hazard ratio 2.4) on progression. If the post-SRT PSA nadir was included in the model, then failing the nadir was the most important risk factor (hazard ratio 8.1).  Conclusions:   Early SRT at a PSA <0.2 ng/ml is a favorable treatment option for post-RP biochemical recurrence. It correlated with a post-SRT PSA-nadir <0.1 ng/ml which was associated with improved freedom from progression and overall survival.""","""['Detlef Bartkowiak', 'Dirk Bottke', 'Reinhard Thamm', 'Alessandra Siegmann', 'Wolfgang Hinkelbein', 'Thomas Wiegel']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Prostate-specific antigen after salvage radiotherapy for postprostatectomy biochemical recurrence predicts long-term outcome including overall survival.', 'Defining biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and timing of early salvage radiotherapy : Informing the debate.', 'Effect of early salvage radiotherapy at PSA\u2009<\u20090.5\u2009ng/ml and impact of post-SRT PSA nadir in post-prostatectomy recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Adjuvant vs. salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'The timing of salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'Clinical outcomes of salvage treatment in lymph node-positive prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'A survey among German-speaking radiation oncologists on PET-based radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET on patient management and outcome, including all patients referred for an increase in PSA level during the first year after its clinical introduction.']"""

This work evaluated the performance and the effectiveness of that PSA biosensor in screening the biomarker PSA in biological media with complex composition, collected from different human prostate cell line cultures. For that, the prostate cancer LNCaP and PC3 cells, and the non-cancerous prostate cell line PNT2 were cultured for 2, 7 and 14days in either α-MEM or RPMI in the presence of 10% or 30% fetal bovine serum. Human gingival fibroblasts were used as a non-cancerous non-prostatic control. The different culture conditions modulated cellular proliferation and the expression of several prostate markers, including PSA. The electrochemical biosensor was able to specifically detect PSA in the culture media and values obtained were similar to those achieved by a commercial Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit, the most commonly used method for PSA quantification in prostate cancer diagnosis.

Methods:   The expression of α5-integrin, α7-integrin, Ε-cadherin, and N-cadherin was examined in 157 cases of PCa and adjacent normal prostatic tissue by immunohistochemical assay, and the correlation with clinicopathological features was analyzed.  Results:   Expressions of α5-integrin, α7-integrin, and Ε-cadherin in PCa were lower than those in normal prostatic tissues (P<0.05). N-cadherin expression was higher in cancer prostatic tissue than in normal prostatic tissues (P<0.05). The reduced expression of α5-integrin, α7-integrin, and Ε-cadherin was related to Gleason score, pathological stage, lymph node metastasis, and prostate-specific antigen level, but it was not associated with positive surgical margins and patient age. The increased expression of N-cadherin was related to Gleason score, pathological stage, lymph node metastasis, and prostate-specific antigen level, but not to age and positive surgical margins.

Risk-based patient selection for mpMRI could help to avoid unnecessary mpMRIs.  Objective:   To study the rate of potentially avoided mpMRIs after negative TRUS-guided random biopsy by risk-based patient selection using the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (RPCRC).  Design, setting, and participants:   One hundred and twenty two consecutive men received a mpMRI scan and subsequent MRI-TRUS fusion targeted biopsy in case of suspicious lesion(s) (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System ≥ 3) after negative TRUS-guided random biopsy. Men were retrospectively stratified according to the RPCRC biopsy advice to compare targeted biopsy outcomes after risk-based patient selection with standard (prostate specific antigen and/or digital rectal examination-driven) patient selection.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The rate of potentially avoided mpMRIs by RPCRC-based patient selection in relation to the rate of missed high-grade (Gleason ≥ 3+4) PCa. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the area under the curve of the RPCRC for (high-grade) PCa.  Results and limitations:   Of the 60 men with a positive biopsy advice, six (10%) had low-grade PCa and 28 (47%) had high-grade PCa in targeted biopsy. Of the 62 men with a negative advice, two (3%) had low-grade PCa and three (5%) had high-grade PCa. Upfront RPCRC-based patient selection would have avoided 62 (51%) of 122 mpMRIs and two (25%) of eight low-grade PCa diagnoses, missing three (10%) of 31 high-grade PCa. The area under the curve of the RPCRC for PCa and high-grade PCa was respectively 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.67-0.85) and 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.76-0.93).  Conclusions:   Risk-based patient selection with the RPCRC can avoid half of mpMRIs after a negative prostate specific antigen and/or digital rectal examination-driven TRUS-guided random biopsy. Further improvement in risk-based patient selection for mpMRI could be made by adjusting the RPCRC for MRI-targeted biopsy outcome prediction.  Patient summary:   The suspicion of prostate cancer remains in many men after a negative ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.

Because proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular reactions, are targets for drug actions and constitute potential biomarkers; a quantitative systemic overview of the proteome changes occurring during prostate cancer (PCa) initiation and progression can result in clinically relevant discoveries.  Objectives:   To study cellular processes altered in PCa using system-wide quantitative analysis of changes in protein expression in clinical samples and to identify prognostic biomarkers for disease aggressiveness.  Design, setting, and participants:   Mass spectrometry was used for genome-scale quantitative proteomic profiling of 28 prostate tumors (Gleason score 6-9) and neighboring nonmalignant tissue in eight cases, obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy samples. Two independent cohorts of PCa patients (summing 752 cases) managed by expectancy were used for immunohistochemical evaluation of proneuropeptide-Y (pro-NPY) as a prognostic biomarker.  Results and limitations:   Over 9000 proteins were identified as expressed in the human prostate. Tumor tissue exhibited elevated expression of proteins involved in multiple anabolic processes including fatty acid and protein synthesis, ribosomal biogenesis and protein secretion but no overt evidence of increased proliferation was observed. Tumors also showed increased levels of mitochondrial proteins, which was associated with elevated oxidative phosphorylation capacity measured in situ. Molecular analysis indicated that some of the proteins overexpressed in tumors, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2, fatty acid transporter), coatomer protein complex, subunit alpha (COPA, vesicle secretion), and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 and 2 (MSK1/2, protein kinase) regulate the proliferation of PCa cells. Additionally, pro-NPY was found overexpressed in PCa (5-fold, p<0.05), but largely absent in other solid tumor types. Pro-NPY expression, alone or in combination with the ERG status of the tumor, was associated with an increased risk of PCa specific mortality, especially in patients with Gleason score ≤ 7 tumors.  Conclusions:   This study represents the first system-wide quantitative analysis of proteome changes associated to localized prostate cancer and as such constitutes a valuable resource for understanding the complex metabolic changes occurring in this disease. We also demonstrated that pro-NPY, a protein that showed differential expression between high and low risk tumors in our proteomic analysis, is also a PCa specific prognostic biomarker associated with increased risk for disease specific death in patients carrying low risk tumors.  Patient summary:   The identification of proteins whose expression change in prostate cancer provides novel mechanistic information related to the disease etiology. We hope that future studies will prove the value of this proteome dataset for development of novel therapies and biomarkers.""","""['Diego Iglesias-Gato', 'Pernilla Wikström', 'Stefka Tyanova', 'Charlotte Lavallee', 'Elin Thysell', 'Jessica Carlsson', 'Christina Hägglöf', 'Jürgen Cox', 'Ove Andrén', 'Pär Stattin', 'Lars Egevad', 'Anders Widmark', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Colin C Collins', 'Anders Bergh', 'Tamar Geiger', 'Matthias Mann', 'Amilcar Flores-Morales']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Predictive value of combined analysis of pro-NPY and ERG in localized prostate cancer.', 'ING3 is associated with increased cell invasion and lethal outcome in ERG-negative prostate cancer patients.', 'Characterization of 1577 primary prostate cancers reveals novel biological and clinicopathologic insights into molecular subtypes.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Preoperative Risk Stratification in Esophageal Cancer Surgery: Comparing Risk Models with the Clinical Judgment of the Surgeon.', 'Proteotranscriptomic Discrimination of Tumor and Normal Tissues in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Neuropeptide Y and its receptors in prostate cancer: associations with cancer invasiveness and perineural spread.', 'Potential Role of Seven Proteomics Tissue Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer in Urine.', 'Proteomic Analysis of Prostate Cancer FFPE Samples Reveals Markers of Disease Progression and Aggressiveness.']"""

The aims of this study are to address structural differences at atomic-level between CYP17A1 and inhibitors i.e., abiraterone and TOK-001, and further investigate the effect of point mutation of CYP17A1 on the active site stability and the local interactions that are hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding throughout molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. After performing multiple comparisons among four different complexes across CYP17A1 and inhibitors, interestingly TOK-001 oriented toward the active pocket and formed larger volume with I-helix of CYP17A1 than abiraterone, whereas abiraterone showed tighter binding and more active site stability. Considering on the effect of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding between abiraterone and CYP17A1, the key residues of Phe114, Ile371, Val482, and Asn202 were identified. This contributes into tight binding interactions; however abiraterone is effectively weakened along with the global conformation mobility increased in A105L mutation. Surprisingly, overall conformation of the CYP17A1 remained stable when bound to TOK-001. This basic knowledge can guide future experiments on design of efficient inhibitors for CYP17A1, which provides theoretical basis of androgen-dependent disease therapy.""","""['Fei Xiao', 'Maohua Yang', 'Youjun Xu', 'Wanwipa Vongsangnak']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Comput Struct Biotechnol J""","""['Comparative study of the binding mode between cytochrome P450 17A1 and prostate cancer drugs in the absence of haem iron.', 'Structures of cytochrome P450 17A1 with prostate cancer drugs abiraterone and TOK-001.', 'Human cytochrome P450 17A1 structures with metabolites of prostate cancer drug abiraterone reveal substrate-binding plasticity and a second binding site.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.', 'Resistance to abiraterone in castration-resistant prostate cancer: a review of the literature.', 'Abiraterone induces SLCO1B3 expression in prostate cancer via microRNA-579-3p.', 'Bioinformatics and functional analyses of key genes in smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

We investigated the association between PSA doubling time (PSAdt), PSA velocity (PSAvel) and PSAvel risk count (PSAvRC) and PCa mortality in a cohort of patients with localised PCa managed on watchful waiting.  Patients and methods:   Patients with clinically localised PCa managed observationally, who were randomised to and remained on placebo for minimum 18 months in the SPCG-6 study, were included. All patients survived at least 2 years and had a minimum of three PSA determinations available. The prognostic value of PSA kinetics was analysed and patients were stratified according to their PSA at consent: ≤10, 10.1-25, and >25 ng/ml. Cumulative incidences of PCa-specific mortality were estimated with the Aalen-Johansen method.  Results:   Two hundred and sixty-three patients were included of which 116, 76 and 71 had a PSA at consent ≤10, 10.1-25, and >25 ng/ml, respectively. Median follow-up was 13.6 years. For patients with PSA at consent between 10.1 and 25 ng/ml, the 13-year risks of PCa mortality were associated with PSA kinetics: PSAdt ≤3 years: 62.0% versus PSAdt >3 years: 16.3% (Gray's test: P < 0.0001), PSAvel ≥2 ng/ml/year: 48.0% versus PSAvel <2 ng/ml/year: 11.0% (Gray's test: P = 0.0008), and PSAvRC 2: 45.0% versus 0-1: 3.8% (Gray's test: P = 0.001). In contrast, none of the PSA kinetics were significantly associated with changes of 13-year risks of PCa mortality in patients with PSA at consent ≤10 or >25 ng/ml.  Conclusion:   We found that magnitude changes in 13-year risks of PCa mortality that can be indicated by PSA kinetics depend on PSA level in patients with localised PCa who were managed observationally. Our results question PSA kinetics as surrogate marker for PCa mortality in patients with low and high PSA values.

Family histories for 10,066 colorectal cancer cases recruited to population cancer registries of the Colon Cancer Family Registry were analyzed using a data mining framework. A novel index was developed to quantify familial cancer aggregation. Artificial neural network was used to identify distinct categories of familial risk. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of colorectal cancer were calculated for each category. We identified five major, and 66 minor categories of familial risk for developing colorectal cancer. The distribution the major risk categories were: (1) 7% of families (SIR = 7.11; 95% CI 6.65-7.59) had a strong family history of colorectal cancer; (2) 13% of families (SIR = 2.94; 95% CI 2.78-3.10) had a moderate family history of colorectal cancer; (3) 11% of families (SIR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.12-1.36) had a strong family history of breast cancer and a weak family history of colorectal cancer; (4) 9 % of families (SIR = 1.06; 95 % CI 0.96-1.18) had strong family history of prostate cancer and weak family history of colorectal cancer; and (5) 60% of families (SIR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.57-0.65) had a weak family history of all cancers. There is a wide variation of colorectal cancer risk that can be categorized by family history of cancer, with a strong gradient of colorectal cancer risk between the highest and lowest risk categories. The risk of colorectal cancer for people with the highest risk category of family history (7% of the population) was 12-times that for people in the lowest risk category (60%) of the population.

A secondary objective of the study was to compare transabdominal-transrectal measurements.  Materials and methods:   Male patients (age range 50-80) with lower urinary tract symptoms who applied to our outpatient clinic to be diagnosed with benign prostatic enlargement that were eligible for medical management were included in the prospective study. Patients (n = 49) were administered with tamsulosin for management. At baseline evaluation, all patients underwent International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), transabdominal and transrectal ultrasound [prostate volume (PV), post-void rezidu and intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP)], and prostate subcapsular resistive index value measurement. Follow-ups were carried out 1 and 3 months after treatment. At these time-points, patients were assessed with IPSS and uroflowmetry.  Results:   IPP were identified to be negatively correlated with baseline Qmax values (P = .001, R = -0.485) and positively correlated with PSA (P = .013, R = 0.353) and PV (P = .003, R = 0.420). PV was related with resistive index (P = .026, R = 0.318) and PSA (P = .001, R = 0.619). Subsequent to medical treatment on the follow-ups, an overall improvement in the IPSS and Qmax was identified (P = .001). However, a negative correlation was identified in the change that occurred between IPSS and IPP (P = .004, R = -0.410). Other parameters were not correlated (P > .05) with the change in IPSS and Qmax. Transabdominal and transrectal measures were similar (P = .001).

Methods:   All patients (n = 59) underwent PSA screening and digital rectal exam prior to a B-MRI followed by MRI or transrectal ultrasound fusion-guided targeted biopsy. Previously reported composite formulas incorporating screen positive lesions (SPL) on B-MRI and PSA or PSAD were developed to maximize PCa detection. For PSA, a patient was considered screen positive if PSA level + 6 × (the number of SPL) >14. For PSAD, screening was positive if PSAD × 14 + (the number of SPL) >4.25. These schemes were employed in this new test set to validate the initial formulas. Performance assessment of these formulas was determined for all cancer detection and for tumors with Gleason ≥3 + 4.  Results:   Screen positive lesions on B-MRI had the highest sensitivity (95.5%) and negative predictive value of 71.4% compared with PSA and PSAD. B-MRI significantly improved sensitivity (43.2-72.7%, P = .0002) when combined with PSAD. The negative predictive value of PSA increased with B-MRI, achieving 91.7% for B-MRI and PSA for Gleason ≥3 + 4. Overall accuracies of the composite equations were 81.4% (B-MRI and PSA) and 78.0% (B-MRI and PSAD).

Methods:   We retrospectively studied the development of cancers among kidney transplants patients in our hospital from January 1979 to January 2015. We analyzed demographic and clinical characteristics, risk factors, and patient survival after tumor diagnosis.  Results:   We included 1450 kidney transplants recipients with a mean follow-up was 10 years; among them, 194 developed malignancies. The mean age at presentation was 59 ± 10 years. The SOC, PTLD, and NMSC incidences were 6.2%, 1.2%, and 6%, respectively. The most common tumors were kidney (16.6%), colon (11%), bladder (10%), breast (10%), prostate (10%), and lung (8.8%).

To this end, we present an initial study assessing deformability differences between tumor cells and blood cells, indicated by the length of time required for them to pass through a microfluidic constriction. Here, we demonstrate that deformability changes in tumor cells that have undergone phenotypic shifts are small compared to differences between tumor cell lines and blood cells. Additionally, in a syngeneic mouse tumor model, cells that are able to exit a tumor and enter circulation are not required to be more deformable than the cells that were first injected into the mouse.

Because of the good response to the medicine, no further aspiration or drainage of prostatic abscess was carried out. The anti-tuberculous therapy had to be stopped for serious drug induced liver injury after 6 weeks of anti-tuberculous therapy. Eight weeks later of stopping anti-tuberculous therapy, the follow-up TRUS showed the disappearance of the prostatic abscess and the test of his liver function was normal.

Methods:   A Prostate Cancer Screening Decision Aid was developed and used in conjunction with an educational intervention for African American men in two suburban communities in Southern California. The educational intervention was implemented in local African American churches. The intervention included a PowerPoint® presentation with a four-minute video. Men completed pre- and post-education knowledge questionnaires and a risk assessment decision tool. .  Main research variables:   Prostate cancer knowledge, awareness of prostate cancer personal risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening, information needed for initiating discussions with provider, and intention to participate in shared decision making with healthcare providers. .  Findings:   An 8% increase in knowledge was calculated when comparing pre- and post- education responses. Awareness of personal risks, having the information needed to initiate a discussion with a healthcare provider, intention to participate in shared decision making within six months, prostate cancer knowledge, and having had participated in screening increased. .  Conclusions:   The intervention was successful in increasing knowledge and awareness of personal risks and providing tools to facilitate shared decision making with healthcare providers. .  Implications for nursing:   Nurses can play a meaningful role in collaborating with community lay leaders to develop and implement effective health promotion interventions for African Americans.""","""['Lynette Sandiford', ""Ellen M D'Errico""]""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Nurs Forum""","""['Enhancing public awareness and practice of prostate cancer screening among African men: A scoping review.', 'Are decision aids leading to shared prostate cancer screening decisions among African-American men?: iDecide.', 'Preparing African American Men to Make Informed Prostate Cancer Screening Decisions: Development and Pilot Testing of an Interactive Online Decision Aid.', 'Improvement of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs of African American Men Toward Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Enhancing public awareness and practice of prostate cancer screening among African men: A scoping review.', 'Culturally Responsive Health Promotion to Address Health Disparities in African American Men: A Program Impact Evaluation.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening among High-Risk Black Men.']"""

National population-based data from the Cancer Registry of Norway were used to identify cancer patients diagnosed in 2002-2011 (n = 258,675). We investigated survival from any type of cancer (all cancer sites combined), as well as for the six most common cancers. The effect of adjusting for prognostic factors on regional variations in cancer survival was examined by calculating the mean deviation, defined by the mean absolute deviation of the relative excess risks across health services regions. For prostate cancer, the mean deviation across regions was 1.78 when adjusting for age and sex only, but decreased to 1.27 after further adjustment for tumour stage. For breast cancer, the corresponding mean deviations were 1.34 and 1.27. Additional adjustment for other prognostic factors did not materially change the regional variation in any of the other sites. Adjustment for tumour stage explained most of the regional variations in prostate cancer survival, but had little impact for other sites. Unexplained regional variations after adjusting for tumour stage, SES indicators, comorbidity and type of treatment in Norway may be related to regional inequalities in the quality of cancer care.""","""['Katrine Damgaard Skyrud', 'Freddie Bray', 'Morten Tandberg Eriksen', 'Yngvar Nilssen', 'Bjørn Møller']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Aspects of survival from colorectal cancer in Denmark.', 'Socioeconomic deprivation and cancer survival in Germany: an ecological analysis in 200 districts in Germany.', 'Trends in the overall survival of cancer patients diagnosed 1964-2003 in the Nordic countries followed up to the end of 2006: the importance of case-mix.', 'Socioeconomic differences in cancer survival: a review of the evidence.', 'Prognostic factors in soft tissue sarcoma.', 'Is the Social Gradient in Net Survival Observed in France the Result of Inequalities in Cancer-Specific Mortality or Inequalities in General Mortality?', 'Exploring wait time variations in a prostate cancer patient pathway-A qualitative study.', 'Impact of Socioeconomic Status on Cancer Incidence Risk, Cancer Staging, and Survival of Patients with Colorectal Cancer under Universal Health Insurance Coverage in Taiwan.', 'Equitable access to cancer patient pathways in Norway - a national registry-based study.', 'Factors associated with emergency-related diagnosis, time to treatment and type of treatment in 5713 lung cancer patients.']"""

One possible reason for these null findings may be use of cumulative exposure measures that do not inform the timing of infection, i.e., childhood versus adolescence/early adulthood when infection is more likely to manifest as infectious mononucleosis (IM). We sought to determine the influence of young adult-onset IM on the prostate by measuring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a marker of prostate inflammation/damage among U.S. military members. We defined IM cases as men diagnosed with IM from 1998 to 2003 (n = 55) and controls as men without an IM diagnosis (n = 255). We selected two archived serum specimens for each participant, the first collected after diagnosis for cases and one randomly selected from 1998 to 2003 for controls (index), as well as the preceding specimen (preindex). PSA was measured in each specimen. To explore the specificity of our findings for prostate as opposed to systemic inflammation, we performed a post hoc comparison of other infectious disease cases without genitourinary involvement (n = 90) and controls (n = 220). We found that IM cases were more likely to have a large PSA rise than controls (≥ 20 ng/mL: 19.7% versus 8.8%, p = 0.027; ≥ 40% rise: 25.7% versus 9.4%, p = 0.0021), as were other infectious disease cases (25.7% versus 14.0%, p = 0.020; 27.7% versus 18.0%, p = 0.092).

Although this trend has been attributed partly to a more Western diet, this assumption may involve variable confounders. Thus, we examined the histological features of contemporary vs historical latent prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Prostate specimens from a consecutive autopsy series (127, present study, 2008 to 2013) were examined. Each prostate gland was fixed and sliced in step sections. The findings were compared to those from another autopsy series (501 subjects, 1983 to 1987) at our institution.  Results:   The mean age of subjects in the present study was 68.9 years while the mean age was not available from the earlier study. However, the mean age of the 566 entrants in the expanded database (1983 to 1989) was 63.5 years (p=0.0001). Prostate weight was significantly greater in the present study (p <0.0001). Latent prostate cancer was found more frequently in the present study than in the previous study (43.3% and 20.8%, respectively, p <0.0001). No distinct difference was seen in the proportion of tumor grade between the groups. An increasing trend of moderately to poorly differentiated tumors with advancing age was more evident in the present study. Index cancer volume was greater in the present study with 25.5% measuring 500 mm(3) or greater vs only 9.6% of cancers in the previous study (p=0.008).

Materials and methods:   Since 1995 the Göteborg randomized population based prostate cancer screening trial has invited men biennially for prostate specific antigen testing, until the upper age limit of 70 years. Men with a prostate specific antigen above the threshold of 2.5 ng/ml were recommended further evaluation including 10-core biopsy (sextant before 2009). The present study comprises 9,065 men born between 1930 and 1943 (1944 excluded due to different screening algorithm). Complete attendees were defined as men who accepted all screening invitations (maximum 3 to 9 invitations). The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was calculated using standard methods.  Results:   Of the 3,488 (38%) complete attendees 667 were diagnosed with prostate cancer (followup 1995 to June 30, 2014). At age 70 years there was no significant difference in prostate cancer risk among those who started screening at the age of 52 (9 screens), 55 (7 screens) or 60 (5 screens) years. However, the cumulative risk of prostate cancer diagnosis increased dramatically with age, and was 7.9% at age 60, 15% at age 65 and 21% at age 70 for men who had been screened 4 or more times.  Conclusions:   There was no clear association between risk of prostate cancer and the number of screens. Starting screening at an early age appears to advance the time of prostate cancer diagnosis but does not seem to increase the risk of being diagnosed with the disease.

We reviewed our experience with simultaneous robotic prostatectomy and mesh hernia repair to identify variables predictive of a hernia.  Materials and methods:   Our cohort consisted of 693 consecutive men who underwent robotic radical prostatectomy as performed by 1 surgeon. Hernias were repaired with mesh composed of equal parts of absorbable polyglecaprone-25 and nonabsorbable polypropylene monofilament. Preoperative variables potentially predictive of an inguinal hernia were evaluated.  Results:   Inguinal hernias were encountered in 55 of 639 patients (8.6%), of which 22.3% were bilateral for a total of 68 hernia sides. Only 26 of 55 hernias (47.2%) were evident preoperatively. Men with a preoperative I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) of 15 or greater had a 22.4% chance (30 of 134) of requiring a hernia repair compared with 5% in those without such a score (OR 5.54, 95% CI 3.13-9.81, p <0.0001). There were no differences between the hernia and nonhernia groups in prostate size, body mass index, age, blood loss, transfusions, operative time, length of stay or any Clavien grade II-V complication. In 47 patients there was 1 recurrence at a median followup of 27.9 months. There were no cases of mesh associated pain or erosion.  Conclusions:   Independent of prostate size, men with preoperative lower urinary tract dysfunction were at 5 times the risk of a hernia at robotic radical prostatectomy (22.4% vs 5%). Given that half of the hernias were subclinical, patients with an I-PSS of 15 or greater should be counseled about the potential need for hernia repair at robotic radical prostatectomy.""","""['Ricardo F Sánchez-Ortiz', 'Carolina Andrade-Geigel', 'Héctor López-Huertas', 'Ronald Cadillo-Chávez', 'Omar Soto-Avilés']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Inguinal Hernia Repair at the Time of Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Nonprosthetic Direct Inguinal Hernia Repair During Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Simultaneous Inguinal Hernia Repair with Monofilament Polypropylene Mesh during Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Single Institute Series.', 'Combined inguinal hernia repair with prosthetic mesh during transperitoneal robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a 4-year experience.', 'Minimally Invasive Hernia Repair in Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Impact of Pelvic Anatomical Changes Caused by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'A low subcutaneous fat mass is a risk factor for the development of inguinal hernia after radical prostatectomy.', 'Causative factors for de novo inguinal hernia after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Inguinal Hernia Repair at the Time of Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

All biopsies were performed by the same urologist, whereas a different urologist administered the visual analog pain scale. There were not any significant differences in age, prostate-specific antigen level, or prostate volume between the two groups.

Paraffin-embedded PCa specimens were immunohistochemically tested for GCNT2 expression, and the roles of GCNT2 in PCa progression were investigated using cell lines with high GCNT2 expression and low GCNT2 expression. GCNT2-positive cells were significantly lesser in organ-confined disease than in that with extra-capsular extensions, and GCNT2-negative tumors were associated with significantly better prostate-specific antigen-free survival compared with GCNT2-positive tumors. Subsequent functional studies revealed that knockdown of GCNT2 expression in PCa cell lines significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion. GCNT2 regulated the expression of cell surface I-antigen on the O-glycan and glycolipid.

Summary answer:   Spermatozoa from elderly men and young asthenozoospermia patients show decreased expression of PGK2, which has a close positive relationship with sperm quality.  What is known already:   PGK1 and PGK2 are involved in spermatogenesis and thought to be related to sperm motility. However, limited information is known about their temporal-spatial expression in human spermatogenesis and their relationship with sperm quality.  Study design, size, duration:   This was a case-control study including 30 healthy young males (aged 28-31 years), 30 elderly men (aged 68-70 years), and 30 asthenozoospermic patients (aged 25-40 years, progressive motility <32%) who donated semen samples. Furthermore, young testes samples were obtained from five fathers (27-33 years old) who had died in car accidents, while aged testes samples were obtained from five elderly fathers (78-82 years old) who were prostate cancer patients.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   Semen samples from young adults, elderly men and asthenozoospermic patients were prepared, and their parameters were assessed by Computer-Aided Sperm Analysis (CASA). Sperm proteins were extracted for western blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to characterize the cellular localization of PGK1 and PGK2 in testes samples. Sperm immunofluorescence quantification experiments identified the differential expression of PGK1 and PGK2 in sperm from young adults, elderly men and asthenozoospermic patients. Antibodies against PGK1 and PGK2 were used to test their influence on sperm motility and penetration into viscous media. A modified Kremer test using methyl cellulose was adopted to assess sperm function via penetration into viscous media.  Main results and the role of chance:   Cellular localization analysis showed that PGK1 was mainly expressed in spermatogonia whereas PGK2 was mainly expressed in round spermatids. Expression levels of both PGKs were significantly decreased in the testis with ageing (P < 0.05). Western blot and immunofluorescence quantification showed markedly lower expression of PGK2 (P < 0.05) in sperm from elderly men or asthenozoospermic patients compared sperm from with healthy young men. Sperm functional analysis validated the close relationship between expression of PGK2 and sperm motility (staining percentage, r = 0.60, P < 0.05; intensity, r = 0.59, P < 0.05). Use of an anti-PGK2 antibody on sperm significantly decreased their ability to penetrate into a cervical mucus substitute (P < 0.05).  Limitations, reasons for caution:   Before any clinical applications using PGK2 to assess sperm quality can be developed, more cases should be used to evaluate this approach.  Wider implications of the findings:   The study provides new insights into the role of PGKs in male reproduction. The results also indicate that PGK2 is a promising molecular candidate for the assessment of sperm quality and the screening of male contraceptive targets.

Interrogation of published data revealed that genes associated with NFIB binding sites are predominantly induced after dihydrotestosterone treatment of LNCaP cells, whereas NFIB knockdown studies demonstrated that loss of NFIB drives increased AR expression and superinduction of a subset of AR target genes. Notably, genes bound by NFIB only are associated with cell division and cell cycle. To define the role of NFIB in vivo, mouse Nfib knockout prostatic tissue was rescued via renal capsule engraftment. Loss of Nfib expression resulted in prostatic hyperplasia, which did not resolve in response to castration, and an expansion of an intermediate cell population in a small subset of grafts. In human benign prostatic hyperplasia, luminal NFIB loss correlated with more severe disease. Finally, some areas of intermediate cell expansion were also associated with NFIB loss. Taken together, these results show a fundamental role for NFIB as a coregulator of AR action in the prostate and in controlling prostatic hyperplasia.""","""['Magdalena M Grabowska', 'Stephen M Kelly', 'Amy L Reese', 'Justin M Cates', 'Tom C Case', 'Jianghong Zhang', 'David J DeGraff', 'Douglas W Strand', 'Nicole L Miller', 'Peter E Clark', 'Simon W Hayward', 'Richard M Gronostajski', 'Philip D Anderson', 'Robert J Matusik']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['NFI transcription factors interact with FOXA1 to regulate prostate-specific gene expression.', 'Increased nuclear factor I/B expression in prostate cancer correlates with AR expression.', 'FOXA1 modulates EAF2 regulation of AR transcriptional activity, cell proliferation, and migration in prostate cancer cells.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'FOXA1: a transcription factor with parallel functions in development and cancer.', 'Prediction of prostate cancer biochemical recurrence by using discretization supports the critical contribution of the extra-cellular matrix genes.', 'Glucocorticoids are induced while dihydrotestosterone levels are suppressed in 5-alpha reductase inhibitor treated human benign prostate hyperplasia patients.', 'Gene expression signatures of individual ductal carcinoma in situ lesions identify processes and biomarkers associated with progression towards invasive ductal carcinoma.', 'Hepatocyte-Specific Knock-Out of Nfib Aggravates Hepatocellular Tumorigenesis via Enhancing Urea Cycle.', 'Cistrome and transcriptome analysis identifies unique androgen receptor (AR) and AR-V7 splice variant chromatin binding and transcriptional activities.']"""

There are limited human data on whether sleep duration or disruption are risk factors for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We prospectively followed 32,141 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who reported their typical sleep duration in 1987, 2000, and 2008. We identified 4,261 incident prostate cancer cases, including 563 lethal cases through 2010. Sleep disruption was assessed in 2004 among 19,639 men, with 930 prostate cancer cases (50 lethal) identified from 2004 to 2010. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between sleep insufficiency and risk of overall and lethal prostate cancer.  Results:   In 1987, 2% of men reported sleeping ≤5 hours per night. We found no association between habitual sleep duration or change in sleep duration with the risk of advanced or lethal prostate cancer. We also found no association between waking up during the night, difficulty falling asleep, or waking up too early, and risk of prostate cancer. In 2004, 6% of men reported never feeling rested when they woke up; these men had an increased risk of developing lethal prostate cancer compared with those who reported always feeling rested when they woke up (RR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.15-8.10).

In quiescent cells, the interaction between WASF3 and a complex of proteins, including CYFIP1, acts as a conformational restraint to prevent WASF3 activation. Therefore, we took advantage of this endogenous regulatory mechanism to investigate potential sites that disrupt WASF3 function. Here, we show that genetic knockdown of CYFIP1 in cancer cells led to the destabilization of the WASF3 complex, loss of WASF3 function, and suppressed invasion. Based on existing crystallographic data, we developed stapled peptides, referred to as WASF Helix Mimics (WAHM), that target an α-helical interface between WASF3 and CYFIP1. Treatment of highly invasive breast and prostate cancer cells with WAHM inhibitor peptides significantly reduced motility and invasion in vitro. Mechanistic investigations revealed that these inhibitors suppressed the interaction between Rac and the WASF3 complex, which has been shown to promote cell migration. Furthermore, peptide-mediated inhibition of WASF3 also resulted in the dysregulation of known downstream targets such as MMP-9 and KISS1. Finally, we demonstrate that this invasive phenotype is specific to WASF3 as depletion of WASF1 and WASF2, which can also bind to CYFIP1, did not affect invasion. Collectively, our findings suggest that targeting WASF3 function with WAHM peptides could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing tumor invasion and metastasis.""","""['Yong Teng', 'Abdulaziz Bahassan', 'Dayong Dong', 'Laura E Hanold', 'Xiaoou Ren', 'Eileen J Kennedy', 'John K Cowell']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['The WASF3-NCKAP1-CYFIP1 Complex Is Essential for Breast Cancer Metastasis.', 'Targeting the WASF3 complex to suppress metastasis.', 'Suppression of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using Stapled Peptides Targeting the WASF Regulatory Complex.', 'Functional interrelationship between the WASF3 and KISS1 metastasis-associated genes in breast cancer cells.', 'Targeting WASF3 Signaling in Metastatic Cancer.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of m7G-Related Genes and Chronic Hepatitis B: Diagnostic Markers, Immune Microenvironment Regulation, Disease Progression.', 'Mitochondrial regulator ATAD3A: a molecular determinant favoring head and neck cancer development.', 'The WAVE3/β-catenin oncogenic signaling regulates chemoresistance in triple negative breast cancer.', 'The diverse functions of FAT1 in cancer progression: good, bad, or ugly?', 'WASP family proteins: Molecular mechanisms and implications in human disease.']"""

In the study, we attempted to investigate its putative oncogenic role on bladder cancer. Here, we report that SMYD3 frequently amplified in bladder cancer is correlated with bladder cancer progression and poor prognosis. Overexpression of SMYD3 promotes bladder cancer cell proliferation and invasion, whereas SMYD3 knockdown inhibits cancer cell growth and invasion. Mechanically, SMYD3 positively regulates the expression of BCL2-associated transcription factor 1 (BCLAF1). SMYD3 physically interacts with the promoter of BCLAF1 and upregulates its expression by accumulating di- and trimethylation of H3K4 at the BCLAF1 locus. We further show that SMYD3 overexpression in bladder cancer cells promotes autophagy activation, whereas BCLAF1 depletion inhibits SMYD3-induced autophagy. Finally, we demonstrate that SMYD3 promotes bladder cancer progression, at least in part by increasing BCLAF1 expression and activating autophagy.

Quercetin is a flavonoid compound that widely exists in the nature. Our previous study preliminarily demonstrated that quercetin effectively inhibited human prostate cancer cell xenograft tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is the first reported endogenous anti-angiogenic factor that can inhibit angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. However, the relationship between quercetin inhibiting angiogenesis and TSP-1 upregulation in prostate cancer has not been determined. Thus, we explored the important role of TSP-1 upregulation in reducing angiogenesis and anti-prostate cancer effect of quercetin both in vitro and in vivo for the first time. After the selected doses were used for a certain time, quercetin i) significantly inhibited PC-3 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation, migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner; ⅱ) effectively inhibited prostate cancer PC-3 cell xenograft tumor growth by 37.5% with 75 mg/kg as compared to vehicle control group, more effective than 25 (22.85%) and 50 mg/kg (29.6%); ⅲ) was well tolerated by BALB/c mice and no obvious toxic reactions were observed; ⅳ) greatly reduced angiogenesis and led to higher TSP-1 protein and mRNA expression both in vitro and in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, quercetin could increase TSP-1 expression to inhibit angiogenesis resulting in antagonizing prostate cancer PC-3 cell and xenograft tumor growth. The present study can lay a good basis for the subsequent concrete mechanism study and raise the possibility of applying quercetin to clinical for human prostate cancer in the near future.""","""['Feiya Yang', 'Xian Jiang', 'Liming Song', 'Huiping Wang', 'Zhu Mei', 'Zhiqing Xu', 'Nianzeng Xing']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Combination of Quercetin and 2-Methoxyestradiol Enhances Inhibition of Human Prostate Cancer LNCaP and PC-3 Cells Xenograft Tumor Growth.', 'Terrestrosin D, a steroidal saponin from Tribulus terrestris L., inhibits growth and angiogenesis of human prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'Calcitriol reduces thrombospondin-1 and increases vascular endothelial growth factor in breast cancer cells: implications for tumor angiogenesis.', 'The role of thrombospondin-1 in tumor progression.', 'Thrombospondins as anti-angiogenic therapeutic agents.', 'Network pharmacology and bioinformatics were used to construct a prognostic model and immunoassay of core target genes in the combination of quercetin and kaempferol in the treatment of colorectal cancer.', 'Nanoformulations of quercetin for controlled delivery: a review of preclinical anticancer studies.', 'The potential anti-cancer effects of quercetin on blood, prostate and lung cancers: An update.', 'Recent updates on anticancer mechanisms of polyphenols.', 'A Comprehensive Analysis and Anti-Cancer Activities of Quercetin in ROS-Mediated Cancer and Cancer Stem Cells.']"""

It results in an amino-acid change at codon 388 from glycine to arginine (p.Gly388Arg) in the transmembrane domain of the receptor. Despite compelling genetic evidence for the association of this common variant with cancers of the bone, breast, colon, prostate, skin, lung, head and neck, as well as soft-tissue sarcomas and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the underlying biological mechanism has remained elusive. Here we show that substitution of the conserved glycine 388 residue to a charged arginine residue alters the transmembrane spanning segment and exposes a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) binding site Y(390)-(P)XXQ(393). We demonstrate that such membrane-proximal STAT3 binding motifs in the germline of type I membrane receptors enhance STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation by recruiting STAT3 proteins to the inner cell membrane. Remarkably, such germline variants frequently co-localize with somatic mutations in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database.

Using dose planning-objectives derived from our previous biological-model validation study, the volume of the urethra receiving 125% of the conventional prescription (145 Gy) was reduced from a median value of 64% to less than 8% whilst maintaining high values of TCP. On average, the number of planned seeds was reduced from 85 to less than 75. The robustness of plans to random seed displacements needs to be carefully considered when using contemporary seed placement techniques.

The analysis of the differential expression of miRNAs in exosomes allows evaluating the differential biological effect of both populations on the niche, and the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Five PCa primary cell cultures were established to originate bulk and CSCs cultures. From them, exosomes were purified by precipitation for miRNAs extraction to perform a comparative profile of miRNAs by next generation sequencing in an Illumina platform. 1839 miRNAs were identified in the exosomes. Of these 990 were known miRNAs, from which only 19 were significantly differentially expressed: 6 were overexpressed in CSCs and 13 in bulk cells exosomes. miR-100-5p and miR-21-5p were the most abundant miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that differentially expressed miRNAs are highly related with PCa carcinogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and migration, and angiogenesis. Besides, miRNAs from bulk cells affects osteoblast differentiation. Later, their effect was evaluated in normal prostate fibroblasts (WPMY-1) where transfection with miR-100-5p, miR-21-5p and miR-139-5p increased the expression of metalloproteinases (MMPs) -2, -9 and -13 and RANKL and fibroblast migration.

The HT plans were converted to sIMRT plans. 3DCRT, sliding window IMRT (dIMRT) and VMAT plans for a c-arm linear accelerator (CLA) were created manually. The doses in planning target volume (PTV), bladder, rectum, bowels, femoral heads and hip prosthesis were compared using: (i) a qualitative analysis of doses in averaged dose-volume histograms, (ii) a quantitative, ranking procedure performed for each patient separately, and (iii) statistical testing based on the Friedman ANOVA and Nemenyi method.  Results:   For the bladder, rectum, and femoral head, the best dose distributions were observed for HT and sIMRT and then for dIMRT, VMAT, and finally for 3DCRT (p-values were, respectively, 0.002, 0.004 and p = 0.024).

We previously reported that human cultured fibrosarcoma (HT 1080) cells secrete cathepsin L into the medium; this secreted cathepsin is 10-times more active than intracellular cathepsin. This increased activity was attributed to the presence of a 32-kDa cathepsin L in the medium. The aim of this study was to examine how this active 32-kDa cathepsin L is secreted into the medium. To this end, we compared the secreted active 32-kDa cathepsin L with lysosomal cathepsin L by using a novel gelatin zymography technique that employs leupeptin. We also examined the glycosylation and phosphorylation status of the proteins by using the enzymes endoglycosidase H [EC 3.2.1.96] and alkaline phosphatase [EC 3.1.3.1]. Strong active bands corresponding to the 32-kDa and 34-kDa cathepsin L forms were detected in the medium and lysosomes, respectively. The cell extract exhibited strong active bands for both forms. Moreover, both forms were adsorbed onto a concanavalin A-agarose column. The core protein domain of both forms had the same molecular mass of 30 kDa. The 32-kDa cathepsin L was phosphorylated, while the 34-kDa lysosomal form was dephosphorylated, perhaps because of the lysosomal marker enzyme, acid phosphatase. These results suggest that the active 32-kDa form does not enter the lysosomes. In conclusion, our results indicate that the active 32-kDa cathepsin L is secreted directly from the HT 1080 cells and not via lysosomal exocytosis.""","""['Yoko Hashimoto', 'Chihiro Kondo', 'Nobuhiko Katunuma']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Gelatin Zymography Using Leupeptin for the Detection of Various Cathepsin L Forms.', 'Significance of 32-kDa cathepsin L secreted from cancer cells.', 'Exocytosis of active cathepsin B enzyme activity at pH 7.0, inhibition and molecular mass.', 'Biosynthesis, processing, and lysosome targeting of acid phosphatase.', 'Destroy the old to build the new: Activity-dependent lysosomal exocytosis in neurons.', 'Enzymes in the time of COVID-19: An overview about the effects in the human body, enzyme market, and perspectives for new drugs.', 'Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer: a lysosomal protease perspective.', 'Cysteine Proteases and Mitochondrial Instability: A Possible Vicious Cycle in MS Myelin?', 'The Ins and Outs of Cathepsins: Physiological Function and Role in Disease Management.', 'A Review of Small Molecule Inhibitors and Functional Probes of Human Cathepsin L.']"""

Materials and methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 49 consecutive men with Gleason 6 prostate cancer who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and again more than 6 months later, each followed by a targeted prostate biopsy, between January 2011 and May 2015. We evaluated whether progression on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (an increase in index lesion suspicion score, increase in index lesion volume or decrease in index lesion apparent diffusion coefficient) could predict pathological progression (Gleason 3 + 4 or greater on subsequent biopsy, in systematic or targeted cores). Diagnostic performance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was determined with and without clinical data using a binary logistic regression model.  Results:   The mean interval between baseline and followup multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was 28.3 months (range 11 to 43). Pathological progression occurred in 19 patients (39%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was 37%, 90%, 69% and 70%, respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.63. A logistic regression model using clinical information (maximum cancer core length greater than 3 mm on baseline biopsy or a prostate specific antigen density greater than 0.15 ng/ml(2) at followup biopsy) had an AUC of 0.87 for predicting pathological progression. The addition of serial multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging data significantly improved the AUC to 0.91 (p=0.044).

It is generally believed that natural killer cells are the key component of the innate immune system in determining tumor metastatic potential in xenograft models. However, recent studies suggest that macrophages may play an important role, as resident macrophages can eliminate the invading tumor cells if they do not express adequate levels of the CD47 molecule.  Methods:   We investigated the effect of overexpressing murine CD47 (mCD47) in PC-3 cells, a commonly used human prostate cancer line, on the metastatic potential in three mouse strains with different genetic background and varying degrees of immunodeficiency. We implanted the tumor cells either subcutaneously or orthotopically and then examined their local and distant metastases.  Results:   Our results show that mCD47-expressing PC-3 cells subcutaneously implanted in NSG and CB17. Scid mice metastasized to the sentinel lymph node, lung and liver significantly more efficiently than the control cells. When implanted orthotopically to NOD. Scid mice, these cells spontaneously metastasized to lung and liver.

Methods:   Sixty-eight men undergoing ADT for prostate cancer attended an assessment interview, completed questionnaires (assessing HFNS frequency and problem-rating, mood, stress, optimism, somatosensory amplification, HFNS beliefs/behaviors) and wore an ambulatory sternal skin conductance (SSC) monitor for 48 h.  Results:   The sample had a mean age of 69.76 (standard deviation, SD = 8.04) years, were on average 27.24 (SD = 28.53) months since cancer diagnosis and had been on their current ADT regime for 16 months (range 2-74 months). The men reported frequent (weekly mean 51.04, SD = 33.21) and moderately problematic HFNS. Overall, 294 (20%) of the SSC-defined HFNS were concordant with prospective frequency (event marker), while 63% were under-reported and 17% were over-reported, under-reporting being more common than over-reporting. There were no significant predictors of HFNS frequency (subjective or physiological measures), but psychological variables (HFNS beliefs and behaviors (β = 0.56, p < 0.03), anxiety (β = 0.24, p < 0.01) and somatic amplification (β = 0.76, p < 0.04) were the main predictors of problematic HFNS, i.e. troublesome symptoms.

Enrichment-based next generation sequencing methods such as MBD-isolated genome sequencing (MiGS) and MeDIP-seq are appealing for studying DNA methylation genome-wide in order to distinguish between biological subtypes. However, current analytic tools do not provide optimal features for analyzing three-group or larger study designs. MethylAction addresses this need by detecting all possible patterns of statistically significant hyper- and hypo- methylation in comparisons involving any number of groups. Crucially, significance is established at the level of differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and bootstrapping determines false discovery rates (FDRs) associated with each pattern. We demonstrate this functionality in a four-group comparison among benign prostate and three clinical subtypes of prostate cancer and show that the bootstrap FDRs are highly useful in selecting the most robust patterns of DMRs. Compared to existing tools that are limited to two-group comparisons, MethylAction detects more DMRs with strong differential methylation measurements confirmed by whole genome bisulfite sequencing and offers a better balance between precision and recall in cross-cohort comparisons.

As metastatic tumor biopsies are not always feasible and are difficult to repeat, we sought to evaluate noninvasive methods to identify patients transitioning toward a neuroendocrine phenotype (NEPC).  Experimental design:   We prospectively studied a metastatic tumor biopsy, serum biomarkers, and circulating tumor cells (CTC, Epic Sciences) from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) including those with pure or mixed NEPC histology present on biopsy. CTCs labeled with the patient's clinical status were used to learn features that discriminate NEPC patients, which was then applied to an independent cohort.  Results:   Twenty-seven patients with CRPC including 12 NEPC and 5 with atypical clinical features suggestive of NEPC transition were studied. CTCs from NEPC patients demonstrated frequent clusters, low or absent AR expression, lower cytokeratin expression, and smaller morphology relative to typical CRPC. A multivariate analysis of protein and morphologic variables enabled distinguishing CTCs of NEPC from CRPC. This CTC classifier was applied to an independent prospective cohort of 159 metastatic CRPC patients and identified in 17/159 (10.7%) of cases, enriched in patients with high CTC burden (P < 0.01) and visceral metastases (P = 0.04).  Conclusions:   CTCs from patients with NEPC have unique morphologic characteristics, which were also identified in a subset of CRPC patients with aggressive clinical features potentially undergoing NEPC transition.""","""['Himisha Beltran', 'Adam Jendrisak', 'Mark Landers', 'Juan Miguel Mosquera', 'Myriam Kossai', 'Jessica Louw', 'Rachel Krupa', 'Ryon P Graf', 'Nicole A Schreiber', 'David M Nanus', 'Scott T Tagawa', 'Dena Marrinucci', 'Ryan Dittamore', 'Howard I Scher']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Re: The Initial Detection and Partial Characterization of Circulating Tumor Cells in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of Novel Diagnosis Biomarkers for Therapy-Related Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Anterior gradient 2 (AGR2): blood-based biomarker elevated in metastatic prostate cancer associated with the neuroendocrine phenotype.', 'Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of tumor tissue and circulating tumor cells in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A report from the PETRUS prospective study.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer: novel morphological insights and future therapeutic perspectives.', 'Neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Small-Cell Carcinoma of the Prostate - Challenges of Diagnosis and Treatment: A Next of Kin and Physician Perspective Piece.', 'Perioperative change of circulating tumor cells in cytoreductive radical prostatectomy for oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: the preliminary safety evidence from long-term oncologic outcomes.', 'A Theranostic Small-Molecule Prodrug Conjugate for Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'A clinical-grade liquid biomarker detects neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'Liquid biopsy-based targeted gene screening highlights tumor cell subtypes in patients with advanced prostate cancer.']"""

The primary aim of our study was to explore resistance mechanisms in the advanced type of prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and to clarify the role of autophagy in these processes. We performed time-lapse experiment (48 hours) with ROS generating plumbagin by using multimodal holographic microscope. Furthermore, we also performed the flow-cytometric analysis and the qRT-PCR gene expression analysis at 12 selected time points. TEM and confocal microscopy were used to verify the results. We found out that autophagy (namely mitophagy) is an important resistance mechanism. The major ROS producing mitochondria were coated by an autophagic membrane derived from endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. According to our results, increasing ROS resistance may be also accompanied by increased average cell size and polyploidization, which seems to be key resistance mechanism when connected with an escape from senescence. Many different types of cell-cell interactions were recorded including entosis, vesicular transfer, eating of dead or dying cells, and engulfment and cannibalism of living cells. Entosis was disclosed as a possible mechanism of polyploidization and enabled the long-term survival of cancer cells. Significantly reduced cell motility was found after the plumbagin treatment. We also found an extensive induction of pluripotency genes expression (NANOG, SOX2, and POU5F1) at the time-point of 20 hours. We suppose, that overexpression of pluripotency genes in the portion of prostate tumour cell population exposed to ROS leads to higher developmental plasticity and capability to faster respond to changes in the extracellular environment that could ultimately lead to an alteration of cell fate.""","""['Jan Balvan', 'Jaromir Gumulec', 'Martina Raudenska', 'Aneta Krizova', 'Petr Stepka', 'Petr Babula', 'Rene Kizek', 'Vojtech Adam', 'Michal Masarik']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cell type-dependent ROS and mitophagy response leads to apoptosis or necroptosis in neuroblastoma.', 'Plumbagin-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells is associated with modulation of cellular redox status and generation of reactive oxygen species.', 'Salinomycin induced ROS results in abortive autophagy and leads to regulated necrosis in glioblastoma.', 'Reactive oxygen species regulation of autophagy in cancer: implications for cancer treatment.', 'Mechanisms and consequences of entosis.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Addressing cancer invasion and cell motility with quantitative light microscopy.', 'Ruthenium (II)/allopurinol complex inhibits breast cancer progression via multiple targets.', 'Impact of Androgen Deprivation on Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Status in Nigerian Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy.']"""

Recent studies have shown that Ang-(1-7) has an antiproliferative action on lung adenocarcinoma cells and prostate cancer cells. In this study, we report that MasR levels were significantly upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) specimens and NPC cell lines. Viral vector-mediated expression of Ang-(1-7) dramatically suppressed NPC cell proliferation and migration in vitro. These effects were completely blocked by the specific Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist A-779, suggesting that they are mediated by the Ang-(1-7) receptor Mas. In this study, Ang-(1-7) not only caused a significant reduction in the growth of human nasopharyngeal xenografts, but also markedly decreased vessel density, suggesting that the heptapeptide inhibits angiogenesis to reduce tumor size. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Ang-(1-7) inhibited the expression of the proangiogenic factors VEGF and PlGF. Taken together, the data suggest that upregulation of MasR could be used as a diagnostic marker of NPC and Ang-(1-7) may be a novel therapeutic agent for nasopharyngeal cancer therapy because it exerts significant antiangiogenic activity.""","""['Nana Pei', 'Renqiang Wan', 'Xinglu Chen', 'Andrew Li', 'Yanling Zhang', 'Jinlong Li', 'Hongyan Du', 'Baihong Chen', 'Wenjin Wei', 'Yanfei Qi', 'Yi Zhang', 'Michael J Katovich', 'Colin Sumners', 'Haifa Zheng', 'Hongwei Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Pre-treatment with angiotensin-(1-7) inhibits tumor growth via autophagy by downregulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma xenografts.', 'Angiotensin-(1-7) inhibits tumor angiogenesis in human lung cancer xenografts with a reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor.', 'Angiotensin-(1-7) reduces proliferation and angiogenesis of human prostate cancer xenografts with a decrease in angiogenic factors and an increase in sFlt-1.', 'Combination of pigment epithelium-derived factor with radiotherapy enhances the antitumor effects on nasopharyngeal carcinoma by downregulating vascular endothelial growth factor expression and angiogenesis.', 'Angiotensin-(1-7) inhibits the migration and invasion of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells through inactivation of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways.', 'Treatment with Angiotensin-(1-7) Prevents Development of Oral Papilloma Induced in K-ras Transgenic Mice.', 'Comprehensive Proteomic Analysis of Colon Cancer Tissue Revealed the Reason for the Worse Prognosis of Right-Sided Colon Cancer and Mucinous Colon Cancer at the Protein Level.', 'Involvement of the Renin-Angiotensin System in Stress: State of the Art and Research Perspectives.', 'Angiotensin II and Angiotensin Receptors 1 and 2-Multifunctional System in Cells Biology, What Do We Know?', 'Induced dysregulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in COVID-19 severity.']"""

The incidence of prostate and lung cancers increases yearly; these cancers readily invade the bone. Some recent studies have found that serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels may be altered in patients with bone metastasis, whereas other reports have produced inconsistent findings. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effects of lung and prostate cancer on serum OPG levels. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Medline, and CNKI to identify relevant studies. A total of 11 studies were included. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the bone metastasis (BM) group, the non-bone metastasis (BM-) group and healthy controls were calculated. In prostate cancer, serum OPG levels in the BM group were higher than in the BM- group and healthy controls. Additionally, no significant difference in serum OPG levels was found between the BM- group and healthy controls. In lung cancer, serum OPG levels in the BM and BM- groups were significantly increased compared with healthy controls. However, no significant difference in serum OPG levels was found between the BM and BM- groups.

Methods:   Logistic regression models were used to test the evidence for association between the 23 new variants and early-onset prostate cancer. Weighted and unweighted sums of total risk alleles across these 23 variants and 40 established variants were constructed. Weights were based on previously reported effect size estimates. Receiver operating characteristic curves and forest plots, using defined cut-points, were constructed to assess the predictive value of the burden of risk alleles on early-onset disease.  Results:   Ten of the 23 new variants demonstrated evidence (P < 0.05) for association with early-onset prostate cancer, including four that were significant after multiple test correction. The aggregate burden of risk alleles across the 63 variants was predictive of early-onset prostate cancer (AUC = 0.71 using weighted sums), especially in men with a high burden of total risk alleles.  Conclusions:   A high burden of risk alleles is strongly associated with early-onset prostate cancer.  Impact:   Our results provide the first formal replication for several of these 23 new variants and demonstrate that a high burden of common-variant risk alleles is a major risk factor for early-onset prostate cancer.

For this report, the authors characterized the VA's provision of concurrent care, defined as days in the last 6 months of life during which veterans simultaneously received hospice services and chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  Methods:   This retrospective cohort study included veteran decedents with cancer during 2006 through 2012 who were identified from claims with cancer diagnoses. Hospice and cancer treatment were identified using VA and Medicare administrative data. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the changes in concurrent care, hospice, palliative care, and chemotherapy or radiation treatment.  Results:   The proportion of veterans receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy remained stable at approximately 45%, whereas the proportion of veterans who received hospice increased from 55% to 68%. The receipt of concurrent care also increased during this time from 16.2% to 24.5%. The median time between hospice initiation and death remained stable at around 21 days. Among veterans who received chemotherapy or radiation therapy in their last 6 months of life, the median time between treatment termination and death ranged from 35 to 40 days. There was considerable variation between VA medical centers in the use of concurrent care (interquartile range, 16%-34% in 2012).  Conclusions:   Concurrent receipt of hospice and chemotherapy or radiation therapy increased among veterans dying from cancer without reductions in the receipt of cancer therapy. This approach reflects the expansion of hospice services in the VA with VA policy allowing the concurrent receipt of hospice and antineoplastic therapies.

Methods:   We explored TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement status in 132 patients with PCa with four detection methods including fluorescence in situ hybridisation for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) for ERG and TMPRSS-ERG fusion transcript mRNA and IHC for ERG.  Results:   Concordant results were found in 126 cases for the four detection methods and the remaining six cases showed discrepancy in one method: two cases in IHC, three cases in RT-qPCR for ERG and one case in RT-qPCR for fusion transcript. In discordant cases, the majority results were determined as final fusion status. Analysis of discrepancy cases for ERG IHC showed that weak immunoreactivity for ERG should be regarded as equivocal and that even strong immunoreactivity can be false positive.

Myo10 knockdown ablated filopodia and decreased 2D migration speed. Myo18a knockdown increased circumferential non-muscle myosin 2A-associated actin filament arrays in the lamella and reduced directional persistence of 2D migration. Myo9b knockdown increased stress fiber formation, decreased 2D migration speed, and increased directional persistence. Conversely, Myo1b knockdown increased numbers of stress fibers but did not affect 2D migration. In all cases, the cell spread area was increased and 3D migration potential was decreased.

However, its function in prostate cancer (PCa) has been rarely reported. It was found in this study that GPR137 was upregulated in PCa tissues as compared with that in paracancerous tissues. To see whether GPR137 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for PCa, GPR137 was knocked down to verify its biological function in PCa cells. Lentivirus-introduced short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was designed to silence GPR137 gene. It was found that silencing of GPR137 gene suppressed the proliferation and colony formation of PCa cell lines PC-3 and DU145. Further study indicated that growth inhibition by GPR137 knockdown was associated with cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, silencing of GPR137 repressed the invasion and migration abilities of PC-3 cells via downregulating slug and snail and upregulating E-cadherin.

The 2013 Movember campaigns in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom shared the same goal of creating conversations about men's health that lead to increased awareness and understanding of the health risks men face. Our objective was to explore Twitter conversations to identify whether the 2013 Movember campaigns sparked global conversations about prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and other men's health issues. We conducted a content analysis of 12,666 tweets posted during the 2013 Movember campaigns in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom (4,222 tweets from each country) to investigate whether tweets were health-related or non-health-related and to determine what topics dominated conversations. Few tweets ( n = 84, 0.7% of 12,666 tweets) provided content-rich or actionable health information that would lead to awareness and understanding of men's health risks. While moustache growing and grooming was the most popular topic in U.S. tweets, conversations about community engagement were most common in Canadian and U.K. tweets. Significantly more tweets co-opted the Movember campaign to market products or contests in the United States than Canada and the United Kingdom ( p < .05).

Methods:   A prospective analysis was conducted in patients with localized PCa with MRI of the prostate before radical prostatectomy. MRI and pathology findings were independently reviewed and reported based on a standardized map of the prostate with 16 regions of interest (ROIs). Diagnostic accuracy analysis of the MRI was performed using varying prostate-subpart sizes and varying cutoffs for the radiological probability for PCa presence.  Results:   Seventy four patients were included. Using varying cutoff probabilities and varying sizes of prostate-subparts resulted in a broad range of sensitivity (6-88%) and specificity (38-100%). Lower probabilities of PCa presence and larger prostate-subparts resulted in higher sensitivity but lower specificity and vice versa. Best diagnostic performance was achieved by using prostate sextants and at least moderate probabilities for PCa presence; mean sensitivity and specificity were 38% (95% CI 13-75) and 95% (95% CI 88-98).  Conclusion:   The use of varying assessment parameters strongly affects the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in the local staging of PCa.

Meanwhile, 5 μM T2A successfully triggered the autophagy of PC-3 cells, indicated by increased expression of Beclin1, and LC3 II. Validation experiments were conducted to further consolidate T2A's contribution to autophagy: Pretreatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) provided protection against autophagy and enhanced T2A-induced apoptosis. Besides, the apoptosis suppressor z-VAD-fmk failed to facilitate the formation of autophagic vacuoles, which also proved the T2A-induced autophagy independent of apoptosis. Moreover, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) efficiently inhibited the expression of Beclin1, LC3-II, and cleaved caspase-3, which indicated apoptosis and autophagy with dependence on intracellular ROS production.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare patients stably working with patients no longer working.  Results:   There were 668 metastatic working-age participants in the analysis: 236 (35%) worked full- or part-time, whereas 302 (45%) had stopped working because of illness. Overall, 58% reported some change in employment due to illness. A better performance status and non-Hispanic white ethnicity/race were significantly associated with continuing to work despite a metastatic cancer diagnosis in the multivariate analysis. The disease type, time since metastatic diagnosis, number of metastatic sites, location of metastatic disease, and treatment status had no significant impact.

However, the potential effect of natural OA on human prostate cancer is still unclear. The present study aimed to explore whether and how OA exerted anti-cancer effects in prostate cancer. Our data showed that OA inhibited cell viability and proliferation, and promoted cell apoptosis and G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP cells, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, OA was found to regulate the expression levels of apoptosis-related and cell cycle-related proteins, as well as the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway, in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, our data revealed that OA exerted anti-cancer effects in vitro in PC-3 and DU145 cells by repressing the PI3K/Akt pathway. In agreement, OA also suppressed the tumor growth of PC-3 cells in vivo via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

Methods:   A decision-analytic model was designed to compare the outcomes of TRUSBx performed with (rectal culture-guided group) and without (standard ciprofloxacin prophylaxis) rectal swab culture-guided antimicrobial prophylaxis in Hong Kong. The post-biopsy infection rate, infection-related costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost for infection, and incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER) were assessed. Model inputs were retrieved from local epidemiology data and the medical literature. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the model results.  Results:   Base-case analysis showed that the infection rate in the culture-guided group was reduced from 2.42% to 0.23% and saved 0.0002 QALYs, with a lower cost (USD 31.4 versus USD 55.6) (USD 1=HKD 7.8). The number needed to screen to prevent an infection episode was 45.7. The hospital days avoided per 100 patients using culture-guided prophylaxis was 7.08 days. The relative effectiveness of culture-guided antimicrobial prophylaxis versus standard prophylaxis in carriers and non-carriers of FQ-resistant rectal flora were identified as potential influencing factors. In 10000 Monte Carlo simulations, ICERs of the culture-guided group were below the willingness-to-pay threshold 99.12% of the time.

Objective:   This study aimed to collect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) data in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stratified by disease states.  Methods:   Men with metastatic CRPC were recruited via UK patient associations, patient panels, and specialist recruiters and classified into four subgroups reflecting disease state: asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic before chemotherapy, symptomatic before chemotherapy, receiving chemotherapy, and postchemotherapy. HRQOL data (including five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L], European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30], and 25-item prostate cancer-specific questionnaire module designed to supplement the EORTC QLQ-C30) along with background and medical history data were collected via an online survey. The EQ-5D-5L and the EORTC-8D (EORTC-8D is an 8 dimensional utility index scored from QLQ-C30 data) were both used to estimate utilities.  Results:   Data were collected from a total sample of 163 men with metastatic CRPC. Utility values elicited by the EQ-5D-5L ranged from 0.830 for the asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic before chemotherapy disease state (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.795-0.865) to 0.625 for the symptomatic before chemotherapy disease state (95% CI 0.577-0.673).

Sexual health was evaluated using six items from the Relationship and Sexuality Scale, and an overall indicator was created.  Results:   Among the study's 1955 sexually active participants, 18.6 % (versus 13.1 %), 39.8 % (versus 39.9 %) and 29.4 % (versus 29.8 %) of men (versus women) were affected, respectively, by ""strong"", ""moderate"" and ""weak"" sexual health deterioration, while 12.2 % (versus 17.1 %) were spared sexual problems (P = 0.001). Strong deterioration more often concerned older men with prostate (27.7 %) and lung (26.1 %) cancers, younger men with upper aero-digestive tract cancers (25.2 %) and women (younger/older) with cervical cancer (24.2 %). Substantial (strong/moderate) sexual health deterioration was observed for all cancer sites, rates ranging from 68.3 % (prostate) to 37.2 % (melanoma). In all four gender/age subgroups, increasing age predicted poorer sexual health, although statistical significance was not reached in older women. Apart from genital cancer, perceived consequences, such as general sequelae and fatigue, were the primary factors associated with severe sexual problems.  Conclusions:   Two years after diagnosis, the majority of sexually active French cancer survivors reported impaired sexual health.

The main challenges for accurate MR prostate localization lie in two aspects: (1) inhomogeneous and inconsistent appearance around prostate boundary, and (2) the large shape variation across different patients. To tackle these two problems, we propose a new deformable MR prostate segmentation method by unifying deep feature learning with the sparse patch matching. First, instead of directly using handcrafted features, we propose to learn the latent feature representation from prostate MR images by the stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE). Since the deep learning algorithm learns the feature hierarchy from the data, the learned features are often more concise and effective than the handcrafted features in describing the underlying data. To improve the discriminability of learned features, we further refine the feature representation in a supervised fashion. Second, based on the learned features, a sparse patch matching method is proposed to infer a prostate likelihood map by transferring the prostate labels from multiple atlases to the new prostate MR image. Finally, a deformable segmentation is used to integrate a sparse shape model with the prostate likelihood map for achieving the final segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the dataset that contains 66 T2-wighted prostate MR images. Experimental results show that the deep-learned features are more effective than the handcrafted features in guiding MR prostate segmentation. Moreover, our method shows superior performance than other state-of-the-art segmentation methods.""","""['Yanrong Guo', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Deformable segmentation of 3D MR prostate images via distributed discriminative dictionary and ensemble learning.', 'Segmenting hippocampus from infant brains by sparse patch matching with deep-learned features.', 'Automatic prostate MR image segmentation with sparse label propagation and domain-specific manifold regularization.', 'Deep Learning for Brain MRI Segmentation: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'A Review on Deep Learning Architecture and Methods for MRI Brain Tumour Segmentation.', 'Deep learning for the screening of primary ciliary dyskinesia based on cranial computed tomography.', 'A Comparative Study of Automated Deep Learning Segmentation Models for Prostate MRI.', 'A Comprehensive Review on Smart Health Care: Applications, Paradigms, and Challenges with Case Studies.', 'Segmentation of the prostate, its zones, anterior fibromuscular stroma, and urethra on the MRIs and multimodality image fusion using U-Net model.', 'CVD-HNet: Classifying Pneumonia and COVID-19 in Chest X-ray Images Using Deep Network.']"""

Data were validated using an independent, external, population-based cohort.  Results:   Six risk factors individually associated with poor prognosis were included in the final model: lactate dehydrogenase > upper limit of normal (ULN) [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.31], Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 (HR = 2.19), presence of liver metastases (HR = 2.00), albumin ≤4 g/dl (HR = 1.54), alkaline phosphatase > ULN (HR = 1.38) and time from start of initial androgen-deprivation therapy to start of treatment ≤36 months (HR = 1.30).

This study aimed to assess the relationship between alternative digit ratios, racial demographics, and clinical/pathologic parameters associated with PCa.  Materials and methods:   Digital finger length measurements were made from scanned images of hands from patients with PCa.

Demographic and clinical parameters were analyzed with respect to various alternative finger length ratios.  Results:   Hand measurements were obtained in 354 white and 98 African-American patients with PCa.

Inhibition of Trx with the chemical inhibitor PX-12 suppresses tumor growth and induces cell apoptosis. Currently, the mechanism underlying the therapeutic actions of PX-12 and the molecules influencing cell susceptibility to PX-12 are incompletely understood. Given that connexin43 (Cx43), a tumor suppressor, regulates tumor cell susceptibility to chemotherapy, we examined the possible involvement of Cx43 in PX-12-induced cell death. Exposure of cells to PX-12 led to a loss of cell viability, which was associated with the activation of oxidative sensitive c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of JNK or supplement of cells with anti-oxidants prevented the cell-killing action of PX-12. The forced expression of Cx43 in normal and tumor cells increased cell sensitivity to PX-12-induced JNK activation and cell death. In contrast, the downregulation of Cx43 with siRNA or the suppression of gap junctions with chemical inhibitors attenuated JNK activation and enhanced cell resistance to PX-12. Further analysis revealed that PX-12 at low concentrations induced a JNK-dependent elevation in the Cx43 protein, which was also preventable by supplementing the cells with anti-oxidants. Our results thus indicate that Cx43 is a determinant in the regulation of cell susceptibility to PX-12 and that the upregulation of Cx43 may be an additional mechanism by which PX-12 exerts its anti-tumor actions.""","""['Gang Li', 'Kun Gao', 'Yuan Chi', 'Xiling Zhang', 'Takahiko Mitsui', 'Jian Yao', 'Masayuki Takeda']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Glycyrrhetinic Acid Protects Renal Tubular Cells against Oxidative Injury via Reciprocal Regulation of JNK-Connexin 43-Thioredoxin 1 Signaling.', 'PX-12 induces apoptosis in Calu-6 cells in an oxidative stress-dependent manner.', 'c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation mediates downregulation of connexin43 in cardiomyocytes.', 'Activation of endothelial cells to pathological status by down-regulation of connexin43.', 'Connexin43 hemichannels contributes to the disassembly of cell junctions through modulation of intracellular oxidative status.', 'Cardiovascular Toxicity Induced by Chronic Vincristine Treatment.', 'Glycyrrhetinic Acid Protects Renal Tubular Cells against Oxidative Injury via Reciprocal Regulation of JNK-Connexin 43-Thioredoxin 1 Signaling.', 'Gap junctions amplify TRPV4 activation-initiated cell injury via modification of intracellular Ca2+ and Ca2+-dependent regulation of TXNIP.']"""

A breakdown of these data to the level of tumor foci revealed 6q deletions in 138 tumor foci that were large enough to have at least 3 analyzable TMA spots. These included 42 tumor foci with homogeneous ERG positivity and 16 with homogeneous 6q15 deletions. Remarkably, six of the 42 homogeneously ERG-positive tumor foci (14.3%) harbored small 6q15-deleted areas, but none of the 34 6q15-deleted foci showed areas of ERG positivity (p = 0.022). In conclusion, our data suggest that ERG-fusion can precede 6q15 deletion, but not vice versa. The complete absence of ERG-positive tumor areas in 6q15-deleted tumor foci further suggest that the functional consequences of 6q15 deletions may prevent the development of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions.""","""['Martina Kluth', 'David Meyer', 'Antje Krohn', 'Fabian Freudenthaler', 'Melanie Bauer', 'Georg Salomon', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Uwe Michl', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Ronald Simon', 'Guido Sauter', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Sarah Minner']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Genomic deletion of MAP3K7 at 6q12-22 is associated with early PSA recurrence in prostate cancer and absence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions.', '5q21 deletion is often heterogeneous in prostate cancer.', 'Heterogeneity and chronology of PTEN deletion and ERG fusion in prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG fusions are strongly linked to young patient age in low-grade prostate cancer.', 'Current State of ERG as Biomarker in Prostatic Adenocarcinoma.', 'High Homogeneity of Mesothelin Expression in Primary and Metastatic Ovarian Cancer.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Opposing prognostic relevance of junction plakoglobin in distinct prostate cancer patient subsets.', 'Deletion of 3p13 is a late event linked to progression of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion prostate cancer.']"""

Lists of differentially expressed genes between malignant and non-malignant states are thought to be fertile sources of putative prostate cancer biomarkers. However such lists of differentially expressed genes can be highly variable for multiple reasons. As such, looking at differential expression in the context of gene sets and pathways has been more robust. Using next-generation genome sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, differential gene expression between age- and stage- matched human prostate tumors and non-malignant samples was assessed and used to craft a pathway signature of prostate cancer. Up- and down-regulated genes were assigned to pathways composed of curated groups of related genes from multiple databases. The significance of these pathways was then evaluated according to the number of differentially expressed genes found in the pathway and their position within the pathway using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis. The ""transforming growth factor-beta signaling"" and ""Ran regulation of mitotic spindle formation"" pathways were strongly associated with prostate cancer. Several other significant pathways confirm reported findings from microarray data that suggest actin cytoskeleton regulation, cell cycle, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and calcium signaling are also altered in prostate cancer.

Now it is a challenge to identify patients at higher risk for relapse and progression after surgery, and more novel prognostic biomarkers are needed. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of protocadherin17 (PCDH17) methylation in serum and its predictive value for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated the methylation status of PCDH17 in serum samples of 167 early-stage prostate cancer patients and 44 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and then evaluated the relationship between PCDH17 methylation and clinicopathologic features. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox analysis were used to evaluate its predictive value for BCR. RESULTS The ratio of PCDH17 methylation in prostate cancer patients was higher than in patients with BPH. Moreover, PCDH17 methylation was significantly associated with advanced pathological stage, higher Gleason score, higher preoperative PSA levels, and BCR. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with methylated PCDH17 had shorter BCR-free survival time compared to patients with unmethylated PCDH17. Cox regression analysis indicated that PCDH17 methylation was an independent predictive factor for the BCR of patients after radical prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS PCDH17 methylation in serum is a frequent event in early-stage prostate cancer, and it is an independent predictor of BCR after radical prostatectomy.""","""['Ying-Li Lin', 'Qiu-Kui Deng', 'Yu-Hao Wang', 'Xing-Li Fu', 'Jian-Guo Ma', 'Wen-Ping Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Aberrant Promoter Methylation of Protocadherin8 (PCDH8) in Serum is a Potential Prognostic Marker for Low Gleason Score Prostate Cancer.', 'Aberrant methylation of protocadherin 17 and its clinical significance in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic Value of Protocadherin10 (PCDH10) Methylation in Serum of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Aberrant methylation of PCDH10 predicts worse biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical value of cholinesterase in the prediction of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Do Protocadherins Show Prognostic Value in the Carcinogenesis of Human Malignant Neoplasms?

This led to a surge in the efforts for identification of safer and more effective metformin mimetic compounds. The plant Ficus microcarpa is widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in traditional medicine in South Asia. We obtained extracts from this plant and identified a small molecule, plectranthoic acid (PA), with potent 5'AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activating properties far superior than metformin. AMPK is the central hub of metabolic regulation and a well-studied therapeutic target for metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes and cancer. We observed that treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) cells with PA inhibited proliferation and induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest that was associated with up-regulation of cyclin kinase inhibitors p21/CIP1 and p27/KIP1. PA treatment suppressed mTOR/S6K signaling and induced apoptosis in PCa cells in an AMPK-dependent manner. Interestingly, PA-induced autophagy in PCa cells was found to be independent of AMPK activation. Combination studies of PA and metformin demonstrated that metformin had an inhibitory effect on PA-induced AMPK activation and suppressed PA-mediated apoptosis. Given the anti-proliferative role of PA in cancer and its potent anti-hyperglycemic activity, we suggest that PA should be explored further as a novel activator of AMPK for its ultimate use for the prevention of cancers and treatment of type 2 diabetes.""","""['Nosheen Akhtar', 'Deeba N Syed', 'Mohammad Imran Khan', 'Vaqar M Adhami', 'Bushra Mirza', 'Hasan Mukhtar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Targeting epithelial to mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer by a novel compound, plectranthoic acid, isolated from Ficus microcarpa.', 'Repurposing of nitroxoline as a potential anticancer agent against human prostate cancer: a crucial role on AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and the interplay with Chk2 activation.', 'Metformin inhibits growth of human non-small cell lung cancer cells via liver kinase B-1-independent activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase.', ""Targeting the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and related metabolic pathways for the treatment of prostate cancer."", 'Role of AMP-activated protein kinase in cancer therapy.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Natural Products as Anticancer Agents: Current Status and Future Perspectives.', ""AMPK's double-faced role in advanced stages of prostate cancer."", 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'LOC100996425 acts as a promoter in prostate cancer by mediating hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A and the AMPK/mTOR pathway.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 300 consecutive patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent (68) Ga-PSMA-PET/CT between February and July 2015 were prospectively included in the Prostate Cancer Imaging (ProCan-I) database. For the present analysis, we included patients with BCR (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level ≥0.05 and <1.0 ng/mL) after RP, who were being considered for salvage radiation therapy (RT) according to the Faculty of Radiation Oncology Genito-Urinary Group (FROGG) guidelines. Two readers assessed each (68) Ga-PSMA-PET/CT, and all positive lesions were assigned to an anatomical location. For each patient, the clinical and pathological features were recorded, their association with pathological (68) Ga-PSMA uptake was investigated, and detection rates were determined according to PSA level.  Results:   A total of 70 patients were included, and 53 positive (68) Ga-PSMA lesions were detected in 38 (54%) patients. Among patients with PSA levels 0.05-0.09 ng/mL, 8% were definitely positive; the corresponding percentages for the other PSA ranges were as follows: PSA 0.1-0.19 ng/mL, 23%; PSA 0.2-0.29 ng/mL, 58%; PSA 0.3-0.49 ng/mL, 36%; and PSA 0.5-0.99 ng/mL, 57%. Eighteen of 70 patients (27%) had pathological (68) Ga-PSMA uptake in the prostatic fossa, 11 (14.3%) in the pelvic nodes, and five (4.3%) in both the fossa and pelvic lymph nodes. Finally, there was uptake outside the pelvis with or without a lesion in the fossa or pelvic lymph nodes in four cases (8.6%). As a result of the (68) Ga-PSMA findings there was a major management change in 20 (28.6%) patients.  Conclusions:   (68) Ga-PSMA appears to be useful for re-staging of PCa in patients with rising PSA levels who are being considered for salvage RT even at PSA levels <0.5 ng/mL.

Many strategies have been proposed to estimate this parameter, but when differential analysis is the purpose, they often result in procedures based on plug-in estimates, and we show here that this discrepancy between the estimation framework and the testing framework can lead to uncontrolled type-I errors. Instead, we propose a mixture model that allows each gene to share information with other genes that exhibit similar variability. Three consistent statistical tests are developed for differential expression analysis. We show through a wide simulation study that the proposed method improves the sensitivity of detecting differentially expressed genes with respect to the common procedures, since it reaches the nominal value for the type-I error, while keeping elevate discriminative power between differentially and not differentially expressed genes.

Our objective was to describe the burden of bladder outlet obstruction after prostate cancer therapy by detailing the type of procedures performed and how often those procedures were repeated in men with recurrent bladder outlet obstruction.  Materials and methods:   Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare linked data from 1992 to 2007 with followup through 2009 we identified 12,676 men who underwent at least 1 bladder outlet obstruction procedure after prostate cancer therapy, including external beam radiotherapy in 3,994, brachytherapy in 1,485, brachytherapy plus external beam radiotherapy in 1,847, radical prostatectomy in 4,736, radical prostatectomy plus external beam radiotherapy in 369 and cryotherapy in 245. Histogram, incidence rates and Cox proportional hazards models with repeat events analysis were done to describe the burden of repeat bladder outlet obstruction treatments stratified by prostate cancer therapy type. We describe the type of bladder outlet obstruction surgery grouped by level of invasiveness.  Results:   At a median followup of 8.8 years 44.6% of men underwent 2 or more bladder outlet obstruction procedures. Compared to men who underwent radical prostatectomy those treated with brachytherapy and brachytherapy plus external beam radiotherapy were at increased adjusted risk for repeat bladder outlet obstruction treatment (HR 1.2 and 1.32, respectively, each p <0.05). After stricture incision the men treated with radical prostatectomy or radical prostatectomy plus external beam radiotherapy were most likely to undergo dilation at a rate of 34.7% to 35.0%. Stricture resection/ablation was more common after brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy plus external beam radiotherapy at a rate of 28.9% to 41.2%.

Materials and methods:   A total of 130 patients with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer were staged with (68)Ga-PSMA-PET/magnetic resonance tomography or PET/computerized tomography from December 2012 to November 2014 before radical prostatectomy and template pelvic lymph node dissection. Histopathological findings of resected tissue were statistically correlated with the results of (68)Ga-PSMA-PET and morphological imaging in a patient and template based manner.  Results:   Lymph node metastases were found in 41 of 130 patients (31.5%). On patient based analysis the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (68)Ga-PSMA-PET were 65.9%, 98.9% and 88.5%, and those of morphological imaging were 43.9%, 85.4% and 72.3%, respectively. Of 734 dissected lymph node templates 117 (15.9%) showed metastases. On template based analysis the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (68)Ga-PSMA-PET were 68.3%, 99.1% and 95.2%, and those of morphological imaging were 27.3%, 97.1% and 87.6%, respectively. On ROC analysis (68)Ga-PSMA-PET performed significantly better than morphological imaging alone on patient and template based analyses (p = 0.002 and <0.001, respectively).  Conclusions:   In patients with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer preoperative lymph node staging with (68)Ga-PSMA-PET proved to be superior to standard routine imaging. Thus it has the potential to replace current standard imaging for this indication if confirmed by prospective studies.""","""['Tobias Maurer', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Isabel Rauscher', 'Michael Souvatzoglou', 'Bernhard Haller', 'Gregor Weirich', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Matthias Heck', 'Hubert Kübler', 'Ambros J Beer', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'How accurate is 68Gallium-prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography / computed tomography (68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) on primary lymph node staging before radical prostatectomy in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer?

LAT1 (L-type amino acid transporter 1) transports essential amino acids, including leucine, which trigger the downstream mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. We examined the association between androgen receptor and LAT1, and the association between LAT1 expression and the acquisition of castration resistance.  Materials and methods:   Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to study protein and mRNA expression. siRNA was used to knock down target genes. A total of 92 prostate biopsy specimens of patients who underwent androgen deprivation therapy were used for immunohistochemical analyses. Cox hazard proportional models and the Kaplan-Meier method were used for statistical analyses.  Results:   LAT1 was highly expressed in hormone resistant prostate cancer cell lines. Knockdown of LAT1 in LNCaP and C4-2 cells significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Androgen receptor siRNA or androgen receptor blocking through bicalutamide (10 μM) or MDV3100 (10 μM) significantly increased LAT1 expression (p <0.01). Treatment with dihydrotestosterone (0.1 to 10 nM) reduced LAT1 expression in a dose dependent manner (p <0.01). Bicalutamide/MDV3100 plus siLAT1 synergistically suppressed prostate cancer cell proliferation compared to single inhibition by androgen receptor or LAT1 (p <0.01). High LAT1 expression correlated with significantly shorter prostate specific antigen recurrence-free survival in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (p <0.0001). LAT1 expression was an independent predictor of castration resistance on multivariate analysis (HR 3.56, p = 0.0133).

Many subsequent association studies confirmed this finding and implicated this gene in schizophrenia. However, the exact nature of the role of ANK3 in the pathophysiology remains elusive. In particular, the specific isoforms involved and the nature of the imbalance are unknown.  Methods:   We genotyped a Norwegian sample of 402 patients with bipolar disorder, 293 patients with schizophrenia, and 330 healthy control subjects genome-wide with the Illumina Human Exome BeadChip. We performed allelic association tests at the genome-wide and gene levels and found a significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphism in a splice site of ANK3. We replicated this finding in two other samples and studied the functional effect of this single nucleotide polymorphism by performing quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the affected exon junction in complementary DNA from blood total RNA.  Results:   The splice site single nucleotide polymorphism (rs41283526) is located in an alternatively spliced exon of ANK3 and has a strong and significant protective effect against bipolar disorder (odds ratio = .31) and schizophrenia (odds ratio = .21). The minor allele of rs41283526 is a loss-of-function variant that disables the correct splicing of the transcript. Data from the BrainSpan human developmental transcriptome show that the exon bearing this variant is expressed only in a minor isoform of ANK3, the transcription of which is initiated in early adolescence.

To examine whether the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening in patients with ESRD affects time to transplantation and transplant outcomes, we retrospectively analyzed 3782 male patients ≥18 years of age undergoing primary renal transplant evaluation during a 10-year period. Patients were grouped by age per American Urological Association screening guidelines: group 1, patients <55 years; group 2, patients 55-69 years; and group 3, patients >69 years. A positive screening test result was defined as a PSA level >4 ng/ml. We used univariate analysis and Cox proportional hazards models to identify the independent effect of screening on transplant waiting times, patient survival, and graft survival. Screening was performed in 63.6% of candidates, and 1198 candidates (31.7%) received kidney transplants. PSA screening was not associated with improved patient survival after transplantation (P=0.24). However, it did increase the time to listing and transplantation for candidates in groups 1 and 2 who had a positive screening result (P<0.05). Furthermore, compared with candidates who were not screened, PSA-screened candidates had a reduced likelihood of receiving a transplant regardless of the screening outcome (P<0.001). These data strongly suggest that PSA screening for prostate cancer may be more harmful than protective in renal transplant candidates because it does not appear to confer a survival benefit to these candidates and may delay listing and decrease transplantation rates.""","""['Gerardo A Vitiello', 'Blayne A Sayed', 'Marla Wardenburg', 'Sebastian D Perez', 'Christopher G Keith', 'Daniel J Canter', 'Kenneth Ogan', 'Thomas C Pearson', 'Nicole Turgeon']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Am Soc Nephrol""","""['Evaluation and Active Treatment versus Active Surveillance of Localized Prostate Cancer in Renal Transplant Patients in the Era of Low and Very Low Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Screening Trials and Revised PSA Screening Guidelines on Rates of Prostate Biopsy and Postbiopsy Complications.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Prostate-specific antigen screening and prostate cancer treatment in renal transplantation candidates: A survey of U.S. transplantation centers.', 'Prostate cancer screening and treatment in the transplant population: current status and recommendations.', 'Treatment patterns and survival of low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer in end-stage kidney disease: A retrospective population cohort study.', 'Aggressive Prostate Cancer at Presentation Following Solid Organ Transplantation.', 'Urological Cancers and Kidney Transplantation: a Literature Review.', 'Oncological and Functional Outcomes of Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy in Kidney Transplant Recipients.', 'The effect of subsequent immunosuppressant use in organ-transplanted patients on prostate cancer incidence: a retrospective analysis using the Korean National Health Insurance Database.']"""

Mammalian cells primarily use the autophagy-lysosome system to degrade misfolded/aggregated proteins and dysfunctional organelles such as lipid droplets. MAP1S (originally named C19ORF5) is an autophagy activator and promotes the biogenesis and degradation of autophagosomes. Previously, we reported that MAP1S suppresses hepatocellular carcinogenesis in a mouse model and promoted the survival of patients with prostate adenocarcinomas by increasing the degradation of aggregated proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria. Here we show that a suppression of MAP1S in renal cells causes an impairment of autophagic clearance of lipid droplets. In contrast, an overexpression of MAP1S causes an activation of autophagy flux and a reduction of lipid droplets so less DNA double strand breakage is induced. The levels of MAP1S in normal renal cells are dramatically higher than those in the ccRCC tissues and cell lines derived from renal cell carcinomas. High levels of MAP1S are associated with a reduced malignancy and metastasis of ccRCC and predict a better survival of ccRCC patients. Therefore, autophagy defects in the degradation of lipid droplets triggered by the MAP1S deficiency may enhance the initiation and development of ccRCC and reduce the survival of ccRCC patients.""","""['Guibin Xu', 'Yaodong Jiang', 'Yuansong Xiao', 'Xian D Liu', 'Fei Yue', 'Wenjiao Li', 'Xun Li', 'Yongzhong He', 'Xianhan Jiang', 'Hai Huang', 'Qi Chen', 'Eric Jonasch', 'Leyuan Liu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Defects in MAP1S-mediated autophagy turnover of fibronectin cause renal fibrosis.', 'Transforming Growth Factor TGFβ Increases Levels of Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP1S and Autophagy Flux in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinomas.', 'Mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase 1 promotes autophagy flux to suppress the development of clear cell renal cell carcinomas.', 'Autophagy and Lipid Droplets in the Liver.', 'Lipophagy in nonliver tissues and some related diseases: Pathogenic and therapeutic implications.', 'Harnessing Autophagy to Overcome Antigen-Specific T-Cell Dysfunction: Implication for People Living with HIV-1.', 'SPAG9 Expression Predicts Good Prognosis in Patients with Clear-Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Bioinformatics Analysis with Experimental Validation.', 'Spermidine as a promising anticancer agent: Recent advances and newer insights on its molecular mechanisms.', 'The roles of long non‑coding RNAs in renal cell carcinoma (Review).', 'Lipid metabolism in tumor microenvironment: novel therapeutic targets.']"""

In this study, we investigated this possibility by genetically deleting Sox4 in a mouse model of prostate cancer initiated by loss of the tumor suppressor Pten. We found that specific homozygous deletion of Sox4 in the adult prostate epithelium strongly inhibited tumor progression initiated by homozygous loss of Pten. Mechanistically, Sox4 ablation reduced activation of AKT and β-catenin, leading to an attenuated invasive phenotype. Furthermore, SOX4 expression was induced by Pten loss as a result of the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, suggesting a positive feedback loop between SOX4 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity.

It is also reported to be the result of incorrect voiding habits during toilet training. Children contract pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) to suppress DMC and DV begins. Urinary nerve growth factor (uNGF) is necessary for the synthesis and regulation of neurotransmitters, development of dorsal root ganglia (sensory neurons), and development of sympathetic cells during embryonic and post-natal life. uNGF has also a role in the intracellular signal transduction in nerve cells towards the target organ. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the association between uNGF, biofeedback treatment and DV in children.  Objectives:   The aim was to examine the potential effect of uNGF in the assessment of the effectiveness of biofeedback success in children with lower urinary tract disorders.  Study design:   Fifty-two children with the suspicion of DV and 48 children from a primary school reporting no urinary complaints were enrolled in this study from October 2010 to April 2013 in the Urology Department. uNGF levels were compared.  Results:   The mean uNGF/creatinine (Cr) level was 0.23 ± 0.26 in the control group and 0.96 ± 0.88 in the DV group (p < 0.001). The mean uNGF/Cr levels in the DV group at baseline and at the end of biofeedback therapy at 6 and 12 months were 0.90 ± 0.78, 0.26 ± 0.32, and 0.40 ± 0.50, respectively (p < 0.001) (Figure).  Discussion:   To our knowledge this study is the first to show the correlations between uNGF levels and biofeedback therapy in children with DV. Tissue NGF in 12 patients with overactive bladder (OAB)/detrusor overactivity and 15 healthy women was previously compared and it was suggested that there was no correlation between bladder tissue NGF and OAB. uNGF levels in the bladder in patients with interstitial cystitis and idiopathic sensorial urgency were evaluated previously, and uNGF levels reported. Similar to these reports, most of the previous studies handled uNGF in patients with diseases such as interstitial cystitis, OAB, urinary tract infections, urolithiasis, spinal cord injury, and prostate cancer, and found significantly higher uNGF levels. These studies were generally in adults. A previous study about uNGF comprised 40 children with OAB, in contrast to other studies. According to this study, 40 children diagnosed with OAB were administered anti-muscarinic therapy (oxybutynin 0.3-0.5 mg/kg/day). It was reported that uNGF/Cr levels of the OAB group were higher than control group. In the current study, we evaluated the uNGF difference in DV and the effect of biofeedback treatment on uNGF levels.  Conclusions:   uNGF levels were higher in children with DV and decreased after biofeedback therapy. uNGF levels could be used for the diagnosis and the assessment of biofeedback success in these children.""","""['Giray Ergin', 'Yusuf Kibar', 'Turgay Ebiloğlu', 'H Cem Irkılata', 'Burak Kopru', 'Engin Kaya', 'Metin Uyanık', 'Serkan Tapan', 'M Murat Dayanc']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Pediatr Urol""","""['Sacral nerve stimulation reduces elevated urinary nerve growth factor levels in women with symptomatic detrusor overactivity.', 'Urinary nerve growth factor levels could be a biomarker for overactive bladder symptom: a meta-analysis.', 'Can children with either overactive bladder or dysfunctional voiding transition from one into the other: Are\xa0both part of a single entity?', 'Nerve growth factor (NGF): a potential urinary biomarker for overactive bladder syndrome (OAB)?', 'Urinary nerve growth factor levels in overactive bladder syndrome and lower urinary tract disorders.', 'Early Detrusor Application of Botulinum Toxin A Results in Reduced Bladder Hypertrophy and Fibrosis after Spinal Cord Injury in a Rodent Model.', 'The effect of biofeedback interventions on pain, overall symptoms, quality of life and physiological parameters in patients with pelvic pain : A\xa0systematic review.', 'Effects of Panax ginseng on the nerve growth factor expression in testosterone induced benign prostatic hyperplasia.']"""

Here, utilizing a prostate adenocarcinoma model driven by loss of Pten and Smad4, we identify polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) as the major infiltrating immune cell type, and depletion of MDSCs blocks progression. Employing a novel dual reporter prostate cancer model, epithelial and stromal transcriptomic profiling identified CXCL5 as a cancer-secreted chemokine to attract CXCR2-expressing MDSCs, and, correspondingly, pharmacologic inhibition of CXCR2 impeded tumor progression. Integrated analyses identified hyperactivated Hippo-YAP signaling in driving CXCL5 upregulation in cancer cells through the YAP-TEAD complex and promoting MDSC recruitment. Clinicopathologic studies reveal upregulation and activation of YAP1 in a subset of human prostate tumors, and the YAP1 signature is enriched in primary prostate tumor samples with stronger expression of MDSC-relevant genes. Together, YAP-driven MDSC recruitment via heterotypic CXCL5-CXCR2 signaling reveals an effective therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancer.  Significance:   We demonstrate a critical role of MDSCs in prostate tumor progression and discover a cancer cell nonautonomous function of the Hippo-YAP pathway in regulation of CXCL5, a ligand for CXCR2-expressing MDSCs. Pharmacologic elimination of MDSCs or blocking the heterotypic CXCL5-CXCR2 signaling circuit elicits robust antitumor responses and prolongs survival.""","""['Guocan Wang', 'Xin Lu', 'Prasenjit Dey', 'Pingna Deng', 'Chia Chin Wu', 'Shan Jiang', 'Zhuangna Fang', 'Kun Zhao', 'Ramakrishna Konaparthi', 'Sujun Hua', 'Jianhua Zhang', 'Elsa M Li-Ning-Tapia', 'Avnish Kapoor', 'Chang-Jiun Wu', 'Neelay Bhaskar Patel', 'Zhenglin Guo', 'Vandhana Ramamoorthy', 'Trang N Tieu', 'Tim Heffernan', 'Di Zhao', 'Xiaoying Shang', 'Sunada Khadka', 'Pingping Hou', 'Baoli Hu', 'Eun-Jung Jin', 'Wantong Yao', 'Xiaolu Pan', 'Zhihu Ding', 'Yanxia Shi', 'Liren Li', 'Qing Chang', 'Patricia Troncoso', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Mark J McArthur', 'Lynda Chin', 'Y Alan Wang', 'Ronald A DePinho']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Discov""","""['Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell Subset Accumulation in Renal Cell Carcinoma Parenchyma Is Associated with Intratumoral Expression of IL1β, IL8, CXCL5, and Mip-1α.', 'CXCR2/CXCL5 axis contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition of HCC cells through activating PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β/Snail signaling.', 'CXCL2/MIF-CXCR2 signaling promotes the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and is correlated with prognosis in bladder cancer.', 'CXCL5/CXCR2 axis in tumor microenvironment as potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target.', 'The Hippo Signaling Pathway in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Targeting of SLC25A22 boosts the immunotherapeutic response in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer.', 'The Hippo Pathway Effectors YAP/TAZ-TEAD Oncoproteins as Emerging Therapeutic Targets in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Inhibition of YAP1 activity ameliorates acute lung injury through promotion of M2 macrophage polarization.', 'Comprehensive analysis and molecular map of Hippo signaling pathway in lower grade glioma: the perspective toward immune microenvironment and prognosis.', 'FAP promotes metastasis and chemoresistance via regulating YAP1 and macrophages in mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma.']"""

Worryingly the rate of infectious complications following TRUS biopsy has been shown to be increasing. We aimed to determine the rate, severity, risk factors, standard patterns of care and microbiology resistance profiles associated with TRUS biopsy sepsis.  Methods:   A retrospective case-control study was conducted. Using electronic coding all patients who presented to Cabrini Hospital with sepsis following a TRUS biopsy from 2009 to 2013 were identified. Validated cases were matched to controls in a ratio of 1:3. Eligible controls were required to have undergone a TRUS biopsy at the same surgical institution as the case and in the closest period of time. Demographic, procedural and patient related data-points were recorded for all patients using hospital and urologist records. Univariate logistic regression models were constructed and used to determine risk factors associated with infection.  Results:   71 cases developed sepsis following TRUS biopsy and were matched to 213 controls. The average rate of sepsis over the 5-year study period was 1.5 %. A SOFA score ≥ 2 was identified in 28 % of cases. We found a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistant E. coli, with 61 % of blood culture isolates classified as Multidrug resistant organisms. Eight different prophylactic antimicrobial regimens were identified with 33 % of cases receiving ineffective antimicrobial prophylaxis. Statistically significant risk factors included previous antimicrobial use and prior international travel within the six months prior to biopsy.  Conclusions:   TRUS biopsy is an elective procedure and as such needs to be associated with minimal morbidity. The patterns of care surrounding periprocedural variables for TRUS biopsies were non-uniform and diverse. A wide variety of different prophylaxis regimens and bowel preparation routines were recorded. Patients with risk factors for sepsis may represent a better target population for intervention with alternative preventative strategies. Alternative preventative options include augmented prophylaxis, tailored prophylaxis or the TP biopsy approach either as a first line biopsy modality or based on epidemiological risk factors.""","""['Elliot Anderson', 'Olivia Leahy', 'Allen C Cheng', 'Jeremy Grummet']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Infect Dis""","""['Escherichia coli bloodstream infection after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: implications of fluoroquinolone-resistant sequence type 131 as a major causative pathogen.', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase in the rectal flora of patients undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy: a study of the prevalence in a major metropolitan hospital.', 'Prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the intestinal flora of patients undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy in Norwich, UK.', 'Infectious complications following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: new challenges in the era of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli.', ""Sepsis and 'superbugs': should we favour the transperineal over the transrectal approach for prostate biopsy?"", 'A review on advances in 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics standardisation and application in lung disease management.', 'A New Nomogram Allowing Physicians to Predict Patients at High Risk of Fever Occurring After Prostate Biopsy.', 'Risk of Prostate Cancer-related Death Following a Low PSA Level in the PLCO Trial.', 'Zinc as an Imaging Biomarker of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prospective Monitoring and Adapting Strategies for Prevention of Infection Following Transrectal Prostate Procedures.']"""

Here, we report that adipocytes promote the enrichment of prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) through a vicious cycle of autocrine amplification. In the presence of adipocytes, prostate cancer cells actively secrete the peptide hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which not only stimulates prostate CSC self-renewal, but also induces cathepsin B (CTSB) production of the adipocytes. In return, CTSB facilitates further CCK secretion by the cancer cells. More importantly, inactivation of CCK receptor not only suppresses CTSB secretion by the adipocytes, but also synergizes the inhibitory effect of CTSB inhibitor on adipocyte-promoted prostate CSC self-renewal. In summary, we have uncovered a novel mechanism underlying the mutual interplay between adipocytes and prostate CSCs, which may help explaining the role of adipocytes in prostate cancer progression and provide opportunities for effective intervention.""","""['Kai-Dun Tang', 'Ji Liu', 'Lidija Jovanovic', 'Jiyuan An', 'Michelle M Hill', 'Ian Vela', 'Terence Kin-Wah Lee', 'Stephanie Ma', 'Colleen Nelson', 'Pamela J Russell', 'Judith A Clements', 'Ming-Tat Ling']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The inhibitor of differentiation isoform Id1b, generated by alternative splicing, maintains cell quiescence and confers self-renewal and cancer stem cell-like properties.', 'Tie-2 regulates the stemness and metastatic properties of prostate cancer cells.', 'miRNA-regulated delivery of lincRNA-p21 suppresses β-catenin signaling and tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer stem cells.', 'Identification, characterization, and biological relevance of prostate cancer stem cells from clinical specimens.', 'Targeting prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Endocrine and paracrine characteristics of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'The effect of obesity on adipose-derived stromal cells and adipose tissue and their impact on cancer.', 'Prognostic significance and oncogene function of cathepsin A in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Statins reduce castration-induced bone marrow adiposity and prostate cancer progression in bone.', 'Obesity-related gut hormones and cancer: novel insight into the pathophysiology.']"""

Nevertheless, the pathophysiology of OPN in prostate tumorigenesis has never been studied. We crossed TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mice with OPN deficient (OPN-/-) mice and followed tumor onset and progression in these double mutants. Ultrasound examination detected the early onset of a rapidly growing, homogeneous and spherical tumor in about 60% of OPN-/- TRAMP mice. Such neoplasms seldom occurred in parental TRAMP mice otherwise prone to adenocarcinomas and were characterized for being androgen receptor negative, highly proliferative and endowed with neuroendocrine (NE) features. Gene expression profiling showed up-regulation of genes involved in tumor progression, cell cycle and neuronal differentiation in OPN-deficient versus wild type TRAMP tumors. Down-regulated genes included key genes of TGFa pathway, including SMAD3 and Filamin, which were confirmed at the protein level. Furthermore, NE genes and particularly those characterizing early prostatic lesions of OPN-deficient mice were found to correlate with those of human prostate NE tumours. These data underscore a novel role of OPN in the early stages of prostate cancer growth, protecting against the development of aggressive NE tumors.""","""['Giorgio Mauri', 'Elena Jachetti', 'Barbara Comuzzi', 'Matteo Dugo', 'Ivano Arioli', 'Silvia Miotti', 'Sabina Sangaletti', 'Emma Di Carlo', 'Claudio Tripodo', 'Mario P Colombo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Dietary genistein improves survival and reduces expression of osteopontin in the prostate of transgenic mice with prostatic adenocarcinoma (TRAMP).', 'Loss of MyD88 leads to more aggressive TRAMP prostate cancer and influences tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.', 'The insulin-like growth factor axis and prostate cancer: lessons from the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model.', 'Neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer cells: neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   In total, 1602 biopsy cores from 297 consecutive patients (mean ± SD, 66.1 ± 7.8 years; median prostate-specific antigen value, 8.2 ng/mL) in primary (n = 160) and secondary (n = 137) prostate biopsy settings were evaluated in this retrospective study. All patients previously underwent prostate MRI (T2-weighted imaging, DWI, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging) at 3 T. All described lesions were biopsied with MRI-guided in-bore biopsy and were examined histologically.  Results:   In 148 patients, overall 511 cores were positive for prostate cancer. Clinically significant prostate cancer (any Gleason pattern ≥ 4) was found in 82.4% of patients. The prostate cancer detection rate for patients who underwent primary biopsies was 55.6% and was 43.1% for patients who underwent secondary biopsies.

This study׳s objective was to evaluate the survival benefit of adding ADT to high-dose RT for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer using the National Cancer Data Base.  Materials and methods:   The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated from 2004 to 2006, with available data for Gleason Score, prostate-specific antigen, TNM staging, and receipt of radiation and ADT. Start of RT was within 1 to 180 days of ADT; radiation included external beam alone (≥70Gy) or external beam RT plus brachytherapy boost. Overall survival was evaluated using multivariate (MVA) Cox regression and propensity score-matched (PSM) analyses.  Results:   A total of 14,126 patients were included of which 7,568 (53.6%) received no ADT and 6,558 (46.4%) received ADT. Median follow-up was 85.8 months (6.0-119.9mo). Median RT dose was 75.6Gy in 42 fractions. Under MVA, the addition of ADT for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer had no overall survival benefit compared with RT alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.97, P = 0.316). PSM also confirmed no survival benefit with the addition of ADT for the entire intermediate-risk cohort (HR = 0.98, P = 0.560). On subset analysis, those with 3 intermediate-risk factors had a survival benefit with the addition of ADT on both MVA (HR = 0.69, P = 0.037) and PSM (HR = 0.61, P = 0.026). Limitations include retrospective design and incomplete data on the type of ADT and duration.

Methods:   From May 2013 to January 2015, 40 men aged 66 years (median) with very low-risk PCa were enrolled in an AS protocol, and eligible criteria were: life expectancy greater than 10 years, cT1C, PSA below 10 ng/ml, PSA density <0.20, ≤2 unilateral positive biopsy cores, Gleason score (GS) equal to 6, greatest percentage of cancer (GPC) in a core ≤50 %.

We assessed plans of SABR with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) that used a flattening filter (FF) beam and an FFF beam and compared the verification results of dosimetric quality assurance for all pretreatment plans. A total of 20 patients with prostate cancer were enrolled in the study. SABR plans using VMAT with two full arcs were optimized in the Eclipse treatment planning system. All plans prescribed 42.7 Gy in 7 fractions of 6.1 Gy each. Four SABR plans were computed for each patient: two with FF beams and two with FFF beams of 6 and 10 MV. For all plans, the cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs) were recorded and compared. Pretreatment quality assurance (QA) was performed using the I'mRT MatriXX system and radiochromic EBT3 film to verify treatment delivery, and gamma analysis was used to quantify the agreement between calculations and measurements. In addition, total monitor units (MUs) and delivery time were investigated as technical parameters of delivery. All four plans achieved adequate dose conformity to the target volumes and had comparable dosimetric data. The DVHs of all four plans for each patient were very similar. All plans were highly conformal with CI < 1.05 and CN > 0.90, and the doses were homogeneous (HI = 0.08-0.15). Sparing for the bladder and rectum was slightly better with the 10 MV FF and FFF plans than with the 6 MV FF and FFF plans, but the difference was negligible. However, there was no significant difference in sparing for the other OARs. The mean agreement with the 3%/3 mm criterion was higher than 97% for verifying all plans. For the 2%/2 mm criterion, the corresponding agreement values were more than 90%, which showed that the plans were acceptable. The mean MUs and delivery time used were 1701 ± 101 and 3.02 ± 0.17 min for 6 MV FF, 1870 ± 116 and 2.01 ± 0.01 min for 6 MV FFF, 1471 ± 86 and 2.68 ± 0.14 min for 10 MV FF, and 1619 ± 101 and 2.00 ± 0.00 min for 10MV FFF, respectively. In the current study, the dose distributions of the prostate SABR plans using 6 and 10 MV FFF beams were similar to those using 6 and 10 MV FF beams. However, this study confirmed that SABR treatment using an FFF beam had an advantage with respect to delivery time. In addition, all pretreatment plans were verified as acceptable and their results were comparable. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the use of an FFF beam for prostate SABR is a feasible and efficient technique, if carefully applied.""","""['Jin-Beom Chung', 'Jae-Sung Kim', 'Keun-Yong Eom', 'In-Ah Kim', 'Sang-Won Kang', 'Jeong-Woo Lee', 'Jin-Young Kim', 'Tae-Suk Suh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Radiation-induced second primary cancer risks from modern external beam radiotherapy for early prostate cancer: impact of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and flattening filter free (FFF) radiotherapy.', 'A dosimetric comparison for SBRT plans of localized prostate cancer between Cyberknife and Varian Truebeam STX device.', 'Dosimetric comparison of flattened and unflattened beams for stereotactic ablative radiotherapy of stage I non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Efficacy of flattening-filter-free beam in stereotactic body radiation therapy planning and treatment: A systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'Comparison of Moderate Hypofractionated Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy Plans With and Without Flattening Filter for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison between flattening filter-free (FFF) and flattened photon beam VMAT plans for the whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with hippocampus sparing.', 'The effect of prostate motion during hypofractionated radiotherapy can be reduced by using flattening filter free beams.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning for prostate cancer with flattened beam and flattening filter free linear accelerators.', 'Class solutions for SABR-VMAT for high-risk prostate cancer with and without elective nodal irradiation.']"""

However, there are no clinical data to quantitatively demonstrate the impact of the low-dose threshold on the gamma index. Therefore, we performed a gamma analysis with various low-dose thresholds in the range of 0% to 15% according to both global and local normalization and different acceptance criteria (3%/3 mm, 2%/2 mm, and 1%/1 mm). A total of 30 treatment plans--10 head and neck, 10 brain, and 10 prostate cancer cases--were randomly selected from the Varian Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS). For the gamma analysis, a calculated portal image was acquired through a portal dose calculation algorithm in the Eclipse TPS, and a measured portal image was obtained using an electronic portal-imaging device. Then, the gamma analysis was performed using the Portal Dosimetry software (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). The gamma passing rate (%GP) for the global normalization decreased as the low-dose threshold increased, and all low-dose thresholds led to %GP values above 95% for both the 3%/3 mm and 2%/2 mm criteria. However, for the local normalization, %GP for a low-dose threshold of 10% was 7.47%, 10.23%, and 6.71% greater than the low-dose threshold of 0% for head and neck, brain, and prostate for the 3%/3 mm criteria, respectively. The results indicate that applying the low-dose threshold to global normalization does not have a critical impact on patient-specific QA results. However, in the local normalization, the low-dose threshold level should be carefully selected because the excluded low-dose points could cause the average %GP to increase rapidly.""","""['Ji-Hye Song', 'Min-Joo Kim', 'So-Hyun Park', 'Seu-Ran Lee', 'Min-Young Lee', 'Dong Soo Lee', 'Tae Suk Suh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Tomotherapy treatment plan quality assurance: the impact of applied criteria on passing rate in gamma index method.', 'Pretreatment patient-specific IMRT quality assurance: a correlation study between gamma index and patient clinical dose volume histogram.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy: effective and efficient end-to-end patient-specific quality assurance.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', '3D treatment planning system-Varian Eclipse for proton therapy planning.', 'Evaluation of an anthropomorphic ion chamber and 3D gel dosimetry head phantom at a 0.35 T MR-linac using separate 1.5 T MR-scanners for gel readout.', 'On the accuracy of bulk synthetic CT for MR-guided online adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Defining the Optimal Time of Adaptive Replanning in Prostate Cancer Patients with Weight Change during Volumetric Arc Radiotherapy: A Dosimetric and Mathematical Analysis Using the Gamma Index.', 'Can clinically relevant dose errors in patient anatomy be detected by gamma passing rate or modulation complexity score in volumetric-modulated arc therapy for intracranial tumors?']"""

The prostate CTV and OARs were contoured on all CBCTs. IMRT plans were created using 1 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm, and 7 mm CTV to PTV expansions. For each delivered fraction, dose calculations were generated utilizing the pretreatment CBCT translational shifts performed and dosimetric analysis was performed. One hundred and forty total treatment fractions (CBCT sessions) were evaluated. The planned prostate CTV V100% was 100% for all PTV margins. Based on CBCT analysis, the actual cumulative CTVs V100% were 96.55% ± 2.94%, 99.49% ± 1.36%, 99.98% ± 0.26%, and 99.99% ± 0.05% for 1, 3, 5, and 7 mm uniform PTV margins, respectively. Delivered rectum and bladder doses were different as compared to expected planned doses, with the magnitude of differences increasing with PTV margin. Daily setup variation during prostate IMRT yields differences in the actual vs. expected doses received by the prostate CTV, rectum, and bladder. The magnitude of these differences is significantly affected by the PTV margin utilized.

The range and dosimetric change introduced by a mismatch in kVp used for the CT scan and the HU to PSPR table, based on a specific kVp, used to calculate dose are analyzed. Three HU to PSPR curves, corresponding to three kVp settings on the CT scanner, were created. A treatment plan was created for a single beam in a water phantom passing through a wedge-shaped bone heterogeneity. The dose was recalculated by changing only the HU to PSPR table used in the dose calculation. The change in the position of the distal 90% isodose line was recorded as a function of heterogeneity thickness along the beam path. The dosimetric impact of a mismatch in kVp between the CT and the HU to PSPR table was investigated by repeating this procedure for five clinical plans comparing DVH data and dose difference distributions. The HU to PSPR tables diverge for CT numbers greater than 200 HU. In the phantom plan, the divergence of the tables resulted in a difference in range of 1.6 mm per cm of bone in the beam path, for the HU used. For the clinical plans, the dosimetric effect of a kVp mismatch depends on the amount of bone in the beam path and the proximity of OARs to the distal range of the planned beams. A mismatch in kVp between the CT and the HU to PSPR table can introduce inaccuracy in the proton beam range. For dense bone, the measured range difference was approximately 1.6 mm per cm of bone along the beam path. However, the clinical cases analyzed showed a range change of 1 mm or less.

CBCT was used to image an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom, in eight sessions on eight different days. In each session, the phantom was scanned twice, first at a standard position as determined by the room lasers, and then after it was shifted by 10 mm translation randomly along one of the X, Y, or Z directions. The filling of the phantom bladder with water was not refreshed from day to day, inducing gradual change of the water-equivalent path length (WEPL) across the bladder. MIMvista (MIM) software was used to perform image registration and re-alignment of all the scans with the scan from the first session. The XiO treatment planning system was used to perform data analysis. It was found that, although the Hounsfield unit numbers in CBCT have substantially larger fluctuations than those in diagnostic CT, CBCT datasets taken for daily patient positioning could potentially be used to monitor changes in patient anatomy. The reproducibility of the WEPL, computed using CBCT along anterior-posterior (AP) paths across and around the phantom prostate, over a volume of 360 cc, is sufficient for detecting daily WEPL variations that are equal to or larger than 3 mm. This result also applies to CBCT scans of the phantom after it is randomly shifted from the treatment position by 10 mm. limiting the interest to WEPL variation over a specific path within the same CBCT slice, one can detect WEPL variation smaller than 1 mm. That is the case when using CBCT for tracking daily change of the WEPL across the phantom bladder that was induced by spontaneous change in the bladder filling due to evaporation. In summary, the phantom study suggests that CBCT can be used for monitoring day to day WEPL variations in a patient. The method can detect WEPL variation equal to or greater than 3 mm. The study calls for further investigation using the CBCT data from real patients. If confirmed with real patients' data, CBCT could become, in addition to patient setup, a standard tool for proton therapy pretreatment beam range check.""","""['El Hassane Bentefour', 'Stefan Both', 'Shikui Tang', 'Hsiao-Ming Lu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Validation of an in-vivo proton beam range check method in an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom using dose measurements.', 'Proton dose calculation on scatter-corrected CBCT image: Feasibility study for adaptive proton therapy.', 'Phantom based evaluation of CT to CBCT image registration for proton therapy dose recalculation.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Quality assurance phantoms for cone beam computed tomography: a systematic literature review.', 'A method for acquiring random range uncertainty probability distributions in proton therapy.']"""

Usually, Monte Carlo ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry is performed in a water phantom. However, here, the compositions of human eye have been considered instead of water. Both human eye and water phantoms have been simulated with MCNP5 code. These simulations were performed for a fully loaded 16 mm COMS eye plaque containing 13 125I seeds. The dose delivered to the tumor and normal tissues have been calculated in both phantoms with and without GNPs. Normally, the radiation therapy of cancer patients is designed to deliver a required dose to the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. However, as the normal and cancerous cells absorbed dose in an almost identical fashion, the normal tissue absorbed radiation dose during the treatment time. The use of GNPs in combination with radiotherapy in the treatment of tumor decreases the absorbed dose by normal tissues. The results indicate that the dose to the tumor in an eyeball implanted with COMS plaque increases with increasing GNPs concentration inside the target. Therefore, the required irradiation time for the tumors in the eye is decreased by adding the GNPs prior to treatment. As a result, the dose to normal tissues decreases when the irradiation time is reduced. Furthermore, a comparison between the simulated data in an eye phantom made of water and eye phantom made of human eye composition, in the presence of GNPs, shows the significance of utilizing the composition of eye in ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry Also, defining the eye composition instead of water leads to more accurate calculations of GNPs radiation effects in ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry.""","""['Somayeh Asadi', 'Mehdi Vaez-zadeh', 'S Farhad Masoudi', 'Faezeh Rahmani', 'Courtney Knaup', 'Ali S Meigooni']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Ocular brachytherapy dosimetry for 103Pd and 125I in the presence of gold nanoparticles: a Monte Carlo study.', 'Evaluation of dose enhancement in presence of gold nanoparticles in eye brachytherapy by 103Pd source.', 'Model-based dose calculations for COMS eye plaque brachytherapy using an anatomically realistic eye phantom.', 'Determination of spatial dose distribution in UCC treatments with LDR brachytherapy using Monte Carlo methods.', 'Radiation therapy for choroidal melanoma.', 'Gold Nanoparticles-Mediated Photothermal Therapy of Pancreas Using GATE: A New Simulation Platform.', 'Experimental Evaluation of Radiation Response and Thermal Properties of NPs-Loaded Tissues-Mimicking Phantoms.', 'LiCl induces apoptosis via CHOP/NOXA/Mcl-1 axis in human choroidal melanoma cells.', 'A detailed Monte Carlo evaluation of 192Ir dose enhancement for gold nanoparticles and comparison with experimentally measured dose enhancements.', 'Investigation of gold nanoparticle effects in brachytherapy by an electron emitter ophthalmic plaque.']"""

The position of each MLC leaf has become more critical for intensity-modulated delivery (step-and-shoot IMRT, dynamic IMRT, and VMAT) compared to 3D CRT, where it defines only field boundaries. We analyzed the impact of the MLC positional errors on the dose distribution for volumetric-modulated arc therapy, using a 3D dosimetry system. A total of 15 VMAT cases, five each for brain, head and neck, and prostate cases, were retrospectively selected for the study. All the plans were generated in Monaco 3.0.0v TPS (Elekta Corporation, Atlanta, GA) and delivered using Elekta Synergy linear accelerator. Systematic errors of +1, +0.5, +0.3, 0, -1, -0.5, -0.3 mm were introduced in the MLC bank of the linear accelerator and the impact on the dose distribution of VMAT delivery was measured using the COMPASS 3D dosim-etry system. All the plans were created using single modulated arcs and the dose calculation was performed using a Monte Carlo algorithm in a grid size of 3 mm. The clinical endpoints D95%, D50%, D2%, and Dmax,D20%, D50% were taken for the evaluation of the target and critical organs doses, respectively. A significant dosimetric effect was found for many cases even with 0.5 mm of MLC positional errors. The average change of dose D 95% to PTV for ± 1 mm, ± 0.5 mm, and ±0.3mm was 5.15%, 2.58%, and 0.96% for brain cases; 7.19%, 3.67%, and 1.56% for head and neck cases; and 8.39%, 4.5%, and 1.86% for prostate cases, respectively. The average deviation of dose Dmax was 5.4%, 2.8%, and 0.83% for brainstem in brain cases; 8.2%, 4.4%, and 1.9% for spinal cord in H&N; and 10.8%, 6.2%, and 2.1% for rectum in prostate cases, respectively. The average changes in dose followed a linear relationship with the amount of MLC positional error, as can be expected. MLC positional errors beyond ± 0.3 mm showed a significant influence on the intensity-modulated dose distributions. It is, therefore, recommended to have a cautious MLC calibration procedure to sufficiently meet the accuracy in dose delivery.""","""['Karthikeyan Nithiyanantham', 'Ganesh K Mani', 'Vikraman Subramani', 'Lutz Mueller', 'Karrthick K Palaniappan', 'Tejinder Kataria']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Quantitative evaluation of 3D dosimetry for stereotactic volumetric-modulated arc delivery using COMPASS.', 'Dosimetric impact and detectability of multi-leaf collimator positioning errors on Varian Halcyon.', 'Evaluation of MLC leaf positioning accuracy for static and dynamic IMRT treatments using DAVID in vivo dosimetric system.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Application of error classification model using indices based on dose distribution for characteristics evaluation of multileaf collimator position errors.', 'Image-based features in machine learning to identify delivery errors and predict error magnitude for patient-specific IMRT quality assurance.', 'Comparing log file to measurement-based patient-specific quality assurance.', 'Optimizing the Region for Evaluation of Global Gamma Analysis for Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC) Pretreatment IMRT QA by COMPASS: A Retrospective Study.', 'Impact of systematic MLC positional uncertainties on the quality of single-isocenter multi-target VMAT-SRS treatment plans.']"""

Ten prostate and ten intracranial cases were planned for the CK-MLC. Half of these cases were compared with clinically approved SBRT plans generated for the CyberKnife with circular collimators, and the other half were compared with clinically approved standard fractionated IMRT plans generated for conventional linacs. The plans were compared on target coverage, conformity, homogeneity, dose to organs at risk (OAR), low dose to the surrounding tissue, total monitor units (MU), and treatment time. CK-MLC plans generated for the SBRT cases achieved more homogeneous dose to the target than the CK plans with the circular collimators, for equivalent coverage, conformity, and dose to OARs. Total monitor units were reduced by 40% to 70% and treatment time was reduced by half. The CK-MLC plans generated for the standard fractionated cases achieved prescription isodose lines between 86% and 93%, which was 2%-3% below the plans generated for conventional linacs. Compared to standard IMRT plans, the total MU were up to three times greater for the prostate (whole pelvis) plans and up to 1.4 times greater for the intracranial plans. Average treatment time was 25min for the whole pelvis plans and 19 min for the intracranial cases. The CK-MLC system provides significant improvements in treatment time and target homogeneity compared to the CK system with circular collimators, while main-taining high conformity and dose sparing to critical organs.

After the initial setup, the pelvic bony structure-based setup and ExacTrac system were applied. After that, CBCT and a soft tissue-based setup were used. A shift in the isocenter between the ExacTrac-based and CBCT-based setup was recorded in the anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), and left-right (LR) axes. The shift was considered an interfractional prostate shift. Post-treatment CBCT was also taken once a week to measure the intrafractional prostate shift, based on the coordinates of the isocenter between pre- and post-treatment CBCT. The planning target volume (PTV) margins were determined using van Herk's method. We measured the elapsed time required for soft tissue matching and the entire treatment time using CBCT.

The DMU calculation method determines the clinical DMU by the multiplication of three factors: a beam spreading device factor FBSD, a patient-specific device factor FPSD, and a field-size correction factor FFS(A). We compared the calculated and the measured DMU for 75 dose fields in clinical cases.

This work explores these risks, discusses strategies to mitigate those risks, and describes a case study for a permanent iodine-125 (I-125) prostate brachytherapy implant patient who developed colorectal cancer and required surgery six months after brachytherapy. The first consideration is identifying the radiological risk to the patient and staff before, during, and after the surgical procedure. The second is identifying the risk the surgical procedure may have on the efficacy of the brachytherapy implant. Finally, there are considerations for controlling the radioactive substances from a regulatory perspective. After these risks are defined, strategies to mitigate those risks are considered. We summarize this experience with some guidelines: If the surgical procedure is near (e.g., within 5-10 cm of) the implant; and, the surgical intervention may dislodge sources enough to compromise treatment or introduces radiation safety risks; and, the radioactivity has not sufficiently decayed to background levels; and, the surgery cannot be postponed, then a detailed analysis of risk is advised.""","""['Parminder S Basran', 'Patricia Baxter', 'Wayne A Beckham']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Radiation safety aspects of brachytherapy for prostate cancer using permanently implanted sources.

For dosimetric evaluation of the MIM Symphony version 5.4 TPS, we compared dose calculations from the MIM Symphony TPS with the formalism recommended by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 43 report (TG-43) and those generated by the VariSeed version 8.0 TPS for iodine-125 (I-125; Models 6711 and IAI-125A), palladium-103 (Pd-103; Model 200), and cesium-131 (Cs-131; Model Cs-1). Validation was performed for both line source and point source approximations. As part of the treatment planning validation, first a QA phantom (CIRS Brachytherapy QA Phantom Model 045 SN#D7210-3) containing three ellipsoid objects with certified volumes was scanned in order to check the volume accuracy of the contoured structures in MIM Symphony. Then the DICOM data containing 100 patient plans from the VariSeed TPS were imported into the MIM Symphony TPS. The 100 plans included 25 each of I-125 pre-implant plans, Pd-103 pre-implant plans, I-125 Day 30 plans (i.e., from 1 month after implantation), and Pd-103 Day 30 plans. The dosimetric parameters (including prostate volume, prostate D90 values, and rectum V100 values) of the 100 plans were calculated independently on the two TPSs. Other TPS tests that were done included verification of source input and geometrical accuracy, data transfer between different planning systems, text printout, 2D dose plots, DVH printout, and template grid accuracy. According to the line source formalism, the dosimetric results between the MIM Symphony TPS and TG-43 were within 0.5% (0.02 Gy) for r > 1 cm. In the line source approximation validation, MIM Symphony TPS values agreed with VariSeed TPS values to within 0.5% (0.09 Gy) for r > 1 cm. Similarly, in point source approximation validation, the MIM Symphony values agreed to within 1% of the TG-43 and VariSeed values for r > 1 cm. The volume calculations obtained from the MIM Symphony TPS for the CIRS Brachytherapy QA Phantom were within 1% of the actual volume of the phantom. For the clinical cases, the volume and dosimetric parameter calculations for the prostate and rectum did not differ substantially between the pre-implant and Day 30 plans. Overall, our investigations showed negligible differences in dosimetry calculations and planning parameters between the two TPSs. The tests done to check the performance of the MIM Symphony TPS, such as the library data, data transfer, isodose and DVH printout, were found to be satisfactory. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the MIM Symphony TPS can be used as an alternative to the VariSeed TPS for low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.""","""['Sandeep K Dhanesar', 'Tze Y Lim', 'Weiliang Du', 'Teresa L Bruno', 'Steven J Frank', 'Rajat J Kudchadker']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['A generic high-dose rate (192)Ir brachytherapy source for evaluation of model-based dose calculations beyond the TG-43 formalism.', 'Comparative study of permanent interstitial prostate brachytherapy post-implant evaluation among seven Italian institutes.', 'Influence of source batch S dispersion on dosimetry for prostate cancer treatment with permanent implants.', 'Importance of post-implant dosimetry in permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Comprehensive methodology for commissioning modern 3D-image-based treatment planning systems for high dose rate gynaecological brachytherapy: A review.', 'A review of brachytherapy physical phantoms developed over the last 20 years: clinical purpose and future requirements.', 'End-to-end unsupervised cycle-consistent fully convolutional network for 3D pelvic CT-MR deformable registration.', 'Single institution implementation of permanent 131Cs interstitial brachytherapy for previously irradiated patients with resectable recurrent head and neck carcinoma.', 'Development of a magnetic resonance imaging protocol to visualize encapsulated contrast agent markers in prostate brachytherapy recipients: initial patient experience.']"""

Twenty consecutive patients were selected for this study; ten patients were implanted with 0.4 U seeds and the next ten patients implanted with 0.7 U seeds. Postimplant dosimetry for the target volume, urethra, and rectal wall was compared between the two groups. Our data showed a small and insignificant decrease in the total theatre time when implanting seeds of higher strength. The mean number of seeds required per implant decreased by over 30% for the 0.7 U implants, and the mean number of needles decreased by eight needles.

Methods:   A national cross-sectional survey of gay PCa survivors was conducted in 2010-2011. To be eligible for the study, men needed to be age 50 or older, reside in the United States, self-identify as gay, able to read, write, and speak English, and to have been treated for PCa at least 1 year ago. One hundred eleven men returned surveys.  Results:   After simultaneously adjusting for the factors in our model, men aged 50-64 years and men aged 65-74 years reported lower masculine self-esteem scores than men aged 75 years or older. Lower scores were also reported by men who reported recent severe stigma. Men who reported feeling comfortable revealing their sexual orientation to their doctor reported higher masculine self-esteem scores than men who were not. The mental component score from the SF-12 was also positively correlated with masculine self-esteem.  Conclusion:   PCa providers are in a position to reduce feelings of stigma and promote resiliency by being aware that they might have gay patients, creating a supportive environment where gay patients can discuss specific sexual concerns, and engaging patients in treatment decisions. These efforts could help not only in reducing stigma but also in increasing masculine self-esteem, thus greatly influencing gay patients' recovery, quality of life, and compliance with follow-up care.""","""['Donald Allensworth-Davies', 'James A Talcott', 'Timothy Heeren', 'Brian de Vries', 'Thomas O Blank', 'Jack A Clark']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""LGBT Health""","""['The impact of hegemonic masculine ideals on self-esteem in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to ADT-naïve patients.', 'The impact of sexual orientation on body image, self-esteem, urinary and sexual functions in the experience of prostate cancer.', 'A cross-sectional study on demoralization in prostate cancer patients: the role of masculine self-esteem, depression, and resilience.', 'Prostatic irradiation-induced sexual dysfunction: A review and multidisciplinary guide to management in the radical radiotherapy era (Part III on Psychosexual Therapy and the Masculine Self-Esteem).', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Sexual health and treatment-related sexual dysfunction in sexual and gender minorities with prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer in Sexual Minorities: Epidemiology, Screening and Diagnosis, Treatment, and Quality of Life.', 'Racial/Ethnic Differences in Health-Related Quality of Life Among Gay and Bisexual Prostate Cancer Survivors.', 'Recruiting an underserved, difficult to reach population into a cancer trial: Strategies from the Restore-2 Rehabilitation Trial for gay and bisexual prostate cancer patients.', 'A systematic review of disease related stigmatization in patients living with prostate cancer.']"""

Herein, we investigated whether berberine delayed the progression of castrate-resistant prostate cancer by reducing androgen synthesis through the inhibition of Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3. Cell viability and cellular testosterone content were measured in prostate cancer cells. Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 mRNA and protein level were detected by RT-PCR and Western bolt analyses, respectively. Computer analysis with AutoDock Tools explored the molecular interaction of berberine with Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3. We found that berberine inhibited 22Rv1 cells proliferation and decreased cellular testosterone formation in a dose-dependent manner. Berberine inhibited Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 enzyme activity, rather than influenced mRNA and protein expressions. Molecular docking study demonstrated that berberine could enter the active center of Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 and form p-p interaction with the amino-acid residue Phe306 and Phe311. In conclusion, the structural interaction of berberine with Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 is attributed to the suppression of Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 enzyme activity and the inhibition of 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell growth by decreasing the intracellular androgen synthesis. Our result provides the experimental basis for the design, research, and development of AKR1C3 inhibitors using berberine as the lead compound.""","""['Yuantong Tian', 'Lijing Zhao', 'Ye Wang', 'Haitao Zhang', 'Duo Xu', 'Xuejian Zhao', 'Yi Li', 'Jing Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Overexpression of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) in LNCaP cells diverts androgen metabolism towards testosterone resulting in resistance to the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride.', 'Hydroxytriazole derivatives as potent and selective aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) inhibitors discovered by bioisosteric scaffold hopping approach.', 'Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) is a biomarker and therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibitors of type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C3): overview and structural insights.', 'Utilizing mixture design response surface methodology to determine effective combinations of plant derived compounds as prostate cancer treatments.', 'siAKR1C3@PPA complex nucleic acid nanoparticles inhibit castration-resistant prostate cancer in vitro.', 'Computational modeling studies reveal the origin of the binding preference of 3-(3,4-di hydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-ylsulfonyl)benzoic acids for AKR1C3 over its isoforms.', 'Clinical Efficacy Analysis of Biofeedback Electrical Stimulation Combined with Doxycycline in the Treatment of Type IIIA Chronic Prostatitis.', 'Berberine: An Important Emphasis on Its Anticancer Effects through Modulation of Various Cell Signaling Pathways.']"""

It has been shown that SUV normalized to the area under the blood activity concentration curve (SUVAUC) provides a better correlation with full kinetic analysis than does standard SUV. However, the precision of SUVAUC is not known yet. The purpose of this study was to assess the repeatability of various semiquantitative (18)F-fluoromethylcholine parameters in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Twelve patients (mean age ± SD, 64 ± 8 y) with metastasized prostate cancer underwent two sets of (18)F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT scans, on consecutive days. Each set consisted of a 30-min dynamic PET/CT scan of the chest after intravenous administration of 200 MBq of (18)F-fluoromethylcholine, followed by a whole-body PET/CT scan at 40 min. The dynamic scan was used to derive the area under the blood activity concentration curve. Lesion uptake was derived from the whole-body scan using various types of volumes of interest: maximum, peak, and mean. Each of these parameters was normalized to injected activity per body weight, area under the blood activity concentration curve, and blood concentration itself at 40 min, resulting in several types of SUVs: SUV, SUVAUC, and SUVTBR The test-retest repeatability of these metrics, as well as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total uptake of choline in the lesion, were studied. The level of agreement between test-retest data and reliability was assessed using Bland-Altman plots, repeatability coefficients, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).  Results:   A total of 67 choline-avid metastases were identified: 44 bone lesions and 23 lymph node lesions. In the case of SUVmax, the repeatability coefficients for SUV, SUVAUC, and SUVTBR were 26% (ICC, 0.95), 31% (ICC, 0.95), and 46% (ICC, 0.89), respectively. Similar values were obtained for SUVpeak and SUVmean The repeatability of SUVAUC was comparable to that of SUVmax, SUVpeak, and SUVmean. Tissue type and tumor localization did not affect repeatability. An MTV of less than 4.2 cm(3) had larger variability than larger volumes (repeatability coefficient, 45% vs. 29%; P = 0.048). The repeatability coefficient did not significantly differ between lesions with SUVpeak above or below the median value of 8.3 (19% vs. 28%; P = 0.264).  Conclusion:   The repeatability of SUVAUC was comparable to that of standard SUV. The repeatability coefficients of various semiquantitative (18)F-fluoromethylcholine parameters (SUV, MTV, and total uptake in the lesion) were approximately 35%.

For this purpose, human prostate cancer PC3 cells were transfected with the luciferase gene fused with an oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD-luc) and a variant of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Both ODD-luciferase and EGFP were under the promotion of a poly-hypoxia-response element sequence (5xHRE). The cells constitutively expressed tdTomato red fluorescent protein. For validating the imaging strategy, cells were incubated under hypoxia (1% O2) for 48 hours and then reoxygenated. The luciferase activity of PC3-HRE-EGFP/HRE-ODD-luc/tdtomato cells detected by bioluminescent imaging rapidly decreased after reoxygenation, whereas EGFP levels in these cells remained stable for several hours. After in vitro validation, PC3-HRE-EGFP/HRE-ODD-luc/tdtomato tumors were implanted subcutaneously and orthotopically in nude male mice and imaged in vivo and ex vivo using optical imaging in proof-of-principle studies to demonstrate differences in optical patterns between EGFP expression and bioluminescence. This novel ""timer"" imaging strategy of combining the short-lived ODD-luciferase and the long-lived EGFP can provide a time frame of HRE activation in PC3 prostate cancer cells and will be useful to understand the temporal changes in hypoxia and HIF activity during cancer progression and following treatments including HIF targeting strategies.""","""['Pierre Danhier', 'Balaji Krishnamachary', 'Santosh Bharti', 'Samata Kakkad', 'Yelena Mironchik', 'Zaver M Bhujwalla']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Hypoxia Patterns in Primary and Metastatic Prostate Cancer Environments.', 'Hypoxia regulates choline kinase expression through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha signaling in a human prostate cancer model.', 'Hypoxia-Induced Reporter Genes with Different Half-Lives.', 'Imaging of the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway: insights into oxygen sensing.', 'Imaging molecular pathways: reporter genes.', 'Preclinical Identification Of Tumor-Draining Lymph Nodes Using a Multimodal Non-invasive In vivo Imaging Approach.', 'Single-cell RNA sequencing and lineage tracing confirm mesenchyme to epithelial transformation (MET) contributes to repair of the endometrium at menstruation.', 'Selective transduction of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons using delivery of AAV-PHP.eB and AAVrh10 vectors at axonal terminal locations.', 'Neuron-specific translational control shift ensures proteostatic resilience during ER stress.', 'Ocular Hypertension Results in Hypoxia within Glia and Neurons throughout the Visual Projection.']"""

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analysed the secondary care records of 23 735 patients who underwent robot-assisted (RARP, n = 8 016), laparoscopic (LRP, n = 6 776) or open radical prostatectomy (ORP, n = 8 943). We further analysed 2 173 patients who underwent robot-assisted (RAPN, n = 365), laparoscopic (LPN, n = 792) or open partial nephrectomy (OPN, n = 1 016). Postoperative inpatient admissions, hospital bed-days, excess bed-days and outpatient appointments at 360 and 1 080 days after surgery were reviewed.  Results:   Patients in the RARP group required significantly fewer inpatient admissions, hospital bed-days and excess bed-days at 360 and 1 080 days than patients undergoing ORP. Patients undergoing ORP had a significantly higher number of outpatient appointments at 1 080 days. The corresponding total costs were significantly lower for patients in the RARP group at 360 days (£1679 vs £2031 for ORP; P < 0.001) and at 1 080 days (£3461 vs £4208 for ORP; P < 0.001). In partial nephrectomy, Patients in the RAPN group required significantly fewer inpatient admissions and hospital bed-days at 360 days compared with those in the OPN group; no significant differences were observed in outcomes at 1 080 days. The corresponding total costs were lower for patients in the RAPN group at 360 days (£779 vs £1242 for OPN, P = 0.843) and at 1 080 days (£2122 vs £2889 for ORP; P = 0.570). For both procedure types, resource utilisation and costs for laparoscopic surgeries lay at the approximate midpoint of those for robot-assisted and open surgeries.  Conclusion:   Our analysis provides compelling evidence to suggest that RARP leads to reduced long-term health resource utilisation and downstream cost savings compared with traditional open and laparoscopic approaches. Furthermore, despite the limitations that arise from the inclusion of a small sample, these results also suggest that robot-assisted surgery may represent a cost-saving alternative to existing surgical options in partial nephrectomy.

FrA revealed high efficacy in human prostate cancer cells, while non-malignant cells were less sensitive. Remarkably, proliferation and colony formation of cells resistant to enzalutamide and abiraterone (due to the androgen receptor splice variant AR-V7) were also significantly inhibited by FrA. The marine compound caused cell type specific cell cycle arrest and induction of caspase-dependent or -independent apoptosis. Up-regulation or induction of several pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bad, PTEN), cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (survivin and Bcl-2) were detected in treated cells. Global proteome analysis revealed regulation of proteins involved in formation of metastases, tumor cell invasion, and apoptosis, like keratin 81, CrkII, IL-1β and cathepsin B. Inhibition of pro-survival autophagy was observed following FrA exposure. In vivo, FrA inhibited tumor growth of PC-3 and DU145 cells with a notable reduction of lung metastasis, as well as circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood.

We used a microsimulation model (MISCAN) of the natural history of prostate cancer based on ERSPC data. Individual life histories are simulated with US comorbidity lifetables based on a random sample of MEDICARE data. Different screening histories are simulated and we count outcomes for men screen-detected from ages 66 to 72. For immediately treated men with low-risk disease (≤ T2a, Gleason 6) the probability of overtreatment ranges from 61% to 86% decreasing to between 37 and 46%, if they are assigned to AS. For intermediate risk men (≤ T2, Gleason 3 + 4) overtreatment ranges from 23 to 60%, which reduces to between 16 and 31% for AS. For high risk men (T3, or ≥ Gleason 4 + 3), overtreatment ranges from 11 to 51%. The disease stage at screen-detection is a critical risk factor for overtreatment. For low risk men, AS seems to significantly reduce overtreatment at a modest cost. For intermediate risk men, the decision between immediate treatment or AS depends on age and comorbidity status.

We proposed that targeting AR expression versus its function would work in cells having either wild type or mutant AR as well as be independent of androgen synthesis pathways. Previously, using a phenotypic screen in androgen-independent PC cells we identified a small molecule inhibitor of AR, ARTIK-52. Treatment with ARTIK-52 caused the loss of AR protein and death of AR-positive, but not AR-negative, PC cells. Here we present data that ARTIK-52 induces degradation of AR mRNA through a mechanism that we were unable to establish. However, we found that ARTIK-52 is toxic to breast cancer (BC) cells expressing AR, although they were not sensitive to AR knockdown, suggesting an AR-independent mechanism of toxicity. Using different approaches we detected that ARTIK-52 induces replication-dependent double strand DNA breaks exclusively in cancer cells of prostate and breast origin, while not causing DNA damage, or any toxicity, in normal cells, as well as in non-PC and non-BC tumor cells, independent of their proliferation status. This amazing specificity, combined with such a basic mechanism of toxicity, makes ARTIK-52 a potentially useful tool to discover novel attractive targets for the treatment of BC and PC. Thus, phenotypic screening allowed us to identify a compound, whose properties cannot be predicted based on existing knowledge and moreover, uncover a barely known link between AR and DNA damage response in PC and BC epithelial cells.""","""['Daria Fleyshman', 'Peter Cheney', 'Anda Ströse', 'Shaila Mudambi', 'Alfiya Safina', 'Mairead Commane', 'Andrei Purmal', 'Kelsey Morgan', 'Nicholas J Wang', 'Joe Gray', 'Paul T Spellman', 'Natalia Issaeva', 'Katerina Gurova']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Identification of an anabolic selective androgen receptor modulator that actively induces death of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Small molecule screening reveals a transcription-independent pro-survival function of androgen receptor in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Triggers the Pro-Migratory CXCL12/CXCR4 Axis in AR-Positive Breast Cancer Cell Lines: Underlying Mechanism and Possible Implications for the Use of Aromatase Inhibitors in Breast Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', ""Androgen receptor in breast cancer: A wolf in sheep's clothing?

DNA damage generally activates a p53-mediated pathway to initiate apoptosis by increasing the level of the BH3-only protein, Puma. However, p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage has not yet been validated in prostate cancers. In the current study, we used LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells, representing wild type p53 and a p53-null model, to determine if DNA damage activates p53-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancers. Our results revealed that PC3 cells were 4 to 8-fold less sensitive than LNCaP cells to doxorubicin-inuced apoptosis. We proved that the differential response of LNCaP and PC3 to doxorubicin was p53-independent by introducing wild-type or dominant negative p53 into PC3 or LNCaP cells, respectively. By comparing several apoptosis-related proteins in both cell lines, we found that Bcl-xl proteins were much more abundant in PC3 cells than in LNCaP cells. We further demonstrated that Bcl-xl protects LNCaP and PC3 cells from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by using ABT-263, an inhibitor of Bcl-xl, as a single agent or in combination with doxorubicin to treat LNCaP or PC3 cells. Bcl-xl rather than p53, likely contributes to the differential response of LNCaP and PC3 to doxorubicin in apoptosis.

The use of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers of diseases and drug responses (i.e., significant differences of personal genomes of patients from the reference human genome) can help physicians to improve treatment. Clinical research can validate SNP markers via genotyping of patients and demonstration that SNP alleles are significantly more frequent in patients than in healthy people. The search for biomedical SNP markers of interest can be accelerated by computer-based analysis of hundreds of millions of SNPs in the 1000 Genomes project because of selection of the most meaningful candidate SNP markers and elimination of neutral SNPs.  Results:   We cross-validated the output of two computer-based methods: DNA sequence analysis using Web service SNP_TATA_Comparator and keyword search for articles on comorbidities of obesity. Near the sites binding to TATA-binding protein (TBP) in human gene promoters, we found 22 obesity-related candidate SNP markers, including rs10895068 (male breast cancer in obesity); rs35036378 (reduced risk of obesity after ovariectomy); rs201739205 (reduced risk of obesity-related cancers due to weight loss by diet/exercise in obese postmenopausal women); rs183433761 (obesity resistance during a high-fat diet); rs367732974 and rs549591993 (both: cardiovascular complications in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus); rs200487063 and rs34104384 (both: obesity-caused hypertension); rs35518301, rs72661131, and rs562962093 (all: obesity); and rs397509430, rs33980857, rs34598529, rs33931746, rs33981098, rs34500389, rs63750953, rs281864525, rs35518301, and rs34166473 (all: chronic inflammation in comorbidities of obesity). Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay under nonequilibrium conditions, we empirically validated the statistical significance (α < 0.00025) of the differences in TBP affinity values between the minor and ancestral alleles of 4 out of the 22 SNPs: rs200487063, rs201381696, rs34104384, and rs183433761.

PKC/Raf-1/ERK activation has also been implicated in drug resistance. In the current study, we assessed the effects of silodosin on ELK1 expression/activity in bladder cancer cells as well as on their proliferation in the presence or absence of chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin and gemcitabine. In bladder cancer cell lines, silodosin reduced the expression of ELK1 (mRNA/protein) and its downstream target, c-fos gene, as well as the transcriptional activity of ELK1. While silodosin alone (up to 10 μM) insignificantly affected the growth of bladder cancer cells cultured in androgen depleted conditions or those expressing ELK1-short hairpin RNA, it considerably inhibited the viability of androgen receptor (AR)-positive/ELK1-positive cells in the presence of androgens. Silodosin also inhibited the migration of ELK1-positive cells with or without a functional AR, but not that of ELK1 knockdown cells. Interestingly, silodosin treatment or ELK1 silencing resulted in increases in drug sensitivity to cisplatin, but not to gemcitabine, even in AR-negative cells or AR-positive cells cultured in an androgen-depleted condition. In addition, silodosin decreased the expression of NF-κB, a key regulator of chemoresistance, and its transcriptional activity. Moreover, immunohistochemistry in bladder cancer specimens from patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy revealed that phospho-ELK1 positivity strongly correlated with chemoresistance. Silodosin was thus found to not only inhibit cell viability and migration but also enhance the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin in bladder cancer lines via inactivating ELK1.

While T2E-positive and T2E-negative tumors represent specific molecular subtypes of prostate cancer (PCa), previous studies have not yet comprehensively investigated how these tumor subtypes differ at the epigenetic level. We therefore investigated epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles of PCa stratified by T2E status.  Results:   The study included 496 patients with clinically localized PCa who had a radical prostatectomy as primary treatment for PCa. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ""break-apart"" assays were used to determine tumor T2E-fusion status, which showed that 266 patients (53.6 %) had T2E-positive PCa. The study showed global DNA methylation differences between tumor subtypes. A large number of differentially methylated CpG sites were identified (false-discovery rate [FDR] Q-value <0.00001; n = 27,876) and DNA methylation profiles accurately distinguished between tumor T2E subgroups. A number of top-ranked differentially methylated CpGs in genes (FDR Q-values ≤1.53E-29) were identified: C3orf14, CACNA1D, GREM1, KLK10, NT5C, PDE4D, RAB40C, SEPT9, and TRIB2, several of which had a corresponding alteration in mRNA expression.

CEP57 is involved in intracellular transport processes, and its overexpression causes mitotic defects as well as abnormal microtubule nucleation and bundling. In the present study, we further characterized the prognostic and functional role of CEP57 in prostate cancer. Unexpectedly, we found that high CEP57 expression is an independent prognostic factor for a more favorable biochemical recurrence-free survival in two large patient cohorts. To reconcile this finding with the ability of CEP57 to cause cell division errors and thus potentially promote malignant progression, we hypothesized that alterations of microtubule-associated transport processes, in particular nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor (AR), may play a role in our finding. However, CEP57 overexpression and microtubule bundling had, surprisingly, no effect on the nuclear translocation of the AR. Instead, we found a significant increase of cells with disarranged microtubules and a cellular morphology suggestive of a cytokinesis defect. Because mitotic dysfunction leads to a reduced daughter cell formation, it can explain the survival benefit of patients with increased CEP57 expression. In contrast, we show that a reduced expression of CEP57 is associated with malignant growth and metastasis. Taken together, our findings underscore that high CEP57 expression is associated with mitotic impairment and less aggressive tumor behavior. Because the CEP57-induced microtubule stabilization had no detectable effect on AR nuclear translocation, our results furthermore suggest that microtubule-targeting therapeutics used in advanced prostate cancer such as docetaxel may have modes of action that are at least in part independent of AR transport inhibition.""","""['Josef Mang', 'Nina Korzeniewski', 'Dimo Dietrich', 'Verena Sailer', 'Yanis Tolstov', 'Sam Searcy', 'Jost von Hardenberg', 'Sven Perner', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Alexander Marx', 'Wilfried Roth', 'Esther Herpel', 'Carsten Grüllich', 'Valentin Popeneciu', 'Sascha Pahernik', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Stefan Duensing']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Transl Oncol""","""['FGF-2 disrupts mitotic stability in prostate cancer through the intracellular trafficking protein CEP57.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'The Cep57-pericentrin module organizes PCM expansion and centriole engagement.', 'CEP57 mutation in a girl with mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Small and Large Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Pleural Mesothelioma Cell Lines Offer Biomarker Potential.', 'A Functional Yeast-Based Screen Identifies the Host Microtubule Cytoskeleton as a Target of Numerous Chlamydia pneumoniae Proteins.', 'Identification of F-Box/SPRY Domain-Containing Protein 1 (FBXO45) as a Prognostic Biomarker for TMPRSS2-ERG-Positive Primary Prostate Cancers.', 'Downstream Neighbor of SON (DONSON) Expression Is Enhanced in Phenotypically Aggressive Prostate Cancers.', 'Mosaic-variegated aneuploidy syndrome mutation or haploinsufficiency in Cep57 impairs tumor suppression.']"""

Methods:   From June 2004 to March 2014, a total of 232 cases (pT3-4N0-1M0) including 160 locally advanced PCa and 72 LN metastatic PCa who received immediate androgen deprivation therapy after LRP plus ePLND were enrolled onto our study. The patients were followed up for 12 to 124 months. Surgical records, surgical margin status, complications, urinary continence, and oncologic outcomes were presented.  Results:   The mean operation time and bleeding were 230 minutes and 105 mL, respectively. The rates of urinary continence were 91.4% and 94.8% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. We observed 122 biochemical recurrent cases. The 5- and 8-year biochemical relapse-free survival rates were 47.3% and 46.7%, respectively. The 5- and 8-year overall and cancer-specific survivals were 81.2%, 80.1%, 90.6%, and 90.6%, respectively. The survival analysis showed that biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were significantly lower for patients with higher Gleason score (77.3% vs. 39.6% vs. 30.8%, P = .003 log rank), higher T stage (55.7% vs. 41.4% vs. 21.4%, P = .039 log rank), positive surgical margin (51.1% vs. 29.3%, P = .000 log rank), and higher CAPRA-S score (68.6% vs. 35.0% vs. 29.2%, P = .000 log rank).

It is debated whether care in the chronic phase of cancer can be positioned in primary care due to doubts about capacity and workload.  Objective:   To estimate GPs' extra consultation time if they assume responsibility for the care in the chronic phase of cancer.  Method:   Retrospective cohort study. Estimation of extra consultation time by quantifying prevalence, incidence, survival, number of chronic cancer patients, current practice contacts and registration of risk factors in patients with all types of cancers.  Results:   The most prevalent types of cancer (with 5-year survival rates) are as follows: breast cancer (91.5%), colorectal cancer (63.8%), prostate cancer (78.3%), melanoma (91.9%) and bladder and urinary tract cancer (77.3%). Primary care practices include ~32 chronic cancer patients, with a potential extra consultation time of ~19 hours per year per 1000 patients. One-third (35%) are already in a chronic disease management programme and 57% were diagnosed >5 years ago. Registration of risk factors for cancer is incomplete, but of better quality when comorbidity is present.  Conclusion:   Numbers of chronic cancer patients and possible time investment by primary care professionals in the case of a substitution scenario should not be a limiting factor for transition of follow-up from secondary to primary care, as most of the patients were diagnosed >5 years ago and a large proportion of these patients are already monitored in an existing chronic care programme.""","""['C van Dipten', 'T C Olde Hartman', 'M C J Biermans', 'W J J Assendelft']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Fam Pract""","""['Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', ""Does the attention General Practitioners pay to their patients' mental health problems add to their workload?

Methods:   Twenty-seven patients with median age of 71 years (range 48-80) who underwent repeat CA between April 2003 and April 2011 at a single institution were included. The median initial prostate-specific antigens (PSA) and Gleason values were 6.2 ng/ml (range 4-23.6) and 7 (range 6-9), respectively. Twenty-four patients underwent two CA treatments, and three patients underwent three CA treatments. Pre- and perioperative parameters and oncological and functional outcomes were evaluated.  Results:   No intraoperative complications occurred. After the first CA, PSA was undetectable in 10 patients, and the median nadir PSA value was 0.65 ng/ml (range 0.1-4.9). After the second CA, 4 patients had undetectable PSA, and the median nadir PSA value was 1.25 ng/ml (range 0.2-7.9). For patients who underwent a third CA treatment, no patients had undetectable PSA, and the subsequent median nadir PSA value was 1.6 ng/ml (range 0.4-4.5). Two patients had incontinence (1 pad per day) following repeat CA. One patient had urinary retention after the third CA treatment, and one had urethral stricture. The mean hospitalization and follow-up periods were 1 day (range 0-2) and 51.5 months (range 11-96), respectively.

Cyclin D1 deregulated expression in PCa is associated with a more aggressive disease: however its role in radioresistance has not been determined. Cyclin D1 levels in the androgen-independent PC3 and 22Rv1 PCa cells were stably inhibited by infecting with cyclin D1-shRNA. Tumorigenicity and radiosensitivity were investigated using in vitro and in vivo experimental assays. Cyclin D1 silencing interfered with PCa oncogenic phenotype by inducing growth arrest in the G1 phase of cell cycle and reducing soft agar colony formation, migration, invasion in vitro and tumor formation and neo-angiogenesis in vivo. Depletion of cyclin D1 significantly radiosensitizes PCa cells by increasing the RT-induced DNA damages by affecting the NHEJ and HR pathways responsible of the DNA double-strand break repair. Following treatment of cells with RT the abundance of a biomarker of DNA damage, γ-H2AX, was dramatically increased in sh-cyclin D1 treated cells compared to shRNA control. Concordant with these observations DNA-PKcs-activation and RAD51-accumulation, part of the DNA double-strand break repair machinery, were reduced in shRNA-cyclin D1 treated cells compared to shRNA control. We further demonstrate the physical interaction between CCND1 with activated-ATM, -DNA-PKcs and RAD51 is enhanced by RT. Finally, siRNA-mediated silencing experiments indicated DNA-PKcs and RAD51 are downstream targets of CCND1-mediated PCa cells radioresistance.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed medical records of all patients with mCRPC who received sequential treatment with ARDT. We analyzed potential clinical factors associated with post treatment endpoints including 50% decline in prostatic-specific antigen (PSA), PSA-progression-free survival (PFS), clinical or radiographic PFS and overall survival (OS). Prognostic univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were developed and assessed.  Results:   One hundred twenty-six patients with mCRPC treated with a second-line novel ARDT were included. Overall, 50% decline in PSA was observed in 22% of patients and a median PSA-PFS of 2.9 months and a PFS of 3.6 months. After adjusting for potential confounders including prior exposure to docetaxel and number of prior antiandrogen agents, time to development of CRPC was an independent factor associated with PSA-PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-1; P = 0.02) and PFS (HR: 0.99; CI: 0.98-1; P= 0.01). PSA response (50% decline) to first-line novel ARDT correlated negatively with PSA-PFS with second-line novel ARDT (HR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.14-2.53; P = 0.009) and lower pre-treatment levels of albumin were associated with shorter PFS (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.32-0.97; P = 0.03). Performance status, pre-treatment levels of albumin, extent of disease and time to development CRPC were associated with OS.  Conclusions:   Second-line ARDT is associated with modest outcomes in patients with mCRPC. Time to development of CRPC is the strongest predictor of PSA response, PSA-PFS and OS which suggest that intrinsic resistance to AR directed treatment is the major treatment outcome factor in these patients. Future studies in patients receiving long term ARTD should include the identification of predictive biomarkers to facilitate treatment selection.""","""['Rosa Nadal', 'Hua-Ling Tsai', 'Victoria J Sinibaldi', 'Channing J Paller', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Sammuel R Denmeade', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Mario A Eisenberger']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Plasma Androgen Receptor and Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Sequencing impact and prognostic factors in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with cabazitaxel: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Chromogranin A: a useful biomarker in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Finding the optimal treatment sequence in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer-a narrative review.', 'Laboratory-wide association study of survival with prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide Versus Abiraterone as a First-Line Endocrine Therapy for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Protocol for a Multicenter Randomized Phase 3 Trial.', 'Baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts the prognosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with abiraterone acetate.', 'Effect of androgen receptor on IgG expression, proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells in vitro.']"""

The objective of the present work was to analyze the histological changes caused by meclofenamic acid in androgen-independent prostate cancer. Tumors were created in a nude mouse model using PC3 cancerous human cells. Meclofenamic acid (10 mg/kg/day; experimental group, n=5) or saline solution (control group, n=5) was administered intraperitoneally for twenty days. Histological analysis was then carried out on the tumors, describing changes in the cellular architecture, fibrosis, and quantification of cellular proliferation and tumor vasculature. Meclofenamic acid causes histological changes that indicate less tumor aggression (less hypercellularity, fewer atypical mitoses, and fewer nuclear polymorphisms), an increase in fibrosis, and reduced cellular proliferation and tumor vascularity.

Collectively, 81 tissue samples including 45 human PCa and 36 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) specimens were included in the study. The tissue samples were subjected to RNA extraction and subsequently to cDNA synthesis according to the kit manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative Real-Time PCR assay was performed for each sample in triplicate reactions. REST and SPSS software were used to statistically analyze PTEN and NKX3.1 gene expression data. Expression level of both NKX3.1 and PTEN genes was down-regulated in PCa samples compared to BPH samples. The relative expression ratio of PTEN and NKX3.1 was decreased to 0.155 and 0.003, respectively (P=0.000). The results of Chi-Square analysis revealed a significant correlation between the expression of these genes in both BPH and cancer groups (P=0.004 and 0.001, respectively). According to previous studies and our data, we concluded that the association between the down-regulation of PTEN and NKX3.1 genes contributed to the prostate tumorigenesis.

Materials and methods:   PSA-AV was calculated by multiplying the patient's age by the prostate volume and dividing it by the PSA level. Sensitivities and specificities of the PSA-AV were assessed by retrospective analysis of findings from 4,717 prostate biopsies.  Results:   The population's average age was 63.71±7.63 years, the mean PSA level was 9.73±17.01ng/mL, the mean prostate volume was 44.46±23.88 cm3. Of the 4,717 prostate biopsies, 1,171 biopsy specimens (24.8%) were positive for prostate cancer. A PSA-AV score of 700 had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 15%, respectively. These values were similar to the sensitivity and specificity for a PSA cut-off of 4ng/mL (94% and 13%, respectively). Although the sensitivity of a PSA-AV cut-off of 700 in patients over 60 years was similar to the PSA cut-off of 4ng/mL and the age-adjusted PSA, in patients < 60 years, its sensitivity was higher. While the sensitivities of a PSA-AV cut-off of 700 in patients with low prostate volume was higher than a PSA cut-off of 4ng/mL, the sensitivities of both methods with moderate prostate volumes were similar.  Conclusions:   Considering all the biopsies, the sensitivity and specificity of a PSA-AV of 700 for predicting positive biopsy findings were similar to a PSA of 4ng/mL.

However, the association is unclear for surgically-treated men. We studied the risk of prostate cancer recurrence and death by statin usage after radical prostatectomy in a cohort of prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   A cohort of 1,314 men who underwent curative-intent radical prostatectomy at the Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland during 1995-2009 were linked to national prescription database to obtain detailed information on statin purchases. The risk of PSA recurrence and death (overall and prostate cancer-specific) by statin use before and after the surgery were evaluated using Cox regression with model adjustment for tumor characteristics, total cholesterol and simultaneous use of antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs. Tissue expression of putative prognostic markers were measured from a subgroup of 323 men.  Results:   During the median follow-up of 8.6 years after surgery 484 men recurred, while 244 men died (32 due to prostate cancer). In general statin use before or after prostatectomy was not associated with risk of disease recurrence or death. Tissue expression of Ki-67 and ERG modified the association between statin use and risk of disease recurrence; the risk estimates were lower in men with Ki-67 expression above the median (P for interaction 0.001 and 0.004 for statin use before and after prostatectomy, respectively) and no ERG expression in the tumor tissue (P for interaction 0.006 and 0.011).  Conclusions:   Statin use generally did not affect prostate cancer prognosis after prostatectomy. The effect on disease recurrence may depend on tumor properties, such as proliferation activity. Thus possible future prospective studies should recognize and enroll subgroups of prostate cancer patients most likely to benefit from statins.""","""['Teemu Keskiväli', 'Paula Kujala', 'Tapio Visakorpi', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Teemu J Murtola']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Use of statins and prostate cancer recurrence among patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative Statin Use at the Time of Radical Prostatectomy Is Not Associated With Biochemical Recurrence or Pathologic Upgrading.', 'Influence of statin use on clinicopathological characteristics of localized prostate cancer and outcomes obtained after radical prostatectomy: a single center study.', 'A review of statin use and prostate cancer.', 'Statins and prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Statin Use Is Associated with Better Prognosis of Patients with Prostate Cancer after Definite Therapies: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.', 'Statin Use and the Risk of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence Following Definitive Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.', 'The Effects of Statins on Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy or Definitive Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Population-wide impacts of aspirin, statins, and metformin use on prostate cancer incidence and mortality.', 'Impact of statin use on cancer-specific mortality and recurrence: A meta-analysis of 60 observational studies.']"""

Methods:   Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the expression profiles of 21 prostate cancer-associated genes in the human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP, using the nontumorigenic cell line PWR-1E as control cell line. Genes evaluated were ESM-1, SERPINE2, CLU, BGN, A2M, PENK, FMOD, CD81, DCN, TSPAN8, KBTBD10, F2RL1, TMSB4X, SNCG, CXXC5, FOXQ1, PDPN, SPN, CAV1, CD24 and KLK3. A potential biomarker from this set of genes, the FMOD gene, encoding the small leucine-rich proteoglycan fibromodulin, was selected for further evaluation in clinical samples from patients diagnosed with benign or malignant prostatic disease.  Results:   Several of the evaluated genes showed significantly altered expression in the prostate cancer cell lines, compared with nontumorigenic PWR-1E cells. Further evaluation of FMOD transcript in prostate clinical samples from patients diagnosed with benign or malignant prostatic disease identified a significant difference in the expression levels of this proteoglycan between benign and malignant tissue (p&lt;0.05).  Conclusions:   A number of gene transcripts were differentially expressed by the cell lines assayed.

The lateral separations of the subjects were also measured. The Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine if the IQ was associated with the exposure level. We used the point-biserial correlation and a χ(2) test to investigate the relationship between the separation and IQ.  Results:   The Friedman test showed that the IQ was related to exposure (p = 2 × 10(-7)) and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrated that the IQ decreased as exposure decreased (all p-values <0.005). We did not find a correlation between the IQ and the separation (correlation coefficient 0.045), but for separations <35 cm, it was possible to use the lowest exposure parameters studied.  Conclusion:   We can reduce exposure factors to 80% of those supplied with the system without hindering the matching process for all patients. For patients with lateral separations <35 cm, the exposure factors can be reduced further to 64% of the original values.

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) based screening for PCa is controversial and large trials have failed to show a significant reduction in prostate-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Considering the contradictory data on PCa screening, current guidelines emphasize shared decision making. Physicians are the ones in charge of helping patients with informed decision making, so we conducted this study to find out what urologists would do for themselves as patients.  Materials and methods:   Urologists attending the 15th congress of Iranian Urological Association were invited to participate in a questionnaire-based survey on PCa screening. A total of 184 physicians completed the questionnaire.  Results:   Of participants 76.8% declared that they would like to be screened. 69.3% of those in favor of screening did not consider digital rectal examination (DRE) as part of their screening program. 62.8% of the urologists willing to be screened chose serial PSA as their follow up method in case their PSA level came above normal ranges, and 35.8% preferred to be biopsied.  Conclusion:   Urologists tend to prefer PSA screening despite the current controversy about its usefulness. Most of the urologists practicing in Iran do not choose DRE as part of their screening program.

Our prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted nanoplex is designed to deliver plasmid DNA encoding tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), together with bacterial cytosine deaminase (bCD) as a prodrug enzyme. Nanoplex specificity was tested using two variants of human PC3 prostate cancer cells in culture and in tumor xenografts, one with high PSMA expression and the other with negligible expression levels. The expression of EGFP-TRAIL was demonstrated by fluorescence optical imaging and real-time PCR. Noninvasive (19)F MR spectroscopy detected the conversion of the nontoxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by bCD. The combination strategy of TRAIL gene and 5-FC/bCD therapy showed significant inhibition of the growth of prostate cancer cells and tumors.

The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term survival patterns in young patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) for HRPCa.  Materials and methods:   Within a multiinstitutional cohort, 600 young patients (≤59 years) treated with RP between 1987 and 2012 for HRPCa (defined as at least one of the following adverse characteristics: prostate specific antigen>20, cT3 or higher, biopsy Gleason sum 8-10) were identified. Smoothed cumulative incidence plot was performed to assess cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other cause mortality (OCM) rates at 10, 15, and 20 years after RP. The same analyses were performed to assess the 5-year probability of CSM and OCM in patients who survived 5, 10, and 15 years after RP. A multivariable competing risk regression model was fitted to identify predictors of CSM and OCM.  Results:   The 10-, 15- and 20-year CSM and OCM rates were 11.6% and 5.5% vs. 15.5% and 13.5% vs. 18.4% and 19.3%, respectively. The 5-year probability of CSM and OCM rates among patients who survived at 5, 10, and 15 years after RP, were 6.4% and 2.7% vs. 4.6% and 9.6% vs. 4.2% and 8.2%, respectively. Year of surgery, pathological stage and Gleason score, surgical margin status and lymph node invasion were the major determinants of CSM (all P≤0.03). Conversely, none of the covariates was significantly associated with OCM (all P≥ 0.09).  Conclusions:   Very long-term cancer control in young high-risk patients after RP is highly satisfactory. The probability of dying from PCa in young patients is the leading cause of death during the first 10 years of survivorship after RP. Thereafter, mortality not related to PCa became the main cause of death.

Methods:   The 2008 to 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data were used to identify colorectal (n = 540), female breast (n = 1568), and prostate (n = 1170) cancer survivors and individuals without a cancer history (n = 109 423). Excess economic burden attributable to cancer included per-person excess annual medical expenditures and productivity losses (employment disability, missed work days, and days stayed in bed). All analyses were stratified by cancer site and age (nonelderly: 18-64 years vs elderly: ≥ 65 years). Multivariable analyses controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, number of comorbidities, and geographic region. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Compared with individuals without a cancer history, cancer survivors experienced annual excess medical expenditures (for the nonelderly population, colorectal: $8647, 95% confidence interval [CI] = $4932 to $13 974, P < .001; breast: $5119, 95% CI = $3439 to $7158, P < .001; prostate: $3586, 95% CI = $1792 to $6076, P < .001; for the elderly population, colorectal: $4913, 95% CI = $2768 to $7470, P < .001; breast: $2288, 95% CI = $814 to $3995, P = .002; prostate: $3524, 95% CI = $1539 to $5909, P < .001). Nonelderly colorectal and breast cancer survivors experienced statistically significant annual excess employment disability (13.6%, P < .001, and 4.8%, P = .001) and productivity loss at work (7.2 days, P < .001, and 3.3 days, P = .002) and at home (4.5 days, P < .001, and 3.3 days, P = .003). In contrast, elderly survivors of all three cancer sites had comparable productivity losses as those without a cancer history.  Conclusions:   Colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors experienced statistically significantly higher economic burden compared with individuals without a cancer history; however, excess economic burden varies by cancer site and age.

Understanding how and why patients make their treatment decisions, as well as the effect of treatment choice on long-term outcomes, is critical to ensuring effective, patient-centered care. This study examined treatment decision-making in a racially diverse, equal-access, contemporary cohort of patients with PCa counseled on treatment options at a multidisciplinary clinic.  Methods:   A prospective cohort study was initiated at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (formerly Walter Reed Army Medical Center) in 2006. Newly diagnosed patients with PCa were enrolled before attending a multidisciplinary clinic. Patients completed surveys preclinic and postclinic to assess treatment preferences, reasons for treatment choice, and decisional regret.  Results:   As of January 2014, 925 patients with PCa enrolled in this study. Surgery (54%), external radiation (20%), and active surveillance (12%) were the most common primary treatments for patients with low- and intermediate-risk PCa, whereas patients with high-risk PCa chose surgery (34%) or external radiation with neoadjuvant hormones (57%). Treatment choice differed by age at diagnosis, race, comorbidity status, and calendar year in both univariable and multivariable analyses. Patients preferred to play an active role in the decision-making process and cited doctors at the clinic as the most helpful source of treatment-related information. Almost all patients reported satisfaction with their decision.

We assessed trajectories of body shape from age 5 up to 60 using a group-based modeling approach among 73,581 women from the Nurses' Health Study and 32,632 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. After a median of approximately 10 years of follow-up, we compared incidence of total and obesity-related cancers (cancers of the esophagus [adenocarcinoma only], colorectum, pancreas, breast [after menopause], endometrium, ovaries, prostate [advanced only], kidney, liver and gallbladder) between these trajectories. We identified five distinct trajectories of body shape: lean-stable, lean-moderate increase, lean-marked increase, medium-stable, and heavy-stable/increase. Compared with women in the lean-stable trajectory, those in the lean-marked increase and heavy-stable/increase trajectories had a higher cancer risk in the colorectum, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, and endometrium (relative risk [RR] ranged from 1.22 to 2.56). Early life adiposity was inversely while late life adiposity was positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk. In men, increased body fatness at any life period was associated with a higher risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer (RR ranged from 1.23 to 3.01), and the heavy-stable/increase trajectory was associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, but lower risk of advanced prostate cancer. The trajectory-cancer associations were generally stronger for non-smokers and women who did not use menopausal hormone therapy.

In this study, aspirin was shown to be an effective inhibitor of the growth of human prostate cancer cells. In order to investigate the link between polyamine catabolism and the effects of aspirin we used a ""Tet off"" system that induced the activity of spermidine/spermine N (1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) in human prostate cancer cells (LNCap). Treatment with aspirin was found to decrease induced SSAT activity in these cells. A negative correlation was observed between increased polyamine catabolism via increased SSAT activity and the sensitivity to aspirin. In the presence of increased SSAT activity high amounts of N (1)-acetylspermidine and putrescine were observed. These cells were also found to grow more slowly than the non-induced cells.

Interestingly, this has been shown to be associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms around regions 2 and 3 of the 8q24 human chromosomal region. The non-protein coding gene locus Plasmacytoma Variant Translocation 1 (PVT1) is located at 8q24 and is overexpressed in PCa and, therefore, is also a candidate biomarker to explain the well-known disparity in this group. PVT1 has at least 12 exons that make separate transcripts which may have different functions, all of which are at present unknown in PCa. Our aim was to determine if any PVT1 transcripts play a role in aggressiveness and racial disparity in PCa. We used a panel of seven PCa cell lines including three derived from MoAA. Ribonucleic acid extraction, complementary deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed to evaluate expression of all 12 PVT1 exons. Each qPCR was performed in quadruplicates. At least four separate qPCR experiments were performed. Expression of PVT1 exons was inconsistent except for exon 9. There was no significant difference in exon 9 expression between cell lines derived from Caucasian males (CM), and an indolent cell line derived from MoAA. However, exon 9 expression in the aggressive MDA PCa 2b and E006AA-hT cell lines derived from MoAA was significantly higher than in other cell lines.

Frizzled7 (Fzd7), the most important receptor of the Wnt signaling pathway, is extensively involved in cancer development and progression. However, the role of Fzd7 in prostate cancer remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the expression of Fzd7 in prostate cancer and test whether modulating Fzd7 expression by miR-613 would have an impact on prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. We found that Fzd7 was highly expressed in prostate cancer cell lines. Through bioinformatics analysis, Fzd7 was predicted as a target gene of miR-613, which was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assays, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. By gain of function experiments, we showed that overexpression of miR-613 significantly suppressed prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, miR-613 overexpression markedly downregulated the Wnt signaling pathway. Through a rescue experiment, we showed that overexpression of Fzd7 could abrogate the inhibitory effect of miR-613 on cell proliferation and invasion as well as Wnt signaling. Additionally, these results were further strengthened by data showing that miR-613 was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer tissues, exhibiting an inverse correlation with Fzd7 expression. In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-613 functions as a tumor suppressor, partially through targeting Fzd7, and is a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer.""","""['Wei Ren', 'Chan Li', 'Wanli Duan', 'Shuangkuan Du', 'Fan Yang', 'Jiancheng Zhou', 'Junping Xing']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['MicroRNA-485-5p represses melanoma cell invasion and proliferation by suppressing Frizzled7.', 'MicroRNA-504 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma through inhibiting Frizzled-7-mediated-Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'MicroRNA-142-3p inhibits cell proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells by targeting FZD7.', 'Unlocking the Wnt pathway: Therapeutic potential of selective targeting FZD7 in cancer.', ""Frizzled7: A Promising Achilles' Heel for Targeting the Wnt Receptor Complex to Treat Cancer."", 'miR-613 suppresses renal cell carcinoma proliferation, invasion and migration by regulating the AXL/AKT pathway.', 'The Key Role of microRNAs in Initiation and Progression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Exosome-Derived miRNAs as Potential Biomarkers for Prostate Bone Metastasis.', 'Circular RNA 0001823 aggravates the growth and metastasis of the cervical cancer cells through modulating the microRNA-613/RAB8A axis.', 'Non-Coding RNA and Frizzled Receptors in Cancer.']"""

EPIC sexual summary score was significantly better in the D+B group at pre-implant, 1 month, 3 months post-implant.  Conclusion:   Dutasteride and Bicalutamide is a regimen of non-inferior efficacy to LHRH agonist based regimens for prostate volume reduction prior to permanent implant prostate brachytherapy. D+B has less sexual toxicity compared to LHRH agonists prior to implant and for the first 6 months after implant.

Material and methods:   Data of 121 patients treated with adjuvant/salvage WPRT were analyzed (static-field IMRT n=19; VMAT/Rapidarc n=57; Tomotherapy n=45). Pelvic bone marrow (BM) was delineated as ilium (IL), lumbosacral, lower and whole pelvis (WP), and the relative DVHs were calculated.

The purpose of this study was to examine the prophylactic effect of a film dressing using Airwall on PBT-induced ARD compared with standard skin managements.  Methods and materials:   A total of 271 patients with prostate cancer who were scheduled for PBT at our center were divided into 2 groups based on their own requests: 145 patients (53%) chose Airwall (group A) and 126 patients (47%) received standard treatments (group B). We evaluated irradiated skin every other day during PBT and followed up once a week for a month after completion of PBT.  Results:   Grade 0, 1, 2, and 3 dermatitis were seen in 2, 122, 21, and 0 and 0, 65, 57, and 4 patients in groups A and B, respectively (P<.001).

There were no significant differences between the 2 groups. Eighteen patients (12%) in group A who experienced problems in the region covered with Airwall switched to standard skin care after peeling the film off.

However, evidence of screening benefit from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening trial and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer has been inconsistent, due partly to differences in noncompliance and contamination. Using system dynamics modeling, we replicated the PLCO trial and extrapolated follow-up to 20 years. We then simulated 3 scenarios correcting for contamination in the PLCO control arm using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) incidence and survival data collected prior to the PSA screening era (scenario 1), SEER data collected during the PLCO trial period (1993-2001) (scenario 2), and data from the European trial's control arm (1991-2005) (scenario 3). In all scenarios, noncompliance was corrected using incidence and survival rates for men with screen-detected cancer in the PLCO screening arm. Scenarios 1 and 3 showed a benefit of PSA screening, with relative risks of 0.62 (95% confidence interval: 0.53, 0.72) and 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.59, 0.83) for cancer-specific mortality after 20 years, respectively. In scenario 2, however, there was no benefit of screening. This simulation showed that after correcting for noncompliance and contamination, there is potential benefit of PSA screening in reducing prostate cancer mortality.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which sildenafil sensitizes DOX in killing of prostate cancer (PCa) cells, DU145. The death receptor Fas (APO-1 or CD95) induces apoptosis in many carcinoma cells, which is negatively regulated by anti-apoptotic molecules such as FLIP (Fas-associated death domain (FADD) interleukin-1-converting enzyme (FLICE)-like inhibitory protein). Co-treatment of PCa cells with sildenafil and DOX for 48 hours showed reduced expression of both long and short forms of FLIP (FLIP-L and -S) as compared to individual drug treatment. Over-expression of FLIP-s with an adenoviral vector attentuated the enhanced cell-killing effect of DOX and sildenafil. Colony formation assays also confirmed that FLIP-S over-expression inhibited the DOX and sildenafil-induced synergistic killing effect as compared to the cells infected with an empty vector. Moreover, siRNA knock-down of CD95 abolished the effect of sildenafil in enhancing DOX lethality in cells, but had no effect on cell killing after treatment with a single agent. Sildenafil co-treatment with DOX inhibited DOX-induced NF-κB activity by reducing phosphorylation of IκB and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit, in addition to down regulation of FAP-1 (Fas associated phosphatase-1, a known inhibitor of CD95-mediated apoptosis) expression.

Methods:   Sixty-four couples were randomly assigned to 6 months of partnered strength training (Exercising Together, N = 32) or usual care (UC, N = 32). Objective measures included body composition (lean, fat and trunk fat mass (kg), and % body fat) by DXA, upper and lower body muscle strength by 1-repetition maximum, and physical function by the physical performance battery (PPB). Self-reported measures included the physical and mental health summary scales and physical function and fatigue subscales of the SF-36 and physical activity with the CHAMPS questionnaire.  Results:   Couple retention rates were 100 % for Exercising Together and 84 % for UC. Median attendance of couples to Exercising Together sessions was 75 %.

Here, we demonstrate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulation of GV-PLA2 expression in different cell lines originating from leukaemia and solid cancers. In blood leukocytes from leukaemic patients, levels of GV-PLA2 transcripts were significantly lower in comparison to those from healthy individuals. Similarly, in DU-145 and PC-3 prostate and CAL-51 and MCF-7 mammary cancer cell lines, levels of GV-PLA2 transcripts were significantly lower in relation to those found in normal epithelial cells of prostate or mammary. By sequencing and methylation-specific high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) analyses of bisulphite-modified DNA, distinct CpG sites in the GV-PLA2 promoter region were identified that were differentially methylated in cancer cells in comparison to normal epithelial and endothelial cells. Spearman rank order analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the methylation degree and the cellular expression of GV-PLA2 (r = -0.697; p = 0.01). The effects of demethylating agent (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A) on GV-PLA2 transcription in the analysed cells confirmed the importance of DNA methylation and histone modification in the regulation of the GV-PLA2 gene expression in leukaemic, prostate and mammary cancer cell lines. The exposure of tumour cells to human recombinant GV-PLA2 resulted in a reduced colony forming activity of MCF-7, HepG2 and PC-3 cells, but not of DU-145 cells suggesting a cell-type-dependent effect of GV-PLA2 on cell growth. In conclusion, our results suggest that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification play an important role in downregulation of GV-PLA2 expression in cancer cells.""","""['Mario Menschikowski', 'Albert Hagelgans', 'Brit Nacke', 'Carsten Jandeck', 'Olga A Mareninova', 'Liana Asatryan', 'Gabriele Siegert']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Epigenetic control of phospholipase A2 receptor expression in mammary cancer cells.', 'Secreted phospholipases A₂are differentially expressed and epigenetically silenced in human breast cancer cells.', 'Differential expression of secretory phospholipases A2 in normal and malignant prostate cell lines: regulation by cytokines, cell signaling pathways, and epigenetic mechanisms.', 'Current insights into functions of phospholipase A2 receptor in normal and cancer cells: More questions than answers.', 'Epigenetic drift, epigenetic clocks and cancer risk.', 'Expression of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 (cPLA2)-Arachidonic Acid (AA)-Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) Pathway Factors in Lung Cancer Patients and Its Implication in Lung Cancer Early Detection and Prognosis.', 'Overexpression of the phospholipase A2 group V gene in glioma tumors is associated with poor patient prognosis.', 'Secreted Phospholipases A2 in Hereditary Angioedema With C1-Inhibitor Deficiency.', 'Plasma phospholipase A2 activity may serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker for the diagnosis of breast cancer.', 'Group V Secreted Phospholipase A2 Induces the Release of Proangiogenic and Antiangiogenic Factors by Human Neutrophils.']"""

Androgens act via the androgen receptor (AR/Ar), which is involved in various cell biological processes such as sex differentiation. To study the functional mechanisms of androgen action, cell culture systems and AR-transfected cell lines are needed. Transfection of AR into cell lines and subsequent gene expression analysis after androgen treatment is well established to investigate the molecular biology of target cells. However, it remains unclear how the transfection with AR itself can modulate the gene expression even without androgen stimulation. Therefore, we transfected Ar-deficient rat Sertoli cells 93RS2 by electroporation using a full length human AR.  Results:   Transfection success was confirmed by Western Blotting, immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. AR transfection-related gene expression alterations were detected with microarray-based genome-wide expression profiling of transfected and non-transfected 93RS2 cells without androgen stimulation. Microarray analysis revealed 672 differentially regulated genes with 200 up- and 472 down-regulated genes. These genes could be assigned to four major biological categories (development, hormone response, immune response and metabolism). Microarray results were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis for 22 candidate genes.  Conclusion:   We conclude from our data, that the transfection of Ar-deficient Sertoli cells with AR has a measurable effect on gene expression even without androgen stimulation and cause Sertoli cell damage. Studies using AR-transfected cells, subsequently stimulated, should consider alterations in AR-dependent gene expression as off-target effects of the AR transfection itself.""","""['D Fietz', 'M Markmann', 'D Lang', 'L Konrad', 'J Geyer', 'S Kliesch', 'T Chakraborty', 'H Hossain', 'M Bergmann']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Mol Biol""","""['Transcriptional regulation of androgen receptor gene expression in Sertoli cells and other cell types.', ""Transcriptional regulation of the androgen signaling pathway by the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1."", 'Two androgen response elements in the androgen receptor coding region are required for cell-specific up-regulation of receptor messenger RNA.', 'Molecular regulation of androgen action in prostate cancer.', 'Nongenomic actions of androgen in Sertoli cells.', 'Importance of the Androgen Receptor Signaling in Gene Transactivation and Transrepression for Pubertal Maturation of the Testis.', 'Myofibroblast androgen receptor expression determines cell survival in co-cultures of myofibroblasts and prostate cancer cells in vitro.']"""

The AUA argues that the rates of 'insignificant' prostate cancer (PC) in men under 55 are so high that the potential harms of PSA-testing in this population (over diagnosis and overtreatment) outweigh the benefits (early detection and treatment). Our study aims to identify and compare the rates of insignificant and high-risk PC in men diagnosed with PC ≤55 years and >55 years in two centres in Sydney, Australia.  Methods:   Men with an abnormal screening PSA or DRE and diagnosed with PC by prostate biopsy were included in this study. A consecutive series of men were accrued from two major urology centres between the years 2006 and 2014. The analysis was divided into two parts, the first compared PC biopsy characteristics between men aged ≤55 years and those >55 years. The second analysis compared the prostatectomy pathological characteristics between the two groups. Differences were analysed by Chi squared and significance set at p < 0.05.  Results:   A total of 598 prostate biopsies and 723 prostatectomy matched subjects were included. On prostate biopsies, 14.0 % of men ≤55 years and 11.9 % of men >55 years had insignificant PC (X(2) = 0.32, df = 1, p = 0.57), whilst 24.7 % of men ≤55 years and 25.1 % of men >55 years had high-risk PC (X(2) = 0.007, df = 1, p = 0.93). On prostatectomy specimens, 9.1 % of men ≤55 years and 6.5 % of men >55 years had insignificant PC (X(2) = 1.25, df = 1, p = 0.26), whilst 20.0 % of men ≤55 years and 24.0 % of men >55 years had high-risk PC (X(2) = 0.83, df = 1, p = 0.36).  Conclusion:   We found no significant difference in the rates of insignificant and high-risk PC between men ≤55 years and >55 years, in either the prostate biopsies or prostatectomy specimens.

Clinical covariates do not account for all outcomes. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are prognostic in the primary and metastatic settings of breast, prostate and colorectal cancer (CRC), and evolving evidence supports their role in CRLMs. Our objective was to determine whether CTCs in peripheral (PV) and hepatic venous (HV) compartments are associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) post-CRLM resection.  Methods:   CTCs were measured by CellSearch assay from intraoperative HV and PV samples from 63 patients who underwent CRLM resection from June 2007 to August 2012 at a single center. DFS and OS were primary endpoints.  Results:   HV CTCs > 3 were associated with shorter DFS and OS, but not PV CTCs, although no significant difference was found between CTC measurements in the two compartments. By univariate analysis, CRC stage and site, CRLM recurrence, and hepatic capsule invasion were also associated with OS, but only HV CTCs and CRC site were significant by multivariate Cox. Only HV CTCs were associated with DFS by multivariate analysis. Cases with elevated HV CTCs had hepatic vein invasion and lymph node metastases, and were younger with larger tumors.  Conclusions:   Elevated HV CTCs are prognostic for DFS and OS following CRLM resection. Clinicopathologic features associated with HV CTCs are identifiable preoperatively and should be considered in CRLM surgical decision making. We found no evidence that PV CTCs are prognostic in this setting.""","""['Ashton A Connor', 'Kate McNamara', 'Eisar Al-Sukhni', 'Jacob Diskin', 'David Chan', 'Colleen Ash', 'Lori E Lowes', 'Alison L Allan', 'George Zogopoulos', 'Carol-Anne Moulton', 'Steven Gallinger']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['ASO Author Reflections: Perioperative Genomic Profiles and Prognosis of Peripheral and Perihepatic Circulating Tumor DNA in Patients with Colorectal Liver Metastases.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells in Patients Undergoing Resection of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases.

Methods:   We reviewed the clinical data of 706 patients with BPH. Two PSA-related parameters, namely PSA mass (total circulating PSA protein) and PSA mass ratio (total circulation PSA protein per prostate volume), were calculated for all the patients and the association of BMI with PSA, PSA mass, and PSA mass ratio was assessed.  Results:   A higher BMI was significantly associated with a greater plasma volume and prostate volume (P<0.05). Linear regression analysis revealed a greater adjusted R2 of BMI versus plasma volume than of BMI PSA (0.569 vs 0.027). PSA was positively associated with the prostate volume and negatively with BMI and plasma volume (P<0.05). PSA mass was positively associated with prostate volume (P<0.05) but was not associated with BMI or plasma volume (P>0.05).

The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is a 'novel' mediator of estrogen signaling which has been recently recognized in some human reproductive tissues, but its expression in the prostate gland is still unknown. Here, we investigated GPER in benign (from 5 patients) and neoplastic prostatic tissues (from 50 patients) by immunohistochemical analysis and Western blotting. Normal areas of benign prostates revealed a strong GPER immunoreactivity in the basal epithelial cells while luminal epithelial cells were unreactive and stromal cells were weakly immunostained. GPER was also immunolocalized in adenocarcinoma samples but the immunoreactivity of tumoral areas decreased from Gleason pattern 2 to Gleason pattern 4. Furthermore, a strong GPER immunostaining was also revealed in cells of pre-neoplastic lesions (high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia). Western blot analysis of benign and tumor protein extracts showed the presence of a ~42 kDa band, consistent with the GPER molecular weight. An increase in both pAkt and p cAMP-response-binding protein (pCREB) levels was also observed in poorly differentiated PCa samples. Finally, this work identified GPER in the epithelial basal cells of benign human prostate, with a different localization with respect to the classical estrogen receptors. Furthermore, the expression of GPER in prostatic adenocarcinoma cells was also observed but with a modulation of the immunoreactivity according to tumor cell arrangements.""","""['V Rago', 'F Romeo', 'F Giordano', 'A Ferraro', 'A Carpino']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Andrology""","""['G Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor Mediates Cell Proliferation through the cAMP/PKA/CREB Pathway in Murine Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells.', 'Differential expression of the estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) in human prostate tissue, premalignant changes, and in primary, metastatic, and recurrent prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Estrogen signaling through the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor regulates granulocyte activation in fish.', 'Expression and Role of the G Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPR30/GPER) in the Development and Immune Response in Female Reproductive Cancers.', 'The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor as a modulator of neoplastic transformation.', 'Estrogen and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor accelerate the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia by inducing prostatic fibrosis.', 'Assessment of G Protein-Coupled Oestrogen Receptor Expression in Normal and Neoplastic Human Tissues Using a Novel Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody.', 'Distribution and Effects of Estrogen Receptors in Prostate Cancer: Associated Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Binding of Androgen- and Estrogen-Like Flavonoids to Their Cognate (Non)Nuclear Receptors: A Comparison by Computational Prediction.', 'FSH-R Human Early Male Genital Tract, Testicular Tumors and Sperm: Its Involvement in Testicular Disorders.']"""

Treatment options for castration-resistant PCa include the potent second-generation anti-androgen enzalutamide or CYP17A1 inhibitor abiraterone. Recent clinical observations point to the development of resistance to these therapies which may be mediated by constitutively active alternative splice variants of the androgen receptor (AR).  Methods:   Sensitivity of LNCaP cells overexpressing Lin28 (LN-Lin28) to enzalutamide, abiraterone, or bicalutamide was compared to that of control LN-neo cells using cell growth assays, proliferation assays using MTT, anchorage-dependent clonogenic ability assays and soft agar assays. Ability of LN-Lin28 cells to maintain AR activation after treatment with enzalutamide, abiraterone, or bicalutamide was tested using immunofluorescence, Western blotting, ChIP assays, and qRT-PCR. Importance of Lin28 in enzalutamide resistance was assessed by the downregulation of Lin28 expression in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells chronically treated with enzalutamide. Requirement for sustained AR signaling in LN-Lin28 cells was examined by the downregulation of either full length AR or AR-V7 using siRNA.  Results:   We show that Lin28 promotes the development of resistance to currently used targeted therapeutics by enhancing the expression of AR splice variants such as AR-V7. PCa cells overexpressing Lin28 exhibit resistance to treatment with enzalutamide, abiraterone, or bicalutamide. Downregulation of Lin28 resensitizes enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells to enzalutamide treatment. We also show that the upregulation of splicing factors such as hnRNPA1 by Lin28 may mediate the enhanced generation of AR splice variants in Lin28-expressing cells.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that Lin28 plays a key role in the acquisition of resistance to AR-targeted therapies by PCa cells and establish the importance of Lin28 in PCa progression.""","""['Ramakumar Tummala', 'Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Wei Lou', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Niclosamide enhances abiraterone treatment via inhibition of androgen receptor variants in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Expression of AR-V7 in Circulating Tumour Cells Does Not Preclude Response to Next Generation Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients with Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?', 'Lin28 Regulates Cancer Cell Stemness for Tumour Progression.', 'LIN28B promotes the development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor variant-driven prostate cancer II: advances in laboratory investigations.', 'Splicing Factors Have an Essential Role in Prostate Cancer Progression and Androgen Receptor Signaling.']"""

In this study, we examine the ability of the compound to specifically target cancer cells harboring mutant KRAS with minimal activity against wild-type (WT) RAS-expressing cells.  Results:   HCT116 cells expressing mutated KRAS are susceptible, while the WT-expressing HT29 cells are resistant. Interestingly, C1 triggers activation of mutant RAS, which results in the downstream phosphorylation and activation of AKT/PKB. Gene knockdown of KRAS or AKT or their pharmacological inhibition resulted in the abrogation of C1-induced ROS production and rescued tumor colony-forming ability. We also made use of HCT116 mutant KRAS knockout (KO) cells, which express only a single WT KRAS allele. Exposure of KO cells to C1 failed to increase mitochondrial ROS and cell death, unlike the parental cells harboring mutant KRAS. Similarly, mutant KRAS-transformed prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1-RAS) were more sensitive to the ROS-producing and death-inducing effects of C1 than the vector only expressing RWPE-1 cells. An in vivo model of xenograft tumors generated with HCT116 KRAS(WT/MUT) or KRAS(WT/-) cells showed the efficacy of C1 treatment and its ability to affect the relative mitotic index in tumors harboring KRAS mutant.  Innovation and conclusion:   These data indicate a synthetic lethal effect against cells carrying mutant KRAS, which could have therapeutic implications given the paucity of KRAS-specific chemotherapeutic strategies.

We applied a grouping algorithm designed for large-scale data sets and multiple prognostic factors to investigate whether it improves cost prediction among older Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We analysed the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, which included data from 2000 through 2009 for men diagnosed with incident prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007. We split the survival data into two data sets (D0 and D1) of equal size. We trained the classifier of the Grouping Algorithm for Cancer Data (GACD) on D0 and tested it on D1. The prognostic factors included cancer stage, age, race and performance status proxies. We calculated the average difference between observed D1 costs and predicted D1 costs at 5 years post-diagnosis with and without the GACD.  Results:   The sample included 110,843 men with prostate cancer. The median age of the sample was 74 years, and 10% were African American. The average difference (mean absolute error [MAE]) per person between the real and predicted total 5-year cost was US$41,525 (MAE US$41,790; 95% confidence interval [CI] US$41,421-42,158) with the GACD and US$43,113 (MAE US$43,639; 95% CI US$43,062-44,217) without the GACD. The 5-year cost prediction without grouping resulted in a sample overestimate of US$79,544,508.

Results:   17G1 cross-reactivity with canine PSMA (and J591) was confirmed by protein analyses on DPC-1, LNCaP, and PC-3 cell lines and IHC of dog vs. human prostate tissue sections. 17G1 stained luminal cells and DPC-1 cancer cells in dog prostates similarly to human luminal and cancer cells of patients and LNCaP xenografts. SPECT/CT imaging revealed low uptake (≤2.1) of both (111)In-17G1 in normal dog prostates and (111)In-IgGs in growing DPC-1 prostate tumors comparatively to (111)In-17G1 uptake of 3.6 increasing up to 6.5 values in prostate with DPC-1 lesions. Images showed a diffused pattern and, occasionally, a peripheral doughnut-shape-like pattern. Numerous sacro-iliac lymph nodes and lung lesions were detected with contrast ratios of 5.2 and 3.0, respectively. The highest values were observed in pelvic bones (11 and 19) of two dogs, next confirmed as PSMA-positive metastases.

Regarding this, we carefully reinvestigated this problem on human prostatic cell lines.  Material and methods:   Expression of preproorexin (ppOX) (6 primer pairs), and orexin receptors 1 and 2 (OXR1, OXR2) (4 and 2 primer pairs, respectively) was assessed by conventional PCR and QPCR in human normal (PrEC, PrSc, PrSmC) and prostate carcinoma (Du145, LNCaP, and PC3) cell lines. We designed intron spanning primers and also we applied primers from earlier publications and commercially available ones.  Results:   With the designed primer pairs, in all studied cell lines we failed to demonstrate expression of ppOX, OXR1 and OXR2 genes at the mRNA level, while reaction products were observed in control tissues (human placenta and adrenals). Primers applied in earlier studies did not form amplification products specific for preproorexin or orexin 1 receptor. Some commercially available primers for orexin receptor 1 produced false positive results.  Conclusions:   We found no evidence for the presence of preproorexin-orexin receptors system genes' mRNAs in human prostate cell lines. The reported premises for these genes’ expression in prostate and prostatic cell lines may have arisen either from the presence of non-prostate cells included in the samples or from faulty PCR settings.""","""['Marta Szyszka', 'Lukasz Paschke', 'Marianna Tyczewska', 'Marcin Rucinski', 'Paulina Grabowska', 'Ludwik K Malendowicz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Folia Histochem Cytobiol""","""[""A review of orexin's unprecedented potential as a novel, highly-specific treatment for various localized and metastatic cancers."", 'Effects of leptin on leptin receptor isoform expression and proliferative activity in human normal prostate and prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Elevated expression of orexin receptor 2 (HCRTR2) in benign prostatic hyperplasia is accompanied by lowered serum orexin A concentrations.', 'Preproorexin and orexin receptors are expressed in cortisol-secreting adrenocortical adenomas, and orexins stimulate in vitro cortisol secretion and growth of tumor cells.', 'The physiological role of orexins.', 'Focus on the Complex Interconnection between Cancer, Narcolepsy and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Possible Case of Orexin-Dependent Inverse Comorbidity.', 'Analysis of Transcriptome, Selected Intracellular Signaling Pathways, Proliferation and Apoptosis of LNCaP Cells Exposed to High Leptin Concentrations.', 'ZFP91 zinc finger protein expression pattern in normal tissues and cancers.', 'The Orexin-A-Regulated Akt/mTOR Pathway Promotes Cell Proliferation Through Inhibiting Apoptosis in Pancreatic Cancer Cells.', ""A review of orexin's unprecedented potential as a novel, highly-specific treatment for various localized and metastatic cancers.""]"""

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common side-effect. Our aim was to evaluate penile erectile function (EF) before and after BT, EBRT, or RP using a validated self-administered quality-of-life survey from a prospective registry.  Material and methods:   Analysis included 478 patients undergoing RP (n = 252), EBRT (n = 91), and BT (n = 135) with at least 1 year of follow-up and EF documented using IIEF-5 scores at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter.  Results:   Differences among treatments were most pronounced among patients with no or mild initial ED (IIEF-5 ≥ 17). Overall, corrected for baseline EF and age, BT was associated with higher IIEF-5 scores than RP (+ 7.8 IIEF-5 score) or EBRT (+ 3.1 IIEF-5 score). EBRT was associated with better IIEF-5 scores than RP (+ 4.7 IIEF-5 score). In patients undergoing EBRT or RP with bilateral nerve sparing (NS), recovery of EF was observed and during follow-up, the differences to BT were not statistically significant. Overall age had a negative impact on EF preservation (corrected for baseline IIEF).  Conclusion:   In our series, EF was adversely affected by each treatment modality.

The standard procedure for evaluating Gleason scores, namely biopsy, is to remove prostate tissue for observation under microscope. Currently, biopsies are guided by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). Due to the low sensitivity of TRUS to prostate cancer (PCa), non-guided and saturated biopsies are frequently employed, unavoidably causing pain, damage to the normal prostate tissues and other complications. More importantly, due to the limited number of biopsy cores, current procedure could either miss early stage small tumors or undersample aggressive cancers. Photoacoustic (PA) measurement has the unique capability of evaluating tissue microscopic architecture information at ultrasonic resolution. By frequency domain analysis of the broadband PA signal, namely PA spectral analysis (PASA), the microscopic architecture within the assessed tissue can be quantified. This study investigates the feasibility of evaluating Gleason scores by PASA. Simulations with the classic Gleason patterns and experiment measurements from human PCa tissues have demonstrated strong correlation between the PASA parameters and the Gleason scores.""","""['Guan Xu', 'Mandy C Davis', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Scott A Tomlins', 'Shengsong Huang', 'Lakshmi P Kunju', 'John T Wei', 'Xueding Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biomed Opt Express""","""['Cribriform morphology predicts upstaging after radical prostatectomy in patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer at transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided needle biopsy.', 'Interstitial assessment of aggressive prostate cancer by physio-chemical photoacoustics: An ex vivo study with intact human prostates.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Interstitial photoacoustic spectral analysis: instrumentation and validation.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Here, we validated this observation and explored the therapeutic potential of targeting CD24 in TP53 mutant prostate cancer cells.  Experimental design:   Overall, 553 prostate cancers (522 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded and 31 frozen tissues) were assessed for protein or mRNA expression of CD24 and TP53 The effects of CD24 on p53-dependent transcriptional regulation, cancer cell growth, the cell cycle, apoptosis, and mutant p53 restoration were also determined.  Results:   As determined with three sample cohorts, CD24 and p53 were not expressed in prostate epithelial cells but in prostate cancer cells in 48% of cases for CD24 and 16% of cases for p53 (mutant form). Expressions of CD24 and mutant p53 were more frequently observed in late-stage and metastatic prostate tumors. Mutant p53 accompanied with CD24 was expressed in most cases (91.6%, 76/83). Silencing of CD24 increased the transcriptional activity of p53 target genes, such as CDKNA1, VDR, and TP53INP1, leading to suppression of p53-dependent cell growth, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis in most TP53-mutant prostate cancer cells. Silencing of CD24 enhanced restoration of PRIMA-1-induced mutant p53 in endogenous TP53(P223L/V274F) DU145 cells and in PC3 cells transfected with TP53(R273H) CONCLUSIONS: In human prostate cancers, there is CD24-dependent inactivation of mutant p53. The coexpression of CD24 and p53 may help identify aggressive cancers. Targeting CD24 provides a strategy to enhance mutant p53-restoring therapies, especially in patients with TP53(R273H) prostate cancer.

Transcriptionally active androgen receptor (AR) plays a role in the majority of CRPCs. Therefore, cotargeting full-length (FL) AR and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling has been proposed as a possible, more effective therapeutic approach for CRPC. However, truncated AR-splice variants (AR-V) that are constitutively active and dominant over FL-AR are associated with tumor progression and resistance mechanisms in CRPC. It is currently unknown how blocking the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway impacts prostate cancer driven by AR-Vs. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and mechanism of combination therapy to block mTOR activity together with EPI-002, an AR N-terminal domain (NTD) antagonist that blocks the transcriptional activities of FL-AR and AR-Vs in models of CRPC.  Experimental design:   To determine the functional roles of FL-AR, AR-Vs, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, we employed EPI-002 or enzalutamide and BEZ235 (low dose) or everolimus in human prostate cancer cells that express FL-AR or FL-AR and AR-Vs (LNCaP95). Gene expression and efficacy were examined in vitro and in vivo  Results:   EPI-002 had antitumor activity in enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP95 cells that was associated with decreased expression of AR-V target genes (e.g., UBE2C). Inhibition of mTOR provided additional blockade of UBE2C expression. A combination of EPI-002 and BEZ235 decreased the growth of LNCaP95 cells in vitro and in vivo  Conclusions:   Cotargeting mTOR and AR-NTD to block transcriptional activities of FL-AR and AR-Vs provided maximum antitumor efficacy in PTEN-null, enzalutamide-resistant CRPC.

Three different questionnaires were used to measure osteoporosis knowledge, health beliefs, and self-efficacy in a group of men with prostate cancer and survivors. Bone health was assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and calcium intake using a diet history. The prevalence of osteoporosis and low bone mass was high at over 70%. Participants had inadequate osteoporosis knowledge with a mean score of 43.3% ( SD = 18%) on the Facts on Osteoporosis Quiz. Participants scored low on the subscale measuring barriers to exercise (median = 11; interquartile range [IQR] = 6.5), indicating minimal barriers to exercise participation, and the subscale measuring the benefits of exercise scored the highest (median = 24; IQR = 3.5) compared with the other subscales. Men with prostate cancer and survivors were highly confident in their exercise and calcium self-efficacy (83.0%, IQR = 24.0% and 85.7%, IQR = 27.0%, respectively). Participants did not meet their calcium requirements or consume enough dairy products for optimum bone health. Men with prostate cancer and survivors have poor osteoporosis knowledge, but are confident in their self-efficacy of undertaking bone healthy behaviors. This confidence did not translate to specific dietary behaviors as they did not meet their calcium or dairy intake requirements.

Although shorter wait times are believed intuitively to lead to higher satisfaction, studies have demonstrated the importance of many other factors which contribute to patients' satisfaction with their wait time experiences. The current study explores the factors that shape patients' satisfaction with their overall wait times (i.e. from symptom to treatment).  Methods:   We conducted qualitative interviews with 60 breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer patients to examine the reasons behind patients' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their wait time experiences. We purposefully recruited satisfied and unsatisfied participants from our larger survey sample. Using a semi-structured interview guide, patients were asked about their wait time experiences and the reasons behind their (dis)satisfaction. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded using a thematic approach.  Results:   Patients' perceptions of satisfaction with wait times were influenced by three interrelated dimensions: the interpersonal skills of treating physicians (which included expressions/demonstrations of empathy and concern, quality of information exchange, accountability for errors), coordination (which included assistance navigating the health system, scheduling of appointments, sharing information between providers, coordination in scheduling appointments, and sharing of information ), and timeliness of care (which referred to providers' responsiveness to patients' symptoms, coverage during provider absences, and shared sense of urgency between patient and providers). Providers' willingness to ""trouble shoot"" and acknowledge errors/delays were particularly influential in patients' overall perception of their wait times.  Conclusions:   We described three dimensions of wait-related satisfaction: physicians' interpersonal skills, coordination of care, and timeliness of care, which are often interrelated and overlapping. Furthermore, while patients wait-related satisfaction was typically based on multiple interactions with different providers, positive or negative experiences with a single provider, often (but not always) the family physician, had a substantial impact on the overall satisfaction or dissatisfaction with wait time experiences.

Methods:   Differences in 10 serum cytokine levels, IL1β, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IFNγ, and TNFα, between 170 African-American and 296 European-American controls from the National Cancer Institute-Maryland (NCI-MD) case-control study were assessed. Associations of the serum cytokine levels with lung cancer were analyzed. Statistically significant results were replicated in the prospective Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial and the Wayne State University Karmanos Cancer Institute case-control study.  Results:   Six cytokines, IL4, IL5, IL8, IL10, IFNγ, and TNFα, were significantly higher among European-American as compared with African-American controls. Elevated IL6 and IL8 levels were associated with lung cancer among both races in all three studies. Elevated IL1β, IL10, and TNFα levels were associated with lung cancer only among African Americans.

The short- and intermediate-term oncologic and functional outcomes were encouraging and comparable to those with retropubic radical prostatectomy. However, the long-term oncologic safety for LRP has yet to be fully elucidated. We evaluated the long-term oncologic outcomes of an initial series of patients who had undergone LRP.  Patients and methods:   An initial unselected and consecutive series of 100 patients who had undergone LRP for clinically localized prostate cancer from 1999 to 2001 was identified. The pre-, intra-, and postoperative data were collected. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value of ≥ 0.2 ng/mL. The outcome measures were cancer control (CC), BCR-free survival (BCRFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS).  Results:   The mean patient age was 64 ± 7 years, and the mean preoperative PSA level was 9.6 ± 8.3 ng/mL. Of the 100 patients, 79 (79%) had stage pT2 and 15 (15%) had stage pT3 disease. Positive surgical margins were found in 25 patients (25%; 16.4% for pT2 and 40% for pT3). The median follow-up time was 126 months (range, 60-176 months). The 5-year CC rate was 82%. The estimated 10-year BCRFS was 83% and 80% for patients with stage pT2 and pT3 tumors, respectively. The median time to BCR was 52 months (range, 6-144 months). The estimated 10-year CSS and OS was 98% and 93%, respectively.

In the present study, we evaluated the anticancer and chemosensitization effects of calcitriol at clinically relevant concentrations and aPPD, either alone or in combination, in two well-characterized human PCa cell lines: androgen-sensitive non-metastatic LNCaP cells and androgen-independent metastatic C4-2 cells. The effects of the treatments on PCa cell viability and proliferation rates were evaluated by MTS and Brdu assays, respectively. Combination Indices (CI) and Dose Reduction Indices (DRI) were estimated to assess synergistic anticancer activity using Calcusyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Then, we determined the potential Pharmacodynamic interaction mechanisms as follows: The protein expression levels of the genes those are known to control cell cycle (cyclin D1 and cdk2); apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bax, and Capspases 3), androgen receptor and Vitamin D receptors were examined upon combinational treatment. The cell viability assay data show that addition of 10nM calcitriol to aPPD significantly lowered its IC50 values from the range of 41-53μM to 13-23μM, in LNCaP and C4-2 prostate cancer cells. The cell proliferation rate was significantly lower for combination treatments compared to the cells treated with aPPD alone. Similarly, Western blot results indicate that aPPD significantly upregulated Vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression, while calcitriol further enhanced the ability of aPPD to induce pro-apoptotic BAX, increased cleaved caspase-3 and downregulate cdk2 protein levels. Thus, the pharmacodynamic interaction between aPPD and calcitriol in impacting growth inhibition and apoptosis appears to be synergistic in nature. In conclusion, calcitriol sensitizes PCa cells to aPPD-mediated anticancer effects by enhancing its ability to induce apoptosis and reduce cell proliferation, and this synergism may limit calcitriol toxicity by facilitating the use of lower calcitriol doses. The associated increase in VDR expression and calcitriol half-life may be mechanistically associated with this sensitization effect.""","""['Mohamed Ben-Eltriki', 'Subrata Deb', 'Hans Adomat', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Anti-Tumor Effects of Ginsenoside 20(S)-Protopanaxadiol and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Combination in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', '1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 synergistically enhances anticancer effects of ginsenoside Rh2 in human prostate cancer cells.', 'A novel oral dosage formulation of the ginsenoside aglycone protopanaxadiol exhibits therapeutic activity against a hormone-insensitive model of prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin D in Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular pathways mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of calcitriol: implications for prostate cancer chemoprevention and treatment.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Anti-Tumor Effects of Ginsenoside 20(S)-Protopanaxadiol and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Combination in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Platelet Protease Activated Receptor 1 Is Involved in the Hemostatic Effect of 20(S)-Protopanaxadiol by Regulating Calcium Signaling.', 'Simulation of Physicochemical and Pharmacokinetic Properties of Vitamin D3 and Its Natural Derivatives.', 'NNK-mediated upregulation of DEPDC1 stimulates the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma by inhibiting CYP27B1 expression.']"""

Inflammation is associated with prostatic enlargement and resistance to 5α-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) therapy. Activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway is linked to both inflammation and ligand-independent prostate cancer progression.  Methods:   NF-κB activation and androgen receptor variant (AR-V) expression were quantified in transition zone tissue samples from patients with a wide range of AUASS from incidental BPH in patients treated for low grade, localized peripheral zone prostate cancer to advanced disease requiring surgical intervention. To further investigate these pathways, human prostatic stromal and epithelial cell lines were transduced with constitutively active or kinase dead forms of IKK2 to regulate canonical NF-κB activity. The effects on AR full length (AR-FL) and androgen-independent AR-V expression as well as cellular growth and differentiation were assessed.  Results:   Canonical NF-κB signaling was found to be upregulated in late versus early stage BPH, and to be strongly associated with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Elevated expression of AR-variant 7 (AR-V7), but not other AR variants, was found in advanced BPH samples. Expression of AR-V7 significantly correlated with the patient AUASS and TRUS volume. Forced activation of canonical NF-κB in human prostatic epithelial and stromal cells resulted in elevated expression of both AR-FL and AR-V7, with concomitant ligand-independent activation of AR reporters. Activation of NF-κB and over expression of AR-V7 in human prostatic epithelial cells maintained cell viability in the face of 5ARI treatment.  Conclusion:   Activation of NF-κB and AR-V7 in the prostate is associated with increased disease severity. AR-V7 expression is inducible in human prostate cells by forced activation of NF-κB resulting in resistance to 5ARI treatment, suggesting a potential mechanism by which patients may become resistant to 5ARI therapy.""","""['David C Austin', 'Douglas W Strand', 'Harold L Love', 'Omar E Franco', 'Alex Jang', 'Magdalena M Grabowska', 'Nicole L Miller', 'Omar Hameed', 'Peter E Clark', 'Jay H Fowke', 'Robert J Matusik', 'Ren J Jin', 'Simon W Hayward']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['NF-κB and androgen receptor variant 7 induce expression of SRD5A isoforms and confer 5ARI resistance.', 'Melatonin Inhibits Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 (AR-V7)-Induced Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Activation and NF-κB Activator-Induced AR-V7 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells: Potential Implications for the Use of Melatonin in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Therapy.', 'CX4945 suppresses the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by reducing AR-V7 expression.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Upregulates Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue 1 to Induce NF-κB Activity via Androgen-Dependent and -Independent Pathways in Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'LOX-1 Activation by oxLDL Induces AR and AR-V7 Expression via NF-κB and STAT3 Signaling Pathways Reducing Enzalutamide Cytotoxic Effects.', 'Kolaviron modulates angiogenesis, apoptosis and inflammatory signaling in rat model of testosterone propionate-induced benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Antagonistic Functions of Androgen Receptor and NF-κB in Prostate Cancer-Experimental and Computational Analyses.', 'Individual and Combined Effect of Bisphenol A and Bisphenol AF on Prostate Cell Proliferation through NF-κB Signaling Pathway.']"""

Since cell cycle checkpoint dysregulation is crucial for the development and progression of cancer, we tested the hypothesis that common germ-line variants within cell cycle genes were associated with aggressive PCa.  Methods:   Via a two-stage design, 364 common sequence variants in 88 genes were tested. The initial stage consisted of 258 aggressive PCa patients and 442 controls, and the second stage added 384 aggressive PCa Patients and 463 controls. European-American and African-American samples were analyzed separately. In the first stage, SNPs were typed by Illumina Goldengate assay while in the second stage SNPs were typed by Pyrosequencing assays. Genotype frequencies between cases and controls were compared using logistical regression analysis with additive, dominant and recessive models.  Results:   Eleven variants within 10 genes (CCNC, CCND3, CCNG1, CCNT2, CDK6, MDM2, SKP2, WEE1, YWHAB, YWHAH) in the European-American population and nine variants in 7 genes (CCNG1, CDK2, CDK5, MDM2, RB1, SMAD3, TERF2) in the African-American population were found to be associated with aggressive PCa using at least one model. Of particular interest, CCNC (rs3380812) was associated with risk in European-American cohorts from both institutions. CDK2 (rs1045435) and CDK5 (rs2069459) were associated with risk in the African-American cohorts from both institutions. Lastly, variants within MDM2 and CCNG1 were protective for aggressive PCa in both ethnic groups.  Conclusions:   This study confirms that polymorphisms within cell cycle genes are associated with clinically aggressive PCa.

Methods:   A total of 77 (39 recurrent, 38 non-recurrent) radical prostatectomy and 20 normal prostate samples, obtained from Baylor College of Medicine Prostate Cancer program, were included into the study and divided into two independent groups as test and validation sample sets. Differential expression of selected ABC transporters was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Pearson's correlation test, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and Kaplan-Meier test were used for statistical analysis.  Results:   QRT-PCR results demonstrated the elevated expression of ABCA5, ABCB1, ABCB6, ABCC1, and ABCC2 as well as reduced expression of ABCC3 in PCa samples compared to normal prostate tissues.

Materials and methods:   66 male patients (age 65.4±10.8y) with suspected prostate cancer underwent multiparametric MRI of the prostate including T2-w, DWI-w and DCE-MRI sequences at a 3T MRI scanner. All detected lesions were categorized based on ACR PI-RADS version 2 and divided into 2 groups (A: PI-RADS ≤3, n=32; B: PI-RADS >3, n=34). In each DCE-MRI dataset, pharmacokinetic parameters (Ktrans, Kep and ve) and goodness of fit (chi(2)) were generated using the Tofts model with 3 different pAIFs (fast, intermediate, slow) as provided by a commercially available postprocessing software. Pharmacokinetic parameters, their diagnostic accuracies and model fits were compared for the 3 pAIFs.  Results:   Ktrans, Kep and ve differed significantly among the 3 pAIFs (all p<.001). Ktrans and Kep were significantly higher in group B compared to group A (all p<.001). For chi(2), lowest results (representing highest goodness of fit) were found for intermediate pAIF (chi(2) 0.073). ROC analyses revealed comparable diagnostic accuracies for the different pAIFs, which were high for Ktrans and Kep and low for ve.

Objective:   To examine the performance of the new GGGs in men with prostate cancer from a nationwide population-based cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   From the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden, we identified 5880 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2005 to 2007, including 4325 who had radical prostatectomy and 1555 treated with radiation therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazards models, and concordance indices were used to examine the relationship between the GGGs and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy.  Results and limitations:   Among men treated with surgery, the 4-yr biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 89%, 82%, 74%, 77%, and 49% for GGG 1-5 on biopsy, and 92%, 85%, 73%, 63%, and 51% based on prostatectomy GGG, respectively. For men treated by radiation therapy, men with biopsy GGG of 1-5 had 4-yr biochemical recurrence-free survival rates of 95%, 91%, 85%, 78%, and 70%. Adjusting for preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen and clinical stage, biopsy GGGs were significant independent predictors of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy.

Transdermal oestradiol is a potential alternative to LHRHa.  Objective:   To compare BMD change in men receiving either LHRHa or oestradiol patches (OP).  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with locally advanced or metastatic PCa participating in the randomised UK Prostate Adenocarcinoma TransCutaneous Hormones (PATCH) trial (allocation ratio of 1:2 for LHRHa:OP, 2006-2011; 1:1, thereafter) were recruited into a BMD study (2006-2012). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans were performed at baseline, 1 yr, and 2 yr.  Interventions:   LHRHa as per local practice, OP (FemSeven 100μg/24h patches).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was 1-yr change in lumbar spine (LS) BMD from baseline compared between randomised arms using analysis of covariance.  Results and limitations:   A total of 74 eligible men (LHRHa 28, OP 46) participated from seven centres. Baseline clinical characteristics and 3-mo castration rates (testosterone ≤1.7 nmol/l, LHRHa 96% [26 of 27], OP 96% [43 of 45]) were similar between arms. Mean 1-yr change in LS BMD was -0.021g/cm(3) for patients randomised to the LHRHa arm (mean percentage change -1.4%) and +0.069g/cm(3) for the OP arm (+6.0%; p<0.001). Similar patterns were seen in hip and total body measurements. The largest difference between arms was at 2 yr for those remaining on allocated treatment only: LS BMD mean percentage change LHRHa -3.0% and OP +7.9% (p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Transdermal oestradiol as a single agent produces castration levels of testosterone while mitigating BMD loss. These early data provide further supporting evidence for the ongoing phase 3 trial.

Materials & methods:   The development cohort included 689 consecutive PCa patients treated with RP between 1987 and 2011 with subsequent BCR, defined as two subsequent prostate-specific antigen values >0.2 ng/ml. Multivariable competing-risks regression analyses tested the predictors of CSM after BCR for the purpose of 5-year CSM nomogram development. Validation (2000 bootstrap resamples) was internally tested. External validation was performed into a population of 6734 PCa patients with BCR after treatment with RP at the Mayo Clinic from 1987 to 2011. The predictive accuracy (PA) was quantified using the receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve and the calibration plot method.  Results:   The 5-year CSM-free survival rate was 83.6% (confidence interval [CI]: 79.6-87.2). In multivariable analyses, pathologic stage T3b or more (hazard ratio [HR]: 7.42; p = 0.008), pathologic Gleason score 8-10 (HR: 2.19; p = 0.003), lymph node invasion (HR: 3.57; p = 0.001), time to BCR (HR: 0.99; p = 0.03) and age at BCR (HR: 1.04; p = 0.04), were each significantly associated with the risk of CSM after BCR. The bootstrap-corrected PA was 87.4% (bootstrap 95% CI: 82.0-91.7%). External validation of our nomogram showed a good PA at 83.2%.

Despite close monitoring a small subset of patients progress to metastatic disease. We analyzed the clinical and pathological correlates of surveillance in patients who eventually experienced metastasis.  Materials and methods:   This was a single center, prospective cohort study. Eligible patients were treated with an expectant approach. The main outcome measure was metastasis-free survival. Predictive factors for metastasis were identified.  Results:   Metastasis developed in 30 of 980 patients, of whom 211 were classified at intermediate risk, including 14 who progressed to metastatic disease. Median followup was 6.3 years, median age was 70 years, median prostate specific antigen was 6.2 ng/ml and median time to metastasis was 8.9 years. Metastases developed in bone in 18 patients (60%) and in lymph nodes in 13 (43%). Prostate specific antigen doubling time less than 3 years (HR 3.7, 95% CI 1.4-9.4, p = 0.0006), Gleason score 7 (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-7.3, p = 0.0018) and a total of 3 or more positive cores (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-6.8, p = 0.0028) were independent predictors of metastasis. Although the intermediate risk group was at higher risk for metastasis, those with Gleason score 6 and prostate specific antigen greater than 10 ng/ml were not at increased risk for metastasis. Metastasis developed in only 2 patients with Gleason score 6 and neither had surgical pathology grading.  Conclusion:   Active surveillance appears safe in patients at low risk and in select patients at intermediate risk, particularly those with Gleason score 6 and prostate specific antigen greater than 10 ng/ml. Patients with elements of Gleason pattern 4 on diagnostic biopsy are at increased risk for eventual metastasis when treated with an initial conservative approach.""","""['Toshihiro Yamamoto', 'H Bindu Musunuru', 'Danny Vesprini', 'Liying Zhang', 'Gabriella Ghanem', 'Andrew Loblaw', 'Laurence Klotz']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Limitations in Predicting Organ Confined Prostate Cancer in Patients with Gleason Pattern 4 on Biopsy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'The Long-Term Risks of Metastases in Men on Active Surveillance for Early Stage Prostate Cancer.', 'Active Surveillance for Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer: Survival Outcomes in the Sunnybrook Experience.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Active surveillance: the Canadian experience.', 'Comparison of Outcomes of Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Versus Low-Risk Localised Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Data.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer: Time to Say Goodbye to Protocol-based Biopsies.', 'Metastasis and Mortality in Men With Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance.', 'Long-term and pathological outcomes of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: implications for active surveillance.']"""

Materials and methods:   We derived rates of national monthly diagnosis and conservative management for screen detected, nonpalpable prostate cancer and patient level insurance status from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) database from 2004 to 2011. We derived monthly statistics on national unemployment rates, inflation, median household income and S&P 500® closing values from government sources. Using linear and logistic multivariable regression we measured the correlation of national macroeconomic conditions with prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment patterns. We evaluated patient level predictors of conservative management to determine whether being insured by Medicaid or uninsured increased the use of conservative management.  Results:   Diagnosis rates correlated positively with the S&P 500 monthly close (coefficient 24.90, 95% CI 6.29-43.50, p = 0.009). Conservative management correlated negatively with median household income (coefficient -49.13, 95% CI -69.29--28.98, p <0.001). In a nonMedicare eligible population having Medicaid (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.32-1.73, p <0.001) or no insurance (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.93-2.67, p <0.001) increased the use of conservative management compared to that in men with private insurance. As indicated by a significant interaction term being diagnosed during the Great Recession increased the Medicaid insurance predictive value of conservative management (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.68, p = 0.037).

This study was done to develop a technical approach that facilitates the analysis of the topographical distribution of PCa foci and related pathological findings (i.e., Gleason score and foci dimensions) in prostatectomy specimens.  Material & methods:   The topographical distribution of PCa foci and related pathologic evaluations were documented using the cMDX documentation system. The project was performed in three steps. First, we analyzed the document architecture of cMDX, including textual and graphical information. Second, we developed a data model supporting the topographic analysis of PCa foci and related pathologic parameters. Finally, we retrospectively evaluated the analysis model in 168 consecutive prostatectomy specimens of men diagnosed with PCa who underwent total prostate removal. The distribution of PCa foci were analyzed and visualized in a heat map. The color depth of the heat map was reduced to 6 colors representing the PCa foci frequencies, using an image posterization effect. We randomly defined 9 regions in which the frequency of PCa foci and related pathologic findings were estimated.  Results:   Evaluation of the spatial distribution of tumor foci according to Gleason score was enabled by using a filter function for the score, as defined by the user. PCa foci with Gleason score (Gls) 6 were identified in 67.3% of the patients, of which 55 (48.2%) also had PCa foci with Gls between 7 and 10. Of 1173 PCa foci, 557 had Gls 6, whereas 616 PCa foci had Gls>6. PCa foci with Gls 6 were mostly concentrated in the posterior part of the peripheral zone of the prostate, whereas PCa foci with Gls>6 extended toward the basal and anterior parts of the prostate. The mean size of PCa foci with Gls 6 was significantly lower than that of PCa with Gls>6 (P<0.0001).

Materials and method:   The retrospective analysis was performed using clinical data of 2,462 adult patients (2,003 women and 459 men), hospitalized in the reference endocrine department. Diagnoses of 18 types of benign tumours and 16 types of malignant tumours, together with the most common 25 NCDs and demographic parameters, were all collected from the medical records. The most frequently found 6 types of benign tumours (of thyroid, pituitary, uterus, breast, adrenal and prostate) and 4 types of malignant tumours (of thyroid, breast, prostate and uterus) were taken for further statistical analyses.  Results:   Age predicted the existence of accumulated as well as individual types of benign and malignant tumours, whereas BMI predicted the occurrence of accumulated and some individual types of benign tumours. Accumulated as well as individual types of benign and malignant tumours coexisted more frequently with several NCDs, such as diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, Graves' disease, coronary artery disease, state after cholecystectomy, thus being disorders usually resulting from excessive exposure to harmful environmental factors. The most distinct coexistence was found between breast cancer and metabolic syndrome, between breast cancer and Graves' disease, between cancer of the uterus and type 2 diabetes, between cancer of the uterus and metabolic syndrome, and between cancer of the uterus and dyslipidemia.
