Previous studies have demonstrated that the upregulation of CENPF may be used as a proliferation marker of malignant cell growth in tumors. The overexpression of CENPF has also been reported to be associated with a poor prognosis in human cancers. However, the clinical significance of CENPF in prostate cancer (PCa) has not yet been fully elucidated. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the association of CENPF with tumor progression and prognosis in patients with PCa. The expression of CENPF at the protein level in human PCa and non-cancerous prostate tissues was detected by immunohistochemical analysis, which was further validated using a microarray-based dataset (NCBI GEO accession no: GSE21032) at the mRNA level. Subsequently, the association of CENPF expression with the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients with PCa was statistically analyzed. Immunohistochemistry and dataset analysis revealed that CENPF expression was significantly increased in the PCa tissues compared with the non-cancerous prostate tissues [immunoreactivity score (IRS): PCa, 177.98 ± 94.096 vs. benign, 121.30 ± 89.596, P < 0.001; mRNA expression in the dataset: PCa, 5.67 ± 0.47 vs. benign, 5.40 ± 0.11; P < 0.001]. Additionally, as revealed by the dataset, the upregulation of CENPF mRNA expression in the PCa tissues significantly correlated with a higher Gleason score (GS, P = 0.005), an advanced pathological stage (P = 0.008), the presence of metastasis (P < 0.001), a shorter overall survival (P=0.003) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure (P < 0.001). Furthermore, both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the upregulation of CENPF was an independent predictor of poor biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival (P < 0.001 and P = 0.012, respectively). Our data suggest that the increased expression of CENPF plays an important role in the progression of PCa. More importantly, the increased expression of CENPF may efficiently predict poor BCR-free survival in patients with PCa.""","""['Yang-Jia Zhuo', 'Ming Xi', 'Yue-Ping Wan', 'Wei Hua', 'Yuan-Ling Liu', 'Song Wan', 'Yu-Lin Zhou', 'Hong-Wei Luo', 'Shu-Lin Wu', 'Wei-De Zhong', 'Chin-Lee Wu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['High expression of ASPM correlates with tumor progression and predicts poor outcome in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Overexpressed Rce1 is positively correlated with tumor progression and predicts poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of CENPF is associated with progression and poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma.', 'The association of CXCR4 expression with clinicopathological significance and potential drug target in prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'Global DNA hypomethylation in prostate cancer development and progression: a systematic review.', 'Prognostic Significance of Proliferative Markers: Cyclin D1 and CENPF in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients-A Cohort Study.', 'CENPF promotes the proliferation of renal cell carcinoma in vitro.', 'Identification of Key Prognostic Genes of Triple Negative Breast Cancer by LASSO-Based Machine Learning and Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Exome sequencing identified six copy number variations as a prediction model for recurrence of primary prostate cancers with distinctive prognosis.', 'Upregulation of CENPF is linked to aggressive features of osteosarcoma.']"""

We examined the association between LINE1 %5mC and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) risk using pre-diagnostic blood DNA from the United States-based, Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) (215 cases/436 controls), and the Alpha-tocopherol, Beta-carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC) of Finnish male smokers (191 cases/575 controls). Logistic regression adjusted for age at blood draw, study center, pack-years of smoking, body mass index, hypertension, dietary alcohol intake, family history of cancer, and sex was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using cohort and sex-specific methylation categories. In PLCO, higher, although non-significant, RCC risk was observed for participants at or above median methylation level (M2) compared to those below the median (M1) (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.96-1.95). The association was stronger in males (M2 vs. M1, OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.00-2.39) and statistically significant among male smokers (M2 vs. M1, OR: 2.60, 95% CI: 1.46-4.63). A significant interaction for smoking was also detected (P-interaction: 0.01). No association was found among females or female smokers. Findings for male smokers were replicated in ATBC (M2 vs. M1, OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07-1.60). In a pooled analysis of PLCO and ATBC male smokers (281 cases/755 controls), the OR among subjects at or above median methylation level (M2) compared to those below the median (M1) was 1.89 (95% CI: 1.34-2.67, P-value: 3 x 10(-4)); a trend was also observed by methylation quartile (P-trend: 0.002).

Materials and methods:   A total of 635 consecutive patients had their planar whole-body BS independently reviewed by three nuclear medicine physicians and classified by two grading systems: (a) a four-category scale (1: benign; 2: equivocal; 3: most likely malignant; and 4: multiple metastases) and (b) a dichotomous scale (bone metastasis present or absent).  Results:   Agreement in the same category, or with one or two categories of differences, was found in 66, 34, and 1.3% of the readings, respectively. Average κ-values were 0.59, 0.72, and 0.83 for unweighted, linear, and quadratic weighted variants, respectively. Very high agreement was observed (96% of the readings) with the dichotomous scale (average κ=0.87); a comparison with a final imaging diagnosis with additional CT or MRI showed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 98%. BS categories 1, 3, and 4 were consistent with the final imaging diagnosis in 96-99% of cases. The prevalence of metastasis was 10% in category 2. To optimize the diagnostic characteristics, category 2 should be regarded as a separate option.  Conclusion:   Close agreement was found among trained observers for the evaluation of BS in prostate cancer. The high level of agreement with a dichotomous scale was hampered by diagnostic misclassification. A scale with equivocal findings on planar BS is considered important to allow for additional imaging and correct staging at the bone level of BS in a population with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.""","""['Helle D Zacho', 'José A B Manresa', 'Jesper C Mortensen', 'Henrik Bertelsen', 'Lars J Petersen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['Prospective multicenter study of bone scintigraphy in consecutive patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Establishing the pathways and indications for performing isotope bone scans in newly diagnosed intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer - results from a large contemporaneous cohort.', 'Observer agreement of treatment responses on planar bone scintigraphy in prostate cancer patients: importance of the lesion assessment method.', 'Evaluation of osseous metastasis in bone scintigraphy.', 'A meta-analysis of ¹⁸FDG-PET-CT, ¹⁸FDG-PET, MRI and bone scintigraphy for diagnosis of bone metastases in patients with lung cancer.', 'Comparison of Bone Metastases between 18F-NaF PET/CT, 18F-NaF PET, and Planar 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Observer Agreement and Accuracy of 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT in the Diagnosis of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', 'Measuring the unmeasurable: automated bone scan index as a quantitative endpoint in prostate cancer clinical trials.', 'Skeletal standardized uptake values obtained by quantitative SPECT/CT as an osteoblastic biomarker for the discrimination of active bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Prospective evaluation of computer-assisted analysis of skeletal lesions for the staging of prostate cancer.']"""

Cancer vaccines not only need to induce a robust tumor Ag-specific immune response but also need to overcome the tolerogenic and immunosuppressive microenvironments that exist within many solid cancers. ISCOMATRIX adjuvant (ISCOMATRIX) is able to induce both tumor Ag-specific cellular and Ab responses to protect mice against tumor challenge, but this is insufficient to result in regression of established solid tumors. In the current study, we have used B16-OVA melanoma, Panc-OVA pancreatic, and TRAMP-C1 prostate cancer mouse tumor models to test therapeutic efficacy of ISCOMATRIX vaccines combined with other immune modulators. The coadministration of an ISCOMATRIX vaccine with the TLR3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, and TLR9 agonist, CpG, reduced tumor growth in all tumor models and the presence of ISCOMATRIX in the formulation was critical for the therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine. This vaccine combination induced a robust and multifunctional CD8(+) T cell response.

The functional significance of YAP in prostate cancer has remained elusive. In this study, we first show that enhanced expression of YAP is able to transform immortalized prostate epithelial cells and promote migration and invasion in both immortalized and cancerous prostate cells. We found that YAP mRNA was upregulated in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells (LNCaP-C81 and LNCaP-C4-2 cells) compared to the level in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Importantly, ectopic expression of YAP activated androgen receptor signaling and was sufficient to promote LNCaP cells from an androgen-sensitive state to an androgen-insensitive state in vitro, and YAP conferred castration resistance in vivo. Accordingly, YAP knockdown greatly reduced the rates of migration and invasion of LNCaP-C4-2 cells and under androgen deprivation conditions largely blocked cell division in LNCaP-C4-2 cells. Mechanistically, we found that extracellular signal-regulated kinase-ribosomal s6 kinase signaling was downstream of YAP for cell survival, migration, and invasion in androgen-insensitive cells. Finally, immunohistochemistry showed significant upregulation and hyperactivation of YAP in castration-resistant prostate tumors compared to their levels in hormone-responsive prostate tumors. Together, our results identify YAP to be a novel regulator in prostate cancer cell motility, invasion, and castration-resistant growth and as a potential therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).""","""['Lin Zhang', 'Shuping Yang', 'Xingcheng Chen', 'Seth Stauffer', 'Fang Yu', 'Subodh M Lele', 'Kai Fu', 'Kaustubh Datta', 'Nicholas Palermo', 'Yuanhong Chen', 'Jixin Dong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['KIBRA promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and motility.', 'Wnt signaling promotes androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation through up-regulation of the hippo pathway effector YAP.', 'Expression of netrin-1 by hypoxia contributes to the invasion and migration of prostate carcinoma cells by regulating YAP activity.', 'The Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'The dual functions of YAP-1 to promote and inhibit cell growth in human malignancy.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'AR activates YAP/TAZ differentially in prostate cancer.', 'NEK1-Mediated Phosphorylation of YAP1 Is Key to Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'TPM2 attenuates progression of prostate cancer by blocking PDLIM7-mediated nuclear translocation of YAP1.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

One of the distinct characteristics of prostate cancer is overexpression of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 1 (SENP1), and the upregulation of SENP1 contributes to the malignant progression and cell proliferation of PCa. Previous studies have shown that the expression of microRNA-145 (miRNA-145) was extensively deregulated in PCa cell lines and primary clinical prostate cancer samples. Independent target prediction methods have indicated that the 3'-untranslated region of SENP1 mRNA is a potential target of miR-145. Here we found that low expression of miR-145 was correlated with high expression of SENP1 in PCa cell line PC-3. The transient introduction of miR-145 caused cell cycle arrest in PC-3 cells, and the opposite effect was observed when miR-145 inhibitor was transfected.

The roles for cancer stem cells have been demonstrated for some cancers, such as cancers of the hematopoietic system, breast, brain, prostate, pancreas and liver. The attractive idea about cancer stem cell hypothesis is that it could partially explain the concept of minimal residual disease. After surgical macroscopically zero residual (R0) resections, even the persistence of one single cell nestling in one of the so called ""CSCs niches"" could give rise to distant relapse. Furthermore the metastatic cells can remain in a ""dormant status"" and give rise to disease after long period of apparent disease free. These cells in many cases have acquired resistance traits to chemo and radiotherapy making adjuvant treatment vain. Clarifying the role of the cancer stem cells and their implications in the oncogenesis will play an important role in the management of cancer patient by identifying new prospective for drugs and specific markers to prevent and monitoring relapse and metastasis. The identification of the niche where the CSCs reside in a dormant status might represent a valid instrument to follow-up patients also after having obtained a R0 surgical resection. What we believe is that if new diagnostic instruments were developed specifically to identify the localization and status of activity of the CSCs during tumor dormancy, this would lead to impressive improvement in the early detection and management of relapse and metastasis.""","""[""V D'Andrea"", 'S Guarino', 'F M Di Matteo', 'M Maugeri Saccà', 'R De Maria']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""G Chir""","""['Vascular determinants of cancer stem cell dormancy--do age and coagulation system play a role?', 'Tumor dormancy and cancer stem cells: two sides of the same coin?', 'Cancer stem cells as functional biomarkers.', 'Cancer stem cell niche: the place to be.', 'Cancer stem cell: fundamental experimental pathological concepts and updates.', 'Wingless/It/β-catenin signaling in liver metastasis from colorectal cancer: A focus on biological mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities.', 'Delivery of an immunogenic cell death-inducing copper complex to cancer stem cells using polymeric nanoparticles.', 'Novel piRNA MW557525 regulates the growth of Piwil2-iCSCs and maintains their stem cell pluripotency.', 'CAR-T therapy: Prospects in targeting cancer stem cells.', 'Cancer stem cells and strategies for targeted drug delivery.']"""

Exposed to ephrin-A1 PC3 prostate cancer cells alter adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. However, whether PC3 cells increase or reduce adhesion, and by which mechanisms they change adhesion to the ECM remains to be characterized. Here, we assay how ephrin-A1 stimulates PC3 cells to adhere to ECM proteins using single-cell force spectroscopy. We find that PC3 cells binding to immobilized ephrin-A1 but not to solubilized ephrin-A1 specifically strengthen adhesion to collagen I. This Eph-ephrin-A1 signaling, which we suppose is based on mechanotransduction, stimulates β1-subunit containing integrin adhesion via the protein kinase Akt and the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor cytohesin. Inhibiting the small GTPases, Rap1 or Rac1, generally lowered adhesion of PC3 prostate cancer cells. Our finding suggests a mechanism by which PC3 prostate cancer cells exposed to ephrins crosstalk to β1-integrins and preferably metastasize in bone, a collagen I rich tissue.""","""['Miao Yu', 'Jinghe Wang', 'Daniel J Muller', 'Jonne Helenius']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['EphA receptors and ephrin-A ligands are upregulated by monocytic differentiation/maturation and promote cell adhesion and protrusion formation in HL60 monocytes.', 'Eph-ephrin A system regulates human choriocarcinoma-derived JEG-3 cell invasion.', 'Ephrin-A1 stimulates migration of CD8+CCR7+ T lymphocytes.', 'The role of proteases in regulating Eph/ephrin signaling.', 'Eph/ephrin signaling in morphogenesis, neural development and plasticity.', 'Inadequate tissue mineralization promotes cancer cell attachment.', 'Blood vessels guide Schwann cell migration in the adult demyelinated CNS through Eph/ephrin signaling.', 'HDAC Inhibition Counteracts Metastatic Re-Activation of Prostate Cancer Cells Induced by Chronic mTOR Suppression.', 'The osteoprogenitor-specific loss of ephrinB1 results in an osteoporotic phenotype affecting the balance between bone formation and resorption.', 'αV-class integrins exert dual roles on α5β1 integrins to strengthen adhesion to fibronectin.']"""

We characterized factors that are associated with aggressive treatment with radical prostatectomy or radiation for indolent prostate cancer (defined as screening-detected, low-risk disease).  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program was used to extract a cohort of 39,803 men diagnosed with prostate-specific antigen-detected, low-risk prostate cancer (clinical category T1c, Gleason score ≤6, and prostate-specific antigen <10) from 2004 to 2010. After socioeconomic profiles were generated from county-linked education and income data, multivariable logistic regression was used to determine whether there were any factors associated with high rates of aggressive treatment.  Results:   The rate of aggressive treatment among all men with indolent prostate cancer was 64.3%. Greater rates of aggressive treatment were experienced by men with high socioeconomic status, Caucasian men, and married men (P < .001 for all cases). The increased adjusted odds for receipt of aggressive therapy were 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.32; P < .001), 1.26 (95% CI, 1.21-1.32; P < .001), and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.80-1.97; P < .001) for men with high socioeconomic status, Caucasian men, and married men, respectively, compared with men with low socioeconomic status, non-Caucasian men, and unmarried men, respectively.  Conclusions:   Although men with high socioeconomic status, Caucasian men, and married men often receive the highest quality health care and have the best outcomes for many cancers, it seems that they are most at risk for the avoidable potential harms of aggressive treatment of indolent prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   Between January 2013 and January 2014, 143 patients underwent our modified 'sliding' technique for penile length and girth restoration and concomitant penile prosthesis implantation. It is based on three key elements: (i) the sliding manoeuvre for penile length restoration; (ii) potential complementary longitudinal ventral and/or dorsal tunical incisions for girth restoration; and (iii) closure of the newly created rectangular bow-shaped tunical defects with Buck's fascia only.  Results:   In all, 143 patients underwent the procedure. The causes of penile shortening and narrowing were: PD in 53.8%; severe ED with unsuccessful intracavernosal injection therapy in 21%; post-radical prostatectomy 14.7%; androgen-deprivation therapy, with or without brachytherapy or external radiotherapy, for prostate cancer in 7%; post-penile fracture in 2.1%; post-redo-hypospadias repair in 0.7%; and post-priapism in 0.7%. In patients with ED and PD, the mean (range) deviation of the penile axis was 45 (0-100)°. The mean (range) subjective penile shortening reported by patients was 3.4 (1-7) cm and shaft constriction was present in 53.8%. Malleable penile prostheses were used in 133 patients and inflatable penile prostheses were inserted in 10 patients. The median (range) follow-up was 9.7 (6-18) months. The mean (range) penile length gain was 3.1 (2-7) cm. No penile prosthesis infection caused device explantation. The average International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score increased from 24 points at baseline to 60 points at the 6-month follow-up.

A different best cut-off in each different scenario. Preliminary results""","""Introduction:   Aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of PCA3 in patients with indication to perform a new biopsy, according to the histological doubt such as High Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (HGPIN) or Atypical Small Gland Proliferation (ASAP) or the clinical suspicion.  Materials and methods:   One hundred men were enrolled. We used the PCA3 - PROGENSA™ procedure. After the PCA3 test a repeated prostate biopsy was proposed. The histological findings were correlated to the PCA3 scores. We calculated the positive predictive value (PPV), the sensibility, the specificity, the Youden's index, the ROC curves, the area under the curve (AUC) for each cut-off value of PCA3 score.  Results:   These results are preliminary, because at present only 50 of the 100 enlisted men were subjected to rebiopsy. We calculated the best cut-off PCA3 score 20 at the first diagnosis; for patients with HGPIN or ASAP at first biopsy the best sensitivity cut-off is 45; the best cutoff is 45 when you already have a diagnosis of HGPIN, and 35 for ASAP. If we normalize the PCA3 score to the prostate volume, the best cut-off would be 20, with 100% sensitivity with a prostate volume of 65 ml. All results are statistically significant. The real problem, also present in literature, is the constant presence of not diagnosed prostate cancers, for any cut-off value.  Conclusions:   Our preliminary results suggest that, to get the best diagnostic performance, it would be wrong to maintain a single cut-off, but it should be chosen according to the scenario of the patients subgroup. It is to explore the possibility to search for the PCA3 in the serum to bridge the gap of the aggressive PCa missed by the urinary test.""","""['Giuseppe Albino', 'Ettore Capoluongo', 'Sandro Rocchetti', 'Sara Palumbo', 'Cecilia Zuppi', 'Ettore Cirillo-Marucco']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['PCA3: a new tool to diagnose prostate cancer (PCa) and a guidance in biopsy decisions.

The aim of our study is to compare transperineal (TP) and transrectal (TR) approaches, in a 14-core initial prostate biopsy for CaP detection.  Material and methods:   A prospective controlled study was conducted enrolling 108 consecutive patients with a PSA level greater than 4 ng/mL and/or an abnormal DRE. TR versus TP 14-core initial prostatic biopsies were performed on 54 and 54 patients, respectively, with a randomisation ratio of 1:1.  Results:   The cancer detection rates were 46.29 (25 out of 54 patients), and 44.44% (24 out of 54 patients), respectively, using the TR or the TP approach (p = 0.846). The overall cancer core rate was significantly higher when the TP approach was used: 21.43% (162 out of 756 cores) and 16.79% (127 out of 756 cores), with the TP and the TR approach, respectively (p = 0.022).

Conclusions:   No significant differences were found in cancer detection rate, cancer core rate between TP and TR approaches for prostatic biopsy. Even in terms of complication rate or pain level, it cannot be concluded that one procedure is superior to the other one.

Materials and methods:   We identified 8,435 men newly diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in 1995 to 2012 who were enrolled in CaPSURE™. Patients were followed after primary treatment with radical prostatectomy, cryosurgery, brachytherapy, external beam radiation therapy or androgen deprivation therapy. We assessed the use of bone scan, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging after primary treatment. Factors associated with posttreatment outcomes (number of imaging tests, and time to first imaging and salvage treatment) were evaluated with multivariate Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   The incidence of posttreatment bone scan, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging was 20% or less. Last posttreatment log(prostate specific antigen) was associated with multiple posttreatment imaging. Management by radical prostatectomy, cryosurgery, external beam radiation therapy or brachytherapy vs androgen deprivation therapy was associated with a lower likelihood of posttreatment imaging. Of patients who were imaged after treatment 25% with radical prostatectomy and 9% with radiation underwent imaging before prostate specific antigen failure. The 5-year salvage treatment-free survival rate was 81%. Positive findings on posttreatment imaging were associated with a higher risk of salvage treatment.  Conclusions:   Patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy for localized disease were most likely to be imaged, primarily by bone scan. Men treated with other therapies were less likely to be imaged and tended to undergo computerized tomography.

The PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways play important roles in a variety of normal cellular processes and tumorigenesis. This study is designed to explore the relationship of these signaling pathways with multidrug resistance in prostate cancer (PCa). The PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways were investigated utilizing paclitaxel resistant DU145-TxR PCa cells and their parental non-resistant DU145 cells to determine their relationship with resistance to paclitaxel and other anticancer drugs. Our results demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways are upregulated in DU145-TxR cells compared to the DU145 cells. Inactivating these pathways using the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002 or the MAP kinase pathway inhibitor PD98059 renders the DU145-TxR cells more sensitive to paclitaxel. We investigated the effects of these inhibitors on other anticancer drugs including docetaxel, vinblastine, doxorubicin, 10-Hydroxycamptothecin (10-HCPT) and cisplatin and find that both inhibitors induces DU145-TxR cells to be more sensitive only to the microtubule-targeting drugs (paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinblastine). Furthermore, the treatment with these inhibitors induces cleaved-PARP production in DU145-TxR cells, suggesting that apoptosis induction might be one of the mechanisms for the reversal of drug resistance. In conclusion, the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways are associated with resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. Inactivating these pathways renders these PCa cells more sensitive to microtubule-targeting drugs such as paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinblastine.

Materials and methods:   The information recorded in the files of all patients (7,695 individuals) pathologically diagnosed with cancer in Imam Reza referral hospital of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences during the four year period of 2006-2009 were reviewed and analyzed using SPSS statistical software package version 16.0.  Results:   Around 61.6% of reported cancer cases were males and 38.4% were females. The most prevalent reported malignant tumors occurred at the age group of 70-79 years in males and in females these tumors were presented in the ages of 60-69 years. The most prevalent cancers among studied patients were gastrointestinal (GI) cancers with a frequency of 22.9% [gastric 10.7%, colorectal 6.9%, and esophageal 6%]. The second, third and forth prevalent cancers were blood at 16.4%, lung 13.5% and bladder 12.8%, respectively. In males the cancers of GI (25.6%) were the most prevalent followed in order of frequency by bladder (18%), blood (17.6%), lung (17.4%) and prostate (6.8%) . In females the most frequent recorded cancer was breast (24.1%) followed in order of frequency by GI (20.5%), blood (14.4%), lung (7.3%), uterus (6.2%) and ovary (5.1%) . Breast cancer was the most prevalent cancer (27%) in the age group of 40-49 years.

However, its localization and possible role in PCa cells remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that MCT2 localizes mainly at peroxisomes in PCa cells and is able to take advantage of the peroxisomal transport machinery by interacting with Pex19. We have also shown an increase in MCT2 expression from non-malignant to malignant cells that was directly correlated with its peroxisomal localization. Upon analysis of the expression of several peroxisomal β-oxidation proteins in PIN lesions and PCa cells from a large variety of human prostate samples, we suggest that MCT2 presence at peroxisomes is related to an increase in β -oxidation levels which may be crucial for malignant transformation.

The cumulative incidences of cancer in PWH and the general population were 4.7 and 1.9%, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was the major type of cancer (17 cases) in PWH; cancer rate was still increased when HCC and HIV-related cancers were excluded (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.06-2.59). There was no significant difference observed in lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer occurrence. Compared to the general population, PWH were younger at the time of cancer diagnosis (45.1 vs. 57.2 years old, P value < 0.001), and had fewer co-morbidities. Nineteen PWH with cancers died during the study period, and no bleeding-related death was recorded among these patients. The survival rate was not different between PWH and the general population, P = 0.86. In conclusion, the cumulative incidence of cancer among PWH was higher than the general population.

The development of biomarkers may be helpful to estimate tumor heterogeneity and stratify patients in terms of their risk of progression. Levels of v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG), trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), and serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) are commonly elevated in PCa, but it is unclear whether the evaluation of these 3 markers can help to discriminate patients who will have different clinical outcomes. The authors investigated whether assessment of ERG, TFF3, and SPINK1 expression could help to define clinically relevant, distinct subsets of patients with PCa.  Methods:   The cohort consisted of 279 men with PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy at Henri Mondor Hospital. Expression levels of ERG, TFF3, and SPINK1 were evaluated immunohistochemically in the prostatectomy specimens. Potential associations of ERG, TFF3, and SPINK1 with age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tumor stage, Gleason score, and biochemical recurrence, defined by PSA failure, were investigated.  Results:   Although prognostic significance was not observed for ERG or TFF3, an exclusive pattern of expression was demonstrated for TFF3 and ERG. SPINK1 expression was observed exclusively in a subgroup of cancers that expressed TFF3 (41 of 175 tumors). Moreover, SPINK1 positivity was identified as predictive of biochemical recurrence in univariate (P = .0009) and multivariate (P = .0003) analyses.  Conclusions:   The current results suggest that ERG and TFF3 characterize 2 distinct subsets of PCa, with a more aggressive subgroup of TFF3-expressing tumors that express SPINK1. Together, these findings support a rationale of screening for these biomarkers for prognostic purposes and molecular subtyping of the disease.""","""['Stéphane Terry', 'Nathalie Nicolaiew', 'Victor Basset', 'Fannie Semprez', 'Pascale Soyeux', 'Pascale Maillé', 'Francis Vacherot', 'Guillaume Ploussard', 'Arturo Londoño-Vallejo', 'Alexandre de la Taille', 'Yves Allory']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Characterization of 1577 primary prostate cancers reveals novel biological and clinicopathologic insights into molecular subtypes.', 'V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (avian)/Trefoil factor 3/high-molecular-weight cytokeratin triple immunostain: a novel tissue-based biomarker in prostate cancer with potential clinical application.', 'SPINK1 expression is tightly linked to 6q15- and 5q21-deleted ERG-fusion negative prostate cancers but unrelated to PSA recurrence.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'Loss of KLK4::KLKP1 pseudogene expression by RNA chromogenic in-situ hybridization is associated with PTEN loss and increased risk of biochemical recurrence in a cohort of middle eastern men with prostate cancer.', 'SPINK1 as a plasma marker for tumor hypoxia and a therapeutic target for radiosensitization.', 'HOXB13 and TFF3 can contribute to the prognostic stratification of prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Functional Roles of SPINK1 in Cancers.', 'Prostate epithelial genes define therapy-relevant prostate cancer molecular subtype.']"""

Recently, many studies investigating the function of EFEMP1 gene, including its roles in prostate cancer and glioma, have been reported. EFEMP1 suppressed glioma growth by modulating EGFR and AKT signaling pathway or promoted growth through the regulation of Notch pathway were identified. However, the susceptibility of EFEMP1and glioma has not been well studied to date. Here, the authors were aimed to investigate whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of EFEMP1 were associated with glioma susceptibility.  Methods:   The authors genotyped 14 common tagging SNPs of EFEMP1 gene via the Sequenom Mass ARRYiPLEX platform and assessed their association with glioma risk in a hospital-based case-control study in a Chinese Han population (979 cases and 1007 controls).  Results:   Four SNPs were significant associated with glioma risk (rs1346787, P=0.004, adjusted OR=1.49; rs3791679, P=0.014, adjusted OR=1.27; rs1346786, P=0.002, adjusted OR=1.41; rs3791675, P=0.011, adjusted OR=1.27). In further stratified analysis, all the significant SNPs except rs1346787 were associated with both low-grade gliomas and glioblastoma (GBM). In haplotype analysis, 4 haplotype blocks were identified and 2 of them were revealed significant associated with glioma, the haplotype ""AA"" (adjusted OR=1.44, P=0.005) in block 1 and haplotype ""GG"" (adjusted OR=1.65, P=0.0004) in block 2 had a 44% and 65% increased glioma risk respectively, compared with corresponding non-carriers. The results of haplotype analysis were significantly consistent with the single-locus analysis.  Conclusions:   The authors' results suggested that common genetic variants in EFEMP1 gene were associated with glioma and contributed to glioma susceptibility, which might help to reveal the mechanism of gliomas and provide new insight for the diagnosis and treatment.""","""['Shuo Zhang', 'Zhao Ye', 'Xiao Song', 'Gong Chen', 'Cong Huai', 'Qihan Wang', 'Jianping Song', 'Daru Lu', 'Yao Zhao', 'Hongyan Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Neurol Sci""","""['Impact of interaction between the G870A and EFEMP1 gene polymorphism on glioma risk in Chinese Han population.', 'Association between genetic variants of EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein1 gene and sporadic breast cancer in a Chinese Han population.', 'Assessing the association between EFEMP1 rs3791679 polymorphism and risk of glioma in a Chinese Han population.', 'Association of genetic variants in the retinoblastoma binding protein 6 gene with the risk of glioma: a case-control study in a Chinese Han population.', 'Epidemiological characteristics and genetic alterations in adult diffuse glioma in East Asian populations.', 'Development of risk prediction models for glioma based on genome-wide association study findings and comprehensive evaluation of predictive performances.', 'The associations between common SNPs of EFEMP1 gene and glioma risk in Chinese population.', 'Impact of interaction between the G870A and EFEMP1 gene polymorphism on glioma risk in Chinese Han population.', 'Integrated Analysis Identifies Molecular Signatures and Specific Prognostic Factors for Different Gastric Cancer Subtypes.', 'EFEMP1 rs3791679 polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to glioma.']"""

Methods and materials:   A cohort of 2000 consecutive patients with prostate cancer treated with iodine-125 low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy monotherapy was implanted between July 1998 and November 2007. Within this group, 89 patients had disease relapse, 13 of whom had local failure by clinical or histopathologic criteria. Postoperative computed tomography scans were available for 96.3% of cases, resulting in a data set composed of 87 relapses (including all 13 local relapses) and 1839 nonrelapsed controls. Using the VariSeed 8.0.2 software, we divided the original prostate contours into four quadrants: anterior-superior (ASQ), posterior-superior, anterior-inferior (AIQ), and posterior-inferior. DVH-derived dosimetric parameters were calculated for the whole prostate and each quadrant.  Results:   Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen, and the use of androgen-deprivation therapy were predictive of disease relapse in a multivariate Cox model.

Despite low values, dose to the ASQ was not predictive of relapse, nor were doses to the remaining three quadrants. AIQ coverage was predictive of local relapse in multivariate Cox model (p = 0.042).

However, the US black population is younger than the white population, which may bias age comparisons that do not account for the populations at risk.  Methods:   We analyzed Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data for non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites from 18 regions for the year 2010. We calculated crude mean ages at diagnosis among cases of 29 cancer types for whites and blacks. Separately, we calculated adjusted means that corrected for differences in population structure, which we obtained by fitting linear regression models to the ages at diagnosis with statistical weights specific to age and sex. Negative differences indicate younger ages in blacks, while positive differences indicate older ages in blacks. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Based on crude means, blacks were diagnosed at younger ages than whites for nearly every cancer type. However, adjustment for population structure shifted the comparisons toward older ages among blacks, and only six statistically significant differences of three or more years remained. Blacks were younger than whites at diagnosis for Kaposi sarcoma (-10.2 years), male soft tissue cancer (-5.6), male anal cancer (-5.5), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (-3.7), but older for cervical cancer (+4.7 years) and female thyroid cancer (+3.3). Smaller differences (<3 years) were present for female breast, female colon, lung, pancreas, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers (all P ≤ .001).  Conclusions:   Most differences between blacks and whites in the age at cancer diagnosis are small.

The quantification utilized a new derivatization procedure, which formed analytes as pre-ionized N-methyl pyridinium-3-sulfonyl (NMPS) derivatives. This method required only 0.1mL of human serum, yet was capable of simultaneously quantifying six estrogens within 20min. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for estradiol (E2), 16α-hydroxy (OH)-E2, 4-methoxy (MeO)-E2 and 2-MeO-E2 was 1fg on column, and was 10fg on column for 4-OH-E2 and 2-OH-E2. All analytes demonstrated a linear response from 0.5 to 200pg/mL (5-2000pg/mL for 4-OH-E2 and 2-OH-E2).

Methods:   In this cross-sectional study, 126 clinicians at 24 family/internal medicine practices completed surveys in which they listed and rated the magnitude of colonoscopy and PSA testing benefits and harms for a hypothetical 70-year-old male patient and then estimated the likelihood that these tests would cause harm and lengthen the life of 100 similar men in the next 10 years. We tested the hypothesis that the availability heuristic would explain the association of screening test to perceived likelihood of benefit/harm and a competing hypothesis that clinicians' gist of screening tests as good or bad would mediate this association.  Results:   Clinicians perceived PSA testing to have a greater likelihood of harm and a lower likelihood of lengthening life relative to colonoscopy. Consistent with our gist hypothesis, these associations were mediated by clinicians' gist of screening (balance of perceived benefits to perceived harms).  Limitations:   Generalizability beyond academic clinicians remains to be established.

Herein, we present a comprehensive report on the trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Japan using recent population-based data. National cancer mortality data between 1958 and 2013 were obtained from published vital statistics. Cancer incidence data between 1985 and 2010 were obtained from high-quality population-based cancer registries of three prefectures (Yamagata, Fukui and Nagasaki). Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to examine the trends in age-standardized rates of cancer incidence and mortality. All-cancer mortality decreased from the mid-1990s, with an annual percent change of -1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.4, -1.3). During the most recent 10 years, over 60% of the decrease in cancer mortality was accounted for by a decrease in stomach and liver cancers (63% for males and 66% for females). The long-term increase in female breast cancer mortality, beginning in the 1960s, plateaued in 2008. All-cancer incidence continuously increased, with annual percent changes of 0.6% (95% CI: 0.5, 0.8) between 1985 and 2005, and 1.8% (95% CI: 0.6, 2.9) between 2005 and 2010. During the most recent 10 years, almost half of the increase in cancer incidence was accounted for by an increase in prostate cancer (60%) in males and breast cancer (46%) in females. The cancer registry quality indices also began to increase from ∼2005. Decreases in stomach and liver cancers observed for incidence and mortality reflect the reduced attribution of infection-related factors (i.e. Helicobacter pylori and hepatitis virus). However, it should be noted that cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates began to increase from ∼1990.""","""['Kota Katanoda', 'Megumi Hori', 'Tomohiro Matsuda', 'Akiko Shibata', 'Yoshikazu Nishino', 'Masakazu Hattori', 'Midori Soda', 'Akiko Ioka', 'Tomotaka Sobue', 'Hiroshi Nishimoto']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Jpn J Clin Oncol""","""['An updated report of the trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Japan.', 'Updated Trends in Cancer in Japan: Incidence in 1985-2015 and Mortality in 1958-2018-A Sign of Decrease in Cancer Incidence.', 'Trend analysis of cancer incidence in Japan using data from selected population-based cancer registries.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Trends in cancer incidence in Singapore 1968-1982.', 'Correlation between the Chemiluminescent Activity of Neutrophilic Granulocytes and the Lipid Peroxidation-Antioxidant Defense System in Gastric Cancer Associated with Helicobacter pylori Infection.', 'Characteristics of alpha-fetoprotein-positive gastric cancer revealed by analysis of cancer databases and transcriptome sequencing data.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality in Brunei Darussalam, 2011 to 2020.', 'Fifteen-year survival and conditional survival of women with breast cancer in Osaka, Japan: A population-based study.', 'LSR antibody promotes apoptosis and disrupts epithelial barriers via signal pathways in endometrial cancer.']"""

The two cell lines were treated with the anti-tumour agent etoposide for 1-3days. Measurements by holographic microscopy showed significant differences in average cell number, confluence, volume and area when comparing etoposide-treated with untreated cells. The cell volume of the treated cell lines was initially increased at early time-points. By time, cells decreased in volume, especially when treated with high doses of etoposide.

Current therapies using bisphosphonates provide modest improvement, but cytotoxic side effects still occur prompting the need to develop more effective therapies to target aggressive osteoclastogenesis. Increased levels of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (TNFSF11/RANKL), leading to RANKL-RANK signaling, remain the key axis for osteoclast activation and bone resorption. Osteoprotegerin (TNFRSF11B/OPG), a decoy receptor for RANKL, is significantly decreased in patients who present with bone lesions. Despite its potential in inhibiting osteoclast activation, OPG also binds to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TNFSF10/TRAIL), making tumor cells resistant to apoptosis. Toward uncoupling the events of TRAIL binding of OPG and to improve its utility for bone remodeling without inducing tumor resistance to apoptosis, OPG mutants were developed by structural homology modeling based on interactive domain identification and by superimposing models of OPG, TRAIL, and its receptor DR5 (TNFRSF10B) to identify regions of OPG for rational design. The OPG mutants were purified and extensively characterized for their ability to decrease osteoclast damage without affecting tumor apoptosis pathway both in vitro and in vivo, confirming their potential in bone remodeling following cancer-induced osteolytic damage.

However, the exact mechanisms of miR-203 in PCa are not entirely clear.  Methods:   We examined the expression of miR-203 in prostate cancer tissues, adjacent normal tissues, PCa cell lines and normal prostate epithelial cells by qRT-PCR. Then, the effects of miR-203 or Rap1A on proliferation, adhesion and invasion of PCa cells were assayed using CKK-8, adhesion analysis, and transwell invasion assays. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to assess miR-203 binding to Rap1A mRNA. Tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of cells into BALB/c nude mice.  Results:   Here, we confirmed that the expression of miR-203 was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer specimens compared with matched adjacent normal prostate specimens. Mechanistic dissection revealed that miR-203 mediated cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo, as evidenced by reduced RAC1, p-PAK1, and p-MEK1 expression. In addition, we identified Rap1A as a direct target suppressed by miR-203, and there was an inverse relationship between the expression of miR-203 and Rap1A in PCa. Knockdown of Rap1A phenocopied the effects of miR-203 on PCa cell growth and invasion. Furthermore, Rap1A over-expression in PCa cells partially reversed the effects of miR-203-expression on cell adhesion and invasion.

This study compared SVEC mouse endothelial and PC-3 human prostate tumor cells in the response to verteporfin-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) and a pan-PI3K pathway inhibitor LY294002.  Methods:   Verteporfin cellular uptake and intracellular localization was determined by spectrofluorometry and confocal fluorescence microscopy, respectively, in the SVEC and PC-3 cells. Cytotoxicity induced by LY294002 and verteporfin-PDT was assessed by the MTS assay. Effects of treatments on cell survival and death signaling were examined by Western blot analysis.  Results:   PC-3 cells had a higher cellular uptake of verteporfin than SVEC cells at 15min after incubation with verteporfin. Verteporfin was mainly localized in mitochondria in both SVEC and PC-3 cells. Verteporfin-PDT alone as well as PDT in combination with LY294002 induced more apoptosis and caused more reduction in cell viability in SVEC cells than in PC-3 cells. PC-3 cells exhibited a higher level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins than SVEC cells.  Conclusions:   SVEC cells were more responsive to verteporfin-PDT and PI3K pathway inhibitor LY294002 than PC-3 cells. Such differences in response were likely due to differences in Bcl-2 family protein level.

Possible factors causing discrepancies in optimal NTCP model parameters between 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and intensity modulated RT (IMRT) were analyzed and discussed, including the impact of patient characteristics, image guidance, toxicity scoring bias, and NTCP model limitations.  Methods and materials:   Rectal wall dose-volume histograms of 1115 patients treated for prostate cancer under an adaptive radiation therapy protocol were used to model gastrointestinal toxicity grade ≥2 (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events). A total of 457 patients were treated with 3D-CRT and 658 with IMRT. 3D-CRT patients were matched to IMRT patients based on various patient characteristics, using a propensity score-based algorithm. Parameters of the Lyman equivalent uniform dose and cut-off dose logistic regression NTCP models were estimated for the 2 matched treatment modalities and the combined group.  Results:   After they were matched, the 3D-CRT and IMRT groups contained 275 and 550 patients with a large discrepancy of 28.7% versus 7.8% toxicities, respectively (P<.001). For both NTCP models, optimal parameters found for the 3D-CRT groups did not fit the IMRT patients well and vice versa. Models developed for the combined data overestimated NTCP for the IMRT patients and underestimated NTCP for the 3D-CRT group.  Conclusions:   Our analysis did not reveal a single definitive cause for discrepancies of model parameters between 3D-CRT and IMRT. Patient characteristics and bias in toxicity scoring, as well as image guidance alone, are unlikely causes of the large discrepancy of toxicities. Whether the cause was inherent to the specific NTCP models used in this study needs to be verified by future investigations. Because IMRT is increasingly used clinically, it is important that appropriate NTCP model parameters are determined for this treatment modality.""","""['Almut Troeller', 'Di Yan', 'Ovidiu Marina', 'Derek Schulze', 'Markus Alber', 'Katia Parodi', 'Claus Belka', 'Matthias Söhn']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Improved toxicity profile following high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation therapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Comparison of rectal dose-wall histogram versus dose-volume histogram for modeling the incidence of late rectal bleeding after radiotherapy.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy causes fewer side effects than three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy when used in combination with brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of toxicity after IMRT and 3D-conformal radiotherapy for patients with pancreatic cancer - a systematic review.', 'Late gastrointestinal tissue effects after hypofractionated radiation therapy of the pancreas.', 'Predictive modelling for late rectal and urinary toxicities after prostate radiotherapy using planned and delivered dose.', 'Development and Implementation of Proton Therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma: Challenges and Perspectives.', 'Half-Brain Delineation for Prediction of Radiation-Induced Temporal Lobe Injury in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Receiving Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy.', 'Detecting spatial susceptibility to cardiac toxicity of radiation therapy for lung cancer.', 'Roadmap: proton therapy physics and biology.']"""

We conducted a comprehensive assessment of risks of second cancer according to RT technique (>10 MV vs ≤10 MV and 3-dimensional [3D] vs 2D RT) and modality (external beam RT, brachytherapy, and combined modes) in a large cohort of prostate cancer patients.  Methods and materials:   The cohort was constructed using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database. We included cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in patients 66 to 84 years of age from 1992 to 2004 and followed through 2009. We used Poisson regression analysis to compare rates of second cancer across RT groups with adjustment for age, follow-up, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and comorbidities. Analyses of second solid cancers were based on the number of 5-year survivors (n=38,733), and analyses of leukemia were based on number of 2-year survivors (n=52,515) to account for the minimum latency period for radiation-related cancer.  Results:   During an average of 4.4 years' follow-up among 5-year prostate cancer survivors (2DRT = 5.5 years; 3DRT = 3.9 years; and brachytherapy = 2.7 years), 2933 second solid cancers were diagnosed. There were no significant differences in second solid cancer rates overall between 3DRT and 2DRT patients (relative risk [RR] = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-1.09), but second rectal cancer rates were significantly lower after 3DRT (RR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40-0.88). Rates of second solid cancers for higher- and lower-energy RT were similar overall (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.89-1.06), as were rates for site-specific cancers. There were significant reductions in colon cancer and leukemia rates in the first decade after brachytherapy compared to those after external beam RT.  Conclusions:   Advanced treatment planning may have reduced rectal cancer risks in prostate cancer survivors by approximately 3 cases per 1000 after 15 years. Despite concerns about the neutron doses, we did not find evidence that higher energy therapy was associated with increased second cancer risks.""","""['Amy Berrington de Gonzalez', 'Jeannette Wong', 'Ruth Kleinerman', 'Clara Kim', 'Lindsay Morton', 'Justin E Bekelman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Second neoplasms after percutaneous radiotherapy.', 'Second malignancies after prostate brachytherapy: incidence of bladder and colorectal cancers in patients with 15 years of potential follow-up.', 'Radiation therapy for prostate cancer increases subsequent risk of bladder and rectal cancer: a population based cohort study.', 'Time Course and Accumulated Risk of Severe Urinary Adverse Events After High- Versus Low-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy With or\xa0Without External Beam Radiation Therapy.', 'Secondary Cancers After Radiation Therapy for Primary Prostate or Rectal Cancer.', 'Risk prediction of second primary malignancies after gynecological malignant neoplasms resection with and without radiation therapy: a population-based surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) analysis.', 'Assessment of hOGG1 Genetic Polymorphism (rs1052133) and DNA Damage in Radiation-Exposed Workers.', 'Treatment of rectal cancer after previous prostate cancer: A single institution experience.', 'Secondary malignancies after radiation therapy in prostate cancer survivors: a propensity-score matched competing-risk analysis.', 'Urological complications after radiation therapy-nothing ventured, nothing gained: a Narrative Review.']"""

We compared the diagnostic specificity of PHI to prebiopsy total and percent free prostate specific antigen using prostate biopsy results.

The tumor antigens targeted by transferred lymphocytes affects the efficacy of this therapeutic approach. Because cancer stem cells (CSCs) play an important role in tumor growth and metastasis, we hypothesized that adoptive transfer of T cells targeting a CSC antigen could result in dramatic anti-tumor effects.  Results:   An EpCAM-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) was constructed to transduce human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and thereby enable them to target the CSC marker EpCAM. To investigate the therapeutic capabilities of PBLs expressing EpCAM-specific CARs, we used two different tumor models, PC3, the human prostate cancer cell line, which has low expression levels of EpCAM, and PC3M, a highly metastatic clone of PC3 that has high expression levels of EpCAM. We demonstrate that CAR-expressing PBLs can kill PC3M tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Despite the low expression of EpCAM on PC3 cells, CAR-expressing PBLs significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival in a PC3 metastasis model, probably by targeting the highly proliferative and metastatic population of cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrate that PBLs expressing with EpCAM-specific CARs have significant anti-tumor activity against prostate cancer.

Subsequently, we demonstrated the effects of GPCR48/LGR4 on the migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, including Du145 and PC-3 cells. Next, we investigated the relationship between GPCR48/LGR4 and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. The results showed that the overexpression of GPCR48/LGR4 was associated with the up-regulation of Akt, a key effector of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which meantime up-regulated the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), while down-regulated forkhead box, class O (FOXO), all of whom are the downstream targets of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

In this study, we investigated the clinical significance of CIP2A and its function in our large collection of prostate samples. Between August 2000 and December 2013, 126 patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer (PCa) and 92 with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) were recruited into the study. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to quantify CIP2A expression in PCa clinical samples and cell lines. The relationships between CIP2A expression and clinicopathological features were analyzed. The functional role of CIP2A in PCa cells was evaluated by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the protein followed by analyses of cell proliferation and invasion. High expression of CIP2A staining was 86.51 % (109/126) in 126 cases of PCa and 17.39 % (16/92) in 92 cases of BPH; the difference of CIP2A expression between PCa and BPH was statistically significant. CIP2A was significantly elevated in all five PCa cell lines when compared to the RWPE-1 cells at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Silencing of CIP2A inhibited the proliferation of DU-145 cells which have a relatively high level of CIP2A in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and the invasion and migration of DU-145 cells were distinctly suppressed. Furthermore, CIP2A knockdown led to substantial reductions in c-Myc levels in DU-145 cells, but no significant change in phosphorylated Akt expression after CIP2A knockdown in DU-145 cells. Our data suggest that the pathogenesis of human PCa maybe mediated by CIP2A, and CIP2A inhibition treatment may provide a promising strategy for the antitumor therapy of PCa, and thus, CIP2A could represent selective targets for the molecularly targeted treatments of PCa.""","""['Zexiong Guo', 'Dehao Liu', 'Zexuan Su']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Erratum to: CIP2A mediates prostate cancer progression via the c-MYC signaling pathway.', 'Retraction Note to multiple articles in Tumor Biology.', 'CIP2A mediates prostate cancer progression via the c-MYC signaling pathway.', 'CC-chemokine receptor 7 is overexpressed and correlates with growth and metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of CIP2A is an independent prognostic indicator in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and its depletion suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth.', 'The role of CIP2A in cancer: A review and update.', 'Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, an emerging human oncoprotein and a potential cancer therapy target.', 'Genomic Interplay between Neoneurogenesis and Neoangiogenesis in Carcinogenesis: Therapeutic Interventions.']"""

The objective was to determine if consultation audio-recording improves quality of life, reduces regret or improves patient satisfaction in comparison to standard counselling.  Patients and methods:   In 2012 we initiated consultation audio-recordings, where patients are given a CD of their consultation to keep and replay at home. We conducted a prospective non-randomised study of patient satisfaction, quality of life (QOL) and decision regret at 12 months follow-up using posted validated questionnaires for the audio-recording (AR) patients and a control cohort. Qualitative and thematic analyses were used.  Results:   Forty of 59 patients in the AR group, and 27 of 45 patients in the control group returned the questionnaires. Patient demographics were similar in both groups with no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Decision regret was lower in the audio-recording group (11/100) vs control group (19/100) (p = 0.04). The risk ratio for not having any long-term decision regret was 5.539 (CI 1.643-18.674), with NNT to prevent regret being 4. Regression analysis showed that receiving audio-recording was strongest predictor for absence of regret even greater than potency and incontinence.  Conclusion:   The study has shown that audio-recording clinic consultation reduces long-term decision regret, increases patient information recall, understanding and confidence in their decision.

In this study, we found significant down-regulation of WWOX in prostate cancer specimens and prostate cancer cell lines compared with the normal controls. In addition, an ectopically increased WWOX expression repressed tumor progression both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, overexpression of WWOX in 22Rv1 cells led to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase but did not affect sub-G1 in flow cytometry. GFP-WWOX overexpressed 22Rv1 cells were shown to inhibit cell cycle progression into mitosis under nocodazole treatment in flow cytometry, immunoblotting and GFP fluorescence. Further, cyclin D1 but not apoptosis correlated genes were down-regulated by WWOX both in vitro and in vivo. Restoration of cyclin D1 in the WWOX-overexpressed 22Rv1 cells could abolish the WWOX-mediated tumor repression. In addition, WWOX impair c-Jun-mediated cyclin D1 promoter activity.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the risk of tumor under-grading and -staging for AS eligibility. Moreover, we analyzed possible biomarkers for predicting more unfavorable final tumor histology.  Methods:   197 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RPE) but would have met the EAU (European Association of Urology) criteria for AS (PSA<10 ng/ml, biopsy GS ≤ 6, ≤ 2 cancer-positive biopsy cores with ≤ 50% of tumor in any core and clinical stage ≤ T2a) were included in the study. These AS inclusion parameters were correlated to the final histology of the RPE specimens. The impact of preoperative PSA level (low PSA ≤ 4 ng/ml vs. intermediate PSA of >4-10 ng/ml), PSA density (<15 vs. ≥ 15 ng/ml) and the number of positive biopsy cores (1 vs. 2 positive cores) on predicting upgrading and final adverse histology of the RPE specimens was analyzed in uni- and multivariate analyses. Moreover, clinical courses of undergraded patients were assessed.  Results:   In our patient cohort 41.1% were found under-graded in the biopsy (final histology 40.1% GS7, 1% GS8). Preoperative PSA levels, PSA density or the number of positive cores were not predictive for worse final pathological findings including GS >6, extraprostatic extension and positive resection margin (R1) or correlated significantly with up-grading and/or extraprostatic extension in a multivariate model. Only R1 resections were predictable by combining intermediate PSA levels with two positive biopsy cores (p = 0.004). Sub-analyses showed that the number of biopsy cores (10 vs. 15 biopsy cores) had no influence on above mentioned results on predicting biopsy undergrading. Clinical courses of patients showed that 19.9% of patients had a biochemical relapse after RPE, among all of them were undergraded in the initial biopsy.  Conclusion:   In summary, this study shows that a multitude of patients fulfilling the criteria for AS are under-diagnosed. The use of preoperative PSA levels, PSA density and the number of positive cores were not predictable for undergrading in the present patient collective.""","""['Isabel Heidegger', 'Viktor Skradski', 'Eberhard Steiner', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Renate Pichler', 'Andreas Pircher', 'Wolfgang Horninger', 'Jasmin Bektic']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Adverse pathological findings in needle biopsy gleason score 6 prostate cancers with low and intermediate preoperative PSA levels following radical prostatectomy.', 'Pathological upgrading in prostate cancer patients eligible for active surveillance: Does prostate-specific antigen density matter?', 'The percent of cores positive for cancer in prostate needle biopsy specimens is strongly predictive of tumor stage and volume at radical prostatectomy.', 'Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Predictors of adverse pathologic features after radical prostatectomy in low-risk prostate cancer.', 'SATB1, genomic instability and Gleason grading constitute a novel risk score for prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of Serum Markers with Regard to Treatment Procedures in Advanced Stage Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Identification of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer by Combined PCA3 and AMACR mRNA Detection in Urine Samples.', 'Liquid Biopsy Potential Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Simplified Luminal Water Imaging for the Detection of Prostate Cancer From Multiecho T2 MR Images.']"""

To date, 86 established prostate cancer risk variants have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To determine if these risk variants are located near genes that interact together in biological networks or pathways contributing to prostate cancer initiation or progression, we generated gene sets based on proximity to the 86 prostate cancer risk variants. We took two approaches to generate gene lists. The first strategy included all immediate flanking genes, up- and downstream of the risk variant, regardless of distance from the index variant, and the second strategy included genes closest to the index GWAS marker and to variants in high LD (r2 ≥0.8 in Europeans) with the index variant, within a 100 kb window up- and downstream. Pathway mapping of the two gene sets supported the importance of the androgen receptor-mediated signaling in prostate cancer biology. In addition, the hedgehog and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways were identified in pathway mapping for the flanking gene set. We also used the HaploReg resource to examine the 86 risk loci and variants high LD (r2 ≥0.8) for functional elements. We found that there was a 12.8 fold (p = 2.9 x 10-4) enrichment for enhancer motifs in a stem cell line and a 4.4 fold (p = 1.1 x 10-3) enrichment of DNase hypersensitivity in a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line, indicating that the risk and correlated variants are enriched for transcriptional regulatory motifs. Our pathway-based functional annotation of the prostate cancer risk variants highlights the potential regulatory function that GWAS risk markers, and their highly correlated variants, exert on genes.

In cancer, a frequent mechanism that can produce gene fusions is chromosomal rearrangement. However, recent discoveries of RNA trans-splicing and cis-splicing between adjacent genes (cis-SAGe) support for other mechanisms in generating fusion RNAs. In our transcriptome analyses of 28 prostate normal and cancer samples, 30% fusion RNAs on average are the transcripts that contain exons belonging to same-strand neighboring genes. These fusion RNAs may be the products of cis-SAGe, which was previously thought to be rare. To validate this finding and to better understand the phenomenon, we used LNCaP, a prostate cell line as a model, and identified 16 additional cis-SAGe events by silencing transcription factor CTCF and paired-end RNA sequencing. About half of the fusions are expressed at a significant level compared to their parental genes. Silencing one of the in-frame fusions resulted in reduced cell motility. Most out-of-frame fusions are likely to function as non-coding RNAs. The majority of the 16 fusions are also detected in other prostate cell lines, as well as in the 14 clinical prostate normal and cancer pairs. By studying the features associated with these fusions, we developed a set of rules: 1) the parental genes are same-strand-neighboring genes; 2) the distance between the genes is within 30kb; 3) the 5' genes are actively transcribing; and 4) the chimeras tend to have the second-to-last exon in the 5' genes joined to the second exon in the 3' genes. We then randomly selected 20 neighboring genes in the genome, and detected four fusion events using these rules in prostate cancer and non-cancerous cells. These results suggest that splicing between neighboring gene transcripts is a rather frequent phenomenon, and it is not a feature unique to cancer cells.""","""['Fujun Qin', 'Zhenguo Song', 'Mihaela Babiceanu', 'Yansu Song', 'Loryn Facemire', 'Ritambhara Singh', 'Mazhar Adli', 'Hui Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['Correction: discovery of CTCF-sensitive cis-spliced fusion RNAs between adjacent genes in human prostate cells.', 'Recurrent cis-SAGe chimeric RNA, D2HGDH-GAL3ST2, in prostate cancer.', 'Chimeric transcript generated by cis-splicing of adjacent genes regulates prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'Role of CTCF in Regulating SLC45A3-ELK4 Chimeric RNA.', 'Intergenically Spliced Chimeric RNAs in Cancer.', 'Chimeric RNAs generated by intergenic splicing in normal and cancer cells.', 'Single-cell third-generation sequencing-based multi-omics uncovers gene expression changes governed by ecDNA and structural variants in cancer cells.', 'CTNNBIP1-CLSTN1 Functions as a Housekeeping Chimeric RNA, and Regulates Cell Proliferation through SERPINE2.', 'Preleukemic Fusion Genes Induced via Ionizing Radiation.', 'The Landscape of Expressed Chimeric Transcripts in the Blood of Severe COVID-19 Infected Patients.', 'BCL6-SPECC1L: A Novel Fusion Gene in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.']"""

Antiangiogenic targeted therapies inhibit the progression of RCC, but have limited impacts on invasion or metastasis of tumor cells. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine/threonine kinase implicated in the regulation of cell growth/survival, cell-cycle progression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion/migration, and angiogenesis. However, the role of ILK in RCC has not been evaluated. We investigated the role of ILK on cancer progression and metastasis and the therapeutic potential of ILK inhibition in RCC. Our investigation reveals that ILK is expressed at a low level in normal cells and low-stage RCC cells and is highly expressed in advanced and metastatic cells. Caki-1, a metastatic RCC cell line, showed higher expression of molecular EMT markers, including Snail and Zeb1, but decreased activity of GSK3β. Knockdown of ILK using small interference (si)-ILK minimally inhibited tumor proliferation and cell-cycle progression was not significantly affected. However, ILK knockdown suppressed the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions and impeded phenotypic EMT markers, including cell migration and invasion, in Caki-1 and UMRC-3 cells. Finally, in vivo knockdown of ILK suppressed the progression, invasion, and metastasis of primary RCC in nude mice by downregulation of EMT markers (Snail, Zeb1, vimentin, and E-cadherin). Our results show that ILK may be essential for invasion and metastasis in RCC and regulates vimentin and E-cadherin expression by regulating the EMT-related transcription factors Snail and Zeb1.

An upper transverse scrotal incision was made, followed by bulbar urethra dissection and AUS cuff placement. Through the same incision, the corpora cavernosa was exposed, and an IPP positioned. Followed by extraperitoneal reservoirs placement and pumps introduced in the scrotum. Short-term, intra- and post-operative complications; continence status and erectile function; and patient satisfaction and QoL were recorded. A total of 32 patients underwent dual implantation. Early AUS-related complications were: AUS reservoir migration and urethral erosion. One case of distal corporal extrusion occurred. No prosthetic infection was reported. Over 96% of patients were socially the continent (≤1 pad per day) and > 95% had sufficient erections for intercourse. Limitations of the study were the small number of patients, the lack of the control group using a perineal approach for AUS placement and only a 12 months follow-up. IPP and AUS dual implantation using a single scrotal incision technique is a safe and effective option in patients with SUI and ED after RP. Further studies on larger numbers of patients are warranted.""","""['Juan I Martínez-Salamanca', 'Estefanía Linares Espinós', 'Ignacio Moncada', 'Luis Del Portillo', 'Joaquín Carballido']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Surgical implantation of artificial urinary device and penile prosthesis through trans-scrotal incision for postprostatectomy urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction: synchronous or delayed procedure?', 'Preliminary Outcomes of the Male Urethral ""Mini-Sling"": A Modified Approach to the Andrianne Mini-Jupette Procedure With Penile Prosthesis Placement for Climacturia and Mild Stress Urinary Incontinence.', 'Combined inflatable penile prosthesis-artificial urinary sphincter implantation: no increased risk of adverse events compared to single or staged device implantation.', 'Contemporary Review of Artificial Urinary Sphincters for Male Stress Urinary Incontinence.', 'Simultaneous penile prosthesis and male sling/artificial urinary sphincter.', 'Simultaneous implant of inflatable penile prosthesis and artificial urinary sphincter: a single high-volume center experience.', 'Complication rates in concurrent inflatable penile prosthesis and incontinence surgery: Comparing the penoscrotal versus perineal incision approach.', 'Dual implantation of penile prosthesis and ATOMS® system for post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence: a feasibility study.', 'Concurrent Penile Prosthesis and Artificial Urinary Sphincter versus Penile Prosthesis and Male Sling: A National Multi-Institutional Analysis of National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database Comparing Postoperative Morbidity.', 'Synchronous surgery for the combined treatment of post-radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence: a lucrative evolution or an unnecessary complexity?']"""

The following cancer types were evaluated: colorectal, pancreatic, head and neck, lung, skin melanoma, breast, gynaecological, prostate, kidney and stomach cancers. The following data were recorded and analysed: crude incidence by 5-year age group; dynamics of crude incidence rates in the age group ≥70 years; disease stage; percentage of patients treated by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy; and age standardised 1-year mortality and 5-year relative survival according to age group. Patients over age 70 accounted for 41% and 46%, respectively, of the cancer incidence and mortality of the whole population. Anticancer therapies are significantly less common in patients over age 70 (P < 0.050), with the exception of skin melanoma. Survival was markedly worse in older patients (P < 0.050) when radical treatment modalities were significantly underused (P < 0.050).

Objective:   To describe QOL before and after PCa treatment in men of varying ages.  Design, setting, and participants:   Participants enrolled in CaPSURE who underwent radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, external beam radiation, androgen deprivation therapy, or active surveillance for localized PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   QOL changes over time were assessed among age groups using repeated-measures mixed models adjusted for race, year, clinical risk, treatment, comorbidities, and an age-time interaction term. Differences are reported as adjusted least-square means and percentage decline. Secondary analyses evaluated age and QOL for local (prostatectomy, radiation) compared to nonlocal treatment (hormonal, surveillance).  Results and limitations:   Older men had lower mean unadjusted pre- and post-treatment QOL scores for nearly all domains. Of the domains evaluated, adjusted mean sexual function, sexual bother, and urinary function showed greater declines from baseline to 2 yr. At 2 yr, more men <60 yr than those >70 yr experienced declines in urinary function (14% vs 9%) and sexual bother (39% vs 17%). Declines in these domains were also greater for local than for nonlocal treatment.  Conclusions:   Definitive treatment for localized disease should not be deferred for older men because of fears regarding QOL declines. Younger men should be counseled about potential post-treatment declines in QOL despite higher absolute QOL scores. Communicating these differences to patients will facilitate more appropriate treatment decision-making in men of all ages.  Patient summary:   In this study we evaluated quality of life before and after treatment for localized prostate cancer in a diverse patient population. Declines in quality of life after treatment varied according to age and treatment. We conclude that counseling about quality of life will help patients of all ages to make more appropriate treatment decisions.""","""['Lindsay A Hampson', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Shoujun Zhao', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Long-term health-related quality of life after primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: results from the CaPSURE registry.', 'Age and baseline quality of life at radical prostatectomy--who has the most to lose?', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Quality of Life Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Quality of life outcomes following treatment for localized prostate cancer: is there a clear winner?', 'Patient decision-making for surgical treatment of post-prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence: a mixed-methods exploratory pilot study.', 'Health-related quality of life in cancer immunotherapy: a systematic perspective, using causal loop diagrams.', 'Symptom burden profiles in men with advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Width of spared neurovascular bundle after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer: is it a reliable factor for predicting postoperative sexual outcome?', 'Role of regenerative therapies on erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   Pre-biopsy MRI and TRUS were each scaled on a 3-point score: highly suspicious, likely, and unlikely for clinically significant cancer (sPCa).

Biopsy histological outcomes were retrospectively compared with MR suspicion level and TRUS-visibility of the MR-suspicious lesion. sPCa was defined as biopsy Gleason score ≥7 and/or maximum cancer core length ≥5 mm.  Results:   Targeted biopsies outperformed systematic biopsies in overall cancer detection rate (61 vs. 41 %; p = 0.007), sPCa detection rate (43 vs. 23 %; p = 0.0013), cancer core length (7.5 vs. 3.9 mm; p = 0.0002), and cancer rate per core (56 vs. 12 %; p < 0.0001), respectively. Highly suspicious lesions on mp-MR correlated with higher positive biopsy rate (p < 0.0001), higher Gleason score (p = 0.018), and greater cancer core length (p < 0.0001). Highly suspicious lesions on TRUS in corresponding to MR-suspicious lesion had a higher biopsy yield (p < 0.0001) and higher sPCa detection rate (p < 0.0001).

Here, we examine whether patients experience differences in acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse effects.  Methods:   In this randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial, done in seven radiotherapy centres in the Netherlands, we enrolled intermediate-risk or high-risk patients aged between 44 and 85 years with histologically confirmed stage T1b-T4 NX-0MX-0 prostate cancer, a PSA concentration of 60 ng/mL or lower, and WHO performance status of 0-2. A web-based application was used to randomly assign (1:1) patients to receive either standard fractionation with 39 fractions of 2 Gy in 8 weeks (five fractions per week) or hypofractionation with 19 fractions of 3·4 Gy in 6·5 weeks (three fractions per week). Randomisation was done with minimisation procedure, stratified by treatment centre and risk group. The primary endpoint is 5-year relapse-free survival. Here we report data for the acute toxicity outcomes: the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity. Non-inferiority of hypofractionation was tested separately for genitourinary and gastrointestinal acute toxic effects, with a null hypothesis that cumulative incidences of each type of adverse event were not more than 8% higher in the hypofractionation group than in the standard fractionation group. We scored acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxic effects according to RTOG-EORTC criteria from both case report forms and patients' self-assessment questionnaires, at baseline, twice during radiotherapy, and 3 months after completion of radiotherapy. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. Patient recruitment has been completed. This study is registered with www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN85138529.  Findings:   Between March 19, 2007, and Dec 3, 2010, 820 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with standard fractionation (n=410) or hypofractionation (n=410). 3 months after radiotherapy, 73 (22%) patients in the standard fractionation group and 75 (23%) patients in the hypofractionation group reported grade 2 or worse genitourinary toxicity; grade 2 or worse gastrointestinal toxicity was noted in 43 (13%) patients in the standard fractionation group and in 42 (13%) in the hypofractionation group. Grade 4 acute genitourinary toxicity was reported for two patients, one (<1%) in each group. No grade 4 acute gastrointestinal toxicities were observed. We noted no significant difference in cumulative incidence by 120 days after radiotherapy of grade 2 or worse acute genitourinary toxicity (57·8% [95% CI 52·9-62·7] in the standard fractionation group vs 60·5% (55·8-65·3) in the hypofractionation group; difference 2·7%, 90% CI -2·99 to 8·48; odds ratio [OR] 1·12, 95% CI 0·84-1·49; p=0·43). The cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute gastrointestinal toxicity by 120 days after radiotherapy was higher in patients given hypofractionation (31·2% [95% CI 26·6-35·8] in the standard fractionation group vs 42·0% [37·2-46·9] in the hypofractionation group; difference 10·8%, 90% CI 5·25-16·43; OR 1·6; p=0·0015; non-inferiority not confirmed).  Interpretation:   Hypofractionated radiotherapy was not non-inferior to standard fractionated radiotherapy in terms of acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity for men with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer. In fact, the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute gastrointestinal toxicity was significantly higher in patients given hypofractionation than in those given standard fractionated radiotherapy.

Free human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 was targeted in prostate cancer xenografts using (177)Lu-labeled 11B6 in either murine or humanized forms for radionuclide therapy. In this setting, CLI was investigated as a tool for providing parameters of dosimetric importance during radionuclide therapy. First, longitudinal imaging of biokinetics using CLI and SPECT was compared. Second, the CLI signal was correlated to quantitative ex vivo tumor activity measurements. Finally, CLI was used to monitor the radionuclide treatment, and the integrated CLI radiance was found to correlate well with subject-specific tumor volume reduction.  Methods:   11B6 was radiolabeled with (177)Lu through the CHX-A″-DTPA chelator. In vivo CLI and SPECT imaging of (177)Lu-DTPA-11B6 uptake was performed on NMRI and BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous LNCaP xenografts up to 14 d after injection. Tumor size was measured to assess response to radionuclide therapy.  Results:   CLI correlated well with SPECT imaging and could be applied up to 14 d after injection of 20 MBq with the specific tracer used. Through integration of the CLI radiance as a function of time, a dose metric for the tumors could be formed that correlated exponentially with tumor volume reduction.

Method:   Seventy-two subjects participated in this study after receiving appropriate education. Forty-two patients self-administered inhaled Penthrox (3 mL methoxyflurane) alone for analgesia (Group A), followed by 30 patients who self-administered Penthrox and received PILA with 5 mL of 2% lignocaine.

In classical ERE-luc reporter assay BP behaved as a potent ER-α antagonist and ER-β agonist. Accordingly, it decreased expression of ER-α target PS2 (P<0.01) and increased expression of ER-β target TNF-α (P<0.05) genes in PC-3. ER-β deficient PC-3 (siRNA-transfected) was resistant to apoptotic and anti-proliferative actions of SERMs, including stimulation of FasL expression by BP.

We investigated whether natural products green tea (GT) and quercetin (Q), a flavonoid from apples and onions, will enhance the efficacy of Doc in androgen-independent (AI) prostate cancer cells. Two cell lines including LAPC-4-AI and PC-3 were treated in vitro with 40 μM of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), 5 μM of Q, 2 or 5 nM of Doc alone or in combination. The mixture of EGCG+Q+Doc increased the antiproliferative effect by threefold in LAPC-4-AI cells and eightfold in PC-3 cells compared to Doc alone. EGCG, Q and Doc in combination significantly enhanced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and increased apoptosis in both LAPC-4-AI and PC-3 cells compared to Doc alone. The mixture increased the inhibition of PI3K/Akt and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3 signaling pathways compared to Doc alone, and decreased the protein expression of multidrug resistance-related protein. In addition, the combination with EGCG and Q increased the inhibition of tumor cell invasion and colony formation in both LAPC-4-AI and PC-3 cells compared to Doc alone, and decreased the percentage of CD44(+)/CD24(-) stem-like LAPC-4-AI cells.

Patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) in a large multicentre retrospective study for upper tract transitional cell carcinoma (UT-TCC) between January 2002 and December 2013 were identified from our hospitals databases. PNU appearances, stage, and grade of ureteroscopic biopsy were compared with final histology results of RNU to assess the diagnostic reliability of PNU for carcinoma in situ (CIS). Results. Three hundred patients underwent RNU for UT-TCC. 106 (106/300; 35.3%) of the cohort had PNU using white light with biopsies taken in most (92/106; 86.7%). Postnephroureterectomy histology of the cohort showed CIS in 65 (65/300; 21.6%) patients. Thirty nine of patients with CIS (39/65; 60%) had prenephroureterectomy ureteroscopy biopsies. Out of ten patients with CIS on ureteroscopic biopsies, six did not show CIS on final histopathology (6/10; 60%). Moreover, grading and staging on PNU biopsies of obvious tumours showed a significant nonconcordance with final histopathology of RNU specimen (P = 0.02). Overall survival was also shorter in patients with CIS compared with those without; this showed strong statistical significance (P = 0.004). Conclusions. There is a high incidence of CIS in upper tract with significant underdetection and discordance rate between the histopathology of biopsy samples obtained by white light PNU and resected specimen of radical nephroureterectomy.

In prostate cancer, ETS family members, such as ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5, are frequently overexpressed due to chromosomal translocations, but the molecular mechanisms by which they promote prostate tumorigenesis remain largely undefined. Here, we show that ETS family members, such as ERG and ETV1, directly repress the expression of the checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), a key DNA damage response cell-cycle regulator essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. Critically, we find that ERG expression correlates with CHK1 downregulation in human patients and demonstrate that Chk1 heterozygosity promotes the progression of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia into prostatic invasive carcinoma in Pten(+) (/-) mice. Importantly, CHK1 downregulation sensitizes prostate tumor cells to etoposide but not to docetaxel treatment. Thus, we identify CHK1 as a key functional target of the ETS proto-oncogenic family with important therapeutic implications.  Significance:   Genetic translocation and aberrant expression of ETS family members is a common event in different types of human tumors.

From the clinical editor:   The ability of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to enhance the effect of physical radiation dose on tumor cells is known. This radiosensitization effect is thought to result from an increased number of photoelectric absorption events and the increased number of electrons present in gold. The authors here sought to further increase the amount and specificity of gold accumulation in prostatic cancer cells by conjugating gold nanorods to goserelin, a synthetic luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue that would bind to the LHRH receptor overexpressed in prostate cancers.

This retrospective study consisted of 1016 patients with PCa who received radical prostatectomy. The association between MetS and pathological features was evaluated using logistic regression analysis.

Some factors that could cause a discrepancy in results between these two procedures were also evaluated. Among the 318 cases reviewed, 191 cases were selected for inclusion in this comparative study. We divided the patients into two groups using the Gleason score: an intermediate/high-grade group (≥7) and a low-grade group (<6). Exploratory analyses were conducted for comparisons between groups. We also performed comparisons between TRUSBX and RP for tumor laterality. TRUSBX overestimated 6% and underestimated 24% cases in comparison with RP for Gleason score, and overestimated 2.6% and underestimated 46% cases compared with RP for tumor laterality. Biopsy specimens were slightly smaller in TRUSBX cases with underestimated tumor laterality (P < 0.05), and no relationship between the biopsy specimen size and underestimated Gleason score in TRUSBX was found. Prostatic volume showed no statistical correlation with the likelihood of under or overestimation (P > 0.05). Thus, our study showed that TRUSBX has a high likelihood of underestimating both the Gleason score and tumor laterality in prostate cancer (PCa). The size of the fragment appears to be an important factor influencing the likelihood of laterality underestimation and Gleason score overestimation via TRUSBX. Due to the high likelihood of underestimation of the Gleason score and tumor laterality by 12-core prostate biopsy, we conclude that this type of biopsy should not be used alone to guide therapy in PCa.""","""['Renan A Pereira', 'Roberto S Costa', 'Valdair F Muglia', 'Fábio Franca Silva', 'Joyce S Lajes', 'Rodolfo B Dos Reis', 'Gyl Eb Silva']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Cribriform morphology predicts upstaging after radical prostatectomy in patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer at transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided needle biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transectal ultrasound image-fusion biopsies accurately characterize the index tumor: correlation with step-sectioned radical prostatectomy specimens in 135 patients.', 'Transperineal versus transrectal prostate biopsy for predicting the final laterality of prostate cancer: are they reliable enough to select patients for focal therapy?

Materials and methods:   Between 2009 and 2013, 57 patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after RP who were considered for salvage radiation therapy (SRT) were included. 3TmMRI with T2-weighted imaging, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging without endorectal coil was carried out in all patients before treatment.  Results:   In 14 out of 57 patients (24.56%) local recurrence was detected through 3TmMRI. Median pre-SRT PSA was 0.40 ng/ml (interquartile range 0.30-2.05 ng/ml). The recurrence was perianastomotic in eight out of 14 patients (57.14%) and retrovesical in six out of 14 patients (42.86%). The median size of the local recurrence was 15.2 mm (range 8.0-46.0 mm).

SPORT promises to deliver remarkable radiation dose distributions in an efficient manner, yet there exists no optimization algorithm for its implementation. The purpose of this work is to develop an algorithm to simultaneously optimize the beam sampling and aperture shapes.  Methods:   The authors build a mathematical model with the fundamental station point parameters as the decision variables. To solve the resulting large-scale optimization problem, the authors devise an effective algorithm by integrating three advanced optimization techniques: column generation, subgradient method, and pattern search. Column generation adds the most beneficial stations sequentially until the plan quality improvement saturates and provides a good starting point for the subsequent optimization. It also adds the new stations during the algorithm if beneficial. For each update resulted from column generation, the subgradient method improves the selected stations locally by reshaping the apertures and updating the beam angles toward a descent subgradient direction. The algorithm continues to improve the selected stations locally and globally by a pattern search algorithm to explore the part of search space not reachable by the subgradient method. By combining these three techniques together, all plausible combinations of station parameters are searched efficiently to yield the optimal solution.  Results:   A SPORT optimization framework with seamlessly integration of three complementary algorithms, column generation, subgradient method, and pattern search, was established. The proposed technique was applied to two previously treated clinical cases: a head and neck and a prostate case. It significantly improved the target conformality and at the same time critical structure sparing compared with conventional intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). In the head and neck case, for example, the average PTV coverage D99% for two PTVs, cord and brainstem max doses, and right parotid gland mean dose were improved, respectively, by about 7%, 37%, 12%, and 16%.  Conclusions:   The proposed method automatically determines the number of the stations required to generate a satisfactory plan and optimizes simultaneously the involved station parameters, leading to improved quality of the resultant treatment plans as compared with the conventional IMRT plans.""","""['Masoud Zarepisheh', 'Ruijiang Li', 'Yinyu Ye', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Beam’s-eye-view dosimetrics (BEVD) guided rotational station parameter optimized radiation therapy (SPORT) planning based on reweighted total-variation minimization.', 'Ultrafast treatment plan optimization for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).', 'Extragradient subgradient methods for solving bilevel equilibrium problems.', 'Distributed and scalable optimization for robust proton treatment planning.', 'Solving the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) problem using a sequential convex programming method.', 'Automated intensity modulated treatment planning: The expedited constrained hierarchical optimization (ECHO) system.', 'Lung IMRT planning with automatic determination of beam angle configurations.', 'Development of an autonomous treatment planning strategy for radiation therapy with effective use of population-based prior data.']"""

Methods:   An inverse planning algorithm for UIMAT was prototyped within the pinnacle treatment planning system (Philips Healthcare). The IMRT and VMAT deliveries are unified within the same arc, with IMRT being delivered at specific gantry angles within the arc. Optimized gantry angles for the IMRT and VMAT phases are assigned automatically by the inverse optimization algorithm. Optimization of the IMRT and VMAT phases is done simultaneously using a direct aperture optimization algorithm. Five treatment plans each for prostate, head and neck, and lung were generated using a unified optimization technique and compared with clinical IMRT or VMAT plans. Delivery verification was performed with an ArcCheck phantom (Sun Nuclear) on a Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems).  Results:   In this prototype implementation, the UIMAT plans offered the same target dose coverage while reducing mean doses to organs at risk by 8.4% for head-and-neck cases, 5.7% for lung cases, and 3.5% for prostate cases, compared with the VMAT or IMRT plans. In addition, UIMAT can be delivered with similar efficiency as VMAT.  Conclusions:   In this proof-of-concept work, a novel radiation therapy optimization and delivery technique that interlaces VMAT or IMRT delivery within the same arc has been demonstrated.

However, this treatment eventually fails as the tumor develops resistance. Although reduced expression of ER-α is a known contributing factor to endocrine resistance, the mechanism of ER-α downregulation in endocrine resistance is still not fully understood. The present study shows that Slug has an inverse relationship with ERα in breast and prostate cancer patient samples. Also the inhibition of Slug blocks mammary stem cell activity in primary mammary epithelial cells. We hypothesize that Slug may be a key transcription factor in the regulation of ERα expression. To understand the Slug-ERα signaling pathway, we employed resistant cell line MCF-TAMR (ERα relatively negative) derived from its parental MCF-7 (ERα positive) cell line and assessed changes in cell phenotype, activity and response to therapy. Conversely, we performed knockdown of Slug in the high-Slug expressing cell line MDA-MB-231 and assessed reversal of the mesenchymal phenotype. Microarray analysis showed that Slug is overexpressed in high grade breast and prostate cancer tissues. Additionally, Slug overexpression leads to drug resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Slug binds directly to ERα promoter E-boxes and represses ERα expression. This resulted in decrease in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells. These findings demonstrate that Slug, by regulation of ERα expression, contributes to tumor progression and could serve as an important target for cancer therapy.""","""['Youqiang Li', 'Yanyuan Wu', 'Thomas C Abbatiello', 'Warren L Wu', 'Ju Ri Kim', 'Marianna Sarkissyan', 'Suren Sarkissyan', 'Seyung S Chung', 'Yahya Elshimali', 'Jaydutt V Vadgama']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['ERalpha signaling through slug regulates E-cadherin and EMT.', 'AKT3 regulates ErbB2, ErbB3 and estrogen receptor α expression and contributes to endocrine therapy resistance of ErbB2(+) breast tumor cells from Balb-neuT mice.', 'MiR-301a-3p Suppresses Estrogen Signaling by Directly Inhibiting ESR1 in ERα Positive Breast Cancer.', 'Decoding the Therapeutic Implications of the ERα Stability and Subcellular Distribution in Breast Cancer.', 'Transgenic mouse models of hormonal mammary carcinogenesis: advantages and limitations.', 'Kalkitoxin: A Potent Suppressor of Distant Breast Cancer Metastasis.', 'Proposing Specific Neuronal Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Genes as an Ancillary Tool for Differential Diagnosis among Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.', 'Cancer Stem Cells-The Insight into Non-Coding RNAs.', 'The E3 Ligase TRIM4 Facilitates SET Ubiquitin-Mediated Degradation to Enhance ER-α Action in Breast Cancer.', 'A mechanistic model captures the emergence and implications of non-genetic heterogeneity and reversible drug resistance in ER+ breast cancer cells.']"""

They have been detected in a wide variety of human cells and tissues, but few studies have focused on their existence in human serum. Among the four types identified to date, we previously demonstrated that plasma membrane-associated ganglioside sialidase (NEU3) is markedly upregulated in various human cancers, including examples in the colon and prostate. Here, using a sensitive assay method, we found a significant increase of sialidase activity in the serum of patients with prostate cancer compared with that in healthy subjects having low activity, if any. Activity was apparent with gangliosides as substrates, but only to a very limited extent with 4-methylumbelliferyl sialic acid, a good synthetic substrate for sialidases other than human NEU3. The serum sialidase was also almost entirely immunoprecipitated with anti-NEU3 antibody, but not with antibodies for other sialidases. Interestingly, sera additionally contained inhibitory activity against the sialidase and also against recombinant human NEU3. The sialidase and inhibitor activities could be separated by exosome isolation and by hydrophobic column chromatography. The serum sialidase was assessed by a sandwich ELISA method using two anti-NEU3 antibodies.

The early diagnosis relies on prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum test, even if it showed clear limits. Among the new tests currently under study, one of the most promising is the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3), a non-coding mRNA whose level increases up to 100 times in PCa tissues when compared to normal tissues. With the present study we contribute to the validation of the clinical utility of the PCA3 test and to the evaluation of its prognostic potential.  Methods:   407 Italian men, with two or more PCa risk factors and at least a previous negative biopsy, entering the Urology Unit of Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, were tested for PCA3, total PSA (tPSA) and free PSA (fPSA and f/tPSA) tests. Out of the 407 men enrolled, 195 were positive for PCa and 114 of them received an accurate staging with evaluation of the Gleason score (Gs). Then, the PCA3 score was correlated to biopsy outcome, and the diagnostic and prognostic utility were evaluated.  Results:   Out of the 407 biopsies performed after the PCA3 test, 195 (48%) resulted positive for PCa; the PCA3 score was significantly higher in this population (p < 0.0001) differently to tPSA (p = 0.87). Moreover, the PCA3 test outperformed the f/tPSA (p = 0.01). The sensitivity (94.9) and specificity (60.1) of the PCA3 test showed a better balance for a threshold of 35 when compared to 20, even if the best result was achieved considering a cutoff of 51, with sensitivity and specificity of 82.1% and 79.3%, respectively. Finally, comparing values of the PCA3 test between two subgroups with increasing Gs (Gs ≤ 6 versus Gs ≥ 7) a significant association between PCA3 score and Gs was found (p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   The PCA3 test showed the best diagnostic performance when compared to tPSA and f/tPSA, facilitating the selection of high-risk patients that may benefit from the execution of a saturation prostatic biopsy. Moreover, the PCA3 test showed a prognostic value, as higher PCA3 score values are associated to a greater tumor aggressiveness.""","""['Roberta Merola', 'Luigi Tomao', 'Anna Antenucci', 'Isabella Sperduti', 'Steno Sentinelli', 'Serena Masi', 'Chiara Mandoj', 'Giulia Orlandi', 'Rocco Papalia', 'Salvatore Guaglianone', 'Manuela Costantini', 'Giuseppe Cusumano', 'Giovanni Cigliana', 'Paolo Ascenzi', 'Michele Gallucci', 'Laura Conti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['A comparative performance analysis of total prostate-specific antigen, percentage free prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific antigen velocity and urinary prostate cancer gene 3 in the first, second and third repeat prostate biopsy.', 'Prostate health index (phi) and prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) significantly improve diagnostic accuracy in patients undergoing prostate biopsy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 as a Tumour Marker: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in bone metastasis: progresses and perspectives as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.', 'HOTAIR as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of gastrointestinal cancers: an updated meta-analysis and bioinformatics analysis based on TCGA data.', 'A novel platform using homobifunctional hydrazide for enrichment and isolation of urinary circulating RNAs.', 'Spatial transcriptome analysis of long non-coding RNAs reveals tissue specificity and functional roles in cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: protocol for updating multiple systematic reviews to inform a Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care guideline update.']"""

The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Over the years, the burden has shifted to less developed countries, which currently account for about 57% of cases and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in both more and less developed countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more developed countries; breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among females in less developed countries. Other leading causes of cancer death in more developed countries include colorectal cancer among males and females and prostate cancer among males. In less developed countries, liver and stomach cancer among males and cervical cancer among females are also leading causes of cancer death. Although incidence rates for all cancers combined are nearly twice as high in more developed than in less developed countries in both males and females, mortality rates are only 8% to 15% higher in more developed countries.

Methods:   We studied the effect of PI3K therapy in patient-derived tumor organotypic cultures (from five patient samples), three glioblastoma (GBM) tumor cell lines, and an intracranial model of glioblastoma in immunocompromised mice (n = 4-5 mice per group). Mechanisms of therapy-induced tumor reprogramming were investigated in a global metabolomics screening, analysis of mitochondrial bioenergetics and cell death, and modulation of protein phosphorylation. A high-throughput drug screening was used to identify novel preclinical combination therapies with PI3K inhibitors, and combination synergy experiments were performed. All statistical methods were two-sided.  Results:   PI3K therapy induces global metabolic reprogramming in tumors and promotes the recruitment of an active pool of the Ser/Thr kinase, Akt2 to mitochondria. In turn, mitochondrial Akt2 phosphorylates Ser31 in cyclophilin D (CypD), a regulator of organelle functions. Akt2-phosphorylated CypD supports mitochondrial bioenergetics and opposes tumor cell death, conferring resistance to PI3K therapy. The combination of a small-molecule antagonist of CypD protein folding currently in preclinical development, Gamitrinib, plus PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) reverses this adaptive response, produces synergistic anticancer activity by inducing mitochondrial apoptosis, and extends animal survival in a GBM model (vehicle: median survival = 28.5 days; Gamitrinib+PI3Ki: median survival = 40 days, P = .003), compared with single-agent treatment (PI3Ki: median survival = 32 days, P = .02; Gamitrinib: median survival = 35 days, P = .008 by two-sided unpaired t test).

This lncRNA promotes the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells and its levels decline as prostate cancer cells acquire castrate-resistance, so that enhancing GAS5 expression may improve the effectiveness of chemotherapies. Since GAS5 is a member of the 5' terminal oligopyrimidine gene family, we have examined mTOR inhibition as a strategy to increase GAS5 expression. Furthermore, we have determined if GAS5 itself mediates the action of mTOR inhibitors, as demonstrated for other chemotherapeutic agents in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The effects of mTOR inhibitors on GAS5 lncRNA levels and cell growth were determined in a range of prostate cancer cell lines. Transfection of cells with GAS5 siRNAs and plasmid constructs was performed to determine the involvement of GAS5 lncRNA in mTOR inhibitor action.  Results:   First generation mTORC1, combined mTORC1/mTORC2 and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors all increased cellular GAS5 levels and inhibited culture growth in androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-sensitive (22Rv1) cell lines, but not in androgen-independent (PC-3 and DU 145) cell lines. The latter exhibited low endogenous GAS5 expression, and GAS5 silencing in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells decreased the sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, whereas transfection of GAS5 lncRNA sensitized PC-3 and DU 145 cells to these agents.  Conclusion:   mTOR inhibition enhances GAS5 transcript levels in certain prostate cancer cell lines. This selectivity is likely to be related to endogenous GAS5 expression levels, since GAS5 lncRNA is itself required for mTOR inhibitor action in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Kiren Yacqub-Usman', 'Mark R Pickard', 'Gwyn T Williams']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Regulation of apoptosis by long non-coding RNA GAS5 in breast cancer cells: implications for chemotherapy.', 'Upregulation of Long Noncoding RNA_GAS5 Suppresses Cell Proliferation and Metastasis in Laryngeal Cancer via Regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway.', 'Long non-coding RNA GAS5 regulates apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Retard or exacerbate: Role of long non-coding RNA growth arrest-specific 5 in the fibrosis.', 'Research Progress of Long Non-Coding RNA GAS5 in Malignant Tumors.', 'GAS5-inhibited hepatocyte pyroptosis contributes to hepatic stellate cell inactivation via microRNA-684 and AHR.', 'The Biological Role and Translational Implications of the Long Non-Coding RNA GAS5 in Breast Cancer.', 'Small molecule targeting long noncoding RNA GAS5 administered intranasally improves neuronal insulin signaling and decreases neuroinflammation in an aged mouse model.', 'Differentiation of Human Wharton Jelly Mesenchymal Stem Cells into Germ-Like Cells; emphasis on evaluation of Germ-long non-coding RNAs.', 'Metformin reverses tamoxifen resistance through the lncRNA GAS5-medicated mTOR pathway in breast cancer.']"""

The tumorigenic properties of these treatments were evaluated by proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration assays using different PCa cell lines, in order to assess how these treatments act at molecular level. The results showed that a combination of statins and aspirin enhances the effect of individual treatments and seems to reduce the risk of PCa detection (OR: 0.616 (95% CI: 0.467-0.812), P<0.001).

However, acquired resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone therapies frequently develops within a short period in many patients. In the present study, we developed enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells in an effort to understand the mechanisms of resistance. Global gene-expression analysis showed that the steroid biosynthesis pathway is activated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. One of the crucial steroidogenic enzymes, AKR1C3, was significantly elevated in enzalutamide-resistant cells. In addition, AKR1C3 is highly expressed in metastatic and recurrent prostate cancer and in enzalutamide-resistant prostate xenograft tumors. LC/MS analysis of the steroid metabolites revealed that androgen precursors such as cholesterol, DHEA and progesterone, as well as androgens are highly upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells compared to the parental cells. Knockdown of AKR1C3 expression by shRNA or inhibition of AKR1C3 enzymatic activity by indomethacin resensitized enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide treatment both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, overexpression of AKR1C3 confers resistance to enzalutamide. Furthermore, the combination of indomethacin and enzalutamide resulted in significant inhibition of enzalutamide-resistant tumor growth. These results suggest that AKR1C3 activation is a critical resistance mechanism associated with enzalutamide resistance; targeting intracrine androgens and AKR1C3 will overcome enzalutamide resistance and improve survival of advanced prostate cancer patients.""","""['Chengfei Liu', 'Wei Lou', 'Yezi Zhu', 'Joy C Yang', 'Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Nilesh W Gaikwad', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: Breaking AKR1C3-mediated enzalutamide resistance by inhibiting androgen synthesis.', 'Inhibition of AKR1C3 Activation Overcomes Resistance to Abiraterone in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'AKR1C3 Inhibitor KV-37 Exhibits Antineoplastic Effects and Potentiates Enzalutamide in Combination Therapy in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Cells.', 'Overexpression of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) in LNCaP cells diverts androgen metabolism towards testosterone resulting in resistance to the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride.', 'The DHEA-sulfate depot following P450c17 inhibition supports the case for AKR1C3 inhibition in high risk localized and advanced castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Androgen receptor blockade resistance with enzalutamide in prostate cancer results in immunosuppressive alterations in the tumor immune microenvironment.', 'Acetyl-CoA biosynthesis drives resistance to histone acetyltransferase inhibition.', 'Establishing a Proteomics-Based Signature of AKR1C3-Related Genes for Predicting the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrative analysis of ferroptosis regulators for clinical prognosis based on deep learning and potential chemotherapy sensitivity of prostate cancer.']"""

Intrinsic apoptosis, regulated by the BCL2 family, integrates diverse apoptotic signals to determine cell death commitment and then activates the nodal effector protein BAK to initiate the apoptotic cascade. In this study, we identified the tyrosine kinase BMX as a direct negative regulator of BAK function. BMX associates with BAK in viable cells and is the first kinase to phosphorylate the key tyrosine residue needed to maintain BAK in an inactive conformation. Importantly, elevated BMX expression prevents BAK activation in tumor cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents and is associated with increased resistance to apoptosis and decreased patient survival. Accordingly, BMX expression was elevated in prostate, breast, and colon cancers compared with normal tissue, including in aggressive triple-negative breast cancers where BMX overexpression may be a novel biomarker. Furthermore, BMX silencing potentiated BAK activation, rendering tumor cells hypersensitive to otherwise sublethal doses of clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents.

The authors projected to 2020 nationwide age-standardized incidence rates and cases (including the top 23 cancers).  Results:   Since 1975, incident cases increased among white individuals, primarily caused by an aging white population, and among black individuals, primarily caused by an increasing black population. Between 2010 and 2020, it is expected that overall incidence rates (proxy for risk) will decrease slightly among black men and stabilize in other groups.

Methods and materials:   Computed tomography images and radiation therapy treatment plans from 20 patients with prostate cancer were reviewed retrospectively. Patient anatomy was segmented into fat, nonfat soft tissue, and bone. Population average tissue densities within the irradiated volume were obtained.

Materials and methods:   The study retrospectively evaluated 48 patients who had FCH PET/CT for the initial staging of PCa. At the same time, 32 of the 48 patients had a bone scan and 26 of the 48 patients had abdominal-pelvic diagnostic CT. Diagnostic performance of FCH PET/CT, i.e. sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, was evaluated on a per-patient basis for the whole population and then separately on a per-risk classification, and later in comparison with conventional imaging. Histological specimens or follow-up data were used as the standard of reference.  Results:   The overall accuracy of FCH PET/CT for lymph-node involvement was 83.3%. The sensitivity of FCH was higher in the high-risk subset (83.3%) than in the intermediate-risk group (33.3%), whereas FCH specificity was similar. In comparison with dedicated CT scan, FCH PET/CT showed a higher sensitivity and a similar specificity (46.2% vs 69.2% and 92.3% vs 92.3%, respectively). Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT were higher than those of bone scan (100% vs 90% and 86.4% vs 77.2%, respectively). In contrast with conventional imaging, PET/CT changed the staging of the PCa in 33.3% patients.  Conclusions:   The efficiency of FCH PET/CT in detecting both bone and lymph-node involvement of PCa at initial staging was found to be higher than that of conventional imaging.

Experimental design:   We assessed PTEN status in two large adjuvant breast cancer trials (BCIRG-006 and BCIRG-005) using a PTEN immunohistochemical (IHC) assay that was previously validated in a panel of 33 breast cancer cell lines and prostate cancer tissues with known PTEN gene deletion.  Results:   In the HER2-positive patient population, absence of tumor cell PTEN staining occurred at a rate of 5.4% and was independent of ER/PR status. In contrast, 15.9% of HER2-negative patients exhibited absence of PTEN staining with the highest frequency seen in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subgroup versus ER/PR-positive patients (35.1% vs. 10.9%). Complete absence of PTEN staining in tumor cells was associated with poor clinical outcome in HER2-positive disease. Those patients whose cancers demonstrated absent PTEN staining had a significant decrease in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with patients with tumors exhibiting any PTEN staining patterns (low, moderate, or high). Trastuzumab appeared to provide clinical benefit even for patients lacking PTEN staining. In the HER2-negative population, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcome based on PTEN status.  Conclusions:   This study is the largest to date examining PTEN status in breast cancer and the data suggest that the rate and significance of PTEN status differ between HER2-positive and HER2-negative disease.

We evaluated humoral antigen spread after treatment with sipuleucel-T, an immunotherapy for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), designed to target prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP; primary antigen).  Experimental design:   Serum samples from patients with mCRPC enrolled in the placebo-controlled phase III IMPACT study (evaluable n = 142) were used to assess humoral antigen spread after treatment with sipuleucel-T. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to self-antigens (including tumor antigens) were surveyed using protein microarrays and confirmed using Luminex xMAP. IgG responses were subsequently validated in ProACT (n = 33), an independent phase II study of sipuleucel-T. Association of IgG responses with overall survival (OS) was assessed using multivariate Cox models adjusted for baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and lactate dehydrogenase levels.  Results:   In patients from IMPACT and ProACT, levels of IgG against multiple secondary antigens, including PSA, KLK2/hK2, K-Ras, E-Ras, LGALS8/PCTA-1/galectin-8, and LGALS3/galectin-3, were elevated after treatment with sipuleucel-T (P < 0.01), but not control. IgG responses (≥ 2-fold elevation posttreatment) occurred in ≥ 25% of patients, appeared by 2 weeks after sipuleucel-T treatment, and persisted for up to 6 months. IgG responses to PSA and LGALS3 were associated with improved OS in sipuleucel-T-treated patients from IMPACT (P ≤ 0.05).  Conclusions:   Sipuleucel-T induced humoral antigen spread in patients with mCRPC. IgG responses were associated with improved OS in IMPACT.

To understand whether ambient oxygen plays a role in human carcinogenesis, we characterized age-adjusted cancer incidence (compiled by the National Cancer Institute from 2005 to 2009) across counties of the elevation-varying Western United States and compared trends displayed by respiratory cancer (lung) and non-respiratory cancers (breast, colorectal, and prostate). To adjust for important demographic and cancer-risk factors, 8-12 covariates were considered for each cancer. We produced regression models that captured known risks. Models demonstrated that elevation is strongly, negatively associated with lung cancer incidence (p < 10(-16)), but not with the incidence of non-respiratory cancers. For every 1,000 m rise in elevation, lung cancer incidence decreased by 7.23 99% CI [5.18-9.29] cases per 100,000 individuals, equivalent to 12.7% of the mean incidence, 56.8. As a predictor of lung cancer incidence, elevation was second only to smoking prevalence in terms of significance and effect size. Furthermore, no evidence of ecological fallacy or of confounding arising from evaluated factors was detected: the lung cancer association was robust to varying regression models, county stratification, and population subgrouping; additionally seven environmental correlates of elevation, such as exposure to sunlight and fine particulate matter, could not capture the association. Overall, our findings suggest the presence of an inhaled carcinogen inherently and inversely tied to elevation, offering epidemiological support for oxygen-driven tumorigenesis. Finally, highlighting the need to consider elevation in studies of lung cancer, we demonstrated that previously reported inverse lung cancer associations with radon and UVB became insignificant after accounting for elevation.""","""['Kamen P Simeonov#', 'Daniel S Himmelstein#']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PeerJ""","""['Effects of long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution on respiratory and cardiovascular mortality in the Netherlands: the NLCS-AIR study.', ""Epidemiological associations among lung cancer, radon exposure and elevation above sea level--a reassessment of Cohen's county level radon study."", 'Effects of short-term exposure to air pollution on hospital admissions of young children for acute lower respiratory infections in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Longitudinal relationships between lung cancer mortality rates, smoking, and ambient air quality: a comprehensive review and analysis.', 'Manuscript title: Geospatial analysis of Cancer risk and residential proximity to coal mines in Illinois.', 'Morphological and molecular-biological features of glioblastoma progression in tolerant and susceptible to hypoxia Wistar rats.', 'The underexplored links between cancer and the internal body climate: Implications for cancer prevention and treatment.', 'Revisiting the COVID-19 fatality rate and altitude association through a comprehensive analysis.', 'Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for exploring spatial variability of lung and bronchus cancer (LBC) mortality rates in the contiguous USA.', 'The Oxygen Transport Triad in High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema: A Perspective from the High Andes.']"""

Here, we studied the epigenetic alteration of DLEC1 and its functions in prostate cancer. We found that DLEC1 was highly expressed in normal prostate tissues, normal prostatic epithelium cell line (RWPE-1), and benign prostatic hyperplasia cell line (BPH-1), but frequently downregulated by promoter methylation in PrCa cell lines. Pharmacologic demethylation could restore DLEC1 expression. DLEC1 was downregulated in prostate tumor tissues compared with their adjacent non-malignant tissues. DLEC1 was methylated in 76/110 primary tumors, but rarely in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. DLEC1 methylation was associated with higher PSA levels (p = 0.016), higher Gleason scores (p = 0.015), and more advanced tumor stages (p = 0.003). Furthermore, DLEC1 methylation was detected in 11/30 urine sediment samples from PrCa patients, but seldom in ones from BPH patients. Ectopic expression of DLEC1 inhibited the colony formation of PrCa cells, through inducing cell apoptosis. DLEC1 also suppressed PrCa cell migration. Moreover, DLEC1 inhibited NF-κB transcription activity in PrCa and HEK293 cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that DLEC1 functions as a tumor suppressor but is frequently methylated in prostate cancer. DLEC1 methylation is associated with prostate cancer progression, which could be a non-invasive epigenetic biomarker for PrCa diagnosis.  Key messages:   • Promoter methylation of DLEC1 is a potential prognostic biomarker for PrCa. • DLEC1, a functional tumor suppressor, is frequently methylated in PrCa. • DLEC1 suppresses prostate cancer growth and metastatic behavior. • DLEC1 mediates tumor-suppressive activities through NF-κB signaling.""","""['Lian Zhang', 'Qian Zhang', 'LiLi Li', 'Zhaohui Wang', 'Jianming Ying', 'Yu Fan', 'Qun He', 'Tianjing Lv', 'Wenke Han', 'Jun Li', 'Yang Yang', 'Ben Xu', 'Lu Wang', 'Qianling Liu', 'Yinghao Sun', 'Yinglu Guo', 'Qian Tao', 'Jie Jin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Mol Med (Berl)""","""['Epigenomic characterization of a p53-regulated 3p22.2 tumor suppressor that inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation via protein docking and is frequently methylated in esophageal and other carcinomas.', 'Frequent epigenetic inactivation of deleted in lung and esophageal cancer 1 gene by promoter methylation in non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Candidate tumor-suppressor gene DLEC1 is frequently downregulated by promoter hypermethylation and histone hypoacetylation in human epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'The association of retinoic acid receptor beta2(RARβ2) methylation status and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', 'AKR1B10 expression in benign prostatic hyperplasia and its related mechanism.', 'Novel mutations in breast cancer patients from southwestern Colombia.', 'PM2.5 exposure and DLEC1 promoter methylation in Taiwan Biobank participants.', 'Dlec1 is required for spermatogenesis and male fertility in mice.', 'Relationship between DLEC1 and PBX3 promoter methylation and the risk and prognosis of gastric cancer in peripheral blood leukocytes.']"""

GHRH is also produced by cancers, acting as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor. This growth factor function is seen in lymphoma, melanoma, colorectal, liver, lung, breast, prostate, kidney, bladder cancers. Pituitary type GHRH receptors and their splice variants are also expressed in these malignancies. Synthetic antagonists of the GHRH receptor inhibit proliferation of cancers. Besides direct inhibitory effects on tumors, GHRH antagonists also enhance cytotoxic chemotherapy. GHRH antagonists potentiate docetaxel effects on growth of H460 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and MX-1 breast cancer plus suppressive action of doxorubicin on MX-1 and HCC1806 breast cancer. We investigated mechanisms of antagonists on tumor growth, inflammatory signaling, doxorubicin response, expression of drug resistance genes, and efflux pump function. Triple negative breast cancer cell xenografted into nude mice were treated with GHRH antagonist, doxorubicin, or their combination. The combination reduced tumor growth, inflammatory gene expression, drug-resistance gene expression, cancer stem-cell marker expression, and efflux-pump function. Thus, antagonists increased the efficacy of doxorubicin in HCC1806 and MX-1 tumors. Growth inhibition of H460 NSCLC by GHRH antagonists induced marked downregulation in expression of prosurvival proteins K-Ras, COX-2, and pAKT. In HT-29, HCT-116 and HCT-15 colorectal cancer lines, GHRH antagonist treatment caused cellular arrest in S-phase of cell cycle, potentiated inhibition of in vitro proliferation and in vivo growth produced by S-phase specific cytotoxic agents, 5-FU, irinotecan and cisplatin.

The underlying regulators of the tumor metabolic program are not completely understood; however, these factors have potential as cancer therapy targets. Here, we determined that upregulation of the oncogenic transcriptional coregulator steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2), also known as NCOA2, drives glutamine-dependent de novo lipogenesis, which supports tumor cell survival and eventual metastasis. SRC-2 was highly elevated in a variety of tumors, especially in prostate cancer, in which SRC-2 was amplified and overexpressed in 37% of the metastatic tumors evaluated. In prostate cancer cells, SRC-2 stimulated reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate to generate citrate via retrograde TCA cycling, promoting lipogenesis and reprogramming of glutamine metabolism. Glutamine-mediated nutrient signaling activated SRC-2 via mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation, which then triggered downstream transcriptional responses by coactivating SREBP-1, which subsequently enhanced lipogenic enzyme expression. Metabolic profiling of human prostate tumors identified a massive increase in the SRC-2-driven metabolic signature in metastatic tumors compared with that seen in localized tumors, further implicating SRC-2 as a prominent metabolic coordinator of cancer metastasis. Moreover, SRC-2 inhibition in murine models severely attenuated the survival, growth, and metastasis of prostate cancer. Together, these results suggest that the SRC-2 pathway has potential as a therapeutic target for prostate cancer.""","""['Subhamoy Dasgupta', 'Nagireddy Putluri', 'Weiwen Long', 'Bin Zhang', 'Jianghua Wang', 'Akash K Kaushik', 'James M Arnold', 'Salil K Bhowmik', 'Erin Stashi', 'Christine A Brennan', 'Kimal Rajapakshe', 'Cristian Coarfa', 'Nicholas Mitsiades', 'Michael M Ittmann', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Arun Sreekumar', ""Bert W O'Malley""]""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Transcriptional Repression of SIRT3 Potentiates Mitochondrial Aconitase Activation to Drive Aggressive Prostate Cancer to the Bone.', 'Metabolic enzyme PFKFB4 activates transcriptional coactivator SRC-3 to drive breast cancer.', 'SRC-2-mediated coactivation of anti-tumorigenic target genes suppresses MYC-induced liver cancer.', 'Androgens and increased lipogenesis in prostate cancer.

Objective:   The purpose of this study was to analyze the involvement of circumferential resection margin in local recurrence and survival in a multidisciplinary population-based setting by using tailored oncological therapy and surgery with total mesorectal excision.  Design:   Data were collected in a prospective database and retrospectively analyzed. Between 1996 and 2009, 448 patients with rectal cancer underwent a curative bowel resection.  Settings:   Population-based data were collected at a single institution in the county of Västmanland, Sweden.  Results:   Preoperative radiotherapy was delivered to 334 patients (74%); it was delivered to 35 patients (8%) concomitantly with preoperative chemotherapy. In 70 patients (16%), en bloc resections of the prostate and vagina were performed. Intraoperative perforations were seen in 7 patients (1.6%). The mesorectal fascia was assessed as complete in 117/118 cases. In 32 cases (7%), the circumferential resection margin was 1 mm or less. After a median follow-up of 68 months, 5 (1.1%) patients developed a local recurrence; one of them had circumferential resection margin involvement. The 5-year overall survival was 77%. In the multivariate analysis, the circumferential resection margin was not an independent factor for disease-free survival.  Limitations:   Mesorectal fascia was not assessed before 2007. The findings might be explained by a type II error but, from a clinical perspective, enough patients were included to motivate the conclusion of the study.  Conclusions:   Circumferential resection margin is an important measurement in rectal cancer pathology, but the correlation to local recurrence is much less than previously stated, probably because of oncological treatment and surgery that respects the mesorectal fascia and, when required, en bloc resections. Circumferential resection margin should not be used as a prognostic marker in the modern multidisciplinary management of rectal cancer.""","""['Maziar Nikberg', 'Csaba Kindler', 'Abbas Chabok', 'Henry Letocha', 'Jayant Shetye', 'Kenneth Smedh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Dis Colon Rectum""","""['A circumferential resection margin of 1 mm is a negative prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients with and without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.', 'Selective approach for upper rectal cancer treatment: total mesorectal excision and preoperative chemoradiation are seldom necessary.', 'Circumferential margin plays an independent impact on the outcome of rectal cancer patients receiving curative total mesorectal excision.', 'Role of total mesorectal excision and of circumferential resection margin in local recurrence and survival of patients with rectal carcinoma.', 'The clinical significance of the circumferential resection margin following preoperative pelvic chemo-radiotherapy in rectal cancer: why we need a common language.', 'Development and validation of a prognostic nomogram for rectal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection.', 'Anus-Preserving Surgery in Advanced Low-Lying Rectal Cancer: A Perspective on Oncological Safety of Intersphincteric Resection.', 'Risk factors for small bowel obstruction after open rectal cancer resection.', 'The Elevated Pre-Treatment C-Reactive Protein Predicts Poor Prognosis in Patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Treated with Neo-Adjuvant Radiochemotherapy.', 'The Circumferential Resection Margin Is a Prognostic Predictor in Colon Cancer.']"""

However, the role of CD147 in autophagy has not yet been explored in prostrate cancer cells. In the present study, prostate cancer PC-3 cells were cultured under starvation conditions, and the expression level of CD147 gradually increased. Therefore, RNA interference was used to inhibit CD147 expression, in order to investigate the biological role of this glycoprotein in autophagy progression. Autophagic activity was monitored by the changes in green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) location and the expression of the autophagy-associated protein LC3-II. It was found that downregulation of CD147 significantly promoted GFP-LC3 puncta formation and the expression of LC3-II. Furthermore, the levels of phosphorylated serine/threonine protein kinase B (p-Akt) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) were significantly decreased, and the level of LC3-II was inversely associated with levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR in cells with downregulated expression of CD147. The results of a trypan blue exclusion assay revealed that starvation-induced cell death was increased in PC-3/shCD147 cells compared with control PC-3/Scramble cells (37.7±6.4 vs. 21.7±5.5%).

Unfortunately, cancer screening also results in overdiagnosis, the detection of cancers that, in the absence of screening, would not present symptomatically during one's lifetime. Thus, their detection and subsequent treatment is unnecessary and detrimental. This definition of overdiagnosis, while succinct, does not capture the ways it can occur, and our interactions with patients, advocates, researchers, clinicians, and journalists have led us to believe that the concept of overdiagnosis is difficult to explain and, for some, difficult to accept. We propose a dichotomy, the ""tumor-patient"" classification, to aid in understanding overdiagnosis. The tumor category includes asymptomatic malignant disease that would regress spontaneously if left alone, as well as asymptomatic malignant disease that stagnates or progresses too slowly to be life threatening in even the longest of lifetimes. The patient category includes asymptomatic malignant disease that would progress quickly enough to be life threatening during a lifetime of typical length, but lacks clinical relevance because death due to another cause intercedes prior to what would have been the date of symptomatic diagnosis had screening not occurred. Cancer screening of most organs is likely to result in overdiagnosis of both types. However, the ratio of tumor- to patient-driven overdiagnosis almost certainly varies, and may vary drastically, by organ, screening modality, patient characteristics, and other factors.""","""['Pamela M Marcus', 'Philip C Prorok', 'Anthony B Miller', 'Emily J DeVoto', 'Barnett S Kramer']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Why are a high overdiagnosis probability and a long lead time for prostate cancer screening so important?', 'Prostate Cancer Screening and the Associated Controversy.', 'Lung cancer screening gets risk-specific.', 'Cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment.', 'PSA measurement and prostate cancer--overdiagnosis and overtreatment?', 'Acceptability of risk stratification within population-based cancer screening from the perspective of the general public: A mixed-methods systematic review.', 'Acceptability of risk stratification within population-based cancer screening from the perspective of healthcare professionals: A mixed methods systematic review and recommendations to support implementation.', 'Should we screen for colorectal cancer in people aged 75 and over?

The transcription factor MYC is known to regulate lncRNAs and has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.  Methods:   CRC cells and tissues were profiled to identify lncRNAs differentially expressed in CRC, from which we further selected MYC-regulated lncRNAs. We used luciferase promoter assay, ChIP, RNA pull-down assay, deletion mapping assay, LC-MS/MS and RNA immunoprecipitation to determine the mechanisms of MYC regulation of lncRNAs. Moreover, soft agar assay and in vivo xenograft experiments (four athymic nude mice per group) provided evidence of MYC-regulated lncRNAs in cancer cell transformation and tumorigenesis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   We identified lncRNAs differentially expressed in CRC (P < .05, greater than two-fold) and verified four lncRNAs upregulated and two downregulated in CRC cells and tissues. We further identified MYC-regulated lncRNAs, named MYCLos. The MYC-regulated MYCLos may function in cell proliferation and cell cycle by regulating MYC target genes such as CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2B (p15), suggesting new regulatory mechanisms of MYC-repressed target genes through lncRNAs. RNA binding proteins including HuR and hnRNPK are involved in the function of MYCLos by interacting with MYCLo-1 and MYCLo-2, respectively. Knockdown experiments also showed that MYCLo-2, differentially expressed not only in CRC but also in prostate cancer, has a role in cancer transformation and tumorigenesis.

The objective of this study is to report our initial experience of applying a 3D-documented biopsy-mapping technology to precisely re-visit geographically documented low-risk prostate cancer and to perform serial analysis of cell-cycle-progression (CCP) gene-panel.  Methods:   Over a period of 40 months (1/2010-4/2013), the 3D-biopsy-mapping technique, in which the spatial location of biopsy-trajectory was digitally recorded (Koelis), was carried out. A pair of diagnostic (1st-look) and surveillance (2nd-look) biopsy were performed per subject (n = 25), with median interval of 12 months. The documented biopsy-trajectory was used as a target to guide the re-visiting biopsy from the documented cancer focus, as well as the targeted field-biopsy from the un-sampled prostatic field adjacent to negative diagnostic biopsies. The accuracy of re-visiting biopsy and biopsy-derived CCP signatures were evaluated in the pair of the serial biopsy-cores.  Results:   The 1st-look-biopsy revealed a total of 43 cancer lesions (1.7 per patient). The accuracy of re-visiting cancer was 86% (37/43) per lesion, 76% (65/86) per core, and 80% (20/25) per patient. This technology also provided an opportunity for 3D-targeted field-biopsy in order to potentially minimize sampling errors. The CCP gene-panel of the 1st-look (-0.59) versus 2nd-look (-0.37) samples had no significant difference (P = 0.4); which suggested consistency in the molecular signature of the known cancer foci during the short-time interval of median 12 months. Any change in CCP of the same cancer foci would be likely due to change in sampling location from the less to more significant portion in the cancer foci rather than true molecular progression. The study limitations include a small number of the patients.  Conclusion:   The 3D-documented biopsy-mapping technology achieved an encouraging re-sampling accuracy of 86% from the known prostate cancer foci, allowing the serial analysis of biopsy-derived CCP signatures.""","""['Osamu Ukimura', 'Mitchell E Gross', 'Andre Luis de Castro Abreu', 'Raed A Azhar', 'Toru Matsugasumi', 'So Ushijima', 'Motohiro Kanazawa', 'Manju Aron', 'Inderbir S Gill']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prognostic value of a cell-cycle progression score in men with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance after MRI-guided prostate biopsy--a pilot study.', 'Biopsy features associated with prostate cancer progression in active surveillance patients: comparison of three statistical models.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'Comprehensive analysis of post-diagnostic prostate-specific antigen kinetics as predictor of a prostate cancer progression in active surveillance patients.', 'Intraprostatic targeting.', '3D Registration of mpMRI for Assessment of Prostate Cancer Focal Therapy.', 'Value of Tracking Biopsy in Men Undergoing Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Profiling to Determine Clonality of Serial Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion Biopsies from Men on Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Single fraction multimodal image guided focal salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Trans-rectal ultrasound visibility of prostate lesions identified by magnetic resonance imaging increases accuracy of image-fusion targeted biopsies.']"""

Tumors are often characterized by a leaky vasculature, which - combined with the prolonged circulation kinetics of liposomes - leads to efficient tumor localization of these drug carriers, via the so-called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) -effect. In this study, we evaluated the utility of targeted, liposomal drug delivery of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone in a model of prostate cancer bone metastases.  Methods:   Tumor-bearing Balb-c nu/nu mice were treated intravenously with 0.2-1.0-5.0 mg/kg/week free- and liposomal DEX for 3-4 weeks and tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescent imaging.  Results:   Intravenously administered liposomes localize efficiently to bone metastases in vivo and treatment of established bone metastases with (liposomal) dexamethasone resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth up to 26 days after initiation of treatment. Furthermore, 1.0 mg/kg liposomal dexamethasone significantly outperformed 1.0 mg/kg free dexamethasone, and was found to be well-tolerated at clinically-relevant dosages that display potent anti-tumor efficacy.

Stromal interactions and branching morphogenesis displayed by adult tubule-initiating cells (TIC) are reminiscent of fetal prostate development. In the current study, we evaluated in vivo tubule initiation by human fetal prostate cells and determined expression profiles of fetal and adult epithelial subpopulations in an effort to identify pathways used by TIC.  Methods:   Immunostaining and FACS analysis based on Epcam, CD44, and CD49f expression demonstrated the majority (99.9%) of fetal prostate epithelial cells (FC) were Epcam⁺ CD44⁻ with variable levels of CD49f expression. Fetal populations isolated via cell sorting were implanted into immunocompromised mice. Total RNA isolation from Epcam⁺ CD44⁻ CD49f(Hi) FC, adult Epcam⁺ CD44⁻ CD49f(Hi) TIC, Epcam⁺ CD44⁺ CD49f(Hi) basal cells (BC), and Epcam⁺ CD44⁻ CD49f(Lo) luminal cells (LC) was performed, followed by microarray analysis of 19 samples using the Affymetrix Gene Chip Human U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Data was analyzed using Partek Genomics Suite Version 6.4. Genes selected showed >2-fold difference in expression and P < 5.00E-2. Results were validated with RT-PCR.  Results:   Grafts retrieved from Epcam⁺ CD44⁻ fetal cell implants displayed tubule formation with differentiation into basal and luminal compartments, while only stromal outgrowths were recovered from Epcam- fetal cell implants. Hierarchical clustering revealed four distinct groups determined by antigenic profile (TIC, BC, LC) and developmental stage (FC). TIC and BC displayed basal gene expression profiles, while LC expressed secretory genes. FC had a unique profile with the most similarities to adult TIC. Functional, network, and canonical pathway identification using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Version 7.6 compiled genes with the highest differential expression (TIC relative to BC or LC). Many of these genes were found to be significantly associated with prostate tumorigenesis.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate clustering gene expression profiles of FC and adult TIC. Pathways associated with TIC are known to be deregulated in cancer, suggesting a cell-of-origin role for TIC versus re-emergence of pathways common to these cells in tumorigenesis.""","""['Haibo Liu', 'Radu M Cadaneanu', 'Kevin Lai', 'Baohui Zhang', 'Lihong Huo', 'Dong Sun An', 'Xinmin Li', 'Michael S Lewis', 'Isla P Garraway']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Keratin 13 Is Enriched in Prostate Tubule-Initiating Cells and May Identify Primary Prostate Tumors that Metastasize to the Bone.', 'Epcam, CD44, and CD49f distinguish sphere-forming human prostate basal cells from a subpopulation with predominant tubule initiation capability.', 'Protein profile of basal prostate epithelial progenitor cells--stage-specific embryonal antigen 4 expressing cells have enhanced regenerative potential in vivo.', 'EpCAM and the biology of hepatic stem/progenitor cells.', 'EpCAM in morphogenesis.', 'Keratin 13 Is Enriched in Prostate Tubule-Initiating Cells and May Identify Primary Prostate Tumors that Metastasize to the Bone.', 'Integrated Classification of Prostate Cancer Reveals a Novel Luminal Subtype with Poor Outcome.']"""

However, the relationship is complex, with both increased and decreased expression associated with different stages of tumour metastases in several tumour types. The ITGA2 gene, which codes for the α2 subunit, was examined to investigate whether a large CpG island associated with its promoter region is involved in the differential expression of ITGA2 observed in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Bisulphite sequencing of the ITGA2 promoter was used to assess methylation in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate tumour specimens and prostate cancer cell lines, PC3, 22Rv1 and LNCaP. Changes in ITGA2 mRNA expression were measured using quantitative PCR. ITGA2 functionality was interrogated using cell migration scratch assays and siRNA knockdown experiments.  Results:   Bisulphite sequencing revealed strikingly decreased methylation at key CpG sites within the promoter of tumour samples, when compared with normal prostate tissue. Altered methylation of this CpG island is also associated with differences in expression in the non-invasive LNCaP, and the highly metastatic PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines. Further bisulphite sequencing confirmed that selected CpGs were highly methylated in LNCaP cells, whilst only low levels of methylation were observed in PC3 and 22Rv1 cells, correlating with ITGA2 transcript levels. Examination of the increased expression of ITGA2 was shown to influence migratory potential via scratch assay in PC3, 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells, and was confirmed by siRNA knockdown experiments.  Conclusions:   Taken together, our data supports the assertion that epigenetic modification of the ITGA2 promoter is a mechanism by which ITGA2 expression is regulated.""","""['Suyin Paulynn Chin', 'James R Marthick', 'Alison C West', 'Annabel K Short', 'Jyoti Chuckowree', 'Andrea M Polanowski', 'Russell J Thomson', 'Adele F Holloway', 'Joanne L Dickinson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Re: Regulation of the ITGA2 Gene by Epigenetic Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer.', 'CpG island promoter methylation and silencing of 14-3-3sigma gene expression in LNCaP and Tramp-C1 prostate cancer cell lines is associated with methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD2.', 'Epigenetic regulation of the ITGB4 gene in prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma reveal epigenetic deregulation of SLIT-ROBO, ITGA2 and MET signaling.', 'The importance of DNA methylation in prostate cancer development.', 'ETIOLOGY OF PROSTATE CANCER.', 'Elevated ITGA2 expression promotes collagen type I-induced clonogenic growth of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Non-coding RNA regulation of integrins and their potential as therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'Alpha2beta1 Integrin Polymorphism in Diffuse Astrocytoma Patients.', 'A novel long non-coding RNA regulates the integrin, ITGA2 in breast cancer.', 'miR-216a-mediated upregulation of TSPAN1 contributes to pancreatic cancer progression via transcriptional regulation of ITGA2.']"""

We studied the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the antioxidant gene superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) and cancer-specific outcomes after RT.  Patients and methods:   Among 816 prostate cancer patients who received radiation as primary therapy from the Physicians' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we evaluated the association of 7 tagging SNPs in SOD2 with lethal prostate cancer (death from prostate cancer or distant metastasis among living patients). We sought to validate findings in a separate cohort of 612 prostate cancer patients treated with RT with a greater proportion of intermediate and high-risk Gleason scores at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Genetic effects were analyzed using a codominant model, using the genotype homozygous for the major allele as baseline.  Results:   Among patients who underwent RT in the test cohort, there was a significant association between 3 of the 7 SOD2 SNPs and lethal prostate cancer: rs6917589 (overall P = .006), rs2758331 (P = .04) and the functional valine to alanine polymorphism in rs4880 (P = .04).

However, contemporary cancer burden estimates in this population are sparse and do not account for the high competing risk of death characteristic of dialysis patients.  Study design:   Retrospective cohort study.  Setting & participants:   US adult patients enrolled in Medicare's ESRD program who received in-center hemodialysis.  Factors:   Demographic/clinical characteristics.  Outcomes:   For overall and site-specific cancers identified using claims-based definitions, we calculated annual incidence rates (1996-2009). We estimated 5-year cumulative incidence since dialysis therapy initiation using competing-risk methods.  Results:   We observed a constant rate of incident cancers for all sites combined, from 3,923 to 3,860 cases per 100,000 person-years (annual percentage change, 0.1; 95% CI, -0.4 to 0.6). Rates for some common site-specific cancers increased (ie, kidney/renal pelvis) and decreased (ie, colon/rectum, lung/bronchus, pancreas, and other sites). Of 482,510 incident hemodialysis patients, cancer was diagnosed in 37,128 within 5 years after dialysis therapy initiation. The 5-year cumulative incidence of any cancer was 9.48% (95% CI, 9.39%-9.57%) and was higher for certain subgroups: older age, males, nonwhites, non-Hispanics, nondiabetes primary ESRD cause, recent dialysis therapy initiation, and history of transplantation evaluation. Among blacks and whites, we observed 35,767 cases compared with 25,194 expected cases if the study population had experienced rates observed in the US general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.41-1.43).

To efficiently block cholesterol esterification in cancer in vivo, we developed a systemically injectable nanoformulation of avasimibe (a potent ACAT-1 inhibitor), called avasimin. In cell lines of human prostate, pancreatic, lung, and colon cancer, avasimin significantly reduced cholesteryl ester storage in lipid droplets and elevated intracellular free cholesterol levels, which led to apoptosis and suppression of proliferation. In xenograft models of prostate cancer and colon cancer, intravenous administration of avasimin caused the concentration of avasimibe in tumors to be 4-fold higher than the IC50 value. Systemic treatment of avasimin notably suppressed tumor growth in mice and extended the length of survival time. No adverse effects of avasimin to normal cells and organs were observed.

Methods:   CD44+CD133+α2β1Integrin+CD24- population was isolated from mock or TGF-β treated (7 days) prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, through fluorescent activated cell sorting. Cell lysates were obtained from the ±TGF-β cell population and proteomics profiling (MS/MS) was performed by mass spectrometry. Relative enrichment or depletion in the CD44+CD24-population post-TGF-β treatment was determined relative to mock-treated CD44+CD24- cells post normalization to GAPDH expression levels. RESULTS obtained from MS/MS were validated using immunoblotting. Functional validation of one putative regulator was performed using gain-of-function strategy to investigate its role in rendering stemness in LNCaP and DU145 cells in vitro and in promoting tumorigenicity in vivo.  Results:   TGF-β treatment caused significant enrichment of CD44+CD24- population in LNCaP cells (22.35 ± 0.94% in mock treated vs 95.23 ± 2.34% in TGF-β treated cells; P < 0.01), which were also positive for CD133 and α2β1Integrin.

This has given rise to concerns that prostate specific antigen may be less reliable for predicting prostate cancer among obese men. We tested the accuracy of prebiopsy prostate specific antigen for predicting prostate cancer across body mass index categories.  Materials and methods:   We used the REDUCE study, which tested dutasteride for prostate cancer risk reduction in men with a prostate specific antigen of 2.5 to 10.0 ng/ml and a negative pre-study biopsy. All men were required to have a biopsy at 2 and 4 years independent of prostate specific antigen. We assessed the performance of prebiopsy prostate specific antigen to predict overall and high grade prostate cancer (Gleason sum 7 or greater) in each body mass index group using AUC.  Results:   Of 6,103 men who had a 2-year biopsy 1,646 (27%) were normal weight, 3,209 (53%) were overweight and 1,248 (20%) were obese.

In this study, we investigated the role of mechanical stimuli on human prostatic fibroblasts using a microfluidic platform that was adapted for our experiments and further developed for both repeatable performance among multiple assays and for compatibility with high-resolution confocal microscopy. Results show that mechanical stretching of normal tissue-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) alters the structure of secreted fibronectin. Specifically, unstretched NAFs deposit and assemble fibronectin in a random, mesh-like arrangement, while stretched NAFs produce matrix with a more organized, linearly aligned structure. Moreover, the stretched NAFs exhibited an enhanced capability for directing co-cultured cancer cell migration in a persistent manner.

Histological upgrading was defined as any increase in primary or secondary Gleason grade on repeat biopsy. Multivariate analysis was used to determine baseline and dynamic factors associated with Gleason upgrading. This information was used to develop a nomogram to predict for upgrading or treatment in patients electing for active surveillance.  Results:   Of 862 patients in our cohort 592 had 2 or more biopsies. Median followup was 6.4 years. Of the patients 20% were intermediate risk, 0.3% were high risk and all others were low risk. During active surveillance 31.3% of cases were upgraded. On multivariate analysis clinical stage T2, higher prostate specific antigen and higher percentage of cores involved with disease at the time of diagnosis predicted for upgrading. A total of 27 cases (15% of those upgraded) were Gleason 8 or higher at upgrading, and 62% of all 114 upgraded cases went on to have active treatment. The nomogram incorporated clinical stage, age, prostate specific antigen, core positivity and Gleason score. The concordance index was 0.61.

Our objective was to compare outcomes between patients who received adjuvant ADT (ADJ), ie, immediately after the completion of RT, to those who received a neoadjuvant and concurrent regimen (NEO).  Materials and methods:   From 1995 to 2002, 515 patients with prostate cancer were definitively treated with RT and ADT. NEO was provided 2 to 3 months before the start of RT (n = 311). ADJ was initiated immediately after the completion of RT (n = 204). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the impact of ADT timing on outcomes.  Results:   Ten-year bRFS, DMFS, and OS rates were 61%, 80%, and 66%, respectively. Ten-year bRFS rates for ADJ versus NEO were 63% versus 60% (P = .98). Ten-year DMFS rates for ADJ versus NEO were both 80% (P = .60). Ten-year OS rates for ADJ versus NEO were 65% versus 67% (P = .98).  Conclusion:   There was no significant difference in bRFS, DMFS, or OS between neoadjuvant versus adjuvant ADT in the setting of dose-escalated RT for localized prostate cancer. This suggests that the synergy between RT and androgen deprivation is independent of the sequencing of both modalities and that the initiation of RT does not need to be delayed for a course of neoadjuvant ADT.""","""['Michael A Weller', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Chandana A Reddy', 'Kevin L Stephans', 'Rahul D Tendulkar']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Extreme-risk prostate adenocarcinoma presenting with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)>40 ng/ml: prognostic significance of the preradiation PSA nadir.', 'PSA response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation is an independent prognostic marker and may identify patients who benefit from treatment escalation.', 'Dose escalated external beam radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and conventional dose external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: do we need both?', 'The addition of chemotherapy in the definitive management of high risk prostate cancer.', 'Neoadjuvant versus Concurrent Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Localized Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Prostate Radiotherapy With Adjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) Improves Metastasis-Free Survival Compared to Neoadjuvant ADT: An Individual Patient Meta-Analysis.', 'Sequencing of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy With External-Beam Radiotherapy in Localized Prostate Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Long term results of the NRG/RTOG 9413: a key study but one of the most confusing study in prostate cancer radiotherapy!', 'Sequence of hormonal therapy and radiotherapy field size in unfavourable, localised prostate cancer (NRG/RTOG 9413): long-term results of a randomised, phase 3 trial.']"""

Materials and methods:   We performed mutation analysis of the DICE1/INTS6 gene in thirteen German prostate cancer families.  Results and conclusion:   None of the patients harboured DICE1 mutations, and similar frequencies of the previously identified 13 bp deletion polymorphism in the DICE1 promoter were observed in the familial prostate cancer patients as compared with sporadic prostate cancer patients and controls. However, in one family with three affected brothers, the variations c.1215A>C (p.T405T) in exon 10 and c.2568A>G (p.S856S) in exon 17 were detected in a heterozygous pattern. In sporadic prostate cancer patients, variant c.2568A>G (p.S856S) was detected in 10/325 (3.08%) compared with 5/207 (2.42%) control samples (p > 0.05).

Themata:   The current form of cryoablation has almost nothing in common with those established in the 1960s and 1970s, which were further developed in the 1980s and 1990s. Nowadays it is a minimally invasively and highly effective treatment for high-risk carcinomas and failure of other therapeutic modalities.  Conclusion:   Thus, cryoablation of the prostate is indicated if there are absolute or relative contraindications for radical surgery. In salvage cases for localized prostate cancer, cryoablation is the therapy of choice. Cryoablation is also an option for focal therapy.

Treatments of localized PC are quite efficient and usually involve surgery, radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy. Metastatic PC is however rarely curable to this day. Treatments of metastatic PC involve radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal treatment such as orchiectomy, antiandrogens and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists. The suppression of tumor growth by hormonal treatment is efficient but overtime resistance still occurs and the disease progresses. Thus, more urgently than ever there is a need for discovery of new treatment options for castration-resistant PC (CRPC). Hence, we designed and tested a series of amide derivatives located at position 7α of testosterone as prospective ""natural"" or ""semisynthetic"" anticancer agents against CRPC with the goal of discovering therapeutic alternatives for the disease. This manuscript describes an efficient path towards the target molecules that are made in only 6 or 7 chemical steps from testosterone in good overall yields. This strategy can be used to make several compounds of interest that present higher biological activity than the classic antiandrogen; cyproterone acetate (3). The best testosterone-7α-amide was the N-2-pyridylethylamide (25) which was as active as the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate (3) on androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and 2.7 times more active on androgen-independent PC3 prostate cancer cells.

A promising target for imaging and therapy of PCa is the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which exhibits both expression within the epithelium of PCa cells, and becomes internalized upon ligand binding. Here we report the synthesis of a PSMA-targeted bionized nanoferrite (BNF) nanoparticle and its biological evaluation in an experimental model of PCa. The BNF nanoparticle formulation exhibits properties conducive to targeted imaging such as stealth, prolonged circulation time and enhanced clearance from non-target sites. Optical imaging of the targeted BNF in vivo indicates preferential accumulation in PSMA+ tumors 4 h post-injection, suggesting target specificity. On the other hand, non-targeted nanoparticles exhibit lower uptake with similar accumulation in both PSMA+ and PSMA- tumors indicating tumor access without preferential accumulation.

However, some cancer cells display resistance, or become resistant to TRAIL-induced cell death. Hyperthermia can enhance sensitivity to TRAIL-induced cell death in various resistant cancer cell lines, including lung, breast, colon or prostate carcinomas. Mild heat shock treatment has been proposed to restore Fas ligand or TRAIL-induced apoptosis through c-FLIP degradation or the mitochondrial pathway. We demonstrate here that neither the mitochondria nor c-FLIP degradation are required for TRAIL-induced cell death restoration during hyperthermia. Our data provide evidence that insolubilization of c-FLIP, alone, is sufficient to enhance apoptosis induced by death receptors. Hyperthermia induced c-FLIP depletion from the cytosolic fraction, without apparent degradation, thereby preventing c-FLIP recruitment to the TRAIL DISC and allowing efficient caspase-8 cleavage and apoptosis. Hyperthermia-induced c-FLIP depletion was independent of c-FLIP DED2 FL chain assembly motif or ubiquitination-mediated c-FLIP degradation, as assessed using c-FLIP point mutants on lysine 167 and 195 or threonine 166, a phosphorylation site known to regulate ubiquitination of c-FLIP. Rather, c-FLIP depletion was associated with aggregation, because addition of glycerol not only prevented the loss of c-FLIP from the cytosol but also enabled c-FLIP recruitment within the TRAIL DISC, thus inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis during hyperthermia. Altogether our results demonstrate that c-FLIP is a thermosensitive protein whose targeting by hyperthermia allows restoration of apoptosis induced by TNF ligands, including TRAIL. Our findings suggest that combining TRAIL agonists with whole-body or localized hyperthermia may be an interesting approach in cancer therapy.""","""['A Morlé', 'C Garrido', 'O Micheau']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Inhibition of RIP and c-FLIP enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Lipid rafts and nonrafts mediate tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand induced apoptotic and nonapoptotic signals in non small cell lung carcinoma cells.', 'Metformin sensitizes human bladder cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through mTOR/S6K1-mediated downregulation of c-FLIP.', 'Targeting c-FLIP in cancer.', 'Cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (C-FLIP): a novel target for cancer therapy.', 'Recent Advances in the Development of Nanodelivery Systems Targeting the TRAIL Death Receptor Pathway.', 'Hyperthermia Treatment as a Promising Anti-Cancer Strategy: Therapeutic Targets, Perspective Mechanisms and Synergistic Combinations in Experimental Approaches.', 'Grafting TRAIL through Either Amino or Carboxylic Groups onto Maghemite Nanoparticles: Influence on Pro-Apoptotic Efficiency.', 'Targeting apoptotic caspases in cancer.', 'Mild hyperthermia by MR-guided focused ultrasound in an ex vivo model of osteolytic bone tumour: optimization of the spatio-temporal control of the delivered temperature.']"""

Recently, rotational station parameter optimized radiation therapy (SPORT) has been proposed to improve the plan quality by inserting beams to the regions that demand additional intensity modulations, thus formulating nonuniform beam sampling. This work presents a new rotational SPORT planning strategy based on reweighted total-variation (TV) minimization (min.), using beam’s-eye-view dosimetrics (BEVD) guided beam selection. The convex programming based reweighted TV min. assures the simplified fluence-map, which facilitates single-aperture selection at each station for single-arc delivery. For the rotational arc treatment planning and non-uniform beam angle setting, the mathematical model needs to be modified by additional penalty term describing the fluence-map similarity and by determination of appropriate angular weighting factors. The proposed algorithm with additional penalty term is capable of achieving more efficient and deliverable plans adaptive to the conventional VMAT and SPORT planning schemes by reducing the dose delivery time about 5 to 10 s in three clinical cases (one prostate and two head-and-neck (HN) cases with a single and multiple targets). The BEVD guided beam selection provides effective and yet easy calculating methodology to select angles for denser, non-uniform angular sampling in SPORT planning. Our BEVD guided SPORT treatment schemes improve the dose sparing to femoral heads in the prostate and brainstem, parotid glands and oral cavity in the two HN cases, where the mean dose reduction of those organs ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 Gy. Also, it increases the conformation number assessing the dose conformity to the target from 0.84, 0.75 and 0.74 to 0.86, 0.79 and 0.80 in the prostate and two HN cases, while preserving the delivery efficiency, relative to conventional single-arc VMAT plans.""","""['Hojin Kim', 'Ruijiang Li', 'Rena Lee', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""[""Beam's-eye-view Dosimetrics-guided inverse planning for aperture-modulated arc therapy."", 'An adaptive planning strategy for station parameter optimized radiation therapy (SPORT): Segmentally boosted VMAT.', 'A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Simultaneous beam sampling and aperture shape optimization for SPORT.', 'Comparison of anatomy-based, fluence-based and aperture-based treatment planning approaches for VMAT.', 'Advances in Automated Treatment Planning.', 'Sub-arc collimator angle optimization based on the conformity index heatmap for VMAT planning of multiple brain metastases SRS treatments.', 'Optimization of collimator angles in dual-arc volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampus and inner ear sparing.', 'A fast deep learning approach for beam orientation optimization for prostate cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'VMAT optimization with dynamic collimator rotation.']"""

Moreover, the influence of LKB1 on target genes of the Hh signaling pathway was analyzed.

Meanwhile, we observed that LKB1 siRNA increased the expression of factors related to Hh signaling reporter activity in prostate cancer cells, including PTCH, SMO and SHH.

Days accrued in firefighting assignments (exposed-days), run totals (fire-runs) and run times (fire-hours) were used as exposure surrogates. HRs comparing 75th and 25th centiles of lagged cumulative exposures were calculated using loglinear, linear, log-quadratic, power and restricted cubic spline general relative risk models.

Results:   Among 19,309 male firefighters eligible for the study, there were 1333 cancer deaths and 2609 cancer incidence cases. Significant positive associations between fire-hours and lung cancer mortality and incidence were evident. A similar relation between leukaemia mortality and fire-runs was also found. The lung cancer associations were nearly linear in cumulative exposure, while the association with leukaemia mortality was attenuated at higher exposure levels and greater for recent exposures. Significant negative associations were evident for the exposure surrogates and colorectal and prostate cancers, suggesting a healthy worker survivor effect possibly enhanced by medical screening.

Human prostate cancer (PCa) LNCaP cells were cultured and transfected with synthetic has‑miR‑185 mimic or inhibitor. The transfected cells were subsequently evaluated with a viability assay, nuclear staining, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR), dual luciferase assay and western blot analysis. The results of the western blot analysis and RT‑qPCR indicated that transfection with an miR‑185 mimic markedly reduced the androgen receptor (AR) protein expression levels in LNCaP cells, whereas transfection with an miR‑185 inhibitor increased the protein expression of AR in the LNCaP cells. The results of the luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that the predicted target site in the AR 3' untranslated regions was a specific functional binding site for miR‑185, and that AR was a direct target of miR‑185. In addition, downregulation of AR by miR‑185 impaired the interaction between AR and androgen response element, and downregulated the expression of the AR target gene prostate specific antigen. Data also suggested that the downregulation of AR mediated by miR‑185, inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of the LNCaP cells.

Using a human fragment antigen-binding phage display library, we identified a human antibody termed U33 that selectively inhibited the active form of the protease urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA, PLAU). In the full-length immunoglobulin form, U33 IgG labeled with near-infrared fluorophores or radionuclides allowed us to noninvasively detect active uPA in prostate cancer xenograft models using optical and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging modalities. U33 IgG labeled with (111)In had a remarkable tumor uptake of 43.2% injected dose per gram (%ID/g) 72 hours after tail vein injection of the radiolabeled probe in subcutaneous xenografts. In addition, U33 was able to image active uPA in small soft-tissue and osseous metastatic lesions using a cardiac dissemination prostate cancer model that recapitulated metastatic human cancer. The favorable imaging properties were the direct result of U33 IgG internalization through an uPA receptor-mediated mechanism in which U33 mimicked the function of the endogenous inhibitor of uPA to gain entry into the cancer cell.

In this paper we compare chemical images measured in transmission and transflection from prostate tissue obtained from five different patients, and discuss the variability of the spectra acquired with each sampling modality. We find that spectra obtained in transflection undergo a non-linear distortion, i.e. non-linear variations in absorption band strength across the spectra, and that there are significant differences in spectra measured from the same area of tissue depending on the mode of operation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to highlight that poorer discrimination between benign and cancerous tissue is obtained in transflection mode.

Total RNA of PC3 cells was isolated for characterization of the gene expression profile following atorvastatin treatment. Atorvastatin treatment of PC3 cells for 24 h increased the expression of green fluorescent protein‑LC3‑II by >25%, and expression continued for >72 h, while apoptosis was not significantly induced within this time period. Four genes associated with the autophagy machinery were also significantly upregulated.

Most of this excess mortality is believed to be explained by 21 common diseases that have been formally established as caused by cigarette smoking and are included in official estimates of smoking-attributable mortality in the United States. However, if smoking causes additional diseases, these official estimates may significantly underestimate the number of deaths attributable to smoking.  Methods:   We pooled data from five contemporary U.S. cohort studies including 421,378 men and 532,651 women 55 years of age or older. Participants were followed from 2000 through 2011, and relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated with the use of Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for age, race, educational level, daily alcohol consumption, and cohort.  Results:   During the follow-up period, there were 181,377 deaths, including 16,475 among current smokers. Overall, approximately 17% of the excess mortality among current smokers was due to associations with causes that are not currently established as attributable to smoking. These included associations between current smoking and deaths from renal failure (relative risk, 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 2.3), intestinal ischemia (relative risk, 6.0; 95% CI, 4.5 to 8.1), hypertensive heart disease (relative risk, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.9 to 3.0), infections (relative risk, 2.3; 95% CI, 2.0 to 2.7), various respiratory diseases (relative risk, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6 to 2.4), breast cancer (relative risk, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.5), and prostate cancer (relative risk, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.7). Among former smokers, the relative risk for each of these outcomes declined as the number of years since quitting increased.  Conclusions:   A substantial portion of the excess mortality among current smokers between 2000 and 2011 was due to associations with diseases that have not been formally established as caused by smoking. These associations should be investigated further and, when appropriate, taken into account when the mortality burden of smoking is investigated.

The transition of a subset of tumors from indolent to invasive disease is associated with a poor clinical outcome. Activation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) genetic program is a major risk factor for cancer progression. We recently reported that secreted extracellular Hsp90 (eHsp90) initiates EMT in prostate cancer cells, coincident with its enhanced expression in mesenchymal models. Our current work substantially extended these findings in defining a pathway linking eHsp90 signaling to EZH2 function, a methyltransferase of the Polycomb repressor complex. EZH2 is also implicated in EMT activation, and its up-regulation represents one of the most frequent epigenetic alterations during prostate cancer progression. We have now highlighted a novel epigenetic function for eHsp90 via its modulation of EZH2 expression and activity. Mechanistically, eHsp90 initiated sustained activation of MEK/ERK, a signal critical for facilitating EZH2 transcriptional up-regulation and recruitment to the E-cadherin promoter. We further demonstrated that an eHsp90-EZH2 pathway orchestrates an expanded repertoire of EMT-related events including Snail and Twist expression, tumor cell motility, and anoikis resistance. To evaluate the role of eHsp90 in vivo, eHsp90 secretion was stably enforced in a prostate cancer cell line resembling indolent disease. Remarkably, eHsp90 was sufficient to induce tumor growth, suppress E-cadherin, and initiate localized invasion, events that are exquisitely dependent upon EZH2 function. In summary, our findings illuminate a hitherto unknown epigenetic function for eHsp90 and support a model wherein tumor eHsp90 functions as a rheostat for EZH2 expression and activity to orchestrate mesenchymal properties and coincident aggressive behavior.""","""['Krystal D Nolan', 'Omar E Franco', 'Michael W Hance', 'Simon W Hayward', 'Jennifer S Isaacs']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Secreted Hsp90 is a novel regulator of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer.', 'Hypoxia induces TWIST-activated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in\xa0vitro and in nude mice.', 'Secreted heat shock protein 90 promotes prostate cancer stem cell heterogeneity.', 'Mutations and deletions of PRC2 in prostate cancer.', 'EZH2, an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Markers in Prostate Cancer: From Bench to Bedside.', 'Heat Shock Protein 70 and 90 Family in Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting extracellular Hsp90: A unique frontier against cancer.', 'Tumour Derived Extracellular Vesicles: Challenging Target to Blunt Tumour Immune Evasion.']"""

We used the ethanol extract of Remotiflori radix (ERR) and the PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines in this study. We found that > 100 μg/mL ERR caused dose- and time-dependent cell death. Autophagic and apoptotic cell numbers increased in a dose-dependent manner as incubation time was prolonged, and LC3 punctuation, YO-PRO-1 uptake, DNA fragmentation, activation of caspases, and PARP cleavage were induced. Phosphorylation of AMPK, ULK, and p38 was increased after ERR treatment, and the level of the ER stress marker CHOP was also elevated. AMPK knockdown dramatically blocked ERR-mediated CHOP expression and cell death, suggesting that AMPK activation and ER stress play a critical role in ERR-induced cell death. Furthermore, oral administration of ERR at 50 mg/kg efficiently suppressed tumorigenic growth of PC-3 cells with no adverse effects. These results suggest that the ERR can be used as a safe and potent alternative therapy for patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Aeyung Kim', 'Minju Im', 'Jin Yeul Ma']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Chrysin induces death of prostate cancer cells by inducing ROS and ER stress.', 'Tanshinone IIA inhibits human prostate cancer cells growth by induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in vitro and in vivo.', 'Resveratrol activates autophagic cell death in prostate cancer cells via downregulation of STIM1 and the mTOR pathway.', 'Neuroprotective Strategy in Retinal Degeneration: Suppressing ER Stress-Induced Cell Death via Inhibition of the mTOR Signal.', 'The double-edged sword of AMPK signaling in cancer and its therapeutic implications.', 'Unravelling the Anticancer Mechanisms of Traditional Herbal Medicines with Metabolomics.', 'Inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway in Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention and Intervention.', 'Phytochemicals in Prostate Cancer: From Bioactive Molecules to Upcoming Therapeutic Agents.', 'Ampelopsin-induced reactive oxygen species enhance the apoptosis of colon cancer cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated AMPK/MAPK/XAF1 signaling.', 'Dioscin induces prostate cancer cell apoptosis through activation of estrogen receptor-β.']"""

Methods:   Cancer incidence was estimated in a large cohort of skiers (n=185,412) participating in the Vasaloppet long distance ski race in Sweden 1989-2010 and non-participants in the ski race, randomly selected from the Swedish general population (n=184,617). Data include race finishing times as a measurement of physical fitness. Hazard ratios (HRs) and net probability of cancer over twenty years of follow-up were estimated for all invasive cancer, and separately for prostate, breast, colo-rectal and lung cancer, and groups of cancers with presumed relation to lifestyle.  Findings:   Participating in Vasaloppet was associated with a relative risk reduction for all invasive cancer of 6% (95% confidence interval 2-9%) and a relative risk reduction of 32% (95% confidence interval 28-37%) of cancer sites where there is epidemiological evidence that smoking, bodyweight, regular PA and consumption of fruit and vegetables are aetiological factors. For skin cancer the risk was increased, as for prostate cancer. Skiers with shorter finishing times had lower incidence of cancer.  Interpretation:   This study indicates that it is unrealistic to reduce overall population cancer incidence drastically with life style. However, cancers that are epidemiologically associated with life style factors were significantly reduced by what presumably is a blend of non-smoking, normal body weight, sound dietary habits and PA. Our data thus provide additional support for present days' recommendations about life style prevention. Higher health awareness is associated with attendance to screening, which may explain our results for prostate cancer.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends bone scans and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during initial work-up of select patients with intermediate- or high-risk CaP. We quantify the proportion of patients who received work-up discordant with NCCN guidelines.  Methods:   Patients in the SEER-Medicare database diagnosed from 2004 to 2007 were included. We report bone scan and CT/MRI from date of diagnosis to the earlier of first treatment or 6 months.  Results:   Sixty-five percent of patients for whom bone scan was recommended received it, and 49% received recommended CT/MRI. Further, 43% of patients for whom bone scan was not recommended received it, and 38% received CT/MRI when not recommended. Age and race were significantly associated with discordance on multivariable models. There was significant regional variation. Underuse of recommended bone and CT/MRI scans decreased in more recent years, but overuse of unnecessary CT/MRI increased.

Gene expression profiling of prostate cancer cells, their radioresistant derivatives, ALDH(+) and ALDH(-) cell populations revealed the mechanisms, which link tumor progenitors to radioresistance, including activation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. We found that expression of the ALDH1A1 gene is regulated by the WNT signaling pathway and co-occurs with expression of β-catenin in prostate tumor specimens.

As part of a recent genome-wide association study it was determined that the A-allele of the rs4245739 SNP (A>C), located in the 3'-UTR of MDM4, is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Computational predictions revealed that the rs4245739 SNP is located within a predicted binding site for three microRNAs (miRNAs): miR-191-5p, miR-887 and miR-3669. Herein, we show using reporter gene assays and endogenous MDM4 expression analyses that miR-191-5p and miR-887 have a specific affinity for the rs4245739 SNP C-allele in prostate cancer. These miRNAs do not affect MDM4 mRNA levels, rather they inhibit its translation in C-allele-containing PC3 cells but not in LNCaP cells homozygous for the A-allele. By analysing gene expression datasets from patient cohorts, we found that MDM4 is associated with metastasis and prostate cancer progression and that targeting this gene with miR-191-5p or miR-887 decreases in PC3 cell viability. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate regulation of the MDM4 rs4245739 SNP C-allele by two miRNAs in prostate cancer, and thereby to identify a mechanism by which the MDM4 rs4245739 SNP A-allele may be associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer.""","""['Shane Stegeman', 'Leire Moya', 'Luke A Selth', 'Amanda B Spurdle', 'Judith A Clements', 'Jyotsna Batra']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""[""An illegitimate microRNA target site within the 3' UTR of MDM4 affects ovarian cancer progression and chemosensitivity."", 'A Regulatory MDM4 Genetic Variant Locating in the Binding Sequence of Multiple MicroRNAs Contributes to Susceptibility of Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'The MDM4 SNP34091 (rs4245739) C-allele is associated with increased risk of ovarian-but not endometrial cancer.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'MDM4: What do we know about the association between its polymorphisms and cancer?', 'The Role of MicroRNAs in Cancer Biology and Therapy from a Systems Biology Perspective.', 'Targeting MDM4 as a Novel Therapeutic Approach in Prostate Cancer Independent of p53 Status.', 'miR-1307-5p suppresses proliferation and tumorigenesis of bladder cancer via targeting MDM4 and the Hippo signaling pathway.', 'The landscape of GWAS validation; systematic review identifying 309 validated non-coding variants across 130 human diseases.', 'MDM4 alternative splicing and implication in MDM4 targeted cancer therapies.']"""

Therapies for advanced PCa exploit AR dependence by blocking the production or action of androgens, but these interventions inevitably fail via multiple mechanisms including mutation or deletion of the AR ligand binding domain (LBD). Thus, the development of new inhibitors which act through non-LBD interfaces is an unmet clinical need. EPI-001 is a bisphenol A-derived compound shown to bind covalently and inhibit the AR NH2-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we demonstrate that EPI-001 has general thiol alkylating activity, resulting in multilevel inhibitory effects on AR in PCa cell lines and tissues. At least one secondary mechanism of action associated with AR inhibition was found to be selective modulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). These multi-level effects of EPI-001 resulted in inhibition of transcriptional activation units (TAUs) 1 and 5 of the AR NTD, and reduced AR expression. EPI-001 inhibited growth of AR-positive and AR-negative PCa cell lines, with the highest sensitivity observed in LNCaP cells.

Transrectal ultrasound assessment was performed in all patients to measure prospectively the TPV, maximum flow rate (Qmax) and residual urine volume (RUV) after endocrine therapy. A total of 42 patients aged 76-98 (87.8 ± 5.6) years finished the investigation, with duration of endocrine therapy ranged 1-17 (6.5 ± 4.2) years, including orchidectomy in 18 patients, medical castration with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog in 24 patients.

Prostate cancer is a worldwide health problem, and therapeutic resistance is a critical obstacle for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients. Shikonin inhibits prostate cancer proliferation and metastasis. However, the role of GRP78 in the cytotoxic effect of shikonin in prostate cancer cells remains unclear. GRP78 expression was abolished using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and the anticancer effects of shikonin were assessed using MTT assays, the XCELLigence biosensor, flow cytometric cell cycle analysis, and Annexin V-PI apoptotic assays. PC-3 cells expressed more GRP78 than DU-145 cells, and the MTT assays revealed that DU-145 cells were more sensitive to shikonin than PC-3 cells. GRP78 knockdown (GRP78KD) PC-3 cells were more sensitive to shikonin treatment than scrambled siRNA control cells. Based on cell cycle analysis and AnnexinV-PI apoptotic assays, apoptosis dramatically increased in GRP78KD cells compared with the control PC-3 in response to shikonin. Finally, in response to shikonin treatment, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 levels increased in the scrambled control cells treated with shikonin, whereas Bcl-2 decreased and Mcl-1 slightly increased in the GRP78KD PC-3 cells. The levels of Bax and Bad did not change in the scrambled control or GRP78KD cells after shikonin treatment.

The androgen deprivation therapy is the standard treatment for advanced stages. Unfortunately, virtually all tumors become resistant to androgen withdrawal. The progression to castration-resistance is not fully understood, although a recent paper has suggested translationally controlled tumor protein to be implicated in the process. The present study was designed to investigate the role of this protein in prostate cancer, focusing on the correlation between its expression level with tumor differentiation and response to treatment. We retrieved 292 prostatic cancer specimens; of these 153 had been treated only by radical prostatectomy and 139 had undergone radical prostatectomy after neoadjuvant treatment with combined androgen blockade therapy. Non-neoplastic controls were represented by 102 prostatic peripheral zone specimens. In untreated patients, the expression of the protein, evaluated by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry, was significantly higher in tumor specimens than in non-neoplastic control, increasing as Gleason pattern and score progressed. In treated prostates, the staining was correlated with the response to treatment. An association between protein expression and the main clinicopathological factors involved in prostate cancer aggressiveness was identified. These findings suggest that the protein may be a promising prognostic factor and a target for therapy.""","""['Bruno Jim Rocca', 'Alessandro Ginori', 'Aurora Barone', 'Calogera Calandra', 'Filippo Crivelli', 'Giulia De Falco', 'Sara Gazaneo', 'Sergio Tripodi', 'Gabriele Cevenini', 'Maria Teresa del Vecchio', 'Maria Raffaella Ambrosio', 'Piero Tosi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Macrophage migration inhibitory factor in prostatic adenocarcinoma: correlation with tumor grading and combination endocrine treatment-related changes.', 'Lymphatic Vascularization in Prostate Adenocarcinoma: Correlation with Tumor Grade, Androgen Withdrawal and Prognosis.', 'Differential response to neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in prostate cancer: Predictive morphological parameters and molecular markers.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Pathological changes in benign and malignant prostatic tissue following androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Polymorphisms in TPT1 Pathways in Pediatric Astrocytomas.', 'Upregulation of Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein Is Associated With Cervical Cancer Progression.', 'Novel Gene Signatures Predictive of Patient Recurrence-Free Survival and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Granulysin, a novel marker for extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type.', 'TCTP as a therapeutic target in melanoma treatment.']"""

Prostate tissue samples analyzed by 2D-DIGE (two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis) and mass spectrometry (MS) revealed downregulation of secernin-1 (P<0.044) in prostate cancer, while vinculin showed significant upregulation (P<0.001). Secernin-1 overexpression in prostate tissue was validated using Western blot and immunohistochemistry while vinculin expression was validated using immunohistochemistry. These findings indicate that secernin-1 and vinculin are potential new tissue biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis, respectively. For validation, protein levels in urine were also examined by Western blot analysis. Urinary vinculin levels in prostate cancer patients were significantly higher than in urine from nontumor patients (P=0.006). Using multiple reaction monitoring-MS (MRM-MS) analysis, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) showed significant higher levels in the urine of prostate cancer patients compared to controls (P=0.012), while galectin-3 showed significant lower levels in the urine of prostate cancer patients with biochemical relapse, compared to those without relapse (P=0.017).

Material and methods:   Human tissue was obtained from patients who had undergone radical cystectomy for bladder cancer (10 diabetic and 11 non-diabetic males). Interstitial cells were stained immunohistochemically with anti-human CD117 (c-kit) rabbit polyclonal antibody, Vimentin, and Connexin-43. Neural tissue was stained with synaptophysin. The number of ICs and neurons was evaluated and compared between the groups (diabetic versus non-diabetic).  Results:   The mean number of c-kit (+) ICs in bladder lamina propria was significantly decreased in diabetics (32.40 ±12.96 versus 57.18 ±25.37, p = 0.036). The mean number of ICs in the detrusor muscle was significantly decreased in diabetics (40.50 ±16.79 versus 64.55 ±22.08, p = 0.013). Between the groups, no significant differences were detected regarding the number of ICs at the level of the ureter, urethra, and prostate. No significant differences were detected regarding the number of nerves in the ureter, bladder, prostate, and urethra of both groups.  Conclusions:   The number of ICs may be decreased in the lamina propria and detrusor muscle of the human bladder in diabetes.

Patients and methods:   Patients with CRCP treated with abiraterone were identified. Baseline variables and potential prognostic factors were extracted from electronic records. Outcome measures included overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and time to PSA progression (TTPP). The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze survival data.  Results:   A total of 61 patients met the inclusion criteria. In multivariate analysis, three independent predictors of OS were identified: Duration of response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (hazard ratio(HR)=0.95, p=0.006), performance status (HR=7.4, p=0.013), and baseline haemoglobin (HR=0.47, p≤0.001).

On this effort, prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), prostate health index (phi) and sarcosine have been presented as promising tools. We evaluated the ability of these biomarkers to predict the pathologic PCa characteristics within a prospectively collected contemporary cohort of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for clinically localized PCa at a single high-volume Institution.  Materials and methods:   The prognostic performance of PCA3, phi and sarcosine were evaluated in 78 patients undergoing RP for biopsy-proven PCa. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses tested the accuracy (area under the curve (AUC)) in predicting PCa pathological characteristics. Decision curve analyses (DCA) were used to assess the clinical benefit of the three biomarkers.  Results:   We found that PCA3, phi and sarcosine levels were significantly higher in patients with tumor volume (TV)≥0.5 ml, pathologic Gleason sum (GS)≥7 and pT3 disease (all p-values≤0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that phi is an accurate predictor of high-stage (AUC 0.85 [0.77-0.93]), high-grade (AUC 0.83 [0.73-0.93]) and high-volume disease (AUC 0.94 [0.88-0.99]). Sarcosine showed a comparable AUC (0.85 [0.76-0.94]) only for T3 stage prediction, whereas PCA3 score showed lower AUCs, ranging from 0.74 (for GS) to 0.86 (for TV).

We hypothesized that a genomic classifier (GC) would provide prognostic and predictive insight into the development of clinical metastases in men receiving post-RP RT and inform decision making.  Patients and methods:   GC scores were calculated from 188 patients with pT3 or margin-positive prostate cancer, who received post-RP RT at Thomas Jefferson University and Mayo Clinic between 1990 and 2009. The primary end point was clinical metastasis. Prognostic accuracy of the models was tested using the concordance index for censored data and decision curve analysis. Cox regression analysis tested the relationship between GC and metastasis.  Results:   The cumulative incidence of metastasis at 5 years after RT was 0%, 9%, and 29% for low, average, and high GC scores, respectively (P = .002). In multivariable analysis, GC and pre-RP prostate-specific antigen were independent predictors of metastasis (both P < .01). Within the low GC score (< 0.4), there were no differences in the cumulative incidence of metastasis comparing patients who received adjuvant or salvage RT (P = .79). However, for patients with higher GC scores (≥ 0.4), cumulative incidence of metastasis at 5 years was 6% for patients treated with adjuvant RT compared with 23% for patients treated with salvage RT (P < .01).  Conclusion:   In patients treated with post-RP RT, GC is prognostic for the development of clinical metastasis beyond routine clinical and pathologic features. Although preliminary, patients with low GC scores are best treated with salvage RT, whereas those with high GC scores benefit from adjuvant therapy.

We aim to assess nationally representative trends in treatment over time and determine potential geographic variation using two large national claims registries.  Methods:   Men with prostate cancer insured by Medicare (1998-2006) or a private insurer (Ingenix database, 2002-2006) were identified using International Classification of Diseases-9 and Current Procedural Terminology-4 codes. Geographic variation and trends in the type of treatment utilized over time were assessed. Geographic data were mapped using the GeoCommons online mapping platform. Predictors of any treatment were determined using a hierarchical generalized linear mixed model using the logit link function.  Results:   The use of radical prostatectomy increased, 33-48%, in the privately insured i3 database while remaining stable at 12% in the Medicare population. There was a rapid uptake in the use of newer technologies over time in both the Medicare and i3 cohorts. The use of laparoscopic-assisted prostatectomy increased from 1% in 2002 to 41% in 2006 in i3 patients, whereas the incidence increased from 3% in 2002 to 35% in 2006 for Medicare patients. The use of neoadjuvant/adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was lower in the i3 cohort and has decreased over time in both i3 and Medicare. Physician density had an impact on the type of primary treatment received in the New England region; however, this trend was not seen in the western or southern regions of the United States.  Conclusions:   Using two large national claims registries, we have demonstrated trends over time and substantial geographic variation in the type of primary treatment used for localized prostate cancer. Specifically, there has been a large increase in the use of newer technologies (that is, laparoscopic-assisted prostatectomy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy).

Chemotherapy-naïve patients treated with attenuated doses of ketoconazole (200-300 mg three times daily) had PSA response rate (>50% decline) of 21-62%. We hypothesized that low-dose ketoconazole would likewise possess efficacy and tolerability in the CRPC post-chemotherapy state.  Methods:   Men with CRPC and performance status 0-3, adequate organ function and who had received prior docetaxel were treated with low-dose ketoconazole (200 mg orally three times daily) and hydrocortisone (20 mg PO qAM and 10 mg PO qPM) until disease progression. Primary endpoint was PSA response rate (>50% reduction from baseline) where a rate of 25% was to be considered promising for further study (versus a null rate of <5%); 25 patients were required. Secondary endpoints included PSA response >30% from baseline, progression-free survival (PFS), duration of stable disease and evaluation of adverse events (AEs).

Median PFS was 138 days; median duration of stable disease was 123 days. Twelve patients experienced grade 3 or 4 AEs. Of the 17 grade 3 AEs, only 3 were attributed to treatment. None of the two grade 4 AEs were considered related to treatment.  Conclusions:   In docetaxel pre-treated CRPC patients, low-dose ketoconazole and hydrocortisone is a well-tolerated, relatively inexpensive and clinically active treatment option. PSA response to low-dose ketoconazole appears historically comparable to that of abiraterone in this patient context. A prospective, randomized study of available post-chemotherapy options is warranted to assess comparative efficacy.""","""['E N Lo', 'L A Beckett', 'C X Pan', 'D Robles', 'J M Suga', 'J M Sands', 'P N Lara Jr']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy following ketoconazole in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for prior therapy in clinical trials.', 'The influence of prednisone on the efficacy of docetaxel in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a retrospective review of the Princess Margaret experience of (I) low dose abiraterone and (II) prior ketoconazole.', 'Chemotherapy with or without estramustine for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Effect of combination therapy with aminoglutethimide and hydrocortisone on prostate-specific antigen response in metastatic prostate cancer refractory to standard endocrine therapy.', 'Clotrimazole Inhibits HCC Migration and Invasion by Modulating the ERK-p65 Signaling Pathway.']"""

Extensive research has revealed that the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), which is considered to be a key factor in osteoclast differentiation, plays an important role in cancer-associated bone resorption. Therefore, agents that can suppress this bone loss have therapeutic potential. In this study, we detected whether quetiapine (QUE), a commonly used atypical antipsychotic drug, can inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro and prevent human breast cancer-induced bone loss in vivo. RAW 264.7 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were used to detect inhibitory effect of QUE on osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Mouse model of breast cancer metastasis to bone was used to test suppressive effect of QUE on breast cancer-induced bone loss in vivo. Our results show that QUE can inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation from RAW 264.7 cells and BMMs without signs of cytotoxicity. Moreover, QUE reduced the occurrence of MDA-MB-231 cell-induced osteolytic bone loss by suppressing the differentiation of osteoclasts. Finally, molecular analysis revealed that it is by inhibiting RANKL-mediated MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways that QUE suppressed the osteoclast differentiation. We demonstrate, for the first time, the novel suppressive effects of QUE on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro and human breast cancer-induced bone loss in vivo, suggesting that QUE may be a potential therapeutic drug for osteolysis treatment.""","""['Hongkai Wang', 'Weiwei Shen', 'Xu Hu', 'Ying Zhang', 'Yunyun Zhuo', 'Tao Li', 'Feng Mei', 'Xinmin Li', 'Lan Xiao', 'Tongwei Chu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Caffeic acid 3,4-dihydroxy-phenethyl ester suppresses receptor activator of NF-κB ligand–induced osteoclastogenesis and prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss through inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/activator protein 1 and Ca2+–nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 signaling pathways.', 'Triptolide, a diterpene, inhibits osteoclastogenesis, induced by RANKL signaling and human cancer cells.', 'Maslinic acid suppresses osteoclastogenesis and prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss by regulating RANKL-mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.', 'RANK as a therapeutic target in cancer.', 'Biology of osteoclast activation in cancer.', 'IL-17A regulates autophagy and promotes osteoclast differentiation through the ERK/mTOR/Beclin1 pathway.', 'The optimized drug delivery systems of treating cancer bone metastatic osteolysis with nanomaterials.', 'ERK/AKT Inactivation and Apoptosis Induction Associate With Quetiapine-inhibited Cell Survival and Invasion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.', 'Raddeanin A suppresses breast cancer-associated osteolysis through inhibiting osteoclasts and breast cancer cells.', 'Blocking epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in glioblastoma with a sextet of repurposed drugs: the EIS regimen.']"""

Patient decision support interventions for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) have been shown to promote informed decision making and reduce PSA testing in efficacy trials, but their impact in real world settings is not clear.  Objective:   We performed an effectiveness trial of PSA decision support interventions in primary care.  Design:   A randomized controlled trial of three distribution strategies was compared to a control.  Participants:   Participants included 2,550 men eligible for PSA testing (76.6 % of the eligible population) and 2001 survey respondents (60.1 % survey response rate).  Interventions:   The intervention groups were: 1) mailed the DESI in DVD format, 2) offered a shared medical appointment (SMA) to view the DESI with other men and discuss, and 3) both options.  Main measures:   We measured PSA testing identified via electronic medical record at 12 months and DESI use by self-report 4 months after the intervention mailing.  Key results:   We found no differences in PSA testing across the three distribution strategies over a year-long follow-up period: 21 %, 24 %, 22 % in the DESI, SMA, and combined group respectively, compared to 21 % in the control group (p = 0.51). Self-reported DESI use was low across all strategies at 4 months: 16 % in the mailed DESI group, 6 % in the SMA group, and 15 % in the combined group (p = < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Mailing PSA decision support interventions or inviting men to shared medical appointments unrelated to a primary care office visit do not appear to promote informed decision making, or change PSA testing behavior.""","""['Carmen L Lewis', 'Jared Adams', 'Ming Tai-Seale', 'Qiwen Huang', 'Sarah B Knowles', 'Matthew E Nielsen', 'Michael P Pignone', 'Louise C Walter', 'Dominick L Frosch']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Gen Intern Med""","""['Delivering a decision support intervention about PSA screening to patients outside of clinical encounters is ineffective in promoting informed decision-making.', 'Shared decision making in prostate-specific antigen testing: the effect of a mailed patient flyer prior to an annual exam.', 'Supporting informed decision making for prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing on the web: an online randomized controlled trial.', 'Delivering a decision support intervention about PSA screening to patients outside of clinical encounters is ineffective in promoting informed decision-making.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'American Urological Association (AUA) guideline on prostate cancer detection: process and rationale.', 'The Need for Brevity During Shared Decision Making (SDM) for Cancer Screening: Veterans\' Perspectives on an ""Everyday SDM"" Compromise.', 'Contemporary use of real-world data for clinical trial conduct in the United States: a scoping review.', 'Impact of a Lung Cancer Screening Information Film on Informed Decision-making: A Randomized Trial.', 'Engaging Patients in Decisions About Cancer Screening: Exploring the Decision Journey Through the Use of a Patient Portal.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening: A Brief Tool to Incorporate Patient Preferences in a Clinical Encounter.']"""

Methods:   A total of 48 patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer were included. They had been treated with continuous maximal androgen blockade therapy, but their serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increased after initial hormonal therapy. Patients were given bicalutamide (150 mg per day). Serum PSA testing was performed every 3 months. The response was defined according to PSA decline from baseline: PSA decline ≥85% as complete response, ≥50 % but <85% as partial response, and <50 % as failure. Response duration was defined as the time from PSA response until PSA increased ≥25 % or ≥2 ng/mL from the nadir.

Among these, 283 men had persistent suspicion of PCa despite prior negative TRUS-B finding. An MRI was obtained in 112, and a lesion (prostate imaging reporting and data system score ≥ 3) was identified in 88 cases (78%). A subsequent combined MRI-targeted and standard template biopsy was performed in 86 cases. A matching cohort of 86 patients was selected using a one-nearest neighbor method without replacement. The end points were the rate of diagnosis of PCa and significant PCa (sPCa) (Gleason > 6, or > 2 cores, or > 50% of any core).

Among all recognized epigenetic alterations, aberrant DNA methylation (hypo- and hypermethylation) is the most important and the best characterized change in PCa.  Background:   We analyzed GSTP1, APC and RASSF1 gene promoter hypermethylation in urine DNA of ten previously non-treated prostate-diseased patients.  Methods:   For the purpose, the quantitative real-time methylation specific PCR (MSP) with primers designed for amplification of methylated bisulfite-converted human DNA, followed by melting procedure, was currently optimized.  Results:   GSTP1 gene promoter hypermethylation was detected in 2 and 1 out of 5 patients with biopsy-confirmed PCa using the primers covering the 3´ and 5´ CpG regions of the promoter, respectively. The APC gene promoter hypermethylation was found in neither of PCa or non-PCa patients and the RASSFI gene promoter hypermethylation was found in some non-PCa and not in all PCa patients.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that GSTP1 gene promoter hypermethylation can be detected in urine DNA of PCa patients with real-time MSP followed by melting.

Objective:   To increase the specificity of screening for lethal PCa at an early stage.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a case-control study nested within a population-based cohort. PSA and three additional kallikreins were measured in cryopreserved blood from a population-based cohort in Västerbotten, Sweden. Of 40379 men providing blood at ages 40, 50, and 60 yr from 1986 to 2009, 12542 men were followed for >15 yr. From this cohort, the Swedish Cancer Registry identified 1423 incident PCa cases, 235 with distant metastasis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Risk of distant metastasis for different PSA levels and a prespecified statistical model based on the four kallikrein markers.  Results and limitations:   Most metastatic cases occurred in men with PSA in the top quartile at age 50 yr (69%) or 60 yr (74%), whereas 20-yr risk of metastasis for men with PSA below median was low (≤0.6%). Among men with PSA >2 ng/ml, a prespecified model based on four kallikrein markers significantly enhanced the prediction of metastasis compared with PSA alone. About half of all men with PSA >2 ng/ml were defined as low risk by this model and had a ≤1% 15-yr risk of metastasis.  Conclusions:   Screening at ages 50-60 yr should focus on men with PSA in the top quartile. A marker panel can aid biopsy decision making.  Patient summary:   For men in their fifties, screening should focus on those in the top 10% to 25% of PSA values because the majority of subsequent cases of distant metastasis are found among these men.

Objective:   To determine the early genitourinary functional and cancer control outcomes of index lesion ablation.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a single-centre prospective development study in which 56 men were treated (July 2009-January 2011). The mean age was 63.9 yr (standard deviation 5.8) and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 7.4 ng/ml (interquartile range [IQR] 5.6-9.5). There were seven (12.5%) low-risk, 47 (83.9%) intermediate-risk, and two (3.6%) high-risk cancers.  Intervention:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and prostate biopsies to localise disease, followed by index lesion ablation using high-intensity focused ultrasound.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcomes were genitourinary side effects measured using validated questionnaires. Secondary outcomes included absence of clinically significant disease at 12 mo.  Results and limitations:   The composite of leak-free, pad-free continence, and erections sufficient for penetration decreased from a baseline frequency of 40/56 (71.4%) to 33/56 (58.9%) at 12 mo. Pad-free and leak-free, pad-free continence was preserved in 48/52 (92.3%) and 46/50 (92.0%) patients, respectively. Erections sufficient for intercourse were preserved in 30/39 (76.9%) patients. The median PSA nadir decreased to 2.4 ng/ml (IQR 1.6-4.1). At 12 mo, 42/52 (80.8%) patients had histological absence of clinically significant cancer and 85.7% (48/56) had no measurable prostate cancer (biopsy and/or mpMRI). Two (3.6%) patients had clinically significant disease in untreated areas not detected at baseline. The main study limitation is the short follow-up duration.  Conclusions:   Index lesion ablation had low rates of genitourinary side effects and acceptable short-term absence of clinically significant cancer. Comparative effectiveness trials are required to assess cancer control outcomes against radical therapy.  Patient summary:   In this study we looked at whether it is possible to treat the largest and highest-grade tumour in men who have more than one known prostate tumour. We show that the side effects of targeted ablation were low, with acceptable rates of early cancer control. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed.

We investigated the expression and clinical significance of CCR7 in our large collection of prostate cancer (PCa) samples and explored its function on the proliferation and migration of PCa cells. In this study, the expression of CCR7 was examined by immunohistochemical staining and quantitative RT-PCR in primary PCa tissues from 60 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Then, we investigated the functional role of CCR7 in PCa cell proliferation and migration by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion. The positive rate of CCR7 staining was 88.33 % (53/60) in the PCa group and 16.67 % (10/60) in cases of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH); the difference of CCR7 expression between PCa and BPH was statistically significant. The results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. CCR7 was significantly elevated in all five PCa cell lines when compared to the RWPE-1 cells. Silencing of CCR7 inhibited the proliferation of PC3 cells which have a relatively high level of CCR7 in a time-dependent manner, and the invasion and migration of PC3 cells were distinctly suppressed.

Methods:   A multicenter data analysis of 956 patients with pT2R1N0/Nx tumors was performed. Patients underwent radical prostatectomy between 1994 and 2009. No patients received neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. All prostate specimens were re-evaluated according to a well-defined protocol. The association of pathological and clinical features, in regard to BCR, was calculated using various statistical tests.  Results:   With a mean follow-up of 48 months, BCR was found in 25.4 %. In univariate analysis, multiple parameters such as tumor volume, PSA, Gleason at positive margin were significantly associated with BCR. However, in multivariate analysis, Gleason score (GS) of the prostatectomy specimen was the only significant parameter for BCR. Median time to recurrence for GS ≤ 6 was not reached; 5-year BCR-free survival was 82 %; and they were 127 months and 72 % for GS 3+4, 56 months and 54 % for GS 4 + 3, and 27 months and 32 % for GS 8-10.

Recently, it has been known that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may act as an exogenous factor to enhance cancer progression. Triclosan (TCS) and 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1) were reported to bioaccumulate in human bodies through the skin absorption. However, there has been insufficient evidence on the findings that the intervention of EDCs may promote the cancer progression in PCa. In the present study, to verify the risk of TCS and BP-1 to a PCa progression, cancer cell proliferation and migration were investigated in LNCaP PCa cells. TCS and BP-1 increased LNCaP cell proliferative activity and migration as did dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This phenomenon was reversed by the treatment with bicalutamide, a well known AR antagonist, suggesting that TCS and BP-1 acted as a xenoandrogen in LNCaP cells via AR signaling pathway by mimicking the action of DHT. A Western blot assay was performed to identify the alterations in the translational levels of cell growth- and metastasis-related markers, i.e., c-fos, cyclin E, p21, and cathepsin D genes. The expressions of genes related with G1/S transition of cell cycle and metastasis were increased by DHT, TCS, and BP-1, while the expression of p21 protein responsible for cell cycle arrest was reduced by DHT, TCS, and BP-1. Taken together, these results indicated that TCS and BP-1 may enhance the progression of PCa by regulating cell cycle and metastasis-related genes via AR signaling pathway.""","""['Seung-Hee Kim', 'Kyung-A Hwang', 'Soon-Mi Shim', 'Kyung-Chul Choi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Environ Toxicol Pharmacol""","""['Influence of hexabromocyclododecane and 4-nonylphenol on the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and migration in prostatic cancer cells.', 'Metformin represses androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancers by targeting androgen receptor.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Interleukin-8 signaling promotes androgen-independent proliferation of prostate cancer cells via induction of androgen receptor expression and activation.', 'Triclosan: An Update on Biochemical and Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Triclosan: A Small Molecule with Controversial Roles.', 'Comprehensive insight into triclosan-from widespread occurrence to health outcomes.', 'Triclosan induces apoptosis in Burkitt lymphoma-derived BJAB cells through caspase and JNK/MAPK pathways.', 'Long-term exposure to triclosan increases migration and invasion of human breast epithelial cells in vitro.', 'Triclocarban, Triclosan, Bromochlorophene, Chlorophene, and Climbazole Effects on Nuclear Receptors: An in Silico and in Vitro Study.']"""

We previously reported favorable biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) in high-risk Pca patients treated with a neoadjuvant therapy comprising a luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist plus low dose estramustine phosphate (EMP) (LHRH+EMP) followed by radical prostatectomy (RP). In the present study, we used a retrospective design via propensity score matching to elucidate the clinical benefit of neoadjuvant LHRH+EMP for high-risk Pca.  Methods:   The Michinoku Urological Cancer Study Group database contained data for 1,268 consecutive Pca patients treated with RP alone at 4 institutions between April 2000 and March 2011 (RP alone group). In the RP alone group, we identified 386 high-risk Pca patients. The neoadjuvant LHRH+EMP group included 274 patients with high-risk Pca treated between September 2005 and November 2013 at Hirosaki University. Neoadjuvant LHRH+EMP therapy included LHRH and EMP administration at a dose of 280 mg/day for 6 months before RP. The outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and BRFS.  Results:   The propensity score-matched analysis indicated 210 matched pairs from both groups. The 5-year BRFS rates were 90.4 and 65.8 % for the neoadjuvant LHRH+EMP and RP alone groups, respectively (P < 0.0001). The 5-year OS rates were 100 and 96.1 % for the neoadjuvant LHRH+EMP and RP alone groups, respectively (P = 0.110).

Materials and methods:   We studied 10,273 patients in the SEER database diagnosed with clinically low risk disease (cT1c/T2a, prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml, Gleason 3 + 3 = 6) in 2010 to 2011 and treated with prostatectomy. The primary outcome was the incidence of upgrading to pathological Gleason score 7-10 or up staging to pathological T3-T4/N1 disease. Multivariable logistic regression of cases with complete biopsy data (5,581) identified significant predictors of upgrading or up staging, which were then used to create a risk stratification table.  Results:   At prostatectomy 44% of cases were upgraded and 9.7% were up staged. Multivariable analysis of 5,581 patients showed age, prostate specific antigen and percent positive cores (all p < 0.001) but not race were associated with occult, advanced disease. With these variables dichotomized at the median, age older than 60 years (AOR 1.39), prostate specific antigen greater than 5.0 ng/ml (AOR 1.28) and more than 25% positive cores (AOR 1.76) were significantly associated with upgrading (all p < 0.001). Similarly, age older than 60 years (AOR 1.42), prostate specific antigen greater than 5.0 ng/ml (AOR 1.44) and more than 25% positive cores (AOR 2.26) were associated with up staging (all p < 0.001).

Methods and materials:   HDR brachytherapy plans for five patients treated with WG HDR monotherapy were optimized to assess different treatment strategies. Plans were generated to treat the hemigland (HG), one-third gland (1/3G), and one-sixth gland (1/6G), as well as to assess treating the WG with a boost to one of those sub-volumes (WG + HG, WG + 1/3G, WG + 1/6G).

Methods:   Two hundred and thirty-one patients (70 TZ training-cohort; 76 PZ training-cohort; 85 TZ temporal validation-cohort) underwent mp-MRI and transperineal-template-prostate-mapping biopsy. PZ and TZ uni/multi-variate mp-MRI LR-models for classification of significant cancer (any cancer-core-length (CCL) with Gleason > 3 + 3 or any grade with CCL ≥ 4 mm) were derived from the respective cohorts and validated within the same zone by leave-one-out analysis. Inter-zonal performance was tested by applying TZ models to the PZ training-cohort and vice-versa. Classification performance of TZ models for TZ cancer was further assessed in the TZ validation-cohort. ROC area-under-curve (ROC-AUC) analysis was used to compare models.  Results:   The univariate parameters with the best classification performance were the normalised T2 signal (T2nSI) within the TZ (ROC-AUC = 0.77) and normalized early contrast-enhanced T1 signal (DCE-nSI) within the PZ (ROC-AUC = 0.79). Performance was not significantly improved by bi-variate/tri-variate modelling. PZ models that contained DCE-nSI performed poorly in classification of TZ cancer. The TZ model based solely on maximum-enhancement poorly classified PZ cancer.  Conclusion:   LR-models dependent on DCE-MRI parameters alone are not interchangable between prostatic zones; however, models based exclusively on T2 and/or ADC are more robust for inter-zonal application.  Key points:   • The ADC and T2-nSI of benign/cancer PZ are higher than benign/cancer TZ. • DCE parameters are significantly different between benign PZ and TZ, but not between cancerous PZ and TZ. • Diagnostic models containing contrast enhancement parameters have reduced performance when applied across zones.""","""['Nikolaos Dikaios', 'Jokha Alkalbani', 'Mohamed Abd-Alazeez', 'Harbir Singh Sidhu', 'Alex Kirkham', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Mark Emberton', 'Alex Freeman', 'Steve Halligan', 'Stuart Taylor', 'David Atkinson', 'Shonit Punwani']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Multi-parametric MRI zone-specific diagnostic model performance compared with experienced radiologists for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Evolution of multi-parametric MRI quantitative parameters following transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate.', 'Logistic regression model for diagnosis of transition zone prostate cancer on multi-parametric MRI.', 'Prostate zones and cancer: lost in transition?', 'Multiparametric Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Phenotype Classification: A Framework for Development and Validation.', 'Machine and Deep Learning Prediction Of Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness Using Multiparametric MRI.', 'Predicting the Grade of Prostate Cancer Based on a Biparametric MRI Radiomics Signature.', 'A Combined Radiomics and Machine Learning Approach to Distinguish Clinically Significant Prostate Lesions on a Publicly Available MRI Dataset.', ""Predicting Lung Cancer Patients' Survival Time via Logistic Regression-based Models in a Quantitative Radiomic Framework."", 'Automated reference tissue normalization of T2-weighted MR images of the prostate using object recognition.']"""

Methods and materials:   Eighty-nine patients accrued to a prostate SBRT dose escalation protocol were implanted with radiofrequency transponder beacons. The planning target volume (PTV) margin was 5 mm in all directions, except for 3 mm in the posterior direction. The prostate was kept within 2 mm of its planned position by the therapists halting dose delivery and, if necessary, correcting the couch position. We computed the number, type, and time required for interventions and where the prostate would have been during dose delivery had there been, instead, a single image-guided setup procedure prior to each treatment. Distributions of prostate displacements were computed as a function of time.  Results:   After the initial setup, 1.7 interventions per fraction were required, with a concomitant increase in time for dose delivery of approximately 65 seconds. Small systematic drifts in prostate position in the posterior and inferior directions were observed in the study patients. Without CMI, intrafractional motion would have resulted in approximately 10% of patients having a delivered dose that did not meet our clinical coverage requirement, that is, a PTV D95 of >90%. The posterior PTV margin required for 95% of the dose to be delivered with the target positioned within the PTV was computed as a function of time. The margin necessary was found to increase by 2 mm every 5 minutes, starting from the time of the imaging procedure.  Conclusions:   CMI using a tight 2-mm displacement threshold was not only feasible but was found to deliver superior PTV coverage compared with the conventional image-guided procedure in the SBRT setting.""","""['D Michael Lovelock', 'Alessandra P Messineo', 'Brett W Cox', 'Marisa A Kollmeier', 'Michael J Zelefsky']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Dosimetric and deformation effects of image-guided interventions during stereotactic body radiation therapy of the prostate using an endorectal balloon.', 'Kilovoltage intrafraction motion monitoring and target dose reconstruction for stereotactic volumetric modulated arc therapy of tumors in the liver.', 'Day-to-day reproducibility of prostate intrafraction motion assessed by multiple kV and MV imaging of implanted markers during treatment.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Clinical trials of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: updates and future direction.', 'Dynamic intrafractional position monitoring with implanted fiducial markers for enhanced accuracy in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy: quantifying intra-fraction motion and calculating margins using the new BIR geometric uncertainties in daily online IGRT recommendations.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'Assessment of delivered dose in prostate cancer patients treated with ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy on 1.5-Tesla MR-Linac.', 'Intrafraction Prostate Motion Management for Ultra-Hypofractionated Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Patients and method:   A total of 36 patients and their female partners who had SI prior to and 12 months after nsRPx were included in this study. Sixty months following nsRPx, couples were asked about frequency of SI, satisfaction of sexual life, usage of medical aid for erections, and sexual function [patients: IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function), partners: FSFI (Female Sexual Function Index)].  Results:   Thirty couples (83.3%) were available for follow-up. A total of 70% of couples performed SI 60 months after nsRPx. In contrast to couples who did not have SI 60 months after nsRPx, couples who successfully had SI were more satisfied, had SI more often, had higher IIEF-5 scores, and higher frequency of bilateral ns surgery. In 80% of those patients, no medical aid except PDE-5 inhibitors were used. The partners of those patients were more satisfied with their sexual life, compared to the patients themselves.

An approach that scrutinizes every cancer focus is needed in order to generate a comprehensive evaluation of the disease, and by correlating to patients' clinico-pathological information, specific prognostic biomarker can be identified. Our study utilized the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Genome-wide assay to investigate forty-three fresh frozen PCa tissue foci from twenty-three patients. With a long clinical follow-up period that ranged from 2.0-9.7 (mean 5.4) years, copy number variation (CNV) data was evaluated for association with patients' PSA status during follow-up.

Furthermore, we hypothesize that the PAPSS2 gene (10q23.2-10q23.31) may be functionally relevant in post-operative PSA recurrence because of its reported role in androgen biosynthesis.

The DIR approach adopts a greedy seed selection (GSS) procedure to obtain a preliminary plan. In this process, the potential seeds are evaluated according to their ability to irradiate target while spare organs at risk (OARs), and their impact on dosimetric homogeneity within target volume. A flexible termination condition is developed for the GSS procedure, which guarantees sufficient dose within target volume while avoids overdosing the OARs. The preliminary treatment plan generated by the GSS procedure is further refined by the double iteration (DI) and rectification procedure. The DI procedure removes the needles containing only one seed (single seed) and implements the GSS procedure again to get a temporary plan. The DI procedure terminates until the needles number of the temporary plan does not decrease. This process is guided by constantly removing undesired part rather than imposing extra constrains. Following the DI procedure, the rectification procedure attempts to replace the remaining single seeds with the acceptable ones within the existing needles. The change of dosimetric distribution (DD) after the replacement is evaluated to determine whether to accept or to withdraw the replacement. Experimental results demonstrate that the treatment plans obtained by the DIR approach caters to all clinical considerations. Compared with currently available methods, DIR approach is faster, more reliable, and more suitable for intraoperative treatment planning in the operation room.""","""['Bin Liang', 'Fugen Zhou', 'Bo Liu', 'Junjie Wang', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Real-time intraoperative evaluation of implant quality and dose correction during prostate brachytherapy consistently improves target coverage using a novel image fusion and optimization program.', 'Treatment planning for prostate brachytherapy using region of interest adjoint functions and a greedy heuristic.', 'Class solution for inversely planned permanent prostate implants to mimic an experienced dosimetrist.', 'Review of intraoperative imaging and planning techniques in permanent seed prostate brachytherapy.', 'Low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: preplanning vs. intraoperative planning-intraoperative planning is best.']"""

However, the tie between plan integrity and traditional gamma-based analysis of these data are not clear. This study explores the sensitivity of such analysis by creating errors in Helical Tomotherapy delivery and measuring the passing rates with an ArcCHECK cylindrical diode array. Errors were introduced in each of the couch speed, leaf open time, and gantry starting position in increasing magnitude while the resulting gamma passing rates were tabulated. The error size required to degrade the gamma passing rate to 90% or below was on average a 3% change in couch speed, 5° in gantry synchronization, or a 5 ms in leaf closing speed for a 3%/3 mm Van Dyk gamma analysis. This varied with plan type, with prostate plans exhibiting less sensitivity than head and neck plans and with gamma analysis criteria, but in all cases the error magnitudes were large compared to actual machine tolerances.

The axial T1-weighted image with fat saturation post gadolinium (Gd), revealed diffuse strong enhancement in the vertebral body, the paraspinal soft tissue mass and the adjacent right rib. Circumferential epidural enhancement indicative of intra-canal spread of the infection, was also noticed. Additional MR sequences covered the level of the SCJ. Extensive subarticular and soft tissue changes with fluid collection and bone oedema of the left SCJ were shown with the typical pattern of diffuse enhancement suggestive of septic arthritis. The MR imaging findings combined with the scintigraphic findings were consistent with subacute multifocal septic arthritis involving the axial skeleton, as a pyogenic spondylodiscitis at the T9-T10 level, the left SCJ joint and the left knee joint. Subsequently, aspiration of the SCJ and the left knee joint was performed. A purulent fluid was drained and sent to microbiology. The sample revealed 96.000 cells/μL (95% neutrophils) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient received intravenous vancomucin (2gr. twice a day for 14 days) and subsequently the dose was adjusted to maintain the vancomucin serum levels between 17 and 20mcg/mL. The total treatment duration was 12 weeks. Four months later the patient had fully recovered and his blood tests were normal. The patient had not been referred to an oncology department yet, as the onset of the arthritis occurred about two weeks after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. In conclusion, we present a patient with known malignancy, fever, skeletal pain and multiple bone lesions in the (99m)Tc-MDP and the MRI examination, not due to metastatic disease but to septic arthritis.""","""['Evangelos Alexiou', 'Panagiotis Georgoulias', 'Varvara Valotassiou', 'Evangelia Georgiou', 'Ioannis Fezoulidis', 'Marianna Vlychou']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Hell J Nucl Med""","""['Nonspecific osteomyelitis in childhood and adolescence.

We hypothesize that genetic variants in the Wnt pathway effector, Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), may influence clinical outcomes in prostate cancer.  Methods:   We comprehensively selected 12 tagged single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to capture majority of common variants across TCF7L2, and genotyped in 458 localized prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazard model, and survival tree analyses were performed to identify significant SNPs that correlated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after surgery.  Results:   A higher-order SNP-SNP interaction profile consisting of TCF7L2 rs7094463, rs10749127, and rs11196224 was significantly associated with BCR (P trend = 0.001). After adjusting for possible confounders, the genetic profile remained significant (P trend = 0.007). None of the studied SNPs were individually associated with BCR.

Latent full-length PDGF-D (FL-D) consists of a CUB domain, a growth factor domain (GFD), and the hinge region in between. Matriptase processes the FL-D dimer into a GFD dimer (GFD-D) in a stepwise manner, involving generation of a hemidimer (HD), an intermediate product containing one FL-D subunit and one GFD subunit. Although the HD is a pro-growth factor that can be processed into the GFD-D by matriptase, the HD can also act as a dominant-negative ligand that prevents PDGF-B-mediated β-PDGF receptor activation in fibroblasts. The active GFD-D can be further cleaved into a smaller and yet inactive form if matriptase-mediated proteolysis persists. Through mutagenesis and functional analyses, we found that the R(340)R(341)GR(343)A (P4-P1/P1') motif within the GFD is the matriptase cleavage site through which matriptase can deactivate PDGF-D. Comparative sequence analysis based on the published crystal structure of PDGF-B predicted that the matriptase cleavage site R(340)R(341)GR(343)A is within loop III of the GFD, a critical structural element for its binding with the β-PDGF receptor. Interestingly, we also found that matriptase processing regulates the deposition of PDGF-D dimer species into the extracellular matrix (ECM) with increased binding from the FL-D dimer, to the HD, and to the GFD-D. Furthermore, we provide evidence that R(340)R(341)GR(343)A within the GFD is critical for PDGF-D deposition and binding to the ECM. In this study, we report a structural element crucial for the biological function and ECM deposition of PDGF-D and provide molecular insight into the dynamic functional interplay between the serine protease matriptase and PDGF-D.""","""['Wei Huang', 'Hyeong-Reh Choi Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['A novel signaling axis of matriptase/PDGF-D/ß-PDGFR in human prostate cancer.', 'Matriptase activation and shedding through PDGF-D-mediated extracellular acidosis.', 'Platelet-derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C) activation by serine proteases: implications for breast cancer progression.', 'Matriptase: potent proteolysis on the cell surface.', 'The role of small molecule platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitors in the treatment of neoplastic disorders.', 'The production of recombinant platelet-derived growth factor D using the second generation modified vaccinia Ankara viral system.', 'E3 ligase HUWE1 promotes PDGF D-mediated osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells by effecting polyubiquitination of β-PDGFR.', 'The HIF1α-PDGFD-PDGFRα axis controls glioblastoma growth at normoxia/mild-hypoxia and confers sensitivity to targeted therapy by echinomycin.', 'Rare variant analysis of 4241 pulmonary arterial hypertension cases from an international consortium implicates FBLN2, PDGFD, and rare de novo variants in PAH.', 'Cell surface-anchored serine proteases in cancer progression and metastasis.']"""

Antigen cross-presentation from tumor cells by dendritic cells (DC) is a likely dominant mechanism to achieve CD8(+) T-cell stimulation. We established a cross-presentation model in which DCs present a naturally expressed oncofetal tumor antigen (5T4) from irradiated DU145 prostate cancer cells to 5T4-specific T cells. The aim was to establish which immunogenic signals are important in radiation-induced cross-presentation. Radiation (12 Gy) caused G2-M cell-cycle arrest and cell death, increased cellular 5T4 levels, high-mobility protein group-B1 (HMGB1) release, and surface calreticulin and heat-shock protein-70 (Hsp70) expression in DU145 cells. DCs phagocytosed irradiated tumor cells efficiently, followed by upregulation of CD86 on phagocytic DCs. CD8(+) 5T4-specific T cells, stimulated with these DCs, proliferated and produced IFNγ. Inhibition of HMGB1 or the TRIF/MyD88 pathway only had a partial effect on T-cell stimulation. Unlike previous investigators, we found no evidence that DCs carrying Asp299Gly Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) single-nucleotide polymorphism had impaired ability to cross-present tumor antigen. However, pretreatment of tumor cells with Hsp70 inhibitors resulted in a highly statistically significant and robust prevention of antigen cross-presentation and CD86 upregulation on DCs cocultured with irradiated tumor cells. Blocking the Hsp70 receptor CD91 also abolished cross-presentation. Together, the results from our study demonstrate that irradiation induces immunologically relevant changes in tumor cells, which can trigger CD8(+) T-cell responses via a predominantly Hsp70-dependent antigen cross-presentation process.""","""['Josephine Salimu', 'Lisa K Spary', 'Saly Al-Taei', 'Aled Clayton', 'Malcolm D Mason', 'John Staffurth', 'Zsuzsanna Tabi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Res""","""['Post-apoptotic tumors are more palatable to dendritic cells and enhance their antigen cross-presentation activity.', 'Immunogenicity of 56 degrees C and UVC-treated prostate cancer is associated with release of HSP70 and HMGB1 from necrotic cells.', 'Human tumor cells killed by anthracyclines induce a tumor-specific immune response.', 'Immunogenic cancer cell death: a key-lock paradigm.', 'Heat shock protein 70: role in antigen presentation and immune stimulation.', 'Current Challenges and Opportunities of Photodynamic Therapy against Cancer.', 'Combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with radiation therapy in cancer: A hammer breaking the wall of resistance.', 'Activation of Cellular Players in Adaptive Immunity via Exogenous Delivery of Tumor Cell Lysates.', 'Reversing insufficient photothermal therapy-induced tumor relapse and metastasis by regulating cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Interaction Between Modern Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

Registration of anatomical structures between the site of beam entrance on the patient surface and the distal target position is particularly important. Here, to improve patient positional accuracy during set-up for particle beam treatment, we propose a new visualization methodology using digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), overlaid DRRs, and evaluation of overlaid DRR images in clinical cases. The overlaid method overlays two DRR images in different colors by dividing the CT image into two CT sections at the distal edge of the target along the treatment beam direction. Since our hospital uses fixed beam ports, the treatment beam angles for this study were set at 0 and 90 degrees. The DRR calculation direction was from the X-ray tube to the imaging device, and set to 180/270 degrees and 135/225 degrees, based on the installation of our X-ray imaging system. Original and overlaid DRRs were calculated using CT data for two patients, one with a parotid gland tumor and the other with prostate cancer. The original and overlaid DRR images were compared. Since the overlaid DRR image was completely separated into two regions when the DRR calculation angle was the same as the treatment beam angle, the overlaid DRR visualization technique was able to provide rich information for aiding recognition of the relationship between anatomical structures and the target position.

This study used pharmacokinetic modeling to validate the use of simplified methods for quantification of (18)F-fluoromethylcholine uptake in a routine clinical setting.  Methods:   Forty-minute dynamic PET/CT scans were acquired after injection of 204 ± 9 MBq of (18)F-fluoromethylcholine, from 8 patients with histologically proven metastasized prostate cancer. Plasma input functions were obtained using continuous arterial blood-sampling as well as using image-derived methods. Manual arterial blood samples were used for calibration and correction for plasma-to-blood ratio and metabolites. Time-activity curves were derived from volumes of interest in all visually detectable lymph node metastases. (18)F-fluoromethylcholine kinetics were studied by nonlinear regression fitting of several single- and 2-tissue plasma input models to the time-activity curves. Model selection was based on the Akaike information criterion and measures of robustness. In addition, the performance of several simplified methods, such as standardized uptake value (SUV), was assessed.  Results:   Best fits were obtained using an irreversible compartment model with blood volume parameter. Parent fractions were 0.12 ± 0.4 after 20 min, necessitating individual metabolite corrections. Correspondence between venous and arterial parent fractions was low as determined by the intraclass correlation coefficient (0.61). Results for image-derived input functions that were obtained from volumes of interest in blood-pool structures distant from tissues of high (18)F-fluoromethylcholine uptake yielded good correlation to those for the blood-sampling input functions (R(2) = 0.83). SUV showed poor correlation to parameters derived from full quantitative kinetic analysis (R(2) < 0.34). In contrast, lesion activity concentration normalized to the integral of the blood activity concentration over time (SUVAUC) showed good correlation (R(2) = 0.92 for metabolite-corrected plasma; 0.65 for whole-blood activity concentrations).  Conclusion:   SUV cannot be used to quantify (18)F-fluoromethylcholine uptake.

However, physicians have difficulty accurately estimating life expectancy.  Objective:   We used data from a population-based observational study to develop a nomogram to estimate long-term other-cause mortality based on self-reported health status (SRHS), race/ethnicity, and age at diagnosis.  Design:   This was an observational study.  Subjects:   Men diagnosed with localized PCa from October 1994 through October 1995 participated in the study.  Main measures:   Initial measures obtained 6 months after diagnosis included sociodemographic and tumor characteristics, treatment, and a single item on the SRHS, with response options ranging from excellent to poor. We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results program data to determine date and cause of death through December 2010. We estimated other-cause mortality with proportional hazards survival analyses, accounting for competing risks.  Key results:   We evaluated 2,695 men, of whom 74% underwent aggressive therapy (surgery or radiotherapy). At the initial survey, 18% reported excellent (E), 36% very good (VG), 31% good (G), and 15% fair/poor (F/P) health. Healthier men were younger, and more likely to be white, better educated, and to undergo surgery. At follow-up, 44% of the cohort had died; 78% of deaths were from causes other than PCa. SRHS predicted other-cause mortality; for men reporting E, VG, G, F/P health, the cumulative incidences of other-cause mortality were 20%, 29%, 40%, and 53%, respectively, p < 0.001. Compared to a reference of excellent SRHS, multivariable hazard ratios (95% CI) for other-cause mortality for men reporting VG, G, and F/P health were 1.22 (0.97-1.54), 1.73 (1.38-2.17), and 2.71 (2.11-3.48), respectively.  Conclusions:   Responses to a one-item SRHS measure were strongly associated with other-cause mortality 15 years after PCa diagnosis. Men reporting fair/poor health had substantial risks for other-cause mortality, suggesting limited benefit for undergoing aggressive treatment.

The goal of the current study was to assess, separately in patients with breast and prostate cancer, the effect of adjuvant treatments on the evolution of insomnia symptoms and the mediating role of somatic symptoms.  Methods:   As part of a population-based epidemiological study, patients with breast cancer (465 patients) and prostate cancer (263 patients) completed at baseline (perioperative period) and 2 months, 6 months, 10 months, 14 months, and 18 months later the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and a questionnaire assessing various somatic symptoms.  Results:   In patients with breast cancer, radiotherapy (overall effect) and chemotherapy (at 2 months), but not hormone therapy, were associated with increased insomnia severity, whereas androgen deprivation therapy was related to increased insomnia in patients with prostate cancer. In patients with breast cancer, the effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on insomnia was found to be significantly mediated by a variety of somatic symptoms, whereas night sweats had a particularly marked mediating role for hormone therapy, both in patients with breast and prostate cancer.

Our aim was to assess TRT experience and patient management among urologists in Bavaria.  Materials and methods:   Questionnaires were developed and mailed to all registered urologists in Bavaria (n = 420) regarding their experience with TRT in patients with treated PCa.  Results:   One hundred and ninety-three (46%) urologists returned the questionnaire and reported their experience with TRT in hypogonadal patients after curative treatment for PCa. Complete data was available for 32 men. Twenty-six patients (81%) received TRT after prostatectomy, 1 patient after external beam radiation, 3 patients after high-dose brachytherapy and 2 patients after high-intensity focused ultrasound. Of the PCa cases, 88.5% (23/26) were organ confined (pT2a-c), and 3 were pT3 tumors. All patients were pN0/cN0, and only 1 patient (pT3a) had a positive surgical margin status postoperatively. After a mean follow-up of 39.8 months, no biochemical relapse was observed.  Conclusion:   To date, there is no clear evidence to withhold TRT from hypogonadal men after curative PCa treatment.

To investigate the effects of TET on the suppression of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of migration and invasion in human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC-3. Inhibition of growth was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and clone formation assay, and flow cytometry analysis was performed to detect the induction of apoptosis. Activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, caspase-3, Akt, phospho-Akt, Bcl-2, and Bax was analyzed by Western blotting. Wound healing assay and transwell migration assay were used to evaluate the effect of TET on migration and invasion of cancer cells. TET inhibited the growth of DU145 and PC-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell cloning was inhibited in the presence of TET in DU145 and PC-3 cells. TET suppressed the migration of DU145 and PC-3 cells. Transwell invasion assay showed that TET significantly weakened invasion capacity of DU145 and PC-3 cells. TET exhibited strong inhibitory effect on proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells. In addition, TET induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by activating the caspase cascade and inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signal pathway.

In its early stages, primary tumor growth is dependent on androgens, thus generally can be controlled by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Eventually however, the disease progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a lethal form in need of more effective treatments. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large clan of cell surface proteins that have been implicated as therapeutic targets in PCa growth and progression. The findings reported here provide intriguing evidence of a role for the newly characterized glutamate family member GPR158 in PCa growth and progression. We found that GPR158 promotes PCa cell proliferation independent of androgen receptor (AR) functionality and that this requires its localization in the nucleus of the cell. This suggests that GPR158 acts by mechanisms different from other GPCRs. GPR158 expression is stimulated by androgens and GPR158 stimulates AR expression, implying a potential to sensitize tumors to low androgen conditions during ADT via a positive feedback loop. Further, we found GPR158 expression correlates with a neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation phenotype and promotes anchorage-independent colony formation implying a role for GPR158 in therapeutic progression and tumor formation. GPR158 expression was increased at the invading front of prostate tumors that formed in the genetically defined conditional Pten knockout mouse model, and co-localized with elevated AR expression in the cell nucleus. Kaplan-Meier analysis on a dataset from the Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer genome portal showed that increased GPR158 expression in tumors is associated with lower disease-free survival.

Moreover, a prediction of number of cancer patients requiring active antitumor therapy is also an important issue. This paper presents the stage-specific predictions of cancer incidence and prevalence, and the stage- and region-specific patients requiring active antitumor therapy for the most common cancer diagnoses in the Czech Republic for years 2015 and 2020. The stage-specific estimates are also presented with regard to the treatment phase as newly diagnosed patients, patients treated for non-terminal recurrence, and patients treated for terminal recurrence.  Patients and methods:   Data of the Czech National Cancer Registry from 1977 to 2011 has been used for the analysis, omitting the records of patients diagnosed as death certificate only or at autopsy. In total, 1,777,775 incidences have been considered for the estimation using a statistical model utilizing solely the population-based cancer registry data. All estimates have been calculated with respect to the changing demographic structure of the Czech population and the clinical stage at diagnosis.  Results:   Considering year 2011 as the baseline, we predict 89%, 15%, 31% and 32% increase in prostate, colorectal, female breast and lung cancer incidence, respectively, in 2020 resulting in 13,153, 9,368, 8,695, and 8,604 newly dia-g--nosed cancer patients in that year, respectively. Regarding cancer prevalence in 2020, the estimated increase is 140%, 40%, 51%, and 17% for prostate, colorectal, female breast and lung cancer, respectively, meaning that more than 100,000 prevalent female breast cancer patients as well as more than 100,000 prevalent prostate cancer patients are expected in the Czech Republic. The estimated numbers of patients requiring active antitumor therapy for prostate, colorectal, female breast and lung cancer in the Czech Republic in 2020 are 23,652, 14,006, 14,759 and 8,272; respectively.  Conclusions:   The analysis documents a serious increase in cancer incidence and prevalence in the Czech Republic in years 2015 and 2020 when compared to the situation in 2011.

The systemic intravenous administration of the complex (siRNA, 50 μg/shot) significantly reduced Bcl-xL expression and induced apoptosis in the tumors, and suppressed their growth. Liver metastasis was also inhibited in the orthotopic model. We successfully showed tumor-specific accumulation of the siRNA by Cy3-labeled siRNA and the direct quantification of the siRNA via reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The tumor-specific delivery was achieved by the enhanced permeability and retention effect, which is characteristic of macromolecular drugs.

After treatment with EET externalization of phosphatidyl serine (PS) from the inner membrane to outer leaflet of the plasma membrane was clearly evidenced by the results obtained from both flow cytometry analysis with Annexin V-FITC and pSIVA-IANBD binding fluorescence microscopy assay. Depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential was also evidenced by the presence of 5,5',6,6'-tetrachlolo-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl benzimedazolyl carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) monomeric form in the EET-treated cells that emitted the green fluorescence when compared with the control cells that emitted the red fluorescence due to aggregation of JC-1. Furthermore, the level of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and Bcl-2 were determined using western blot analysis. When compared to the control cells the level of cleaved PARP was found to be higher with a concomitant decrease in the Bcl-2 level after 24 h of treatment of cells with EET. In addition, treatment with EET significantly elevated the activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in LNCaP cells compared with the control. Also, after 48 h of treatment all doses used in this study showed clear fragments of DNA, which is one of the hallmarks of apoptosis.

These studies compared the novel taxane cabazitaxel with the previous generation docetaxel, and aimed to determine which tumors are most likely to respond.  Experimental design:   Cabazitaxel and docetaxel were compared via in vitro modeling to determine the molecular mechanism, biochemical and cell biologic impact, and cell proliferation, which was further assessed ex vivo in human tumor explants. Isogenic pairs of RB knockdown and control cells were interrogated in vitro and in xenograft tumors for cabazitaxel response.  Results:   The data herein show that (i) cabazitaxel exerts stronger cytostatic and cytotoxic response compared with docetaxel, especially in CRPC; (ii) cabazitaxel induces aberrant mitosis, leading to pyknotic and multinucleated cells; (iii) taxanes do not act through the androgen receptor (AR); (iv) gene-expression profiling reveals distinct molecular actions for cabazitaxel; and (v) tumors that have progressed to castration resistance via loss of RB show enhanced sensitivity to cabazitaxel.  Conclusions:   Cabazitaxel not only induces improved cytostatic and cytotoxic effects, but also affects distinct molecular pathways, compared with docetaxel, which could underlie its efficacy after docetaxel treatment has failed in patients with CRPC. Finally, RB is identified as the first potential biomarker that could define the therapeutic response to taxanes in metastatic CRPC. This would suggest that loss of RB function induces sensitization to taxanes, which could benefit up to 50% of CRPC cases.""","""['Renée de Leeuw', 'Lisa D Berman-Booty', 'Matthew J Schiewer', 'Stephen J Ciment', 'Robert B Den', 'Adam P Dicker', 'William K Kelly', 'Edouard J Trabulsi', 'Costas D Lallas', 'Leonard G Gomella', 'Karen E Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Cabazitaxel regimens inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and enhances the anti-tumor properties of PEDF with various efficacy and toxicity.', 'Preclinical profile of cabazitaxel.', 'ERG induces taxane resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgens modify therapeutic response to cabazitaxel in models of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Crosstalk between Microtubule Stabilizing Agents and Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibition of Mps1 kinase enhances taxanes efficacy in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Prognostic factors in Japanese men with high-Gleason metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Bone Health Management in the Continuum of Prostate Cancer Disease.']"""

Here, we report the prespecified final analysis of this randomized trial.  Patients and methods:   NCIC Clinical Trials Group PR.3/Medical Research Council PR07/Intergroup T94-0110 was a randomized controlled trial of patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. Patients with T3-4, N0/Nx, M0 prostate cancer or T1-2 disease with either prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of more than 40 μg/L or PSA of 20 to 40 μg/L plus Gleason score of 8 to 10 were randomly assigned to lifelong ADT alone or to ADT+RT. The RT dose was 64 to 69 Gy in 35 to 39 fractions to the prostate and pelvis or prostate alone. Overall survival was compared using a log-rank test stratified for prespecified variables.  Results:   One thousand two hundred five patients were randomly assigned between 1995 and 2005, 602 to ADT alone and 603 to ADT+RT. At a median follow-up time of 8 years, 465 patients had died, including 199 patients from prostate cancer. Overall survival was significantly improved in the patients allocated to ADT+RT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.85; P < .001). Deaths from prostate cancer were significantly reduced by the addition of RT to ADT (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61; P < .001). Patients on ADT+RT reported a higher frequency of adverse events related to bowel toxicity, but only two of 589 patients had grade 3 or greater diarrhea at 24 months after RT.  Conclusion:   This analysis demonstrates that the previously reported benefit in survival is maintained at a median follow-up of 8 years and firmly establishes the role of RT in the treatment of men with locally advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Malcolm D Mason', 'Wendy R Parulekar', 'Matthew R Sydes', 'Michael Brundage', 'Peter Kirkbride', 'Mary Gospodarowicz', 'Richard Cowan', 'Edmund C Kostashuk', 'John Anderson', 'Gregory Swanson', 'Mahesh K B Parmar', 'Charles Hayter', 'Gordana Jovic', 'Andrea Hiltz', 'John Hetherington', 'Jinka Sathya', 'James B P Barber', 'Michael McKenzie', 'Salah El-Sharkawi', 'Luis Souhami', 'P D John Hardman', 'Bingshu E Chen', 'Padraig Warde']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Short-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy versus intermediate-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy, with or without zoledronic acid, in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (TROG 03.04 RADAR): 10-year results from a randomised, phase 3, factorial trial.', 'Short-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy versus intermediate-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy, with or without zoledronic acid, in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (TROG 03.04 RADAR): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 factorial trial.', 'Abiraterone acetate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy compared to androgen deprivation therapy only for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The use of Hormonal Therapy to Augment Radiation Therapy in Prostate Cancer: An Update.', 'Neoadjuvant versus Concurrent Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Localized Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'LncFALEC recruits ART5/PARP1 and promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer through enhancing PARP1-meditated self PARylation.', 'Second generation anti-androgens and androgen deprivation therapy with radiation therapy in the definitive management of high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Combining androgen deprivation and radiation therapy in the treatment of localised prostate cancer: Summary of level 1 evidence and current gaps in knowledge.', 'Long-Term Medical Resource Consumption of Radical Prostatectomy vs. Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Old Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.']"""

In this study, we demonstrate cell-cycle-dependent regulation of AR activity, localization, and phosphorylation. We show that for three AR-target genes, androgen-stimulated AR transactivation is highest during the G1 phase, decreased during S-phase, and abrogated during G2/M. This change in AR transactivation parallels changes in AR localization and phosphorylation. A combination of imaging techniques and quantitative analysis reveals nuclear AR localization during interphase and the exclusion of the majority, but not all, AR from chromatin during mitosis. Flow cytometry analyses using a phospho-S308 AR-specific antibody in asynchronous and chemically enriched G2/M PCa cells revealed ligand-independent induction of S308 phosphorylation in mitosis when CDK1 is activated. Consistent with our flow cytometry data, IP-western blotting revealed an increase in S308 phosphorylation in G2/M, and the results of an in vitro kinase assay indicated that CDK1 was able to phosphorylate the AR on S308. Pharmacological inhibition of CDK1 activity resulted in decreased S308 phosphorylation in PCa cells. Importantly, using a combination of anti-total AR and phospho-S308-specific antibodies in immunofluorescence experiments, we showed that the AR is excluded from condensed chromatin in mitotic cells when it was phosphorylated on S308. In summary, we show that the phosphorylation of the AR on S308 by CDK1 during mitosis regulates AR localization and correlates with changes in AR transcriptional activity.

We have recruited 192 PCa patients and 225 cancer-free ages matched unrelated healthy control of similar ethnicity. They were genotyped for DR4, 141 (G > A), 209 (C > G), and 228 (A > C) polymorphisms using amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) method. Variant genotype AA (OR = 2.54; p = 0.007) and A allele (OR = 1.51; p = 0.015) of DR4 141 demonstrated significant increased risk for PCa. Similarly, variant genotype GG (OR = 2.58; p = 0.003) and G allele carrier (CG + GG) (OR = 1.50; p = 0.043) of DR4 209 conferred increased risk. G allele (OR = 1.50, p = 0.005) was also statistically associated with PCa risk. High risk for PCa was also observed with respect to haplotypes A-G-A (OR = 2.86; Bonferroni correction Pc = 0.008) and A-G-C (OR = 3.18, Pc = 0.008). We observed significantly enhanced risk for PCa due to interaction between DR4 209 and 228 gene polymorphisms. Furthermore, a significantly increased risk of high Gleason grade tumor was found in the combined variant allele carrier (GA + AA) of DR4 141 compared with the GG genotype (OR = 2.27, Pc = 0.052).

We hypothesized that a comprehensive analysis of genetic variations found within the 3' untranslated region of genes predicted to affect miRNA binding (miRSNP) can identify additional prostate cancer risk variants. We investigated the association between 2,169 miRSNPs and prostate cancer risk in a large-scale analysis of 22,301 cases and 22,320 controls of European ancestry from 23 participating studies. Twenty-two miRSNPs were associated (P<2.3×10(-5)) with risk of prostate cancer, 10 of which were within 7 genes previously not mapped by GWAS studies. Further, using miRNA mimics and reporter gene assays, we showed that miR-3162-5p has specific affinity for the KLK3 rs1058205 miRSNP T-allele, whereas miR-370 has greater affinity for the VAMP8 rs1010 miRSNP A-allele, validating their functional role.

The purpose of the current study was to characterize suicide rates among patients with genitourinary cancers and identify factors associated with suicide in this specific cohort.  Methods:   Patients with prostate, bladder, kidney, testis, and penile cancer were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1988-2010). Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for each anatomic site. Multivariable logistic regression models generated odds ratios (ORs) for the identification of factors associated with suicide for each malignancy.  Results:   There were 2268 suicides identified among 1,239,522 individuals with genitourinary malignancies observed for 7,307,377 person-years. The SMRs for patients with cancer were 1.37 for prostate cancer (95% CI, 0.99-1.86), 2.71 for bladder cancer (95% CI, 2.02-3.62), 1.86 for kidney cancer (95% CI, 1.32-2.62), 1.23 for testis cancer (95% CI, 0.88-1.73), and 0.95 for penile cancer (95% CI, 0.65-1.35). On multivariable analysis, male sex was found to be associated with odds of suicide among patients with bladder cancer (OR, 6.63) and kidney cancer (OR, 4.98). Increasing age was associated with suicide for patients with prostate, bladder, and testis cancer (OR range, 1.03-1.06). Distant disease was associated with suicide in patients with prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer (OR range, 2.82-5.43). Among patients with prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer, African American patients were less likely to commit suicide compared with white individuals (OR range, 0.26-0.46).

An unequal distribution across units of analysis might entail extra-variation and produce misleading conclusions on healthcare performance variations. This article aims at assessing the impact of building more homogeneous units of analysis in the estimation of systematic variation in three countries.  Methods:   Hospital discharges for six conditions (congestive heart failure, short-term complications of diabetes, hip fracture, knee replacement, prostatectomy in prostate cancer and percutaneous coronary intervention) produced in Denmark, England and Portugal in 2008 and 2009 were allocated to both original geographical units and new ad hoc areas. New areas were built using Ward's minimum variance methods. The impact of the new areas on variability was assessed using Kernel distribution curves and different statistic of variation such as Extremal Quotient, Interquartile Interval ratio, Systematic Component of Variation and Empirical Bayes statistic.  Results:   Ward's method reduced the number of areas, allowing a more homogeneous population distribution, yet 20% of the areas in Portugal exhibited less than 100 000 inhabitants vs. 7% in Denmark and 5% in England. Point estimates for Extremal Quotient and Interquartile Interval Ratio were lower in the three countries, particularly in less prevalent conditions. In turn, the Systematic Component of Variation and Empirical Bayes statistic were slightly lower in more prevalent conditions.  Conclusions:   Building new geographical areas produced a reduction of the variation in hospitalization rates in several prevalent conditions mitigating random noise, particularly in the smallest areas and allowing a sounder interpretation of the variation across countries.""","""['Lau C Thygesen', 'Cristobal Baixauli-Pérez', 'Julián Librero-López', 'Natalia Martínez-Lizaga', 'Manuel Ridao-López', 'Enrique Bernal-Delgado;ECHO Consortium']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur J Public Health""","""['Potentially avoidable hospitalizations in five European countries in 2009 and time trends from 2002 to 2009 based on administrative data.', 'The extremal quotient in small-area variation analysis.', 'Potential of geographical variation analysis for realigning providers to value-based care.

Recently, side-specific NS have been more frequently performed, but previous NS grading system might not reflect the differential NS in each side.  Aim:   Herein, we assessed whether a subjective NS score (NSS) incorporating both degree of NS and NS laterality can predict the time to potency recovery following RARP.  Methods:   Data were analyzed from 1,898 patients who had left and right neurovascular bundle sparing quality scores and at least one year of follow-up after RARP was performed between January 2008 and October 2011.  Main outcome measures:   Cox proportional hazard method analyses were used to determine predictive factors for early recovery. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess subjective NSS in an effort to predict time to potency recovery. Subjective NSSs were compared to a model based on the three grades according to laterality and degree.  Results:   Time to potency recovery showed a statistically significant difference in favor of higher NSS by the Cox proportional hazard regression analysis (NSS 0 vs. NSS 5-6, 7-8, and 9-10; P < 0.01). The regression model indicated that the statistical significance of the subjective NSS covering the differential NS is not different from that of the conventional three-grade scales, while it has a higher R(2). The regression equation with subjective NSS was as follows: Log (Time) = 5.163 - (0.035 × SHIM Score) + 0.028 Age - (0.101 × Subjective NSS).  Conclusion:   The subjective NSS can reflect NS degree for each side based on the visual cues. Regression model can be used to help inform the patient about the time to postoperative potency regain, which is an important patient concern following RARP.""","""['Sung Gu Kang', 'Oscar Schatloff', 'Abdul Muhsin Haidar', 'Srinivas Samavedi', 'Kenneth J Palmer', 'Jun Cheon', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Commentary on: Does Surgeon Subjective Nerve Sparing Score Predict Recovery Time of Erectile Function Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy?', 'Anatomic grading of nerve sparing during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Pathological confirmation of nerve-sparing types performed during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Stepwise approach for nerve sparing without countertraction during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: technique and outcomes.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting potency rates after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Association of nerve-sparing grading in robotic radical prostatectomy and trifecta outcome.', 'Efficacy of Tadalafil in Penile Rehabilitation Started Before Nerve-Sparing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Double-Blind Pilot Study.', 'Toggling Technique Allows Retrograde Early Release to Facilitate Neurovascular Bundle Sparing During Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Propensity Score-Matching Study.', 'Width of spared neurovascular bundle after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer: is it a reliable factor for predicting postoperative sexual outcome?', 'Lessons learned from 12,000 robotic radical prostatectomies: Is the journey as important as the outcome?']"""

The presence of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which induces metabolic stress and autophagy, enhanced the antiproliferative effects of WP631. Changes induced by WP631, 2-DG, or co-treatments with both compounds, in the expression of a variety of genes involved in autophagy and apoptosis were quantified by real-time PCR. They were consistent with a raise in autophagy followed by cell death. Some cells dying from G2/M phase showed features of necrosis like early changes in membrane permeability, while others were dying by apoptosis that occurred in presence of little caspase-3 activity. Our results indicate that WP631 is not only an antiproliferative agent acting on gene transcription, but it can also induce autophagy regardless of the presence of other pro-autophagy stimuli.

Results:   Of 36 984 patients, 15 870 (42.9%) underwent surgery alone, 4519 (12.2%) underwent surgery followed by radiotherapy, and 16 595 (44.9%) underwent radiotherapy alone.

The goal was to advance early detection cancer research by considering how the infrastructure of cohort studies that already exist or are being developed might be leveraged to include appropriate blood specimens, including prediagnostic specimens, ideally collected at periodic intervals, along with clinical data about symptom status and cancer diagnosis. Three overarching recommendations emerged from the discussions: 1) facilitate sharing of existing specimens and data, 2) encourage collaboration among scientists developing biomarkers and those conducting observational cohort studies or managing healthcare systems with cohorts followed over time, and 3) conduct pilot projects that identify and address key logistic and feasibility issues regarding how appropriate specimens and clinical data might be collected at reasonable effort and cost within existing or future cohorts.""","""['Sheri D Schully', 'Danielle M Carrick', 'Leah E Mechanic', 'Sudhir Srivastava', 'Garnet L Anderson', 'John A Baron', 'Christine D Berg', 'Jennifer Cullen', 'Eleftherios P Diamandis', 'V Paul Doria-Rose', 'Katrina A B Goddard', 'Susan E Hankinson', 'Lawrence H Kushi', 'Eric B Larson', 'Lisa M McShane', 'Richard L Schilsky', 'Steven Shak', 'Steven J Skates', 'Nicole Urban', 'Barnett S Kramer', 'Muin J Khoury', 'David F Ransohoff']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['RE: Leveraging Biospecimen Resources for Discovery or Validation of Markers for Early Cancer Detection.', 'RE: Leveraging Biospecimen Resources for Discovery or Validation of Markers for Early Cancer Detection.', 'The PLCO Biorepository: Creating, Maintaining, and Administering a Unique Biospecimen Resource.', 'The NCI All Ireland Cancer Conference.', 'Executive Summary of the National Cancer Institute Workshop: Highlights and recommendations.', 'Strategic approach to validating methylated genes as biomarkers for breast cancer.', 'Lack of predictive tools for conventional and targeted cancer therapy: Barriers to biomarker development and clinical translation.', 'Challenges and Opportunities in Clinical Applications of Blood-Based Proteomics in Cancer.', 'Use of big data in drug development for precision medicine: an update.', 'Adding the Team into T1 Translational Research: A Case Study of Multidisciplinary Team Science in the Evaluation of Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer Risk and Prognosis.', 'Brain tumor biobanking in the precision medicine era: building a high-quality resource for translational research in neuro-oncology.']"""

It exists in biosamples at low levels; therefore, sensitive methods are necessary for its detection. In this study, we developed a sensitive and selective method for the analysis of sarcosine, based on derivatizing sarcosine with a fluorescent reagent levofloxacin acyl chloride. The resulting derivative is highly responsive to a fluorimetric detector (λex = 290 nm, λem = 460 nm). The sarcosine derivative can be separated from its molecular isomers (α-l-alanine, α-d-alanine and β-alanine) on a hexyl-phenyl column by gradient elution using sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.8; 50 mM) and tetrahydrofuran as the mobile phase.

A phase 2 study of enzalutamide monotherapy in patients with hormone-naïve prostate cancer (HNPC) showed a high response rate for the prespecified primary endpoint (ie, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] response at week 25), regardless of metastases at baseline, and favorable tolerability.  Objective:   To determine the long-term efficacy and safety of enzalutamide monotherapy at 1 and 2 yr.  Design, setting, and participants:   Open-label, single-arm study in patients with HNPC and noncastrate testosterone (≥230 ng/dl).  Intervention:   Oral enzalutamide 160mg/d until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Outcome measurements and analysis:   PSA response (≥80% decline from baseline) assessed at 1 yr (49 wk) and 2 yr (97 wk).  Results and limitations:   The median (range) age was 73 (48-86) yr and 26 patients (39%) presented with metastases at study entry. Of 67 patients enrolled, 45 (67%) remained on enzalutamide at week 97. For patients remaining on therapy, the PSA response rate at week 97 was 100% (95% confidence interval 92-100%). Of 26 patients with metastases at baseline, 13 (50%) had a complete and four (15.4%) had a partial response as best overall tumor response up to 97 wk on treatment. There was overall maintenance of total-body bone mineral density (BMD) and moderate changes in lean and fat body mass at 49 and 97 wk. The most common adverse events were gynecomastia, nipple pain, fatigue, and hot flushes. The study limitations include lack of a control group and of endocrine, glycemic, and lipid data at 97 wk.  Conclusions:   Long-term enzalutamide monotherapy in men with noncastrate HNPC is associated with large sustained reductions in PSA, signals indicating a favorable tumor response, and favorable safety/tolerability profile, with relatively small negative effects on total-body BMD.  Patient summary:   In this long-term follow-up of the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide monotherapy in patients with hormone-naïve prostate cancer, enzalutamide maintained long-term reductions in prostate-specific antigen, with a minimal impact on total-body bone mineral density.

Materials and methods:   The study was carried out on 14 young uveal melanoma patients (average age 21.4 years, range 3 months to 29 years). Germline DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. BAP1 sequencing was carried out using direct sequencing of all exons and adjacent intronic sequences. We also tested for germline mutations in additional melanoma-associated candidate genes CDKN2A and CDK4 (exon 4).  Results:   We identified one patient with a pathogenic mutation (c. 1717delC, p.L573fs*3) in BAP1. This patient was diagnosed with UM at age 18 years and had a family history of a father with UM and a paternal grandfather with cancer of unknown origin. One additional patient had an intronic variant of uncertain significance (c.123-48T > G) in BAP1 while the remaining 12 patients had no alteration. None of the patients had CDKN2A or CDK4 (Exon 4) mutations. Family history was positive for a number of additional malignancies in this series, in particular for cutaneous melanoma, prostate, breast and colon cancers. There were no families with a history of mesothelioma or renal cell carcinoma.  Conclusions:   This study suggests that a small subset of patients with early onset UM has germline mutation in BAP1. While young patients with UM should be screened for germline BAP1 mutations, our results suggest that there is a need to identify other candidate genes which are responsible for UM in young patients.""","""['Colleen M Cebulla', 'Elaine M Binkley', 'Robert Pilarski', 'James B Massengill', 'Karan Rai', 'David A Liebner', 'Meghan J Marino', 'Arun D Singh', 'Mohamed H Abdel-Rahman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Ophthalmic Genet""","""['Comparison of Germline versus Somatic BAP1 Mutations for Risk of Metastasis in Uveal Melanoma.', 'Germline BAP1 alterations in familial uveal melanoma.', 'BAP1 Germline Mutations in Finnish Patients with Uveal Melanoma.', 'Further evidence for germline BAP1 mutations predisposing to melanoma and malignant mesothelioma.', 'Genotypic and Phenotypic Features of BAP1 Cancer Syndrome: A Report of 8 New Families and Review of Cases in the Literature.', 'Two unique BAP1 pathogenic variants identified in the same family by panel cascade testing.', 'Is Uveal Melanoma a Hormonally Sensitive Cancer?

An Inner-Volume Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill imaging sequence that required 2.8 minutes to obtain data for quantitative T2 mapping covering the entire prostate gland was added to the routine multiparametric protocol. Suspected cancer (SC) and suspected healthy (SH) tissue in the peripheral zone were identified in consensus by three radiologists and were correlated with available biopsy results. Differences in mean T2 values in SC and SH regions-of-interest (ROIs) were tested for significance using unpaired Student's two-tailed t-test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the optimal threshold T2 value for cancer discrimination.  Results:   ROI analyses revealed significantly (p<0.0001) shorter T2 values in SC (85.4±12.3ms) compared to SH (169.6±38.7ms).

We previously showed that PN1-uPA complexes inhibited Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signalling through engagement of the LRP receptor. Here, we describe an alternative anti-proliferative mechanism through which PN1 expression leads to apoptosis. In prostate cancer cells, increased expression of PN1 led to substantial reduction of XIAP levels and apoptosis mediated through the uPAR, but not the LRP receptor. The alterations in XIAP were effected in two ways 1) via alteration in the NF-κB pathway, a pathway known to signal XIAP transcription and 2) by promoting XIAP instability. The AKT pathway is known to phosphorylate XIAP at serine 87 leading to protein stability and PN1 expression is shown to interfere with this process. As a result of both mechanisms, programmed cell death is substantially increased. Consistent with these observations, reduced PN1 protein correlated with elevated p65/XIAP expression and with higher Gleason scores in human prostate tissue arrays. Thus, PN1 expression appears to differentially down-regulate distinct oncogenic pathways depending upon the cell surface receptor engaged by its complexes and demonstrates a novel molecular mechanism by which the protein can promote tumor cell apoptosis.""","""['Chad M McKee', 'Yunchuan Ding', 'Jianfeng Zhou', 'Chunrui Li', 'Liang Huang', 'Xiangke Xin', 'Jing He', 'Joshua E Allen', 'Wafik S El-Deiry', 'Yunhong Cao', 'Ruth J Muschel', 'Danmei Xu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Chetomin induces degradation of XIAP and enhances TRAIL sensitivity in urogenital cancer cells.', 'Urokinase mediates endothelial cell survival via induction of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein.', 'Preclinical characterization of AEG35156/GEM 640, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide targeting X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis.', ""Acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone) exhibits in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity through the suppression of NF-κB/Akt signaling in prostate cancer cells."", 'Protease nexin 1 inhibits hedgehog signaling in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Transcriptomic profiling analysis of human endometrial stromal cells treated with autologous platelet-rich plasma.', 'Endocytosis of Peptidase Inhibitor SerpinE2 promotes Myocardial Fibrosis through activating ERK1/2 and β-catenin Signaling Pathways.', 'SERPINE2 Overexpression Is Associated with Poor Prognosis of Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'SERPINE2 is an oral cancer-promoting factor that induces angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.', 'Fibrinolytic Serine Proteases, Therapeutic Serpins and Inflammation: Fire Dancers and Firestorms.']"""

Combined into a diagnostic panel, 11 EPCATs classified 80% of PCa samples correctly, while maintaining 100% specificity.

The metastasis-suppressor genes, Nm23-H1 and KISS1, were up-regulated, while the pluripotency genes SOX2, NOTCH1, CD44v6, WWTR1/TAZ and YAP1 were dramatically down-regulated. Over-expression of SNAI2 in DU145 cells substantiated its ability to regulate metastasis-suppressor, NED and pluripotency genes. In PCa and lymph node metastasis, expression of SOX2 and NOTCH1 was highly related to that of SNAI2.In conclusion, I. SNAI2 silencing in PCa may turn-off the expression of NED markers and pluripotency genes, while turning-on that of specific metastasis-suppressors, II.

We sought to determine whether baseline prostate specific antigen could reliably predict subsequent risk of prostate cancer and risk of consequential prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A multiethnic cohort of 2,923 prostate cancer-free men was recruited between 2000 and 2012, and followed for a median of 7.5 years. Baseline prostate specific antigen was stratified into 6 strata and relative hazards of prostate cancer detection for each prostate specific antigen stratum were estimated, adjusting for ethnicity, family history and age.  Results:   During followup 289 patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Men with baseline prostate specific antigen in the lowest stratum (0.1 to 1.0 ng/ml) were at greatly reduced risk for prostate cancer during followup. This half of the cohort with prostate specific antigen 1.0 ng/ml or less were at 3.4% (95% CI 2.1, 4.5) 10-year risk of prostate cancer and 90% of the cancers were low risk. By comparison the other half were at 15% to 39% risk of cancer detection with a 39% risk in the highest stratum (3 to 10 ng/ml).  Conclusions:   Optimal prostate specific antigen screening frequency for men with a prostate specific antigen level of 0.1 to 1.0 ng/ml may be up to every 10 years. This approach has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of screening, decreasing over detection of inconsequential tumors, while maintaining detection of tumors for which treatment has been proven to reduce prostate cancer mortality.""","""['Jonathan Gelfond', 'Kara Choate', 'Donna P Ankerst', 'Javier Hernandez', 'Robin J Leach', 'Ian M Thompson Jr']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Risk of prostate cancer for young men with a prostate specific antigen less than their age specific median.', 'Cumulative risk of developing prostate cancer in men with low (≤ 2.0 ng/mL) prostate-specific antigen levels: a population-based screening cohort study in Japan.', 'Prostate specific antigen changes as related to the initial prostate specific antigen: data from the prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial.', 'A framework for the identification of men at increased risk for prostate cancer.', 'Baseline prostate-specific antigen testing at a young age.', 'UPDATE - 2022 Canadian Urological Association recommendations on prostate cancer screening and early diagnosis Endorsement of the 2021 Cancer Care Ontario guidelines on prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Prediction of future risk of any and higher-grade prostate cancer based on the PLCO and SELECT trials.', 'Prostate cancer.', 'Lifetime Benefits and Harms of Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based\xa0Risk-Stratified Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Gene‒Prostate-Specific-Antigen-Guided Personalized Screening for Prostate Cancer.']"""

IR-780 iodide, a lipophilic dye, accumulates selectively in breast cancer cells and drug-resistant human lung cancer cells, with a peak emission at 780 nm that can be easily detected by the NIRF imaging system. The application of IR-780 for prostate cancer imaging was thoroughly investigated to further expand its clinical value.  Material and methods:   The impact of IR-780 on the survival of prostate cancer cells PC-3 and LNCaP as well as normal prostate epithelial cells RWPE-1 was determined. Duration of IR-780 dye staining was optimized in PC-3 cells. The involvement of specific OATP1B3 inhibitor in the selective accumulation of IR-780 was investigated. IR-780 for prostate cancer imaging was carried out in athymic nude mouse models and, acute toxicity of IR-780 was evaluated.  Results:   IR-780 incubation resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition to cell proliferation. Mean fluorescence intensity of prostate cancer cells peaked at 20-min IR-780 incubation. Specific uptake of IR-780 dye in prostate cancer cells was mainly through the function of OATP1B3. We also demonstrated that NIRF dye effectively identified the subcutaneous prostate cancer xenografts, subsequently confirmed by histological examination. There was no significant impact on the physical activity, weight, and tissue histology of BABL/C mice with 10-fold imaging dose of 1-month IR-780 dye administration.  Conclusions:   NIRF imaging using IR-780 dye is a feasible and practicable method for prostate cancer detection, with potential tumor-killing ability, although more investigations are needed before clinical translation.""","""['Xiaomin Yi', 'Fei Yan', 'Fuli Wang', 'Weijun Qin', 'Guojun Wu', 'Xiaojian Yang', 'Chen Shao', 'Leland W K Chung', 'Jianlin Yuan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Synthesis of IR-780 dye-conjugated abiraterone for prostate cancer imaging and therapy.', 'Near‑infrared fluorescence imaging of prostate cancer using heptamethine carbocyanine dyes.', 'Near infrared fluorescent imaging of brain tumor with IR780 dye incorporated phospholipid nanoparticles.', 'Optical imaging of gastric cancer with near-infrared heptamethine carbocyanine fluorescence dyes.', 'A near-infrared fluorescent heptamethine indocyanine dye with preferential tumor accumulation for in vivo imaging.', 'Interaction of Near-Infrared (NIR)-Light Responsive Probes with Lipid Membranes: A Combined Simulation and Experimental Study.', 'Triggered release of antimicrobial peptide from microneedle patches for treatment of wound biofilms.', 'Sonosensitive Phase-Changeable Nanoparticle Mediated Enhanced Chemotherapy in Prostate Cancer by Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound.', 'Mitochondria targeting IR780-based nanoGUMBOS for enhanced selective toxicity towards cancer cells.', 'Heptamethine Cyanine Dye MHI-148-Mediated Drug Delivery System to Enhance the Anticancer Efficiency of Paclitaxel.']"""

Prostate apoptosis response (Par)-4, a tumor suppressor, is expressed as both an intracellular and secretory/extracellular protein. Though secretory Par-4 induces apoptosis in cancer cells, its potential in drug-resistant tumors remains to be fully explored. Multicellular spheroids (MCS) of cancer cells often acquire multi-drug resistance and serve as ideal experimental models. We investigated the role of Par-4 in Tamoxifen (TAM)-induced cell death in MCS of human cell lines and primary cultures of GBM tumors. TCGA and REMBRANT data analysis revealed that low levels of Par-4 correlated with low survival period (21.85 ± 19.30 days) in GBM but not in astrocytomas (59.13 ± 47.26 days) and oligodendrogliomas (58.04 ± 59.80 days) suggesting low PAWR expression as a predictive risk factor in GBM. Consistently, MCS of human cell lines and primary cultures displayed low Par-4 expression, high level of chemo-resistance genes and were resistant to TAM-induced cytotoxicity. In monolayer cells, TAM-induced cytotoxicity was associated with enhanced expression of Par-4 and was alleviated by silencing of Par-4 using specific siRNA. TAM effectively induced secretory Par-4 in conditioned medium (CM) of cells cultured as monolayer but not in MCS. Moreover, MCS were rendered sensitive to TAM-induced cell death by exposure to conditioned medium (CM)-containing Par-4 (derived from TAM-treated monolayer cells). Also TAM reduced the expression of Akt and PKCζ in GBM cells cultured as monolayer but not in MCS. Importantly, combination of TAM with inhibitors to PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) or PKCζ resulted in secretion of Par-4 and cell death in MCS. Since membrane GRP78 is overexpressed in most cancer cells but not normal cells, and secretory Par-4 induces apoptosis by binding to membrane GRP78, secretory Par-4 is an attractive candidate for potentially overcoming therapy-resistance not only in malignant glioma but in broad spectrum of cancers.""","""['Jayashree C Jagtap', 'D Parveen', 'Reecha D Shah', 'Aarti Desai', 'Dipali Bhosale', 'Ashish Chugh', 'Deepak Ranade', 'Swapnil Karnik', 'Bhushan Khedkar', 'Aaishwarya Mathur', 'Kumar Natesh', 'Goparaju Chandrika', 'Padma Shastry']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""FEBS Open Bio""","""['Expression and regulation of prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) in human glioma stem cells in drug-induced apoptosis.', 'Cathepsin L silencing enhances arsenic trioxide mediated in vitro cytotoxicity and apoptosis in glioblastoma U87MG spheroids.', 'Silencing of MicroRNA-21 confers the sensitivity to tamoxifen and fulvestrant by enhancing autophagic cell death through inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in breast cancer cells.', 'Lack of multicellular drug resistance observed in human ovarian and prostate carcinoma treated with the proteasome inhibitor PS-341.', 'Impact of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 on resistance of ovarian cancer multicellular spheroids to taxol.', 'Crizotinib induces Par-4 secretion from normal cells and GRP78 expression on the cancer cell surface for selective tumor growth inhibition.', 'Prostate Apoptosis Response-4 (Par-4): A Novel Target in Pyronaridine-Induced Apoptosis in Glioblastoma (GBM) Cells.', 'Arylquin 1 (Potent Par-4 Secretagogue) Inhibits Tumor Progression and Induces Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Tumor Suppressor Par-4 Regulates Complement Factor C3 and Obesity.', 'Expression of PAWR predicts prognosis of ovarian cancer.']"""

In this study, we analyzed the presence of CYP3A4-A-290G polymorphism in 77 newly diagnosed AML cases and 72 healthy control using PCR/RFLP aiming to show CYP3A4-A-290G polymorphism pattern in acute myeloid leukemia patients, and its role in disease severity and progression.

Twenty-four patients (38%) underwent robotic RP and 40 patients (62%) underwent open RP. Bilateral lymph node dissection and nerve preservation were performed in 50 patients (78%) and 35 patients (55%), respectively. Variables evaluated included demographic characteristics, perioperative complications, and functional and oncological outcomes. The median hospitalization and follow-up periods were 2 days (range, 1-12 days) and 21 months (range, 1-108 months), respectively.  Results:   No conversions from robotic to open surgery were performed and there were no intraoperative complications. Surgical margins were positive in 13 patients (20%), seminal vesicle involvement was detected in 6 patients (9%), and lymph node involvement was found in 2 patients (3%). Postoperative complications included lymphocele in 1 patient, urethral stricture in 1 patient, and bowel obstruction and persistent bladder leakage in 2 patients. Eighty-eight percent of the patients were continent at 7 months and 80% of patients were able to achieve erection with or without medical aid.

Exome arrays were used to develop a clinicogenetic model that combined clinical data related to PCa and individual genetic variations.  Materials and methods:   We genotyped 242,186 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by using a custom HumanExome BeadChip v1.0 (Illumina Inc.) from the blood DNA of 341 patients with PCa. The genetic data were analyzed to calculate an odds ratio as an estimate of the relative risk of LNI. We compared the accuracies of the multivariate logistic model incorporating clinical factors between the included and excluded selected SNPs. The Cox proportional hazard models with or without genetic factors for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR) were analyzed.  Results:   The genetic analysis indicated that five SNPs (rs75444444, rs8055236, rs2301277, rs9300039, and rs6908581) were significant for predicting LNI in patients with PCa. When a multivariate model incorporating clinical factors was devised to predict LNI, the predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was 80.7%. By adding genetic factors in the aforementioned multivariate model, the predictive accuracy increased to 93.2% (p=0.006). These genetic variations were significant factors for predicting BCR after adjustment for other variables and after adding the predictive gain to BCR.  Conclusions:   Based on the results of the exome array, the selected SNPs were predictors for LNI.

Bombesin (BN) analogs are short peptides with a high affinity for GRPR. Different BN analogs were evaluated for radionuclide imaging and therapy of GRPR-expressing tumors. We have previously investigated an antagonistic analog of BN (D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH(2), RM26) conjugated to NOTA via a PEG(2) spacer (NOTA-PEG(2)-RM26) labeled with (68)Ga, (111)In and Al(18)F.

Methods:   The influence of different macrocyclic chelators (NOTA, NODAGA, DOTA and DOTAGA) on the targeting properties of (68)Ga-labeled PEG(2)-RM26 was studied in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   All conjugates were labeled with generator-produced (68)Ga with high yields and demonstrated high stability and specific binding to GRPR. The IC(50) values of (nat)Ga-X-PEG(2)-RM26 (X = NOTA, DOTA, NODAGA, DOTAGA) were 2.3 ± 0.2, 3.0 ± 0.3, 2.9 ± 0.3 and 10.0 ± 0.6 nM, respectively. The internalization of the conjugates by PC-3 cells was low. However, the DOTA-conjugated analog demonstrated a higher internalization rate compared to other analogs. GRPR-specific uptake was found in receptor-positive normal tissues and PC-3 xenografts for all conjugates. The biodistribution of the conjugates was influenced by the choice of the chelator moiety. Although all radiotracers cleared rapidly from the blood, [(68)Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG(2)-RM26 showed significantly lower uptake in lung, muscle and bone compared to the other analogs.

Recent studies report an 'epidemic' of T prescribing and concern about unnecessary T treatment. We investigated the number of men tested for T, the prevalence of low serum T levels, and initiation of T treatment among those with low T levels in men treated at Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities in the Northwest US (VISN 20). We identified male Veterans aged 40-89 years and examined yearly proportions of men tested for T, found to have low T levels (total T < 280 ng/dL, free T < 34 pg/mL, or bioavailable T < 84 ng/dL), and subsequently treated with T from 2002 to 2011. We excluded men who had T treatment in the year prior and men with diagnoses of prostate or breast cancer. Treatment initiation was defined as the first prescription for T within a year following a low T test. From 2002 to 2011, the yearly population of eligible men in VISN 20 increased from 129 247 to 163 572. The proportion of men who had serum T tests increased from 3.2% in 2002 to 5.8% in 2011. Among the tested men, the percentage of men with low T levels increased from 35.0 to 47.3%. However, the proportion of men with low T levels who were given T treatment within a year decreased from 31.0 to 28.0%. Despite large increases in T testing, and detection of men with low T levels, there was a slight decrease in the proportion of men with low T levels who were treated with T. The decrease in T treatment during this time period contrasts with other studies and may be related to higher comorbidity in Veterans and/or VA formulary restrictions on the use of transdermal T formulations.""","""['T J Walsh', 'M M Shores', 'A E Fox', 'K P Moore', 'C W Forsberg', 'C E Kinsey', 'S R Heckbert', 'S Zeliadt', 'M L Thompson', 'N L Smith', 'A M Matsumoto']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Andrology""","""['Injection of testosterone may be safer and more effective than transdermal administration for combating loss of muscle and bone in older men.', 'Short-term effects of intramuscular and transdermal testosterone on bone turnover, prostate symptoms, cholesterol, and hematocrit in men over age 70 with low testosterone levels.', 'Efficacy of changing testosterone gel preparations (Androgel or Testim) among suboptimally responsive hypogonadal men.', 'Prostate-specific antigen changes and prostate cancer in hypogonadal men treated with testosterone replacement therapy.', 'Commentary: Who is a candidate for testosterone therapy?

Materials and methods:   A content analysis was conducted on 1,138 news stories covered during a 5-year period between 2008 and 2012. The news stories were selected from nationally representative media in Korea. Information was collected about cancer risk factors and cancer sites.  Results:   Of various cancer risk factors, occupational and environmental exposures appeared most frequently in the news. Breast cancer was mentioned the most in relation to cancer sites. Breast, cervical, prostate, and skin cancer were overrepresented in the media in comparison to incidence and mortality cases, whereas lung, thyroid, liver, and stomach cancer were underrepresented.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this research is the first investigation dealing with news coverage about cancer risk factors in Korea.

While prostate cancer screening is not recommended for men>70 years, fit elderly men with controlled comorbidities may have a relatively long life expectancy. We compare the use of age related PSA with the detection of primary malignant circulating prostate cells mCPCs to detect clinically significant PC in this population.  Materials and methods:   All men undergoing PC screening with a PSA>4.0 ng/ml underwent TRUS 12 core prostate biopsy (PB). Age, PSA, PB results defined as cancer/no-cancer, Gleason, number of positive cores and percentage infiltration were registered. Men had an 8 ml blood sample taken for mCPC detection; mononuclear cells were obtained using differential gel centrifugation and mCPCs were identified using immunocytochemistry with anti-PSA and anti-P504S. A mCPC was defined as a cell expressing PSA and P504S; a positive test as at least one mCPC detected/sample. Diagnostic yields for subgroups were calculated and the number of avoided PBs registered. Esptein criteria were used to define small grade tumours.  Results:   A total of 610 men underwent PB, 398 of whom were aged <70 yrs. Men over 70 yrs had: a higher median PSA, 6.24 ng/ml versus 5.59 ng/ml (p=0.04); and a higher frequency of cancer detected 90/212 (43%) versus 134/398 (34%) (p=0.032). Some 34/134 cancers in men<70 yrs versus 22/90 (24%) of men>70 yrs complied with criteria for active surveillance. CPC detection: 154/398 (39%) men<70 yrs were CPC (+), specificity for cancer 86%, sensitivity 88%, 14/16 with a false (-) result had a small low grade PC. In men>70 years, 88/212 (42%) were CPC (+); specificity 92%, sensitivity 87%, 10/12 with a false (-) had small low grade tumours. False (+) results were more common in younger men 36/154 versus 10/88 (p<0.02). With a PSA cutoff of 6.5 ng/ml, in men<70 yrs, 108 PB would be avoided, missing 56 cancers of which 48 were clinically significant. Using CPC detection, 124 biopsies would be avoided, missing only 2 clinically significant cancers. In men>70 yrs using a PSA>6.5 ng/ml would have resulted in 108 PB with 34 PC detected, of which 14(41%) were small low grade tumours.

Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations was used to assess predictors of ED and Kaplan-Meier curves time to ED. The effect of aging was calculated from the declining rate of baseline EF seen in sequential 5-year age cohorts and from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study.  Results:   The median age was 66 years and median FU 3.5 years (maximum 14 years). About 1142 patients had more than 5 years of FU, and 43% had received 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

Comparisons of the 5-year age-related and treatment-related EF decline show that 50% of the long-term EF decline is related to aging. On univariate and multivariate analyses, age at implant, length of FU, hypertension, diabetes, and use of ADT (all p < 0.01) were significant predictors of ED.

Materials and methods:   Thirty-eight consecutive patients who underwent curative WPRT were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty six (68.4%) received 3DCRT and the others (31.6%) were treated with TOMOSIB. A local boost to the prostate circumferential area was added to WPRT sequentially for 3DCRT and concomitantly for TOMOSIB. The total median prostate or prostatic bed dose was 64.8 Gy including median 45.0 Gy of WPRT. Acute toxicities were assessed according to RTOG criteria.  Results:   Overall intestinal toxicity was lower in TOMOSIB group than 3DCRT group (p=0.008). When it was divided into rectum and non-rectum intestine (NRI), TOMOSIB showed borderline superiority only in NRI toxicity (p=0.047). For the urinary toxicity, there was no significant difference between two groups (p=0.796). On dosimetric analysis for the rectum and bladder, dose delivered to 80% (p<0.001) and volume receiving 25-40 Gy (p<0.001) were remarkably higher in 3DCRT. For the NRI, only maximum dose showed significant results between two groups (p<0.001).

Materials and methods:   This study included 55 patients with CRPC who received chemotherapy and in whom pre-treatment or post-treatment PSA levels could be serially obtained. The baseline parameters included age, performance, Gleason score, PSA level, and disease extent. PSA doubling time was calculated using the different intervals: the conventional interval from the second hormone manipulation following the nadir until anti-androgen withdrawal (PSADT1), the interval from the initial rise after anti-androgen withdrawal to the start of chemotherapy (PSADT2), and the interval from the nadir until the start of chemotherapy (PSADT3). The PSA growth patterns were analyzed using the ratio of PSADT2 to PSADT1.  Results:   There were two growth patterns of PSA doubling time: 22 patients (40.0%) had a steady pattern with a more prolonged PSADT2 than PSADT1, while 33 (60.0%) had an accelerating pattern with a shorter PSADT2 than PSADT1. During three cycles of chemotherapy, PSA flare occurred in 11 patients (20.0%); of these patients, 3 were among 33 (9.1%) patients with an accelerating PSA growth pattern and 8 were among 22 patients (36.4%) with a steady PSA growth pattern (p=0.019). Multivariate analysis showed that only PSA growth pattern was an independent predictor of PSA flare (p=0.034).  Conclusion:   An exponential rise in PSA during anti-androgen withdrawal is a significant predictor for PSA flare during chemotherapy in CRPC patients.""","""['Kyung Seok Han', 'Sung Joon Hong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Yonsei Med J""","""['Serum alkaline phosphatase differentiates prostate-specific antigen flare from early disease progression after docetaxel chemotherapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastasis.', 'Co-introduction of a steroid with docetaxel chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer affects PSA flare.', 'Prostate-specific antigen response to deferred combined androgen blockade therapy using bicalutamide predicts survival after subsequent oestrogen and docetaxel therapies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Choice of new drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer: predictive factors and effectiveness assessment.', 'PSA surge/flare-up in patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer during the initial phase of chemotherapy.', 'Using medical claims database to develop a population disease progression model for leuprorelin-treated subjects with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Survival Outcomes of Concurrent Treatment with Docetaxel and Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

It involves destruction of cancer cells within a limited spatial domain by exposing them to very low temperatures while minimizing injury to surrounding peripheral healthy tissues. Surprisingly, despite increasing demands for cryosurgery, there has been limited innovation in the design of cryoprobes, particularly in solid tumors (e.g., breast, prostate, and lung cancers). For advances in cancer therapeutics, integrative biology research can illuminate the mechanistic interface between a surgical cryoprobe and its tissue site of action. Here, we describe the design and development of three novel low pressure liquid nitrogen (LN2) cryoprobes with different physical dimensions and the parameters that determine their effectiveness experimentally, using water and bio-gel as the phase changing mediums. Smaller diameter low pressure probes produced lesser cryogenic injury. Vapor Separator is found to be an effective means (particularly for smaller diameter probes) to remove the vapor lock in the LN2 low pressure cryoprobes and also to reduce the precooling time. The low pressure LN2 cryoprobes produced lower probe temperatures and consequently larger and faster iceball growth for low cooling loads. Additionally, a numerical code was written in MATLAB based on the Enthalpy method to simulate the bio-heat transfer in a cryosurgical process. The numerical code is validated by analytical solution, laboratory experiments, and data from an in vivo cryosurgery. The developed numerical code is presented herein to illustrate that LN2 cryoprobes capable of producing lower probe temperatures produce more efficient cryosurgical operation by reducing the buffer zone and duration of surgery.This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, on design of the next generation of LN2 surgical cryoprobes.

For optimization of the functional a new variant of a matching pursuit type solver is presented. The results are compared with current state-of-the-art inverse treatment planning algorithms by means of real prostate cancer patient data. The novel strategy outperforms the best state-of-the-art methods in speed, while achieving comparable quality. It is able to find solutions with comparable values for the objective function and it achieves these results within a few microseconds, being up to 542 times faster than competing state-of-the-art strategies, allowing real-time treatment planning.

The purpose of this study was to compare AIF choice in differentiating peripheral zone PCa from non-neoplastic prostatic tissue (NNPT), using PK analysis of high temporal resolution prostate DCE-MRI data and whole-mount pathology (WMP) validation. This prospective study was performed in 30 patients who underwent multiparametric endorectal prostate MRI at 3.0T and WMP validation. PCa foci were annotated on WMP slides and MR images using 3D Slicer. Foci ≥0.5cm(3) were contoured as tumor regions of interest (TROIs) on subtraction DCE (early-arterial - pre-contrast) images. PK analyses of TROI and NNPT data were performed using automatic AIF (aAIF) and model AIF (mAIF) methods. A paired t-test compared mean and 90th percentile (p90) PK parameters obtained with the two AIF approaches. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis determined diagnostic accuracy (DA) of PK parameters. Logistic regression determined correlation between PK parameters and histopathology. Mean TROI and NNPT PK parameters were higher using aAIF vs. mAIF (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in DA between AIF methods: highest for p90 volume transfer constant (K(trans)) (aAIF differences in the area under the ROC curve (Az) = 0.827; mAIF Az=0.93).

The role of interleukin-17 (IL-17), insulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in adhesion of prostate cancer cells to the vascular endothelial cells is unknown, which is the subject of the present study.  Methods:   Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP, and C4-2B) were analyzed for expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), integrins, and cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) using flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The effects of IL-17, insulin, and IGF1 on VCAM-1 expression and adhesion of prostate cancer cells to HUVECs were examined. The interaction of VCAM-1 and CD44 was assessed using immunoprecipitation assays.  Results:   Insulin and IGF1 acted with IL-17 to increase VCAM-1 expression in HUVECs. PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP, and C4-2B cells expressed β1 integrin but not α4 integrin. CD44 was expressed by PC-3 and DU-145 cells but not by LNCaP or C4-2B cells. When HUVECs were treated with IL-17, insulin or IGF1, particularly with a combination of IL-17 and insulin (or IGF1), adhesion of PC-3 and DU-145 cells to HUVECs was significantly increased. In contrast, adhesion of LNCaP and C4-2B cells to HUVECs was not affected by treatment of HUVECs with IL-17 and/or insulin/IGF1. CD44 expressed in PC-3 cells physically bound to VCAM-1 expressed in HUVECs.  Conclusions:   CD44-VCAM-1 interaction mediates the adhesion between prostate cancer cells and HUVECs. IL-17 and insulin/IGF1 enhance adhesion of prostate cancer cells to vascular endothelial cells through increasing VCAM-1 expression in the vascular endothelial cells.

Materials and methods:   Patients (N = 30) underwent mpMRI that included diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI at 3 T before radical prostatectomy (RP). RP specimens were processed using WM technique (WMP) and findings summarized in a standard surgical pathology report (SPR). Histology index tumor volumes (HTVs) were compared to MR tumor volumes (MRTVs) using two approaches for index lesion identification on mpMRI using annotated WMP slides as the reference (WMP) and using routine SPR as the reference. Consistency of index tumor localization, tumor volume, and mean values of the derived quantitative parameters (mean apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], K(trans), and ve) were compared.  Results:   Index lesions from 16 of 30 patients met the selection criteria. There was WMP/SRP agreement in index tumor in 13 of 16 patients. ADC-based MRTVs were larger (P < .05) than DCE-based MRTVs. ADC MRTVs were smaller than HTV (P < .005). There was a strong correlation between HTV and MRTV (Pearson ρ > 0.8; P < .05). No significant differences were observed in the mean values of K(trans) and ADC between the WMP and SPR.

Methods:   Bioinformatics analysis was used to show potential post-translational regulation of IRS1 by miR200c. Dual reporter gene assays were chosen to test the binding of miR200c to the potential seed sequences in IRS1 3'UTR. RT-PCR, Q-PCR and western blot were applied to determine the regulation effect of miR200c on IRS1. CCK8 assay, soft agar assay, trypan blue exclusion assay and flow cytometric analysis were used to measure the biological effects of miR200c on prostate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.  Results:   The 449-455 nt, 3061-3067 nt, and 3096-3102 nt of the IRS1 3'-UTR were identified as three potential seed sequences for miR200c. MiR200c directly binds to IRS1 through the seed sequences in IRS1 3'-UTR. Artificial overexpression of miR200c significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of IRS1, together with decreased cell proliferation and increased cell death of PC3 and DU145 cells.

AEs and other safety variables were assessed on day 1, weeks 4 and 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Data following transition to commercial drug were not collected.  Results:   Median age was 71 years (range 43-97); 426 patients (83.9%) had a baseline ECOG score of ≤1. In addition to docetaxel, the majority of patients had received prior prostate cancer treatments such as abiraterone (76.1%) or cabazitaxel (28.6%).

We developed a model to stratify the Finnish population by different risk profiles related to genetic variants to optimize the screening policy.  Methods:   Data from the Finnish randomized controlled trial on screening for PCa with PSA testing were used to estimate a six-state Markov model of disease progression. Blood samples from Finnish men were used to assess the risk of PCa related to three genetic variants (rs4242382, rs138213197, and rs200331695). A risk score-based approach combined with a series of computer simulation models was applied to optimize individual screening policies.  Results:   The 10-year risk of having progressive prostate cancer detected ranged from 43% in the top 5% risk group to approximately 11% in the bottom half of the population. Using the median group, with screening every four years beginning at 55 years-old, as the reference group, the recommended age beginning screening was approximately 47 years-old for the top 5% risk group and 55 years-old for those in the lower 60% risk group. The recommended interscreening interval has been shortened for individuals in the high risk group. The increased availability of genomic information allows the proposed multistate model to be more discriminating with respect to risk stratification and the suggested screening policy, particularly for the lowest risk groups-. --  Conclusions:   A multi-state genetic variant-based model was developed for further application to population risk stratification to optimize the interscreening interval and the age at which to begin screening for PSA. A small sub-group of the population is likely to benefit from more intensive screening with early start and short interval, while half of the population is unlikely to benefit from such protocol (compared with four-year interval after age 55 years).""","""['Amy Ming-Fang Yen', 'Anssi Auvinen', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Yi-Ying Wu', 'Jean Ching-Yuan Fann', 'Teuvo Tammela', 'Sam Li-Sheng Chen', 'Sherry Yueh-Hsia Chiu', 'Hsiu-Hsi Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The impact of interscreening interval and age on prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen.', 'Histological inflammation and risk of subsequent prostate cancer among men with initially elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Prostate cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized screening trial.', 'Baseline prostate-specific antigen testing at a young age.', 'Prostate cancer screening.', 'Gene‒Prostate-Specific-Antigen-Guided Personalized Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Screening Men at Increased Risk for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Model Estimates of Benefits and Harms.']"""

To aid in the development of screening strategies, we refined models designed to determine risk of CRC by incorporating information from common genetic susceptibility loci.  Methods:   By using data collected from more than 12,000 participants in 6 studies performed from 1990 through 2011 in the United States and Germany, we developed risk determination models based on sex, age, family history, genetic risk score (number of risk alleles carried at 27 validated common CRC susceptibility loci), and history of endoscopic examinations. The model was validated using data collected from approximately 1800 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, conducted from 1993 through 2001 in the United States.  Results:   We identified a CRC genetic risk score that independently predicted which patients in the training set would develop CRC. Compared with determination of risk based only on family history, adding the genetic risk score increased the discriminatory accuracy from 0.51 to 0.59 (P = .0028) for men and from 0.52 to 0.56 (P = .14) for women. We calculated age- and sex-specific 10-year CRC absolute risk estimates based on the number of risk alleles, family history, and history of endoscopic examinations. A model that included a genetic risk score better determined the recommended starting age for screening in subjects with and without family histories of CRC. The starting age for high-risk men (family history of CRC and genetic risk score, 90%) was 42 years, and for low-risk men (no family history of CRC and genetic risk score, 10%) was 52 years. For men with no family history and a high genetic risk score (90%), the starting age would be 47 years; this is an intermediate value that is 5 years earlier than it would be for men with a genetic risk score of 10%. Similar trends were observed in women.  Conclusions:   By incorporating information on CRC risk alleles, we created a model to determine the risk for CRC more accurately. This model might be used to develop screening and prevention strategies.""","""['Li Hsu', 'Jihyoun Jeon', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Stephen B Gruber', 'Robert E Schoen', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Andrew T Chan', 'Jenny Chang-Claude', 'Mengmeng Du', 'Jian Gong', 'Tabitha A Harrison', 'Richard B Hayes', 'Michael Hoffmeister', 'Carolyn M Hutter', 'Yi Lin', 'Reiko Nishihara', 'Shuji Ogino', 'Ross L Prentice', 'Fredrick R Schumacher', 'Daniela Seminara', 'Martha L Slattery', 'Duncan C Thomas', 'Mark Thornquist', 'Polly A Newcomb', 'John D Potter', 'Yingye Zheng', 'Emily White', 'Ulrike Peters;Colorectal Transdisciplinary (CORECT) Study;Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO)']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Gastroenterology""","""['Machine Learning Methods in Gastroenterology.', 'Reply: To PMID 25683114.', 'Determining Risk of Colorectal Cancer and Starting Age of Screening Based on Lifestyle, Environmental, and Genetic Factors.', 'Estimation of Absolute Risk of Colorectal Cancer Based on Healthy Lifestyle, Genetic Risk, and Colonoscopy Status in a Population-Based Study.', 'Susceptibility genetic variants associated with colorectal cancer risk correlate with cancer phenotype.', 'Genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer: where we stand and future perspectives.', 'Familial colorectal cancer screening: When and what to do?', 'From Omic Layers to Personalized Medicine in Colorectal Cancer: The Road Ahead.', 'Clinically relevant combined effect of polygenic background, rare pathogenic germline variants, and family history on colorectal cancer incidence.', 'Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment and Precision Approaches to Screening: Brave New World or Worlds Apart?', 'Risk assessment for colorectal cancer via polygenic risk score and lifestyle\xa0exposure: a large-scale association study of East Asian and European populations.', 'Validation of a Genetic-Enhanced Risk Prediction Model for Colorectal Cancer in a Large Community-Based Cohort.']"""

The A. altilis extracts and the partially purified fraction have been shown to inhibit STAT3 activity and the phosphorylation of STAT3 in a dose-dependent manner. To identify the active components, a bioassay-guided isolation of the partially purified fraction resulted in the identification of a geranyl dihydrochalcone, CG901. Its chemical structure was established on the basis of spectroscopic evidence and comparison with published data. The partially purified fraction and the isolated a geranyl dihydrochalcone, CG901, down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes, induced apoptosis in DU145 prostate cancer cells via caspase-3 and PARP degradation, and inhibited tumor growth in human prostate tumor (DU145) xenograft initiation model.

The current study was undertaken to establish the therapeutic benefit to target hedgehog signaling cascade using GDC-0449 to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel. Here, we show that the combination of GDC-0449 plus docetaxel inhibited the proliferation of WPE1-NB26 cells and PC3 cells via a blockade of G1 and G2M phases. The combined treatment significantly inhibited PC cell migration in vitro. Moreover, the apoptotic effect induced by GDC-0449 plus docetaxel on PC3 cells was mediated, at least partly, via the mitochondrial membrane depolarization, H2O2 production and caspase cascade activation. Interestingly, GDC-0449 was effective at inhibiting the prostasphere formation, inducing the prostasphere disintegration and apoptotic death of side population (SP) from PC3 cells and reversing the resistance of SP cells to docetaxel. In addition, GDC-0449 plus docetaxel also have shown a greater anti-tumoral growth inhibitory effect on PC3 cell xenografts.

We developed an inhibitor named the Multi-Leu peptide, with potent in vitro anti-proliferative effects. However, the Multi-Leu peptide has not been tested under in vivo conditions and its potency under such conditions is most likely limited, due to the labile characteristics of peptides in general. Using a peptidomimetic approach, we modified the initial scaffold, generating the analog Ac-[DLeu]LLLRVK-Amba, which demonstrates increased inhibitory potency and stability. The systemic administration of this peptidomimetic significantly inhibits tumor progression in the LNCaP xenograft model of prostate cancer by inducing tumor cell quiescence, increased apoptosis and neovascularization impairment.

The tumor microenvironment is an important field of cancer to understand the detection, treatment and prevention of cancer. Recently, cancer stem cell (CSC) research has shown promising results aiming towards cancer diagnostics and treatment. Here, we found that prostate and breast cancer stem cells secreted vesicles of endosomal origin, called exosomes showed strong connection between autophagy and exosomes released from CSCs. Exosomes may serve as vesicles to communicate with neoplastic cells (autocrine and paracrine manner) and normal cells (paracrine and endocrine manner) and thereby suppress immune systems and regulate neoplastic growth, and metastasis. They can also be used as biomarkers for various cancers. We detected tetraspanin proteins (CD9, CD63, CD81), Alix and tumor susceptibility gene-101 (TSG101) of exosomal markers from rotenone treated CSCs. We have also detected the induction of autophagy genes, Atg7 and conversion of autophagy marker (LC3-I to LC3-II), and tetraspanin proteins (CD9, CD63, CD81) in rotenone treated CSCs by western blotting. The mRNA expression of CD9, CD63, CD81 and TSG101 analyzed by qRT-PCR showed that the rotenone induced the expression of CD9, CD63, CD81 and TSG101 in CSCs. Electron microscopy of rotenone treated CSCs showed the mitochondrial damage of CSCs as confirmed by the release of exosomes from CSCs.

However, little attention has been directed to p,p'-DDT and the anti-androgen, p,p'-DDE on androgen receptor (AR) target gene transcription in human cells. Inhibitors of androgenic activity may have a deleterious clinical outcome in prostate cancer screens and progression, therefore we determined whether environmentally relevant concentrations of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE negatively impact AR-regulated expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and other AR target genes in human LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cells. Quantitative real-time PCR and immuno-blotting techniques were used to measure intracellular PSA, PSMA and AR mRNA and protein levels. We have shown for the first time that p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE repressed R1881-inducible PSA mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, we used the fully automated COBAS PSA detection system to determine that extracellular PSA levels were also significantly repressed. These chemicals achieve this by blocking the recruitment of AR to the PSA promoter region at 10 μM, as demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in LNCaP cells. Both p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE repressed R1881-inducible AR protein accumulation at 10 μM. Thus, we conclude that men who have been exposed to either DDT or DDE may produce a false-negative PSA test when screening for prostate cancer, resulting in an inaccurate clinical diagnosis. More importantly, prolonged exposure to these anti-androgens may mimic androgen ablation therapy in individuals with prostate cancer, thus exacerbating the condition by inadvertently forcing adaptation to this stress early in the disease.""","""['Lilian I L Wong', 'Mark P Labrecque', 'Naokazu Ibuki', 'Michael E Cox', 'John E Elliott', 'Timothy V Beischlag']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Chem Biol Interact""","""['A novel regulation of PSMA and PSA expression by Q640X AR in 22Rv1 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Dissociation between androgen responsiveness for malignant growth vs. expression of prostate specific differentiation markers PSA, hK2, and PSMA in human prostate cancer models.', 'Docetaxel down-regulates the expression of androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen but not prostate-specific membrane antigen in prostate cancer cell lines: implications for PSA surrogacy.', 'Prostate specific antigen gene regulation by androgen receptor.', ""Association between Exposure to p,p'-DDT and Its Metabolite p,p'-DDE with Obesity: Integrated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."", 'Interplay between Prostate Cancer and Adipose Microenvironment: A Complex and Flexible Scenario.', 'Breast and prostate glands affected by environmental substances (Review).', 'Night shiftwork and prostate-specific antigen level in a tire manufacturing factory.', 'Lipid Metabolism Alteration by Endocrine Disruptors in Animal Models: An Overview.', 'Effects of halogenated contaminants on reproductive development in wild mink (Neovison vison) from locations in Canada.']"""

Although several anti-TROP-2 antibodies have been described, they were found unsuitable for antitumor therapy use in vivo as naked antibodies. In this study, we established a novel anti-TROP-2 antibody, designated Pr1E11, from mice immunized with primary prostate cancer cells. Antibody screening was based on the infection activity of Adv-LacZ-FZ33, which displays an immunoglobulin G binding domain in the adenoviral fiber protein. We found that Pr1E11 specifically binds to TROP-2 with high affinity and recognizes diverse epithelial cancer cell lines and primary pancreatic cancer tissues. Epitope analysis using TROP-2 deletion mutants revealed that binding site of Pr1E11 is a cysteine-rich domain, a unique epitope compared with other available anti-TROP-2 antibodies. In addition, Pr1E11 exhibited low internalization activity, which may make it suitable for naked antibody therapeutics. Our results suggest that Pr1E11 may stimulate different biological activities from other anti-TROP-2 antibodies based on its unique binding epitope, and is a potential candidate for naked antibody therapeutics for various epithelial cancer treatments.""","""['Masahiro Ikeda', 'Miki Yamaguchi', 'Kazunori Kato', 'Kiminori Nakamura', 'Sagano Shiina', 'Takako Ichikawa-Ando', 'Hirofumi Misaka', 'Kensuke Myojo', 'Kazuyasu Nakamura', 'Yoshiyuki Sugimoto', 'Hirofumi Hamada']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Targeting Trop-2 in solid tumors: future prospects.', 'Neural cell adhesion molecule 2 as a target molecule for prostate and breast cancer gene therapy.', 'Exploration of target molecules for prostate cancer gene therapy.', 'EpCAM- and EGFR-targeted selective gene therapy for biliary cancers using Z33-fiber-modified adenovirus.', 'Recent advances in trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 targeted therapy for solid tumors.', 'The 2EF Antibody Targets a Unique N-Terminal Epitope of Trop-2 and Enhances the In Vivo Activity of the Cancer-Selective 2G10 Antibody.', 'The anti-Trop-2 antibody-drug conjugate Sacituzumab Govitecan-effectiveness, pitfalls and promises.', 'Identification and Characterization of Specific Nanobodies against Trop-2 for Tumor Targeting.', 'Trop-2 cleavage by ADAM10 is an activator switch for cancer growth and metastasis.', 'Targeting Trop-2 in solid tumors: future prospects.']"""

The diagnostic tools for prostate investigation are invasive, requiring biopsies when PCa is suspected. Novel dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) imaging approaches have been proposed recently and appear promising for minimally invasive localization of PCa. Ultrasound imaging of the prostate is traditionally performed with a transrectal probe because the location of the prostate allows for high-resolution images using high-frequency transducers. However, DCE-US imaging requires lower frequencies to induce bubble resonance and, thus, improve contrast-to-tissue ratio. For this reason, in this study we investigate the feasibility of quantitative DCE-US imaging of the prostate via the abdomen. The study included 10 patients (age = 60.7 ± 5.7 y) referred for a needle biopsy study. After having given informed consent, patients underwent DCE-US with both transabdominal and transrectal probes. Time-intensity contrast curves were derived using both approaches and their model-fit quality was compared. Although further improvements are expected by optimization of the transabdominal settings, the results of transabdominal and transrectal DCE-US are closely comparable, confirming the feasibility of transabdominal DCE-US; transabdominal curve fitting revealed an average determination coefficient r(2) = 0.91 (r(2) > 0.75 for 78.6% of all prostate pixels) compared with r(2) = 0.91 (r(2) > 0.75 for 81.6% of all prostate pixels) by the transrectal approach. Replacing the transrectal approach with more acceptable transabdominal scanning for prostate investigation is feasible. This approach would improve patient comfort and represent a useful option for PCa localization and monitoring.""","""['Massimo Mischi', 'Libertario Demi', 'Martijn Smeenge', 'Maarten P J Kuenen', 'Arnoud W Postema', 'Jean J M C H de la Rosette', 'Hessel Wijkstra']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Ultrasound Med Biol""","""['Real-time contrast-enhanced transrectal US-guided prostate biopsy: diagnostic accuracy in men with previously negative biopsy results and positive MR imaging findings.', '3-D Quantitative Dynamic Contrast Ultrasound for Prostate Cancer Localization.', 'Automated multiparametric localization of prostate cancer based on B-mode, shear-wave elastography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound radiomics.', 'Imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis: present role and future perspectives.', 'Enhanced transrectal ultrasound modalities in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Trial Protocol: Developing an Image Classification Algorithm for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis on Three-dimensional Multiparametric Transrectal Ultrasound.', 'The potential of a nomogram combined PI-RADS v2.1 and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to reduce unnecessary biopsies in prostate cancer diagnostics.', 'High Resolution Ultrasound Superharmonic Perfusion Imaging: In Vivo Feasibility and Quantification of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Acoustic Angiography.']"""

Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis of 158 patients with CT examinations that revealed the presence of MP was performed. CT images were analyzed by two different radiologists using morphological criteria validated in the radiological literature. The presence, frequency and type of neoplastic lesions associated with MP were assessed.  Results:   MP was asymptomatic in 96/158 patients (61%).

The neoplastic diseases most often associated with MP were lymphoma (28%), melanoma (18%), colorectal cancer (15%) and prostate cancer (13%).  Conclusion:   MP has typical CT appearance and is associated with underlying neoplastic disease in 56% of patients.

Patients and methods:   A single-arm, two-stage, multicentre, phase 2 trial to determine the activity, feasibility, and safety of 12-week cycles of sunitinib 50 mg daily 4 weeks on / 2 weeks off, alternating with everolimus 10 mg daily for 5 weeks on / 1 week off, until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity in favourable or intermediate-risk aRCC. The primary end point was proportion alive and progression-free at 6 months (PFS6m). The secondary end points were feasibility, tumour response, overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs). The correlative objective was to assess biomarkers and correlate with clinical outcome.  Results:   We recruited 55 eligible participants from September 2010 to August 2012.  Demographics:   mean age 61, 71% male, favourable risk 16%, intermediate risk 84%. Cycle 2 commenced within 14 weeks for 80% of participants; 64% received ≥22 weeks of alternating therapy; 78% received ≥22 weeks of any treatment. PFS6m was 29/55 (53%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 40% to 66%). Tumour response rate was 7/55 (13%; 95% CI 4% to 22%, all partial responses). After median follow-up of 20 months, 47 of 55 (86%) had progressed with a median progression-free survival of 8 months (95% CI 5-10), and 30 of 55 (55%) had died with a median OS of 17 months (95% CI 12-undefined). AEs were consistent with those expected for each single agent. No convincing prognostic biomarkers were identified.  Conclusions:   The EVERSUN regimen was feasible and safe, but its activity did not meet pre-specified values to warrant further research.

In benign prostate glands, SEC14L1 immunostaining was absent or weak. In prostate cancer, SEC14L1 positivity was found in 80% of 9876 interpretable tumors including 9% with strong, 38% with moderate, and 32% with weak immunostaining.

Comparative analysis of SEC14L1 expression in TMPSSR2:ERG-positive and -negative cancers suggested a different role of SEC14L1 in the 2 subsets: in TMPSSR2:ERG-negative cancers, strong SEC14L1 expression was associated with early prostate-specific antigen recurrence (P = .0270), advanced tumor stage (P = .0042), high Gleason score (P < .0001), and high preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels (P = .0035).

We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244.  Findings:   From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 1560 were randomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8·4 months (IQR 3·7-16·6). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% CI 13·1-14·9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<0·0001). After a median follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 14·2-25·4), median overall survival was 31·4 months (95% CI 28·6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29·5 months (27·0-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·08; p=0·31). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone.  Interpretation:   In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone.

The system plays a critical role in patient counselling and treatment decision making because the staging system conveys prognosis.  Methods:   Many issues may be considered when deciding the preferred system (i.e. old or new), such as the level of evidence for one or more factors included in the system or the general opinions of expert clinicians. However, given the major objective of estimating prognosis on an ordinal scale, we argue that the rival staging system candidates should be compared on their ability to predict outcome. We sought to outline an algorithm that would compare two rival ordinal systems on their predictive ability.  Results:   We devised an algorithm based largely on the concordance index, which is appropriate for comparing two models in their ability to rank observations. We demonstrate our algorithm with a prostate cancer staging system example.  Conclusion:   We have provided an algorithm for selecting the preferred staging system based on prognostic accuracy.

Approved and emerging drugs targeting the mTOR pathway have positively affected the clinical landscape. Recently, activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), belonging to the TGFβ receptor family, has been reported as an emerging target for antiangiogenic cancer therapy. Here, we describe a novel orally efficacious compound, P7170, that inhibits mTORC1/mTORC2/ALK1 activity with a potent cell growth inhibition. In cell-based assays, P7170 strongly inhibited (IC50 < 10 nmol/L) the phosphorylation of p70S6K (T389) and pAKT (S473). In many cancer cell lines, such as prostate, ovarian, colon, and renal, P7170 treatment resulted in marked cell growth inhibition. Furthermore, it induced G1-S cell-cycle arrest and autophagy. In vitro HUVEC tube formation, in vivo Matrigel plug, and rat aorta ring assays demonstrated that P7170 exhibited significant antiangiogenic activity. In addition, ALK1 knockdown studies in HUVEC confirmed that the antiangiogenic activity of P7170 was primarily due to ALK1 inhibition. Strong inhibition of ALK1 in addition to mTORC1/mTORC2 differentiates P7170 in its mechanism of action in comparison with existing inhibitors. In vivo mouse xenograft studies revealed P7170 to exhibit a significant dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in a broad range of human tumor types when administered orally at 10 to 20 mg/kg doses. The distinctive pharmacological profile with favorable pharmacokinetic parameters and in vivo efficacy makes P7170 an attractive candidate for clinical development.

The present study has examined the response of the PC3 human metastatic prostate cancer cell line following repeated low-dose pheophorbide a treatments, mimicking non-optimal PDT treatment. The analysis was focused on the NF-kB/YY1/RKIP circuitry as it is (i) dysregulated in cancer cells, (ii) modulated by NO and (iii) correlated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We hypothesized that a repeated treatment of non-optimal PDT induces low levels of NO that lead to cell growth and EMT via the regulation of the above circuitry.

Here, we report a novel tumor-suppressive locus on human chromosome 15q23 that contains two multiexonic lncRNA genes of 100 kb each: DRAIC (LOC145837) and the recently reported PCAT29. The DRAIC lncRNA was identified from RNA-seq data and is downregulated as prostate cancer cells progress from an androgen-dependent (AD) to a castration-resistant (CR) state. Prostate cancers persisting in patients after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) select for decreased DRAIC expression, and higher levels of DRAIC in prostate cancer are associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS). Androgen induced androgen receptor (AR) binding to the DRAIC locus and repressed DRAIC expression. In contrast, FOXA1 and NKX3-1 are recruited to the DRAIC locus to induce DRAIC, and FOXA1 specifically counters the repression of DRAIC by AR. The decrease of FOXA1 and NKX3-1, and aberrant activation of AR, thus accounts for the decrease of DRAIC during prostate cancer progression to the CR state. Consistent with DRAIC being a good prognostic marker, DRAIC prevents the transformation of cuboidal epithelial cells to fibroblast-like morphology and prevents cellular migration and invasion. A second tumor-suppressive lncRNA PCAT29, located 20 kb downstream of DRAIC, is regulated identically by AR and FOXA1 and also suppresses cellular migration and metastasis. Finally, based on TCGA analysis, DRAIC expression predicts good prognosis in a wide range of malignancies, including bladder cancer, low-grade gliomas, lung adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, renal clear cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, skin melanoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma.  Implications:   This study reveals a novel tumor-suppressive locus encoding two hormone-regulated lncRNAs, DRAIC and PCAT29, that are prognostic for a wide variety of cancer types.""","""['Kouhei Sakurai', 'Brian J Reon', 'Jordan Anaya', 'Anindya Dutta']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['The lncRNA PCAT29 inhibits oncogenic phenotypes in prostate cancer.', 'Long Noncoding RNA DRAIC Inhibits Prostate Cancer Progression by Interacting with IKK to Inhibit NF-κB Activation.', 'Androgens induce a distinct response of epithelial-mesenchymal transition factors in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Long noncoding RNA in prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.', 'Current Insights into Long Non-Coding RNAs (LncRNAs) in Prostate Cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis to long non-coding RNA-mediated high expression of GNG5 correlates with better prognosis and tumor immune infiltration of colon carcinoma.', 'Identification of androgen response-related lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cytomorphology and Gene Expression Signatures of Anchorage-independent Aggregations of Oral Cancer Cells.', 'Functional Characterization of lncRNA152 as an Angiogenesis-Inhibiting Tumor Suppressor in Triple-Negative Breast Cancers.']"""

Mortality rates in the USA (APC: -2.9 %; 2004-2010), Canada (APC: -2.9 %; 2006-2011) and England (APC: -2.6 %; 2003-2008) decreased at a faster rate compared with Australia (APC: -1.7 %; 1997-2011). In 2010, mortality rates were highest in England and Australia (23.8/100,000 in both countries). The mortality gap between Australia and USA grew from 1994 to 2010, with a total of 10,895 excess prostate cancer deaths in Australia compared with US rates over 17 preceding years.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer incidence rates are likely heavily influenced by prostate-specific antigen testing, but the fall in mortality occurred too soon to be solely a result of testing. Greater emphasis should be placed on addressing system-wide differences in the management of prostate cancer to reduce the number of men dying from this disease.""","""['E Feletto', 'A Bang', 'D Cole-Clark', 'V Chalasani', 'K Rasiah', 'D P Smith']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates and trends in the United States and Canada.', 'Prostate-cancer mortality in the USA and UK in 1975-2004: an ecological study.', 'Patterns and trends in prostate cancer incidence, survival, prevalence and mortality.

Materials and methods:   In ERSPC Rotterdam men 55 to 74 years old were randomized to a screening arm of 21,210 and a control arm of 21,166. Treatment after diagnosis was at the discretion of the care provider chosen by the patient. Initial treatment was compared in 4 risk groups. The relation between prostate cancer incidence and prostate cancer mortality was assessed by risk group by correlating the incidence RR and the mortality RR. A direct relation would have supported a stage shift as the main cause of changes in prostate cancer mortality.  Results:   Initial treatment differed between the arms in the low, intermediate and high risk groups but not in the metastatic group. The RRs of prostate cancer incidence and mortality per risk group were related 1:1 (regression line slope 1.00, 95% CI 0.30-1.74). Of changes in prostate cancer mortality 94% could be explained by changes in prostate cancer incidence. This made treatment differences unlikely as the reason for the observed decrease in prostate cancer mortality.  Conclusions:   Differences in treatment between the ERSPC Rotterdam screening and control arms were unlikely to explain the differences in prostate cancer mortality. Results are instead consistent with a decrease in prostate cancer mortality as the result of a favorable stage through screening.""","""['Leonard P Bokhorst', 'Lionne D F Venderbos', 'Fritz H Schröder', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Ewout W Steyerberg', 'Monique J Roobol']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Interval cancers in prostate cancer screening: comparing 2- and 4-year screening intervals in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Gothenburg and Rotterdam.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Biochemical progression rates in the screen arm compared to the control arm of the Rotterdam Section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Disease-specific survival of men with prostate cancer detected during the screening interval: results of the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer-Rotterdam after 11 years of follow-up.', 'Landmarks in prostate cancer screening.', 'Prostate cancer screening in Europe and Asia.', 'Correlation between stage shift and differences in mortality in the European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the long-term safety and antitumor activity of enzalutamide in CRPC patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   This phase 1-2 study evaluated enzalutamide in 140 CRPC patients with and without prior chemotherapy. Initial findings were published in 2010. We report updated results from an additional 17-mo follow-up for antitumor activity and >4 yr for safety.  Intervention:   Patients received 30-600mg/d oral enzalutamide. During long-term dosing, all patients were switched first to the maximum tolerated dose of 240mg/d and then to the phase 3 dose of 160mg/d.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Safety was assessed regularly. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distributions of time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression and time to radiographic progression.  Results and limitations:   The safety profile of enzalutamide was consistent over time, with little change in the rates of commonly reported adverse events (AEs) or the incidence of grade 3/4 AEs. Fatigue of any grade was the most common dose-dependent AE, experienced by 70% of patients, with 14% of patients reporting grade 3/4 fatigue. The median time to PSA progression was not reached for chemotherapy-naive patients and was 45 wk for postchemotherapy patients; the corresponding median time to radiographic progression was 56 wk and 25 wk.  Conclusions:   Enzalutamide showed durable antitumor activity in chemotherapy-naive and postchemotherapy patients, and was well tolerated, even in patients treated for 4 yr.  Patient summary:   Enzalutamide was active against prostate cancer and was well tolerated, even for up to 4 yr of treatment, supporting its potential for long-term use in men with prostate cancer.

The limitations of most clinical studies have been poor validation of [(11)C]choline PET/CT-positive findings and lack of survival analysis. The aim of this study was to assess whether [(11)C]choline PET/CT can predict survival in hormone-naive PCa patients with biochemical failure.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 302 hormone-naive PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy who underwent [(11)C]choline PET/CT from 1 December 2004 to 31 July 2007 because of biochemical failure (prostate-specific antigen, PSA, >0.2 ng/mL). Median PSA was 1.02 ng/mL. PCa-specific survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between clinicopathological variables and PCa-specific survival. The coefficients of the covariates included in the Cox regression analysis were used to develop a novel nomogram.  Results:   Median follow-up was 7.2 years (1.4 - 18.9 years). [(11)C]Choline PET/CT was positive in 101 of 302 patients (33%). Median PCa-specific survival after prostatectomy was 14.9 years (95% CI 9.7 - 20.1 years) in patients with positive [(11)C]choline PET/CT. Median survival was not achieved in patients with negative [(11)C]choline PET/CT. The 15-year PCa-specific survival probability was 42.4% (95% CI 31.7 - 53.1%) in patients with positive [(11)C]choline PET/CT and 95.5% (95% CI 93.5 - 97.5 %) in patients with negative [(11)C]choline PET/CT.

About 77% of all cancers are diagnosed in persons aged 55 years and older. Cancer and its treatment can cause diverse sequelae impacting body systems underlying balance control. No study has examined the psychometric properties of balance assessment tools in older cancer survivors, presenting a significant challenge in the selection of outcome measures for clinicians treating this fast-growing population.  Purpose:   This study aimed to determine the reliability, validity, and minimal detectable change (MDC) of the Balance Evaluation System Test (BESTest), Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest), and Brief-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Brief-BESTest) in community-dwelling older cancer survivors.  Methods:   This study was a cross-sectional design. Twenty breast and 8 prostate cancer survivors participated [age (SD) = 68.4 (8.13) years]. The BESTest and Activity-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale were administered during the first session. Scores of Mini-BESTest and Brief-BESTest were extracted on the basis of the scores of BESTest. The BESTest was repeated within 1 to 2 weeks by the same rater to determine the test-retest reliability. For the analysis of the inter-rater reliability, 21 participants were randomly selected to be evaluated by 2 raters. A primary rater administered the test. The 2 raters independently and concurrently scored the performance of the participants. Each rater recorded the ratings separately on the scoring sheet. No discussion among the raters was allowed throughout the testing. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard error of measurement, minimal detectable change (MDC), and Bland-Altman plots were calculated. Concurrent validity of these balance tests with the ABC Scale was examined using the Spearman correlation.  Results:   The BESTest, Mini-BESTest, and Brief-BESTest had high test-retest (ICC = 0.90-0.94) and interrater reliability (ICC = 0.86-0.96), small standard error of measurement (0.86-2.47 points), and MDC (2.39-6.86 points). The Bland-Altman plot revealed no systematic errors. The scores of BESTest, Mini-BEST, and Brief-BEST were correlated significantly with those of ABC Scale (P < .01), supporting their concurrent validity.  Discussion:   The BESTest, Mini-BESTest, and Brief-BESTest showed high interrater and test-retest reliability, and excellent concurrent validity with the ABC Scale for community-dwelling cancer survivors aged 55 years and older who had completed cancer treatments for at least 3 months.

Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Epithelial cell adhesion molecule results in shedding of the extracellular domain (EpEx) and release of its intracellular domain (Ep-ICD) which triggers oncogenic signaling and might correlate to tumor aggressiveness. This study aimed to explore the potential of Ep-ICD and EpEx to identify PCa that have poor prognosis.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical analysis of Ep-ICD and EpEx was carried out in normal prostate tissues (n = 100), benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH, n = 83), and prostate cancer (n = 249) using domain specific antibodies. The expression of Ep-ICD and EpEx was correlated with clinico- pathological parameters and disease free survival (DFS).  Results:   Reduced expression of nuclear Ep-ICD and membrane EpEx was observed in PCa in comparison with BPH and normal prostate tissues (p = 0.006, p < 0.001 respectively). For patients who had PCa with Gleason Score less than 7, preserved nuclear Ep-ICD emerged as the most significant marker in multivariate analysis for prolonged DFS, where these patients did not have recurrence during follow up of up to 12 years (p = 0.001).  Conclusion:   Reduced expression of nuclear Ep-ICD was associated with shorter disease free survival in patients with a Gleason Score less than 7 and may be useful in identifying patients likely to have aggressive tumors with poor prognosis.

Materials and methods:   The SEER-Medicare linked database was used to assess the relationship between treatment type and toxicity among men with low risk prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or combined therapy between 2004 and 2007. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was utilized to minimize selection bias and control for confounding. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship between treatment and outcomes.  Results:   Overall 1915 (43.9%), 1893 (43.4%), and 555 (12.7%) patients were treated with EBRT, BT, and combined therapy, respectively. In univariate analyses, combined modality radiation was more toxic than BT alone for GU incontinence (56.76% versus 49.08%), GU obstruction (21.26% versus 19.70%), and erectile dysfunction (22.52% versus 22.24%) (p < 0.01, all comparisons). Compared to EBRT alone, combined modality radiation was more toxic for GI bleeding (7.21% versus 6.21%), GU incontinence (56.76% versus 29.24%), GU obstruction (21.26% versus 14.15%), and erectile dysfunction (22.52% versus 15.35%) (p < 0.01, all comparisons). Among the most frequent radiation toxicity events, the probability of treatment associated toxicity was highest for patients receiving combined modality treatment and lowest for the group treated with EBRT. After multivariate adjustment, EBRT alone demonstrated protective effects against GU obstruction (OR 0.56 [CI 0.50-0.63]), GI bleeding (OR 0.57 [CI 0.48-0.67]), GU incontinence (OR 0.39 [CI 0.36-0.43]), and erectile dysfunction (OR 0.68 [CI 0.61-0.76]) when compared to combined therapy.  Conclusions:   The use of combined modality radiation therapy in low risk prostate cancer patients is discordant with clinical guidelines and associated with a significantly increased burden of associated toxicity when compared to EBRT monotherapy. Prudent patient selection and judicious use of combined therapy among men with low risk prostate cancer represents a targetable area to reduce the burden of overtreatment.""","""['Renjian Jiang', 'Jeffrey J Tomaszewski', 'Kevin C Ward', 'Robert G Uzzo', 'Daniel J Canter']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'ASCENDE-RT: An Analysis of Treatment-Related Morbidity for a Randomized Trial Comparing a Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Boost with a Dose-Escalated External Beam Boost for High- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Second analysis to determine the correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Canadian Urological Association guideline on male urethral stricture.', 'Observations and outcomes of urethroplasty for bulbomembranous stenosis after radiation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   All patients had advanced prostate cancer with normal testosterone levels before treatment and indication for long term castration. Treatment started with one LHRH analog injection (to induce a fast drop of testosterone) followed by irradiation to the whole scrotum. Two fractionation regimens were tested: 17 Gy in 2 fractions, and 24 Gy in 3 fractions. Hormonal blood evaluation was performed before and every 3 months after radiotherapy. Toxicity was evaluated at each visit by the CTCv3 scoring system. This was an IRB approved prospective study.  Results:   The first three patients received 17 Gy in 2 fractions. None of them developed acute or late skin toxicity and none became castrated, keeping normal levels of testosterone during the time they were followed at 11, 24 and 36 months post-radiotherapy.

Using LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines, we showed that chemical or shRNA-mediated inhibition of ASCT2 function in vitro decreases glutamine uptake, cell cycle progression through E2F transcription factors, mTORC1 pathway activation and cell growth. Chemical inhibition also reduces basal oxygen consumption and fatty acid synthesis, showing that downstream metabolic function is reliant on ASCT2-mediated glutamine uptake. Furthermore, shRNA knockdown of ASCT2 in PC-3 cell xenografts significantly inhibits tumour growth and metastasis in vivo, associated with the down-regulation of E2F cell cycle pathway proteins.

These include the selective androgen receptor modulators cyproterone acetate and hydroxyflutamide and the complete antagonist bicalutamide. Their activity is partly dictated by the presence of androgen receptor mutations, which are commonly detected in patients who relapse while receiving antiandrogens, i.e. in castrate-resistant prostate cancer. To characterize the early proteomic response to these antiandrogens we used the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, which harbors the androgen receptor mutation most commonly detected in castrate-resistant tumors (T877A), analyzing alterations in the proteome, and comparing these to the effect of these therapeutics upon androgen receptor activity and cell proliferation. The majority are regulated post-transcriptionally, possibly via nongenomic androgen receptor signaling. Differences detected between the exposure groups demonstrate subtle changes in the biological response to each specific ligand, suggesting a spectrum of agonistic and antagonistic effects dependent on the ligand used. Analysis of the crystal structures of the AR in the presence of cyproterone acetate, hydroxyflutamide, and DHT identified important differences in the orientation of key residues located in the AF-2 and BF-3 protein interaction surfaces. This further implies that although there is commonality in the growth responses between androgens and those antiandrogens that stimulate growth in the presence of a mutation, there may also be influential differences in the growth pathways stimulated by the different ligands. This therefore has implications for prostate cancer treatment because tumors may respond differently dependent upon which mutation is present and which ligand is activating growth, also for the design of selective androgen receptor modulators, which aim to elicit differential proteomic responses dependent upon cellular context.""","""['Greg N Brooke', 'Simon C Gamble', 'Michael A Hough', 'Shajna Begum', 'D Alwyn Dart', 'Michael Odontiadis', 'Sue M Powell', 'Flavia M Fioretti', 'Rosie A Bryan', 'Jonathan Waxman', 'Robin Wait', 'Charlotte L Bevan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cell Proteomics""","""['Effects of steroidal and non-steroidal antiandrogens on wild-type and mutant androgen receptors.', 'Corepressive function of nuclear receptor coactivator 2 in androgen receptor of prostate cancer cells treated with antiandrogen.', 'The androgen receptor T877A mutant recruits LXXLL and FXXLF peptides differently than wild-type androgen receptor in a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay.', 'Antiandrogens: selective androgen receptor modulators.', 'Antiandrogens in prostate cancer endocrine therapy.', 'Comparative Proteomic and Transcriptomic Analysis of the Impact of Androgen Stimulation and Darolutamide Inhibition.', 'A Systematic Comparison of Antiandrogens Identifies Androgen Receptor Protein Stability as an Indicator for Treatment Response.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.', 'The antiandrogen enzalutamide downregulates TMPRSS2 and reduces cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells.', 'The Effects of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Biomarkers of Inflammation Produced by Lipopolysaccharide Stimulated RAW264.7 Macrophages.']"""

The main analytical characteristics of the method were obtained. The results permit to consider the prototype of the test-system as a promising instrument for clinical application. The test-system prototype was tested using blood serum samples of oncological patients (252 samples) and healthy donors (185 samples). Increased concentrations of one or more tumor markers above the normal level were found in 76.6% cases of oncological patients and only in 6% cases of healthy donors. For colorectal cancer patients group, application of modern statistical methods of data-processing in medical researchers, i.e. ROC-analysis and logistic regression, indicted that the simultaneous assay of nine tumor markers on biochips showed much more diagnostic significance (area under the ROC-curve (AUC) reached 0.84) than traditional assay of 2 tumor markers, CEA and CA 19-9 (AUC = 0.59).

The purpose of this study was to examine perioperative and pathologic outcomes of SRP in a national cohort.  Materials and methods:   The National Cancer Database from 1998 to 2011 was used to identify 408 patients who underwent SRP. We evaluated the demographic data, clinical variables, and pathologic and perioperative outcomes. Primary outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS) and positive surgical margins (PSM). A multivariable logistic regression model was employed to identify preoperative predictors of LOS ≥ 3 days and PSM following SRP.  Results:   Among patients undergoing SRP, the mean age was 62.5 ± 6.8 years, mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 12.6 ± 15.6 ng/ml, and 64% were categorized as clinical stage T1. External beam RT (89%), followed by brachytherapy (11%), was the most common modalities for primary RT. Most SRPs were performed at high-volume centers (57%) in metropolitan locations (83%). Most patients underwent a lymph node dissection (75%) and the mean node count was 15.0 ± 30.1. On final pathology, 73% had intermediate- or high-grade disease (Gleason score 7 in 43% and Gleason score 8-10 in 30%), 49% had pT3 or pT4 disease, 6.2% had positive lymph nodes, and 34% had PSM. The mean LOS was 3.5 ± 9.9 days, and 43% of patients had a LOS ≥ 3 days. The 30-day readmission rate was 6.5% after SRP, and 30- and 90-day postoperative mortality rates were extremely low at 0.4% (n = 1). On multivariable analysis of the entire cohort, PSA level > 20 ng/ml was an independent predictor of PSM (OR = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.2-10.9, P = 0.018). PSA level > 20 ng/ml (OR = 4.37, 95% CI: 1.2-16.2, P = 0.027) and cT2 or greater disease (OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.0-6.2, P = 0.046) were associated with prolonged LOS (LOS ≥ 3d), whereas surgery at an academic facility (OR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.1-0.8, P = 0.02) reduced the odds of LOS ≥ 3 days.  Conclusions:   In select patients derived from a population-based cohort, SRP results in effective local cancer control with acceptable perioperative outcomes. PSA level > 20 ng/ml is independently associated with PSM and prolonged LOS after SRP. Clinical stage T2 or greater disease is also associated with prolonged LOS, whereas surgery at an academic facility reduced this risk.""","""['Shane M Pearce', 'Kyle A Richards', 'Sanjay G Patel', 'Joseph J Pariser', 'Scott E Eggener']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Prognostic parameters, complications, and oncologic and functional outcome of salvage radical prostatectomy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after 21st-century radiotherapy.', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Cancer control and functional outcomes of salvage radical prostatectomy for radiation-recurrent prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Salvage radical prostatectomy as management of locally recurrent prostate cancer: outcomes and complications.', 'Salvage Radical Prostatectomy for Radio-Recurrent Prostate Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review of Oncologic, Histopathologic and Functional Outcomes and Predictors of Good Response.', 'The association between the outcomes of extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and the anthropometric measurements of the prostate by magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Management Options for Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Radiotherapy After Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, it provides only a modest increase in survival and is associated with significant toxicity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify potential adjunct therapies. Given the key role of autophagy in both tumour survival and chemoresistance, the impact of autophagy modulation on docetaxel toxicity was tested in vitro. PC-3 and LNCaP cells were pre-treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (5 mM) and then exposed to various concentrations (0-100 μM) of docetaxel. Cytoxic effects of docetaxel were measured using resazurin reduction to resorufin, whilst autophagy and apoptosis was measured using monodansylcadaverine, annexin V and caspase-3, respectively. Docetaxel produced significant toxicity in PC-3 cells but was not toxic to LNCaP cells. Pre-treatment with the autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (5 mM) significantly protected PC-3 cells against docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity, increased autophagosome formation and apoptosis measured using monodansylcadaverine, annexin V and caspase-3 fluorescence, respectively.

Concordance of CTC counts with OR revealed a sensitivity of 83.3-87.5 % and a specificity of 68.0-76.5 % with complementary discriminatory power for OS. Comparing CTC counts with concomitant OR at q4 in multivariate analyses, an independent prognostic value for OS was found for CTC counts (HR 3.3; p = 0.02) similar to clinical (HR 4.9; p = 0.02) and radiologic response (HR 3.4; p = 0.051). Comparing the predictive value for death, early post-treatment CTC counts at q1 demonstrated significant accuracy with an area under the curve of 79.5 % (p = 0.004) similar to CTC counts at q4 (76.7 %; p = 0.009). Radiologic and clinical response at q4 displayed accuracy similar to early CTC counts at q1 (72.2 %; p = 0.03 and 75.0 %; p = 0.02) despite low sensitivities.

As a consequence, the survival of residual CSCs is thought to drive the onset of tumor recurrence, distant metastasis, and drug-resistance, which is a significant clinical problem for the effective treatment of cancer. Thus, novel approaches to cancer therapy are needed urgently, to address this clinical need. Towards this end, here we have investigated the therapeutic potential of graphene oxide to target cancer stem cells. Graphene and its derivatives are well-known, relatively inert and potentially non-toxic nano-materials that form stable dispersions in a variety of solvents. Here, we show that graphene oxide (of both big and small flake sizes) can be used to selectively inhibit the proliferative expansion of cancer stem cells, across multiple tumor types. For this purpose, we employed the tumor-sphere assay, which functionally measures the clonal expansion of single cancer stem cells under anchorage-independent conditions. More specifically, we show that graphene oxide effectively inhibits tumor-sphere formation in multiple cell lines, across 6 different cancer types, including breast, ovarian, prostate, lung and pancreatic cancers, as well as glioblastoma (brain). In striking contrast, graphene oxide is non-toxic for ""bulk"" cancer cells (non-stem) and normal fibroblasts. Mechanistically, we present evidence that GO exerts its striking effects on CSCs by inhibiting several key signal transduction pathways (WNT, Notch and STAT-signaling) and thereby inducing CSC differentiation.

This study considers the association between metformin and the incidence, mortality and recurrence of prostate cancer by performing a meta-analysis of observational studies.  Methods:   Literatures published before January 2014 were searched by using databases of PubMed and Embase. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were determined using a random effects model to evaluate the strength of association between metformin therapy and risk of prostate cancer.  Results:   Thirteen studies involving a total of 334 532 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, metformin therapy was associated with significantly decreased incidence of prostate cancer [RR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.78, 0.99], p = 0.03, I(2) = 74.7%]. However, metformin therapy was not associated with decreased all-cause mortality (RR = 1.07, 95% CI [0.86, 1.32], p = 0.55, I(2) = 58.2%) or decreased recurrence of prostate cancer (RR = 0.90, 95% CI [0.75, 1.09], p = 0.27, I(2) = 0.0%). No publication bias was detected (pBegg = 0.55, pEgger = 0.46).

The Hippo pathway has recently been shown to be an evolutionarily conserved regulator of tissue growth, and its perturbation can trigger tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that genetic variants of the Hippo pathway may influence clinical outcomes in localized prostate cancer patients. We genotyped 53 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from seven core Hippo pathway genes in 246 localized prostate cancer patients treated with RP. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to identify significant SNPs that correlated with BCR. For replication, five associated SNPs were genotyped in an independent cohort of 212 patients. After adjusting for known clinicopathologic factors, the association between STK3 rs7827435 and BCR (P = 0.018) was replicated in the second stage (P = 0.026; Pcombined = 0.001). Additional integrated in silico analysis provided evidence that rs7827435 affects STK3 expression, which in turn is significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis.

Such networks can be decomposed into smaller modules, also known as network motifs. These motifs show interesting dynamical behaviors, in which co-operativity effects between the motif components play a critical role in human diseases. We have developed a motif-searching algorithm, which is able to identify common motif types from the cancer networks and signal transduction networks (STNs). Some of the network motifs are interconnected which can be merged together and form more complex structures, the so-called coupled motif structures (CMS). These structures exhibit mixed dynamical behavior, which may lead biological organisms to perform specific functions.  Results:   In this study, we integrate transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs), miRNA targets and network motifs information to build the cancer-related TF-miRNA-motif networks (TMMN). This allows us to examine the role of network motifs in cancer formation at different levels of regulation, i.e. transcription initiation (TF → miRNA), gene-gene interaction (CMS), and post-transcriptional regulation (miRNA → target genes). Among the cancer networks and STNs we considered, it is found that there is a substantial amount of crosstalking through motif interconnections, in particular, the crosstalk between prostate cancer network and PI3K-Akt STN.To validate the role of network motifs in cancer formation, several examples are presented which demonstrated the effectiveness of the present approach. A web-based platform has been set up which can be accessed at: http://ppi.bioinfo.asia.edu.tw/pathway/.

Materials and methods:   We previously developed partial wave spectroscopic microscopy (PWS) that enables quantification of the nanoscale intracellular architecture (20-200 nm length scale) with remarkable accuracy. We adapted this technique to assess prostate needle core biopsies in a case control study from men with Gleason 6 disease who either progressed (n = 20) or remained indolent (n = 18) over a ~3 year follow up. We measured the parameter disorder strength (Ld) characterizing the spatial heterogeneity of the nanoscale cellular structure and nuclear morphology from the microscopically normal mucosa ~150 histologically normal epithelial cells.  Results:   There was a profound increase in nano-architectural disorder between progressors and non-progressors. Indeed, the Ld from future progressors was dramatically increased when compared to future non-progressors (1±0.065 versus 1.30±0.0614, respectively p = 0.002). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.79, yielding a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 72% for discriminating between progressors and non-progressors. This was not confounded by demographic factors (age, smoking status, race, obesity), thus supporting the robustness of the approach.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate, for the first time, that nano-architectural alterations occur in prostate cancer field carcinogenesis and can be exploited to predict prognosis of early stage PCa.

Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, we identified prostate cancer patients diagnosed during 1995-2007 who had one or more adverse pathological features after prostatectomy. The final cohort of 6,137 eligible patients included men who received prostatectomy alone (n = 4,509) or with adjuvant (n = 894) or salvage (n = 734) radiation therapy. Primary outcomes were genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and erectile dysfunction events and survival after treatment(s).  Results:   Radiation therapy after prostatectomy was associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal and genitourinary events, but not erectile dysfunction. In adjusted models, earlier treatment with adjuvant radiation therapy was not associated with increased rates of genitourinary or erectile dysfunction events compared to delayed salvage radiation therapy. Early adjuvant radiation therapy was associated with lower rates of gastrointestinal events that salvage radiation therapy, with hazard ratios of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.95) for procedure-defined and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59, 0.83) for diagnosis-defined events.

Conclusions:   Radiation therapy after prostatectomy is associated with increased rates of gastrointestinal and genitourinary events.

Recent in vitro studies on breast and prostate cancer cells have shown that inducible NOS (iNOS) along with NO is dramatically upregulated after an ALA-PDT-like challenge. Cells were more resistant to apoptosis after a photochallenge and survivors grew, migrated, and invaded more rapidly, iNOS/NO playing a key role in all these effects.

Despite the strong regulation of metastases development by a cell dormancy phenomenon, the dormant state of cancer cells remains poorly characterized due to the difficulty of in vivo studies. We have recently shown in vitro that clonogenicity of prostate cancer cells is regulated by a dormancy phenomenon that is strongly induced when cells are cultured both at low cell density and in a slightly hypertonic medium. Here, we characterized by RT-qPCR a genetic expression signature of this dormant state which combines the presence of both stemness and differentiation markers. We showed that both TFGβ/BMP signaling and redox imbalance are required for the full induction of this dormancy signature and cell quiescence. Moreover, reconstruction experiments showed that TFGβ/BMP signaling and redox imbalance are sufficient to generate a pattern of genetic expression displaying all characteristic features of the dormancy signature. Finally, we observed that low cell density was sufficient to activate TGFβ/BMP signaling and to generate a slight redox imbalance thus priming cells for dormancy that can be attained with a co-stimulus like hypertonicity, most likely through an increased redox imbalance. The identification of a dual regulation of dormancy provides a framework for the interpretation of previous reports showing a restricted ability of BMP signaling to regulate cancer cell dormancy in vivo and draws attention on the role of oxidative stress in the metastatic process.""","""['Anh Thu Bui', 'Fanny Laurent', 'Maryline Havard', 'François Dautry', 'Thierry Tchénio']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Transient exposure to androgens induces a remarkable self-sustained quiescent state in dispersed prostate cancer cells.', 'Discovery of a natural small-molecule compound that suppresses tumor EMT, stemness and metastasis by inhibiting TGFβ/BMP signaling in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Exploration of Shh and BMP paracrine signaling in a prostate cancer xenograft.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins.', 'Few Smad proteins and many Smad-interacting proteins yield multiple functions and action modes in TGFβ/BMP signaling in vivo.', 'Cancer cell plasticity during tumor progression, metastasis and response to therapy.', 'Tumor microenvironment in non-melanoma skin cancer resistance to photodynamic therapy.', 'Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates self-sustained quiescence, tumor indolence, and late clinical metastasis in a Beclin-1-dependent manner.', 'Modeling Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Induced Prostate Cancer Dormancy and Its Clinical Implications.', 'Redox Control of the Dormant Cancer Cell Life Cycle.']"""

T2 relaxation time measurements in the prostate are complicated by the structure of prostate tissue, which consists of fluid-filled glands surrounded by epithelial and stromal cells. Since the glands are large relative to diffusion distances, there is little water exchange between the two compartments and T2s are biexponential. Because the relative size and characteristics of the two compartments change in prostate tumors, accurate measurement of the characteristics of each may provide useful information on tumor grade.  Materials and methods:   T2s were measured in a group of 25 men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer. Subjects were scanned at 3T with a 16-echo turbo-spin echo T2-mapping sequence. Normal prostate T2s were measured in areas showing no disease. Optimum echo times for measurement of normal prostate T2s were found by calculating the covariance matrix, which provides estimates of parameter variance. Echo times that minimize T2 variance were then found by searching over grids of different echo times. Optima for four to eight echo acquisitions were found. Optima were tested by Monte Carlo simulation.  Results:   Fast and slow T2s were 60 msec and 360 msec, respectively. The fast signal fraction was 0.6. Optimum echo times were between 0 and 780 msec, depending on the number of echoes acquired.  Conclusion:   Use of optimum echo times can substantially improve the precision of biexponential T2 measurements.

HBC abrogated AR interaction with CaM, suppressed phosphorylation of AR Serine81, and blocked the binding of AR to androgen-response elements. RNA-Seq analysis identified 57 androgen-regulated genes whose expression was significantly (p ≤ 0.002) altered in HBC treated cells as compared to controls. Oncomine analysis revealed that genes repressed by HBC are those that are usually overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and genes stimulated by HBC are those that are often down-regulated in PCa, suggesting a reversing effect of HBC on androgen-regulated gene expression associated with PCa. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed a role of HBC affected genes in cellular functions associated with proliferation and survival.

We evaluated incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) and urothelial carcinoma (UCa) involvement of the prostate in cystoprostatectomy specimens.  Methods:   We analyzed 340 cystoprostatectomy specimens from patients who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy for the treatment of bladder cancer in China from 2004 to 2014. None of the patients had known prostate cancer prior to cystoprostatectomy.  Results:   Overall, 180 (53%) patients had either PCa or UCa in the prostate. We found that 95 (28%) had PCa and 115 (34%) had UCa involvement of prostate. The rate of incidental prostate cancer was 21% and 31%, respectively, from two study periods (2004-2008 and 2009-2014). Among the 95 patients with PCa, 19 (20%) had Gleason score of ≥7, nine (10%) had PCa tumor volume >0.5 cc, and eight (8.4%) had extracapsular extension. Of the 115 with prostatic UCa, 61 had prostatic urethra and/or periurethral prostatic duct involvement only, while 54 had prostatic stromal invasion. Age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.04, P = 0.001), increasing stage of bladder tumor (OR = 1.28, P = 0.005), multifocal tumors of bladder (OR = 3.22, P < 0.001), carcinoma in situ (CIS) in the bladder (OR = 5.52, P < 0.001), and bladder neck involvement (OR = 6.12, P < 0.001) were strongly associated with prostatic UCa.  Conclusions:   The rate of incidental PCa in cystoprostatectomy specimens in China has increased over the last decade.

In the present study we examined the differential expression pattern of adenosine receptors in the malignant and adjacent normal human prostate tissues.  Methods:   Prostate cancer tissue samples and adjacent normal tissues were obtained from 20 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and histopathological diagnosis was confirmed for each sample. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA and the mRNA expression levels of adenosine receptors were investigated by Taq-man real-time RT-PCR experiment. Quantitative protein analysis was done by Western blotting experiment. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression levels of adenosine receptors were measured after androgen treatment.  Result:   Taq-man real-time RT-PCR measurements show different expression levels of adenosine receptor transcripts. A2B adenosine receptor was predominantly expressed in tumor tissues (2.4-fold) followed by significantly expression of A3 (1.6-fold) and A2A adenosine receptors (1.5-fold) compared to adjacent normal tissues. The presence of adenosine receptors at protein levels in prostate cancer tissues compared with normal tissues was shown the following rank order: A2B > A3 > A2A > A1 . Androgen receptor regulates adenosine receptors mRNA and protein expression in AR-positive LNCaP cells, which was not seen in AR-negative PC-3 cells.  Conclusion:   These results indicated for the first time, the differential mRNA expression profile and protein levels of adenosine receptors in the human prostate cancer. Interestingly, the A2B adenosine receptor followed by A3 is highly expressed in prostate tumor samples in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues. The findings support the possible key role of A2B adenosine receptor in promoting cancer cell growth and suggest that A2B may be a novel target for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Samira Mousavi', 'Mojtaba Panjehpour', 'Mohammad Hossein Izadpanahi', 'Mahmoud Aghaei']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Methyltransferase inhibitor adenosine dialdehyde suppresses androgen receptor expression and prostate cancer growth.', 'Overexpression of high mobility group box 1 with poor prognosis in patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of estrogen receptor gene expression in laser microdissected prostate cancer tissue.', 'The effects of adenosine, interleukin-1 and theophylline on the expression of A2 adenosine receptor mRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from asthmatic patients.', 'Adenosine metabolism, immunity and joint health.', 'Targets of Immune Escape Mechanisms in Cancer: Basis for Development and Evolution of Cancer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.', 'Gene expression pattern of adenosine receptors in lung tumors.', 'A2B Adenosine Receptor Enhances Chemoresistance of Glioblastoma Stem-Like Cells under Hypoxia: New Insights into MRP3 Transporter Function.', 'The adenosine pathway in immuno-oncology.', 'Blockade of Adenosine A2b Receptor Reduces Tumor Growth and Migration in Renal Cell Carcinoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 184 patients with clinically high-risk PCa who underwent modified RP in a single Chinese center were retrospectively reviewed. Pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback was routinely performed after catheter removal. UC was defined as wearing 0 or 1 protective pad daily. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the predictors of UC recovery.  Results:   The median age at surgery was 69.5 years (range 48-82), and the median follow-up duration was 40 months (range 12-111). Only 40 patients (21.7%) received a nerve-sparing procedure. For patients with restored UC, the median time to continence was 1 month (range 1-24). UC recovery at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and the most recent follow-up was observed in 99 (53.8%), 158 (85.9%), 171 (92.9%) and 174 (94.6%) patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that patient age &lt; 70 years (hazard ratio 1.684, P = .003) and smaller prostate volume (hazard ratio 0.989, P = .036), but not the surgical approach or treatment with a nerve-sparing procedure, independently predicted UC recovery.  Conclusion:   Age &lt; 70 years and smaller prostate volume were independent predictors of UC recovery in clinically high-risk PCa patients. The adverse factors of high-risk disease were not significantly associated with UC recovery.

We aimed to determine whether long-term androgen deprivation was superior to short-term androgen deprivation when combined with high-dose radiotherapy.  Methods:   In this open-label, multicentre, phase 3 randomised controlled trial, patients were recruited from ten university hospitals throughout Spain. Eligible patients had clinical stage T1c-T3b N0M0 prostate adenocarcinoma with intermediate-risk and high-risk factors according to 2005 National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive either 4 months of androgen deprivation combined with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy at a minimum dose of 76 Gy (range 76-82 Gy; short-term androgen deprivation group) or the same treatment followed by 24 months of adjuvant androgen deprivation (long-term androgen deprivation group), stratified by prostate cancer risk group (intermediate risk vs high risk) and participating centre. Patients assigned to the short-term androgen deprivation group received 4 months of neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation with subcutaneous goserelin (2 months before and 2 months combined with high-dose radiotherapy). Anti-androgen therapy (flutamide 750 mg per day or bicalutamide 50 mg per day) was added during the first 2 months of treatment. Patients assigned to long-term suppression continued with the same luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue every 3 months for another 24 months. The primary endpoint was biochemical disease-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02175212.  Findings:   Between Nov 7, 2005, and Dec 20, 2010, 178 patients were randomly assigned to receive short-term androgen deprivation and 177 to receive long-term androgen deprivation. After a median follow-up of 63 months (IQR 50-82), 5-year biochemical disease-free survival was significantly better among patients receiving long-term androgen deprivation than among those receiving short-term treatment (90% [95% CI 87-92] vs 81% [78-85]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·88 [95% CI 1·12-3·15]; p=0·01). 5-year overall survival (95% [95% CI 93-97] vs 86% [83-89]; HR 2·48 [95% CI 1·31-4·68]; p=0·009) and 5-year metastasis-free survival (94% [95% CI 92-96] vs 83% [80-86]; HR 2·31 [95% CI 1·23-3·85]; p=0·01) were also significantly better in the long-term androgen deprivation group than in the short-term androgen deprivation group. The effect of long-term androgen deprivation on biochemical disease-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival was more evident in patients with high-risk disease than in those with low-risk disease. Grade 3 late rectal toxicity was noted in three (2%) of 177 patients in the long-term androgen deprivation group and two (1%) of 178 in the short-term androgen deprivation group; grade 3-4 late urinary toxicity was noted in five (3%) patients in each group. No deaths related to treatment were reported.  Interpretation:   Compared with short-term androgen deprivation, 2 years of adjuvant androgen deprivation combined with high-dose radiotherapy improved biochemical control and overall survival in patients with prostate cancer, particularly those with high-risk disease, with no increase in late radiation toxicity. Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether men with intermediate-risk disease benefit from more than 4 months of androgen deprivation.

For the entire 11-year period, prostate, lung, colorectal and bladder cancers were the most incident cancers among men. Among women, the overall world age-standardized rate increased from 180.6 cases per 100,000 in 1998-2002 to 217.1 cases per 100,000 in 2006-2008. Over the entire period, breast, colorectal, uterine and thyroid cancers were the most incident cancers in women. There were 16 sex-specific cancers showing statistically significantly increasing incidence trends over the study period and no types for which the rate was significantly decreasing. Thyroid cancer illustrated rapid increases in rates. Results were compared to other Mediterranean European registries using the Cancer Incidence in 5 Continents reports for 1997-2002. Overall cancer incidence in Cyprus is lower than that of many southern Mediterranean countries, and given the known environmental risk factors in Cyprus, the low rate of lung cancer is especially interesting. The epidemiologic patterns reported in this study open the door for future etiologic studies to elucidate the role of environmental and lifestyle factors in this population and highlight opportunities for cancer prevention and control.""","""['Mary Cooter', 'Amr S Soliman', 'Pavlos Pavlou', 'Anna Demetriou', 'Chloe Orphanides', 'Evie Kritioti', 'Mousumi Banerjee', 'Paraskevi A Farazi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Convergence of decreasing male and increasing female incidence rates in major tobacco-related cancers in Europe in 1988-2010.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'International variations and trends in renal cell carcinoma incidence and mortality.', 'Bladder Cancer Incidence and Mortality: A Global Overview and Recent Trends.', 'Knowledge and Attitudes of Cypriots on Melanoma Prevention: Is there a Public Health Concern?', 'Trends in Breast Cancer Incidence in Iraq During the Period 2000-2019.', 'Correlation Analysis of Breast and Thyroid Nodules: A Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Real-World Setting Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Comparing Three Therapeutic Schemes of One-Year Adjuvant Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer from the Cyprus NHS Payer Perspective.', 'Global Trends in Incidence Rates of Primary Adult Liver Cancers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

This cross-sectional study examines the sociodemographic and cancer-related predictors of PTG following a diagnosis of cancer. In addition, the relationships among adult attachment, health-related quality of life, and PTG are investigated. Measuring adult attachment is important because it can greatly influence the response to a highly distressing event, like facing cancer.  Methods and study design:   Immediately before undergoing radiotherapy, 152 patients with breast or prostate cancer (mean = 59.1 years old, SD = 10.7) who had received a positive diagnosis within an average of 3.5 months prior to treatment were tested for measures of PTG, adult attachment, and health-related quality of life. Patients also completed a questionnaire regarding medical and sociodemographic characteristics. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to reveal the significant predictors of PTG total score and PTG subscale scores.  Results:   Younger age was a significant predictor of the PTG total score and New Possibilities subscale score. Subjective severity of cancer was positively associated with the PTG total score and scores on the Appreciation of Life and New Possibilities subscales. Regarding health-related quality of life, analyses indicated that greater social/family well-being significantly predicted greater PTG total score and higher scores on the New Possibilities, Spiritual Change, Appreciation of Life, and Relating to Others subscales. Finally, dismissive attachment style predicted fewer scores on the Personal Strength and Relating to Others subscales.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that in addition to quality of life and adult attachment, sociodemographic and cancer-related variables may significantly contribute to positive growth.""","""['Zsuzsanna Tanyi', 'Kornélia Szluha', 'László Nemes', 'Sándor Kovács', 'Antal Bugán']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Posttraumatic growth among head and neck cancer survivors with psychological distress.', 'Predicting changes in posttraumatic growth and subjective well-being among breast cancer survivors: the role of social support and stress.', 'Post-traumatic growth and its relationship to quality of life up to 9 years after liver transplantation: a cross-sectional study in Spain.', 'Psychological and clinical correlates of posttraumatic growth in cancer: A systematic and critical review.', 'Post-traumatic growth in people living with a serious medical condition and its relations to physical and mental health: a systematic review.', 'Patient-Factors Influencing the 2-Year Trajectory of Mental and Physical Health in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Posttraumatic growth inventory: challenges with its validation among French cancer patients.', 'The Traumatic Experience of Breast Cancer: Which Factors Can Relate to the Post-traumatic Outcomes?', ""'Having cancer was awful but also something good came out': Post-traumatic growth among adult survivors of pediatric and adolescent cancer.""]"""

We aimed to translate the results of an own previous tissue-based miRNA profile of prostate carcinoma (PCa) with upregulated miR-183 and downregulated miR-205 into a urine-based testing procedure for diagnosis of PCa.  Methods:   Urine sediments were prepared from urine samples collected after a standardized digital-rectal examination (DRE) of patients undergoing prostate biopsy with PSA (prostate-specific antigen) values <20 μg/L in consecutive order. According to the sample-size calculation (α=0.05, power=0.95), 38 patients each with PCa and without PCa were randomly enrolled in this study. PCA3 (prostate cancer associated 3) in urine as Food and Drug Administration-approved assay was determined as reference standard for comparison. The miRNAs were measured by RT-qPCR using TaqMan assays and normalized using different approaches.  Results:   Both miRNAs were correlated to the mRNA PSA concentrations in the sediments indicating a relationship to the released prostate cells after DRE. However, they had no discriminating capacity between patients with and without PCa. In contrast, PCA3 clearly differentiated between these two patients groups. There was also no significant correlation between miRNAs and standard clinicopathologic variables like Gleason score and serum PSA.  Conclusions:   The data of our study show that miR-183 and miR-205 failed to detect early and aggressive PCa despite their highly dysregulated expression in cancer tissue. Our results and the critical evaluation of the few data of other studies raise serious doubts concerning the capability of urinary miRNAs to replace or improve PCA3 as predictive marker for prostate biopsy outcome.""","""['Carsten Stephan', 'Monika Jung', 'Silke Rabenhorst', 'Ergin Kilic', 'Klaus Jung']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Chem Lab Med""","""['Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'Diagnostic performance of expression of PCA3, Hepsin and miR biomarkers inejaculate in combination with serum PSA for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic value of PCA3 gene-based analysis of urine sediments after digital rectal examination for prostate cancer in a Chinese population.', 'Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 as a Tumour Marker: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Urinary MicroRNAs as Biomarkers of Urological Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'Downregulation of miRNA-205 Expression and Biological Mechanism in Prostate Cancer Tumorigenesis and Bone Metastasis.', 'Evaluation of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Diagnostic Markers in Urinary Cells from Patients with Suspected Prostate Cancer.', 'Liquid Biopsy Potential Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Treatment Response in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Here, we developed a circulating tumour cells (CTCs)-based assay to evaluate AR expression in real-time in CRPC and investigated nuclear AR expression in CTCs in patients treated with enzalutamide and abiraterone.  Methods:   CTCs were captured and characterised using the CellSearch system. An automated algorithm to identify CTCs and quantify AR expression was employed. The primary aim was to evaluate the association between CTC AR expression and prior treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Results:   AR expression in CTCs was evaluated in 94 samples from 48 metastatic CRPC patients. We observed large intra-patient heterogeneity of AR expression in CTCs. Prior exposure to abiraterone or enzalutamide was not associated with a change in CTCs AR expression (median intensity and distribution of AR-positive classes). In support of this, we also confirmed maintained nuclear AR expression in tissue samples collected after progression on abiraterone. AR staining also identified additional AR-positive CD45-negative circulating cells that were CK-negative/weak and therefore missed using standard protocols. The number of these events correlated with traditional CTCs and was associated with worse outcome on univariate analysis.  Conclusions:   We developed a non-invasive method to monitor AR nuclear expression in CTCs. Our studies confirm nuclear AR expression in CRPC patients progressing on novel endocrine treatments.

The aim of this study was to examine whether the expression of SFRP1 and β-catenin is associated with the clinical-pathologic features of patients with prostate cancer (PCa), and to evaluate their potential roles as predictive and prognostic biomarkers. In this study, a total of 61 patients with PCa and 10 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were included, and we showed that the expression of SFRP1 and β-catenin was correlated with the Gleason score, survival rate and response for endocrine therapy of PCa. The survival rates of PCa patients with low SFRP1 expression (P = 0.016) or high β-catenin expression (P = 0.004) were significantly poorer. A negative correlation (r = -0.275, P = 0.032) between SFRP1 and β-catenin was observed by Chi-square test. Multivariate analysis suggested that SFRP1 (hazard ratio, 0.429; 95% confidence intervals, 0.227-0.812; P = 0.009) may serve as an independent predictive and prognostic factor for PCa. We also showed that the protein and mRNA levels of SFRP1 in androgen-dependent PCa cell line LNCaP were significantly higher than those in androgen-independent PCa cell lines DU145 and PC3. However, the protein level of β-catenin in LNCaP cells was significantly lower than that in DU145 and PC3 cells, and no significant difference of β-catenin mRNA level was observed in LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells. Bisulfite sequencing PCR assay revealed significantly lower methylation level of SFRP1 promoter in LNCaP cells than that in DU145 and PC3 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that SFRP1, which expression inversely correlates with that of β-catenin, is a favorable predictive and prognostic biomarker.""","""['Lei Zheng', 'Dongchen Sun', 'Wentao Fan', 'Zhiwei Zhang', 'Quanlin Li', 'Tao Jiang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The Wnt antagonist sFRP1 as a favorable prognosticator in human biliary tract carcinoma.', 'SFRP1 repression in prostate cancer is triggered by two different epigenetic mechanisms.', 'Downregulation of SFRP1 is a protumorigenic event in hepatoblastoma and correlates with beta-catenin mutations.', 'Epigenetic inactivation of the canonical Wnt antagonist secreted frizzled-related protein 1 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'The association of CXCR4 expression with clinicopathological significance and potential drug target in prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'Region-specific denoising identifies spatial co-expression patterns and intra-tissue heterogeneity in spatially resolved transcriptomics data.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'A Review of Prostate Organogenesis and a Role for iPSC-Derived Prostate Organoids to Study Prostate Development and Disease.', 'SFRP1 increases TMPRSS2-ERG expression promoting neoplastic features in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'Differential expression of lung adenocarcinoma transcriptome with signature of tobacco exposure.']"""

High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) technology is of proven value in several indications, notably prostate cancer. Its intra-operative use in patients with CLM has not previously been studied. Preclinical work suggested the safety and feasibility of a new HIFU device capable of ablating volumes of up to 2cm x 2cm in a few seconds.  Methods:   We conducted a prospective, single-centre phase I-IIa trial. HIFU was delivered immediately before scheduled hepatectomy. To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of rapidly ablating liver parenchyma, ablations were performed on healthy tissue within the areas scheduled for resection.  Results:   In total, 30 ablations were carried out in 15 patients. These ablations were all generated within 40 seconds and on average measured 27.5mm x 21.0mm. The phase I study (n = 6) showed that use of the HIFU device was feasible and safe and did not damage neighbouring tissue. The phase IIa study (n = 9) showed both that the area of ablation could be precisely targeted on a previously implanted metallic mark (used to represent a major anatomical structure) and that ablations could be undertaken deliberately to avoid such a mark. Ablations were achieved with a precision of 1-2 mm.  Conclusion:   HIFU was feasible, safe and effective in ablating areas of liver scheduled for resection.

Mean cost per admission was €3,302 and €2,916 for first event and recurrence, respectively, in BC patients (total cost €1.98 million over 2 years) and €3,611 and €3,363 for first event and recurrence in PC patients (total cost €1.43 million over 2 years). In patients who had at least one recurrence, mean hospitalization cost was €5,545 and €5,692 in BC and PC, respectively.  Conclusion:   The burden of VTE in cancer patients is important; costs should be reduced by decreasing the occurrence of thrombotic recurrences. In this respect, better prevention and follow-up measures may reduce recurrence and VTE costs.""","""['Florian Scotte', 'Nicolas Martelli', 'Alexandre Vainchtock', 'Isabelle Borget']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Adv Ther""","""['The Incidence and Economic Burden of In-Hospital Venous Thromboembolism in the United States.', 'Resource utilization and charges of patients with and without diagnosed venous thromboembolism during primary hospitalization and after elective inpatient surgery: a retrospective study.', 'Frequency of hospital readmissions for venous thromboembolism and associated hospital costs and length of stay among acute medically ill patients in the US.', 'Economic burden of venous thromboembolism: a systematic review.', 'Clinical burden of venous thromboembolism.', 'Robot-Assisted Surgery vs Robotic Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer: A Cost-Utility Analysis.', 'Public Awareness on Cancer-Associated Thrombosis among the Greek Population: First Findings from the ROADMAP-CAT Awareness Study.', 'Dalteparin or vitamin K antagonists to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism in cancer patients: a patient-level economic analysis for France and Austria.', 'Management of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients: the economic burden of hospitalizations.']"""

In this study, we used data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey to examine patterns of CRC screening and provider recommendation among seniors ages 76-84 years, and made some comparisons to younger adults. Nationally-representative samples of 1379 adults ages 76-84 years and 8797 adults ages 50-75 years responded to questions about CRC screening status, receipt of provider recommendation, and discussion of test options; 22.7% (95% CI 20.1-25.3) of seniors ages 76-84 had never been tested for CRC and therefore were not up-to-date with guidelines; 3.9% (95% CI 2.0-7.6) of these individuals reported a recent provider recommendation for screening. In multivariate analyses, the likelihood of never having been tested was significantly greater for seniors of other/multiple race or Hispanic ethnicity; with high school or less education; without private health insurance coverage; who had ≤ 1 doctor visit in the past year; without recent screening for breast, cervical, or prostate cancer; with no or unknown CRC family history; or with ≤ 1 chronic disease. Among the minority of respondents ages 50-75 and 76-84 reporting a provider recommendation, 73.2% indicated that the provider recommended particular tests, which was overwhelmingly colonoscopy (≥ 89 %). Nearly one-quarter of adults 76-84 have never been screened for CRC, and rates of provider recommendation in this group are very low.

This could be due to increased use of psychotropic medications with comorbidity. We tested this hypothesis in older adults.  Methods:   Information from medical records of older adults (65 to 99 years of age) in the following groups was collected: women with breast cancer (n = 2359), women without any cancer diagnosis (n = 27,161), men with prostate cancer (n = 2686), and men without any cancer diagnosis (n = 21,014). We collected fills of antidepressant or sedative medications, diagnosis of depression in the year of cancer diagnosis, and Charlson Comorbidity Index from the year before cancer.  Results:   Women with breast cancer were more likely to fill psychotropic prescriptions (both ps < 0.02) or be diagnosed with depression (p < 0.001) than women without cancer. Men with prostate cancer were more likely to fill these prescriptions or receive a diagnosis of depression than men without cancer (ps < 0.05). Charlson was related to increased odds of filling both types of medication in women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer (ps < 0.001). Comorbidity was related to greater odds of receiving a depression diagnosis in men with prostate cancer (p < 0.001) but not women with breast cancer (p > 0.15).  Conclusions:   Older adults with breast or prostate cancer are more likely to fill psychotropic medication prescriptions and receive a depression diagnosis than those without cancer. Comorbidity increased the likelihood of medication fills in older adults with cancer.

Methods:   Age-sex-tumour specific five-year relative survival ratios were calculated for cancer patients diagnosed with 27 tumour sites (representing about 92% of all cancers) in 2006-10. These were used to estimate the number of Māori, non-Māori and total deaths (and proportion of excess deaths) that would have been avoidable within five years of diagnosis had New Zealand's relative survival been equivalent to Australia's.  Results:   A total of 3,631 cancer deaths (726/year; 13.4% of excess deaths) could have been avoidable. Among 25 tumours where ethnic-specific results were estimated, there were 851 potentially avoidable deaths in Māori (24.9%) and 2,758 in non-Māori (11.8%). Breast, bowel, lung and prostate tumours made up 64% of avoidable deaths. Those with the highest proportions of avoidable deaths were thyroid (44.7%), prostate (35.5%), breast (30.0%) and uterus (23.5%). More than 50% of Māori melanoma, prostate, testis and thyroid cancer deaths were avoidable.  Conclusion:   A significant number of cancer deaths could be avoidable if New Zealand achieved Australia's relative survival ratios. The proportion is much higher for Māori than for non-Māori.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the impact of multiparametric prostate MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) performed using different b values as well as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) on the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for transition zone (TZ) tumor detection and localization. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We included 106 prostate cancer patients (mean age [± SD], 62 ± 7 years) who underwent 3-T MRI with a pelvic phased-array coil before radical prostatectomy. Three radiologists independently reviewed cases to record the likelihood of tumor in each of six TZ regions. Scores were initially assigned using T2-weighted imaging alone, reassigned after integration of DWI at b = 1000 s/mm(2) and corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, reassigned again after integration of DWI at b = 2000 s/mm(2), and reassigned a final time after integration of DCE-MRI. Generalized estimating equations based on binary logistic regression were used to compare sessions for TZ tumor detection, using prostatectomy findings as reference standard. RESULTS. Of the TZ sextants, 9.7% (62/636) contained tumor. All readers had higher sensitivity for T2-weighted imaging integrated with DWI at b = 1000 s/mm(2) and ADC compared with T2-weighted imaging alone (reader 1, 54.8% vs 33.9%; reader 2, 53.2% vs 22.6%; and reader 3, 50.0% vs 19.4% [p ≤ 0.002]); two readers had further increased sensitivity also incorporating b = 2000 s/mm(2) (reader 1, 74.2% and reader 2, 62.9%; p ≤ 0.011), and one reader had further increased sensitivity also incorporating both b = 2000 s/mm(2) and DCE-MRI (reader 3, 61.3%, p = 0.013). DCE-MRI otherwise did not improve sensitivity (p ≥ 0.054). Other measures were similar across the four sessions (reader 1, specificity 97.4-98.3% and accuracy 91.2-95.9%; reader 2, specificity 95.8-98.4% and accuracy 91.0-92.6%; reader 3, specificity 90.9-96.7% and accuracy 88.1-89.2%).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Patients with prostate cancer (n = 72) underwent diffusion-weighted MRI (b values, 0, 800, and 1600 s/mm(2)) with an endorectal coil. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and ADC ratio were obtained in normal and pathologic tissue and were correlated with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (n = 72) and histopathologic (n = 39) Gleason scores using the ANOVA test. ADC accuracy was estimated using ROC curves. RESULTS. Lesions suspicious for prostate cancer were detected in 65 patients. The mean ADC was 1.47 and 0.87 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s for normal and pathologic tissue, respectively (p < 0.001). When we divided the population into four groups (normal tissue and biopsy Gleason scores of 6, 7, and 8-10), then the mean ADC value was 1.47, 0.96, 0.80, and 0.78 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively (p < 0.001). The ADC ratio decreased along with an increase in biopsy Gleason score (66.9%, 56.7%, and 51.5% for Gleason scores of 6, 7 and 8-10, respectively) (ANOVA, p = 0.003) and pathologic Gleason score (ANOVA, p < 0.001).

Patients and methods:   After meeting stringent enrollment criteria for an AS cohort study at a single tertiary care cancer centre, 180 men with favourable-risk prostate cancer completed questionnaires at the time of enrollment and every 6 months for up to 30 months. Questionnaires assessed illness uncertainty, anxiety, prostate-specific QoL (using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] scale) and general QoL (using the 12-time short-form health survey [SF-12]) and fear of progression. We used linear mixed-model analyses and multilevel mediation analyses.  Results:   Sexual scores on the EPIC scale significantly declined over time (P < 0.05). Illness uncertainty was a significant predictor of all EPIC summary scores, SF-12 physical component summary (PCS) scores, mental component summary (MCS) scores and fear of progression scores (all P < 0.05), after controlling for demographic and clinicopathological factors. Anxiety predicted all EPIC summary, MCS and fear of progression scores (all P < 0.05) but not PCS scores (P = 0.08).

However, A1-R showed higher tumor targeting and inhibited the Lewis lung carcinoma to a greater extent than VNP20009, with less body weight loss. The mice tolerated S. typhimurium A1-R to at a least 2-fold higher dose than VNP20009 when the bacteria were administered iv.

Using miRNA profiling analysis, we find that miR-188-5p was significantly down-regulated in metastatic PCa. Down-regulation of miR-188-5p is an independent prognostic factor for poor overall and biochemical recurrence-free survival. Restoration of miR-188-5p in PCa cells (PC-3 and LNCaP) significantly suppresses proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and inhibits tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. We also find overexpression of miR-188-5p in PC-3 cells can significantly enhance the cells' chemosensitivity to adriamycin. LAPTM4B is subsequently identified as a direct target of miR-188-5p in PCa, and is found to be significantly over-expressed in PCa. Knockdown of LAPTM4B phenotypically copies miR-188-5p-induced phenotypes, whereas ectopic expression of LAPTM4B reverses the effects of miR-188-5p. We also find that restoration of miR-188-5p can inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via the suppression of LAPTM4B.

Methods:   Serum levels of 78 inflammatory markers were measured in 1,819 55- to 74-year-old men and women in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Data were combined from three completed case-control studies and reweighted to the PLCO screening arm.

Outcome measures:   Competing-risks survival analyses to estimate subhazard ratios (SHR) of PCM adjusted for age, ethnicity, year of diagnosis, Gleason score (GS) and clinical tumour (cT) stage.  Results:   222,163 men were eligible for inclusion. Compared with American patients, English patients were more likely to present at an older age (70-79 years: England 44.2%, USA 29.3%, p<0.001), with higher tumour stage (cT3-T4: England 25.1%, USA 8.6%, p<0.001) and higher GS (GS 8-10: England 20.7%, USA 11.2%, p<0.001).

In this study, we examined whether AR gene aberrations detectable in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are associated with resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide in mCRPC patients.  Experimental design:   Plasma was collected from 62 mCRPC patients ceasing abiraterone acetate (n = 29), enzalutamide (n = 19), or other agents (n = 14) due to disease progression. DNA was extracted and subjected to array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) for chromosome copy number analysis, and Roche 454 targeted next-generation sequencing of exon 8 in the AR.  Results:   On aCGH, AR amplification was significantly more common in patients progressing on enzalutamide than on abiraterone or other agents (53% vs. 17% vs. 21%, P = 0.02, χ(2)). Missense AR exon 8 mutations were detected in 11 of 62 patients (18%), including the first reported case of an F876L mutation in an enzalutamide-resistant patient and H874Y and T877A mutations in 7 abiraterone-resistant patients. In patients switched onto enzalutamide after cfDNA collection (n = 39), an AR gene aberration (copy number increase and/or an exon 8 mutation) in pretreatment cfDNA was associated with adverse outcomes, including lower rates of PSA decline ≥ 30% (P = 0.013, χ(2)) and shorter time to radiographic/clinical progression (P = 0.010, Cox proportional hazards regression).

We further explore the requirement for β-catenin in basal and luminal prostate cells during CaP progression. Genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of β-catenin specifically suppress basal-derived CaP progression through reduction of stemness and cell proliferation and increased γH2Ax-associated apoptosis. Lineage tracing revealed that loss of β-catenin in basal cells impairs basal-to-luminal differentiation; conversely, β-catenin loss is dispensable for luminal-derived CaP progression. Our findings suggest that β-catenin is required for basal-derived normal luminal cells and cancer cells, but not for luminal derivatives.

Results:   Month 6 negative biopsy rate was 68.4 % in the overall evaluable population (N = 114) and 80.6 % for patients treated by hemiablation with light density index (LDI) ≥ 1 (N = 67). Mean prostate necroses at week-1 were 76.5 and 86.3 %, respectively. In both groups, PSA levels at month 6 decreased by 2.0 ng/mL. Small changes from baseline for IPSS and IIEF-5 indicated a slight improvement in urinary function and a slight deterioration in sexual function.  Conclusions:   Focal VTP treatment with TOOKAD(®) Soluble at 4 mg/kg and 200 J/cm resulted in a negative 6-month biopsy rate of 68.4 % for the whole population and 80.6 % for patients treated by hemiablation with LDI ≥ 1. The treatment was well tolerated.

We previously reported that in ETS-driven cancers of the bone and prostate, activating E2F3 cooperates with ETS on target promoters. The mechanism of target co-regulation remained unknown. Using RNAi and time-resolved chromatin-immunoprecipitation in Ewing sarcoma we report replacement of E2F3/pRB by constitutively expressed repressive E2F4/p130 complexes on target genes upon EWS-FLI1 modulation. Using mathematical modeling we interrogated four alternative explanatory models for the observed EWS-FLI1/E2F3 cooperation based on longitudinal E2F target and regulating transcription factor expression analysis. Bayesian model selection revealed the formation of a synergistic complex between EWS-FLI1 and E2F3 as the by far most likely mechanism explaining the observed kinetics of E2F target induction. Consequently we propose that aberrant cell cycle activation in Ewing sarcoma is due to the de-repression of E2F targets as a consequence of transcriptional induction and physical recruitment of E2F3 by EWS-FLI1 replacing E2F4 on their target promoters.""","""['Raphaela Schwentner', 'Theodore Papamarkou', 'Maximilian O Kauer', 'Vassilios Stathopoulos', 'Fan Yang', 'Sven Bilke', 'Paul S Meltzer', 'Mark Girolami', 'Heinrich Kovar']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Oncogenic ETS fusions deregulate E2F3 target genes in Ewing sarcoma and prostate cancer.', 'High-throughput RNAi screen in Ewing sarcoma cells identifies leucine rich repeats and WD repeat domain containing 1 (LRWD1) as a regulator of EWS-FLI1 driven cell viability.', 'SLFN11 Is a Transcriptional Target of EWS-FLI1 and a Determinant of Drug Response in Ewing Sarcoma.', 'Molecular pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma: new therapeutic and transcriptional targets.', 'Blocking the road, stopping the engine or killing the driver?

Watercress constituent PEITC and SFN-rich broccoli sprout extract are under clinical investigations but the molecular mechanisms underlying their cancer chemopreventive effects are not fully understood. The present study demonstrates that chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a novel target of ITCs in prostate cancer cells. Exposure of prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, 22Rv1, C4-2, and PC-3) to pharmacologically applicable concentrations of PEITC, benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), and SFN (2.5 and 5 μmol/L) resulted in downregulation of CXCR4 expression. None of the ITCs affected secretion of CXCR4 ligand (stromal-derived factor-1). In vivo inhibition of PC-3 xenograft growth upon PEITC treatment was associated with a significant decrease in CXCR4 protein level. A similar trend was discernible in the tumors from SFN-treated TRAMP mice compared with those of control mice, but the difference was not significant. Stable overexpression of CXCR4 in PC-3 cells conferred significant protection against wound healing, cell migration, and cell viability inhibition by ITCs. Inhibition of cell migration resulting from PEITC and BITC exposure was significantly augmented by RNAi of CXCR4. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that cancer chemopreventive ITCs suppress CXCR4 expression in prostate cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo. These results suggest that CXCR4 downregulation may be an important pharmacodynamic biomarker of cancer chemopreventative ITCs in prostate adenocarcinoma.""","""['Kozue Sakao', 'Avani R Vyas', 'Sreenivasa R Chinni', 'Ali I Amjad', 'Rahul Parikh', 'Shivendra V Singh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Fatty Acid Synthesis Intermediates Represent Novel Noninvasive Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention by Phenethyl Isothiocyanate.', 'Inhibition of Glycolysis in Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention by Phenethyl Isothiocyanate.', 'Chemopreventative potential of the cruciferous vegetable constituent phenethyl isothiocyanate in a mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'Anti-Carcinogenic Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables and Their Antagonistic Effects on Prevention of Cancers.', 'Prostate cancer chemopreventive activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate through epigenetic regulation (review).', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.', 'A Narrative Review on Therapeutic Potentials of Watercress in Human Disorders.', 'DNA methylome, transcriptome, and prostate cancer prevention by phenethyl isothiocyanate in TRAMP mice.', 'Sulforaphane Bioavailability and Chemopreventive Activity in Men Presenting for Biopsy of the Prostate Gland: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Nonhuman primate model of persistent erectile and urinary dysfunction following radical prostatectomy: Feasibility of minimally invasive therapy.']"""

Patients and methods:   In all, 55 patients who underwent SRP from January 2007 to December 2012 were retrospectively analysed. Kaplan-Meier curves assessed time to biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastasis-free survival (MFS) and cancer-specific survival. Cox regressions addressed factors influencing BCR and MFS. BCR was defined as a PSA level of >0.2 ng/mL and rising, continence as the use of 0-1 safety pad/day, and potency as a five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function score of ≥18.  Results:   The median follow-up was 36 months. After SRP, 42.0% of the patients experienced BCR, 15.9% developed metastasis, and 5.5% died from prostate cancer. Patients fulfilling the EAU guideline criteria were less likely to have positive lymph nodes (LNs) and had significantly better BCR-free survival (5-year BCR-free survival 73.9% vs 11.6%; P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, low-dose-rate brachytherapy as primary treatment (P = 0.03) and presence of positive LNs at SRP (P = 0.02) were significantly associated with worse BCR-free survival. The presence of positive LNs or Gleason score >7 at SRP were independently associated with metastasis. The urinary continence rate at 1 year after SRP was 74%.

Methods:   Primary or recurrent prostate, breast, lung or colorectal cancer patients (n = 394) were prospectively surveyed 3 and 9 months post-diagnosis using the Support Care Needs Survey (SCNS-LF59) and Information Satisfaction (ISQ) and Service Needs (SNQ) questionnaires. Two age groups were compared: ≥65 years (senior) versus ≤64 years (junior).  Results:   Few differences emerged between age groups (SCNS) with the exception of psychological (p < 0.001) and sexuality (p < 0.001) domains where these were greater in the younger patients 3 months post-diagnosis. Sexuality (p < 0.001) and patient care and support (p = 0.023) needs were predicted by age (continuous); younger patients had more needs at 3 months post-diagnosis. For information satisfaction, the older group preferred doctors to make decisions (3 months p < 0.001; 9 months p = 0.008) and preferred positive information (3 months p = 0.006). For the whole group fears about cancer spreading (51 %) and returning (45 %) predominate, alongside patients' concerns about worries of those closest to them (51 %) and uncertainty about their future (42 %) at 3 months.  Conclusions:   Older patients differ on information satisfaction showing a preference for doctors to make treatment decisions. For supportive care, there were few age differences; however, the SCNS sexuality and patient care and support domains indicate greater need in younger patients around the 3-month period following diagnosis.

It is now accepted that the actions of any specific phytonutrient alone do not explain the observed health benefits of diets rich in fruits and vegetables as nutrients that were taken alone in clinical trials did not show consistent preventive effects. The considerable cost and complexity of such clinical trials requires prudent selection of combinations of ingredients rather than single compounds. Indeed, synergistic inhibition of prostate and mammary cancer cell growth was evident when using combinations of low concentrations of various carotenoids or carotenoids with retinoic acid and the active metabolite of vitamin-D. In this study we aimed to develop simple and sensitive in vitro methods which provide information on potent combinations suitable for inclusion in clinical studies for cancer prevention. We, thus, used reporter gene assays of the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor in hormone-dependent prostate cancer cells and of the electrophile/antioxidant response element (EpRE/ARE) transcription system. We found that combinations of several carotenoids (e.g., lycopene, phytoene and phytofluene), or carotenoids and polyphenols (e.g., carnosic acid and curcumin) and/or other compounds (e.g., vitamin E) synergistically inhibit the androgen receptor activity and activate the EpRE/ARE system. The activation of EpRE/ARE was up to four fold higher than the sum of the activities of the single ingredients, a robust hallmark of synergy. Such combinations can further be tested in the more complex in vivo models and human studies.""","""['Karin Linnewiel-Hermoni', 'Marina Khanin', 'Michael Danilenko', 'Gabriel Zango', 'Yaara Amosi', 'Joseph Levy', 'Yoav Sharoni']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Arch Biochem Biophys""","""['Structure activity relationship of carotenoid derivatives in activation of the electrophile/antioxidant response element transcription system.', 'Lycopene and other carotenoids inhibit estrogenic activity of 17beta-estradiol and genistein in cancer cells.', 'Polyphenols, isothiocyanates, and carotenoid derivatives enhance estrogenic activity in bone cells but inhibit it in breast cancer cells.', 'Potential synergy of phytochemicals in cancer prevention: mechanism of action.', 'Carotenoids and apocarotenoids in cellular signaling related to cancer: a review.', 'Prevention of aspirin-mediated secondary toxicity by combined treatment of carotenoids in macrophages.', 'Improving Whole Tomato Transformation for Prostate Health: Benign Prostate Hypertrophy as an Exploratory Model.', 'Mechanism-Driven and Clinically Focused Development of Botanical Foods as Multitarget Anticancer Medicine: Collective Perspectives and Insights from Preclinical Studies, IND Applications and Early-Phase Clinical Trials.', 'FruHis significantly increases the anti-benign prostatic hyperplasia effect of lycopene: A double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial.', 'Interactive deciphering electron-shuttling characteristics of Coffea arabica leaves and potential bioenergy-steered anti-SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor via microbial fuel cells.']"""

To provide guidance to healthcare professionals treating patients with CBP and CP/CPPS, in both non-specialist and specialist settings. To promote efficient referral of care between non-specialists and specialists and the involvement of the multidisciplinary team (MDT).  Patients and methods:   The guideline population were men with CBP or CP/CPPS (persistent or recurrent symptoms and no other urogenital pathology for ≥3 of the previous 6 months). Consensus recommendations for the guidelines were based on a search to identify literature on the diagnosis and management of CBP and CP/CPPS (published between 1999 and February 2014). A Delphi panel process was used where high-quality, published evidence was lacking.  Results:   CBP and CP/CPPS can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The four main symptom domains are urogenital pain, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS - voiding or storage symptoms), psychological issues and sexual dysfunction. Patients should be managed according to their individual symptom pattern. Options for first-line treatment include antibiotics, α-adrenergic antagonists (if voiding LUTS are present) and simple analgesics. Repeated use of antibiotics, such as quinolones, should be avoided if there is no obvious symptomatic benefit from infection control or cultures do not support an infectious cause. Early use of treatments targeting neuropathic pain and/or referral to specialist services should be considered for patients who do not respond to initial measures. An MDT approach (urologists, pain specialists, nurse specialists, specialist physiotherapists, general practitioners, cognitive behavioural therapists/psychologists, and sexual health specialists) is recommended. Patients should be fully informed about the possible underlying causes and treatment options, including an explanation of the chronic pain cycle.  Conclusion:   Chronic prostatitis can present with a wide variety of signs and symptoms. Identification of individual symptom patterns and a symptom-based treatment approach are recommended.

Cylindrical volume estimates of treatment effects were used to define the optimal treatment margin.  Results:   Three-dimensional software based registration with magnetic resonance imaging was done in 46 histologically confirmed cancers. Imaging underestimated tumor size with a maximal discrepancy between imaging and histological boundaries for a given tumor of an average ± SD of 1.99 ± 3.1 mm, representing 18.5% of the diameter on imaging. Boundary underestimation was larger for lesions with an imaging suspicion score 4 or greater (mean 3.49 ± 2.1 mm, p <0.001) and a Gleason score of 7 or greater (mean 2.48 ± 2.8 mm, p = 0.035). A simulated cylindrical treatment volume based on the imaging boundary missed an average 14.8% of tumor volume compared to that based on the histological boundary. A simulated treatment volume based on a 9 mm treatment margin achieved complete histological tumor destruction in 100% of patients.  Conclusions:   Magnetic resonance imaging underestimates histologically determined tumor boundaries, especially for lesions with a high imaging suspicion score and a high Gleason score.

Initial studies investigating Radium-223 primarily used nonsteroidal first-generation antiandrogens. Since that time, newer antiandrogen therapies have demonstrated improved survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. It has been suggested that the rational combination of these newly approved agents with Radium-223 may lead to improved response rates and clinical outcomes. Currently, there is lack of information regarding the safety of concurrent administration of these agents with radiopharmaceuticals. Here, we report on hematologic toxicity findings from our institution in patients receiving concurrent Radium-223 and next-generation antiandrogen therapies with either enzalutamide or abiraterone.  Materials/methods:   In a retrospective study, we analyzed patients who received Radium-223 as part of an early-access trial, and following FDA approval in May 2013, patients receiving Radium-223 as part of standard care. Radium-223 was given at standard dosing of 50 kBq/kg each month for 6 total cycles. Complete blood counts were performed before treatment monthly and following each injection. Blood counts from patients receiving Radium alone and concurrently with next-generation antiandrogens were compared. To date, 25 total patients were analyzed, with a median of 5 monthly doses received per patient. Fourteen patients received concurrent therapy during monthly Radium-223 with either enzalutamide (n=8) or abiraterone (n=6).  Results:   Six patients expired due to disease progression. Two patients discontinued treatment due to grade 3 myelosuppression. For patients receiving either Radium alone and with concurrent next-generation antiandrogen therapy, there did not appear to be any statistically significant differences between initial and nadir blood counts. Mean change from initial neutrophil count to nadir was 1.9×10/L in patients receiving Radium alone, versus 2.3×10/L in patients receiving concurrent therapy (P=0.77). Mean change from initial hemoglobin value to nadir was 1.5 g/L in patients receiving Radium alone, versus 1.8 g/L in patients receiving concurrent therapy (P=0.31). Mean change from initial platelet count to nadir was 52.3×10 cells/L in patients receiving Radium alone versus 70.6×10 cells/L in patients receiving concurrent therapy (P=0.39). Individual blood counts for each measured laboratory are included in the supplemental data. PSA was stable or decreased in 22% of patients receiving Radium alone versus 35% of patients receiving combination treatment (P=0.24).  Conclusions:   Concurrent administration of Radium-223 and next-generation antiandrogen therapies appears to be well tolerated with similar toxicities to standard administration of Radium-223 alone. This particular cohort of patients represents a high-risk, heavily pretreated group of patients with advanced metastatic disease and significant marrow burden. Despite these risk factors, hematologic toxicity was modest and was in the range expected for this risk group based on previous trials. To date, this is the first study investigating the toxicity of combination treatment. Further studies investigating the safety and efficacy of combination treatments are warranted.""","""['Tu D Dan', 'Harriet B Eldredge-Hindy', 'Jean Hoffman-Censits', 'Jianqing Lin', 'William K Kelly', 'Leonard G Gomella', 'Costas D Lallas', 'Edouard J Trabulsi', 'Mark D Hurwitz', 'Adam P Dicker', 'Robert B Den']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Radium-223 Safety, Efficacy, and Concurrent Use with Abiraterone or Enzalutamide: First U.S. Experience from an Expanded Access Program.', 'Association of Chemotherapy, Enzalutamide, Abiraterone, and Radium 223 With Cognitive Function in Older Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Taxane chemotherapy vs antiandrogen agents as first-line therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination radium-223 therapies in patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer: A review.', 'Enzalutamide Prior to Radium-223 Is Associated with Better Overall Survival in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Compared to Abiraterone-A Retrospective Study.', 'The safety of radium-223 combined with new-generation hormonal agents in bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Assessing the quality of life of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases receiving 223RaRaCl2 therapy.', 'Radium-223 dichloride in prostate cancer: proof of principle for the use of targeted alpha treatment in clinical practice.', 'Retrospective Toxicological Profiling of Radium-223 Dichloride for the Treatment of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer Using Adverse Event Data.']"""

Specific prognostic and predictive markers for prostate cancer patients are still lacking. A causal relationship between androgens and the development of prostate cancer is generally considered biologically plausible, but androgens are not the sole effector in the complexity of prostate carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of progesterone receptor in tumor tissue of T1-3N0 prostate cancer patients undergoing prostatectomy.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays from 535 patients with prostate cancer were constructed. Duplicate cores of tumor cells and tumor stromal tissue from each resected specimen were extracted. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the in-situ expression of progesterone receptor.  Results:   In univariate analyses, high tumor cell density (p = 0.006) and high tumor stromal cell density level (p = 0.045) of progesterone receptor were both significantly associated with tumor progression and clinical failure. In multivariate analysis, progesterone receptor expression in tumor cells was an independent negative prognostic factor for clinical failure (HR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2-5.2, p = 0.012).

Turbo spin echo T2-weighted (T2W) and single shot echo planar imaging diffusion tensor imaging (EPI DTI) data were collected from 13 subjects with biopsy proven prostate cancer prior to surgical removal of the gland. Rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) T2W and spin-echo DTI data were acquired ex-vivo from the fixed prostatectomy specimens. Digitized whole mount histology sections, examined and annotated by a pathologist, were registered to the in-vivo and ex-vivo DTI data, and the average values of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and FA were calculated from ROIs encompassing normal and cancerous peripheral zone (PZ). In addition, Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to assess the dependence of the apparent FA on the ADC values for different signal to noise ratios (SNRs). ADC values were significantly lower in tumors than in normal PZ both in-vivo and ex-vivo, while the difference in FA values between tumors and normal PZ was significant only in-vivo. Paired t-test showed significant difference between in-vivo and ex-vivo FA values in tumors, but not in the normal PZ. The simulations showed that lower SNR results in an increasing overestimation of the FA values with decreasing ADC. These results suggest that the in-vivo increase in FA values in tumors is due to low SNR, rather than the presence of cancer. The results of this study suggest that FA does not contribute significantly to the diagnostic capabilities of DTI in prostate cancer.""","""['Carlos F Uribe', 'Edward C Jones', 'Silvia D Chang', 'S Larry Goldenberg', 'Stefan A Reinsberg', 'Piotr Kozlowski']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Detection of prostate cancer in peripheral zone: comparison of MR diffusion tensor imaging, quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and the two techniques combined at 3.0 T.', 'Diffusion tensor imaging of prostate at 3.0 Tesla.', 'Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging of prostate cancer.', 'ADC value and diffusion tensor imaging of prostate cancer: changes in carbon-ion radiotherapy.', 'In vivo measurement of the apparent diffusion coefficient in normal and malignant prostatic tissues using echo-planar imaging.', 'Acquisition Parameters Influence Diffusion Metrics Effectiveness in Probing Prostate Tumor and Age-Related Microstructure.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for radiation therapy response monitoring in soft tissue sarcomas: a histology and MRI co-registration algorithm.', 'Prospective evaluation of PI-RADS v2 and quantitative MRI for clinically significant prostate cancer detection in Indian men - East meets West.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 68Ga Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography, and Respective Quantitative Parameters in Detection and Localization of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Intermediate- and High-Risk Group Patients: An Indian Demographic Study.', 'Registration of histopathology to magnetic resonance imaging of prostate cancer.']"""

In this report, we developed a triangular silver nanoprism (AgNPRs) etching-based plasmonic biosensor for the detection of cancer biomarkers. The triangular AgNPRs-based plasmonic biosensor is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay combined with the enzyme-mediated surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of triangular AgNPRs. Triangular AgNPRs uses the immune response of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to trigger the glucose oxidase (GOx)-catalysed oxidation of glucose (Glu), producing hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidant to etch the triangular AgNPRs into smaller spherical silver nanoparticles, which is accompanied by a substantial blueshift of the SPR peak and a colourimetric blue-to-purple change that can be observed by the naked eye. The SPR peak shift enables the quantitative assessment of PSA due to the remarkable colour change. The triangular AgNPRs-based plasmonic ELISA approach exhibited a quasilinear response to logarithmic PSA concentrations in the range of 10fg/mL to 100pg/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) of 4.1fg/mL. In addition, the LOD of PSA in this approach exceeds that of the conventional HRP-based ELISA (1.25ng/mL) approach by more than 5 orders of magnitude. Patient serum samples from 16 donors were assayed with triangular AgNPRs-based plasmonic ELISA. The results from the triangular AgNPRs-based immunoassay and the time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay showed excellent correlation, and there were no significant differences in the quantified amounts of PSA. The triangular AgNPRs-based plasmonic ELISA approach has advantages (ultrasensitive, cost-effective, ease of operation) that are expected to be of great interest in diagnostics and to be suitable for a point-of-care test.""","""['Jiajie Liang', 'Cuize Yao', 'Xiuqing Li', 'Ze Wu', 'Caihong Huang', 'Qiangqiang Fu', 'Caifeng Lan', 'Donglin Cao', 'Yong Tang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for PSA biomarker detection in prostate cancer cells using gold nanoparticles/PAMAM dendrimer loaded with enzyme linked aptamer as integrated triple signal amplification strategy.', 'Plasmonic ELISA for the ultrasensitive detection of Treponema pallidum.', 'A highly sensitive plasmonic DNA assay based on triangular silver nanoprism etching.', 'Nanomaterial-based biosensors for detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Enzyme-assisted metal nanoparticles etching based plasmonic ELISA: Progress and insights.', 'Platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs)-based CRISPR/Cas12a platform for detection of nucleic acid and protein in clinical samples.', 'Multiplexed Nanobiosensors: Current Trends in Early Diagnostics.', 'Nanoplasmonic Paper-Based Platform for General Screening of Biomacromolecules.', 'Recent Progress of Biomarker Detection Sensors.', 'A simple and compact smartphone-based device for the quantitative readout of colloidal gold lateral flow immunoassay strips.']"""

Selenoprotein W (SEPW1) is a highly conserved, diet-regulated 9kDa thioredoxin-like protein required for normal cell cycle progression. We report here that SEPW1 is required for EGF-induced EGFR activation and that it functions by suppressing EGFR ubiquitination and receptor degradation. SEPW1 depletion inhibited EGF-dependent cell cycle entry in breast and prostate epithelial cells. In prostate cells, SEPW1 depletion decreased EGFR auto-phosphorylation, while SEPW1 overexpression increased EGFR auto-phosphorylation. SEPW1 depletion increased the rate of EGFR degradation, which decreased total and surface EGFR and suppressed EGF-dependent EGFR endocytosis, EGFR dimer formation, and activation of EGF-dependent pathways. EGFR ubiquitination was increased in SEPW1-depleted cells--in agreement with the increased rate of EGFR degradation, and suggests that SEPW1 suppresses EGFR ubiquitination. Ubiquitination-directed lysozomal degradation controls post-translational EGFR expression and is dysregulated in many cancers. Thus, suppression of EGFR ubiquitination by SEPW1 may be related to the putative increase in cancer risk associated with high selenium intakes. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying SEPW1's regulation of EGFR ubiquitination may reveal new opportunities for nutritional cancer prevention or cancer drug development.""","""['Zeynep Alkan', 'Frank L Duong', 'Wayne C Hawkes']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Selenoprotein W depletion induces a p53- and p21-dependent delay in cell cycle progression in RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells.', 'Endophilin B1 regulates EGFR endocytic degradation in prostate cancer cell.', 'Acute ligand-independent Src activation mimics low EGF-induced EGFR surface signalling and redistribution into recycling endosomes.', 'The roles of phospholipase D in EGFR signaling.', 'Chapter Six - The Ubiquitin Network in the Control of EGFR Endocytosis and Signaling.', 'Selenoprotein W Ameliorates Experimental Colitis and Promotes Intestinal Epithelial Repair.', 'The emerging role of selenium metabolic pathways in cancer: New therapeutic targets for cancer.', 'Combination of Fish Oil and Selenium Enhances Anticancer Efficacy and Targets Multiple Signaling Pathways in Anti-VEGF Agent Treated-TNBC Tumor-Bearing Mice.', 'Dysregulation of Redox Status in Urinary Bladder Cancer Patients.', 'Selenoproteome Identification in Inflamed Murine Primary Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages by Nano-LC Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometry.']"""

Methods:   Six surgeons carried out robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in 154 patients, which were divided into the following three groups: group 1 (n = 90), including patients operated on by a surgeon with experience in both open radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy; group 2 (n = 36), including patients operated on by two surgeons with experience in open radical prostatectomy only; and group 3 (n = 28), including patients operated on by three surgeons with limited experience in both open radical prostatectomy or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Groups 2 and 3 did not differ significantly in their median values of external blood loss (P = 0.165) or console time (P = 0.103). Positive surgical margin rates for pT2 patients were also similar in these two groups: 21.2% (7/33) in group 2 and 22.7% (5/22) in group 3 (P = 0.894). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 12 months after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy the prostate-specific antigen-free rate for pT2 patients was 96.0% in group 2 and 100% in group 3, but the pad-free continence rate was just 91.0% in group 1, 88.0% in group 2 and 75.5% in group 3 (group 1 vs group 3, P = 0.037; group 2 vs group 3, P = 0.239). The major complication rate after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was 3.3% (3/90) in group 1, 11.1% (4/36) in group 2 and 17.9% (5/28) in group 3 (group 1 vs group 3, P = 0.008; group 2 vs group 3; P = 0.441).

Cyclophosphamide may be an effective combination partner.  Methods:   This randomised, multicentre, phase II trial compared the combination therapy of docetaxel plus prednisone plus cyclophosphamide with the standard therapy of docetaxel plus prednisone.  Results:   Thirty-three patients received six 3-week treatment cycles (in total 171 cycles). During treatment, an adequate decline in prostate-specific antigen was seen in both groups (p = 0.068) without between-group differences (p = 0.683). No relevant differences between within-group changes were observed for blood pressure, weight, pain score, laboratory variables or quality of life. There were no serious side effects apart from leucopenia requiring treatment (docetaxel + prednisone + cyclophosphamide arm) and no drug-related withdrawals; all three fatalities were considered to be cancer related.  Conclusions:   The oncological effectiveness and tolerability of docetaxel plus prednisone were supported; an additional effect of cyclophosphamide was not detected.

In both α2M* and insulin-treated cells, the mRNA levels of SREBP1-c, SREBP2, fatty-acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ATP citrate lyase, and Glut-1 were significantly increased together with their protein levels, except for SREBP2. Pretreatment of cells with α2M* antagonist antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRP78 blocks these α2M*-mediated effects, and silencing GRP78 expression by RNAi inhibits up-regulation of ATP citrate lyase and fatty-acid synthase. α2M* induces a 2-3-fold increase in lipogenesis as determined by 6-[(14)C]glucose or 1-[(14)C]acetate incorporation into free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and phosphatidylcholine, which is blocked by inhibitors of fatty-acid synthase, PI 3-kinase, mTORC, or an antibody against the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRP78. We also assessed the incorporation of [(14)CH3]choline into phosphatidylcholine and observed similar effects. Lipogenesis is significantly affected by pretreatment of prostate cancer cells with fatostatin A, which blocks sterol regulatory element-binding protein proteolytic cleavage and activation. This study demonstrates that α2M* functions as a growth factor, leading to proliferation of prostate cancer cells by promoting insulin-like responses.
