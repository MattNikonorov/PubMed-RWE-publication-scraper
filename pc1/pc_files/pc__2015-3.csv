Hysterectomy, which may be open hysterectomy (O/HYST) or laparoscopic hysterectomy (L/HYST), has been increasingly frequently done via robot (R/HYST). Small case series suggest increased corneal abrasions (CAs) with less invasive techniques.  Methods:   The authors identified RP (166,942), O/HYST (583,298), or L/HYST (216,890) discharges with CA in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2000-2011). For 2009-2011, they determined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CA, in R/PROST, non-R/PROST, L/HYST, O/HYST, and R/HYST. Uni- and multivariate models studied CA risk depending on surgical procedure, age, race, year, chronic illness, and malignancy.  Results:   In 2000-2011, 0.18% RP, 0.13% L/HYST, and 0.03% O/HYST sustained CA. Compared with 17,554 non-R/PROSTs (34 abrasions, 0.19%) in 2009-2011, OR was not significantly higher in 28,521 R/PROSTs (99, 0.35%; OR 1.508; CI 0.987 to 2.302; P < 0.057). CA significantly increased in L/HYST (70/51,323; 0.136%) versus O/HYST (70/191,199; 0.037%; OR 3.821; CI 2.594 to 5.630; P < 0.0001), further increasing in R/HYST (63/21, 213; 0.297%; OR 6.505; CI 4.323 to 9.788; P < 0.0001). For hysterectomy, risk of CA increased with age (OR 1.020; CI 1.007 to 1.034; P < 0.003) and number of chronic conditions (OR 1.139; CI 1.065 to 1.219; P < 0.0001). CA risk was likewise elevated in R/HYST with number of chronic conditions. Being African American significantly decreased CA risk in R/PROST and in R/HYST or L/HYST.  Conclusions:   L/HYST increased CA nearly four-fold, and R/HYST approximately 6.5-fold versus O/HYST. Identifiable preoperative factors are associated with either increased risk (age, chronic conditions) or decreased risk (race).""","""['Ajay Sampat', 'Isaac Parakati', 'Rangesh Kunnavakkam', 'David B Glick', 'Nita K Lee', 'Meaghan Tenney', 'Scott Eggener', 'Steven Roth']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anesthesiology""","""['Risk Factors for Intraprostatic Incision into Malignant Glands at Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy: results from the nationwide inpatient sample.', 'Comparison of Acute and Chronic Surgical Complications Following Robot-Assisted, Laparoscopic, and Traditional Open Radical Prostatectomy Among Men in Taiwan.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Pure laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Perioperative Care of the Patient with Eye Pathologies Undergoing Nonocular Surgery.', 'Complications in robotic urological surgeries and how to avoid them: A systematic review.', 'Total intravenous anaesthesia versus inhalational anaesthesia for adults undergoing transabdominal robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery.']"""

They make up an important part of the diet and have a broad spectrum of biological activities such as cytotoxic and antitumor effects. Lupiwighteone (Lup) is an isoflavone-type compound. It is distributed widely in wild-growing plants such as Glycyrrhiza glabra, Lupinus, and Lotus pedunculatus. On the basis of existing research, Lup shows antioxidant and antimicrobial effects, but its antitumor activity has not been reported as yet. This study aimed to examine the antitumor activity of Lup, explore its antitumor mechanism in a human prostate carcinoma cell line (DU-145), and evaluate its antiangiogenetic activity in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC). The results showed that Lup could inhibit the growth of DU-145 and HUVEC cells in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that Lup could induce cell cycle arrest, cells apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, and an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species of DU-145 cells. Upregulation of Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3, and PARP-1 protein expressions and downregulation of Bcl-2, procaspase-9, and p-Akt protein expressions were observed by western blot after the treatment of Lup. Furthermore, the effects of Lup on the cellular behavior of HUVECs were also investigated. Altogether, our data proved the anticancer and antiangiogenesis potential of Lup.""","""['Jie Ren', 'Qianhui Huang', 'Yuanyuan Xu', 'Meng Yang', 'Jie Yang', 'Kun Hu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Lupiwighteone induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and activates the Nrf2/ARE pathway in human neuroblastoma cells.', ""2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside protects human umbilical vein endothelial cells against lysophosphatidylcholine-induced apoptosis by upregulating superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase."", 'Solena amplexicaulis induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis in hepatocarcinoma cells and HUVECs.', 'SRJ23, a new semisynthetic andrographolide derivative: in vitro growth inhibition and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'The mechanisms of anticancer agents by genistein and synthetic derivatives of isoflavone.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway by Different Flavonoids: A Cancer Chemopreventive Approach.', 'Genistein: An Integrative Overview of Its Mode of Action, Pharmacological Properties, and Health Benefits.']"""

Objectives:   We conducted a nested case-control study, using prospectively collected serum, to estimate associations between OC exposures and metastatic prostate cancer in a population-based cohort from Norway.  Methods:   Sera from 150 cases and 314 controls matched on date of blood draw, age at blood draw, and region was used to determine concentrations of 11 OC pesticide metabolites and 34 PCB congeners. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for quartiles of lipid-corrected metabolite levels were calculated using conditional logistic regression.  Results:   Metastatic prostate cancer was two times as likely among men with serum concentrations of oxychlordane in the highest quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile (OR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.03, 4.03; p-trend 0.05). Elevated but nonsignificant ORs were estimated for the highest versus lowest quartile of heptachlor epoxide, HCB, and mirex, although these exposures were correlated with oxychlordane. Findings for specific PCB congeners showed a significant inverse association between natural log-transformed lipid-adjusted PCB 44 and metastatic prostate cancer (OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.97; p-trend = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Our study highlights the importance of estimating associations with specific OC chemicals and suggests a possible role of OC insecticides and PCBs in the etiology of metastatic prostate cancer.

Methods:   To verify VMAT delivery accuracy, gamma evaluations, analysis of mechanical parameter difference between plans and log files, and analysis of changes in dose-volumetric parameters between plans and plans reconstructed with log files were performed with 40 VMAT plans. The average proportion of leaf speeds ranging from l to h cm s(-1) (Sl-h and l-h = 0-0.4, 0.4-0.8, 0.8-1.2, 1.2-1.6 and 1.6-2.0), mean and standard deviation of MLC speeds were calculated for each VMAT plan. The same was carried out for accelerations in centimetre per second squared (Al-h and l-h = 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-16 and 16-20). The correlations of those indicators to plan delivery accuracy were analysed with Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs).  Results:   The S1.2-1.6 and mean acceleration of MLCs showed generally higher correlations to plan delivery accuracy than did others. The highest rs values were observed between S1.2-1.6 and global 1%/2 mm (rs = -0.698 with p < 0.001) as well as mean acceleration and global 1%/2 mm (rs = -0.650 with p < 0.001). As the proportion of MLC speeds and accelerations >0.4 and 4 cm s(-2) increased, the plan delivery accuracy of VMAT decreased.

It is possibly related to pelvic nerve injury. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of pudendal nerve dysfunction in men with FI after EBRT for prostate cancer compared to men with FI but no history of EBRT.  Material and methods:   Data were evaluated from 74 men with intact anal sphincters on endo-anal ultrasound (17 post-EBRT) who had been investigated for FI at a tertiary center. Wexner incontinence scores, pudendal nerve function, anorectal manometry, and rectal sensitivity were compared between the two patient groups.  Results:   Post-radiotherapy patients were older (77±6 vs. 62±17 years, p<0.005) and had worse incontinence than those with no history of radiotherapy (Wexner score; 13±3 vs. 8±4; p<0.005). Bilateral pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) was abnormal in 87% of radiotherapy versus 22% of non-radiotherapy patients (p<0.001) and the significant difference persisted even after correction for age differences. Anal sphincter pressures and rectal sensitivity for both groups were similar.  Conclusion:   There is a markedly higher incidence of pudendal nerve dysfunction in men with FI after EBRT for prostate cancer compared with men with FI from other etiologies. The increased severity of incontinence in radiotherapy patients is not matched by alterations in either anal sphincter pressures or rectal sensitivity compared to FI in non-ERBT patients.""","""['Arun Loganathan', 'Ann C Schloithe', 'Jonathon Hutton', 'Eric K Yeoh', 'Robert Fraser', 'Phillip G Dinning', 'David Wattchow']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Pudendal nerve injury impairs anorectal function and health related quality of life measures ≥2 years after 3D conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency is associated with decreased resting and squeeze pressures in the intact anal sphincter.', 'The utility of pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies in idiopathic incontinence.', 'Fecal incontinence.

For the first time, stage completeness is high enough for robust analysis for the whole of England.  Methods:   We analysed data from the National Cancer Registration Service's (NCRS) Cancer Analysis System on persons diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung, prostate or ovarian cancers in England in 2012. One-year relative survival (followed-up to the end of 2013) was calculated along with adjusted excess rate ratios, for mortality within 1 year.  Results:   One-year relative survival decreased with increasing stage at diagnosis. For breast, prostate and colorectal cancers survival showed a major reduction for stage 4 cancers, whereas for lung and ovarian cancers there were substantial decreases in relative survival for each level of increase in stage. Excess rate ratios for mortality within 1 year of diagnosis showed that stage and age were the most important cofactors, but they also identified the statistically significant effects of sex, income deprivation and geographic area of residence.  Conclusions:   Further reductions in mortality may be most effectively achieved by diagnosing all cancers before they progress to stage 4, but for lung and ovarian cancers there is also a need for a stage shift to earlier stages together with efforts to improve stage-specific survival at all stages.""","""['S McPhail', 'S Johnson', 'D Greenberg', 'M Peake', 'B Rous']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Emergency presentation of cancer and short-term mortality.', 'Mortality rates by stage-at-diagnosis.', 'Evidence of increasing mortality with longer diagnostic intervals for five common cancers: a cohort study in primary care.', 'Changes in diet and mortality from selected cancers in southern Mediterranean countries, 1960-1989.', 'Changes in and Impact of the Death Review Process in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Circulating tumour cells for early detection of clinically relevant cancer.', 'Effectiveness of an Educational Program on Awareness of Breast Cancer Risk Factors, Symptoms, and Barriers to Seeking Medical Help among Adolescent Omani School Students-An Interventional Study.', 'Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Cervical Cancer Stage at Diagnosis: Mediating Effects of Neighborhood-level Socioeconomic Deprivation.', 'Protocol for a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial assessing the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Electronic RIsk-assessment for CAncer for patients in general practice (ERICA).', 'Intercontinental comparison of women with breast cancer treated by oncologists in Europe, Asia, and Latin America: a retrospective study of 99,571 patients.']"""

Current clinical and pathologic parameters are insufficient for accurate risk prediction leading primarily to overtreatment and also missed opportunities for curative therapy.  Experimental design:   An 8-biomarker proteomic assay for intact tissue biopsies predictive of prostate pathology was defined in a study of 381 patient biopsies with matched prostatectomy specimens. A second blinded study of 276 cases validated this assay's ability to distinguish ""favorable"" versus ""nonfavorable"" pathology independently and relative to current risk classification systems National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN and D'Amico).  Results:   A favorable biomarker risk score of ≤0.33, and a nonfavorable risk score of >0.80 (possible range between 0 and 1) were defined on ""false-negative"" and ""false-positive"" rates of 10% and 5%, respectively.

The predictive value for nonfavorable pathology was 76.9% at biomarker risk scores >0.8 across all risk groups. Increased biomarker risk scores correlated with decreased frequency of favorable cases across all risk groups.

Results:   The concentration of E-cadherin was lower in patients with prostate cancer compared to the control group, but there was no difference in the concentration of MMP-13 between these two groups. During treatment, however, we found no significant differences between the concentrations of MMP-13 and E-cadherin, but we observed a significant positive correlation between total PSA and E-cadherin plasma concentration at the third month of treatment and between total testosterone and MMP-13 plasma concentration before the start of treatment.

The expression of CTAs along with control genes was measured from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate cancer tissues using real-time polymerase chain reaction and the nCounter assay.  Results:   Using a nanowire-based assay, ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression levels of the CTAs CSAG2 and NOL4 were found to be significantly higher in men with Gleason score (GS) 8-10 disease than those with GS ≤4+3 disease. On the contrary, the RNA expression level of PAGE4 was lower in men with GS 8-10 disease than those with GS ≤6 group. This study demonstrates that CTAs can be detected with a nanostring assay that is translatable and that a set of CTAs correlates with the clinical characteristics of the disease.  Conclusion:   CTAs represent unique, cancer-associated biomarkers with potential utility in the clinic. The nCounter nanowire technology provides an opportunity to evaluate this panel of CTAs associated with aggressive prostate cancer in a multi-institutional fashion.""","""['Sayuri Takahashi', 'Takumi Shiraishi', 'Nancy Miles', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Prakash Kulkarni', 'Robert H Getzenberg']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Cancer/Testis Antigens: ""Smart"" Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate and Other Cancers.', 'Cancer/testis antigens: novel tools for discerning aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Cancer/Testis Antigens as potential predictors of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy.', 'Expression of cancer/testis antigens in prostate cancer is associated with disease progression.', 'Clinical evaluation of prostate cancer gene 3 score in diagnosis among Chinese men with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'ESS2 controls prostate cancer progression through recruitment of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1.', 'Evaluation of NUF2 and GMNN Expression in Prostate Cancer: Potential Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Cancer Testis Antigen, NOL4, Is an Immunogenic Antigen Specifically Expressed in Small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'A Protein Microarray-Based Investigation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Reveals Distinct Autoantibody Signature in Low and High-Grade Gliomas.', 'Molecular profiling of radical prostatectomy tissue from patients with no sign of progression identifies ERG as the strongest independent predictor of recurrence.']"""

Methods:   On the basis of a population-based study of men undergoing surgery or radiotherapy for prostate cancer in Ontario between 2002 and 2009, we undertook a propensity score-matched analysis including age, comorbidity, and year of treatment to assess treatment-related complication end points.

Methods:   We analyzed serum androstenedione levels in 317 prostate cancer cases and 353 controls, nested in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, a randomized placebo-controlled trial that found finasteride decreased prostate cancer risk. Androstenedione is the second most important circulating androgen in men besides testosterone and also a substrate for 5α-reductase enzyme.  Results:   We observed a 22% increase in androstenedione levels compared with the baseline values in subjects who were treated with finasteride for 3 years. This significant increase did not vary by case-control status. Adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for the third tertile of absolute change in androstenedione levels compared with the first tertile were 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.94) for low-grade (Gleason score <7) cases. Similar results were observed when analyzed using percent change. There were no significant associations between serum androstenedione levels and the risk of high-grade disease.  Conclusion:   The results of this nested case-control study confirm that finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and of androstenedione to 5α-androstanedione-3,17-dione, which also leads to the reduction of DHT formation.

This has raised questions about the additional value of US cancer care derived from this additional spending. We calculated the number of US cancer deaths averted, compared to the situation in Western Europe, between 1982 and 2010 for twelve cancer types. We also assessed the value of US cancer care, compared to that in Western Europe, by estimating the ratio of additional spending on cancer to the number of quality-adjusted life-years saved. Compared to Western Europe, for three of the four costliest US cancers-breast, colorectal, and prostate-there were approximately 67,000, 265,000, and 60,000 averted US deaths, respectively, and for lung cancer there were roughly 1,120,000 excess deaths in the study period. The ratio of incremental cost to quality-adjusted life-years saved equaled $402,000 for breast cancer, $110,000 for colorectal cancer, and $1,979,000 for prostate cancer-amounts that exceed most accepted thresholds for cost-effective medical care.

Results:   From 2006 to 2012, 10,656 men were on antiandrogens (AA), 26,959 were on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and 3,747 underwent surgical orchiectomy. CVD risk was increased in men on GnRH agonists compared with the comparison cohort (hazard ratio [HR] of incident CVD, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.25; and orchiectomy: HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.25). Men with PCa on AA were at decreased risk (HR of incident CVD, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.91). CVD risk was highest during the first 6 months of ADT in men who experienced two or more cardiovascular events before therapy, with an HR of CVD during the first 6 months of GnRH agonist therapy of 1.91 (95% CI, 1.66 to 2.20), an HR of CVD with AA of 1.60 (95% CI, 1.24 to 2.06), and an HR of CVD with orchiectomy of 1.79 (95% CI, 1.16 to 2.76) versus the comparison cohort.

Although the results from human studies have been mainly null for overall PCa risk, there may be a benefit for survival. This study assessed the associations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and common variations in key vitamin D-related genes with fatal PCa.  Methods:   In a large cohort consortium, 518 fatal cases and 2986 controls with 25(OH)D data were identified. Genotyping information for 91 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 7 vitamin D-related genes (vitamin D receptor, group-specific component, cytochrome P450 27A1 [CYP27A1], CYP27B1, CYP24A1, CYP2R1, and retinoid X receptor α) was available for 496 fatal cases and 3577 controls. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of 25(OH)D and SNPs with fatal PCa. The study also tested for 25(OH)D-SNP interactions among 264 fatal cases and 1169 controls.

Methods:   From 2004 to 2011, a total of 103 consecutive patients presenting with advanced prostate cancer were included in this study. All patients were treated with surgical castration as androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Germline DNA was extracted from archived tissue from each patient and sequenced. PSA half-time (representing rate to PSA nadir after ADT), the incidence of, and time to CRPC occurrence, and cause-specific mortality rates were determined during the 3-10 years follow-up. The perioperative data and postoperative outcomes are compared. The patients were retrospectively analyzed for survival time.  Results:   Of the 103 patient samples analyzed, 18 harbored a heterozygous variant (1245C) HSD3B1 gene, while 85 patients were homozygous wild-type (1245A) for HSD3B1. The two groups were homogenous for age, PSA, Gleason and metastases rate preoperatively. The incidence of CRPC observed in the variant group was significantly higher than that of wild-type group (100% vs. 64.7%, respectively; P = 0.003). Despite this higher incidence of CRPC, there were no significant differences in time to develop CRPC, or in cause-specific mortality. Further, neither PSA half-time, nor time to biochemical recurrence were different between the variant and wild-type groups.

Prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcript 1 (PCAT-1) is one of the lncRNAs involved in cell apoptosis and proliferation of prostate cancer. This study aimed to assess the potential role of PCAT-1 specifically in the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of PCAT-1 in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 130 patients with ESCC, 34 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 30 patients with gastric carcinoma (GC). The correlation of PCAT-1 with clinicopathological features and prognosis were also analyzed. The expression of PCAT-1 was significantly higher in human ESCC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (70.8%, p < 0.01), and the high level of PCAT-1 expression was significantly correlated with invasion of the tumor (p = 0.024), advanced clinical stage (p = 0.003), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.032), and poor prognosis. However, PCAT-1 mRNA expression had no significant difference between paired primary cancerous tissues and the adjacent noncancerous tissues in 34 cases of NSCLC (p = 0.293) and 30 cases of GC (p = 0.125). High expression of PCAT-1 was specifically correlated with invasion of cancer tissues, metastasis of lymph node, and advanced tumor stage of ESCC. High expression of PCAT-1 might reflect poor prognosis of ESCC and indicate a potential diagnostic target in ESCC patients.

Methods:   qRT-PCR was performed to validate the differential expression of miRNAs in clinical samples, and the effect of miR-1247-5p was studied in prostate cancer cell lines transiently transfected with a miR-1247-5p mimic. The expression of miR-1247-5p's putative target MYCBP2 was evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, and the interaction of the miRNA with the target gene was assessed using a luciferase assay.  Results:   We found a significant up-regulation of miR-1247-5p in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) samples compared to non-malignant prostate. The expression of miR-1247-5p was subsequently studied in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines where an up-regulation of miR-1247-5p was observed in the androgen-independent PC-3 model. Target prediction analysis for miR-1247-5p performed online revealed that MYCBP2 (myc-binding protein 2) was a high-scoring potential target. Functional studies in vitro performed using PC-3 and LNCaP models confirmed the down-regulation of MYCBP2 at the mRNA and protein levels, and a luciferase assay showed interaction between the miRNA and target gene.

The polymersomes were obtained from the self-assembly of lipid-containing copolymer, poly(acrylic acid-co-distearin acrylate), in aqueous solution. The Cy5.5 and Gd(III) species were loaded into polymersomes via hydrophobic association (loading efficiency of Cy5.5 ca 74%) and electrostatic complexation (Gd(III) 83%), respectively. The Cy5.5/Gd(III)-loaded polymersomes (CGLPs) have shown excellent payload confinement, reduced dilution effect on assembly dissociation and decreased protein/salt-induced colloidal aggregation. Owing to the highly hydrated structure of vesicular membrane, the superior contrast enhancement of CGLPs in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was obtained as a result of prolonged rotational correlation time of Gd(III) cations and fast water exchange from Gd(III) to bulk solution. The CGLPs exhibit a 15-fold higher longitudinal relaxivity value (ca 60 mM(-1) s(-1)) than that (4 mM(-1) s(-1)) of the commercial contrast agent, Magnevist, in phosphate buffered saline. The in vivo characterization demonstrates that CGLPs exhibit a signal-to-noise ratio in T1-weighted MR image contrast similar to that of Magnevist, yet with a Gd dose 5-fold lower. An excellent contrast in NIR imaging at tumor site was attained following the intravenous injection of GGLPs into Tramp-C1 tumor-bearing mice (C57BL/6).

Second generation anti-androgen therapies are more efficient at blocking nuclear AR; however resistant tumors still develop. Recent studies indicate Src is highly active in these resistant tumors. By manipulating AR activity in several different prostate cancer cell lines through RNAi, drug treatment, and the use of a nuclear-deficient AR mutant, we demonstrate that androgen acting on cytoplasmic AR rapidly stimulates Src tyrosine kinase via a non-genomic mechanism. Cytoplasmic AR, acting through Src enhances laminin integrin-dependent invasion. Active Matriptase, which cleaves laminin, is elevated within minutes after androgen stimulation, and is subsequently shed into the medium. Matriptase activation and shedding induced by cytoplasmic AR is dependent on Src. Concomitantly, CDCP1/gp140, a Matriptase and Src substrate that controls integrin-based migration, is activated. However, only inhibition of Matriptase, but not CDCP1, suppresses the AR/Src-dependent increase in invasion. Matriptase, present in conditioned medium from AR-stimulated cells, is sufficient to enhance invasion in the absence of androgen. Thus, invasion is stimulated by a rapid but sustained increase in Src activity, mediated non-genomically by cytoplasmic AR, leading to rapid activation and shedding of the laminin protease Matriptase.""","""['Jelani C Zarif', 'Laura E Lamb', 'Veronique V Schulz', 'Eric A Nollet', 'Cindy K Miranti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'HOXC8 inhibits androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells by inhibiting SRC-3 recruitment to direct androgen target genes.', 'Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Oncogenic activation of androgen receptor.', 'Serum Androgen Metabolites Correlate with Clinical Variables in African and European American Men with Localized, Therapy Naïve Prostate Cancer.', 'The androgen receptor is a therapeutic target in desmoplastic small round cell sarcoma.', 'Unravelling the Role of Kinases That Underpin Androgen Signalling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Membrane-Initiated Estrogen, Androgen, and Progesterone Receptor Signaling in Health and Disease.', 'Loss of CDCP1 triggers FAK activation in detached prostate cancer cells.']"""

Results:   At pretreatment, 4 subgroups were identified: resilient group, with little to no symptom reporting; adjusted group, with moderately high treatment-related symptoms, low insomnia, depression, and anxiety; distressed group, consistently high on most symptoms; and emerging group, with moderately high fatigue, depression, and anxiety with few treatment-related symptoms. At posttreatment, similar results were seen in groups to those at pretreatment: resilient, adjusted. and distressed groups with an impacted group having high pain, insomnia, depression, and urinary and bowel symptoms. Quality of life and participant characteristics further distinguished groups at pretreatment and posttreatment. Income level predicted a transition in group membership.  Conclusions:   Men can be classified into distinctly different subgroups over time.  Implications for practice:   Assessment and intervention with men in subgroups such as distressed and emerging before and during treatment may lessen potential for remaining distressed or moving into impacted group where symptom severity is high at posttreatment.

The adhesion molecule MUC18 is a cell membrane glycoprotein also known as the melanoma cell adhesion molecule. As MUC18 has proangiogenic potency in melanoma and prostate cancer this study investigated the role of MUC18 in patients with stenotic or dilatative arteriosclerotic disease as a putative biochemical marker.  Methods:   Using qRT-PCR, Western Blot and immunohistochemistry techniques, the expression of MUC18 in arteriosclerotic arteries from major lower limb amputates (AP, N.=15) as well as specimen from femoral endarterectomies (TEA, N.=20) and in dilatative aortic diseases using abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA, N.=13) was evaluated. Human visceral arteries without macroscopic arteriosclerosis from liver transplants served as controls (AN, N.=19).  Results:   MUC18 mRNA and protein expression could be found in AN, AP, TEA and AAA tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that a complete and intact intima was the predominant location of MUC18 expression. Although in stenotic arteriosclerotic disease (AP and TEA) the intima was widely calcified, qRT-PCR analysis showed overexpression compared to normal tissue. Interestingly, MUC18 expression was significantly down-regulated in dilatative compared to stenotic arteriosclerotic disease and normal arteries.  Conclusion:   In peripheral stenotic arteriosclerotic disease the proangiogenic potency of MUC18 may play a role in angiogenesis of collaterals, whereas in dilatative aortic diseases the induction of collaterals is typically not evident.

Methods:   We carried out a retrospective study of 2735 men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database treated by radical prostatectomy from 1988 to 2011 with data available on pathological stage, grade and preoperative prostate-specific antigen. We used Cox hazards analyses to examine the predictive accuracy (c-index) of the preoperative prostate-specific antigen (log-transformed), path Gleason score (≤ 7, 3 + 4, 4 + 3 and 8-10) and path stage grouping (pT2 negative margins; pT2 positive margins; pT3a negative margins; pT3a positive margins; pT3b; vs positive nodes) to predict biochemical recurrence, castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastases and prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   Median follow up was 8.7 years, during which, 937 (34%) had biochemical recurrence, 108 (4%) castration-resistant prostate cancer, 127 (5%) metastases and 68 (2%) prostate cancer-specific mortality.

Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a member of the lipocalin family, is aberrantly expressed in some human cancers and has been implicated in the progression of some tumors. However, the role of LCN2 in the metastatic capacity of prostate cancer (PCa) is poorly understood.  Methods:   LCN2 expression was examined by RT-qPCR and/or immunoblotting in human prostate tissue specimens and prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, C4-2, 22RV1, PC3, DU-145, and PC3MM2. LCN2 protein level in human serum samples was determined by ELISA. Lentiviruses-mediated over-expression of LCN2 and knockdown of LCN2 was conducted to evaluate the role of LCN2 in cell migratory and invasive capacities of prostate cancer cells. Cell migration and invasion was examined by transwell chamber assay. Knockdown of SLUG by lentivirus was performed to investigate its role in LCN2-promoted cell migration and invasion in vitro (22RV1 cell line) and metastasis in vivo (tail vein metastasis assay in nude mice). Role of ERK signaling in LCN2-mediated up-regulation of SLUG was assayed by using ERK inhibitor U0126.  Results:   We confirmed that LCN2 levels were correlated positively with invasive prostate cancer in human tissue and serum samples, and were also consistently associated with the invasive capacity of prostate cancer cell lines. The over-expression of LCN2 in 22RV1 cells (not highly invasive) promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increasing cell motility and invasiveness, while the knockdown of LCN2 in PC3 cells (highly invasive) inhibited EMT, decreasing cell motility and invasiveness. Among the multiple EMT transcription factors, LCN2 specifically induces the expression of SLUG, which was shown here to be required for the LCN2-induced increase in the invasive capacity of prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LCN2 promoted SLUG expression via activating ERK signaling pathway.  Conclusion:   LCN2 plays an important role in promoting cell migration and invasion of prostate cancer by inducing EMT through the ERK/SLUG axis. Therefore, targeted inhibition of LCN2 may represent a therapeutic strategy to prevent the metastasis of prostate cancer.""","""['Guanxiong Ding', 'Jie Fang', 'Shijun Tong', 'Lianxi Qu', 'Haowen Jiang', 'Qiang Ding', 'Jun Liu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Knockdown of lipocalin-2 suppresses the growth and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'Lipocalin-2 negatively modulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma through the epidermal growth factor (TGF-beta1)/Lcn2/Twist1 pathway.', 'AKR1C3, a crucial androgenic enzyme in prostate cancer, promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis through activating ERK signaling.', 'Lipocalin 2 in cancer: when good immunity goes bad.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'The Review of Current Knowledge on Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL).', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Long non-coding RNAs involved in different steps of cancer metastasis.', 'Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) Deficiency Leads to Cellular Changes in Highly Metastatic Human Prostate Cancer Cell Line PC-3.', 'Lipocalin-2 silencing suppresses inflammation and oxidative stress of acute respiratory distress syndrome by ferroptosis via inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway in neonatal mice.']"""

AR activity is closely involved in the maintenance and progression of prostate cancer. After the binding with androgen, AR moves into nucleus and binds to DNA sequence containing androgen response elements (ARE). Flavin-dependent monoamine oxidase KDM1A is necessary for AR driven transcription while the mechanism remains unclear.  Methods:   The association between androgen-dependent transcription and oxidation was tested through pharmaceutical inhibitions and siRNA knockdown of DNA oxidation repair components in prostate cancer cells. The recruitment of involved proteins and the histone methylation dynamics on ARE region was explored by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).  Results:   Oxidation inhibition reduced AR dependent expression of KLK3, TMPRSS2, hsa-miR-125b2, and hsa-miR-133b. And such reduction could be restored by H2 O2 treatment. KDM1A recruitment and H3K4me2 demethylation on ARE regions, which produce H2 O2 , are associated with AR targets transcription. AR targets transcription and coupled oxidation recruit 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and the nuclease APEX1 to ARE regions. Such recruitment depends on KDM1A, and is necessary for AR targets transcription.

How other oncogenes or tumor suppressors interact with this pathway remain to be elucidated. SLUG is an zinc finger transcription factor of the Snail superfamily, and it promotes cancer metastasis and determines the mammary stem cell state.  Methods:   SLUG was overexpressed in cells by retroviral vector and knockdown of SLUG and PTEN was mediated by shRNAs-expressing lentiviruses. Expression level of SLUG and PTEN was examined by Western blot, RT-PCR, and qPCR analyses. PTEN promoter activity was measured by luciferase reporter assay. ChIP assay was used to measure the binding between SLUG and the PTEN promoter in vivo.  Result:   We showed that overexpression of SLUG decreased expression of PTEN tumor repressor in prostate cancer cell lines 22RV1 and DU145; conversely, knockdown of SLUG expression elevated PTEN expresson at both protein and RNA level in these cells. We demonstrated that SLUG overexpression inhibits PTEN promoter activity through the proximal promoter region in prostate cancer cells. By ChIP assay, we confirmed that SLUG directly binds to the PTEN promoter region covering the E-box sites. We also showed that Slug deficiency leads to an increased expression of PTEN in mouse embryo fibroblasts and prostate tissues. Importantly, we found that overexpression of SLUG increases drug resistance of DU145 prostate cancer cell line and knockdown of SLUG by shRNA sensitizes DU145 cell line to chemotherapeutic drugs. We further demonstrated that PTEN knockdown converts drug sensitivity of DU145 cells expressing SLUG shRNA to anticancer drugs.  Conclusion:   We provide compelling evidence showing that PTEN is a direct functional target of SLUG.

We hypothesized that men with TMPRSS2:ERG positive tumors are more responsive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods:   We studied a cohort of 239 men with prostate cancer from the Physicians' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study who received ADT during their disease course. Fusion status was assessed on available tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry for ERG protein expression. We used Cox models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for assessment of prostate cancer-specific mortality after ADT initiation.  Results:   Roughly half of the men had stage T3 or higher tumors at diagnosis and 39% had Gleason 8-10 tumors. During an average follow up of 10.2 years, 42 men died from prostate cancer. There was a non-significant inverse association between positive fusion status and time to death from prostate cancer after ADT (multivariable HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.40-1.45). Harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of prostate cancer mortality among men who were treated with orchiectomy (multivariable HR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03-0.62), based on 15 events.  Conclusions:   Our results, combined with those from earlier studies, provide suggestive evidence that men with TMPRSS2:ERG positive tumors may have longer prostate cancer survival after ADT.

We studied the expression and activity of SMYD3 in a preclinical model of colorectal cancer (CRC) and found that it is strongly upregulated throughout tumorigenesis both at the mRNA and protein level. Our results also showed that RNAi-mediated SMYD3 ablation impairs CRC cell proliferation indicating that SMYD3 is required for proper cancer cell growth. These data, together with the importance of lysine methyltransferases as a target for drug discovery, prompted us to carry out a virtual screening to identify new SMYD3 inhibitors by testing several candidate small molecules. Here we report that one of these compounds (BCI-121) induces a significant reduction in SMYD3 activity both in vitro and in CRC cells, as suggested by the analysis of global H3K4me2/3 and H4K5me levels. Of note, the extent of cell growth inhibition by BCI-121 was similar to that observed upon SMYD3 genetic ablation. Most of the results described above were obtained in CRC; however, when we extended our observations to tumor cell lines of different origin, we found that SMYD3 inhibitors are also effective in other cancer types, such as lung, pancreatic, prostate, and ovarian.

During tumor progression, EMT can be induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signal that epithelial cells receive from their microenvironment. However, the master regulatory controls on TGF-β-EMT axis are not understood.  Methods:   The protein expression in human specimens was measured by immunohistochemical staining. E74-like factor 5 (Elf5) was silenced by short interfering RNAs in LNCaP cells and stably overexpressed by HA-tagged Elf5 cDNAs in 22Rv1 cells. These cells were used to study migration and anchorage-independent growth.  Results:   Our data reveal that Elf5 results in the failure of mesenchymal morphogenesis, upregulation of EMT markers, spheres formation, and migration in the presence of TGF-β. Furthermore, Elf5 blocks TGF-β signaling, through decreasing drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein (SMAD3) activation by binding to it, one of the major effector of TGF-β-induced EMT. Moreover, Elf5 can serve as a prognostic marker of metastasis-free survival in patients with TGF-β-positive prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Elf5 expression is inversely correlated with EMT. Elf5 inhibits TGF-β-driven EMT via repressing SMAD3 phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells. In addition, Elf5 can be used as a biomarker of metastasis-free survival in patients with TGF-β-positive prostate cancer.""","""['Bing Yao', 'Jinsheng Zhao', 'Yalin Li', 'Hui Li', 'Zhaojun Hu', 'Pan Pan', 'Yiran Zhang', 'E Du', 'Ranlu Liu', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Re: Elf5 Inhibits TGF-β-Driven Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer by Repressing SMAD3 Activation.', 'Re: Elf5 Inhibits TGF-β-Driven Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer by Repressing SMAD3 Activation.', 'NEDD9 crucially regulates TGF-β-triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion in prostate cancer cells: involvement in cancer progressiveness.', 'JAK/STAT3 signaling is required for TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer cells.', 'Phosphorylation status at Smad3 linker region modulates transforming growth factor-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer progression.', 'TGF-β signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer progression.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity landscape: principles of design and mechanisms of regulation.', 'The ELF3 transcription factor is associated with an epithelial phenotype and represses epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'ELF5 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells by regulating CD24.', 'The role of microRNA-572 in the proliferation and chemotherapeutic treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Capturing dynamic relevance in Boolean networks using graph theoretical measures.']"""

Methods:   This population-based cohort study included 185,667 men having a first recorded PSA test and 18,574 men having a first prostate biopsy in Stockholm County, Sweden for the period 2007-2012. Detailed clinical information including PSA levels, biopsy results, comorbidities and educational level were obtained from population-based registers. High-grade prostate cancer was defined as a Gleason score of seven or higher. Differences in PSA levels by medication status were estimated using linear regression on log PSA values. PCa risk was estimated using multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   Compared with men who were not on medication, the PSA level at the first PSA test was lower among men using 75 mg/dose aspirin (-3.9% change in PSA concentration; 95% confidence interval (CI): -5.8 to -2.1), statin (-4.6%; 95% CI: -6.2 to -2.9), metformin (-14%; 95% CI: -17 to -12) and insulin (-16%; 95% CI: -18 to -14).

We present our experience with salvage prostate brachytherapy (BT) for local recurrence after definitive external beam radiotherapy with attention to the relationship between dose and late toxicity.  Methods and materials:   From 2005 to 2012, 18 patients with biopsy proven locally recurrent prostate cancer and negative staging received low-dose-rate BT with a prescribed dose of 130-144 Gy. Toxicities were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.  Results:   Median followup is 31.5 months (range, 12-104). International Prostate Symptom Scores peaked at 3 months (median, 21/35), returning to baseline by 24 months. Urinary catheterization rate was 33% (median duration, 14 days; range, 1-90 days). Late Grade 3/4 genitourinary toxicity occurred in 1 patient each, one of whom also had Grade 3 late gastrointestinal toxicity; urethral strictures developed in three others. These 5 patients with late toxicity had higher dose to the prostate (isodose enclosing 90% [D90] median, 151 Gy; range, 135-185 Gy) compared with those without late complications (median, 134 Gy; range, 105-165; p < 0.04).

Patients and methods:   From January 2008 through November 2012, 4,023 patients underwent RARP by a single surgeon at our institution. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data identified 3,362 men who had minimum of 1-year follow-up. This cohort of patients was stratified into six groups: Group I, aged ≥70 years (451 patients); Group II, BMI ≥35 kg/m(2) (197); Group III, prior bladder neck procedures (103); Group IV, prostate weight ≥80 g (280); and Group V, salvage prostatectomy (41). Group VI consisted of patients (2 447) with none of these risk factors. Continence outcomes at follow-up were analysed for all groups.  Results:   The continence rate at 1 year and mean (sd) time to continence in different groups were: for patients aged ≥70 years, 85.6% and 3.2 (4.5) months; BMI of ≥35 kg/m(2) , 87.8% and 3.1 (4.5) months; prior bladder neck treatment, 82.4% and 3.4 (4.7) months; prostate weight of ≥80 g, 85.8% and 3.3 (4.4) months; salvage procedures, 51.3% and 6.6 (8.3) months; and in Group VI (none of the risk factors), 95.1% and 2.4 (3.2) months.

Estrogen-receptor-alpha (ERα) and ER-coregulators such as MLL-histone methylases are bound to the HOXC6 promoter upon exposure to E2 or BPA and that resulted in increased histone H3K4-trimethylation, histone acetylation, and recruitment of RNA polymerase II at the HOXC6 promoter. HOXC6 overexpression induces expression of tumor growth factors and facilitates growth 3D-colony formation, indicating its potential roles in tumor growth.

Materials and methods:   The study included 80 men with biopsy progression, 33 who opted out for personal reasons and 24 who initially did not meet entry criteria mainly due to increased prostate specific antigen density.  Results:   Of men who opted out 78.8% had a higher Gleason score of 6 than men who progressed on biopsy (46.2%, p = 0.002) and men with high prostate specific antigen density (45.8%, p = 0.02). Men with high prostate specific antigen density had less organ confined disease than the group that opted out (p <0.006) and a trend compared to the biopsy progression group (p = 0.07). Mean dominant tumor volume was lower in men who opted out than in those with biopsy progression (0.56 vs 1.1 cc, p = 0.03). The incidence of insignificant cancer was higher in men who opted out (48.4%) than in those with biopsy progression (28.4%, p = 0.05) and those with high prostate specific antigen density (20.8%, p = 0.035).

Conclusions:   The majority of men with biopsy progression still had tumors with features of curable disease. Men who opted out without biopsy progression had even less adverse findings, which supports counseling men to stay on active surveillance while they meet followup criteria. Men with elevated prostate specific antigen density had more anterior tumors and less organ confined cancer, substantiating that the ideal patients for active surveillance are those who meet all entry criteria.""","""['Andres Matoso', 'Oudai Hassan', 'Florencia Petrozzino', 'B Vishal Rao', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Pathological findings and prostate specific antigen outcomes after radical prostatectomy in men eligible for active surveillance--does the risk of misclassification vary according to biopsy criteria?', 'Expanded criteria to identify men eligible for active surveillance of low risk prostate cancer at Johns Hopkins: a preliminary analysis.', 'Population based study of predictors of adverse pathology among candidates for active surveillance with Gleason 6 prostate cancer.', 'Prostatectomy pathology findings in an active surveillance population.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.']"""

We used in silico methods to identify a bipartite nuclear localisation signal (NLS) in the extracellular domain and a monopartite NLS sequence in the intracellular kinase domain of EphB4. To determine whether both putative NLS sequences were functional, fragments of the EphB4 sequence containing each NLS were cloned to create EphB4NLS-GFP fusion proteins. Localisation of both NLS-GFP proteins to the nuclei of transfected cells was observed, demonstrating that EphB4 contains two functional NLS sequences. Mutation of the key amino residues in both NLS sequences resulted in diminished nuclear accumulation. As nuclear translocation is often dependent on importins we confirmed that EphB4 and importin-α can interact. To assess if nuclear EphB4 could be implicated in gene regulatory functions potential EphB4-binding genomic loci were identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation and Lef1 was confirmed as a potential target of EphB4-mediated gene regulation.

Crucially, however, the cancer-promoting EphB4 signalling pathways are independent of interaction with its ligand ephrin-B2, as activation of ligand-dependent signalling causes tumour suppression. Ephrin-B2, however, is often found on the surface of endothelial cells of the tumour vasculature, where it can regulate angiogenesis to support tumour growth. Proteolytic cleavage of endothelial cell ephrin-B2 has previously been suggested as one mechanism whereby the interaction between tumour cell-expressed EphB4 and endothelial cell ephrin-B2 is regulated to support both cancer promotion and angiogenesis.  Methods:   An in silico approach was used to search accessible surfaces of 3D protein models for cleavage sites for the key prostate cancer serine protease, KLK4, and this identified murine ephrin-B2 as a potential KLK4 substrate. Mouse ephrin-B2 was then confirmed as a KLK4 substrate by in vitro incubation of recombinant mouse ephrin-B2 with active recombinant human KLK4. Cleavage products were visualised by SDS-PAGE, silver staining and Western blot and confirmed by N-terminal sequencing.  Results:   At low molar ratios, KLK4 cleaved murine ephrin-B2 but other prostate-specific KLK family members (KLK2 and KLK3/PSA) were less efficient, suggesting cleavage was KLK4-selective. The primary KLK4 cleavage site in murine ephrin-B2 was verified and shown to correspond to one of the in silico predicted sites between extracellular domain residues arginine 178 and asparagine 179. Surprisingly, the highly homologous human ephrin-B2 was poorly cleaved by KLK4 at these low molar ratios, likely due to the 3 amino acid differences at this primary cleavage site.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that in in vivo mouse xenograft models, endogenous mouse ephrin-B2, but not human tumour ephrin-B2, may be a downstream target of cancer cell secreted human KLK4. This is a critical consideration when interpreting data from murine explants of human EphB4+/KLK4+ cancer cells, such as prostate cancer cells, where differential effects may be seen in mouse models as opposed to human clinical situations.""","""['J E Lisle', 'I Mertens-Walker', 'C R Stephens', 'S H Stansfield', 'J A Clements', 'A C Herington', 'S-A Stephenson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Substrates of the prostate-specific serine protease prostase/KLK4 defined by positional-scanning peptide libraries.', 'Evidence for a dual function of EphB4 as tumor promoter and suppressor regulated by the absence or presence of the ephrin-B2 ligand.', 'Interplay between EphB4 on tumor cells and vascular ephrin-B2 regulates tumor growth.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer and the potential role of kallikrein serine proteases.', 'Structures and specificity of the human kallikrein-related peptidases KLK 4, 5, 6, and 7.', 'Remodelling of the tumour microenvironment by the kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'Current Advances in Coptidis Rhizoma for Gastrointestinal and Other Cancers.', 'Overexpressed gene signature of EPH receptor A/B family in cancer patients-comprehensive analyses from the public high-throughput database.', 'EphrinB2-EphB4-RASA1 Signaling in Human Cerebrovascular Development and Disease.', 'ADAM10-mediated ephrin-B2 shedding promotes myofibroblast activation and organ fibrosis.']"""

In this study, we aim to investigate serum autoantibody signatures as PCa specific biomarkers. PCa proteins were resolved by 2-DE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which were subsequently incubated with either pooled serum from PCa patients or from normal controls. Mass spectrometry results have identified 18 antigens from 21 different 2-DE spots associated with PCa. Autoantibody response to antigens PRDX2, PRDX6 and ANXA11 in PCa patient's sera was confirmed using recombinant antigens. Further validation with an independent set of PCa patient's sera have shown relatively increased abundance of PRDX6 and ANXA11 antibodies in PCa patients. Formal concept analysis method was applied to assess whether the abundance of these autoantibodies could influence the classification of patients. However, sensitivity of the single antibody to discriminate prostate tumor and healthy controls varies from 70% to 80%, whereas combination of both PRDX6 and ANXA11 antibodies increased sensitivity to 90% for tumors and 100% for healthy controls. Therefore, we hereby report that the detection of these antibodies in PCa patient's serum in combination with the existing non-invasive diagnostic procedures may have significance in PCa diagnosis.  Biological significance:   The present study aimed to investigate serum autoantibody signatures as new biomarkers for early diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). To investigate serum autoantibodies in patients with PCa, we used proteomics approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry. Total tissue proteins extracted from prostate were separated by 2-DE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, which were subsequently incubated with either pooled serum from PCa patients or from normal controls with no history for PCa. Proteomic analysis results have identified 18 antigens that showed antibody response specifically to cancer patient's serum. For validation experiments using recombinant antigens, confirmed autoantibody response to three antigens PRDX2, PRDX6 and ANXA11. Further validation using a second independent set of PCa patient's sera has shown relatively increased abundance of PRDX6 and ANXA11 antibodies specifically in PCa patients. Partition analysis of patients based on abundance of autoantibodies highlighted a combination of both PRDX6 and ANXA11 antibodies in serum with 90% sensitivity in case of tumors and 100% in case of healthy controls. Therefore, we hereby report that the detection of these antibodies in PCa patient's serum in combination with known markers may have significance in diagnosis of PCa with further validation in larger cohort of samples.""","""['Ramesh Ummanni', 'Divya Duscharla', 'Christine Barett', 'Simone Venz', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Reinhard Walther', 'Carsten Bokemeyer', 'Tim H Brümmendorf', 'P V L N Murthy', 'Stefan Balabanov']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Proteomics""","""['Immunoseroproteomic Profiling in African American Men with Prostate Cancer: Evidence for an Autoantibody Response to Glycolysis and Plasminogen-Associated Proteins.', 'Novel potential serological prostate cancer biomarkers using CT100+ cancer antigen microarray platform in a multi-cultural South African cohort.', 'Preferential autoimmune response in prostate cancer to cyclin B1 in a panel of tumor-associated antigens.', 'A systematic review of serum autoantibodies as biomarkers for pancreatic cancer detection.', 'Blood autoantibodies against tumor-associated antigens as biomarkers in early detection of colorectal cancer.', 'Oncogenic Proteomics Approaches for Translational Research and HIV-Associated Malignancy Mechanisms.', 'Identification of novel serum autoantibody biomarkers for early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia detection.', 'Prostate cancer autoantibodies - applications in diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease progression and immunotherapy.', 'Antioxidant Gene Signature Impacts the Immune Infiltration and Predicts the Prognosis of Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma.', 'The autoimmune signature of hyperinflammatory multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.']"""

As protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have been reported to be associated with QOL in people with cancer, we sought to identify whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these genes were associated with QOL in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Multiple linear regression of two data sets (including approximately 750 men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and 550 men from the general population) was used to investigate SNPs of VEGF and IGF-1 (10 SNPs in total) for associations with QOL (measured by the SF-36v2 health survey).  Results:   Men with prostate cancer who carried the minor 'T' allele for IGF-1 SNP rs35767 had higher mean Role-Physical scale scores (≥0.3 SD) compared to non-carriers (p < 0.05). While this association was not identified in men from the general population, one IGF-1 SNP rs7965399 was associated with higher mean Bodily Pain scale scores in men from the general population that was not found in men with prostate cancer. Men from the general population who carried the rare 'C' allele had higher mean Bodily Pain scale scores (≥0.3 SD) than non-carriers (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Through identifying SNPs that are associated with QOL in men with prostate cancer and men from the general population, this study adds to the mapping of complex interrelationships that influence QOL and suggests a role for IGF-I in physical QOL outcomes. Future research may identify biomarkers associated with increased risk of poor QOL that could assist in the provision of pre-emptive support for those identified at risk.""","""['Kimberly E Alexander', 'Suzanne Chambers', 'Amanda B Spurdle', 'Jyotsna Batra', 'Felicity Lose', ""Tracy A O'Mara"", 'Robert A Gardiner', 'Joanne F Aitken', 'Judith A Clements', 'Mary-Anne Kedda', 'Monika Janda']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Evidence of associations between cytokine gene polymorphisms and quality of life in patients with cancer and their family caregivers.', 'Quality of life of men treated with brachytherapies for prostate cancer.', 'Associations Between Gene Polymorphisms of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Prostate Cancer.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in prostate cancer: its implications in diagnostics and therapeutics.', 'A Re-evaluation of Candidate Gene Studies for Well-Being in Light of Genome-Wide Evidence.', 'Genetic Variations and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL): A Genome-Wide Study Approach.', 'Do psychological harms result from being labelled with an unexpected diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm or prostate cancer through screening?

Yet, in patients with multiple biopsy cores positive for cancer (PCa), there is no standardized approach for interrogation of these biomarkers in terms of the number of positive cores to evaluate. A total of 194 NBX cases containing more than one positive core with cancer were evaluated for ERG overexpression and PTEN loss by immunostaining (immunohistochemistry) of all positive cores. ERG overexpression or PTEN loss in at least one cancer core was present in 111 (57%) and 69 (36%) cases respectively. ERG overexpression was significantly associated with PTEN loss (P < .0001), and PTEN loss was associated with a high Gleason score (P < .0001). Inter- and intra-tumor core staining heterogeneity for ERG overexpression occurred in 42% and 5% cases and for PTEN loss both intra- and inter-tumor core heterogeneity was 68%. PTEN staining was highly discordant between PCa sites regardless of laterality. When the Gleason score was non-uniform across PCa sites, the combination of cores showing the highest Gleason score and largest tumor volume provided the best representation of ERG overexpression (92%) and PTEN loss (98%). When grades were uniform across cancer sites, the highest tumor volume core was generally representative of ERG overexpression (90%) but was less representative for PTEN loss (76%).

The current prevalent diagnosis method, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test, has low sensitivity, specificity and is poor at predicting the grade of disease. Thus, new biomarkers are urgently needed to improve the PCa diagnosis and staging for the management of patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the first voided urinary sample after massage for biomarker discovery for PCa. In this work, untargeted metabolomic profiling of the first voided urinary sample after massage from 28 confirmed prostate cancer patients, 20 benign enlarged prostate patients and 6 healthy volunteers was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Single and multiple peptide protein and cross-linking molecules were identified using PEAKS software. Analytical and diagnostic performance was tested using the Student's t test, Benjamini Hochberg correction and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Using differential display analysis to compare peptides and cross-linking molecules of urinary samples between patients with benign, enlarged prostate and malignant cancer, we identified multiple peptides derived from osteopontin (SPP1) and prothrombin (F2) that are lower in PCa patients than in benign and enlarged prostate. The diagnosis accuracies of SPP1 and F2 peptides are 0.65-0.77 and 0.68-0.72, respectively. In addition to this, there are significant differences between PCa and benign/enlarged prostate patients in pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) (p value = 0.001). Differences also, as shown in the excretion of these molecules for different stages of PCa (p value = 0.04) as the level of DPD and DPD/PYD ratio, were high in patients with locally advanced tumours.

We investigated the risk of ischemic stroke after androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer in the Chinese population.  Methods:   All Chinese prostate cancer patients who were treated primarily with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, with (androgen deprivation therapy group) or without (non-androgen deprivation therapy group) further androgen deprivation therapy, at our hospital from year 2000-09 were reviewed. Potential risk factors of ischemic stroke including age, baseline prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, clinical T stage, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease, history of stroke, use of androgen deprivation therapy and duration of androgen deprivation therapy were reviewed. The risk of ischemic stroke after androgen deprivation therapy was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses.  Results:   A total of 452 patients were included, consisting of 200 patients in the non-androgen deprivation therapy group and 252 patients in the androgen deprivation therapy group. The androgen deprivation therapy group appeared to have increased risk of ischemic stroke when compared with the non-androgen deprivation therapy group (P = 0.063) upon Kaplan-Meier analysis. Upon multivariate Cox regression analyses, older age (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.22, P = 0.003), hyperlipidemia (hazard ratio 4.61, 95% confidence interval 2.01-10.54, P < 0.001) and the use of androgen deprivation therapy (hazard ratio 3.32, 95% confidence interval 1.14-9.67, P = 0.028) were associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke.

Although the relationship between NT and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity in gastric cancer has not been reported, the elevation of MMP-9 and NT is reported in the breast, lung, prostate, and gastric cancer. The aim of our study is to investigate the relationship between NT and MMP-9 activity and the underlying signaling mechanism in gastric cancer cell lines. Commercial ELISA kits were used for estimation of NT and MMP-9 expression, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay was used for measurement of MMP-9 activity. Cell migration and invasion were determined by wound healing and transwell assay. The expression of signaling proteins was measured by Western blotting. Our study reveals a positive correlation between increased plasma NT and MMP-9 activity in both of patient's serum and gastric cancer cell lines. A dose-dependent elevation of MMP-9 activity was observed by NT treatment in gastric cancer cells (MKN-1 and MKN-45) compared to untreated gastric cancer and normal epithelial cell (HFE-145). Moreover, NT-mediated migration and invasion were observed in gastric cancer cells unlike in normal cell. The signaling mechanism of NT in gastric cancer cells was confirmed in protein kinase C (PKC), extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway.

Smad proteins function as important mediators of intracellular signal transduction of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). TGF-β signaling pathway is known to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and play a major role in some human diseases and cancers. Following their phosphorylation by TGF-β receptor-I, Receptor-regulated Smads (including Smad2 and Smad3 proteins) form a heteromeric complex with co-Smad (Smad4) and then translocate into the nucleus where they bind and regulate the expression of target genes. ERG (Ets Related Gene) belongs to the ETS family of transcriptional factors. Chromosomal rearrangement of TMPRSS2 gene and ERG gene has been found in majority of prostate cancers. Over-expression of full length or truncated ERG proteins have been shown to associate with a higher rate of recurrent and unfavorable prognosis of prostate cancer. In order to understand how ERG oncoprotein regulates TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway, we have studied the effect of ERG on TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that ERG oncoprotein physically interacts with Smad3 protein and stabilizes phospho-Smad3 protein and thereby enhance TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway in prostate cells.

Accordingly, PCGEM1 and PRNCR1 were implicated in progression of prostate cancer (PCa) as transcriptional co-regulators of the androgen receptor (AR). However, these findings were recently refuted asserting that neither gene physically binds to the AR. Despite evidence for differing AR transcriptional programs in vivo and in vitro, studies investigating AR-regulation of these genes hitherto have only been conducted in vitro. Here, we further examine the relevance of PCGEM1 and PRNCR1 in PCa, and their relationship with AR signaling, using patient-derived xenograft models.  Findings:   RNA sequencing of two distinct androgen-dependent models shows PCGEM1 to be considerably expressed, while PRNCR1 showed scant basal expression. PCGEM1 was sharply down-regulated following castration and up-regulated upon AR activation in vivo. However, we found no parallel evidence following AR stimulation in vitro. A PCGEM1-associated gene expression signature (PES) was significantly repressed in response to androgen ablation therapy and in hormone-refractory versus hormone-naïve PCa patients. Furthermore, we found PCGEM1 was uniformly distributed in PCa cell nucleus and cytoplasm which remained unaltered upon AR transcriptional activation. PCGEM1 was up-regulated in primary PCa but not in metastasized PCa. Accordingly, the PES was significantly down-regulated in advanced and higher grade PCa patients from multiple independent studies.

Methods:   We used 2008-2010 Beneficiary Annual Summary Files from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to compare prevalences of 17 conditions among 781 LLFS participants in Medicare with those of 3,227 non-LLFS matches from the general Medicare population. Analyses accounted for nesting within LLFS families.  Results:   Seven conditions were significantly less common among LLFS probands than their matches: Alzheimer's, hip fracture, diabetes, depression, prostate cancer, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Four diseases not strongly linked to mortality (arthritis, cataract, osteoporosis, glaucoma) were significantly more common for LLFS probands. Despite fewer people and less disease in those roles, LLFS offspring and LLFS spouses of either generation also had significantly lower risk for Alzheimer's, diabetes, and heart failure.  Conclusions:   Common, severe mortality-associated diseases are less prevalent among LLFS probands and their offspring than in the general population of aging Americans. Quality-of-life-limiting diseases such as arthritis and cataract are more prevalent, potentially through more diagnosing of milder forms in otherwise healthy and active individuals. LLFS spouses are also relatively healthy.

Environmentally relevant dietary exposure to Cd has recently been associated with osteoporosis and cancers of the prostate, endometrium, and breast in the general population. The low exposure effects have been proposed to result from endocrine modulative properties of Cd, which mimic the physiological actions of estrogen and androgen. However, the mechanism of action of Cd is an unanswered question. We have shown previously, using mouse models, that canonical estrogen receptor signaling is not involved in estrogen mimicry effects of Cd. Instead, low-level Cd exposure stimulated the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1/2 in these mice. Here we investigate further the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling activation by Cd in vitro by using nanomolar concentrations of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) in three different human carcinoma cell lines: HepG2, MCF-7, and ECC-1. The findings also were confirmed in previously collected mouse tissue samples. We show that 10(-8)M levels of CdCl2 activate ERK1/2 (Tyr 204) and the p53 specific ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 (Ser 166) via Raf and MEK by acting through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

We investigated the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent with anti-angiogenic properties, in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned chemotherapy-naive patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a 1:1 ratio to receive docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) on day 1 and prednisone (5 mg twice daily) on days 1-21 and either lenalidomide (25 mg) or placebo once daily on days 1-14 of each 21 day treatment cycle. Permuted block randomisation was done with an interactive voice response system and stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, geographic region, and type of disease progression. Clinicians, patients, and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat. Patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00988208.  Findings:   1059 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned between Nov 11, 2009, and Nov 23, 2011 (533 to the lenalidomide group and 526 to the control group), and 1046 patients received study treatment (525 in the lenalidomide group and 521 in the placebo group). At data cutoff (Jan 13, 2012) after a median follow-up of 8 months (IQR 5-12), 221 patients had died: 129 in the lenalidomide group and 92 in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 17·7 months (95% CI 14·8-18·8) in the lenalidomide group and not reached in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·53, 95% CI 1·17-2·00, p=0·0017). The trial was subsequently closed early due to futility. The number of deaths that occurred during treatment or less than 28 days since the last dose were similar in both groups (18 [3%] of 525 patients in the lenalidomide group vs 13 [2%] of 521 patients). 109 (21%) patients in the lenalidomide group and 78 (15%) in the placebo group died more than 28 days from last dose, mainly due to disease progression. At least one grade 3 or higher adverse event was reported in 381 (73%) of 525 patients receiving lenalidomide and 303 (58%) of 521 patients receiving placebo. Grade 3-4 neutropenia (114 [22%] for lenalidomide vs 85 [16%] for placebo), febrile neutropenia (62 [12%] vs 23 [4%]), diarrhoea (37 [7%] vs 12 [2%]), pneumonia (24 [5%] vs five [1%]), dyspnoea (22 [4%] vs nine [2%]), asthenia (27 [5%] vs 17 [3%]), and pulmonary embolism (32 [6%] vs seven [1%]) occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide group than in the placebo group.  Interpretation:   Overall survival with the combination of lenalidomide, docetaxel, and prednisone was significantly worse than with docetaxel and prednisone for chemotherapy-naive men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.

For prevention and control of disease, knowledge of population statistics of cancers and their trends is essential. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and trends of cancer in the province of Kerman: southeast of Iran.  Materials and methods:   This analytical and cross-sectional study was carried out based on cancer registry data at the Disease Management Center of the Health Ministry from 2004 to 2009 in the province of Kerman in Iran. Common cancers were defined as the number of reported cases and standardized incidence rates. To compute the annual percentage change (APC), joinpoint 4.1.1.1 software was applied.  Results:   Of 10,595 registered cases, 45.3% (4802 cases) were in women and 56.7% (5,793 cases) occurred in men. The standardized incidence rates for both females and males were increasing during the six years studied. The most common cancers in both sexes during six years of studied were skin (13.4%), breast (9.35%), bladder (7.8%), stomach (7.45%), leukemia (7.05%), colorectal(5.57%), lung(4.92%), trachea(3.51%) and prostate(2.48%).  Conclusions:   Our findings revealed that the cancer incidence is demonstrating increasing trends in both sexes in the province of Kerman. This may be because of changes in lifestyle, increasing exposure to risk factors for cancer and increase of life expectancy. If this is the case, increasing public awareness of cancer risk factors is a high priority, together with introduction of large-scale screening techniques.""","""['Naeimeh Keyghobadi', 'Hosein Rafiemanesh', 'Abdollah Mohammadian-Hafshejani', 'Mostafa Enayatrad', 'Hamid Salehiniya']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Incidence, Trends and Epidemiology of Cancers in North West of Iran.', 'Cancer Incidence in Kerman Province, Southeast of Iran: Report of an ongoing Population-Based Cancer Registry, 2014.', 'Incidence Trend and Epidemiology of Common Cancers in the Center of Iran.', 'Cancer epidemiology in the elderly.', 'Rapid changes in the incidence of urinary system cancers in Turkey.', 'National and subnational burden of female and male breast cancer and risk factors in Iran from 1990 to 2019: results from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019.', 'Incidence Pattern and Geographical Distribution of Breast Cancer among Females Using Geographic Information System in Kermanshah Province, West Iran: First Data from A Population-Based Cancer Registry in Kermanshah.', 'The Occurrence of Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (ALCAM) and Its Predictive Factors in Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Targeting the MALAT1 gene with the CRISPR/Cas9 technique in prostate cancer.', 'Epidemiological Study of Lung Cancer in Iran: A Systematic Review.']"""

Abnormal epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and histone modification play an important role in tumor initiation, progression and regulation of cancer-related genes such as integrin α4 and E-cadherin. Expression of these genes was determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR in prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3, before and after treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A. Laser capture microdissection microscopy was used to obtain exclusively affected epithelial cells from prostate gland biopsies of 30 patients with prostate cancer and 40 with benign prostate hyperplasia. DNA bisulfite modifications followed by methylation-specific PCR were used to evaluate the promoter methylation status of E-cadherin and α4 integrin genes in extracted DNA from patients and aforementioned cell lines. The integrin α4 promoter in DU145 was fully methylated, whereas in PC3 cells, partial methylation was detected. E-cadherin was expressed in both cell lines; trichostatin A and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment had no effect on E-cadherin expression, however the combined treatment of both drugs or 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine alone increased integrin α4 expression. Integrin α4 and E-cadherin were hypermethylated in 66.6 % and 6.6 % of prostate cancer cases, respectively; no hypermethylation was observed in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. These results together suggest that aberrant DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms involved in integrin α4 expression and may play an important role in human prostate carcinogenesis. In addition, the higher rate of integrin α4 gene methylation in prostate cancer patients elects it as a potential molecular tumor marker.""","""['Z Mostafavi-Pour', 'S Kianpour', 'M Dehghani', 'P Mokarram', 'S Torabinejad', 'A Monabati']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pathol Oncol Res""","""['Aberrant methylation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 gene in prostate cancer.', ""Demethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in colorectal cancer cells targets genomic DNA whilst promoter CpG island methylation persists."", 'Methylation mediated silencing of TMS1/ASC gene in prostate cancer.', 'The importance of DNA methylation in prostate cancer development.', 'Epigenetic modifications in prostate cancer.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'Methylation as a critical epigenetic process during tumor progressions among Iranian population: an overview.', 'Abnormal promoter DNA hypermethylation of the integrin, nidogen, and dystroglycan genes in breast cancer.', 'E-Cadherin Downregulation is Mediated by Promoter Methylation in Canine Prostate Cancer.', 'Importance of Cadherins Methylation in Ovarian Cancer: a Next Generation Sequencing Approach.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective analysis was conducted of US Oncology Network iKnowMed (iKM) electronic health record (EHR) data to assess patients with mCRPC who received treatment with D and were subsequently treated with C or A, or both, between April 2011 and May 2012. Patients received 2 or 3 drugs: DA, DC, DAC, or DCA. Overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method from the start to the end of second-line therapy after administration of D (TTF1) and to the end of combined second- and third-line therapy (TTF2) for 3-drug sequences.

More than 9,000 cancer patients have been treated at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS). Carbon-ion radiotherapy has been applied for treating various types of tumors that were considered difficult to control with existing modalities. Our experience to date has indicated that carbon-ion radiotherapy is advantageous for head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcomas of the pelvis, uterine cervix adenocarcinomas, and other cancers. However, some cancer types (such as those in close proximity to radiosensitive normal organs) require additional treatments to sensitize the target cancer because of limitation of the irradiation dose. Furthermore, systemic combined therapy is also utilized to suppress possible metastasis. Currently, some anticancer agents are utilized with carbon-ion radiotherapy, including dacarbazine, nimustine hydrochloride, vincristine (DAV), gemcitabine, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. Interesting reagents such as PARP and HSP90 inhibitors have been proposed as cancer cell- specific sensitizers for carbon-ion irradiation during basic biological studies, especially those from the Research Project with Heavy Ions at NIRS-HIMAC. In our laboratory, we have focused our studies on the suppression of metastasis. We have proposed the concurrent use of reagents to inhibit the invasive potential of cancer cells under carbon-ion irradiation.

However, its exact mechanisms of action, particularly the functions and the mechanisms of Ligustrazine in human hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), have not yet been extensively studied. Recently, our findings suggest that Ligustrazine dose- and time-dependently inhibits the growth of HRPC cells by reducing their proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Interestingly, the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer (PC-3) cells with Ligustrazine results in a significant inhibition of the activation of mTOR and related downstream targets, which are critical for cell growth. Furthermore, pull-down assays with 7-methyl- GTP Sepharose 4B beads indicate that Ligustrazine reduces the available eIF4E for translation initiation. Accordingly, the results from the translation assay using a luciferase reporter system further demonstrate that Ligustrazine indeed inhibits cap-dependent translation. In addition, the transient overexpression of eIF4E or MNK1 prevents the Ligustrazine-induced inhibition of proliferation and confers significant protection against Ligustrazine-induced apoptosis. Therefore, the present study provides evidences that Ligustrazine may be a candidate for therapeutic reagent for the treatment of HRPC and certifies that Ligustrazine modulates the availability of eIF4E mainly through the mTOR and MEK/ERK signaling pathways to inhibit cap-dependent translation. Taken together, our results indicate that the inhibition of cap-dependent translation is likely an essential mechanism in Ligustrazine-induced apoptosis.""","""['Jiaoyan Han', 'Jiao Song', 'Xiangyun Li', 'Ming Zhu', 'Wei Guo', 'Wei Xing', 'Rongshen Zhao', 'Xiao He', 'Xiaoping Liu', 'Shali Wang', 'Yunyun Li', 'Hong Huang', 'Xiang Xu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['eIF4E Phosphorylation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Ribavirin Inhibits the Activity of mTOR/eIF4E, ERK/Mnk1/eIF4E Signaling Pathway and Synergizes with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Imatinib to Impair Bcr-Abl Mediated Proliferation and Apoptosis in Ph+ Leukemia.', 'Phenethyl isothiocyanate, a cancer chemopreventive constituent of cruciferous vegetables, inhibits cap-dependent translation by regulating the level and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1.', 'The androgen receptor is a negative regulator of eIF4E phosphorylation at S209: implications for the use of mTOR inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer.', 'eIF4E activity is regulated at multiple levels.', 'Ligustrazine inhibits the viability and motility of colon cancer cells.', 'Tetramethylpyrazine: A Review of Its Antitumor Potential and Mechanisms.', 'Tetramethylpyrazine inhibits proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro.', 'The Tetramethylpyrazine Derivative Statmp-151: A Novel Small Molecule Stat3 Inhibitor With Promising Activity Against Breast Cancer.', 'eIF4E Phosphorylation in Prostate Cancer.']"""

We investigated how treatment trends in this demographic have changed.  Patient and methods:   Non-metastatic cancers diagnosed from 2000-2010 in the UK Anglian Cancer network stratified by age and risk group were analysed [n = 10,365]. Radiotherapy [RT] and prostatectomy [RP] cancer specific survival [CSS] were further compared [n = 4755].  Results:   Over the decade we observed a fall in uptake of primary androgen deprivation therapy but a rise in conservative management [CM] and radical therapy [p<0.0001]. CM in particular has become the primary management for low-risk disease by the decade end [p<0.0001]. In high-risk disease however both RP and RT uptake increased significantly but in an age dependent manner [p<0.0001]. Principally, increased RP in younger men and increased RT in men ≥ 70y. In multivariate analysis of radically treated men both high-risk disease [HR 8.0 [2.9-22.2], p<0.0001] and use of RT [HR 1.9 [1.0-3.3], p = 0.024] were significant predictors of a poorer CSM. In age-stratified analysis however, the trend to benefit of RP over RT was seen only in younger men [≤ 60 years] with high-risk disease [p = 0.07]. The numbers needed to treat by RP instead of RT to save one cancer death was 19 for this group but 67 for the overall cohort.  Conclusion:   This study has identified significant shifts in non-metastatic prostate cancer management over the last decade. Low-risk disease is now primarily managed by CM while high-risk disease is increasingly treated radically.

Variability in response may arise due to differences in the initial genetic lesions leading to cancer development. Alternatively, susceptibility to viral oncolysis may change during cancer progression. These hypotheses were tested using cells from a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Primary cultures from murine cancers derived from prostate-specific Pten deletion contained a mixture of cells that were susceptible and resistant to VSV. Castration-resistant cancers contained a higher percentage of susceptible cells than cancers from noncastrated mice. These results indicate both susceptible and resistant cells can evolve within the same tumor. The role of Pten deletion was further investigated using clonal populations of murine prostate epithelial (MPE) progenitor cells and tumor-derived Pten(-/-) cells. Deletion of Pten in MPE progenitor cells using a lentivirus vector resulted in cells that responded poorly to interferon and were susceptible to VSV infection. In contrast, tumor-derived Pten(-/-) cells expressed higher levels of the antiviral transcription factor STAT1, activated STAT1 in response to VSV, and were resistant to VSV infection. These results suggest that early in tumor development following Pten deletion, cells are primarily sensitive to VSV, but subsequent evolution in tumors leads to development of cells that are resistant to VSV infection. Further evolution in castration-resistant tumors leads to tumors in which cells are primarily sensitive to VSV.  Importance:   There has been a great deal of progress in the development of replication-competent viruses that kill cancer cells (oncolytic viruses). However, a major problem is that individual cancers vary in their sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, even when these cancers arise from the same tissue type. The experiments presented here were to determine whether both sensitive and resistant cells are present in prostate cancers originating from a single genetic lesion in transgenic mice, prostate-specific deletion of the gene for the tumor suppressor Pten. The results indicate that murine prostate cancers are composed of both cells that are sensitive and cells that are resistant to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Furthermore, androgen deprivation led to castration-resistant prostate cancers that were composed primarily of cells that were sensitive to VSV. These results are encouraging for the use of VSV for the treatment of prostate cancers that are resistant to androgen deprivation therapy.""","""['Nanmeng Yu', 'Shelby Puckett', 'Peter A Antinozzi', 'Scott D Cramer', 'Douglas S Lyles']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['Oncolysis of prostate cancers induced by vesicular stomatitis virus in PTEN knockout mice.', 'Curcumin promotes the oncoltyic capacity of vesicular stomatitis virus for the treatment of prostate cancers.', 'Interferon Beta and Interferon Alpha 2a Differentially Protect Head and Neck Cancer Cells from Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-Induced Oncolysis.', 'Vesicular stomatitis virus as a flexible platform for oncolytic virotherapy against cancer.', 'Vesicular stomatitis virus in the fight against cancer.', 'NEBL and AKT1 maybe new targets to eliminate the colorectal cancer cells resistance to oncolytic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus M-protein.', 'Diversity in responses to oncolytic Lassa-vesicular stomatitis virus in patient-derived glioblastoma cells.', 'PTEN Lipid Phosphatase Activity Enhances Dengue Virus Production through Akt/FoxO1/Maf1 Signaling.', 'MAP3K7 and CHD1 Are Novel Mediators of Resistance to Oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Virus in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Enhance Cell Killing and Block Interferon-Beta Synthesis Elicited by Infection with an Oncolytic Parainfluenza Virus.']"""

In particular, the genetic engraftment of chimeric Ag receptors (CARs) in NK cells is a promising strategy to redirect NK cells to otherwise NK cell-resistant tumor cells. On the basis of DNAX-activation protein 12 (DAP12), a signaling adaptor molecule involved in signal transduction of activating NK cell receptors, we generated a new type of CAR targeting the prostate stem cell Ag (PSCA). We demonstrate in this article that this CAR, designated anti-PSCA-DAP12, consisting of DAP12 fused to the anti-PSCA single-chain Ab fragment scFv(AM1) confers improved cytotoxicity to the NK cell line YTS against PSCA-positive tumor cells when compared with a CAR containing the CD3ζ signaling chain. Further analyses revealed phosphorylation of the DAP12-associated ZAP-70 kinase and IFN-γ release of CAR-engineered cells after contact with PSCA-positive target cells. YTS cells modified with DAP12 alone or with a CAR bearing a phosphorylation-defective ITAM were not activated. Notably, infused YTS cells armed with anti-PSCA-DAP12 caused delayed tumor xenograft growth and resulted in complete tumor eradication in a significant fraction of treated mice. The feasibility of the DAP12-based CAR was further tested in human primary NK cells and confers specific cytotoxicity against KIR/HLA-matched PSCA-positive tumor cells, which was further enhanced by KIR-HLA mismatches. We conclude that NK cells engineered with DAP12-based CARs are a promising tool for adoptive tumor immunotherapy.""","""['Katrin Töpfer', 'Marc Cartellieri', 'Susanne Michen', 'Ralf Wiedemuth', 'Nadja Müller', 'Dirk Lindemann', 'Michael Bachmann', 'Monika Füssel', 'Gabriele Schackert', 'Achim Temme']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Immunol""","""['Engineering NK Cells Modified With an EGFRvIII-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor to Overexpress CXCR4 Improves Immunotherapy of CXCL12/SDF-1α-secreting Glioblastoma.', 'Dual antigen target-based immunotherapy for prostate cancer eliminates the growth of established tumors in mice.', 'Purinergic targeting enhances immunotherapy of CD73+ solid tumors with piggyBac-engineered chimeric antigen receptor natural killer cells.', 'Reformation in chimeric antigen receptor based cancer immunotherapy: Redirecting natural killer cell.', 'Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-transduced natural killer cells in tumor immunotherapy.', 'Chimeric antigen receptor engineered natural killer cells for cancer therapy.', 'Understanding NK cell biology for harnessing NK cell therapies: targeting cancer and beyond.', 'Fine-Tuning through Generations: Advances in Structure and Production of CAR-T Therapy.', 'The application of autologous cancer immunotherapies in the age of memory-NK cells.', 'Facing challenges with hope: universal immune cells for hematologic malignancies.']"""

Setting:   The Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VA GLA) PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: We developed a highly specific computerized clinical decision support (CCDS) alert to remind providers, at the moment of PSA screening order entry, of the current guidelines and institutional policy. We implemented the tool in a prospective interrupted time series study design over 15 months, and compared the trends in monthly PSA screening rate at baseline to the CCDS on and off periods of the intervention.  Results:   A total of 30,150 men were at risk, or eligible, for screening, and 2,001 men were screened. The mean monthly screening rate during the 15-month baseline period was 8.3%, and during the 15-month intervention period, was 4.6%. The screening rate declined by 38% during the baseline period and by 40% and 30%, respectively, during the two periods when the CCDS tool was turned on. The screening rate ratios for the baseline and two periods when the CCDS tool was on were 0.97, 0.78, and 0.90, respectively, with a significant difference between baseline and the first CCDS-on period (p < 0.0001), and a trend toward a difference between baseline and the second CCDS-on period (p = 0.056).

We observed that androgen removal in HRPCa-derived LNCaP cells causes different alterations in their Ca(2+) homeostasis among which a reduction of ER Ca(2+) content. We show that the decrease in [Ca(2+)]ER is due to a modest overexpression of type 1 IP3R and a threefold increased phosphorylation of IP3R1 on Ser-1716, a protein kinase A (PKA) consensus site, both implicated in ER Ca(2+) leak. Accordingly, ER Ca(2+) content was restored by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of IP3R1 or by inhibition of its phosphorylation by competition with a permeant TAT-peptide containing the Ser-1716 consensus phosphorylation sequence or by treatment with the PKA inhibitor H89. Moreover, inhibition of the IP3R1 phosphorylation by both methods sensitized the LNCaP cells to androgen deprivation-induced apoptosis. In addition, SERCA2b overexpression precluded the effect of androgen deprivation on ER Ca(2+) store content and reduced resistance to androgen deprivation. Taken together, these results indicate that lowering the ER Ca(2+)-store content by increasing IP3R1 levels and IP3R1 phosphorylation by PKA is a protective mechanism by which HRPCa-derived cells escape cell death in the absence of androgenic stimulation.""","""['Benoît Boutin', 'Nicolas Tajeddine', 'Giovanni Monaco', 'Jordi Molgo', 'Didier Vertommen', 'Mark Rider', 'Jan B Parys', 'Geert Bultynck', 'Philippe Gailly']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Calcium""","""['Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-isoform diversity in cell death and survival.', 'Acetylcholine attenuated TNF-α-induced intracellular Ca2+ overload by inhibiting the formation of the NCX1-TRPC3-IP3R1 complex in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.', 'Androgen deprivation and androgen receptor competition by bicalutamide induce autophagy of hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells and confer resistance to apoptosis.', 'Role of endoplasmic reticulum calcium content in prostate cancer cell growth regulation by IGF and TNFalpha.', 'The type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, emerging functions for an intriguing Ca²⁺-release channel.', 'The Cytoplasmic Region of SARAF Reduces Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Metastasis through the Regulation of Store-Operated Calcium Entry.', 'Platelet-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Stimulate Migration through Partial Remodelling of the Ca2+ Handling Machinery in MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Reticulocalbin3: A Ca2+ homeostasis regulator that promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression and cisplatin resistance.', 'The Regulatory Roles of Mitochondrial Calcium and the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter in Tumor Cells.', 'Targeting Protein Kinases and Epigenetic Control as Combinatorial Therapy Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

Despite the availability of active chemotherapy regimens and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, all advanced patients develop recurrent disease after first-line therapy. Although Hsp27 is a stress-induced chaperone that promotes acquired resistance in several cancers, its relationship to treatment resistance in NSCLC has not been defined. Understanding adaptive responses of acquired resistance will help guide new strategies to control NSCLC. Hsp27 levels were evaluated in an HCC827 erlotinib-resistant-derived cell line (HCC-827Resistant), and sensitivity to erlotinib was examined in Hsp27-overexpressing A549 cells. The role of Hsp27 in both erlotinib and cytotoxic treatment resistance was evaluated in HCC-827 and A549 NSCLC cells using the Hsp27 antisense drug OGX-427. The effect of OGX-427 in combination with erlotinib was also assessed in mice bearing A549 xenografts. Hsp27 is induced by erlotinib and protects NSCLC cells from treatment-induced apoptosis, whereas OGX-427 sensitizes NSCLC cells to erlotinib. Interestingly, increased resistance to erlotinib was observed when Hsp27 was increased either in HCC827 erlotinib-resistant or overexpressing A549 cells. Combining OGX-427 with erlotinib significantly enhanced antitumor effects in vitro and delayed A549 xenograft growth in vivo. OGX-427 also significantly enhanced the activity of cytotoxic drugs used for NSCLC. These data indicate that treatment-induced Hsp27 contributes to the development of resistance, and provides preclinical proof-of-principle that inhibition of stress adaptive pathways mediated by Hsp27 enhances the activity of erlotinib and chemotherapeutics.""","""['Barbara Lelj-Garolla', 'Masafumi Kumano', 'Eliana Beraldi', 'Lucia Nappi', 'Palma Rocchi', 'Diana N Ionescu', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Martin E Gleave']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Focal Adhesion Kinase Inhibitors in Combination with Erlotinib Demonstrate Enhanced Anti-Tumor Activity in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Gambogenic acid inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway in erlotinib-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer and suppresses patient-derived xenograft growth.', 'Suppression of heat shock protein 27 using OGX-427 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and potentiates heat shock protein 90 inhibitors to delay castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Erlotinib or gefitinib for the treatment of relapsed platinum pretreated non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer: a systematic review.', 'Mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles-1 (BUB1) regulates EGFR signaling by reducing EGFR internalization.', 'Inhibition of Heat Shock Factor 1 Signaling Decreases Hepatoblastoma Growth via Induction of Apoptosis.', 'Heat Shock Proteins 27, 70, and 110: Expression and Prognostic Significance in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Small Hsps as Therapeutic Targets of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Protein.', 'Recent Advances in Oligonucleotide Therapeutics in Oncology.']"""

Joint modeling has been increasingly used to characterize the relationship between a time to event and a biomarker kinetics, but numerical difficulties often limit this approach to linear models. Here, we evaluated by simulation the capability of a new feature of the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization algorithm in Monolix to estimate the parameters of a joint model where PSA kinetics was defined by a mechanistic nonlinear mixed-effect model. The design of the study and the parameter values were inspired from one arm of a clinical trial. Increasingly high levels of association between PSA and survival were considered, and results were compared with those found using two simplified alternatives to joint model, a two-stage and a joint sequential model. We found that joint model allowed for a precise estimation of all longitudinal and survival parameters. In particular, the effect of PSA kinetics on survival could be precisely estimated, regardless of the strength of the association. In contrast, both simplified approaches led to bias on longitudinal parameters, and two-stage model systematically underestimated the effect of PSA kinetics on survival. In summary, we showed that joint model can be used to characterize the relationship between a nonlinear kinetics and survival.

However, it has known limitations in terms of distortions and artefacts using standard acquisition techniques. This study evaluates two alternative methods that offer the promise of improved image quality and the potential for more reliable and consistent diffusion data.  Methods:   Three DWI techniques were investigated; single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI), EPI combined with reduced volume excitation (ZOOMit; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and read-out segmentation with navigator-echo correction (RESOLVE; Siemens Healthcare). Daily measurements of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value were made in a quality assurance phantom to assess the repeatability of each sequence. In order to evaluate the geometric integrity of these sequences, ten normal volunteers were scanned, and the prostate was contoured to compare its similarity with T2 weighted images.  Results:   Phantom ADC values were significantly higher using the standard EPI sequence than those of the other two sequences. Differences were also observed between sequences in terms of repeatability, with RESOLVE and EPI performing better than ZOOMit. Overall, the RESOLVE sequence provided the best agreement for the in vivo data with smaller differences in volume and higher contour similarity than T2 weighted imaging.  Conclusion:   Important differences have been observed between each of the three techniques investigated with RESOLVE performing the best overall. We have adopted this sequence for routine RT simulation of prostate patients at Liverpool Cancer Therapy Centre.

Experimental design:   Eligible patients had histologically proven advanced solid malignancies, with any number of prior therapies, Zubrod performance status 0-2, and adequate organ function. Patients received ADI-PEG 20 weekly intramuscular injection ranging from 4.5 to 36 mg/m(2) and up to 10 doses of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were safety, toxicity, and a recommended phase II dose. Circulating arginine levels were measured before each cycle. Tumor response was measured as a secondary endpoint every 6 weeks on study.  Results:   Eighteen patients received a total of 116 cycles of therapy through four dose levels of ADI-PEG 20. A single dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 urticarial rash) was observed at the 1st dose level, with no additional dose-limiting toxicities observed. Hematologic toxicities were common with 14 patients experiencing at least one grade 3 to 4 leukopenia. Fatigue was the most prevalent toxicity reported by 16 patients. Arginine was variably suppressed with 10 patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in baseline values. In 14 patients with evaluable disease, four partial responses (including 2 patients with PSA response) were documented, and 7 patients had stable disease.

Because cancer stage is influenced both by tumor biology and medical surveillance, the authors assessed cancer stage in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and solid organ transplant recipients, 2 immunosuppressed groups with differences in their health care use.  Methods:   The authors used data on all cases of 15 cancer types diagnosed during 1996 through 2010 in 2 studies that linked US cancer registries with HIV and transplant registries. Odds ratios (ORs) for advanced (vs local) disease were estimated comparing HIV and transplant populations with immunocompetent individuals in polytomous logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, registry, and year.  Results:   A total of 8411 of 4.5 million cancer cases occurred in HIV-infected individuals and 7322 of 6.4 million cancer cases occurred in transplant recipients. Compared with immunocompetent patients with cancer, those infected with HIV were more likely to be diagnosed with distant stage lung (OR, 1.13), female breast (OR, 1.99), and prostate (OR, 1.57) cancers, whereas transplant recipients had fewer distant stage lung (OR, 0.54), female breast (OR, 0.75), and prostate (OR, 0.72) cancers. Both immunosuppressed populations had a shift toward advanced stage melanoma (ORs of 1.97 for HIV-infected individuals and 1.82 for transplant recipients) and bladder cancer (ORs of 1.42 for HIV-infected individuals and 1.54 for transplant recipients).  Conclusions:   Bladder cancer and melanoma were more likely to be diagnosed at a nonlocal stage in both HIV-infected individuals and transplant recipients, suggesting a role for immunosuppression in their progression. In addition, we observed a shift for some common cancers toward later stages in HIV-infected individuals and toward earlier stages in transplant recipients, which is consistent with differential access to medical care or surveillance.""","""['Meredith S Shiels', 'Glenn Copeland', 'Marc T Goodman', 'Janna Harrell', 'Charles F Lynch', 'Karen Pawlish', 'Ruth M Pfeiffer', 'Eric A Engels']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Risk of oral tongue cancer among immunocompromised transplant recipients and human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals in the United States.', 'Anaplastic large cell lymphoma in human immunodeficiency virus-infected people and solid organ transplant recipients.', 'Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer in Nonwhite Organ Transplant Recipients.', 'Epidemiologic perspectives on immunosuppressed populations and the immunosurveillance and immunocontainment of cancer.', 'Incidence of cancers in people with HIV/AIDS compared with immunosuppressed transplant recipients: a meta-analysis.', 'Transplant Onconephrology: An Update.', 'Survival Disparities Between Patients with Breast Cancer With and Without HIV: A Research Framework.', 'Using temporal heatmaps to identify worthwhile articles on immune checkpoint blockade for melanoma (ICBM) in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan since 2000: A bibliometric analysis.', 'Patient-Reported Outcomes in Cancer Patients with HIV.', 'Human Variation in DNA Repair, Immune Function, and Cancer Risk.']"""

Cell proliferation and cell migration of the siECHS1 cells were characterized using Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell assays, respectively, the results of which showed that the constitutive knockdown of the ECSH1 gene in HCT-8 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, decreased levels of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β phosphorylation were observed in ECHS1-silenced HCT-8 cells compared with that of parental or pU6 empty vector-transfected cells.

Results:   (99m)Tc-MGNs (97.69% purity) showed good binding affinity to PC-3 cells, a specific recognition blocked by excess folic acid. Interestingly, MGN@DTX remained stable in human serum for 24 h, and exhibited higher mean cytotoxicity after NIR laser irradiation than free DTX. By day 28, tumor inhibition rates were higher in the MGN@DTX + NIR laser irradiation group compared with the DTX and MGNs + NIR laser irradiation groups.  Conclusions:   Loading chemotherapeutic drugs into MGNs can increase antitumor potency, reduce normal cell damage and decrease drug resistance, thus representing a promising approach for advanced prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Yanfang Shen', 'Zhiya Ma', 'Fei Chen', 'Qingjian Dong', 'Qiran Hu', 'Lingyu Bai', 'Jing Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Drug Target""","""['Self-assembled albumin nanoparticles for combination therapy in prostate cancer.', 'The tumor-targeting core-shell structured DTX-loaded PLGA@Au nanoparticles for chemo-photothermal therapy and X-ray imaging.', 'Tumor targetability and antitumor effect of docetaxel-loaded hydrophobically modified glycol chitosan nanoparticles.', 'Liposome-based co-delivery of siRNA and docetaxel for the synergistic treatment of lung cancer.', 'Graphene oxide-wrapped PEGylated liquid crystalline nanoparticles for effective chemo-photothermal therapy of metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Lipid-Nanoparticle-Mediated Delivery of Docetaxel Prodrug for Exploiting Full Potential of Gold Nanoparticles in the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Docetaxel-Mediated Uptake and Retention of Gold Nanoparticles in Tumor Cells and in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts.', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Conjugated Disulfide Cross-Linked Alginate Nanoparticles as a Docetaxel Carrier for Colon Cancer Therapy.', 'Single- versus Dual-Targeted Nanoparticles with Folic Acid and Biotin for Anticancer Drug Delivery.', 'Modulation of the Microtubule Network for Optimization of Nanoparticle Dynamics for the Advancement of Cancer Nanomedicine.']"""

Materials and methods:   The files of 28 patients were retrospectively evaluated. All patients had a histopatological confirmation of prostate cancer. PSMA PET/CT images were obtained at 5 and 60 min after injection from all patients.  Results:   Intense pathologic radiotracer uptake was observed in 23 patients (77%) at the site of primary tumour. Lymph node metastases were detected in 10 patients (36%) and bone metastases were detected in seven patients (25%). Bone scan (n=25) results revealed metastatic bone lesions in four patients, equivocal results in nine patients and normal results in 12 patients. PSMA PET/CT confirmed bone metastases in all four patients. Pathologic radiotracer uptake in PSMA PET/CT scans was observed only in one patient among those who had equivocal bone scans. PSMA PET/CT showed additional bone lesions in two patients who had a normal bone scan. When we compared early and late pelvic images we found no difference in the number of lesions detected. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) for primary tumour, lymph nodes and bone metastases was significantly higher in late images.  Conclusion:   PSMA PET/CT imaging seems to be a valuable imaging modality for evaluation of primary prostate cancer and it seems to have potential for the detection of lymph node and bone metastases.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between common genetic variations across the TERT gene region and prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness in a Chinese population. A total of 12 TERT tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped on the Sequenom Mass-ARRAY iPLEX® platform in a case-case study with 1,210 Chinese patients with PCa. Unconditional logistic regression was used to investigate the association of genotypes with PCa aggressiveness, Gleason grade and risk of developing early-onset PCa. It was observed that the C allele of the TERT intron 2 SNP (rs2736100) was significantly associated with reduced risk of PCa aggressiveness [odds ratio (OR)=0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-0.99; P=0.037]. This allele was also significantly correlated with a reduced risk of developing a tumor with a high Gleason score (>7; OR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.70-0.99; P=0.039).

Allelic deletions of PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, are common in prostate cancer in men. Monoallelic Pten deletion in mice causes low prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN). This study tested the effect of a hypercaloric diet on prostate cancer in Pten (+/-) mice.  Methods:   1-month old mice were fed a high-calorie diet deriving 45% calories from fat for 3 and 6 months before prostate was analyzed histologically and biochemically for mPIN progression. Because Pten (+/-) mice are protected against diet-induced insulin resistance, we tested the role of insulin on cell growth in RWPE-1 normal human prostatic epithelial cells with siRNA knockdown of PTEN.  Results:   In addition to activating PI3 kinase/Akt and Ras/MAPkinase pathways, high-calorie diet causes neoplastic progression, angiogenesis, inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. It also elevates the expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS), a lipogenic gene commonly elevated in progressive cancer. SiRNA-mediated downregulation of PTEN demonstrates increased cell growth and motility, and soft agar clonicity in addition to elevation in FAS in response to insulin in RWPE-1 normal human prostatic cells. Downregulating FAS in addition to PTEN, blunted the proliferative effect of insulin (and IL-6) in RWPE-1 cells.

Methods:   We recruited 75 night and 42 day workers, ages 22 to 64 years, in different working settings. Participants collected urine samples from all voids over 24 hours on a working day. Urinary concentrations of 16 sex steroid hormones and metabolites (estrogens, progestagens, and androgens) and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were measured in all samples. Mean levels and peak time of total and individual metabolite production were compared between night and day workers.  Results:   Night workers had higher levels of total progestagens [geometric mean ratio (GMR) 1.65; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.17-2.32] and androgens (GMR: 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03-2.00), compared with day workers, after adjusting for potential confounders. The increased sex hormone levels among night shift workers were not related to the observed suppression of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin.

We previously showed that LRRC59 interacted with CIP2A, which was required for CIP2A nuclear localization. Thus, we predicted that CIP2A and Sgol1 may also interact. Sgol1 is a nuclear protein that regulates chromosome segregation during cell division via protection of cohesin ring proteins. Here, we demonstrated that Sgol1 and the C-terminus of CIP2A interact in prostate carcinoma cell lines in a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrated that depletion of CIP2A in PC-3 cells decreases premature chromosome segregation, whereas overexpression of CIP2A in an immortalized prostate cell line increases premature chromosome segregation. Importantly, we further showed that CIP2A depletion decreases the incidence of aneuploidy and stabilizes cohesin complex proteins, while overexpression of CIP2A destabilizes Sgol1. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that CIP2A promotes cell cycle progression, premature chromosome segregation, and aneuploidy, possibly through a novel interaction with Sgol1.""","""['Rajash Pallai', 'Aishwarya Bhaskar', 'Natalie Barnett-Bernodat', 'Christina Gallo-Ebert', 'Joseph T Nickels Jr', 'Lyndi M Rice']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 59 mediates nuclear import of cancerous inhibitor of PP2A in prostate cancer cells.', 'CIP2A mediates prostate cancer progression via the c-Myc signaling pathway.', 'CIP2A mediates prostate cancer progression via the c-MYC signaling pathway.', 'Oncogenic nexus of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A): an oncoprotein with many hands.', 'Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, an emerging human oncoprotein and a potential cancer therapy target.', 'From Basic Science to Clinical Practice: The Role of Cancerous Inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase 2A (CIP2A)/p90 in Cancer.', 'Fold-Change-Specific Enrichment Analysis (FSEA): Quantification of Transcriptional Response Magnitude for Functional Gene Groups.', 'CIP2A Constrains Th17 Differentiation by Modulating STAT3 Signaling.', 'Overexpression of shugoshin1 predicts a poor prognosis for prostate cancer and promotes metastasis by affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Protein-coding genes in B chromosomes of the grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans.']"""

Methods:   Between 2006 and 2012, 77 patients with diagnosed prostate cancer were treated with HDR brachytherapy as a monotherapy. The prescribed dose was 45 Gy in three separate implants 21 days apart, with single fraction per implant. Of the 77 patients, 67 (87%) received hormonal therapy. Prostate-specific antigen failure was defined according to Phoenix consensus, as nadir + 2 ng/mL. Toxicity was scored according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.  Results:   The median followup time was 57 months (4.75 years). The 5-year actuarial overall survival was 98.7%, biochemical control 96.7%, local control 96.9%, and metastasis-free survival 98.4%. Younger age at the beginning of brachytherapy predicted the onset of bounce phenomenon. There were no Grade 3 or higher acute toxicities detected, and Grade 2 genitourinary acute toxicity developed in 19 patients (24.6%). There were no Grade 2 gastrointestinal complications. No Grade 4 or 5 late toxicity was detected. There were also no Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicities detected. One patient (1.3%) underwent transurethral resection of the prostate because of Grade 3 urethral stenosis and urinary retention. A total of 26 patients (33.8%) developed Grade 2 late toxicity.

Acknowledgement of these downsides and endeavors to avoid them have led to substantial changes in treatment patterns. Many centers have reported dramatic changes, with increases in active surveillance (AS) of early cancers and local treatment of advanced disease. To estimate the impact of this development on our radical prostatectomy (RP) series, we analyzed changes in cancer and patient selection over the past 15 yr. Despite a trend toward decreased utilization of RP in Germany, the annual caseload at our institution increased due to regionalization, from 382 RPs in 2000 to 2145 in 2011, and has been stable for the past 3 yr (2106 RPs in 2014). The rate of RPs performed in patients with low-risk PCa, AS candidates, or men with a pure Gleason 6 pattern in the RP specimen dropped from 60%, 38.2%, and 56.2%, respectively, in 2004 to 27%, 14.7%, and 10%, respectively, in 2011-2013. Patients undergoing RP with solely Gleason 6 cancer were younger on average (aged 61 yr) than patients in higher risk groups (aged 65 yr). The rate of histologically insignificant PCa was low, ranging from 1% to 8.8% depending on the definition used. Patient selection is the other important tool used to avoid overtreatment. Long-term other-cause mortality (OCM) should be low in adequately selected RP candidates, and after a minimum follow-up of 15 yr, overall OCM was 14.8%. The OCM rate was 10.2% in men aged <65 yr and 24.3% in men aged ≥65 yr. The current analysis documents a clear shift in utilization of RP toward significant PCa in men with long life expectancy. Based on patient and cancer selection as described, the long-standing discussion of overtreatment with RP might become invalid.  Patient summary:   Discussion of possible overtreatment has led to dramatic changes in indication for radical prostatectomy (RP). We analyzed a large European patient cohort and found that RP is rarely done in early cancers but is used more for aggressive tumors. Those who underwent RP had long life expectancy and benefit from surgery. With this change in application, overtreatment with RP is unlikely.""","""['Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['A Decade of Active Surveillance in the PRIAS Study: An Update and Evaluation of the Criteria Used to Recommend a Switch to Active Treatment.', 'Utility of Risk Models in Decision Making After Radical Prostatectomy: Lessons from a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men.', 'Long-term Impact of Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in pT3N0 Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Multi-institutional Series.', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Changing nationwide trends away from overtreatment among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy over the past 25\xa0years.', 'The comparison of survival between active surveillance or watchful waiting and focal laser ablation in patients with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Trends in uro-oncological surgery in Germany-comparative analyses from population-based data.', 'Comparative Effectiveness of Radiotherapy versus Focal Laser Ablation in Patients with Low and Intermediate Risk Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Development and validation of a preoperative nomogram for predicting survival of patients with locally advanced prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Design:   Online survey. Women were presented with scenarios on breast and bowel cancer, men with scenarios on prostate and bowel cancer. For each particular cancer, we presented epidemiological information and described the treatment and its consequences. Secondly, we presented two different scenarios of benefit: one indicating a 10% reduction in cancer specific mortality and the second indicating a 50% reduction.  Setting:   Online survey of the population in the United Kingdom.  Participants:   Respondents were part of an existing panel of people who volunteer for online research and were invited by email or online marketing. We recruited 1000 respondents, representative for age and sex for the UK population.  Main outcome measures:   Number of cases of overdetection people were willing to accept, ranging from 0-1000 (complete screened population) for each cancer modality and each scenario of benefit.  Results:   There was large variability between respondents in the level of overdetection they would find acceptable, with medians ranging from 113 to 313 cases of overdetection per 1000 people screened. Across all scenarios, 4-7% of respondents indicated they would accept no overdetection at all compared with 7-14% who thought that it would be acceptable for the entire screened population to be overdetected. Acceptability in screening for bowel cancer was significantly lower than for breast and prostate cancer. People aged 50 or over accepted significantly less overdetection, whereas people with higher education levels accepted more; 29% of respondents had heard of overdetection before.

Method:   Topic areas for the VPs were taken from previous work exploring the needs of health care professionals working with men with prostate cancer. An initial scoping exercise involving nursing practitioners, students and a prostate cancer charity confirmed the focus of the case study scenarios. Service users and specialist practitioners reviewed an outline of each case study to ensure fidelity of the simulations scenarios. Cases were entered into UChoose, a web based interactive VP player and authoring tool. The final case studies were reviewed by a sample of both registered and non-registered nurses and nursing students.  Results:   The majority of respondents reported an increase in knowledge and suggested that they would recommend the resource to others. A number of positive aspects of the resource were highlighted.

Results of a multicentre retrospective study""","""Aim:   The management of rectal cancer threatening or affecting the prostatic plane is still under debate. The role of preoperative chemo radiotherapy and the extent of prostatectomy seem to be key points in the treatment of these tumours. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pathological circumferential margin status and the local recurrence rate following different therapeutic options.  Method:   A multicentre, retrospective study was conducted of patients with rectal cancer threatening or affecting the prostatic plane, but not the bladder, judged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of preoperative chemoradiotherapy and the type of urologic resection were correlated with the status of the pathological circumferential resection margin (CRM) and local recurrence.  Results:   A consecutive series of 126 men with rectal cancer threatening (44) or affecting (82) the prostatic plane on preoperative staging and operated with local curative intent between 1998 and 2010 was analysed. In patients who did not have chemoradiotherapy but had a preoperative threatened anterior margin the CRM-positive rate was 25.0%. In patients who did not have preoperative chemoradiotherapy but did have an affected margin, the CRM-positive rate was 41.7%. When preoperative radiotherapy was given, the respective CRM infiltration rates were 7.1 and 20.7%. In patients having preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by prostatic resection the rate of CRM positivity was 2.4%. Partial prostatectomy after preoperative chemoradiotherapy resulted in a free anterior CRM in all cases, but intra-operative urethral damage occurred in 36.4% of patients who underwent partial prostatectomy, resulting in a postoperative urinary fistula in 18.2% of patients.

DHT is necessary for prostatic growth and has five times higher binding affinity than testosterone for androgen receptors. We hypothesized that polymorphic variations in the SRD5A2 gene may affect the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.

At V89L locus, the presence of 'VV' showed a marginally significant correlation with increased BPH risk (p=0.047). At the (TA)n locus, longer TA repeats were found to be protective against BPH (p=0.003). However, neither of these polymoprhisms correlated with the risk of PCa.

We applied MiPC, which combines capture-based next generation sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), to 53 FFPE PCa specimens representing cases not well represented in frozen tissue cohorts, including 8 paired primary tumor and lymph node metastases. Results were validated using multiplexed PCR based NGS and Sanger sequencing.  Results:   We identified known and novel potential driving, somatic mutations and copy number alterations, including a novel BRAF T599_V600insHT mutation and CYP11B2 amplification in a patient treated with ketoconazole (a potent CYP11B2 inhibitor). qRT-PCR integration enabled comprehensive molecular subtyping and provided complementary information, such as androgen receptor (AR) target gene module assessment in advanced cases and SPINK1 over-expression. MiPC identified highly concordant profiles for all 8 tumor/lymph node metastasis pairs, consistent with limited heterogeneity amongst driving events. MiPC and exome sequencing were performed on separately isolated conventional acinar PCa and prostatic small cell carcinoma (SCC) components from the same FFPE resection specimen to enable direct comparison of histologically distinct components. While both components showed TMPRSS2:ERG fusions, the SCC component exclusively harbored complete TP53 inactivation (frameshift variant and copy loss) and two CREBBP mutations.

However, up to 40% of prostate cancer lesions appears isoechoic on TRUS. Hence, TRUS-guided biopsy has a high false negative rate for prostate cancer diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is better able to distinguish prostate cancer from benign tissue. However, MRI-guided biopsy requires special equipment and training and a longer procedure time. MRI-TRUS fusion, where MRI is acquired preoperatively and then aligned to TRUS, allows for advantages of both modalities to be leveraged during biopsy. MRI-TRUS-guided biopsy increases the yield of cancer positive biopsies. In this work, the authors present multiattribute probabilistic postate elastic registration (MAPPER) to align prostate MRI and TRUS imagery.  Methods:   MAPPER involves (1) segmenting the prostate on MRI, (2) calculating a multiattribute probabilistic map of prostate location on TRUS, and (3) maximizing overlap between the prostate segmentation on MRI and the multiattribute probabilistic map on TRUS, thereby driving registration of MRI onto TRUS. MAPPER represents a significant advancement over the current state-of-the-art as it requires no user interaction during the biopsy procedure by leveraging texture and spatial information to determine the prostate location on TRUS. Although MAPPER requires manual interaction to segment the prostate on MRI, this step is performed prior to biopsy and will not substantially increase biopsy procedure time.  Results:   MAPPER was evaluated on 13 patient studies from two independent datasets—Dataset 1 has 6 studies acquired with a side-firing TRUS probe and a 1.5 T pelvic phased-array coil MRI; Dataset 2 has 7 studies acquired with a volumetric end-firing TRUS probe and a 3.0 T endorectal coil MRI. MAPPER has a root-mean-square error (RMSE) for expert selected fiducials of 3.36 ± 1.10 mm for Dataset 1 and 3.14 ± 0.75 mm for Dataset 2. State-of-the-art MRI-TRUS fusion methods report RMSE of 3.06-2.07 mm.  Conclusions:   MAPPER aligns MRI and TRUS imagery without manual intervention ensuring efficient, reproducible registration. MAPPER has a similar RMSE to state-of-the-art methods that require manual intervention.""","""['Rachel Sparks', 'B Nicolas Bloch', 'Ernest Feleppa', 'Dean Barratt', 'Daniel Moses', 'Lee Ponsky', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Fully Automated Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion via a Probabilistic Registration Metric.', 'Elastic Versus Rigid Image Registration in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Prostate Biopsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.', 'Beyond transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: available techniques and approaches.', 'Direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy of the prostate: lessons learned in establishing a regional referral center.', 'Learning Non-rigid Deformations for Robust, Constrained Point-based Registration in Image-Guided MR-TRUS Prostate Intervention.', 'Radiomics based targeted radiotherapy planning (Rad-TRaP): a computational framework for prostate cancer treatment planning with MRI.', 'Interobserver Reproducibility of the PI-RADS Version 2 Lexicon: A Multicenter Study of Six Experienced Prostate Radiologists.']"""

The size of each individual study was not large enough to allow sufficient statistical power to draw conclusions. We conducted a pooled analysis of individual data of published studies to evaluate the association between increased CRP level and risk of death in prostate cancer, and to find the best CRP cutoff that could predict mortality.  Materials and methods:   Original research studies on prostate cancer survival and CRP levels were identified (n = 6). Corresponding authors were contacted and invited to share individual data. Two data sets were received (235 patients). The combined hazard ratio (HR) was calculated and adjusted for age, prostate-specific antigen, hemoglobin, and alkaline phosphatase. The best cutoff of CRP was explored using X-title software version 3.6.1.  Results:   High CRP level was statistically significantly associated with mortality (meta-HR, 1.83 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.51-2.21]), without evidence of heterogeneity among studies. At pooled analysis, adjusted pooled HR for CRP < 5 versus ≥ 5 mg/L was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.02-20.4). The best CRP cutoff was 12 mg/L: the adjusted HRpooled for CRP < 12 versus ≥ 12 mg/L was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.01-2.32).  Conclusion:   Increased CRP levels are associated with overall survival in prostate cancer patients. Because CRP is an affordable and readily available assay, it might hold promise in improving prognostication and potentially to predict the activity of specific therapeutic agents.""","""['Julie N Graff', 'Tomasz M Beer', 'Bian Liu', 'Guru Sonpavde', 'Emanuela Taioli']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Prognostic significance of C-reactive protein in urological cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The elevated C-reactive protein level is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.', 'Prognostic role of C-reactive protein in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The association between C-reactive protein (CRP) level and biochemical failure-free survival in patients after radiation therapy for nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'C-reactive protein as an adverse prognostic marker for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC): confirmatory results.', 'The Role of C-Reactive Protein in the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Serum biomarkers of inflammation for diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients with nonspecific elevations of serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Efficiency of C-reactive protein in prognosis evaluation of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'C-Reactive Protein Is a Poor Marker of Baseline Inflammation in Prostate Cancer and Response to Radiotherapy or Androgen Ablation.', 'C-Reactive Protein and Cancer-Diagnostic and Therapeutic Insights.']"""

Objective:   To assess attitudes toward decision aids and their dissemination in clinical practice.  Design, setting, and participants:   A survey was mailed to a national random sample of 1422 specialists (711 radiation oncologists and 711 urologists) in the United States from November 1, 2011, through April 30, 2012.  Main outcomes and measures:   Respondents were asked about familiarity, perceptions, and use of decision aids for clinically localized prostate cancer and trust in various professional societies in developing decision aids. The Pearson χ2 test was used to test for bivariate associations between physician characteristics and outcomes.  Results:   Similar response rates were observed for radiation oncologists and urologists (44.0% vs 46.1%; P=.46). Although most respondents had some familiarity with decision aids, only 35.5% currently use a decision aid in clinic practice. The most commonly cited barriers to decision aid use included the perception that their ability to estimate the risk of recurrence was superior to that of decision aids (7.7% in those not using decision aids and 26.2% in those using decision aids; P<.001) and the concern that patients could not process information from a decision aid (7.6% in those not using decision aids and 23.7% in those using decision aids; P<.001). In assessing trust in decision aids established by various professional medical societies, specialists consistently reported trust in favor of their respective organizations, with 9.2% being very confident and 59.2% being moderately confident (P=.01).  Conclusions and relevance:   Use of decision aids among specialists treating patients with prostate cancer is relatively low. Efforts to address barriers to clinical implementation of decision aids may facilitate greater shared decision making for patients diagnosed as having prostate cancer.""","""['Elyn H Wang', 'Cary P Gross', 'Jon C Tilburt', 'James B Yu', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Marc C Smaldone', 'Nilay D Shah', 'Robert Abouassally', 'Maxine Sun', 'Simon P Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""JAMA Intern Med""","""['Resolving the decision aid paradox.', 'Specialty bias in treatment recommendations and quality of life among radiation oncologists and urologists for localized prostate cancer.', 'Clinical implementation of quality of life instruments and prediction tools for localized prostate cancer: results from a national survey of radiation oncologists and urologists.', 'Perceptions of Active Surveillance and Treatment Recommendations for Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Results from a National Survey of Radiation Oncologists and Urologists.', 'A Review of Shared Decision-Making and Patient Decision Aids in Radiation Oncology.', 'Improving prostate cancer care collaboratively - a multidisciplinary, formal, consensus-based approach.', 'Explainable ML models for a deeper insight on treatment decision for localized prostate cancer.', 'Shared Decision Making in Cardiac Electrophysiology Procedures and Arrhythmia Management.', 'Evaluating Clinical Implementation Approaches for Prostate Cancer Decision Support.', 'Perceived barriers to the adoption of active surveillance in low-risk prostate cancer: a qualitative analysis of community and academic urologists.', 'Shared Decision-making in Urologic Practice: Results From the 2019 AUA Census.']"""

Patients and methods:   From 1999 until 2012, we examined 327 patients with T1c-T3bN0M0 prostate cancer that underwent HDR-BT+EBRT and were followed-up for ≥1 year. Before 2005, treatment consisted of HDR-BT at 18 Gy/3 fractions and EBRT to the prostate at 44 Gy/22 fractions, whereas after 2006, treatment consisted of HDR-BT at 19 Gy/2 fractions and EBRT to the prostate at 46 Gy/23 fractions.  Results:   Median age was 68 years (range=45-84 years), median follow-up duration was 57 months (range=12-148 months), and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at diagnosis was 9.2 ng/ml (range=2.6-458.6 ng/ml). The patients' clinical stages were T1c:82, T2a:112, T2b:70, T2c:5, T3a:29, T3b:29, and their Gleason score was ≤6:120, 7:108, ≥8:99, respectively. The 5-year overall survival, and biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) was 97.5% and 95.3%, respectively. Recurrence was reported in 20 cases (6.1%), and 11 patients died during follow-up, but only 1 patient died of prostate cancer. The 5-year recurrence-free survival bRFS for the patients in low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups according to the D'Amico risk classification criteria were 100%, 95.6%, and 90.7%, respectively. Regarding adverse events genitourinary toxicity was major, and thus, 8.8% patients had urethral stricture and 4.3% patients were classified as grade 3.  Conclusion:   HDR-BT+EBRT is considered a suitable treatment modality for localized and locally advanced prostate cancer, including high-risk cases.

Methods:   Multiparameter MRIs in 24 patients before prostatectomy were acquired. Tumour outlines from whole-mount histology, T2-defined peripheral zone (PZ), and central gland (CG) were superimposed onto slice-matched parametric maps. T2, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient, initial area under the gadolinium curve, vascular parameters (K(trans),Kep,Ve), and (choline+polyamines+creatine)/citrate were compared between tumour and non-tumour tissues. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined sensitivity and specificity at spectroscopic voxel resolution and per lesion, and LDA determined the optimal multiparametric model for identifying tumours. Accuracy was compared with an expert observer.  Results:   Tumours were significantly different from PZ and CG for all parameters (all p < 0.001). Area under the ROC curve for discriminating tumour from non-tumour was significantly greater (p < 0.001) for the multiparametric model than for individual parameters; at 90 % specificity, sensitivity was 41 % (MRSI voxel resolution) and 59 % per lesion.

Methods:   New Zealand cancer registry data was linked to hospitalization, pharmaceutical, outpatient, general practice, laboratory, and other datasets, with costs ascribed to each event occurring in 2006-2011. ""Excess"" cancer costs were estimated by subtracting ""expected costs"" for citizens without cancer from the ""total cost"" for cancer patients ($2011 inflation-adjusted). Gamma regressions were used to estimate costs per person-month.  Results:   For first adult cancer diagnosed that the excess cost per person was between US$3400 and US$4300 in the first month postdiagnosis (varied by sex and age), fell to US$50-US$150 per month at 2 or more years postdiagnosis (excluding those within a year of death), but increased again if dying from their cancer (US$3800-US$8300 in the last month of life). Such patterns varied by cancer, for example, in the first month postdiagnosis for 65 year olds it varied 20-fold from US$800 for prostate to US$15,900 for brain cancer. Per diagnosed case, total excess costs varied from US$5000 (melanoma) to US$66,000 (bone and connective tissue) [Corrected]. Excess cancer costs made up 6.5% of total Vote:Health expenditure in 2010-2011, with colorectal (14.7%), breast (14.4%) being the top 2 contributors, and prostate, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and lung each contributing about 6%.

The goal of this study was to evaluate correlations between short-term QOL outcomes and dosimetric parameters to guide future prostate SBRT planning.  Methods and materials:   From 2010 to 2013, QOL data were prospectively collected from 75 patients enrolled in a prostate SBRT clinical trial. A comparison was made between Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite scores for patients with the top 25th percentile versus the bottom 75th percentile of the following dose-volume histogram parameters: planning target volume V100; bladder V50 and V100; and rectum V50, V80, V90, and V100. A linear mixed-effect model was used to estimate the difference between the 2 strata for each parameter.  Results:   Median follow-up was 12 months. Patients with planning target volume V100 volumes >120 cm(3) had the worst reduction in urinary QOL. Urinary QOL was also decreased significantly in patients with bladder V100 volumes >5.5 cm(3). Bowel QOL was decreased significantly in patients with rectal V90 and V100 volumes >4.2 and >1.5 cm(3), respectively.  Conclusions:   Patients with large prostate size or large volumes of rectum and bladder that receive ≥90% of the prescribed radiation dose are more susceptible to short-term QOL decrements after prostate SBRT.

Analysis of MCL1 protein and mRNA expression in PCa tissue and primary cell culture specimens of luminal and basal origin, respectively, reveals higher expression in cancerous tissue compared to benign origin. Using PCa cellular models in vitro and in vivo we show that MCL1 expression is upregulated in androgen-deprived PCa cells. Regulation of MCL1 through the AR signaling axis is indirectly mediated via a cell cycle-dependent mechanism. Using constructs downregulating or overexpressing MCL1 we demonstrate that expression of MCL1 prevents induction of apoptosis when PCa cells are grown under steroid-deprived conditions. The BH3-mimetic Obatoclax induces apoptosis and decreases MCL1 expression in androgen-sensitive PCa cells, while castration-resistant PCa cells are less sensitive and react with an upregulation of MCL1 expression. Synergistic effects of Obatoclax with androgen receptor inactivation can be observed. Moreover, clonogenicity of primary basal PCa cells is efficiently inhibited by Obatoclax.

We showed that T/E fusion can activate NF-kB pathway by increasing phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 Ser536 (p536), but the function of p536 has never been studied in PCa. We report here that active p536 can significantly increase cell motility and transform PNT1a cells (an immortalized normal cell line), suggesting p536 plays a critical role in promoting PCa tumorigenesis. We have discovered a set of p536 regulated genes, among which we validated the regulation of CCL2 by p536. Based on all evidence, we favor that T/E fusion, NF-kB p536 and CCL2 form a signaling chain. Finally, PNT1a cells (not tumorigenic) can form tumors in SCID mice when overexpressing of either wild type or active p65 in the presence of activated AKT, demonstrating synergistic activities of NF-kB and AKT signals in promoting PCa tumorigenesis.

Essentially, the multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that preoperative seropositivity to BKPyV LTag significantly reduced the risk of biochemical recurrence, independently of established predictors of biochemical recurrence such as tumor stage, Gleason score and surgical margin status. The predictive accuracy of the regression model was denotatively increased by the inclusion of the BKPyV LTag serostatus. In contrast, the VP1 serostatus was of no prognostic value. Finally, the BKPyV LTag serostatus was associated with a peculiar cytokine gene expression profile upon assessment of the cellular immune response elicited by LTag. Taken together, our findings suggest that the BKPyV LTag serology may serve as a prognostic factor in prostate cancer. If validated in additional studies, this biomarker may allow for better treatment decisions after radical prostatectomy. Finally, the favorable outcome of LTag seropositive patients may provide a potential opportunity for novel therapeutic approaches targeting a viral antigen.""","""['Xavier Etienne Keller', 'Piotr Kardas', 'Claudio Acevedo', 'Giovanni Sais', 'Cédric Poyet', 'Irina Banzola', 'Ashkan Mortezavi', 'Burkhardt Seifert', 'Tullio Sulser', 'Hans H Hirsch', 'Maurizio Provenzano']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Polyomavirus BK and prostate cancer: a complex interaction of potential clinical relevance.', 'Variations in BK Polyomavirus Immunodominant Large Tumor Antigen-Specific 9mer CD8 T-Cell Epitopes Predict Altered HLA-Presentation and Immune Failure.', 'Clinically Relevant Reactivation of Polyomavirus BK (BKPyV) in HLA-A02-Positive Renal Transplant Recipients Is Associated with Impaired Effector-Memory Differentiation of BKPyV-Specific CD8+ T Cells.', 'Variant morphology and random chromosomal integration of BK polyomavirus in posttransplant urothelial carcinomas.', 'Polyomavirus (BK)-associated pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder: a case report.', 'Liquid Biopsy to Detect DNA/RNA Based Markers of Small DNA Oncogenic Viruses for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Prediction.', 'Pathogenicity of BK virus on the urinary system.', 'Specific Detection of Serum Antibodies against BKPyV, A Small DNA Tumour Virus, in Patients Affected by Choroidal Nevi.', 'Specific IgG Antibodies React to Mimotopes of BK Polyomavirus, a Small DNA Tumor Virus, in Healthy Adult Sera.', 'New insights on the association between the prostate cancer and the small DNA tumour virus, BK polyomavirus.']"""

Roughly 60% of prostate cancers harbor gene fusions that juxtapose ETS-family transcription factors with androgen regulated promoters. A second subtype, characterized by SPINK1 overexpression, accounts for 15% of prostate cancers. Here we report the discovery of a new prostate cancer subtype characterized by rearrangements juxtaposing the SMAD inhibitor SKIL with androgen regulated promoters, leading to increased SKIL expression. SKIL fusions were found in 6 of 540 (1.1%) prostate cancers and 1 of 27 (3.7%) cell lines and xenografts. 6 of 7 SKIL-positive cancers were negative for ETS overexpression, suggesting mutual exclusivity with ETS fusions. SKIL knockdown led to growth arrest in PC-3 and LNCaP cell line models of prostate cancer, and its overexpression led to increased invasiveness in RWPE-1 cells. The role of SKIL as a prostate cancer oncogene lends support to recent studies on the role of TGF-β signaling as a rate-limiting step in prostate cancer progression.

Material and method:   From February 2011 to February 2014, 55 patients underwent a F-PET/CT for biochemical relapse after primary radical therapy for prostate cancer localized or locally advanced. Primary therapies for prostate cancer were 19 radical prostatectomy, 18 radiotherapy, 13 radiotherapy with hormonal treatment, 3 brachytherapy. The median age was 65 years (50-79). The initial staging was 17 T1, 23 T2 and 15 T3, 52 were N0 and N1 3. The median PSA was 12 (3-127).

Upper aerodigestive tract cancer often develops in patients with smoking-related lung cancer; however, little is known about the frequencies or types of other primary malignancies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without a history of smoking.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the records of patients examined and/or treated for NSCLC at the Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation between January 2007 and June 2012. Patients In total, 938 patients, including 599 men (never-smoker/ever-smoker: 35/564) and 339 women (never-smoker/ever-smoker: 236/103), were analyzed.  Results:   Among the 209 patients (22.3%) with multiple primary malignancies, 151 had a history of smoking and 58 were never-smokers. The most common cancers were gastric (43 cases), colorectal (33 cases), and prostate (29 cases) cancer. Smoking-related cancer was more common in current smokers and ex-smokers for both men and women. Among women with NSCLC, never-smokers were more likely to have thyroid cancer than those with a history of smoking (5.1% vs. 0%, p=0.021).  Conclusion:   In this study, several differences in malignancies were observed between never-smokers and patients with a history of smoking.

This is achieved through the combined stimulation of cell migration and prevention of apoptosis and anoikis, thus facilitating repair. Deregulated TFF3 expression at the gene and protein level is implicated in numerous cancers. In prostate cancer TFF3 has previously been reported as a potential biomarker, overexpressed in a subset of primary and metastatic cases. Here we investigated the effect of increased TFF3 expression on prostate cancer cell behaviour. Oncomine analysis demonstrated that TFF3 mRNA expression was upregulated in prostate cancer compared to normal tissue. Forced-expression models were established in the prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3, by stable transfection of an expression vector containing the TFF3 cDNA. Forced expression of TFF3 significantly increased total cell number and cell viability, cell proliferation and cell survival. In addition, TFF3 enhanced anchorage independent growth, 3-dimensional colony formation, wound healing and cell migration compared to control transfected cell lines. We also observed reduced sensitivity to ionising radiation in stably transfected cell lines. In dose response experiments, forced expression of TFF3 significantly enhanced the regrowth of PC3 cells following ionising radiation compared with control transfected cells. In addition, TFF3 enhanced clonogenic survival of DU145 and PC3 cells.

Despite recent advancement in the development of potent and selective PKD small molecule inhibitors, the availability of in vivo active PKD inhibitors remains sparse. In this study, we describe the discovery of a novel PKD small molecule inhibitor, SD-208, from a targeted kinase inhibitor library screen, and the synthesis of a series of analogs to probe the structure-activity relationship (SAR) vs. PKD1. SD-208 displayed a narrow SAR profile, was an ATP-competitive pan-PKD inhibitor with low nanomolar potency and was cell active. Targeted inhibition of PKD by SD-208 resulted in potent inhibition of cell proliferation, an effect that could be reversed by overexpressed PKD1 or PKD3. SD-208 also blocked prostate cancer cell survival and invasion, and arrested cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Mechanistically, SD-208-induced G2/M arrest was accompanied by an increase in levels of p21 in DU145 and PC3 cells as well as elevated phosphorylation of Cdc2 and Cdc25C in DU145 cells. Most importantly, SD-208 given orally for 24 days significantly abrogated the growth of PC3 subcutaneous tumor xenografts in nude mice, which was accompanied by reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis and decreased expression of PKD biomarkers including survivin and Bcl-xL.

Methods and materials:   Fourteen centers were provided the contours of 5 patients. Plans were performed following the dose prescription and constraints for organs at risk (OARs) of a reference paper. The dose prescription was 35 Gy in five fractions for the planning target volume (PTV). Different techniques were used (3D-CRT, fixed-Field IMRT, VMAT, CyberKnife). Plans were compared in terms of dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters. Furthermore, the median DVH was calculated and one patient was re-planned.  Results:   A total of 70 plans were compared. The maximum dose to the body was 107.9 ± 4.5 % (range 101.5-116.3 %). Dose at 98 % (D98 %) and mean dose to the clinical target volume (CTV) were 102.0 ± 0.9 % (global range 101.1-102.9 %) and 105.1 ± 0.6 % (range 98.6-124.6 %). Similar trends were found for D95 % and mean dose to the PTV. Important differences were found in terms of the homogeneity index. Doses to OARs were heterogeneous. The subgroups with the same treatment planning system showed differences comparable to the differences of the whole group. In the re-optimized plans, DVH differences among institutes were reduced and OAR sparing improved.

We investigated the role of additional magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy in reclassifying patients eligible for active surveillance based on systematic biopsy.  Materials and methods:   We performed a study at 2 institutions in a total of 281 men with increased prostate specific antigen. All men met certain criteria, including 1) prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging, 12-core transrectal systematic biopsy and 2 additional magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsies of lesions suspicious for cancer during the same sequence as systematic biopsy, and 2) eligibility for active surveillance based on systematic biopsy results. Criteria for active surveillance were prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml, no Gleason grade 4/5, 5 mm or less involvement of any biopsy core and 2 or fewer positive systematic biopsy cores. Patient characteristics were compared between reclassified and nonreclassified groups based on magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy results.  Results:   On magnetic resonance imaging 58% of the 281 patients had suspicious lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy was positive for cancer in 81 of 163 patients (50%). Of 281 patients 28 (10%) were reclassified by magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy as ineligible for active surveillance based on Gleason score in 8, cancer length in 20 and Gleason score plus cancer length in 9. Suspicious areas on magnetic resonance imaging were in the anterior part of the prostate in 15 of the 28 men (54%). Reclassified patients had a smaller prostate volume (37 vs 52 cc) and were older (66.5 vs 63 years) than those who were not reclassified (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy reclassified 10% of patients who were eligible for active surveillance based on systematic biopsy.

This study was performed among the Dutch participants of IMPACT, a large international study on the effectiveness of PSA screening among BRCA mutation carriers.  Materials and methods:   Urinary PCA3 was measured in 191 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 75 BRCA2 mutation carriers, and 308 noncarriers. The physicians and participants were blinded for the results. Serum PSA level ≥ 3.0 ng/ml was used to indicate prostate biopsies. PCA3 was evaluated (1) as an independent indicator for prostate b iopsies and (2) as an indicator for prostate biopsies among men with an elevated PSA level. PC detected up to the 2-year screening was used as gold standard as end-of-study biopsies were not performed.  Results:   Overall, 23 PCs were diagnosed, 20 of which were in men who had an elevated PSA level in the initial screening round. (1) PCA3, successfully determined in 552 participants, was elevated in 188 (cutoff ≥ 25; 34%) or 134 (cutoff ≥ 35; 24%) participants, including 2 of the 3 PCs missed by PSA. PCA3 would have added 157 (≥ 25; 28%) or 109 (≥ 35; 20%) biopsy sessions to screening with PSA only. (2) Elevated PCA3 as a requirement for biopsies in addition to PSA would have saved 37 (cutoff ≥ 25) or 43 (cutoff ≥ 35) of the 68 biopsy sessions, and 7 or 11 PCs would have been missed, respectively, including multiple high-risk PCs. So far, PCA3 performed best among BRCA2 mutation carriers, but the numbers are still small. Because PCA3 was not used to indicate prostate biopsies, its true diagnostic value cannot be calculated.  Conclusions:   The results do not provide evidence for PCA3 as a useful additional indicator of prostate biopsies in BRCA mutation carriers, as many participants had an elevated PCA3 in the absence of PC. This must be interpreted with caution because PCA3 was not used to indicate biopsies. Many participants diagnosed with PC had low PCA3, making it invalid as a restrictive marker for prostate biopsies in men with elevated PSA levels.""","""['Ruben G Cremers', 'Rosalind A Eeles', 'Elizabeth K Bancroft', 'Janneke Ringelberg-Borsboom', 'Hans F Vasen', 'Christi J Van Asperen;IMPACT Steering Committee;Jack A Schalken', 'Gerald W Verhaegh', 'Lambertus A Kiemeney']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Targeted prostate cancer screening in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers: results from the initial screening round of the IMPACT study.', 'Interim Results from the IMPACT Study: Evidence for Prostate-specific Antigen Screening in BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.', 'Clinical utility of the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) urine assay in Japanese men undergoing prostate biopsy.', 'Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 as a Tumour Marker: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'The novel prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) biomarker.', 'Graphene-based biosensors for the detection of prostate cancer protein biomarkers: a review.', 'Screening and Detection of Prostate Cancer-Review of Literature and Current Perspective.', ""What's new in screening in 2015?"", 'Implications of High Rates of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.']"""

We investigated the effect of the primary tumor that is left untreated on prostate cancer-specific morbidity and mortality, time to castration resistance, and overall survival (OS).  Methods:   We performed a bicentric cohort study. The overall population included de novo metastatic CaP managed at the Genito-Urinary Oncology Unit of the Gustave Roussy Institute and the Urology Clinic of the University Hospital of Pointe-à-Pitre, France. Descriptive statistical and outcome analyses were performed in the overall cohort and also separately in the N+M0 and M+subgroups.  Results:   The overall cohort included 263 patients. Approximately two-thirds of patients (64%) presented with locoregional symptoms at diagnosis, and 78% throughout the disease. Of the symptomatic patients, 59% required a locoregional procedure. Median OS of patients with locoregional symptoms at diagnosis was shorter than in those who were asymptomatic (47 vs. 86 mo, P = 0.0007); this difference was maintained in the N+M0 and M+subgroups. Median OS and time to castration resistance showed a nonsignificant trend in favor of patients undergoing a locoregional treatment at diagnosis.

Nomograms may improve the predictive value of a positive prostate biopsy (PB) finding. We compare in a prospective study of Chilean men suspicious of having prostate cancer (PC), owing to an elevated total serum PSA or abnormal digital rectal examination finding or both, the use of the online Montreal nomogram for the detection of primary malignant circulating prostate cells (mCPCs) to predict a positive PB finding.  Methods and patients:   Consecutive men suspicious of PC underwent 12-core transrectal ultrasound PB; their age, total serum PSA levels and percent free PSA values, and Montreal nomogram scores were registered. Immediately before the PB, an 8-ml blood sample was taken to detect primary mCPCs. Mononuclear cells were obtained by differential gel centrifugation and identified using double immunomarcations with anti-PSA and anti-P504S. Biopsies were classified according to presence of cancer/no cancer. The test results for the detection of mCPC were stated as negative/positive, and the total number of cells/8 ml of blood was registered. Areas under the curve for total serum PSA level, percent free PSA value, Montreal score, and detection of mCPCs were calculated and compared. Diagnostic yields, the number of possible biopsies that could be avoided, and the number of clinically significant cancers that would be missed were calculated.  Results:   Overall, 607 men underwent biopsy, where 197 (32.5%) had cancer. These men were significantly older, had higher total serum PSA level and Montreal score, and lower percent free PSA value. The values for area under the curve were 0.56 for total PSA level, 0.78 for percent free PSA, 0.78 for Montreal score, and 0.84 for mCPC detection; mCPC detection had a significantly superior prediction value (P = 0.018). Using cutoff values of percent free PSA < 10%, Montreal score > 50%, and ≥ 1 mCPC detected, mCPC detection had a higher diagnostic yield. Of the 197 cancers, 41 complied with the criteria for active surveillance; percent free PSA and the Montreal score missed a higher number of significant cancers when compared with mCPC detection.

Molecular mechanism by which TGFβ1 suppresses early prostate tumor growth and induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in advanced stages is not known. We determined if P21-activated kinase1 (Pak1), which mediates cytoskeletal remodeling is necessary for the TGFβ1 induced prostate cancer EMT. Effects of TGFβ1 on control prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells and those with IPA 3 and siRNA mediated Pak1 inhibition were tested for prostate tumor xenograft in vivo and EMT in vitro. TGFβ1 inhibited PC3 tumor xenograft growth via activation of P38-MAPK and caspase-3, 9. Long-term stimulation with TGFβ1 induced PC3 and DU145 cell scattering and increased expression of EMT markers such as Snail and N-cadherin through tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6)-mediated activation of Rac1/Pak1 pathway. Selective inhibition of Pak1 using IPA 3 or knockdown using siRNA both significantly inhibited TGFβ1-induced prostate cancer cell EMT and expression of mesenchymal markers.

Androgen blockade significantly increases plasma adiponectin levels, which has some efficacy against MetS, whereas ADT increases fasting plasma insulin and decreases insulin sensitivity, suggesting that there are other mechanisms involved in the onset of MetS besides adiponectin activation. We investigated the effects of ADT on serum aP2 and adiponectin in PCa patients. Six months post-ADT, serum aP2 and adiponectin levels were significantly increased, although there were no changes in patient body weight and no correlation between the changes in serum aP2 and total adiponectin levels. The serum adiponectin and aP2 levels have independent implications in ADT for PCa; therefore, their combined measurement will clarify the impact on the development of obesity-related diseases during ADT.

Instead, these mice develop highly metastatic tumors of neuroendocrine, not epithelial, origin within the urogenital tract to give prostate cancer in the males and vaginal tumors in the females. Additionally, we discovered that the sole inactivation of Rb in the intestine was sufficient to induce formation of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas. These tumors closely mirror the human disease in regard to the age of onset, histological appearance, invasiveness and metastatic potential. Like most human colorectal carcinomas, our murine Rb-deficient tumors demonstrate genomic instability and they show activation of β-catenin. Deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is specific to the intestinal tumors, as genomic instability but not activation of β-catenin was observed in the neuroendocrine tumors.

Materials and methods:   We genotyped 242,186 SNPs on a custom HumanExome BeadChip v1.0 (Illuminam Inc.) from the blood DNA of 776 PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Genetic data were analyzed to calculate an odds ratio as an estimate of the relative risk of biochemical recurrence. And we compared accuracies from the multivariate model incorporating clinicopathological factors between included and excluded selected lead single nucleotide polymorphisms. Biochemical recurrence-free survival outcomes also analyzed using these genetic variations.  Results:   Genetic array analysis indicated that eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs77080351, rs200944490, rs2071292, rs117237810, rs191118242, rs4965121, rs61742396, and rs6573513) were significant to predict biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. When a multivariate model incorporating clinicopathological factors was devised to predict biochemical recurrence, the predictive accuracy of model was 85.1 %. By adding in two individual variations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the multivariate model, the predictive accuracy increased to 87.7 % (P = 0.045). With three variations of single nucleotide polymorphisms, the predictive accuracy further improved to 89.0 % (P = 0.025). These genetic variations had a significantly decreased biochemical recurrence-free survival rate.

Serum coffee metabolites are integrated exposure measures that may clarify associations with cancer and elucidate underlying mechanisms.  Objectives:   Our aims were 2-fold as follows: 1) to identify serum metabolites associated with coffee intake and 2) to examine these metabolites in relation to colorectal cancer.  Design:   In a nested case-control study of 251 colorectal cancer cases and 247 matched control subjects from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, we conducted untargeted metabolomics analyses of baseline serum by using ultrahigh-performance liquid-phase chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Usual coffee intake was self-reported in a food-frequency questionnaire. We used partial Pearson correlations and linear regression to identify serum metabolites associated with coffee intake and conditional logistic regression to evaluate associations between coffee metabolites and colorectal cancer.  Results:   After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (P = 0.05 ÷ 657 metabolites), 29 serum metabolites were positively correlated with coffee intake (partial correlation coefficients: 0.18-0.61; P < 7.61 × 10(-5)); serum metabolites most highly correlated with coffee intake (partial correlation coefficients >0.40) included trigonelline (N'-methylnicotinate), quinate, and 7 unknown metabolites. Of 29 serum metabolites, 8 metabolites were directly related to caffeine metabolism, and 3 of these metabolites, theophylline (OR for 90th compared with 10th percentiles: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.79; P-linear trend = 0.006), caffeine (OR for 90th compared with 10th percentiles: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.89; P-linear trend = 0.015), and paraxanthine (OR for 90th compared with 10th percentiles: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.94; P-linear trend = 0.027), were inversely associated with colorectal cancer.  Conclusions:   Serum metabolites can distinguish coffee drinkers from nondrinkers; some caffeine-related metabolites were inversely associated with colorectal cancer and should be studied further to clarify the role of coffee in the cause of colorectal cancer.

Methods:   We identified 34 195 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent a radical prostatectomy from 2010 to 2011. All patients also had to have both clinical and pathological Gleason scores available for analysis. The concordance of the biopsy Gleason score to the pathological Gleason score was analysed using the coefficient of agreement (κ). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine potential factors that may impact concordance of Gleason score.  Results:   Overall, the clinical and pathological Gleason scores matched in 55.4% of patients. The concordance rates were 55.3% for Gleason 6, 66.9% for Gleason 3+4, 42.9% for Gleason 4+3 and 24.8% for Gleason 8, with frequent downgrading to Gleason 7. The κ for Gleason score concordance was 0.36 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.37), indicating fair agreement. The weighted κ for Gleason score concordance was 0.51 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.52), indicating moderate agreement. Additionally, the Bowker tests of symmetry were highly significant (p<0.001), indicating that when discordant findings were present, pathological upgrading was more common than downgrading.  Conclusions:   This study is, to our knowledge, the largest contemporary study of prostate biopsy concordance.

Therefore, blue maize could be directed to produce nutraceutical extracts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between anthocyanins composition of acidified and non-acidified extracts from native and hybrid blue maize genotypes and their antiproliferative effect in mammary (MCF7), liver (HepG2), colon (Caco2 and HT29) and prostate (PC3) cancer cells. The most abundant phenolic acid was ferulic acid. Nine anthocyanins were quantified in the extracts, being Cy3-Glu the most abundant. Acylated forms were also obtained in high abundance depending of the extraction method. An extract concentration range of 4.31 to 7.23 mg/mL inhibited by 50% the growth of untransformed cells NIH3T3. Antiproliferative effect on PC3, Caco2, HepG2 and MCF7 cancer cells of acidified extracts from hybrid blue maize was larger than the observed using non-acidified extracts. Among the nine compounds that were quantified in the extracts tested, CyMalGlu I showed the strongest correlation with the reduction of cell viability in Caco2 (-0.876), HepG2 (-0.813), MCF7 (-0.765) and PC3 (-0.894). No significant correlation or differences in antiproliferative effect on HT29 was found among the extracts.

Methods:   The expression profiles of three clinical outcome groups after radical prostatectomy (RP) were compared: those with no evidence of disease (NED; n = 108); those with BCR (rise in prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level without metastasis; n = 163); and those with metastasis (n = 192). The patients were profiled using Human Exon 1.0 ST microarrays, and outcomes were supported by a median 18 years of follow-up. A metastasis signature was defined and verified in an independent RP cohort to ensure the robustness of the signature. Furthermore, bioinformatics characterization of the signature was conducted to decipher its biology.  Results:   Minimal gene expression differences were observed between adjuvant treatment-naïve patients in the NED group and patients without metastasis in the BCR group. More than 95% of the differentially expressed genes (metastasis signature) were found in comparisons between primary tumours of metastasis patients and the two other outcome groups. The metastasis signature was validated in an independent cohort and was significantly associated with cell cycle genes, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, DNA repair, androgen, G-protein coupled and NOTCH signal transduction pathways.  Conclusion:   This study shows that metastasis development after BCR is associated with a distinct transcriptional programme that can be detected in the primary tumour.

We propose that blocking of estrogen hormone binding to ERα using the ERα blocker toremifene will reduce the tumorigenicity of prostate cancer, and nano-targeted delivery of toremifene will improve anticancer efficacy. We report the synthesis and use in an orthotopic mouse model of PLGA-PEG nanoparticles encapsulating toremifene and nanoparticles encapsulating toremifene that are also conjugated to anti-PSMA for targeted prostate tumor delivery.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cell line PC3M and a nude mouse model were used to test efficacy of nano-targeted and nano-encapsulated toremifene versus free toremifene on the growth and differentiation of tumor cells.  Results:   Treatment with free toremifene resulted in a significant reduction in growth of prostate tumor and proliferation, and its nano-targeting resulted in greater reduction of prostate tumor growth, greater toremifene tumor uptake, and enhanced tumor necrosis. Tumors from animals treated with nano-encapsulated toremifene conjugated with anti-PSMA showed about a 15-fold increase of toremifene compared to free toremifene.

Methods:   Diffusion-prepared bSSFP was compared with single-shot DW echo planar imaging (SS-DW-EPI) at two prescribed resolutions (2.1 × 2.1 × 3.5mm(3) , 0.9 × 0.9 × 3.5 mm(3) ) in nine healthy subjects and nine AS-PC patients.

Results:   Geometric distortion and susceptibility artifacts were significantly less for diffusion-prepared bSSFP at both prescribed spatial resolutions than SS-DW-EPI. Apparent diffusion coefficients of healthy prostate tissue were concordant between the two DW methods at both spatial resolutions. In AS-PC patients, multiparametric MRI with diffusion-prepared bSSFP had greater sensitivity (94%, 63%), accuracy (76%, 67%), positive-predictive value (54%, 48%), negative-predictive value (97%, 82%), and area under the curve (0.80, 0.67) than with SS-DW-EPI.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship of androgen and PSA levels and to better understand the reason that some PCa patients have low serum PSA values. The in vitro data demonstrated that cultured LNCaP cells ceased to produce PSA after androgen withdrawal and resumed PSA production after androgen was re-added. The in vivo experiment results showed that 48% of PCa xenografts carrying mice have serum PSA level lower than 4 ng ml-1 . The serum PSA levels increased significantly with rises in testosterone (T) levels 1 week after T pellet implantation. These data indicated that the androgen is a key factor controlling the production of PSA. Low serum PSA levels in mice with PCa xenografts are associated with low serum T levels. Raising serum T levels in tumor caring mice will also significantly increase serum PSA level.

Methods:   Forty three patients who had undergone salvage radiation therapy following biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy with greater than 4 years of follow-up data were identified. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were collected for all patients and total RNA was isolated from 1mm cores enriched for tumor (>70%). Eight hundred miRNAs were analyzed simultaneously using the nCounter human miRNA v2 assay (NanoString Technologies; Seattle, WA). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportion hazards regression models as well as receiver operating characteristics were used to identify statistically significant miRNAs that were predictive of biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Eighty eight miRNAs were identified to be significantly (p<0.05) associated with biochemical failure post-prostatectomy by multivariate analysis and clustered into two groups that correlated with early (≤ 36 months) versus late recurrence (>36 months). Nine miRNAs were identified to be significantly (p<0.05) associated by multivariate analysis with biochemical failure after salvage radiation therapy. A new predictive model for biochemical recurrence after salvage radiation therapy was developed; this model consisted of miR-4516 and miR-601 together with, Gleason score, and lymph node status. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was improved to 0.83 compared to that of 0.66 for Gleason score and lymph node status alone.  Conclusion:   miRNA signatures can distinguish patients who fail soon after radical prostatectomy versus late failures, giving insight into which patients may need adjuvant therapy. Notably, two novel miRNAs (miR-4516 and miR-601) were identified that significantly improve prediction of biochemical failure post-salvage radiation therapy compared to clinico-histopathological factors, supporting the use of miRNAs within clinically used predictive models. Both findings warrant further validation studies.""","""['Erica Hlavin Bell', 'Simon Kirste', 'Jessica L Fleming', 'Petra Stegmaier', 'Vanessa Drendel', 'Xiaokui Mo', 'Stella Ling', 'Denise Fabian', 'Isabel Manring', 'Cordula A Jilg', 'Wolfgang Schultze-Seemann', 'Maureen McNulty', 'Debra L Zynger', 'Douglas Martin', 'Julia White', 'Martin Werner', 'Anca L Grosu', 'Arnab Chakravarti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Impact of Gleason pattern 5 including tertiary pattern 5 on outcomes of salvage treatment for biochemical recurrence in pT2-3N0M0 prostate cancer.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Larger maximum tumor diameter at radical prostatectomy is associated with increased biochemical failure, metastasis, and death from prostate cancer after salvage radiation for prostate cancer.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Tissue-Based MicroRNAs as Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: What Can We Learn from Past Studies?', 'TRIB1 confers therapeutic resistance in GBM cells by activating the ERK and Akt pathways.', 'Prognostic value of miR-21 for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'MicroRNA: a novel implication for damage and protection against ionizing radiation.', 'Molecular profiling of radical prostatectomy tissue from patients with no sign of progression identifies ERG as the strongest independent predictor of recurrence.', 'A Novel Predictor Tool of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy Based on a Five-MicroRNA Tissue Signature.']"""

Human PC-3 and LNCaP PCa cell lines were analyzed in order to assess whether silencing of GOLPH3 expression affects cell vitality, migration and invasion, in vitro. An immunohistochemistry analysis was performed in order to measure the expression of GOLPH3 in samples from 117 patients with PCa and from 50 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Associations between GOLPH3 expression and clinicopathological parameters, such as overall survival, were assessed. GOLPH3 expression was shown to be significantly greater in PCa tissues than in BPH tissues. GOLPH3 expression was positively correlated with Gleason score (P=0.031), tumor stage (T stage; P=0.020) and lymph node status (P=0.013), in patients with PCa. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (serum prostate-specific antigen-based) and overall survival, were reduced in patients with GOLPH3-positive PCa. A multivariate analysis indicated that GOLPH3 expression was an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival [hazard ratio (HR), 2.943; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.190-5.521; P=0.028], and of overall survival (HR, 4.371; 95% CI, 2.045-7.109; P=0.014). Transfection with GOLPH3‑targeted small interfering RNA reduced the capability of PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines to proliferate, migrate and invade in vitro, compared with the controls.

Results of previous studies indicated that AR, a transcription factor, occupies distinct genomic loci in CRPC compared with hormone-naïve PCa; however, the cause of this distinction was unknown. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1 is a model AR target modulated by androgens in hormone-naïve PCa but not in CRPC. Using Nrdp1, we investigated how AR switches transcription programs during CRPC progression. The proximal Nrdp1 promoter contains an androgen response element (ARE); we demonstrated AR binding to this ARE in androgen-sensitive PCa. Analysis of hormone-naive human prostatectomy specimens revealed correlation between Nrdp1 and AR expression, supporting AR regulation of NRDP1 levels in androgen-sensitive tissue. However, despite sustained AR levels, AR binding to the Nrdp1 promoter and Nrdp1 expression were suppressed in CRPC. Elucidation of the suppression mechanism demonstrated correlation of NRDP1 levels with nuclear localization of the scaffolding protein filamin A (FLNA) which, as we previously showed, is itself repressed following ADT in many CRPC tumors. Restoration of nuclear FLNA in CRPC stimulated AR binding to Nrdp1 ARE, increased its transcription, and augmented NRDP1 protein expression and responsiveness to ADT, indicating that nuclear FLNA controls AR-mediated androgen-sensitive Nrdp1 transcription. Expression of other AR-regulated genes lost in CRPC was also re-established by nuclear FLNA. Thus, our results indicate that nuclear FLNA promotes androgen-dependent AR-regulated transcription in PCa, while loss of nuclear FLNA in CRPC alters the AR-regulated transcription program.""","""['Rosalinda M Savoy', 'Liqun Chen', 'Salma Siddiqui', 'Frank U Melgoza', 'Blythe Durbin-Johnson', 'Christiana Drake', 'Maitreyee K Jathal', 'Swagata Bose', 'Thomas M Steele', 'Benjamin A Mooso', ""Leandro S D'Abronzo"", 'William H Fry', 'Kermit L Carraway rd', 'Maria Mudryj', 'Paramita M Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Nrdp1-mediated regulation of ErbB3 expression by the androgen receptor in androgen-dependent but not castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of the transcriptional coactivator FHL2 licenses activation of the androgen receptor in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transcript Levels of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 and Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 2C in Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor transcriptional activity is required for heregulin-1β-mediated nuclear localization of the HER3/ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase.', 'Neuropilin-2 regulates androgen-receptor transcriptional activity in advanced prostate cancer.', 'The expression of myosin-regulated light chain interacting protein (MYLIP) in lung cancer and its inhibitory effects on lung carcinomas.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Nuclear Transport of NRDP1 in Prostate Cancer Cells Is Associated with Worse Patient Outcomes.', 'Transcriptomic Analysis of LNCaP Tumor Xenograft to Elucidate the Components and Mechanisms Contributed by Tumor Environment as Targets for Dietary Prostate Cancer Prevention Studies.']"""

This study is also aimed to estimate the number of already cured cancer patients, whose mortality rates have become undistinguishable from that of the general population of the same age and sex.  Materials and methods:   The study took advantage of the information from the AIRTUM database, which included 29 Cancer Registries (covering 21 million people, 35% of the Italian population). A total of 1,624,533 cancer cases diagnosed between 1976 and 2009 contributed to the study. For each registry, the observed prevalence was calculated. Prevalence for lengths of time exceeding the maximum duration of the registration and of the complete prevalence were derived by applying an estimated correction factor, the completeness index. This index was estimated by means of statistical regression models using cancer incidence and survival data available in registries with 18 years of observation or more. For 50 types or combinations of neoplasms, complete prevalence was estimated at 1.1.2010 as an absolute number and as a proportion per 100,000 inhabitants by sex, age group, area of residence, and years since diagnosis. Projections of complete prevalence for 1.1.2015 were computed under the assumption of a linear trend of the complete prevalence observed until 2010. Validated mixture cure models were used to estimate: the cure fraction, that is the proportion of patients who, starting from the time of diagnosis, are expected to reach the same mortality rate of the general population; the conditional relative survival (CRS), that is the cumulative probability of surviving some additional years, given that patients already survived a certain number of years; the time to cure, that is the number of years necessary so that conditional survival in the following five years (5-year CRS) exceeds the conventional threshold of 95% (i.e., mortality rates in cancer patients become undistinguishable compared to those of the general population); the proportion of patients already cured, i.e., people alive since a number of years exceeding time to cure.  Results:   As of 1.1.2010, it was estimated that 2,587,347 people were alive after a cancer diagnosis, corresponding to 4.4% of the Italian population. A relevant geographical heterogeneity emerged, with a prevalence above 5% in northern registries and below 4% in southern areas. Men were 45% of the total (1,154,289) and women 55% (1,433,058). In the population aged 75 years or more, the proportions of prevalent cases were 20% in males and 13% in females, 11% between 60 and 74 years of age in both sexes. Nearly 600,000 Italian women were alive after a breast cancer diagnosis (41% of all women with this neoplasm), followed by women with cancers of the colon rectum (12%), corpus uteri (7%), and thyroid (6%). In men, 26% of prevalent cases (295,624) were patients with prostate cancer, 16% with either bladder or colon rectum cancer. The projections for 1.1.2015 are of three million (3,036,741) people alive after a cancer diagnosis, 4.9% of the Italian population; with a 20% increase for males and 15% for females, compared to 2010. The cure fractions were heterogeneous according to cancer type and age. Estimates obtained as the sum of cure fractions for all cancer types showed that more than 60% of patients diagnosed below the age of 45 years will reach the same mortality rate of the general population. This proportion decreased with increasing age and it was <30% for cancer diagnosed after the age of 74 years. It was observed that 60% of all prevalent cases (1,543,531 people or 2.6% of overall Italian population) had been diagnosed >5 years earlier (long-term survivors). Time to cure (5-year CRS>95%) was reached in <10 years by patients with cancers of the stomach, colon rectum, pancreas, corpus and cervix uteri, brain, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Mortality rates similar to the ones reported by the general population were reached after approximately 20 years for breast and prostate cancer patients. Five-year CRS remained <95% for >25 years after cancer diagnosis in patients with liver and larynx cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, and leukaemia. Time to cure was reached by 27% (20% in men and 33% in women) of all people living after a cancer diagnosis, defined as already cured.  Conclusions:   The study showed a steady increase over time (nearly +3% per year) of prevalent cases in Italy. A quarter of Italian cancer patients alive in 2010 can be considered as already cured. The AIRTUM Report 2014 describes characteristics of cancer patients and former-patients for 50 cancer types or combinations by sex and age. This detailed information promotes the conduction of studies aimed at expanding the current knowledge on the quality of life of these patients during and after the active phase of treatments (prevalence according to health status), on the long-term effects of treatments (in particular for paediatric patients), on the cost profile of cancer patients, and on rare tumours. All these observations have a high potential impact on health planning, clinical practice, and, most of all, patients' perspective.""","""['AIRTUM Working Group']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Epidemiol Prev""","""['ERRATA CORRIGE: Epidemiol Prev 2014;38(6) Suppl 1.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2010: Cancer prevalence in Italy.

Methods:   Thirty patients with localized prostate cancer (mean age 69.4 ± 6.7 years) confirmed by biopsy were prospectively enrolled for simultaneous PET/MRI imaging. The patients underwent (18)F-FCH PET/MRI 1 week before undergoing total prostatectomy. Multiple parameters of diffusion-weighted MRI [minimum and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin and ADCmean)], metabolic PET [maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean)], and metabolic volumetric PET [metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and uptake volume product (UVP)] were compared with laboratory, pathologic, and immunohistochemical (IHC) features of the prostate cancer specimen. PET parameters were divided into two categories as follows: volume of interest (VOI) of prostate by SUV cutoff 2.5 (SUVmax, SUVmean, MTVSUV, and UVPSUV) and MRI-assisted VOI of prostate cancer (SUVmaxMRI, SUVmeanMRI, MTVMRI, and UVPMRI).  Results:   The rates of prostate cancer-positive cases identified by MRI alone, (18)F-FCH PET alone, and (18)F-FCH PET/MRI were 83.3, 80.0, and 93.3%, respectively. Among the multiple PET/MRI parameters, MTVMRI showed fair correlation with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA; r = 0.442, p = 0.014) and highest correlation with tumor volume (r = 0.953, p < 0.001). UVPMRI showed highest correlation with serum PSA (r = 0.531, p = 0.003), good correlation with tumor volume (r = 0.908, p < 0.001), and it was significantly associated with Gleason score (p = 0.041). High MTVMRI and UVPMRI values were significant for perineural invasion, lymphatic invasion, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and positive B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression (all p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   Simultaneous (18)F-FCH PET/MRI demonstrated a better diagnostic value for localized prostate cancer detection than each individual modality.

The rate of positive surgical margins (PSM) was compared between anticipated HR cancer according to D'Amico risk classification and discovered postoperative HR cancer.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective study was conducted between 2006 and 2013 on patients who underwent RARP. Before surgery, patients were divided according to the D'Amico risk classification. After surgery, HR was defined as pT3a or pT3b, or Gleason score≥8 or positive lymph nodes. The rate of PSM was compared according to the D'Amico risk classification and postoperative HR.  Results:   During the study, 485 patients were reviewed. Before surgery, 10 % of cancers were classified as D'Amico 3 (49/485). After surgery, 27.6 % (134/485) were classified as HR. There was a significant difference between the rate of PSM in HR/D'Amico 3 and HR/non D'Amico 3 cancer, respectively 22.9 % and 34.3 % (P<0.001).  Conclusion:   The RARP is feasible in HR with an average of 30 % of PSM as in open surgery. However, the accurate assessment of preoperative HR will allow a more adapted dissection and a decrease of rate of PSM. So it is necessary to improve the detection of HR and so to select the most suitable cancer for surgery.

Using a two-step gold nanoparticle-enabled dynamic light scattering assay, we discovered that the amount of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the gold nanoparticle protein corona is increased in prostate cancer patients compared to noncancer controls. Two pilot studies conducted on blood serum samples collected at Florida Hospital and obtained from Prostate Cancer Biorespository Network (PCBN) revealed that the test has a 90-95% specificity and 50% sensitivity in detecting early stage prostate cancer, representing a significant improvement over the current PSA test. The increased amount of human IgG found in the protein corona is believed to be associated with the autoantibodies produced in cancer patients as part of the immunodefense against tumor. Proteomic analysis of the nanoparticle protein corona revealed molecular profile differences between cancer and noncancer serum samples. Autoantibodies and natural antibodies produced in cancer patients in response to tumorigenesis have been found and detected in the blood of many cancer types. The test may be applicable for early detection and risk assessment of a broad spectrum of cancer.

For example, expert M1 versus software A showed a sensitivity of 90.0%, specificity of 98.9%, positive predictive value of 88.2%, and negative predictive value of 98.3% with DICOM files, versus 69.2, 88.2, 38.3, and 96.4% with Interfile format, respectively. Generally, patient-specific settings did not influence the diagnostic characteristics of the software versus balanced setting with expert reading as reference.  Conclusion:   EXINI Bone(BSI) showed high sensitivity and specificity for bone metastasis in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. The software ruled out metastasis with confidence, whereas the positive predictive value was modest.

Bromodomain- and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1) is a multidomain histone binder and a master activator of three lysine acetyltransferases, MOZ, MORF and HBO1, which are also known as KAT6A, KAT6B and KAT7, respectively. While the MOZ and MORF genes are rearranged in leukemia, the MORF gene is also mutated in prostate and other cancers and in four genetic disorders with intellectual disability. Here we show that forebrain-specific inactivation of the mouse Brpf1 gene causes hypoplasia in the dentate gyrus, including underdevelopment of the suprapyramidal blade and complete loss of the infrapyramidal blade. We trace the developmental origin to compromised Sox2+ neural stem cells and Tbr2+ intermediate neuronal progenitors. We further demonstrate that Brpf1 loss deregulates neuronal migration, cell cycle progression and transcriptional control, thereby causing abnormal morphogenesis of the hippocampus. These results link histone binding and acetylation control to hippocampus development and identify an important epigenetic regulator for patterning the dentate gyrus, a brain structure critical for learning, memory and adult neurogenesis.""","""['Linya You', 'Kezhi Yan', 'Jinfeng Zou', 'Hong Zhao', 'Nicholas R Bertos', 'Morag Park', 'Edwin Wang', 'Xiang-Jiao Yang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['Correction: The Lysine Acetyltransferase Activator Brpf1 Governs Dentate Gyrus Development through Neural Stem Cells and Progenitors.', 'BRPF1-KAT6A/KAT6B Complex: Molecular Structure, Biological Function and Human Disease.', 'Deficiency of the chromatin regulator BRPF1 causes abnormal brain development.', 'MOZ and MORF acetyltransferases: Molecular interaction, animal development and human disease.', 'Mutations in the Chromatin Regulator Gene BRPF1 Cause Syndromic Intellectual Disability and Deficient Histone Acetylation.', 'Expression atlas of the multivalent epigenetic regulator Brpf1 and its requirement for survival of mouse embryos.', 'Tip60/KAT5 Histone Acetyltransferase Is Required for Maintenance and Neurogenesis of Embryonic Neural Stem Cells.', 'The MOZ-BRPF1 acetyltransferase complex in epigenetic crosstalk linked to gene regulation, development, and human diseases.', 'BRPF1 bridges H3K4me3 and H3K23ac in human embryonic stem cells and is essential to pluripotency.', 'The role of altered protein acetylation in neurodegenerative disease.', 'BRPF1-KAT6A/KAT6B Complex: Molecular Structure, Biological Function and Human Disease.']"""

NDRG2 (N-Myc downstream regulated gene 2), a recently identified tumor suppressor, was previously shown to inhibit the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer, but whether NDRG2 is involved in CRPC remains to be known. Because androgen receptor (AR) axis plays an important role in castration resistance, we evaluate the role of NDRG2 in AR signaling and CRPC. Immunohistochemistry examination of prostate cancer tissues demonstrated that the expression of NDRG2 is negatively correlated with that of AR and c-Myc. Furthermore, AR negatively regulates NDRG2, as well as alters levels of c-Myc and prostate specific antigen (PSA). Forced expression of NDRG2 significantly inhibits the in vitro growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells; this was accompanied by alterations in PSA, but not by those of AR and c-Myc. Finally, by mimicking castration therapy in a xenograft mouse model, we showed that lentivirus-mediated NDRG2 overexpression efficiently overcomes castration resistance. Thus, by acting as a negative regulator downstream of AR, NDRG2 may emerge as a potential therapy molecule for CRPC.""","""['Chuigong Yu', 'Guojun Wu', 'Ruixiao Li', 'Lei Gao', 'Fan Yang', 'Yi Zhao', 'Jian Zhang', 'Rui Zhang', 'Jing Zhang', 'Libo Yao', 'Jianlin Yuan', 'Xia Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Combination of carmustine and selenite effectively inhibits tumor growth by targeting androgen receptor, androgen receptor-variants, and Akt in preclinical models: New hope for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'RGS2 is prognostic for development of castration resistance and cancer-specific survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of a castrate-resistant prostate cancer xenograft derived from a patient of West African ancestry.', 'Identification of Key MicroRNAs and Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer Evolution Based on Biomarker Prioritization Model and Carcinogenic Survey.', 'NDRG2 Regulates the Expression of Genes Involved in Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Hypoxia-Responsive Mir-301a and Mir-301b Promote Radioresistance of Prostate Cancer Cells via Downregulating NDRG2.']"""

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced phosphorylation of Par6 on the conserved serine 345 is implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer. Here we investigated the importance of phosphorylated Par6 in prostate cancer.  Methods:   We generated a p-Par6(345)-specific antibody and verified its specificity in vitro. Endogenous p-Par6(345) was analysed by immunoblotting in normal human prostate RWPE1 and prostate cancer (PC-3U) cells. Subcellular localisation of p-Par6(345) in migrating TGFβ-treated PC-3U cells was analysed by confocal imaging. Invasion assays of TGFβ-treated PC-3U cells were performed. p-Par6 expression was immunohistochemically analysed in prostate cancer tissues.  Results:   TGFβ induced Par6 phosphorylation on Ser345 and its recruitment to the leading edge of the membrane ruffle in migrating PC-3U cells, where it colocalised with aPKCζ. The p-Par6-aPKCζ complex is important for cell migration and invasion, as interference with this complex prevented prostate cancer cell invasion.

Thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was co-immobilized with 3-mercapto-1-propanol on gold electrodes, and used as a scaffold for DNA aptamer attachment through hybridization of the aptamer overhang (so-called ""DNA-directed immobilization aptamer sensors"", DDIAS).

A double stranded DNA intercalator with a ferrocenyl (Fc) redox marker was synthesized to evaluate the feasibility of the strategy. The results demonstrate that the 'in-solution' method offers a favourable medium (in a homogeneous solution) for the binding between the aptamer and PSA, which shows to be more efficient than the 'on-chip' approach.

Normal prostates (n = 8) were characterized by AR+CK8/18+ luminal cells and few CK5+ basal cells, while CK14 was absent. Similar pattern was observed in all 35 prostates with benign prostatic hyperplasia, except few scattered CK14+ basal cells in 13 samples (37.14%). AR was localized in the nucleus of both normal and hyperplastic cells. In 34 samples of PC, the following growth patterns were identified: cribriform (44.12%), solid (32.35%), small acinar/ductal (20.59%), and micropapillary (2.94%). Most PCs expressed AR and CK8/18, while CK5 and CK14 expression was observed in 25% and 20% of cases, respectively. AR revealed a variable intracellular distribution, both nuclear and cytoplasmic. Solid PC was characterized by an undifferentiated or aberrant phenotype with a reduced expression of AR and CK8/18, increased number of CK14+ cells, and 7 antigen expression patterns. This study demonstrated a predominance of differentiated luminal cell types in canine prostatic tumors, although the role of basal cells in prostate carcinogenesis should also be considered.

Treatment-related adverse events were correlated with the corresponding QoL scores. Uni- and multivariate analyses were applied.  Results:   From January 2008 to June 2011, a total of 2659 patients were included.

Materials and methods:   Patients undergoing mp-MRI and FB of target lesions identified on mp-MRI between August 2007 and August 2014 were reviewed. Patients meeting AS criteria (Clinical stage T1c, Gleason grade ≤ 6, prostate-specific antigen density ≤ 0.15, tumor involving ≤ 2 cores, and ≤ 50% involvement of any single core) based on extended sextant 12-core TRUS biopsy (systematic biopsy [SB]) were included. They were followed with subsequent 12-core biopsy as well as mp-MRI and MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy at follow-up visits until Gleason score progression (Gleason ≥ 7 in either 12-core or MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy). We evaluated whether progression seen on mp-MRI (defined as an increase in suspicion level, largest lesion diameter, or number of lesions) was predictive of Gleason score progression.  Results:   Of 152 patients meeting AS criteria on initial SB (mean age of 61.4 years and mean prostate-specific antigen level of 5.26 ng/ml), 34 (22.4%) had Gleason score ≥ 7 on confirmatory SB/FB. Of the 118 remaining patients, 58 chose AS and had at least 1 subsequent mp-MRI with SB/FB (median follow-up = 16.1 months). Gleason progression was subsequently documented in 17 (29%) of these men, in all cases to Gleason 3+4. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of mp-MRI for Gleason progression was 53% (95% CI: 28%-77%) and 80% (95% CI: 65%-91%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of mp-MRI for increase in Gleason were also 53% and 80%, respectively. The number needed to biopsy to detect 1 Gleason progression was 8.74 for SB vs. 2.9 for FB.  Conclusions:   Stable findings on mp-MRI are associated with Gleason score stability. mp-MRI appears promising as a useful aid for reducing the number of biopsies in the management of patients on AS.

The parametric maps were generated by software which extracts perfusion parameters that differentiate benign from malignant tissue from DCE-US recordings. We performed a stringent analysis (all tumours) and a clinical analysis (clinically significant tumours). We calculated the potential reduction in biopsies (benign on imaging) and the resultant missed positive biopsies (false-negatives). Additionally, we evaluated the performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) on a per-prostate level.  Results:   Based on DCE-US, 470/651 (72.2%) of biopsy locations appeared benign, resulting in 40 false-negatives (8.5%), considering clinically significant tumours only. Including parametric maps, 411/651 (63.1%) of the biopsy locations appeared benign, resulting in 23 false-negatives (5.6%). In the per-prostate clinical analysis, DCE-US classified 38/82 prostates as benign, missing eight diagnoses. Including parametric maps, 31/82 prostates appeared benign, missing three diagnoses. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 73, 58, 50 and 79%, respectively, for DCE-US alone and 91, 56, 57 and 90%, respectively, with parametric maps.  Conclusion:   The interpretation of DCE-US with parametric maps allows good prediction of biopsy outcome. A two-thirds reduction in biopsy cores seems feasible with only a modest decrease in cancer diagnosis.""","""['Arnoud W Postema', 'Peter J A Frinking', 'Martijn Smeenge', 'Theo M De Reijke', 'Jean J M C H De la Rosette', 'Francois Tranquart', 'Hessel Wijkstra']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['3-D Quantitative Dynamic Contrast Ultrasound for Prostate Cancer Localization.', 'Association of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging parameters with histological findings from MRI/ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy.', 'Histology core-specific evaluation of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) standardised scoring system of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate.', 'Conventional transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.

Several enzymes responsible for androgen biosynthesis have been shown to be overexpressed in CRPC, thus contributing to CRPC in a castrated environment. The TMPRSS2-ERG transcription factor has been shown to be present in primary prostate cancer tumors as well as CRPC tumors. We hypothesize that TMPRSS2-ERG fusions regulate androgen biosynthetic enzyme (ABE) gene expression and the production of androgens, which contributes to the development of CRPC.  Experimental design:   We used a panel of assays, including lentivirus transduction, gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric quantitation, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and bioinformatics analysis of gene microarray databases, to determine ERG regulation of androgen synthesis.  Results:   We found that ERG regulated the expression of the ABE AKR1C3 in prostate cancer cells via direct binding to the AKR1C3 gene. Knockdown of ERG resulted in reduced AKR1C3 expression, which caused a reduction in both DHT synthesis and PSA expression in VCaP prostate cancer cells treated with 5α-androstanedione (5α-Adione), a DHT precursor metabolite. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that ERG was coexpressed with AKR1C3 in prostate cancer tissue samples.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that AKR1C3 catalyzes the biochemical reduction of 5α-Adione to DHT in prostate cancer cells, and that ERG regulates this step through upregulation of AKR1C3 expression. Elucidation of ERG regulation of ABEs in CRPC may help to stratify TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer patients in the clinic for anti-androgen receptor-driven therapies; and AKR1C3 may serve as a valuable therapeutic target in the treatment of CRPC.""","""['Katelyn Powell', 'Louie Semaan', 'M Katie Conley-LaComb', 'Irfan Asangani', 'Yi-Mi Wu', 'Kevin B Ginsburg', 'Julia Williams', 'Jeremy A Squire', 'Krishna R Maddipati', 'Michael L Cher', 'Sreenivasa R Chinni']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: ERG fusion and AKR1C3 form AR signalling feed-forward loop.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG fusions confer efficacy of enzalutamide in an in vivo bone tumor growth model.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'Nuclear receptor ERRα and transcription factor ERG form a reciprocal loop in the regulation of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Emerging biological observations in prostate cancer.', 'Novel inhibition of AKR1C3 and androgen receptor axis by PTUPB synergizes enzalutamide treatment in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Computational modeling studies reveal the origin of the binding preference of 3-(3,4-di hydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-ylsulfonyl)benzoic acids for AKR1C3 over its isoforms.', 'Plasma Exosomal AKR1C3 mRNA Expression Is a Predictive and Prognostic Biomarker in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The In-Vitro Antitumor Effects of AST-3424 Monotherapy and Combination Therapy With Oxaliplatin or 5-Fluorouracil in Primary Liver Cancer.', 'Intracrine androgen biosynthesis and drug resistance.']"""

Antigen levels of suPAR differed between healthy controls and PCa or BPH patients, whereas miR-375 levels differed between PCa and BPH patients or healthy controls (p < 0.001).

A high concentration of suPAR was associated with a poor disease-specific survival (DSS; p = 0.039). The combination of suPAR and miR-375 levels identified a patient group possessing high levels for both parameters.

Resurgent androgen receptor activity is an established driver of castration-resistant progression, and upregulation of androgen receptor expression has been implicated to contribute to the resurgent androgen receptor activity. We reported previously that methylselenocysteine can decrease the expression and activity of androgen receptor. Here we investigated the ability of methylselenocysteine to inhibit castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer.  Methods:   The regrowth of LNCaP prostate cancer xenografts after castration was monitored. The levels of prostate-specific antigen in mouse serum were measured by ELISA. Tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed via Ki-67 immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay, respectively. Intratumoral angiogenesis was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining of vascular endothelial growth factor and CD31.  Results:   We showed that methylselenocysteine delayed castration-resistant regrowth of LNCaP xenograft tumors after androgen deprivation. This was accompanied by decreased serum levels of prostate-specific antigen, inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis, as well as downregulation of androgen receptor and induction of apoptosis in the relapsed tumors.  Conclusions:   The present study represents the first to show the preclinical efficacy of methylselenocysteine in delaying castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer.

A total of 148 patients were analyzed: 16 aggressive PCa, 83 non-aggressive PCa, 25 BPH and 24 chronic inflammatory diseases. Real-time RT-PCR, DNA sequencing, and bisulfite conversion of DNA, were applied.

No somatic mutations were detected in the AR gene and all patients showed normal KLF6-IVS1-27G > A genotype. The TMPRSS2-ERG positive status correlates with moderate to poorly differentiated prostate tumors and it is considered as unfavorable disease predictor. Positive GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation seems to be highly specific and the earliest epigenetic change in the prostate gland, which indicates the beginning of the pathological process. The appearance of positive molecular markers in blood was considered as a predictor of PCa dissemination. GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation was found as the earliest and a long-lasting epigenetic marker in blood samples of PCa patients, which makes it suitable as a marker for treatment follow-up.

Also, GBA significantly increased the number of Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells and sub G1 population in H460 cells. Western blotting revealed that GBA cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), activated Bax and caspase 9, attenuated the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) in H460 cells. However, interestingly, overexpression of Mcl-1 blocked the ability of GBA to exert cytotoxicity, activate caspase9 and Bax, cleave PARP, and increase sub G1 accumulation in H460 cells. Overall, these findings suggest that GBA induces apoptosis in H460 cells via caspase activation and Mcl-1 inhibition in H460 cells as a potent anticancer agent for NSCLC treatment.""","""['Bum-Seok Oh', 'Eun Ah Shin', 'Ji Hoon Jung', 'Deok-Beom Jung', 'Bonglee Kim', 'Bum Sang Shim', 'Mahsa Chitsazian Yazdi', 'Mehrdad Iranshahi', 'Sung-Hoon Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phytother Res""","""['Galbanic acid potentiates TRAIL induced apoptosis in resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells via inhibition of MDR1 and activation of caspases and DR5.', 'Auraptene Induces Apoptosis via Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1-Mediated Activation of Caspases in PC3 and DU145 Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Inhibition of Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 and Activation of Caspases Are Critically Involved in Gallotannin-induced Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'c-Jun N-terminal Kinase-Dependent Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Pathway is Critically Involved in Arjunic Acid Induced Apoptosis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Inhibition of protein kinase C α/βII and activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mediate glycyrrhetinic acid induced apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H460 cells.', 'Acute oral toxicity assessment of galbanic acid in albino rat according to OECD 425 TG.', 'Application of the Mannich reaction in the structural modification of natural products.', 'Anticancer potential of Ferula assa-foetida and its constituents, a powerful plant for cancer therapy.', 'Targeted delivery of galbanic acid to colon cancer cells by PLGA nanoparticles incorporated into human mesenchymal stem cells.', 'Emerging uses of PLA-PEG copolymer in cancer drug delivery.']"""

Methods:   The SAKK 08/09 trial included 44 patients with CRPC to receive single-agent metformin 1000 mg two times a day until disease progression or unwanted toxicity. Drug pathway-associated gene polymorphisms of OCT1 (rs622342) and MATE1 (rs2289669) were assessed. The primary objective of this study was to define the relationship between mutations in OCT1, MATE1 and progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 weeks absolute PFS and PSA response in consenting patients of SAKK 08/09. The secondary objective of this study was to analyze the association between mutations in OCT1, MATE1, metformin-related toxicity, PSA response at 12 weeks and overall survival.  Results:   Thirty-six patients were evaluable for pharmacogenetic analysis. Homozygous carriers of the polymorphic OCT1 C-allele had no metformin-related toxicity as compared with 41.9% for any metformin-related toxicity in carriers of at least one wild-type A-allele (P=0.07). Disease progression according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) was significantly more frequent in homozygous carriers of the polymorphic OCT1 C-allele (80%) as compared with carriers of at least one wild-type A-allele (28.6%) (P=0.002). Disease progression according to RECIST was also more frequent in carriers of at least one polymorphic MATE1 A-allele (44%) as compared with homozygous carriers of the wild-type G-allele (12.5%) (P=0.07). OCT1 and MATE1 were not associated with PFS.  Conclusions:   The polymorphic OCT1 C-allele has been shown to be associated with less metformin-related toxicity and a higher risk of tumor progression in patients with CRPC receiving metformin as an anticancer treatment. Polymorphisms in metformin drug transporters are attractive molecular markers to serve as potential predictors of efficacy in future clinical studies.""","""['M Joerger', 'R H N van Schaik', 'M L Becker', 'S Hayoz', 'M Pollak', 'R Cathomas', 'R Winterhalder', 'S Gillessen', 'C Rothermundt']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Association of genetic variation in the organic cation transporters OCT1, OCT2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 transporter protein genes with the gastrointestinal side effects and lower BMI in metformin-treated type 2 diabetes patients.', 'Interaction between polymorphisms in the OCT1 and MATE1 transporter and metformin response.', 'Double-transfected MDCK cells expressing human OCT1/MATE1 or OCT2/MATE1: determinants of uptake and transcellular translocation of organic cations.', 'Polyspecific organic cation transporters and their impact on drug intracellular levels and pharmacodynamics.', 'Clinical pharmacokinetics of metformin.', 'Solute Carrier Transportome in Chemotherapy-Induced Adverse Drug Reactions.', 'Pharmacogenetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the route toward tailored medicine.', 'Metformin pharmacogenomics: a genome-wide association study to identify genetic and epigenetic biomarkers involved in metformin anticancer response using human lymphoblastoid cell lines.', 'Obesity and Cancer Mechanisms: Cancer Metabolism.', 'The expanding role of metformin in cancer: an update on antitumor mechanisms and clinical development.']"""

Our previous studies of the effects of this course at one and six months of follow-up showed no positive effect on distress. We investigated long-term effects at 12 months of follow-up and whether subgroups with fewer psychosocial resources received more benefit from the intervention than patients with better resources.  Material and methods:   In two Danish counties, 507 patients with breast, prostate, colon or rectum cancer diagnosed within the past two years who had completed primary treatment were randomised to a six-day, multidimensional residential rehabilitation course or to standard care. Of these, 208 patients received the allocated intervention and 244 received the allocated control condition and were included in the analyses. Patients in both groups completed questionnaires at baseline and at one, six and 12 months of follow-up, including the 'Profile of Mood States short form', the 'General Self-efficacy' scale and a question on emotional support. At 12 months of follow-up, 179 participants in the intervention group and 195 in the control group provided data.  Results:   No effect of the intervention was found on distress at 12 months of follow-up, even in subgroups with fewer psychosocial resources at baseline, i.e. greater baseline distress, poorer self-efficacy and less emotional support.

In recent studies, the presence of receptors for pituitary-type growth hormone-releasing hormone (pGHRH-R) has been demonstrated in various human cancers, including human prostate, brain, and other cancer lines. Thyroid malignancies, however, have not yet been investigated in this regard. In this study, we found that pGHRH-R and its functional splice variant, SV1, are present in normal thyroid and PTC cells. We also treated seven normal and PTC tumor thyroid cells in vitro with a GHRH antagonist, MIA-602, to compare its anti-proliferation and anti-invasion potential against vehicle-treated cells. We found that treatment with GHRH antagonist increases the expression of SV1 and pGHRH-R in tumor cells compared to tumor cells exposed to vehicle only, a response which may alter the sensitivity of signaling kinases within the cells. GHRH antagonist treatment of tumor cells also reduced activity of the tumor invasion marker, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, compared to tumor cells exposed to vehicle only. The expression of pGHRH-R and SV1, as well as MMP-2 activity, in normal thyroid cells remained unaffected by GHRH antagonist treatment. Similarly, cell proliferation rates for tumor or normal thyroid cells were not affected by GHRH antagonist treatment. Our findings have important implications for the therapeutic use of GHRH antagonist in cases of aggressive PTC refractory to conventional treatment modalities, and in which protein expression and MMP-2 activity in normal thyroid tissue is left unaltered.""","""['Paola Catanuto', 'Jun Tashiro', 'Ferenc G Rick', 'Patricia Sanchez', 'Carmen C Solorzano', 'Marilyn K Glassberg', 'Norman L Block', 'John I Lew', 'Sharon J Elliot', 'Andrew V Schally']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['The effect of a novel antagonist of growth hormone releasing hormone on cell proliferation and on the key cell signaling pathways in nine different breast cancer cell lines.', 'Agonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) inhibit human experimental cancers in vivo by down-regulating receptors for GHRH.', 'The expression of the pituitary growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor and its splice variants in normal and neoplastic human tissues.', 'Endocrine and antineoplastic actions of growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonists.', 'Antagonists of growth-hormone-releasing hormone: an emerging new therapy for cancer.', 'Inhibitory Effects of Antagonists of Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH) in Thyroid Cancer.', 'Growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonist inhibits the invasiveness of human endometrial cancer cells by down-regulating twist and N-cadherin expression.']"""

Here, our data demonstrated that β-arrestin2 contributes to the cell viability and proliferation of CRPC via the downregulation of FOXO1 activity and expression. Mechanistically, in addition to its requirement for FOXO1 phosphorylation induced by IGF-1, β-arrestin2 could inhibit FOXO1 activity in an Akt-independent manner and delay FOXO1 dephosphorylation through the inhibition of PP2A phosphatase activity and the attenuation of the interaction between FOXO1 and PP2A. Furthermore, β-arrestin2 could downregulate FOXO1 expression via ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Together, our results identified a novel role for β-arrestin2 in the modulation of the CRPC progress through FOXO1.

Methods and materials:   The radiosensitivity parameters of CSCs and DCCs for cancer cell lines including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, osteosarcoma, and prostate, cervical, and breast cancer were determined by performing robust least-square fitting using the DLQ model on published clonogenic survival data. Fitting performance was compared with the single-compartment LQ (SLQ) and universal survival curve models. The fitting results were then used in an ordinary differential equation describing the kinetics of DCCs and CSCs in response to 2- to 14.3-Gy fractionated treatments. The total dose to achieve tumor control and the fraction size that achieved the least normal biological equivalent dose were calculated.  Results:   Smaller cell survival fitting errors were observed using DLQ, with the exception of melanoma, which had a low α/β = 0.16 in SLQ. Ordinary differential equation simulation indicated lower normal tissue biological equivalent dose to achieve the same tumor control with a hypofractionated approach for 4 cell lines for the DLQ model, in contrast to SLQ, which favored 2 Gy per fraction for all cells except melanoma. The DLQ model indicated greater tumor radioresistance than SLQ, but the radioresistance was overcome by hypofractionation, other than the GBM cells, which responded poorly to all fractionations.  Conclusion:   The distinct radiosensitivity and dynamics between CSCs and DCCs in radiation therapy response could perhaps be one possible explanation for the heterogeneous intertumor response to hypofractionation and in some cases superior outcome from stereotactic ablative radiation therapy. The DLQ model also predicted the remarkable GBM radioresistance, a result that is highly consistent with clinical observations. The radioresistance putatively stemmed from accelerated DCC regrowth that rapidly restored compartmental equilibrium between CSCs and DCCs.""","""['Victoria Y Yu', 'Dan Nguyen', 'Frank Pajonk', 'Patrick Kupelian', 'Tania Kaprealian', 'Michael Selch', 'Daniel A Low', 'Ke Sheng']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Treating Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) with super hyperfractionated radiation therapy: Implication of temporal dose fractionation optimization including cancer stem cell dynamics.', 'Radioresistance of the breast tumor is highly correlated to its level of cancer stem cell and its clinical implication for breast irradiation.', 'Analysis of the high-dose-range radioresistance of prostate cancer cells, including cancer stem cells, based on a stochastic model.', 'Can drugs enhance hypofractionated radiotherapy?

Methods and materials:   Four to seven kilovoltage cone-beam CTs (CBCTs) from 12 patients with high-risk prostate cancer were analyzed, allowing approximation of an SBRT regimen. The nodal clinical target volume (CTV(N)) and bladder were contoured on all kilovoltage CBCTs. The V100 CTV(N), expressed as a ratio to the same parameter on the initial plan, and the magnitude of translational shift between RR to the IPMs versus RR to the pelvic bones, were computed. The ability of a multimodality bladder filling protocol to minimize bladder height variation was assessed in a separate cohort of 4 patients.  Results:   Sixty-five CBCTs were assessed. The average V100 CTV(N) was 92.6%, but for a subset of 3 patients the average was 80.0%, compared with 97.8% for the others (P<.0001). The average overall and superior-inferior axis magnitudes of the bony-to-fiducial translations were significantly larger in the subgroup with suboptimal nodal coverage (8.1 vs 3.9 mm and 5.8 vs 2.4 mm, respectively; P<.0001). Relative bladder height changes were also significantly larger in the subgroup with suboptimal nodal coverage (42.9% vs 18.5%; P<.05). Use of a multimodality bladder-filling protocol minimized bladder height variation (P<.001).  Conclusion:   A majority of patients had acceptable nodal coverage after RR to IPMs, even when approximating SBRT. However, a subset of patients had suboptimal nodal coverage. These patients had large bony-to-fiducial translations and large variations in bladder height. Nodal coverage should be excellent if the superior-inferior axis bony-to-fiducial translation and the relative bladder height change (both easily measured on CBCT) are kept to a minimum.

This study was designed to evaluate the genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and sexual adverse events associated with postprostatectomy radiation therapy and to assess the influence of radiation timing on the risk of adverse events.  Methods:   The Regione Emilia-Romagna Italian Longitudinal Health Care Utilization Database was queried to identify a cohort of men who received radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer during 2003 to 2009, including patients who received postprostatectomy radiation therapy. Patients with prior radiation therapy were excluded. Outcome measures were genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and sexual adverse events after prostatectomy. Rates of adverse events were compared between the cohorts who did and did not receive postoperative radiation therapy. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were developed for each class of adverse events, including models with radiation therapy as a time-varying covariate.  Results:   A total of 9876 men were included in the analyses: 2176 (22%) who received radiation therapy and 7700 (78%) treated with prostatectomy alone. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, the additional exposure to radiation therapy after prostatectomy was associated with increased rates of gastrointestinal (rate ratio [RR] 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-2.27; P<.001) and urinary nonincontinence events (RR 1.83; 95% CI 1.83-2.80; P<.001) but not urinary incontinence events or erectile dysfunction. The addition of the time from prostatectomy to radiation therapy interaction term was not significant for any of the adverse event outcomes (P>.1 for all outcomes).  Conclusion:   Radiation therapy after prostatectomy is associated with an increase in gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse events.

Methods and materials:   A prospective database was maintained with clinical, dosimetric, and outcome data for all LDR-PB implantation procedures performed at our institution. From 1998 to 2008, 2223 patients with prostate cancer received LDR-PB without supplemental external beam radiation therapy. Patients who developed Phoenix-defined biochemical failure were reviewed for sites of relapse and investigations completed.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 5 years, 108 of 2223 patients (4.8%) developed biochemical relapse. In 1 additional patient, local relapse was found on transurethral prostate resection, but his prostate-specific antigen concentration was well short of triggering Phoenix-defined failure. Of the 109 patients with disease relapse, 18 of 2223 (0.8%) had a proven local recurrence, and 30 of 2223 (1.3%) had a proven distant recurrence. The remaining 61 of 2223 patients (2.7%) had unidentified sites of recurrence; of these, 57 patients (93%) had digital rectal examinations (DREs), 18 (30%) had post-treatment biopsies, 45 (74%) had bone scans, and 34 (56%) had computed tomography imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. If every biochemical failure were local, the local recurrence rate would be as high as 4.9%; however, by excluding those with proven distant failure and those with both a negative DRE and biopsy, we estimate that the local recurrence rate is 2.7% or less.

The purpose of this study was to compare dose distributions to organs at risk and acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity levels of patients treated to 78 Gy with either IG-IMRT or 3D-CRT.  Methods and materials:   Patients treated with 3D-CRT (n=215) and IG-IMRT (n=260) receiving 78 Gy in 39 fractions within 2 randomized trials were selected. Dose surface histograms of anorectum, anal canal, and bladder were calculated. Identical toxicity questionnaires were distributed at baseline, prior to fraction 20 and 30 and at 90 days after treatment. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade ≥1, ≥2, and ≥3 endpoints were derived directly from questionnaires. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were applied.  Results:   The median volumes receiving 5 to 75 Gy were significantly lower (all P<.001) with IG-IMRT for anorectum, anal canal, and bladder. The mean dose to the anorectum was 34.4 Gy versus 47.3 Gy (P<.001), 23.6 Gy versus 44.6 Gy for the anal canal (P<.001), and 33.1 Gy versus 43.2 Gy for the bladder (P<.001). Significantly lower grade ≥2 toxicity was observed for proctitis, stool frequency ≥6/day, and urinary frequency ≥12/day. IG-IMRT resulted in significantly lower overall RTOG grade ≥2 GI toxicity (29% vs 49%, respectively, P=.002) and overall GU grade ≥2 toxicity (38% vs 48%, respectively, P=.009).

Herein, we report the pharmacokinetics, dosimetry and toxicity analysis of 177Lu-EDTMP in patients (phase-0/I study). In a phase-0 study, the biokinetics of skeletal and non-skeletal uptake of 177Lu-EDTMP was assessed in 6 patients with metastatic prostate cancer using tracer doses (172.7-206.9MBq). Data of whole skeletal uptake, blood and fractionated urine samples were obtained and dosimetric calculations were performed using the OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software. Prolonged bone retention was observed in all patients. Excretion was mainly via the renal route and blood clearance was rapid and biphasic. Mean estimated red marrow dose was 0.80±0.15mGy/MBq while mean total-body dose was 0.16±0.04mGy/MBq. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2000-3250MBqfor 177Lu-EDTMP was calculated. For the phase-I study, 21 patients with metastatic prostate cancer were given a therapeutic dose of 177Lu- EDTMP (692-5550MBq). Toxiciy (WHO), evaluated by assessment of hemoglobin levels, platelet and leukocyte counts over 12 weeks, was mainly limited to anemia or thrombocytopenia. Only transient toxicity was observed in 14/21 patients, of which 6 had baseline toxicity. Beyond the MTD, a significantly higher number of patients displayed grade 3-4 toxicity. Pain relief, assessed by VAS pain score, was observed in 86% patients with median relief duration of 7 weeks. The results demonstrate that 177Lu-EDTMP has excellent pharmacokinetic and dosimetric properties, besides being safe and effective. Along with estimating radiation dose values to certain critical organs, we have also proposed an MTD for 177Lu-EDTMP that correlated well with toxicity data.

Another natural source of this compound is a shrub Sophora flavescens, used in traditional Chinese medicine. Main dietary source of IXN is beer, and the compound is produced from XN during wort boiling. In the human body, the compound is O-demethylated to 8PN, the strongest known phytoestrogen. This process takes place in the liver and in the intestine, where it is mediated by local microflora. It has been reported in some studies that even though beer contains small amounts of hops and its preparations, these compounds may affect the functioning of the human body. IXN exhibits an antiproliferative activity against human cell lines typical for breast cancer (MCF-7), ovarian cancer (A-2780), prostate cancer (DU145 and PC-3), and colon cancer (HT-29 and SW620) cells. It strongly inhibits the activation of the following carcinogens: 2-amino-3-methylimidazol-[4,5-f]quinoline and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) via human cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2). It also inhibits the production of prostate specific antigen (PSA). IXN significantly reduces the expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the case of invasive breast cancer MDA-MB-231. It interferes with JAK/STAT signaling pathway and inhibits the expression of pro1inflammatory genes in the monoblastic leukemia cell line (MonoMac6). It activates apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs).

We demonstrate that NP HDACIs are potent radiosensitizers in vitro and are more effective as radiosensitizers than small molecule HDACIs in vivo using mouse xenograft models of colorectal and prostate carcinomas. We found that NP HDACIs enhance the response of tumor cells to radiation through the prolongation of γ-H2AX foci. Our work illustrates an effective method for improving cancer radiotherapy treatment.""","""['Edina C Wang', 'Yuanzeng Min', 'Robert C Palm', 'James J Fiordalisi', 'Kyle T Wagner', 'Nabeel Hyder', 'Adrienne D Cox', 'Joseph M Caster', 'Xi Tian', 'Andrew Z Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Analysis of the genomic response of human prostate cancer cells to histone deacetylase inhibitors.', 'Sustained inhibition of deacetylases is required for the antitumor activity of the histone deactylase inhibitors panobinostat and vorinostat in models of colorectal cancer.', 'Mass spectrometry and DigiWest technology emphasize protein acetylation profile from Quisinostat-treated HuT78 CTCL cell line.', 'HDAC inhibitors: a new radiosensitizer for non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Regulation of apoptosis-associated genes by histone deacetylase inhibitors: implications in cancer therapy.', 'Application of nanomedicine in radiotherapy sensitization.', 'Emerging Epigenetic-Based Nanotechnology for Cancer Therapy: Modulating the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'HDAC Inhibitors: Innovative Strategies for Their Design and Applications.', 'Nanomedicine Strategies for Management of Drug Resistance in Lung Cancer.', 'Nano-Assembly of Quisinostat and Biodegradable Macromolecular Carrier Results in Supramolecular Complexes with Slow-Release Capabilities.']"""

Materials and methods:   We compared ""Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results"" data (USA) with data from four German federal epidemiological cancer registries, both from 2004 to 2011. We excluded metastatic disease and patients aged ⩾80 years. Thereof, we identified 132,506 (USA) and 54,159 (Germany) patients with low-risk according to the 2014 EAU guidelines. We tested treatment trends for statistical significance with a linear regression model.  Results:   Active treatment was radical prostatectomy (RP) in 36.1% vs. 66.2% and radiotherapy (RT) in 38.4% vs. 11.8%. No active treatment (NAT) was reported in 24.2% vs. 16.2% (p<0.001 each). Through the study period the use of RP decreased from 37.1% to 34.2% in the USA (p=0.04) and was constant at a mean of 66.2% in Germany (p=0.8). The use of RT in the USA decreased from 42.8% to 31.8% (p<0.001), while it was stable in Germany (p=0.09). The NAT group grew from 18.0% to 33.2% in the USA (p<0.001), while it was stable in Germany until 2009 (p=0.3). From 2009 to 2011 there also was an increase of the NAT group in Germany from 15.2% to 19.4% (p=0.001).  Conclusion:   In contrast to former evidence we found the relative use of RT for low-risk prostate cancer much higher in the USA compared to Germany. The implementation of integrated prostate cancer centers in the USA might explain this observation. Deferred and defensive treatment strategies showed a steady increase in the USA. This development seems delayed in Germany by several years.""","""['Benjamin Hager', 'Klaus Kraywinkel', 'Bastian Keck', 'Alexander Katalinic', 'Martin Meyer', 'Sylke Ruth Zeissig', 'Roland Stabenow', 'Michael Froehner', 'Johannes Huber']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Increasing use of radical prostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer in the USA and Germany: a comparative population-based study.', 'Comparison of prostate cancer survival in Germany and the USA: can differences be attributed to differences in stage distributions?', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'The Role of Radical Prostatectomy and Radiotherapy in Treatment of Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Localized intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Long-term evaluation of low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy in localized prostate cancer.', 'Acquired resistance to irradiation or docetaxel is not associated with cross-resistance to cisplatin in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Trends in uro-oncological surgery in Germany-comparative analyses from population-based data.', 'Development of Incidence and Surgical Treatment of Penile Cancer in Germany from 2006 to 2016: Potential Implications for Future Management.', 'Effect of Radiotherapy in Addition to Surgery in Early Stage Endometrial Cancer: A Population-Based Study.']"""

Prostate cancer, the most frequent cancer among U.S. men, is most often treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, its complications in total may represent significant costs to hospitals and providers if not reimbursed. We evaluated the potential effect of these unreimbursed HACs following RP on clinical outcomes and costs.  Methods and materials:   Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we selected a weighed, national, estimated sample of 451,707 men with prostate cancer who underwent RP between 2002 and 2009. Baseline sociodemographic and hospital characteristics are described. We calculated estimated frequencies and costs of HACs and the predictors of in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay, and increased total hospital costs.  Results:   Overall, HACs were infrequent at 0.08%, with pressure ulcer development (0.02%) and foreign object retained at surgery (0.02%) being the most common. HAC occurrence was not affected by hospital teaching status or surgical volume, but larger hospital size was related to more HACs. Those experiencing an HAC were much more likely to have a prolonged length of stay (odds ratio = 6.68, 95% CI: 5.34-8.36) and increased hospital costs (odds ratio = 5.03, 95% CI: 4.05-6.24). HACs after RP cost an estimated nearly $1 million annually in the United States.  Conclusion:   In a robust sample of patients who underwent RP in the United States, HACs were very uncommon and contributed approximately $1 million in additional expenditures. As the U.S. government continues to expand quality improvement programs and develop incentives to avoid complications, efforts to monitor unnecessary complications should continue as well.""","""['Christopher M Deibert', 'Max Kates', 'James M McKiernan', 'Benjamin A Spencer']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Evaluation of Effect of Weekend Admission on the Prevalence of Hospital-Acquired Conditions in Patients Receiving Cervical Fusions.', 'The impact of patient age and comorbidities on the occurrence of ""never events"" in cerebrovascular surgery: an analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample.', 'Incidence, cost, and mortality associated with hospital-acquired conditions after resection of cranial neoplasms.', 'Radical prostatectomy: a systematic review of the impact of hospital and surgeon volume on patient outcome.', 'Making care better in the pediatric intensive care unit.', ""Identifying a list of healthcare 'never events' to effect system change: a systematic review and narrative synthesis."", 'Perception Is Reality: quality metrics in pancreas surgery - a Central Pancreas Consortium (CPC) analysis of 1399 patients.', 'Impact of processes of care aimed at complication reduction on the cost of complex cancer surgery.']"""

Objective:   To compare patient-reported urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction 12 mo after RALP or RRP.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective, controlled, nonrandomised trial of patients undergoing prostatectomy in 14 centres using RALP or RRP. Clinical-record forms and validated patient questionnaires at baseline and 12 mo after surgery were collected.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with logistic regression and adjusted for possible confounders. The primary end point was urinary incontinence (change of pad less than once in 24h vs one time or more per 24h) at 12 mo. Secondary end points were erectile dysfunction at 12 mo and positive surgical margins.  Results and limitations:   At 12 mo after RALP, 366 men (21.3%) were incontinent, as were 144 (20.2%) after RRP. The unadjusted OR was 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87–1.34). Erectile dysfunction was observed in 1200 men (70.4%) 12 mo after RALP and 531 (74.7%) after RRP. The unadjusted OR was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.66–0.98).  Conclusions:   In a Swedish setting, RALP for prostate cancer was modestly beneficial in preserving erectile function compared with RRP, without a statistically significant difference regarding urinary incontinence or surgical margins.

Here, we identified an ETS(-) subtype of aggressive prostate cancer (ERG(-)MAP3K7(del)CHD1(del)) and used a novel developmental model and a cell line xenograft model to show that cosuppression of MAP3K7 and CHD1 expression promotes aggressive disease. Analyses of publicly available prostate cancer datasets revealed that MAP3K7 and CHD1 were significantly codeleted in 10% to 20% of localized tumors and combined loss correlated with poor disease-free survival. To evaluate the functional impact of dual MAP3K7-CHD1 loss, we suppressed Map3k7 and/or Chd1 expression in mouse prostate epithelial progenitor/stem cells (PrP/SC) and performed tissue recombination experiments in vivo. Dual shMap3k7-shChd1 PrP/SC recombinants displayed massive glandular atypia with regions of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma apparent. Combined Map3k7-Chd1 suppression greatly disrupted normal prostatic lineage differentiation; dual recombinants displayed significant androgen receptor loss, increased neuroendocrine differentiation, and increased neural differentiation. Clinical samples with dual MAP3K7-CHD1 loss also displayed neuroendocrine and neural characteristics. In addition, dual Map3k7-Chd1 suppression promoted E-cadherin loss and mucin production in recombinants. MAP3K7 and CHD1 protein loss also correlated with Gleason grade and E-cadherin loss in clinical samples. To further validate the phenotype observed in the PrP/SC model, we suppressed MAP3K7 and/or CHD1 expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Dual shMAP3K7-shCHD1 LNCaP xenografts displayed increased tumor growth and decreased survival compared with shControl, shMAP3K7, and shCHD1 xenografts.

The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has been proposed as an easily assessable marker of systemic inflammation and has been shown to represent a prognostic marker in different cancer entities. To evaluate the prognostic value of the PLR in prostate cancer, we performed the present study.  Methods and materials:   Data from 374 consecutive patients with prostate cancer, treated with 3D conformal radiotherapy from 1999 to 2007, were analyzed. Distant metastases-free survival (MFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), biochemical disease-free survival, and time to salvage systemic therapy were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to adjust for other covariates.  Results:   Using receiver operating characteristics analysis, the optimal cutoff level for the PLR was 190. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that PLR≥190 was a prognostic factor for decreased MFS (P = 0.004), CSS (P = 0.004), and OS (P = 0.024) whereas a significant association of an elevated PLR with biochemical disease-free survival (P = 0.740) and time to salvage systemic therapy (P = 0.063) was not detected. In multivariate analysis, an increased PLR remained a significant prognostic factor for poor MFS (HR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.06-4.76, P = 0.036), CSS (HR = 3.99, 95% CI: 1.19-13.4, P = 0.025), and OS (HR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.02-3.42, P = 0.044).

Methods:   From an initial detection of a set of seed candidates in CT images using a threshold and connected component method, the orientation of each individual seed is estimated by using the principal components analysis method. The main originality of this approach is the ability to classify the detected objects based on a priori intensity and volume information and to separate groups of closely spaced seeds using three competing clustering methods: the standard and a modified k-means method and a Gaussian mixture model with an expectation-maximization algorithm. Experiments were carried out on a series of CT images of two phantoms and patients. The fourteen patients correspond to a total of 1063 implanted seeds. Detections are compared to manual segmentation and to related work in terms of detection performance and calculation time.  Results:   This automatic method has proved to be accurate and fast including the ability to separate groups of seeds in a reliable way and to determine the orientation of each seed.

Fluorescence microscopy showed that a fluorescein-tagged Pt-TFO localizes in both the cytoplasm and nucleus when it is transfected into LAPC-4 cells, a human prostate cancer cell line, using Lipofectamine 2000. A capture assay employing streptavidin-coated magnetic beads followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used to demonstrate that 5'-biotin-conjugated Pt-TFOs cross-link in vitro to their four designated AR gene targets in genomic DNA extracted from LAPC-4 cells. Similarly, the capture assay was used to examine cross-linking between the 5'-biotin-conjugated Pt-TFOs and the AR gene in LAPC-4 cells in culture. Three of the four Pt-TFOs cross-linked to their designated target, suggesting that different regions of the AR gene are not uniformly accessible to Pt-TFO cross-linking. LAPC-4 cells were transfected with fluorescein-tagged Pt-TFO or a control oligonucleotide that does not bind or cross-link to AR DNA. The levels of AR mRNA in highly fluorescent cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting were determined by RT-qPCR, and the levels of AR protein were monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy. Decreases in mRNA and protein levels of 40 and 30%, respectively, were observed for fluorescein-tagged Pt-TFO versus control treated cells.

Seventy-three miRNAs and miRNA*s were significantly down-regulated while 10 were up-regulated in PCa tissues compared with matched histologically normal glands. Of these, miR-29b-1, miR-200a, miR-370, and miR-31, which were the most down/up-regulated and closely potentially target to the Dicer 3' UTR, were investigated further. Tissues of primary tumors and matched normal prostate glands from 185 patients with PCa were collected for further investigation. Dicer mRNA levels were negatively correlated with miR-29b-1 (ρs = -0.177, p = 0.017), miR-200a (ρs = -0.489, p < 0.0001) and miR-31 (ρs = -0.314, p < 0.0001) expression. Compared with adjacent normal glands, PCa tissues showed significantly lower miR-200a and miR-31 expression levels. Furthermore, in metastatic PCa, the expression levels of miR-200a, miR-370, and miR-31 were dramatically higher than in localized PCa. Additionally, elevated expression levels of miR-200a and miR-31 appeared to be associated with castration-resistant PCa.

Telomere shortening resulting from oxidation will ultimately induce cellular senescence. In this study, α-hemolysin (α-HL) nanopore technology was applied to detect and quantify OG in the human telomeric DNA sequence. This repeat sequence adopts a basket G-quadruplex in the NaCl electrolyte used for analysis that enters the α-HL channel, slowly unfolds, and translocates. The basket fold containing OG disrupts the structure, leading to >10× increase in the unfolding kinetics without yielding a detectable current pattern. Therefore, detection of OG with α-HL required labeling of OG with aminomethyl-[18-crown-6] using a mild oxidant. The labeled OG yielded a pulse-like signal in the current vs time trace when the DNA strand was electrophoretically passed through α-HL in NaCl electrolyte. However, the rate of translocation was too slow using NaCl salts, leading us to further refine the method. A mixture of NH4Cl and LiCl electrolytes induced the propeller fold that unravels quickly outside the α-HL channel. This electrolyte allowed observation of the labeled OG, while providing a faster recording of the currents. Lastly, OG distributions were probed with this method in a 120-mer stretch of the human telomere sequence exposed to the cellular oxidant (1)O2. Single-molecule profiles determined the OG distributions to be random in this context.

Such alterations include deregulated protein expression, as we have previously shown for the key transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR-1) and the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS). Here we add the two secreted factors macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1) and platelet derived growth factor A (PDGF-A) to the growing list of protein markers of prostate field cancerization. Expression of MIC-1 and PDGF-A was measured quantitatively by immunofluorescence and comprehensively analyzed using two methods of signal capture and several groupings of data generated in human cancerous (n = 25), histologically normal adjacent (n = 22), and disease-free (n = 6) prostate tissues. A total of 208 digitized images were analyzed. MIC-1 and PDGF-A expression in tumor tissues were elevated 7.1x to 23.4x and 1.7x to 3.7x compared to disease-free tissues, respectively (p<0.0001 to p = 0.08 and p<0.01 to p = 0.23, respectively). In support of field cancerization, MIC-1 and PDGF-A expression in adjacent tissues were elevated 7.4x to 38.4x and 1.4x to 2.7x, respectively (p<0.0001 to p<0.05 and p<0.05 to p = 0.51, respectively). Also, MIC-1 and PDGF-A expression were similar in tumor and adjacent tissues (0.3x to 1.0x; p<0.001 to p = 0.98 for MIC-1; 0.9x to 2.6x; p<0.01 to p = 1.00 for PDGF-A). All analyses indicated a high level of inter- and intra-tissue heterogeneity across all types of tissues (mean coefficient of variation of 86.0%). Our data shows that MIC-1 and PDGF-A expression is elevated in both prostate tumors and structurally intact adjacent tissues when compared to disease-free specimens, defining field cancerization. These secreted factors could promote tumorigenesis in histologically normal tissues and lead to tumor multifocality.

While these approaches have yielded critical information, alternative methods to network analysis will offer new perspectives on biological information. A little explored area is the interactions between domains that can be captured using domain co-occurrence networks (DCN). A DCN can be used to study the function and interaction of proteins by representing protein domains and their co-existence in genes and by mapping cancer mutations to the individual protein domains to identify signals.  Results:   The domain co-occurrence network was constructed for the human proteome based on PFAM domains in proteins. Highly connected domains in the central cores were identified using the k-core decomposition technique. Here we show that these domains were found to be more evolutionarily conserved than the peripheral domains. The somatic mutations for ovarian, breast and prostate cancer diseases were obtained from the TCGA database. We mapped the somatic mutations to the individual protein domains and the local false discovery rate was used to identify significantly mutated domains in each cancer type. Significantly mutated domains were found to be enriched in cancer disease pathways. However, we found that the inner cores of the DCN did not contain any of the significantly mutated domains. We observed that the inner core protein domains are highly conserved and these domains co-exist in large numbers with other protein domains.  Conclusion:   Mutations and domain co-occurrence networks provide a framework for understanding hierarchal designs in protein function from a network perspective. This study provides evidence that a majority of protein domains in the inner core of the DCN have a lower mutation frequency and that protein domains present in the peripheral regions of the k-core contribute more heavily to the disease.

The tumors considered are divided into two classes, that is, D (Deterministic) and R (Replicative). Stochastic factors presumably attributable to errors deriving from DNA replication are proposed to be at the basis of R-tumor frequency, leading to the conclusion that 'bad luck' is a primary determinant of certain types of cancer. The present Second Opinion highlights potential problems associated with the hypothesis of the study, as some of these also apply to kidney cancer. The aim is to point out that chance is not a major cause of cancer incidence because it is not substantiated by the data available through epidemiological evidence. In particular, we highlight that differences in tumor incidence associated with sex and geographic areas are not in line with the 'bad luck' hypothesis. Further aspects of tumor biology that do not entirely fit with the idea that stochastic events related to DNA replication of normal stem cells are the heterogeneity of the cancer cell phenotype and the heterogeneity of intra-organ localization, often observed in tumors originating from the same tissue. From a public health perspective, the points discussed here as well as the absence of data on prevalent tumors, like breast and prostate cancer, do not support the oversimplified message conveyed by the media that the majority of cancer cases cannot be prevented. © 2015 S.

In vitro studies have shown that cyclin D1 is overexpressed in Ewing's sarcoma (EWS)/peripheral Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor (pPNET), but not in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Only a few immunohistochemical studies are available on cyclin D1 expression in EWS/pPNET, which confirmed its expression only in a limited number of cases. The aim of the present study was a comparative immunohistochemical analysis of the expression and distribution of cyclin D1 in a large series of pediatric/adolescent soft tissue EWS/pPNETs and rhabdomyosarcomas (both embryonal and alveolar subtypes) to assess its potential usefulness in their differential diagnosis. Notably cyclin D1 was strongly and diffusely expressed in all cases (20/20) of EWS/pPNET, while it was lacked in all cases (15/15) of rhabdomyosarcomas. Immunohistochemical overexpression of cyclin D1 in EWS/pPNET is a novel finding which could be exploitable as a diagnostic immunomarker for this tumor. Although highly sensitive, cyclin D1 is not specific for EWS/pPNET, and thus it should not be evaluated alone but in the context of a wide immunohistochemical panel. Accordingly, we first emphasize that when pathologists are dealing with a small round blue cell tumor of soft tissues in pediatric/adolescent patients, a strong and diffuse nuclear expression of cyclin D1 is of complementary diagnostic value to CD99 and FLI-1 in confirming diagnosis of EWS/pPNET and in ruling out rhabdomyosarcoma.""","""['Gaetano Magro', 'Franca Brancato', 'Giuseppe Musumeci', 'Rita Alaggio', 'Rosalba Parenti', 'Lucia Salvatorelli']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Acta Histochem""","""['Diagnostic utility of cyclin D1 in the diagnosis of small round blue cell tumors in children and adolescents.', ""Cyclin D1 and Ewing's sarcoma/PNET: A microarray analysis."", ""Detection of EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript in Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors by one-step RT-PCR using paraffin-embedded tissues."", ""Congenital Ewing's Sarcoma/Peripheral Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor: A Case Report and Review of the Literature."", ""Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor/Ewing's sarcoma of the craniospinal vault: case reports and review."", 'Integrative analyses of bulk microarray data to discover genes, pathways, and immune infiltration characteristics associated with targeting of Ewing sarcoma.', 'Systematic multi-omics cell line profiling uncovers principles of Ewing sarcoma fusion oncogene-mediated gene regulation.', 'WT1 and Cyclin D1 Immunohistochemistry: A Useful Adjunct for Diagnosis of Pediatric Small Round Blue Cell Tumors on Small Biopsies.', 'Sarcoma as Second Cancer in a Childhood Cancer Survivor: Case Report, Large Population Analysis and Literature Review.', 'High Specificity of BCL11B and GLG1 for EWSR1-FLI1 and EWSR1-ERG Positive Ewing Sarcoma.']"""

The influence of hormone-therapy on lymphocytes properties and connection between the parameters studied with the effectiveness of treatment, which was estimated by the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA), have been investigated. It was discovered that the genome damage to the patients with prostate gland cancer lymphocytes does not differ from control. The increase of the ROS level and decrease of radiosensitivity (irradiation of isolated lymphocytes in vitro at a dose of 1 Gy) are observed but they are insignificant. The content of the cells expressing CD69 and CD95 markers doesn't change but the expression of proliferative activity marker Ki67 in cells decreases. Radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in patients with prostate gland cancer correlates with the CD95 markers expression--a higher radio sensitivity points to their predisposition to apoptotic death. The expression of the markers studied depends on the oxidative status--a high ROS level suppresses their expression. The hormone therapy applied before radiotherapy leads to the increase in radiosensitivity and decrease in ROS. As the MN test shows, the ability to adaptive response of the lymphocytes in patients with prostate gland cancer is increased as compared with lymphocytes of healthy donors but it is insignificant; moreover, hormones do not influence the ability to the adaptive response. The high oxidative status further the formation of the adaptive response.

A reduction of CDK2AP1 expression is considered to be a negative prognostic indicator in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma and also associated with increased invasion in human gastric cancer tissue. CDK2AP1 overexpression was shown to inhibit growth, reduce invasion and increase apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the effect of CDK2AP1 downregulation in primary human dermal fibroblasts. Using a short-hairpin RNA to reduce its expression, we found that knockdown of CDK2AP1 in primary human fibroblasts resulted in reduced proliferation and in the induction of senescence associated beta-galactosidase activity. CDK2AP1 knockdown also resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of cells in the S phase and an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Immunocytochemical analysis also revealed that the CDK2AP1 knockdown significantly increased the percentage of cells that exhibited γ-H2AX foci, which could indicate presence of DNA damage. CDK2AP1 knockdown also resulted in increased mRNA levels of p53, p21, BAX and PUMA and p53 protein levels. In primary human fibroblasts in which p53 and CDK2AP1 were simultaneously downregulated, there was: (a) no increase in senescence associated beta-galactosidase activity, (b) decrease in the number of cells in the G1-phase and increase in number of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle, and (c) decrease in the mRNA levels of p21, BAX and PUMA when compared with CDK2AP1 knockdown only fibroblasts. Taken together, this suggests that the observed phenotype is p53 dependent. We also observed a prominent increase in the levels of ARF protein in the CDK2AP1 knockdown cells, which suggests a possible role of ARF in p53 stabilization following CDK2AP1 knockdown. Altogether, our results show that knockdown of CDK2AP1 in primary human fibroblasts reduced proliferation and induced premature senescence, with the observed phenotype being p53 dependent.""","""['Khaled N Alsayegh', 'Venkat S Gadepalli', 'Shilpa Iyer', 'Raj R Rao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Knockdown of CDK2AP1 in human embryonic stem cells reduces the threshold of differentiation.', 'Systematic genetic dissection of p14ARF-mediated mitochondrial cell death signaling reveals a key role for p21CDKN1 and the BH3-only protein Puma/bbc3.', 'p53 efficiently suppresses tumor development in the complete absence of its cell-cycle inhibitory and proapoptotic effectors p21, Puma, and Noxa.', 'Roles of TP53 in determining therapeutic sensitivity, growth, cellular senescence, invasion and metastasis.', 'CARF is a multi-module regulator of cell proliferation and a molecular bridge between cellular senescence and carcinogenesis.', 'Involvement of Bcl-2 Family Proteins in Tetraploidization-Related Senescence.', 'ΔNp63α-mediated epigenetic regulation in keratinocyte senescence.', 'The Association between Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2 Associated Protein 1 (CDK2AP1) and Molecular Subtypes of Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic regulation in cell senescence.', 'Dinaciclib potently suppresses MCL-1 and selectively induces the cell death in human iPS cells without affecting the viability of cardiac tissue.']"""

A notable portion of Georgia's economy is rooted in agricultural production, and agricultural practices have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Statistical analyses considered county age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates as the outcome of interest and three agricultural variables (farmland as percent of county land, dollars spent per county acre on agriculture chemicals, and dollars spent per county acre on commercial fertilizers) as exposures of interest. Multivariate linear regression models analyzed for each separately.

Materials and methods:   A prospective study was performed in 232 men with a first round biopsy, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with a lesion, a Likert score of 2 or greater and prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml. All men underwent a standard 12-core protocol plus a protocol of 2 or 3 targeted cores. Significant prostate cancer was defined as at least 1 core with a Gleason score of 7 (3 + 4) or 6 with a greater than 4 mm maximal cancer core length.  Results:   Mean ± SD patient age was 64 ± 6.4 years, mean prostate specific antigen was 6.65 ± 1.8 ng/ml and mean prostate volume was 40 ± 24.3 ml. The overall detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer was 44%. The detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer by magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy was 77% for prostate glands less than 30 cm(3), and 61%, 47% and 34% for glands 30 to less than 38.5, 38.5 to less than 55 and 55 to 160 cm(3), respectively (p = 0.001). Differences in prostate cancer detection rates between the standard and targeted protocols were not significant for patients with a prostate volume of 40 cm(3) or less (p = 0.8). Conversely 12 patients with a prostate volume greater than 40 cm(3) had clinically significant prostate cancer using the targeted but not the standard protocol and in 3 prostate cancer was detected by the standard but not the targeted protocol (p = 0.04).

Methods:   Overall, 5637 patients treated with radical prostatectomy between January 1993 and August 2013 were identified. Multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the association between prostate volume and biochemical recurrence in the overall population and after stratifying patients according to the D'Amico risk groups.  Results:   Mean (median) prostate volume was 50.61 mL (46 mL). When patients were stratified according to D'Amico risk groups, mean (median) prostate volume was 51.7 mL (48 mL), 49.8 mL (45 mL) and 50.6 mL (46 mL) in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer, respectively (P = 0.04). Overall, the 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 87.9%. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, prostate volume was associated with a lower risk of biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.99-1.00), after accounting for disease characteristics. However, when patients were stratified according to D'Amico risk groups, prostate volume represented an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence only in individuals with intermediate-risk disease (hazard ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.99-1.00). Conversely, prostate volume was not associated with the risk of experiencing biochemical recurrence in patients with low- and high-risk disease.  Conclusions:   Smaller prostates are associated with increased risk of biochemical recurrence after surgery only in men with intermediate-risk disease. In this category, the preoperative assessment of prostate volume might be helpful in order to identify patients at higher risk of biochemical recurrence after surgery. Additionally, prostate volume might be used to individualize follow-up schedules after radical prostatectomy.""","""['Marco Moschini', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Vito Cucchiara', 'Rocco Damiano', 'Francesco Cantiello', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment to Importance of prostate volume in the stratification of patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', ""Reassessment of the risk factors for biochemical recurrence in D'Amico intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated using radical prostatectomy."", 'Ability of 2 pretreatment risk assessment methods to predict prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy: data from CaPSURE.', 'Improved risk stratification for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy using a novel risk group system based on prostate specific antigen density and biopsy Gleason score.', 'Long term biochemical recurrence free survival after radical prostatectomy for cancer: comparative analysis according to surgical approach and clinicopathological stage.', 'Impact of Prostate Size on the Outcomes of Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Functional and Oncological Outcomes Following Robot-Assisted and Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer With a Large Prostate Volume: A Retrospective Analysis With Minimum 2-Year Follow-Ups.', 'Addition of Prostate Volume and Prostate-specific Antigen Density to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Prostate Cancer Nomograms.', 'Possible clinical implications of prostate capsule thickness and glandular epithelial cell density in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the detection of prostate cancer prior to initial biopsy: comparison with cancer-predicting nomograms.']"""

Methods:   We assessed using ELISA, the surface expression of chromogranin proproteins on prostasomes and malignant extracellular vesicles of four different prostate cancer cell-lines, two hormone sensitive and two hormone refractory. We used a panel of chromogranin A and chromogranin B antibodies against peptides in-between hypothetical cleavage sites along the proproteins.  Results:   A diverging pattern of chromogranin peptides was apparent when comparing prostasomes and malignant extracellular vesicles indicating a phenotypical change. We also compared western blot patterns (prostasomes and malignant extracellular vesicles) for selected antibodies that displayed high absorbances in the ELISA. Western blot analyses revealed various cleavage patterns of those proproteins that were analyzed in prostasomes and extracellular vesicles.  Conclusion:   Chromogranins are constituents of not only prostasomes but also of malignant prostate cell-derived extracellular vesicles with different amino acid sequences exposed at the membrane surface giving rise to a mosaic pattern.

Risk factors considered included age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, previous cancer diagnoses, family history of cancer, relevant comorbidities and medication. Measures of calibration and discrimination in the validation cohort.  Outcomes:   Incident cases of blood, breast, bowel, gastro-oesophageal, lung, oral, ovarian, pancreas, prostate, renal tract and uterine cancers.

Setting:   Primary care practices in Australia including men's health clinics and rural practices with variable access to urology services.  Participants:   32 urban and rural GPs within Australia. We included GPs of varying ages, gender (11 female), clinical experience and patient populations. All GPs interested in participating in the study were included.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Data were analysed using grounded theory methods to determine how and why GPs provide (or do not provide) PSA testing to their asymptomatic male patients.  Results:   We observed patterned variation in GP practice, and identified four heuristics to describe GP preference for, and approaches to, PSA testing and overdiagnosis: (1) GPs who prioritised avoiding underdiagnosis, (2) GPs who weighed underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis case by case, (3) GPs who prioritised avoiding overdiagnosis and (4) GPs who did not engage with overdiagnosis at all. The heuristics guided GPs' Routine Practice (usual testing, communication and responses to patient request). The heuristics also reflected GPs' different Practice Rationales (drawing on experience, medicolegal obligations, guidelines and evidence) and produced different Practice Outcomes (GPs' experiences of the consequences of their PSA testing decisions). Some of these heuristics were more responsive to patient preferences than others.  Conclusions:   Variation in GPs' PSA testing practices is strongly related to their approach to overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of prostate cancer. Men receive very different care depending on their GP's reasoning and practice preferences.

Recently AR has been implicated in the development and progression of breast and prostate cancers. Although some of the functions of the AR are known but the mechanistic details of these divergent processes are still not clear. Therefore understanding the regulatory mechanisms of the functioning of the AR in ER-/AR+ breast cancer will provide many novel targets for the purpose of therapeutic intervention.  Methods/results:   Using bioinformatics tools, we have identified 75 AR targets having prominent roles in cell cycle, apoptosis and metabolism. Herein, we validated 10 genes as AR targets by studying the regulation of these genes in MDA-MB-453 cell line on stimulation by androgens like 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), using RT-qPCR and ChIP assay. It was observed that all the identified genes involved in cell cycle except MAD1L1 were found to be up regulated whereas expression of apoptosis related genes was decreased in response to DHT treatment. We performed an exhaustive, rigid-body docking between individual ARE and DNA binding domain (DBD) of the AR protein and it was found that novel residues K567, K588, K591 and R592 are involved in the process of DNA binding. To verify these specific DNA-protein interactions electrostatic energy term calculations for each residue was determined using the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Our experimental data showed that treatment of breast cancer cells with DHT promotes cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis. It was observed that bicalutamide treatment was able to reverse the effect of DHT.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our results provide new insights into the mechanism by which AR promotes breast cancer progression. Moreover our work proposes to use bicalutamide along with taxanes as novel therapy for the treatment of TNBCs, which are positive for downstream AR signalling.""","""['Jatin Mehta', 'Shailendra Asthana', 'Chandi Charan Mandal', 'Sunita Saxena']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Antiproliferative Effect of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Mesenchymal Stem-Like Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Androgens induce divergent proliferative responses in human breast cancer cell lines.', 'Androgen Receptor Expression and Bicalutamide Antagonize Androgen Receptor Inhibit β-Catenin Transcription Complex in Estrogen Receptor-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Dual effects of androgens on mammary gland.', 'Integrin αvβ3 in the Mediating Effects of Dihydrotestosterone and Resveratrol on Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation.', 'Redox Regulation of PPARγ in Polarized Macrophages.', 'Fluoresceinated Aminohexanol Tethered Inositol Hexakisphosphate: Studies on Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster and Docking with 2P1M Receptor.', ""Common genetic variants associated with Parkinson's disease display widespread signature of epigenetic plasticity."", 'Targeting the androgen receptor in triple-negative breast cancer: current perspectives.', 'Colocynth Extracts Prevent Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition and Stemness of Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

A mixture of cancerous and noncancerous prostate cells was incubated with SERS biotags (SBTs) developed and synthesized by us, then injected into a flow-focused microfluidic channel, which forces the cells into a single file. The spectrally rich SBTs are based on a silver nanoparticle dimer core labeled with a Raman-active small reporter molecule paired with an affinity biomolecule, providing a unique barcode whose presence in a composite SERS spectrum can be deconvoluted. Individual cancer cells passing through the focused laser beam were correctly identified among a proportionally larger number of other cells by their Raman signatures. We examine two deconvolution strategies: principal component analysis and classical least-squares. The deconvolution strategies are used to unmix the overall spectrum to determine the relative contributions between two SBT barcodes, where one SBT barcode indicates neuropilin-1 overexpression, while a second SBT barcode is more universal and indicates unspecific binding to a cell's membrane.

Previously, we identified periostin to be up-regulated in aggressive prostate cancer (CaP) using quantitative glycoproteomics and mass spectrometry. The expression of periostin was further evaluated in primary radical prostatectomy (RP) prostate tumors and adjacent non-tumorous prostate tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Our IHC results revealed a low background periostin levels in the adjacent non-tumorous prostate tissues, but overexpressed periostin levels in the peritumoral stroma of primary CaP tumors.  Methods:   In this study, periostin expression in CaP was further examined on multiple tissue microarrays (TMAs), which were conducted in four laboratories. To achieve consistent staining, all TMAs were stained with same protocol and scored by same image computation tool to determine the total periostin staining intensities. The TMAs were further scored by pathologists to characterize the stromal staining and epithelial staining.  Results:   The periostin staining was observed mainly in peritumoral stromal cells and in some cases in tumor epithelial cells though the stronger staining was found in peritumoral stromal cells. Both periostin stromal staining and epithelial staining can differentiate BPH from CaP including low grade CaP (Gleason score ≤6), with significant p-value of 2.2e-16 and 0.001, respectively. Periostin epithelial staining differentiated PIN from low grade CaP (Gleason score ≤6) (p=0.001), while periostin stromal staining differentiated low grade Cap (Gleason score ≤6) from high grade Cap (Gleason score ≤6) (p=1.7e-05).

Although expression of TMPRSS2-ERG or TMPRSS2-ETV1 fusion alone is insufficient to initiate prostate tumorigenesis, they appear to sensitize prostate epithelial cells for cooperation with additional oncogenic mutations to drive frank prostate adenocarcinoma. To search for such ETS-cooperating oncogenic events, we focused on a well-studied prostate tumor suppressor NKX3.1, as loss of NKX3.1 is another common genetic alteration in human prostate cancer. Previous studies have shown that deletions at 8p21 (harboring NKX3.1) and 21q22 (resulting in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion) were both present in a subtype of prostate cancer cases, and that ERG can lead to epigenetic silencing of NKX3.1 in prostate cancer cells, whereas NKX3.1 can in turn negatively regulate TMPRSS2-ERG fusion expression via suppression of the TMPRSS2 promoter activity. We recently generated knockin mouse models for TMPRSS2-ERG and TMPRSS2-ETV1 fusions, utilizing the endogenous Tmprss2 promoter. We crossed these knockin models to an Nkx3.1 knockout mouse model. In Tmprss2-ERG;Nkx3.1+/- (or -/-) male mice, although we observed a slight but significant upregulation of Tmprss2-ERG fusion expression upon Nkx3.1 loss, we did not detect any significant cooperation between these two genetic events to enhance prostate tumorigenesis in vivo. Furthermore, retrospective analysis of a previously published human prostate cancer dataset revealed that within ERG-overexpressing prostate cancer cases, NKX3.1 loss or deletion did not predict biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy. Collectively, these data suggest that although TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and loss of NKX3.1 are among the most common mutational events found in prostate cancer, and although each of them can sensitize prostate epithelial cells for cooperating with other oncogenic events, these two events themselves do not appear to cooperate at a significant level in vivo to enhance prostate tumorigenesis.""","""['Douglas E Linn', 'Roderick T Bronson', 'Zhe Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Loss of the NKX3.1 tumorsuppressor promotes the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'Binding of TMPRSS2-ERG to BAF Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Mediates Prostate Oncogenesis.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG fusion by translocation or interstitial deletion is highly relevant in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, but is bypassed in late-stage androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Covid-19 pathogenesis in prostatic cancer and TMPRSS2-ERG regulatory genetic pathway.', 'Function and regulation of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors in cancer.', 'Genetics and biology of prostate cancer.', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of Prostate Cancer in the Postgenomic Era.']"""

However, how SLFN11 is regulated in cancer cells remained unknown. Ewing sarcoma, which is characterized by the chimeric transcription factor EWS-FLI1, has notably high SLFN11 expression, leading us to investigate whether EWS-FLI1 drives SLFN11 expression and the role of SLFN11 in the drug response of Ewing sarcoma cells.  Experimental design:   Binding sites of EWS-FLI1 on the SLFN11 promoter were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and promoter-luciferase reporter analyses. The relationship between SLFN11 and EWS-FLI1 were further examined in EWS-FLI1-knockdown or -overexpressing cells and in clinical tumor samples.  Results:   EWS-FLI1 binds near the transcription start site of SLFN11 promoter and acts as a positive regulator of SLFN11 expression in Ewing sarcoma cells. EWS-FLI1-mediated SLFN11 expression is responsible for high sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma to camptothecin and combinations of PARP inhibitors with temozolomide. Importantly, Ewing sarcoma patients with higher SLFN11 expression showed better tumor-free survival rate. The correlated expression between SLFN11 and FLI1 extends to leukemia, pediatric, colon, breast, and prostate cancers. In addition, expression of other ETS members correlates with SLFN11 in NCI-60 and CCLE datasets, and molecular experiments demonstrate that ETS1 acts as a positive regulator for SLFN11 expression in breast cancer cells.

Importantly, the conversion of the carboxyl groups of PMA(SH) into the neutral amides of poly(hydroxypropylmetacrylamide) (pHPMA(SH)) nullified the off-target effects and cytotoxicity in tested cell lines. This suggests that the simultaneous action of carboxyl and disulfide groups in PMA(SH) polymer or capsules may play a role in mediating the intracellular off-target effects.

A large body of evidence indicates that soluble factors produced by the cancer cells act to promote osteoclast formation. Using mass spectrometry, we identified peroxiredoxin (PRDX) as a secreted mediator of cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis. Both breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC3 and LNCaP) carcinoma cells secreted PRDX4. PRDX4 knockdown using shRNA (shPRDX4) diminished PRDX4 secretion from MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cells and significantly decreased the ability of cancer-derived factors to induce osteoclast formation from late precursors in vitro. Tibial injection of shPRDX4 PC3 cells led to the development of significantly smaller osteolytic lesions characterized by significantly reduced osteoclast numbers compared to control PC3 cells. A meta-analysis demonstrated an increase in PRDX4 mRNA expression in carcinoma and metastatic breast and prostate tissues. Moreover, high expression of PRDX4 in the primary breast tumor was consistently associated with metastasis at 5 years.

Materials and methods:   Fifty-four patients who were treated with RT for prostate cancer (T1c-4N0-1M0) were evaluated. To assess the changes in anorectal function, two consecutive anorectal manometry readings were performed in patients, before and after 4-6 months of RT. Late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was defined as symptoms occurring more than 6 months after RT. The median radiation dose was 70.0 Gy (range, 66.0 to 74.0 Gy). Whole pelvis field RT was performed in 16 patients (29.6%). Grade of late radiation toxicity was defined in accordance to the severity of symptoms (Gulliford's scoring system).  Results:   The median follow-up period was 60 months. Resting anal pressure (p=0.001), squeeze pressure (p < 0.001), and urge to defecate volume (p=0.025) were significantly reduced after RT. Fourteen patients (25.9%) experienced late GI toxicities. Among them, nine (16.7%) showed severe (grade ≥ 2) late toxicities. Elevated resting and squeeze external anal sphincter pressure prior to RT and large urge to defecate volumes after RT were associated with the occurrence of late GI toxicities.  Conclusion:   RT caused symptomatic anorectal dysfunction and resulted in a weakened anal sphincter. Increased urge to defecate volumes after RT were related to late GI toxicities.

ID proteins also interact with many non-bHLH proteins in complex networks. The expression of ID proteins is increasingly observed in many cancers. Whereas ID-1, ID-2 and ID-3, are generally considered as tumor promoters, ID4 on the contrary has emerged as a tumor suppressor. In this study we demonstrate that ID4 heterodimerizes with ID-1, -2 and -3 and promote bHLH DNA binding, essentially acting as an inhibitor of inhibitors of differentiation proteins. Interaction of ID4 was observed with ID1, ID2 and ID3 that was dependent on intact HLH domain of ID4. Interaction with bHLH protein E47 required almost 3 fold higher concentration of ID4 as compared to ID1. Furthermore, inhibition of E47 DNA binding by ID1 was restored by ID4 in an EMSA binding assay. ID4 and ID1 were also colocalized in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. The alpha helix forming alanine stretch N-terminal, unique to HLH ID4 domain was required for optimum interaction. Ectopic expression of ID4 in DU145 prostate cancer line promoted E47 dependent expression of CDKNI p21. Thus counteracting the biological activities of ID-1, -2 and -3 by forming inactive heterodimers appears to be a novel mechanism of action of ID4.

However, interfering with STAT3 functions has been a difficult task and very few small molecule inhibitors have made their way to the clinic. OPB-31121, an anticancer compound currently in clinical trials, has been reported to affect STAT3 signaling, although its mechanism of action has not been unequivocally demonstrated. In this study, we used a combined computational and experimental approach to investigate the molecular target and the mode of interaction of OPB-31121 with STAT3. In parallel, similar studies were performed with known STAT3 inhibitors (STAT3i) to validate our approach. Computational docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) showed that OPB-31121 interacted with high affinity with the SH2 domain of STAT3. Interestingly, there was no overlap of the OPB-31121 binding site with those of the other STAT3i. Computational predictions were confirmed by in vitro binding assays and competition experiments along with site-directed mutagenesis of critical residues in the STAT3 SH2 domain. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrated the remarkably high affinity of OPB-31121 for STAT3 with Kd (10 nM) 2-3 orders lower than other STAT3i. Notably, a similar ranking of the potency of the compounds was observed in terms of inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, cancer cell proliferation and clonogenicity. These results suggest that the high affinity and efficacy of OPB-31121 might be related to the unique features and mode of interaction of OPB-31121 with STAT3.

The objective of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) was to demonstrate whether PC screening reduced mortality from this disease. The results from the Spanish branch of this study are presented: all-cause and cancer-specific mortality, the characteristics of the detected tumors, primary treatments and progression to advanced disease.  Material and methods:   A total of 18,612 men, between the ages of 45 and 70, were invited to participate in the study, excluding those with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. The men were randomized to the screening arm (serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA] reading) or the control arm (no diagnostic tests). Randomized transrectal ultrasound-guided sextant prostate biopsies were indicated for the men in the screening arm with PSA levels ≥3ng/ml. The detected PCs were identified (stage and primary treatment), as well as the deaths that occurred (date and cause of death).  Results:   The study was performed with 4276 men (2415 in the screening arm and 1861 in the control arm). The median age and serum PSA level were 57 years and 0.90ng/mL, respectively. The median follow-up time was 15.8 years. A total of 242 PCs were diagnosed, 162 (6.7%) in the screening arm and 80 (4.3%) in the control arm (P<.001). Of these, 214 (88.4%) had an organ-confined clinical stage at onset (91.4% in the screening arm vs. 82.5% in the control arm; P=.024). A total of 112 patients (46.3%) underwent radical prostatectomy, 53 (21.9%) underwent prostate radiation therapy, 24 (9.9%) underwent hormone therapy and 47 (19.4%) were kept under observation. A total of 18 PCs progressed to advanced disease (M+ or PSA levels >100ng/mL), with no differences between the study arms (P=.938). A total of 618 (14.5%) patients died during follow-up: 340 (14.1%) in the screening arm and 278 (14.9%) in the control arm, with no differences between the arms in terms of cancer-specific (P=.907) or all-cause (P=.399) mortality. The main causes of death were neoplasia (54.0%), cardiovascular (17.6%), respiratory (8.7%) and gastrointestinal (4.0%), with no difference between study arms. Of the 334 patients who died from neoplasia, only 12 (3.6%) died from PC.  Conclusions:   PC screening results in a shifting of the diagnosis towards earlier stages. Nevertheless, we have not demonstrated a benefit in terms of overall or cancer-specific survival after more than 15 years of follow-up.

NKX3.1 degradation is activated by phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues that mediate ubiquitination and protein turnover. Because NKX3.1 is haploinsufficient, strategies to increase its protein stability could lead to new therapies.

This approach identified several candidates, of which DYRK1B, a kinase that is subject to gene amplification and overexpression in other cancers, had the greatest impact on NKX3.1 half-life. Mechanistically, NKX3.1 and DYRK1B were shown to interact via the DYRK1B kinase domain. In addition, an in vitro kinase assay showed that DYRK1B phosphorylated NKX3.1 at serine 185, a residue critical for NKX3.1 steady-state turnover. Lastly, small-molecule inhibitors of DYRK1B prolonged NKX3.1 half-life. Thus, DYRK1B is a target for enzymatic inhibition in order to increase cellular NKX3.1.  Implications:   DYRK1B is a promising and novel kinase target for prostate cancer treatment mediated by enhancing NKX3.1 levels.""","""['Liang-Nian Song', 'Jose Silva', 'Antonius Koller', 'Andrew Rosenthal', 'Emily I Chen', 'Edward P Gelmann']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Loss of PTEN Accelerates NKX3.1 Degradation to Promote Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Stabilization of the prostate-specific tumor suppressor NKX3.1 by the oncogenic protein kinase Pim-1 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Inflammatory cytokines induce phosphorylation and ubiquitination of prostate suppressor protein NKX3.1.', 'Regulating NKX3.1 stability and function: Post-translational modifications and structural determinants.', 'Mechanisms of prostate tumorigenesis: roles for transcription factors Nkx3.1 and Egr1.', 'Reciprocal deregulation of NKX3.1 and AURKA axis in castration-resistant prostate cancer and NEPC models.', 'LIMK2-NKX3.1 Engagement Promotes Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Nkx3.1 in Cancers and Stemness.', 'Minibrain-related kinase/dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1B implication in stem/cancer stem cells biology.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Point Mutation in Nkx3.1 Prolongs Protein Half-Life and Reverses Effects Nkx3.1 Allelic Loss.']"""

In the literature, there is a lack of any study that addresses the relationship between the length of biopsy cores and the absence of glandular prostate tissue. In this study, we aimed to determine whether a relationship exists between these parameters.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 1,712 consecutive initial transrectal 12-core prostate biopsies. Individual cores were histologically categorized as glandular (benign or malignant) and non-glandular (rectal mucosa, periprostatic adipose tissue, prostatic or periprostatic fibromuscular tissue). Total number of evaluable cores ≤9, highly fragmented, incorrectly numbered or dried biopsies, patients with 5-α reductase inhibitory treatment were excluded.  Results:   We analyzed remaining 1,584 patients; 41.7 % had adenocarcinoma. A total of 19,144 cores were sampled. Non-glandular cores were found significantly shorter than glandular cores (p < 0.0001). The percentages of non-glandular cores were significantly higher at the base, apex and lateral biopsy sites (p < 0.0001). We found a 6-mm cutoff value for accurate prediction of glandular sampling with 80.2 % sensitivity and 78.7 % specificity. The risk of non-glandular sampling increased 15-fold in cores ≤6 mm (OR 14.91, 95% CI 13.20-16.83, p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Non-glandular sampling was directly associated with shorter core lengths. They were found significantly higher at the base, apex and lateral localizations. We found a 6-mm cutoff value for the prediction of non-glandular samples before the histologic evaluation. Below this value, the risk of non-glandular sampling increased 15-fold.

Increased serum concentrations of AA, such as by taking AA with food, may lead to the inhibition of additional enzymes in the androgen synthesis pathway implicated in castration-resistant prostate cancer progression.  Methods:   Medical records of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who received AA between 1 April 2011 and 31 December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcome was the percent of men with a rising PSA on AA who experienced any PSA decline within 3 months after changing the administration of AA from without food to with food. Secondary outcomes were median time on AA therapy in men who received AA therapy without food versus those that switched administration from without food to with food at PSA progression, and the percent of men who experienced any decline in serum testosterone concentration, and the rate of adverse events observed while taking AA with food.  Results:   Nineteen men who switched AA administration from without food to with food and 41 patients who administered AA without food only were included in the study. Of those patients who took AA with food at PSA progression, a PSA decline was observed in 3 of the 19 (16%) men, including 3 of the 14 men who had an initial response to AA (21%). Testosterone declined in five out of seven patients from pre-food levels. The median time on AA therapy was increased by nearly 100 days in patients who switched AA administration from without food to with food. No increases in toxicity were observed.  Conclusion:   Some men with mCRPC may benefit from taking AA with food.

Therefore, MRI might be a better imaging modality to differentiate the prostate from surrounding normal organs. Methods to accurately register MRI to simulation CT images are essential, as we transition the use of MRI into the routine clinic setting. In this study, we present a finite element method (FEM) to improve the performance of a commercially available, B-spline-based registration algorithm in the prostate region. Specifically, prostate contours were delineated independently on ten MRI and CT images using the Eclipse treatment planning system. Each pair of MRI and CT images was registered with the B-spline-based algorithm implemented in the VelocityAI system. A bounding box that contains the prostate volume in the CT image was selected and partitioned into a tetrahedral mesh. An adaptive finite element method was then developed to adjust the displacement vector fields (DVFs) of the B-spline-based registrations within the box. The B-spline and FEM-based registrations were evaluated based on the variations of prostate volume and tumor centroid, the unbalanced energy of the generated DVFs, and the clarity of the reconstructed anatomical structures. The results showed that the volumes of the prostate contours warped with the B-spline-based DVFs changed 10.2% on average, relative to the volumes of the prostate contours on the original MR images. This discrepancy was reduced to 1.5% for the FEM-based DVFs. The average unbalanced energy was 2.65 and 0.38 mJ cm(-3), and the prostate centroid deviation was 0.37 and 0.28 cm, for the B-spline and FEM-based registrations, respectively. Different from the B-spline-warped MR images, the FEM-warped MR images have clear boundaries between prostates and bladders, and their internal prostatic structures are consistent with those of the original MR images. In summary, the developed adaptive FEM method preserves the prostate volume during the transformation between the MR and CT images and improves the accuracy of the B-spline registrations in the prostate region. The approach will be valuable for the development of high-quality MRI-guided radiation therapy.""","""['Hualiang Zhong', 'Ning Wen', 'James J Gordon', 'Mohamed A Elshaikh', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Indrin J Chetty']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Evaluation of adaptive treatment planning for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.', 'MR image-based synthetic CT for IMRT prostate treatment planning and CBCT image-guided localization.', 'Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Using a Further Planning MRI after Neoadjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy Significantly Reduces the Radiation Exposure of Organs at Risk in External Beam Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Deformable MR-CBCT prostate registration using biomechanically constrained deep learning networks.', 'Deforming to Best Practice: Key considerations for deformable image registration in radiotherapy.', 'Fast contour propagation for MR-guided prostate radiotherapy using convolutional neural networks.', 'The evaluation of a hybrid biomechanical deformable registration method on a multistage physical phantom with reproducible deformation.']"""

Doxorubicin (DOX) was covalently conjugated to a nanosized HPMA copolymer using a pH-sensitive hydrazone bond and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) was conjugated to the same backbone using an enzymatically degradable oligopeptide Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly sequence. Then, the conjugate was decorated with galectin-3 targeting peptide G3-C12 [P-(G3-C12)-DOX-Fu]. The two drugs showed similar in vitro release profiles, suggesting that they may be able to work synergistically in the codelivery system. In galectin-3 overexpressed PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells, P-(G3-C12)-DOX-Fu surprisingly exhibited comparable cytotoxicity to free DOX at high concentration by increasing cell internalization and exerting synergistic genotoxic effects of cell cycle arrest, caspase-3 activation, and DNA damage. In mice bearing PC-3 tumor xenografts, the use of tumor-targeting ligand substantially enhanced the intracellular delivery of P-(G3-C12)-DOX-Fu in tumors. The targeted dual drug-loaded conjugate inhibited tumor growth to a greater extent (tumor inhibition of 81.6%) than did nontargeted P-DOX-Fu (71.2%), P-DOX (63%), DOX·HCl (40.5%), P-Fu (32.0%), or 5-Fu (14.6%), without inducing any obvious side effects.

Previous studies have shown that the Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC) secretome, triggers metastases in several cancer types such as breast and prostate cancer, but the specific role of the MSC factors in neuroblastoma metastasis is unclear. To better understand the effect of MSC secretome on chemokine receptors in neuroblastoma, and its role in metastasis, we studied a panel of 20 neuroblastoma cell lines, and compared their invasive potential towards MSC-conditioned-RPMI (mRPMI) and their cytokine receptor expression profiles. Western blot analysis revealed the expression of multiple CXCR4 isoforms in neuroblastoma cells. Among the five major isoforms, the expression of the 47 kDa isoform showed significant correlation with high invasiveness. Pretreatment with mRPMI up-regulated the expression of the 47 kDa CXCR4 isoform and also increased MMP-9 secretion, expression of integrin α3 and integrin β1, and the invasive potential of the cell; while blocking CXCR4 either with AMD 3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, or with an anti-47 kDa CXCR4 neutralizing antibody decreased the secretion of MMP-9, the expression of integrin α3 and integrin β1, and the invasive potential of the cell. Pretreatment with mRPMI also protected the 47 kDa CXCR4 isoform from ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.

Of the 125 patients, 32 (25.6%) were deficient, 49 (39.2%) were insufficient and 44 (35.2%) were sufficient in vitamin D at the time of diagnosis. The median survival in deficient, insufficient and sufficient cohorts was 47.8, 44.0 and 52.6 months respectively (p = 0.60). On univariate analysis, four variables demonstrated a statistically significant association with survival: nutritional status, bone metastasis, corrected serum calcium and serum albumin (p<0.05 for all). On multivariate analysis, five variables demonstrated statistically significant associations with survival: hospital location, age, bone metastasis, serum albumin and corrected serum calcium (p<0.05 for all). Serum vitamin D status was not significant on either univariate or multivariate analysis.  Conclusion:   Contrary to previously published research, we found no significant association between pre-treatment serum 25(OH)D and survival in newly diagnosed stage IV prostate cancer patients. The lack of a significant association between serum vitamin D and survival in our study could perhaps be due to the fact that the disease was far too advanced in our patients for vitamin D levels to have any impact on prognosis.""","""['Digant Gupta', 'Kristen Trukova', 'Brenten Popiel', 'Carolyn Lammersfeld', 'Pankaj G Vashi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The relationship between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and survival in newly diagnosed advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Impact of oral vitamin D supplementation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in oncology.', 'Associations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D with prostate cancer diagnosis, stage and grade.', 'Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels in men undergoing radical prostatectomy: is there an association with adverse pathologic features?', 'Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and prognosis in hematological malignancies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Vitamin D Deficiency at Diagnosis Increases All-Cause and Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality in Jamaican Men.', 'Vitamin D-Induced Molecular Mechanisms to Potentiate Cancer Therapy and to Reverse Drug-Resistance in Cancer Cells.', 'Serum Levels of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D at Diagnosis Are Not Associated with Overall Survival in Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Circulating vitamin D level and mortality in prostate cancer patients: a dose-response meta-analysis.', 'Nutraceuticals in prostate cancer therapeutic strategies and their neo-adjuvant use in diverse populations.']"""

Methods:   Thirty-nine men with clinical suspicion of PCa and history of previous prostate biopsy underwent mpMRI on a 3-T MRI. In total, 72 lesions were evaluated by the consensus of two radiologists. PI-RADS scores for each MRI sequence, the sum of the PI-RADS scores and the global PI-RADS were determined. MRI/TRUS fusion-guided targeted biopsy was performed using the BioJet™ software combined with a transrectal ultrasound system. Image fusion was based on rigid registration.

Objectives:   The aim of this study was to investigate the current trends in presentation and distribution of lymphoma with special reference to incidence and mortality, gender, age, histopathological subtypes, and clinical stages at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH and RC).  Materials and methods:   Our study included lymphoma data from Saudi Cancer Registry, and relative comparison against KFSH and RC tumor registry data, Gulf country data and International Agency for Research on Cancer data.  Results:   Common tumors in the West (lung, colon, and prostate) were found to be much less frequent in KSA while leukemia, lymphoma and thyroid cancers were more common. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) ranked 3rd most common cancer with age-adjusted incidence of 6/100,000. Estimated age adjusted mortality was 4/100,000 in KSA. There was a peak rise in incidence of lymphoma in 1997-2007. Most common NHL was diffuse large B cell lymphoma at KFSH and RC. A total of 434 cases were diagnosed in 5 years with 55% of them at advanced stage and 35% demonstrating bulky disease and high risk. KFSH and RC registered 35% of Hodgkins and 21% of total NHL identified in entire Saudi Cancer Registry, 2009.  Conclusions:   Results of this study are very unique, and reveal diverse trends.

Materials and methods:   A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang and Weipu databases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of any association between AMACR polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. Subgroup analyses by ethnicity, source of controls, quality control and sample size were also conducted.  Results:   Five studies covering 3,313 cases and 3,676 controls on five polymorphisms (D175G, M9V, S201L, K277E and Q239H) were included in this meta-analysis. Significant associations were detected between prostate cancer and D175G (dominant model: OR=0.89, 95%CI=0.80-0.99, P=0.04) and M9V (dominant model: OR=0.87, 95%CI=0.78-0.97, P=0.01) polymorphisms as well as that in subgroup analyses.

However, coverage of preventive care, whether mandated or not, moves the cost of care from the consumer's out-of-pocket expense to the premium, resulting in a cross-subsidy of users of the service by non-users. While some cross-subsidies are intentional, others may be unintentional. We find that users of cancer screening have higher levels of income and education, while non-users tend to be racial minorities, lack a usual source of care, and live in communities with fewer physicians per capita.

Cellular senescence is a stable cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to sublethal stress. It is often overcome in malignant transformation to confer a survival advantage. CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein (C/EBP) β function is frequently deregulated in human malignancies and interestingly, androgen-sensitive PC cells express primarily the liver-enriched inhibitory protein isoform. We found that C/EBPβ expression is negatively regulated by androgen receptor (AR) activity and that treatment of androgen-sensitive cell lines with anti-androgens increases C/EBPβ mRNA and protein levels. Accordingly, we also find that C/EBPβ levels are significantly elevated in primary PC samples from castration-resistant compared with therapy-naive patients. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated enhanced binding of the AR to the proximal promoter of the CEBPB gene in the presence of dihydroxytestosterone. Upon androgen deprivation, induction of C/EBPβ is facilitated by active transcription as evident by increased histone 3 acetylation at the C/EBPβ promoter. Also, the androgen agonist R1881 suppresses the activity of a CEBPB promoter reporter. Loss of C/EBPβ expression prevents growth arrest following androgen deprivation or anti-androgen challenge. Accordingly, suppression of C/EBPβ under low androgen conditions results in reduced expression of senescence-associated secretory genes, significantly decreased number of cells displaying heterochromatin foci and increased numbers of Ki67-positive cells. Ectopic expression of C/EBPβ caused pronounced morphological changes, reduced PC cell growth and increased the number of senescent LNCaP cells. Lastly, we found that senescence contributes to PC cell survival under androgen deprivation, and C/EBPβ-deficient cells were significantly more susceptible to killing by cytotoxic chemotherapy following androgen deprivation.

To meet this need, we developed a high content image-based short hairpin RNA screen monitoring levels of the autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1. We identified 186 genes whose loss caused p62 accumulation indicative of autophagy blockade, and 67 genes whose loss enhanced p62 elimination indicative of autophagy stimulation. One putative autophagy stimulator, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4), drives flux through pentose phosphate pathway. Knockdown of PFKFB4 in prostate cancer cells increased p62 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), but surprisingly increased autophagic flux. Addition of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine prevented p62 accumulation in PFKFB4-depleted cells, suggesting that the upregulation of p62 and autophagy was a response to oxidative stress caused by PFKFB4 elimination.

Numerous trials have supported the benefit of combining androgen deprivation therapy with definitive radiation therapy in men with locally advanced or high-grade disease. Addition of abiraterone to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa) with radiation has not been reported. We examined the safety of this combination as well as its impact on androgen suppression.  Methods and materials:   A prospective, phase 2 study was conducted in men with localized PCa treated with 6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent abiraterone with LHRHa and radiation. Duration of adjuvant LHRHa was at the discretion of the treating clinician. Prostate biopsy assays were obtained prior to the start of therapy and prior to radiation. Sera and tissue androgen levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.  Results:   A total of 22 men with intermediate- (n=3) and high-risk PCa (n=19) received study therapy. Sixteen men completed the intended course of abiraterone, and 19 men completed planned radiation to 77.4 to 81 Gy. Radiation to pelvic nodes was administered in 20 men. The following grade 3 toxicities were reported: lymphopenia (14 patients), fatigue (1 patient), transaminitis (2 patients), hypertension (2 patients), and hypokalemia (1 patient). There were no grade 4 toxicities. All 21 men who complied with at least 3 months of abiraterone therapy had a preradiation prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration nadir of <0.3 ng/mL. Median levels of tissue androgen downstream of CYP17A were significantly suppressed after treatment with abiraterone, and upstream steroids were increased. At median follow-up of 21 months (range: 3-37 months), only 1 patient (who had discontinued abiraterone at 3 months) had biochemical relapse.  Conclusions:   Addition of abiraterone to LHRHa with radiation is safe and achieves effective prostatic androgen suppression. Preliminary analysis of the clinical data is also promising, with excellent PSA nadir and no relapse to date in this high-risk population.""","""['Eunpi Cho', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Kenneth J Russell', 'Jay J Liao', 'Mark A Konodi', 'Brenda F Kurland', 'Brett T Marck', 'Alvin M Matsumoto', 'Bruce L Dalkin', 'R Bruce Montgomery']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In Reply to Bhattacharyya et al.', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy and Abiraterone in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer: Safety and Effect on Tissue Androgens.

However, LYC bioavailability displays high interindividual variability. This variability may lead to varying biological effects following LYC consumption. Based on recent results obtained with two other carotenoids, we assumed that this variability was due, at least in part, to several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in LYC and lipid metabolism. Thus, we aimed at identifying a combination of SNPs significantly associated with the variability in LYC bioavailability. In a postprandial study, 33 healthy male volunteers consumed a test meal containing 100g tomato puree, which provided 9.7 mg all-trans LYC. LYC concentrations were measured in plasma chylomicrons (CM) isolated at regular time intervals over 8 h postprandially. For the study 1885 SNPs in 49 candidate genes, i.e., genes assumed to play a role in LYC bioavailability, were selected. Multivariate statistical analysis (partial least squares regression) was used to identify and validate the combination of SNPs most closely associated with postprandial CM LYC response. The postprandial CM LYC response to the meal was notably variable with a CV of 70%. A significant (P=0.037) and validated partial least squares regression model, which included 28 SNPs in 16 genes, explained 72% of the variance in the postprandial CM LYC response. The postprandial CM LYC response was also positively correlated to fasting plasma LYC concentrations (r=0.37, P<0.05). The ability to respond to LYC is explained, at least partly, by a combination of 28 SNPs in 16 genes. Interindividual variability in bioavailability apparently affects the long-term blood LYC status, which could ultimately modulate the biological response following LYC supplementation.""","""['Patrick Borel', 'Charles Desmarchelier', 'Marion Nowicki', 'Romain Bott']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['The Interindividual Variability of Phytofluene Bioavailability is Associated with a Combination of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms.', 'Interindividual variability of lutein bioavailability in healthy men: characterization, genetic variants involved, and relation with fasting plasma lutein concentration.', 'A Combination of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Is Associated with Interindividual Variability in Dietary β-Carotene Bioavailability in Healthy Men.', 'Genetic factors involved in the bioavailability of tomato carotenoids.', 'Tomatoes versus lycopene in oxidative stress and carcinogenesis: conclusions from clinical trials.', 'A Narrative Review of Factors Associated with Skin Carotenoid Levels.', 'Biochemical Validation of a Self-Administered Carotenoid Intake Screener to Assess Carotenoid Intake in Nonobese Adults.', 'The Interindividual Variability of Phytofluene Bioavailability is Associated with a Combination of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms.', 'Mediterranean Diet: The Beneficial Effects of Lycopene in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.', 'Cardiovascular Disease and Possible Ways in Which Lycopene Acts as an Efficient Cardio-Protectant against Different Cardiovascular Risk Factors.']"""

We investigated whether the failure to exclude diabetics in prior studies could have increased the likelihood of conflicting results.  Methods:   A total of 610 PrCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2005 and 2012 were followed for recurrence, defined as a rise in serum PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml following surgery. Body mass index (BMI) and history of type 2 diabetes were documented prior to PrCa surgery. The analysis was conducted using Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   Obesity (25.6 %) and diabetes (18.7 %) were common in this cohort. There were 87 (14.3 %) recurrence events during a median follow-up of 30.8 months after surgery among the 610 patients. When analyzed among all PrCa patients, no association was observed between BMI/obesity and PrCa recurrence. However, when analysis was limited to non-diabetics, obese men had a 2.27-fold increased risk (95 % CI 1.17-4.41) of PrCa recurrence relative to normal weight men, after adjusting for age and clinical/pathological tumor characteristics.  Conclusions:   This study found a greater than twofold association between obesity/BMI and PrCa recurrence in non-diabetics. We anticipated these results because the relationship between BMI/obesity and the biologic factors that may underlie the PrCa recurrence-BMI/obesity association, such as insulin, may be altered by the use of anti-diabetes medication or diminished beta-cell insulin production in advanced diabetes. Studies to further assess the molecular factors that explain the BMI/obesity-PrCa recurrence relationship are warranted.""","""['Ilir Agalliu', 'Steve Williams', 'Brandon Adler', 'Lagu Androga', 'Michael Siev', 'Juan Lin', 'Xiaonan Xue', 'Gloria Huang', 'Howard D Strickler', 'Reza Ghavamian']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Obesity and biochemical recurrence in clinically localised prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 86,490 patients.', 'Body mass index trends and role of obesity in predicting outcome after radical prostatectomy.', 'Body mass index is weakly associated with, and not a helpful predictor of, disease progression in men with clinically localized prostate carcinoma treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Body mass index as a prognostic marker for biochemical recurrence in Dutch men treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Relationship between obesity and prostate cancer.', 'Generation of an oxoglutarate dehydrogenase knockout rat model and the effect of a high-fat diet.', 'Obesity and biochemical recurrence in clinically localised prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 86,490 patients.', 'Clinical, Immunological, and Virological SARS-CoV-2 Phenotypes in Obese and Nonobese Military Health System Beneficiaries.', 'Effect of obesity on the prognosis and recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis.', 'In silico approach to identify non-synonymous SNPs with highest predicted deleterious effect on protein function in human obesity related gene, neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1).']"""

Most information on castrated male primates comes from a few studies on the skeletons of eunuchs. This report used a subset of the Caribbean Primate Research Center's (CPRC) Cayo Santiago (CS) rhesus macaque skeletal collection to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the bone mineral density (BMD) of castrated and age-matched intact males and, thereby, determine the long-term effects of castration (orchidectomy) on bone. Lumbar vertebrae, femora, and crania were evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA or DXA) and digital radiography augmented, when fresh tissues were available, with autoradiography and histology. Results confirmed physical examinations of long bones that castration causes changes in the skeleton of male rhesus macaques similar to those found in eunuchs, including OPE and OPO of the vertebrae and femora, thinning of the skull, and vertebral fractures and kyphosis of the spine more severe than that caused by normal aging alone. Also like eunuchs, some castrated CS male rhesus monkeys had a longer life span than intact males or females. Based on these results and the effects of castration on other tissues and organs of eunuchs, on behavior, hormone profiles and possibly on cognition and visual perception of human and nonhuman primates, and other mammals, castrated male rhesus macaques should be used with caution for laboratory studies and should be considered a separate category from intact males.

It represents 2-3 % of all cancers with annual increase in incidence of 2% in Europe (except Denmark and Sweden) and worldwide. Surgery is the only curative procedure, performed as radical nephrectomy (RN) or partial nephrectomy (nephron sparing surgery-NSS). Radical nephrectomy consists of nephrectomy with ipsilateral adrenalectomy and lymphadenetomy, but partial nephrectomy means resection of the tumor only with 1-3 mm of healthy surrounding tissue and preservation of the rest of the kidney as well as ipsilateral adrenal gland and lymph nodes. NSS is a method of conservation of attacked kidney and preservation of kidney's function with previous radical resection of localized RCC, respecting of all oncological principles. The aim of this study is to describe NSS procedure in details and present results of its 13 year use at Clinic of Urology in Novi Sad.  Material and methods:   In the last 13 years there were 868 patients (pts) with RCC. NSS has been performed in 242 pts (27.88%). Bilateral tumors: synchronous 8 pts, asynchronous 3 pts. Better kidney has been operated, first. Indications for NSS were: absolute--34 pts (15.0%), relative--58 pts (23.1%) and elective--150 pts (61.9%).Surgery was performed according to esta- blished protocol for this procedure based on recommendation of Prof. A. Novick, Cleveland, USA.  Results:   All patients underwent surgery under general anesthesia through lumbothomy, mostly.Tumor size was between 2.5-4.5 cm: over 4.5 cm (4-7 cm): 4 pts. Average age of pts--63.5 years (37-84), male: 148 (61.1%), female: 94 (38.9%). From 2001-2005, 2006-2010 i 2011-2013, 39,111 i 92 NSS has been done, respectively. It represented 13.5%, 36.6% , 50.54% of all pts with RCC underwent surgery in that period, respectively. There was an increase of NSS in that period compared to RN for localized RCC.

Methods and materials:   Fifty-six patients diagnosed with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with SBRT alone were reviewed retrospectively. All patients received a total dose of 38 Gy in 4 fractions with a planning target volume expansion of 2 mm. Overall, acute, and late genitourinary toxicity were documented according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4) and International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS).  Results:   The median age at treatment was 68 years, and the median prostate volume was 45.5 mL, with a median baseline IPSS of 9.95. The median prescription isodose line was 68%. The median clinical follow-up was 35.49 months. Acute grade 1, 2, and 3 genitourinary toxicities occurred in 41.1%, 35.7%, and 0% of patients. All acute genitourinary toxicities resolved except 1 patient with grade 2 toxicity that progressed to grade 3 late toxicity. No dose-volume relationships were associated with acute genitourinary grade 2+ toxicity. Late grade 1, 2, and 3 genitourinary toxicity occurred in 19.6%, 19.6%, and 3.6% of cases, respectively. Of the cases with late toxicities, 16.7% were persistent. Late grade 2+ genitourinary toxicity was associated with prostate volume ≥50 mL, lower homogeneity index, and urethral maximum point dose ≥47 Gy. The overall risk of any grade 2+ genitourinary toxicity was associated with baseline IPSS >7, prostate volume ≥50 mL, urethral volume receiving 44 Gy, and bladder volume receiving 19 Gy.  Conclusions:   SBRT for prostate cancer appears well tolerated, with mostly transient low-grade toxicity. Urethral sparing should be used with a maximum point dose <47 Gy, volume receiving 120 Gy <50% of the prostate, and bladder volume receiving 19 Gy <15 mL in 4 fraction treatments. Patients with prostate volumes ≥50 mL should be counseled regarding the increased risk of moderate-grade genitourinary toxicity.""","""['Zachary A Seymour', 'Albert J Chang', 'Li Zhang', 'Neil Kirby', 'Martina Descovich', 'Mack Roach rd', 'I-Chow Hsu', 'Alexander R Gottschalk']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Receiver operating curves and dose-volume analysis of late toxicity with stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Dose-Escalated Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Patients With Intermediate- and High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Initial Dosimetry Analysis and Patient Outcomes.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Dosimetric Predictors of Toxicity after Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy: A Single-Institutional Experience of 145 Patients.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a study comparing 3-year genitourinary toxicity between CyberKnife and volumetric-modulated arc therapy by propensity score analysis.', 'Patient reported outcomes for quality of life (QOL) by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) on average 15 years post treatment.', 'Treatment outcome and compliance to dose-intensified linac-based SBRT for unfavorable prostate tumors using a novel real-time organ-motion tracking.', 'Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy: An Overview of Toxicity and Dose Response.']"""

The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic utility of abdominal sequences in routine prostate cancer MR staging studies.  Methods:   Findings on abdominal sequences of consecutive MRI prostate studies performed for staging newly diagnosed prostate cancer between September 2011 and September 2013 were reviewed with respect to adenopathy and additional incidental findings. Results were correlated with Gleason grade and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in each case.  Results:   355 MRI prostate examinations were reviewed. 4 (1.1%) showed enlarged non-regional lymph nodes. Incidental findings were found in 82(23.1%) cases, neccessitating further investigation in 45 (12.7%) cases. Enlarged non-regional nodes were associated with higher PSA level and Gleason grade (p=0.007, p=0.005 respectively). With a combined threshold of PSA > 20 ng/mL and/or Gleason grade ≥ 8 the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 100, 60, 3 and 100% respectively for predicting the presence of non-regional adenopathy.

Results were compared to tumor phenotype, biochemical recurrence, and molecular subtypes defined by ERG status as well as genomic deletions of 3p, 5q, 6q and PTEN. HDAC1 immunostaining was detectable in 75.4% of 9744 interpretable cancers and considered strong in 15.4%, moderate in 39.4% and weak in 20.7% of cases. High HDAC1 expression was associated with high Gleason grade (p<0.0001), advanced pathological tumor stage (p<0.0001), positive nodal status (p=0.0010), elevated preoperative PSA-level (p=0.0127), early PSA recurrence (p<0.0001) and increased cell proliferation (p<0.0001). Moreover, high-level HDAC1 staining was associated with TMPRSS2:ERG rearrangement and ERG expression in prostate cancers (p<0.0001) and was linked to deletions of PTEN (p<0.0001), 6q (p<0.0001) and 5q (p=0.0028) in ERG-negative cancers. The prognostic impact of HDAC1 was independent of established clinicopathological parameters and was mostly driven by ERG-negative cancers as revealed by subgroup analyses. HDAC1 has strong prognostic impact in prostate cancer and might contribute to the development of a fraction of genetically instable and particularly aggressive prostate cancers.

Because prior literature shows little difference exists in the socioeconomic status of non-Hispanic whites and Asian Americans, any difference in cancer survival is less likely to be attributable to inequalities of care. We sought to examine differences in cancer-specific survival between whites and Asian Americans.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program was used to identify patients with lung (n = 130 852 [16.9%]), breast (n = 313 977 [40.4%]), prostate (n = 166 529 [21.4%]), or colorectal (n = 165 140 [21.3%]) cancer (the three leading causes of cancer-related mortality within each sex) diagnosed between 1991 and 2007. Fine and Gray's competing risks regression compared the cancer-specific mortality (CSM) of eight Asian American groups (Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Japanese, Korean, other Asian, South Asian [Indian/Pakistani], and Vietnamese) to non-Hispanic white patients. All P values were two-sided.  Results:   In competing risks regression, the receipt of definitive treatment was an independent predictor of CSM (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35 to 0.40; HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.58; HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.62; and HR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.29) for prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal cancers respectively, all P < .001). In adjusted analyses, most Asian subgroups (except Hawaiians and Koreans) had lower CSM relative to white patients, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.54 (95% CI = 0.38 to 0.78) to 0.88 (95% CI = 0.84 to 0.93) for Japanese patients with prostate and Chinese patients with lung cancer, respectively.  Conclusions:   Despite adjustment for potential confounders, including the receipt of definitive treatment and tumor characteristics, most Asian subgroups had better CSM than non-Hispanic white patients.

Abrogation of angiogenesis by NGD16 was promising in in vivo mouse Matrigel plug assay as well as in ex vivo sprouting of rat thoracic aorta. At the molecular level, NGD16 inhibited the expression of glucose regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression, the main mediators of angiogenesis and neovessel formation. Overexpression of GRP78 upregulated the expression of MMP-9 and VEGFR2 in PC-3 and HUVECs. Antibody blocking of GRP78 further potentiated NGD16 in attenuating angiogenesis through inhibition of MMP-9. NGD16 depicted its promising biodistribution profile in a pharmacokinetic study with 46.9% intraperitoneal bioavailability.

Methods:   We identified men with prostate cancer in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavour (CaPSURE) study who would have been eligible (⩽ cT3aN0M0, primary radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, PSA relapse as the only evidence of recurrence) for a randomised trial comparing 'immediate' versus 'deferred' ADT initiation. We emulated such trial by assigning patients to the 'immediate' strategy if they initiated ADT within 3 months of PSA relapse and to the 'deferred' strategy if they initiated ADT when they presented with metastasis, symptoms or a short PSA doubling time. We censored patients when they deviated from the assigned strategy and adjusted for this censoring via inverse probability weighting.  Results:   Of 2096 eligible patients (median age 69, interquartile range 63-75 years), 88% were white, 35% had a Gleason score ⩾ 7, 69% were treated with radical prostatectomy and 31% received radiotherapy only as primary treatment.

Patients and methods:   A total of 104 consecutive men (mean age 69 years, mean PSA 9.9 ng/ml) underwent HS prior to the extended prostate biopsy procedure. Patients received a targeted transperineal (template-assisted) as well as a targeted transrectal prostate biopsy using HS projection reports supplemented by a standardized 14-core systematic transrectal prostate biopsy (Bx). The cancer detection rate was analyzed on the sector level and HS targeted results were correlated to biopsy outcome, sensitivity, specificity, predictive accuracy, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV).  Results:   Of 104 patients, 44 patients (42%) were found to have PCa. Histology detected atypical small acinar proliferation in 3 patients (2.9%), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in 16 (15.4%), and chronic active inflammation in 74 (71.1%), respectively. The detection rate for each region was significantly higher in HS-targeted biopsies compared to Bx.

In contrast, weight and BMI at early middle age were significantly associated with metastasis (OR per 5 kg: 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.20; p<0.0001, and OR: 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.14; p<0.0001) and death (OR per 5 kg: 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03-1.19; p=0.005, and OR: 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13; p=0.003), respectively. It remains unclear whether these results apply to men of nonwhite origin, to populations with active PCa screening programs, or to countries without socialized health care.  Conclusions:   The analyses of these large data sets demonstrate that significant effects of body characteristics (with links to metabolic syndrome) measured at early middle age are associated with PCa disease severity, metastatic progression, and outcome. Conversely, measurements at birth and adolescence are not associated with PCa prevalence or outcome.

Recently, (68)Ga-PSMA (Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[(68)Ga(HBED-CC)]) was developed as a PSMA ligand. The aim of this study was to investigate the detection rate of (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT in patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Two hundred forty-eight of 393 patients were evaluable for a retrospective analysis. Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 1.99 ng/mL (range, 0.2-59.4 ng/mL). All patients underwent contrast-enhanced PET/CT after injection of 155 ± 27 MBq of (68)Ga-PSMA ligand. The detection rates were correlated with PSA level and PSA kinetics. The influence of antihormonal treatment, primary Gleason score, and contribution of PET and morphologic imaging to the final diagnosis were assessed.  Results:   Two hundred twenty-two (89.5%) patients showed pathologic findings in (68)Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT. The detection rates were 96.8%, 93.0%, 72.7%, and 57.9% for PSA levels of ≥2, 1 to <2, 0.5 to <1, and 0.2 to <0.5 ng/mL, respectively. Whereas detection rates increased with a higher PSA velocity (81.8%, 82.4%, 92.1%, and 100% in <1, 1 to <2, 2 to <5, and ≥5 ng/mL/y, respectively), no significant association could be found for PSA doubling time (82.7%, 96.2%, and 90.7% in >6, 4-6, and <4 mo, respectively).

The objectives of this analysis were to develop a population model that can describe the pharmacokinetics of the 6-month depot formulation of leuprolide acetate in patients with prostate cancer and to characterize the relationship of leuprolide plasma concentrations and serum testosterone concentrations.  Methods:   The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses were performed using a non-linear mixed-effect modeling approach. Observations were pooled from studies on healthy male volunteers and prostate cancer patients, who were administered a single 1 mg intravenous dose of immediate-release leuprolide acetate and two intramuscular doses of 45 mg of the depot formulation, respectively. The covariates that were screened for the pharmacokinetic model included body weight, creatinine clearance, liver function markers (total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, AST, alanine aminotransferase), age, and body mass index.  Results:   A two-compartment model with parallel first- and zero-order absorption processes and a delayed first-order process well-characterized the multi-phasic absorption profile of leuprolide acetate depot formulation. Typical population values of the absorption rate constant of the immediate and delayed processes were estimated to be 0.357 and 0.017 day(-1), respectively, with a mean transit time of 9.5 days. No covariates were significant in this analysis. A semi-mechanistic model, which accounts for down-regulation of the GnRH receptor via an inhibitory maximum effect (E max) model and the stimulatory effect of activated receptors on testosterone levels, adequately described serum testosterone profiles following dosing. The equilibrium dissociation constant of leuprolide and the typical leuprolide plasma concentration required to achieve a castration testosterone level of ≤0.5 ng/mL were 0.3 and 0.03 ng/mL, respectively.  Conclusion:   Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the leuprolide depot formulation were characterized using an integrated semi-mechanistic model. The developed model adequately describes the leuprolide-testosterone relationship and can potentially be used to facilitate design of clinical studies for new formulations, to aid in the selection of candidate formulations, and for the optimization of doses and dosing schemes.""","""['Chay Ngee Lim', 'Ahmed Hamed Salem']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Pharmacokinet""","""['Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two leuprolide acetate 45\u2009mg 6-month depot formulations in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of LH-RH analogue 1-month depot and 3-month depot by their hormone levels and pharmacokinetic profile in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'A New Sustained-release, 3-Month Leuprolide Acetate\xa0Formulation Achieves and Maintains Castrate Concentrations of Testosterone in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical pharmacokinetics of depot leuprorelin.', 'Leuprolide acetate given by a subcutaneous extended-release injection: less of a pain?', 'CHST7 Methylation Status Related to the Proliferation and Differentiation of Pituitary Adenomas.', 'Mathematical model of hormone sensitive prostate cancer treatment using leuprolide: A small step towards personalization.', 'Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Model for the Testosterone-Suppressive Effect of Leuprolide in Normal and Prostate Cancer Rats.']"""

The increasing use of PSA screening test has resulted in many more patients being diagnosed with this condition. Advances in its treatment have improved the survival rate among these patients. By 2040, the prevalence of prostate cancer survivors is expected to reach 830 000. Many of them will require medical support for the management of their progressive disease or long-term toxicities from previous treatments. Successful implementation of the cancer survivorship programme among these patients depends on a good understanding of their demand on the health care system. The aim of this study is to segment the population of prostate cancer survivors into different needs groups and to quantify them with respect to their phase of care.  Methods:   Incidence, survival, prevalence and mortality data collected and reported by cancer registries across the United Kingdom have been used for the current study to provide indicative estimates as to the number of prostate cancer patients in each phase of the care pathway in a year.  Results:   The majority of prostate cancer patients are in the post-treatment monitoring phase. Around a fifth of the patients are either receiving treatment or in the recovery and readjustment phase having completed their treatment in the preceding year. Thirteen percent have not received any anticancer treatment, a further 12% (32 000) have developed metastatic disease and 4% are in the final stage of their lives.  Conclusion:   On the basis of our estimates, patients undergoing post-treatment monitoring phase will constitute the biggest group among prostate cancer survivors. The pressure to provide adequate follow-up care to these patients will be a challenge.

Multivariable logistic models were used to quantify the impact of surgeon's experience (measured by the number of prior performed RP) on surgical margin status, postoperative continence and operative time.  Results:   Negative surgical margin rate was 86 % for patients with pT2 stage, and continence rate at 3 years after RP was 94 %. Patients with negative surgical margin had lower preoperative PSA level (p = 0.02), lower pT stage (p < 0.001) and lower Gleason score (p < 0.001).

The effect of body mass index (BMI) as a predictor of progression in men with low-risk PCa has been only poorly assessed. In this study, we evaluated the association of BMI with progression in patients with low-risk PCa who met the inclusion criteria for the active surveillance (AS) protocol.  Methods:   We assessed 311 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and were eligible for AS according to the following criteria: clinical stage T2a or less, prostate-specific antigen level < 10 ng/ml, 2 or fewer cores involved with cancer, Gleason score ≤ 6 grade, and prostate-specific antigen density < 0.2 ng/ml/cc. Reclassification was defined as upstaged (pathological stage > pT2) and upgraded (Gleason score ≥ 7; primary Gleason pattern 4) disease. Seminal vesicle invasion, positive lymph nodes, and tumor volume ≥ 0.5 ml were also recorded.  Results:   We found that high BMI was significantly associated with upgrading, upstaging, and seminal vesicle invasion, whereas it was not associated with positive lymph nodes or large tumor volume. At multivariate analysis, 1 unit increase of BMI significantly increased the risk of upgrading, upstaging, seminal vesicle invasion, and any outcome by 21%, 23%, 27%, and 20%, respectively.

Regulation of diverse pathways is mediated by the mediator complex. The mediator subunit MED15 is essential for transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling and involved in breast and prostate cancers. We investigated the implication of MED15 in HNSCC. IHC for MED15 was performed on 324 tissue samples, and TGF-β assessed the use of Ki-67 and pSMAD3 as markers. MED15 knockdown followed by proliferation and migration assays, as well as TGF-β1 treatment followed by MED15 analysis, was also performed. MED15 was overexpressed in 35% of primary tumors, 30% of lymph node metastases, and 70% of recurrences in contrast to no or low expression in benign tumors. MED15 overexpression in primary tumors from patients who developed recurrences was associated with higher mortality rates and occurred at highest frequency in oral cavity or oropharyngeal tumors. Furthermore, MED15 expression correlated between primary tumors and corresponding lymph node metastases. MED15 correlated with proliferation in tissues, and MED15 knockdown reduced proliferation and migration. We observed an association between MED15 and TGF-β activity in tissues because TGF-β activation led to increased MED15 expression and reduced pSMAD3 on MED15 knockdown. Taken together, our results implicate MED15 in HNSCC and hint that MED15 overexpression is a clonal event during HNSCC progression. MED15 may serve as a prognostic marker for recurrence and as a therapeutic target.""","""['David Adler', 'Anne Offermann', 'Rebecca Halbach', 'Wenzel Vogel', 'Martin Braun', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Friedrich Bootz', 'Jörg Wenzel', 'Ralf Mikut', 'Claudia Lengerke', 'Markus Reischl', 'Andreas Schröck', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['MED15, encoding a subunit of the mediator complex, is overexpressed at high frequency in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'MED15 overexpression in prostate cancer arises during androgen deprivation therapy via PI3K/mTOR signaling.', 'TGF-β and NF-κB signal pathway cross-talk is mediated through TAK1 and SMAD7 in a subset of head and neck cancers.', 'MED15, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), FcγRIII (CD16), and HNK-1 (CD57) are prognostic biomarkers of oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Loss of RUNX3 expression inhibits bone invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Clinical and Histopathological Factors Associated with the Tumoral Expression of TGF-β1, MED15, CD16, and CD57 in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'A Comprehensive Pan-Cancer Analysis of the Tumorigenic Effect of Leucine-Zipper-Like Transcription Regulator (LZTR1) in Human Cancer.', 'Step-by-Step Construction of Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis for Identifying Novel Biomarkers of Sepsis Occurrence and Progression.', 'Prion-like proteins: from computational approaches to proteome-wide analysis.', 'Saliva Gene Promoter Hypermethylation as a Biomarker in Oral Cancer.']"""

The growing number of cancer survivors has focussed interest on assessing survivors' HRQoL. We evaluated psychometric properties of the EORTC QLQ-PR25 questionnaire amongst PCa survivors.  Methods:   A postal questionnaire, including the QLQ-PR25, was administered to 6559 PCa survivors 2-18 years post-diagnosis, identified through population-based cancer registries in Ireland; 3348 participated. The QLQ-PR25 has been suggested to have five multi-item subscales measuring urinary (US), bowel (BS) and hormone treatment-related symptoms (TS), sexual activity (SA) and sexual functioning (SF), and a single item measuring bother due to using incontinence aids (IA). Reliability analysis, divergent validity, discriminant validity (compared to EORTC QLQ-C30, DASS-21 and EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L), and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA, CFA) were undertaken.  Results:   The percentage of survivors completing QLQ-PR25 subscales was: US-79 %; IA-20 %; BS-83 %; TS-86 %; SA-87 %; and SF-26 %. Reliability was acceptable (Cronbach's α > 0.7) for three subscales (US, SA, SF). The instrument discriminated well between clinically distinct groups, especially those defined by primary treatment(s) and stage at diagnosis. The SA and SF subscales showed good discriminant validity compared to QLQ-C30, DASS-21 and EQ-5D-5L; other subscales did not. EFA reproduced a near fit to the proposed factor structure. CFA confirmed this.  Conclusion:   This is the largest ever QLQ-PR25 validation study. When used in PCa survivors, although the proposed factor structure was confirmed, some of the subscales (e.g. BS and TS) showed poor reliability, a lack of discriminant validity and moderate levels of item non-response.""","""[""Eamonn O'Leary"", 'Frances J Drummond', 'Anna Gavin', 'Heather Kinnear', 'Linda Sharp']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Standardising the Assessment of Patient-reported Outcome Measures in Localised Prostate Cancer.

We evaluated PCa incidence by risk category at diagnosis across the study arms to assess the potential impact on PCa mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   Information on arm, centre, T and M stage, Gleason score, serum PSA at diagnosis, age at randomisation, follow-up time, and vital status were extracted from the ERSPC database. Four risk categories at diagnosis were defined: 1, low; 2, intermediate; 3, high; 4, metastatic disease. PSA (≤100 or >100 ng/ml) was used as the indicator of metastasis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for screening versus control arm by risk category at diagnosis and follow-up time were calculated using Poisson regression analysis for seven centres. Follow-up was truncated at 13 yr. Missing data were imputed using chained equations. The analyses were carried out on an intention-to-treat basis.  Results and limitations:   In the screening arm, 7408 PCa cases were diagnosed and 6107 in the control arm. The proportion of missing stage, Gleason score, or PSA value was comparable in the two arms (8% vs 10%), but differed among centres. The IRRs were elevated in the screening arm for the low-risk (IRR: 2.14; 95% CI, 2.03-2.25) and intermediate-risk (IRR: 1.24; 95% CI, 1.16-1.34) categories at diagnosis, equal to unity for the high-risk category at diagnosis (IRR: 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.13), and reduced for metastatic disease at diagnosis (IRR: 0.60; 95% CI, 0.52-0.70). The IRR of metastatic disease had temporal pattern similar to mortality, shifted forwards an average of almost 3 yr, although the mortality reduction was smaller.  Conclusions:   The results confirm a reduction in metastatic disease at diagnosis in the screening arm, preceding mortality reduction by almost 3 yr.

This study aimed to describe the course of hot flash interference with time in androgen deprivation therapy recipients relative to matched prostate cancer and cancer-free controls from before the start of androgen deprivation therapy to 12 months later. We also examined demographic, clinical and genetic predictors of the impact of androgen deprivation therapy on hot flash interference.  Materials and methods:   Three groups were examined, including 60 patients with prostate cancer recruited before or within 21 days of starting androgen deprivation therapy, 83 age and education matched patients with prostate cancer treated with prostatectomy only, and 86 age and education matched men with no history of cancer. Participants provided blood samples and completed the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale at baseline as well as 6 and 12 months later.  Results:   Androgen deprivation therapy recipients reported increasing hot flash interference with time relative to controls (p <0.001). Group differences were evident at 6 and 12 months (all p <0.001) with androgen deprivation therapy recipients reporting greater hot flash interference than controls. Several genetic polymorphisms were found to predict greater increases in hot flash interference (all p <0.01), including polymorphisms on genes associated with vasoconstriction, immune function, neurotransmission and circadian rhythms. Androgen deprivation therapy recipients who were younger and had a lower body mass index at baseline also showed greater increases in hot flash interference with time (all p ≤0.01).  Conclusions:   This study, which is to our knowledge the first to prospectively examine hot flash interference in androgen deprivation therapy recipients, reveals that those with certain genetic polymorphisms, younger age and lower body mass index had greater increases in hot flash interference with time relative to controls.""","""['Brian D Gonzalez', 'Heather S L Jim', 'Kristine A Donovan', 'Brent J Small', 'Steve K Sutton', 'Jong Park', 'Hui-Yi Lin', 'Philippe E Spiess', 'Mayer N Fishman', 'Paul B Jacobsen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Sleep disturbance in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: The role of hot flashes and nocturia.', 'Influence of hot flashes on quality of life in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Pilot evaluation of venlafaxine for the treatment of hot flashes in men undergoing androgen ablation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Complications of androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Hot flashes in prostate cancer: state of the science.', 'A 2-year prospective analysis of insomnia as a mediator of the relationship between androgen deprivation therapy and perceived cognitive function in men with prostate cancer.', 'Integration of Patient Reported Outcomes in Drug Development in Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Evaluating the prevalence and predictive factors of vasomotor and psychological symptoms in prostate cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy: Results from a single institution experience.', 'Sleep disturbance in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: The role of hot flashes and nocturia.', 'Development and Initial Validation of the Novel Scale for Assessing Quality of Life of Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy.']"""

Meanwhile, PCTAIRE1-knockdown did not sensitize non-malignant cells, including diploid fibroblasts IMR-90 and the immortalized prostate epithelial cell line 267B1. PCTAIRE1-knockdown did not up-regulate death receptor expression on the cell surface or affect caspase-8, FADD and FLIP expression levels. PCTAIRE1-knockdown did promote caspase-8 cleavage and RIPK1 degradation, while RIPK1 mRNA knockdown sensitized PPC1 cells to TNF-family cytokines. Furthermore, the kinase inhibitor SNS-032, which inhibits PCTAIRE1 kinase activity, sensitized PPC1 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

Furthermore, various studies have designated miR-141 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in different types of cancer. Thus, accurate and precise quantification of miR-141 is very essential for clinical diagnostics. In this regard, development of a reproducible and reliable assay for miR-141 can be the first step to standardize quantification of this valuable biomarker for in vitro diagnostics assays. Using stem-loop approach, we designed a Taqman real-time PCR assay for miR-141. This method allowed us to reproducibly and reliably quantify miR-141. The specificity, sensitivity, interassay and intraassay, and the dynamic range of the method were determined. The assay had a linear dynamic range of 3E-9.6E copies/reaction and the limit of detection was determined to be between 960 and 192 copies/reaction with 95% confidence interval.

We sought to evaluate whether 181 single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with various cancers in genome-wide association studies were also associated with melanoma risk.  Methods:   We evaluated 2,131 melanoma cases and 20,353 controls from three studies in the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study (EAGLE-BioVU, MEC, WHI) and two collaborating studies (HPFS, NHS). Overall and sex-stratified analyses were performed across studies.  Results:   We observed statistically significant associations with melanoma for two lung cancer SNPs in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus (Bonferroni-corrected p<2.8x10-4), replicating known pleiotropic effects at this locus. In sex-stratified analyses, we also observed a potential male-specific association between prostate cancer risk variant rs12418451 and melanoma risk (OR=1.22, p=8.0x10-4). No other variants in our study were associated with melanoma after multiple comparisons adjustment (p>2.8e-4).  Conclusions:   We provide confirmatory evidence of pleiotropic associations with melanoma for two SNPs previously associated with lung cancer, and provide suggestive evidence for a male-specific association with melanoma for prostate cancer variant rs12418451. This SNP is located near TPCN2, an ion transport gene containing SNPs which have been previously associated with hair pigmentation but not melanoma risk. Previous evidence provides biological plausibility for this association, and suggests a complex interplay between ion transport, pigmentation, and melanoma risk that may vary by sex. If confirmed, these pleiotropic relationships may help elucidate shared molecular pathways between cancers and related phenotypes.""","""['Jonathan M Kocarnik', 'S Lani Park', 'Jiali Han', 'Logan Dumitrescu', 'Iona Cheng', 'Lynne R Wilkens', 'Fredrick R Schumacher', 'Laurence Kolonel', 'Chris S Carlson', 'Dana C Crawford', 'Robert J Goodloe', 'Holli H Dilks', 'Paxton Baker', 'Danielle Richardson', 'Tara C Matise', 'José Luis Ambite', 'Fengju Song', 'Abrar A Qureshi', 'Mingfeng Zhang', 'David Duggan', 'Carolyn Hutter', 'Lucia Hindorff', 'William S Bush', 'Charles Kooperberg', 'Loic Le Marchand', 'Ulrike Peters']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Pleiotropic associations of risk variants identified for other cancers with lung cancer risk: the PAGE and TRICL consortia.', 'Pleiotropic effects of genetic risk variants for other cancers on colorectal cancer risk: PAGE, GECCO and CCFR consortia.', 'Genetic polymorphisms of TERT and CLPTM1L and risk of lung cancer--a case-control study in a Chinese population.', 'Comprehensive field synopsis and systematic meta-analyses of genetic association studies in cutaneous melanoma.', 'Genome-wide association studies of pigmentation and skin cancer: a review and meta-analysis.', 'Targeting the two-pore channel 2 in cancer progression and metastasis.', ""Let's talk about sex: A biological variable in immune response against melanoma."", 'Gender-Dependent Specificities in Cutaneous Melanoma Predisposition, Risk Factors, Somatic Mutations, Prognostic and Predictive Factors: A Systematic Review.', 'Lysosomal Calcium Channels in Autophagy and Cancer.', 'Two-pore channels and disease.']"""

Progensa PCA3 urine testing was shown to improve the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but its diagnostic value for aggressive prostate cancer is limited. Therefore, urinary biomarkers that can be used for prediction of Gleason score ≥7 prostate cancer in biopsies are urgently needed.  Experimental design:   Using gene expression profiling data, 39 prostate cancer biomarkers were identified. After quantitative PCR analysis on tissue specimens and urinary sediments, eight promising biomarkers for the urinary detection of prostate cancer were selected (ONECUT2, HOXC4, HOXC6, DLX1, TDRD1, NKAIN1, MS4A8B, PPFIA2). The hypothesis that biomarker combinations improve the diagnostic value for aggressive prostate cancer was tested on 358 urinary sediments of an intention-to-treat cohort.  Results:   A urinary three-gene panel (HOXC6, TDRD1, and DLX1) had higher accuracy [area under the curve (AUC), 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71-0.83] to predict Gleason score ≥7 prostate cancer in biopsies compared with Progensa PCA3 (AUC, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.62-0.75) or sPSA (AUC, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.78). Combining the three-gene panel with sPSA further improved the predictive accuracy (AUC, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.86). The accuracy of the three-gene predictive model was maintained in subgroups with low sPSA concentrations.  Conclusions:   The urinary three-gene panel (HOXC6, TDRD1, and DLX1) represents a promising tool to identify patients with aggressive prostate cancer, also in those with low sPSA values. The combination of the urinary three-gene panel with sPSA bears great potential for the early diagnosis of patients with clinically significant prostate cancer.""","""['Gisele H J M Leyten', 'Daphne Hessels', 'Frank P Smit', 'Sander A Jannink', 'Hans de Jong', 'Willem J G Melchers', 'Erik B Cornel', 'Theo M de Reijke', 'Henk Vergunst', 'Paul Kil', 'Ben C Knipscheer', 'Christina A Hulsbergen-van de Kaa', 'Peter F A Mulders', 'Inge M van Oort', 'Jack A Schalken']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: New gene panel for aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: Models to detect high-grade cancer.', 'Detection of High-grade Prostate Cancer Using a Urinary Molecular Biomarker-Based Risk Score.', 'A urine-based DNA methylation assay, ProCUrE, to identify clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Clinically significant Prostate Cancer diagnosed using a urinary molecular biomarker-based risk score: two case reports.', 'Blood-based and urinary prostate cancer biomarkers: a review and comparison of novel biomarkers for detection and treatment decisions.', 'Urinary biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Tumor-Associated Fibroblast-Derived Exosomal circDennd1b Promotes Pituitary Adenoma Progression by Modulating the miR-145-5p/ONECUT2 Axis and Activating the MAPK Pathway.', 'Transcriptome Profiling of Circulating Tumor Cells to Predict Clinical Outcomes in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cuproptosis signature and PLCD3 predicts immune infiltration and drug responses in osteosarcoma.', 'Biomarkers of Aggressive Prostate Cancer at Diagnosis.', 'Gene-Transcript Expression in Urine Supernatant and Urine Cell-Sediment Are Different but Equally Useful for Detecting Prostate Cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   We evaluated 1 033 patients with clinically high-risk prostate cancer, defined as the presence of at least one of the following risk factors: preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >20 ng/mL, and/or clinical stage ≥T3, and/or biopsy Gleason score ≥8. Patients were treated between 1990 and 2013 at a single institution. The year-by-year trends in clinical and pathological characteristics were examined. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to test the relationship between year of surgery and oncological outcomes.  Results:   We observed a decrease over time in the proportion of patients with high-risk disease (preoperative PSA >20 ng/mL or clinical stage cT3). A trend in the opposite direction was seen for biopsy Gleason score ≥8 tumours. We observed a considerable increase in the median number of lymph nodes removed, which was associated with an increased rate of lymph node invasion (LNI). On multivariable Cox regression analysis, year of surgery was associated with a reduced risk of biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] per 5-year interval 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.96; P = 0.01) and distant metastasis (HR per 5-year interval 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-0.99; P = 0.039), after adjusting for age, preoperative PSA, pathological stage, LNI, surgical margin status, and pathological Gleason score.  Conclusions:   In this single-centre study, an increased diagnosis of localized and less extensive high-grade prostate cancer was observed over the last two decades.

Here we show that there is a mechanistic link between zinc and Hh signaling. The upstream activator of Hh signaling, the Hh ligand, originates from Hh autoprocessing, which converts the Hh precursor protein to the Hh ligand. In an in vitro Hh autoprocessing assay we show that zinc inhibits Hh autoprocessing with a Ki of 2 μm. We then demonstrate that zinc inhibits Hh autoprocessing in a cellular environment with experiments in primary rat astrocyte culture. Solution NMR reveals that zinc binds the active site residues of the Hh autoprocessing domain to inhibit autoprocessing, and isothermal titration calorimetry provided the thermodynamics of the binding. In normal physiology, zinc likely acts as a negative regulator of Hh autoprocessing and inhibits the generation of Hh ligand and Hh signaling. In many diseases, zinc deficiency and elevated level of Hh ligand co-exist, including prostate cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and autism. Our data suggest a causal relationship between zinc deficiency and the overproduction of Hh ligand.""","""['Jian Xie', 'Timothy Owen', 'Ke Xia', 'Ajay Vikram Singh', 'Emiley Tou', 'Lingyun Li', 'Brigitte Arduini', 'Hongmin Li', 'Leo Q Wan', 'Brian Callahan', 'Chunyu Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Hedgehog Autoprocessing: From Structural Mechanisms to Drug Discovery.', 'A Single Aspartate Coordinates Two Catalytic Steps in Hedgehog Autoprocessing.', 'Paracatalytic induction: Subverting specificity in hedgehog protein autoprocessing with small molecules.', 'General Base Swap Preserves Activity and Expands Substrate Tolerance in Hedgehog Autoprocessing.', 'Hedgehog secretion and signal transduction in vertebrates.', 'Hedgehog Autoprocessing: From Structural Mechanisms to Drug Discovery.', 'Inteins as Drug Targets and Therapeutic Tools.', 'Celecoxib alleviates zinc deficiency-promoted colon tumorigenesis through suppressing inflammation.', 'Conditional DnaB Protein Splicing Is Reversibly Inhibited by Zinc in Mycobacteria.', 'Sterol A-ring plasticity in hedgehog protein cholesterolysis supports a primitive substrate selectivity mechanism.']"""

However, its application for treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) has shown modest effectiveness and did not follow the outcomes in cultured cells or animal models. Moreover, the molecular pathways by which imatinib induces cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells are poorly characterized.  Methods:   Two cell line models of HRPC (DU145 and PC3) were exposed to 20 μM of imatinib for 6-72 hr. MTS assay was used to assess cell viability during the course of experiment. Gene expression analysis of c-KIT, cell-cycle and apoptosis regulators, and angiogenic factors was determined by means of real-time PCR, western blot, and/or immunocytochemistry. The enzymatic activity of the apoptosis effector, caspase-3, was determined by a colorimetric assay.  Results:   Imatinib significantly decreased the viability of DU145 cells but paradoxically augmented the viability of PC3 cells. DU145 cells displayed diminished expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and augmented levels of caspase-8 and -9, as well as, increased enzymatic activity of caspase-3 in response to imatinib. No differences existed on the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins in PC3 cells treated with imatinib, though the activity of caspase-3 was decreased. The mRNA levels of angiogenic factor VEGF were decreased in DU145-treated cells, whereas an opposite effect was seen in PC3. In addition, it was shown that DU145 and PC3 cells present a differential expression of c-KIT protein variants.  Conclusion:   DU145 and PC3 cells displayed a contradictory behavior in response to imatinib, which was underpinned by a distinct expression pattern (or activity) of target regulators of cell-cycle, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. The paradoxical effect of imatinib in PC3 cells may be related with the differential expression of c-KIT protein variants. Moreover, the present findings helped to understand the discrepancies in the efficacy of imatinib as therapeutic option in HRPC.""","""['Henrique J Cardoso', 'Cátia V Vaz', 'Sara Correia', 'Marília I Figueira', 'Ricardo Marques', 'Cláudio J Maia', 'Sílvia Socorro']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The G-quadruplex ligand, SYUIQ-FM05, targets proto-oncogene c-kit transcription and induces apoptosis in K562 cells.', 'Imatinib enhances human melanoma cell susceptibility to TRAIL-induced cell death: Relationship to Bcl-2 family and caspase activation.', 'Imatinib mesylate inhibits tumorigenicity of malignant fibrous histiocytoma cells in vivo.', 'Effects of imatinib vary with the types of KIT-mutation in gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell lines.', 'Merkel cell carcinoma: lack of KIT positivity and implications for the use of imatinib mesylate.', 'Role and significance of c-KIT receptor tyrosine kinase in cancer: A review.', 'Topological properties and in\xa0vitro identification of essential nodes of the Paclitaxel and Vincristine interactomes in PC-3 cells.', 'Tr-KIT/c-KIT ratio in renal cell carcinoma.', ""Human Neurospheroid Arrays for In Vitro Studies of Alzheimer's Disease."", 'The stem cell factor (SCF)/c-KIT signalling in testis and prostate cancer.']"""

In this report, we studied the effect of concentration-dependent 3-AWA (3-azido withaferin A) sensitization to androgen-independent prostate cancer (CaP) cells which resulted in a distinct switching of 2 interrelated conserved biological processes, i.e. autophagy and apoptosis. We have observed 3 distinct parameters which are hallmarks of autophagy in our studies. First, a subtoxic concentration of 3-AWA resulted in an autophagic phenotype with an elevation of autophagy markers in prostate cancer cells. This led to a massive accumulation of MAP1LC3B and EGFP-LC3B puncta coupled with gradual degradation of SQSTM1. Second, higher toxic concentrations of 3-AWA stimulated ER stress in CaP cells to turn on apoptosis within 12 h by elevating the expression of the proapoptotic protein PAWR, which in turn suppressed the autophagy-related proteins BCL2 and BECN1. This inhibition of BECN1 in CaP cells, leading to the disruption of the BCL2-BECN1 interaction by overexpressed PAWR has not been reported so far. Third, we provide evidence that pawr-KO MEFs exhibited abundant autophagy signs even at toxic concentrations of 3-AWA underscoring the relevance of PAWR in switching of autophagy to apoptosis. Last but not least, overexpression of EGFP-LC3B and DS-Red-BECN1 revealed a delayed apoptosis turnover at a higher concentration of 3-AWA in CaP cells. In summary, this study provides evidence that 3-AWA is a strong anticancer candidate to abrogate protective autophagy. It also enhanced chemosensitivity by sensitizing prostate cancer cells to apoptosis through induction of PAWR endorsing its therapeutic potential.""","""['Bilal Rah', 'Reyaz ur Rasool', 'Debasis Nayak', 'Syed Khalid Yousuf', 'Debaraj Mukherjee', 'Lekha Dinesh Kumar', 'Anindya Goswami']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Autophagy""","""['The GST-BHMT assay reveals a distinct mechanism underlying proteasome inhibition-induced macroautophagy in mammalian cells.', 'Cocaine-mediated microglial activation involves the ER stress-autophagy axis.', 'Autophagy in the physiological endometrium and cancer.', 'BAG2 ameliorates endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell apoptosis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages through selective autophagy.', 'Organelle-specific autophagy in inflammatory diseases: a potential therapeutic target underlying the quality control of multiple organelles.', 'Genome-wide mapping of cancer dependency genes and genetic modifiers of chemotherapy in high-risk hepatoblastoma.', 'Withaferin A: A Pleiotropic Anticancer Agent from the Indian Medicinal Plant Withania somnifera (L.)

Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the preoperative lipid profiles of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP), with particular emphasis on the relationship between these profiles and biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Patients and methods:   We evaluated 715 consecutive men with clinically localized PCa who underwent RP at our institution between January 2011 and December 2013. We defined hypertriglyceridemia as a fasting serum triglyceride (TG) level greater than 200 mg/dL. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to predict BCR-free survival and applied the log-rank test to determine the statistical significance between survival curves. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to identify the significant predictors of BCR according to clinicopathological variables.  Results:   Of 663 patients who underwent RP for clinically localized PCa, 66 (10.0%) showed BCR during a median follow-up period of 21 months. Patients without BCR had higher levels of serum TG, and patients with hypertriglyceridemia were significantly more likely to achieve BCR-free survival in the Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank test, P = 0.009). In the multivariable analysis, the presence of hypertriglyceridemia (HR 0.22), pathologic Gleason score (≥ 8; HR 2.85), pathologic T stage (≥ pT3; HR 3.44), and a positive surgical margin (HR, 2.39) were still significant BCR predictors.  Conclusions:   We found that preoperative hypertriglyceridemia was associated with a lower risk of BCR after RP in patients with clinically localized PCa. Our results could help to clarify the currently conflicting evidence on the relationship between serum lipid profiles, particularly the presence of hypertriglyceridemia, and the risk of BCR in PC a patients after surgery.""","""['Minyong Kang', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Ja Hyeon Ku', 'Choel Kwak', 'Hyeon Hoe Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Short (≤ 1 mm) positive surgical margin and risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic Role of Preoperative Serum Lipid Levels in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Significance of preoperative butyrylcholinesterase as an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Perineural invasion as an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Obesity and biochemical recurrence in clinically localised prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 86,490 patients.', 'Metabolic syndrome and its components predict the biochemical recurrence and adverse pathological features of patients following radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matching study.', 'Metabolic Syndrome Is Not Associated With Prostate Cancer Recurrence: A Retrospective Analysis of a Chinese Cohort.', 'Influence of serum total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglyceride on prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic value of lipid profiles after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Practicability of a Novel Prognostic Index (PI) Model and Comparison with Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) in Stage I-III Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Surgical Treatment.']"""

In prostate cancer patient samples, miR-1 levels are inversely correlated with SRC expression and a SRC-dependent gene signature. Ectopic miR-1 expression inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and bone metastasis in a xenograft model. In contrast, SRC overexpression was sufficient to reconstitute bone metastasis and ERK signaling in cells expressing high levels of miR-1. Androgen receptor (AR) activity, defined by an AR output signature, is low in a portion of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We show that AR binds to the miR-1-2 regulatory region and regulates miR-1 transcription. Patients with low miR-1 levels displayed correlated low canonical AR gene signatures.

Augmented numbers of marrow adipocytes positively correlate with dysregulated bone remodeling, also a well-established complication of metastatic disease. We have shown previously that marrow adiposity accelerates prostate tumor progression in the skeleton and promotes extensive destruction of the bone; however, the factors behind adipocyte-driven osteolysis in the skeletal tumor microenvironment are not currently known. In this study, utilizing in vivo diet-induced models of bone marrow adiposity, we reveal evidence for positive correlation between increased marrow fat content, bone degradation by ARCaP(M) and PC3 prostate tumors, and augmented levels of host-derived CXCL1 and CXCL2, ligands of CXCR2 receptor. We show by in vitro osteoclastogenesis assays that media conditioned by bone marrow adipocytes is a significant source of CXCL1 and CXCL2 proteins. We also demonstrate that both the adipocyte-conditioned media and the recombinant CXCL1 and CXCL2 ligands efficiently accelerate osteoclast maturation, a process that can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies to each of the chemokines. We further confirm the contribution of CXCR2 signaling axis to adiposity-driven osteoclastogenesis by blocking fat cell-induced osteoclast differentiation with CXCR2 antagonist or neutralizing antibodies. Together, our results link CXCL1 and CXCL2 chemokines with bone marrow adiposity and implicate CXCR2 signaling in promoting effects of marrow fat on progression of skeletal tumors in bone.""","""['Aimalie L Hardaway', 'Mackenzie K Herroon', 'Erandi Rajagurubandara', 'Izabela Podgorski']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Bone marrow fat: linking adipocyte-induced inflammation with skeletal metastases.', 'Neutrophil recruitment by chemokines Cxcl1/KC and Cxcl2/MIP2: Role of Cxcr2 activation and glycosaminoglycan interactions.', 'Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 and CXCL2 produced by tumor promote the generation of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells.', 'Critical role of MKP-1 in lipopolysaccharide-induced osteoclast formation through CXCL1 and CXCL2.', 'The role of osteoclastic activity in prostate cancer skeletal metastases.', 'Involvement in Tumorigenesis and Clinical Significance of CXCL1 in Reproductive Cancers: Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Endometrial Cancer, Ovarian Cancer and Prostate Cancer.', 'Bone marrow microenvironment: roles and therapeutic implications in obesity-associated cancer.', 'Adipose tissue and hematopoiesis: Friend or foe?', 'Integrated analysis of the tumor microenvironment using a reconfigurable microfluidic cell culture platform.', 'The soluble CD83 protein prevents bone destruction by inhibiting the formation of osteoclasts and inducing resolution of inflammation in arthritis.']"""

Although many studies have highlighted the relationship between better erectile function and exercise, black men have been underrepresented in the literature.  Aims:   This study aims to determine whether or not exercise is associated with better erectile as well as sexual function in black men and define a minimum exercise threshold for which better erectile/sexual function is seen in a cross-sectional study.  Methods:   Our study population consisted of 295 healthy controls from a case-control study assessing risk factors for prostate cancer conducted at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which contained a substantial proportion of black men (n = 93; 32%). Exercise and erectile/sexual function were both determined from self-reported questionnaires. Subjects were stratified into four exercise groups: <3 (sedentary), 3-8.9 (mildly active), 9-17.9 (moderately active), and ≥18 (highly active) metabolic equivalents (MET) hours/week. The association between exercise and erectile/sexual function was addressed utilizing multivariable linear regression analyses.  Main outcome measures:   Erectile/sexual function was defined by the validated Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite sexual assessment, which was analyzed as a continuous variable (sexual function score). Clinically significant better function was defined as half a standard deviation (SD) (16.5 points).  Results:   Median sexual function score was 53 (SD = 33). Higher exercise was associated with a better sexual function score (P < 0.001). Importantly, there was no interaction between black race and exercise (P-interaction = 0.772), meaning more exercise was linked with better erectile/sexual function regardless of race. Overall, exercise ≥18 MET hours/week predicted better erectile/sexual function (P < 0.001) with a clinically significant 17.3-point higher function. Exercise at lower levels was not statistically (P > 0.147) or clinically (≤8.14 points higher function) associated with erectile/sexual function.  Conclusions:   In a racially diverse population, exercise ≥18 MET hours/week is highly associated with better erectile/sexual function regardless of race.""","""['Ross M Simon', 'Lauren Howard', 'Daniel Zapata', 'Jennifer Frank', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Adriana C Vidal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Comment on: Exercise Overcomes Possible Influences of Race and Obesity.', 'Correlation between LUTS (AUA-SS) and erectile dysfunction (SHIM) in an age-matched racially diverse male population: data from the Prostate Cancer Awareness Week (PCAW).', 'Exercise Improves Self-Reported Sexual Function Among Physically Active Adults.', 'Comment on: Exercise Overcomes Possible Influences of Race and Obesity.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Detailing Sexual Outcomes After Focal Therapy for Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Investigating self-reported efficacy of lifestyle medicine approaches to tackle erectile dysfunction: a cross-sectional eSurvey based study.', 'Effect of the Nurse-Led Sexual Health Discharge Program on the Sexual Function of Older Patients Undergoing Transurethral Resection of Prostate: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Prevalence and predictors of erectile dysfunction in adult male outpatient clinic attendees in Johor, Malaysia.', ""20 Things You Didn't Know About Exercise.""]"""

Objective:   To describe 15-yr survival outcomes and cancer therapy utilization among men 65 years and older managed conservatively for newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer.  Design, settings, and participants:   This is a population-based cohort study with participants living in predefined geographic areas covered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. The study includes 31 137 Medicare patients aged ≥65 yr diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 1992-2009 who initially received conservative management (no surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]). All patients were followed until death or December 31, 2009 (for prostate cancer-specific mortality [PCSM]) and December 31, 2011 (for overall mortality).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Competing-risk analyses were used to examine PCSM, overall mortality, and utilization of cancer therapies.  Results and limitations:   The 15-yr risk of PCSM for men aged 65-74 yr diagnosed with screening-detected prostate cancer was 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7-8.0%) for T1c Gleason 5-7 and 22% (95% CI 16-35%) for Gleason 8-10 disease. After 15 yr of follow-up, 24% (95% CI 21-27%) of men aged 65-74 yr with screening-detected Gleason 5-7 cancer received ADT. The corresponding result for men with Gleason 8-10 cancer was 38% (95% CI 32-44%). The major study limitations are the lack of data for men aged <65 yr and detailed clinical information associated with secondary cancer therapy.  Conclusions:   The 15-yr outcomes following conservative management of newly diagnosed Gleason 5-7 prostate cancer among men aged ≥65 yr are excellent. Men with Gleason 8-10 disease managed conservatively face a significant risk of PCSM.  Patient summary:   We examined the long-term survival outcomes for a large group of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who did not have surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or androgen deprivation therapy in the first 6 mo after cancer diagnosis. We found that the 15-yr disease-specific survival is excellent for men diagnosed with Gleason 5-7 disease. The data support conservative management as a reasonable choice for elderly patients with low-grade localized prostate cancer.""","""['Grace L Lu-Yao', 'Peter C Albertsen', 'Dirk F Moore', 'Yong Lin', 'Robert S DiPaola', 'Siu-Long Yao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['A Brief Survey of Active Surveillance.', 'Re: Grace L.

Two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) has been the method of choice over two-stage predictor substitution (2SPS) in clinical studies. We directly compare the bias in the causal hazard ratio estimated by these two methods. Under a principal stratification framework, we derive a closed-form solution for asymptotic bias of the causal hazard ratio among compliers for both the 2SPS and 2SRI methods when survival time follows the Weibull distribution with random censoring. When there is no unmeasured confounding and no always takers, our analytic results show that 2SRI is generally asymptotically unbiased, but 2SPS is not. However, when there is substantial unmeasured confounding, 2SPS performs better than 2SRI with respect to bias under certain scenarios. We use extensive simulation studies to confirm the analytic results from our closed-form solutions. We apply these two methods to prostate cancer treatment data from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare and compare these 2SRI and 2SPS estimates with results from two published randomized trials.""","""['Fei Wan', 'Dylan Small', 'Justin E Bekelman', 'Nandita Mitra']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Two-stage instrumental variable methods for estimating the causal odds ratio: analysis of bias.', 'A general approach to evaluating the bias of 2-stage instrumental variable estimators.', 'Two-stage residual inclusion for survival data and competing risks-An instrumental variable approach with application to SEER-Medicare linked data.', 'What random assignment does and does not do.', 'Confounding in health research.', 'Evaluation of instrumental variable method using Cox proportional hazard model in epidemiological studies.', 'Propensity Score and Instrumental Variable Techniques in Observational Transplantation Studies: An Overview and Worked Example Relating to Pre-Transplant Cardiac Screening.', 'Research on the Spatio-Temporal Impacts of Environmental Factors on the Fresh Agricultural Product Supply Chain and the Spatial Differentiation Issue-An Empirical Research on 31 Chinese Provinces.', 'Addressing the issue of bias in observational studies: Using instrumental variables and a quasi-randomization trial in an ESME research project.', 'Instrumental variable approach for estimating a causal hazard ratio: application to the effect of postmastectomy radiotherapy on breast cancer patients.']"""

We evaluated circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration as a surrogate outcome measure.  Patients and methods:   Examining CTCs alone and in combination with other biomarkers as a surrogate for overall survival was a secondary objective of COU-AA-301, a multinational, randomized, double-blind phase III trial of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus prednisone alone in patients with metastatic CRPC previously treated with docetaxel. The biomarkers were measured at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks, with 12 weeks being the primary measure of interest. The Prentice criteria were applied to test candidate biomarkers as surrogates for overall survival at the individual-patient level.  Results:   A biomarker panel using CTC count and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was shown to satisfy the four Prentice criteria for individual-level surrogacy. Twelve-week surrogate biomarker data were available for 711 patients. The abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and prednisone-alone groups demonstrated a significant survival difference (P = .034); surrogate distribution at 12 weeks differed by treatment (P < .001); the discriminatory power of the surrogate to predict mortality was high (weighted c-index, 0.81); and adding the surrogate to the model eliminated the treatment effect on survival. Overall, 2-year survival of patients with CTCs < 5 (low risk) versus patients with CTCs ≥ 5 cells/7.5 mL of blood and LDH > 250 U/L (high risk) at 12 weeks was 46% and 2%, respectively.  Conclusion:   A biomarker panel containing CTC number and LDH level was shown to be a surrogate for survival at the individual-patient level in this trial of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus prednisone alone for patients with metastatic CRPC.

Due to the progressive development of medical technology, interest in minimally invasive treatments for prostate cancer, such as cryoablation, interstitial brachytherapy and HIFU-therapy, has grown. Cryoablation of the prostate gland is a tissue ablation by local effects of very low temperatures and is minimally invasive, highly effective treatment for prostate cancer that can be used as the primary treatment, and in the case of tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. Focal cryoablation of the prostate allows to selectively destroy the known tumor with preservation of organ function and without reducing the quality of life of the patient. Focal therapy for prostate cancer is an alternative to radical treatment and active surveillance, occupying an intermediate position between them. Due to the lack of long-term results, focal cryoablation is an experimental type of treatment. First cryoablation of the prostate using modern equipment was carried out in Russia in March 2010, at the Department of Urology MSMSU. Since that time, we performed this procedure in 122 patients with prostate cancer; cryoablation was primary treatment in 110 patients and was used as salvage treatment in 12 patients. In most cases, the operation was performed under epidural or spinal anesthesia. According to the protocol, all the patients underwent 2 cycles of freezing and thawing under transrectal ultrasound guidance. A significant improvement of equipment for cryosurgery, the use of cryoneedles with smaller diameter, and the use of temperature sensors and catheters to warm the urethral mucosa have allowed to minimize the number of complications in comparison with other methods of treatment of prostate cancer and achieve a high disease-free survival.

In this study, we analyzed the pathological features of a contemporary series of radical prostatectomy cases. A total of 230 consecutive, whole-mounted radical prostatectomy specimens collected from 2012 to 2014 were reviewed. The median age of the patients was 68 years, and 64.3% of patients presented with prostate specific antigen alone. Pathological examination indicated that a high proportion (77.4%) of patients had intermediate- or high-risk disease according to the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical score. After surgery, only 28 patients met the criteria for active surveillance (organ-confined Gleason ≥6 disease). The Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance criteria achieved a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 98.0% for identifying candidates. The probability of Gleason score upgrading was 24.8% in the entire group and 59.0% in biopsy-confirmed Gleason ≥6 disease. The predominant tumor was located in the transition zone in 14.8% of cases, while only three patients (1.3%) had a predominant tumor located in the anterior region. Patients with transition zone-predominant tumor were likely to have been referred with urinary symptoms and high prostate specific antigen levels. The results of this study highlight the contemporary pathological features of localized prostate cancer in urban China.

Methods:   Patients from the Cryo On-Line Database registry undergoing SC after radiation failure were divided according to whether they had previously received or not received ADT. Baseline characteristics including demographics and presalvage cancer risk were compared. Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) as defined by the Phoenix criteria was compared between the 2 groups as a whole and also in D'Amico risk-stratified subgroups. In addition, postsurgical complications such as urinary fistula, retention, incontinence, and erectile dysfunction were compared.  Results:   Two groups consisting of 254 and 486 patients with and without pre-SC ADT were analyzed. The patients who received ADT were younger (P = .003) and had higher presalvage D'Amico risks (P <.001). The 5-year bPFS was 63.8% and 39.3% for the hormone-naïve and the pre-SC ADT patients, respectively (P <.001). On subgroup analysis, the difference in 5-year bPFS was significant only for patients with a high D'Amico cancer risk (54.3% vs 30.5%; P = .013). On multivariate analysis, presalvage prostate-specific antigen (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7), Gleason score ≥ 8 (HR, 2.5), and use of pre-SC ADT (HR, 1.7) correlated with biochemical recurrence. Additionally, patients receiving pre-SC ADT experienced less urinary retention (P = .001) and incontinence (P = .008) but were more likely to be impotent (P = .010).

Histopathological lesions, proliferation, and serum hormone levels were evaluated at 7, 30, 90, and 200-day time-points after xenografting. The expression of 40 key genes involved in prostatic glandular and stromal growth, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, hormone receptors and tumor suppressors was evaluated using a custom PCR array. Epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation was performed on whole tissue, and laser capture-microdissection (LCM) isolated epithelial and stromal compartments of 200-day prostate xenografts. Combined initial plus secondary estrogenic exposures had the most severe tissue changes as revealed by the presence of hyperplastic glands at day 200. Gene expression changes corresponded with the cellular events in the KEGG prostate cancer pathway, indicating that initial plus secondary exposure to estrogen altered the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ultimately resulting in apoptosis inhibition and an increase in cell cycle progression. DNA methylation revealed that differentially methylated CpG sites significantly predominate in the stromal compartment as a result of estrogen-treatment, thereby providing new targets for future investigation.

Despite intensive investment in improving early diagnosis, it often escapes timely detection. Mortality remains high in advanced stage prostate cancer where palliative care remains the only option. Effective strategies are therefore needed to prevent the occurrence and progression of the disease. Plant-derived compounds have been an important source of several clinically useful anti-cancer agents and offer an attractive approach against prostate cancer. We previously showed that the methanol extract of Maytenus royleanus (MEM) leaves and its fractions possess significant antioxidant activity with therapeutic potential against free-radical associated damages. The present study evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of MEM in the prostate cancer model system. Analysis of MEM and its various fractions revealed the presence of triterpenoids, flavonoids and tannins, conjugated to one or more polar groups and carbohydrate moieties. Further studies against known standards established the existence of caffeic acid and quercetin 3-rhamnoside in varying concentration in different MEM fractions. Time course analysis of MEM treated prostate cancer cells indicated significant decrease in cell viability, assessed by MTT and clonogenic survival assays. This was accompanied by G2 phase arrest of cell cycle, downregulation of cyclin/cdk network and increase in cdk inhibitors. MEM treated cells exhibited cleavage of Caspase-3 and PARP, and modulation of apoptotic proteins, establishing apoptosis as the primary mechanism of cell death. Notably MEM suppressed AR/PSA signaling both in prostate cancer cell cultures and in the in vivo model. Intraperitoneal injection of MEM (1.25 and 2.5 mg/ animal) to athymic nude mice implanted with androgen sensitive CWR22Rν1 cells showed significant inhibition in tumor growth and decreased serum PSA levels reciprocating in vitro findings.

However, it is unknown whether individual LINE-1 loci or different CpGs within one specific LINE-1 promoter are equally affected by methylation changes. Conceivably, studying methylation changes at specific LINE-1 may be more informative than global assays for cancer diagnostics. Therefore, with the aim of mapping methylation at individual LINE-1 loci at single-CpG resolution and exploring the diagnostic potential of individual LINE-1 locus methylation, we analyzed methylation at 11 loci by pyrosequencing, next-generation bisulfite sequencing as well as global LINE-1 methylation in bladder, colon, pancreas, prostate, and stomach cancers compared to paired normal tissues and in blood samples from some of the patients compared to healthy donors.  Results:   Most (72/80) tumor samples harbored significant methylation changes at at least one locus. Notably, our data revealed not only the expected hypomethylation but also hypermethylation at some loci. Specific CpGs within the LINE-1 consensus sequence appeared preferentially hypomethylated suggesting that these could act as seeds for hypomethylation. In silico analysis revealed that these CpG sites more likely faced the histones in the nucleosome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis did not reveal a significant clinical advantage of locus-specific methylation markers over global methylation markers in distinguishing tumors from normal tissues.  Conclusions:   Methylation changes at individual LINE-1 loci are heterogeneous, whereas specific CpGs within the consensus sequence appear to be more prone to hypomethylation.

We have previously shown that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, frequently deregulated in prostate cancer, specifically induces the synthesis of proteins that contribute to metastasis, most notably YB-1 and MTA1, without altering mRNA levels thereby demonstrating the importance of translation control in driving the expression of these genes in cancer.Here, we analyze genomic sequencing and mRNA expression databases, as well as protein expression employing an annotated tissue microarray generated from 332 prostate cancer patients with 15 years of clinical follow-up to determine the combined prognostic capability of YB-1 and MTA1 alterations in forecasting prostate cancer outcomes. Remarkably, protein abundance, but not genomic or transcriptional alterations of YB-1 and MTA1, is predictive of disease recurrence, exhibiting a dose-dependent effect on time to PSA recurrence, an indicator of tumor relapse. Moreover, high protein levels of YB-1 and MTA1 are associated with a 3-fold increased risk for requiring future hormone therapy or radiation therapy. Importantly, YB-1 and MTA1 protein levels significantly increase the predictive capacity of a clinical model for prostate cancer recurrence.

We investigated the influence of a low carbohydrate diet, compared to a typical Western diet, on prostate cancer (PCa) tumor growth in vivo. LNCaP xenograft tumor growth was studied in both intact and castrated mice, representing a more advanced castration resistant PCa (CRPC). No differences in LNCaP tumor progression (total tumor volume) with diet was observed for intact mice (P = 0.471) however, castrated mice on the Low Carb diet saw a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth rate compared with Western diet fed mice (P = 0.017). No correlation with serum PSA was observed. Steroid profiles, alongside serum cholesterol and cholesteryl ester levels, were significantly altered by both diet and castration. Specifically, DHT concentration with the Low Carb diet was 58% that of the CRPC-bearing mice on the Western diet. Enzymes in the steroidogenesis pathway were directly impacted and tumors isolated from intact mice on the Low Carb diet had higher AKR1C3 protein levels and lower HSD17B2 protein levels than intact mice on the Western diet (ARK1C3: P = 0.074; HSD17B2: P = 0.091, with α = 0.1). In contrast, CRPC tumors from mice on Low Carb diets had higher concentrations of both HSD17B2 (P = 0.016) and SRD5A1 (P = 0.058 with α = 0.1) enzymes. There was no correlation between tumor growth in castrated mice for Low Carb diet versus Western diet and (a) serum insulin (b) GH serum levels (c) insulin receptor (IR) or (d) IGF-1R in tumor tissue. Intact mice fed Western diet had higher serum insulin which was associated with significantly higher blood glucose and tumor tissue IR. We conclude that both diet and castration have a significant impact on the endocrinology of mice bearing LNCaP xenograft tumors. The observed effects of diet on cholesterol and steroid regulation impact tumor tissue DHT specifically and are likely to be mechanistic drivers behind the observed tumor growth suppression.""","""['H Bobby Fokidis', 'Mei Yieng Chin', 'Victor W Ho', 'Hans H Adomat', 'Kiran K Soma', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Ka Mun Nip', 'Michael Cox', 'Gerald Krystal', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Evidence of limited contributions for intratumoral steroidogenesis in prostate cancer.', 'ERG/AKR1C3/AR Constitutes a Feed-Forward Loop for AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The DHEA-sulfate depot following P450c17 inhibition supports the case for AKR1C3 inhibition in high risk localized and advanced castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dietary Progesterone Contributes to Intratissue Levels of Progesterone in Male Mice.', 'Liver Metastatic Breast Cancer: Epidemiology, Dietary Interventions, and Related Metabolism.', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.', 'Anti-Tumor Effects of Ginsenoside 20(S)-Protopanaxadiol and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Combination in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The Pros and Cons of Low Carbohydrate and Ketogenic Diets in the Prevention and Treatment of Cancer.']"""

The purpose of our study was to analyze the spatial distribution of tumor satellites inside the prostate.  Methods and materials:   61 prostatectomy specimens were stained with H&E. Tumor regions were delineated by the uro-pathologist. Volumes, distances and cell densities of all delineated tumor regions were measured and further analyzed.  Results:   Multifocal disease was seen in 84% of the patients. The median number of tumor foci was 3. The median distance between the index lesion and the satellites was 1.0 cm, with a maximum of 4.4 cm. The index lesions accounted for 88% of the total tumor volume. The contribution of tumor foci<0.1 cm(3) to the total tumor volume was 2%. The median cell density of the index lesion and all satellites, regardless of size, were significantly higher than that of the prostate.  Conclusions:   Satellites do not appear in a limited margin around the index lesion (GTV). Consequently, a fixed CTV margin would not effectively cover all satellites.

Methods:   Human prostate cancer subcutaneous tumours, PC3 and LAPC-4, were grown in nude male mice. When tumours measured 150 mm3 magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONPs) were injected into tumours to a target dose of 5.5 mg Fe/cm3 tumour, and treated 24 h later by exposure to alternating magnetic field (AMF). Mice were randomly assigned to one of four cohorts to characterise (1) intratumour MIONP distribution, (2) effects of variable thermal dose mNPH (fixed AMF peak amplitude 24 kA/m at 160 ± 5 kHz) with/without RT (5 Gy), (3) effects of RT (RT5: 5 Gy; RT8: 8 Gy), and (4) fixed thermal dose mNPH (43 °C for 20 min) with/without RT (5 Gy). MIONP concentration and distribution were assessed following sacrifice and tissue harvest using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Prussian blue staining, respectively. Tumour growth was monitored and compared among treated groups.  Results:   LAPC-4 tumours retained higher MIONP concentration and more uniform distribution than did PC3 tumours. AMF power modulation provided similar thermal dose for mNPH and combination therapy groups (CEM43: LAPC-4: 33.6 ± 3.4 versus 25.9 ± 0.8, and PC3: 27.19 ± 0.7 versus 27.50 ± 0.6), thereby overcoming limitations of MIONP distribution and yielding statistically significant tumour growth delay.  Conclusion:   PC3 and LAPC-4 tumours represent two biological models that demonstrate different patterns of nanoparticle retention and distribution, offering a model to make comparisons of these effects for mNPH. Modulating power for mNPH offers potential to overcome limitations of MIONP distribution to enhance mNPH.""","""['Anilchandra Attaluri', 'Sri Kamal Kandala', 'Michele Wabler', 'Haoming Zhou', 'Christine Cornejo', 'Michael Armour', 'Mohammad Hedayati', 'Yonggang Zhang', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Cila Herman', 'Robert Ivkov']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['Characterization of intratumor magnetic nanoparticle distribution and heating in a rat model of metastatic spine disease.', 'Nanoparticle distribution and temperature elevations in prostatic tumours in mice during magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia.', 'Immunogenetic effects of low dose (CEM43 30) magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia and radiation in melanoma cells.', 'Magnetic nanoparticle-induced hyperthermia with appropriate payloads: Paul Ehrlich\'s ""magic (nano)bullet"" for cancer theranostics?', 'Magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia for prostate cancer.', 'A Review of Advanced Multifunctional Magnetic Nanostructures for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy Integrated into an Artificial Intelligence Approach.', 'Design of a temperature-feedback controlled automated magnetic hyperthermia therapy device.', 'Development of handheld induction heaters for magnetic fluid hyperthermia applications andin-vitroevaluation on ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Validation of a Temperature-Feedback Controlled Automated Magnetic Hyperthermia Therapy Device.', 'Recent Trends and Developments in Multifunctional Nanoparticles for Cancer Theranostics.']"""

Paclitaxel drove an apoptotic pathway in LNCaP, but not in PC3 cells, in response to G2/M arrest. An examination of the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins revealed that Bcl-xl was much higher in PC3 cells than in LNCaP cells and Bcl2 could be detected only in PC3 cells, not in LNCaP cells. Knocking down Bcl-xl enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, while we were unable to knock down Bcl-xl efficiently in PC3 cells. Significantly, a comparison of ABT-263, a specific inhibitor of Bcl2 and Bcl-xl, with ABT-199, a Bcl2 selective inhibitor, disclosed that only ABT-263, not ABT-199, could induce apoptosis in LNCaP and PC3 cells. The results indicate that Bcl-xl has a protective role against paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in LNCaP and PC3 cells, and its overexpression causes the paclitaxel resistance seen in PC3 cells. Interestingly, combined paclitaxel with ABT-263 to treat LNCaP and PC3 cells demonstrated synergistic apoptosis activation, indicating that ABT-263 could enhance paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells and overcome Bcl-xl overexpression to trigger paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells. We also observed that the activation of apoptosis in LNCaP cells was more efficient than in PC3 cells in response to paclitaxel plus ABT-263 or to ABT-263 alone, suggesting that the apoptosis pathway in PC3 cells might have further differences from that in LNCaP cells even after Bcl-xl overexpression is accounted for.""","""['Chihuei Wang', 'Shih-Bo Huang', 'Min-Chi Yang', 'Yi-Tsen Lin', 'I-Hung Chu', 'Ya-Ni Shen', 'Yueh-Ho Chiu', 'Shao-Hung Hung', 'Lin Kang', 'Yi-Ren Hong', 'Chung-Hwan Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Bim directly antagonizes Bcl-xl in doxorubicin-induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis independently of p53.', 'Bcl-2 family inhibition sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to docetaxel and promotes unexpected apoptosis under caspase-9 inhibition.', 'Navitoclax (ABT-263) accelerates apoptosis during drug-induced mitotic arrest by antagonizing Bcl-xL.', 'ΔN-Bcl-xL, a therapeutic target for neuroprotection.', 'Mechanisms of cancer cell death induction by paclitaxel: an updated review.', 'SIRT1 inhibition-induced senescence as a strategy to prevent prostate cancer progression.', 'Targeting the Intrinsic Apoptosis Pathway: A Window of Opportunity for Prostate Cancer.', 'BH3-mimetics: recent developments in cancer therapy.', 'Caryophyllene Oxide, the Active Compound Isolated from Leaves of Hymenaea courbaril L.

GnRHRs have been found in extra-pituitary tissues, including prostate, which may be affected by the GnRH and GnRH analogues used in therapy. The direct effect of degarelix on human prostate cell growth was evaluated. Normal prostate myofibroblast WPMY-1 and epithelial WPE1-NA22 cells, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-1 cells, androgen-independent PC-3 and androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells, as well as VCaP cells derived from a patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer were used. Discriminatory protein and lipid fingerprints of normal, hyperplastic, and cancer cells were generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS). The investigated cell lines express GNRHR1 and GNRHR2 and their endogenous ligands. Degarelix treatment reduced cell viability in all prostate cell lines tested, with the exception of the PC-3 cells; this can be attributed to increased apoptosis, as indicated by increased caspase 3/7, 8 and 9 levels. WPE1-NA22, BPH-1, LNCaP, and VCaP cell viability was not affected by treatment with the GnRH agonists leuprolide and goserelin. Using MALDI MS, we detected changes in m/z signals that were robust enough to create a complete discriminatory profile induced by degarelix. Transcriptomic analysis of BPH-1 cells provided a global map of genes affected by degarelix and indicated that the biological processes affected were related to cell growth, G-coupled receptors, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, angiogenesis and cell adhesion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that (i) the GnRH antagonist degarelix exerts a direct effect on prostate cell growth through apoptosis; (ii) MALDI MS analysis provided a basis to fingerprint degarelix-treated prostate cells; and (iii) the clusters of genes affected by degarelix suggest that this compound, in addition to its known use in the treatment of prostate cancer, may be efficacious in BPH.""","""['Monica Sakai', 'Daniel B Martinez-Arguelles', 'Nathan H Patterson', 'Pierre Chaurand', 'Vassilios Papadopoulos']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The GnRH Antagonist Degarelix Directly Inhibits Benign Prostate Hyperplasia Cell Growth.', 'GnRH Antagonists Have Direct Inhibitory Effects On Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Via Intracrine Androgen and AR-V7 Expression.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for volume reduction, lower urinary tract symptom relief and quality of life improvement in patients with prostate cancer: degarelix vs goserelin plus bicalutamide.', 'Degarelix: a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist for the management of prostate cancer.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist: A real advantage?', 'Zhoushi Qiling decoction induces apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells via miR-143/Bcl-2 axis.', 'Dissecting the Hormonal Signaling Landscape in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors in Prostate Cancer: Molecular Aspects and Biological Functions.', 'GnRH antagonist treatment of malignant adrenocortical tumors.', 'Automated analysis of lipid drug-response markers by combined fast and high-resolution whole cell MALDI mass spectrometry biotyping.']"""

Studies in GH-treated childhood cancer survivors suggested higher rates of second neoplasms, while cancer risk data for GH-treated and untreated hypopituitary adults have been variable. We present primary cancer risk data from the Hypopituitary Control and Complications Study (HypoCCS) with a focus on specific cancers, and assessment of recurrence rates for pituitary adenomas (PA) and craniopharyngiomas (CP).  Design:   Incident neoplasms during HypoCCS were evaluated in 8418 GH-treated vs 1268 untreated patients for primary malignancies, 3668 GH-treated vs 720 untreated patients with PA history, and 956 GH-treated vs 102 untreated patients with CP history.  Methods:   Using population cancer rates, standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for all primary cancers, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Neoplasm rates in GH-treated vs untreated patients were analysed after propensity score adjustment of baseline treatment group imbalances.  Results:   During mean follow-up of 4.8 years, 225 primary cancers were identified in GH-treated patients, with SIR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.93). SIRs (95% CI) for GH-treated patients were 0.59 (0.36-0.90) for breast, 0.80 (0.57-1.10) for prostate, and 0.62 (0.38-0.96) for colorectal cancers. Cancer risk was not statistically different between GH-treated and untreated patients (relative risk (RR)=1.00 (95% CI 0.70-1.41), P=0.98).

Methods:   We investigated whether the ability to replicate findings for these 104 SNPs in African American, Asian, and Latino populations depends on variation in risk allele frequencies (RAF), strength of associations, and/or patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) at the associated loci. We extracted estimates of effect from the literature, and determined RAF and LD information across the populations from the 1000 Genomes Project.  Results:   Risk variants were largely replicated across populations. Relative to Europeans, 83% had smaller effect sizes among African Americans and 73% demonstrated smaller effect sizes among Latinos. Among Asians, however, 56% showed larger effect sizes than among Europeans. The largest difference in RAFs was observed between European and African ancestry populations, but this difference did not impact our ability to replicate. The extent of LD within 250 kb of risk loci in Asian ancestry populations was suggestively lower for variants that did not replicate (P = 0.013).

Most patients received therapeutic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; cycle 1: 86.4 %; cycle 2 or later: 81.8 %). In the efficacy population, two of 12 patients with measurable disease had partial response (objective response rate: 16.7 %), while 10 had stable disease. PSA response rate was 29.3 % (12/41 patients). Median time to PSA progression was 3.68 months (95 % confidence interval 1.35-4.63).  Conclusions:   In this heavily pretreated Japanese population, the occurrence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia was high, suggesting G-CSF prophylaxis may be required as part of toxicity management. However, the efficacy of cabazitaxel was consistent with global studies.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 4,610 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 1990 and 2011. Patients were stratified by biopsy Gleason score and PSA value. For each stratification, χ2 analysis was used to determine the smallest 15-day multiple of surgical delay (e.g., 15, 30, 45…180 days) for which adverse pathologic outcomes were significantly more likely after the time interval than before. Adverse outcomes were defined as positive surgical margins, upgrading from biopsy, upstaging, seminal vesicle invasion, or positive lymph nodes.  Results:   Two thousand two hundred twelve patients met inclusion criteria. Median delay was 64 days (mean 76, SD 47). One thousand six hundred seventy-five (75.7%), 537 (24.3%), and 60 (2.7%) patients had delays of <=90, >90, and >180 days, respectively. Twenty-six percent were upgraded on final pathology and 23% were upstaged. The positive surgical margin rate was 24.2% and the positive lymph node rate was 1.1%. Significant increases in the proportion of adverse pathological outcomes were found beyond 75 days in the overall cohort (P = 0.03), 150 days for patients with Gleason <=6, and PSA 0-10 (P = 0.038), 60 days for patients with Gleason 7 and PSA >20 (P = 0.032), and 30 days for patients with Gleason 8-10 and PSA 11-20 (0.041).

Structure and remodeling of epithelial junctions depends on their association with the underlying actomyosin cytoskeleton. Anillin is a unique scaffolding protein interacting with different cytoskeletal components, including actin filaments and myosin motors. Its role in the regulation of mammalian epithelial junctions remains unexplored. Downregulation of anillin expression in human prostate, colonic, and lung epithelial cells triggered AJ and TJ disassembly without altering the expression of junctional proteins. This junctional disassembly was accompanied by dramatic disorganization of the perijunctional actomyosin belt; while the general architecture of the actin cytoskeleton, and activation status of non-muscle myosin II, remained unchanged. Furthermore, loss of anillin disrupted the adducin-spectrin membrane skeleton at the areas of cell-cell contact, selectively decreased γ-adducin expression, and induced cytoplasmic aggregation of αII-spectrin. Anillin knockdown activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and JNK inhibition restored AJ and TJ integrity and cytoskeletal organization in anillin-depleted cells. These findings suggest a novel role for anillin in regulating intercellular adhesion in model human epithelia by mechanisms involving the suppression of JNK activity and controlling the assembly of the perijunctional cytoskeleton.""","""['Dongdong Wang#', 'Gibran K Chadha#', 'Alex Feygin', 'Andrei I Ivanov']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Mol Life Sci""","""['Actin-interacting protein 1 controls assembly and permeability of intestinal epithelial apical junctions.', 'Adducins regulate remodeling of apical junctions in human epithelial cells.', 'Anillin regulates cell-cell junction integrity by organizing junctional accumulation of Rho-GTP and actomyosin.', 'RhoGTPases, actomyosin signaling and regulation of the epithelial Apical Junctional Complex.', 'Rho GTPases and actomyosin: Partners in regulating epithelial cell-cell junction structure and function.', 'Anillin governs mitotic rounding during early epidermal development.', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cortical Mechanics and Clinical Implications.', 'Cytoskeleton and Associated Proteins: Pleiotropic JNK Substrates and Regulators.', 'Transcriptomic Profiling of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Retinal Pigment Epithelium over Time.', 'ERG-Associated lncRNA (ERGAL) Promotes the Stability and Integrity of Vascular Endothelial Barrier During Dengue Viral Infection via Interaction With miR-183-5p.']"""

Gene rearrangements involving ETS transcription factors are frequent pathogenetic somatic events observed in PCa. Incidence of ETS rearrangements in Caucasian PCa patients has been reported, however, occurrence in Indian population is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the ETS and RAF kinase gene rearrangements, SPINK1 over-expression, and PTEN deletion in this cohort.  Methods:   In this multi-center study, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) PCa specimens (n = 121) were procured from four major medical institutions in India. The tissues were sectioned and molecular profiling was done using immunohistochemistry (IHC), RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  Results:   ERG over-expression was detected in 48.9% (46/94) PCa specimens by IHC, which was confirmed in a subset of cases by FISH. Among other ETS family members, while ETV1 transcript was detected in one case by RNA-ISH, no alteration in ETV4 was observed. SPINK1 over-expression was observed in 12.5% (12/96) and PTEN deletion in 21.52% (17/79) of the total PCa cases. Interestingly, PTEN deletion was found in 30% of the ERG-positive cases (P = 0.017) but in only one case with SPINK1 over-expression (P = 0.67). BRAF and RAF1 gene rearrangements were detected in ∼1% and ∼4.5% of the PCa cases, respectively.  Conclusions:   This is the first report on comprehensive molecular profiling of the major spectrum of the causal aberrations in Indian men with PCa. Our findings suggest that ETS gene rearrangement and SPINK1 over-expression patterns in North Indian population largely resembled those observed in Caucasian population but differed from Japanese and Chinese PCa patients.

While this behavior occurs independently of thermally-induced processes, therapeutic ablation of targeted tissues with IRE uses a series of brief electric pulses, whose parameters result in secondary Joule heating of the tissue. Where contemporary clinical pulse protocols use aggressive energy regimes, additional evidence is supplementing original studies that assert care must be taken in clinical ablation protocols to ensure the cumulative thermal effects do not induce damage that will alter outcomes for therapies using the IRE non-thermal cell death process for tissue ablation. In this letter, we seek to clarify the nomenclature regarding IRE as a non-thermal ablation technique, as well as identify existing literature that uses experimental, clinical, and numerical results to discretely address and evaluate the thermal considerations relevant when applying IRE in clinical scenarios, including several approaches for reducing these effects. Existing evidence in the literature describes cell response to electric fields, suggesting cell death from IRE is a unique process, independent from traditional thermal damage. Numerical simulations, as well as preclinical and clinical findings demonstrate the ability to deliver therapeutic IRE ablation without occurrence of morbidity associated with thermal therapies. Clinical IRE therapy generates thermal effects, which may moderate the non-thermal aspects of IRE ablation. Appropriate protocol development, utilization, and pulse delivery devices may be implemented to restrain these effects and maintain IRE as the vastly predominant tissue death modality, reducing therapy-mitigating thermal damage. Clinical applications of IRE should consider thermal effects and employ protocols to ensure safe and effective therapy delivery.""","""['Rafael V Davalos', 'Suyashree Bhonsle', 'Robert E Neal nd']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Irreversible electroporation: just another form of thermal therapy?', 'Evaluation of thermal injury to liver, pancreas and kidney during irreversible electroporation in an in vivo experimental model.', 'In vivo characterization and numerical simulation of prostate properties for non-thermal irreversible electroporation ablation.', 'A preliminary study to delineate irreversible electroporation from thermal damage using the arrhenius equation.', 'Irreversible electroporation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a primer for the radiologist.', 'Introduction to Irreversible Electroporation--Principles and Techniques.', 'Palliative Treatment of Esophageal Cancer Using Calcium Electroporation.', 'Characteristics of pulsed electric field cardiac ablation porcine treatment zones with a focal catheter.', 'Lung Ablation with Irreversible Electroporation Promotes Immune Cell Infiltration by Sparing Extracellular Matrix Proteins and Vasculature: Implications for Immunotherapy.', 'Determining tissue conductivity in tissue ablation by nanosecond pulsed electric fields.', 'Feasibility and effectiveness of endoscopic irreversible electroporation for the upper gastrointestinal tract: an experimental animal study.']"""

Here, we present evidence that prostate cancer stem-like cells (CSC) can be found in histopathologically negative prostate draining lymph nodes (PDLN) in mice harboring oncogene-driven prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN). PDLN-derived CSCs were phenotypically and functionally identical to CSC obtained from mPIN lesions, but distinct from CSCs obtained from frank prostate tumors. CSC derived from either PDLN or mPIN used the extracellular matrix protein Tenascin-C (TNC) to inhibit T-cell receptor-dependent T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. Mechanistically, TNC interacted with α5β1 integrin on the cell surface of T cells, inhibiting reorganization of the actin-based cytoskeleton therein required for proper T-cell activation. CSC from both PDLN and mPIN lesions also expressed CXCR4 and migrated in response to its ligand CXCL12, which was overexpressed in PDLN upon mPIN development. CXCR4 was critical for the development of PDLN-derived CSC, as in vivo administration of CXCR4 inhibitors prevented establishment in PDLN of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Taken together, our work establishes a pivotal role for TNC in tuning the local immune response to establish equilibrium between disseminated nodal CSC and the immune system.""","""['Elena Jachetti', 'Sara Caputo', 'Stefania Mazzoleni', 'Chiara Svetlana Brambillasca', 'Sara Martina Parigi', 'Matteo Grioni', 'Ignazio Stefano Piras', 'Umberto Restuccia', 'Arianna Calcinotto', 'Massimo Freschi', 'Angela Bachi', 'Rossella Galli', 'Matteo Bellone']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Galectin-3 in Prostate Cancer Stem-Like Cells Is Immunosuppressive and Drives Early Metastasis.', 'Concise Review: Targeting Cancer Stem Cells Using Immunologic Approaches.', 'The lack of epithelial interleukin-7 and BAFF/BLyS gene expression in prostate cancer as a possible mechanism of tumor escape from immunosurveillance.', 'Extracellular matrix of glioblastoma inhibits polarization and transmigration of T cells: the role of tenascin-C in immune suppression.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells and their potential roles in metastasis.', 'Extracellular matrix remodeling in tumor progression and immune escape: from mechanisms to treatments.', 'Multi-omics characterization of silent and productive HPV integration in cervical cancer.', 'Recent Advances in the Role of Autophagy in Endocrine-Dependent Tumors.', 'Heterogeneity of glioblastoma stem cells in the context of the immune microenvironment and geospatial organization.', 'Targeting the tumor stroma for cancer therapy.']"""

Here, we demonstrate that knockdown of PLZF expression promotes a CRPC and enzalutamide-resistant phenotype in prostate cancer cells. Reintroduction of PLZF expression is sufficient to reverse androgen-independent growth mediated by PLZF depletion. PLZF loss enhances CRPC tumor growth in a xenograft model. Bioinformatic analysis of the PLZF cistrome shows that PLZF negatively regulates multiple pathways, including the MAPK pathway. Accordingly, our data support an oncogenic program activated by ADT.

However, the mechanisms underlying tumor suppressive function of EAF2 are still largely unknown. Identification of factors capable of modulating EAF2 function will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying EAF2 tumor suppressive function.  Methods:   Using eaf-1(the ortholog of EAF2) mutant C. elegans model, RNAi screen was used to identify factors on the basis of their knockdown to synergistically enhance the reduced fertility phenotype of the eaf-1 mutant C. elegans. In human cells, the interaction of EAF2 with FOXA1 and the effect of EAF2 on the FOXA1 protein levels were determined by co-immunoprecipitation and protein stability assay. The effect of EAF2 and/or FOXA1 knockdown on the expression of AR-target genes was determined by real-time RT-PCR and luciferase reporter assays. The effect of EAF2 and/or FOXA1 knockdown on LNCaP human prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration was tested using BrdU assay and transwell migration assay.  Results:   RNAi screen identified pha-4, the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian FOXA1, on the basis of its knockdown to synergistically enhance the reduced fertility phenotype of the eaf-1 mutant C. elegans causing sterility. EAF2 co-immunoprecipitated with FOXA1. EAF2 knockdown enhanced endogenous FOXA1 protein level, whereas transfected GFP-EAF2 down-regulated the FOXA1 protein. Also, EAF2 knockdown enhanced the expression of AR-target genes, cell proliferation, and migration in LNCaP cells. However, FOXA1 knockdown inhibited the effect of EAF2 knockdown on AR-target gene expression, cell proliferation, and migration in LNCaP cells, suggesting that FOXA1 can modulate EAF2 regulation of AR transcriptional activation, cell proliferation, and migration.

More than half of the biopsies turn out to be negative for prostate cancer (CaP). The limitations of both the PSA test and the biopsy procedure have led to the development for more precise CaP detection assays in urine (e.g., PCA3, TMPRSS2-ERG) or blood (e.g., PHI, 4K). Here, we describe the development and evaluation of the Urine CaP Marker Panel (UCMP) assay for sensitive and reproducible detection of CaP cells in post-digital rectal examination (post-DRE) urine.  Methods:   The cellular content of the post-DRE urine was captured on a translucent filter membrane, which is placed on Cytoclear slides for direct evaluation by microscopy and immuno-cytochemistry (ICC). Cells captured on the membrane were assayed for PSA and Prostein expression to identify prostate epithelial cells, and for ERG and AMACR to identify prostate tumor cells. Immunostained cells were analyzed for quantitative and qualitative features and correlated with biopsy positive and negative status for malignancy.  Results:   The assay was optimized for single cell capture sensitivity and downstream evaluations by spiking a known number of cells from established CaP cell lines, LNCaP and VCaP, into pre-cleared control urine. The cells captured from the post-DRE urine of subjects, obtained prior to biopsy procedure, were co-stained for ERG, AMACR (CaP specific), and Prostein or PSA (prostate epithelium specific) rendering a whole cell based analysis and characterization. A feasibility cohort of 63 post-DRE urine specimens was assessed. Comparison of the UCMP results with blinded biopsy results showed an assay sensitivity of 64% (16 of 25) and a specificity of 68.8% (22 of 32) for CaP detection by biopsy.  Conclusions:   This pilot study assessing a minimally invasive CaP detection assay with single cell sensitivity cell-capture and characterization from the post-DRE urine holds promise for further development of this novel assay platform.

Methods:   The study group comprised 36 patients with a median age of 72 years (range 48-90 years) who were treated with enzalutamide 160 mg once daily after at least one chemotherapeutic regimen with docetaxel. Patients were evaluated monthly for serological prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. FCH PET/CT was performed at baseline and repeated after 3-6 weeks. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models addressed potential predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   At a median follow-up of 24.2 months (range 1.8-27.3 months), 34 patients were evaluable for early FCH PET/CT evaluation of response, and of these 17 showed progressive disease (PD) and 17 had stable disease or a partial response. A decrease in PSA level of more than 50% was observed in 21 patients. Early FCH PET/CT PD predicted radiological PD 3 months in advance of CT in 12 of 18 patients (66%) and was discordant with the decrease in PSA level in 13 patients. In 6 of these, biochemical PD was confirmed in 2 months. In multivariate analysis, only decrease in PSA level and FCH PET/CT were significant predictors of PFS (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.029, respectively), whereas decrease in PSA level alone was predictive of OS (p = 0.007).  Conclusion:   This is one of the first studies to evaluate the role of FCH PET/CT as an early predictor of outcome in mCRPC patients treated with enzalutamide. Our preliminary results suggest that the combination of FCH PET/CT and decrease in PSA level could be a valid tool to predict PFS in mCRPC patients. PSA remains the single most important prognostic factor, while FCH PET/CT does not add more information on OS beyond that obtained from PSA. Further studies in larger populations are needed to confirm these data and to clarify the role of FCH PET/CT in predicting response to enzalutamide in mCRPC patients.""","""['Ugo De Giorgi', 'Paola Caroli', 'Emanuela Scarpi', 'Vincenza Conteduca', 'Salvatore Luca Burgio', 'Cecilia Menna', 'Andrea Moretti', 'Riccardo Galassi', 'Lorena Rossi', 'Dino Amadori', 'Giovanni Paganelli', 'Federica Matteucci']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Erratum to: (18)F-Fluorocholine PET/CT for early response assessment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with enzalutamide.', 'Prognostic value of 18F-choline PET/CT metabolic parameters in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide.', 'Early outcome prediction on 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone.', 'Serial 18F-choline-PET imaging in patients receiving enzalutamide for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: response assessment and imaging biomarkers.', 'A Case of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with Fatal Convulsive Seizure after Administration of Enzalutamide.', '¹⁸F-fluoromethylcholine or ¹⁸F-fluoroethylcholine pet for prostate cancer imaging: which is better?

The effects of the triple application of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA), the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus and low dosed interferon alpha (IFNα) on PCa cell growth and dissemination capacity were investigated. For that purpose, the human PCa cell lines, PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP were treated with the combined regimen or separate single agents. Cell growth was investigated by the MTT dye reduction assay. Flow cytometry served to analyse cell cycle progression. Adhesion to vascular endothelium or immobilized collagen, fibronectin and laminin was quantified. Migration and invasion characteristics were determined by the modified Boyden chamber assay. Integrin α and β subtypes were investigated by flow cytometry, western blotting and RT-PCR. Integrin related signalling, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFr), Akt, p70S6kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 activation were also assessed. The triple application of VPA, everolimus and low dosed IFNα blocked tumour cell growth and dissemination significantly better than any agent alone.

Here, we addressed a compelling question: Does Runx2 regulate IL-11 gene expression? We find a positive correlation between Runx2, IL-11 and TGFβ1, a driver of the vicious cycle of metastatic bone disease, in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines representing early (LNCaP) and late (PC3) stage disease. Further, like Runx2 knockdown, IL-11 knockdown significantly reduced expression of several osteolytic factors. Modulation of Runx2 expression results in corresponding changes in IL-11 expression. The IL-11 gene has Runx2, AP-1 sites and Smad binding elements located on the IL-11 promoter. Here, we demonstrated that Runx2-c-Jun as well as Runx2-Smad complexes upregulate IL-11 expression. Functional studies identified a significant loss of IL-11 expression in PC3 cells in the presence of the Runx2-HTY mutant protein, a mutation that disrupts Runx2-Smad signaling. In response to TGFβ1 and in the presence of Runx2, we observed a 30-fold induction of IL-11 expression, accompanied by increased c-Jun binding to the IL-11 promoter. Immunoprecipitation and in situ co-localization studies demonstrated that Runx2 and c-Jun form nuclear complexes in PC3 cells. Thus, TGFβ1 signaling induces two independent transcriptional pathways - AP-1 and Runx2. These transcriptional activators converge on IL-11 as a result of Runx2-Smad and Runx2-c-Jun interactions to amplify IL-11 gene expression that, together with Runx2, supports the osteolytic pathology of cancer induced bone disease.""","""['Xuhui Zhang', 'Hai Wu', 'Jason R Dobson', 'Gillian Browne', 'Deli Hong', 'Jacqueline Akech', 'Lucia R Languino', 'Gary S Stein', 'Jane B Lian']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Runx2 transcriptional activation of Indian Hedgehog and a downstream bone metastatic pathway in breast cancer cells.', 'Runx2 association with progression of prostate cancer in patients: mechanisms mediating bone osteolysis and osteoblastic metastatic lesions.', 'Integrin αvβ3 and CD44 pathways in metastatic prostate cancer cells support osteoclastogenesis via a Runx2/Smad 5/receptor activator of NF-κB ligand signaling axis.', 'Smad-Runx interactions during chondrocyte maturation.', 'Regulatory roles of Runx2 in metastatic tumor and cancer cell interactions with bone.', 'Interleukin 11 (IL-11): Role(s) in Breast Cancer Bone Metastases.', 'Lutein attenuates angiotensin II- induced cardiac remodeling by inhibiting AP-1/IL-11 signaling.', 'Identification of sequence-specific interactions of the CD44-intracellular domain with RUNX2 in the transcription of matrix metalloprotease-9 in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Historical overview of the interleukin-6 family cytokine.', 'The expression analysis of Fra-1 gene and IL-11 protein in Iranian patients with ulcerative colitis.']"""

PARP-1: New player in tumor progression""","""Prostate cancer (PCa) displays infrequent point mutations, whereas genomic rearrangements are highly prevalent. In eukaryotes, the genome is compartmentalized into chromatin loop domains by the attachment to the nuclear matrix (NM), and it has been demonstrated that several recombination hot spots are situated at the base of loops. Here, we have characterized the binding between NM proteins and matrix attachment regions (MARs) in PCa. Nontumor and 44 PCa tissues were analyzed. More aggressive tumors were characterized by an increase in the complexity of the NM protein patterns that was synchronous with a decrease in the number of proteins binding the MAR sequences. PARP-1 was the protein that showed the most evident changes. The expression of the PARP-1 associated with NM increased and it was dependent on tumor aggressiveness. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the protein was significantly overexpressed in tumor cells. To explore the role of PARP-1 in PCa progression, PCa cells were treated with the PARP inhibitor, ABT-888. In androgen-independent PC3 cells, PARP inhibition significantly decreased cell viability, migration, invasion, chromatin loop dimensions and histone acetylation. Collectively, our study provides evidence that MAR-binding proteins are involved in the development and progression of PCa. PARP could play a key role in the compartmentalization of chromatin and in the development of the more aggressive phenotype. Thus, PARP can no longer be viewed only as an enzyme involved in DNA repair, but that its role in chromatin modulation could provide the basis for a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of PCa.""","""['Paola Barboro', 'Nicoletta Ferrari', 'Matteo Capaia', 'Andrea Petretto', 'Sandra Salvi', 'Simona Boccardo', 'Cecilia Balbi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Re: Expression of Nuclear Matrix Proteins Binding Matrix Attachment Regions in Prostate Cancer.

Profiling these early mitochondrial lineages allows for better understanding of modern human evolution. In this study, we profile 77 new early-diverged complete mitochondrial genomes and sub-classify another 105 L0d/L0k individuals from southern Africa. We use this data to refine basal phylogenetic divergence, coalescence times and Khoesan prehistory. Our results confirm L0d as the earliest diverged lineage (∼172 kya, 95%CI: 149-199 kya), followed by L0k (∼159 kya, 95%CI: 136-183 kya) and a new lineage we name L0g (∼94 kya, 95%CI: 72-116 kya). We identify two new L0d1 subclades we name L0d1d and L0d1c4/L0d1e, and estimate L0d2 and L0d1 divergence at ∼93 kya (95%CI:76-112 kya). We concur the earliest emerging L0d1'2 sublineage L0d1b (∼49 kya, 95%CI:37-58 kya) is widely distributed across southern Africa. Concomitantly, we find the most recent sublineage L0d2a (∼17 kya, 95%CI:10-27 kya) to be equally common. While we agree that lineages L0d1c and L0k1a are restricted to contemporary inland Khoesan populations, our observed predominance of L0d2a and L0d1a in non-Khoesan populations suggests a once independent coastal Khoesan prehistory. The distribution of early-diverged human maternal lineages within contemporary southern Africans suggests a rich history of human existence prior to any archaeological evidence of migration into the region. For the first time, we provide a genetic-based evidence for significant modern human evolution in southern Africa at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum at between ∼21-17 kya, coinciding with the emergence of major lineages L0d1a, L0d2b, L0d2d and L0d2a.""","""['Eva K F Chan', 'Rae-Anne Hardie', 'Desiree C Petersen', 'Karen Beeson', 'Riana M S Bornman', 'Andrew B Smith', 'Vanessa M Hayes']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Human origins in a southern African palaeo-wetland and first migrations.', 'First ancient mitochondrial human genome from a prepastoralist southern African.', 'Complex patterns of genomic admixture within southern Africa.', 'African human mtDNA phylogeography at-a-glance.', 'The evolutionary history of Southern Africa.', 'Population Structure and Implications on the Genetic Architecture of HIV-1 Phenotypes Within Southern Africa.', 'Carriers of mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup L3 basal lineages migrated back to Africa from Asia around 70,000 years ago.', 'Mitochondrial genome variation and prostate cancer: a review of the mutational landscape and application to clinical management.', 'Genomic landscape of human diversity across Madagascar.', 'Spectrum of mitochondrial genomic variation and associated clinical presentation of prostate cancer in South African men.']"""

Down-regulation of PLZF has been found in various tumor cell lines. There has been virtually no tissue study on the expression of PLZF in prostate cancer (PCa). PCa is a heterogeneous disease, most of which are indolent and non-lethal. Currently there are no biomarkers that distinguish indolent from aggressive PCa; therefore there is an urgent need for such markers to provide clinical decision support. This study aimed to investigate the expression of PLZF by immunohistochemistry in different grade as well as metastatic PCa and to correlate the alteration of PLZF expression with PCa aggressiveness. We studied a total of 83 primary PCa from biopsies, 43 metastatic PCa and 8 paired primary and metastatic PCa from radical prostatectomies with lymph node dissection. Our results demonstrated that PLZF was strongly expressed in almost all (~100%) benign luminal cells (n=77) and low grade (Gleason pattern 3) PCa (n=70) and weak or absent (100%) in basal cells (n=70). Decreased or lost expression of PLZF was evidenced in 26% of high-grade (Gleason 4 and 5) primary PCa (n=70) and 84% metastatic PCa (n=43). The primary high grade PCa in the prostatectomies shared similar PLZF loss/decrease and histomorphology to that of paired parallel lymph node metastases. These data demonstrated that down-regulation of PLZF is an important molecular process for tumor progression and loss of PLZF expression detected by routine immunohistochemistry is a promising and valuable biomarker for PCa aggressiveness and metastasis in the personalized care of PCa.""","""['Guang-Qian Xiao', 'Pamela Unger', 'Qi Yang', 'Yayoi Kinoshita', 'Kyra Singh', 'Loralee McMahon', 'Kent Nastiuk', 'Kai Sha', 'John Krolewski', 'David Burstein']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Down-regulation of cytoplasmic PLZF correlates with high tumor grade and tumor aggression in non-small cell lung carcinoma.', 'SPINK1 expression in relation to PTEN and ERG in matched primary and lymph node metastatic prostate cancer: Implications for biomarker development.', 'Expression of spermidine/spermine N(1) -acetyl transferase (SSAT) in human prostate tissues is related to prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'De novo large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate gland with pelvic lymph node metastasis: a case report with review of literature.', 'Enhanced ZBTB16 Levels by Progestin-Only Contraceptives Induces Decidualization and Inflammation.', 'Differential DNA Methylation by Hispanic Ethnicity Among Firefighters in the United States.', 'HOXB13 and TFF3 can contribute to the prognostic stratification of prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Functional mapping of androgen receptor enhancer activity.', 'Extracellular vesicle derived miR-544 downregulates expression of tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger resulting in increased peritoneal metastasis in gastric cancer.']"""

Prostate cancer is a major medical problem that needs immediate attention as the disease is indolent, shows prolonged latency in association with high morbidity and mortality. Administration of diagnostic tests including PSA test and biopsies and the advances in other diagnostic procedures have led to early detection of the disease with therapeutic steps being taken early on, there has been a steady decline in the disease-specific mortality. Global incidence and mortality rates show that the disease is more prevalent among black people, even though the differences cannot be attributed entirely to race, as the influence of socioeconomic situation and the resultant limited access to medical technologies and treatment could not be ruled out completely. Several genes have been identified that when mutated confer high risk for the disease.

Nonetheless, the number of paleopathological cases reported is very small. Most of them were identified in Europe, and only two came from South American individuals. The purpose of this paper is to document the lesions identified in a pre-Columbian (around 1400 AD) individual that corresponds to a middle adult male from Pukara de la Cueva, Jujuy province, in the Northwest region of Argentina. The skeleton was found disarticulated but it is nearly complete and well preserved. The general character of the lesions observed is predominantly proliferative in nature, but osteolytic and mixed patterns were also detected in both axial and appendicular skeleton. Macroscopically, this overall pattern and the distribution of the lesions are compatible with a secondary cancer. Radiological examination showed multiple dense and irregular areas in several bones. The lesions visible by external inspection and by radiographs are in concordance with changes which are documented to occur in the course of prostatic carcinoma. The exuberance and dissemination of the lesions all over the skeleton led infer individual cachexy implying that he would have been assisted by his family and/or social group during the chronic process. Different carcinogenic risk factors associated to this kind of disease are discussed.

Materials and methods:   Between March 1995 and September 2007, 2157 consecutive patients with localised prostate cancer underwent I-125 permanent prostate brachytherapy as monotherapy in a single UK centre. All patients were transrectal ultrasound planned delivering a 145 Gy (TG 43) minimum peripheral dose. None received supplemental external beam radiotherapy. Post-implant computed tomography-based dosimetry was undertaken between 4 and 6 weeks after treatment and was available for 711 (33%). Outcomes were analysed in terms of the relationship of D90 to prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival (nadir 2+ definition) and all patients had a minimum follow-up of 5 years. For contemporary patients from 2011, quality metrics from post-implant computed tomography as defined by RCR guidelines are presented.  Results:   A mean D90 of 138.7 Gy (standard deviation 24.7) was achieved for the historic cohort. Biochemical control at 10 years was 76% in patients with D90 > 140 Gy and 68% in those with D90 < 140 Gy (P < 0.01). In current practice, over the last 3 years the mean (standard deviation) D90 has increased from 154 (15.3) Gy in 2011 to 164 (13.5) Gy in 2013. Similarly, an increase in the mean (standard deviation) V100 from 92 (4.4) to 95 (3.2) % is noted over time. No difference between clinicians was noted.  Conclusion:   D90 values of less than 140 Gy continue to be predictive of increased risk of recurrence of prostate cancer across risk groups with longer follow-up.

Most single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cancer risk lie in non-protein-coding regions, implicating regulatory DNA elements as functional targets of susceptibility variants. Here, we describe genome-wide annotation of regions of open chromatin and histone modification in fallopian tube and ovarian surface epithelial cells (FTSECs, OSECs), the debated cellular origins of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) and in endometriosis epithelial cells (EECs), the likely precursor of clear cell ovarian carcinomas (CCOCs). The regulatory architecture of these cell types was compared with normal human mammary epithelial cells and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. We observed similar positional patterns of global enhancer signatures across the three different ovarian cancer precursor cell types, and evidence of tissue-specific regulatory signatures compared to non-gynecological cell types. We found significant enrichment for risk-associated SNPs intersecting regulatory biofeatures at 17 known HGSOC susceptibility loci in FTSECs (P = 3.8 × 10(-30)), OSECs (P = 2.4 × 10(-23)) and HMECs (P = 6.7 × 10(-15)) but not for EECs (P = 0.45) or LNCaP cells (P = 0.88). Hierarchical clustering of risk SNPs conditioned on the six different cell types indicates FTSECs and OSECs are highly related (96% of samples using multi-scale bootstrapping) suggesting both cell types may be precursors of HGSOC.

Although it is clear that chronic inflammation is a risk factor for colorectal cancer, the details remain uncertain. Serine protease inhibitor, Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) is mainly produced in pancreatic acinar cells. However, SPINK1 is expressed in various cancers and in inflammatory states, such as colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. There are structural similarities between SPINK1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Hence, it was hypothesized that SPINK1 functions as a growth factor for tissue repair in inflammatory states, and if prolonged, acts as a promoter for cell proliferation in cancerous tissues. Here, immunohistochemical staining for SPINK1 was observed in a high percentage of colorectal cancer patient specimens and SPINK1 induced proliferation of human colon cancer cell lines. To clarify its role in colon cancer in vivo, a mouse model exposed to the colon carcinogen azoxymethane and nongenotoxic carcinogen dextran sodium sulfate revealed that Spink3 (mouse homolog of SPINK1) is overexpressed in cancerous tissues. In Spink3 heterozygous mice, tumor multiplicity and tumor volume were significantly decreased compared with wild-type mice. These results suggest that SPINK1/Spink3 stimulates the proliferation of colon cancer cells and is involved in colorectal cancer progression.

Materials and methods:   A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all French urologists and radiation oncologists. Respondents were asked about their practices through 11 case scenarios. The scenarios cover most of localized prostate cancer situations and were gradually organized depending on prostate cancer progression risk and the age of the patient. The eight first scenarios address the situation of treatment-naive patients, and the last cases were about the management of patients after radical prostatectomy. Physicians were asked to choose a treatment modality for each case. The responses were first stratified according to the intention to treat: either curative-intent treatment or palliative. The curative-treatment modality chosen were afterward assessed. The responses to clinical scenarios were compared between the two specialties.  Results:   Concerning the intention to treat, practice patterns were overall consistent except in one case. Indeed, a higher rate of radiation oncologists prefer curative-intent treatment for intermediate-risk prostate cancer in aged patients: 57.4 versus 14.6 % (p < 0.001). Each medical specialist prefers the treatment that he himself delivers (p < 0.005). For intermediate-risk prostate cancer in 65-year-old patient: 96.5 % of urologists chose radical prostatectomy versus 37.7 % of radiation oncologists (p < 0.001). Fewer urologists (almost 14 %) compared to radiation oncologists (47.5 %) would prescribe adjuvant treatment after radical prostatectomy for T3a R0 prostate cancer with post-operative PSA undetectable (p < 0.001).

Methods:   Patients enrolled in the global PRIAS study with baseline %fPSA available were included. Putative baseline predictors (e.g. PSA, %fPSA) of adverse rebiopsy findings were explored using logistic regression analysis. Association of variables with treatment change and RP findings over time were evaluated with Cox regression analysis. Active treatment-free survival was assessed with a Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Of 3701 patients recruited to PRIAS, 939 had %fPSA measured at study entry. Four hundred and thirty-eight of them had %fPSA available after 1 year. Median follow-up was 17.2 months. First rebiopsy results were available for 595 patients and of those, 144 (24.2 %) had adverse findings. A total of 283 (30.1 %) patients discontinued surveillance, of those 181 (64.0 %) due to protocol-based reasons.

Method:   Three nationwide observational telephone surveys (EDIFICE opinion polls) were conducted in 2005, 2008, and 2011. The overall target was a representative sample of > 1,500 individuals living in France and aged 40-75 years, including 481 men aged 50-74 years.  Results:   Within this male population, the rate of screening reported remained stable between 2008 and 2011 (48 and 49%, respectively). However, comparison of privileged versus disadvantaged populations showed significant differences, with a relative decrease in screening among those of higher socioprofessional status (p = 0.03) and from higher-income groups (p = 0.02). For households with a monthly income above 2,500€, the screening rate decreased from 61% in 2008 to 51% in 2011 (p = 0.05), while for those with an income below 2,500€, it increased from 36% in 2008 to 44 % in 2011 (p = 0.18).  Conclusion:   A plateau or even a reduction in prostate cancer screening is currently being observed; this is possibly due to progressive recognition among the population at large of the controversy surrounding prostate cancer screening, whereas this speculation was formerly limited to health-care professionals.

Although prior work has focused on targeting AR directly, co-activators of AR signaling, which may represent new therapeutic targets, are relatively underexplored. Here we demonstrate that the mixed-lineage leukemia protein (MLL) complex, a well-known driver of MLL fusion-positive leukemia, acts as a co-activator of AR signaling. AR directly interacts with the MLL complex via the menin-MLL subunit. Menin expression is higher in CRPC than in both hormone-naive prostate cancer and benign prostate tissue, and high menin expression correlates with poor overall survival of individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer. Treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor of menin-MLL interaction blocks AR signaling and inhibits the growth of castration-resistant tumors in vivo in mice.

The proteins are prostate specific antigen (PSA), prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), platelet factor-4 (PF-4), and interlukin-6 (IL-6). The six channel system is driven by integrated micropumps controlled by an inexpensive programmable microprocessor. The reagent delivery cassette and detection array feature channels made by precision-cut 0.8 mm silicone gaskets. Single-wall carbon nanotube forests were grown in printed microwells on a pyrolytic graphite detection chip and decorated with capture antibodies. The detection chip is housed in a machined microfluidic chamber with a steel metal shim counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode for electrochemiluminescent (ECL) measurements. The preloaded sample/reagent cassette automatically delivers samples, wash buffers, and ECL RuBPY-silica-antibody detection nanoparticles sequentially. An onboard microcontroller controls micropumps and reagent flow to the detection chamber according to a preset program. Detection employs tripropylamine, a sacrificial reductant, while applying 0.95 V vs Ag/AgCl. Resulting ECL light was measured by a CCD camera. Ultralow detection limits of 10-100 fg mL(-1) were achieved in simultaneous detection of the four protein in 36 min assays.

HIF-1α increased ILK via transcriptional activation. ILK increased HIF-1α levels by promoting mTOR-mediated translation in PC-3 and MCF-7 cells, and by blocking GSK3β-mediated degradation in LNCaP cells, consistent with the cell line-/cellular context-specific functions of ILK as a Ser473-Akt kinase. We show that ILK can account for the effects of hypoxia on Akt, mTOR, and GSK3β phosphorylation. Also, ILK can de-repress HIF-1α signaling through the YB-1-mediated inhibition of Foxo3a expression. In concert with HIF-1α, these downstream effectors promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through modulation of Snail and Zeb1. Thus, the ILK-HIF-1α regulatory loop could underlie the maintenance of high HIF-1α expression levels and the promotion of EMT under hypoxic conditions. Finally, we show that the small-molecule ILK inhibitor T315 can disrupt this regulatory loop in vivo and suppress xenograft tumor growth, thereby providing proof-of-concept that targeting ILK represents an effective strategy to block HIF-1α expression and aggressive phenotype in cancer cells.""","""['Chih-Chien Chou', 'Hsaio-Ching Chuang', 'Santosh B Salunke', 'Samuel K Kulp', 'Ching-Shih Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Foxo3a-mediated overexpression of microRNA-622 suppresses tumor metastasis by repressing hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in ERK-responsive lung cancer.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'Functional Role of mTORC2 versus Integrin-Linked Kinase in Mediating Ser473-Akt Phosphorylation in PTEN-Negative Prostate and Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Crosstalk between Notch, HIF-1α and GPER in Breast Cancer EMT.', 'Targeting HIF-1α signaling pathway for gastric cancer treatment.', 'Targeting hypoxia-inducible factors for breast cancer therapy: A narrative review.', 'Integrin-Linked Kinase Expression in Human Valve Endothelial Cells Plays a Protective Role in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease.', 'The focal adhesion protein Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK) as an important player in breast cancer pathogenesis.', 'Pathophysiological implications of hypoxia in human diseases.', 'Hypoxia-Induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Cancers: HIF-1α and Beyond.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 62 consecutive patients suspicious of PCa at the mpMRI scan and PSA >4.0 ng/mL were recruited prospectively. Targeted biopsies (TBs) were carried out for each cancer-suspicious lesion and followed a 12-core systematic biopsy (SB) protocol. Pathological findings of TB and SB were analyzed.  Results:   The age of the patients was 68.38 ± 6.57 years (range 51-79 years). The preoperative PSA value was 10.21 ± 5.57 ng/mL (range 4.5-30.1 ng/mL).

Materials and methods:   A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine and compare standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) of different types of cancer developed after heart transplantation. We analysed data obtained from medical documentation of 603 HTRs transplanted between 1993 and 2010.  Results:   191 incident cases of malignancy occurred in123 HTRs (20.4%). According to expectations, nonmelanoma skin cancer was the most frequent type of malignancy (119 cases) with SMR 7.6 (P < 0.001), followed by lung cancer with SMR 2.7 (P < 0.001). SMR for melanoma was 2.5, P = 0.129. Other types of cancer in HTRs (prostate and kidney cancer) were less frequent (SMR 2.06, P = 0.038 and SMR 2.03, P = 0.122).

Materials and methods:   The study included 30 men with histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer who underwent MRI before and after initiation of ADT. Thirty-four tumours were volumetrically assessed on DW-MRI (n = 32) and DCE-MRI (n = 18), along with regions of interest in benign prostatic tissue, to calculate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and transfer constant (K(trans)) values. Changes in MRI parameters and correlations with clinical parameters (change in prostate-specific antigen [PSA], treatment duration, PSA nadir) were assessed.  Results:   Prostate volume and PSA values decreased significantly with therapy (p < 0.001). ADC values increased significantly in tumours and decreased in benign prostatic tissue (p < 0.05). Relative changes in ADC and absolute post-therapeutic ADC values differed significantly between tumour and benign tissue (p < 0.001). K(trans) decreased significantly only in tumours (p < 0.001); relative K(trans) changes and post-therapeutic values were not significantly different between tumour and benign tissue. The relative change in tumour ADC correlated significantly with PSA decrease. No changes were associated with treatment duration or PSA nadir.  Conclusions:   Multi-parametric MRI shows significant measurable changes in tumour and benign prostate caused by ADT and may help in monitoring treatment response.

Results:   In patients endorsing lower LoDs, more received support was associated with less negative affect. Also, not endorsing high LoDs while receiving strong partner support was related to patients' lower negative and higher positive affect.

Most biopsy specimens will not show disease progression or change management. Such biopsies do not contribute to patient management and are potentially morbid and costly.  Objective:   To use a contemporary AS prospective trial to develop a tool to predict AS biopsy outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   Biopsy samples (median: 2; range: 2-9 per patient) from 859 men participating in the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study and with Gleason 6 prostate cancer (median follow-up: 35.8 mo; range: 3.0-148.7 mo) were analyzed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression was used to predict progression, defined as an increase in Gleason score from ≤6 to ≥7 or increase in percentage of cores positive for cancer from <34% to ≥34%. Fivefold internal cross-validation was performed to evaluate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results and limitations:   Statistically significant risk factors for progression on biopsy were prostate-specific antigen (odds ratio [OR]: 1.045; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.028-1.063), percentage of cores positive for cancer on most recent biopsy (OR: 1.401; 95% CI, 1.301-1.508), and history of at least one prior negative biopsy (OR: 0.524; 95% CI, 0.417-0.659).

Objective:   We explored whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes involved in energy metabolic pathways are associated with PCa risk and prognosis, and whether antidiabetic treatment modifies any such association.  Design, setting, and participants:   The PRACTICAL Consortium genotyped 397 SNPs among 3241 screened participants (including 801 PCa cases) in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial and 1983 hospital-based PCa cases. Information on medication use was obtained from a national prescription database.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Genetic risk scores were calculated in terms of SNPs associated with PCa incidence or survival at a significance level of p < 5×10(-3). Hazard ratios for PCa and disease-specific death were calculated via Cox regression modelling. The predictive value of the genetic risk score was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic and Harrell's c-index analyses.  Results and limitations:   A total of 30 SNPs were associated with PCa risk and ten SNPs with survival. The genetic risk score was consistently associated with PCa survival. The risk association was non-significantly weaker in metformin users. The genetic risk score did not improve prediction of PCa risk, but slightly improved the ability to predict PCa survival when added to conventional predictors (c-index improved from 87.4 to 87.9; p<0.001). A limitation is that information on diabetes apart from medication use was unavailable for the study population.  Conclusions:   SNPs of genes involved in energy metabolic pathways are associated with PCa survival. This suggests an important role of glucose metabolism in PCa progression, which could point to new avenues for prevention of PCa death.

Five EZH2-derived peptides that were prepared based on the binding motif to the HLA-A3 supertype alleles (HLA-A11, -A31, and -A33) were functionally screened for their potential to induce peptide-specific CTLs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HLA-A3 supertype allele(+) prostate cancer patients.

Methods:   PC3 cells were trasnfected via lipofectamine by the shRNA vector FCGR1AshRNA targeting the Fc segment of IgG, using NCshRNA as the negative control. Q-PCR and Western blotting were used to analyze the expression of IgG in the trasnfected cells. The cells were then exposed to ⁶⁰Co γ ray at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 Gy, and the cell proliferation was evaluated by MTS and the cells apoptosis estimated by flow cytometry at 12, 24 and 48 h.  Results:   MTS assay showed that ⁶⁰Co γ ray significantly inhibited the proliferation of PC3 cells transfected with FCGR1AshRNA as compared with NCshRNA-transfected and blank control cells (P<0.05). Flow cytometry showed that the cell apoptosis rate was significantly higher in FCGR1AshRNA group than in NCshRNA and blank control groups at 48 h after γ ray exposure (P<0.05). At 12, 24 and 48 h after 6 Gy radiation, the cells in FCGR1AshRNA group showed a significantly lowered proliferation rate and an increased apoptosis rate (P<0.05).

Patients and methods:   The diagnostic performance of %p2PSA and PHI were evaluated in a multicentre study. In all, 769 men aged ≤65 years scheduled for initial or repeat prostate biopsy were recruited in four sites based on a total PSA (t-PSA) level of 1.6-8.0 ng/mL World Health Organization (WHO) calibrated (2-10 ng/mL Hybritech-calibrated). Serum samples were measured for the concentration of t-PSA, free PSA (f-PSA) and p2PSA with Beckman Coulter immunoassays on Access-2 or DxI800 instruments. PHI was calculated as (p2PSA/f-PSA × √t-PSA). Uni- and multivariable logistic regression models and an artificial neural network (ANN) were complemented by decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   In univariate analysis %p2PSA and PHI were the best predictors of prostate cancer detection in all patients (area under the curve [AUC] 0.72 and 0.73, respectively), at initial (AUC 0.67 and 0.69) and repeat biopsy (AUC 0.74 and 0.74). t-PSA and %f-PSA performed less accurately for all patients (AUC 0.54 and 0.62). For detection of significant prostate cancer (based on Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance [PRIAS] criteria) the %p2PSA and PHI equally demonstrated best performance (AUC 0.70 and 0.73) compared with t-PSA and %f-PSA (AUC 0.54 and 0.59). In multivariate analysis PHI we added to a base model of age, prostate volume, digital rectal examination, t-PSA and %f-PSA. PHI was strongest in predicting prostate cancer in all patients, at initial and repeat biopsy and for significant prostate cancer (AUC 0.73, 0.68, 0.78 and 0.72, respectively). In DCA for all patients the ANN showed the broadest threshold probability and best net benefit. PHI as single parameter and the base model + PHI were equivalent with threshold probability and net benefit nearing those of the ANN.

Patients and methods:   An invitation to participate in a postal questionnaire survey was sent to 546 men, diagnosed with prostate cancer 9-24 months previously at two UK cancer centres. The study group comprised men who had been subject to a range of treatments: surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy and active surveillance. The questionnaire included measures of prostate-related quality of life (Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite 26-item version, EPIC-26); unmet needs (Supportive Care Needs Survey 34-item version, SCNS-SF34); anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), self-efficacy (modified Self-efficacy Scale), health status (EuroQol 5D, EQ-5D) and satisfaction with care (questions developed for this study). A single reminder was sent to non-responders after 3 weeks. Data were analysed by age, co-morbidities, and treatment group.  Results:   In all, 316 men completed questionnaires (64.1% response rate). Overall satisfaction with follow-up care was high, but was lower for psychosocial than physical aspects of care. Urinary, bowel, and sexual functioning was reported as a moderate/big problem in the last month for 15.2% (n = 48), 5.1% (n = 16), and 36.5% (n = 105) men, respectively. The most commonly reported moderate/high unmet needs related to changes in sexual feelings/relationships, managing fear of recurrence/uncertainty, and concerns about the worries of significant others. It was found that 17% of men (51/307) reported potentially moderate-to-severe levels of anxiety and 10.2% (32/308) reported moderate-to-severe levels of depression. The presence of problematic side-effects was associated with higher psychological morbidity, poorer self-efficacy, greater unmet needs, and poorer overall health status.  Conclusion:   While some men report relatively few problems after prostate cancer treatment, this study highlights important physical and psycho-social issues for a significant minority of survivors of prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Sixty-two patients who underwent curative hypofractionated radiotherapy (66 Gy in 22 fractions) between 2002 and 2010 were retrospectively genotyped for CNV and SNP rs5489 in the xrcc1 DNA repair gene. Fifty-four patients had full dosimetric profiles. Two parallel modeling approaches were compared to assess the risk of severe RB (Grade⩾3) and ED (Grade⩾1); Maximum likelihood estimated generalized Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) and logistic regression. Statistical resampling based on cross-validation was used to evaluate model predictive power and generalizability to unseen data.  Results:   Integration of biological variables xrcc1 CNV and SNP improved the fit of the RB and ED analytical and data-driven models. Cross-validation of the generalized LKB models yielded increases in classification performance of 27.4% for RB and 14.6% for ED when xrcc1 CNV and SNP were included, respectively. Biological variables added to logistic regression modeling improved classification performance over standard dosimetric models by 33.5% for RB and 21.2% for ED models.  Conclusion:   As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated that the combination of genetic and dosimetric variables can provide significant improvement in NTCP prediction using analytical and data-driven approaches.

Given that mice deficient in ERβ do not develop prostate cancer, we hypothesized that ERβ loss occurs as a consequence of tumorigenesis caused by other oncogenic mechanisms and that its loss is necessary for tumorigenesis. In support of this hypothesis, we found that ERβ is targeted for repression in prostate cancer caused by PTEN deletion and that loss of ERβ is important for tumor formation. ERβ transcription is repressed by BMI-1, which is induced by PTEN deletion and important for prostate tumorigenesis. This finding provides a mechanism for how ERβ expression is regulated in prostate cancer. Repression of ERβ contributes to tumorigenesis because it enables HIF-1/VEGF signaling that sustains BMI-1 expression.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction, proliferation, migration, colony formation and release of metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) were analyzed in 50-day exposed cells to the selected EDs. As a result, aldrin and CPF exposure led to an EMT induction (loss of 16% and 14% of E-cadherin levels, respectively, compared to the unexposed cells). Aroclor and CPF presented an increased migration (134% and 126%, respectively), colony formation (204% and 144%, respectively) and MMP-2 release (137% in both cases) compared to the unexposed cells. An untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed to decipher the lipids involved in the observed transformations. As general results, aldrin exposure showed a global decrease in phospholipids and sphingolipids, and aroclor and CPF showed an increase of certain phospholipids, glycosphingolipids as well as a remarkable increase of some cardiolipin species. Furthermore, the three exposures resulted in an increase of some triglyceride species.

However, the mechanisms behind the potential side effects involving the induction of the prostate cancer (PCa) neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation remain unclear. Here we found PCa cells could recruit more mast cells than normal prostate epithelial cells, and enzalutamide (or casodex) treatment could further increase such recruitment that resulted in promoting the PCa NE differentiation. Mechanism dissection found infiltrated mast cells could function through positive feedback to enhance PCa to recruit more mast cells via modulation of the androgen receptor (AR) → cytokines IL8 signals, and interruption by AR-siRNA or neutralizing anti-IL8 antibody could partially reverse the recruitment of mast cells. Importantly, targeting the PCa androgens/AR signals with AR-siRNA or enzalutamide (or casodex) also increased PCa NE differentiation via modulation of the miRNA32 expression, and adding miRNA32 inhibitor reversed the AR-siRNA- or enzalutamide-enhanced NE differentiation. Together, these results not only identified a new signal via infiltrated mast cells → PCa AR → miRNA32 to increase PCa NE differentiation, it also pointed out the potential unwanted side effects of enzalutamide (or casodex) to increase PCa NE differentiation.

Sirt6, a class III histone deacetylase, has been shown to down regulate glycolysis by inhibiting the expression of several key glycolytic genes. Based on the published study on the metabolic phenotype of E2F1 -/- mice and SIRT6 -/- mice, we hypothesize that E2F1 enhances glycolysis and inhibits the expression of Sirt6. Indeed, over-expressing of E2F1, but not its DNA binding deficient mutant, significantly enhanced glucose uptake and lactate production in bladder and prostate cancer cell lines. E2F1 over-expression also suppressed Sirt6 expression and function. Moreover, E2F1 directly bound to Sirt6 promoter and suppressed Sirt6 promoter activity under both normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions. E2F1 siRNA blocked the up-regulation of E2F1 under hypoxia, increased Sirt6 expression and decreased glycolysis compared to those of scrambled siRNA transected cells. Furthermore, HDAC1 deacetylated E2F1 and diminished its transcription suppression of Sirt6 promoter. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), suppressed Sirt6 promoter activity with increased binding of acetylated E2F1 to Sirt6 promoter. Mutating the E2F1 binding site on the proximal Sirt6 promoter abolished the suppression of Sirt6 transcription by TSA.

While androgens inhibit apoptosis partly through transcriptional upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, c-FLIP in androgen-responsive cells, they downregulate c-FLIP in androgen-independent cells. We found that although Sp1 and p65 trans-activate c-FLIP, the combination of Sp1 and p65 has differential effects in a cellular context-dependent manner. We show that activation of the androgen metabolism enzyme, aldo-keto reductase, AKR1C1, relieves androgen independence through activation of 3β-Adiol-mediated upregulation of ERβ. ERβ competes with Sp1 and Sp3 to transcriptionally downregulate c-FLIP in the absence of consensus estrogen-response element in androgen-independent cells. Forced expression of AR in androgen-independent cells show that ERβ-mediated growth inhibition occurs under conditions of androgen independence. Reactivation of ERβ with the estrogenic metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol, decreased enrichment ratio of Sp1/Sp3 at the c-FLIP promoter with concomitant effects on cell growth and death. Expression of Sp1 and c-FLIP are elevated while AKR1C1, ERβ and Sp3 are significantly low in human prostate tumor samples.

In addition, peptides have been shown to have numerous uses as diagnostic and therapeutic molecular probes. The K237 peptide binds to the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor with high affinity and specificity, and was predicted to have potential use as a probe in tumor angiogenesis. The overall aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic potential of 131I‑K237 as a molecular probe for prostate cancer. The K237 peptide was radiolabeled with 131I using an Iodogen method. The radiolabeling efficiency and radiochemical purity were found to be 73.7 ± 3.2 and 96.7 ± 0.6%, respectively, which were determined using thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography in vitro. Cellular uptake and competition binding experiments were used to identify the affinity of 131I‑K237 to LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The binding ratio of 131I‑K237 to LNCaP cells in the experimental group was 95.8 ± 1.5%, whereas the binding ratios in the 5 kBq Na131I, 10 kBq Na131I, 15 kBq Na131I and PBS groups were 8.2 ± 0.4, 8.3 ± 0.2, 8.5 ± 0.2 and 0.0%, respectively. In addition, the binding ratio of 131I‑K237 to LNCaP significantly decreased with the increased dose of unlabeled K237. A total of 40 male BALB/c mice with LNCaP xenografts were used for biodistribution and single photon emission computed tomography imaging analysis. An image was obtained and tumors were visible from 2 h post injection of 131I‑K237. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that 131I‑K237 had a high affinity for LNCaP cells and may be considered as a candidate diagnostic molecular probe for prostate cancer.""","""['Qian Zhao', 'Yu Zhang', 'Jun Guo', 'Juan Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Validation study of ¹³¹I-RRL: assessment of biodistribution, SPECT imaging and radiation dosimetry in mice.', 'Novel α(2)β(1) integrin-targeted peptide probes for prostate cancer imaging.', 'Evaluation of 64Cu- and 125I-radiolabeled bitistatin as potential agents for targeting alpha v beta 3 integrins in tumor angiogenesis.', 'Treatment of prostate cancer by radioiodine therapy after tissue-specific expression of the sodium iodide symporter.', 'Phage peptide display.']"""

Neurotrophic factors play a major role in depression and stress and might provide insight into mechanisms of fatigue. This study investigated the association between plasma concentrations of three neurotrophic factors (BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GDNF, glial-derived neurotrophic factor; and SNAPIN, soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion attachment receptor-associated protein) and initial fatigue intensification during external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in euthymic non-metastatic prostate cancer men.  Methods:   Fatigue, as measured by the 13-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F), and plasma neurotrophic factors were collected at baseline (prior to EBRT) and mid-EBRT. Subjects were categorized into fatigue and no fatigue groups using a > 3-point change in FACT-F scores between the two time points. Multiple linear regressions analysed the associations between fatigue and neurotrophic factors.  Results:   FACT-F scores of 47 subjects decreased from baseline (43.95 ± 1.3) to mid-EBRT (38.36 ± 1.5, P < 0.001), indicating worsening fatigue. SNAPIN levels were associated with fatigue scores (rs = 0.43, P = 0.005) at baseline. A significant decrease of BDNF concentration (P = 0.008) was found in fatigued subjects during EBRT (n = 39).

The AuNPs decorated on the nanocomposite provided extra binding sites for the three antibodies carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prostate specific antigen (PSA), α-fetoprotein (AFP), respectively. The ionic liquid reduced graphene oxide was combined with poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) as substrate to attach the three different antibodies through electrostatic adsorption. Three separate signals can be detected directly in a single run through square wave voltammetry.

Moreover, nerve sparing, pT category, and patients' body mass index were significantly associated with continence. Nerve sparing, pT category, patients' body mass index, and use of PDE5 inhibitor or intracavernous injection therapy significantly influenced potency.

More recently, the selective action of capsaicin against cancer cells has been reported. Capsaicin was found to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of a wide range of cancer cells in vitro, whereas being inactive against normal cells. As data on capsaicin-induced genotoxicity are limited and the effects of capsaicin against human lung A549 and DU145 prostate cancer cells were not explored in detail, we were interested in determining whether capsaicin-associated genotoxicity may also provoke A549 and DU145 cell death. Capsaicin-induced decrease in metabolic activity and cell proliferation, and changes in the cell cycle were limited to high concentrations used (≥ 100 μM), whereas, at lower concentrations, capsaicin stimulated both DNA double strand breaks and micronuclei production. Capsaicin was unable to provoke apoptotic cell death when used up to 250 μM concentrations. Capsaicin induced oxidative stress, but was ineffective in provoking the dissipation of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential.

Objective:   To evaluate the benefit of performing MRI prior to RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   This single-institution randomised trial included 438 patients between December 2009 and June 2012 who were scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. The study was registered (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01347320).  Intervention:   Patients were preoperatively randomly assigned to non-MRI or MRI groups.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was the difference in the PSM rates between the two groups. Secondary end points were the rates of PSMs in clinical subgroups. Summary statistics were extracted from descriptive analyses, chi-square, or Fisher exact test, and logistic regression was used to analyse the data according to the intention-to-treat principle.  Results and limitations:   A total of 216 patients were randomised to non-MRI; 222 were randomised to MRI. There were 49 cases (23%) of PSMs in the non-MRI group and 43 cases (19%) in the MRI group (p=0.4). The relative and absolute risk reduction was 15% and 4%, respectively. Patients with cT1 constituted 55% of the cohort, in which the rate of PSMs was 27% in the non-MRI group and 16% in the MRI group (p=0.035). The relative and absolute risk reduction was 41% and 11%, respectively. A limitation was suboptimal communication between the radiologist and urologist.  Conclusions:   MRI prior to RP did not reduce the overall risk for PSMs in this patient cohort. However, at subgroup analysis we observed a possible benefit of MRI in patients with cT1.  Patient summary:   This study could not demonstrate a definite benefit of performing magnetic resonance imaging before surgery for all patients.

Objective:   To investigate how age and comorbidity affect treatment of men with HRnMPCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was an observational nationwide register study during 2001-2012. We identified 19 190 men of <80 yr of age diagnosed with HRnMPCa in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden and 95 948 age-matched men without prostate cancer in the register of the total population.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcome was the proportion of men with HRnMPCa receiving radical treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy). Vital status and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) were obtained from nationwide registers. The 10-yr survival of men without prostate cancer, stratified by age and CCI, was used as a measure of the life expectancy of the men with prostate cancer.  Results and limitations:   The proportions receiving radical treatment varied with life expectancy among men younger than 70 yr, whereas use of these treatments did not match the long life expectancy of men in their seventies with CCI 0-1. Only 10% of men aged 75-80 yr with CCI 0 received radical treatment despite 52% probability of 10-yr life expectancy, compared with approximately half of the men younger than 70 yr with a similar life expectancy. The use of radical treatment for HRnMPCa increased with time in all Swedish counties, but a threefold difference between counties remained in 2009-2012 for patients aged 70-80 yr with CCI 0-1. Uncertain external validity is a study limitation, and the impact of physician versus patient preferences on treatment selection could not be assessed.  Conclusions:   Otherwise healthy men in their seventies with HRnMPCa were less likely to receive radical treatment than younger men with a similar life expectancy, although increasing use of radical treatment was observed during the study period. Our findings highlight the need for improved methods for clinical decision-making, including improved assessment of life expectancy.  Patient summary:   We performed a nationwide register study that showed that many healthy men in their seventies live for at least another 10 yr. Despite this long life expectancy, men in their seventies with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer were often not treated with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, possibly because their life expectancy was underestimated.

Methods:   Patients aged ≤ 68 years were randomized after nsRP 1:1:1 to 9-month double-blind treatment (DBT) with tadalafil 5 mg once daily (OaD), 20-mg tadalafil on-demand (""pro-re-nata""; PRN), or placebo, followed by 6-week drug-free washout and 3-month open-label OaD treatment. Secondary outcome measures included the change in SPL from pre-nsRP to the end of DBT (analysis of covariance adjusting for treatment, country, baseline, age, and nerve-sparing score), responses to Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) questions 1-3 (mixed models for repeated measures adjusting for treatment, country, visit, visit-treatment-interaction, age), and Standardized Morning Erection Question (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for age and country).  Results:   Four hundred twenty-three patients were randomized to tadalafil OaD (N = 139), tadalafil PRN (N = 143), and placebo (N = 141). Greater retainment of SPL was observed with tadalafil OaD vs placebo at the end of DBT (least-square mean [95% confidence interval] difference OaD vs placebo, 4.1 mm [0.4 to 7.8 mm]; P = .032). No significant effects on SPL were found for tadalafil PRN vs placebo, or for the nerve-sparing score. Penile tumescence (SEP1) and ability for vaginal insertion (SEP2) significantly improved vs placebo at the end of double-blind and open-label treatment for patients randomized to tadalafil OaD only. The ability for successful sexual intercourse (SEP3) significantly improved with tadalafil OaD vs placebo only during DBT. The distribution of Standardized Morning Erection Question responses was different at the end of DBT (P = .045); 34.2% of patients on tadalafil OaD, 50.0% on tadalafil PRN, and 56.5% on placebo reported absence of morning erections.

Geldanamycin is a well-known inhibitor of Hsp90, but its associated liver toxicity limited its clinical development. Here, we report a highly effective and low-hepatotoxic geldanamycin derivative that exhibits antitumor activity against human prostate cancer cells. Treatment of cells with 17-DMCHAG (17-(6-(3,4-dimethoxycinnamamido)hexylamino)-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin) dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation, reduced colony formation and induced apoptosis of human prostate cancer cell lines. 17-DMCHAG exhibits anti-invasive and anti-migratory activities in prostate cancer cells through down-regulating of transcription factors Zeb1, Snail1, Slug, and mesenchymal marker Vimentin, while up-regulating the epithelial marker of E-cadherin. Furthermore, 17-DMCHAG treatment damaged the Hsp90/AR and Hsp90/survivin complexes and induced the proteasome-dependent degradation of AR and survivin, then inhibited the activity of these two proteins. In vivo, we observed that 17-DMCHAG showed strong antitumor effects in LNCaP and DU-145 cell-xenografted nude mice.

It is commonly used as monomer in polycarbonate synthesis, plasticizer in the production of epoxy resins, as well as an additive for the elimination of surfeit of hydrochloric acid during the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production. BPA is not only used in the production of plastics intended to a direct contact with food, including plastic packaging and kitchenware, but also in inner coatings of cans and jar caps. There are various routes of human exposure to this substance such as oral, by inhalation and transdermal. The main sources of exposure to BPA include food packaging and dust, dental materials, healthcare equipment, thermal paper, toys and articles for children and infants. BPA is metabolized in the liver to form bisphenol A glucuronide and mostly in this form is excreted with urine. Due to its phenolic structure BPA has been shown to interact with estrogen receptors and to act as agonist or antagonist via estrogen receptor (ER) dependent signalling pathways. Therefore, BPA has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of several endocrine disorders including female and male infertility, precocious puberty, hormone dependent tumours such as breast and prostate cancer and several metabolic disorders including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Because of the constant, daily exposure and its tendency to bio-accumulation, BPA seems to require special attention such as biomonitoring. This observation should include clinical tests of BPA concentration in the urine, which is not only one of the best methods of evaluation of the exposure to this compound, but also the dependence of the daily intake of BPA and the risk of some endocrine disorders.""","""['Aleksandra Konieczna', 'Aleksandra Rutkowska', 'Dominik Rachoń']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig""","""['Bisphenol A: an endocrine and metabolic disruptor.', 'A review of dietary and non-dietary exposure to bisphenol-A.', 'Bisphenol A (BPA) in food contact materials - new scientific opinion from EFSA regarding public health risk.', 'Bisphenol A and human health: a review of the literature.', 'Human health risk on environmental exposure to Bisphenol-A: a review.', 'Biological Degradation of Plastics and Microplastics: A Recent Perspective on Associated Mechanisms and Influencing Factors.', 'Current Evidence on Bisphenol A Exposure and the Molecular Mechanism Involved in Related Pathological Conditions.', 'Changes Caused by Bisphenols in the Chemical Coding of Neurons of the Enteric Nervous System of Mouse Stomach.', 'Evaluation of Parabens and Bisphenol A Concentration Levels in Wild Bat Guano Samples.', 'A review of the endocrine disrupting effects of micro and nano plastic and their associated chemicals in mammals.']"""

Recently, SEMA3A has also been considered as a candidate tumor suppressor, since it is often downregulated in numerous types of cancer, including prostate cancer, breast cancer and glioma. However, the biological role of SEMA3A in ovarian cancer is not clear. In the present study, the expression of SEMA3A in ovarian cancer and normal ovarian epithelial tissues was detected by immunofluorescence, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blotting, and the associations between the expression of SEMA3A with the development of ovarian cancer, clinicopathological characteristics and survival were also analyzed. Results from immunofluorescence, RT‑qPCR and western blotting showed that SEMA3A is significantly downregulated in epithelial ovarian carcinoma compared to normal ovarian epithelial specimens (P<0.05). The expression levels of SEMA3A were lower in the cancer tissues with III/IV stage [the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage], poor histological grade, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis compared to that in the cancer tissues with I/II stage (FIGO), well histological grade, or without lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis (P<0.05). A decreased expression of SEMA3A is associated with a poor prognosis (P<0.001). The present findings suggest that decreased SEMA3A expression may be associated with the development of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, and therefore, SEMA3A may be a valuable prognostic marker, as well as a potential molecular therapy target for ovarian cancer patients.""","""['Haiyan Jiang', 'Lei Qi', 'Feiran Wang', 'Zhichao Sun', 'Zhongwei Huang', 'Qinghua Xi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Increased expression of neuropilin 1 is associated with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.', 'Promoter Hypermethylation of FANCF and Susceptibility and Prognosis of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'Stomatin-like protein 2 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer and predicts poor patient survival.', 'Epigenetic biomarkers in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Cellular and molecular processes in ovarian cancer metastasis.
