Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a collagen receptor tyrosine-kinase, is as well frequently overexpressed in cancer and implicated in cancer progression. Thus, we investigated whether a functional cross-talk between the IGF-IR and DDR1 exists and plays any role in cancer progression.Using human breast cancer cells we found that DDR1 constitutively associated with the IGF-IR. However, this interaction was enhanced by IGF-I stimulation, which promoted rapid DDR1 tyrosine-phosphorylation and co-internalization with the IGF-IR. Significantly, DDR1 was critical for IGF-IR endocytosis and trafficking into early endosomes, IGF-IR protein expression and IGF-I intracellular signaling and biological effects, including cell proliferation, migration and colony formation. These biological responses were inhibited by DDR1 silencing and enhanced by DDR1 overexpression.Experiments in mouse fibroblasts co-transfected with the human IGF-IR and DDR1 gave similar results and indicated that, in the absence of IGF-IR, collagen-dependent phosphorylation of DDR1 is impaired.These results demonstrate a critical role of DDR1 in the regulation of IGF-IR action, and identify DDR1 as a novel important target for breast cancers that overexpress IGF-IR.""","""['Roberta Malaguarnera', 'Maria Luisa Nicolosi', 'Antonella Sacco', 'Alaide Morcavallo', 'Veronica Vella', 'Concetta Voci', 'Michela Spatuzza', 'Shi-Qiong Xu', 'Renato V Iozzo', 'Riccardo Vigneri', 'Andrea Morrione', 'Antonino Belfiore']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['IGF-I induces upregulation of DDR1 collagen receptor in breast cancer cells by suppressing MIR-199a-5p through the PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Discoidin domain receptor 1 modulates insulin receptor signaling and biological responses in breast cancer cells.', 'Collagen stimulates discoidin domain receptor 1-mediated migration of smooth muscle cells through Src.', 'A novel functional crosstalk between DDR1 and the IGF axis and its relevance for breast cancer.', 'The Emerging Role of Insulin Receptor Isoforms in Thyroid Cancer: Clinical Implications and New Perspectives.', 'RAGE inhibition blunts insulin-induced oncogenic signals in breast cancer.', 'Focusing on discoidin domain receptors in premalignant and malignant liver diseases.', 'A network map of discoidin domain receptor 1(DDR1)-mediated signaling in pathological conditions.', 'The role of discoid domain receptor 1 on renal tubular epithelial pyroptosis in diabetic nephropathy.', 'The Insulin-like Growth Factor System and Colorectal Cancer.']"""

Nurses are essential in educating patients about radium-223.  Objectives:   This article provides oncology nurses with information from the randomized phase III Alpharadin in Symptomatic Prostate Cancer (ALSYMPCA) trial, as well as important handling, administration, and safety details unique to radium-223.  Methods:   Data from the ALSYMPCA trial and related published information on radium-223 were reviewed.  Findings:   Radium-223 is the only alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical that has been shown to improve overall survival in patients with CRPC, as demonstrated in the ALSYMPCA trial. In addition, radium-223 delays time to first symptomatic skeletal event, and it is well tolerated with a low incidence of myelosuppression and gastrointestinal adverse events. Delivered on an outpatient basis, radium-223 requires universal precautions for handling and administration. Because of the potential for additive myelosuppression, the concomitant use of radium-223 with chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, or hemibody external radiation therapy is not recommended.""","""['Anthony Delacruz', 'Gabrielle Arauz', 'Tracy Curley', 'Amabella Lindo', 'Trine Jensen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin J Oncol Nurs""","""['Alpha-emitter radium-223 in the management of solid tumors: current status and future directions.', ""Radium-223 dichloride for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: the urologist's perspective."", 'Radium-223 dichloride: a review of its use in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Phase II study of radium-223 dichloride in Japanese patients with symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy and safety of radium-223 dichloride in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and symptomatic bone metastases, with or without previous docetaxel use: a prespecified subgroup analysis from the randomised, double-blind, phase 3 ALSYMPCA trial.']"""

Method:   The cytopathic effect of low-temperature plasma was first verified in two commonly used prostate cell lines: BPH-1 and PC-3 cells. The study was then extended to analyse the effects in paired normal and tumour (Gleason grade 7) prostate epithelial cells cultured directly from patient tissue. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and staurosporine were used as controls throughout.  Results:   Low-temperature plasma (LTP) exposure resulted in high levels of DNA damage, a reduction in cell viability, and colony-forming ability. H2O2 formed in the culture medium was a likely facilitator of these effects. Necrosis and autophagy were recorded in primary cells, whereas cell lines exhibited apoptosis and necrosis.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that LTP treatment causes cytotoxic insult in primary prostate cells, leading to rapid necrotic cell death.

Targeted delivery of anti-cancer agents solely to tumor cells introduces a smart strategy because it enhances the therapeutic index compared with untargeted drugs. The present study was performed to investigate the efficiency of adenosine (ADN) to target solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) to over expressing adenosine receptor cell lines such as human breast cancer and prostate cancer (MCF-7 and DU-145 cells), respectively. SLN were prepared by emulsification and solvent evaporation process using docetaxel (DTX) as drug and were characterized by various techniques like dynamic light scattering, differential scanning calorimeter and transmission electron microscopy. DTX loaded SLNs were surface modified with ADN, an adenosine receptors ligand using carbodiimide coupling. Conjugation was confirmed using infrared spectroscopy and quantified using phenol-sulfuric acid method. Conjugated SLN were shown to have sustained drug release as compared to unconjugated nanoparticles and drug suspension. Compared with free DTX and unconjugated SLN, ADN conjugated SLN showed significantly higher cytotoxicity of loaded DTX, as evidenced by in vitro cell experiments. The IC50 was 0.41 Î¼g/ml for native DTX, 0.30 Î¼g/ml for unconjugated SLN formulation, and 0.09 Î¼g/ml for ADN conjugated SLN formulation in MCF-7 cell lines. Whereas, in DU-145, there was 2 fold change in IC50 of ADN-SLN as compared to DTX. IC50 was found to be 0.44 Î¼g/ml for free DTX, 0.39 Î¼g/ml for unconjugated SLN and 0.22 Î¼g/ml for ADN-SLN. Annexin assay and cell cycle analysis assay further substantiated the cell cytotoxicity. Fluorescent cell uptake and competitive ligand-receptor binding assay corroborated the receptor mediated endocytosis pathway indicated role of adenosine receptors in internalization of conjugated particles. Pharmacokinetic studies of lipidic formulations depicted significant improvement in pharmacokinetic parameters than marketed formulation. ADN conjugated SLN proved to be an efficient drug delivery vehicle. Hence, ADN can be used as a potential ligand to target breast and prostate cancer.""","""['Rajan Swami', 'Indu Singh', 'Manish Kumar Jeengar', 'V G M Naidu', 'Wahid Khan', 'Ramakrishna Sistla']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Pharm""","""['Lactoferrin bioconjugated solid lipid nanoparticles: a new drug delivery system for potential brain targeting.', 'Folic acid functionalized long-circulating co-encapsulated docetaxel and curcumin solid lipid nanoparticles: In vitro evaluation, pharmacokinetic and biodistribution in rats.', 'p-Aminophenyl-Î±-D-mannopyranoside engineered lipidic nanoparticles for effective delivery of docetaxel to brain.', 'Receptor-Mediated Targeting in Breast Cancer through Solid Lipid Nanoparticles and Its Mechanism.', 'Current development in nanoformulations of docetaxel.', 'Exploring paclitaxel-loaded adenosine-conjugated PEGylated PLGA nanoparticles for targeting triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Functionalized nanoparticles targeting biomarkers for prostate cancer imaging and therapy.', 'Adenosine Conjugated Docetaxel Nanoparticles-Proof of Concept Studies for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'The Promise of Nanotechnology in Personalized Medicine.', 'Design and Characterization of Elastic Artificial Skin Containing Adenosine-Loaded Solid Lipid Nanoparticles for Treating Wrinkles.']"""

It is the first randomised controlled and preference-based trial to investigate all four options available for the treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer. According to the ""Interdisciplinary evidence-based S3 guideline for the early detection, diagnosis and treatment of the different stages of prostate cancer"" [1], these options include: radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, brachytherapy and active surveillance. In the context of PREFERE preference-based means that potential study participants who do not agree to being randomised into all four treatment arms can maximally refuse two treatment arms. This poses a big challenge to the patient education strategy employed and the information material it requires. In order to inform patients in the context of the PREFERE trial patient education materials (patient leaflet and video) had to be designed that provide patients with balanced and guideline-based information about the disease and the treatment options available, about the need for randomisation and, in particular, about the PREFERE trial and support their individual preference finding and shared decision making for participating in the trial. An iterative structured approach was used to develop the information materials on the basis of a previous literature search. Six focus groups with a total of 40 participants from three different self-help groups, affected men that do not belong to a self-help group, healthy men as well as experts, the members of the steering committee of the PREFERE trial and a focus group consisting of 18 male and female urologists were involved in the development and testing of both the patient information leaflet and the patient video. Both the patient information leaflet and the video supporting preference finding and decision making for participating in the PREFERE trial were tested for understandability and suitability by using a questionnaire and conducting a comprehensive discussion. The results of these lay evaluations have been included in the final revision. Also, a communication resource for physicians has been created comprising all the essential aspects of the PREFERE patient education materials. A short course conducted all over Germany will focus on the process of patient teaching as well as patient education materials. Whether and to what extent the decision for participating in the PREFERE trial has actually been influenced 1) by what the treating physicians communicated to the patient and 2) by the patient education materials used is one of the subjects of a quality of life survey that will be conducted following treatment or - in the case of the active surveillance option - after randomisation during the PREFERE trial.""","""['Sylvia SÃ¤nger', 'Thomas Wiegel', 'Michael StÃ¶ckle', 'Martin HÃ¤rter', 'Corinna Bergelt']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes""","""['Choice between prostatectomy and radiotherapy when men are eligible for both: a randomized controlled trial of usual care vs decision aid.', 'SABRE 1 (Surgery Against Brachytherapy - a Randomised Evaluation): feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) of brachytherapy vs radical prostatectomy in low-intermediate risk clinically localised prostate cancer.', 'Evidence-based patient choice: a prostate cancer decision aid in plain language.', 'Improving prostate cancer care collaboratively - a multidisciplinary, formal, consensus-based approach.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.']"""

In addition, progranulin expression is upregulated in invasive bladder cancer tissues compared to normal controls. However, the molecular mechanisms of progranulin action in bladder cancer have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we searched for novel progranulin-interacting proteins using pull-down assays with recombinant progranulin and proteomics. We discovered that drebrin, an F-actin binding protein, bound progranulin in urothelial cancer cells. We characterized drebrin function in urothelial cancer cell lines and showed that drebrin is critical for progranulin-dependent activation of the Akt and MAPK pathways and modulates motility, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. In addition, drebrin regulates tumor formation in vivo and its expression is upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared to normal tissue controls. Our data are translationally relevant as indicate that drebrin exerts an essential functional role in the regulation of progranulin action and may constitute a novel target for therapeutic intervention in bladder tumors.

These variants can be used to stratify individuals by their risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We genotyped 25 prostate cancer susceptibility loci in 40,414 individuals and derived a polygenic risk score (PRS). We estimated empirical odds ratios (OR) for prostate cancer associated with different risk strata defined by PRS and derived age-specific absolute risks of developing prostate cancer by PRS stratum and family history.  Results:   The prostate cancer risk for men in the top 1% of the PRS distribution was 30.6 (95% CI, 16.4-57.3) fold compared with men in the bottom 1%, and 4.2 (95% CI, 3.2-5.5) fold compared with the median risk. The absolute risk of prostate cancer by age of 85 years was 65.8% for a man with family history in the top 1% of the PRS distribution, compared with 3.7% for a man in the bottom 1%. The PRS was only weakly correlated with serum PSA level (correlation = 0.09).  Conclusions:   Risk profiling can identify men at substantially increased or reduced risk of prostate cancer. The effect size, measured by OR per unit PRS, was higher in men at younger ages and in men with family history of prostate cancer. Incorporating additional newly identified loci into a PRS should improve the predictive value of risk profiles.  Impact:   We demonstrate that the risk profiling based on SNPs can identify men at substantially increased or reduced risk that could have useful implications for targeted prevention and screening programs.""","""['Ali Amin Al Olama', 'Sara Benlloch', 'Antonis C Antoniou', 'Graham G Giles', 'Gianluca Severi', 'David E Neal', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Kenneth Muir', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Brian E Henderson', 'Christopher A Haiman', 'Fredrick R Schumacher', 'Nora Pashayan', 'Paul D P Pharoah', 'Elaine A Ostrander', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Jyotsna Batra', 'Judith A Clements', 'Suzanne K Chambers', 'Maren Weischer', 'BÃ¸rge G Nordestgaard', 'Sue A Ingles', 'Karina D Sorensen', 'Torben F Orntoft', 'Jong Y Park', 'Cezary Cybulski', 'Christiane Maier', 'Thilo Doerk', 'Joanne L Dickinson', 'Lisa Cannon-Albright', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Charnita Zeigler-Johnson', 'Tomonori Habuchi', 'Stephen N Thibodeau', 'Kathleen A Cooney', 'Pierre O Chappuis', 'Pierre Hutter', 'Radka P Kaneva', 'William D Foulkes', 'Maurice P Zeegers', 'Yong-Jie Lu', 'Hong-Wei Zhang', 'Robert Stephenson', 'Angela Cox', 'Melissa C Southey', 'Amanda B Spurdle', 'Liesel FitzGerald', 'Daniel Leongamornlert', 'Edward Saunders', 'Malgorzata Tymrakiewicz', 'Michelle Guy', 'Tokhir Dadaev', 'Sarah J Little', 'Koveela Govindasami', 'Emma Sawyer', 'Rosemary Wilkinson', 'Kathleen Herkommer', 'John L Hopper', 'Aritaya Lophatonanon', 'Antje E Rinckleb', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Rosalind A Eeles', ""Douglas F Easton;UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study Collaborators/British Association of Urological Surgeons' Section of Oncology;UK ProtecT Study Collaborators;PRACTICAL Consortium""]""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Risk Analysis of Prostate Cancer in PRACTICAL Consortium-Letter.', 'Risk Analysis of Prostate Cancer in PRACTICAL Consortium--Response.', 'Validation of a multi-ancestry polygenic risk score and age-specific risks of prostate cancer: A meta-analysis within diverse populations.', 'Clinical Utility of Germline Genetic Testing in Japanese Men Undergoing Prostate Biopsy.', 'Evaluation of a Multiethnic Polygenic Risk Score Model for Prostate Cancer.', 'How Well do Polygenic Risk Scores Identify Men at High Risk for Prostate Cancer?

Adjuvant therapies carry possible benefits of improved curative results, but there is uncertainty in which patients should receive adjuvant therapy. There are concerns about giving toxicity to a whole population for the benefit of only a subset. We hypothesized that making post-prostatectomy treatment decisions using genomics-based risk prediction estimates would improve cancer and quality of life outcomes.  Methods:   We developed a state-transition model to simulate outcomes over a 10 year horizon for a cohort of post-prostatectomy patients. Outcomes included cancer progression rates at 5 and 10 years, overall survival, and quality-adjusted survival with reductions for treatment, side effects, and cancer stage. We compared outcomes using population-level versus individual-level risk of cancer progression, and for genomics-based care versus usual care treatment recommendations.  Results:   Cancer progression outcomes, expected life-years (LYs), and expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were significantly different when individual genomics-based cancer progression risk estimates were used in place of population-level risk estimates. Use of the genomic classifier to guide treatment decisions provided small, but statistically significant, improvements in model outcomes. We observed an additional 0.03 LYs and 0.07 QALYs, a 12% relative increase in the 5-year recurrence-free survival probability, and a 4% relative reduction in the 5-year probability of metastatic disease or death.  Conclusions:   The use of genomics-based risk prediction to guide treatment decisions may improve outcomes for prostate cancer patients.

Statistical analysis included paired t test and Mann-Whitney U test. No statistically significant differences were found between COPD and control groups with regard to the baseline characteristics, except for smoking status. The levels of serum tPSA and fPSA during exacerbation of COPD were significantly higher than the levels of the stable period (p < 0.01), whereas f/tPSA ratio did not change (p > 0.05).

Wedelia chinensis has at least three active compounds, wedelolactone, luteolin, and apigenin synergistically inhibiting prostate cancer cell growth in vitro. Here, we report a systematic study to develop a standardized and effect-optimized herbal extract, designated as W. chinensis extract (WCE) to facilitate its future scientific validation and clinical use. Ethanolic extract of dried W. chinensis plant was further condensed, acid hydrolyzed, and enriched with preparative chromatography. The chemical compositions of multiple batches of the standardized preparation WCE were quantified by LC/MS/MS, and biological activities were analyzed by in vitro and in vivo assays. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of the holistic WCE were compared with the combination of the equivalent principal active compounds through oral administration. The results indicated that quantitative chemical assay and PSA (prostate-specific antigen)-reporter assay together are suitable to measure the quality and efficacy of a standardized Wedelia extract on a xenograft tumor model. The presence of minor concomitant compounds in WCE prolonged the systemic exposure to the active compounds, thus augmented the anti-tumor efficacy of WCE. In conclusion, a combination of LC/MS/MS and PSA reporter assay is suitable to qualify a standardized preparation of WCE. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of active compounds demonstrate that holistic WCE exerted additional pharmacological synergy beyond the multi-targeted therapeutic effects caused by more than one active compound. WCE merits a higher priority to be studied for use in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Chin-Hsien Tsai', 'Sheue-Fen Tzeng', 'Shih-Chuan Hsieh', 'Chih-Yu Lin', 'Chia-Jui Tsai', 'Yet-Ran Chen', 'Yu-Chih Yang', 'Ya-Wen Chou', 'Ming-Ting Lee', 'Pei-Wen Hsiao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phytomedicine""","""['Herbal extract of Wedelia chinensis attenuates androgen receptor activity and orthotopic growth of prostate cancer in nude mice.', 'A standardized herbal extract mitigates tumor inflammation and augments chemotherapy effect of docetaxel in prostate cancer.', 'Compounds from Wedelia chinensis synergistically suppress androgen activity and growth in prostate cancer cells.', 'PC-SPES for treatment of prostate cancer: herbal medicine.', 'Facts about standardization of herbal medicine: a review.', 'Ethnobotanical Survey on Bitter Tea in Taiwan.', 'Development of a quantified herbal extract of hawthorn Crataegus mexicana leaves with vasodilator effect.', 'Induction of Polyploidy and Metabolic Profiling in the Medicinal Herb Wedelia chinensis.', 'Allelopathic Potential and Active Substances from Wedelia Chinensis (Osbeck).', 'An Ethnobotanical Study on QÄ«ng-CÄo-ChÃ¡ Tea in Taiwan.']"""

Therefore, novel prognostic biomarkers are critically needed for patients with ESCC. SLC9A9 has been reported to be downregulated in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer; however, the correlations between SLC9A9 and ESCC prognosis are unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the expression and prognostic significance of SLC9A9 in resectable ESCC. Fresh frozen or paraffin-embedded samples were collected from 167 or 59 patients with resectable ESCC, respectively. The expression of SLC9A9 was assessed by reverse transcription and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis (167 patients) and immunohistochemistry (61 patients). The expression of SLC9A9 was not associated with patient clinicopathological characteristics at both transcription and protein levels. The 5-year overall survival in the high SLC9A9 messenger RNA (mRNA) group (n = 106) was poorer than that in the low expression group (n = 61) (34.6 vs. 65.9 %, P < 0.001). Notably, higher SLC9A9 protein expression was also correlated with lower 5-year overall survival (33.1 vs. 66.5 %, P = 0.023). Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that SLC9A9 mRNA (HR, 2.41; 95 % CI, 1.47-3.97; P = 0.001) and protein (HR, 2.31; 95 %CI, 1.06-5.02; P = 0.034) were independent prognostic factors.

Objective:   We aimed to evaluate whether blacks are more likely than non-Hispanic whites (whites) to develop distal colon neoplasia (adenoma and/or cancer) after negative flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSG).  Design:   We analyzed data of participants with negative FSGs at baseline in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial who underwent repeat FSGs 3 or 5 years later. Subjects with polyps or masses were referred to their physicians for diagnostic colonoscopy. We collected and reviewed the records of diagnostic evaluations.  Participants:   Our analytic cohort consisted of 21,550 whites and 975 blacks.  Main measures:   We did a comparison by race (whites vs. blacks) in the findings of polyps or masses at repeat FSG, the follow-up of abnormal test results and the detection of colorectal neoplasia at diagnostic colonoscopy.  Key results:   At the follow-up FSG examination, 304 blacks (31.2 %) and 4183 whites (19.4 %) had abnormal FSG, [adjusted relative risk (RR) = 1.00; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.90-1.10].

This study aimed to investigate the effects of PLB on apoptosis and autophagy and the underlying mechanisms in human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU145. Our study has shown that PLB had potent pro-apoptotic and pro-autophagic effects on PC-3 and DU145 cells. PLB induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and autophagy in concentration- and time-dependent manners in both PC-3 and DU145 cells. PLB induced inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and activation of 5'-AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) as indicated by their altered phosphorylation, contributing to the pro-autophagic activity of PLB. Modulation of autophagy altered basal and PLB-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Furthermore, PLB downregulated sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), and inhibition of Sirt1 enhanced autophagy, whereas the induction of Sirt1 abolished PLB-induced autophagy in PC-3 and DU145 cells. In addition, PLB downregulated pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor/visfatin, and the inhibition of pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor/visfatin significantly enhanced basal and PLB-induced apoptosis and autophagy in both cell lines. Moreover, reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level attenuated the apoptosis- and autophagy-inducing effects of PLB on both PC-3 and DU145 cells.

Methods and materials:   The target is painted with LETd by using 2, 4, and 7 fields aimed at the proximal segment of the target (split target planning [STP]). As the LETd within the target increases with increasing number of fields, D decreases to maintain the DRBE the same as the conventional treatment planning method by using beams treating the full target (full target planning [FTP]).

Methods and materials:   Three treatment techniques were evaluated retrospectively using daily pre- and posttreatment CBCT images on 22 prostate cancer patients. Prostate, seminal vesicles (SV), rectal wall, and bladder were delineated on all CBCT images. For each patient, a pretreatment intensity modulated radiation therapy plan with clinical target volume (CTV) = prostate + SV and planning target volume (PTV) = CTV + 3 mm was created. The 3 treatment techniques were as follows: (1) Daily Correction: The pretreatment intensity modulated radiation therapy plan was delivered after online CBCT imaging, and position correction; (2) Online Planning: Daily online inverse plans with 3-mm CTV-to-PTV margin were created using online CBCT images, and delivered; and (3) Hybrid Adaption: Daily Correction plus an offline adaptive inverse planning performed after the first week of treatment. The adaptive plan was delivered for all remaining 15 fractions. Treatment dose for each technique was constructed using the daily posttreatment CBCT images via deformable image registration. Evaluation was performed using treatment dose distribution in target and critical organs.  Results:   Treatment equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for the CTV was within [85.6%, 100.8%] of the pretreatment planned target EUD for Daily Correction; [98.7%, 103.0%] for Online Planning; and [99.2%, 103.4%] for Hybrid Adaptation. Eighteen percent of the 22 patients in Daily Correction had a target dose deficiency >5%. For rectal wall, the mean Â± SD of the normalized EUD was 102.6% Â± 2.7% for Daily Correction, 99.9% Â± 2.5% for Online Planning, and 100.6% Â± 2.1% for Hybrid Adaptation.

Methods and materials:   Thirty patients with localized prostate cancer underwent (18)F-choline PET/CT before treatment. Two VMAT plans, plan79 Gy and plan100-105 Gy, were compared for each patient. The whole-prostate planning target volume (PTVprostate) prescription was 79 Gy in both plans, but plan100-105 Gy added simultaneous boost doses of 100 Gy and 105 Gy to the IDL, defined by 60% and 70% of maximum prostatic uptake on (18)F-choline PET (IDLsuv60% and IDLsuv70%, respectively, with IDLsuv70% nested inside IDLsuv60% to potentially enhance tumor specificity of the maximum point dose).

Results:   Planning objectives and dose constraints proved feasible in 30 of 30 cases.

In-vivo beam range verification, in particular, could enable new treatment techniques one of which could be the use of anterior fields for prostate treatment instead of opposed lateral fields as in current practice. This paper reports validation study of an in-vivo range verification method which can reduce the range uncertainty to submillimeter levels and potentially allow for in-vivo dosimetry.  Methods:   An anthropomorphic pelvic phantom is used to validate the clinical potential of the time-resolved dose method for range verification in the case of prostrate treatment using range modulated anterior proton beams. The method uses a 3 Ã 4 matrix of 1 mm diodes mounted in water balloon which are read by an ADC system at 100 kHz. The method is first validated against beam range measurements by dose extinction measurements. The validation is first completed in water phantom and then in pelvic phantom for both open field and treatment field configurations. Later, the beam range results are compared with the water equivalent path length (WEPL) values computed from the treatment planning system XIO.  Results:   Beam range measurements from both time-resolved dose method and the dose extinction method agree with submillimeter precision in water phantom. For the pelvic phantom, when discarding two of the diodes that show sign of significant range mixing, the two methods agree with Â±1 mm. Only a dose of 7 mGy is sufficient to achieve this result. The comparison to the computed WEPL by the treatment planning system (XIO) shows that XIO underestimates the protons beam range. Quantifying the exact XIO range underestimation depends on the strategy used to evaluate the WEPL results. To our best evaluation, XIO underestimates the treatment beam range between a minimum of 1.7% and maximum of 4.1%.  Conclusions:   Time-resolved dose measurement method satisfies the two basic requirements, WEPL accuracy and minimum dose, necessary for clinical use, thus, its potential for in-vivo protons range verification. Further development is needed, namely, devising a workflow that takes into account the limits imposed by proton range mixing and the susceptibility of the comparison of measured and expected WEPLs to errors on the detector positions. The methods may also be used for in-vivo dosimetry and could benefit various proton therapy treatments.""","""['El H Bentefour', 'Shikui Tang', 'Ethan W Cascio', 'Mauro Testa', 'Deepak Samuel', 'Damien Prieels', 'Bernard Gottschalk', 'Hsiao-Ming Lu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Using CBCT for pretreatment range check in proton therapy: a phantom study for prostate treatment by anterior-posterior beam.', 'Clinical commissioning of an in vivo range verification system for prostate cancer treatment with anterior and anterior oblique proton beams.', 'Proton dose calculation on scatter-corrected CBCT image: Feasibility study for adaptive proton therapy.', 'Dosimetry of clinical neutron and proton beams: an overview of recommendations.', 'Spatially fractionated proton minibeams.', 'Towards real-time PGS range monitoring in proton therapy of prostate cancer.', 'In vivo range verification in particle therapy.', 'Time-resolved diode dosimetry calibration through Monte Carlo modeling for in\xa0vivo passive scattered proton therapy range verification.', 'Using CBCT for pretreatment range check in proton therapy: a phantom study for prostate treatment by anterior-posterior beam.']"""

Methods:   A previously developed inverse optimization method was applied retrospectively to determine optimal objective function weights for 315 treated patients. The authors used an overlap volume ratio (OV) of bladder and rectum for different PTV expansions and overlap volume histogram slopes (OVSR and OVSB for the rectum and bladder, respectively) as explanatory variables that quantify patient geometry. Using the optimal weights as ground truth, the authors trained and applied three prediction models: logistic regression (LR), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The population average of the optimal objective function weights was also calculated.  Results:   The OV at 0.4 cm and OVSR at 0.1 cm features were found to be the most predictive of the weights. The authors observed comparable performance (i.e., no statistically significant difference) between LR, MLR, and KNN methodologies, with LR appearing to perform the best. All three machine learning models outperformed the population average by a statistically significant amount over a range of clinical metrics including bladder/rectum V53Gy, bladder/rectum V70Gy, and dose to the bladder, rectum, CTV, and PTV. When comparing the weights directly, the LR model predicted bladder and rectum weights that had, on average, a 73% and 74% relative improvement over the population average weights, respectively. The treatment plans resulting from the LR weights had, on average, a rectum V70Gy that was 35% closer to the clinical plan and a bladder V70Gy that was 29% closer, compared to the population average weights. Similar results were observed for all other clinical metrics.  Conclusions:   The authors demonstrated that the KNN and MLR weight prediction methodologies perform comparably to the LR model and can produce clinical quality treatment plans by simultaneously predicting multiple weights that capture trade-offs associated with sparing multiple OARs.""","""['Justin J Boutilier', 'Taewoo Lee', 'Tim Craig', 'Michael B Sharpe', 'Timothy C Y Chan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Predicting objective function weights from patient anatomy in prostate IMRT treatment planning.', 'An overlap-volume-histogram based method for rectal dose prediction and automated treatment planning in the external beam prostate radiotherapy following hydrogel injection.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'New technologies for the radiotherapy of prostate cancer.

Incubation with DQA at concentrations between 1.5 and 100 microM from 24 to 48 h decreases cell viability. The decrease in cell viability together with a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential induced an increase in reactive oxygen species production and cell death via caspase-3 dependent apoptotic pathway. QA was shown to cause moderate to strong cell death in a time and concentration dependent manner, causing a most advantageous effect at a concentration of 10 microM applied for a long 48 h time period, which might be a consequence of the kinetics of intracellular DQA accumulation in mitochondria, but also of the mechanisms of DQA-induced cell death.

Methods:   We prospectively included patients aged â¥70 years who had solid or hematologic malignancies and in whom the CGA was performed by geriatricians in two French teaching hospitals. We identified independent predictors of 1-year mortality after study inclusion, using multivariate Cox models stratified on inpatient/outpatient status. We built three multivariate Cox models, since strong correlations linked activities of daily living (ADL), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), and timed get-up-and-go test (GUG) results; and since physicians' preferences for these three assessments vary. A sensitivity analysis was performed using multiple imputation.  Results:   Of the 993 patients (mean age, 80.2 years; 51.2% men), 58.2% were outpatients and 46% had metastatic disease. Colorectal cancer was the most common malignancy (21.4%). Mortality rates after 6 and 12 months were 30.1% and 41.2%, respectively. In all models, tumor site and metastatic status (p < .001), age >80 years (p < .05), higher number of severe comorbidities (p < .05), and malnutrition (p < .001) were associated with death independently from impaired ECOG-PS (p < .001), ADL (p < .001), and GUG (p < .001). The adverse effect of metastatic status differed significantly across tumor sites, being greatest for breast and prostate cancer (p < .001). Multiple imputation produced similar results.  Conclusion:   The predictors of 1-year mortality identified in our study may help physicians select the optimal cancer-treatment strategy in elderly patients.""","""['Emilie Ferrat', 'Elena Paillaud', 'Marie Laurent', 'AurÃ©lie Le Thuaut', 'Philippe Caillet', 'Christophe Tournigand', 'Jean-LÃ©on Lagrange', 'Florence CanouÃ¯-Poitrine', 'Sylvie Bastuji-Garin;ELPACA Study Group']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci""","""['Predictors of early death risk in older patients treated with first-line chemotherapy for cancer.', 'Comprehensive geriatric assessment in the decision-making process in elderly patients with cancer: ELCAPA study.', 'Palliative chemotherapy in elderly patients with common metastatic malignancies: A Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group registry analysis of management, outcome and clinical benefit predictors.', 'Influence of geriatric consultation with comprehensive geriatric assessment on final therapeutic decision in elderly cancer patients.', 'Optimal management of elderly cancer patients: usefulness of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment.', 'Geriatric Assessment Predictors of 1-Year Mortality in Older Adults With GI Malignancies: A Survival Tree Analysis.', 'Clinical outcomes of brain metastasectomy from soft tissue and bone sarcomas: a systematic review.', 'Effectiveness of Geriatric Assessment-Driven Interventions on Survival and Functional and Nutritional Status in Older Patients with Head and Neck Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial (EGeSOR).', ""Prospective Comparison of Geriatric Assessment and Provider's Assessment of Older Adults With Metastatic Breast Cancer in the Community."", 'Measuring Walking Speed Failed to Predict Early Death and Toxicity in Elderly Patients with Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Selected for Undergoing First-Line Systemic Treatment: An Observational Exploratory Study.']"""

Lipins exhibit dual function as enzymes catalyzing the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and as co-transcriptional regulators. Thus, they are able to regulate lipid homeostasis at several nodal points. Here, we show that lipin-1 is up-regulated in several cancer cell lines and overexpressed in 50 % of high grade prostate cancers. The proliferation of prostate and breast cancer cells, but not of non-tumorigenic cells, was repressed upon lipin-1 knock-down. Lipin-1 depletion also decreased cancer cell migration through RhoA activation. Lipin-1 silencing did not significantly affect global lipid synthesis but enhanced the cellular concentration of phosphatidic acid. In parallel, autophagy was induced while AKT and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation were repressed. We also observed a compensatory regulation between lipin-1 and lipin-2 and demonstrated that their co-silencing aggravates the phenotype induced by lipin-1 silencing alone. Most interestingly, lipin-1 depletion or lipins inhibition with propranolol sensitized cancer cells to rapamycin. These data indicate that lipin-1 controls main cellular processes involved in cancer progression and that its targeting, alone or in combination with other treatments, could open new avenues in anticancer therapy.""","""['Laura BrohÃ©e', 'StÃ©phane Demine', 'JÃ©rome Willems', 'Thierry Arnould', 'Alain C Colige', 'Christophe F Deroanne']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Effects of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor CCI-779 used alone or with chemotherapy on human prostate cancer cells and xenografts.', 'Geraniol induces cooperative interaction of apoptosis and autophagy to elicit cell death in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Dual inhibition by S6K1 and Elf4E is essential for controlling cellular growth and invasion in bladder cancer.', 'Dual function lipin proteins and glycerolipid metabolism.', 'Lipins, lipinopathies, and the modulation of cellular lipid storage and signaling.', 'A membrane-sensing mechanism links lipid metabolism to protein degradation at the nuclear envelope.', 'Lipin-1 stability and its adipogenesis functions are regulated in contrasting ways by AKT1 and LKB1.', 'LPIN1 Induces Gefitinib Resistance in EGFR Inhibitor-Resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Investigation of the effects of overexpression of jumping translocation breakpoint (JTB) protein in MCF7 cells for potential use as a biomarker in breast cancer.', 'Tumor Glucose and Fatty Acid Metabolism in the Context of Anthracycline and Taxane-Based (Neo)Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Carcinomas.']"""

Targeting TR4 with lentiviral silencing RNA significantly suppressed prostate cancer CD133(+) S/P cell invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism dissection found that TR4 transcriptionally regulates the oncogene EZH2 via binding to its 5' promoter region. The consequences of targeting TR4 to suppress EZH2 expression may then suppress the expression of its downstream key metastasis-related genes, including NOTCH1, TGFÎ²1, SLUG, and MMP9. Rescue approaches via adding the EZH2 reversed the TR4-mediated prostate cancer S/P cell invasion.

Costs were estimated as incremental costs due to cancer for a six-month period and they included direct medical costs, productivity costs and costs of informal care.  Methods:   Resource use and cost data, irrespective of who the payer was, were retrieved from the registries for 611 PCa patients in the Helsinki area in Finland. In addition, patients answered background questions concerning informal care, work capacity and educational status. Patients were divided into four mutually exclusive groups based on disease state and time from diagnosis: primary (local disease, first six months after diagnosis; n = 47), rehabilitation (local disease, 0.5-1.5 years after diagnosis or recurrence; n = 158), remission (local disease, more than 1.5 years after diagnosis; n = 317) and metastatic (after detection of metastases; n = 89).  Results:   Costs differed markedly between the states of disease. Mean direct health care costs for the six-month periods were: primary treatment state â¬ 2750, rehabilitation state â¬ 1143, remission state â¬ 760 and metastatic state â¬ 7423. Productivity costs were also highest (â¬ 4277) in the metastatic state. Overall, the average share of indirect costs was around one third of the total costs. However, when including informal care, their combined share of the total costs increased to around half or more.  Conclusions:   The results provided state-specific estimates of the direct health care and indirect costs of PCa in Finland. The treatment of metastatic disease is significantly more costly than treatment of early stage PCa. Although direct medical costs were higher compared to productivity costs, they should be taken into consideration when evaluating the costs of PCa.""","""['Saku Torvinen', 'Niilo FÃ¤rkkilÃ¤', 'Risto P Roine', 'Harri Sintonen', 'Tiina Saarto', 'Kimmo Taari']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Costs of colorectal cancer in different states of the disease.', 'Costs in Different States of Breast Cancer.', 'The economic burden of prostate cancer - a Swedish prevalence-based register study.', 'Health-related quality of life, satisfaction, and economic outcome measures in studies of prostate cancer screening and treatment, 1990-2000.', 'The economic burden of prostate cancer.

However, PR protein expression in cancer-associated stroma during prostate cancer progression has not been profiled. Since the phenotypes of prostate stromal cells change dynamically as tumors progress, whether the PR plays a role in regulating stromal cell differentiation needs to be investigated.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry assays measured PR protein levels on human prostate tissue microarrays containing 367 tissue cores from benign prostate, prostate tumors with different Gleason scores, tumors under various durations of castration therapy, and tumors at the castration-resistant stage. Immunoblotting assays determined whether PR regulated the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA), vimentin, and fibroblast specific protein (FSP) in human prostate stromal cells.  Results:   PR protein levels decreased in cancer-associated stroma when compared with that in benign prostate stroma. This reduction in PR expression was not correlated with Gleason scores. PR protein levels were elevated by castration therapy, but reduced to pre-castration levels when tumors progressed to the castration-resistant stage. Enhanced PR expression in human prostate stromal cells increased Î±-SMA, but decreased vimentin and FSP protein levels ligand-independently.

The cancer cells residing in the avascular region of the tumor confront various metabolic stresses and continuously adapt mechanisms to overcome them. We hypothesized that TLR4 activation might provide direct survival advantage to metabolically stressed PCa cells.  Methods:   We first investigated the effect of LPS on survival of serum deprived PCa cells. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in TLR4 mediated PCa survival, we next investigated change in expression of markers for apoptosis, senescence and autophagy. Ultimately, the effect of LPS on established prostate tumors was confirmed in vivo using a syngeneic rat model for PCa.  Results:   Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated TLR4 activation significantly enhanced survival of serum deprived (SD) PC3, DU145 and MAT-LyLu PCa cells. TLR4 inhibition by a specific inhibitor resulted in rapid death of SD-PC3 cells, which was significantly suppressed by LPS. Interestingly, LPS treatment suppressed macroautophagy in SD-PC3 cells and increased expression of CCL2 (C-C motif ligand-2), a known autophagy inhibitor and pro-survival factor. Intra-tumor LPS injection resulted in increased tumor mass, induced TLR4 activation, suppressed autophagy, and increased the macrophage population in MAT-LyLu-tumors.  Conclusions:   Our study reveals that bacterial LPS enhance survival of PCa cells under conditions of nutrient stress through TLR4 activation. Moreover, LPS induces overexpression of CCL2 involved in the suppression of starvation-induced macroautophagy in PCa cells, and enhanced macrophage population in prostate tumors in vivo. Taken together, the current study suggests the importance of bacterial infection or TLR4-activation in prostate cancer pathogenesis.""","""['Sumeet Jain', 'Sujit Suklabaidya', 'Biswajit Das', 'Sunil K Raghav', 'Surinder K Batra', 'Shantibhusan Senapati']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhances prostate cancer metastasis potentially through NF-ÎºB activation and recurrent dexamethasone administration fails to suppress it in vivo.', 'Small interfering RNA-directed targeting of Toll-like receptor 4 inhibits human prostate cancer cell invasion, survival, and tumorigenicity.', 'Toll-like receptor 4 ligation confers chemoresistance to docetaxel on PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'LPS/TLR4 signal transduction pathway.', ""Vinorelbine's anti-tumor actions may depend on the mitotic apoptosis, autophagy and inflammation: hypotheses with implications for chemo-immunotherapy of advanced cancers and pediatric gliomas."", 'Biochemical, functional and genomic characterization of a new probiotic Ligilactobacillus salivarius F14 from the gut of tribes of Odisha.', 'Activation of Innate Immunity by Therapeutic Nucleic Acids.', 'Differential Expression of the TLR4 Gene in Pan-Cancer and Its Related Mechanism.', 'MD2 blockage prevents the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway.', 'TLR4 activation leads to anti-EGFR therapy resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Prostate cancer is associated with low levels of adiponectin, which have been proposed as an independent risk factor for this malignancy. Aim of this study was to examine whether hypoadiponectinaemia in prostate is associated with insulin resistance.  Experimental design:   Plasma samples and covariate data in the context of a case-control study of 300 Greek men were evaluated including 75 patients with prostate cancer, 75 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 150 age-matched healthy controls.  Results:   Patients with prostate cancer had significantly lower plasma adiponectin levels compared with the other two groups, that is BPH patients and healthy controls (7.4 Â± 5 ng/mL vs. 11.5 Â± 6.4 ng/mL and 12.8 Â± 8 ng/mL, respectively). On the other hand, no statistically significant differences were found between patients with prostate cancer and the other two groups for both HOMA-IR and QUICKI (P-value = 0.551). As expected, in all three groups, the levels of adiponectin correlated negatively with HOMA-IR (rho = -0.214, P-value = 0.006), QUICKI (rho = 0.214, P-value = 0.006) and insulin levels (rho = 0.942, P-value < 0.001).  Conclusion:   In spite of what would have been expected from the relevant literature, our data suggest that the hypoadiponectinaemia in prostatic cancer does not appear to be associated with insulin resistance.""","""['Konstantinos Michalakis', 'Maria Venihaki', 'Christos Mantzoros', 'Andriani Vazaiou', 'Ioannis Ilias', 'Alexandros Gryparis', 'Andrew N Margioris']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur J Clin Invest""","""['Serum adiponectin concentrations and tissue expression of adiponectin receptors are reduced in patients with prostate cancer: a case control study.', 'Correlation between the inflammatory factors and adipocytokines with gestational diabetes mellitus and their change in puerperium.', 'Prostate cancer and adiponectin.', 'Insulin resistance: an independent risk factor for lung cancer?', 'Role of Adiponectin in prostate cancer.', 'Obesity and COVID-19: A jigsaw puzzle with still missing pieces.', 'Proper Management of People with Obesity during the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection and obesity: Common inflammatory and metabolic aspects.', 'Appetite-regulating hormones-leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin-and the development of prostate cancer: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis.', 'Systemic Adiponectin Values in Humans Require Standardized Units.']"""

The authors have worked systematically to map human endothelial receptors (""vascular zip codes"") within tumors through direct peptide library selection in cancer patients. Previously, they selected a ligand-binding motif to the interleukin-11 receptor alpha (IL-11RÎ±) in the human vasculature.  Methods:   The authors generated a ligand-directed, peptidomimetic drug (bone metastasis-targeting peptidomimetic-11 [BMTP-11]) for IL-11RÎ±-based human tumor vascular targeting. Preclinical studies (efficacy/toxicity) included evaluating BMTP-11 in prostate cancer xenograft models, drug localization, targeted apoptotic effects, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses, and dose-range determination, including formal (good laboratory practice) toxicity across rodent and nonhuman primate species. The initial BMTP-11 clinical development also is reported based on a single-institution, open-label, first-in-class, first-in-man trial (National Clinical Trials number NCT00872157) in patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer.  Results:   BMTP-11 was preclinically promising and, thus, was chosen for clinical development in patients. Limited numbers of patients who had castrate-resistant prostate cancer with osteoblastic bone metastases were enrolled into a phase 0 trial with biology-driven endpoints. The authors demonstrated biopsy-verified localization of BMTP-11 to tumors in the bone marrow and drug-induced apoptosis in all patients. Moreover, the maximum tolerated dose was identified on a weekly schedule (20-30 mg/m(2) ). Finally, a renal dose-limiting toxicity was determined, namely, dose-dependent, reversible nephrotoxicity with proteinuria and casts involving increased serum creatinine.  Conclusions:   These biologic endpoints establish BMTP-11 as a targeted drug candidate in metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Within a larger discovery context, the current findings indicate that functional tumor vascular ligand-receptor targeting systems may be identified through direct combinatorial selection of peptide libraries in cancer patients.""","""['Renata Pasqualini', 'Randall E Millikan', 'Dawn R Christianson', 'Marina CardÃ³-Vila', 'Wouter H P Driessen', 'Ricardo J Giordano', 'Amin Hajitou', 'Anh G Hoang', 'Sijin Wen', 'Kirstin F Barnhart', 'Wallace B Baze', 'Valerie D Marcott', 'David H Hawke', 'Kim-Anh Do', 'Nora M Navone', 'Eleni Efstathiou', 'Patricia Troncoso', 'Roy R Lobb', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Wadih Arap']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Addressing apoptosis to tumor zip codes.', 'Prostate cancer: New IL-11RÎ± drug is on target.', 'Prostate cancer: New IL-11RÎ± drug is on target.', 'BMTP-11 is active in preclinical models of human osteosarcoma and a candidate targeted drug for clinical translation.', 'Addressing apoptosis to tumor zip codes.', 'Current perspectives on bone metastases in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'The IL6-like Cytokine Family: Role and Biomarker Potential in Breast Cancer.', 'Vascular Endothelial Cells: Heterogeneity and Targeting Approaches.', 'Exposure to Bacteriophages T4 and M13 Increases Integrin Gene Expression and Impairs Migration of Human PC-3 Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting a cell surface vitamin D receptor on tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Ablation of Stromal Cells with a Targeted Proapoptotic Peptide Suppresses Cancer Chemotherapy Resistance and Metastasis.']"""

We established the analytical procedure with the chemical derivatizations (i.e., sialic acid neutralization and stable isotopic labeling) of N-glycans using a model glycoprotein (bovine fetuin).

Finally, this method was applied to direct comparison of the total N-glycan profiles between normal human sera (n = 8) and prostate cancer patient sera (n = 17). The intensities of the N-glycan peaks from i-QTaG method showed a good linearity (R(2) > 0.99) with the amount of the bovine fetuin glycoproteins.

Previous studies have suggested that soy phytoestrogens might regulate DNA methylation at individual candidate gene loci and that they play a crucial role as potential therapeutic agents for prostate cancer. The purpose of our study was to examine the modulation effects of phytoestrogens on a genome-wide scale in regards to DNA methylation in prostate cancer. Prostate cancer cell lines DU-145 and LNCaP were treated with 40 Î¼M of genistein and 110 Î¼M of daidzein. DNMT inhibitor 5-azacytidine (2 Î¼M) and the methylating agent budesonide (2 Î¼M) were used to compare their demethylation/methylation effects with phytoestrogens. The regulatory effects of phytoestrogens on DNA methylation were analyzed by using a methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation method coupled with Human DNA Methylation Microarrays (MeDIP-chip). We observed that the methylation profiles of 58 genes were altered by genistein and daidzein treatments in DU-145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. In addition, the methylation frequencies of the MAD1L1, TRAF7, KDM4B, and hTERT genes were remarkably modified by genistein treatment. Our results suggest that the modulation effects of phytoestrogens on DNA methylation essentially lead to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis.

EphB4 over-production promotes ligand-independent signaling pathways that increase cancer cell viability and stimulate migration and invasion. Several studies have shown that normal ligand-dependent signaling is tumour suppressive and therefore novel therapeutics which block the tumour promoting ligand-independent signaling and/or stimulate tumour suppressive ligand-dependent signaling will find application in the treatment of cancer. An EphB4-specific polyclonal antibody, targeting a region of 200 amino acids in the extracellular portion of EphB4, showed potent in vitro anti-cancer effects measured by an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in anchorage independent growth. Peptide exclusion was used to identify the epitope targeted by this antibody within the cysteine-rich region of the EphB4 protein, a sequence defined as a potential ligand interacting interface. Addition of antibody to cancer cells resulted in phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the EphB4 protein, suggesting a mechanism that is ligand mimetic and tumour suppressive.

This evolutionary process culminates in the formation of metastases, which is the cause of 90% of cancer-related deaths. However, despite its clinical importance, little is known about the principles governing the dissemination of cancer cells to distant organs. Although the hypothesis that each metastasis originates from a single tumour cell is generally supported, recent studies using mouse models of cancer demonstrated the existence of polyclonal seeding from and interclonal cooperation between multiple subclones. Here we sought definitive evidence for the existence of polyclonal seeding in human malignancy and to establish the clonal relationship among different metastases in the context of androgen-deprived metastatic prostate cancer. Using whole-genome sequencing, we characterized multiple metastases arising from prostate tumours in ten patients. Integrated analyses of subclonal architecture revealed the patterns of metastatic spread in unprecedented detail. Metastasis-to-metastasis spread was found to be common, either through de novo monoclonal seeding of daughter metastases or, in five cases, through the transfer of multiple tumour clones between metastatic sites. Lesions affecting tumour suppressor genes usually occur as single events, whereas mutations in genes involved in androgen receptor signalling commonly involve multiple, convergent events in different metastases.

Surprisingly, we found that this metastasis is driven by MYC, and not AKT, activation. Here, we show that cell-cell communication by IL6 drives the AKT-MYC switch through activation of the AKT-suppressing phosphatase PHLPP2, when PTEN and p53 are lost together, but not separately. IL6 then communicates a downstream program of STAT3-mediated MYC activation, which drives cell proliferation. Similarly, in tissues, peak proliferation in Pten/Trp53-mutant primary and metastatic prostate cancer does not correlate with activated AKT, but with STAT3/MYC activation instead. Mechanistically, MYC strongly activates the AKT phosphatase PHLPP2 in primary cells and prostate cancer metastasis. We show genetically that Phlpp2 is essential for dictating the proliferation of MYC-mediated AKT suppression.

Experimental design:   The PSA-survival modeling framework was based on data from two phase III studies, COU-AA-301 (chemotherapy pretreated, n = 1,184) and COU-AA-302 (chemotherapy naÃ¯ve, n = 1,081), and included a mixed-effects tumor growth inhibition model and a Cox proportional hazards survival model.  Results:   The effect of AA on PSA kinetics was significant (P < 0.0001) and comparable between the chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve and -pretreated patients. PSA kinetics [e.g., PSA nadir, PSA response rate (â¥30%, 50%, and 90%), time to PSA progression, PSA doubling time (PSADT)] were highly associated with OS in both populations. The model-based posttreatment PSADT had the strongest association with OS (HR â¼0.9 in both populations). The models could accurately predict survival outcomes. After adjusting for PSA kinetic endpoints, the treatment effect of AA on survival was no longer statistically significant in both studies, and the Prentice criteria of surrogacy were met for the PSA kinetic endpoints. A strong correlation was also observed between PSA and radiographic progression-free survival.  Conclusions:   The analysis revealed a consistent treatment effect of AA on PSA kinetics and strong associations between PSA kinetics and OS in chemotherapy-pretreated and -naÃ¯ve patients, thereby providing a rationale to consider PSA kinetics as surrogacy endpoints to indicate clinical benefit in AA-treated patients with mCRPC regardless of chemotherapy treatment.""","""['Xu S Xu', 'Charles J Ryan', 'Kim Stuyckens', 'Matthew R Smith', 'Fred Saad', 'Thomas W Griffin', 'Youn C Park', 'Margaret K Yu', 'An Vermeulen', 'Italo Poggesi', 'Partha Nandy']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Association of early PSA decline and time to PSA progression in abiraterone acetate-treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; a post-hoc analysis of Japanese phase 2 trials.', 'Impact of bone-targeted therapies in chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate: post hoc analysis of study COU-AA-302.', 'Prior Endocrine Therapy Impact on Abiraterone Acetate Clinical Efficacy in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post-hoc Analysis of Randomised Phase 3 Studies.', 'Indirect comparison between abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Abiraterone for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Baseline Plasma Tumor DNA (ctDNA) Correlates with PSA Kinetics in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Treated with Abiraterone or Enzalutamide.', 'High Tumor Burden Predicts Poor Response to Enzalutamide in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Early Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Change at Four Weeks of the First-Line Treatment Using Abiraterone and Enzalutamide Could Predict Early/Primary Resistance in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'PSA Kinetics as Prognostic Markers of Overall Survival in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Abiraterone Acetate.', 'Editorial Comment to Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism from adenocarcinoma of the prostate.']"""

After PEN-mediated p53 transfection, expression level of p53 in HeLa and PC3 cells was up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels. Due to the exogenous p53 expression, the inhibition of cell proliferation was observed through MTT analysis, attributing to the activation of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Using flow cytometric analysis, early apoptotic ratios of 54.95% and 27.06% after PEN-mediated p53 transfection were detected in PC-3 and HeLa cells, respectively, indicating that PC-3 cells were more sensitive to the exogenous p53 transfection than HeLa cells.

Although enzalutamide is initially effective, disease progression inevitably ensues with the emergence of resistance. Intratumoral hypoxia is also associated with CRPC progression and treatment resistance. Given that both AR and hypoxia inducible factor-1 Î± (HIF-1Î±) are key regulators of these processes, dual targeting of both signaling axes represents an attractive therapeutic approach. Crosstalk of the AR and HIF-1Î± signaling pathways were examined in prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1) with assays measuring the effect of androgen and hypoxia on AR-dependent and hypoxia-inducible gene transcription, protein expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. HIF-1Î± inhibition was achieved by siRNA silencing HIF-1Î± or via chetomin, a disruptor of HIF-1Î±-p300 interactions. In prostate cancer cells, the gene expression of AR targets (KLK3, FKBP5, TMPRSS2) was repressed by HIF-signaling; conversely, specific HIF-1Î± target expression was induced by dihydrotestosterone-mediated AR signaling. Treatment of CRPC cells with enzalutamide or HIF-1Î± inhibition attenuated AR-regulated and HIF-1Î±-mediated gene transcription. The combination of enzalutamide and HIF-1Î± inhibition was more effective than either treatment alone. Similarly, the combination also reduced vascular endothelial growth factor protein levels. HIF-1Î± siRNA synergistically enhanced the inhibitory effect of enzalutamide on cell growth in LNCaP and enzalutamide-resistant 22Rv1 cells via increased enzalutamide-induced apoptosis.

Methods:   The study was performed using 395 patients with histologically verified prostate cancer and 253 healthy male controls.  Results:   The CC genotype of rs2077647 was significantly associated with prostate cancer (OR = 1.61). No association was found between rs3798577 polymorphism and prostate cancer.

HIF-1Î±, which is up-regulated by PGE2 in LNCaP cells and PC3 cells, has been shown to contribute to metastasis and chemo-resistance of castrate-resistant PC (a lethal form of PC) and to promote in PC cells migration, invasion, angiogenesis and chemoresistance. The selective blockade of PGE2-EP2 signaling pathway in PC3 cells results in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and invasion. PGE2 affects many mechanisms that have been shown to play a role in carcinogenesis such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Recently, we have found in PC3 cells that most of these PGE2-induced cancer-related features are due to intracellular PGE2 (iPGE2). Here, we aimed to study in PC3 cells the role of iPGE2-intracellular EP2 (iEP2)-HIF-1Î± signaling in several events linked to PC progression using an experimental approach involving pharmacological inhibition of the prostaglandin uptake transporter and EGFR and pharmacological and genetic modulation of EP2 receptor and HIF-1Î±. We found that iPGE2 increases HIF-1Î± expression through iEP2-dependent EGFR transactivation and that inhibition of any of the axis iEP2-EGFR-HIF-1Î± in cells treated with PGE2 or EP2 agonist results in prevention of the increase in PC3 cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion and angiogenesis in vitro. Of note, PGE2 induced EP2 antagonist-sensitive DNA synthesis in nuclei isolated from PC3 cells, which indicates that they have functional EP2 receptors.

CTV was subdivided into superior and inferior CTV; whole rectal volume was subdivided into superior and inferior rectum and anal volume. Concordance index (CI) of CBCT treatment volumes compared with planning volumes was calculated and displacements were measured.  Results:   Whole rectal, superior and inferior rectum and anal CI were significantly improved with the ERB by 21%, 17%, 26% and 17% respectively (P < 0.0001). Overall CTV and inferior CTV CI was improved by 4% with the ERB (overall CTV P = 0.021; Inferior CTV P < 0.0001).

Patients subjects and methods:   A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 62 couples randomly assigned to the six-session CECT programme or care as usual. The couple's relationship function (primary outcome), and coping, cancer distress and mental health (secondary outcomes) were evaluated at T0 (baseline), T1 (after treatment) and T2 (9 months from T0). A repeated-measures analysis of covariance model, which incorporated T0 measurements as a covariate, was used to compare treatment groups at T1 and T2.  Results:   After CECT, patients reported significantly greater use of adaptive coping (P = 0.03) and problem-focused coping (P = 0.01). These gains were maintained at follow-up, while relationship cohesion had improved (P = 0.03), as had relationship function for younger patients (P = 0.01). Younger partners reported less cancer-specific distress (P = 0.008), avoidance (P = 0.04), intrusive thought (P = 0.006), and hyperarousal (P = 0.01).

CECT was acceptable to couples, alleviated long-term relationship decline, and is therefore suitable as a preventative mental health intervention for couples facing prostate cancer.

The other four antibodies detect a non-specific signal at ~150 kDa as evidenced by its abundance in PHLPP1 KO tissues. Results suggest Cosmo antibody is a better reagent to detect PHLPP1Î± by Western blot. In contrast, we found it unsuitable for immunofluorescence applications in brain. Our findings caution interpretation of the ~150 kDa band detected by some PHLPP1 antibodies in rodent and human tissues. Results also recapitulate the importance of including molecular weight standards in Western blot data to simplify retrospective analysis.""","""['Travis C Jackson', 'HÃ¼lya Bayir', 'Milos D Ikonomovic', 'Keri Janesko-Feldman', 'Zaichuan Mi', 'Tianyan Gao', 'Edwin K Jackson', 'Patrick M Kochanek']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['PHLPP1 splice variants differentially regulate AKT and PKCÎ± signaling in hippocampal neurons: characterization of PHLPP proteins in the adult hippocampus.', 'Aberrant expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 correlates with poor prognosis in patients with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Emerging roles of PHLPP phosphatases in the nervous system.', 'Oncogenic suppression of PHLPP1 in human melanoma.', 'PHLPP Signaling in Immune Cells.', 'Relationship between polycomb-group protein BMI-1 and phosphatases regulating AKT phosphorylation level in endometrial cancer.', 'Infants Uniquely Express High Levels of RBM3 and Other Cold-Adaptive Neuroprotectant Proteins in the Human Brain.', 'Acute Physiology and Neurologic Outcomes after Brain Injury in SCOP/PHLPP1 KO Mice.', 'Developing high-quality mouse monoclonal antibodies for neuroscience research - approaches, perspectives and opportunities.']"""

Initially, we performed RNAseq from two human mammary epithelial cell lines and evaluated several aspects of the transcriptomes generated by linear amplification of Poly (A)(+) mRNA species, including transcript representation, variability and abundance. Our protocol showed to be efficient with respect to full-length transcript coverage and quantitative expression levels. We then evaluated the applicability of using this protocol in a more realistic research scenario, analyzing tumor tissue samples microdissected by laser capture. In order to increase the quantification power of the libraries only the 3' end of transcripts were sequenced. We found highly reproducible RNAseq data among amplified tumor samples, with a median Spearman's correlation of 80%, strongly suggesting that the amplification step and library protocol preparation lead to a consistent transcriptional profile.

They are also the major bioactive compounds found in Eurycoma longifolia which is commonly used as traditional medicine in South East Asia to treat various ailments including sexual dysfunction and infertility. These uses are attributed to its ability to improve testosterone level in men. Chronic consumption of E. longifolia extracts has been reported to increase testosterone level in men and animal model but its effect on prostate growth remains unknown. Therefore, the present study investigates the effects of a standardized total quassinoids composition (SQ40) containing 40% of the total quassinoids found in E. longifolia on LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line. SQ40 inhibited LNCaP cell growth at IC50 value of 5.97 Î¼g/mL while the IC50 on RWPE-1 human prostate normal cells was 59.26 Î¼g/mL. SQ40 also inhibited 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone-stimulated growth in LNCaP cells dose-dependently. The inhibitory effect of SQ40 in anchorage-independent growth of LNCaP cells was also demonstrated using soft agar assay. SQ40 suppressed LNCaP cell growth via G0/G1 phase arrest which was accompanied by the down-regulation of CDK4, CDK2, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin D3 and up-regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 protein levels. SQ40 at higher concentrations or longer treatment duration can cause G2M growth arrest leading to apoptotic cell death as demonstrated by the detection of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in LNCaP cells. Moreover, SQ40 also inhibited androgen receptor translocation to nucleus which is important for the transactivation of its target gene, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and resulted in a significant reduction of PSA secretion after the treatment. In addition, intraperitoneal injection of 5 and 10 mg/kg of SQ40 also significantly suppressed the LNCaP tumor growth on mouse xenograft model. Results from the present study suggest that the standardized total quassinoids composition from E. longifolia promotes anti-prostate cancer activities in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Kind Leng Tong', 'Kit Lam Chan', 'Sazaly AbuBakar', 'Bin Seng Low', 'Hai Qiu Ma', 'Pooi Fong Wong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Five new quassinoids and cytotoxic constituents from the roots of Eurycoma longifolia.', 'Quassinoids from Eurycoma longifolia.', 'Quassinoids from the Roots of Eurycoma longifolia and Their Anti-Proliferation Activities.', 'Eurycoma longifolia, A Potential Phytomedicine for the Treatment of Cancer: Evidence of p53-mediated Apoptosis in Cancerous Cells.', 'Review on a Traditional Herbal Medicine, Eurycoma longifolia Jack (Tongkat Ali): Its Traditional Uses, Chemistry, Evidence-Based Pharmacology and Toxicology.', 'Eurycoma longifolia: an overview on the pharmacological properties for the treatment of common cancer.', 'Advances in Molecular Regulation of Prostate Cancer Cells by Top Natural Products of Malaysia.', 'DHOK Exerts Anti-Cancer Effect Through Autophagy Inhibition in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.', 'A review on extraction techniques and therapeutic value of polar bioactives from Asian medicinal herbs: Case study on Orthosiphon aristatus, Eurycoma longifolia and Andrographis paniculata.']"""

CTCs may undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition where many epithelial cell characteristics are lost. Therefore, CTC isolation systems relying on epithelial cell markers are at risk of losing important subpopulations of cells. Here, a simple acoustophoresis-based cell separation instrument is presented. Cells are uniquely separated while maintained in their initial suspending medium, thus eliminating the need for a secondary cell-free medium to hydrodynamically pre-position them before the separation. When characterizing the system using polystyrene particles, 99.6 Â± 0.2% of 7 Î¼m diameter particles were collected through one outlet while 98.8 Â± 0.5% of 5 Î¼m particles were recovered through a second outlet. Prostate cancer cells (DU145) spiked into blood were enriched from white blood cells at a sample flow rate of 100 Î¼L min(-1) providing 86.5 Â± 6.7% recovery of the cancer cells with 1.1 Â± 0.2% contamination of white blood cells. By increasing the acoustic intensity a recovery of 94.8 Â± 2.8% of cancer cells was achieved with 2.2 Â± 0.6% contamination of white blood cells. The single inlet approach makes this instrument insensitive to acoustic impedance mismatch; a phenomenon reported to importantly affect accuracy in multi-laminar flow stream acoustophoresis.

Thus, CAPRA post-surgical (CAPRA-S) score has been developed based on six criteria (prostate specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis, pathological Gleason score, and information on surgical margin, seminal vesicle invasion, extracapsular extension and lymph node involvement) for the prediction of post-surgical recurrences. In the present study, biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free probabilities after open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RP) were evaluated by the CAPRA-S scoring system and its three-risk level model.  Materials and methods:   CAPRA-S scores (0-12) of our 240 radical prostatectomies performed between January 2000-May 2011 were calculated. Patients were distributed into CAPRA-S score groups and also into three-risk groups as low, intermediate and high. BCR-free probabilities were assessed and compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression. Ability of CAPRA-S in BCR detection was evaluated by concordance index (c-index).  Results:   BCR was present in 41 of total 240 patients (17.1%) and the mean follow-up time was 51.7Â±33.0 months. Mean BCR-free survival time was 98.3 months (95% CI: 92.3-104.2). Of the patients in low, intermediate and high risk groups, 5.4%, 22.0% and 58.8% had BCR, respectively and the difference among the three groups was significant (P=0.0001). C-indices of CAPRA-S score and three-risk groups for detecting BCR-free probabilities in 5-yr were 0.87 and 0.81, respectively.

Vitamin D (1,25dihydroxy vitamin D) is linked to many biological processes that influence oncogenesis but data on relations between its genetic variants and cancer risk have been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to determine associations between a vitamin D genetic polymorphism and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Genomic DNA was extracted from 124 Jordanian prostate cancer patients and 100 healthy volunteers. Ethical approval was granted from the ethical committee at Hashemite University and written consent was given by all patients. PCR was used to amplify the vitamin D receptor Fok1 polymorphism fragment. 25(OH)D serum levels were measured by competitive immunoassay.  Results:   All genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genotype frequency for Fok1 genotypes FF, Ff and ff was 30.7%, 61.3% and 8.06%, for prostate cancer patients, while frequencies for the control group was 28.0%, 66.0% and 6.0%, respectively, with no significant differences. Vitamin D serum level was significantly lower in prostate cancer patients (mean 7.7 ng/ml) compared to the control group (21.8 ng/ml). No significant association was noted between 25(OH)D and VDR Fok1 gene polymorphism among Jordanians overall, but significant associations were evident among prostate cancer patients (FF, Ff and ff : 25(OH)D levels of 6.2, 8.2 and 9.9) and controls (19.0, 22.5 and 26.3, respectively). An inverse association was noted between 25(OH)D serum level less than 10 ng/ml and prostate cancer risk (OR 35.5 and 95% CI 14.3- 88.0).

Materials and methods:   To compare the preembedding methods, we took 36 nonfragmented cores from fresh prostatectomy specimens for each method, fixed them in formalin and made histological slides. The comparison criteria were a core section area in the middle section and the number of fragments per core after processing.  Results:   Two methods (preembedding on the edge of thick cardboard and on biplicated paper) provided a bigger section area of specimens. The differences in amounts of fragments were very small among the methods mentioned above and the preembedding glass with grooves, but preembedding between two sponges in a histological cassette showed higher fragmentation.

Method:   Between 2000 and 2012, 1066 patients underwent rectal excision for rectal cancer. Of these, 236 were treated by conventional radiotherapy (45 Gy) and sphincter-saving resection (Group A) and 12 were treated by external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer (70 Gy) and sphincter-saving resection (Group B) of whom five had a metachronous and seven a synchronous cancer. The end-points were surgical morbidity, pelvic sepsis, reoperation and definitive stoma.  Results:   Tumour characteristics were similar in both groups. Surgical morbidity (67% vs 25%, P = 0.004), anastomotic leakage (50% vs 10%, P = 0.001, and reoperation (50% vs 17%, P = 0.011) were significantly higher in Group B.

Methods:   Cases were 1933 men with incident prostate cancer diagnosed across Montreal French hospitals between 2005 and 2009. Population controls were 1994 men from the same age distribution and residential area. In-person interviews collected socio-demographic characteristics and medical history, e.g., BPH diagnosis, duration and treatment, as well as on PCa screening. Logistic regression analyses tested overall and grade-specific associations, including subgroup analyses with frequent PSA testing.  Results:   A BPH-history was associated with an increased risk of PCa (OR 1.37 [95 % CI 1.16-2.61]), more pronounced for low-grade PCa (Gleason â¤6: OR 1.54 [1.26-1.87]; Gleason â¥7: OR 1.05 [0.86-1.27]). The association was not significant when BPH-history diagnosis was more than 1 year prior to index date, except for low-grade PCa (OR 1.29 [1.05-1.60]). Exposure to 5Î± reductase inhibitors (5Î±-RI) resulted in a decreased risk of overall PCa (OR 0.62 [0.42-0.92]), particularly for intermediate- to high-grade PCa (Gleason â¤6: OR 0.70 [0.43-1.14]; Gleason â¥7: OR 0.43 [0.26-0.72]). Adjusting for PSA testing frequency or restricting analyses to frequently screened subjects did not affect these results.  Conclusion:   BPH-history was associated with an increased PCa risk, which disappeared, when BPH-history did not include BPH diagnosis within the previous year.

In this planning study, we investigate the feasibility of treating a portion of the prostate to full-dose external beam radiation with reduced dose to the opposite lobe, compared with full-dose radiation delivered to the entire gland using hypofractionated radiation. For 10 consecutive patients with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer, 2 hypofractionated, single-arc volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were designed. The first plan (standard hypofractionation regimen [STD]) included the entire prostate gland, treated to 70 Gy delivered in 28 fractions. The second dose painting plan (DP) encompassed the involved lobe treated to 70 Gy delivered in 28 fractions, whereas the opposing, uninvolved lobe received 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Mean dose to the opposing neurovascular bundle (NVB) was considerably lower for DP vs STD, with a mean dose of 53.9 vs 72.3 Gy (p < 0.001). Mean penile bulb dose was 18.6 Gy for DP vs 19.2 Gy for STD (p = 0.880). Mean rectal dose was 21.0 Gy for DP vs 22.8 Gy for STD (p = 0.356).

Methods:   Men having primary treatment for localized PCa were included from a multi-site regional veteran network. Recurrence was defined as nadir PSA +2 ng ml(-1) (radiation) or PSAâ©¾0.2 ng ml(-1) (prostatectomy). MetS was based on consensus professional society guidelines from the American Heart Association and International Diabetes Federation (three of: hypertension >130/85 mm Hg, fasting blood glucose â©¾100 mg dl(-1), waist circumference >102 cm, high-density lipoprotein <40 mg dl(-1), triglycerides â©¾150 mg dl(-1)). Closely related abnormality in low-density lipoprotein (LDL; >130 mg dl(-1)) was also examined. Analysis of PCa recurrence risk included multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with propensity adjustment.  Results:   Of the 1706 eligible men, 279 experienced recurrence over a median follow-up period of 41 months (range 1-120 months). Adjustment variables associated with PCa recurrence included: index PSA, Gleason, and tumor stage. Independent variables of interest associated with PCa recurrence were hyperglycemia and elevated LDL. Elevated LDL was associated with PCa recurrence (multivariable hazard ratio (HR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.74; propensity adjusted HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03, 1.72).

The method consisted of 2 components: (1) minimizing the logarithm of the total spot weight per energy layer; and (2) iteratively excluding low-weighted energy layers. The method was benchmarked by comparing a robust ""time-efficient plan"" (with energy layer reduction) with a robust ""standard clinical plan"" (without energy layer reduction) for 5 oropharyngeal cases and 5 prostate cases. Both plans of each patient had equal robust plan quality, because the worst-case dose parameters of the standard clinical plan were used as dose constraints for the time-efficient plan. Worst-case robust optimization was performed, accounting for setup errors of 3 mm and range errors of 3% + 1 mm. We evaluated the number of energy layers and the expected delivery time per fraction, assuming 30 seconds per beam direction, 10 ms per spot, and 400 Giga-protons per minute. The energy switching time was varied from 0.1 to 5 seconds.  Results:   The number of energy layers was on average reduced by 45% (range, 30%-56%) for the oropharyngeal cases and by 28% (range, 25%-32%) for the prostate cases. When assuming 1, 2, or 5 seconds energy switching time, the average delivery time was shortened from 3.9 to 3.0 minutes (25%), 6.0 to 4.2 minutes (32%), or 12.3 to 7.7 minutes (38%) for the oropharyngeal cases, and from 3.4 to 2.9 minutes (16%), 5.2 to 4.2 minutes (20%), or 10.6 to 8.0 minutes (24%) for the prostate cases.

Results:   Seventeen percent of all palliative RT courses were administered in the specified time frame (n = 100 patients, 30 Gy in 10 fractions in 49%). Common indications were bone and brain metastases, whereas metastatic spinal cord compression or other emergencies comprised a minority. Only 14% of patients had no distant metastases. Most patients had non-small cell lung cancer (51%), whereas other high-incidence primary tumors such as breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer combined comprised 10%. Failure to complete RT occurred in 6%. Median survival was 3.6 months. A startling high rate of RT in the last 30 days of life was observed (19%). Risk correlated significantly with performance status and extent of metastatic disease.  Conclusions:   The study population of patients who received early palliative RT is not identical to the general population described in previous studies, which covered the entire disease trajectory. Median survival was relatively short and rate of RT in the last 30 days of life higher than expected. Need for early palliative RT might be caused by large symptom burden and/or contraindication(s) for other management options, and might in many cases also be associated with adverse prognostic features and aggressive disease.""","""['Carsten Nieder', 'Ellinor Haukland', 'BÃ¥rd MannsÃ¥ker', 'Adam Pawinski', 'Astrid Dalhaug']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Palliative radiotherapy with or without additional care by a multidisciplinary palliative care team in patients with newly diagnosed cancer: a retrospective matched pairs comparison.', 'Utilization of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases near end of life in a population-based cohort.', 'Spinal bone metastases in colorectal cancer: a retrospective analysis of stability, prognostic factors and survival after palliative radiotherapy.', 'Palliative radiation therapy in the last 30 days of life: A systematic review.', 'Palliative radiation therapy for children with cancer.', 'Percent of remaining life on palliative radiation treatment: solely a function of fractionation?', 'Shortened Palliative Radiotherapy Results in a Lower Rate of Treatment During the Last Month of Life.', 'Symptom Burden in Patients With Reduced Performance Status at the Start of Palliative Radiotherapy.', 'Dose fall-off during the treatment of thoracic spine metastasis with CyberKnife stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).']"""

Specifically, the impact of exposed anatomic region and administered dose was investigated in breast and prostate cancer patients receiving partial-body radiotherapy. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were quantified by Î³-H2AX immunostaining. The frequency of unstable chromosomal aberrations in stimulated lymphocytes was also determined and compared with the frequency of DNA DSBs in the same samples. The frequency of radiation-induced DNA damage was converted into dose, using ex vivo generated calibration curves, and was then compared with the administered physical dose. This study showed that 0.5 h after partial-body radiotherapy the quantity of radiation-induced Î³-H2AX foci increased linearly with the administered equivalent whole-body dose for both tumor entities. Foci frequencies dropped 1 day thereafter but proportionality to the equivalent whole-body dose was maintained. Conversely, the frequency of radiation-induced cytogenetic damage increased from 0.5 h to 1 day after the first partial-body exposure with a linear dependence on the administered equivalent whole-body dose, for prostate cancer patients only. Only Î³-H2AX foci assessment immediately after partial-body radiotherapy was a reliable measure of the expected equivalent whole-body dose. Local tumor doses could be approximated with both assays after one day. After total-body radiotherapy satisfactory dose estimates were achieved with both assays up to 8 h after exposure. In conclusion, the quantification of radiation-induced Î³-H2AX foci, but not cytogenetic damage in peripheral leukocytes was a sensitive and rapid biodosimeter after acute heterogeneous irradiation of partial body volumes that was able to primarily assess the absorbed equivalent whole-body dose.""","""['Sebastian Zahnreich', 'Anne Ebersberger', 'Bernd Kaina', 'Heinz Schmidberger']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiat Res""","""['In vivo formation of gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 DNA repair foci in blood cells after radioiodine therapy of differentiated thyroid cancer.', 'Establishment and multiparametric-cytogenetic validation of 60Co-gamma-ray induced, phospho-gamma-H2AX calibration curve for rapid biodosimetry and triage management during radiological emergencies.', 'gamma-H2AX foci formation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of tumor patients after local radiotherapy to different sites of the body: dependence on the dose-distribution, irradiated site and time from start of treatment.', 'Use of Î³H2AX and other biomarkers of double-strand breaks during radiotherapy.', 'Usefulness and limits of biological dosimetry based on cytogenetic methods.', 'Non-linear dose response of DNA double strand breaks in response to chronic low dose radiation in individuals from high level natural radiation areas of Kerala coast.', 'Machine learning approach for quantitative biodosimetry of partial-body or total-body radiation exposures by combining radiation-responsive biomarkers.', 'Establishment of in vitro Calibration Curve for 60Co-Î³-rays Induced Phospho-53BP1 Foci, Rapid Biodosimetry and Initial Triage, and Comparative Evaluations With Î³H2AX and Cytogenetic Assays.', 'Transcriptional Dynamics of DNA Damage Responsive Genes in Circulating Leukocytes during Radiotherapy.', 'A deep learning model (FociRad) for automated detection of Î³-H2AX foci and radiation dose estimation.']"""

We sought to evaluate whether increasing availability of ART is associated with changing cancer incidence in Uganda.  Methods:   Incident cases of 10 malignancies were identified from Kampala Cancer Registry from 1999 to 2008. ART coverage rates for Uganda were abstracted from the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS reports. Negative binomial and Poisson regression modeled the association between ART coverage and age-adjusted cancer incidence.  Results:   ART coverage in Uganda increased from 0% to 43% from 1999 to 2008. With each 10% increase in ART coverage, incidence of Kaposi sarcoma decreased by 5% [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.95, 95% confidence interval: 0.91 to 0.99, P = 0.02] and stomach cancer decreased by 13% [IRR = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.80 to 0.95), P = 0.002]. Conversely, incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increased by 6% [IRR = 1.06 (95% CI: 1 to 1.12), P = 0.05], liver cancer by 12% [IRR = 1.12 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.21), P = 0.002], prostate cancer by 5% [IRR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1 to 1.10), P = 0.05], and breast cancer by 5% [IRR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1 to 1.11), P = 0.05]. ART coverage was not associated with incidence of invasive cervical cancer, lung, colon, and Hodgkin disease. These findings were similar when restricted to histologically confirmed cases.

The clinical usage of docetaxel has resulted in modest gains in survival, primarily due to the development of resistance. There are currently no clinical biomarkers available that predict whether a CRPC patient will respond or acquire resistance to this therapy. Comparative proteomics analysis of exosomes secreted from DU145 prostate cancer cells that are sensitive (DU145 Tax-Sen) or have acquired resistance (DU145 Tax-Res) to docetaxel, demonstrated significant differences in the amount of exosomes secreted and in their molecular composition. A panel of proteins was identified by proteomics to be differentially enriched in DU145 Tax-Res compared to DU145 Tax-Sen exosomes and was validated by western blotting. Importantly, we identified MDR-1, MDR-3, Endophilin-A2 and PABP4 that were enriched only in DU145 Tax-Res exosomes. We validated the presence of these proteins in the serum of a small cohort of patients. DU145 cells that have uptaken DU145 Tax-Res exosomes show properties of increased matrix degradation.

Target identification is solely based on information from mp-MRI, which is subsequently transferred to the subject coordinates through an image registration approach. mp-MRI has shown to be highly sensitive to detect higher-grade prostate cancer, but suffers from a high rate of false positives for lower-grade cancer, leading to unnecessary biopsies. This paper utilizes a machine-learning framework to further improve the sensitivity of targeted biopsy through analyzing temporal ultrasound data backscattered from the prostate tissue.  Methods:   Temporal ultrasound data were acquired during targeted fusion prostate biopsy from suspicious cancer foci identified in mp-MRI. Several spectral features, representing the signature of backscattered signal from the tissue, were extracted from the temporal ultrasound data. A supervised support vector machine classification model was trained to relate the features to the result of histopathology analysis of biopsy cores obtained from cancer foci. The model was used to predict the label of biopsy cores for mp-MRI-identified targets in an independent group of subjects.  Results:   Training of the classier was performed on data obtained from 35 biopsy cores. A fivefold cross-validation strategy was utilized to examine the consistency of the selected features from temporal ultrasound data, where we achieved the classification accuracy and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 94 % and 0.98, respectively. Subsequently, an independent group of 25 biopsy cores was used for validation of the model, in which mp-MRI had identified suspicious cancer foci. Using the trained model, we predicted the tissue pathology using temporal ultrasound data: 16 out of 17 benign cores, as well as all three higher-grade cancer cores, were correctly identified.  Conclusion:   The results show that temporal analysis of ultrasound data is potentially an effective approach to complement mp-MRI-TRUS-guided prostate cancer biopsy, specially to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and to reliably identify higher-grade cancers.""","""['Farhad Imani', 'Bo Zhuang', 'Amir Tahmasebi', 'Jin Tae Kwak', 'Sheng Xu', 'Harsh Agarwal', 'Shyam Bharat', 'Nishant Uniyal', 'Ismail Baris Turkbey', 'Peter Choyke', 'Peter Pinto', 'Bradford Wood', 'Mehdi Moradi', 'Parvin Mousavi', 'Purang Abolmaesumi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Detection of prostate cancer using temporal sequences of ultrasound data: a large clinical feasibility study.', 'Early experience with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsies under visual transrectal ultrasound guidance in patients suspicious for prostate cancer undergoing repeated biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'A Prospective Comparison of Selective Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion-Targeted and Systematic Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Biopsies for Detecting Prostate Cancer in Men Undergoing Repeated Biopsies.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.', 'Deep neural maps for unsupervised visualization of high-grade cancer in prostate biopsies.', 'Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Prostate Cancer Detection: Analysis of Temporal Enhanced Ultrasound.', 'Detection and grading of prostate cancer using temporal enhanced ultrasound: combining deep neural networks and tissue mimicking simulations.', 'Transfer learning from RF to B-mode temporal enhanced ultrasound features for prostate cancer detection.', 'Detection of prostate cancer using temporal sequences of ultrasound data: a large clinical feasibility study.']"""

However, little is known about the polymorphisms of TLR genes and the susceptibility to GC in Northern China, especially to Epstein-Barr virus-associated GC (EBVaGC). We focused on the association with susceptibility to GC, especially to EBVaGC.  Patients and methods:   Polymorphisms of the TLR2, 3, 4, and 9 genes were measured in 52 cases of EBVaGC and 157 cases of EBV-negative GC (EBVnGC). Ninety-four peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals were also examined.  Results:   For the TLR2 gene (196 to 174 del), there was no significant difference between the GC group and control group in genotype, but there was a significant difference in the del allele. As for the TLR3 gene (c. 1377C/T), there were significant differences between the GC group and the control group in both genotype and allelic frequency. No SNPs single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the TLR4 gene at the sites Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile. As for TLR9 1486T/C (rs187084) and C2848T (rs352140), there was also no association between the GC group and control.

Previous studies on the relation between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and prostate cancer (PCa) risk remained controversial. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, we carried out an update comprehensive meta-analysis to assess the associations of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism with the susceptibility of PCa. Twenty-three trials with a total of 24,024 participants on the MTHFR C677T polymorphism that met inclusion criteria were analyzed in the current study. Overall, no statistical relationship was found with any MTHFR C677T genetic model associated with susceptibility to PCa (TT versus CC, OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.68-1.02, P=0.07; CT versus CC, OR=0.95, 95% CI 0.85-1.07, P=0.43; Dominant, OR=0.93, 95% CI 0.83-1.03, P=0.17; Recessive, OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.70-1.02, P=0.09.). Nevertheless, subgroup analysis found a reduced PCa risk associated with polymorphism in Asian population (TT versus CC, CT versus CC, dominant and recessive model). Moreover, the protective effect of polymorphism against PCa risk was also shown upon hospital-based studies (TT versus CC, and recessive model). When benign prostate hyperplasia was chosen as controls, both TT versus CC and recessive model showed significant difference. In addition, the protective effect of homozygote TT against high aggressive PCa was proved to have significant difference. Taken together, the existing evidence indicates the homozygote TT of MTHFR C677T should be viewed as a protective factor against PCa risk for clinical practice with the consideration of different gene background, study design as well as specific controls.""","""['Shanqi Guo', 'Xingkang Jiang', 'Xiaobo Chen', 'Liang Chen', 'Xiaojiang Li', 'Yingjie Jia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Association between MTHFR gene polymorphisms (C677T, A1298C) and genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'The MTHFR C677T polymorphism and prostate cancer risk: new findings from a meta-analysis of 7306 cases and 8062 controls.', 'Association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and depression: An updated meta-analysis of 26 studies.', 'Association of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene C677T polymorphism with polycystic ovary syndrome risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis update.', 'Genetic polymorphism of MTHFR C677T with preterm birth and low birth weight susceptibility: a meta-analysis.', 'Association of MTHFR gene polymorphisms with pancreatic cancer: meta-analysis of 17 case-control studies.', 'Differential effects of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms (C677T and A1298C) on hematological malignancies among Latinos: a meta-analysis.', 'Epidemiology of Prostate Cancer.', 'Methyl Donor Micronutrients that Modify DNA Methylation and Cancer Outcome.', 'Folate and Its Impact on Cancer Risk.']"""

Existing published nomograms correlating clinical to pathologic extent of disease were based on patients treated in the 1980s and 1990s at select academic institutions. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to examine pathologic outcomes (Gleason score and cancer stage) in early prostate cancer patients based on biopsy Gleason score and PSA concentration.  Methods and materials:   This analysis included 25,858 patients whose cancer was diagnosed between 2010 and 2011, with biopsy Gleason scores of 6 to 7 and clinical stage T1 to T2 disease, who underwent radical prostatectomy. In subgroups based on biopsy Gleason score and PSA level, we report the proportion of patients with pathologically advanced disease (positive surgical margin or pT3-T4 disease) or whose Gleason score was upgraded. Logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with pathologic outcomes.  Results:   For patients with biopsy Gleason score 6 cancers, 84% of those with PSA <10 ng/mL had surgical T2 disease with negative margins; this decreased to 61% in patients with PSA of 20 to 29.9 ng/mL. Gleason score upgrading was seen in 43% (PSA: <10 ng/mL) to 61% (PSA: 20-29.9 ng/mL) of biopsy Gleason 6 patients. Patients with biopsy Gleason 7 cancers had a one-third (Gleason 3 + 4; PSA: <10 ng/mL) to two-thirds (Gleason 4 + 3; PSA: 20-29.9 ng/mL) probability of having pathologically advanced disease. Gleason score upgrading was seen in 11% to 19% of patients with biopsy Gleason 4 + 3 cancers. Multivariable analysis showed that higher PSA and older age were associated with Gleason score upgrading and pathologically advanced disease.  Conclusions:   This is the first population-based study to examine pathologic extent of disease and pathologic Gleason score upgrading based on clinically available information in modern patients. These data inform the selection of radiation therapy strategies and an understanding of whether prostatectomy alone is likely to be curative for patients with early prostate cancers.""","""['Joseph M Caster', 'Aaron D Falchook', 'Laura H Hendrix', 'Ronald C Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Clinical and pathologic predictors of Gleason sum upgrading in patients after radical prostatectomy: results from a single institution series.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Population based study of predictors of adverse pathology among candidates for active surveillance with Gleason 6 prostate cancer.', 'Enhancing the efficacy of radical prostatectomy in locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Combined modality staging of prostate carcinoma and its utility in predicting pathologic stage and postoperative prostate specific antigen failure.', 'Prognostic Impact and Clinical Implications of Unfavorable Upgrading in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Results of a Single Tertiary Referral Center.', 'Risk and predictors of adverse pathology after radical prostatectomy in patients diagnosed with IUSP 1-2 prostate cancer at MRI-targeted biopsy: a multicenter analysis.', 'A Molecular Docking Study of Human STEAP2 for the Discovery of New Potential Anti-Prostate Cancer Chemotherapeutic Candidates.', 'Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are lower in prostate tumor tissue and inversely related to proportion of West African ancestry.', 'Endogenous testosterone density as ratio of endogenous testosterone levels on prostate volume predicts tumor upgrading in low-risk prostate cancer.']"""

The most common primary diagnosis was prostate cancer (n = 28), followed by sarcoma (n = 9) and breast cancer (n = 6). The mean standardized uptake values (SUVs) were recorded for 18 organs in all patients, and maximum SUV and mean SUV were recorded for all the identified malignant lesions. We also estimated the (18)F(-)/(18)F-FDG uptake as the sum of (18)F-FDG uptake and adjusted (18)F-NaF uptake based on the ratio of (18)F-NaF injected dose in (18)F(-)/(18)F-FDG PET/CT.

However, measuring the radiation dose delivered by (90)Y is challenging because of the absence of suitable Î³ emissions and its low abundance of positron emissions. For the treatment of prostate cancer, radiolabeled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) antagonists have yielded promising results in mouse models. In this study, we evaluated whether Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) could be used to determine radiation doses of a (90)Y-labeled GRPr antagonist in nude mice.  Methods:   Mice bearing subcutaneous prostate cancer xenografts were injected with 0.74-18.5 MBq of the (90)Y-labeled GRPr antagonist DOTA-AR and underwent in vivo and ex vivo CLI at 1-48 h after injection. After imaging, animals were sacrificed, their tumors and organs were harvested, and the activity concentration was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In a second set of experiments, Cerenkov photon counts for tumor and kidney on in vivo CLI were converted to activity concentrations using conversion factors determined from the first set of experiments.  Results:   (90)Y-DOTA-AR concentration in the 3 tumor models ranged from 0.5% to 4.8% of the injected activity per gram at 1 h after injection and decreased to 0.05%-0.15 injected activity per gram by 48 h after injection. A positive correlation was found between tumor activity concentrations and in vivo CLI signal (r(2) = 0.94). A similar correlation was found for the renal activity concentration and in vivo Cerenkov luminescence (r(2) = 0.98). Other organs were not distinctly visualized on the in vivo images, but ex vivo CLI was also correlated with the radioactivity concentration (r(2) = 0.35-0.94). Using the time-activity curves from the second experiment, we calculated radiation doses to tumor and kidney of 0.33 Â± 0.12 (range, 0.21-0.66) and 0.06 Â± 0.01 (range, 0.05-0.08) Gy/MBq, respectively.

Here, we demonstrate whole-body quantitative SPECT imaging of preneoplastic breast cancer tissue using (111)In-labeled cCPE.

The affinity of radiolabeled cCPE.GST for claudin-4 was confirmed using claudin-4-expressing MDA-MB-468 and SQ20b cells, compared with claudin-4-negative HT1080 cells. In vivo SPECT imaging was performed using athymic mice bearing MDA-MB-468 or HT1080 xenografts and using genetically modified BALB/neuT mice, which spontaneously develop claudin-4-expressing breast cancer lesions.  Results:   The uptake of (111)In-cCPE.GST in claudin-4-positive MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors in athymic mice was significantly higher than in (111)In-GST or claudin-4-negative HT1080 tumors (6.72 Â± 0.18 vs. 3.88 Â± 1.00 vs. 2.36 Â± 1.25 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]; P < 0.0001).

Methods:   From the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry, cases of clinically localized prostate cancer diagnosed in 2004-2011 were identified and classified according to D'Amico criteria. Initial treatment modality was recorded as surgery, radiation therapy, expectant management, or hormone therapy. Temporal trends were assessed by Chi-square for trend.  Results:   Of 6,203 clinically localized prostate cancers meeting inclusion criteria, 34, 30, and 28% were low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease, respectively. For low-risk disease, use of expectant management (17-42%, p < 0.001) and surgery (29-39%, p < 0.001) increased, while use of radiation therapy decreased (49-19 %, p < 0.001). For intermediate-risk disease, use of surgery increased (24-50%, p < 0.001), while radiation decreased (58-34%, p < 0.001). Hormonal therapy alone was rarely used for low- and intermediate-risk disease. For high-risk patients, surgery increased (38-47%, p = 0.003) and radiation decreased (41-38%, p = 0.026), while hormonal therapy and expectant management remained stable.

To determine the mechanism, we overexpressed hyaluronidase 1 (Hyal1) as a fluorescent fusion protein and examined its impact on endocytosis and vesicular trafficking. Overexpression of Hyal1 led to increased rates of internalization of HA and the endocytic recycling marker transferrin. Live imaging of Hyal1, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and specific colocalization of Rab GTPases defined the subcellular distribution of Hyal1 as early and late endosomes, lysosomes, and recycling vesicles. Manipulation of vesicular trafficking by chemical inhibitors or with constitutively active and dominant negative Rab expression constructs caused atypical localization of Hyal1. Using the catalytically inactive point mutant Hyal1-E131Q, we found that enzymatic activity of Hyal1 was necessary for normal localization within the cell as Hyal1-E131Q was mainly detected within the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of a HA-binding point mutant, Hyal1-Y202F, revealed that secretion of Hyal1 and concurrent reuptake from the extracellular space are critical for rapid HA internalization and cell proliferation.

We tested whether a folic acid-enriched diet changed urinary tract physiology and biology in control male mice and male mice with urinary dysfunction induced by exogenous testosterone and estradiol (T+E2), which mimics changing hormone levels in aging humans. T+E2 treatment increased mouse urine output, time between voiding events, and bladder capacity and compliance. Consumption of a folic acid-enriched diet moderated these changes without decreasing prostate wet weight or threshold voiding pressure. One potential mechanism for these changes involves water balance. T+E2 treatment increases plasma concentrations of anti-diuretic hormone, which is offset at least in part by a folic acid-enriched diet. Another potential mechanism involves neural control of micturition. The folic acid-enriched diet, fed to T+E2-treated mice, increased voiding frequency in response to intravesicular capsaicin infusion and increased mRNA abundance of the capsaicin-sensitive cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (Trpv1) in L6 and S1 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. T+E2 treatment and a folic acid-enriched diet also modified DNA methylation, which is capable of altering gene expression. We found the enriched diet increased global DNA methylation in dorsal and ventral prostate and L6 and S1 DRG. Our results are consistent with folic acid acting to slow or reverse T+E2-mediated alteration in urinary function in part by normalizing water balance and enhancing or preserving afferent neuronal function.""","""['Kimberly P Keil', 'Lisa L Abler', 'Helene M Altmann', 'Zunyi Wang', 'Peiqing Wang', 'William A Ricke', 'Dale E Bjorling', 'Chad M Vezina']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Physiol Renal Physiol""","""['In Utero and Lactational TCDD Exposure Increases Susceptibility to Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction in Adulthood.', 'Impact of sex, androgens, and prostate size on C57BL/6J mouse urinary physiology: functional assessment.', 'Endocrine disruptor bisphenol A is implicated in urinary voiding dysfunction in male mice.', 'Is testosterone important in LUT function in men and women?

FGF19 is one of a subfamily of FGFs that circulate in serum and act in an endocrine manner. Our objective was to investigate its role in the progression of PCa.  Methods:   The effect of FGF19 on the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of LNCaP and PC3 cells was examined using MTT assay and Western blotting. Serum concentration of FGF19 was measured by ELISA in 209 patients with PCa, and the association between clinicopathological features and the presence of FGF19-positive cells in tissues derived from 155 patients who undergone radical prostatectomy was investigated.  Results:   Under androgen-deprived conditions achieved by incubation in medium with FGF19, the expression of N-cadherin in LNCaP cells was enhanced, that of E-cadherin and caspase 3 was suppressed, and the viability of LNCaP and PC3 cells was significantly enhanced. Significantly higher levels of PSA were recorded in the group determined by immunohistochemistry staining to be FGF19-positive (P = 0.0046). The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate after radical prostatectomy was 46.4% in the FGF19-positive group and 70.0% in the FGF19-negative group (P = 0.0027). In multivariate analysis, the presence of FGF19-positive tissues was an independent factor for worse prognosis after radical prostatectomy (P = 0.0052).

Though highly sensitive, the often-used prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test has low specificity which leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of PCa. This paper presents results of a retrospective study that indicates that testing for macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1) concentration along with the PSA assay could provide much improved specificity to the assay.  Methods:   The MIC-1 serum level was determined by a novel p-Chip-based immunoassay run on 70 retrospective samples. The assay was configured on p-Chips, small integrated circuits (IC) capable of storing in their electronic memories a serial number to identify the molecular probe immobilized on its surface. The distribution of MIC-1 and pre-determined PSA concentrations were displayed in a 2D plot and the predictive power of the dual MIC-1/PSA assay was analyzed.  Results:   MIC-1 concentration in serum was elevated in PCa patients (1.44 ng/ml) compared to normal and biopsy-negative individuals (0.93 ng/ml and 0.88 ng/ml, respectively). In addition, the MIC-1 level was correlated with the progression of PCa. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUC-ROC) was 0.81 providing an assay sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 60.7% by using a cutoff of 0.494 for the logistic regression value of MIC-1 and PSA. Another approach, by defining high-frequency PCa zones in a two-dimensional plot, resulted in assay sensitivity of 78.6% and specificity of 89.3%.  Conclusions:   The analysis based on correlation of MIC-1 and PSA concentrations in serum with the patient PCa status improved the specificity of PCa diagnosis without compromising the high sensitivity of the PSA test alone and has potential for PCa prognosis for patient therapy strategies.""","""['Ji Li', 'Robert W Veltri', 'Zhen Yuan', 'Christhunesa S Christudass', 'Wlodek Mandecki']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Measurement of serum levels of macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 combined with prostate-specific antigen improves prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Wisteria floribunda Agglutinin and Its Reactive-Glycan-Carrying Prostate-Specific Antigen as a Novel Diagnostic and Prognostic Marker of Prostate Cancer.', 'A novel algorithm for the prediction of prostate cancer in clinically suspected patients.', 'A multiparametric approach to improve upon existing prostate cancer screening and biopsy recommendations.', 'Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Circulating Cell-Free DNA Can Be Used as an Adjuvant Tool for Prostate Cancer Screening: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Increased Density of Growth Differentiation Factor-15+ Immunoreactive M1/M2 Macrophages in Prostate Cancer of Different Gleason Scores Compared with Benign Prostate Hyperplasia.', 'Pathophysiological role of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in obesity, cancer, and cachexia.', 'A Combined Analysis of Serum Growth Differentiation Factor-15 and Cancer Antigen 15-3 Enhances the Diagnostic Efficiency in Breast Cancer.', 'Clinical and Tumor Characteristics of Patients with High Serum Levels of Growth Differentiation Factor 15 in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Serum macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 as a clinical marker for non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

Although the new approach is superior, standard procedure is still useful in a cohort of patients in whom MRI is not available. The standard saturation biopsy technique is still debatable. We describe our technique and analyze its outcomes.  Materials and methods:   One hundred twenty-five patients underwent saturation biopsy through a single transperineal access. Mean age was 64.73 year, mean PSA was 9.49 ng/ml, mean PSA density was 0.184, and mean prostate volume was 57.95 g. All patients underwent at least one previous prostatic biopsy: 24.8% of cases had diagnosis of atypical small acinar proliferation, 39.2% of cases had multifocal high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and 36% of cases had inflammation or benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Results:   The detection rate was 38.4%. Prostate cancer occurred in 61.3% of patients with previous ASAP (p < 0.007).

Recently, CDK5 has been implicated in a number of different cancers, but how it is able to stimulate cancer-related signaling pathways remains enigmatic. Our goal was to study the cancer-promoting mechanisms of CDK5 in prostate cancer. We observed that CDK5 is necessary for proliferation of several prostate cancer cell lines. Correspondingly, there was considerable growth promotion when CDK5 was overexpressed. When examining the reasons for the altered proliferation effects, we observed that CDK5 phosphorylates S308 on the androgen receptor (AR), resulting in its stabilization and differential expression of AR target genes including several growth-priming transcription factors. However, the amplified cell growth was found to be separated from AR signaling, further corroborated by CDK5-dependent proliferation of AR null cells. Instead, we found that the key growth-promoting effect was due to specific CDK5-mediated AKT activation. Down-regulation of CDK5 repressed AKT phosphorylation by altering its intracellular localization, immediately followed by prominent cell cycle inhibition. Taken together, these results suggest that CDK5 acts as a crucial signaling hub in prostate cancer cells by controlling androgen responses through AR, maintaining and accelerating cell proliferation through AKT activation, and releasing cell cycle breaks.""","""['Julia Lindqvist', 'Susumu Y Imanishi', 'Elin Torvaldson', 'Marjo Malinen', 'Mika Remes', 'Fanny Ãrn', 'Jorma J Palvimo', 'John E Eriksson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Biol Cell""","""['Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 modulates STAT3 and androgen receptor activation through phosphorylation of Serâ·Â²â· on STAT3 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of androgen receptor and prostate cancer growth by cyclin-dependent kinase 5.', 'An AKT activity threshold regulates androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PSA expression in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Future Aspects of CDK5 in Prostate Cancer: From Pathogenesis to Therapeutic Implications.', 'Mechanisms of prostate cancer cell survival after inhibition of AR expression.', 'Mitotic phosphorylation of Tau/MAPT modulates cell cycle progression in prostate cancer cells.', 'The nutrient-responsive CDK Pho85 primes the Sch9 kinase for its activation by TORC1.', 'Cdk5 regulates IP3R1-mediated Ca2+ dynamics and Ca2+-mediated cell proliferation.', 'O-GlcNAc transferase regulates glioblastoma acetate metabolism via regulation of CDK5-dependent ACSS2 phosphorylation.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 promotes the growth of tongue squamous cell carcinoma through the microRNA 513c-5p/cell division cycle 25B pathway and is associated with a poor prognosis.']"""

In this study, inhibitors against NAMPT were designed using an energy-based pharmacophore strategy and evaluated for efficacy in cellular assays.

In men aged 55-69 years, the relative mortality reduction remained similar at 21%; the absolute reduction increased from 0.9 to 1.28 fewer deaths/1000 men screened.

As expected, overall mortality does not differ between the arms of the study.

Medical school affiliation and foreign training have been associated with persistent overuse. However, physician-level prescribing changes and the practice type of persistent overusers have not been examined. We sought to describe physician-level changes in GnRH agonist overuse and test the association of time in practice and solo practice type with GnRH agonist overuse.  Methods:   We matched American Medical Association physician data for 2138 urologists to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result-Medicare data for 12,943 men diagnosed with early-stage and lower-grade adenocarcinoma of the prostate between 2000 and 2007. We conducted a population-based, retrospective study using multilevel modeling to control for patient and provider characteristics.  Results:   Three distinct patterns of GnRH agonist overuse were observed. Urologists' time in practice was not associated with GnRH agonist overuse (odds ratio (OR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.75-1.05). However, solo practice type (OR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.34-2.02), medical school affiliation (OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.55-0.77) and patient race were.

Conclusions:   GnRH agonist overuse remains high among some urologists who may be professionally isolated and difficult to reach.

In this context, microRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators that play an important role in gene expression since they are frequently deregulated in pathologies like cardiovascular disease and cancer. In vitro validation of miRNA--targets regulation is often too expensive and time consuming to be carried out for every possible alternative. As a result, a tool able to provide some criteria to prioritize trials is becoming a pressing need. Moreover, before planning in vitro experiments, the scientist needs to evaluate the miRNA-target genes interaction network. In this paper we describe the miRable method whose purpose is to identify new potentially relevant genes and their interaction networks associate to a specific pathology. To achieve this goal miRable follows a system biology approach integrating together general-purpose medical knowledge (literature, Protein-Protein Interaction networks, prediction tools) and pathology specific data (gene expression data). A case study on Prostate Cancer has shown that miRable is able to: 1) find new potential miRNA-targets pairs, 2) highlight novel genes potentially involved in a disease but never or little studied before, 3) reconstruct all possible regulatory subnetworks starting from the literature to expand the knowledge on the regulation of miRNA regulatory mechanisms.""","""['Miriam Baglioni', 'Francesco Russo', 'Filippo Geraci', 'Milena Rizzo', 'Giuseppe Rainaldi', 'Marco Pellegrini']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Integrative identification of deregulated miRNA/TF-mediated gene regulatory loops and networks in prostate cancer.', 'Combing the Hairball: Improving Visualization of miRNA-Target Interaction Networks.', 'Predicting miRNA Targets by Integrating Gene Regulatory Knowledge with Expression Profiles.', 'Integrative computational mRNA-miRNA interaction analyses of the autoimmune-deregulated miRNAs and well-known Th17 differentiation regulators: An attempt to discover new potential miRNAs involved in Th17 differentiation.', 'Bioinformatic tools for microRNA dissection.', 'Circulating microRNA trafficking and regulation: computational principles and practice.', 'Dissecting the regulation rules of cancer-related miRNAs based on network analysis.']"""

We found that Aurora A was required to mediate mitosis-driven GR phosphorylation, but not recruitment of GR to the spindle. GR was necessary for mitotic progression, with increased time to complete mitosis, frequency of mitotic aberrations, and death in mitosis observed following GR knockdown. Complementation studies revealed an essential role for the GR ligand-binding domain, but no clear requirement for ligand binding in regulating chromosome segregation. The GR N-terminal domain, and specifically phosphosites S203 and S211, were not required. Reduced GR expression results in a cell cycle phenotype, with isolated cells from mouse and human subjects showing changes in chromosome content over prolonged passage. Furthermore, GR haploinsufficient mice have an increased incidence of tumor formation, and, strikingly, these tumors are further depleted for GR, implying additional GR loss as a consequence of cell transformation.

Cixutumumab was synergistic with castration in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer xenograft model.  Patients and methods:   Patients with new metastatic prostate cancer were randomly assigned within 30 days of initiating androgen deprivation (AD) to cixutumumab added to a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist with bicalutamide versus AD alone. With 180 patients and one-sided alpha of 0.10, there would be 90% power to detect an absolute 20% difference in undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA; â¤ 0.2 ng/mL) rate at 28 weeks (relative risk, 1.44); this end point was previously strongly correlated with survival. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients with PSA > 4.0 ng/mL, safety and tolerability, circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels, and seven plasma IGF-IR biomarkers. Fisher's exact test was used for the primary end point, and extended Mantel-Haenszel Ï(2) test was used for three PSA response categories.  Results:   The trial accrued 210 eligible patients (105 randomly assigned to each arm). Patient characteristics were similar in both arms. Undetectable PSA rate was 42 (40.0%) of 105 for cixutumumab plus AD and 34 (32.3%) of 105 for AD alone (relative risk, 1.24; one-sided P = .16). Lower baseline CTCs (0 v 1 to 4 v â¥ 5/7.5 mL whole blood) were associated with higher rate of PSA response (three categories; P = .036) in 39 evaluable patients. IGF-IR biomarkers were not correlated with PSA outcome, and cixutumumab did not significantly change these biomarker levels.

As a consequence resources are wasted that could be useful elsewhere. In Avril 2014 prescription-forms were introduced in our hospital for PSA and for vitamin-D. If those forms were not filled-in by the physicians, then PSA and vitamin-D were not measured any more by our laboratory. PSA was measured in only two circumstances: therapeutic follow-up of, or screening for, prostate cancer. Patients had to give their formal consent for being screened with PSA. Vitamin-D was measured in the only six circumstances recommended by the HAS. After a few months of use of these two forms we observe a sharp decrease in PSA, and even more so in vitamin D, measurements. Our prescription-forms' legitimacy is high because they are based on governmental guidelines. All the more since the values that are promoted in these guidelines clearly cover the four core principles of bioethics, that is beneficence, non-malevolence, respect for the patient's autonomy (particularly for PSA) and equity.

Patients and methods:   Serum isolated from 250 men from three tertiary referral centres with pre-biopsy blood draws was analysed for total prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free PSA (fPSA) and p2PSA. From this, the Prostate Health Index (PHI) score was calculated (PHI = (p2PSA/fPSA)*âtPSA). The men's clinical information was used to derive their risk according to the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk model. Two clinical prediction models were created via multivariable regression consisting of age, family history, abnormality on digital rectal examination, previous negative biopsy and either PSA or PHI score, respectively. Calibration plots, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curves were generated to assess the performance of the three models.  Results:   The PSA model and PHI model were both well calibrated in this cohort, with the PHI model showing the best correlation between predicted probabilities and actual outcome. The areas under the ROC curve for the PHI model, PSA model and PCPT model were 0.77, 0.71 and 0.69, respectively, for the prediction of prostate cancer (PCa) and 0.79, 0.72 and 0.72, respectively, for the prediction of high grade PCa. Decision-curve analysis showed a superior net benefit of the PHI model over both the PSA model and the PCPT risk model in the diagnosis of PCa and high grade PCa over the entire range of risk probabilities.  Conclusion:   A logical and standardized approach to the use of clinical risk factors can allow more accurate risk stratification of men under investigation for PCa. The measurement of p2PSA and the integration of this biomarker into a clinical prediction model can further increase the accuracy of risk stratification, helping to better inform the decision for prostate biopsy in a referral population.""","""['Robert W Foley', 'Laura Gorman', 'Neda Sharifi', 'Keefe Murphy', 'Helen Moore', 'Alexandra V Tuzova', 'Antoinette S Perry', 'T Brendan Murphy', 'Dara J Lundon', 'R William G Watson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prostate biopsy decisions: one-size-fits-all approach with total PSA is out and a multivariable approach with the Prostate Health Index is in.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Clinical performance of serum prostate-specific antigen isoform -2proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives, %p2PSA and the prostate health index (PHI), in men with a family history of prostate cancer: results from a multicentre European study, the PROMEtheuS project.', 'The percentage of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform -2proPSA and the Prostate Health Index improve the diagnostic accuracy for clinically relevant prostate cancer at initial and repeat biopsy compared with total PSA and percentage free PSA in men aged â¤65 years.', 'Clinical performance of serum -2proPSA derivatives, %p2PSA and PHI, in the detection and management of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical use of -2proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives (%p2PSA and Prostate Health Index) for the detection of prostate cancer: a review of the literature.', 'Development of a novel nomogram for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer with the prostate health index and multiparametric MRI.', 'Molecular Biomarkers for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Serum multi-cytokines screening identifies TRAIL and IL-10 as probable new biomarkers for prostate health index diagnostic utility adjustment in grey zone aggressive prostate cancer detection: A single-center data in China.', 'Biomarkers for prostate cancer detection and risk stratification.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Predictive Models in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Post-treatment erectile function (EF) preservation is strongly dependent on the baseline EF prior to treatment.  Aim:   To assess the baseline EF among patients with localized prostate cancer, and the factors associated with baseline EF.  Methods:   All men with clinically localized prostate cancer had their baseline EF assessed prior to brachytherapy at our institution. Six hundred ninety-nine men who completed the International Index of Erectile Function five-item questionnaires pre-treatment between 2001 and 2013 were included in the study. Data on patient factors (medical comorbidities and smoking history) and prostate cancer clinicopathological characteristics were recorded. Ordinal logistic regressions were used to estimate the effects of each variable on the severity of ED.  Main outcome measures:   Baseline EF among men with localized prostate cancer, and factors associated with ED.  Results:   Prior to permanent seed brachytherapy, 335 (48%) patients reported no ED, 129 (17%) mild ED, 42 (6%) mild-moderate ED, 37 (5%) moderate ED, and 165 (24%) severe ED. In multivariate analyses, age, diabetes, and hypertension remained to be independently associated with ED, with diabetes most strongly associated with worse ED (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.3-5.3).  Conclusions:   ED is common among patients with localized prostate cancer prior to any curative treatment. Assessment of baseline ED is important prior to curative treatment of prostate cancer in order to offer appropriate advise on likelihood of EF preservation post-treatment and avoid patient dissatisfaction with treatment outcomes due to unrealistic expectations.""","""['Wee Loon Ong', 'Hamish McLachlan', 'Jeremy L Millar']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['The effect on erectile function of 103palladium implantation for localized prostate cancer.', 'Long-term erectile function following permanent seed brachytherapy treatment for localized prostate cancer.', 'Recovery of Baseline Erectile Function in Men Following Radical Prostatectomy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Analysis Using Validated Measures.', 'The Natural History of Erectile Dysfunction After Prostatic Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The concept of erectile function preservation (penile rehabilitation) in the patient after brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Prevalence of erectile dysfunction in male survivors of cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies.', 'Erectile dysfunction and the risk of prostate cancer.']"""

Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source solution to support MRI-TRUS fusion image guidance of prostate interventions, such as targeted biopsy for prostate cancer detection and focal therapy. It is widely hypothesized that image registration is an essential component in such systems.  Methods:   The two non-rigid registration methods are: (1) a deformable registration of the prostate segmentation distance maps with B-spline regularization and (2) a finite element-based deformable registration of the segmentation surfaces in the presence of partial data. We evaluate the methods retrospectively using clinical patient image data collected during standard clinical procedures. Computation time and Target Registration Error (TRE) calculated at the expert-identified anatomical landmarks were used as quantitative measures for the evaluation.  Results:   The presented image registration tools were capable of completing deformable registration computation within 5 min. Average TRE was approximately 3 mm for both methods, which is comparable with the slice thickness in our MRI data. Both tools are available under nonrestrictive open-source license.  Conclusions:   We release open-source tools that may be used for registration during MRI-TRUS-guided prostate interventions. Our tools implement novel registration approaches and produce acceptable registration results.

Sexual and urinary functions were not assessed in this analysis. Subgroups according to age at diagnosis (â¤60,>60 toâ¤70, and>70y) and comorbidities (Charlson scoresâ¤2 and â¥3) were defined. Subgroups were compared using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, whereas changes in a group over time were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Results:   In all patient groups, no change was found 12 months after surgery compared with preoperative values in global health as well as functioning (role, physical, cognitive, and social). Emotional functioning improved significantly after surgery compared with preoperative functioning. Older patients (>70y) had better emotional and social functioning compared with younger patients (â¤60y). The other scores were comparable between older and younger patients. Global health and physical, role, cognitive, and social functioning were independent of the number of comorbidities, although patients with a Charlson scoreâ¥3 did worse regarding fatigue and dyspnoe.  Conclusion:   The QoL of older patients or patients with multiple comorbidities is not negatively influenced by radical prostatectomy. This should be considered when discussing the indication for prostatectomy in older or comorbid patients.""","""['Kathleen Herkommer', 'Sebastian C Schmid', 'Helga Schulwitz', 'Andreas Dinkel', 'Tobiasz Klorek', 'Christian Hofer', 'Dennis Ehrl', 'Rainer Blaser', 'JÃ¼rgen E Gschwend', 'Martina Kron']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Impact on quality of life of radical prostatectomy after initial active surveillance: more to lose?', 'Impact of comorbidity on health-related quality of life in men undergoing radical prostatectomy: data from CaPSURE.', 'Age and baseline quality of life at radical prostatectomy--who has the most to lose?', 'Preoperative assessment of patient candidate to prostate cancer surgery.', 'Presurgical assessments.', 'EORTC QLQ-C30 general population normative data for Italy by sex, age and health condition: an analysis of 1,036 individuals.', 'Treatment of localized prostate cancer in elderly patients.']"""

Methods and materials:   Daily on-board imaging was used to collect large datasets of displacements for patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy for solid tumors. Bayesian statistical modeling of these geometric uncertainties was used to optimally trade off between displacement data collected from previously treated patients and the progressively accumulating data from a patient currently partway through treatment, to optimally predict future displacements for that patient. These predictions were used to update the PTV position and margin width for the remainder of treatment, such that the clinical target volume (CTV) was more precisely targeted.  Results:   Software simulation of dose to CTV and normal tissue for 2 real prostate displacement datasets consisting of 146 and 290 patients treated with a minimum of 30 fractions each showed that re-evaluating the PTV position and margin width after 8 treatment fractions reduced healthy tissue dose by 19% and 17%, respectively, while maintaining CTV dose.  Conclusion:   Incorporating patient-specific displacement patterns from early in a course of treatment allows PTV adaptation for the remainder of treatment. This substantially reduces the dose to healthy tissues and thus can reduce radiation therapy-induced toxicities, improving patient outcomes.""","""['Alan Herschtal', 'Luc Te Marvelde', 'Kerrie Mengersen', 'Farshad Foroudi', 'Thomas Eade', 'Daniel Pham', 'Hannah Caine', 'Tomas Kron']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Statistical modeling of CTV motion and deformation for IMRT of early-stage rectal cancer.', 'Optimized planning target volume for intact cervical cancer.', 'Quantitative evaluation of the benefit of fiducial image-guidance for prostate cancer intensity modulated radiation therapy using daily dose volume histogram analysis.', 'Planning target volume : Management of uncertainties, immobilization, image guided and adaptive radiation therapy.', 'The normal tissue effects of microbeam radiotherapy: What do we know, and what do we need to know to plan a human clinical trial?', 'Margins Matter: current radiation therapy practice and future directions.']"""

Methods and materials:   A total of 219 IMRT patients from the high-dose arm (79.2 Gy) of RTOG 0126 were analyzed. To quantify plan quality, we used established knowledge-based methods for patient-specific dose-volume histogram (DVH) prediction of organs at risk and a Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) model for grade â¥2 rectal complications to convert DVHs into normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs). The LKB model was validated by fitting dose-response parameters relative to observed toxicities. The 90th percentile (22 of 219) of plans with the lowest excess risk (difference between clinical and model-predicted NTCP) were used to create a model for the presumed best practices in the protocol (pDVH0126,top10%). Applying the resultant model to the entire sample enabled comparisons between DVHs that patients could have received to DVHs they actually received. Excess risk quantified the clinical impact of suboptimal planning. Accuracy of pDVH predictions was validated by replanning 30 of 219 patients (13.7%), including equal numbers of presumed ""high-quality,"" ""low-quality,"" and randomly sampled plans. NTCP-predicted toxicities were compared to adverse events on protocol.  Results:   Existing models showed that bladder-sparing variations were less prevalent than rectum quality variations and that increased rectal sparing was not correlated with target metrics (dose received by 98% and 2% of the PTV, respectively). Observed toxicities were consistent with current LKB parameters. Converting DVH and pDVH0126,top10% to rectal NTCPs, we observed 94 of 219 patients (42.9%) with â¥5% excess risk, 20 of 219 patients (9.1%) with â¥10% excess risk, and 2 of 219 patients (0.9%) with â¥15% excess risk. Replanning demonstrated the predicted NTCP reductions while maintaining the volume of the PTV receiving prescription dose. An equivalent sample of high-quality plans showed fewer toxicities than low-quality plans, 6 of 73 versus 10 of 73 respectively, although these differences were not significant (P=.21) due to insufficient statistical power in this retrospective study.

However, the global profiling of miRNA expression in prostate cancer cells following treatment with AR ligands has not been reported so far. In this study we examined the effect of treatment with two AR agonists (mibolerone (MIB) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) and an AR antagonist (bicalutamide (BIC)) on miRNA expression in the human androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell line using microarray technology and verification of selected miRNA using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). No miRNA was identified as differentially expressed following treatment with the AR antagonist BIC. In contrast, a number of common and compound-specific alterations in miRNA expression were observed following treatment with AR agonists. Unexpectedly it was found that treatment with the AR agonists resulted in the repression of miR-221, a miRNA previously established to be involved with prostate cancer development. This observation indicates that this miRNA may have a more complex role in prostate cancer development than considered previously. Treatment with MIB led to an induction of miR-210 expression, a hypoxia-related miRNA. This miRNA is reported to be involved in cell adaptation to hypoxia and thus induction in conditions of normoxia may be important in driving metabolic changes observed in prostate cancer. Thus examining the effect of AR agonists and antagonists on miRNA expression can provide novel insights into the response of cells to AR ligands and subsequent downstream events.""","""['Corrinne V Segal', 'Costas Koufaris', 'Chris Powell', 'Nigel J Gooderham']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Toxicology""","""['Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Switch from antagonist to agonist of the androgen receptor bicalutamide is associated with prostate tumour progression in a new model system.', 'Androgens up-regulate the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Endocrine Disruptors and Prostate Cancer.', 'miRNA as Regulators of Prostate Carcinogenesis and Endocrine and Chemoresistance.', 'Tumour Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-Î±)-Induced Metastatic Phenotype in Colorectal Cancer Epithelial Cells: Mechanistic Support for the Role of MicroRNA-21.', 'miR-221/222 as biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention on cancer and other diseases: A systematic review.', 'MicroRNAs: The Link between the Metabolic Syndrome and Oncogenesis.', 'Non-Coding RNAs and SARS-Related Coronaviruses.', 'microRNAs as new possible actors in gender disparities of Covid-19 pandemic.']"""

Materials and methods:   We reviewed our urethroplasty database for patients with a radiotherapy history who underwent buccal mucosa graft urethroplasty between January 2009 and October 2013. We reviewed patient charts and the institutional, standardized, nonvalidated questionnaires administered to each patient postoperatively. Study end points included 1) the success rate, 2) continence status, 3) erectile function and 4) patient satisfaction postoperatively. Success was defined as stricture-free survival.  Results:   Of 38 men included in the study prostate cancer was the most common indication for radiotherapy in 35 (92.1%). External beam radiotherapy was performed in 24 cases (64.9%), brachytherapy was done in 8 (21.6%) and a combination of the 2 treatments was performed in 6 (13.5%). Strictures were in the bulbar/bulbomembranous urethra and had a median length of 3.0 cm (range 1.0 to 8.0). The overall success rate was 71.1% at a median followup of 26.5 months (range 1.0 to 50.0). Median time to stricture recurrence was 17.0 months (range 3.0 to 44.0). De novo urinary incontinence was observed in 4 patients (10.5%). Erectile function remained mostly unchanged compared to preoperative status. Study limitations include the small sample size and the lack of validated questionnaires.  Conclusions:   At short-term to mid-term followup the success rate of ventral onlay buccal mucosa graft urethroplasty in patients with radiotherapy history seems acceptable.

Men who present HGPIN in a first prostate biopsy face years of active surveillance including repeat biopsies. This study aimed to identify non-invasive prognostic biomarkers that differentiate early on between indolent HGPIN cases and those that will transform into actual PCa.  Methods:   We measured the expression of 21 candidate mRNA biomarkers using quantitative PCR in urine sediment samples from a cohort of 90 patients with initial diagnosis of HGPIN and a posterior follow up of at least two years. Uni- and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to analyze the candidate biomarkers and multiplex models using combinations of these biomarkers.  Results:   PSMA, PCA3, PSGR, GOLM, KLK3, CDH1, and SPINK1 behaved as predictors for PCa presence in repeat biopsies. Multiplex models outperformed (AUC = 0.81-0.86) the predictive power of single genes, including the FDA-approved PCA3 (AUC = 0.70). With a fixed sensitivity of 95%, the specificity of our multiplex models was of 41-58%, compared to the 30% of PCA3. The PPV of our models (30-38%) was also higher than the PPV of PCA3 (27%), suggesting that benign cases could be more accurately identified. Applying statistical models, we estimated that 33% to 47% of repeat biopsies could be prevented with a multiplex PCR model, representing an easy applicable and significant advantage over the current gold standard in urine sediment.

We hypothesized that additional DNA damage regulating miRNAs could be identified by screening a library of 810 miRNA mimetics for the ability to alter cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). A prostate cancer Metridia luciferase cell model was applied to examine the effects of individual miRNAs on IR sensitivity. A large percentage of miRNA mimetics were found to increase cellular sensitivity to IR, while a smaller percentage were protective. Two of the most potent IR sensitizing miRNAs, miR-890 and miR-744-3p, significantly delayed IR induced DNA damage repair. Both miRNAs inhibited the expression of multiple components of DNA damage response and DNA repair. miR-890 directly targeted MAD2L2, as well as WEE1 and XPC, where miR-744-3p directly targeted RAD23B. Knock-down of individual miR-890 targets by siRNA was not sufficient to ablate miR-890 radiosensitization, signifying that miR-890 functions by regulating multiple DNA repair genes. Intratumoral delivery of miR-890 mimetics prior to IR therapy significantly enhanced IR therapeutic efficacy.

Methods:   The authors investigated patients with de novo and secondary APL who were included in the ongoing APL-2006 trial. Patients with secondary APL who were included in that trial also were compared with a previous retrospective cohort of patients with secondary APL.  Results:   In the APL-2006 trial, 42 of 280 patients (15%) had secondary APL. Compared with the retrospective cohort, patients with secondary APL in the APL-2006 trial had a lower incidence of prior breast carcinoma (35.7% vs 57%; P = .03) and a higher incidence of prior prostate carcinoma (26.2% vs 4.7%; P < .001). Treatment of the primary tumor in the APL-2006 trial less frequently included combined radiochemotherapy (28.6% vs 47.2%; P = .044) and no mitoxantrone (0% vs 46.7%; P = .016) but more frequently included anthracyclines (53.3% vs 38.3%; P = .015). In the APL-2006 trial, patients who had secondary APL, compared with those who had de novo APL, were older (mean, 60.2 years vs 48.7 years, respectively; P < .0001) but had a similar complete response rate (97.6% vs 90.3%, respectively), cumulative incidence of relapse (0% vs 1.8%, respectively), and overall survival (92.3% vs 90.9%, respectively) at 18 months.  Conclusions:   Although the incidence of secondary APL appears to be stable over time, evolving strategies for the treatment of primary cancers have reduced its occurrence among breast cancer patients but have increased its incidence among patients with prostate cancer.

Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes are important to consider, yet few studies have examined HRQoL among patients with PCa who were managed with AS. In this study, the authors compared longitudinal HRQoL in a prospective, racially diverse, and contemporary cohort of patients who underwent RP or AS for low-risk PCa.  Methods:   Beginning in 2007, HRQoL data from validated questionnaires (the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and the 36-item RAND Medical Outcomes Study short-form survey) were collected by the Center for Prostate Disease Research in a multicenter national database. Patients aged â¤75 years who were diagnosed with low-risk PCa and elected RP or AS for initial disease management were followed for 3 years. Mean scores were estimated using generalized estimating equations adjusting for baseline HRQoL, demographic characteristics, and clinical patient characteristics.  Results:   Of the patients with low-risk PCa, 228 underwent RP, and 77 underwent AS. Multivariable analysis revealed that patients in the RP group had significantly worse sexual function, sexual bother, and urinary function at all time points compared with patients in the AS group. Differences in mental health between groups were below the threshold for clinical significance at 1 year.  Conclusions:   In this study, no differences in mental health outcomes were observed, but urinary and sexual HRQoL were worse for patients who underwent RP compared with those who underwent AS for up to 3 years.

Previous studies have reported that sesamin induces growth inhibition in human cancer cells, particularly prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we mainly explored the mechanism underlying the protective effect of sesamin on prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that the proliferation of PC3 cells, as determined using the MTT assay, and the expression of cyclin D1, COX-2, Bcl-2 and survivin proteins elevated by LPS were distinctly inhibited by sesamin in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the ability of PC3 cell invasion, as determined using the Transwell assay and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins increased by LPS were obviously reduced by sesamin in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the accumulation of TGF-Î± and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production induced by LPS in the culture supernatant was found to be decreased dose-dependently with sesamin pretreatment in PC3 cells using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the p38 protein and nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB activity in the PC3 cells were enhanced by LPS and further inhibited with sesamin, SB203580 pretreatment or p38-siRNA transfection, respectively. Sesamin or SB203580 pretreatment obviously inhibited PC3 cells-derived tumor growth induced by LPS in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that the potential ability of sesamin to downregulate the secretion of cytokines and the expression of cell proliferative- and invasive-related gene products induced by LPS was shown to be via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways, which may be one of the mechanisms of the anticancer activity of this sesamin agent in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Peiyuan Xu', 'Fei Cai', 'Xiaofei Liu', 'Lele Guo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Sesamin inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production by suppression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB.', 'Sesamin inhibits macrophage-induced vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression and proangiogenic activity in breast cancer cells.', 'Doxycycline down-regulates matrix metalloproteinase expression and inhibits NF-ÎºB signaling in LPS-induced PC3 cells.', 'A comprehensive review on the anti-cancer properties and mechanisms of action of sesamin, a lignan in sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum).', 'A comprehensive mechanistic insight into the dietary and estrogenic lignans, arctigenin and sesamin as potential anticarcinogenic and anticancer agents.

Patients and methods:   We studied 18 225 men diagnosed with prostate cancer after another malignancy from 1973 to 2006. We compared demographic and clinical variables, and the proportion of death from prostate cancer vs prior malignancy with t-test and chi-squared analyses. Fine and Gray's regression was used to consider the effect of treatment on prostate cancer death. We then studied a second cohort of 88 013 men with prostate cancer as a first or second malignancy to describe current diagnostic and treatment patterns.  Results:   One in seven men died from prostate cancer in our first cohort. More died from prostate cancer following colorectal cancer (16.8% vs 13.7%), melanoma (13.4% vs 7.56%), and oral cancer (19.1% vs 4.04%), but fewer following bladder cancer, kidney cancer, lung cancer, leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (all P < 0.001). Prostate cancer treatment was associated with a nearly 50% lower risk of death when high-grade or high-stage (adjusted hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.64). Patients who died from prostate cancer had higher grade and stage disease, and received less treatment than patients who died from prior malignancy. The second cohort showed subsequent prostate cancer had more high-risk disease (36.3% vs 22.2%, P < 0.001) and less prostate cancer treatment (adjusted odds ratio 0.872, 95% CI 0.818-0.930) than primary prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   This study included 21 patients who underwent CHOL-PET and T2W/DW MRI prior to radical prostatectomy. Two observers manually delineated IPL contours for each scan, and automatic IPL contours were generated on CHOL-PET based on varying proportions of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV). IPLs identified on prostatectomy specimens defined reference standard contours. The imaging-based contours were compared with the reference standard contours using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and sensitivity and specificity values. Factors that could potentially predict the DSC of the best contouring method were analyzed using linear models.  Results:   The best automatic contouring method, 60% of the maximum SUV (SUV60) , had similar correlations (DSC: 0.59) with the manual PET contours (DSC: 0.52, P=.127) and significantly better correlations than the manual MRI contours (DSC: 0.37, P<.001). The sensitivity and specificity values were 72% and 71% for SUV60; 53% and 86% for PET manual contouring; and 28% and 92% for MRI manual contouring. The tumor volume and transition zone pattern could independently predict the accuracy of CHOL-PET.  Conclusions:   CHOL-PET is superior to the combination of T2W/DW MRI for delineating IPLs. The accuracy of CHOL-PET is insufficient for gland-sparing focal therapies but may be accurate enough for focal boost therapies.

The UPR is activated by various physiological conditions as well as in disease states, such as cancer. As androgens regulate secretion and development of the normal prostate and drive prostate cancer (PCa) growth, they may affect UPR pathways. Here, we show that the canonical UPR pathways are directly and divergently regulated by androgens in PCa cells, through the androgen receptor (AR), which is critical for PCa survival. AR bound to gene regulatory sites and activated the IRE1Î± branch, but simultaneously inhibited PERK signaling. Inhibition of the IRE1Î± arm profoundly reduced PCa cell growth in vitro as well as tumor formation in preclinical models of PCa in vivo. Consistently, AR and UPR gene expression were correlated in human PCa, and spliced XBP-1 expression was significantly upregulated in cancer compared with normal prostate. These data establish a genetic switch orchestrated by AR that divergently regulates the UPR pathways and suggest that targeting IRE1Î± signaling may have therapeutic utility in PCa.""","""['Xia Sheng', 'Yke Jildouw Arnoldussen', 'Margrethe Storm', 'Martina Tesikova', 'Hatice Zeynep Nenseth', 'Sen Zhao', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Paul Rennie', 'BjÃ¸rn Risberg', 'HÃ¥kon WÃ¦hre', 'HÃ¥vard Danielsen', 'Ian G Mills', 'Yang Jin', 'GÃ¶khan Hotamisligil', 'Fahri Saatcioglu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""EMBO Mol Med""","""['Androgen modulation of XBP1 is functionally driving part of the AR transcriptional program.', 'Heat stress promotes the down-regulation of IRE1Î± in cells: An atypical modulation of the UPR pathway.', 'Riluzole induces AR degradation via endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen-regulated metabolism and biosynthesis in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Ultrastructural analysis of prostate cancer tissue provides insights into androgen-dependent adaptations to membrane contact site establishment.', 'A novel IRE1 kinase inhibitor for adjuvant glioblastoma treatment.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Loss of ATF6Î± in a human carcinoma cell line is compensated not by its paralogue ATF6Î² but by sustained activation of the IRE1 and PERK arms for tumor growth in nude mice.', 'Estrogens drive the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and promote proto-oncogene c-Myc expression in prostate cancer cells\xa0by androgen receptor/estrogen receptor signaling.']"""

Purpose:   To evaluate the completeness, comparability and diagnostic validity of Nigeria's cancer registries.  Methods:   Completeness was measured using children's age-specific incidence (ASI) and an established metric based on a modified Poisson distribution with regional comparisons. We used a registry questionnaire as well as percentages of death-certificate-only cases, morphologically verified cases, and case registration errors to examine comparability and diagnostic validity.  Results:   Among the children's results, we found that over half of all cancers were non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There was also evidence of incompleteness. Considering the regional completeness comparisons, we found potential evidence of cancer-specific general incompleteness as well as what appears to be incompleteness due to inability to diagnose specific cancers. We found that registration was generally comparable, with some exceptions. Since autopsies are not common across Nigeria, coding for both them and death-certificate-only cases was also rare. With one exception, registries in our study had high rates of morphological verification of female breast, cervical and prostate cancers.

Methods:   Sixty-three consecutive patients underwent pressure-flow studies, urethral pressure profiles, and abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP) tests 1-2 days before, immediately after, and 1 year after RARP.  Results:   The mean bladder compliance was 28.3 mL/cm HâO before RARP; it worsened to 16.3 mL/cm HâO immediately after RARP and recovered to 27.1 mL/cm HâO at 1 year. The mean detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate was 61.9 cm HâO before RARP; it decreased to 34.3 cm HâO immediately after RARP and remained at 35.6 cm HâO at 1 year.

Different electrokinetic forces were induced by the application of different electric signals to the circular microelectrodes. Local microfluidic vortexes were generated to increase the collision efficiency between the target DNA suspending in solution and probe DNA immobilized on the electrode surface. DNA hybridization on the electrode surface could be accelerated by the electrokinetic forces. The level of hybridization was represented by the fluorescent signal intensity ratio. Results revealed that such 5-min dynamic hybridization increased 4.5 fold of signal intensity ratio as compared to a 1-h static hybridization. Moreover, dynamic hybridization was found to have better differentiation ability between specific and non-specific target DNA.

Retrospective studies using cryopreserved serum suggest that four kallikrein markers can predict biopsy outcome.  Methods:   Free, intact and total PSA, and kallikrein-related peptidase 2 were measured in cryopreserved blood from 6129 men with elevated PSA (â¥3.0ng/mL) participating in the prospective, randomized trial Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment. Marker levels from 4765 men providing anticoagulated plasma were incorporated into statistical models to predict any-grade and high-grade (Gleason score â¥7) prostate cancer at 10-core biopsy. The models were corrected for optimism by 10-fold cross validation and independently validated using markers measured in serum from 1364 men. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   The four kallikreins enhanced prostate cancer detection compared with PSA and age alone. Area under the curve (AUC) for the four kallikreins was 0.719 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.704 to 0.734) vs 0.634 (95% CI = 0.617 to 0.651, P < .001) for PSA and age alone for any-grade cancer, and 0.820 (95% CI = 0.802 to 0.838) vs 0.738 (95% CI = 0.716 to 0.761) for high-grade cancer. Using a 6% risk of high-grade cancer as an illustrative cutoff, for 1000 biopsied men with PSA levels of 3.0ng/mL or higher, the model would reduce the need for biopsy in 428 men, detect 119 high-grade cancers, and delay diagnosis of 14 of 133 high-grade cancers. Models exhibited excellent discrimination on independent validation among men with only serum samples available for analysis.

Isolation of 'most-active fraction' or single constituents from whole extracts may not only compromise the therapeutic efficacy but also render toxicity, thus emphasizing the importance of preserving the natural composition of whole extracts. The leaves of Annona muricata, commonly known as Graviola, are known to be rich in flavonoids, isoquinoline alkaloids and annonaceous acetogenins. Here, we demonstrate phytochemical synergy among the constituents of Graviola leaf extract (GLE) compared to its flavonoid-enriched (FEF) and acetogenin-enriched (AEF) fractions. Comparative quantitation of flavonoids revealed enrichment of rutin (~7-fold) and quercetin-3-glucoside (Q-3-G, ~3-fold) in FEF compared to GLE. In vivo pharmacokinetics and in vitro absorption kinetics of flavonoids revealed enhanced bioavailability of rutin in FEF compared to GLE. However, GLE was more effective in inhibiting in vitro prostate cancer proliferation, viability and clonogenic capacity compared to FEF. Oral administration of 100mg/kg bw GLE showed ~1.2-fold higher tumor growth-inhibitory efficacy than FEF in human prostate tumor xenografts although the concentration of rutin and Q-3-G was more in FEF. Contrarily, AEF, despite its superior in vitro and in vivo efficacy, resulted in death of the mice due to toxicity. Our data indicate that despite lower absorption and bioavailability of rutin, maximum efficacy was achieved in the case of GLE, which also comprises of other phytochemical groups including acetogenins that make up its natural complex environment. Hence, our study emphasizes on evaluating the nature of interactions among Graviola leaf phytochemcials for developing favorable dose regimen for prostate cancer management to achieve optimal therapeutic benefits.""","""['Chunhua Yang', 'Sushma Reddy Gundala', 'Rao Mukkavilli', 'Subrahmanyam Vangala', 'Michelle D Reid', 'Ritu Aneja']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Isolation of three new annonaceous acetogenins from Graviola fruit (Annona muricata) and their anti-proliferation on human prostate cancer cell PC-3.', 'Three new anti-proliferative Annonaceous acetogenins with mono-tetrahydrofuran ring from graviola fruit (Annona muricata).', 'Polyketide Natural Products, Acetogenins from Graviola (Annona muricata L), its Biochemical, Cytotoxic Activity and Various Analyses Through Computational and Bio-Programming Methods.', 'In vivo antimalarial efficacy of acetogenins, alkaloids and flavonoids enriched fractions from Annona crassiflora Mart.', 'Emerging therapeutic potential of graviola and its constituents in cancers.', 'The use of African medicinal plants in cancer management.', 'Natural biomolecules and derivatives as anticancer immunomodulatory agents.', 'Leaf Extract and Active Fractions of Dillenia pentagyna Roxb.

The search for new effective compounds that can increase sensitivity of resistant cells to existing chemotherapeutics is an urgent need. In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that steroid derivatives showed promising results concerning their capacity to modulate resistance of multidrug-resistant cell lines.  Materials and methods:   Steroid derivatives were studied for their growth-inhibitory effect, cytotoxicity, reversal of multidrug resistance, apoptosis induction, and interaction with doxorubicin on multidrug resistant human ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B, member 1 (ABCB1) gene-transfected mouse T-lymphoma cell line, and human PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. The steroidal interaction with P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) was investigated by molecular docking.  Results:   Both the activity of steroid derivatives on inhibition of the ABCB1 pump and their interaction with doxorubicin are dependent on the substituent groups of the investigated steroidal structures. Even though the investigated steroid derivatives were found to have limited antiproliferative effect on the three different cancer cell lines, in combination with doxorubicin, most of them acted as good potentiators.

A large collection of OSCC specimens was evaluated for KLK4 expression and correlation with patients' characteristics and outcomes were determined. Our data indicate that KLK4 is differentially expressed in oral carcinomas. OSCC cell lines with high invasive and metastatic potential have the highest levels of KLK4 expression. KLK4 mRNA and protein expression correlated with enzyme activity detected by zymograms. Inhibition of KLK4 expression results in diminished invasive potential in OSCC cell lines. Consistently, KLK4 expression is stronger in primary tumors that later either recurred or developed metastases, suggesting that its preferential expression in OSCC might contribute to individual tumor biology.

We here describe a novel variant of MET that is expressed in 6% of high-grade gliomas. Characterization of this mutation in a glioma cell line revealed that it consists of an intronic deletion, resulting in a splice event connecting an intact splice donor site in exon 6 with the next splice acceptor site being that of exon 9. The encoded protein lacks parts of the extracellular IPT domains 1 and 2, encoded by exons 7 and 8, resulting in a novel pseudo-IPT and is named MET(Î7-8). MET(Î7-8) is located predominantly in the cytosol and is constitutively active. The auto-activating nature of MET(Î7-8), in combination with a lack of transmembrane localization, renders MET(Î7-8) not targetable using antibodies, although the protein is efficiently deactivated by MET-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Several studies have hypothesized that the overexpression of MET and the activating signaling axis in prostate cancer cells are associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). On the other hand, the expression of human kallikrein 1-related peptidase (KLK) 4, which activates plasma HGF activator zymogen, in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis or advanced stage has also been reported. In this study, we analyzed the expression and phosphorylation of MET along with KLK4 by immunohistochemistry in 62 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of prostate cancer collected by needle biopsy at our hospital between 2006 and 2011. As a result, the phosphorylation of MET was observed in 56% (35 of 62 cases) and positively correlated with worsening PSA relapse rate in a group of ADT-treated patients (P = 0.0445), suggesting significant correlation with CRPC. Overexpression of KLK4 was observed in patients with high T stage (P = 0.0001) and high Gleason score (P = 0.0146), and the expression was correlated with the phosphorylation of MET (P = 0.0002). Pathologically, strong MET phosphorylation observed in specific architectures in prostate cancer, such as cribriform structures, ill-defined glands or solid patterns, suggested the significance of MET activation in promoting the architectural formation of prostate cancer.

Recent studies have shown that metformin inhibits cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. The anti-tumor mechanisms of metformin include activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase/mTOR pathway and direct inhibition of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-mediated cellular proliferation. However, the anti-tumor mechanism in prostate cancer remains unclear. Because activation of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is required for prostate cell proliferation, IGF-1R inhibitors may be of therapeutic value. Accordingly, we examined the effects of metformin on IGF-1R signaling in prostate cancer cells. Metformin significantly inhibited PC-3 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. IGF-1R mRNA expression decreased significantly after 48 h of treatment, and IGF-1R protein expression decreased in a similar manner. IGF-1R knockdown by siRNA transfection led to inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of PC-3 cells. IGF-1 activated both ERK1/2 and Akt, but these effects were attenuated by metformin treatment. In addition, intraperitoneal treatment with metformin significantly reduced tumor growth and IGF-1R mRNA expression in PC-3 xenografts. Our results suggest that metformin is a potent inhibitor of the IGF-1/IGF-1R system and may be beneficial in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Haruo Kato', 'Yoshitaka Sekine', 'Yosuke Furuya', 'Yoshiyuki Miyazawa', 'Hidekazu Koike', 'Kazuhiro Suzuki']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Simvastatin inhibits the proliferation of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells via down-regulation of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.', 'Inhibition of IGF-1 signaling by genistein: modulation of E-cadherin expression and downregulation of Î²-catenin signaling in hormone refractory PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Luteolin inhibits insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Insulin-like growth factor signaling as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.', 'Structure and function of the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor.', 'Metformin Treatment Reduces CRC Aggressiveness in a Glucose-Independent Manner: An In Vitro and Ex Vivo Study.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic value of metformin in cancers: An updated meta-analysis based on 80 cohort studies.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Metformin regulates multiple signaling pathways within castration-resistant human prostate cancer cells.']"""

Methods:   Blood samples were obtained from 52 patients with prostate cancer before flutamide therapy.

Quantitative PCR analysis of both the training set and validation set confirmed that mRNA levels of multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1 or SLC47A1, encoded by 1 of the 11 genes) were significantly lower in patients with FILI. A small experiment on mice (three per group) showed that Mate1 knockout mice had an elevated serum concentration of 4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenylamine, a major metabolite of flutamide, 2 h after administration of the drug, suggesting that Mate1 could affect the pharmacokinetics of flutamide.

Design, setting, and participants:   This RCT included 175 biopsy-naÃ¯ve patients with suspicion for prostate cancer, randomized to an MRI group (n=86) and a control group (n=89) between September 2011 and June 2013.  Intervention:   In the MRI group, two-core targeted biopsy (TB) guided by computer-assisted fusion of MRI/TRUS images of MRI-suspicious lesions was followed by 12-core RB. In the control group, both two-core TB for abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) and/or TRUS-suspicious lesions and 12-core RB were performed. In patients with normal MRI or DRE/TRUS, only 12-core RB was performed.

Results:   Median patient age was 73.0 years, median prostate specific antigen was 42.6 ng/ml and median followup was 45.8 months. No variable associated with testosterone was predictive of progression-free survival. With regard to overall survival on univariate analysis nadir testosterone less than 16 ng/dl (p = 0.0190), less than 20 ng/dl (p = 0.0020) and less than 32 ng/dl (p = 0.0146) were significant together with other clinical factors. In contrast, nadir testosterone less than 8 and less than 12 ng/dl were not significant. Multivariate analysis showed that nadir testosterone less than 20 ng/dl was the significant prognostic factor (p = 0.0048). In addition, time to nadir testosterone was about 1 year (11.3 months). Patients were divided into rapid and slow types based on time to testosterone less than 20 ng/dl before and after 6 months, respectively. No significant difference in overall survival was observed between the 2 types. The current results suggest that the critical factor for prognosis was not a rapid decrease but whether nadir testosterone achieved a level of less than 20 ng/dl.  Conclusions:   Nadir testosterone 20 ng/dl was the most significant cutoff level for overall survival in Japanese patients with prostate cancer treated with combined androgen blockade.""","""['Shuhei Kamada', 'Shinichi Sakamoto', 'Keisuke Ando', 'Ayumi Muroi', 'Miki Fuse', 'Koji Kawamura', 'Takashi Imamoto', 'Hiroyoshi Suzuki', 'Maki Nagata', 'Naoki Nihei', 'Koichiro Akakura', 'Tomohiko Ichikawa']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Redefining clinically significant castration levels in patients with prostate cancer receiving continuous androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Testosterone Reduction of\xa0â¥ 480 ng/dL Predicts Favorable Prognosis of Japanese Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated With Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Prostate-cancer-specific survival and clinical progression-free survival in men with prostate cancer treated intermittently with testosterone-inactivating pharmaceuticals.', 'Intermittent complete androgen blockade in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Maximal testosterone suppression in prostate cancer--free vs total testosterone.', 'Methods for Evaluating the Efficacy of Medical Castration: A Systematic Review.', 'Revision of CHAARTED and LATITUDE criteria among Japanese de novo metastatic prostate cancer patients.', 'Current and Future Management of Locally Advanced and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic value of testosterone for the castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Effectiveness of three different luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in the chemical castration of patients with prostate cancer: Goserelin versus triptorelin versus leuprolide.']"""

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1,807 consecutive men who underwent initial multicore (â¥10) prostate biopsy under transrectal ultrasound guidance between Dec 2004 and Feb 2014. BMI was categorised based on the Asian classification of obesity as follows: <18.5 (underweight), 18.5-22.9 (normal weight), 23-24.9 (overweight), 25-29.9 (moderately obese), and â¥30 kg/m2 (severely obese). The odds ratios (OR) of each BMI category for risk of PCa and high-grade prostate cancer (HGPCa, Gleason score â¥4+3) detection were estimated in crude, age-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted models. Prevalence ratios and accuracies of PSA predicted PCa were also estimated across BMI groups.  Results:   In total, PCa was detected by biopsy in 750 (45.4%) men, and HGPCa was detected in 419 (25.4%) men. Compared with men of normal weight, underweight men and obese men were older and had higher prostate specific antigen levels. The risk of overall PCa detection via biopsy presented an obvious U-shaped relationship with BMI in crude analysis. Overall, 50.0%, 37.4%, 45.6% 54.4% and 74.1% of the men in the underweight, normal weight, overweight, moderately obese and severely obese groups, respectively, were diagnosed with PCa via biopsy. In multivariate analysis, obesity was significantly correlated with a higher risk of PCa detection (OR = 1.17, 95%CI 1.10-1.25, P<0.001). However, higher BMI was not correlated with HGPCa detection (OR = 1.03, 95%CI 0.97-1.09, P = 0.29). There were no significant differences in the accuracy of using PSA to predict PCa or HGPCa detection across different BMI categories.  Conclusion:   Obesity was associated with higher risk of PCa detection in the present Chinese biopsy population.

However, the relationship between AR and miR-124 is unclear. In the present study, we found a negative feedback loop between AR and miR-124 expression. On one hand, miR-124 was a positively regulated target gene of the AR, on the other hand, overexpression of miR-124 inhibited the expression of AR. In addition, we found that miR-124-2 and miR-124-3 promoters were hypermethylated in AR-negative PCa cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-124 inhibited proliferation rates and invasiveness capacity of PCa cells in vitro, and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our results support a negative feedback loop between AR and miR-124 expression.

In this investigation, using NDRG1 over-expression models in three tumor cell-types (namely, DU145, PC3MM and HT29) and also NDRG1 silencing in DU145 and HT29 cells, we reveal that NDRG1 decreases phosphorylation of a key proto-oncogene, cellular Src (c-Src), at a well-characterized activating site (Tyr416). NDRG1-mediated down-regulation of EGFR expression and activation were responsible for the decreased phosphorylation of c-Src (Tyr416). Indeed, NDRG1 prevented recruitment of c-Src to EGFR and c-Src activation. Moreover, NDRG1 suppressed Rac1 activity by modulating phosphorylation of a c-Src downstream effector, p130Cas, and its association with CrkII, which acts as a ""molecular switch"" to activate Rac1. NDRG1 also affected another signaling molecule involved in modulating Rac1 signaling, c-Abl, which then inhibited CrkII phosphorylation. Silencing NDRG1 increased cell migration relative to the control and inhibition of c-Src signaling using siRNA, or a pharmacological inhibitor (SU6656), prevented this increase. Hence, the role of NDRG1 in decreasing cell migration is, in part, due to its inhibition of c-Src activation. In addition, novel pharmacological agents, which induce NDRG1 expression and are currently under development as anti-metastatic agents, markedly increase NDRG1 and decrease c-Src activation.

We assessed CPS49-flavo or -PTX combinations cytotoxicity in a panel of PCa cell lines and PC3 xenografts. We found that CPS49 enhanced flavo or PTX cytotoxicity in human PCa cell lines while showed resistance in a non-tumor cell line. Furthermore, xenografts generated by inoculation of human prostate carcinoma PC3 cells in nu/nu mice showed that CPS49/flavo administration reduced tumor growth both after 2 weeks of co-treatment and after 1 week of pretreatment with a low dose of flavo followed by 2 weeks of co-treatment. PTX and CPS49 combination did not significantly reduce tumor growth in PC3 xenografts. Histological analysis of xenograft PC3 tumor samples from CPS49/flavo combination showed extensive areas of necrosis induced by the treatment. RT-qPCR array containing 23 genes from PC3 cells or PC3 xenografts exposed to CPS49/flavo combination showed that this treatment shut down the expression of several genes involved in adhesion, migration or invasion. In summary, the antitumor activity of CPS49 or flavopiridol was improved by the combination of these compounds and using half dose of that previously reported.

In nature, they are a common architecture. Some of their relevant technological applications include heat and sound insulation, lightweight materials, and tissue engineering scaffolds. Foams derived from natural polymers are particularly attractive for tissue culture due to their biodegradability and bio-compatibility. Here, the foaming potential of an extensive list of materials was assayed, including slabs elaborated from whole flour, the starch component only, or the protein fraction only of maize seeds.  Methodology/principal findings:   We used supercritical CO2 to produce foams from thermoplasticized maize derived materials. Polyethylene-glycol, sorbitol/glycerol, or urea/formamide were used as plasticizers. We report expansion ratios, porosities, average pore sizes, pore morphologies, and pore size distributions for these materials. High porosity foams were obtained from zein thermoplasticized with polyethylene glycol, and from starch thermoplasticized with urea/formamide. Zein foams had a higher porosity than starch foams (88% and 85%, respectively) and a narrower and more evenly distributed pore size. Starch foams exhibited a wider span of pore sizes and a larger average pore size than zein (208.84 vs. 55.43 Î¼m2, respectively). Proof-of-concept cell culture experiments confirmed that mouse fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) and two different prostate cancer cell lines (22RV1, DU145) attached to and proliferated on zein foams.  Conclusions/significance:   We conducted screening and proof-of-concept experiments on the fabrication of foams from cereal-based bioplastics. We propose that a key indicator of foamability is the strain at break of the materials to be foamed (as calculated from stress vs. strain rate curves).

Suspicious areas on images were selectively sampled by obtaining a median of four specimens (range, 1-9 specimens) using MRI-GB. In TRUS-GB, a median of 10 specimens (range, 6-14 specimens) were obtained. Telephone interviews were conducted one week after outpatient MRI-GB, asking patients about pain and side effects (hematuria, hemospermia, rectal bleeding, fever, and chills) of the two biopsy procedures and which of the two procedures they preferred. Multinomial regression analysis and Fisher's exact test was used to test for differences.  Results:   MRI-GB was preferred by 65% (35/54), and 82% (44/54) would undergo MRI-GB again. Pain intensity (P = 0.005) and bleeding duration (P = 0.004) were significantly lower for MRI-GB compared with TRUS-GB. Hematuria was less common after MRI-GB compared with TRUS-GB (P = 0.006). A high correlation was given between bleeding intensity and bleeding duration for TRUS-GB (r=0.77) and pain intensity and pain duration for MRI-GB (r=0.65). Although hemospermia, rectal hemorrhage, fever, and chills were less common in MRI, they showed no statistically significant difference.

We evaluated immediate and delayed radiation practice patterns and identified factors affecting their use.  Materials and methods:   Using the National Cancer Data Base we identified 57,448 men diagnosed with pT3 disease and/or positive margins from 2004 to 2009. Postoperative radiation use through 2011 was analyzed by time trends and multivariate analysis.  Results:   A total of 4,316 men (7.5%) received immediate radiation, 1,637 (2.8%) received delayed radiation and 51,495 (90%) were observed. Immediate and delayed radiation use remained relatively stable except for a small but significant decrease in immediate radiation in 2008. This decrease was associated with a relative increase in delayed radiotherapy. Compared to 2004 men diagnosed in 2007 to 2009 had 1.3-fold to 1.5-fold higher odds of delayed radiation than of immediate radiation (p <0.01). The strongest predictors of immediate radiation were margin status, T stage, N stage, Gleason score and patient age. Men with positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion, nodal disease, or Gleason score 8 or greater and younger men had 2.3-fold to sixfold greater odds of receiving immediate radiation than observation (p <0.01). Men with positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion or nodal metastases were also more likely to receive immediate rather than delayed radiation (p <0.01).  Conclusions:   Post-prostatectomy radiation is performed sparingly. Immediate radiation rates remain low but do not appear to be influenced substantially by delayed radiation use.

Synthesis of hepcidin in prostate cancer is controlled by a unique intersection of pathways that involves BMP4/7, IL6, Wnt, and the dual BMP and Wnt antagonist, SOSTDC1.

In both cell lines and clinical prostate cancer specimens, we identified that miR-25 expression in PCSCs was low/absent and steadily increased during their differentiation into cells with a luminal epithelial phenotype. Functional studies revealed that overexpression of miR-25 in prostate cancer cell lines and selected subpopulation of highly metastatic and tumorigenic cells (ALDH(high)) strongly affected the invasive cytoskeleton, causing reduced migration in vitro and metastasis via attenuation of extravasation in vivo. Here, we show, for the first time, that miR-25 can act as a tumor suppressor in highly metastatic PCSCs by direct functional interaction with the 3'-untranslated regions of proinvasive Î±v- and Î±6-integrins.

Methods:   A decision tree model compared the strategy of office-based transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS) for men with prior negative findings on biopsy with a strategy of initial MP-MRI with TRUS performed only in cases of abnormal results on imaging. Study end points were cost, number of biopsies, and cancers detected. Cost was based on Medicare reimbursement. Cost of sepsis and minor complications were incorporated into analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed by varying model assumptions.  Results:   The baseline model with 24% PCa found that the overall cost for 100 men was $90,400 and $87,700 for TRUS and MP-MRI arms, respectively. The MP-MRI arm resulted in 73 fewer biopsies per 100 men but detected 4 fewer cancers (16 vs. 20.4) than the TRUS arm did. A lower risk of PCa resulted in lower costs for the MP-MRI arm and a small difference in detected cancers. At lower cancer rates, MP-MRI is superior to TRUS over a wide range of sensitivity and specificity of MRI. A lower sensitivity of MP-MRI decreases the cost of the MP-MRI, as fewer biopsies are performed, but this also reduces the number of cancers detected.  Conclusions:   The use of MP-MRI to select patients for repeat biopsy reduced the number of biopsies needed by 73% but resulted in a few cancers being missed at lower cost when compared with the TRUS arm.

Methods:   We conducted a secondary analysis of Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 8794 randomized trial of adjuvant radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer. The primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival (MFS), defined as time to metastasis or death from any cause (competing mortality). We used competing risks regression models to identify an enriched subgroup at high risk for metastasis and low risk for competing mortality. We applied a cost model to estimate the impact of enrichment on trial cost and duration.  Results:   The treatment effect on metastasis was similar in the enriched subgroup (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.23-0.76) compared to the whole cohort (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30-0.81) while the effect on competing mortality was not significant in the subgroup or the whole cohort (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.39-1.23, vs. HR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.68-1.31). Due to the higher incidence of metastasis relative to competing mortality in the enriched subgroup, the treatment effect on MFS was greater in the subgroup compared to the whole cohort (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.36-0.82, vs. HR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58-1.01).

In this article, we explore how cancer affected prostate cancer survivors' diets and identify important influences on diet. Twenty prostate cancer survivors completed three 24-hour dietary recalls and an in-depth dietary interview. We analyzed interviews using a constant comparison approach, and dietary recall data quantitatively to assess quality and qualitatively to identify food choice patterns. Most men reported not making dietary changes following their cancer diagnosis but did express an interest in healthy eating, primarily to facilitate weight loss.

However, there is often poor translation between the 2D monolayer in vitro results and the nanoparticle-drug performance in vivo. One possible way of bridging this gap is the use of multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs) as an intermediate in vitro model due to its 3D structure. This paper aims to quantify and compare the results obtained from traditional 2D monolayer cell cultures and 3D MCTS by studying the cytotoxic effects of free paclitaxel (PTX) and paclitaxel, which has been conjugated to a poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate)-b-poly(carboxyethyl acrylate) (POEGMEA-b-PCEA-PTX) block copolymer and self-assembled to give a micellar delivery system. The core of the micelle was cross-linked with a diamino nondegradable cross-linker to compare the effects of micelle stability on the results. Although the 2D prostate tumor cell culture results indicated that all micellar variants (IC50: 193-271 nM) were significantly less toxic than free paclitaxel (IC50: 15.2 nM), the micelles showed faster and higher cytotoxicity than free PTX in the 3D prostate MCTS. The cross-linking of micelles even showed accelerated antitumor activities to the MCTS compared with un-cross-linked micelles. The results indicate that DAO-cross-linked POEGMEA-b-PCEA-PTX conjugate micelles will be a useful nanodrug carrier for prostate cancer therapy.

Conventional immunoenrichment of CTCs may fail to capture cells with low surface antigen expression. Micropore filtration presents a compelling label-free alternative that enriches CTCs using their biophysical rather than biochemical characteristics. However, this strategy is prone to clogging of the filter microstructure, which dramatically reduces the selectivity after processing large numbers of cells. Here, we use the resettable cell trap (RCT) mechanism to separate cells based on their size and deformability using an adjustable aperture that can be periodically cleared to prevent clogging. After separation, the output sample is stained and analyzed using multi-spectral analysis, which provides a more sensitive and unambiguous method to identify CTC biomarkers than traditional immunofluorescence.

Lysosomal-Î²-galactosidase (GLB1) hydrolyzes Î²-galactose from glycoconjugates and is the origin of senescence-associated Î²-gal activity (SA-Î²-gal). Using a new GLB1 antibody, senescence biology was investigated in prostate cancer (PCa) tissues.  Experimental design:   In vitro characterization of GLB1 was determined in primary prostate epithelial cell cultures passaged to replicative senescence and in therapy-induced senescence in PCa lines using chemotherapeutic agents. FFPE tissue microarrays were subjected to immunofluorescent staining for GLB1, Ki67 and HP1Î³ and automated quantitative imaging initially using AQUA in exploratory samples and Vectra in a validation series.  Results:   GLB1 expression accumulates in replicative and induced senescence and correlates with senescent morphology and P16 (CDKN2) expression. In tissue arrays, quantitative imaging detects increased GLB1 expression in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), known to contain senescent cells, and cancer compared to benign prostate tissues (p<0.01) and senescent cells contain low Ki67 and elevated HP1Î³. Within primary tumors, elevated GLB1 associates with lower T stage (p=0.01), localized versus metastatic disease (p=0.0003) and improved PSA-free survival (p=0.03). Increased GLB1 stratifies better PSA-free survival in intermediate grade PCa (0.01). Tissues that elaborate higher GLB1 display increased uniformity of expression.  Conclusion:   Increased GLB1 is a valuable marker in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues for the senescence-like phenotype and associates with improved cancer outcomes.

Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2), a small peptide constitutively expressed in the gastric mucosa, plays a protective role in restitution of gastric mucosa. Altered TFF2 expression was also related to the development of gastrointestinal cancer. TFF2 has been verified to promote cell migration via PAR4, but the roles of PAR4 and TFF2 in the progress of colorectal cancer are still unknown. In this study, the expression level of PAR4 and TFF2 in colorectal cancer tissues was measured using real-time PCR (n = 38), western blotting (n=38) and tissue microarrays (n = 66). The mRNA and protein expression levels of PAR4 and TFF2 were remarkably increased in colorectal cancer compared with matched noncancerous tissues, especially in positive lymph node and poorly differentiated cancers. The colorectal carcinoma cell LoVo showed an increased response to TFF2 as assessed by cell invasion upon PAR4 expression. However, after intervention of PAR4 expression, PAR4 positive colorectal carcinoma cell HT-29 was less responsive to TFF2 in cell invasion. Genomic bisulfite sequencing showed the hypomethylation of PAR4 promoter in colorectal cancer tissues and the hypermethylation in the normal mucosa that suggested the low methylation of promoter was correlated to the increased PAR4 expression. Taken together, the results demonstrated that the up-regulated expression of PAR4 and TFF2 frequently occurs in colorectal cancer tissues, and that overexpression of PAR4 may be resulted from promoter hypomethylation. While TFF2 promotes invasion activity of LoVo cells overexpressing PAR4, and this effect was significantly decreased when PAR4 was knockdowned in HT-29 cells.

Methods:   This retrospective study included 15 patients (10 male, 5 female) who underwent image-guided percutaneous biopsy of the urinary bladder between January 1999 and December 2013. The medical records, imaging studies, procedural details, and long-term follow-up of each patient were reviewed in detail to assess the feasibility of percutaneous bladder biopsy.  Results:   Ten patients had focal bladder masses and 5 patients had asymmetric or diffuse bladder wall thickening. Eleven patients had either negative or unsatisfactory cystoscopies prior to the biopsy. Percutaneous biopsies were performed under computed tomography guidance in 12 patients and ultrasound in 3 patients. All procedures were technically successful and there were no procedural complications. Malignancy was confirmed in 8 patients, among whom 6 had transitional cell carcinoma, 1 cervical cancer, and 1 prostate cancer metastasis. Seven patients had a benign diagnosis, including 3 that were later confirmed by pathology following surgery and 2 patients with a false-negative result. The overall sensitivity was 80% and accuracy was 87%.  Conclusions:   Image-guided percutaneous biopsy of the urinary bladder is a safe and technically feasible procedure with a high sensitivity and accuracy rate.

Previously we observed that inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-Lox) activity induces apoptosis in some types of prostate cancer cells, suggesting an important role of 5-Lox in the viability of prostate cancer cells. However, nothing is known about the role of 5-Lox in the survival of castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer cells. Thus, we tested the effects of MK591, a second-generation, specific inhibitor of 5-Lox activity, on the viability and metastatic characteristics of CRPC cells. We observed that MK591 effectively kills the bone-invading C4-2B human prostate cancer cells (which bear characteristics of CRPC), but does not affect normal, non-cancer fibroblasts (which do not express 5-Lox) in the same experimental conditions.

Over-treatment of these patients occurs because of uncertainty in the aggressiveness of the entire tumor based on the biopsies, which do not accurately sample multifocal tumors. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are stable serum markers and differential miRNA levels occur in men with PCa. The goal of this study was to identify circulating miRNAs that were associated with aggressive or indolent PCa. We measured circulating miRNAs in 150 patients prior to surgery and compared the miRNA levels to the pathology of the entire radical prostatectomy specimen. For this study we used an exceptionally well-characterized cohort of patients who had benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), low-grade or high-grade PCa. Low-grade was defined as patients with 100% Gleason grade 3 tumor as determined by step-wise sectioning. High-grade PCa patients had 30-90% Gleason grade 4+5 in the tumor. BPH patients had at least two biopsies negative for PCa. Twenty one miRNAs were selected for analysis. The miRNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR and analyzed by logistic regression. High levels of 14 miRNAs were exclusively present in the serum from patients with low-grade PCa or BPH, compared to men with high-grade PCa who had consistently low levels. The expression levels of the 14 miRNAs were combined into a ""miR Score"" which had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.939 to predict absence of high-grade PCa among PCa and BPH patients. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was known for the PCa patients and a combined ""miR Risk Score"" accurately classified a subset of patients with low risk of BCR (NPV 0.941). In summary, measurement of serum miRNAs may have pre-surgical utility in combination with clinical risk calculators to identify patients with low risk of harboring aggressive PCa.""","""['Brittany L Mihelich', 'Joseph C Maranville', 'Rosalie Nolley', 'Donna M Peehl', 'Larisa Nonn']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Differential blood-based diagnosis between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: miRNA as source for biomarkers independent of PSA level, Gleason score, or TNM status.', 'Detection of miRNAs in urine of prostate cancer patients.', 'A 17-gene assay to predict prostate cancer aggressiveness in the context of Gleason grade heterogeneity, tumor multifocality, and biopsy undersampling.', 'The potential of cell-free and exosomal microRNAs as biomarkers in liquid biopsy in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Virus encoded circulatory miRNAs for early detection of prostate cancer.', 'Biomarkers for the Detection and Risk Stratification of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'The clinical significance of circulating miR-21, miR-142, miR-143, and miR-146a in patients with prostate cancer.', 'The Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of Circulating MicroRNAs in the Assessment of Patients With Prostate Cancer: Rational and Progress.', 'Breviscapine Participates in the Progression of Prostate Cancer by Inhibiting ZFP91 Expression through Upregulation of MicroRNA-129-5p.', 'Identification of miR-20a-5p as Robust Normalizer for Urine microRNA Studies in Renal Cell Carcinoma and a Profile of Dysregulated microRNAs.']"""

To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a meta-analysis strategy for gene prioritization that employs three different genetic resources--gene expression data, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data--in an integrative manner. For integration, we utilized an improved technique for the order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to combine scores from distinct resources. This method was evaluated on two publicly available datasets regarding prostate cancer and lung cancer to identify disease-related genes. Consequently, our proposed strategy for gene prioritization showed its superiority to conventional methods in discovering significant disease-related genes with several types of genetic resources, while making good use of potential complementarities among available resources.""","""['Jingmin Che', 'Miyoung Shin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Detection and interpretation of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL).', 'Genetic regulation of gene expression in the lung identifies CST3 and CD22 as potential causal genes for airflow obstruction.', 'Integrative analyses for functional mechanisms underlying associations for rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci analysis in asthma.', 'eQTL analysis in humans.', 'Genome-wide association analysis reveals regulation of at-risk loci by DNA methylation in prostate cancer.', 'A Novel Prioritization Method in Identifying Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism-Related Genes.']"""

Factors associated with the diagnosis of prostate cancer were evaluated by using logistic regression analysis.  Results:   Patients with prostate cancer were more likely to have higher serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (p=0.001) and focal FDG uptake (p=0.036) than were those without.

As a member of the RAD9-HUS1-RAD1 (9-1-1) complex, it can sense DNA damage and recruit ATR to damage sites. RAD9 binding can enhance activities of members of different DNA repair pathways, including NEIL1 DNA glycosylase, which initiates base excision repair (BER) by removing damaged DNA bases. Moreover, RAD9 can act independently of 9-1-1 as a gene-specific transcription factor. Herein, we show that mouse Rad9(-/-) relative to Rad9(+/+) embryonic stem (ES) cells have reduced levels of Neil1 protein. Also, human prostate cancer cells, DU145 and PC-3, knocked down for RAD9 demonstrate reduced NEIL1 abundance relative to controls. We found that Rad9 is required for Neil1 protein stability in mouse ES cells, whereas it regulates NEIL1 transcription in the human cells. RAD9 depletion enhances sensitivity to UV, gamma rays and menadione, but ectopic expression of RAD9 or NEIL1 restores resistance. Glycosylase/apurinic lyase activity was reduced in Rad9(-/-) mouse ES and RAD9 knocked-down human prostate cancer whole cell extracts, relative to controls.

Methods:   The records of 33 patients with cervical, rectal or prostate cancer with asymptomatic haemorrhoids, which were confirmed by colonoscopy before the start of radiotherapy (RT), were reviewed. Acute anal symptoms, such as anal pain and bleeding, were observed up to 1 month after RT completion. Dosimetric and patient factors were analysed, and subgroup analyses were performed.  Results:   The median induction dose for acute anal symptoms was 34.1 Gy (range, 28.8-50.4 Gy). Post-operative treatment intent showed more acute anal toxicity of patient factors (p = 0.04). In subgroup analysis, post-operative treatment intent and concurrent chemoradiotherapy were found to be related to acute anal symptoms (p < 0.01). Of the dosimetric factors, V10 tended to be related to acute anal symptoms (p = 0.08).  Conclusion:   This study indicates that asymptomatic haemorrhoid may deteriorate after low-dose radiation and that patient factors, such as treatment intent and concurrent chemotherapy, probably influence anal toxicity. In patients with asymptomatic haemorrhoids, WPRT requires careful dosimetry and clinical attention.

Methods:   From March 2003 to November 2005, 92 patients with cervical cancer stage IA2 to IIA were randomly assigned for surgical treatment with conventional radical hysterectomy (CRH) or NSRH, and 86 patients finally included in the analysis. Adequacy of nerve sparing, radicality, bladder function, and oncologic safety were assessed by quantifying the nerve fibers in the paracervix, measuring the extent of paracervix and harvested lymph nodes (LNs), urodynamic study (UDS) with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and 10-year disease-free survival (DFS), respectively.  Results:   There were no differences in clinicopathologic characteristics between two groups. The median number of nerve fiber was 12 (range, 6 to 21) and 30 (range, 17 to 45) in the NSRH and CRH, respectively (p<0.001). The extent of resected paracervix and number of LNs were not different between the two groups. Volume of residual urine and bladder compliance were significantly deteriorated at 12 months after CRH. On the contrary, all parameters of UDS were recovered no later than 3 months after NSRH. Evaluation of the IPSS showed that the frequency of long-term urinary symptom was higher in CRH than in the NSRH group. The median duration before the postvoid residual urine volume became less than 50 mL was 11 days (range, 7 to 26 days) in NSRH group and was 18 days (range, 10 to 85 days) in CRH group (p<0.001). No significant difference was observed in the 10-year DFS between two groups.  Conclusion:   NSRH appears to be effective in preserving bladder function without sacrificing oncologic safety.""","""['Ju Won Roh', 'Dong Ock Lee', 'Dong Hoon Suh', 'Myong Cheol Lim', 'Sang Soo Seo', 'Jinsoo Chung', 'Sun Lee', 'Sang Yoon Park']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Gynecol Oncol""","""['Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy: time for a new standard of care for cervical cancer?', 'Feasibility of unilateral or bilateral nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy in patients with cervical cancer and evaluation of the post-surgery recovery of the bladder and rectal function.', 'A prospective study on nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy in patients with cervical cancer.', 'Surgical, Urinary, and Survival Outcomes of Nerve-sparing Versus Traditional Radical Hysterectomy: A Retrospective Cohort Study in China.', 'Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy compared to standard radical hysterectomy for women with early stage cervical cancer (stage Ia2 to IIa).', 'Oncological outcomes of nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer: a systematic review.', 'VEGFR2 targeted microbubble-based ultrasound molecular imaging improving the diagnostic sensitivity of microinvasive cervical cancer.', 'Impact of timing of urinary catheter removal on voiding dysfunction after radical hysterectomy for early cervical cancer.', 'The Relationship Between Parametrial Involvement and Parametrial Tissue Removed in Radical Surgery in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer.', 'Cancer of the cervix uteri: 2021 update.', 'Long-Term Effect of Early Post-operative Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation on Voiding Function After Radical Hysterectomy: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial.']"""

Troglitazone, a PPARÎ³ agonist, exhibits significant anti-tumor activity and can alter glutamine metabolism in multiple cell types. Therefore, we examined whether troglitazone would disrupt glutamine metabolism in tumor cells and whether its action was reliant on PPARÎ³ activity. We found that troglitazone treatment suppressed glutamine uptake and the expression of the glutamine transporter, ASCT2, and glutaminase. In addition, troglitazone reduced 13C-glutamine incorporation into the TCA cycle, decreased [ATP], and resulted in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Further, troglitazone treatment decreased tumor cell growth, which was partially rescued with the addition of the TCA-intermediate, Î±-ketoglutarate, or the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Importantly, troglitazone's effects on glutamine uptake or viable cell number were found to be PPARÎ³-independent. In contrast, troglitazone caused a decrease in c-Myc levels, while the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132, rescued c-Myc, ASCT2 and GLS1 expression, as well as glutamine uptake and cell number. Lastly, combinatorial treatment of troglitazone and metformin resulted in a synergistic decrease in cell number. Therefore, characterizing new anti-tumor properties of previously approved FDA therapies supports the potential for repurposing of these agents.""","""['Miriam R Reynolds', 'Brian F Clem']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biol Chem""","""['Troglitazone suppresses c-Myc levels in human prostate cancer cells via a PPARÎ³-independent mechanism.', 'Troglitazone, a PPAR agonist, inhibits human prostate cancer cell growth through inactivation of NFÎºB via suppression of GSK-3Î² expression.', 'Mechanism of thiazolidinedione-dependent cell death in Jurkat T cells.', 'Reprofiling of Troglitazone Towards More Active and Less Toxic Derivatives: A New Hope for Cancer Treatment?', 'Oncogenes and tumor suppressors regulate glutamine metabolism in cancer cells.', 'Bergenin, a PPARÎ³ agonist, inhibits Th17 differentiation and subsequent neutrophilic asthma by preventing GLS1-dependent glutaminolysis.', 'Dietary protein-induced hepatic IGF-1 secretion mediated by PPARÎ³ activation.']"""

To the authors' knowledge, only seven reported cases exist with choroidal metastasis secondary to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This study describes an additional patient with metastatic PTC with simultaneous appearance of choroidal mass and cutaneous deposits while on systemic therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). These infrequent sites of metastasis are typically associated with a dismal prognosis following the diagnoses. However, this patient has not shown evidence of choroid or cutaneous recurrence one year following local targeted and systemic therapy.  Patient findings:   The case is presented of a 70-year-old male with widely metastatic PTC to the lymph nodes, lung, and mediastinum who was found to have choroidal metastasis six years after his initial diagnosis.  Summary:   The patient was asymptomatic and was found to have an incidental right choroidal mass on routine ophthalmology exam. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit revealed an isolated right choroid lesion suspicious for melanoma or metastasis. Concurrent to this discovery, he was noted to have progression of the lung and mediastinal disease along with new dermal lesions on the chest wall suspicious for dermal metastasis. Both the choroid and dermal metastases occurred while being on a TKI. Given his previous history of male breast carcinoma, a biopsy of the choroid was performed, which confirmed PTC. The patient developed endophthalmitis and subsequently underwent enucleation of the right eye. The choroid mass was completely excised, measured 3.5 mmÃ9.5 mm with negative margins, and histopathology was consistent with metastatic PTC. Pulmonary, mediastinal, and cutaneous lesions regressed after external beam radiation therapy, following which systemic therapy was changed to a different multikinase inhibitor.  Conclusion:   A rare and unique case is reported of choroidal metastasis from PTC that presented with concurrent new dermal metastasis in addition to lung and mediastinal lymph node progression. Furthermore, the patient developed choroid and dermal lesions while on a TKI and remained stable without recurrence in these regions after switching to an alternate multikinase inhibitor.""","""['Chhaya Makhija', 'Yungpo Bernard Su', 'Whitney Goldner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Thyroid""","""['Papillary thyroid carcinoma: bilateral choroidal metastases with extrascleral extension.', 'Choroidal and orbital metastases from thyroid cancer.', 'Pancreatic metastasis arising from a BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer: the role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy and response to sorafenib therapy.', 'Choroidal and skin metastases from papillary thyroid cancer: case and a review of the literature.', 'Clinicopathological report: bilateral choroidal metastases from papillary thyroid cancer.', 'Choroidal metastases from thymic carcinoma during pregnancy: Case Report.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of 2290 men who underwent radical prostatectomy from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database from 2000 to 2013 was carried out. There were 1592 (70%) non-smokers and 698 (30%) smokers at radical prostatectomy. Logistic regression was used to examine whether smoking predicted Gleason score (â¥4 + 3), margin status, extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion. Linear regression was used to test the relationship between smoking and tumor volume.  Results:   Smokers were younger, more likely to be black, had lower body mass index, higher pathological Gleason score, more positive margins and extracapsular extension (all P < 0.05) versus non-smokers. On crude analysis, smoking was associated with positive margins (odds ratio 1.32; P = 0.003) and extracapsular extension (odds ratio 1.26; P = 0.036). After adjusting for multiple clinical factors, smoking remained associated with a 19-35% increased risk of every adverse feature studied, though only the association with extracapsular extension reached significance. On multivariable analysis, a trend for smokers to have larger tumor volumes (geometric mean 5.8 vs 5.3 g; P = 0.062) was found.  Conclusions:   In patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, there seems to be a trend for smokers to have worse pathological features compared with non-/former smokers.

This study explored the psychological impact (in terms of general and PrCa-specific worry and risk perceptions) on men with a family history of PrCa, undergoing prostate screening and genetic-risk profiling, within a research study.  Methods:   A prospective exploratory approach was adopted, incorporating a sequential mixed-method design. Questionnaires were completed at two time points to measure the impact of undergoing screening and genetic-risk profiling. In-depth interviews were completed in a subgroup after all study procedures were completed and analysed using a framework approach.  Results:   Ninety-five men completed both questionnaires, and 26 were interviewed. No measurable psychological distress was detectable in the group as a whole. The interview findings fell into two categories: 'feeling at risk' and 'living with risk'. The feeling of being at risk of PrCa is a part of men's lives, shaped by assumptions and information gathered over many years. Men used this information to communicate about PrCa risk to their peers. Men overestimate their risk of PrCa and have an innate assumption that they will develop PrCa. The interviews revealed that men experienced acute anxiety when waiting for screening results.  Conclusions:   Personalised genetic-risk assessments do not prevent men from overestimating their risk of PrCa. Screening anxiety is common, and timeframes for receiving results should be kept to a minimum.

Materials and methods:   454 patients receiving RRP and pelvic lymph node dissection were assessed for postoperative lymphoceles using the ultrasound method. Findings were correlated to clinical parameters from a database (age, BMI, initial PSA, number of lymph nodes removed, prostate weight, duration of surgery, hospital stay, duration of catheterisation) and possible unconventional risk factors using meteorological data.  Results:   Overall, 15.4% developed a lymphocele, 2.6% had a symptomatic lymphocele requiring treatment. The mean size of the lymphoceles requiring treatment was significantly higher (400 vs. 115 ml). Patients with lymphocele stayed longer in hospital. No correlation could be found between the clinical parameters and the risk for lymphoceles. Functional results in terms of urinary continence were similar. The assessment of meteorological risk factors showed a correlation of lymphoceles with air humidity.  Conclusion:   Lymphoceles are common after RRP, but few cases require intervention.

Potent therapies that prevent AR signaling, such as Enzalutamide (ENZ), are mainstay treatments for CRPC; however patients eventually progress with ENZ resistant (ENZR) disease. In this study, we investigated one mechanism of ENZ resistance, and tried to improve therapeutic efficiency of ENZ. We found HER2 expression is increased in ENZR tumors and cell lines, and is induced by ENZ treatment of LNCaP cells. ENZ-induced HER2 overexpression was dependent on AKT-YB1 activation and modulated AR activity. HER2 dependent AR activation in LNCaP and ENZR cells was effectively blocked by treatment with the EGFR/HER2 inhibitor Lapatinib, which reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis. Despite efficacy in vitro, in vivo monotherapy with Lapatinib did not prevent ENZR tumor growth. However, combination treatment of Lapatinib with ENZ most effectively induced cell death in LNCaP cells in vitro and was more effective than ENZ alone in preventing tumor growth in an in vivo model of CRPC. These results suggest that while HER2 overexpression and subsequent AR activation is a targetable mechanism of resistance to ENZ, therapy using Lapatinib is only a rational therapeutic approach when used in combination with ENZ in CRPC.""","""['Masaki Shiota', 'Jennifer L Bishop', 'Ario Takeuchi', 'Ka Mun Nip', 'Thomas Cordonnier', 'Eliana Beraldi', 'Hidetoshi Kuruma', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Amina Zoubeidi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9Â® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Combination AZD5363 with Enzalutamide Significantly Delays Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer in Preclinical Models.', 'Targeting AR-Beclin 1 complex-modulated growth factor signaling increases the antiandrogen Enzalutamide sensitivity to better suppress the castration-resistant prostate cancer growth.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Drug Resistance of Enzalutamide in CRPC.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Basal epithelial cells in prostate development, tumorigenesis, and cancer progression.', 'Co-Targeting ErbB Receptors and the PI3K/AKT Axis in Androgen-Independent Taxane-Sensitive and Taxane-Resistant Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Phase II Study of Enzalutamide for Patients With Androgen Receptor-Positive Salivary Gland Cancers (Alliance A091404).', 'Overcoming the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to new generation hormonal therapies in advanced prostate cancer: focus on androgen receptor independent pathways.']"""

Well-being was threatened by reduced sense of the future, isolation and uncertainty. Yet, the men pursued well-being by managing their emotions, striving for the future whilst enjoying life in the present, taking care of their families and renegotiating purpose.

The variation of the prostate volume can lead to variations in the final prescribed dose in treatment planning procedures. As such, it is important to understand their influence for dose optimisation purposes. This work reports on a dosimetric study of the swelling of the prostate in prostate brachytherapy using Monte Carlo simulations. Dosimetric measurements performed on a physical anthropomorphic tissue-equivalent prostate phantom and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used to validate the MC model. Finally the MC model was also used to simulate prostate swelling in a real treatment planning procedure.

Although various epigenetic modifications, such as histone deacetylation and H3K9 methylation, have been implicated in this process, how they are coordinated remains elusive. We recently revealed that MPP8 couples H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation for E-cadherin gene silencing and promotes tumor cell migration, invasion, and EMT. Here, we show that MPP8 cooperates with the class III HDAC SIRT1 in this process through their physical interaction. SIRT1 antagonizes PCAF-catalyzed MPP8-K439 acetylation to protect MPP8 from ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Conversely, MPP8 recruits SIRT1 for H4K16 deacetylation after binding to methyl-H3K9 on target promoters. Consequently, disabling either MPP8 methyl-H3K9 binding or SIRT1 interaction de-represses E-cadherin and reduces EMT phenotypes, as does knockdown of MPP8 or SIRT1 in prostate cancer cells. These results illustrate how SIRT1 and MPP8 reciprocally promote each other's function and coordinate epithelial gene silencing and EMT.""","""['Lidong Sun', 'Kenji Kokura', 'Victoria Izumi', 'John M Koomen', 'Edward Seto', 'Jiandong Chen', 'Jia Fang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""EMBO Rep""","""['ZEB2 stably represses RAB25 expression through epigenetic regulation by SIRT1 and DNMTs during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'Methyl-H3K9-binding protein MPP8 mediates E-cadherin gene silencing and promotes tumour cell motility and invasion.', 'miR-200a regulates SIRT1 expression and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like transformation in mammary epithelial cells.', 'Narrower insight to SIRT1 role in cancer: A potential therapeutic target to control epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells.', 'Epigenetic regulation of EMT: the Snail story.', 'The Interplay between Intracellular Iron Homeostasis and Neuroinflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases.', 'TRIM28 represses renal cell carcinoma cell proliferation by inhibiting TFE3/KDM6A-regulated autophagy.', 'Characterization of Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Related Protein 2 Interactions with Heterochromatin.', 'The Mechanistic Roles of Sirtuins in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by protein lysine acetylation.']"""

Zone of origin may have prognostic value or reflect distinct molecular subtypes; however, it can be difficult to determine in practice. Using whole-genome gene expression, we built a signature of zone using normal tissue from five individuals and found that it successfully classified nine tumors of known zone. Hypothesizing that this signature captures tumor zone of origin, we assessed its relationship with clinical factors among 369 tumors of unknown zone from radical prostatectomies (RPs) and found that tumors that molecularly resembled TZ tumors showed lower mortality (P = 0.09) that was explained by lower Gleason scores (P = 0.009). We further applied the signature to an earlier study of 88 RP and 333 transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) tumor samples, also of unknown zone, with gene expression on ~6000 genes. We had observed previously substantial expression differences between RP and TURP specimens, and hypothesized that this might be because RPs capture primarily PZ tumors, whereas TURPs capture more TZ tumors. Our signature distinguished these two groups, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 87% (P < 0.0001). Our findings that zonal differences in normal tissue persist in tumor tissue and that these differences are associated with Gleason score and sample type suggest that subtypes potentially resulting from different etiologic pathways might arise in these zones.

ATM loss of function can produce a synthetic lethal phenotype in combination with tumor-associated mutations in FA/BRCA pathway components. In this study, we took an siRNA screening strategy to identify other tumor suppressors that, when inhibited, similarly sensitized cells to ATM inhibition. In this manner, we determined that PTEN and ATM were synthetically lethal when jointly inhibited. PTEN-deficient cells exhibited elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, increased endogenous DNA damage, and constitutive ATM activation. ATM inhibition caused catastrophic DNA damage, mitotic cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis specifically in PTEN-deficient cells in comparison with wild-type cells. Antioxidants abrogated the increase in DNA damage and ATM activation in PTEN-deficient cells, suggesting a requirement for oxidative DNA damage in the mechanism of cell death. Lastly, the ATM inhibitor KU-60019 was specifically toxic to PTEN mutant cancer cells in tumor xenografts and reversible by reintroduction of wild-type PTEN.

A total of 3 patients with prostate cancer with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or 3 were included in this study. For each patient, 27 treatment plans were created using a combination of planning parameters (field width of 1, 2.5, and 5cm; pitch of 0.172, 0.287, and 0.43; and modulation factor of 1.8, 3, and 3.5). Then, plans were analyzed using several dosimetrical indices: the prescription isodose to target volume (PITV) ratio, homogeneity index (HI), conformity index (CI), target coverage index (TCI), modified dose HI (MHI), conformity number (CN), and quality factor (QF). Furthermore, dose-volume histogram of critical structures and critical organ scoring index (COSI) were used to analyze organs at risk (OAR) sparing. Interestingly, treatment plans with a field width of 1cm showed more favorable results than others in the planning target volume (PTV) and OAR indices. However, the treatment time of the 1-cm field width was 3 times longer than that of plans with a field width of 5cm. There was no substantial decrease in treatment time when the pitch was increased from 0.172 to 0.43, but the PTV indices were slightly compromised. As expected, field width had the most significant influence on all of the indices including PTV, OAR, and treatment time. For the patients with good performance who can tolerate a longer treatment time, we suggest a field width of 1cm, pitch of 0.172, and modulation factor of 1.8; for the patients with poor performance status, field width of 5cm, pitch of 0.287, and a modulation factor of 3.5 should be considered.""","""['Yuan Jie Cao', 'Suk Lee', 'Kyung Hwan Chang', 'Jang Bo Shim', 'Kwang Hyeon Kim', 'Young Je Park', 'Chul Yong Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['In regard to the paper: Patient performance-based plan parameter optimization for prostate cancer in tomotherapy Cao YJ, Lee S, Chang KH, Shim JB, Kim KH, Park YJ, Kim CY.

Study 2--the effect of Î²-adrenoceptor blocker therapy on cancer survival: a retrospective cohort study""","""Objectives:   To conduct a fully independent, external validation of a research study based on one electronic health record database using a different database sampling from the same population.  Design:   Retrospective cohort analysis of Î²-blocker therapy and all-cause mortality in patients with cancer.  Setting:   Two UK national primary care databases (PCDs): the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Doctors' Independent Network (DIN).  Participants:   CPRD data for 11,302 patients with cancer compared with published results from DIN for 3462 patients; study period January 1997 to December 2006.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   All-cause mortality: overall; by treatment subgroup (Î²-blockers only, Î²-blockers plus other blood pressure lowering medicines (BPLM), other BPLMs only); and by cancer site.  Results:   Using CPRD, Î²-blocker use was not associated with mortality (HR=1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14, vs patients prescribed other BPLMs only), but DIN Î²-blocker users had significantly higher mortality (HR=1.18, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.33). However, these HRs were not statistically different (p=0.063), but did differ for patients on Î²-blockers alone (CPRD=0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; DIN=1.37, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.61; p<0.001). Results for individual cancer sites differed by study, but only significantly for prostate and pancreas cancers. Results were robust under sensitivity analyses, but we could not be certain that mortality was identically defined in both databases.  Conclusions:   We found a complex pattern of similarities and differences between databases. Overall treatment effect estimates were not statistically different, adding to a growing body of evidence that different UK PCDs produce comparable effect estimates. However, individually the two studies lead to different conclusions regarding the safety of Î²-blockers and some subgroup effects differed significantly.

However, F-18-labeled compounds offer several advantages, including the potential for delayed imaging, high starting activities enabling multidose preparation, and improved spatial resolution in PET. For F-18 labeling of peptides conjugated with a suitable chelator, a fast and feasible method is the use of [Al(18)F](2+). In the present study, the radiofluorinations of a well-known PSMA ligand Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC (PSMA-HBED) via [Al(18)F](2+) were performed with respect to various reaction parameters, along with the biological evaluations in a cell experiment.  Procedures:   [Al(18)F]PSMA-HBED was prepared by adding Na[(18)F]F into a vial containing 0.026 Î¼mol peptide (in 0.05 M NaOAc buffer) and 0.03 Î¼mol AlCl3â6H2O (in 0.05 M NaOAc buffer). Then, it was stirred at different temperatures from 1 to 30 min. Afterwards, purification was carried out by solid phase extraction. Biological evaluations were performed in PSMA-positive cell lines LNCaP C4-2, along with a negative control using PC-3 cell lines.  Results:   The best labeling results (81 Â± 0.5 %, n = 4) were observed with 0.026 Î¼mol peptide (30 Â°C, 5 min). For preclinical experiments, the production of [Al(18)F]PSMA-HBED at 35 Â°C including purification by solid phase extraction (SPE) succeeded within 45 min, resulting in a radiochemical yield of 49 Â± 1.2 % (decay-corrected, n = 6, radiochemical purity â¥98 %) at EOS. The labeled peptide revealed serum stability for 4 h as well as a promising binding coefficient (K D) value of 10.3 Â± 2.2 nM in cell experiments with PSMA-positive LNCaP C4-2 cells.  Conclusion:   An efficient and one-pot method for the radiosynthesis of [Al(18)F]PSMA-HBED was developed (0.26 Î¼mol of precursor at 35 Â°C). In cell culture studies, the K D suggests [Al(18)F]PSMA-HBED as a potential PSMA ligand for future investigations in vivo and clinical applications afterwards.""","""['Noeen Malik', 'Benjamin Baur', 'Gordon Winter', 'Sven N Reske', 'Ambros J Beer', 'Christoph Solbach']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['Validation of a Al18FPSMA-11 preparation for clinical applications.', 'Synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of a new class of high-affinity 18F-labeled PSMA ligands for detection of prostate cancer by PET imaging.', 'Optimization of Labeling PSMAHBED with Ethanol-Postprocessed 68Ga and Its Quality Control Systems.', '18F-Labeled, PSMA-Targeted Radiotracers: Leveraging the Advantages of Radiofluorination for Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging.', 'Current Status of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeting in Nuclear Medicine: Clinical Translation of Chelator Containing Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligands Into Diagnostics and Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Fluorine-18 Labeled Urea-Based Ligands Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) with Increased Tumor and Decreased Renal Uptake.', 'Rhenium(i) complexation-dissociation strategy for synthesising fluorine-18 labelled pyridine bidentate radiotracers.', 'Radiolabeled PSMA Inhibitors.', 'The aluminium-18Ffluoride revolution: simple radiochemistry with a big impact for radiolabelled biomolecules.', 'One-pot and one-step automated radio-synthesis of 18FAlF-FAPI-74 using a multi purpose synthesizer: a proof-of-concept experiment.']"""

However, little is known about how patients conceptualize the benefits and harms of overused screening tests or how patients make decisions regarding these tests.  Objective:   To determine how patients think about the harms and benefits of overused screening tests and how they consider these and other factors when making decisions.  Design:   Semi-structured, qualitative interviews.  Participants:   The study comprised 50 patients, ages 50-84, who had previously received or not received any of four overused screening services: 1) prostate cancer screening (men ages 50-69), 2) colon cancer screening (men and women ages 76-85), 3) osteoporosis screening (low-risk women ages 50-64), or 4) cardiovascular disease screening (low-risk men and women ages 50-85).  Approach:   We conducted a thematic analysis, using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Two independent coders analyzed interview transcriptions to identify themes and exemplifying quotes.  Key results:   Many patients could not name a harm of screening. When they did name harms, patients often focused on only the harms of the screening test itself and rarely mentioned harms further along the screening cascade (e.g., from follow-up testing and treatment). In contrast, patients could easily name benefits of screening, although many seemed to misunderstand or overestimate the magnitude of the benefits. Furthermore, patients described many additional factors they considered when making screening decisions, including their clinicians' recommendations, their age, family or friends' experiences with disease, and insurance coverage.  Conclusions:   This study highlights the need to help adults recognize and understand the benefits and harms of screening and make appropriate decisions about overused screening tests.""","""['Anne Sutkowi-Hemstreet', 'Maihan Vu', 'Russell Harris', 'Noel T Brewer', 'Rowena J Dolor', 'Stacey L Sheridan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Gen Intern Med""","""['Jump Forward to Get Back to Basics.', 'A Comparative Effectiveness Trial of Alternate Formats for Presenting Benefits and Harms Information for Low-Value Screening Services: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', ""Clinicians' perceptions of the benefits and harms of prostate and colorectal cancer screening."", 'Discontinuing Cancer Screening for Older Adults: a Comparison of Clinician Decision-Making for Breast, Colorectal, and Prostate Cancer Screenings.', 'Presentation of Benefits and Harms in US Cancer Screening and Prevention Guidelines: Systematic Review.', 'Screening for osteoporosis in the adult U.S. population: ACPM position statement on preventive practice.', 'Ã lâencontre du statu quo en matiÃ¨re de dÃ©pistage: Appel Ã  lâaction pour amÃ©liorer lâenseignement des soins de santÃ© prÃ©ventifs.', 'Going against the status quo in screening: Call to action to improve teaching in preventive health care.', 'Why do people take part in atrial fibrillation screening?

Constitutional genetic variation of the FASN gene and the expression levels of FASN protein in cancer cells could thus be expected to predict outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP). This study evaluates the associations of malignant tissue status, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (NADT) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FASN with FASN protein expression in prostate tissue. The study then examines the associations of FASN SNPs and gene expression with three measures of post-prostatectomy outcome.  Methods:   Seven tagging FASN SNPs were genotyped in 659 European American men who underwent RP at Roswell Park Cancer Institute between 1993 and 2005. FASN protein expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry. The patients were followed for an average of 6.9 years (range: 0.1-20.6 years). Outcome was assessed using three end points: biochemical failure, treatment failure and development of distant metastatic PCa. Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to evaluate the associations of the tagging SNPs and FASN expression with these end points. Bivariate associations with outcomes were considered; the associations also were controlled for known aggressiveness indicators.  Results:   Overall, no SNPs were associated with any known aggressiveness indicators. FASN staining intensity was stronger in malignant than in benign tissue, and NADT was associated with decreased FASN staining in both benign and malignant tissue. The relationships of FASN SNPs and staining intensity with outcome were less clear. One SNP, rs4246444, showed a weak association with outcome. FASN staining intensity also showed a weak and seemingly contradictory relationship with outcome.

Knockdown of Yes in PC3 Mig-3 cells decreased migration and decreased lymph node metastasis following orthotopic implantation of into nude mice. In human specimens, Yes expression was increased in lymph node metastases relative to paired primary tumors from the same patient, and increased pFAK Y861 expression in lymph node metastases correlated with poor prognosis.

Materials and methods:   In this retrospective, single-institutional study, 55 patients (age, 67.5 Â± 6.9 years; range, 52-84 years) who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before transperineal magnetic resonance/transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy were included. Suspicious lesions identified in multiparametric MRI underwent image-guided targeted biopsy procedure using a hybrid magnetic resonance/transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy system. Multiparametric MRI examinations were performed at 3.0 T using a 16-channel phased array coil. Diffusion kurtosis imaging has been acquired with 9 b values (0, 50, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, and 2000 s/mm). In patients with histologically proven PCa, a representative tumor region was determined as region of interest (ROI) on axial T2-weighted images in consensus by 2 board-certified radiologists. For quantitative evaluation, ROIs located in malignant and contralateral tumor-free regions were transferred to diffusion-weighted images. Diffusion kurtosis imaging parameters (Dapp and Kapp) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the ROIs in tumor and contralateral remote areas were calculated. Estimation of the kurtosis-derived parameters was performed using a voxel-by-voxel fit followed by an ROI-based averaging and a second fit to ROI-averaged signal values. A subgroup analysis was performed to determine the influence of aggressiveness of PCa using ADC, Dapp, and Kapp. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for DKI parameters and ADC values.  Results:   In the 55 patients, the average prostate-specific antigen level was 12.4 Â± 12.6 ng/mL (range, 2.7â75.0 ng/mL), and the median Gleason score was 7 (range, 6â10). Dapp (units, 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was significantly lower in tumor compared with control regions (1.48 Â± 0.35 vs 2.00 Â± 0.32, P < 0.05), and Kapp was significantly higher (1.01 Â± 0.21 vs 0.76 Â± 0.14, P < 0.05). Dapp was significantly higher than standard ADC (units, 10(-3) mm(2)/s) both in tumor regions and in controls (1.48 Â± 0.35 vs 1.10 Â± 0.25 and 2.00 Â± 0.32 vs 1.43 Â± 0.25, P < 0.05). Neither the ROI-based calculation of the kurtosis parameters nor the application of the noise correction significantly changed the DKI parameter estimation. There was no significant difference for the applied fitting method for DKI-derived parameters considering the differentiation between tumor and control tissue. Subsequent ROC analyses did not reveal a significant difference between DKI and ADC for detection of PCa. Sensitivities derived by Youden J statistics cutoff values ranged from 69% to 91% for DKI parameters; specificities ranged from 71% to 89%. Subgroup analysis for DKI (Dapp, Kapp) and ADC for assessing aggressiveness of PCa found significant difference (P < 0.05) for discrimination between high- and low-grade findings. However, no significant difference could be obtained between standard DWI- and DKI-derived parameters.  Conclusions:   The results of this study demonstrated no significant benefit of DKI for detection and grading of PCa as compared with standard ADC in the peripheral zone determined from b values of 0 and 800 s/mm. For clinical routine application, ADC derived from monoexponential fitting of DWI data remains the standard for characterizing peripheral zone cancer of the prostate.""","""['Matthias C Roethke', 'Tristan A Kuder', 'Timur H Kuru', 'Michael Fenchel', 'Boris A Hadaschik', 'Frederik B Laun', 'Heinz-Peter Schlemmer', 'Bram Stieltjes']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Combined With DWI at 3-T MRI for Detection and Assessment of Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer.', 'Feasibility of diffusional kurtosis tensor imaging in prostate MRI for the assessment of prostate cancer: preliminary results.', 'Diagnostic evaluation of magnetization transfer and diffusion kurtosis imaging for prostate cancer detection in a re-biopsy population.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Body diffusion kurtosis imaging: Basic principles, applications, and considerations for clinical practice.', 'Unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging of papillary thyroid carcinoma with emphasis on diffusion kurtosis imaging.', 'Evaluation of calculation processes of apparent diffusion coefficient subtraction method (ASM) imaging.', 'Comparison of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging and Standard Mono-Exponential Apparent Diffusion Coefficient in Diagnosis of Significant Prostate Cancer-A Correlation with Gleason Score Assessed on Whole-Mount Histopathology Specimens.', 'Truly reproducible uniform estimation of the ADC with\xa0multi-b diffusion data- Application in prostate diffusion imaging.', 'Emerging MR methods for improved diagnosis of prostate cancer by multiparametric MRI.']"""

Small, photocleavable reporter molecules with a defined mass called ""mass-tags"" are used for detection of immunocaptured proteins from human plasma. Using prostate specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker for prostate cancer, as a model antigen, a high sensitivity generic detection methodology based immunocapture with a primary antibody and with a biotin labeled secondary antibody coupled to mass-tagged avidin is demonstrated. As each secondary antibody can bind several avidin molecules, each having a large number of mass-tags, signal amplification can be achieved. The developed PSA sandwich mass-tag analysis method provided a limit of detection below 200 pg/mL (6 pM) for a 10 Î¼L plasma sample, well below the clinically relevant cutoff value of 3-4 ng/mL. This brings the limit of detection (LOD) for detection of intact antigens with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) down to levels comparable to capture by anti-peptide antibodies selected reaction monitoring (SISCAPA SRM) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as 6 pM corresponds to a maximal amount of 60 amol PSA captured on-spot.

Docetaxel treatment enhanced cytokine production by PC3Rx-U937 co-culture, while reducing cytokine levels in PC3-U937. In patients, changes in the levels of seven circulating cytokines (macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC1), interleukin (IL)-1ra, IL-1Î², IL-4, IL-6, IL-12 and IFNÎ³) after cycle 1 of docetaxel were associated with progressive disease (all P<0.05). The combination of changes in MIC1, IL-4 and IL-6 most strongly predicted PSA response (P=0.002).  Conclusions:   In vitro studies suggest docetaxel resistance is mediated, at least in part, by cytokines induced by the interaction between the docetaxel-resistant tumour cells and macrophages. Early changes in circulating cytokine levels were associated with docetaxel resistance in CRPC patients. When considered together, these data suggest a significant role for the inflammatory response and macrophages in the development of docetaxel resistance in CRPC.""","""['K L Mahon', 'H-M Lin', 'L Castillo', 'B Y Lee', 'M Lee-Ng', 'M D Chatfield', 'K Chiam', 'S N Breit', 'D A Brown', 'M P Molloy', 'G M Marx', 'N Pavlakis', 'M J Boyer', 'M R Stockler', 'R J Daly', 'S M Henshall', 'L G Horvath']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of testicular nuclear receptor 4 in chemo-resistance of docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cabazitaxel Remains Active in Patients Progressing After Docetaxel Followed by Novel Androgen Receptor Pathway Targeted Therapies.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The AhR is widely known as a mediator of dioxin toxicity; however, it also suppresses cancer cell proliferation and recent findings have implicated its role as a tumor suppressor. We conducted a chemical library screen to identify nontoxic AhR ligands with anti-cancer effects and discovered flutamide (Eulexin) as a putative AhR ligand. Flutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of prostate cancer. We found that flutamide inhibited the growth of several cancer cell lines independent of AR status, and that suppression of AhR expression reversed the anti-proliferative effects of flutamide. We investigated the AhR-dependent mechanism of action of flutamide in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and identified that transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1) is induced by flutamide in an AhR-dependent manner. In contrast, the potent AhR agonist 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin had no effect on TGF-Î²1 expression, indicating the ligand specificity of AhR activation. We also determined that TGF-Î²1 induction is required for the AhR-dependent growth inhibitory effects of flutamide. Therefore, flutamide may be effective in AhR-positive cancers that are sensitive to TGF-Î²1 signaling, such as hepatocellular carcinoma.""","""['D C Koch', 'H S Jang', ""E F O'Donnell"", 'S Punj', 'P R Kopparapu', 'W H Bisson', 'N I Kerkvliet', 'S K Kolluri']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Hexachlorobenzene modulates the crosstalk between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and transforming growth factor-Î²1 signaling, enhancing human breast cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Ligand-independent regulation of transforming growth factor beta1 expression and cell cycle progression by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.', 'TGF-Î²1 signaling plays a dominant role in the crosstalk between TGF-Î²1 and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand in prostate epithelial cells.', 'Ah receptor- and TCDD-mediated liver tumor promotion: clonal selection and expansion of cells evading growth arrest and apoptosis.', 'Ah receptor: dioxin-mediated toxic responses as hints to deregulated physiologic functions.', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor as an Anticancer Target: An Overview of Ten Years Odyssey.', 'Tumor-Suppressive Functions of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) and AhR as a Therapeutic Target in Cancer.', 'Dihydromyricetin Attenuates High-Intensity Exercise-Induced Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction Associated with the Modulation of the Phenotype of Intestinal Intraepithelial Lymphocytes.', 'Integrative pan-cancer landscape of MMS22L and its potential role in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Role of miR-653 and miR-29c in downregulation of CYP1A2 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

During bone development, Runx2 is activated by signals known to be hyperactive in PCa including the RAS/MAP kinase pathway, which phosphorylates Runx2 on multiple serine residues including S301 and S319 (equivalent to S294 and S312 in human Runx2). This study examines the role of these phosphorylation sites in PCa. Runx2 was preferentially expressed in more invasive PCa cell lines (PC3>C4-2B>LNCaP). Furthermore, analysis using a P-S319-Runx2-specific antibody revealed that the ratio of P-S319-Runx2/total Runx2 as well as P-ERK/total ERK was highest in PC3 followed by C4-2B and LNCaP cells. These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, which showed a higher percentage of PC3 cells staining positive for P-S319-Runx2 relative to C4-2B and LNCaP cells. Phosphorylated Runx2 had an exclusively nuclear localization. When expressed in prostate cell lines, wild-type Runx2 increased metastasis-associated gene expression, in vitro migratory and invasive activity as well as in vivo growth of tumor cell xenografts. In contrast, S301A/S319A phosphorylation site mutations greatly attenuated these Runx2 responses. Analysis of tissue microarrays from 129 patients revealed strong nuclear staining with the P-S319-Runx2 antibody in primary PCas and metastases. P-S319-Runx2 staining was positively correlated with Gleason score and occurrence of lymph node metastases while little or no Runx2 phosphorylation was seen in normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia or prostatitis indicating that Runx2 S319 phosphorylation is closely associated with PCa induction and progression towards an aggressive phenotype. These studies establish the importance of Runx2 phosphorylation in prostate tumor growth and highlight its value as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.""","""['C Ge', 'G Zhao', 'Y Li', 'H Li', 'X Zhao', 'G Pannone', 'P Bufo', 'A Santoro', 'F Sanguedolce', 'S Tortorella', 'M Mattoni', 'S Papagerakis', 'E T Keller', 'R T Franceschi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Runx2 transcriptome of prostate cancer cells: insights into invasiveness and bone metastasis.', 'MicroRNA-466 inhibits tumor growth and bone metastasis in prostate cancer by direct regulation of osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2.', 'Notch signaling and ERK activation are important for the osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer bone metastatic cell lines.', 'Metastatic bone disease: role of transcription factors and future targets.', 'Roles of highly expressed bone-specific genes in bone metastatic prostate cancer PC3 cells: Advances in studies.', 'RUNX Proteins as Epigenetic Modulators in Cancer.', 'Pan-cancer Landscape of the RUNX Protein Family Reveals their Potential as Carcinogenic Biomarkers and the Mechanisms Underlying their Action.', 'Post-translational modifications on the retinoblastoma protein.', 'RUNX2 recruits the NuRD(MTA1)/CRL4B complex to promote breast cancer progression and bone metastasis.', 'Autophagy provides a conceptual therapeutic framework for bone metastasis from prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   DU145 cells were treated with various concentrations of Celastrol (0.25-16.0 Î¼mol/L) for 0-72 hours. MTT assay was used to evaluate the inhibition effect of Celastrol on the growth of DU145 cells. Cell apoptosis was detected through both Annexin-V FITC/PI double-labeled cytometry and Hoechst 33258. Cell cycle regulation was examined by a propidium iodide method. Western blot and RT-PCR technologies were applied to assess the expression level of hERG in DU145 cells.  Results:   Celastrol presented striking growth inhibition and apoptosis induction potency on DU145 cells in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IC50 value of Celastrol for 24 hours was 2.349 Â± 0.213 Î¼mol/L. Moreover, Celastrol induced DU145 cell apoptosis in a cell cycle-dependent manner, which means Celastrol could arrest DU145 cells in G0/G1 phase; accordingly, cells in S phase decreased gradually and no obvious changes were found in G2/M phase cells. Through transmission electron microscope, apoptotic bodies containing nuclear fragments were found in Celastrol-treated DU145 cells. Overexpression of hERG channel was found in DU145 cells, while Celastrol could downregulate it at both protein and mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01).

While SOD2 downregulation was initially associated with tumor initiation and was proposed as a tumor suppressor gene, recent studies have reported that SOD2 might favor tumor progression and dissemination. To our knowledge this is the first time that changes in SOD2 expression in three different types of tumors, i.e., prostate, lung, and colon cancer, are studied by analyzing both SOD2 mRNA and protein levels in a total of 246 patients' samples. In prostate samples, SOD2 protein levels were also increased, especially in middle stage tumors. In the case of colon and lung tumors both mRNA and protein SOD2 levels were increased in malignant tissues compared to those in nontumor samples. More importantly, all metastases analyzed showed increased levels of SOD2 when compared to those of normal primary tissue and healthy adjacent tissue. Together, these results suggest that a common redox imbalance in these three types of tumor occurs at intermediate stages which then might favor migration and invasion, leading to a more aggressive cancer type.

Finally, our studies demonstrate that treating cells with both miR-148a and either cisplatin or doxorubicin is either additive or synergistic in causing apoptosis.

Empirical correlations among them have been published for different cancers, but statistical models describing the dependence structures are limited. Recently, Fleischer et al. proposed a statistical model that is mathematically tractable and shows some flexibility to describe the dependencies in a realistic way, based on the assumption of exponential distributions. This paper aims to extend their model to the more flexible Weibull distribution. We derived theoretical correlations among different survival outcomes, as well as the distribution of overall survival induced by the model. Model parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood method and the goodness of fit was assessed by plotting estimated versus observed survival curves for overall survival. We applied the method to three cancer clinical trials.

Methods:   Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to detect autoantibodies to PARP1 and BRCA1/BRCA2 in 618 serum samples including 131 from breast cancer, 94 from lung cancer, 34 from ovarian cancer, 107 from prostate cancer, 76 from liver cancer, 41 from pancreatic cancer and 135 from normal individuals. The positive sera with ELISA were confirmed by Western blot. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of PARP1 and BRCA1/BRCA2 in breast cancer.  Results:   Autoantibody frequency to PARP1, BRCA1, and BRCA2 in cancer varied from 0% to 50%. When the sera from cancer patients were tested for the presence of autoantibodies to PARP1 and BRCA1/BRCA2, the autoantibody responses slightly decreased and the positive autoantibody reactions varied from 0% to 50.0%. This was significantly higher autoantibody responses to PARP1 and BRCA1/BRCA2 (especially to PARP1 and BRCA1) in ovarian cancer and breast cancer compared to normal control sera (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01). Immunohistochemistry indicated that Pathology Grade at diagnosis to PARP1 expression in breast cancer was different (P < 0.05).

Nevertheless, recurrence patterns of LN-positive PCa and their prognostic significance remain understudied in the literature.  Objective:   To analyze a large single-institution series with long-term follow-up to elucidate the various clinical recurrence patterns of LN-positive PCa and their association with oncologic outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   Years 1987-2012 of a prospectively maintained institutional RP registry were queried for men with LN-positive PCa at RP. Clinical recurrences were categorized as local, nodal, skeletal, or visceral.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   In addition to descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier analysis, univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to predict recurrence and to quantify the impact of recurrence patterns on cancer-specific mortality (CSM).  Results and limitations:   Data from 1011 men with LN-positive PCa at RP were analyzed with 17.6 yr of median follow-up. The 15-yr clinical recurrence rate was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31-35%) for all patients and 52.2% (95% CI, 47.3-57.1%) for patients with biochemical recurrence. The solitary locations were skeletal (n=94, 55%), nodal (n=59, 34%), local soft tissue (n=29, 17%), and visceral (n=8, 5%). Significant multivariable predictors of recurrence were Gleason score 8-10, number of positive nodes, pathologic Gleason score, and more recent year of surgery. The 15-yr CSM after clinical recurrence was 80%, with a mean overall survival of 30 mo after recurrence. On multivariable analysis, recurrences after 5 yr from RP (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.05), multiple recurrences (HR: 1.97), skeletal (HR: 3.13), and visceral metastases (HR: 7.43) were independently associated with CSM (all p<0.05).  Conclusions:   Recurrences after RP for LN-positive PCa are heterogeneous in terms of time from RP, location, and number of concomitant lesions.  Patient summary:   We found that impact of recurrence patterns on cancer-specific mortality varies significantly and allows these patients to be stratified for purposes of prognostication, follow-up, and therapy.""","""['Marco Moschini', 'Vidit Sharma', 'Fabio Zattoni', 'J Fernando Quevedo', 'Brian J Davis', 'Eugene Kwon', 'R Jeffrey Karnes']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'More extensive pelvic lymph node dissection improves survival in patients with node-positive prostate cancer.', 'The role of radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection in lymph node-positive prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Contemporary role of salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate Cancer Morphologies: Cribriform Pattern and Intraductal Carcinoma Relations to Adverse Pathological and Clinical Outcomes-Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Liver Microenvironment Response to Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Hormonal Therapy.', 'Defining Prostatic Vascular Pedicle Recurrence and the Anatomy of Local Recurrence of Prostate Cancer on Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography.', 'Current Status and Future Perspective on the Management of Lymph Node-Positive Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Clinical outcomes of salvage treatment in lymph node-positive prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.']"""

However, selected Notch pathway members are overrepresented in high-grade prostate cancers. We comprehensively profiled Notch pathway components in prostate cells and found prostate cancer-specific up-regulation of NOTCH3 and HES6. Their expression was particularly high in androgen responsive lines. Up- and down-regulating Notch in these cells modulated expression of canonical Notch targets, HES1 and HEY1, which could also be induced by androgen. Surprisingly, androgen treatment also suppressed Notch receptor expression, suggesting that androgens can activate Notch target genes in a receptor-independent manner. Using a Notch-sensitive Recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ) reporter assay, we found that basal levels of Notch signalling were significantly lower in prostate cancer cells compared to benign cells. Accordingly pharmacological Notch pathway blockade did not inhibit cancer cell growth or viability. In contrast to canonical Notch targets, HES6, a HES family member known to antagonize Notch signalling, was not regulated by Notch signalling, but relied instead on androgen levels, both in cultured cells and in human cancer tissues. When engineered into prostate cancer cells, reduced levels of HES6 resulted in reduced cancer cell invasion and clonogenic growth. By molecular profiling, we identified potential roles for HES6 in regulating hedgehog signalling, apoptosis and cell migration. Our results did not reveal any cell-autonomous roles for canonical Notch signalling in prostate cancer.

To comprehensively identify DNA methylation alterations in PCa disparity, we used the Illumina 450K methylation platform to interrogate the methylation status of 485,577 CpG sites focusing on gene-associated regions of the human genome. Genomic DNA from African-American (AA; 7 normal and 3 cancers) and Caucasian (Cau; 8 normal and 3 cancers) was used in the analysis. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified probe-sets unique to AA and Cau samples, as well as common to both. We selected 25 promoter-associated novel CpG sites most differentially methylated by race (fold change > 1.5-fold; adjusted P < 0.05) and compared the Î²-value of these sites provided by the Illumina, Inc. array with quantitative methylation obtained by pyrosequencing in 7 prostate cell lines. We found very good concordance of the methylation levels between Î²-value and pyrosequencing. Gene expression analysis using qRT-PCR in a subset of 8 genes after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin showed up-regulation of gene expression in PCa cells. Quantitative analysis of 4 genes, SNRPN, SHANK2, MST1R, and ABCG5, in matched normal and PCa tissues derived from AA and Cau PCa patients demonstrated differential promoter methylation and concomitant differences in mRNA expression in prostate tissues from AA vs. Cau. Regression analysis in normal and PCa tissues as a function of race showed significantly higher methylation prevalence for SNRPN (P = 0.012), MST1R (P = 0.038), and ABCG5 (P < 0.0002) for AA vs. Cau samples. We selected the ABCG5 and SNRPN genes and verified their biological functions by Western blot analysis and siRNA gene knockout effects on cell proliferation and invasion in 4 PCa cell lines (2 AA and 2 Cau patients-derived lines). Knockdown of either ABCG5 or SNRPN resulted in a significant decrease in both invasion and proliferation in Cau PCa cell lines but we did not observe these remarkable loss-of-function effects in AA PCa cell lines.

Purpose of the present work is to compare two Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) modelling approaches for prediction of late radio-induced GI toxicity after prostate external beam radiotherapy.  Methods:   The study includes 84 prostate cancer patients evaluated for late rectal toxicity after 3D conformal radiotherapy. Median age was 72 years (range 53-85). All patients received a total dose of 76 Gy to the prostate gland with daily fractions of 2 Gy. The acute and late radio-induced GI complications were classified according to the RTOG/EORTC scoring system. Rectum dose-volume histograms were extracted for Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) NTCP model fitting using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The bootstrap method was employed to test the fit robustness. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive power of the LKB and to compare it with a multivariate logistic NTCP model previously determined.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 36 months, 42% (35/84) of patients experienced grade 1-2 (G1-2) acute GI events while 25% (21/84) of patients developed G1-2 late GI events. The best-estimate of fitting parameters for LKB NTCP model for mild\moderate GI toxicity resulted to be: D 50 = 87.3 Gy, m = 0.37 and n = 0.10. Bootstrap result showed that the parameter fit was robust. The AUC values for the LKB and for the multivariate logistic models were 0.60 and 0.75, respectively.

Herein, we describe the incidence and severity of hematuria following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer at our institution.  Methods:   Two hundred and eight consecutive patients with prostate cancer treated with SBRT monotherapy with at least three years of follow-up were included in this retrospective analysis. Treatment was delivered using the CyberKnifeÂ® (Accuray) to doses of 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. Toxicities were scored using the CTCAE v.4. Hematuria was counted at the highest grade it occurred in the acute and late setting for each patient. Cystoscopy findings were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Hematuria-associated bother was assessed via the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC)-26.  Results:   The median age was 69 years with a median prostate volume of 39 cc. With a median follow-up of 48 months, 38 patients (18.3%) experienced at least one episode of hematuria. Median time to hematuria was 13.5 months. In the late period, there were three grade 3 events and five grade 2 events. There were no grade 4 or 5 events. The 3-year actuarial incidence of late hematuria â¥ grade 2 was 2.4%. On univariate analysis, prostate volume (p = 0.022) and history of prior procedure(s) for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with hematuria. On multivariate analysis, history of prior procedure(s) for BPH (p < 0.0001) and Î±1A antagonist use (p = 0.008) were significantly associated with the development of hematuria.  Conclusions:   SBRT for prostate cancer was well tolerated with hematuria rates comparable to other radiation modalities.

Published literature suggests low rates of serious infection following this procedure of 0-1.3%, but this may be an underestimate. We aim to report on the infection incidence and severity associated with the use of transrectally implanted intraprostatic gold FM.  Methods:   Three hundred and fifty-nine patients who underwent transrectal FM insertion between January 2012 and December 2013 were assessed retrospectively via a self-reported questionnaire. All had standard oral fluoroquinolone antibiotic prophylaxis. The patients were asked about infective symptoms and the treatment received including antibiotics and/or related hospital admissions. Potential infective events were confirmed through medical records.  Results:   285 patients (79.4%) completed the questionnaire. 77 (27.0%) patients experienced increased urinary frequency and dysuria, and 33 patients (11.6%) reported episodes of chills and fevers after the procedure. 22 patients (7.7%) reported receiving antibiotics for urinary infection and eight patients (2.8%) reported hospital admission for urosepsis related to the procedure.  Conclusion:   The overall rate of symptomatic infection with FM implantation in this study is 7.7%, with one third requiring hospital admission. This exceeds the reported rates in other FM implantation series, but is in keeping with the larger prostate biopsy literature. Given the higher than expected complication rate, a risk-adaptive approach may be helpful.

Methods:   Twenty prostate and twenty head and neck VMAT plans were retrospectively selected. Fluences of VMAT plans were generated by integration of monitor units shaped by multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) at each control point. When generating fluences, the values of pixels representing MLC tips were doubled to prevent smearing out of small or irregular fields (edge-enhancement). Six kinds of textural features, including angular second moment, inverse difference moment, contrast, variance, correlation and entropy, were calculated with particular displacement distances (d) of 1, 5 and 10. Plan delivery accuracy was evaluated by gamma-index method, mechanical parameter differences between plan and delivery and differences in dose-volumetric parameters between plan and delivery. Spearman's correlation coefficients (r s ) were calculated between the values of textural features and VMAT delivery accuracy.  Results:   The r s values of contrast (d = 1) with edge-enhancement to global gamma passing rates with 2%/2 mm, 1%/2 mm and 2%/1 mm were 0.546 (p < 0.001), 0.744 (p < 0.001) and 0.487 (p = 0.001), respectively.

As such, it is presently recognized as an important risk factor for several types of cancers such as bladder, prostate and breast cancers. The discovery of novel anti-inflammatory compounds can have a huge implication not only for the treatment of cancer but also as preventive and protective treatment modalities. We have recently identified a new compound (1) that presents interesting anti-inflammatory activity. In order to better understand its biological action, we have divided the molecule in its basic components and verified their respective contribution towards the anti-inflammatory response of the whole molecule. We have discovered that only the combination of the maleimide function together with the tert-butyloxycarbonylhydrazinamide function lead to important anti-inflammatory properties. The main derivative 1 can decrease the activating effects of INFÎ³ or IL6 on human (hMÏs) macrophages by 38% or by 64% at a concentration of 10 Î¼M as indicated by a decrease of STAT1 or STAT3 activation. The expression of pro-inflammatory markers CD40 and MHCII in INFÎ³ stimulated hMÏs were reduced by 87% and 49%, respectively with a 3 h pretreatment of 1 at 10 Î¼M. The cell motility assay revealed that 1 at 10 Î¼M can reduce relative cell motility induced by IL6 by 92% in comparison with the untreated control hMÏ monolayers. Compound 1 reduced by 91% the inflammatory response induced by the cytokines (INFÎ³ + TNFÎ±) in the macrophage-like J774A.1 cells at a concentration of 25 Î¼M, as measured by the detection of NO production with the Griess reagent. Furthermore, upon removal of the tert-butyloxycarbonyl protective group the unprotected derivative as a hydrochloride salt (1A) retains interesting anti-inflammatory activity and was found to be less toxic than the parent compound (1).""","""['Jovane Hamelin-Morrissette', 'Suzie Cloutier', 'Julie Girouard', 'Denise Belgorosky', 'Ana MarÃ­a EijÃ¡n', 'Jean Legault', 'Carlos Reyes-Moreno', 'Gervais BÃ©rubÃ©']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Synthesis, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activity of novel 2-substituted isoflavenes.', 'Synthesis and anti-inflammatory activity of celecoxib like compounds.', 'Efficient synthesis of (-)- and (+)-tricyclic compounds with enone functionalities in rings A and C.

Methods:   We measured central axis doses with film in a phantom containing an air cavity, and compared measurements with calculations of the AAA and AXB. For clinical study, 10 patients who had undergone whole pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) followed by prostatic bed-only radiotherapy (PBRT) using VMAT were enrolled. An ERB was used for PBRT but not for WPRT. To compare dosimetric parameters, the cumulative dose-volume histograms, mean, maximum, and minimum doses were measured for the planning target volume. Homogeneity of plans were confirmed using V95%, V107% (VX%, percentage volumes receiving at least X% of prescribed doses) and conformity indices (homogeneity index [HI], conformity index [CI], and conformation number [CN]). We compared volumes of the organ-at-risk receiving 10% to 100% (10-tier at 10% interval) of prescribed doses (V10% - V100%).  Results:   In the phantom study, the AAA showed larger disagreement with the measurements, and overestimated the dose in the air cavity, comparing with the AXB. For WPRT planning, the AAA predicted a lower maximum dose and V107% than the AXB. For PBRT planning, the AAA estimated a higher minimum dose, lower maximum dose, and smaller V107%, and larger V95% than the AXB. Regarding the conformity indices, the AAA was estimated to be more homogenous than the AXB for PBRT planning (HI, 0.088 vs. 0.120, p = 0.005; CI, 1.052 vs. 1.038, p = 0.022; and CN, 0.920 vs. 0.900, p = 0.007) but not for WPRT planning. Among V10% to V100% of the rectum, the PBRT exhibited significant discrepancies in V30%, V40%, V70%, V80%, and V90%; while the WPRT did in V20% and V30%.  Conclusions:   The phantom study demonstrated that the AXB calculates more accurately in the air cavity than the AAA. In the clinical setting, the AXB exhibited different dosimetric distributions in the VMAT plans for PBRT containing an ERB.

Methods:   The prostate positioning of 6 patients, with fiducial markers implanted into the prostate, was controlled by 3DUS and CBCT. In total, 78 ultrasound scans were performed trans-abdominally and compared to bone-matches and seed-matches in CBCT scans. Setup errors detected by the different modalities were compared. Systematic and random errors were analysed, and optimal setup margins were calculated.  Results:   The discrepancy between 3DUS and seed-match in CBCT was -0.2 Â± 2.7 mm laterally, -1.9 Â± 2.3 mm longitudinally and 0.0 Â± 3.0 mm vertically and significant only in longitudinal direction. Using seed-match as reference, systematic errors of 3DUS were 1.3 mm laterally, 0.8 mm longitudinally and 1.4 mm vertically, and random errors were 2.5 mm laterally, 2.3 mm longitudinally, and 2.7 mm vertically. No significant difference could be detected for 3DUS in comparison to bone-match in CBCT.  Conclusions:   3DUS is feasible for image guidance for patients with prostate cancer and appears comparable to CBCT based image guidance in the retrospective study.

The ribosomal P proteins (P0, P1, P2) play an important role in protein synthesis and tumor formation. The immunogenicity of the ribosomal P0 protein in head and neck, in breast and prostate cancer patients and the overexpression of the carboxyl-terminal P0 epitope (C-22 P0) in some tumors were reported.  Methods:   Sera from 72 colorectal tumor patients (67 malignant and 5 benign tumors) were compared with 73 healthy donor sera for the presence of antibodies to CEA, EGFR, ErbB2 and ribosomal P proteins by western blotting or ELISA. Expression of the C-22 P0 epitope on tissues and colon cancer cells was determined by immunoperoxidase staining and indirect immunofluorescence/western blotting, respectively, employing MAb 2B2. Biological effects of MAb 2B2 on colon cancer cells were assessed by the Sulforhodamine B cell proliferation assay, trypan blue exclusion test and cleaved caspase-3 detection. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of auto-antibodies positive patients with healthy donors. Variation in the C-22 P0 expression, and in the number of apoptotic cells was evaluated by Student's t-test. Variation in cell survival and cell death was evaluated by Newman-Keuls test.  Results:   No significant humoral response was observed to CEA, EGFR and ErbB2 in CRC patients. Conversely, 7 out of 67 CRC patient sera reacted to ribosomal P proteins. The prevalence of P proteins auto-antibodies in CRC patients was significant. Five patients showed restricted P0 immunoreactivity, while two patients reacted simultaneously to all P proteins. The C-22 P0 epitope was homogenously expressed both in malignant tumors and the adjacent mucosa, but the intensity of expression was higher in the tumor. Starved colon cancer cells showed a higher C-22 P0 epitope plasma membrane expression compared to control cells. MAb 2B2 inhibited colon cancer cell growth and induced cell death in a dose dependent manner.  Conclusions:   Our study shows a spontaneous humoral immune response to ribosomal P0 protein in CRC patients and the inhibition of in vitro cancer cell growth after C-22 P0 epitope targeting.

A panel of four kallikrein immunoassays has been reported to improve the prediction of prostate biopsy outcome (cancer vs benign) in men with elevated PSA in the circulation. Assay of one of the kallikrein forms, intact free PSA (fPSA-I), is based on a unique monoclonal antibody (4D4), which is specific for PSA without the internal cleavage at Lys(145)-Lys(146). Due to high dissociation rate the 4D4 antibody is less than optimal for achieving a highly sensitive robust assay. In this study, we cloned the 4D4 Mab into a recombinant fragment (Fab) format and constructed three mutant libraries with the aim to increase its binding affinity. The libraries contained targeted mutations either in the CDR-H1, CDR-H2 or CDR-L3 region. PSA-I specific antibodies were enriched from the libraries by phage display technology. We identified fourteen unique clones with 1-5 mutated amino acids showing reduced dissociation of the PSA conjugate compared to the wt-4D4 Fab. Five of these mutant antibodies had 2-6 times higher binding affinity compared to the wt-4D4 Fab yet retaining the original specificity for PSA-I. The analytical sensitivity of fPSA-I assay with mutant L3-2 Fab was 0.12 Î¼g/L compared to 4.46 Î¼g/L with the original wt-4D4 Fab. In the method comparison study, the developed assay showed an excellent correlation to the existing fPSA-I assay.

The demonstration of ERG oncoprotein overexpression due to gene fusion in CaP has thus provided ERG as an additional biomarker. Based on this, we hypothesized that ERG protein quantification methods can be of use in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Methods:   An antibody-free assay for ERG3 protein detection was developed based on PRISM (high-pressure high-resolution separations with intelligent selection and multiplexing)-SRM (selected reaction monitoring) mass spectrometry. We utilized TMPRSS2-ERG positive VCaP and TMPRSS2-ERG negative LNCaP cells to simulate three different sample types (cells, tissue, and post-DRE urine sediment). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot, NanoString, and qRT-PCR were also used in the analysis of these samples.  Results:   Recombinant ERG3 protein spiked into LNCaP cell lysates could be detected at levels as low as 20 pg by PRISM-SRM analysis. The sensitivity of the PRISM-SRM assay was approximately 10,000 VCaP cells in a mixed cell population model of VCaP and LNCaP cells. Interestingly, ERG protein could be detected in as few as 600 VCaP cells spiked into female urine. The sensitivity of the in-house ELISA was similar to the PRISM-SRM assay, with detection of 30 pg of purified recombinant ERG3 protein and 10,000 VCaP cells. On the other hand, qRT-PCR exhibited a higher sensitivity, as TMPRSS2-ERG transcripts were detected in as few as 100 VCaP cells, in comparison to NanoString methodologies which detected ERG from 10,000 cells.  Conclusions:   Based on this data, we propose that the detection of both ERG transcriptional products with RNA-based assays, as well as protein products of ERG using PRISM-SRM assays, may be of clinical value in developing diagnostic and prognostic assays for prostate cancer given their sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.""","""['Jintang He', 'Athena A Schepmoes', 'Tujin Shi', 'Chaochao Wu', 'Thomas L Fillmore', 'Yuqian Gao', 'Richard D Smith', 'Wei-Jun Qian', 'Karin D Rodland', 'Tao Liu', 'David G Camp nd', 'Anshu Rastogi', 'Shyh-Han Tan', 'Wusheng Yan', 'Ahmed A Mohamed', 'Wei Huang', 'Sreedatta Banerjee', 'Jacob Kagan', 'Sudhir Srivastava', 'David G McLeod', 'Shiv Srivastava', 'Gyorgy Petrovics', 'Albert Dobi', 'Alagarsamy Srinivasan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Antibody-independent targeted quantification of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion protein products in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer marker panel with single cell sensitivity in urine.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcript integrated with PCA3 score, genotyping, and biological features are correlated to the results of prostatic biopsies in men at risk of prostate cancer.', 'ERG protein expression as a biomarker of prostate cancer.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.', 'Carrier-assisted One-pot Sample Preparation for Targeted Proteomics Analysis of Small Numbers of Human Cells.', 'Carrier-Assisted Single-Tube Processing Approach for Targeted Proteomics Analysis of Low Numbers of Mammalian Cells.', 'Facile carrier-assisted targeted mass spectrometric approach for proteomic analysis of low numbers of mammalian cells.', 'Nondestructive Analysis of Tumor-Associated Membrane Protein Integrating Imaging and Amplified Detection in situ Based on Dual-Labeled DNAzyme.', 'Multiplexed targeted mass spectrometry assays for prostate cancer-associated urinary proteins.']"""

The objectives were a) to understand men's experiences of biopsy as compared to their expectations; and b) to propose current evidence-based information for men undergoing TRUS-Bx.  Methods:   Between February 2006 and May 2008, 1,147 men undergoing a standardised 10-core transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy protocol under antibiotic cover following a PSA 3.0-19.9 ng/ml in the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial, completed questionnaires about biopsy symptoms. In this embedded qualitative study, in-depth interviews were undertaken with 85 men (mean age 63.6 yrs, mean PSA 4.5 ng/ml) to explore men's experiences of prostate biopsy and how the experience might be improved. Interview data were analysed thematically using qualitative research methods. Findings from the qualitative study were used to guide selection of key findings from the questionnaire study in developing a patient information leaflet preparing men for biopsy.  Results:   Although most men tolerated TRUS-Bx, a quarter reported problematic side-effects and anxiety. Side effects were perceived as problematic and anxiety arose most commonly when experiences deviated from information provided. Men who were unprepared for elements of TRUS-Bx procedure or its sequelae responded by contacting health professionals for reassurance and voiced frustration that pre-biopsy information had understated the possible severity or duration of pain/discomfort and bleeding. Findings from questionnaire and interview data were combined to propose a comprehensive, evidence-based patient information leaflet for TRUS-Bx.  Conclusions:   Men reported anxiety associated with TRUS-Bx or its side-effects most commonly if they felt inadequately prepared for the procedure.

This project was carried out to determine (i) whether enhanced GNA13 expression is important for breast cancer cell invasion, and (ii) if so, the mechanism of deregulation of GNA13 expression in breast cancers.  Methods:   To determine the probable miRNAs regulating GNA13, online miRNA target prediction tool Targetscan and Luciferase assays with GNA13-3'-UTR were used. Effect of miRNAs on GNA13 mRNA, protein and invasion was studied using RT-PCR, western blotting and in vitro Boyden chamber assay respectively. Cell proliferation was done using MTT assays.  Results:   Overexpression of GNA13 in MCF-10a cells induced invasion, whereas knockdown of GNA13 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited invasion. Expression analysis of miRNAs predicted to bind the 3'-UTR of GNA13 revealed that miR-31 exhibited an inverse correlation to GNA13 protein expression in breast cancer cells. Ectopic expression of miR-31 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced GNA13 mRNA and protein levels, as well as GNA13-3'-UTR-reporter activity. Conversely, blocking miR-31 activity in MCF-10a cells induced GNA13 mRNA, protein and 3'-UTR reporter activity. Further, expression of miR-31 significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell invasion, and this effect was partly rescued by ectopic expression of GNA13 in these cells. Examination of 48 human breast cancer tissues revealed that GNA13 mRNA levels were inversely correlated to miR-31 levels.  Conclusions:   These data provide strong evidence that GNA13 expression in breast cancer cells is regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms involving miR-31. Additionally our data shows that miR-31 regulates breast cancer cell invasion partially via targeting GNA13 expression in breast cancer cells. Loss of miR-31 expression and increased GNA13 expression could be used as biomarkers of breast cancer progression.""","""['Suhail Ahmed Kabeer Rasheed', 'Cui Rong Teo', 'Emmanuel Jean Beillard', 'P Mathijs Voorhoeve', 'Wei Zhou', 'Sujoy Ghosh', 'Patrick J Casey']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['MicroRNA-340 inhibits the migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells by targeting Wnt pathway.', 'miR-96 promotes tumor proliferation and invasion by targeting RECK in breast cancer.', 'miR-381 inhibited breast cancer cells proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis by targeting CXCR4.', 'Targeting miR-205 in breast cancer.', 'Regulation of microRNA-1 (miR-1) expression in human cancer.', 'Role of MicroRNA-31 (miR-31) in Breast Carcinoma Diagnosis and Prognosis.', 'GÎ±12 and GÎ±13: Versatility in Physiology and Pathology.', 'The emerging roles of GÎ±12/13 proteins on the hallmarks of cancer in solid tumors.', 'Co-receptor signaling in the pathogenesis of neuroHIV.', 'MicroRNAs: The Link between the Metabolic Syndrome and Oncogenesis.']"""

Because high-grade PCa tends to exhibit increased glycolytic rate, FDG-PET/CT could be useful in this setting. The aim of this study was to assess the value of FDG-PET/CT for pre-operative staging and prognostic stratification of patients with high-grade PCa at biopsy.  Methods:   Fifty-four patients with a Gleason sumâ¥8 PCa at biopsy underwent FDG-PET/CT as part of the staging workup. Thirty-nine patients underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and pelvic lymph node (LN) dissection, 2 underwent LN dissection only, and 13 underwent non-surgical treatments. FDG-PET/CT findings from clinical reports, blinded reading and quantitative analysis were correlated with clinico-pathological characteristics at RP.  Results:   Suspicious foci of increased FDG uptake were found in the prostate, LNs and bones in 44, 13 and 6% of patients, respectively. Higher clinical stage, post-RP Gleason sum and pattern, and percentage of cancer involvement within the prostate were significantly associated with the presence of intraprostatic FDG uptake (IPFU) (P<0.05 in all cases). Patients without IPFU who underwent RP were downgraded to Gleasonâ¤7 in 84.6% of cases, as compared to 30.8% when IPFU was reported (P=0.003). Qualitative and quantitative IPFU were significantly positively correlated with post-RP Gleason pattern and sum, and pathological T stage. Absence and presence of IPFU were associated with a median 5-year cancer-free survival probability of 70.2 and 26.9% (P=0.0097), respectively, using the CAPRA-S prognostic tool.

We have evaluated the clinical workflow of using open MRI as a sole modality for simulation and planning. Relevant results related to MRI alignment (vs. CT) reference dataset with Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) for daily localization are presented.  Methods:   Ten patients participated in an IRB approved study utilizing MRI along with CT simulation with the intent of evaluating the MRI-simulation process. Differences in prostate gland volume, seminal vesicles, and penile bulb were assessed with MRI and compared to CT. To evaluate dose calculation accuracy, bulk-density-assignments were mapped onto respective MRI datasets and treated IMRT plans were re-calculated. For image localization purposes, 400 CBCTs were re-evaluated with MRI as the reference dataset and daily shifts compared against CBCT-to-CT registration. Planning margins based on MRI/CBCT shifts were computed using the van Herk formalism.  Results:   Significant organ contour differences were noted between MRI and CT. Prostate volumes were on average 39.7% (p = 0.002) larger on CT than MRI. No significant difference was found in seminal vesicle volumes (p = 0.454). Penile bulb volumes were 61.1% higher on CT, without statistical significance (p = 0.074). MRI-based dose calculations with assigned bulk densities produced agreement within 1% with heterogeneity corrected CT calculations. The differences in shift positions for the cohort between CBCT-to-CT registration and CBCT-to-MRI registration are -0.15 Â± 0.25 cm (anterior-posterior), 0.05 Â± 0.19 cm (superior-inferior), and -0.01 Â± 0.14 cm (left-right).

Numerous epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between the CCND1 A870G polymorphism and the risk of prostate cancer (PCa). However, these studies have yielded conflicting results.  Methods:   In the present study, the possible association above was assessed by a meta-analysis. Eligible articles were identified for the period up to July 2014. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were appropriately derived from fixed effects or random effects models.  Results:   A total of ten case-control studies, which included 3,820 cases and 3,825 controls, were identified.

However, PRL-activated intracellular signaling seems to be restricted to luminal cells, suggesting that basal/stem cells may not be direct targets of PRL. Given their described role as prostate cancer-initiating cells, it is important to understand the mechanisms that regulate basal/stem cells. In this study, we evaluated whether PRL can act directly on these cells, by growing them as prostaspheres. For this, primary 3D prostasphere cultures were prepared from unfractionated cells isolated from freshly harvested human and mouse benign prostate tissues and subjected to PRL stimulation in vitro. None of the various concentrations of PRL tested showed any effects on the sizes or numbers of the prostaspheres generated. In addition, neither activation of canonical PRL-induced signaling pathways (Stat5, Stat3 or Erk1/2) nor increased expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 were detected by immunostaining in PRL-stimulated prostaspheres. Consistent with the absence of response, PRL receptor mRNA levels were generally undetectable in mouse sphere cells. We conclude that human and mouse prostate basal/stem cells are not direct targets of PRL action. The observed amplification of basal/stem cells in Pb-PRL prostates might be due to paracrine mechanisms originating from PRL action on other cell compartments.

Mechanisms underlying radioresistance in various cancers are poorly understood and available radiosensitizers have shown only modest clinical benefit. There is thus a need to identify new targets and drugs for more effective sensitization of cancer cells to irradiation. Compound and RNA interference high-throughput screening technologies allow comprehensive enterprises to identify new agents and targets for radiosensitization. However, the gold standard assay to investigate radiosensitivity of cancer cells in vitro, the colony formation assay (CFA), is unsuitable for high-throughput screening.  Methods:   We developed a new high-throughput screening method for determining radiation susceptibility. Fast and uniform irradiation of batches up to 30 microplates was achieved using a Perspex container and a clinically employed linear accelerator. The readout was done by automated counting of fluorescently stained nuclei using the Acumen eX3 laser scanning cytometer. Assay performance was compared to that of the CFA and the CellTiter-Blue homogeneous uniform-well cell viability assay. The assay was validated in a whole-genome siRNA library screening setting using PC-3 prostate cancer cells.  Results:   On 4 different cancer cell lines, the automated cell counting assay produced radiation dose response curves that followed a linear-quadratic equation and that exhibited a better correlation to the results of the CFA than did the cell viability assay. Moreover, the cell counting assay could be used to detect radiosensitization by silencing DNA-PKcs or by adding caffeine. In a high-throughput screening setting, using 4 Gy irradiated and control PC-3 cells, the effects of DNA-PKcs siRNA and non-targeting control siRNA could be clearly discriminated.  Conclusions:   We developed a simple assay for radiation susceptibility that can be used for high-throughput screening.

The study used 2-photon microscopy to map the presence/distribution of fluorescently labeled, quiescent cells and luciferase expression to determine the presence of growing bone metastases. We showed that the mitotically quiescent cells were very significantly more tumorigenic in forming bone metastases than fast-growing cells (55 vs. 15%) and had a unique gene expression profile. The quiescent cells were not uniquely stem cell like, with no expression of CD133 but had the same level expression of other putative prostate stem cell markers (CD44 and integrins Î±2/Î²1), when compared to the rapidly proliferating population.

Reportedly, ACDase has been upregulated in prostate cancer. However, its regulatory mechanism remains unclear. LNCaP (androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line) but not PC3 and DU-145, (androgen-unresponsive cell lines) exhibited the highest ACDase protein. Among three cell lines, ASAH1 mRNA level was not correlated with ACDase protein expression, and the 5'-promoter activity did not show androgen dependency, suggesting the post-transcriptional regulation of ACDase in LNCaP cells. Based on these results, LNCaP was analysed further. Casodex, androgen receptor antagonist, and charcoal-stripped FCS (CS-FCS) decreased ACDase protein and activity, whereas dihydrotestosterone in CS-FCS culture increased ACDase protein and enzyme activity. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, prevented the decrease of ACDase protein when cultured in CS-FCS, suggesting the involvement of ubiquitin/proteasome system. Reportedly, USP2, a deubiquitinase, plays an important role in LNCaP cells. USP2 siRNA decreased ACDase protein, whereas USP2 overexpression increased ACDase protein of LNCaP cells. However, SKP2, an ubiquitin E3 ligase known to be active in prostate cancer, did not affect androgen-dependent ACDase expression in LNCaP cells.

Design:   A cross-sectional, postal survey of prostate cancer survivors sampled and recruited via two population-based cancer registries. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) evaluated patients for eligibility to participate. Questionnaires contained validated instruments to assess health-related quality of life and psychological well-being, including QLQ-C30, QLQ-PR25, EQ-5D-5L, 21-question Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Decisional Regret Scale.  Setting:   Republic of Ireland (RoI) and Northern Ireland (NI).  Primary outcome measures:   Registration completeness, predictors of eligibility and response, data missingness, unweighted and weighted PROMs.  Results:   Prostate cancer registration was 80% (95% CI 75% to 84%) and 91% (95% CI 89% to 93%) complete 2 years postdiagnosis in NI and RoI, respectively. Of 12,322 survivors sampled from registries, 53% (n=6559) were classified as eligible following HCP screening. In the multivariate analysis, significant predictors of eligibility were: being â¤59 years of age at diagnosis (p<0.001), short-term survivor (<5 years postdiagnosis; p<0.001) and from RoI (p<0.001). 3348 completed the questionnaire, yielding a 54% adjusted response rate. 13% of men or their families called the study freephone with queries for assistance with questionnaire completion or to talk about their experience. Significant predictors of response in multivariate analysis were: being â¤59 years at diagnosis (p<0.001) and from RoI (p=0.016). Mean number of missing questions in validated instruments ranged from 0.12 (SD 0.71; EQ-5D-5L) to 3.72 (SD 6.30; QLQ-PR25).

To re-evaluate for possible survival benefits in a larger contemporary sample and to demonstrate analytic uses of the newly available Project Data Sphere online resource, we used data from control arms of completed clinical trials to compare survival and toxicity among patients with postdocetaxel mCRPC treated with mitoxantrone and prednisone.  Patients and methods:   Control arm data from two phase III randomized control trials, SUN 1120 and TROPIC, were used to examine the efficacy of mitoxantrone plus prednisone (n = 305) versus prednisone alone (n = 257) among patients with postdocetaxel mCRPC. Propensity score matching was used to balance patient characteristics between the separate trials, conditioned on age and key prognostic variables of survival. The primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary endpoints evaluated safety.  Results:   Median survival was similar among patients receiving mitoxantrone plus prednisone versus prednisone alone (385 days vs. 336 days; deceleration factor = 0.04; 95% confidence interval: -0.12 to 0.22). Prevalence of several any-grade toxicity, including fatigue, back pain, and peripheral neuropathy, was increased among patients who received mitoxantrone.  Conclusion:   There was no significant survival benefit for mitoxantrone plus prednisone over prednisone alone among men with mCRPC after docetaxel therapy. This finding is consistent with prior studies showing no survival advantage with mitoxantrone in the predocetaxel setting.

We report the effect of enzalutamide on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), pain, and skeletal-related events observed during this trial.  Methods:   In this phase 3, double-blind trial, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive enzalutamide 160 mg/day (n=872) or placebo (n=845) orally. HRQoL was assessed at baseline and during treatment using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and EQ-5D questionnaires. Pain status was assessed at screening, baseline, week 13, and week 25 with the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF). The primary analysis of HRQoL data used a mixed-effects model to test the difference between least square means change from baseline at week 61. We assessed change from baseline, percentage improvement, and time to deterioration in HRQoL and pain, the proportion of patients with a skeletal-related event, and time to first skeletal-related event. Analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01212991.  Findings:   Median treatment duration was 16Â·6 months (IQR 10Â·1-21Â·1) in the enzalutamide group and 4Â·6 months (2Â·8-9Â·7) in the placebo group. The mixed-effects model analyses showed significant treatment differences in change from baseline to week 61 with enzalutamide compared with placebo for most FACT-P endpoints and EQ-5D visual analogue scale. Median time to deterioration in FACT-P total score was 11Â·3 months (95% CI 11Â·1-13Â·9) in the enzalutamide group and 5Â·6 months (5Â·5-5Â·6) in the placebo groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0Â·62 [95% CI 0Â·54-0Â·72]; p<0Â·0001). A significantly greater proportion of patients in the enzalutamide group than in the placebo group reported clinically meaningful improvements in FACT-P total score (327 [40%] of 826 vs 181 [23%] of 790), in EQ-5D utility index (224 [28%] of 812 vs 99 [16%] of 623), and visual analogue scale (218 [27%] of 803 vs 106 of [18%] 603; all p<0Â·0001). Median time to progression in BPI-SF pain at its worst was 5Â·7 months (95% CI 5Â·6-5Â·7) in the enzalutamide group and 5Â·6 months (5Â·4-5Â·6) in the placebo group (HR 0Â·62 [95% CI 0Â·53-0Â·74]; p<0Â·0001). Progression of pain at its worst was less common in the enzalutamide group than in the placebo group at week 13 (220 [29%] of 769 vs 257 [42%] of 610; p<0Â·0001), but not at week 25 (225 [32%] of 705 vs 135 [38%] of 360; p=0Â·068). 278 (32%) of 872 patients in the enzalutamide group and 309 (37%) of 845 patients in the placebo group had experienced a skeletal-related event by data cutoff. Median time to first skeletal-related events in the enzalutamide group was 31Â·1 months (95% CI 29Â·5-not reached) and 31Â·3 months (95% CI 23Â·9-not reached) in the placebo group (HR 0Â·72 [95% CI 0Â·61-0Â·84]; p<0Â·0001).

The sulfation pattern of HS influences signaling events mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) located on cell surface, which are critical for the interactions with growth factors and their receptors. Alterations in SULF2 expression have been identified in the context of several cancer types but its function in cancer is still unclear where the precise molecular mechanism involved has not been fully deciphered. To further investigate SULF2 role in tumorigenesis, we overexpressed such gene in prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods:   The normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 and the prostate cancer cells DU-145, and PC3 were transfected with SULF2-expressing plasmid pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(-)-Hsulf-2. Transfected cells were then submitted to viability, migration and colony formation assays.  Results:   Transfection of DU-145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells with SULF2 resulted in increased viability, which did not occur with normal prostate cells. The effect was reverted by the knockdown of SULF2 using specific siRNAs. Furthermore, forced expression of SULF2 augmented cell migration and colony formation in both prostate cell lines. Detailed structural analysis of HS from cells overexpressing SULF2 showed a reduction of the trisulfated disaccharide UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S). There was an increase in epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and an increase in WNT signaling pathway.

High risk patients, however, experience high relapse rates, so that research on radio-sensitization is the most evident route to improve curability of this common disease.  Materials and methods:   In the current study we investigated the autophagic activity in a series of patients with localized prostate tumors treated with radical radiotherapy, using the LC3A and the LAMP2a proteins as markers of autophagosome and lysosome cellular content, respectively. The role of autophagy on prostate cancer cell line resistance to radiation was also examined.  Results:   Using confocal microscopy on tissue biopsies, we showed that prostate cancer cells have, overall, high levels of LC3A and low levels of LAMP2a compared to normal prostate glands. Tumors with a 'highLC3A/lowLAMP2a' phenotype, suggestive of intensified lysosomal consumption, had a significantly poorer biochemical relapse free survival. The PC3 radioresistant cell line sustained remarkably its autophagic flux ability after radiation, while the DU145 radiosensitive one experiences a prolonged blockage of the autophagic process. This was assessed with aggresome accumulation detection and LC3A/LAMP2a double immunofluorescence, as well as with sequestrosome/p62 protein detection. By silencing the LC3A or LAMP2a expression, both cell lines became more sensitive to escalated doses of radiation.  Conclusions:   High base line autophagy activity and cell ability to sustain functional autophagy define resistance of prostate cancer cells to radiotherapy. This can be reversed by blocking up-regulated components of the autophagy pathway, which may prove of importance in the field of clinical radiotherapy.""","""['Michael I Koukourakis', 'Dimitra Kalamida', 'Achilleas Mitrakas', 'Stamatia Pouliliou', 'Sofia Kalamida', 'Efthimios Sivridis', 'Alexandra Giatromanolaki']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Characterization of the ""Autophagic Flux"" in Prostate Cancer Tissue Biopsies by LC3A/LAMP2a Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy.', 'Repression of the autophagic response sensitises lung cancer cells to radiation and chemotherapy.', 'Important role of autophagy in endothelial cell response to ionizing radiation.', 'The evolving role of external beam radiotherapy in localized prostate cancer.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'Silencing c-Jun inhibits autophagy and abrogates radioresistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.', 'A Key Pathway to Cancer Resilience: The Role of Autophagy in Glioblastomas.', 'Targeting Cytoprotective Autophagy to Enhance Anticancer Therapies.', 'A Potent Autophagy Inhibitor (Lys05) Enhances the Impact of Ionizing Radiation on Human Lung Cancer Cells H1299.', 'Autophagic flux response and glioblastoma sensitivity to radiation.']"""

In this setting, we sought to determine whether the case mix of BT monotherapy-treated men has changed over time in terms of risk group composition.  Methods and materials:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify 30,939 patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma between 2004 and 2011 who received BT monotherapy. The case mix of BT monotherapy patients was calculated by patient risk group and year of diagnosis.  Results:   Between 2004 and 2011, the use of BT monotherapy declined overall. The relative percentage of men undergoing BT with low-risk disease declined by 4.5%, whereas the relative percentage of patients with intermediate-risk disease increased by 4.7%. Non-white patients and those from poorer counties did not show shifts in the risk group makeup of BT monotherapy patients, whereas white patients and those from wealthier counties did.  Conclusions:   Although fewer patients with prostate cancer are undergoing BT monotherapy, men with intermediate-risk disease comprised a significantly larger portion of the BT case mix in 2011 compared with 2004.

Outcomes of continence, erectile function, cancer cure, positive surgical margins and complication are well collected in the pentafecta rate. However, no comparative studies between 4th generation 3D-HD vision system laparoscopy and standard bi-dimensional laparoscopy have been reported. This study aimed to compare the operative, perioperative data and pentafecta rates between 2D and 3D laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and to identify the actual role of 3D LRP in urology.  Methods:   From October 2012 to July 2013, 86 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer [PCa: age â¤ 70 years, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) â¤ 10 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason score â¤ 7] underwent laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy (LERP) and were followed for approximately 14 months (range 12-25). Patients were selected for inclusion via hospital record data, and divided into two groups. Their patient records were then analyzed. Patients were randomized into two groups: the former 2D-LERP (43 pts) operated with the use of 2D-HD camera; the latter 3D-LERP (43 pts) operated with the use of a 3D-HD 4th generation view system. The operative and perioperative data and the pentafecta rates between 2D-LERP and 3D-LERP were compared.  Results:   The overall pentafecta rates at 3 months were 47.4% and 49.6% in the 2D- and 3D-LERP group respectively. The pentafecta rate at 12 months was 62.7% and 67% for each group respectively. 4th generation 3D-HD vision system provides advantages over standard bi-dimensional view with regard to intraoperative steps. Our data suggest a trend of improvement in intraoperative blood loss and postoperative recovery of continence with the respect of the oncological safety.  Conclusions:   Use of the 3D technology by a single surgeon significantly enhances the possibility of achieving better intraoperative results and pentafecta in all patients undergoing LERP. Potency was the most difficult outcome to reach after surgery, and it was the main factor leading to pentafecta failure. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to better comprehend the role of 3D-LERP in modern urology.""","""['Pierluigi Bove', 'Valerio Iacovelli', 'Francesco Celestino', 'Francesco De Carlo', 'Giuseppe Vespasiani', 'Enrico Finazzi AgrÃ²']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Laparoscopic versus robot-assisted bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: comparison of pentafecta rates for a single surgeon.', 'Pentafecta: a new concept for reporting outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'A Randomized Controlled Study of Robot-Assisted versus 3D Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Carcinoma Prostate.', 'Description of the technique for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in canine cadavers: 2D vs. 3D camera.', 'Robotic Surgery Techniques to Improve Traditional Laparoscopy.', 'Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Radical Prostatectomy-a Contemporary Review.', 'Three-Dimensional (3D) Laparoscopy Versus Two-Dimensional (2D) Laparoscopy: A Single-Surgeon Prospective Randomized Comparative Study.']"""

However, the presence of prostate motion, patient positioning and range uncertainties may deteriorate target dose and increase exposure of organs at risk. Spacer gel injected between prostate and rectum may increase the safety of prostate cancer (PC) radiation therapy by separating the rectum from the target dose field. The dosimetric impact of the application of spacer gel for scanned carbon ion therapy of PC has been analyzed at Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT).  Materials and methods:   The robustness of ion therapy treatment plans was investigated by comparison of two data sets of patients treated with and without spacer gel. A research treatment planning system for ion therapy was used for treatment plan optimization and calculation of daily dose distributions on 2 to 9 Computed Tomography (CT) studies available for each of the 19 patients. Planning and daily dose distributions were analyzed with respect to target coverage, maximal dose to the rectum (excluding 1 ml of the greatest dose; Dmax-1 ml) and the rectal volume receiving dose greater than 90% of prescribed target dose (V90Rectum), respectively.  Results:   The application of spacer gel did substantially diminish rectum dose. Dmax-1 ml on the treatment planning CT was on average reduced from 100.0 Â± 1.0% to 90.2 Â± 4.8%, when spacer gel was applied. The robustness analysis performed with daily CT studies demonstrated for all analyzed patient cases that application of spacer gel results in a decrease of the daily V90Rectum index, which calculated over all patient cases and CT studies was 10.2 Â± 10.4 [ml] and 1.1 Â± 2.1 [ml] for patients without and with spacer gel, respectively.  Conclusions:   The dosimetric benefit of increasing the distance between prostate and rectum using spacer gel for PC treatment with carbon ion beams has been quantified. Application of spacer gel substantially reduced rectal exposure to high treatment dose and, therefore, can reduce the hazard of rectal toxicity in ion beam therapy of PC. The results of this study enable modifications of the PC ion therapy protocol such as dose escalation or hypofractionation.""","""['Antoni Rucinski', 'Stephan Brons', 'Daniel Richter', 'Gregor Habl', 'JÃ¼rgen Debus', 'Christoph Bert', 'Thomas Haberer', 'Oliver JÃ¤kel']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Intensity modulated proton and photon therapy for early prostate cancer with or without transperineal injection of a polyethylen glycol spacer: a treatment planning comparison study.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'A multi-institutional clinical trial of rectal dose reduction via injected polyethylene-glycol hydrogel during intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: analysis of dosimetric outcomes.', 'Rectal radiation dose-reduction techniques in prostate cancer: a focus on the rectal spacer.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'Optimizing 3DCT image registration for interfractional changes in carbon-ion prostate radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric comparison of robust angles in carbon-ion radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric Uncertainties in Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion Simultaneous Boost Using Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy.', 'Radiotherapy-Induced Digestive Injury: Diagnosis, Treatment and Mechanisms.', 'Towards real-time PGS range monitoring in proton therapy of prostate cancer.']"""

The molecular mechanisms by which this ephrin receptor influences cancer progression are complex as there are tumor-promoting ligand-independent mechanisms in place as well as ligand-dependent tumor suppressive pathways.  Methods:   We employed transient knockdown of EPHB4 in prostate cancer cells, coupled with gene microarray analysis, to identify genes that were regulated by EPHB4 and may represent linked tumor-promoting factors. We validated target genes using qRT-PCR and employed functional assays to determine their role in prostate cancer migration and invasion.  Results:   We discovered that over 500 genes were deregulated upon EPHB4 siRNA knockdown, with integrin Î²8 (ITGB8) being the top hit (29-fold down-regulated compared to negative non-silencing siRNA). Gene ontology analysis found that the process of cell adhesion was highly deregulated and two other integrin genes, ITGA3 and ITGA10, were also differentially expressed. In parallel, we also discovered that over-expression of EPHB4 led to a concomitant increase in ITGB8 expression. In silico analysis of a prostate cancer progression microarray publically available in the Oncomine database showed that both EPHB4 and ITGB8 are highly expressed in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, the precursor to prostate cancer. Knockdown of ITGB8 in PC-3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells in vitro resulted in significant reduction of cell migration and invasion.  Conclusions:   These results reveal that EphB4 regulates integrin Î²8 expression and that integrin Î²8 plays a hitherto unrecognized role in the motility of prostate cancer cells and thus targeting integrin Î²8 may be a new treatment strategy for prostate cancer.""","""['Inga Mertens-Walker', 'Bruno C Fernandini', 'Mohanan S N Maharaj', 'Anja Rockstroh', 'Colleen C Nelson', 'Adrian C Herington', 'Sally-Anne Stephenson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Evidence for a dual function of EphB4 as tumor promoter and suppressor regulated by the absence or presence of the ephrin-B2 ligand.', 'Differential protein expression and oncogenic gene network link tyrosine kinase ephrin B4 receptor to aggressive gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers.', 'Investigation of the expression of the EphB4 receptor tyrosine kinase in prostate carcinoma.', 'Targeting receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 in cancer therapy.', 'Transcriptional and Post-Translational Control Mechanisms for EphB4 Expression in Physiology and Cancer Disease.', 'Identification of immune biomarkers associated with basement membranes in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and their pan-cancer analysis.', 'Recent Progress in Second Near-Infrared (NIR-II) Fluorescence Imaging in Cancer.', 'Paradoxical role of Î²8 integrin on angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry in glioblastoma.', 'Ephrin B Activate Src Family Kinases in Fibroblasts Inducing Stromal Remodeling in Prostate Cancer.', 'EphrinB2-EphB4 Signaling in Neurooncological Disease.']"""

Methods:   Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program (1992-2010), we calculated age-adjusted incidence rates (IRs), IR ratios (IRRs), annual percent change (APC), relative survival (RS), RS ratios (RSRs), and the respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of SCLC and EPSCC according to primary site. We used the SEER historic stage variable that includes localized (confined to the organ of origin), regional (direct extension to adjacent organ/tissue or regional lymph nodes), and distant (discontinuous metastases) stages and combined localized and regional stages into ""limited"" stage.  Results:   The incidence of SCLC (IR = 76.3/million person-years; n = 51,959) was 22-times that of EPSCC (IR = 3.5; n = 2,438). Of the EPSCC sites, urinary bladder, prostate, and uterine cervix had the highest incidence (IRs = 0.7-0.8); urinary bladder (IRR = 4.91) and stomach (IRR = 3.46) had the greatest male/female disparities. Distant-to-limited stage site-specific IRRs of EPSCC were significantly elevated for pancreas (IRR = 6.87; P < 0.05), stomach, colon/rectum, ovary, and prostate (IRRs = 1.62-2.42; P < 0.05) and significantly decreased for salivary glands, female breast, uterine cervix, and urinary bladder (IRRs = 0.32-0.46). During 1992-2010, significant changes in IRs were observed for EPSCC overall (APC = 1.58), small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (APC = 6.75), SCLC (APC = -2.74) and small cell carcinoma of unknown primary site (APC = -4.34). Three-year RS was significantly more favorable for patients with EPSCC than SCLC for both limited (RSR = 2.06; 95% CI 1.88, 2.26) and distant stages (RSR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.16, 2.07). Among limited stage small cell carcinoma, RS was most favorable for salivary glands, female breast, and uterine cervix (RS = 52-68%), whereas RS for nearly all sites with distant stage disease was <10%.

Methods:   The prospective, multicenter cohort study included 529 patients. Questionnaires included the IIEF, QLQ-C30, and PORPUS-P. Data were collected before (baseline), three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months after treatment. Differences between groups' baseline characteristics were assessed; changes over time were analysed with generalised estimating equations (GEE). Missing values were treated with multiple imputation. Further, scores at baseline and end of follow-up were compared to German reference data.  Results:   The typical time trend was a decrease of average HRQOL three months after treatment followed by (partial) recovery. RP patients experienced considerable impairment in sexual functioning. The covariate-adjusted GEE identified a significant - but not clinically relevant - treatment effect for diarrhoea (b = 7.0 for RT, p = 0.006) and PORPUS-P (b = 2.3 for nsRP, b = 2.2 for RT, p = 0.045) compared to the reference nnsRP.

In particular, we hypothesized that if financial incentive was the predominant factor driving use, we should see a narrowing in the previously documented gap of ADT use between non-academic and academic urologists following the reimbursement cuts.  Methods:   With the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database we examined use of ADT for potentially inappropriate indications (primary therapy of localized, lower risk tumors) among patients of 2214 urologists over the period 2000-2002 and 2004-2007, representing eras before and after reimbursement cuts. Multi-level logistic regression models were used to estimate the likelihood of ADT use adjusted for patient, tumor and urologist characteristics (academic affiliation, board certification, years in practice and patient panel size).  Results:   Overall, ADT use peaked in 2002 at 46.6% of patients, but dropped dramatically in 2005, with a slow continued decrease through 2007 to 31.1%. A similar pattern was evident within most strata of urologist characteristics, including academic affiliation. In the multilevel model, patients of non-academic urologists had a 30% higher odds of receiving ADT than those of academic urologists in both the eras before and after the reimbursement cuts.

ETS family transcription factors bind similar DNA sequences and can compete for genomic binding sites. However, MAPK regulation varies across the ETS family. Therefore, changing the ETS factor bound to a cis-regulatory element can alter MAPK regulation of gene expression. To understand RAS/MAPK regulated gene expression programs, comprehensive knowledge of the ETS family members that are MAPK targets and relative MAPK targeting efficiency across the family is needed.  Results:   An in vitro kinase assay was used to rank-order 27 human ETS family transcription factors based on phosphorylation by ERK2, JNK1, and p38Î±. Many novel MAPK targets and specificities were identified within the ETS family, including the identification of the prostate cancer oncoprotein ERG as a specific target of ERK2. ERK2 phosphorylation of ERG S215 required a DEF docking domain and was necessary for ERG to activate transcription of cell migration genes and promote prostate cell migration. The ability of ERK2 to bind ERG with higher affinity than ETS1 provided a potential molecular explanation for why ERG overexpression drives migration of prostate cells with low levels of RAS/ERK signaling, while ETS1 has a similar function only when RAS/ERK signaling is high.  Conclusions:   The rank ordering of ETS transcription factors as MAPK targets provides an important resource for understanding ETS proteins as mediators of MAPK signaling. This is emphasized by the difference in rank order of ERG and ETS1, which allows these factors to have distinct roles based on the level of RAS/ERK signaling present in the cell.""","""['Nagarathinam Selvaraj', 'Vivekananda Kedage', 'Peter C Hollenhorst']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['ETS1 is a genome-wide effector of RAS/ERK signaling in epithelial cells.', 'Phosphorylation of the oncogenic transcription factor ERG in prostate cells dissociates polycomb repressive complex 2, allowing target gene activation.', 'Epiregulin expression by Ets-1 and ERK signaling pathway in Ki-ras-transformed cells.', 'Signal transduction and the Ets family of transcription factors.', 'ETS transcription factors and prostate cancer: the role of the family prototype ETS-1 (review).', 'SHIP1 Is Present but Strongly Downregulated in T-ALL, and after Restoration Suppresses Leukemia Growth in a T-ALL Xenotransplantation Mouse Model.', 'Role of MEF2C in the Endothelial Cells Derived from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.', 'ERG Functionally Overlaps with Other Ets Proteins in Promoting TH9 Cell Expression of Il9 during Allergic Lung Inflammation.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Lack of food intake during shift work alters the heart transcriptome and leads to cardiac tissue fibrosis and inflammation in rats.']"""

A total of 421(34.6%) patients received ADT, 211 (17.3%) patients experienced a biochemical failure, and 38 (3.1%) developed distant metastasis. On univariable analyses, higher PSA, earlier year of diagnosis, higher T-stage, lower doses of radiation, and the lack of ADT were associated with an increased risk of biochemical failure. No difference in biochemical failure was seen among different racial groups or with the use of greater than 6 months of ADT compared with less than 6 months. On multivariate analysis, the use of ADT was associated with a lower risk of biochemical failure than no ADT (HR, 0.599; 95% CI, 0.367-0.978; P<0.04) and lower risk of distant metastasis (HR, 0.114; 95% CI, 0.014-0.905; P=0.04).  Conclusions:   ADT reduced the risk of biochemical failure and distant metastasis in both low- and high dose radiation groups among men with intermediate-risk PCa.

These studies relied on a land use regression model (LUR) for NO2 that is commonly used in epidemiologic studies for deriving estimates of traffic-related air pollution. Here, we investigate the use of a transportation model developed during the summer season to generate a measure of traffic emissions as an alternative to the LUR model. Our traffic model provides estimates of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the level of individual roads, as does the LUR model. Our main objective was to compare the distribution of the spatial estimates of NOx computed from our transportation model to the distribution obtained from the LUR model. A secondary objective was to compare estimates of risk using these two exposure estimates. We observed that the correlation (spearman) between our two measures of exposure (NO2 and NOx) ranged from less than 0.3 to more than 0.9 across Montreal neighborhoods. The most important factor affecting the ""agreement"" between the two measures in a specific area was found to be the length of roads. Areas affected by a high level of traffic-related air pollution had a far better agreement between the two exposure measures. A comparison of odds ratios (ORs) obtained from NO2 and NOx used in two case-control studies of breast and prostate cancer, showed that the differences between the ORs associated with NO2 exposure vs NOx exposure differed by 5.2-8.8%.""","""['Maryam Shekarrizfard', 'Marie-France Valois', 'Mark S Goldberg', 'Dan Crouse', 'Nancy Ross', 'Marie-Elise Parent', 'Shamsunnahar Yasmin', 'Marianne Hatzopoulou']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Environ Res""","""['Evaluating heterogeneity in indoor and outdoor air pollution using land-use regression and constrained factor analysis.', 'Exposure to traffic-related air pollution and the risk of developing breast cancer among women in eight Canadian provinces: a case-control study.', 'Land use regression models for estimating individual NOx and NOâ exposures in a metropolis with a high density of traffic roads and population.', 'Lung Cancer and Exposure to Nitrogen Dioxide and Traffic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'A review and meta-analysis of outdoor air pollution and risk of childhood leukemia.', 'Association between Kawasaki Disease and Prenatal Exposure to Ambient and Industrial Air Pollution: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Impact of air pollution on breast cancer incidence and mortality: a nationwide analysis in South Korea.', ""Development of a road traffic emission inventory with high spatial-temporal resolution in the world's most densely populated region-Macau."", ""Exposure to hazardous air pollutants and risk of incident breast cancer in the nurses' health study II."", ""Long-term Particulate Matter Exposures during Adulthood and Risk of Breast Cancer Incidence in the Nurses' Health Study II Prospective Cohort.""]"""

Methods:   Prostate cancer cells LNCaP and PC3 were treated with Guttiferone F in serum depleted medium. Sub-G1 phase distributions were estimated with flow cytometry. Mitochondrial disruption was observed under confocal microscope using Mitotracker Red staining. Gene and protein expression changes were detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Ca(2+) elevation was examined by Fluo-4 staining under fluorescence microscope. PC3 xenografts in mice were examined by immunohistochemical analysis.  Results:   Guttiferone F had strong growth inhibitory effect against prostate cancer cell lines under serum starvation. It induced a significant increase in sub-G1 fraction and DNA fragmentation. In serum-free medium, Guttiferone F triggered mitochondria dependent apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2 family proteins. In addition, Guttiferone F attenuated the androgen receptor expression and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, while activating the phosphorylation of JNK and Ca(2+) flux. Combination of caloric restriction with Guttiferone F in vivo could increase the antitumor effect without causing toxicity.  Conclusions:   Guttiferone F induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis under serum starvation via Ca(2+) elevation and JNK activation. Combined with caloric restriction, Guttiferone F exerted significant growth inhibition of PC3 cells xenograft in vivo. Guttiferone F is therefore a potential anti-cancer compound.""","""['Xin Li', 'Yuanzhi Lao', 'Hong Zhang', 'Xiaoyu Wang', 'Hongsheng Tan', 'Zhixiu Lin', 'Hongxi Xu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The role of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in inhibition of proliferation in human prostate carcinoma cells by raloxifene: an in vitro experiment.', 'R115777 (Zarnestra)/Zoledronic acid (Zometa) cooperation on inhibition of prostate cancer proliferation is paralleled by Erk/Akt inactivation and reduced Bcl-2 and bad phosphorylation.', 'Panaxydol, a component of Panax ginseng, induces apoptosis in cancer cells through EGFR activation and ER stress and inhibits tumor growth in mouse models.', 'The role of JNK in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic strategies.', 'Polyisoprenylated benzophenones from Clusiaceae: potential drugs and lead compounds.', 'A Multivariate Diagnostic Model Based on Urinary EpCAM-CD9-Positive Extracellular Vesicles for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Natural Polyphyllins (I, II, D, VI, VII) Reverses Cancer Through Apoptosis, Autophagy, Mitophagy, Inflammation, and Necroptosis.', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Protein 1 Protects against Mitochondrial Injury by Preventing High Glucose-Induced mPTP Opening in Diabetes.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Anticancer Activities of Puerarin.']"""

Though cadmium has no physiological role, increasing evidence suggests cadmium may mimic steroid hormones. This dual ability of being carcinogenic and hormone-like makes cadmium a concern for hormone-related cancers. Causes of prostate cancer are not clear, but steroid hormones, particularly androgens and probably estrogens, may be involved. Cadmium has been positively associated with prostate cancer in occupationally exposed men. In non-occupationally exposed populations, diet and smoking are the main sources of cadmium exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary cadmium intake and prostate cancer risk in Danish men.  Methods:   Dietary cadmium intake was estimated in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort at baseline 1993-97. The estimates were based on a 192 item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and cadmium contents in all food items. Among 26,778 men we identified 1,567 prostate cancer cases from baseline through December 31, 2010 using the Danish Cancer Registry. The association between dietary cadmium intake and prostate cancer risk was analysed using Cox regression models.  Results:   We did not find an association between dietary cadmium intake and prostate cancer risk (adjusted incidence rate ratio per 10 Î¼g day(-1) = 0.98 (95% CI = 0.88-1.10)). The association did not differ according to aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Educational level, smoking status, BMI, zinc or iron intake did not modify the association.

Methods:   Epidemiological data on cancer incidence in the 2005-2012 period were obtained from the Nationwide Cancer Registry. Using data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, we collected survival information of all patients treated in the only centre providing RTx for a region inhabited by approximately 2.6 million people.  Results:   After filtering out individuals on the basis of exclusion criteria, the final dataset covered 17,736 patients. Availability of RTx increased marginally, from 23.5% (2005) to 24.4% (2011, R = 0.39, p = 0.38), with the highest values noted in patients with cervical (78.5%), prostate (70.6%) and breast cancer (62.7%). However, due to the decreasing population of the region, we noted increasing disparity in the likelihood of receiving RTx depending on the patient's area of residence, with rural areas becoming progressively more neglected. The best prognosis was noted among patients with breast or prostate cancer with 5-year OS rates reaching 81.2% and 83.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis controlling for type of diagnosis and patient age showed a time-dependent improvement in outcomes (HR(95% CI): 0.96(0.94-0.98); p < 0.0001).

In localized prostate cancers, gene fusions that place ETS-family transcription factors under the control of androgens drive gene expression programs that increase the invasiveness of organ-confined tumor cells. C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is a downstream target of ERG, whose upregulation in prostate-tumor cells contributes to their migration from the prostate gland. Recent evidence suggests that CXCR4-mediated proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells is regulated by CXCR7 through its scavenging of chemokine CXCL12. However, the role of androgens in regulating CXCR4-mediated motility with respect to CXCR7 function in prostate-cancer cells remains unclear.  Methods:   Immunocytochemistry, western blot, and affinity-purification analyses were used to study how androgens influenced the expression, subcellular localization, and function of CXCR7, CXCR4, and androgen receptor (AR) in LNCaP prostate-tumor cells. Moreover, luciferase assays and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to study how chemokines CXCL11 and CXCL12 regulate androgen-regulated genes (ARGs) in LNCaP prostate-tumor cells. Lastly, cell motility assays were carried out to determine how androgens influenced CXCR4-dependent motility through CXCL12.  Results:   Here we show that, in the LNCaP prostate-tumor cell line, androgens coordinate the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7, thereby promoting CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated cell motility. RNA interference experiments revealed functional interactions between AR and CXCR7 in these cells. Co-localization and affinity-purification experiments support a physical interaction between AR and CXCR7 in LNCaP cells. Unexpectedly, CXCR7 resided in the nuclear compartment and modulated AR-mediated transcription. Moreover, androgen-mediated cell motility correlated positively with the co-localization of CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors, suggesting that cell migration may be linked to functional CXCR4/CXCR7 heterodimers. Lastly, CXCL12-mediated cell motility was CXCR7-dependent, with CXCR7 expression required for optimal expression of CXCR4 protein.  Conclusions:   Overall, our results suggest that inhibition of CXCR7 function might decrease the metastatic potential of organ-confined prostate cancers.""","""['Jordy J Hsiao', 'Brandon H Ng', 'Melinda M Smits', 'Jiahui Wang', 'Rohini J Jasavala', 'Harryl D Martinez', 'Jinhee Lee', 'Jhullian J Alston', 'Hiroaki Misonou', 'James S Trimmer', 'Michael E Wright']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Modulation of CXC-motif chemokine receptor 7, but not 4, expression is related to migration of the human prostate cancer cell LNCaP: regulation by androgen and inflammatory stimuli.', 'The CXCR4/CXCR7/CXCL12 Axis Is Involved in a Secondary but Complex Control of Neuroblastoma Metastatic Cell Homing.', 'Induction of Kruppel-like factor 5 expression by androgens results in increased CXCR4-dependent migration of prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Chemokine receptor trio: CXCR3, CXCR4 and CXCR7 crosstalk via CXCL11 and CXCL12.', 'The CXCL12-CXCR4/CXCR7 axis as a mechanism of immune resistance in gastrointestinal malignancies.', 'CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

In case of negative cystoscopy the additional prognostic value of these markers has not been clearly defined yet. The present study is the first systematic approach to directly compare the ability of a urine marker panel to predict the risk of recurrence and progression in bladder cancer (BC) patients with no evidence of relapse during surveillance for NMIBC.  Methods:   One hundred fourteen patients who underwent urine marker testing during surveillance for NMIBC and who had no evidence of BC recurrence were included. For all patients cytology, Fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH), immunocytology (uCyt+) and Nuclear matrix protein 22 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NMP22) were performed. All patients completed at least 24 months of endoscopic and clinical follow-up of after inclusion.  Results:   Within 24 months of follow-up, 38 (33.0%) patients experienced disease recurrence and 11 (9.8%) progression. Recurrence rates in patients with positive vs. negative cytology, FISH, uCyt+ and NMP22 were 52.6% vs. 21.9% (HR = 3.9; 95% CI 1.75-9.2; p < 0.001), 47.6% vs. 25.0% (HR 2.7; 1.2-6.2; p = 0.01), 43.8% vs. 22.4% (HR 3.3; 1.5-7.6; p = 0.003) and 43.8% vs. 16.7% (HR 4.2; 1.7-10.8; p = 0.001). In patients with negative cytology, a positive NMP22 test was associated with a shorter time to recurrence (p = 0.01), whereas FISH or uCyt+ were not predictive of recurrence in these patients. In the group of patients with negative cytology and negative NMP22, only 13.5% and 5.4% developed recurrence and progression after 24 months.  Conclusions:   Patients with positive urine markers at time of negative cystoscopy are at increased risk of recurrence and progression. In patients with negative cytology, only NMP22 is predictive for recurrence. Patients with negative marker combinations including NMP22 harbour a low risk of recurrence.

The analysis of published studies suggest that biochemical relapse-free survival in combined EBRT and HDR-BT may be superior compared to EBRT alone. We retrospectively examined the effectiveness and tolerance of both schemes in a single center study.  Methods:   Between March 2003 and December 2004, 229 patients were treated for localized T1-T2N0M0 prostate cancer. Median age was 66 years (range, 49 - 83 years). PSA level ranged from 0.34 to 64 ng/ml (median 12.3 ng/ml) and Gleason score ranged from 2 to 10. The analysis included 99 patients who underwent EBRT with HDR-BT (group A) and 130 patients who were treated with EBRT alone (group B).  Results:   Median follow-up was 6 years. Biochemical relapses occurred in 34% vs. 22% (p = 0.002), local recurrences in 17% vs. 5% (p = 0.002), and distant metastases in 11% vs. 6% (p = 0.179) of patients in groups A and B, respectively. Five-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 67% vs. 81% (p = 0.005), local recurrence-free survival 95% vs. 99% (p = 0.002), metastases-free survival 95% vs. 94% (p = 0.302) for groups A and B, respectively.

Based on this result, a Temporary Authorization for Use (TAU) was performed between December 2010 and July 2011 to provide patients with mCRPC the opportunity to receive AA before its commercialization. The aim of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of AA treatment in this TAU.  Methods:   Between December 2010 and July 2011, we conducted an ambispective, multicentric cohort study and investigated data from 20 centres participating to the AA TAU for patients presenting mCRPC and already treated by a first line of chemotherapy (CT). Statistical analyses of the data were performed using the Stata software v13 to identify predictive and prognostic factors.  Results:   Among the 408 patients, 306 were eligible with a follow-up at 3 years. Median OS was 37.1 months from beginning of CT and 14.6 months from AA introduction. 211 patients (69%) received â¥ 3 months of AA and 95 patients (31%) were treated less than 3 months. In the multivariate analyses, duration of AA was significantly correlated with PSA decrease at 3 months. Additionally, shorter time under AA treatment, presence of multiple sites of metastasis and previous hormonal treatment duration were three independent factors associated with poorer OS. At the time of analysis ten patients were still under treatment for more than 3 years.  Conclusions:   Biochemical response monitored by PSA changes at 3 months is a strong predictive factor for AA treatment duration. Some high responders' patients could beneficiate from AA for more than 3 years.""","""['Nadine HouÃ©dÃ©', 'Philippe Beuzeboc', 'Sophie Gourgou', 'Diego Tosi', 'Laura Moise', 'GwenaÃ«lle Gravis', 'Remy Delva', 'Aude FlÃ©chon', 'Igor Latorzeff', 'Jean-Marc Ferrero', 'StÃ©phane Oudard', 'Sophie Tartas', 'Brigitte Laguerre', 'Delphine Topart', 'Guilhem Roubaud', 'Hanane Agherbi', 'Xavier Rebillard', 'David Azria']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Abiraterone Acetate: A Review in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostrate Cancer.', 'Subsequent Chemotherapy and Treatment Patterns After Abiraterone Acetate in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'Abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer - the unanticipated real-world clinical experience.', 'Impact of bone-targeted therapies in chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate: post hoc analysis of study COU-AA-302.', 'How I do it: Prescribing abiraterone acetate for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Observational study on time on treatment with abiraterone and enzalutamide.', 'Clinical implication of prognostic and predictive biomarkers for castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Effectiveness, safety and cost of abiraterone acetate in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a real-world data analysis.', 'Abiraterone Acetate: A Review in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostrate Cancer.', 'First Line Androgen Deprivation Therapy Duration Is Associated with the Efficacy of Abiraterone Acetate Treated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer after Docetaxel.']"""

Our earlier studies defined a mechanistic model for male hormone dependent regulation of AR protein levels in prostate cancer (CaP) cells through a negative feed-back loop between AR and PMEPA1, an androgen induced NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase binding protein. This report focuses on the impact of PMEPA1 silencing on CaP biology. PMEPA1 knockdown accelerated the growth of CaP tumor cells in athymic nude mice. In cell culture models knockdown of PMEPA1 resulted in resistance to AR inhibitors enzalutamide and bicalutamide. While, AR protein down regulation by NEDD4 was PMEPA1 dependent, we also noted a PMEPA1 independent downregulation of PTEN by NEDD4. In a subset of human CaP, decreased PMEPA1 mRNA expression significantly correlated with increased levels of AR transcription target PSA, as a surrogate for elevated AR. This study highlights that silencing of PMEPA1 accelerates the growth of CaP cells through AR, NEDD4 and PTEN. Thus, the therapeutic restoration of PMEPA1 represents a promising complementary strategy correcting for AR and PTEN defects in CaP.

Lamellipodia formed in a non-directional manner or repeatedly changed direction, explaining the enhanced chemokinetic activity of PC3 cells in response to serum stimulation. Myosin contraction promotes retrograde flow of the Synpo2-associated actin filaments at the leading edge and their merger with actin networks in the cell body. Enhanced PC3 cell migration correlates with Synpo2-induced formation of lamellipodia and immature focal adhesions (FAs), but is not dependent on myosin contraction or FA maturation.

In recent years, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors were intensively studied to develop low-molecular-weight ligands for imaging prostate cancer lesions by PET or SPECT. However, the endoradiotherapeutic use of these compounds requires optimization with regard to the radionuclide-chelating agent and the linker moiety between chelator and pharmacophore, which influence the overall pharmacokinetic properties of the resulting radioligand. In an effort to realize both detection and optimal treatment of prostate cancer, a tailor-made novel naphthyl-containing DOTA-conjugated PSMA inhibitor has been developed.  Methods:   The peptidomimetic structure was synthesized by solid-phase peptide chemistry and characterized using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Subsequent (67/68)Ga and (177)Lu labeling resulted in radiochemical yields of greater than 97% or greater than 99%, respectively. Competitive binding and internalization experiments were performed using the PSMA-positive LNCaP cell line. The in vivo biodistribution and dynamic small-animal PET imaging studies were investigated in BALB/c nu/nu mice bearing LNCaP xenografts.  Results:   The chemically modified PSMA inhibitor PSMA-617 demonstrated high radiolytic stability for at least 72 h. A high inhibition potency (equilibrium dissociation constant [K(i)] = 2.34 Â± 2.94 nM on LNCaP; K(i) = 0.37 Â± 0.21 nM enzymatically determined) and highly efficient internalization into LNCaP cells were demonstrated. The small-animal PET measurements showed high tumor-to-background contrasts as early as 1 h after injection. Organ distribution revealed specific uptake in LNCaP tumors and in the kidneys 1 h after injection. With regard to therapeutic use, the compound exhibited a rapid clearance from the kidneys from 113.3 Â± 24.4 at 1 h to 2.13 Â± 1.36 percentage injected dose per gram at 24 h. The favorable pharmacokinetics of the molecule led to tumor-to-background ratios of 1,058 (tumor to blood) and 529 (tumor to muscle), respectively, 24 h after injection.  Conclusion:   The tailor-made DOTA-conjugated PSMA inhibitor PSMA-617 presented here is sustainably refined and advanced with respect to its tumor-targeting and pharmacokinetic properties by systematic chemical modification of the linker region. Therefore, this radiotracer is suitable for a first-in-human theranostic application and may help to improve the clinical management of prostate cancer in the future.""","""['Martina BeneÅ¡ovÃ¡', 'Martin SchÃ¤fer', 'Ulrike Bauder-WÃ¼st', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Clemens Kratochwil', 'Walter Mier', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Matthias Eder']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['68Ga- and 177Lu-Labeled PSMA I&T: Optimization of a PSMA-Targeted Theranostic Concept and First Proof-of-Concept Human Studies.', 'Development of Novel PSMA Ligands for Imaging and Therapy with Copper Isotopes.', 'Enhancing Treatment Efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 with the Conjugation of an Albumin-Binding Motif: Preclinical Dosimetry and Endoradiotherapy Studies.', 'The Rise of PSMA Ligands for Diagnosis and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA-Targeting Imaging and Theranostic Agents-Current Status and Future Perspective.', 'PSMA-617 inhibits proliferation and potentiates the 177Lu-PSMA-617-induced death of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Radiochemistry for positron emission tomography.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a PSMA-Targeting Homodimer with an Optimized Linker for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiometallation and photo-triggered release of ready-to-inject radiopharmaceuticals from the solid phase.', 'Modular One-Pot Strategy for the Synthesis of Heterobivalent Tracers.']"""

The molecular mechanism underlying INPP4B's tumor-suppressive role is currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate that INPP4B restrains tumor development by dephosphorylating the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 that accumulates in situations of PTEN deficiency. In vitro, INPP4B directly dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In vivo, neither inactivation of Inpp4b (Inpp4b(Î/Î)) nor heterozygous deletion of Pten (Pten(+/-)) in mice causes thyroid abnormalities, but a combination of these mutations induces malignant thyroid cancers with lung metastases. At the molecular level, simultaneous deletion of Inpp4b and Pten synergistically increases PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and activates AKT downstream signaling proteins in thyroid cells. We propose that the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase activity of INPP4B can function as a ""back-up"" mechanism when PTEN is deficient, making INPP4B a potential novel therapeutic target for PTEN-deficient or PIK3CA-activated cancers.  Significance:   Although INPP4B expression is reduced in several types of human cancers, our work on Inpp4B-deficient mice provides the first evidence that INPP4B is a bona fide tumor suppressor whose function is particularly important in situations of PTEN deficiency.

Partners of cancer patients are often the first to respond to the demands related to their husband's illness and thus are likely to be the most supportive individuals available to the patients. It is therefore important to examine how spouses react and handle their husband's prostate cancer diagnosis.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to explore how the prostate cancer diagnosis and the participation in their partners' behavioral lifestyle intervention program influenced the spouses' life, their relationship with their partner, and how they handle the situation.  Methods:   Interviews were recorded with 8 spouses of potential low-risk prostate cancer patients on active surveillance as part of a clinical self-management lifestyle trial.  Results:   We identified 3 phases that the spouses went through: feeling insecure about their situation, coping strategies to deal with these insecurities, and feeling reassured.  Conclusions:   The framework of a clinical trial should include mobilizing spousal empowerment so that they can take on an active and meaningful role in relation to their husband's disease. The observations here substantiate that the framework of active surveillance in combination with a lifestyle intervention in 1 specific prostate cancer clinical trial can mobilize spousal empowerment.  Implications for practice:   Creating well-designed clinical patient programs that actively involve the spouse appears to promote empowerment (meaning, self-efficacy, positive impact, and self-determination) in spouses. Spousal participation in clinical patient programs can give spouses relief from anxieties while recognizing them as a vital support for their husband.""","""['Sine Rossen', 'Nete Sloth Hansen-Nord', 'Lars Kayser', 'Michael Borre', 'Mette Borre', 'Ryan Godsk Larsen', 'Antonia Trichopoulou', 'Paolo Boffetta', 'Anne TjÃ¸nneland', 'Rikke Dalgaard Hansen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""['In the middle and on the sideline: the experience of spouses of men with prostate cancer.', 'Cross-sectional relationships between dyadic coping and anxiety, depression, and relationship satisfaction for patients with prostate cancer and their spouses.', 'Problem-solving and distress in prostate cancer patients and their spousal caregivers.', 'Spousal responses to prostate cancer: an integrative review.', 'Including partners into the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a review of the literature to provide a model of care.', 'Mindfulness-based stress reduction for men on active surveillance for prostate cancer and their spouses: Design and methodology of a randomized controlled trial.', ""Female partner experiences of prostate cancer patients' engagement with a community-based football intervention: a qualitative study."", 'Study protocol: a lifestyle intervention for African American and Hispanic prostate cancer survivors on active surveillance and their partners.', 'Qualitative insights into how men with low-risk prostate cancer choosing active surveillance negotiate stress and uncertainty.', 'A lifestyle intervention among elderly men on active surveillance for non-aggressive prostate cancer: a randomised feasibility study with whole-grain rye and exercise.']"""

Methods:   We analysed 13 patients with prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence (PSA median 1.64 ng/ml, range 0.5-9.55) after radical prostatectomy and suspicious lymph nodes (median 1; range 1-3) detected on [11C]choline and [18F]fluoroethylcholine PET/CT scans. An open salvage lymphadenectomy of positive lymph nodes in a PET/CT scan and nearby lymph nodes was carried out. We examined PSA outcome without adjuvant therapy; defined complete biochemical remission as PSA <0.01 ng/ml. Histological and PET/CT findings were compared.  Results:   Ten of 11 patients with histologically confirmed lymph node metastases showed a PSA response. Three of ten patients with single lymph node metastases had a complete biochemical remission (median follow-up 72 months, range 31.0-83).

Here, for the first time, we evaluated both TK1 activity and protein levels in sera from patients with different malignancies.  Methods:   Serum samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 22), breast cancer (n = 42), prostate cancer (n = 47) and blood donors (n = 30) were analyzed for TK1 protein and activity levels, using a serum TK1 (STK1) protein assay based on antibodies and an activity assay that measured [(3)H]-deoxythymidine (dThd) phosphorylation. The molecular forms of TK1 in sera from some of these patients were analyzed using size-exclusion chromatography.  Results:   Mean STK1 activities in sera from MDS, breast and prostate cancer were 11 Â± 17.5, 6.7 Â± 19 and 1.8 Â± 1.4 pmol/min/mL, differing significantly from blood donors (mean Â± standard deviation (SD) = 1.1 Â± 0.9 pmol/min/mL). Serum TK1 protein (25 kDa polypeptide) levels were also significantly higher in MDS, breast, prostate cancer compared to blood donors (mean Â± SD = 19 Â± 9, 22 Â± 11, 20 Â± 12, and 5 Â± 3.5 ng/mL, respectively). The STK1 specific activities of sera from patients with MDS and blood donors were significantly higher when compared with activities in sera from breast and prostate cancer patients. Size-exclusion analysis of sera from breast and prostate cancer showed that the detected active TK1 was primarily a high molecular weight complex, similar to the forms found in sera from MDS patients and blood donors. However, Western blotting demonstrated high TK1 25 kDa protein levels in fractions lacking TK1 activity in sera from cases with breast and prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   These results demonstrate that there are differences in the specific activities and the subunit compositions of STK1 in hematological malignancies compared with breast and prostate cancer. This fact has several important implications for the use of STK1 as a tumor biomarker. One is that STK1 protein assays may differentiate early-stage tumor development in breast and prostate cancer more effectively than STK1 activity assays.""","""['Kiran Kumar Jagarlamudi', 'Lars Olof Hansson', 'Staffan Eriksson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Analytical and clinical characterization of an optimized dual monoclonal sandwich ELISA for the quantification of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) protein in human blood samples.', 'Properties of cellular and serum forms of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) in dogs with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and canine mammary tumors (CMTs): implications for TK1 as a proliferation biomarker.', 'A clinical evaluation of the TK 210 ELISA in sera from breast cancer patients demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in all stages of disease.', 'Thymidine kinase 1 as a tumor biomarker: technical advances offer new potential to an old biomarker.', 'Comparative aspects of the proliferation marker thymidine kinase 1 in human and canine tumour diseases.', 'A Dual Biomarker TK1 Protein and CA125 or HE4-Based Algorithm as a Better Diagnostic Tool than ROMA Index in Early Detection of Ovarian Cancer.', 'Analytical and clinical characterization of an optimized dual monoclonal sandwich ELISA for the quantification of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) protein in human blood samples.', 'Establishment of a five-enzalutamide-resistance-related-gene-based classifier for recurrence-free survival predicting of prostate cancer.', 'A comprehensive analysis of ncRNA-mediated interactions reveals potential prognostic biomarkers in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Assessing the Potential Prognostic and Immunological Role of TK1 in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) dynamic sequences have recently been shown to further increase the accuracy of staging relative to morphological imaging alone. Correct radiological staging, particularly the detection of extraprostatic disease extension, is of paramount importance for target volume definition and dose prescription in highly-conformal curative radiotherapy (RT); in addition, it may affect the risk-adapted duration of additional antihormonal therapy. The purpose of our study was to analyze the impact of mpMRI-based tumor staging in patients undergoing primary RT for prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 122 patients admitted for primary RT for prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed regarding initial clinical and computed tomography-based staging in comparison with mpMRI staging. Both tumor stage shifts and overall risk group shifts, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and the Gleason score, were assessed. Potential risk factors for upstaging were tested in a multivariate analysis. Finally, the impact of mpMRI-based staging shift on prostate RT and antihormonal therapy was evaluated.  Results:   Overall, tumor stage shift occurred in 55.7% of patients after mpMRI. Upstaging was most prominent in patients showing high-risk serum PSA levels (73%), but was also substantial in patients presenting with low-risk PSA levels (50%) and low-risk Gleason scores (45.2%). Risk group changes occurred in 28.7% of the patients with consequent treatment adaptations regarding target volume delineation and duration of androgen deprivation therapy. High PSA levels were found to be a significant risk factor for tumor upstaging and newly diagnosed seminal vesicle infiltration assessed using mpMRI.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that mpMRI of the prostate leads to substantial tumor upstaging, and can considerably affect treatment decisions in all patient groups undergoing risk-adapted curative RT for prostate cancer.""","""['Cedric Panje', 'Thierry Panje', 'Paul Martin Putora', 'Suk-Kyum Kim', 'Sarah Haile', 'Daniel M Aebersold', 'Ludwig Plasswilm']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Planning magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiation therapy: Impact on target volumes, radiotherapy dose and androgen deprivation administration.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for the assessment of extracapsular invasion and other staging parameters in patients with prostate cancer candidates for radical prostatectomy.', 'The predictive value of endorectal 3 Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for extraprostatic extension in patients with low, intermediate and high risk prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer: A review and update for urologists.', 'PET/CT and radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Association of the USPSTF Grade D Recommendation Against Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening With Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'Biparametric MRI prior to Radical Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer in a Caribbean Population: Implications for Risk Group Stratification and Treatment.', 'Quantitative FDG PET Assessment for Oncology Therapy.', 'Basic concepts and applications of functional magnetic resonance imaging for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative imaging for radiotherapy purposes.']"""

IGFBP-7 induced the apoptosis of tumor and potentially predicted the clinical outcome in some cancers is further demonstrated. This study investigates the causes and underlying mechanisms of aberrant IGFBP-7 expression in unravelling head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).  Methods:   A total of 47 oral tongue cancer patient samples were primarily analyzed for the methylation status in 5' region of IGFBP-7 by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR). Subsequently the invasion, overexpression, and knockdown of IGFBP-7 in the HNSCC A253 invasive subpopulation were employed to examine the effect of IGFBP-7. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker genes and AKT/GSK3Î²/Î²-catenin signaling were further evaluated by Western blot for the understanding the role of aberrant IGFBP-7 expression and thereof putative mechanism.  Results:   EMT expressed in the invasive subpopulation of HNSCC cell lines (A253 and RPMI 2650) was contemporary with the down-regulation of IGFBP-7. After treatment with 5-AZA-2' deoxycytidine, the de-methylated CpG sites in the 5' region of IGFBP-7 were observed and IGFBP-7 mRNA expression was also restored. Accordingly, re-expression IGFBP-7 in invasive subpopulation of A253 could induce the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and concurrently inhibited the cell invasion. Moreover, IGFBP-7 methylation status of 47 oral tongue tumors showed a positive correlation to invasive depth of the tumor, loco-regional recurrence, and cancer sequence.  Conclusions:   IGFBP-7 can alter EMT relative marker genes and suppress cell invasion in A253 cell through AKT/GSK3Î²/Î²-catenin signaling.

The average annual incidence rate was 330 cases per 100,000 persons. The cancer sites with the highest cancer incidence rates included prostate (152), female breast (84), and colon and rectum (43). Cancer incidence rates varied by municipality, particularly for prostate, lung and bronchus, and colon and rectum cancers. In 2011, cancer incidence rates in Puerto Rico were lower for all cancer sites and lung and bronchus, but higher for prostate and thyroid cancers, compared with rates within the U.S.  Population:   Identifying these variations can aid evaluation of factors associated with high incidence, such as cancer screening practices, and development of targeted cancer prevention and control efforts. Public health professionals can monitor cancer incidence trends and use these findings to evaluate the impact of prevention efforts, such as legislation prohibiting tobacco use in the workplace and public places and the Puerto Rico Cessation Quitline in decreasing lung and other tobacco-related cancers.""","""[""Mary Elizabeth O'Neil"", 'S Jane Henley', 'Simple D Singh', 'Reda J Wilson', 'Karen J Ortiz-Ortiz', 'Naydi PÃ©rez RÃ­os', 'Carlos R Torres CintrÃ³n', 'Guillermo Tortolero Luna', 'Diego E Zavala Zegarra', 'A Blythe Ryerson;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep""","""['Invasive cancer incidence and survival--United States, 2011.', 'Increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in Puerto Rico, 1985-2004.', 'Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, Featuring Cancer in Men and Women Age 20-49 Years.', 'Cancer disparities between mainland and island Puerto Ricans.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Cultural Adaptation and Open Pilot of Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for Puerto Rican Patients with Advanced Cancer.', 'Breast Cancer Research in the Caribbean: Analysis of Reports From 1975 to 2017.', 'Underuse of Radiation Therapy After Breast Conservation Surgery in Puerto Rico: A Puerto Rico Central Cancer Registry-Health Insurance Linkage Database Study.']"""

Phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2 by IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase is essential for IGF action. Here we identify Nedd4 as an IRS-2 ubiquitin ligase. Nedd4 monoubiquitinates IRS-2, which promotes its association with Epsin1, a ubiquitin-binding protein. Nedd4 recruits IRS-2 to the membrane, probably through promoting Epsin1 binding, and enhances IGF-I receptor-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In thyroid FRTL-5 cells, activation of the cyclic AMP pathway increases the association of Nedd4 with IRS-2, thereby enhancing IRS-2-mediated signalling and cell proliferation induced by IGF-I. The Nedd4 and IRS-2 association is also required for maximal activation of IGF-I signalling and cell proliferation in prostate cancer PC-3 cells.

Margin status has been found to be an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after open radical prostatectomy in several large series but this is still controversy in Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) series. We therefore wanted to investigate the prognostic significance of positive surgical margin (PSM) and other pathological factors on BCR in patients treated with RARP by a single surgeon.  Methods:   Prospectively collected data of 439 patients treated with RARP between October 2005 and June 2013 by a single surgeon at a single institution were analyzed. BCR was defined as follow-up PSA level > 0.2 ng/ml on two separate occasions or patients who had to undergo salvage therapy. Kaplan Meier curves and Log Rank test were used to compare the risk of BCR. Univariate and Multivariate Cox Regression analyses were performed to determine the prognostic impact of age, BMI, prostate weight, PSA prior to surgery, pathological T-stage, pathological Gleason sum, PSM and operative period.  Results:   In this study period, 34 out of 439 had BCR, giving an overall BCR rate of 7.7% for this cohort. Overall 2- and 3-year BCR-free survival rates were 93% and 88%, respectively. Patients with a PSM had a 2-year BCR free survival of 88% compared to 94% in those with negative margins (p < .0001). On the multivariate analysis, PSM as well as pathological Gleason sum > = 8, PSA, pathological stage and operative period were significantly associated with BCR.

Methods:   Patients, aged <68 yrs, with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Gleason â¤ 7, normal preoperative erectile function [EF]) were randomized post-nsRP 1:1:1 to 9-month treatment with tadalafil 5 mg OaD, tadalafil 20 mg PRN, or placebo, followed by 6-week drug-free washout and 3-month open-label tadalafil OaD treatment (OLT). The main outcome measures were Changes in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26), Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS), and Self-Esteem and Relationship (SEAR) questionnaires (mixed-model-for-repeated-measures, including terms for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, age-group, country, baseline-score).

Conventional chemotherapeutic strategies are effective at very high doses for only palliative management of these prostate cancers. Therefore chemo-sensitization of prostate cancer cells could be a promising strategy for increasing efficacy of the conventional chemotherapeutic agents in prostate cancer patients. Recent studies have indicated that the chemo-preventive natural agents restore the pro-apoptotic protein expression and induce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) leading to the inhibition of cellular proliferation and activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Therefore reprogramming ER stress-mitochondrial dependent apoptosis could be a potential approach for management of hormone refractory chemoresistant prostate cancers. We aimed to study the effects of the natural naphthoquinone Shikonin in human prostate cancer cells.  Results:   The results indicated that Shikonin induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells through the dual induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Shikonin induced ROS generation and activated ER stress and calpain activity. Moreover, addition of antioxidants attenuated these effects. Shikonin also induced the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway mediated through the enhanced expression of the pro-apoptotic Bax and inhibition of Bcl-2, disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) followed by the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP cleavage.  Conclusion:   The results suggest that shikonin could be useful in the therapeutic management of hormone refractory prostate cancers due to its modulation of the pro-apoptotic ER stress and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.""","""['Rishi Kumar Gara', 'Vikas Kumar Srivastava', 'Shivali Duggal', 'Jaspreet Kaur Bagga', 'Mlb Bhatt', 'Sabyasachi Sanyal', 'Durga Prasad Mishra']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biomed Sci""","""['Shikonin inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of human HepG2 cells.', 'Novel multiple apoptotic mechanism of shikonin in human glioma cells.', 'Shikonin induces tumor apoptosis in glioma cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress, and Bax/Bak mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeability.', 'Lipid rafts, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in the antitumor action of the alkylphospholipid analog edelfosine.', 'Anti-Cancer Natural Products and Their Bioactive Compounds Inducing ER Stress-Mediated Apoptosis: A Review.', 'Shikonin Induces ROS-Dependent Apoptosis Via Mitochondria Depolarization and ER Stress in Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma.', 'Promising Nanomedicines of Shikonin for Cancer Therapy.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Atractylenolide III Attenuates Apoptosis in H9c2 Cells by Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress through the GRP78/PERK/CHOP Signaling Pathway.', 'Synergistic Antibacterial Activity with Conventional Antibiotics and Mechanism of Action of Shikonin against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.']"""

Upregulation of HSD10 under nutrient-limiting conditions leads to recovery of a homeostatic state. Across disease states, increased HSD10 levels can have a profound and varied impact, such as beneficial in Parkinson's disease and harmful in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, HSD10 overexpression has been observed in some prostate and bone cancers, consistently correlating with poor patient prognosis. As the role of HSD10 in cancer remains underexplored, we propose that cancer cells utilize this enzyme to promote cancer cell survival under cell death conditions.  Methods:   The proliferative effect of HSD10 was examined in transfected pheochromocytoma cells by growth curve analysis and a xenograft model. Fluctuations in mitochondrial bioenergetics were evaluated by electron transport chain complex enzyme activity assays and energy production. Additionally, the effect of HSD10 on pheochromocytoma resistance to cell death was investigated using TUNEL staining, MTT, and complex IV enzyme activity assays.  Results:   In this study, we examined the tumor-promoting effect of HSD10 in pheochromocytoma cells. Overexpression of HSD10 increased pheochromocytoma cell growth in both in vitro cell culture and an in vivo xenograft mouse model. The increases in respiratory enzymes and energy generation observed in HSD10-overexpressing cells likely supported the accelerated growth rate observed. Furthermore, cells overexpressing HSD10 were more resistant to oxidative stress-induced perturbation.  Conclusions:   Our findings demonstrate that overexpression of HSD10 accelerates pheochromocytoma cell growth, enhances cell respiration, and increases cellular resistance to cell death induction. This suggests that blockade of HSD10 may halt and/or prevent cancer growth, thus providing a promising novel target for cancer patients as a screening or therapeutic option.""","""['Emily A Carlson', 'Rebecca T Marquez', 'Fang Du', 'Yongfu Wang', 'Liang Xu', 'Shirley ShiDu Yan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['17Î²-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 predicts survival of patients with colorectal cancer and affects mitochondrial DNA content.', 'Multiple functions of type 10 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.', 'Friend or enemy?

Adiponectin (ADN) is a hormone secreted by adipose tissue and has a variety of functions including the inhibition of PCa cell proliferation. Although serum ADN levels have been identified to be related with carcinogenesis in a tissue-specific context, the exact role of endogenous ADN in PCa cells remains largely unknown.  Methods:   Two tissue microarrays were constructed and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was utilized to detect ADN's expression in a cohort of 96 Chinese PCa patients with radical prostatectomy as well as 15 cases with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). MTS and transwell assays were applied to validate the effects of ADN on proliferation and invasive capacity of PCa cells. Real-time PCR and Western blot were performed to evaluate the expression at transcript and protein levels. Epigenetic modifications of ADN's promoter after TGF-Î²1 treatment in 22RV1 cells was monitored by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) was performed to determine the methylation status of ADN's promoter.  Results:   IHC showed decreased levels of ADN in 1 of 15 (6.7%) BPH cases, 6 of 27 (22.2%) PCa cases with low Gleason score (<7), 18 of 26 (69.2%) cases with Gleason score 7, but 32 of 43 (74.4%) cases with high Gleason score (>7). Silencing endogenous ADN could promote proliferation and invasion of 22RV1 cells via orchestrating Epithelial-to-mesenchymal Transition (EMT) process. TGF-Î²1, a potent EMT inducer, could decrease levels of chromatin markers associated with active genes (H3K4me3, H4acetylK16), and increase levels of repressive marker (H3K27me3) at ADN promoter in 22RV1 cells. Additionally, 5-aza and TSA treatment restored ADN expression in LNCaP cells in which the ADN expression was almost absent. MSP analysis revealed that methylation in the promoter might be involved in decreased expression of ADN in PCa tissues.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicated that endogenous ADN may function as a tumor suppressor gene through inhibiting EMT of PCa cells but is down-regulated in PCa via promoter hypermethylation.""","""['Weiwei Tan', 'Lin Wang', 'Quanping Ma', 'Mei Qi', 'Ning Lu', 'Lili Zhang', 'Bo Han']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['ERG-SOX4 interaction promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-Î²-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'Aberrant methylation and deacetylation of deleted in liver cancer-1 gene in prostate cancer: potential clinical applications.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostatic disease.', 'Genetic variation in the ADIPOQ gene and serum adiponectin increase the risk of bladder cancer.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Obesity and biochemical recurrence in clinically localised prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 86,490 patients.', 'The role of adipocytokines and their receptors in bladder cancer: expression of adiponectin or leptin is an independent prognosticator.', 'Adipocytokines: Are they the Theory of Everything?']"""

Given the relatively modest decline in cancer death rates over the past several years, a new research paradigm is needed to accelerate therapeutic approaches for oncologic diseases. Phase III clinical trials generate large volumes of potentially usable information, often on hundreds of patients, including patients treated with standard of care therapies (i.e., controls). Both nationally and internationally, a variety of stakeholders have pursued data-sharing efforts to make individual patient-level clinical trial data available to the scientific research community.  Potential benefits and risks of data sharing:   For researchers, shared data have the potential to foster a more collaborative environment, to answer research questions in a shorter time frame than traditional randomized control trials, to reduce duplication of effort, and to improve efficiency. For industry participants, use of trial data to answer additional clinical questions could increase research and development efficiency and guide future projects through validation of surrogate end points, development of prognostic or predictive models, selection of patients for phase II trials, stratification in phase III studies, and identification of patient subgroups for development of novel therapies. Data transparency also helps promote a public image of collaboration and altruism among industry participants. For patient participants, data sharing maximizes their contribution to public health and increases access to information that may be used to develop better treatments. Concerns about data-sharing efforts include protection of patient privacy and confidentiality. To alleviate these concerns, data sets are deidentified to maintain anonymity. To address industry concerns about protection of intellectual property and competitiveness, we illustrate several models for data sharing with varying levels of access to the data and varying relationships between trial sponsors and data access sponsors.  The project data sphere initiative:   PDS is an independent initiative of the CEO Roundtable on Cancer Life Sciences Consortium, built to voluntarily share, integrate, and analyze comparator arms of historical cancer clinical trial data sets to advance future cancer research. The aim is to provide a neutral, broad-access platform for industry and academia to share raw, deidentified data from late-phase oncology clinical trials using comparator-arm data sets. These data are likely to be hypothesis generating or hypothesis confirming but, notably, do not take the place of performing a well-designed trial to address a specific hypothesis. Prospective providers of data to PDS complete and sign a data sharing agreement that includes a description of the data they propose to upload, and then they follow easy instructions on the website for uploading their deidentified data. The SAS Institute has also collaborated with the initiative to provide intrinsic analytic tools accessible within the website itself. As of October 2014, the PDS website has available data from 14 cancer clinical trials covering 9,000 subjects, with hopes to further expand the database to include more than 25,000 subject accruals within the next year. PDS differentiates itself from other data-sharing initiatives by its degree of openness, requiring submission of only a brief application with background information of the individual requesting access and agreement to terms of use. Data from several different sponsors may be pooled to develop a comprehensive cohort for analysis. In order to protect patient privacy, data providers in the U.S. are responsible for deidentifying data according to standards set forth by the Privacy Rule of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. USING DATA SHARING TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES IN CANCER THE ""PROSTATE CANCER CHALLENGE"": Control-arm data of several studies among patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are currently available through PDS. These data sets have multiple potential uses. The ""Prostate Cancer Challenge"" will ask the cancer research community to use clinical trial data deposited in the PDS website to address key research questions regarding mCRPC. General themes that could be explored by the cancer community are described in this article: prognostic models evaluating the influence of pretreatment factors on survival and patient-reported outcomes; comparative effectiveness research evaluating the efficacy of standard of care therapies, as illustrated in our companion article comparing mitoxantrone plus prednisone with prednisone alone; effects of practice variation in dose, frequency, and duration of therapy; level of patient adherence to elements of trial protocols to inform the design of future clinical trials; and age of subjects, regional differences in health care, and other confounding factors that might affect outcomes.  Potential limitations and methodological challenges:   The number of data sets available and the lack of experimental-arm data limit the potential scope of research using the current PDS. The number of trials is expected to grow exponentially over the next year and may include multiple cancer settings, such as breast, colorectal, lung, hematologic malignancy, and bone marrow transplantation. Other potential limitations include the retrospective nature of the data analyses performed using PDS and its generalizability, given that clinical trials are often conducted among younger, healthier, and less racially diverse patient populations. Methodological challenges exist when combining individual patient data from multiple clinical trials; however, advancements in statistical methods for secondary database analysis offer many tools for reanalyzing data arising from disparate trials, such as propensity score matching. Despite these concerns, few if any comparable data sets include this level of detail across multiple clinical trials and populations.  Conclusion:   Access to large, late-phase, cancer-trial data sets has the potential to transform cancer research by optimizing research efficiency and accelerating progress toward meaningful improvements in cancer care. This type of platform provides opportunities for unique research projects that can examine relatively neglected areas and that can construct models necessitating large amounts of detailed data. The full potential of PDS will be realized only when multiple tumor types and larger numbers of data sets are available through the website.""","""['Angela K Green', 'Katherine E Reeder-Hayes', 'Robert W Corty', 'Ethan Basch', 'Mathew I Milowsky', 'Stacie B Dusetzina', 'Antonia V Bennett', 'William A Wood']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Trial design and reporting standards for intra-arterial cerebral thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke.', 'MarkVCID cerebral small vessel consortium: I.

The ErbB3-binding protein EBP1 affects both ErbB2 and androgen receptor signaling, two components of the response to ErbB-targeted therapies. We therefore examined the effects of EBP1 expression on the response to the ErbB1/2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib. We found a negative correlation between endogenous EBP1 levels and lapatinib sensitivity in prostate cancer cell lines. We then overexpressed or inhibited expression of EBP1. Silencing EBP1 expression increased lapatinib sensitivity and overexpression of EBP1 increased resistance in androgen-containing media. Androgen depletion resulted in an increased sensitivity of androgen-dependent EBP1 expressing cells to lapatinib, but did not affect the lapatinib sensitivity of hormone resistant cells. However, EBP1 silenced cells were still more sensitive to lapatinib than EBP1-expressing cells in the absence of androgens. The increase in sensitivity to lapatinib following EBP1 silencing was associated with increased ErbB2 levels. In addition, lapatinib treatment increased ErbB2 levels in sensitive cells that express low levels of EBP1, but decreased ErbB2 levels in resistant EBP1-expressing cells. In contrast, ErbB3 and phospho ErbB3 levels were not affected by either changes in EBP1 levels or lapatinib treatment. The production of the ErbB3/4 ligand heregulin was increased in EBP1-silenced cells. EBP1-induced changes in AR levels were not associated with changes in lapatinib sensitivity. These studies suggest that the ability of EBP1 to activate ErbB2 signaling pathways results in increased lapatinib sensitivity.""","""['Smita Awasthi', 'Heather Ezelle', 'Bret A Hassel', 'Anne W Hamburger']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['EBP1, an ErbB3-binding protein, is decreased in prostate cancer and implicated in hormone resistance.', 'The ErbB3-binding protein Ebp1 suppresses androgen receptor-mediated gene transcription and tumorigenesis of prostate cancer cells.', 'Specificity and heregulin regulation of Ebp1 (ErbB3 binding protein 1) mediated repression of androgen receptor signalling.', 'The role of ErbB3 and its binding partners in breast cancer progression and resistance to hormone and tyrosine kinase directed therapies.', 'Opposing roles of the two isoforms of ErbB3 binding protein 1 in human cancer cells.', 'HER2-intronic miR-4728-5p facilitates HER2 expression and accelerates cell proliferation and migration by targeting EBP1 in breast cancer.', 'ERRF sensitizes ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells to lapatinib treatment likely by attenuating MCL1 and ERBB2 expression.']"""

We examined relationships between types and intensities of activity and sedentary behavior and prostate cancer-related HRQOL, overall, and by demographic, disease, and treatment characteristics.  Methods:   Associations between post-diagnosis activity and sedentary behavior and HRQOL domains (urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual, and vitality/hormonal) were prospectively examined in men diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (n = 1917) using generalized linear models.  Results:   After adjusting for potential confounders, higher duration of total, non-vigorous, and walking activity was associated with higher vitality/hormonal functioning scores (p-trends, <0.0001). Effects were small (d = 0.16-0.20) but approached clinical significance for men in the highest vs. lowest activity categories. Survivors who walked â¥ 90 min/week at a normal pace, or faster, reported higher hormone/vitality scores (p = 0.001) than men walking <90 min at an easy pace. Weightlifting was associated with increased urinary incontinence (p-trend, 0.02). Total activity was associated with higher hormone/vitality functioning in men who were â¥ 5 years post-treatment, had more advanced disease (Gleason score â¥ 7), and had â¥ 1 comorbid condition. No relationships were observed between vigorous activity or sedentary behavior and HRQOL.  Conclusions:   Increased duration of non-vigorous activity and walking post-diagnosis was positively associated with better hormone/vitality functioning. Specifically, engaging in â¥ 5 h of non-vigorous activity or â¥ 3 h of walking per week may be beneficial.

Although the mechanisms promoting this condition are not known, several circulating proteins have been proposed to contribute. We analyzed the plasma proteome in cancer subjects in order to identify factors associated with cachexia.  Design/subjects:   Plasma was obtained from a screening cohort of 59 patients, newly diagnosed with suspected gastrointestinal cancer, with (n = 32) or without (n = 27) cachexia. Samples were subjected to proteomic profiling using 760 antibodies (targeting 698 individual proteins) from the Human Protein Atlas project. The main findings were validated in a cohort of 93 patients with verified and advanced pancreas cancer.  Results:   Only six proteins displayed differential plasma levels in the screening cohort. Among these, Carnosine Dipeptidase 1 (CNDP1) was confirmed by sandwich immunoassay to be lower in CC (p = 0.008). In both cohorts, low CNDP1 levels were associated with markers of poor prognosis including weight loss, malnutrition, lipid breakdown, low circulating albumin/IGF1 levels and poor quality of life. Eleven of the subjects in the discovery cohort were finally diagnosed with non-malignant disease but omitting these subjects from the analyses did not have any major influence on the results.  Conclusions:   In gastrointestinal cancer, reduced plasma levels of CNDP1 associate with signs of catabolism and poor outcome.

Patients and methods:   Fifty patients meeting criteria for active surveillance (AS) based on outside SBx, who underwent 3.0T multiparametric prostate MRI (MP-MRI), followed by SBx and TBx during the same session at our institution were examined. PCa TVs were calculated using MP-MRI and then correlated using bivariate analysis with the HPCI and CTL for SBx and TBx.  Results:   For TBx, HPCI and CTL showed a positive correlation (R(2)=0.31, P<0.0001 and R(2)=0.37, P<0.0001, respectively) with total MRI PCa TV, whereas for SBx, these parameters showed a poor correlation (R(2)=0.00006, P=0.96 and R(2)=0.0004, P=0.89, respectively). For detection of patients with clinically significant MRI derived tumor burden greater than 500 mm(3), SBx was 25% sensitive, 90.9% specific (falsely elevated because of missed tumors and extremely low sensitivity), and 54% accurate in comparison with TBx, which was 53.6% sensitive, 86.4% specific, and 68% accurate.  Conclusions:   HPCI and CTL on TBx positively correlates with total MRI PCa TV, whereas there was no correlation seen with SBx.

However, previous studies with plasma DNA from patients with cancer demonstrated highly variable allele frequencies of ctDNA. The comprehensive analysis of tumor genomes is greatly facilitated when plasma DNA has increased amounts of ctDNA. Therefore, a fast and cost-effective prescreening method to identify such plasma samples without previous knowledge about alterations in the respective tumor genome could assist in the selection of samples suitable for further extensive qualitative analysis.  Methods:   We adapted the recently described Fast Aneuploidy Screening Test-Sequencing System (FAST-SeqS) method, which was originally established as a simple, effective, noninvasive screening method for fetal aneuploidy from maternal blood.  Results:   We show that our modified FAST-SeqS method (mFAST-SeqS) can be used as a prescreening tool for an estimation of ctDNA percentage. With a combined evaluation of genome-wide and chromosome arm-specific z-scores from dilution series with cell line DNA and by comparisons of plasma-Seq profiles with data from mFAST-SeqS, we established a detection limit of â¥10% mutant alleles. Plasma samples with an mFAST-SeqS z-score >5 showed results that were highly concordant with those of copy number profiles obtained from our previously described plasma-Seq approach.

Although ADT improves survival, it increases the risk of diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests that ADT increases adverse cardiovascular events as early as 3 months after initiation in patients with cardiovascular disease, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that ADT may impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation due to increases in lipids and insulin resistance and may provide a link for heightened cardiovascular risk in this population.  Methods and results:   We prospectively evaluated conduit artery endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, lipids, and insulin resistance in 16 consecutively treated men (mean age 66 Â± 7 years; 25% with diabetes) with prostate cancer before and after 3 months of ADT. High-resolution B-mode ultrasound was used to assess flow-mediated (endothelium-dependent) and nitroglycerine-mediated (endothelium-independent) brachial artery vasodilation. ADT significantly increased insulin resistance, total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was greater at 3 months than at baseline (10.8% [interquartile range: 7.7% to 14.6%] versus 8.9% [interquartile range: 4.0% to 12.6%], respectively; P=0.046, allometric P=0.037). Nitroglycerine-mediated vasodilation did not change from baseline (P>0.2). The subset of participants on ADT for 6 months returned for reevaluation at 1 year. In this group, endothelium-dependent vasodilation increased from baseline to 3 months and returned to baseline 6 months after ADT withdrawal (9.4% [interquartile range: 6.9% to 10.9%], 11.6% [interquartile range: 7.9% to 15.2%], and 9.0% [interquartile range: 5.1% to 12.5%], respectively; P=0.05).

Our recent study showed that deletion of Klf5 in mouse prostate promotes tumorigenesis initiated by the deletion of Pten. While molecular characterization of Klf5-null tumors suggested that angiogenesis was partially responsible for tumor promotion, the precise function and mechanism of KLF5 deletion in prostate tumor angiogenesis remain unclear.  Results:   Applying histological staining to Pten-null mouse prostates, we observed that deletion of Klf5 significantly increased the number of microvessels, accompanied by the upregulation of multiple angiogenesis-related genes based on microarray analysis with MetaCore software. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVECs), tube formation and migration, both of which are indicators of angiogenic activities, were decreased by conditioned media from PC-3 and DU 145 human prostate cancer cells with KLF5 overexpression, but increased by media from cells with KLF5 knockdown. HIF1Î±, a key angiogenesis inducer, was upregulated by KLF5 loss at the protein but not the mRNA level in both mouse tissues and human cell lines, as determined by immunohistochemical staining, real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Consistently, KLF5 loss also upregulated VEGF and PDGF, two pro-angiogenic mediators of HIF1Î± function, as analyzed by immunohistochemical staining in mouse tissues and ELISA in conditioned media. Mechanistically, AKT activity, which caused the accumulation of HIF1Î±, was increased by KLF5 knockout or knockdown but decreased by KLF5 overexpression. PI3K/AKT inhibitors consistently abolished the effects of KLF5 knockdown on angiogenic activity, HIF1Î± accumulation, and VEGF and PDGF expression.  Conclusion:   KLF5 loss enhances tumor angiogenesis by attenuating PI3K/AKT signaling and subsequent accumulation of HIF1Î± in PTEN deficient prostate tumors.""","""['Xinpei Ci', 'Changsheng Xing', 'Baotong Zhang', 'Zhiqian Zhang', 'Jenny Jianping Ni', 'Wei Zhou', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['The roles and regulation of the KLF5 transcription factor in cancers.', 'Current knowledge of KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 5 and vascular remodeling: providing insights for therapeutic strategies.', 'PI3K/PTEN/AKT signaling regulates prostate tumor angiogenesis.', 'Klf5 deletion promotes Pten deletion-initiated luminal-type mouse prostate tumors through multiple oncogenic signaling pathways.', 'A macrophage-dominant PI3K isoform controls hypoxia-induced HIF1Î± and HIF2Î± stability and tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis.', 'KrÃ¼ppel-like factors in tumors: Key regulators and therapeutic avenues.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'The roles and regulation of the KLF5 transcription factor in cancers.', 'Current knowledge of KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 5 and vascular remodeling: providing insights for therapeutic strategies.', 'Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells from Patient-Derived Xenograft to Model Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Development.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 38 consecutive men with intermediate or high risk prostate cancer according to the D'Amico criteria underwent fluorescence targeted pelvic lymph node dissection during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Super-extended pelvic lymph node dissection was added as the control. Patients with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, macroscopic lymph node involvement or prior transurethral prostate resection were excluded from study. Statistical descriptive methods, and the chi-square test and independent t-test were used to analyze data.  Results:   Mean patient age was 64.9 years (range 46 to 74) and mean preoperative prostate specific antigen was 13.8 ng/ml (range 0.3 to 44). A total of 23 (60.5%) and 15 cases (39.5%) were classified as intermediate and high risk, respectively. Fluorescence stained nodes were found on each side in all except 1 patient. A total of 700 lymph nodes (mean Â± SD 18.4 Â± 8.2 per patient) were removed, of which 531 (75% of all nodes) were fluorescence stained (mean 14 Â± 8.07 per patient). Lymph node metastases were found in 15 patients (39.5%). Two patients (5.3%) had a solitary micrometastasis and 3 (7.9%) had nodes containing isolated tumor cells. Metastases were found outside the extended pelvic lymph node dissection template in 5 of 15 patients (33.3%). Three of those 5 patients attained a prostate specific antigen nadir of less than 0.1 ng/ml 6 weeks postoperatively. Fluorescence targeted pelvic lymph node dissection showed superior sensitivity and negative predictive value compared to extended and super-extended pelvic lymph node dissection to detect lymph node metastasis.

Receipt of RT was higher at community cancer programs compared with teaching/research centers (14% vs 7.3%; odds ratio [OR]: 2.16; p<0.001), in those with pT3-4 disease and positive margins compared with those with pT3-4 and negative margins (17% vs 5.9%; OR: 2.89; p<0.001), and in patients with a Gleason score of 8-10 compared with those with a Gleason score of 2-6 (17% vs 4.2%; OR: 3.50; p<0.001). Limitations include lack of postprostatectomy prostate-specific antigen level.  Conclusions:   Postoperative RT use for localized PCa in patients with adverse pathologic features is declining in the United States.  Patient summary:   In this report, we show that use of postoperative radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer with adverse pathologic features is declining. Patients treated at community cancer programs, those with locally advanced disease and positive margins, and those with a high Gleason score were more likely to receive postoperative radiotherapy.""","""['Helmneh M Sineshaw', 'Phillip J Gray', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Ahmedin Jemal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy for Patients with High-risk Features on Definitive Pathology: A Plea for Evidence-based Medicine.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Reactive stromal changes in PCa are likely involved in the emergence of CRPC. In the present study, we identified a novel oncogene termed COL6A1 which was upregulated in the reactive stroma of CRPC. We established an androgen-independent LNCaP (LNCaP-AI) cell line in steroid-reduced (SR) medium within 2 months. We examined COL6A1 expression with western blot during the LNCaP-AI induction, and studied the function of COL6A1 in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining of COL6A1 was performed in ten pairs of androgen-sensitive PCa and CRPC samples. We demonstrated that COL6A1 expression was markedly increased in LNCaP-AI cells and CRPC tissues compared with LNCaP cells and paired androgen-sensitive PCa specimens. In vitro, COL6A1 knockdown resulted in G1-S cell cycle arrest and descended vitality. Overexpression of COL6A1 was associated with accelerated S phase entry and elevated vitality in prostate cancer cells. COL6A1 also promoted tumorigenesis of LNCaP cells in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest an important role of COL6A1 in the molecular etiology of castration-resistant prostate cancer, and support the potential use of COL6A1 in CRPC therapy.""","""['Yi-Ping Zhu', 'Fang-Ning Wan', 'Yi-Jun Shen', 'Hong-Kai Wang', 'Gui-Ming Zhang', 'Ding-Wei Ye']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Lipocalin 2 over-expression facilitates progress of castration-resistant prostate cancer via improving androgen receptor transcriptional activity.', 'Upregulated KDM4B promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation by activating autophagy.', 'Next-generation sequencing of advanced prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Non-coding RNAs in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'High expression of COL6A1 predicts poor prognosis and response to immunotherapy in bladder cancer.', 'A novel focal adhesion-related risk model predicts prognosis of bladder cancer -- a bioinformatic study based on TCGA and GEO database.', 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonists and challenges in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Establishment and characterization of prostate organoids from treatment-naÃ¯ve patients with prostate cancer.', 'Identification of differentially expressed genes using microarray analysis and COL6A1 induction of bone metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

Here we found treating PCa cells with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) results in the recruitment of more mast cells, which might then increase PCa cell invasion via down-regulation of AR signals in 4 different PCa cell lines. Mechanism dissection revealed infiltrating mast cells could decrease AR transcription via modulation of the PRC2 complex with LncRNA-HOTAIR at the AR 5' promoter region in PCa cells. The consequences of suppressing AR may then increase PCa cell invasion via increased MMP9 expression and/or increased stem/progenitor cell population. The in vivo mouse model with orthotopically xenografted PCa CWR22Rv1 cells with/without mast cells also confirmed that infiltrating mast cells could increase PCa cell invasion via suppression of AR signals. Together, our results provide a new mechanism for the ADT-enhanced PCa metastasis via altering the infiltrating mast cells to modulate PCa AR-MMP9 signals and/or AR-stem/progenitor cell population.

We were interested to understand if the effect of metformin on prostate cancer is AR-dependent and, if so, whether metformin could act synergistically with the other anti-AR agents to serve as a therapeutic regimen with high efficacy and low toxicity.  Methods:   Cell viabilities and apoptosis were determined by MTT assay and annexin V-FITC staining, respectively, when the two human prostate cancer cell lines, the androgen-dependent LNCaP and the androgen-independent 22RV1 were treated with metformin alone or in combination with bicalutamide. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting assays were conducted to examine metformin effects on AR mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were conducted to confirm the recruitment of AR to the ARE(s) located on the promoter region of the AR target gene PSA.  Results:   Metformin treatment reduced cell viability and enhanced apoptosis for both cell lines and additive effects were observed when LNCaP cells were treated with combined metformin and bicalutamide. Metformin down-regulated full-length AR protein in LNCaP cells. Both full-length and the truncated AR (AR-v7) were down-regulated by metformin in CWR22Rv1 cells. In both LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells, metformin repressed AR signaling pathway not by affecting AR protein degradation/stability, but rather through down-regulating the levels of AR mRNAs.  Conclusions:   Metformin represses prostate cancer cell viability and enhances apoptosis by targeting the AR signaling pathway.

We present the results of a double-blind randomized controlled trial (dbRCT) on the pharmacokinetic, clinical, and molecular activity of dietary supplements containing lycopene, selenium, and green tea catechins (GTCs) in men with multifocal high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mHGPIN) and/or atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP).  Methods:   From 2009 to 2014, we conducted a dbRCT including 60 patients with primary mHGPIN and/or ASAP receiving daily lycopene 35 mg, selenium 55 Âµg, and GTCs 600 mg, or placebo for 6 months. Pharmacokinetic analysis were performed with UV-Visible spectrophotometric assay under standard (SC) and accelerated (AC) conditions. Upon plasma lycopene concentrations falling within the expected range (1.2-90 mcg/l) and no side-effects of grade >1, study proceeded to phase II (n = 50). After unblinding of results, eight men (4 per arm, 2 without and 2 with PCa, respectively) were randomly selected and totRNA extracted from ""non-pathological"" tissues. MicroRNA profiling was performed with the Agilent platform. Raw data processing used R-statistical language and linear models for microarray analysis.  Results:   Samples were stable except for lycopene, showing significant degradation (SC = 56%, AC = 59%) and consequently stabilized under vacuum in a dark packaging. Mean plasmatic lycopene concentration was 1,45 Â± 0,4 Î¼M. At 6 months, 53 men underwent re-biopsy and 13 (24.5%) were diagnosed with PCa (supplementation n = 10, placebo n = 3 [P = 0.053]). At a mean 37 months follow-up, 3 additional PCa were found in the placebo group. No significant variations in PSA, IPSS, and PR25 questionnaires were observed.

Logistic regression was used to assess demographic, psychosocial, and clinical factors on whether they felt that they had chosen the best treatment for the disease. Respondents were majority White (52.7 %), married (75.9 %), and had surgery (67.9 %) as their initial treatment. At the bivariate level, factors associated with the belief that the treatment chosen was best were as follows: White race/ethnicity, higher levels of education, a more recent treatment date, having health insurance coverage, type of treatment received, higher levels of bother from side effects, greater contentment with their quality of life, and doctor discussions of the various treatment options. Similarly, the multivariate analysis showed increased odds of belief that the treatment chosen was the best among demographic (i.e., race/ethnicity, level of education, and health insurance coverage) as well as psychosocial and clinical variables (i.e., greater bother from side effects, greater contentment with their quality of life, and initial treatment received).

We recently observed that men treated for clinically localized prostate cancer with shorter telomeres in their cancer-associated stromal cells, in combination with greater variation in cancer cell telomere lengths, were significantly more likely to progress to distant metastases, and die from their disease. Here, we hypothesized that shorter stromal cell telomere length would be associated with prostate cancer risk at time of biopsy.  Methods:   Telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed in normal-appearing stromal, basal epithelial, and luminal epithelial cells in biopsies from men randomized to the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Prostate cancer cases (N = 32) were either detected on a biopsy performed for cause or at the end of the study per trial protocol, and controls (N = 50), defined as negative for cancer on an end-of-study biopsy performed per trial protocol (e.g., irrespective of indication), were sampled. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between mean telomere length of the particular cell populations, cell-to-cell telomere length variability, and risk of prostate cancer.  Results:   Men with short stromal cell telomere lengths (below median) had 2.66 (95% CI 1.04-3.06; P = 0.04) times the odds of prostate cancer compared with men who had longer lengths (at or above median).

Gleason score is the current clinical method for PCa prognosis. It cannot reliably identify aggressive PCa, when GS is â¤ 7. It is shown that oxidative stress plays a key role in PCa progression. We have shown that in cultured human PCa cells, an activation of spermidine/spermine N(1) -acetyl transferase (SSAT; EC 2.3.1.57) enzyme initiates a polyamine oxidation pathway and generates copious amounts of reactive oxygen species in polyamine-rich PCa cells.  Method:   We used RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry methods to detect SSAT mRNA and protein expression in two tissue microarrays (TMA) created from patient's prostate tissues. We analyzed 423 patient's prostate tissues in the two TMAs.  Results:   Our data show that there is a significant increase in both SSAT mRNA and the enzyme protein in the PCa cells as compared to their benign counterpart. This increase is even more pronounced in metastatic PCa tissues as compared to the PCa localized in the prostate. In the prostatectomy tissues from early-stage patients, the SSAT protein level is also high in the tissues obtained from the patients who ultimately progress to advanced metastatic disease.

A recent integrative genomic analysis of human prostate cancers (PCas) has revealed a unique enrichment of androgen and Wnt signaling in early-onset PCas, implying their clinical significance in the disease. Additionally, interaction between the androgen receptor (AR) and Î²-catenin has long been detected in PCa cells. However, the consequence of this interaction in prostate tumorigenesis is still unknown. Because mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli, Î²-catenin and other components of the destruction complex are generally rare in PCas, other mechanisms of aberrant Wnt signaling activation have been speculated. To address these critical questions, we developed Ctnnb1(L(ex3)/+)/R26hAR(L/+):PB-Cre4 mice, in which transgenic AR and stabilized Î²-catenin are co-expressed in prostatic epithelial cells. We observed accelerated tumor development, aggressive tumor invasion and a decreased survival rate in Ctnnb1(L(ex3)/+)/R26hAR(L/+):PB-Cre4 compound mice compared with age-matched Ctnnb1(L(ex3)/+):PB-Cre4 littermate controls, which only have stabilized Î²-catenin expression in the prostate. Castration of the above transgenic mice resulted in significant tumor regression, implying an essential role of androgen signaling in tumor growth and maintenance. Implantation of the prostatic epithelial cells isolated from the transgenic mice regenerated prostate intraepithelial neoplasias and prostatic adenocarcinoma lesions. Microarray analyses of transcriptional profiles showed more robust enrichment of known tumor- and metastasis-promoting genes: Spp1, Egr1, c-Myc, Sp5, and Sp6 genes, in samples isolated from Ctnnb1(L(ex3)/+)/R26hAR(L/+):PB-Cre4 compound mice than those from Ctnnb1(L(ex3)/+):PB-Cre4 and R26hAR(L/+):PB-Cre4 littermate controls.

Sunitinib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that mainly targets membrane-bound receptors of cells within the tumor microenvironment, such as endothelial cells and pericytes. However, recent studies suggest a direct effect on tumor cells. In the present study, we have evaluated both direct and indirect effects of Sunitinib in prostate cancer and how this drug regulates hypoxia, using in vitro and in vivo models.  Methods:   We have used both in vitro (PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP cells) and in vivo (PC-3 xenografts) models to study the effect of Sunitinib in prostate cancer. Analysis of hypoxia based on HIF-1Î± expression and FMISO uptake was conducted. ALDH activity was used to analyze cancer stem cells (CSC).  Results:   Sunitinib strongly reduced proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells in a dose dependent manner, and decreased levels of p-Akt, p-Erk1/2, and Id-1, compared to untreated cells. A 3-fold reduction in tumor growth was also observed (P < 0.001 with respect to controls). Depletion of Hif-1Î± levels in vitro and a decrease in FMISO uptake in vivo showed that Sunitinib inhibits tumor hypoxia. When combined with radiotherapy, this drug enhanced cell death in vitro and in vivo, and significantly decreased CD-31, PDGFRÎ², Hif-1Î±, Id1, and PCNA protein levels (whereas apoptosis was increased) in tumors as compared to controls or single-therapy treated mice. Moreover, Sunitinib reduced the number of ALDH + cancer stem-like cells and sensitized these cells to radiation-mediated loss of clonogenicity.  Discusion:   Our results support the use of Sunitinib in prostate cancer and shows that both hypoxia and cancer stem cells are involved in the effect elicited by this drug.

Therefore, inhibition of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast-induced bone resorption is an important approach in controlling pathophysiology of these skeletal diseases. We found that, of seven type I, II, and III saikosaponins isolated from Bupleurum falcatum, saikosaponins A and D, type I saikosaponins with an allyl oxide linkage between position 13 and 28 and two carbohydrate chains that are directly attached to the hydroxyl groups in position 3, exhibited the most potent inhibition on RANKL-induced osteoclast formation at noncytotoxic concentrations. The stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group at C16 did not affect their activity. Saikosaponins A and D inhibited the formation of resorptive pits by reducing the secreted levels of matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 2, MMP-9, and cathepsin K in RANKL-induced osteoclasts. Additionally, saikosaponins A and D inhibited mRNA expression of parathyroid hormone-related protein as well as cell viability and invasion in metastatic human breast cancer cells.

Participant characteristics and selected confirmed associations are compared to published estimates: current smoking and lung cancer; country of birth and melanoma; body mass index (BMI) and bowel cancer; and paternal history of prostate cancer and prostate cancer, to illustrate the validity of this design.  Material and methods:   Cases are NSW residents, â¥18 years, with an incident cancer of any type. Controls are cancer-free spouses of cases. Participants complete a consent form, a questionnaire, and provide an optional blood sample. For analyses, odds ratios for males and females are calculated for cancers and exposures of interest, by sex-matching controls to cases.  Results:   10,816 participants (8569 cases, 2247 controls, 54% female) recruited to-date, median age: 61.6 y cases, 61.3 y controls. The top five cancer types are female breast (n=1691), prostate (n=1102), bowel (n=888), melanoma (n=608), and lung (n=265). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were: 20.65 (95% CI: 13.25-32.19) for lung cancer in current versus never smokers; 1.16 (1.05-1.28) for bowel cancer per 5 kg/m(2) increment in BMI; 1.41 (1.01-1.96) for melanoma in Australian-born compared to those born in UK/Ireland; and 2.47 (1.82-3.37) for prostate cancer in men with versus without a paternal history of prostate cancer.  Discussion:   This study design, where controls are the spouses of cases diagnosed with a variety of cancers and which are analysed unmatched, avoids potential biases due to overmatching, considered problematic in standard case-spouse control studies, and illustrates that risk estimates analysed are consistent with the published literature.

Methods:   A randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial comparing bicalutamide 150mg once daily with placebo in addition to standard care in patients with hormone-naÃ¯ve, non-metastatic PCa. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was performed to analyse time-to-event (death).  Findings:   A total of 1218 patients were included into the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (SPCG)-6 study of which 607 were randomised to receive bicalutamide in addition to their standard care and 611 to receive placebo. Median follow-up was 14.6years. Overall, 866 (71.1%) patients died, 428 (70.5%) in the bicalutamide arm and 438 (71.7%) in the placebo arm, p=0.87. Bicalutamide significantly improved OS in patient with locally advanced disease (hazard ratios (HR)=0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.94, p=0.01), regardless of baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA), with a survival benefit which was apparent throughout the study period. In contrast, survival favoured randomisation to the placebo arm in patients with localised disease (HR=1.19 (95% CI: 1.00-1.43), p=0.056). However, a survival gain from bicalutamide therapy was present in patients with localised disease and a baseline PSA greater than 28ng/mL at randomisation. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, only including patients managed on watchful waiting as their standard of care (n=991) OS depended on age, World Health Organisation (WHO) grade, baseline PSA, clinical stage and randomised treatment.  Interpretation:   Throughout the 14.6year follow-up period the addition of early bicalutamide to standard of care resulted in a significant OS benefit in patients with locally advanced PCa. In contrast, patients with localised PCa and low PSA derived no survival benefit from early bicalutamide.

Denonviliers' fascia (DVF) has been frequently studied, though the optimal anterior plane in TME is still disputed. The relationship of the lateral edges of DVF to the autonomic nerves and mesorectal fascia is unclear. We studied whole mout microscopic sections of en-bloc cadaveric pelvic exenteration and describe implications for TME.  Methods:   Four donated human adult cadaveric specimens (two males, two females) were obtained from the Leeds GIFT Research Tissue Programme. Paraffin-embedded mega blocks were produced and serially sectioned at 50 and 250 Î¼m intervals. Sections were stained with haematoxylin & eosin, Masson's trichrome and Millers' elastin. Additionally, a series of eleven human fetal specimens (embryonic age of 9-20 weeks) were studied.  Results:   DVF consisted of multiple fascial condensations of collagen and smooth muscle fibres and was indistinguishable from the anterior mesorectal fascia and the prostatic fascia or posterior vaginal wall. The lateral edges of DVF appeared fan-shaped and the most posterior part was continuous with the mesorectal fascia. Fasciae were not identified in fetal specimens.  Conclusion:   DVF is adherent to and continuous with the mesorectal fascia.

The net inflammatory response is determined by the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, the levels of which may be affected by the genetic make-up. Interleukin (IL)-18, a pro-inflammatory cytokine expressed by various cells including those of the prostate, is a key mediator of anti-cancer immune response. IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine associated with tumour malignancy, causes escape from immune surveillance. This study hypothesizes that genetic variants of IL-18 (-607 C/A and -137 G/T) and IL-10 (-819 C/T and -592 C/A) may influence the circulating levels of these interleukins, thereby generating susceptibility risk to prostate cancer. The study was conducted on 676 subjects (controls and patients of prostate cancer (PCa): 291 each; and 94 patients with benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH)). Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP and Real-Time PCR probe-based method. Circulating interleukin levels were obtained by ELISA. Circulating IL-18 levels were significantly elevated in cancer and BPH patients carrying GG genotypes for -137 of IL-18. The trend of circulating IL-18 levels was GG>GC>CC, observed in all groups. The -137 genetic variants of IL-18 significantly associated with PCa risk were GC, CC, and GC+CC, compared to GG (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.20-2.46; OR: 3.35, 95% CI: 2.03-5.53; and OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.46-2.87, respectively). A significant association of AA and CA+AA against CC genotype was observed at -607 locus of IL-18 (OR: 0.46, 95%CI: 0.29-0.72; OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.41-0.90, respectively). Significantly elevated levels of IL-10 were observed with TT (wild) genotype at -819 of IL-10, compared to the CC (homozygous mutant) genotype in all three groups of subjects. However, no significant association was found between IL-10 promoter genotypes and PCa risk. We conclude that genetic variants of IL-18 and IL-10 promoters influence the circulating levels of these interleukins.

While higher insufflation pressures (20 mm Hg) may reduce venous oozing and improve visualization, the safety of this method has not been confirmed. This study evaluates the short-term perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing RARP with insufflation pressures of 20 mm Hg.  Patients and methods:   A single-surgeon, prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing RARP was retrospectively analyzed. Patients who underwent RARP with a pneumoperitoneum pressure of 15 and 20 mm Hg for the entire procedure were analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were compared. Complications, operative time, and estimated blood loss were also examined.  Results:   The number of patients in the experimental (20 mm Hg) and control (15 mm Hg) groups were 550 and 201, respectively. The groups were well matched with respect to age and operative time. The experimental group had a significantly smaller decrease in mean hemoglobin levels after surgery (-1.18 vs-2.13 mg/dL, P<0.0001). There was no significant difference in the eGFR on the first day after surgery (postoperative day [POD]1) (88.4 vs 85.0 mL/min/1.73m(2), P=0.11) or in the change in eGFR from preoperative to POD1 levels (-0.49 vs 1.54 mL/min/1.73m(2), P=0.18). The complication rate in the experimental group was 8.55% vs 8.46% in the control group.

Generalized estimating equations were used to study the effects of EX versus PA on HRQoL at 6 and 12 months, adjusting for baseline HRQoL. The authors examined potential sociodemographic and clinical moderators by adding interaction terms, and potential physical and psychological mediators using the product-of-coefficients test.  Results:   At 6 months, significant beneficial effects were found for global QoL, physical function, and social function in the EX group compared with the PA group. For physical function, beneficial effects were sustained at 12 months.

Its physiological role is to catalyze the release of kinins and other vasoactive peptides. Several KLKs have been proposed as putative tumor biomarkers with significant diagnostic and/or prognostic value in human malignancies arising from solid tumors; the most prominent example is the worldwide use of KLK3 (prostate-specific antigen, PSA) in prostate cancer diagnostics. The aim of this study was to analyze KLKB1 mRNA expression in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and to examine its diagnostic value as a novel molecular biomarker in CLL.  Design and methods:   Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of sixty-nine patients previously diagnosed with CLL and thirty-one healthy blood donors. After cDNA preparation, a sensitive and cost-effective quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) methodology was developed and applied for KLKB1 mRNA quantification. Last, we carried out a biostatistical analysis to assess the clinical significance of KLKB1 mRNA expression.  Results:   According to our findings, KLKB1 mRNA expression is significantly higher in CLL patients than in healthy blood donors. Furthermore, KLKB1 mRNA levels are negatively correlated with CD38 expression, an established prognostic biomarker in CLL.

Methods and materials:   This prospective observational study was conducted in cancer patients referred for pelvic radiation therapy. Serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured before radiation therapy. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of <35 nmol/L and <40 nmol/L in male and female patients, respectively, based on available normative data.

Therefore, any strategy to stop or at least slacken the development and progression of malignant cells is an important therapeutic choice. The aim of the present work is the identification of novel cancer chemotherapy agents. Nowadays, many different drug discovery approaches are available, but this paper focuses on Molecular Topology, which has already demonstrated its extraordinary efficacy in this field, particularly in the identification of new hit and lead compounds against cancer. This methodology uses the graph theoretical formalism to numerically characterize molecular structures through the so called topological indices. Once obtained a specific framework, it allows the construction of complex mathematical models that can be used to predict physical, chemical or biological properties of compounds. In addition, Molecular Topology is highly efficient in selecting and designing new hit and lead drugs. According to the aforementioned, Molecular Topology has been applied here for the construction of specific Akt/mTOR and Î²-catenin inhibition mathematical models in order to identify and select novel antitumor agents.  Experimental approach:   Based on the results obtained by the selected mathematical models, six novel potential inhibitors of the Akt/mTOR and Î²-catenin pathways were identified. These compounds were then tested in vitro to confirm their biological activity.  Conclusion and implications:   Five of the selected compounds, CAS nÂ° 256378-54-8 (Inhibitor nÂ°1), 663203-38-1 (Inhibitor nÂ°2), 247079-73-8 (Inhibitor nÂ°3), 689769-86-6 (Inhibitor nÂ°4) and 431925-096 (Inhibitor nÂ°6) gave positive responses and resulted to be active for Akt/mTOR and/or Î²-catenin inhibition.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of PDZ Domain-binding kinase (PBK) in prostate cancer and to determine if PBK expression enhances aggressiveness in prostate cancer. Using archival tissue samples, gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies, we show that PBK expression is up-regulated in prostate cancer, and its expression level is commensurate with invasiveness. Modulation of PBK expression and function causally regulates the invasive ability of prostate cancer cells. Production of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9, which are key players in metastatic invasion, is up-regulated, and the promoters of these genes are transcriptionally activated by PBK via increased Î²-catenin-TCF/LEF signaling. Prostate cancer tissue specimens show that PBK's expression correlates with aggressive disease and distant metastasis in bone, lymph node and abdomen.

In this investigation, CXCR6 protein expression was examined using high-density tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry. Expression of CXCR6 shows a higher epithelial staining in breast cancer nest site and metastatic lymph node than the normal breast tissue, suggesting that CXCR6 may be involved in breast cancer (BC) development. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that overexpression of CXCR6 in BC cells has a marked effect on increasing cell migration, invasion and metastasis. In contrast, reduction of CXCR6 expression by shRNAs in these cells greatly reduce its invasion and metastasis ability. Mechanistic analyses show that CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis is capable of modulating activation of RhoA through activating ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which then inhibits the activity of cofilin, thereby enhancing the stability of F-actin, responsible for invasiveness and metastasis of BC. Taken together, our data shows for the first time that the CXCR6 / ERK1/2/ RhoA / cofilin /F-actin pathway plays a central role in the development of BC.

Myostatin functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass and has recently become a therapeutic target for reducing the loss of skeletal muscle and strength associated with clinical myopathies. We generated neutralizing antibodies to myostatin to test their potential use as therapeutic agents to attenuate the skeletal muscle wasting due to cancer. We show that our neutralizing antimyostatin antibodies significantly increase body weight, skeletal muscle mass, and strength in non-tumor-bearing mice with a concomitant increase in mean myofiber area. The administration of these neutralizing antibodies in two preclinical models of cancer-induced muscle wasting (C26 colon adenocarcinoma and PC3 prostate carcinoma) resulted in a significant attenuation of the loss of muscle mass and strength with no effect on tumor growth. We also show that the skeletal muscle mass- and strength-preserving effect of the antibodies is not affected by the coadministration of gemcitabine, a common chemotherapeutic agent, in both non-tumor-bearing mice and mice bearing C26 tumors.

In many patients, AR COOH-terminal truncated splice variants (ARvs) play a critical role in contributing to the resistance against androgen depletion therapy. Unfortunately, clinically used antiandrogens like bicalutamide (BIC) and enzalutamide (MDV), which target the ligand binding domain, have failed to suppress these AR variants. Here, we report for the first time that a natural prenylflavonoid, icaritin (ICT), can co-target both persistent AR and ARvs. ICT was found to inhibit transcription of key AR-regulated genes, such as KLK3 [prostate-specific antigen (PSA)] and ARvs-regulated genes, such as UBE2C and induce apoptosis in AR-positive prostate cancer (PC) cells. Mechanistically, ICT promoted the degradation of both AR and ARvs by binding to arylhydrocarbon-receptor (AhR) to mediate ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. Therefore, ICT impaired AR transactivation in PC cells. Knockdown of AhR gene restored AR stability and partially prevented ICT-induced growth suppression. In clinically relevant murine models orthotopically implanted with androgen-sensitive and CRPC cells, ICT was able to target AR and ARvs, to inhibit AR signaling and tumor growth with no apparent toxicity. Our results provide a mechanistic framework for the development of ICT, as a novel lead compound for AR-positive PC therapeutics, especially for those bearing AR splice variants.""","""['Feng Sun', 'Inthrani R Indran', 'Zhi Wei Zhang', 'M H Eileen Tan', 'Yu Li', 'Z L Ryan Lim', 'Rui Hua', 'Chong Yang', 'Fen-Fen Soon', 'Jun Li', 'H Eric Xu', 'Edwin Cheung', 'Eu-Leong Yong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cotargeting Androgen Receptor Splice Variants and mTOR Signaling Pathway for the Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Growth Inhibition by Testosterone in an Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-Driven Prostate Cancer Model.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptor variant-driven prostate cancer: clinical implications and therapeutic targeting.', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor as an Anticancer Target: An Overview of Ten Years Odyssey.', 'Multidisciplinary strategies to enhance therapeutic effects of flavonoids from Epimedii Folium: Integration of herbal medicine, enzyme engineering, and nanotechnology.', 'The Impact of Indoles Activating the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor on Androgen Receptor Activity in the 22Rv1 Prostate Cancer Cell Line.', 'Plant Occurring Flavonoids as Modulators of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor.', 'Identification of low-frequency variants of UGT1A3 associated with bladder cancer risk by next-generation sequencing.']"""

Patients and method:   From 2011 onwards, consecutive men undergoing 12-core prostate biopsy were enrolled into a prospective database. Indications for a prostatic biopsy were a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value of â¥4 ng/mL and/or a positive digital rectal examination. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumferences were measured before the biopsy. Fasting blood samples were collected before biopsy and tested for: total PSA, glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and trygliceride levels. Blood pressure was recorded. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined according to the Adult Treatment panel III. The PASE questionnaire was completed before the biopsy.  Results:   In all, 286 patients were enrolled with a median (interquartile range, IQR) age and PSA level of 68 (62-74) years and 6.1 (5-8.8) ng/mL, respectively. The median (IQR) BMI was 26.4 (24.6-29) kg/m(2) and waist circumference was 102 (97-108) cm, with 75 patients (26%) presenting with MetS. In all, 106 patients (37%) had prostate cancer at biopsy. Patients with prostate cancer had higher PSA levels (median [IQR] 6.7 [5-10] vs 5.6 [4.8-8] ng/mL; P = 0.007) and lower LogPASE scores (median [IQR] 2.03 [1.82-2.18] vs 2.10 [1.92-2.29]; P = 0.005). On multivariate analysis, in addition to well-recognised risk factors such as age, PSA level and prostate volume, LogPASE score was an independent risk factor for prostate cancer diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 0.146, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.037-0.577; P = 0.006]. LogPASE score was also an independent predictor of high-grade cancer (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.006-0.764; P = 0.029).  Conclusion:   In our single-centre study, increased physical activity, evaluated by the PASE questionnaire, is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer and of high-grade prostate cancer at biopsy. Further studies should clarify the molecular pathways behind this association.""","""['Cosimo De Nunzio', 'Fabrizio Presicce', 'Riccardo Lombardo', 'Fabiana Cancrini', 'Stefano Petta', 'Alberto Trucchi', 'Mauro Gacci', 'Luca Cindolo', 'Andrea Tubaro']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Metabolic syndrome is associated with advanced prostate cancer in patients treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy: results from a multicentre prospective study.', 'Repeat prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test before prostate biopsy: a 20% decrease in PSA values is associated with a reduced risk of cancer and particularly of high-grade cancer.', 'Abdominal obesity as risk factor for prostate cancer diagnosis and high grade disease: a prospective multicenter Italian cohort study.', 'Exercise and prostate cancer.', 'A review of physical activity and prostate cancer risk.', 'Physical Inactivity, Metabolic Syndrome and Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Development of a Predicting Nomogram.', 'Metabolic Syndrome and Physical Inactivity May Be Shared Etiological Agents of Prostate Cancer and Coronary Heart Diseases.', 'Physical activity decreases the risk of cancer reclassification in patients on active surveillance: a multicenter retrospective study.', 'A preliminary study of micro-RNAs as minimally invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of prostate cancer patients.', 'A randomized controlled trial of a home-based exercise program on prognostic biomarkers in men with prostate cancer: A study protocol.']"""

MET (250 mg/kg body weight in the drinking water), RAPA (2.24 mg/kg body weight microencapsulated in the diet), and the combination inhibited progression of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions to adenocarcinomas in the ventral prostate (VP). RAPA and the combination were more effective than MET at the doses used. Inhibition of prostate cancer progression in HiMyc mice by RAPA was associated with a significant reduction in mTORC1 signaling that was further potentiated by the combination of MET and RAPA. In contrast, treatment with MET alone enhanced AMPK activation, but had little or no effect on mTORC1 signaling pathways in the VP of HiMyc mice. Further analyses revealed a significant effect of all treatments on prostate tissue inflammation as assessed by analysis of the expression of cytokines, the presence of inflammatory cells and NFÎºB signaling. MET at the dose used appeared to reduce prostate cancer progression primarily by reducing tissue inflammation whereas RAPA and the combination appeared to inhibit prostate cancer progression in this mouse model via the combined effects on both mTORC1 signaling as well as on tissue inflammation. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that blocking mTORC1 signaling and/or tissue inflammation can effectively inhibit prostate cancer progression in a relevant mouse model of human prostate cancer. Furthermore, combinatorial approaches that target both pathways may be highly effective for prevention of prostate cancer progression in men.""","""['Achinto Saha', 'Jorge Blando', 'Lisa Tremmel', 'John DiGiovanni']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Regression of mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate model.', 'The Combination of Metformin and Valproic Acid Has a Greater Anti-tumoral Effect on Prostate Cancer Growth In Vivo than Either Drug Alone.', 'Metformin potentiates rapamycin and cisplatin in gastric cancer in mice.', 'Dietary energy balance modulates prostate cancer progression in Hi-Myc mice.', 'Main Inflammatory Cells and Potentials of Anti-Inflammatory Agents in Prostate Cancer.', ""Evaluation of the Combination of Metformin and Rapamycin in an MPP+-Treated SH-SY5Y Model of Parkinson's Disease."", 'White adipose tissue-derived factors and prostate cancer progression: mechanisms and targets for interventions.', 'Autophagy: a multifaceted player in the fate of sperm.', 'Autophagy-targeted therapy to modulate age-related diseases: Success, pitfalls, and new directions.', 'The Effect of Metformin on Male Reproductive Function and Prostate: An Updated Review.']"""

However, various side effects often worsen physical functioning and reduce well-being among men on this treatment. Based on existing evidence, both resistance and aerobic training provide benefits for this population yet adherence rates are often low. The method of exercise delivery (supervised in-center or home-based) may be important, yet few studies have compared different models. Additionally, long-term exercise adherence is critical to achieve sustained benefits but long-term adherence data and predictors of adherence are lacking. The primary aim of this phase II, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial is to determine whether three exercise training delivery models are equivalent in terms of benefits in quality of life and physical fitness in this population. Secondary aims include examination of long-term adherence and cost-effectiveness.  Design:   Men diagnosed with prostate cancer, starting or continuing on androgen deprivation therapy for at least 6 months, fluent in English, and living close to one of two experienced Canadian study centers are eligible. Participants complete five assessments over one year, including a fitness assessment and self-report questionnaires. Socio-demographic and clinical data collection occur at baseline, bone mineral density testing at two time points, and blood work is performed at three time points. Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to supervised personal training, supervised group training, or home-based smartphone- and health coach-supported training. Each participant receives a detailed exercise manual, including illustrations of exercises and safety precautions. Participants are asked to complete 4 to 5 exercise sessions per week, incorporating aerobic, resistance and flexibility training. Participant intensity levels will be monitored. The intervention duration is 6 months, with 6 months additional follow-up. Outcomes include: body composition, fitness testing, quality of life and fatigue, biological outcomes, and program adherence. Cost information will be obtained using patient diary-based self-report.  Discussion:   The goals of this study are to gain a better understanding of health benefits and costs associated with commonly used yet currently not compared exercise delivery models as well as an increased understanding of adherence to exercise.

Our previous study has shown that ultrasound-guided autologous tenocyte injection (ATI) to the torn tendon in patients with chronic resistant LE significantly improves pain, function, and structural repair at 1 year. This report is the continued assessment of the clinical outcomes of these patients at mean 4.5-year follow-up.  Hypothesis:   Improvements in LE clinical function and structural repair after ATI will be maintained at mean 4.5-year follow-up.  Study design:   Case series; Level of evidence, 4.  Methods:   Patients with severe refractory LE underwent clinical evaluation and MRI before intervention. A patellar tendon needle biopsy was performed under local anesthetic, and tendon cells were expanded by in vitro culture. Autologous tenocytes were injected into the central tendinopathy identified at the common extensor tendon origin under ultrasound guidance on a single occasion. Patients underwent serial clinical evaluations for up to 5 years after ATI, including the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH), Upper Extremity Functional Scale (UEFS), and grip strength. Post-ATI MRI scanning was performed at 1 year and final follow-up.  Results:   A total of 16 patients (9 male, 7 female), aged between 37 and 63 years, were included in the study. The mean duration of symptoms before study recruitment was 29.24 months (range, 6-240 months). One patient elected to proceed to surgery 3 months after ATI due to reinjury at work, and 1 patient died of prostate cancer with metastases during the follow-up period. The mean final follow-up time for the remaining 15 patients was 4.51 years (range, 3.08-5.17 years). No complications were observed at the patellar tendon biopsy site for any patient. No adverse events, infection, or excessive fibroblastic reactions were observed in any patient at the injection site. Clinical evaluation revealed significant (P < .001) improvement in mean VAS pain score from 5.73 at initial assessment to 1.21 (78% improvement) at final follow-up. Mean QuickDASH, UEFS, and grip strength scores also significantly (P < .001) improved from initial assessment to final follow-up (from 45.88 to 6.61 [84%], from 31.73 to 9.20 [64%], and from 19.85 to 46.60 [208%], respectively). There was no difference in mean QuickDASH and UEFS scores at 1 year and final follow-up (P > .05); however, grip strength continued to improve (P < .001). A validated MRI scoring system indicated that the mean grade of tendinopathy at the common extensor origin improved significantly (P < .001) from initial assessment (4.31) to 1 year (2.88) and was maintained (P > .05) at final follow-up (2.87). At final follow-up, 93% of patients were either highly satisfied or satisfied with their ATI treatment.  Conclusion:   ATI significantly improved clinical function and MRI tendinopathy scores for up to 5 years in patients with chronic resistant LE who had previously undergone unsuccessful nonsurgical treatment.

Methods and study design:   The study population consisted of 186 consecutive prostate cancer patients treated with an image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) hypofractionated protocol using 3 techniques: 32 with X-ray, 30 with CBCT, and 124 with US. Treatment dose of 70.2 Gy was delivered in 26 fractions with a conformal dynamic arcs technique. Interfraction prostate localization errors were determined for the 3 techniques. Moreover, interfraction and intrafraction prostate motion in terms of translations and rotations, as well as residual errors, were determined with X-ray.  Results:   The systematic and random components of the prostate localization errors were as follows: (1) with X-ray 3.0 Â± 3.4, 2.3 Â± 2.7, 1.8 Â± 2.3 mm in anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), and left-right (LR) directions and 1.8Â° Â± 1.2Â°, 2.3Â° Â± 1.5Â°, 2.7Â° Â± 3.1Â°, for the yaw, roll, and pitch rotations; (2) with CBCT 3.5 Â± 4.2, 3.3 Â± 3.3, 2.5 Â± 3.1 mm in AP, SI, and LR directions; (3) with US 3.7 Â± 4.7, 3.4 Â± 4.3, 2.3 Â± 3.5 mm in AP, SI, and LR directions. Residual errors with X-ray were less than 1 mm in all directions. Intrafraction prostate motion of less than 0.5 mm in LR and of the order of 1 mm in AP and SI directions was found. This led to a significant reduction of the margins, potentially important for dose escalation studies.

We wanted to further explore the relationship of miR-135b to hormonal receptors, particularly estrogen receptor Î± (ERÎ±). Here we show that miR-135b expression is lower in ERÎ±-positive breast tumors as compared to ERÎ±-negative samples in two independent breast cancer (BCa) patient cohorts (101 and 1302 samples). Additionally, the miR-135b expression is higher in AR-low PCa patient samples (47 samples).

Results:   Although no positive relation was discovered in the pooled analysis, significant associations between rs1052133 and Pca were found in the Asian population (recessive: odds ratio [OR] = 1.580, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.189-2.098; GG vs. GC: OR = 1.504, 95% CI, 1.114-2.030; GG vs. CC: OR = 1.677, 95% CI, 1.201-2.342; allele analysis: OR = 1.249, 95% CI, 1.077-1.449), whites (dominant: OR = 2.138, 95% CI, 1.483-3.083; recessive: OR = 3.143, 95% CI, 1.171-8.437; GG vs. CC: OR = 3.992, 95% CI, 1.891-8.431; allele analysis: OR = 1.947, 95% CI, 1.467-2.586) and mixed populations (recessive: OR = 0.636, 95% CI, 0.484-0.834; GG vs. GC: OR = 0.654, 95% CI, 0.492-0.871; GG vs. CC: OR = 0.624, 95% CI, 0.473-0.823; allele analysis: OR = 0.857, 95% CI, 0.771-0.954). After excluding studies deviating from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, a significant association was also found in the same ethnic groups. In addition, a new positive relation was identified in the ""other country"" subgroup (with China, South Korea and Australia included) (dominant: OR = 1.622, 95% CI, 1.163-2.261; recessive: OR = 1.773, 95% CI, 1.308-2.404; GG vs. GC: OR = 1.614, 95% CI, 1.169-2.230; GG vs. CC: OR = 2.108, 95% CI, 1.456-3.051; allele analysis: OR = 1.494, 95% CI, 1.235-1.808) and among the Chinese-Korean population.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, we suggest that the hOGG1 C1245G polymorphism might be potentially associated with Pca risk in different ethnicities and countries, especially among Asians. Further studies are needed to confirm these relations.""","""['Yang Chen', 'Jie Li', 'Tianyu Li', 'Zengnan Mo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Biol Markers""","""['Association between hOGG1 polymorphism rs1052133 and gastric cancer.', 'HOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and susceptibility to head and neck cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Lack of association between hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and the risk of bladder cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) Arg399Gln polymorphism significantly associated with prostate cancer.', 'Association Between the hOGG1 1245C>G (rs1052133) Polymorphism and Susceptibility to Colorectal Cancer: a Meta-analysis Based on 7010 Cases and 10,674 Controls.', 'hOGG1 rs1052133 Polymorphism and Prostate Cancer Risk: A Chinese Case-Control Study and Meta-Analysis.', 'Base Excision Repair Gene Polymorphisms and Wilms Tumor Susceptibility.', 'Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes in gastrointestinal stromal tumours: susceptibility and correlation with tumour characteristics and clinical outcome.']"""

Epub 2013 Dec 11""","""Background:   Abiraterone, a potent CYP 17 inhibitor, is standard treatment in docetaxel refractory, metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, in countries where abiraterone has not been approved yet, or for patients who cannot afford it, ketoconazole is used as an alternative CYP 17 inhibitor. Although preclinical data suggests that ketoconazole is a less potent inhibitor of CYP 17, there are limited clinical data comparing both agents. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of abiraterone versus ketoconazole in docetaxel refractory mCRPC.  Methods:   Records from mCRPC patients treated with ketoconazole (international multicenter database, n = 162) were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-six patients treated post docetaxel were individually matched by clinicopathologic factors to patients treated with abiraterone (national multicenter database, n = 140). We compared the PSA response, biochemical and radiological progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) between the groups. PFS and OS were determined by Cox regression.  Results:   The groups were matched by Gleason score, pre-treatment disease extent, ECOG PS, pre-treatment risk category (Keizman, Oncologist 2012). Furthermore, they were balanced regarding other known confounding risk factors. In the groups of abiraterone versus ketoconazole, PSA response was 46% versus 19% (OR 4.3, P = 0.04), median biochemical PFS 7 versus 2 months (HR 1.54, P = 0.02), median radiological PFS 8 versus 2.5 months (HR 1.8, P = 0.043), median OS 19 versus 11 months (HR 0.53, P = 0.79), and treatment interruption d/t severe adverse events 8% (n = 2) versus 31% (n = 8) (OR 0.6, P = 0.023).

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively identified 134 patients who were 60 years and younger who were treated with docetaxel in 25 Italian hospitals and recorded their predocetaxel history of prostate cancer, their characteristics at the start of chemotherapy, and their postdocetaxel treatment history and outcomes.  Results:   Most of the 134 consecutive patients with mCRPC received the standard 3-week docetaxel schedule; median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7 months, and 90 patients underwent further therapies after progression. The median overall survival (OS) from the start of docetaxel treatment was 21 months, but OS was significantly prolonged by the postprogression treatments, particularly those based on the new agents such as cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, or enzalutamide. OS was significantly shorter in the patients with a shorter interval between the diagnosis of prostate cancer and the start of docetaxel treatment; those who received hormonal treatment for a shorter period; those with shorter prostate-specific antigen doubling times; and those with lower hemoglobin levels, a worse performance status, and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels before starting treatment with docetaxel.

Our aim was to assess the use of ipilimumab after radiotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy.  Methods:   We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial in which men with at least one bone metastasis from castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive bone-directed radiotherapy (8Gy in one fraction) followed by either ipilimumab 10mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to four doses. Non-progressing patients could continue to receive ipilimumab at 10mg/kg or placebo as maintenance therapy every 3 months until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effect, or death. Patients were randomly assigned to either treatment group via a minimisation algorithm, and stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, alkaline phosphatase concentration, haemoglobin concentration, and investigator site. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00861614.  Findings:   From May 26, 2009, to Feb 15, 2012, 799 patients were randomly assigned (399 to ipilimumab and 400 to placebo), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Median overall survival was 11.2 months (95% CI: 9.5-12.7) with ipilimumab and 10.0 months (8.3-11.0) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.85, 0.72-1.00; P = 0.053). However, the assessment of the proportional hazards assumption showed that it was violated (P = 0.0031). A piecewise hazard model showed that the HR changed over time: the HR for 0-5 months was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.10-1.95), for 5-12 months was 0.65 (0.50-0.85), and beyond 12 months was 0.60 (0.43-0.86). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were immune-related, occurring in 101 (26%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 11 (3%) of patients in the placebo group. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events included diarrhoea (64 [16%] of 393 patients in the ipilimumab group vs seven [2%] of 396 in the placebo group), fatigue (40 [11%] vs 35 [9%]), anaemia (40 [10%] vs 43 [11%]), and colitis (18 [5%] vs 0). Four (1%) deaths occurred because of toxic effects of the study drug, all in the ipilimumab group.  Interpretation:   Although there was no significant difference between the ipilimumab group and the placebo group in terms of overall survival in the primary analysis, there were signs of activity with the drug that warrant further investigation.

Whether long-term ADT is required for patients with localized prostate cancer, especially elderly men, remains unknown. In the present study, we explored the possibility of ADT cessation after a favorable response to primary ADT in patients with localized prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed men with localized prostate cancer who had achieved a good initial response to primary ADT and stopped it thereafter. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence was defined as 2 consecutive increases > 4 ng/mL. A total of 34 patients (age, 62-89 years) were followed up for > 24 months after ADT cessation.  Results:   The ADT duration and follow-up period after ADT cessation was 10 to 162 months (median, 33.5 months) and 24 to 95 months (median, 37 months), respectively. PSA recurrence was observed in 10 of 34 patients (29.4%), and the 5-year PSA progression-free rate was 66.2%. PSA recurrence was observed in 100% (6 of 6) and 14.3% (4 of 28) of men who had received ADT for < 16 months and > 16 months, respectively. ADT was reinstated in 5 patients after PSA recurrence; and their PSA levels declined rapidly, and no clinical progression was observed. The 5-year overall and disease-specific survival rate was 65.1% and 100%, respectively.

We used updated diazinon exposure and cancer incidence information to evaluate solid tumour risk in the AHS.  Methods:   Male pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina reported lifetime diazinon use at enrolment (1993-1997) and follow-up (1998-2005); cancer incidence was assessed through 2010(North Carolina)/2011(Iowa). Among applicators with usage information sufficient to evaluate exposure-response patterns, we used Poisson regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CI for cancer sites with â¥10 exposed cases for both lifetime (LT) exposure days and intensity-weighted (IW) lifetime exposure days (accounting for factors impacting exposure).

In this retrospective study, we used novel computer-assisted software for automated detection/quantification of bone metastases by BSI. Patients with prostate cancer are M-staged by whole-body bone scintigraphy (WBS) and categorised as M0 or M1. Within the M1 group, there is a wide range of clinical outcomes. The BSI was introduced a decade ago providing quantification of bone metastases by estimating the percentage of bone involvement. Being too time consuming, it never gained widespread clinical use.  Patients and methods:   In all, 88 patients with prostate cancer awaiting initiation of androgen-deprivation therapy due to metastases were included. WBS was performed using a two-headed Î³-camera. BSI was obtained using the automated platform EXINI bone (EXINI Diagnostics AB, Lund, Sweden). In Cox proportional hazard models, time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and PCSS were modelled as the dependent variables, whereas prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score and BSI were used as explanatory factors. For Kaplan-Meier estimates, BSI groups were dichotomously split into: BSI <1 and BSI â¥1. Discrimination between prognostic models was explored using the concordance index (C-index).  Results:   The mean (range) age of the patients was 72 (52-92) years, the median (range) PSA level was 73 (4-5 740) ng/mL, the mean (range) Gleason score was 7.7 (2-10), and the mean (range) BSI was 1.0 (0-9.2). During a mean (range) follow-up of 26 (8-49) months, 48 patients became castration resistant and 15 had died; most (13) from prostate cancer.

Bioinformatic analysis of existing tumor genomic data from PCa patients revealed that WAVE complex gene alterations are associated with a greater likelihood of prostate cancer recurrence. Further analysis of primary vs. castration resistant prostate cancer indicate that disruption of WAVE complex gene expression, and particularly WAVE1 gene (WASF1) loss, is also associated with castration resistance, where WASF1 is frequently co-deleted with PTEN and resists androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

Recently, a number of studies have begun to define panels of diagnostically relevant markers to align patients into individual subgroups in an attempt to give information on prognosis and treatment response. We examined the immunohistochemical expression profile of 18 markers, each representing a putative role in cancer development, in 493 primary colorectal carcinomas using tissue microarrays. Through unsupervised clustering in stage II cancers, we identified two cluster groups that are broadly defined by inflammatory or immune-related factors (CD3, CD8, COX-2 and FOXP3) and stem-like factors (CD44, LGR5, SOX2, OCT4). The expression of the stem-like group markers was associated with a significantly worse prognosis compared to cases with lower expression.

In this study, we found that the expression of mLST8, a required subunit of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and complex 2 (mTORC2), was upregulated in several human colon and prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. Knockdown of mLST8 significantly suppressed mTORC1 and mTORC2 complex formation, and it also inhibited tumor growth and invasiveness in human colon carcinoma (HCT116) and prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells. Overexpression of mLST8 induced anchorage-independent cell growth in normal epithelial cells (HaCaT), although mLST8 knockdown had no effect on normal cell growth. mLST8 knockdown reduced mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of AKT in both cancer and normal cells, whereas it potently inhibited mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 specifically in cancer cells. These results suggest that mLST8 plays distinct roles in normal and cancer cells, depending upon its expression level, and that mLST8 upregulation may contribute to tumor progression by constitutively activating both the mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways.""","""['Kyoko Kakumoto', 'Jun-Ichiro Ikeda', 'Masato Okada', 'Eiichi Morii', 'Chitose Oneyama']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['AKT inhibition overcomes rapamycin resistance by enhancing the repressive function of PRAS40 on mTORC1/4E-BP1 axis.', 'Disruption of the Scaffolding Function of mLST8 Selectively Inhibits mTORC2 Assembly and Function and Suppresses mTORC2-Dependent Tumor Growth In Vivo.', 'High prevalence of mTOR complex activity can be targeted using Torin2 in papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'Growth-factor dependent expression of the translationally controlled tumour protein TCTP is regulated through the PI3-K/Akt/mTORC1 signalling pathway.', 'Function of mTORC2 and its roles in hematological malignancies.', 'Anti-leukemic effect of menthol, a peppermint compound, on induction of apoptosis and autophagy.', 'Small biomarkers with massive impacts: PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling and microRNA crosstalk regulate nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'The role of the PTEN/mTOR axis in clinical response of rectal cancer patients.', 'CDK1/FBXW7 facilitates degradation and ubiquitination of MLST8 to inhibit progression of renal cell carcinoma.', 'Regulation of mTORC1 by amino acids in mammalian cells: A general picture of recent advances.']"""

During RALP, the patient must be in a steep Trendelenburg (head-down) position, which leads to a significant increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). The association of RALP with visual field sensitivity, however, has not been prospectively studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the visual field, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and optic disc morphology in 50 normal eyes of 25 male patients that underwent RALP.  Methods:   The subjects were 25 males among 33 consecutive patients who underwent uneventful RALP under general anesthesia in our hospital. Visual field tests using the Humphrey visual field analyzer 30-2 SITA-standard program were performed before, 7 days after, and 1-3 months after RALP. IOP was measured before, during, and after RALP; and ophthalmologic examinations, including slit-lamp, fundus examination, and optical coherence tomography (OCT), were scheduled before and 7 days after surgery.  Results:   IOP was significantly increased during RALP up to 29.4 mmHg (P<0.01). Postoperative local visual field defects were detected in 7 eyes of 7 subjects dominantly in the lower hemifield without abnormal findings in the optic nerve head or retina, and the visual field recovered to normal within 3 months after surgery. General factors associated with RALP, IOP, RNFL thickness, or optic disc parameters did not differ significantly between eyes with and without postoperative visual field defects, and parameters of OCT measurements were not altered after surgery.  Conclusion:   Transient but significant unilateral visual field defects were found in 28% of the subjects examined. The probable cause are the increased IOP and altered perfusion during surgery and ophthalmologic examinations are therefore suggested before and after RALP.""","""['Yukako Taketani', 'Chihiro Mayama', 'Noriyuki Suzuki', 'Akiko Wada', 'Tatsuhiro Oka', 'Kazuya Inamochi', 'Yohei Nomoto']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Ocular parameters before and after steep Trendelenburg positioning for robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'The Effect of Steep Trendelenburg Positioning on Retinal Structure and Function during Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Procedures.', 'Cardiovascular and respiratory effects of the degree of head-down angle during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Aiming for zero blindness.', 'A challenge to primary open-angle glaucoma including normal-pressure.

In this study, the anti-cancer activities of these compounds were evaluated on HT-29 colon cancer cells. ET, EA, UA and UB inhibited the proliferation of the cancer cells. EA caused a slight, but significant cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, and urolithins caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and upregulated p21 expression. Apoptotic cells were detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI assay when treated with the compounds. Disruption in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspases 8 and 9 suggest that both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways may be involved. Activation of caspase 3 and cleavage of PARP further confirmed the induction of the apoptosis.

Based on the detailed findings, this paper suggests that important insights into the broader goals of advanced cancer patients are offered by allied health staff, and that more effective use of the multidisciplinary team may support endeavours to achieve more home deaths for cancer patients who want this outcome. The analysis also provides new insights into the meaning of 'home' in interactions between advanced cancer patients and health professionals. The wish for 'home' appears bound up with other patient goals and the implications of this are discussed.""","""['Adam Bostanci', 'Dell Horey', 'Kate Jackson', 'Leeroy William', 'Lise Pittmann', 'Jennifer Ward', 'Gaye Moore', 'Peter Martin', 'Peter Hudson', 'Jennifer Philip']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Care (Engl)""","""['Patients with pancreatic cancer and relatives talk about preferred place of death and what influenced their preferences: a qualitative study.', 'Place of death: hospital-based advanced home care versus conventional care.

As genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants, so metabolomic profiling of blood and other tissues represents an agnostic, ""broad-spectrum"" approach for examining potential metabolic biomarkers of prostate cancer risk. To this end, we conducted a prospective analysis of prostate cancer within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort based on 200 cases (100 aggressive) and 200 controls (age- and blood collection date-matched) with fasting serum collected up to 20 years prior to case diagnoses. Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy identified 626 compounds detected in >95% of the men and the odds ratio per 1-standard deviation increase in log-metabolite levels and risk were estimated using conditional logistic regression. We observed strong inverse associations between energy and lipid metabolites and aggressive cancer (p = 0.018 and p = 0.041, respectively, for chemical class over-representation).

Methods:   Low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients underwent transperineal ultrasound-guided implantation of three gold fiducial markers and were treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy to 42 Gy (2 Gy/day). During the first nine fractions of treatment, pre- and post-treatment electronic portal imaging was performed to calculate intrafraction prostate motion. Patient-specific PTV margins were derived and a 30 Gy (3 Gy/day) intensity modulated radiotherapy boost was delivered (Total dose = 72 Gy in 31 fractions; EQD2 = 81 Gy, Î±/Î² = 1.4).  Results:   Thirty-three patients completed treatment and were followed for a median of 7.2 years (range, 1.2 - 9.5). Seven patients (21%) developed Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) late grade 2 GI toxicity and 1 patient (3%) developed late grade 2 GU toxicity. No patients developed late grade 3 GI or GU toxicity. To date, nine patients developed PSA relapse according to the Phoenix criteria.

However, recent evidence that DAXX represses several tumor suppressor genes, including the DAPK1 and DAPK3 protein kinases, and is up-regulated in many cancers argues that a pro-survival role may predominate in a cancer context. Here, we report that DAXX has potent growth-enhancing effects on primary prostatic malignancy through inhibition of autophagy. Through stable gene knockdown and mouse subcutaneous xenograft studies, we demonstrate that DAXX promotes tumorigenicity of human ALVA-31 and PC3 prostate cancer (PCa) cells in vivo. Importantly, DAXX represses expression of essential autophagy modulators DAPK3 and ULK1 in vivo, revealing autophagy suppression as a mechanism through which DAXX promotes PCa tumorigenicity. Furthermore, DAXX knockdown increases autophagic flux in cultured PCa cells. Finally, interrogation of the Oncomine(TM) database suggests that DAXX overexpression is associated with malignant transformation in several human cancers, including prostate and pancreatic cancers. Thus, DAXX may represent a new cancer biomarker for the detection of aggressive disease, whose tissue-specific down-regulation can serve as an improved therapeutic modality.

Various physiological and pathological conditions such as glucose starvation, inhibition of protein glycosylation and oxidative stress may cause an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy. Lacking proteosomal function on aggregates of unfolded proteins, ER stress may induce autophagic machinery. Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved process, is characterized by massive degradation of cytosolic contents. In the present study, our aim was to determine the time-dependent, ER-mediated apoptotic and autophagy induction of purvalanol in HCT 116 colon cancer cells. Fifteen micromoles of purvalanol induced a reduction in cell viability by 20 and 35% within 24 and 48 h, respectively. HCT 116 colon cancer cells were exposed to purvalanol, which activated ER stress via upregulation of PERK, IRE1Î± gene expression, eIF-2Î± phosphorylation and ATF-6 cleavage at early time-points in the HCT 116 colon cancer cells. Moreover, we determined that during purvalanol-mediated ER stress, autophagic machinery was also activated prior to apoptotic cell death finalization. Beclin-1 and Atg-5 expression levels were upregulated and LC3 was cleaved after a 6 h purvalanol treatment. Purvalanol induced mitochondrial membrane potential loss, caspase-7 and caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage following a 48 h treatment. Thus, we conclude that the anticancer effect of purvalanol in HCT 116 cells was due to ER stress-mediated apoptosis; however, purvalanol triggered autophagy, which functions as a cell survival mechanism at early time-points.""","""['Ajda Coker-GÃ¼rkan', 'Elif Damla Arisan', 'PÄ±nar Obakan', 'KÃ¼bra AkalÄ±n', 'Utku Ãzbey', 'Narcin Palavan-Unsal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA potentiates purvalanol-induced apoptosis in Bax deficient HCT 116 colon cancer cells.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, roscovitine and purvalanol, induce apoptosis and autophagy related to unfolded protein response in HeLa cervical cancer cells.', '20-O-(Î²-D-glucopyranosyl)-20(S)-protopanaxadiol induces apoptosis via induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in human colon cancer cells.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress responses in Leishmania.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress in ischemic and nephrotoxic acute kidney injury.', 'Targeting CDK1 in cancer: mechanisms and implications.', 'Purvalanol A induces apoptosis and reverses cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors and Their Therapeutic Potential in Colorectal Cancer Treatment.', 'The Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response Mediates Shikonin-Induced Apoptosis of 5-Fluorouracil-Resistant Colorectal Cancer Cells.', 'Autophagy is a double-edged sword in the therapy of colorectal cancer.']"""

Design:   Experimental trial comparing two randomized intervention groups with control.  Setting:   An exercise clinic at a university in Australia.  Sample:   87 prostate cancer survivors (aged 47-80 years) and 72 breast cancer survivors (aged 34-76 years).  Methods:   Participants enrolled in an eight-week exercise intervention (n = 84) or control (n = 75) group. Intervention participants were randomized to low-intensity (n = 44, 60%-65% VO2peak, 50%-65% of one repetition maximum [1RM]) or high-intensity (n = 40, 75%-80% VO2peak, 65%-80% 1RM) exercise groups. Participants in the control group continued usual routines. All participants were assessed at weeks 1 and 10. The intervention groups were reassessed four months postintervention for sustainability.  Main research variables:   VO2peak and self-reported physical activity.  Findings:   Intervention groups improved VO2peak similarly (p = 0.083), and both more than controls (p < 0.001). The high-intensity group maintained VO2peak at follow-up, whereas the low-intensity group regressed (p = 0.021). The low-intensity group minimally changed from baseline to follow-up by 0.5 ml/kg per minute, whereas the high-intensity group significantly improved by 2.2 ml/kg per minute (p = 0.01).

While conventional animal models have identified an array of potential anti-tumor therapies, mouse models often fail to translate into effective human treatments. Our goal is to establish a humanized tumor model as a more effective pre-clinical platform for understanding and manipulating TIL.  Methods:   The immune system in NOD/SCID/IL-2RÎ³null (NSG) mice was reconstituted by the co-administration of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) or subsets (CD4+ or CD8+) and autologous human dendritic cells (DC), and animals simultaneously challenged by implanting human prostate cancer cells (PC3 line). Tumor growth was evaluated over time and the phenotype of recovered splenocytes and TIL characterized by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Serum levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines were also assessed.  Results:   A tumor-bearing huPBL-NSG model was established in which human leukocytes reconstituted secondary lymphoid organs and promoted the accumulation of TIL. These TIL exhibited a unique phenotype when compared to splenocytes with a predominance of CD8+ T cells that exhibited increased expression of CD69, CD56, and an effector memory phenotype. TIL from huPBL-NSG animals closely matched the features of TIL recovered from primary human prostate cancers. Human cytokines were readily detectible in the serum and exhibited a different profile in animals implanted with PBL alone, tumor alone, and those reconstituted with both. Immune reconstitution slowed but could not eliminate tumor growth and this effect required the presence of CD4+ T cell help.  Conclusions:   Simultaneous implantation of human PBL, DC and tumor results in a huPBL-NSG model that recapitulates the development of human TIL and allows an assessment of tumor and immune system interaction that cannot be carried out in humans. Furthermore, the capacity to manipulate individual features and cell populations provides an opportunity for hypothesis testing and outcome monitoring in a humanized system that may be more relevant than conventional mouse models.""","""['Michael D Roth', 'Airi Harui']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Reconstitution of huPBL-NSG mice with donor-matched dendritic cells enables antigen-specific T-cell activation.', 'Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes contain higher numbers of type 1 cytokine expressors and DR+ T cells compared with lymphocytes from tumor draining lymph nodes and peripheral blood in patients with cancer of the uterine cervix.', 'Development of HPV16 positive cervical cancer model in the hu-PBL-SCID mouse and its immunological features.', 'Interleukin-12 delivered by biodegradable microspheres promotes the antitumor activity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes in a human head and neck tumor xenograft/SCID mouse model.', 'Potential Pitfalls of the Humanized Mice in Modeling Sepsis.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.', 'Targeting transforming growth factor-Î²2 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide accelerates T cell-mediated tumor rejection in a humanized mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Blockade of HVEM for Prostate Cancer Immunotherapy in Humanized Mice.', 'Application of Animal Models in Cancer Research: Recent Progress and Future Prospects.', 'N-cadherin inhibitor creates a microenvironment that protect TILs from immune checkpoints and Treg cells.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   From June 2013 to March 2014, 55 prescreened men with a history of prostate cancer were prospectively randomized. VVs, with the patient at home or at work, were included in the outpatient clinic calendar of urologists.  Intervention:   Remote VV versus traditional OV.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   An equivalence analysis was used to assess the primary outcome, visit efficiency as measured by time studies. Secondary outcomes were patient/provider satisfaction and costs.  Results and limitations:   There were 28 VVs and 27 OVs. VVs were equivalent in efficiency to relative to OVs, as measured by patient-provider face time (mean 14.5 vs 14.3min; p=0.96), patient wait time (18.4 vs 13.0min; p=0.20), and total time devoted to care (17.9 vs 17.8min; p=0.97). There were no significant differences in patient perception of visit confidentiality, efficiency, education quality, or overall satisfaction. VVs incurred lower costs, including distance traveled (median 0 vs 95 miles), travel time (0 vs 95min), missed work (0 vs 1 d), and money spent on travel ($0 vs $48; all p<0.0001). There was a high level of urologist satisfaction for both VVs (88%) and OVs (90%). The major limitation was sample size.  Conclusions:   VV in the ambulatory postprostatectomy setting may have a future role in health care delivery models.

Understanding this heterogeneity at the molecular level and the resulting clinical impact is a critical step necessary for risk stratification. Defining genomic fingerprint elucidates molecular variation and may improve PCa risk stratification, providing more accurate prognostic information of tumour aggressiveness (or lethality) for prognostic biomarker development. Therefore, we explored transcriptomic differences between patients with indolent disease outcome and patients who developed metastasis post-radical prostatectomy using genome-wide expression data in the post radical prostatectomy clinical space before metastatic spread.  Results:   Based on differential expression analysis, patients with adverse pathological findings who are at higher risk of developing metastasis have a distinct transcriptomic fingerprint that can be detected on surgically removed prostate specimens several years before metastasis detection. Nearly half of the transcriptomic fingerprint features were non-coding RNA highlighting their pivotal role in PCa progression. Protein-coding RNA features in the fingerprint are involved in multiple pathways including cell cycle, chromosome structure maintenance and cytoskeleton organisation. The metastatic transcriptomic fingerprint was determined in independent cohorts verifying the association between the fingerprint and metastatic patients. Further, the fingerprint was confirmed in metastasis lesions demonstrating that the fingerprint represents early metastatic transcriptomic changes, suggesting its utility as a prognostic tool to predict metastasis and provide clinical value in the early radical prostatectomy setting.  Conclusions:   Here, we show that transcriptomic patterns of metastatic PCa exist that can be detected early after radical prostatectomy.

During the median follow-up period of 51.2, 44.8, and 45.5 months, secondary BC occurred in 14 (2.2%), 5 (1.1%), and 0 (0%) of patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy, surgical therapy, and primary ADT, respectively. The 10-year BC-free survival rate was 91.3% in the radiotherapy group, 97.4% in the surgical therapy group, and 100% in the primary ADT group. The rates of intravesical recurrence, progression to muscle-invasive BC, and BC-specific death might be higher in secondary BC after radiotherapy compared with after surgical therapy. There was a significant difference in the incidence of secondary BC among different therapeutic modalities for prostate cancer in Japanese men, indicating significantly lower comorbidity rates of secondary BC after primary ADT for prostate cancer compared with radiotherapy.""","""['Masaki Shiota', 'Akira Yokomizo', 'Ario Takeuchi', 'Kenjiro Imada', 'Keijiro Kiyoshima', 'Junichi Inokuchi', 'Katsunori Tatsugami', 'Saiji Ohga', 'Katsumasa Nakamura', 'Hiroshi Honda', 'Seiji Naito']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Immediate versus deferred androgen deprivation treatment in patients with node-positive prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer and the risk of cardiovascular mortality.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy as primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: data from Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE).', 'Intermittent androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: a critical review focused on phase 3 trials.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy in nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients: Indications, treatment effects, and new predictive biomarkers.', 'The androgen receptor in bladder cancer.', 'The prognostic role of steroid hormone receptor signaling pathways in urothelial carcinoma.', 'Increased risk of bladder cancer in young adult men with hyperlipidemia: A population-based cohort study.', 'Impact of Androgen Suppression Therapy on the Risk and Prognosis of Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'High Androgen Receptor mRNA Expression Is Associated with Improved Outcome in Patients with High-Risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.']"""

Although convenient, these drugs require monitoring for adherence, toxicity, and drug interactions to maximize outcomes. Oncology pharmacists have the training and expertise that place them in an optimal position to collaboratively provide medication therapy management.  Methods:   A board-certified oncology pharmacist, working in collaboration with a medical oncologist, initiated an oral chemotherapy-monitoring program. The pharmacist provided education, completed medication therapy management; monitored for adherence and toxicity; and recommended treatment of toxicity and supportive care issues. Patient encounters included one of the following: collaboration with medical oncologist visit, pharmacist visit, or telephone or email follow-up between visits.  Results:   From December 2012 to May 2014, the pharmacist had 123 encounters with 20 patients with either metastatic prostate (n = 17) or renal cell cancer (n = 3). All patients were males (median age 80 years). Most encounters were clinic visits, in collaboration with physician visit or alone (52%); 36% were telephone encounters, and 11.3% were email follow-ups. Medication-related problems were identified in 25% of the 315 assessments made. Problems included: adverse drug reactions, 40%; inappropriate therapy, 20%; and noncompliance, 18%. Recommendations included: modification of laboratory monitoring, 25%; cancer or non-cancer therapy modification, 12%; drug discontinuation, 6.9%. Non-cancer therapy-related drug information and coordination of care accounted for 30% of recommendations.

It is unknown whether these associations originate in early life. Therefore, we investigated if childhood height, body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)) and growth are associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality and survival.  Methods:   Subjects were 125,208 men from the Copenhagen School Health Records Register, born 1930-1969 with height and weight measurements at ages 7-13years. Linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry and the Register of Causes of Death enabled identification of incident and fatal prostate cancers. Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed.  Results:   630 men had prostate cancer recorded as the underlying cause of death. Childhood height at age 13years was positively associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio [HR]per z-score=1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.3). Associations were significant at all other childhood ages. Growth analyses showed that height at age 13years had a stronger association with prostate cancer-specific mortality than height at age 7, suggesting the association at age 7 is largely mediated through later childhood height. The tallest boys at age 13years had a significantly worse survival, but only when restricted to a diagnosis at <60years of age (HRz-score of 1=1.7, 95% CI: 1.3-2.4). These associations were significant at all other childhood ages. Childhood BMI was not associated with prostate cancer mortality or survival.

However, studies evaluating its role clinically have shown conflicting results. We investigated simultaneously multiple aspects of ERG, namely, ""presence"" and ""strength"" of ERG expression and ""correlation"" of ERG with other common clinicopathological parameters.  Materials and methods:   From January 2012 to November 2013, the status of ERG, androgen receptor (AR), and p53 was prospectively determined by immunohistochemistry unselectively in all types of specimens positive for prostate cancer. ""Strength"" of expression was measured in terms of ""intensity"" as well as ""percentage positivity,"" with each parameter given a score from 0 to 3 based on fixed protocol, which was tested for interrater variability as well as test-retest reliability. Data were collected for age, Gleason score, prostate specific antigen levels, presence of perineural invasion and lymphovascular invasion, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and cancer stage.  Results:   In total, 100 specimens were analyzed, and overall 51 patients had ERG-positive immunostaining. ERG-positive tumors had lower presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and p53 positivity, with no significant difference in prostate specific antigen levels, Gleason scores, and presence of lymphovascular invasion. Moreover, 54 patients had complete stage information, and the absolute number of patients with ERG positivity increased with increasing clinical stage. Among these, 30 patients were ERG positive, and ERG score had strong positive correlation with AR expression (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.677). However, median ERG scores showed a significant decline (consistent across percentage positivity and intensity) in patients with stage 4 disease, and score â¤ 2 had 88.2% specificity in identifying patient with stage 4 disease. Cohen×³s Îº = 0.81, whereas intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.95, indicating substantial agreement and near-perfect reproducibility of scoring scheme for immunohistochemistry.  Conclusion:   ERG-positive tumors increase in proportion with increasing stage of disease, but strength of ERG expression in ERG-positive patients shows a significant decline, or ""loss,"" in patients with stage 4 disease.

Methods:   Between January 2011 and December 2014, 100 consecutive patients (47-77) with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent APFP excision during RARP at a single institute. Extended pelvic lymph node dissection was also performed to moderate- and high-risk patients (86 patients). Preoperative and postoperative findings were recorded, and descriptive analyses and multivariable analyses to predict the presence of lymph node within APFP were performed.  Results:   Lymph nodes within APFP were detected in nine (9 %) patients. None of the patients had metastatic lymph node in APFP. Preoperatively, mean PSA levels (14.22 vs. 8.6, p = 0.0001), biopsy Gleason score (p = 0.002) and radical prostatectomy pathology Gleason score (p = 0.001) were higher in patients with lymph nodes at the APFP tissue.

Although many cancer patients report psychosocial distress that could be alleviated by supportive services including palliative care, patients often decline such services for reasons that are poorly understood. Research on decision-making suggests that during periods of acute distress, individuals have more difficulty prioritizing long-term over immediate gains. Thus, distressed cancer patients may prioritize immediate gains (e.g., avoidance of palliative care discussions in the moment) over longer-term gains (e.g., improved quality of life in the future).  Method:   This study investigated the associations between psychosocial distress, difficulties with delay of gratification (tendency to prioritize short-term over longer-term gains), and preference for palliative care in a sample of 212 men with a history of prostate cancer (94% white men and 27% advanced stage, age M = 62, SD = 8). It was hypothesized that psychosocial distress would be associated with lower preferences for palliative care, and this association would be explained, in part, by difficulty delaying gratification. Self-report measures included the depression anxiety stress scales, delay of gratification inventory, and ratings on an item assessing preferences for palliative care.  Results:   Consistent with the hypothesis, mediation models confirmed that the association of psychosocial distress with lower preference for palliative care was mediated by delay of gratification.

Methods and materials:   Between August 2007 and October 2008, patients considered for radiation therapy (RT) after prostatectomy were enrolled. The clinical target volume (prostate bed) was delineated according to published consensus guidelines, and patients were prescribed a dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions. Radiation treatment planning prioritized rectal dose constraints over target volume coverage. Treatment was delivered by use of IMRT and daily cone beam computed tomographic guidance. Toxicity (graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) and HRQOL assessments according to the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire were collected prospectively at baseline, at week 5 (during RT), at 3 months, and at yearly follow-up visits. Cumulative toxicity and biochemical relapse-free rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Paired Student t tests with multiple testing correction were used to assess changes in HRQOL.  Results:   A total of 68 men were evaluated, with median follow-up of 5.9 years. Fifty-three patients (77.9%) and 15 patients (22.1%) were treated with salvage and adjuvant RT, respectively. Primary planning objectives were met in most cases (97.1%), but planning target volume coverage was compromised in 40% of cases because of large planning target volumes (mean 347.6 cm(3)). There were no grade 3 or 4 acute toxicities. Cumulative 5-year incidence of late gastrointestinal and genitourinary grade 2 toxicities was 12.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.1%-13.5%) and 10.6% (95% CI, 9.5%-11.6%), respectively. No grade 3 or 4 late toxicities were observed. Transient declines in EPIC gastrointestinal domain summary score (mean 87.66 at 3 months vs 92.76 at baseline; P = .006) and genitourinary irritative subscale (week 5 mean score 83.37 vs 89.45 at baseline; P = .007) were observed. Complete recovery occurred between 3 and 12 months after therapy, remaining stable compared with baseline at 5-year follow-up. Sexual HRQOL remained stable at 5 years, with an improving trend in bother subscale. Biochemical relapse-free rate at 5 years was 72.7% (95% CI, 61.9%-83.5%).  Conclusions:   Guideline-based postprostatectomy image guided IMRT with rigid rectal dose constraints resulted in favorable toxicity profiles; long-term stability in gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and sexual HRQOL; and expected biochemical control rates.

Methods:   The ITs and corresponding imaging probes were tested in vitro against four solid tumor entities (rhabdomyosarcoma, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer). Specific binding and internalization of the ITs scFv2112-ETA' (from cetuximab) and scFv1711-ETA' (from panitumumab) were demonstrated by flow cytometry and for the scFv-SNAP-tag imaging probes by live cell imaging. Cytotoxic potential of the ITs was analyzed in cell viability and apoptosis assays. Binding of the ITs was proofed ex vivo on rhabdomyosarcoma, prostate and breast cancer formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies.  Results:   Both novel ITs showed significant pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects toward the target cells, achieving IC50 values of 4 pM (high EGFR expression) to 460 pM (moderate EGFR expression). Additionally, rapid internalization and specific in vitro and ex vivo binding on patient tissue were confirmed.  Conclusions:   These data demonstrate the potent therapeutic activity of two novel EGFR-specific ETA'-based ITs. Both molecules are promising candidates for further development toward clinical use in the treatment of various solid tumors to supplement the existing therapeutic regimes.""","""['Judith Niesen', 'Christoph Stein', 'Hannes Brehm', 'Grit Hehmann-Titt', 'Rolf Fendel', 'Georg Melmer', 'Rainer Fischer', 'Stefan Barth']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Novel PSCA targeting scFv-fusion proteins for diagnosis and immunotherapy of prostate cancer.', ""Recombinant anti-EGFR immunotoxin 425(scFv)-ETA' demonstrates anti-tumor activity against disseminated human pancreatic cancer in nude mice."", 'Cisplatin-resistant neuroblastoma cells express enhanced levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and are sensitive to treatment with EGFR-specific toxins.', 'Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor in solid tumors: critical evaluation of the biological importance of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.', 'Cetuximab: an epidermal growth factor receptor chemeric human-murine monoclonal antibody.', 'Enhanced cytotoxicity of a Pseudomonas Exotoxin A based immunotoxin against prostate cancer by addition of the endosomal escape enhancer SO1861.', 'A recombinant Der p 1-specific allergen-toxin demonstrates superior killing of allergen-reactive IgG+ hybridomas in comparison to its recombinant allergen-drug conjugate.', 'Expanding the Therapeutic Window of EGFR-Targeted PE24 Immunotoxin for EGFR-Overexpressing Cancers by Tailoring the EGFR Binding Affinity.', 'Reduced cytotoxicity by mutation of lysine 590 of Pseudomonas exotoxin can be restored in an optimized, lysine-free immunotoxin.', 'Targeted Toxins for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

AS1411 has shown promising clinical activity and is being widely used as a tumor-targeting agent, but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Previously, we showed that AS1411 is taken up in cancer cells by macropinocytosis (fluid phase endocytosis) and subsequently stimulates further macropinocytosis by a nucleolin-dependent mechanism. In the current study, we have investigated the significance and molecular mechanisms of AS1411-induced macropinocytosis. Our results indicate that the antiproliferative activity of AS1411 in various cell lines correlated with its capacity to stimulate macropinocytosis. In DU145 prostate cancer cells, AS1411 induced activation of EGFR, Akt, p38, and Rac1. Activation of Akt and p38 were not critical for AS1411 activity because Akt activation was not observed in all AS1411-responsive cell lines and knockdown of p38 had no effect on AS1411's ability to inhibit proliferation. On the other hand, activation of EGFR and Rac1 appeared to play a role in AS1411 activity in all cancer cell lines examined (DU145, MDA-MB-468, A549, LNCaP) and their inhibition significantly reduced AS1411-mediated macropinocytosis and AS1411 antiproliferative activity. Interestingly, downregulation of nucleolin expression by siRNA also produced a substantial increase in activated Rac1, revealing a previously unknown role for nucleolin as a negative regulator of Rac1 activation. Our results are consistent with a model whereby AS1411 binding to nucleolin leads to sustained activation of Rac1 and causes methuosis, a novel type of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis. We speculate that methuosis is a tumor/metastasis suppressor mechanism that opposes the malignant functions of Rac1 and that cancer cells may overexpress nucleolin to surmount this barrier.""","""['E Merit Reyes-Reyes', 'Francesca R Å alipur', 'Mitra Shams', 'Matthew K Forsthoefel', 'Paula J Bates']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['A new paradigm for aptamer therapeutic AS1411 action: uptake by macropinocytosis and its stimulation by a nucleolin-dependent mechanism.', 'G-quadruplex oligonucleotide AS1411 as a cancer-targeting agent: Uses and mechanisms.', 'Plasma membrane nucleolin is a receptor for the anticancer aptamer AS1411 in MV4-11 leukemia cells.', 'The nucleolin targeting aptamer AS1411 destabilizes Bcl-2 messenger RNA in human breast cancer cells.', 'Therapeutic applications of AS1411 aptamer, an update review.', 'Identification of new aptamer BC-3 targeting RPS7 from rapid screening for bladder carcinoma.', 'Aptamer functionalized nucleic acid nano drug for targeted synergistic therapy for colon cancer.', 'The fluorescence regulation of a tri-functional oligonucleotide probe HEX-OND in detecting Pb(II), cysteine, and K(I) based on two G-quadruplex forms.', 'Nucleolin promotes angiogenesis and endothelial metabolism along the oncofetal axis in the human brain vasculature.', 'Unlocking G-Quadruplexes as Targets and Tools against COVID-19.']"""

The link between AIRE functional mutations and multi-organ autoimmunity in human and mouse supports the role of pGE. Deep sequencing of the transcriptome revealed that mouse mTECs potentially transcribe an unprecedented range of >90% of all genes. Yet, it remains unclear to which extent these low-level transcripts are actually translated into proteins, processed and presented by thymic APCs to induce tolerance. To address this, we analyzed the HLA-DR-associated thymus peptidome. Within a large panel of peptides from abundant proteins, two TRA peptides were identified: prostate-specific semenogelin-1 (an autoantigen in autoimmune chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome) and central nervous system-specific contactin-2 (an autoantigen in multiple sclerosis). Thymus expression of both genes was restricted to mTECs. SEMG1 expression was confined to mature HLA-DR(hi) mTECs of male and female donors and was AIRE-dependent, whereas CNTN2 was apparently AIRE-independent and was expressed by both populations of mTECs.

Finasteride is a type-2 5Î±R inhibitor that is used as a human pharmaceutical for the treatment of prostate cancer, benign prostate hyperplasia and male pattern baldness. This study evaluated the impacts of finasteride (50, 500 and 5000Î¼g/L) on the development and reproduction of medaka (Oryzias latipes) exposed continuously over multiple generations (F0, F1 and F2). The exposure was initiated with reproductively mature fish (F0 generation) and continued until the hatching of the F2 generation. There were no significant effects on survival, fecundity or fertility in the F0 (50, 500, 5000Î¼g/L) and F1 (50, 500Î¼g/L) generations. The F1 generation exposed to 5000Î¼g/L exhibited significant mortality. Histopathology of the gonads demonstrated that medaka and pre-clinical species respond similarly to finasteride exposure. Intersex condition and maldeveloped gonads were observed in F0 generation males exposed to 5000Î¼g/L and F1 generation males exposed to 500Î¼g/L. F1 generation males exposed to 500Î¼g/L displayed reduced gonadosomatic index with an increased incidence of testicular degeneration. Males in both generations exhibited an increased incidence of Leydig cell hyperplasia at concentrations â©¾500Î¼g/L.

Recent studies suggest that hypercholesterolemia increases intratumoral androgen signaling in prostate cancer, but it is unclear whether androgen-independent mechanisms also exist. Since hypercholesterolemia is associated with advanced, castrate-resistant prostate cancer, in this study, we aimed to determine whether and how hypercholesterolemia affects prostate cancer progression in the absence of androgen signaling. We demonstrate that diet-induced hypercholesterolemia promotes orthotopic xenograft PC-3 cell metastasis, concomitant with elevated expression of caveolin-1 and IQGAP1 in xenograft tumor tissues. In vitro cholesterol treatment of PC-3 cells stimulated migration and increased IQGAP1 and caveolin-1 protein level and localization to a detergent-resistant fraction. Down-regulation of caveolin-1 or IQGAP1 in PC-3 cells reduced migration and invasion in vitro, and hypercholesterolemia-induced metastasis in vivo. Double knock-down of caveolin-1 and IQGAP1 showed no additive effect, suggesting that caveolin-1 and IQGAP1 act via the same pathway. Taken together, our data show that hypercholesterolemia promotes prostate cancer metastasis independent of the androgen pathway, in part by increasing IQGAP1 and caveolin-1.

Recently developed therapeutics that overcome tolerogenic mechanisms activate tumour-directed CTLs and are effective in some human cancers. Immune mechanisms also affect treatment outcome, and certain chemotherapeutic drugs stimulate cancer-specific immune responses by inducing immunogenic cell death and other effector mechanisms. Our previous studies revealed that B cells recruited by the chemokine CXCL13 into prostate cancer tumours promote the progression of castrate-resistant prostate cancer by producing lymphotoxin, which activates an IÎºB kinase Î± (IKKÎ±)-BMI1 module in prostate cancer stem cells. Because castrate-resistant prostate cancer is refractory to most therapies, we examined B cell involvement in the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance. Here we focus on oxaliplatin, an immunogenic chemotherapeutic agent that is effective in aggressive prostate cancer. We show that mouse B cells modulate the response to low-dose oxaliplatin, which promotes tumour-directed CTL activation by inducing immunogenic cell death. Three different mouse prostate cancer models were refractory to oxaliplatin unless genetically or pharmacologically depleted of B cells. The crucial immunosuppressive B cells are plasmocytes that express IgA, interleukin (IL)-10 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), the appearance of which depends on TGFÎ² receptor signalling.

Methods:   Between March 2012 and December 2014, 15 staged II-III patients with intermediate-high risk prostate cancer were enrolled in our protocol of DIL dose escalation by Tomotherapy. All patients were submitted to a multiparametric MRI (including DCE and DWI series), in order to visualize DILs. Considering a mean Î±/Î² ratio of 3 for prostate cancer the prescribed doses were: 83.2 Gy in 32 fractions of 2.6 per fraction (EQD2=93.2 Gy) on the DILs, 75.2 Gy in 32 fractions of 2.35 Gy per fraction (EQD2=80.5 Gy) on the prostate gland and 67.2 Gy in 32 fraction of 2.1 (EQD2=68.5 Gy) on the seminal vesicles.

Materials and methods:   Five-hundred twenty-eight patients with increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and/or abnormal digital rectal examination underwent transrectal ultrasound and initial PB between November 2012 and October 2013. We performed routine 12-cores extended PB, plus 2 anterior apex samples that were taken from the junction of urethra and apex of the prostate. Site-specific and unique cancer detection rate, tumor characteristics, the presence of clinically insignificant prostate cancer (PCa) (clinical stage â¤ T1, serum PSA level of < 10 ng/mL, biopsy Gleason score â¤ 6, number of positive biopsy cores â¤ 3 and no core with > 50% involvement) and biopsy-related pain were evaluated.  Results:   PCa was detected in 147 of 451 patients (32.6%). The lateral base of the prostate was the most affected area with 128 of 451 patients (28.3%), followed by unique cancer detection, with 17 of 40 patients (43.5%). Anterior apex (n = 6) was in third place after the lateral apex (n = 8). The patients diagnosed by anterior apex cores were all clinically insignificant PCa. The cancer diagnosis rate would be 31% if 12-cores biopsy was used, but the rate was found to be 32.6% in 14-cores biopsy (P = .016). Average biopsy pain, right anterior apex biopsy pain, and left anterior apex biopsy pain were found to register at 0.61, 1.06 and 1.08 points in the visual analog scale pain score, respectively. When right and left anterior apex biopsy pain is compared to average biopsy pain, the pain level was found to be statistically significantly higher in the biopsies of right and left anterior apex (P = .040 and P = .042, respectively).  Conclusion:   The gold standard for the diagnosis of PCa is at least 8 cores PB.

Thus multidisciplinary team management (MDTM) decision-making process appears as a tool to answer all aspects of PCa treatment. Our aim was to evaluate the reproducibility of therapeutic decisions made at MDTM.  Materials and methods:   We compared therapeutic decisions of PCa by presenting the same file of patient under a fake identity after 6 to 12 months from the first presentation. Forty-nine files of radical prostatectomy (RP) (28 pT2, 21 pT3) performed for clinical localized PCa were represented at MDTM which included urologist, oncologist, pathologist and radiologist. Analysis of therapeutic decisions comprised criteria such as: TNM stage, Gleason score, margin status and comorbidities. The reproducibility was assessed statistically by Kappa coefficient.  Results:   Study subjects included 49 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). The mean age was similar in pT2 and pT3 groups (P = .09). The mean serum PSA value was 8.32 ng/mL (range, 3.56-19.5) in pT2 group and 9.4 ng/mL (range, 3.8-22) in pT3 group. The margin status in pT2 and pT3 groups was positive in 25.0% and 47.6%, respectively. The decisions made at first and second MDTM for pT2 group were the same in 100% of cases with a perfect kappa coefficient (k = 1). In the group of pT3 (n = 21), the decisions were different in 33% at the second MDTM in comparison to the first MDTM. Especially for pT3b only 29% were reproducible decision with a slight agreement (k = 0.1). Concerning pT3a, 86% of the decisions were reproducible with a substantial agreement (k = 0.74).

In epithelial carcinomas, a key process in metastatic progression is the epigenetic reprogramming of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like (EMT) change towards invasive cellular phenotypes. In non-epithelial cancers, different mechanisms must underlie metastatic change, but relatively little is known about the factors involved. Here, we identify the chromatin regulatory Sirtuin factor SIRT7 as a key regulator of metastatic phenotypes in both epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cells. In epithelial prostate carcinomas, high SIRT7 levels are associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, metastatic disease, and poor patient prognosis, and depletion of SIRT7 can reprogram these cells to a less aggressive phenotype. Interestingly, SIRT7 is also important for maintaining the invasiveness and metastatic potential of non-epithelial sarcoma cells. Moreover, SIRT7 inactivation dramatically suppresses cancer cell metastasis in vivo, independent of changes in primary tumor growth. Mechanistically, we also uncover a novel link between SIRT7 and its family member SIRT1, providing the first demonstration of direct interaction and functional interplay between two mammalian sirtuins. Together with previous work, our findings highlight the broad role of SIRT7 in maintaining the metastatic cellular phenotype in diverse cancers.""","""['Shivani Malik', 'Lidia Villanova', 'Shinji Tanaka', 'Misato Aonuma', 'Nilotpal Roy', 'Elisabeth Berber', 'Jonathan R Pollack', 'Eriko Michishita-Kioi', 'Katrin F Chua']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Overexpression of sirt7 exhibits oncogenic property and serves as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer.', 'SIRT7 suppresses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in oral squamous cell carcinoma metastasis by promoting SMAD4 deacetylation.', 'SIRT7 antagonizes TGF-Î² signaling and inhibits breast cancer metastasis.', 'Epigenetic control of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis.', 'Sirtuin 7 in cell proliferation, stress and disease: Rise of the Seventh Sirtuin!', 'SIRT7 Downregulation Promotes Breast Cancer Metastasis Via LAP2Î±-Induced Chromosomal Instability.', 'Sorafenib/2800Z Co-Loaded into Cholesterol and PEG Grafted Polylysine NPs for Liver Cancer Treatment.', 'Shedding light on structure, function and regulation of human sirtuins: a comprehensive review.', 'The Mechanistic Roles of Sirtuins in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'USP17L2-SIRT7 axis regulates DNA damage repair and chemoresistance in breast cancer cells.']"""

The miRNA-302 family has been documented as playing a critical role in carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the role of miRNA-302a in prostate cancer (PCa). MiRNA-302a expression was detected in 44 PCa tissues and 10 normal prostate tissues, and their clinicopathological significance was analyzed. Cell proliferation and cell cycle analysis were performed on PCa cells that stably expressed miRNA-302a. The target gene of miRNA-302a and the downstream pathway were further investigated. Compared with normal prostate tissues, miRNA-302a expression was downregulated in PCa tissues, and was even lower in PCa tissues with a Gleason score â¥8. Overexpression of miRNA-302a induced G1/S cell cycle arrest in PCa cells, and suppressed PCa cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, miRNA-302a inhibits AKT expression by directly binding to its 3Î untranslated region, resulting in subsequent alterations of the AKT-GSK3Î²-cyclin D1 and AKT-p27Kip1 pathway. These results reveal miRNA-302a as a tumor suppressor in PCa, suggesting that miRNA-302a may be used as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in PCa.""","""['Gui-Ming Zhang', 'Chun-Yang Bao', 'Fang-Ning Wan', 'Da-Long Cao', 'Xiao-Jian Qin', 'Hai-Liang Zhang', 'Yao Zhu', 'Bo Dai', 'Guo-Hai Shi', 'Ding-Wei Ye']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Correction: MicroRNA-302a Suppresses Tumor Cell Proliferation by Inhibiting AKT in Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNA-302a functions as a putative tumor suppressor in colon cancer by targeting Akt.', 'MicroRNA-302a/d inhibits the self-renewal capability and cell cycle entry of liver cancer stem cells by targeting the E2F7/AKT axis.', 'Oncogenic microRNA-4534 regulates PTEN pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of the prognostic significance of microRNAs related to metastatic and EMT process among prostate cancer patients.', 'Prostate cancer and microRNAs: New insights into apoptosis.', 'Transplantation of IGF-1-induced BMSC-derived NPCs promotes tissue repair and motor recovery in a rat spinal cord injury model.', 'MIR133A regulates cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis by targeting SOX9 in human colorectal cancer cells.', 'Targeting Protein Kinases and Epigenetic Control as Combinatorial Therapy Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Differential expression of microRNA between triple negative breast cancer patients of African American and European American descent.', 'MicroRNA miR-145-5p inhibits Phospholipase D 5 (PLD5) to downregulate cell proliferation and metastasis to mitigate prostate cancer.']"""

We examine at-risk men treated only with RP until the time of metastasis.  Objective:   To evaluate whether clinicopathologic risk models can help guide postoperative therapeutic decision making.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate- or high-risk localized prostate cancer undergoing RP in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) era were identified (n=3089). Only men with initial undetectable PSA after surgery and who received no therapy prior to metastasis were included. APFs were defined as pT3 disease or positive surgical margins.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for time to event data was used to measure the discrimination performance of the risk factors. Cumulative incidence curves were constructed using Fine and Gray competing risks analysis to estimate the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) or metastasis, taking censoring and death due to other causes into consideration.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 43% of the cohort (n=1327) had APFs at RP. Median follow-up for censored patients was 5 yr. Cumulative incidence of metastasis was 6% at 10 yr after RP for all patients. Cumulative incidence of metastasis among men with APFs was 7.5% at 10 yr after RP. Among men with BCR, the incidence of metastasis was 38% 5 yr after BCR. At 10 yr after RP, time-dependent AUC for predicting metastasis by Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical or Eggener risk models was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.97) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67-0.97) in the APF population, respectively. At 5 yr after BCR, these values were lower (0.58 [95% CI, 0.50-0.66] and 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63-0.76]) among those who developed BCR. Use of risk model cut points could substantially reduce overtreatment while minimally increasing undertreatment (ie, use of an Eggener cut point of 2.5% for treatment of men with APFs would spare 46% from treatment while only allowing for metastatic events in 1% at 10 yr after RP).  Conclusions:   Use of risk models reduces overtreatment and should be a routine part of patient counseling when considering adjuvant therapy. Risk model performance is significantly reduced among men with BCR.

Next generation sequencing of the transcriptome of CAsE-PE cells identified multiple dysregulated genes. Of the most highly dysregulated genes, five genes that can be relevant to the carcinogenic process (S100P, HYAL1, NTM, NES, ALDH1A1) were chosen for an in-depth analysis of the DNA methylation profile. DNA was isolated, bisulfite converted, and combined bisulfite restriction analysis was used to identify differentially methylated CpG sites, which was confirmed with bisulfite sequencing. Four of the five genes showed differential methylation in transformants relative to control cells that was inversely related to altered gene expression. Increased expression of HYAL1 (>25-fold) and S100P (>40-fold) in transformants was correlated with hypomethylation near the transcriptional start site. Decreased expression of NES (>15-fold) and NTM (>1000-fold) in transformants was correlated with hypermethylation near the transcriptional start site. ALDH1A1 expression was differentially expressed in transformed cells but was not differentially methylated relative to control.

IL-18 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine expressed on various cells including prostate gland elements, and is a key mediator of immune responses with anti-cancerous properties. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is associated with tumour malignancy which causes immune escape.  Materials and methods:   The present study was conducted with 540 subjects, comprising 269 prostate carcinoma patients and 271 controls. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP and confirmed by real time PCR probe-based methods.  Results:   The findings indicated that the mutant heterozygous and homozygous genotype CC and GC+CC showed significant negative associations (p=0.01, OR=0.21; 95% CI: 0.08-0.51 and p=0.011, OR=0.43; 95% CI: 0.22-0.81, respectively) thus, less chance to be diagnosed as cancer against GG genotype of tobacco smoking patients. In addition, a heterozygous GC genotype at the same locus of IL-18 pro-inflammatory cytokine may aggravate the severity (OR=2.82; 95%CI 1.09-7.29 :p=001) so that patients are more likely to be diagnosed in advanced stage than with the GG wild homozygous genotype. Our results also illustrated that anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) genetic variants, although showing no significant association with susceptibility to cancer of the prostate, may gave profound effects on severity of the disease, as -819 TC (OR=4.60; 95%CI 1.35-15.73), and -592 AC (OR=5.04; 95%CI 1.08-25.43) of IL-10 in tobacco chewers and combined users (both chewers and smokers) respectively, are associated with diagnosis in more advanced stage than with other variants.

The sensitivity to therapy and invasion is the major obstacle for successful treatment in prostate cancer. We aimed to investigate the regulative effect of miR-128/zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 axis on prostate cancer cell chemosensitivity and invasion.  Methods:   The miR-128 expression pattern of prostate cancer cell lines and tissues was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, while the mRNA and protein expression levels of zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 were measured by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was used to find the direct target of miR-128. Furthermore, prostate cancer cells were treated with miR-128 mimic or zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1-siRNA, and then the cells' chemosensitivity and invasion were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and transwell assay, respectively.  Results:   We found miR-128 expression obviously decreased in prostate cancer tissues compared with paired normal tissues. Restored miR-128 expression sensitized prostate cancer cells to cisplatin and inhibited the invasion. Furthermore, there was an inverse expression pattern between miR-128 and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 in prostate cancer cells and tissues, and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 was identified as a direct target of miR-128 in prostate cancer. Knockdown of zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 expression efficiently sensitized prostate cancer cells to cisplatin and inhibited the invasion. However, ectopic zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 expression impaired the effects of miR-128 on chemosensitivity and invasion in prostate cancer cells.

A validation study was conducted on the lymph nodes of patients who underwent radical cystectomy.  Objective:   To classify the adenopathic state of a sample of patients who underwent cystectomy, based on the lymph node expression of FXYD3 and KRT20. The secondary objective was to assess whether there is a differential oncologic evolution for the patients, depending on the lymph node expression of these proteins.  Material and method:   The study included lymph nodes from 64 patients who underwent cystectomy for infiltrating bladder tumor: The model was developed using metastatic lymph nodes from 15 patients and lymph nodes from 4 patients with no known tumor. Genetic expression was measured using real-time qRT-PCR. We calculated (using qRT-PCR) the median expression of FXYD3 and KRT20 mRNA in the lymph node tissue. We then analyzed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, according to the function y=0.1400+0.250FXYD3-2.532. The cutoff was established using an ROC curve. The formula was applied to the remaining lymph node tissue, based on the previously established cutoff. The sample was classified into 4 subgroups: HE- qRT-PCR-, HE- qRT-PCR+, HE+ qRT-PCR+ y HE+, qRT-PCR-. A descriptive, comparative analysis was performed, as well as a metastatic progression-free survival analysis, calculating the Kaplan and Meyer curves for the 3 established subgroups. The test results were considered statistically significant at P<.05.  Results:   Using qRT-PCR, we verified that there were differences in the median expression of FXYD3 (P=.05) and KRT20 (P=.009) between the lymph node tissues of patients with benign prostate hyperplasia and those of patients with lymph node metastasis. A cutoff was assigned to 0.377. The sample was classified as follows: 37.5% of the patients were pN0 by HE and pN0 by qRT-PCR (-HE -qRT-PCR), 39.1% were pN0 by HE but metastatic by qRT-PCR (-HE +qRT-PCR), and 15 patients (23.4%) were metastatic by both techniques (+HE +qRT-PCR). The Kaplan and Meyer curves showed poorer metastatic progression-free survival for the patients who were +HE and +qRT-PCR than for the other subgroups, with no significant differences between -HE +qRT-PCR and -HE -qRT-PCR.  Conclusions:   According to our results, 39.1% of the patients with infiltrating vesical tumors overexpressed the FXYD3 and KRT20 biomarkers and were N0 by HE.

Results:   MiR-371 underexpression correlated with non-organ-confined (pT3) disease (P = 0.009). In vitro transfection of miR-371 reduced the levels of AR by 22% and 28% in LNCaP and PC3 cell lines, respectively, and in kallikrein 3, it was reduced by 51%. PC was induced in Balb/c mice using PC-3M-luc-C6 cells, and animals were treated with 3 local doses of miR-371. Tumor growth evaluated by in vivo imaging after luciferase injection was slower in animals treated with miR-371. To explore further the possible role of miRNAs in the AR pathway, LNCaP cell line was treated with 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone and flutamide showing alteration in miRNAs expression, especially miR-34a, which was significantly underexpressed after treatment with high doses of 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone.

Methods:   In study 1 and 2, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients (pts) were initially recruited into a once daily (QD) oral schedule (A). In study 1, pharmacokinetic assessments led to twice daily (BID) dosing (schedule B) to increase exposure. Study 2 explored a once daily schedule.  Results:   In study 1, 49 pts were treated with escalating doses of AZD3514 (A 35 pts, B 14 pts). Starting doses were 100 mg (A) and 1000 mg (B). The AZD3514 formulation was switched from capsules to tablets at 1000 mg QD. 2000 mg BID was considered non-tolerable due to grade (G) 2 toxicities (nausea [N], vomiting [V]). No adverse events (AEs) met the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) definition. Thirteen pts received AZD3514 in study 2, with starting doses of 250 mg QD. The most frequent drug-related AEs were N: G1/2 in 55/70 pts (79 %); G3 in 1 pt (1.4 %); & V: G1/2 in 34/70 pts (49 %) & G3 in 1 pt (1.4 %).

The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between plasma 25(OH)D3, African ancestry and CaP aggressiveness among AAs and European Americans (EAs).  Methods:   Plasma 25(OH)D3 was measured using LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry) in 537 AA and 663 EA newly-diagnosed CaP patients from the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP) classified as having either 'high' or 'low' aggressive disease based on clinical stage, Gleason grade and prostate specific antigen at diagnosis. Mean plasma 25(OH)D3 concentrations were compared by proportion of African ancestry. Logistic regression was used to calculate multivariable adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for high aggressive CaP by tertile of plasma 25(OH)D3.  Results:   AAs with highest percent African ancestry (>95%) had the lowest mean plasma 25(OH)D3 concentrations. Overall, plasma 25(OH)D3 was associated positively with aggressiveness among AA men, an association that was modified by calcium intake (ORT 3vs.T1: 2.23, 95%CI: 1.26-3.95 among men with low calcium intake, and ORT 3vs.T1: 0.19, 95%CI: 0.05-0.70 among men with high calcium intake). Among EAs, the point estimates of the ORs were <1.0 for the upper tertiles with CIs that included the null.  Conclusions:   Among AAs, plasma 25(OH)D3 was associated positively with CaP aggressiveness among men with low calcium intake and inversely among men with high calcium intake.

Emerging lines of evidence indicate that central sensitization is required for the development and maintenance of BCP. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of PI3KÎ³/Akt in the central sensitization in rats with tumor cell implantation in the tibia, a widely used model of BCP. Our results showed that PI3KÎ³ and its downstream target pAkt were up-regulated in a time-dependent manner and distributed predominately in the superficial layers of the spinal dorsal horn neurons, astrocytes and a minority of microglia, and were colocalized with non-peptidergic, calcitonin gene-related peptide-peptidergic, and A-type neurons in dorsal root ganglion ipsilateral to tumor cell inoculation in rats. Inhibition of spinal PI3KÎ³ suppressed BCP-associated behaviors and the up-regulation of pAkt in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion. This study suggests that PI3KÎ³/Akt signal pathway mediates BCP in rats. Central sensitization is required for the development and maintenance of bone cancer pain (BCP). In this study, we reported that PI3KÎ³/Akt mediated the function of ephrinBs/EphBs in the central sensitization under BCP condition, and inhibition of spinal PI3KÎ³ suppressed BCP-associated behaviors.

Serum total PSA, total testosterone, androstanediol glucuronide (3Î±-diol-G), estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were previously measured. Free testosterone was estimated by mass action. We applied sampling weights and calculated geometric mean PSA concentration by hormone quintiles adjusting for age and race/ethnicity, and also for body mass index, waist circumference, smoking, diabetes, and mutually for hormones. We estimated the OR of PSA â¥2.5 ng/ml per hormone quintile using logistic regression.  Results:   Geometric mean PSA increased across testosterone quintiles after age and race/ethnicity (Q1: 0.80, Q5: 1.14 ng/ml; P-trend = 0.002) and multivariable (Q1: 0.79, Q5: 1.16 ng/ml; P-trend = 0.02) adjustment; patterns were similar for free testosterone and 3Î±-diol-G.

Such chromosome end-to-end fusions are known to initiate genomic instability via breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Telomere dysfunction and other forms of genomic assault likely result in misregulation of genes involved in growth control, cell death, and senescence pathways, lowering the threshold to malignancy and likely drive disease progression. Shortened telomeres and anaphase bridges have been reported in a wide variety of early precursor and malignant cancer lesions including those of the prostate. These findings are being extended using methods for the analysis of telomere fusions (decisive genetic markers for telomere dysfunction) specifically within human tissue DNA. Here we report that benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and prostate cancer (PCa) prostate lesions all contain similarly high frequencies of telomere fusions and anaphase bridges. Tumor-adjacent, histologically normal prostate tissue generally did not contain telomere fusions or anaphase bridges as compared to matched PCa tissues. However, we found relatively high levels of telomerase activity in this histologically normal tumor-adjacent tissue that was reduced but closely correlated with telomerase levels in corresponding PCa samples. Thus, we present evidence of high levels of telomere dysfunction in BPH, an established early precursor (PIN) and prostate cancer lesions but not generally in tumor adjacent normal tissue. Our results suggest that telomere dysfunction may be a common gateway event leading to genomic instability in prostate tumorigenesis. .""","""['LiRen Tu', 'Nazmul Huda', 'Brenda R Grimes', 'Roger B Slee', 'Alison M Bates', 'Liang Cheng', 'David Gilley']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Telomere shortening is an early somatic DNA alteration in human prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Topographical analysis of telomere length and correlation with genomic instability in whole mount prostatectomies.', 'Epithelial and prostatic marker expression in short-term primary cultures of human prostate tissue samples.', 'Stem cell features of benign and malignant prostate epithelial cells.', 'Preneoplastic lesions of the prostate-clinical, pathological and molecular biological aspects.', 'An overview of the role of telomeres and telomerase in preâneoplastic lesions (Review).', 'High-throughput screen to identify compounds that prevent or target telomere loss in human cancer cells.', 'Race Differences in Telomere Length in Benign Prostate Biopsies and Subsequent Risk of Prostate Cancer.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia show shorter leukocyte telomere length but no association with telomerase gene polymorphisms in Han Chinese males.']"""

Results:   In a dose-escalation study (n = 140), enzalutamide half-life was 5.8 days, steady state was achieved by day 28, accumulation was 8.3-fold, exposure was approximately dose proportional from 30-360 mg/day, and intersubject variability was â¤30 %. In a mass balance study (n = 6), enzalutamide was primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism. Renal excretion was an insignificant elimination pathway for enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide. In a food-effect study (n = 60), food did not have a meaningful effect on area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of enzalutamide or N-desmethyl enzalutamide, and in an hepatic impairment study, AUC of the sum of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide was similar in men with mild (n = 6) or moderate (n = 8) impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B) versus men with normal hepatic function (n = 14). In a phase III trial, an exposure-response analysis of steady-state predose (trough) concentrations (C trough) versus overall survival (n = 1103) showed that active treatment C trough quartiles for 160 mg/day were uniformly beneficial relative to placebo, and no threshold of C trough was associated with a statistically significant better response.

However, several molecular mechanisms have been proposed on its chemopreventive action, the precise mechanisms by which RSV exerts its anti-proliferative effect in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells remain questionable. In the present study, we show that RSV activates autophagic cell death in PC3 and DU145 cells, which was dependent on stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) expression. RSV treatment decreases STIM1 expression in a time-dependent manner and attenuates STIM1 association with TRPC1 and Orai1. Furthermore, RSV treatment also decreases ER calcium storage and store operated calcium entry (SOCE), which induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, thereby, activating AMPK and inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway. Similarly, inhibition of SOCE by SKF-96365 decreases the survival and proliferation of PC3 and DU145 cells and inhibits AKT/mTOR pathway and induces autophagic cell death. Importantly, SOCE inhibition and subsequent autophagic cell death caused by RSV was reversed by STIM1 overexpression. STIM1 overexpression restored SOCE, prevents the loss of mTOR phosphorylation and decreased the expression of CHOP and LC3A in PC3 cells. Taken together, for the first time, our results revealed that RSV induces autophagy-mediated cell death in PC3 and DU145 cells through regulation of SOCE mechanisms, including downregulating STIM1 expression and trigger ER stress by depleting ER calcium pool.""","""['Senthil Selvaraj', 'Yuyang Sun', 'Pramod Sukumaran', 'Brij B Singh']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""[""3,3'-Diindolylmethane induces gastric cancer cells death via STIM1 mediated store-operated calcium entry."", 'Enhanced Stim1 expression is associated with acquired chemo-resistance of cisplatin in osteosarcoma cells.', 'The STIM1-Orai1 pathway of store-operated Ca2+ entry controls the checkpoint in cell cycle G1/S transition.', 'Role of TRPC Channels in Store-Operated Calcium Entry.', 'STIM and calcium channel complexes in cancer.', 'Resveratrol as sensitizer in colorectal cancer plasticity.', 'ORAI Calcium Channels: Regulation, Function, Pharmacology, and Therapeutic Targets.', 'Natural Compounds Targeting the Autophagy Pathway in the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.', 'Resveratrol used as nanotherapeutic: a promising additional therapeutic tool against hormone-sensitive, hormone-insensitive and resistant prostate cancer.', ""The Mystery of EVP4593: Perspectives of the Quinazoline-Derived Compound in the Treatment of Huntington's Disease and Other Human Pathologies.""]"""

Physical exercise has proven to be beneficial for prostate cancer patients, yet specific exercise offers are rare. The ProRehab Study aimed to evaluate the exercise program offered in rehabilitative prostate cancer sports groups in Germany and determine whether it is beneficial for patients following prostatectomy.  Methods:   Eighty-five prostate cancer patients were recruited for a multicenter, 2-armed, nonrandomized controlled trial 6 to 12 weeks after prostatectomy. The intervention group (n = 56) took part in a 15-month supervised multimodal exercise program. Exercise sessions took place once a week for 60 minutes at a moderate intensity (3.84-4.84 MET-hour). The control group (n = 29) received no intervention. Outcomes included aerobic fitness, activity levels, quality of life, disease- and treatment-related adverse effects, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, and relapse-relevant blood values. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.  Results:   A significant between-group difference was observed in the urinary symptom score (P = .027). Physical fitness, urinary incontinence, physical, role, emotional, and social functioning, as well as further disease- and treatment-related side effects (dyspnea, urinary, and bowel symptoms) significantly improved within the intervention group. Erectile dysfunction and physical activity levels improved similarly in both groups.  Conclusions:   The presented data hint at the potential of rehabilitative sports groups for prostate cancer patients. However, according to the current state of the art, exercise intensity and volume may need to be increased to enhance the effects. A number of shorter studies (8-24 weeks) have proven significant between-group differences in quality of life, incontinence, and fitness outcomes when patients exercised 2 to 3 times per week. This is the first exercise intervention study with prostate cancer patients that was conducted over 15 months.

Procedures:   Anti-MUC-1 mAb C595 was conjugated to an anionic linear globular dendrimer (ALGDG2). The polyethylene glycol core and citric acid shell were synthesized followed by loading with Gd(3+) to make novel contrast agents for functional MRI. The in vitro behavior and MRI parameters of the nanoconjugate were investigated performing several studies such as cell toxicity and TNF-alpha evaluations. The investigation of magnetic resonance imaging parameters indicated how well nanoconjugate performs in (1)H-NMR and (17)O-NMR in vitro.  Results:   Results showed a potential specific MRI activity by improving the swelling responses cell binding. The MTT (2-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-3,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay demonstrated that this contrast agent had significant cytotoxicity on prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   We included 118,665 men in the Korean Heart Study, a large prospective cohort study of participants who voluntarily underwent private health examinations that included PSA-based prostate cancer screening. The baseline visit occurred between January 1994 and December 2004, and follow-up was through December 2011. Deaths from prostate cancer were ascertained from the underlying cause of death from a computerized search of death certificate data from the National Statistical Office in Korea. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the association between serum PSA and risk of prostate cancer death adjusting the baseline age, cigarette smoking status, and body mass index.  Results:   During 1,381,901 person-years of follow-up, 6036 men died of any cause, and of these, 56 men died of prostate cancer. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio for prostate cancer death statistically significantly increased across PSA concentrations (P trend <.0001). The hazard ratio increased 7% per 1-ng/mL increase in PSA.

This study was conducted to investigate the presence and the roles of IDC-P in patients with metastatic CRPC.  Methods:   45 patients with initially diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer and then progressed to CRPC, were included. All of them were received twice transperineal biopsies at the time of initial diagnosis and the time of CRPC. All samples were retrieved to detect the presence of IDC-P. PSA doubling time (PSADT) was considered as a parameter presenting the progression of CRPC. The relationships between IDC-P and other clinicopathological variables were analyzed.  Results:   IDC-P was found only in 20% (9/45) cases at initial diagnosis, whereas, it increased to 62.5% (28/45) at the time of CRPC (Ï(2) = 16.568, P = 0.000). Compared to acinar adenocarcinoma components in tumor tissues, IDC-P components, especially solid subtype, had obviously poor/no response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In addition, among patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy (n = 24), patients with IDC-P also showed more unfavorable response than those without IDC-P (20% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.022). The presence of IDC-P and serum testosterone at the time of CRPC, were significantly associated with rapid disease progression. 13/28 (46.4%) CRPC with IDC-P had PSADT less than 30 days, while, only 1/17 (5.9%) patient without IDC-P had a less than 30 days PSADT (Ï(2) = 8.114, P = 0.004). Limitations included the relative short follow-up time and a relative small cohort.  Conclusions:   The presence of IDC-P was significantly associated with rapid progression of CRPC. And its presence could suggest the poor response to initial ADT and sequential docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Detection of IDC-P should be of importance in CRPC, and re-biopsy at the time of CRPC might be one of practical solutions.

Methods:   IELs were analysed in 59 autopsy prostates, which was routinely embedded in paraffin and immunohistochemically stained for CD3. An average of 300-500 ECs were counted per case. The number of IELs was calculated as the mean/100 ECs. Category IV prostatitis was evaluated using NIH consensus grading system in terms of anatomical localization and grade.  Results:   In healthy individuals the mean number of IELs/100 ECs was 0.61 Â± 0.34% or â¤1 lymphocyte/100 ECs, which is considered as the normal basal level of prostate IELs. In category IV prostatitis, the mean number of IELs/100 ECs was 8.53 Â± 3.25% or 5-11 lymphocytes/100 ECs. The number of IELs in both around and inside inflammation areas correlated to the grade and location of HP (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0003), the presence of acute glandular inflammation (P < 0.0001), the scattered stromal lymphocytes (P = 0.029), and BPH and PIN associated prostatic inflammation (P < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   The study presents the first attempt to examine and score the basic quantitative values of prostatic IELs in normal prostate and in relation to category IV prostatitis. The detected normal upper limit of CD3+ IELs is 1 lymphocyte/100 ECs in the normal prostate epithelium. This is considered as an organ specific characteristic of the prostate-associated lymphoid tissue (PALT). Values >5 IELs/100 ECs indicate the presence of category IV prostatitis. The severity of inflammation correlates to the number of IELs. There is an intimate link between the quantity of the IELs, the degree of the severity and the localization of category IV prostatitis. HP is a chronic and dynamic inflammatory process affecting the whole prostate gland. The increased number of IELs suggests the immune or autoimmune character of category IV prostatitis, BPH and inflammatory preneoplastic (PIN) lesions in the prostatic tumor environment.""","""['Dorian Dikov', 'Svitlana Bachurska', 'Dimitri Staikov', 'Victoria Sarafian']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Immunohistochemical expression of interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6 in patients with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia: association with asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis NIH category IV.', 'Comparison of prostate cancer gene 3 score, prostate health index and percentage free prostate-specific antigen for differentiating histological inflammation from prostate cancer and other non-neoplastic alterations of the prostate at initial biopsy.', 'Fluctuation in prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) score in men undergoing first or repeat prostate biopsies.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.', 'Prostate growth and inflammation.', 'PD-L1 positive lympho-epithelial lesions in inflammatory prostate.', 'Experimental autoimmune prostatitis: different antigens induction and antigen-specific therapy.', 'Human microbiome and prostate cancer development: current insights into the prevention and treatment.', 'The inflammatory microenvironment and microbiome in prostate cancer development.']"""

The purpose of the current study was to explore the Variation in insurance status by patient demographics and tumor site among nonelderly adult patients with cancer.  Methods:   A total of 688,794 patients aged 18 to 64 years who were diagnosed with one of the top 25 incident cancers (representing 95% of all cancer diagnoses) between 2007 and 2010 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were analyzed. Patient characteristics included age, race, sex, marital status, and rural or urban residence. County-level demographics included percent poverty level. Insurance status was defined as having non-Medicaid insurance, Medicaid coverage, or no insurance.  Results:   On multivariate logistic regression analyses, younger age, male sex, nonwhite race, being unmarried, residence in counties with higher levels of poverty, and rural residence were associated with being uninsured versus having non-Medicaid insurance (all P <.001). The highest rates of non-Medicaid insurance were noted among patients with prostate cancer (92.3%), melanoma of the skin (92.5%), and thyroid cancer (89.5%), whereas the lowest rates of non-Medicaid insurance were observed among patients with cervical cancer (64.2%), liver cancer (67.9%), and stomach cancer (70.9%) (P <.001). Among uninsured individuals, the most prevalent cancers were lung cancer (14.9%), colorectal cancer (12.1%), and breast cancer (10.2%) (P <.001).

Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is secreted from cancer cells, stromal cells, and adipocytes, and it is involved in prostate cancer progression. Here we investigated the biological role of MCP-1 secreted from adipocytes for prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Human pre-adipocytes (HPAds) were cultured and differentiated to mature adipocytes. Conditioned medium (CM) from HPAd cells was obtained using phenol red-free RPMI1640 medium. We performed a cytokine membrane array analysis to detect cytokines in the CM. To characterize the physiological function of MCP-1 in the CM, we performed an MTT-assay, a wound-healing and invasion assay with anti-MCP-1 antibody using three prostate cancer cell lines: DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities were evaluated by gelatin zymography. A qPCR and Western blotting were used to examine the mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-2.  Results:   The cytokine membrane array of the CM showed a strong signal of MCP-1compared to the control medium, and we thus focused our attention on MCP-1 in the CM. The CM up-regulated the cancer cell proliferation, and the neutralization by anti-MCP-1 antibody inhibited the proliferative effect of the prostate cancer cell lines. The CM greatly increased the invasive activity in the prostate cancer cell lines, and anti-MCP-1 antibody decreased the invasiveness. Gelatin zymography revealed that the CM markedly enhanced the enzymatic activity of MMP-2, and anti-MCP-1 antibody down-regulated its effect. MMP-2 mRNA expression was undetected and the MMP-2 protein level was unchanged between the control medium and CM in DU145 cells.  Conclusions:   MCP-1 from adipocytes enhances the growth and invasion activity of prostate cancer cells. The inhibition of MCP-1 derived from adipocytes might be an effective treatment for prostate cancer.""","""['Yusuke Ito', 'Hitoshi Ishiguro', 'Naohito Kobayashi', 'Hisashi Hasumi', 'Masatoshi Watanabe', 'Masahiro Yao', 'Hiroji Uemura']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['MCP-1 targeting: Shutting off an engine for tumor development.', 'Crude extract of Euphorbia formosana inhibits the migration and invasion of DU145 human prostate cancer cells: The role of matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 inhibition via the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 and their inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and -2, in primary cultures of human prostatic stromal and epithelial cells.', 'Gallic acid suppresses the migration and invasion of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells via inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 signaling pathways.', 'Multiple roles of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 in promoting prostate cancer growth.', 'Microbiome and Prostate Cancer: A Novel Target for Prevention and Treatment.', 'Role of adipocyte browning in prostate and breast tumor microenvironment.', 'Obesity-Related Cross-Talk between Prostate Cancer and Peripheral Fat: Potential Role of Exosomes.', 'Microenvironmental Factors Modulating Tumor Lipid Metabolism: Paving the Way to Better Antitumoral Therapy.', 'MCP-1 targeting: Shutting off an engine for tumor development.']"""

The close proximity of these lesions to the posterior capsular wall of the prostate makes them difficult to localize while increasing the need for early detection because of their increased risk for extracapsular extension. We retrospectively evaluated the multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) features of subcapsular prostate cancers to make radiologists more aware of this condition.  Materials and methods:   Between January 2010 and July 2014, all patients referred for 3T mpMRI and subsequent MR-US Fusion-guided biopsy (FgBx) and systematic 12-core sextant biopsy (SBx) under an IRB approved protocol, were reviewed, and imaging confirmed subcapsular prostate cancers were identified. Subcapsular lesions were defined as thin lesions that were just inside the prostate capsule. Matching patient demographics and clinical findings including age, PSA, PSA density, whole prostate volume, history of prostate cancer, Gleason score, and clinical management were tabulated.  Results:   Of 992 eligible patients, 33 patients had subcapsular lesions in the prostate detected by mpMRI. Mean age, PSA, and prostate volume in this group were 63 years (range: 52-76 years), 8.4 ng/mL (range: 1.22-65.20), and 53 mL (range: 12-125 mL), respectively. The combination biopsy (SBx + FgBx) confirmed prostate cancer in 24 of 33 patients (72.7%) and in 9 patients the biopsy was negative. Of the 24 cancers, 19 were confirmed on both FgBx and conventional biopsy; however, 5 cancers were only detected on FgBx. In 4 of the 19 patients in which both biopsy methods were positive, the FgBx yielded a higher Gleason score.  Conclusion:   Subcapsular lesions on mpMRI are relatively infrequent but are usually malignant. Although the majority are confirmed on conventional 12-core biopsies, about 20% of these lesions require FgBx for diagnosis, and FgBx more accurately grades the lesions in another 20%. Thus, FgBx is of considerable benefit in confirming the diagnosis of subcapsular prostate cancer despite their proximity to the prostatic capsule.""","""['Sandeep Sankineni', 'Arvin K George', 'Anna M Brown', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Maria J Merino', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Baris Turkbey']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Abdom Imaging""","""['Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naÃ¯ve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent MRI/ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy increase the detection of anteriorly located prostate cancers.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Recent advances in image-guided targeted prostate biopsy.', 'Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v 2.1: Overview and Critical Points.', 'MRI determined prostate volume and the incidence of prostate cancer on MRI-fusion biopsy: a systemic review of reported data for the last 20\xa0years.', 'MRI/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion-Guided Targeted Biopsy and Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Systematic Biopsy for Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Comparison of diagnostic performance and inter-reader agreement between PI-RADS v2.1 and PI-RADS v2: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Integration of spatial information in convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of intraoperative transrectal ultrasound images.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month dietary and physical activity intervention for prostate cancer patients receiving ADT, to help minimise these side effects.  Methods:   Patients (n = 94) were recruited to this study if they were planned to receive ADT for prostate cancer for at least 6 months. Men randomised to the intervention arm received a dietary and exercise intervention, commensurate with UK healthy eating and physical activity recommendations. The primary outcome of interest was body composition; secondary outcomes included fatigue, QoL, functional capacity, stress and dietary change.  Results:   The intervention group had a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in weight, body mass index and percentage fat mass compared to the control group at 6 months; the between-group differences were -3.3 kg (95% confidence interval (95% CI) -4.5, -2.1), -1.1 kg/m(2) (95% CI -1.5, -0.7) and -2.1% (95% CI -2.8, -1.4), respectively, after adjustment for baseline values. The intervention resulted in improvements in functional capacity (p < 0.001) and dietary intakes but did not significantly impact fatigue, QoL or stress scores at endpoint.  Conclusions:   A 6-month diet and physical activity intervention can minimise the adverse body composition changes associated with ADT.

We aimed to compare the oncological outcomes from ORP when a urology trainee as primary operator and is supervised by a high- or low-volume consultant urologist.  Methods:   Using a centralized whole of population dataset, created through the Victorian Radical Prostatectomy Registry, patients were classified as either those where a consultant was the primary operator, a urology trainee was the primary operator and supervised by a high-volume consultant or those where a urology trainee was supervised by a low-volume consultant. BF- and prostate cancer (PCa)-specific mortality was compared between these latter two groups and the consultant-only group.  Results:   We found BF- and PCa-specific mortality rate to be poorer when ORP was performed by a urology trainee supervised by a low-volume consultant compared with consultant-led surgery (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.33, P = 0.022; subhazard ratio (SHR) = 2.31, P = 0.010, respectively). When a urology trainee, as primary operator, was supervised by a high-volume consultant, there was no statistical difference in BF- or PCa-specific mortality rate following ORP compared with consultant-led surgery (HR = 1.19, P = 0.234; SHR = 1.53, P = 0.346, respectively). There was a trend evident with decreasing supervisor volume leading to worse oncological and mortality outcomes for trainee-led cases.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates the value of high-volume and fellowship-trained urologists in performing and teaching ORP.

In addition to its further characterization, as the clinical utility of IMMU-132 expands to an ever-widening range of Trop-2-expressing solid tumor types, its efficacy in new disease models needs to be explored in a nonclinical setting. Unlike most ADCs that use ultratoxic drugs and stable linkers, IMMU-132 uses a moderately toxic drug with a moderately stable carbonate bond between SN-38 and the linker. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry disclosed that Trop-2 is expressed in a wide range of tumor types, including gastric, pancreatic, triple-negative breast (TNBC), colonic, prostate, and lung. While cell-binding experiments reveal no significant differences between IMMU-132 and parental hRS7 antibody, surface plasmon resonance analysis using a Trop-2 CM5 chip shows a significant binding advantage for IMMU-132 over hRS7. The conjugate retained binding to the neonatal receptor, but it lost greater than 60% of the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity compared to that of hRS7. Exposure of tumor cells to either free SN-38 or IMMU-132 demonstrated the same signaling pathways, with pJNK1/2 and p21(WAF1/Cip1) upregulation followed by cleavage of caspases 9, 7, and 3, ultimately leading to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage and double-stranded DNA breaks. Pharmacokinetics of the intact ADC in mice reveals a mean residence time (MRT) of 15.4 h, while the carrier hRS7 antibody cleared at a similar rate as that of the unconjugated antibody (MRT â¼ 300 h). IMMU-132 treatment of mice bearing human gastric cancer xenografts (17.5 mg/kg; twice weekly Ã 4 weeks) resulted in significant antitumor effects compared to that of mice treated with a nonspecific control.

Taking advantage of a monoclonal antibody neutralizing extracellular S1P (sphingomab), we report that inhibition of S1P extracellular signaling blocks HIF-1Î± accumulation and activity in several cancer cell models exposed to hypoxia. In an orthotopic xenograft model of prostate cancer, we show that sphingomab reduces hypoxia and modifies vessel architecture within 5 days of treatment, leading to increased intratumoral blood perfusion. Supporting the notion that a transient vascular normalization of tumor vessels is the mechanism by which sphingomab exerts its effects, we demonstrate that administration of the antibody for 5 days before chemotherapy is more effective at local tumor control and metastatic dissemination than any other treatment scheduling. These findings validate sphingomab as a potential new normalization agent that could contribute to successful sensitization of hypoxic tumors to chemotherapy.""","""['Isabelle Ader', 'CÃ©cile Gstalder', 'Pierre Bouquerel', 'Muriel Golzio', 'Guillaume Andrieu', 'Santiago Zalvidea', 'Sylvain Richard', 'Roger A Sabbadini', 'Bernard Malavaud', 'Olivier Cuvillier']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['FTY720 (Fingolimod) Inhibits HIF1 and HIF2 Signaling, Promotes Vascular Remodeling, and Chemosensitizes in Renal Cell Carcinoma Animal Model.', 'When the sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine 1-phosphate pathway meets hypoxia signaling: new targets for cancer therapy.', 'Sphingosine kinase 1 pathway is involved in melatonin-induced HIF-1Î± inactivation in hypoxic PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Anti-S1P Antibody as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy for VEGFR TKI-Resistant Renal Cancer.', 'Hypoxia, therapeutic resistance, and sphingosine 1-phosphate.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 5 (S1P5) Deficiency Promotes Proliferation and Immortalization of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts.', 'Sphingosine Kinase-1 Is Overexpressed and Correlates with Hypoxia in Osteosarcoma: Relationship with Clinicopathological Parameters.', 'S1P Stimulates Erythropoietin Production in Mouse Renal Interstitial Fibroblasts by S1P1 and S1P3 Receptor Activation and HIF-2Î± Stabilization.', 'Nanomedicine in Oncocardiology: Contribution and Perspectives of Preclinical Studies.']"""

Sequencing-based genomic abnormality analysis revealed locus-specific gains or losses that were common in prostate cancer, such as 8q gains, AR amplifications, PTEN losses and TMPRSS2-ERG fusions. To estimate tumor burden in cfDNA, we developed a Plasma Genomic Abnormality (PGA) score by summing the most significant copy number variations. Cox regression analysis showed that PGA scores were significantly associated with overall survival (p < 0.04). After androgen deprivation therapy or chemotherapy, targeted sequencing showed significant mutational profile changes in genes involved in androgen biosynthesis, AR activation, DNA repair, and chemotherapy resistance.

Several predictive nomograms and novel genomic markers have been developed to estimate the risk of adverse pathology in men eligible for active surveillance (AS). However, oncologic risk associated with these findings remains unknown.  Objective:   To determine if the presence of adverse pathologic features at RP in patients eligible for AS is prognostic of poor oncologic outcome independent of pretreatment risk status.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 2660 patients underwent immediate RP at our institution between 1998 and 2008. Patients were stratified as low, intermediate, or high risk according to the D'Amico clinical risk criteria.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The rates of adverse pathology were reported, and the 5-yr risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) was calculated in the presence of aggressive disease.  Results and limitations:   The 5-yr risk of BCR in patients with extracapsular extension (n=937) was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40-46) overall but only 15% (95% CI, 11-22) for those who met the criteria for low risk (n=181). For the 473 patients with pathologic Gleason score 4+3, the risk of recurrence at 5 yr was 41% (95% CI, 37-46) overall, 13% (95% CI, 5-27) for low-risk men (n=41), 41% (95% CI, 35-47) for intermediate-risk men (n=287), and 51% (95% CI, 43-60) for high-risk men (n=145). Limitations include use of BCR as the study end point and surrogate for oncologic outcome in men who received curative treatment.  Conclusions:   The presence of pathologically unfavorable disease in patients eligible for AS is not informative as to the safety of this treatment modality. We question the relevance of adverse pathology as the end point for predictive tools designed to guide treatment decisions in low-risk PCa.  Patient summary:   The risk of biochemical recurrence associated with adverse pathologic findings at prostatectomy is reduced by approximately 50% in men with clinically low-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Mariam Imnadze', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Andrew J Vickers']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Definitive pathology at radical prostatectomy is commonly favorable in men following initial active surveillance.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Natural History of Clinical Recurrence Patterns of Lymph Node-Positive Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Positive surgical margin is associated with biochemical recurrence risk following radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis from high-quality retrospective cohort studies.', 'Biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: what does it mean?', 'MRI-derived tumor volume as a predictor of biochemical recurrence and adverse pathology in patients after radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matching study.', 'Normal preoperative endogenous testosterone levels predict prostate cancer progression in elderly patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic Impact and Clinical Implications of Unfavorable Upgrading in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Results of a Single Tertiary Referral Center.', 'Advanced age portends poorer prognosis after radical prostatectomy: a single center experience.', 'Adverse Pathological Findings at Radical Prostatectomy following Active Surveillance: Results from the Movember GAP3 Cohort.']"""

We developed what is to our knowledge a novel method to estimate prostate cancer volume using magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion, biopsy proven cancer core length.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 81 consecutive patients with magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion, targeted biopsy proven, clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy. As 7 patients each had 2 visible lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, 88 lesions were analyzed. The dimensions and estimated volume of visible lesions were calculated using apparent diffusion coefficient maps. The modified formula to estimate cancer volume was defined as the formula of vertical stretching in the anteroposterior dimension of the magnetic resonance based 3-dimensional model, in which the imaging estimated lesion anteroposterior dimension was replaced by magnetic resonance/ultrasound targeted, biopsy proven cancer core length. Agreement of pathological cancer volume with magnetic resonance estimated volume or the novel modified volume was assessed using a Bland-Altman plot.  Results:   Magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion, biopsy proven cancer core length was a stronger predictor of the actual pathological cancer anteroposterior dimension than magnetic resonance estimated lesion anteroposterior dimension (r = 0.824 vs 0.607, each p <0.001). Magnetic resonance/ultrasound targeted, biopsy proven cancer core length correlated with pathological cancer volume (r = 0.773, p <0.001). The modified formula to estimate cancer volume demonstrated a stronger correlation with pathological cancer volume than with magnetic resonance estimated volume (r = 0.824 vs 0.724, each p <0.001). Agreement of modified volume with pathological cancer volume was improved over that of magnetic resonance estimated volume on Bland-Altman plot analysis. Predictability was more enhanced in the subset of lesions with a volume of 2 ml or less (ie if spherical, the lesion was approximately 16 mm in diameter).  Conclusions:   Combining magnetic resonance estimated cancer volume with magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion, biopsy proven cancer core length improved cancer volume predictability.""","""['Toru Matsugasumi', 'Eduard Baco', 'Suzanne Palmer', 'Manju Aron', 'Yoshinobu Sato', 'Norio Fukuda', 'Evren SÃ¼er', 'Jean-Christophe Bernhard', 'Hideo Nakagawa', 'Raed A Azhar', 'Inderbir S Gill', 'Osamu Ukimura']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging determined tumor contact length for extracapsular extension of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'Reduced Core Targeted (RCT) biopsy: Combining multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging - transrectal ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy with laterally-directed sextant biopsies - An alternative template for prostate fusion biopsy.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Optimization of prostate biopsy: the role of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy in detection, localization and risk assessment.', 'A Comparative Study of Multiparametric MRI Sequences in Measuring Prostate Cancer Index Lesion Volume.', 'Future perspective of focal therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Impact of prostate-specific antigen screening on tumor size in patients with prostate cancer in a super-aging district in Kyoto, Japan.', 'Techniques and Outcomes of MRI-TRUS Fusion Prostate Biopsy.', ""Prostate cancer measurements on serial MRI during active surveillance: it's time to be PRECISE.""]"""

The FGF8b/FGF receptor (FGFR) system may therefore represent a target for the treatment of steroid hormone-regulated tumors. The soluble pattern recognition receptor long pentraxin-3 (PTX3) binds various FGFs, including FGF2 and FGF8b, thus inhibiting the angiogenic and tumorigenic activity of androgen-regulated tumor cells. Nevertheless, the complex/proteinaceous structure of PTX3 hampers its pharmacological exploitation. In this context, the acetylated pentapeptide Ac-ARPCA-NH2 (ARPCA), corresponding to the N-terminal amino acid sequence PTX3(100-104), was identified as a minimal FGF2-binding peptide able to antagonize the biological activity of FGF2. Here, we demonstrate that ARPCA binds FGF8b and inhibits its capacity to form FGFR1-mediated ternary complexes with heparan sulphate proteoglycans. As a FGF8b antagonist, ARPCA inhibits FGFR1 activation and signalling in endothelial cells, hampering the angiogenic activity exerted in vitro and in vivo by FGF8b. Also, ARPCA suppresses the angiogenic and tumorigenic potential of prototypic androgen/FGF8b-dependent Shionogi 115 mammary carcinoma cells and of androgen/FGF8b/FGF2-dependent TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells.

However, it has limited application in cancer therapy because curcumin undergoes rapid oxidative degradation at physiological conditions resulting in poor stability and bio-availability. In this study, we were able to suppress curcumin's oxidative degradation by encapsulating it in a nanoparticle that also acts as a radical scavenger. We prepared curcumin-loaded pH-sensitive redox nanoparticles (RNP(N)) by self-assembling amphiphilic block copolymers conjugated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging nitroxide radicals to ensure the delivery of minimally degraded curcumin to target regions. In vitro analysis confirmed that the entrapment of both curcumin and nitroxide radicals in the hydrophobic core of RNP(N) suppressed curcumin degradation in conditions mimicking the physiological environment. Evaluation of apoptosis-related molecules in the cells, such as ceramides, caspases, apoptosis-inducing factor, and acid ceramidase revealed that curcumin loaded RNP(N) induced strong apoptosis compared to free curcumin. Lastly, intravenous injection of curcumin loaded RNP(N) suppressed tumor growth in vivo, which is due to the increased bio-availability and significant ROS scavenging at tumor sites. These results demonstrated that RNP(N) is a promising drug carrier with unique ROS-scavenging abilities, and it is able to overcome the crucial hurdle of curcumin's limitations to enhance its therapeutic potential.""","""['Sindhu Thangavel', 'Toru Yoshitomi', 'Meena Kishore Sakharkar', 'Yukio Nagasaki']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['Reactive oxygen species-scavenging nanomedicines for the treatment of oxidative stress injuries.', 'Redox nanoparticle increases the chemotherapeutic efficiency of pioglitazone and suppresses its toxic side effects.', 'PNIPAAm-MAA nanoparticles as delivery vehicles for curcumin against MCF-7 breast cancer cells.', 'Recent advances in curcumin nanoformulation for cancer therapy.', 'Free Radicals as a Double-Edged Sword: The Cancer Preventive and Therapeutic Roles of Curcumin.', 'Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Applications of Curcumin: Update.', 'Delivery of curcumin within emulsome nanoparticles enhances the anti-cancer activity in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell.', 'Gasotransmitter-Induced Therapeutic Angiogenesis: A Biomaterial Prospective.', 'Prospects of Curcumin Nanoformulations in Cancer Management.', 'Polyethylene glycol triggers the anti-cancer impact of curcumin nanoparticles in sw-1736 thyroid cancer cells.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between 1998 and 2008, 467 patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network high-risk prostate cancer were treated with EBRT (n = 326) or combo (low-dose rate to 90-108 Gy using I-125 followed by EBRT) (n = 141). Freedom from biochemical failure, freedom from metastasis (FFM), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival were evaluated.  Results:   Combo patients were younger (66 vs. 72 years, p < 0.001) and had fewer comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity index 3.7 vs. 4.4, p < 0.001). EBRT patients had higher tumor stages (T3-4: 30% vs. 21%, p = 0.03) and lower Gleason scores (8-10: 61% vs. 75%, p = 0.01). Androgen deprivation therapy use was similar between cohorts (85% vs. 87%, p = 0.5), but EBRT patients had longer androgen deprivation therapy use (median 14 vs. 12 months, p = 0.05). GP5 predicted worse FFM (p < 0.001, hazard ratio [HR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.8-6.2]) and CSS (p < 0.001, HR 5.9, 95% CI 2.7-12.9) for the EBRT group, but not for the combo group (p = 0.86, HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.1-2.4 for metastasis and p = 0.5, HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.33-8.0 for CSS). In those with GP5 (n = 143), combo was associated with improved outcomes in all endpoints. On univariate analysis, 5-year outcomes for combo vs. EBRT were as follows: freedom from biochemical failure 89% vs. 65%, FFM 89% vs. 67%, CSS 93% vs. 78%, and overall survival 88% vs. 67% (p < 0.05 for all).  Conclusion:   Combo was associated with improved outcomes for men with GP5 prostate cancer. This highlights the importance of local therapy, especially in patients with the highest pathologic grade disease.""","""['Adam L Liss', 'Eyad I Abu-Isa', 'Maha S Jawad', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Sean M Vance', 'Raymond J Winfield', 'Vrinda Narayana', 'Howard M Sandler', 'P William McLaughlin', 'Daniel A Hamstra']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Use of androgen deprivation therapy with prostate brachytherapy-A systematic literature review.', 'Androgen Suppression Combined with Elective Nodal and Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy (the ASCENDE-RT Trial): An Analysis of Survival Endpoints for a Randomized Trial Comparing a\xa0Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Boost to a\xa0Dose-Escalated External Beam Boost for High- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Gleason pattern 5 is the greatest risk factor for clinical failure and death from prostate cancer after dose-escalated radiation therapy and hormonal ablation.', 'The addition of low-dose-rate brachytherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy decreases biochemical failure and prostate cancer death compared with dose-escalated external-beam radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiation for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Determining Combined Modality Dosimetric Constraints by Integration of IMRT and LDR Prostate Brachytherapy Dosimetry and Correlation with Toxicity.', 'Does brachytherapy boost improve survival outcomes in Gleason Grade Group 5 patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy?

We present most recently available data from the Benghazi Cancer Registry concerning cancer incidence and mortality as well as the most comprehensive survival data set so far generated for cases diagnosed during 2003 to 2005 in Eastern Libya.  Methods:   We collected and analyzed data on cancer incidence, mortality and survival that were obtained over a 3-year study period from January 1st 2003 to December 31st 2005 from the Benghazi Cancer Registry.  Results:   A total of 3307 cancer patients were registered among residents during the study period. The world age-standardized incidence rate for all sites was 135.4 and 107.1 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively. The most common malignancies in men were cancers of lung (18.9%), colorectum (10.4%), bladder (10.1%), and prostate (9.4%); among women, they were breast (23.2%), colorectum (11.2%), corpus uteri (6.7%), and leukemia (5.1%). A total of 1367 deaths for cancer were recorded from 2003 to 2005; the leading causes of cancer death were cancers of the lung (29.3%), colorectum (8.2%), and brain (7.3%) in males and cancers of breast (14.8%), colorectum (10.6%), and liver (7%) in females. The 5-year relative survival for all cancer combined was 22.3%; survival was lower in men (19.8%) than in women (28.2%).  Conclusions:   This study provides an updated report on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival, in Eastern Libya which may represent a useful tool for planning future interventions toward a better cancer control.""","""['Mufid El Mistiri', 'Massimiliano Salati', 'Luigi Marcheselli', 'Adel Attia', 'Salah Habil', 'Faraj Alhomri', 'Devon Spika', 'Claudia Allemani', 'Massimo Federico']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Ann Epidemiol""","""['Cancer incidence in eastern Libya: the first report from the Benghazi Cancer Registry, 2003.', 'Cancer mortality in Benghazi, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 1991-96.', 'Analysis of cancer incidence and mortality in Henan province, 2009.', 'Cancer in Libya--a retrospective study (1981-1985).', 'Primary bone tumour in eastern Libya--a 10 year study.', 'Libyan cancer patients at King Hussein Cancer Center for more than a decade, the current situation, and a future vision.', 'Notch signaling in female cancers: a multifaceted node to overcome drug resistance.', 'Global pattern and trends of colorectal cancer survival: a systematic review of population-based registration data.', 'Cancer incidence in the Tobruk area, eastern Libya: first results from Tobruk Medical Centre.', 'HER2 overexpression is a putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for late-stage colorectal cancer in North African patients.']"""
