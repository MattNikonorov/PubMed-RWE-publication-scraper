The success of this approach relies on the detection and delineation of tumors. The agreement among teams of radiation oncologists and radiologists delineating lesions on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) was assessed by measuring the distances between observer contours. The accuracy of detection and delineation was determined using whole-mount histopathology specimens as reference.  Material and methods:   Six observer teams delineated tumors on mp-MRI of 20 prostate cancer patients who underwent a prostatectomy. To assess the inter-observer agreement, the inter-observer standard deviation (SD) of the contours was calculated for tumor sites which were identified by all teams.  Results:   Eighteen of 89 lesions were identified by all teams, all were dominant lesions. The median histological volume of these was 2.4cm(3). The median inter-observer SD of the delineations was 0.23cm. Sixty-six of 69 satellites were missed by all teams.  Conclusion:   Since all teams identify most dominant lesions, dose escalation to the dominant lesion is feasible. Sufficient dose to the whole prostate may need to be maintained to prevent under treatment of smaller lesions and undetected parts of larger lesions.""","""['Peter Steenbergen', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Evelyne Lerut', 'Raymond Oyen', 'Liesbeth De Wever', 'Laura Van den Bergh', 'Linda G W Kerkmeijer', 'Frank A Pameijer', 'Wouter B Veldhuis', 'Jochem R N van der Voort van Zyp', 'Floris J Pos', 'Stijn W Heijmink', 'Robin Kalisvaart', 'Hendrik J Teertstra', 'Cuong V Dinh', 'Ghazaleh Ghobadi', 'Uulke A van der Heide']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Comparison of semi-automated and manual methods to measure the volume of prostate cancer on magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Multicenter validation of prostate tumor localization using multiparametric MRI and prior knowledge.', 'Multiparametric MRI Tumor Probability Model for the Detection of Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy: Pathologic Validation and Comparison With Manual Tumor Delineations.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Value of handcrafted and deep radiomic features towards training robust machine learning classifiers for prediction of prostate cancer disease aggressiveness.', 'Linac-based stereotactic salvage reirradiation for intraprostatic prostate cancer recurrence: toxicity and outcomes.', 'Inter-Observer Variability in MR-Based Target Volume Delineation of Uveal Melanoma.', 'Improving liver tumor image contrast and synthesizing novel tissue contrasts by adaptive multiparametric MRI fusion.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.']"""

Methods:   Cancer patients 6-13 months post-diagnosis (n = 4840) were recruited for the Measuring Your Health study. Participants were diagnosed between 2010 and 2013 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or cancers of the colorectum, lung, breast, uterus, cervix, or prostate. Four PROMIS physical function short forms (4a, 6b, 10a, and 16) were evaluated for validity and reliability across age and race-ethnicity groups. Covariates included gender, marital status, education level, cancer site and stage, comorbidities, and functional status.  Results:   PROMIS physical function short forms showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.92-0.96), convergent validity (fatigue, pain interference, FACT physical well-being all r ≥ 0.68), and discriminant validity (unrelated domains all r ≤ 0.3) across survey short forms, age, and race-ethnicity. Known-group differences by demographic, clinical, and functional characteristics performed as hypothesized. Ceiling effects for higher-functioning individuals were identified on most forms.  Conclusions:   This study provides strong evidence that PROMIS physical function measures are valid and reliable in multiple race-ethnicity and age groups. Researchers selecting specific PROMIS short forms should consider the degree of functional disability in their patient population to ensure that length and content are tailored to limit response burden.""","""['Roxanne E Jensen', 'Arnold L Potosky', 'Bryce B Reeve', 'Elizabeth Hahn', 'David Cella', 'James Fries', 'Ashley Wilder Smith', 'Theresa H M Keegan', 'Xiao-Cheng Wu', 'Lisa Paddock', 'Carol M Moinpour']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Reliability and validity of PROMIS measures administered by telephone interview in a longitudinal localized prostate cancer study.', 'Validation of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-57 and -29 item short forms among kidney transplant recipients.', 'Psychometric Evaluation of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue-Short Form Across Diverse Populations.', 'Standardizing patient-reported outcomes assessment in cancer clinical trials: a patient-reported outcomes measurement information system initiative.', 'Initial report of the cancer Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sexual function committee: review of sexual function measures and domains used in oncology.', 'Patient-reported distress at a cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Outcome Measures and Patient-Reported Metrics in Cancer Rehabilitation.', 'Effects of a Pragmatic Home-based Exercise Program Concurrent With Neoadjuvant Therapy on Physical Function of Patients With Pancreatic Cancer: The PancFit Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Trajectories of participation in daily life among individuals newly diagnosed with cancer: A 5-month longitudinal study.', 'Wearable sensor-based performance status assessment in cancer: A pilot multicenter study from the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (A19_Pilot2).']"""

Methods:   Between June 1, 2013, and June 1, 2014, we implemented an antimicrobial prophylaxis protocol using rectal swab cultures on selective media containing ciprofloxacin for all men scheduled for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. Data from 2759 patients from Jan 1, 2006 to May 31, 2013, before protocol implementation served as historical controls. Patients with fluoroquinolone (FQ)-susceptible organisms received FQ monotherapy, while those with FQ-resistant organisms received targeted prophylaxis. Our objective was to compare the rate of infectious complications 30 days after prostate biopsy before and after implementation of our antimicrobial protocol.  Results:   One hundred and sixty-seven patients received rectal swab cultures using our protocol. Seventeen (14 %) patients had FQ-resistant positive cultures. Patients with positive FQ-resistant culture results were more likely to have had a history of previous prostate biopsy and a positive urine culture in the last 12 months (p = 0.032, p = 0.018, respectively). The average annual infectious complication rate within 30 days of biopsy was reduced from 2.8 to 0.6 % before and after implementation of our antimicrobial prophylaxis protocol using rectal swab cultures, although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.13).  Conclusion:   An antimicrobial prophylaxis protocol using rectal culture swabs is a viable option for prevention of TRUS-guided prostate biopsy infectious complications. After implementation of an antimicrobial prophylaxis protocol, we observed a nonsignificant decrease in the rate of post-biopsy infectious complications when compared to historical controls.""","""['Stephen J Summers', 'Darshan P Patel', 'Blake D Hamilton', 'Angela P Presson', 'Mark A Fisher', 'William T Lowrance', 'Andrew W Southwick']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis using rectal swab cultures in men undergoing transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy is associated with reduced incidence of postoperative infectious complications and cost of care.', '""Targeted"" prophylaxis: Impact of rectal swab culture-directed prophylaxis on infectious complications after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Ciprofloxacin resistance in the faecal carriage of patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'The role of targeted prophylactic antimicrobial therapy before transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy in reducing infection rates: a systematic review.', 'Baseline prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and subsequent infection following prostate biopsy using empirical or altered prophylaxis: A bias-adjusted meta-analysis.', 'A prospective randomized comparative study of targeted versus empirical prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of infective complications following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Performance Validation of Selective Screening Agars for Guiding Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in Patients Undergoing Prostate Biopsy.', 'Chemoprophylaxis during transrectal prostate needle biopsy: critical analysis through randomized clinical trial.', 'The effectiveness of targeted relative to empiric prophylaxis on infectious complications after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a meta-analysis.', 'Evaluation of targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy: a prospective cohort trial.']"""

However, the role of MDC1 in modulating gene transcription independently of DNA damage and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully defined. Androgen receptor (AR) is the central signaling pathway in prostate cancer (PCa) and its target genes are involved in both promotion and suppression of PCa. Here, we functionally identified MDC1 as a co-activator of AR. We demonstrate that MDC1 facilitates the association between AR and histone acetyltransferase GCN5, thereby increasing histone H3 acetylation level on cis-regulatory elements of AR target genes. MDC1 knockdown promotes PCa cells growth and migration. Moreover, depletion of MDC1 results in decreased expression of a subset of the endogenous androgen-induced target genes, including cell cycle negative regulator p21 and PCa metastasis inhibitor Vinculin, in AR positive PCa cell lines. Finally, the expression of MDC1 and p21 correlates negatively with aggressive phenotype of clinical PCa. These studies suggest that MDC1 as an epigenetic modifier regulates AR transcriptional activity and MDC1 may function as a tumor suppressor of PCa, and provide new insight into co-factor-AR-signaling pathway mechanism and a better understanding of the function of MDC1 on PCa.""","""['Chunyu Wang', 'Hongmiao Sun', 'Renlong Zou', 'Tingting Zhou', 'Shengli Wang', 'Shiying Sun', 'Changci Tong', 'Hao Luo', 'Yanshu Li', 'Zhenhua Li', 'Enhua Wang', 'Yuhua Chen', 'Liu Cao', 'Feng Li', 'Yue Zhao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['The tumor suppressor ING1b is a novel corepressor for the androgen receptor and induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of MAPK-signaling pathway promotes the interaction of the corepressor SMRT with the human androgen receptor and mediates repression of prostate cancer cell growth in the presence of antiandrogens.', 'Determinants of Gli2 co-activation of wildtype and naturally truncated androgen receptors.', 'Identification and characterization of androgen receptor associated coregulators in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor and caveolin-1 in prostate cancer.', 'Recent Research Advances in Double-Strand Break and Mismatch Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer and Potential Clinical Applications.', 'Expression differences between proteins responsible for DNA damage repair according to the Gleason grade as a new heterogeneity marker in prostate cancer.', 'BAP18 facilitates CTCF-mediated chromatin accessible to regulate enhancer activity in breast cancer.', 'Multiomics approach to profiling Sertoli cell maturation during development of the spermatogonial stem cell niche.', 'Lysine Acetyltransferases and Their Role in AR Signaling and Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this paper, two neuropilin-1 (NRP) targeted peptides, CRPPR and ATWLPPR, were conjugated onto the surface of lipid microbubbles (MBs) to evaluate molecular imaging of tumor angiogenesis in a breast cancer model. Development of a molecular imaging agent using CRPPR has particular importance due to the previously demonstrated internalizing capability of this and similar ligands. In vitro, CRPPR MBs bound to an NRP-expressing cell line 2.6 and 15.6 times more than ATWLPPR MBs and non-targeted (NT) MBs, respectively, and the binding was inhibited by pretreating the cells with an NRP antibody. In vivo, the backscattered intensity within the tumor, relative to nearby vasculature, increased over time during the ∼6 min circulation of the CRPPR-targeted contrast agents providing high contrast images of angiogenic tumors. Approximately 67% of the initial signal from CRPPR MBs remained bound after the majority of circulating MBs had cleared (8 min), 8 and 4.5 times greater than ATWLPPR and NT MBs, respectively. Finally, at 7-21 days after the first injection, we found that CRPPR MBs cleared faster from circulation and tumor accumulation was reduced likely due to a complement-mediated recognition of the targeted microbubble and a decrease in angiogenic vasculature, respectively.

To cRGDfK peptide, succinoylated TPGS was synthesised and conjugated to cRGDfK peptide using a carbodiimide reaction. Peptide-conjugated DTX loaded nanomicelles (PDNM) displayed small particle size with a narrow distribution, controlled drug release and high physicochemical stability. Cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, apoptosis and anti-angiogenic comparisons of unconjugated nanomicelles to PDNM in DU145 human prostate cancer cells and HUVECs (Human Umblical Vein Endothelial Cells) clearly revealed the importance of the cRGDfK peptide in enhancing the drug delivery performance of nanomicelles.  From the clinical editor:   Common to many chemotherapeutic agents for cancer, systemic toxicity remains a big concern. In this article, the authors attempted to address this issue by conjugating RGD based peptides to Docetaxel, which would target integrins expressed on tumor cell surface. The experimental data revealed enhanced drug delivery.""","""['Hitesh Kulhari', 'Deep Pooja', 'Shweta Shrivastava', 'Srinivasa R Telukutala', 'Ayan K Barui', 'Chitta Ranjan Patra', 'Ganga Modi Naidu Vegi', 'David J Adams', 'Ramakrishna Sistla']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nanomedicine""","""['Formulation of Docetaxel by folic acid-conjugated d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate 2000 (Vitamin E TPGS(2k)) micelles for targeted and synergistic chemotherapy.', 'Trastuzumab-conjugated vitamin E TPGS liposomes for sustained and targeted delivery of docetaxel.', 'Co-delivery of docetaxel and chloroquine via PEO-PPO-PCL/TPGS micelles for overcoming multidrug resistance.', 'Development of docetaxel-loaded vitamin E TPGS micelles: formulation optimization, effects on brain cancer cells and biodistribution in rats.', 'Recent advances in TPGS-based nanoparticles of docetaxel for improved chemotherapy.', 'Bioinspired color-near infrared endoscopic imaging system for molecular guided cancer surgery.', 'Design and Synthesis of Amphiphilic Graft Polyphosphazene Micelles for Docetaxel Delivery.', 'Antimicrobial peptides CS-piscidin-induced cell death involves activation of RIPK1/PARP, and modification with myristic acid enhances its stability and tumor-targeting capability.', 'DOPE/CHEMS-Based EGFR-Targeted Immunoliposomes for Docetaxel Delivery: Formulation Development, Physicochemical Characterization and Biological Evaluation on Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Improving Anticancer Activity of Chrysin using Tumor Microenvironment pH-Responsive and Self-Assembled Nanoparticles.']"""

The best-characterized MSI1 target is Numb mRNA, whose encoded protein negatively regulates Notch signaling. Additional MSI1 targets include the mRNAs for the tumor suppressor protein APC that regulates Wnt signaling and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21(WAF-1). We hypothesized that increased expression of NUMB, P21 and APC, through inhibition of MSI1 RNA-binding activity might be an effective way to simultaneously downregulate Wnt and Notch signaling, thus blocking the growth of a broad range of cancer cells. We used a fluorescence polarization assay to screen for small molecules that disrupt the binding of MSI1 to its consensus RNA binding site. One of the top hits was (-)-gossypol (Ki = 476 ± 273 nM), a natural product from cottonseed, known to have potent anti-tumor activity and which has recently completed Phase IIb clinical trials for prostate cancer. Surface plasmon resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance studies demonstrate a direct interaction of (-)-gossypol with the RNA binding pocket of MSI1. We further showed that (-)-gossypol reduces Notch/Wnt signaling in several colon cancer cell lines having high levels of MSI1, with reduced SURVIVIN expression and increased apoptosis/autophagy. Finally, we showed that orally administered (-)-gossypol inhibits colon cancer growth in a mouse xenograft model.

The functional roles of these normal lincRNAs (nlincRNAs) in the regulation of protein coding genes in normal and disease biology are yet to be established. Here, we have profiled two RNA-seq datasets including cancer and matched non-neoplastic tissues from 12 individuals from diverse demography for both coding genes and nlincRNAs. We find 130 nlincRNAs significantly regulated in cancer, with 127 regulated in the same direction in the two datasets. Interestingly, according to Illumina Body Map, significant numbers of these nlincRNAs display baseline null expression in normal prostate tissues but are specific to other tissues such as thyroid, kidney, liver and testis. A number of the regulated nlincRNAs share loci with coding genes, which are either co-regulated or oppositely regulated in all cancer samples studied here. For example, in all cancer samples i) the nlincRNA, TCONS_00029157, and a neighboring tumor suppressor factor, SIK1, are both down regulated; ii) several thyroid-specific nlincRNAs in the neighborhood of the thyroid-specific gene TPO, are both up-regulated; and iii) the TCONS_00010581, an isoform of HEIH, is down-regulated while the neighboring EZH2 gene is up-regulated in cancer. Several nlincRNAs from a prostate cancer associated chromosomal locus, 8q24, are up-regulated in cancer along with other known prostate cancer associated genes including PCAT-1, PVT1, and PCAT-92. We observe that there is significant bias towards up-regulation of nlincRNAs with as high as 118 out of 127 up-regulated in cancer, even though regulation of coding genes is skewed towards down-regulation. Considering that all reported cancer associated lincRNAs (clincRNAs) are biased towards up-regulation, we conclude that this bias may be functionally relevant.""","""['Pushpinder Bawa', 'Sajna Zackaria', 'Mohit Verma', 'Saurabh Gupta', 'R Srivatsan', 'Bibha Chaudhary', 'Subhashini Srinivasan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Discovery and characterization of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNA) module biomarkers in prostate cancer: an integrative analysis of RNA-Seq data.', 'Integrative analysis reveals enhanced regulatory effects of human long intergenic non-coding RNAs in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Transcriptome profiling of prostate tumor and matched normal samples by RNA-Seq.', 'Long noncoding RNA in prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.', 'Targeting long non-coding RNAs in cancers: progress and prospects.', 'Long non-coding RNA HEIH: a novel tumor activator in multiple cancers.', 'MYC DNA Methylation in Prostate Tumor Tissue Is Associated with Gleason Score.', 'The Oncogenic Potential of the Centromeric Border Protein FAM84B of the 8q24.21 Gene Desert.', 'LncRNA HEIH regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis through miR-4458/SOCS1 axis in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'SNW1 is a prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer.']"""

We used relative survival and excess risk modeling to determine associations between diagnostic intervals and five-year survival. The survival of patients with colorectal, lung and prostate cancer was greater in those with alert, compared with non-alert, symptoms, but findings were opposite for breast cancer. Longer diagnostic intervals were associated with lower mortality for colorectal and lung cancer patients with non-alert symptoms, (colorectal cancer: Excess Hazards Ratio, EHR >6 months vs <1 month: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.72-1.00; Lung cancer: EHR 3-6 months vs <1 month: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.80-0.95; EHR >6 months vs <1 month: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.74-0.89). Prostate cancer mortality was lower in patients with longer diagnostic intervals, regardless of type of presenting symptom. The association between diagnostic intervals and cancer survival is complex, and should take into account cancer site, tumour biology and clinical practice.

Two of the five siRNAs tested were found to efficiently inhibit mRNA of both TMPRSS2-ERG variants and to decrease ERG protein expression. Microarray analysis further confirmed ERG inhibition by both siRNAs TMPRSS2-ERG and revealed one common down-regulated gene, ADRA2A, involved in cell proliferation and migration. The siRNA against TMPRSS2-ERG fusion variant IV showed the highest anti-proliferative effects: Significantly decreased cell viability, increased cleaved caspase-3 and inhibited a cluster of anti-apoptotic proteins. To propose a concrete therapeutic approach, siRNA TMPRSS2-ERG IV was conjugated to squalene, which can self-organize as nanoparticles in water. The nanoparticles of siRNA TMPRSS2-ERG-squalene injected intravenously in SCID mice reduced growth of VCaP xenografted tumours, inhibited oncoprotein expression and partially restored differentiation (decrease in Ki67).

As chemical treatments lead to cell cytoskeletal rearrangements, thereby, modifications of cellular mechanical properties, investigating cellular mechanical property variations provides insightful knowledge to effects of chemical treatments on cancer cells. In this study, the effects of eight different anticancer drugs on the mechanical properties of human prostate cancer cell (PC-3) are investigated using a recently developed control-based nanoindentation measurement (CNM) protocol on atomic force microscope (AFM). The CNM protocol overcomes the limits of other existing methods to in-liquid nanoindentation measurement of live cells on AFM, particularly for measuring mechanical properties of live cells. The Young's modulus of PC-3 cells treated by the eight drugs was measured by varying force loading rates over three orders of magnitude, and compared to the values of the control. The results showed that the Young's modulus of the PC-3 cells increased substantially by the eight drugs tested, and became much more pronounced as the force load rate increased. Moreover, two distinct trends were clearly expressed, where under the treatment of Disulfiram, paclitaxel, and MK-2206, the exponent coefficient of the frequency- modulus function remained almost unchanged, while with Celebrex, BAY, Totamine, TPA, and Vaproic acid, the exponential rate was significantly increased.""","""['Juan Ren', 'Huarong Huang', 'Yue Liu', 'Xi Zheng', 'Qingze Zou']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Mechanical properties study of SW480 cells based on AFM.', 'Mechanical characterization of living and dead undifferentiated human adipose-derived stem cells by using atomic force microscopy.', ""Evaluation of the elastic Young's modulus and cytotoxicity variations in fibroblasts exposed to carbon-based nanomaterials."", 'Cell stiffness determined by atomic force microscopy and its correlation with cell motility.', 'Applicability of atomic force microscopy to determine cancer-related changes in cells.', 'Atomic Force Microscopy Methods to Measure Tumor Mechanical Properties.', 'Emerging Diamond Quantum Sensing in Bio-Membranes.', 'Effect of paclitaxel treatment on cellular mechanics and morphology of human oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in 2D and 3D environments.', 'Substrate Stiffness Modulates the Growth, Phenotype, and Chemoresistance of Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Understanding the effect of mechanical forces on ovarian cancer progression.']"""

A new technology, quantum annealing (QA), employs novel hardware and software techniques to address various discrete optimization problems in many fields. We report on the first application of quantum annealing to the process of beamlet intensity optimization for IMRT. We apply recently-developed hardware which natively exploits quantum mechanical effects for improved optimization. The new algorithm, called QA, is most similar to simulated annealing, but relies on natural processes to directly minimize a system's free energy. A simple quantum system is slowly evolved into a classical system representing the objective function. If the evolution is sufficiently slow, there are probabilistic guarantees that a global minimum will be located. To apply QA to IMRT-type optimization, two prostate cases were considered. A reduced number of beamlets were employed, due to the current QA hardware limitations. The beamlet dose matrices were computed using CERR and an objective function was defined based on typical clinical constraints, including dose-volume objectives, which result in a complex non-convex search space. The objective function was discretized and the QA method was compared to two standard optimization methods, simulated annealing and Tabu search, run on a conventional computing cluster. Based on several runs, the average final objective function value achieved by the QA was 16.9 for the first patient, compared with 10.0 for Tabu and 6.7 for the simulated annealing (SA) method. For the second patient, the values were 70.7 for the QA, 120.0 for Tabu and 22.9 for the SA. The QA algorithm required 27-38% of the time required by the other two methods. In this first application of hardware-enabled QA to IMRT optimization, its performance is comparable to Tabu search, but less effective than the SA in terms of final objective function values. However, its speed was 3-4 times faster than the other two methods. This initial experiment suggests that more research into QA-based heuristics may offer significant speedup over conventional clinical optimization methods, as quantum annealing hardware scales to larger sizes.""","""['Daryl P Nazareth', 'Jason D Spaans']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Quantum-inspired algorithm for radiotherapy planning optimization.', 'A new Monte Carlo-based treatment plan optimization approach for intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'Modulated photon radiotherapy (XMRT): an algorithm for the simultaneous optimization of photon beamlet energy and intensity in external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) planning.', 'Quantum annealing for industry applications: introduction and review.', 'Quantum computing using continuous-time evolution.', 'Quantum-inspired algorithm for radiotherapy planning optimization.']"""

Recent studies have demonstrated that PPAR-γ ligands are anti-tumorigenic in prostate cancer due to anti-proliferative and pro-differentiation effects. The aim of this study was to validate PPAR-γ expression in malignant and benign prostate tissues by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 730 prostatic adenocarcinomas (PCAs) including 63 whole sections from radical prostatectomy specimens and tissue microarrays containing 667 PCAs were subject to immunostaining for two PPAR-γ antibodies. Twenty-five benign prostate tissues and PCAs were selected for investigating mRNA expression by quantitative real-time PCR. 10.7% of PCAs (78/730) showed cytoplasmic immunoreactivity of PPAR-γ and no nuclear immunoreactivity was noted in PCAs. Most benign prostatic glands showed negative immunoreactivity of PPAR-γ except for variable weak cytoplasmic staining in some glands. Nuclear immunoreactivity of PPAR-γ was noted some central zone and verumontanum mucosal epithelium. The constitutive PPAR-γ mRNA showed significantly lower level in PCAs compared to that in the benign tissues. There was no difference of PPAR-γ mRNA expression between low (≤7) and high (>7) Gleason score groups. There was no association of PPAR-γ mRNA level or cytoplasmic immunostaining with Gleason grade or pathologic stage. Our study supported the evidence of extra-nuclear localization and nongenomic actions of PPAR-γ.

ER-β has a tumor suppressor role in PCa and its levels decline with cancer progression which was linked to ER-β promoter hypermethylation. Genistein has been suggested to have demethylating activities in cancer. However, the ability of genistein to reverse ER-β promoter hypermethylation in PCa has not been studied. In addition, there are great discrepancies among studies that examined the effect of genistein on ER-β gene expression. Therefore, we sought to explore effects of genistein on ER-β promoter methylation as a mechanism of modulating ER-β expression using three PCa cell lines, LNCaP, LAPC-4 and PC-3. We also examined the role of ER-β in mediating the preventive action of genistein. Our data demonstrated that genistein at physiological ranges (0.5-10 μmol/L) reduced ER-β promoter methylation significantly with corresponding dose-dependent increases in ER-β expression in LNCaP and LAPC-4 but not in PC-3 cells, which could be attributed to the low basal levels of ER-β promoter methylation in PC-3 cell line. Genistein induced phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of ER-β in all three PCa cell lines. Inhibitory effects of genistein on LAPC-4 and PC-3 cell proliferation were diminished using a specific ER-β antagonist. In conclusion, genistein and ER-β act together to prevent PCa cell proliferation; genistein increases ER-β levels via reducing its promoter methylation and ER-β, in turn, mediates the preventive action of genistein.""","""['Abeer M Mahmoud', 'Umaima Al-Alem', 'Mohamed M Ali', 'Maarten C Bosland']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['DNA methylation paradigm shift: 15-lipoxygenase-1 upregulation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer by atypical promoter hypermethylation.', 'Comparative effects of soy phytoestrogens and 17β-estradiol on DNA methylation of a panel of 24 genes in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'DNA methylation and soy phytoestrogens: quantitative study in DU-145 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Estrogens and antiestrogens as etiological factors and therapeutics for prostate cancer.', 'Estrogens and anti-estrogens: key mediators of prostate carcinogenesis and new therapeutic candidates.', 'Anti-cancer potential of synergistic phytochemical combinations is influenced by the genetic profile of prostate cancer cell lines.', ""Isoflavone and Antioxidant of Instant Cream Soup Made from Pumpkin and Tempeh and Their Active Compound in Ovariohysterectomy Rat-Induced Alzheimer's Disease."", 'A Mini-Review of Flavone Isomers Apigenin and Genistein in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Undetected αKlotho in serum is associated with the most aggressive phenotype of breast cancer.', 'Genistein Regulates Lipid Metabolism via Estrogen Receptor β and Its Downstream Signal Akt/mTOR in HepG2 Cells.']"""

However, single-institution studies suggest that GIST patients develop additional malignancies at increased frequencies. It was hypothesized that greater insight could be gained into possible associations between GISTs and other malignancies with a national cancer database inquiry.  Methods:   Patients diagnosed with GISTs (2001-2011) in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database were included. Standardized prevalence ratios (SPRs) and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to quantify cancer risks incurred by GIST patients before and after GIST diagnoses, respectively, in comparison with the general US population.  Results:   There were 6112 GIST patients, and 1047 (17.1%) had additional cancers. There were significant increases in overall cancer rates: 44% (SPR, 1.44) before the GIST diagnosis and 66% (SIR, 1.66) after the GIST diagnosis. Malignancies with significantly increased occurrence both before and after diagnoses included other sarcomas (SPR, 5.24; SIR, 4.02), neuroendocrine-carcinoid tumors (SPR, 3.56; SIR, 4.79), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SPR, 1.69; SIR, 1.76), and colorectal adenocarcinoma (SPR, 1.51; SIR, 2.16). Esophageal adenocarcinoma (SPR, 12.0), bladder adenocarcinoma (SPR, 7.51), melanoma (SPR, 1.46), and prostate adenocarcinoma (SPR, 1.20) were significantly more common only before the GIST diagnosis.

Prostate cancer and obesity are major public health concerns for middle-aged and older men. Previous studies of pre-diagnostic BMI have found an increased risk of prostate cancer mortality in obese patients.  Objective:   To study the associations between BMI at time of prostate cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer specific and overall mortality.  Methods:   BMI was analyzed both as a continuous variable and categorized into four groups based on the observed distribution in the cohort (BMI < 22.5, 22.5 < 25, 25 < 27.5 and ≥27.5 kg/m2). The association between BMI and mortality was assessed using stratified Cox proportional hazards models and by fitting regression splines for dose response analysis in 3,161 men diagnosed with prostate cancer. After 11 years of follow up via linkage to the population-based cause of death registry, we identified 1,161 (37%) deaths off which 690 (59%) were due to prostate cancer.  Results:   High BMI (BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m2) was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of prostate cancer specific mortality (HR:1.44, 95% CI: 1.09-1.90) and overall mortality (HR:1.33, 95% CI: 1.09-1.63) compared to the reference group (BMI 22.5 < 25 kg/m2). Additionally, men with a low BMI (<22.5 kg/m2 ), had a statistically significant increased risk of prostate cancer specific mortality (HR:1.33, 95% CI: 1.02-1.74) and overall mortality (HR:1.36, 95% CI: 1.11-1.67) compared to the reference. However, this effect disappeared when men who died within the first two years of follow-up were excluded from the analyses while the increased risk of prostate cancer specific mortality and overall mortality remained statistically significant for men with a BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 (HR:1.44, 95% CI: 1.09-1.90 and HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.09-1.63, respectively).

A single-sequence crossover design (n = 14) was used to determine the effects of enzalutamide 160 mg/day on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of sensitive substrates for CYP2C8 (pioglitazone 30 mg), CYP2C9 (warfarin 10 mg), CYP2C19 (omeprazole 20 mg), or CYP3A4 (midazolam 2 mg).  Results:   Coadministration of gemfibrozil increased the composite area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC∞) of enzalutamide plus active metabolite by 2.2-fold, and coadministration of itraconazole increased the composite AUC∞ by 1.3-fold.

Data sets from 361 patients were used to develop a nomogram (training data), and data sets of 102 patients were used for validation of the nomogram (validation data). Using the external validation data set, the nomogram was assessed for discriminatory ability, and the predictions were assessed for calibration accuracy by plotting actual survival against predicted risk.  Results:   Of the 361 patients in the training data set, 205 (56.8%) patients died, 169 (46.8%) deaths of which were due to prostate cancer. The median follow-up period was 55.2 months. In the multivariate analysis, patient age, serum prostate-specific antigen level, clinical T stage, extent of disease on bone scan, and biopsy Gleason sum were independent prognostic factors. We developed a prognostic model comprising these five factors for patients with bone-metastatic prostate cancer. This nomogram can be used to estimate 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival probability.

Those with epithelioid morphology are even rarer, with only single-case reports published. We describe the histopathologic features and clinical follow-up of 9 patients with epithelioid angiosarcoma (EA) of the bladder retrieved from our Surgical Pathology files from 1998 to 2014. Eight cases were consults. The mean age at presentation was 65 years (range, 39 to 85 y). The M:F ratio was 8:1. The clinical presentation was hematuria and bladder mass in all cases. Six patients had a history of radiotherapy to the pelvis, 5 to treat prostate cancer and 1 to treat uterine cervical cancer. The time from radiotherapy to the diagnosis of EA ranged from 6 to 15 years. The average size of the tumor was 4 cm. (range, 1 to 8 cm.). The submitting diagnoses were poorly differentiated carcinoma (n=5), high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma (n=3), and atypical vascular proliferation (n=1). Morphologically, the tumors were composed of nests and sheets of highly atypical cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, occasional intracytoplasmic lumens, and a hemorrhagic background. None of the cases showed any urothelial carcinoma component. Three patients showed in addition usual angiosarcoma in the resection specimen. By immunohistochemistry, 5/9 cases were positive for cytokeratins, including CK7 (n=3), AE1/AE3 (n=3), and Cam5.2 (n=1). All cases were positive for at least 1 endothelial marker, including CD31 (n=7), CD34 (n=2), FVIII (n=3), and ERG (n=2). Urothelial markers (p63 and GATA3) were consistently negative. Surgical treatment included transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) only (n=5), TURB followed by cystoprostatectomy (n=2), TURB followed by partial cystectomy (n=1), and cystoprostatectomy only (n=1). The tumor involved the muscularis propria in 5/9 patients, the periureteric adipose tissue in 1 patient, and the prostate and seminal vesicles in 1 patient. Five of 9 patients died of disease, with a median survival of 7 months (range, 6 to 14 mo). Two patients were alive with disease at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. One patient who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy was alive with no evidence of disease 12 months after surgery. EA of the bladder is a rare malignancy that is frequently misdiagnosed as high-grade carcinoma, especially due to positive immunostaining for cytokeratins. This tumor is more frequent in older men with a history of radiotherapy to the pelvis. Morphologic features that should suggest the vascular origin of the tumor include highly atypical nuclei with interspersed erythrocytes, hemorrhagic background, and occasional intracytoplasmic lumens. Patients usually present with muscle invasive disease, and the prognosis is dismal.""","""['Andres Matoso', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Primary cutaneous epithelioid angiosarcoma: a clinicopathologic study of 13 cases of a rare neoplasm occurring outside the setting of conventional angiosarcomas and with predilection for the limbs.', 'Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, lipid cell variant: clinicopathologic findings and LOH analysis.', 'Pseudoangiosarcomatous urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder.', 'Angiosarcoma involving the gastrointestinal tract: a series of primary and metastatic cases.', 'Urachal carcinomas of the nonglandular type: salient features and considerations in pathologic diagnosis.', 'A Primary Epithelioid Angiosarcoma Arising in a Bilharzial Urinary Bladder: A Reappraisal and Case Report.', 'Primary bladder angiosarcoma synchronous with prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma in an 82-year-old male.', 'Angiosarcoma of the Urinary Bladder Following Radiotherapy: Report of a Case and Review of the Literature.', 'Angiosarcomas: histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular insights with implications for differential diagnosis.', 'Angiosarcoma of the Bladder: Review of the Literature and Discussion About a Clinical Case.']"""

Despite important implications of this diagnosis, interobserver variation in the diagnosis of GP5 has not been adequately studied. Digital images of 66 prostate adenocarcinoma cases that potentially contained a GP5 component were distributed to 16 urologic pathologists who were asked to classify whether GP5 was present. Each image was initially classified into 1 of 4 morphologic subpatterns by 2 coauthors (R.B.S. and M.Z.): solid nests (15), comedocarcinoma (8), single cells and/or cords (35), and variant morphology (8). Additional features captured included: size (large: >20 cells, medium: 10 to 20 cells, and small: <10 cells) and distribution of nuclei (uniform vs. nonuniform) for nests pattern; intraluminal coagulative tumor necrosis, karyorrhectic debris, and amorphous material for comedocarcinoma pattern; and quantity (≤5, 6 to 10, and >10) and distribution (clustered vs. intermixed with adjacent well-formed glands) for single cells/cords pattern. Interobserver reproducibility of a diagnosis of GP5 was assessed and the morphologic subpatterns and features were correlated with the consensus diagnosis (defined as 75% agreement). Interobserver reproducibility for overall diagnostic agreement was fair (κ=0.376). Among subpatterns, comedocarcinoma had highest reproducibility (κ=0.499), followed by variant morphology (κ=0.443), single cells/cords (κ=0.369), and nests (κ=0.347). All cases with the following features achieved consensus for GP5: large nests regardless of nuclear distribution; coagulative necrosis with or without karyorrhectic debris; single cells/cords >10 or 6 to 10 in a cluster; and signet ring-like cells in single cells or within nests pattern. A majority of cases with the following features achieved consensus against GP5: medium-size nests; exclusive intraluminal amorphous material; single cells/cords ≤5; and Paneth cell change. Remaining morphologic features did not reach consensus for or against GP5. A majority (86%) of participants would diagnose a small focus of GP5 only when it is present in >1 level. The diagnostic reproducibility of GP5 within certain morphologies was only fair among urologic pathologists. However, the diagnosis of GP5 was more reproducible when certain restrictive morphologic and quantitative criteria were applied.

We conducted a register-based cohort study to assess the relative risks (RRs) of cancer in families of NPC probands in Sweden.  Methods:   By linking 11,602,616 Swedish-born individuals (defined as 'general population') identified from national censuses to the Swedish Cancer Register and Multi-Generation Register, we identified 9157 relatives (3645 first-degree and 5512 second-degree) of 1211 NPC probands. Cancer incidence during 1961-2009 was ascertained through the Cancer Register. Relative risks of cancer in the relatives of NPC probands, compared with the rest of the general population, were calculated from Poisson regression models.  Results:   First-degree relatives had higher risks of NPC (N=2, RR=4.29, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07 to 17.17) and cancers of the larynx (N=5, RR=2.53, 95% CI=1.05 to 6.09), prostate (N=76, RR=1.35, 95% CI=1.07 to 1.68), and thyroid (N=10, RR=2.44, 95% CI=1.31 to 4.53) than the rest of the general population. In addition, a raised risk of cancer of the salivary glands was observed among first-degree relatives of probands with undifferentiated NPC (N=2, RR=6.64, 95% CI=1.66 to 26.57). In contrast, a decreased risk of colorectal cancer was observed in first- and second-degree relatives (N=43, RR=0.71, 95% CI=0.53 to 0.96).  Conclusion:   The increased risk of NPC and certain other cancers among first-degree relatives may be explained by shared genetic and environmental risk factors, the latter including Epstein-Barr virus infection and smoking or by increased diagnostic intensity.""","""['Z Liu', 'F Fang', 'E T Chang', 'W Ye']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Sibship size, birth order and risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and infectious mononucleosis: a nationwide study in Sweden.', 'Seroreactivity against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) among first-degree relatives of sporadic EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Indonesia.', 'Quantification of familial risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in a high-incidence area.', 'Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: understanding its molecular biology at a fine scale.', 'Genetic susceptibility to the endemic form of NPC.', 'Epidemiological Characteristics and Survival Analysis of Patients With Nasopharyngeal Cancer in Western Greece.', 'Systematic comparison of plasma EBV DNA, anti-EBV antibodies and miRNA levels for early detection and prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Body mass index, body shape, and risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A population-based case-control study in Southern China.', 'Time-dependent risks of cancer clustering among couples: a nationwide population-based cohort study in Taiwan.', 'Interaction among smoking status, single nucleotide polymorphisms and markers of systemic inflammation in healthy individuals.']"""

The sensitivity of mp-MRI and PB for diagnosis was compared using Student's t-test. The ability of the two exams to detect the prevalence of Gleason pattern 4 in the identified lesions was compared using a chi-square test.  Results:   Overall sensitivity of PB and mp-MRI to identify tumor lesion was 59.4% and 78.9%, respectively (p<0.0001). PB missed 144/355 lesions, 59 of which (16.6%) were significant. mp-MRI missed 75/355 lesions, 12 of which (3.4%) were significant. No lesions with a GS≥8 were missed.

Notably, PrCa is increasing in Africa with Nigerian men being mostly affected. Thus, it is important to understand risk factors for PrCa in Nigeria and build capacity for cancer research. The goals of this study were to determine the feasibility of conducting an epidemiological study of PrCa and to obtain preliminary data on risk factors for PrCa in Nigeria.  Methods:   A case-control study (50 cases/50 controls) was conducted at the University College Hospital (UCH) in Ibadan, Nigeria, between October 2011 and December 2012. Men aged 40 to 80 years were approached for the study and asked to provide informed consent and complete the research protocol. Logistic regression models were used to examine associations between demographic, social and lifestyle characteristics and risk of PrCa.  Results:   The participation rate among cases and controls was 98% and 93%, respectively. All participants completed a questionnaire and 99% (50 cases/49 controls) provided blood samples. Cases had a median serum diagnostic PSA of 73 ng/ml, and 38% had a Gleason score 8-10 tumor. Family history of PrCa was associated with a 4.9-fold increased risk of PrCa (95% CI 1.0 - 24.8). There were statistically significant inverse associations between PrCa and height, weight and waist circumference, but there was no association with body mass index (kg/m(2)). There were no associations between other socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics and PrCa risk.  Conclusion:   This feasibility study demonstrated the ability to ascertain and recruit participants at UCH and collect epidemiological, clinical and biospecimen data. Our results highlighted the advanced clinical characteristics of PrCa in Nigerian men, and that family history of PrCa and some anthropometric factors were associated with PrCa risk in this population.

Strength training may counteract several side effects of ADT, such as changes in body composition and physical functioning, which in turn may affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, additional randomised controlled trials are needed to expand this knowledge.  Material and methods:   Fifty-eight PCa patients on ADT were randomised to either 16 weeks of high-load strength training (n = 28) or usual care (n = 30). The primary outcome was change in total lean body mass (LBM) assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Secondary outcomes were changes in regional LBM, fat mass, and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measured by DXA; physical functioning assessed by 1-repetition maximum (1RM) tests, sit-to-stand test, stair climbing test and Shuttle walk test; and HRQOL as measured by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30.  Results and conclusion:   No statistically significant effect of high-load strength training was demonstrated on total LBM (p = 0.16), but significant effects were found on LBM in the lower and upper extremities (0.49 kg, p < 0.01 and 0.15 kg, p < 0.05, respectively). Compared to usual care, high-load strength training showed no effect on fat mass, aBMD or HRQOL, but beneficial effects were observed in all 1RM tests, sit-to-stand test and stair climbing tests. Adherence to the training program was 88% for lower body exercises and 84% for upper body exercises. In summary, high-load strength training improved LBM in extremities and physical functioning, but had no effect on fat mass, aBMD, or HRQOL in PCa patients on ADT.""","""['Tormod S Nilsen', 'Truls Raastad', 'Eva Skovlund', 'Kerry S Courneya', 'Carl W Langberg', 'Wolfgang Lilleby', 'Sophie D Fosså', 'Lene Thorsen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Football training improves lean body mass in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Efficacy of recreational football on bone health, body composition, and physical functioning in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy: 32-week follow-up of the FC prostate randomised controlled trial.', 'Impact of resistance training on body composition and metabolic syndrome variables during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a pilot randomized controlled trial.', 'Effects of exercise on treatment-related adverse effects for patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: a systematic review.', 'Exercise overcome adverse effects among prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy: An update meta-analysis.', 'Investigating the Physiological Mechanisms between Resistance Training and Pain Relief in the Cancer Population: A Literature Review.', 'Feasibility of home-based exercise training during adjuvant treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (EXACT).', 'The Effect of Exercise on Pain in People with Cancer: A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis.', 'Effects of exercise mode and intensity on patient-reported outcomes in cancer survivors: a four-arm intervention trial.', 'Dose-response relationship of resistance training for muscle morphology and strength in elderly cancer patients: A meta-analysis.']"""

Currently there are few methods or tools available to visually evaluate the spatial distribution of risks of radiogenic late effects in the human body. We developed a risk visualization method and demonstrated it for radiogenic second cancers in tissues and organs of one patient treated with photon volumetric modulated arc therapy and one patient treated with proton craniospinal irradiation.  Methods:   Treatment plans were generated using radiotherapy treatment planning systems (TPS) and dose information was obtained from TPS. Linear non-threshold risk coefficients for organs at risk of second cancer incidence were taken from the Biological Effects of Ionization Radiation VII report. Alternative risk models including linear exponential model and linear plateau model were also examined. The predicted absolute lifetime risk distributions were visualized together with images of the patient anatomy.  Results:   The risk distributions of second cancer for the two patients were visually presented. The risk distributions varied with tissue, dose, dose-risk model used, and the risk distribution could be similar to or very different from the dose distribution.  Conclusions:   Our method provides a convenient way to directly visualize and evaluate the risks of radiogenic second cancer in organs and tissues of the human body.

Based on a random effects model, the RR and 95% CI were used to assess the combined risk. In total, 10 cohort studies involving more than 7027 cases and 429914 participants were included. There was no significant relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer risk, the pooled RR (95%CI) was 1.11[0.98, 1.27] (P = 0.109). In subgroup-analysis, the relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer risk was not significantly modified by the length of follow-up and population distribution except Americans.

The electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline were searched prior to October 1, 2014. An odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were used to calculate association. Heterogeneity was tested by both a chi-square test and I statistic. Funnel plots and Egger's test were used to assess publication bias. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 12.0 software. A significant association between the XRCC1-Arg399Gln polymorphism and prostate cancer risk was found under a homozygote model and a recessive model. A significant association between XRCC1-Arg280His and prostate cancer risk was found under a heterozygote model and a dominant model [corrected]. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis show that the XRCC1-Arg399Gln polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer under the homozygote model and the recessive model.

Majority of prostate cancers are originally androgen-dependent and sensitive to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), however, most of them eventually relapse and progress into incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Of note, the activity of androgen receptor (AR) is still required in CRPC stage. The mitotic kinase polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is significantly elevated in PCa and its expression correlates with tumor grade. In this study, we assess the effects of Plk1 on AR signaling in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa cells. We demonstrate that the expression level of Plk1 correlated with tumorigenicity and that inhibition of Plk1 caused reduction of AR expression and AR activity. Furthermore, Plk1 inhibitor BI2536 down-regulated SREBP-dependent expression of enzymes involved in androgen biosynthesis. Of interest, Plk1 level was also reduced when AR activity was inhibited by the antagonist MDV3100. Finally, we show that BI2536 treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth in LNCaP CRPC xenografts.

Thus, development of diagnostic tools specific for PSA plays an important role in screening, monitoring and early diagnosis of prostate cancer. In this paper, the production and characterization of a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PSA have been presented.  Methods:   Balb/c mice were immunized with PSA, which was purified from seminal plasma. Splenocytes of hyperimmunized mice were extracted and fused with Sp2/0 cells. By adding selective HAT medium, hybridoma cells were established and positive clones were selected by ELISA after four times of cloning. The isotypes of produced mAbs were determined by ELISA and then purified from ascitic fluids using Hi-Trap protein G column. The reactivities of the mAbs were examined with the purified PSA and seminal plasma by ELISA and western blot techniques. Furthermore, the reactivities of the mAbs were assessed in Prostate Cancer (PCa), Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and brain cancer tissues by Immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results:   Five anti-PSA mAbs (clones: 2G2-B2, 2F9-F4, 2D6-E8, IgG1/К) and clones (2C8-E9, 2G3-E2, IgG2a/К) were produced and characterized. All mAbs, except 2F9-F4 detected the expression of PSA in PCa and BPH tissues and none of them reacted with PSA in brain cancer tissue in IHC.

A truncated version of the CCN1/CYR61 gene promoter, tCCN1-Prom, was more active than progression elevated gene-3 promoter (PEG-Prom) in regulating transformation-selective transgene expression in CaP and oncogene-transformed rat embryo cells. Accordingly, we developed a new CTV, Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7, which displayed dose-dependent killing of CaP without harming normal prostate epithelial cells in vitro with significant anti-cancer activity in vivo in both nude mouse CaP xenograft and transgenic Hi-Myc mice (using ultrasound-targeted microbubble (MB)-destruction, UTMD, with decorated MBs). Resistance to mda-7/IL-24-induced cell death correlated with overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins. Inhibiting Mcl-1 using an enhanced BH3 mimetic, BI-97D6, sensitized CaP cell lines to mda-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis. Combining BI-97D6 with Ads expressing mda-7/IL-24 promoted ER stress, decreased anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 expression and enhanced mda-7/IL-24 expression through mRNA stabilization selectively in CaP cells. In Hi-myc mice, the combination induced enhanced apoptosis and tumor growth suppression.

The 15 year limit is partly based on perceived decreases in lung cancer risk as years since quitting (YSQ) increase. We examine the relationship between lung cancer risk and YSQ among 30+ pack-year former smokers.  Methods:   In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian trial, participants aged 55-74 were randomized to screening or usual care; screened subjects received annual chest-radiographs for lung cancer screening. Subjects completed a baseline questionnaire; smoking history included average cigarettes per day and age at starting and stopping smoking. Subjects were followed 13 years. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) associated with YSQ, with YSQ treated as a time-varying covariate. The models adjusted for age and sex.  Results:   Of 154899 subjects randomized, 27101 were former smokers with 30+ pack-years, and 69182 were never smokers.

We evaluated whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) anxiety or health literacy are associated with use of early salvage ADT among men with recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy.  Patients and methods:   The prospective Comprehensive, Observational, Multicenter, Prostate Adenocarcinoma Registry was used to study 375 men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after external beam radiation or brachytherapy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine whether PSA anxiety and health literacy are associated with salvage ADT as initial management after biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Sixty-eight men (18.1%) received salvage ADT as initial management for PSA recurrence. Men with high PSA anxiety were twice as likely to receive salvage ADT compared with men who did not have high PSA anxiety on both univariable [28.8% versus 13.1%; odds ratio (OR) 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-4.00; P = 0.015] and multivariable analysis [adjusted OR (AOR) 2.36; 95% CI 1.21-4.62; P = 0.012]. Furthermore, men who had higher levels of health literacy were nearly half as likely to undergo salvage ADT compared with men who had lower levels of health literacy on univariable analysis (15.2% versus 26.3%; OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.29-0.88; P = 0.016), with a trend toward this association on multivariable analysis (AOR 0.58; 95% CI 0.32-1.05; P = 0.07).  Conclusions:   Among men with PSA recurrence after radiotherapy, odds of use of salvage ADT were nearly twice as great among men with high PSA anxiety or low health literacy, suggesting that these men are receiving higher rates of unproven treatment. Given that early salvage ADT is costly, worsens quality of life, and has not been shown to improve survival, quality improvement strategies are needed for these individuals.""","""['B A Mahal', 'M-H Chen', 'C L Bennett', 'M W Kattan', 'O Sartor', 'K Stein', ""A V D'Amico"", 'P L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['Salvage radiotherapy with or without short-term hormone therapy for rising prostate-specific antigen concentration after radical prostatectomy (GETUG-AFU 16): a randomised, multicentre, open-label phase 3 trial.', 'Role of androgen deprivation therapy in early salvage radiation among patients with prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 or less.', 'Immediate versus deferred initiation of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients with PSA-only relapse.

Experimental design:   mCRPC patients received sipuleucel-T followed by AA + P 1 day (concurrent) or 10 weeks (sequential) after the first sipuleucel-T infusion. AA + P treatment continued for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was cumulative antigen presenting cell (APC) activation, and secondary endpoints included cumulative APC number and total nucleated cell counts. Additional endpoints included in vivo peripheral immune responses to sipuleucel-T (T-cell responses, T-cell proliferation, humoral responses, and antigen spread) as well as safety.  Results:   Sixty-nine mCRPC patients were enrolled, with 35 and 34 patients randomized to the concurrent and sequential arms, respectively. Ex vivo APC activation was significantly greater at the second and third infusions compared with baseline in both arms (P < 0.05), indicative of an immunologic prime-boost effect. In both arms, sipuleucel-T product parameter profiles and peripheral immune responses were consistent with previously conducted sipuleucel-T phase III trials. Antigen spread was similarly observed in both arms and consistent with the other immunologic endpoints.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that sipuleucel-T can be successfully manufactured during concurrent administration of AA + P without blunting immunologic effects or altering immune parameters that correlate with sipuleucel-T's clinical benefit.

Experimental design:   To evaluate the clinical impact and relationship with key genomic alterations in prostate cancer, p62 protein levels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 12,427 prostate cancers. Data on ERG status and deletions of PTEN, 3p13, 5q21, and 6q15 were available from earlier studies.  Results:   p62 immunostaining was absent in benign prostatic glands but present in 73% of 7,822 interpretable prostate cancers. Strong cytoplasmic p62 staining was tightly linked to high Gleason grade, advanced pathologic tumor (pT) stage, positive nodal status, positive resection margin, and early PSA recurrence (P < 0.0001 each). Increased levels of p62 were significantly linked to TMPRSS2-ERG fusions, both by FISH and immunohistochemical analysis (P < 0.0001 each). For example, moderate or strong p62 immunostaining was seen in 28.5% of cancers with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion detected by FISH and in 23.1% of cancers without such rearrangements (P < 0.0001). Strong p62 staining was significantly linked to the presence of all tested deletions, including PTEN (P < 0.0001), 6q15 (P < 0.0001), 5q21 (P = 0.0002), 3p13 (P = 0.0088), and 6q15 (P < 0.0001), suggesting a link between p62 accumulation and loss of genomic stability. The prognostic role of p62 protein accumulation was striking and independent of Gleason grade, pT stage, pN stage, surgical margin status, and preoperative PSA, regardless of whether preoperative or postoperative parameters were used for modeling.

Fine and Gray's competing-risks regression model was used to assess whether ADT among men with favorable disease or RT or ADT among men with unfavorable disease decreased PCSM risk after adjusting for treatment propensity score, year of brachytherapy, and PC prognostic factors.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 7.78 years, 366 deaths (14.58%) were observed, 29 of which (7.92%) were from PC.

Such approaches are not scalable, preventing widespread adoption. Likewise, most targeted NGS approaches fail to assess key relevant genomic alteration classes. To address these challenges, we predefined the catalog of relevant solid tumor somatic genome variants (gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations, high-level copy number alterations, and gene fusions) through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of >700,000 samples. To detect these variants, we developed the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel (OCP), an integrative NGS-based assay [compatible with <20 ng of DNA/RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues], coupled with an informatics pipeline to specifically identify relevant predefined variants and created a knowledge base of related potential treatments, current practice guidelines, and open clinical trials. We validated OCP using molecular standards and more than 300 FFPE tumor samples, achieving >95% accuracy for KRAS, epidermal growth factor receptor, and BRAF mutation detection as well as for ALK and TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusions.

However, their side effects in hepatitis, cardiovascular diseases, and bladder cancer resulted in some selling restrictions in the USA and Europe. Here, we found that the potential impact of TZDs on the prostate cancer (PCa) progression might be linked to the TR4 nuclear receptor expression. Clinical surveys found that 9% of PCa patients had one allele TR4 deletion in their tumors. TZD increased cell growth and invasion in PCa cells when TR4 was knocked down. In contrast, TZD decreased PCa progression in PCa cells with wild type TR4. Mechanism dissection found that the Harvey Rat Sarcoma (HRAS) oncogene increased on TZD treatment of the TR4 knocked-down CWR22Rv1 and C4-2 cells, and interruption with HRAS inhibitor resulted in reversal of TZD-induced PCa progression. Together, these results suggest that TZD treatment may promote PCa progression depending on the TR4 expression status that may be clinically relevant since extra caution may be needed for those diabetic PCa patients receiving TZD treatment who have one allele TR4 deletion.""","""['Shin-Jen Lin', 'Chang-Yi Lin', 'Dong-Rong Yang', 'Kouji Izumi', 'Emily Yan', 'Xiaodan Niu', 'Hong-Chiang Chang', 'Hiroshi Miyamoto', 'Nancy Wang', 'Gonghui Li', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['TR4 Nuclear Receptor Different Roles in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Targeting TR4 nuclear receptor suppresses prostate cancer invasion via reduction of infiltrating macrophages with alteration of the TIMP-1/MMP2/MMP9 signals.', 'TR4 nuclear receptor increases prostate cancer invasion via decreasing the miR-373-3p expression to alter TGFβR2/p-Smad3 signals.', 'Differential roles of PPARγ vs TR4 in prostate cancer and metabolic diseases.', 'Increased chemosensitivity via targeting testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4)-Oct4-interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1Ra) axis in prostate cancer CD133+ stem/progenitor cells to battle prostate cancer.', 'The Influence of Anti-Diabetic Drugs on Prostate Cancer.', 'The retinamide VNLG-152 inhibits f-AR/AR-V7 and MNK-eIF4E signaling pathways to suppress EMT and castration-resistant prostate cancer xenograft growth.', 'A comprehensive data mining study shows that most nuclear receptors act as newly proposed homeostasis-associated molecular pattern receptors.', 'TR4 Nuclear Receptor Different Roles in Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Despite the clinical success of DTX, drug-related cumulative toxicity restricts its clinical use in cancer therapy. Thus, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic options. Octreotide (OCT) is a synthetic somatostatin analog that induces apoptosis in different cancer cell lines in vitro. In this study, we investigated the possible synergistic apoptotic effects of DTX in combination with OCT in prostate and breast cancer cell lines.  Methods:   The XTT cell viability assay was used to determine cytotoxicity. Apoptosis was evaluated by Cell Death Detection ELISA(Plus) Kit. The expression levels of apoptotic proteins were assessed by human apoptosis antibody array. Levels of SSTR2 and SSTR5 proteins were determined by western blot analysis.  Results:   DTX and OCT combination induced apoptosis in both breast and prostate cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, combination treatment resulted in inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and induction of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Cytochrome c and IAPs in all of the tested cancer cell lines. SSTR2 and SSTR5 protein levels were induced as compared to any agent alone.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that this combination treatment is a significant inducer of apoptosis in a synergistic manner in breast and prostate cancer cells. This strong synergism helps to lower the dose of DTX in both types of cancers, thus letting DTX to be used for longer periods by delaying resistance development and lesser side effects.""","""['Burcak Karaca', 'Mustafa Degirmenci', 'Ahmet Ozveren', 'Harika Atmaca', 'Emir Bozkurt', 'Bulent Karabulut', 'Ulus Ali Sanli', 'Ruchan Uslu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Octreotide in combination with AT-101 induces cytotoxicity and apoptosis through up-regulation of somatostatin receptors 2 and 5 in DU-145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Bcl-2 family inhibition sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to docetaxel and promotes unexpected apoptosis under caspase-9 inhibition.', 'Differential molecular mechanism of docetaxel-octreotide combined treatment according to the docetaxel-resistance status in PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Preclinical mechanisms of action of docetaxel and docetaxel combinations in prostate cancer.', 'Evasion of cell death: A contributory factor in prostate cancer development and treatment resistance.', 'Next-generation paclitaxel-nanoparticle formulation for pancreatic cancer treatment.', 'Pulmonary Carcinoid Surface Receptor Modulation Using Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors.', 'Octreotide Attenuates Acute Kidney Injury after Hepatic Ischemia and Reperfusion by Enhancing Autophagy.', 'In vitro and in vivo effects of a recombinant anti-PSMA immunotoxin in combination with docetaxel against prostate cancer.']"""

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has the highest incidence in Southern China. Aberrant methylation at the promoter region of tumor suppressors is frequently reported in NPC; however, genome-wide methylation changes have not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, we systematically analyzed methylome data in 25 primary NPC tumors and nontumor counterparts using a high-throughput approach with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Comparatively, we examined the methylome data of 11 types of solid tumors collected by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In NPC, the hypermethylation pattern was more dominant than hypomethylation and the majority of de novo methylated loci were within or close to CpG islands in tumors. The comparative methylome analysis reveals hypermethylation at chromosome 6p21.3 frequently occurred in NPC (false discovery rate; FDR=1.33 × 10(-9) ), but was less obvious in other types of solid tumors except for prostate and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive gastric cancer (FDR<10(-3) ). Bisulfite pyrosequencing results further confirmed the aberrant methylation at 6p in an additional patient cohort. Evident enrichment of the repressive mark H3K27me3 and active mark H3K4me3 derived from human embryonic stem cells were found at these regions, indicating both DNA methylation and histone modification function together, leading to epigenetic deregulation in NPC. Our study highlights the importance of epigenetic deregulation in NPC. Polycomb Complex 2 (PRC2), responsible for H3K27 trimethylation, is a promising therapeutic target. A key genomic region on 6p with aberrant methylation was identified. This region contains several important genes having potential use as biomarkers for NPC detection.""","""['Wei Dai', 'Arthur Kwok Leung Cheung', 'Josephine Mun Yee Ko', 'Yue Cheng', 'Hong Zheng', 'Roger Kai Cheong Ngan', 'Wai Tong Ng', 'Anne Wing Mui Lee', 'Chun Chung Yau', 'Victor Ho Fu Lee', 'Maria Li Lung']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Quantitation of DNA methylation in Epstein-Barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma by bisulfite amplicon sequencing.', 'Characterization of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma methylome identifies aberrant disruption of key signaling pathways and methylated tumor suppressor genes.', 'The new 6q27 tumor suppressor DACT2, frequently silenced by CpG methylation, sensitizes nasopharyngeal cancer cells to paclitaxel and 5-FU toxicity via β-catenin/Cdc25c signaling and G2/M arrest.', 'Genetic and epigenetic landscape of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Epigenetic disruption of cell signaling in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Enhancer remodeling activates NOTCH3 signaling to confer chemoresistance in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Targeting Metabolic Vulnerabilities in Epstein-Barr Virus-Driven Proliferative Diseases.', 'The role of Epstein-Barr virus in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'The CBP/β-Catenin Antagonist, ICG-001, Inhibits Tumor Metastasis via Blocking of the miR-134/ITGB1 Axis-Mediated Cell Adhesion in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Prediction and prognostic significance of ALOX12B and PACSIN1 expression in gastric cancer by genome-wide RNA expression and methylation analysis.']"""

Results:   The sociodemographic and clinical factors collectively significantly predicted 8/12 HRQoL domains, although for 5/8 accounted for <10% of the variance. For all 12 HRQoL domains, illness perceptions collectively explained significant substantial additional variance (∆R(2) range: 5.6-27.9%), and a single illness perception questionnaire-revised dimension was the best individual predictor of 9/12 HRQoL domains. The consequences dimension independently predicted 7/12 HRQoL domains; patients who believed their cancer would have a more serious negative impact on their life reported poorer future HRQoL.

Understanding how frequently altered oncogenes regulate metabolic enzyme targets would be useful in identifying both broad-spectrum and targeted metabolic therapies for cancer. Here, we used activity-based protein profiling to identify serine hydrolase activities that were consistently upregulated by various human oncogenes. Through this profiling effort, we found oncogenic regulatory mechanisms for several cancer-relevant serine hydrolases and discovered that platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase 1B2 and 1B3 (PAFAH1B2 and PAFAH1B3) activities were consistently upregulated by several oncogenes, alongside previously discovered cancer-relevant hydrolases fatty acid synthase and monoacylglycerol lipase. While we previously showed that PAFAH1B2 and 1B3 were important in breast cancer, our most recent profiling studies have revealed that these enzymes may be dysregulated broadly across many types of cancers. Here, we find that pharmacological blockade of both enzymes impairs cancer pathogenicity across multiple different types of cancer cells, including breast, ovarian, melanoma, and prostate cancer. We also show that pharmacological blockade of PAFAH1B2 and 1B3 causes unique changes in lipid metabolism, including heightened levels of tumor-suppressing lipids.

Enhancing autophagy using chemotherapy and rapamycin (Rapa) treatment and then inhibiting it using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could synergistically improve therapy outcome in cancer patients. It is still unclear whether addition of Rapa and HCQ to chemotherapy could be used for reversing drug resistance.  Patients and methods:   Twenty-five stage IV cancer patients were identified. They had no clinical response to first-line metronomic chemotherapy; the patients were salvaged by adding an autophagy inducer (Rapa, 2 mg/day) and an autophagosome inhibitor (HCQ, 400 mg/day) to their current metronomic chemotherapy for at least 3 months.

There is great interest in using CTCs to monitor response to therapies, to identify clinically actionable biomarkers, and to provide a non-invasive window on the molecular state of a tumor. Here we characterize the performance of the AccuCyte®--CyteFinder® system, a comprehensive, reproducible and highly sensitive platform for collecting, identifying and retrieving individual CTCs from microscopic slides for molecular analysis after automated immunofluorescence staining for epithelial markers.  Methods:   All experiments employed a density-based cell separation apparatus (AccuCyte) to separate nucleated cells from the blood and transfer them to microscopic slides. After staining, the slides were imaged using a digital scanning microscope (CyteFinder). Precisely counted model CTCs (mCTCs) from four cancer cell lines were spiked into whole blood to determine recovery rates. Individual mCTCs were removed from slides using a single-cell retrieval device (CytePicker™) for whole genome amplification and subsequent analysis by PCR and Sanger sequencing, whole exome sequencing, or array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Clinical CTCs were evaluated in blood samples from patients with different cancers in comparison with the CellSearch® system.  Results:   AccuCyte--CyteFinder presented high-resolution images that allowed identification of mCTCs by morphologic and phenotypic features. Spike-in mCTC recoveries were between 90 and 91%. More than 80% of single-digit spike-in mCTCs were identified and even a single cell in 7.5 mL could be found. Analysis of single SKBR3 mCTCs identified presence of a known TP53 mutation by both PCR and whole exome sequencing, and confirmed the reported karyotype of this cell line. Patient sample CTC counts matched or exceeded CellSearch CTC counts in a small feasibility cohort.  Conclusion:   The AccuCyte--CyteFinder system is a comprehensive and sensitive platform for identification and characterization of CTCs that has been applied to the assessment of CTCs in cancer patient samples as well as the isolation of single cells for genomic analysis.

After disease progression, control-arm patients on three double-blind, randomized phase III sipuleucel-T trials were offered, in nonrandomized open-label protocols, APC8015F, an autologous immunotherapy made from cells cryopreserved at the time of control manufacture. These exploratory analyses evaluated potential effects on survival outcomes associated with such treatment. Of 249 control-treated patients, 165 (66.3%) received APC8015F. We explored the effects of APC8015F on the overall survival (OS; Cox regression) of control-arm patients and treatment effects of sipuleucel-T versus control adjusted for APC8015F treatment [iterative parameter estimation model (IPE)]. The median time to first APC8015F infusion was 5.2 months (range, 1.8-33.1) after randomization and 2.2 months (0.5-14.6) after progression. After disease progression, median survival was longer for APC8015F-treated versus control-only treated patients [20.0 vs. 9.8 months; HR, 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.38-0.74; P < 0.001]; however, baseline characteristics were more favorable for APC8015F-treated patients. Multivariate regression analyses identified lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, hemoglobin, ECOG status, age, and number of bone metastases as potential (P < 0.1) independent predictors of postprogression survival. After adjusting for these predictors, APC8015F (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.54-1.11; P = 0.17) treatment trended toward improved survival. Estimated median OS benefit for sipuleucel-T versus control adjusted for APC8015F treatment was 3.9 months if APC8015F had no effect and was 8.1 months if APC8015F was equally as effective as sipuleucel-T. Exploratory analyses indicate that APC8015F treatment may have extended patient survival, suggesting the sipuleucel-T OS advantage in CRPC may be more robust than previously estimated.""","""['Daniel J George', 'Chadi Nabhan', 'Todd DeVries', 'James B Whitmore', 'Leonard G Gomella']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Res""","""['Placebo-controlled phase III trial of immunologic therapy with sipuleucel-T (APC8015) in patients with metastatic, asymptomatic hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Sipuleucel-T immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Variables Associated With Overall Survival in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Sipuleucel-T Immunotherapy.', 'Sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) autologous vaccine approved for treatment of men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Immunotherapy as a potential treatment approach for currently incurable bone metastasis.', 'Boosting the Immune Response-Combining Local and Immune Therapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Immunotherapy in Genitourinary Malignancy: Evolution in Revolution or Revolution in Evolution.', 'Immunotherapy for Colorectal Cancer: Mechanisms and Predictive Biomarkers.', 'Therapeutic metastatic prostate cancer vaccines: lessons learnt from urologic oncology.']"""

All tests were two-sided with P < 0.05 considered significant.  Results:   Median follow-up was 46.7 months, and two patients were lost to follow-up. Five-year event-free survival for patients with positive lymph nodes was 93.0%, 83.0%, and 96.0% for local recurrence, systemic progression, and cancer death, respectively. One-year, 2-year, and 3-year biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival was 52%, 40%, and 22%, respectively. Postoperative BCR-free survival was 25.7 months. BCR-free survival for patients with a single LNM was longer than those with two or more LNM (median 39.1 months vs. median 17.2 months, P = 0.002). In a multivariate Cox model, only two or more LNM was a significant predictor of BCR (hazard ratio 2.6, P = 0.005).

Methods:   The S/P cells were obtained from LNCaP cell line through florescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). AR was overexpressed in S/P cells through lentivirus. Western blot assay was used to detect the EMT markers expression, such as E Cadherin, N Cadherin, Vimentin and Snail. MTT assay, soft agar colony formation assay, sphere formation assay and migration assay were used to investigate AR's roles in EMT of S/P cells. Cell signaling pathways associated with proliferation and apoptosis of S/P cells were detected simultaneously.

Results:   Our data showed that S/P cells from LNCaP had high EMT markers expression, more tumorigenesis and strong migration ability. And in S/P cells overexpressed with AR, the expression of EMT markers decreased. In addition, these cells had less proliferation ability, tumorigenesis ability, self-renewal and migration ability. At the same time, targeting S/P cells with AKT signaling pathway inhibitor LY29004 and γ-TT and/or 5-AZA could inhibit S/P cell's proliferation and tumorigenesis.

Polymerase I and Transcript Release Factor (PTRF)/cavin-1 is a cytoplasmic protein required for Cav1-dependent formation of caveolae. Expression of PTRF reduces the motility of PC3 cells, a metastatic prostate cancer cell line that endogenously expresses abundant Cav1 but no PTRF and no caveolae, suggesting a role for non-caveolar Cav1 domains, or Cav1 scaffolds, in PCa cell migration. Tyrosine phosphorylated Cav1 (pCav1) functions in concert with Galectin-3 (Gal3) and the galectin lattice to stabilize focal adhesion kinase (FAK) within focal adhesions (FAs) and promote cancer cell motility. However, whether PTRF regulation of Cav1 function in PCa cell migration is related to Gal3 expression and functionality has yet to be determined. Here we show that PTRF expression in PC3 cells reduces FAK stabilization in focal adhesions and reduces cell motility without affecting pCav1 levels. Exogenous Gal3 stabilized FAK in focal adhesions of PTRF-expressing cells and restored cell motility of PTRF-expressing PC3 cells to levels of PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an optimal concentration of 2 µg/ml. Exogenous Gal3 stabilized FAK in focal adhesions of Gal3 knockdown PC3 cells but not in Cav1 knockdown PC3 cells. Cav1 knockdown also prevented Gal3 rescue of FA-associated FAK stabilization in PTRF-expressing PC3 cells. Our data support a role for PTRF/cavin-1, through caveolae formation, as an attenuator of the non-caveolar functionality of Cav1 in Gal3-Cav1 signalling and regulation of focal adhesion dynamics and cancer cell migration.""","""['Fanrui Meng', 'Bharat Joshi', 'Ivan Robert Nabi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PTRF-cavin-1 expression decreases the migration of PC3 prostate cancer cells: role of matrix metalloprotease 9.', 'Coordinated expression of galectin-3 and caveolin-1 in thyroid cancer.', 'Concerted regulation of focal adhesion dynamics by galectin-3 and tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1.', 'Caveola-forming proteins caveolin-1 and PTRF in prostate cancer.', 'Focal adhesion kinase controls prostate cancer progression via intrinsic kinase and scaffolding functions.', 'Caveolar and non-Caveolar Caveolin-1 in ocular homeostasis and disease.', 'Overcoming Microenvironment-Mediated Chemoprotection through Stromal Galectin-3 Inhibition in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.', 'Integrated Bioinformatic Analysis of the Expression and Prognosis of Caveolae-Related Genes in Human Breast Cancer.', 'Single molecule network analysis identifies structural changes to caveolae and scaffolds due to mutation of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain.', 'Homotrimer cavin1 interacts with caveolin1 to facilitate tumor growth and activate microglia through extracellular vesicles in glioma.']"""

Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the effects of CPT on the expression of MMP-9 and VEGF, which are important factors for the invasion of tumors. In vitro application of CPT resulted in a slight inhibition of cell proliferation and a significant reduction in the matrigel invasion of DU145 cells. Treatment with CPT also downregulated phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)- and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced MMP-9 and VEGF expression by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity. Downregulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt phosphorylation in response to CPT was revealed as an upstream pathway regulating the expression of MMP-9 and VEGF accompanying the inhibition of NF-κB activity. We further confirmed that CPT inhibits PMA-induced MMP-9 and VEGF expression by upregulating nuclear factor-erythroid related factor-2 (Nrf2)-mediated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction. Taken together, these data indicate that CPT inhibits the invasion of cancer cells accompanied by suppression of MMP-9 and VEGF production by suppressing the PI3K/Akt-mediated NF-κB pathway and enhancing the Nrf2-dependent HO-1 pathway, suggesting that CPT may be a good candidate to inhibit MMP-9 and VEGF expression.""","""['Rajapaksha Gedara Prasad Tharanga Jayasooriya', 'Sang Rul Park', 'Yung Hyun Choi', 'Jin-Won Hyun', 'Weon-Young Chang', 'Gi-Young Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Environ Toxicol Pharmacol""","""['18β-Glycyrrhetinic acid suppresses TNF-α induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor by suppressing the Akt-dependent NF-κB pathway.', 'Tianeptine sodium salt suppresses TNF-α-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in human carcinoma cells via suppression of the PI3K/Akt-mediated NF-κB pathway.', 'Suppression of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced tumor cell invasion by bergamottin via the inhibition of protein kinase Cdelta/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and JNK/nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression.', 'Type XIX collagen: A new partner in the interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment.', 'The Protective Effects of Flavonoids in Cataract Formation through the Activation of Nrf2 and the Inhibition of MMP-9.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Luteolin Synergistically Enhances Antitumor Activity of Oxaliplatin in Colorectal Carcinoma via AMPK Inhibition.', 'Heme oxygenase 1: a novel oncogene in multiple gynecological cancers.', 'Nrf2 Down-Regulation by Camptothecin Favors Inhibiting Invasion, Metastasis and Angiogenesis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Natural Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Compounds in Foodstuff or Medicinal Herbs Inducing Heme Oxygenase-1 Expression.']"""

Corresponding myeloid cell infiltration into primary tumors is a negative prognostic factor in some malignancies. The aim of this study was to define the exact role of stromal myofibroblasts and stromal factors in early prostate carcinoma (PCa) regulating monocyte infiltration and differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs). Epithelial and stromal primary cultures were generated from PCa biopsies and their purity confirmed. Stromal cells produced significantly more of the (C-C) motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) than epithelial cells. Monocyte chemoattraction was predominantly due to stromal-derived factors, mainly CCL2. DCs generated in the presence of stromal (but not epithelial) factors upregulated CD209, but failed to downregulate the monocyte marker CD14 in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent manner. Monocytes exposed to stromal factors did not produce detectable amounts of IL-10, however, upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, stromal factor generated dendritic cells (sDC) produced significantly more IL-10 and less IL-12 than their conventional DC counterparts. sDC failed to cross-present tumor-antigen to CD8+ T cells and suppressed T-cell proliferation. Most importantly, sDC expressed significantly elevated levels of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in a primarily STAT3 and IL-6-dependent manner.

The goal of this study is to identify demographic and economic factors that decrease the likelihood of patients with prostate cancer (PC) receiving RARP.  Design, setting and participants:   A retrospective, pooled, cross-sectional study was conducted using 2009-2011 California State Inpatient Data and American Hospital Association data. Patients who were diagnosed with PC and underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) from 225 hospitals in California were identified, using ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes.  Primary outcome measures:   Patients' likelihood of receiving RARP was associated with patient and hospital characteristics using the two models: (1) between-hospital and (2) within-hospital models. Multivariate binomial logistic regression was used for both models. The first model predicted patient access to RARP-performing hospitals versus non-RARP-performing hospitals, after adjusting for patient and hospital-level covariates (between-hospital variation). The second model examined the likelihood of patients receiving RARP within RARP-performing hospitals (within-hospital variation).  Results:   Among 20,411 patients who received RP, 13,750 (67.4%) received RARP, while 6661 (32.6%) received non-RARP. This study found significant differences in access to RARP-performing hospitals when race/ethnicity, income and insurance status were compared, after controlling for selected confounding factors (all p<0.001). For example, Hispanic, Medicare and Medicaid patients were more likely to be treated at non-RARP-performing hospitals versus RARP-performing hospitals. Within RARP-performing hospitals, Medicaid patients had 58% lower odds of receiving RARP versus non-RARP (adjusted OR 0.42, p<0.001). However, there were no significant differences by race/ethnicity or income within RARP-performing hospitals.  Conclusions:   Significant differences exist by race/ethnicity and payer status in accessing RARP-performing hospitals. Furthermore, payer status continues to be an important predictor of receiving RARP within RARP-performing hospitals.""","""['Jungyoon Kim', 'Wael ElRayes', 'Fernando Wilson', 'Dejun Su', 'Dmitry Oleynikov', 'Marsha Morien', 'Li-Wu Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Robot-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy utilization in hospitals offering robotics.', 'Robot-assisted Versus Open Radical Prostatectomy: A Contemporary Analysis of an All-payer Discharge Database.', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'Disparities in access to robotic technology and perioperative outcomes among patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Insurance Disparities in Access to Robotic Surgery for Colorectal Cancer.', 'Population-Based Assessment of Determining Predictors for Discharge Disposition in Patients with Bladder Cancer Undergoing Radical Cystectomy.', 'Socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of primary robotic hernia repair.', 'Are there disparities in access to robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery among pediatric urology patients?

Salicylate activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by binding at the A-769662 drug binding site on the AMPK β1-subunit, a mechanism that is distinct from metformin which disrupts the adenylate charge of the cell. A hallmark of many cancers is high rates of fatty acid synthesis and AMPK inhibits this pathway through phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). It is currently unknown whether targeting the AMPK-ACC-lipogenic pathway using salicylate and/or metformin may be effective for inhibiting cancer cell survival. Salicylate suppresses clonogenic survival of prostate and lung cancer cells at therapeutic concentrations achievable following the ingestion of aspirin (<1.0 mM); effects not observed in prostate (PNT1A) and lung (MRC-5) epithelial cell lines. Salicylate concentrations of 1 mM increased the phosphorylation of ACC and suppressed de novo lipogenesis and these effects were enhanced with the addition of clinical concentrations of metformin (100 μM) and eliminated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in AMPK β1. Supplementation of media with fatty acids and/or cholesterol reverses the suppressive effects of salicylate and metformin on cell survival indicating the inhibition of de novo lipogenesis is probably important.

Methods:   This was a multicentre trial (three sites) with imbalanced randomization (1 : 2). From 2008 to 2011, patients with localized prostate cancer were randomized 1 : 2 to usual care (N = 77) or usual care plus a decision aid presenting risks and benefits of different treatments (N = 163). The treatments were surgery and (external or interstitial) radiotherapy. Regret was assessed before, and 6 and 12 months after treatment, using the Decisional regret scale by Brehaut et al. (Medical Decision Making, 23, 2003, 281), and three new scales focusing on process, option and outcome regret. The relation between decision aid and regret was analysed by anova.  Results:   The concurrent validity of the new regret scales was confirmed by correlations between regret and anxiety, depression, decision evaluation scales and health-related quality of life. With a decision aid, patient participation was increased (P = 0.002), but regret was not. If anything, in patients with serious morbidity the decision aid resulted in a trend to less option regret and less Brehaut regret (P = 0.075 and P = 0.061, with effect sizes of 0.35 and 0.38, respectively). Exploratory analyses suggest that high-risk patients benefitted most from the decision aid.  Conclusion:   The new regret scales may be of value in distinguishing separate aspects of regret.

Inhibiting Hsp90 consequently is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy as the concomitant degradation of multiple oncoproteins may lead to effective antineoplastic agents. Here we report a novel C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitor, designated KU675, that exhibits potent antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity along with client protein degradation without induction of the heat-shock response in both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, KU675 demonstrates direct inhibition of Hsp90 complexes as measured by the inhibition of luciferase refolding in prostate cancer cells. In direct binding studies, the internal fluorescence signal of KU675 was used to determine the binding affinity of KU675 to recombinant Hsp90α, Hsp90β, and Hsc70 proteins. The binding affinity (Kd) for Hsp90α was determined to be 191 μM, whereas the Kd for Hsp90β was 726 μM, demonstrating a preference for Hsp90α. Western blot experiments with four different prostate cancer cell lines treated with KU675 supported this selectivity by inducing the degradation of Hsp90α -: dependent client proteins. KU675 also displayed binding to Hsc70 with a Kd value at 76.3 μM, which was supported in cellular by lower levels of Hsc70-specific client proteins on Western blot analyses. Overall, these findings suggest that KU675 is an Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitor, as well as a dual inhibitor of Hsc70, and may have potential use for the treatment of cancer.""","""['Weiya Liu', 'George A Vielhauer', 'Jeffrey M Holzbeierlein', 'Huiping Zhao', 'Suman Ghosh', 'Douglas Brown', 'Eugene Lee', 'Brian S J Blagg']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['KU135, a novel novobiocin-derived C-terminal inhibitor of the 90-kDa heat shock protein, exerts potent antiproliferative effects in human leukemic cells.', 'Development and characterization of a novel C-terminal inhibitor of Hsp90 in androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Characterization of a novel novobiocin analogue as a putative C-terminal inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Novobiocin and additional inhibitors of the Hsp90 C-terminal nucleotide-binding pocket.', 'Novobiocin Analogs as Potential Anticancer Agents.', 'Recent advances toward the development of Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitors.', 'Hsp90β inhibition upregulates interferon response and enhances immune checkpoint blockade therapy in murine tumors.', 'Cytosolic Hsp90 Isoform-Specific Functions and Clinical Significance.', 'Selective Inhibition of the Hsp90α Isoform.', 'The Development of Hsp90β-Selective Inhibitors to Overcome Detriments Associated with pan-Hsp90 Inhibition.']"""

A 4-month randomised trial in middle-aged men""","""Background:   Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol with purported inhibitory effects on prostate growth and cancer development. A number of studies have demonstrated that resveratrol reduces prostate growth in animal models and reduces prostate cell growth in vitro. Based on these pre-clinical findings, interest in resveratrol is increasing in relation to the management of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. So far, no human trials have evaluated the effects of resveratrol on circulating androgens, prostate size, or biochemical markers of prostate size.  Methods:   In a randomized placebo controlled clinical study using two doses of resveratrol (150 mg or 1,000 mg resveratrol daily) for 4 months, we evaluated the effects on prostate size, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and sex steroid hormones in 66 middle-aged men suffering from the metabolic syndrome(MetS).  Results:   At baseline, prostate size and PSA were positively correlated (R = 0.34, P < 0.007) as was prostate size and age (R = 0.37, P < 0.003). Prostate size did not correlate with testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or any other androgen precursor at baseline. The highest dose of resveratrol lowered the serum level of androstenedione 24% (P = 0.052), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 41% (P < 0.01), and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS) 50% (p<0.001), compared to the control group. However, prostate size and levels of PSA, testosterone, free testosterone and DHT remained unchanged.  Conclusion:   In this population of middle-aged men suffering from MetS, high dose resveratrol (1,000 mg daily) administration for 4 months significantly lowered serum levels of the androgen precursors androstenedione, DHEA and DHEAS, whereas prostate size and circulating levels of PSA, testosterone, free testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone were unaffected.

To help this choice, our study aimed to analyze BCR-free survival and factors associated with BCR in patients with PSM and undetectable postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Methods:   Between 2005 and 2008, 630 patients had RP for localized prostate cancer in our center. We included patients with PSM, uninvaded nods, undetectable postoperative PSA and no adjuvant treatment. The 5-year BCR-free survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Logistic regression models were used to determine the factors associated with BCR in univariate and multivariate analyses (Cox model).  Results:   The PSM rate was 32.7 % (n = 206 patients), and 110 patients corresponded to the inclusion criteria. The median follow-up was 72 months. The BCR rate was 30 % with a 5-year BCR-free survival of 83.9 %. The factors significantly associated with BCR were preoperative PSA, predominance and percentage of Gleason 4, tumor volume, PSM length and predominance of Gleason 4 at the margin.

Conclusion:   Over a 5-year follow-up, only one-third of patients experienced BCR. It might be reasonable to postpone adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with PSM and undetectable PSA after RP.

We conducted this study to determine whether acupuncture is really an effective therapeutic modality for CP/CPPS in terms of >50% decrease in total National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score from baseline compared with sham.  Methods:   One hundred patients with CP/CPPS (category III B) in an outpatient urology clinic were randomized to receive acupuncture at either seven acupoints bilaterally or sham points adjacent to these points. NIH-CPSI was completed by each patient before and 6, 8, 16, 24 weeks after the treatment. Mean values of total CPSI score and subscores after the treatment and on follow-up following the treatment were compared.  Results:   Of the acupuncture participants, 92% were NIH-CPSI responders (>50% decrease in total NIH-CPSI score from baseline) compared with 48% of sham participants, 8 weeks after the end of the therapy. Both groups experienced significant decrease in CPSI subscores throughout the whole follow-up period; however, the decline remained significantly greater in the active acupuncture group as compared with the sham group.  Conclusions:   Our results show that the use of acupuncture in treatment of men with CP/CPPS symptoms resulted in a significant decrease in total NIH-CPSI scores.""","""['S Sahin', 'M Bicer', 'G A Eren', 'S Tas', 'V Tugcu', 'A I Tasci', 'M Cek']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Efficacy of acupuncture for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndromes: study protocol for a randomized, sham acupuncture-controlled trial.', 'Acupuncture versus sham acupuncture for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain.', 'Effectiveness of acupuncture in patients with category IIIB chronic pelvic pain syndrome: a report of 97 patients.', 'Non-pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.', 'Non-pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.', 'Analgesic Efficacy of Acupuncture on Chronic Pelvic Pain: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis Study.', 'Acupuncture for Chronic Prostatitis or Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Acupuncture for Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome: A GRADE-assessed Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Comparative efficacy of acupuncture-related therapy for migraine: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Clinical Review of Neuromusculoskeletal Complementary and Alternative Approaches for the Treatment of Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome.']"""

However, the influence of intraprostatic inflammation on serum PSA in men without biopsy indication and negative for prostate cancer has not been described in detail.  Methods:   We studied 224 men in the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) who underwent end-of-study biopsy per trial protocol, had PSA <4 ng ml(-1), normal digital rectal examination and a biopsy negative for cancer. We analyzed data from hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides containing a mean of three biopsy cores. Inflammation measures included the extent (percentage of tissue area with inflammation) and intensity (product of scores for extent and grade) of total, acute and chronic inflammation in the entire tissue area examined, and by tissue compartment. We calculated median measures of inflammation by prebiopsy serum PSA tertile (>0 to ≤0.8, >0.8 to ≤1.5 and >1.5 to <4.0 ng ml(-1)). We estimated the association between percentage of tissue area with inflammation and natural logarithm of PSA using linear regression adjusting for age at biopsy.  Results:   Median percentage of tissue area with inflammation increased from 2 to 5 to 9.5% across PSA tertiles (P-trend <0.0001). For every 5% increase in tissue area with inflammation, log PSA increased by 0.061 ng ml(-1) (P=0.0002). Median extent and intensity scores increased across PSA tertiles in luminal and intraepithelial compartments for acute inflammation and in stromal and intraepithelial compartments for chronic inflammation (all P-trend ≤0.05).

A recent study identified 22 candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PCSM in a Seattle-based patient cohort. Five of these associations were replicated in an independent Swedish cohort.  Methods:   We genotyped these 22 SNPs in Physicians' Health Study (PHS) participants diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa). Using the same model that was found to be most significant in the Seattle cohort, we examined the association of these SNPs with lethal disease with Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   One SNP, rs5993891 in the ARVCF gene on chromosome 22q11, which had also replicated in the Swedish cohort, was also significantly associated with PCSM in the PHS cohort (hazard ratio (HR)=0.32; P=0.01). When we tested this SNP in an additional cohort (Health Professionals Follow-up Study, HPFS), the association was null (HR=0.95, P=0.90); however, a meta-analysis across all studies showed a statistically significant association with a HR of 0.52 (0.29-0.93, P=0.03).  Conclusions:   The association of rs5993891 with PCSM was further replicated in PHS and remains significant in a meta-analysis, though there was no association in HPFS. This SNP may contribute to a genetic panel of SNPs to determine at diagnosis whether a patient is more likely to exhibit an indolent or aggressive form of PCa.

The quantitative differences in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion expression have received very limited attention in the literature.  Methods:   We have quantitatively analyzed the mRNA levels of TMPRSS2-ERG, ERG, PTEN, and AR (n = 83), as well as ERG immunostaining (n = 78) in a series of prostate tumors.  Results:   Among the TMPRSS2-ERG cases (n = 57), high fusion levels were associated with GS ≥8 (P = 0.025). ERG mRNA overexpression was associated with GS ≥8 (P = 0.047), and with stage T3-T4 tumors (P = 0.032). Among the ERG overexpressing cases (n = 54), higher expression levels were found in 92.3% of GS ≥8 tumors (P = 0.02). ERG immunostaining, regardless of staining intensity, was also associated with high stage (P = 0.05). There was a statistical association between ERG immunostaining and PSA progression-free survival (Log Rank test, P = 0.048). Decreased PTEN expression was associated with TMPRSS2-ERG (P = 0.01), ERG mRNA overexpression (P = 0.003) and ERG immunostaining (P = 0.007). Furthermore, decreased PTEN expression, alone (P = 0.041) and also combined with TMPRSS2-ERG (P = 0.04) or with ERG overexpression (P = 0.04) was associated with GS ≥7 tumors.  Conclusions:   Although more studies are needed to further clarify their role, our findings emphasize that the expression levels of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and ERG mRNA, rather than their mere presence, are related to a more aggressive phenotype, have an effect on prognosis and could be molecular markers of progression for prostate cancer.

Active surveillance and watchful waiting are increasingly recommended to patients with small tumors felt to be low risk, highlighting the difficulties of Gleason scoring in this setting. There is an urgent need for predictive biomarkers that can be rapidly deployed to aid in clinical decision-making. Our objectives were to assess the incidence and ability of PTEN alterations to predict aggressive disease in a multicenter study.  Methods:   We used recently developed probes optimized for sensitivity and specificity in a four-color FISH deletion assay to study the Canary Retrospective multicenter Prostate Cancer Tissue Microarray (TMA). This TMA was constructed specifically for biomarker validation from radical prostatectomy specimens, and is accompanied by detailed clinical information with long-term follow-up.  Results:   In 612 prostate cancers, the overall rate of PTEN deletion was 112 (18.3%). Hemizygous PTEN losses were present in 55/612 (9.0%) of cancers, whereas homozygous PTEN deletion was observed in 57/612 (9.3%) of tumors. Significant associations were found between PTEN status and pathologic stage (P < 0.0001), seminal vesicle invasion (P = 0.0008), extracapsular extension (P < 0.0001), and Gleason score (P = 0.0002). In logistic regression analysis of clinical and pathological variables, PTEN deletion was significantly associated with extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement, and higher Gleason score. In the 406 patients in which clinical information was available, PTEN homozygous (P = 0.009) deletion was associated with worse post-operative recurrence-free survival (number of events = 189), pre-operative prostate specific antigen (PSA) (P < 0.001), and pathologic stage (P = 0.03).  Conclusion:   PTEN status assessed by FISH is an independent predictor for recurrence-free survival in multivariate models, as were seminal vesicle invasion, extracapsular extension, and Gleason score, and preoperative PSA. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that the assay can be readily introduced at first diagnosis in a cost effective manner analogous to the use of FISH for analysis of HER2/neu status in breast cancer. Combined with published research beginning 17 years ago, both the data and tools now exist to implement a PTEN assay in the clinic.""","""['Dean A Troyer', 'Tamara Jamaspishvili', 'Wei Wei', 'Ziding Feng', 'Jennifer Good', 'Sarah Hawley', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Jesse K McKenney', 'Jeff Simko', 'Antonio Hurtado-Coll', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Martin Gleave', 'Raymond Lance', 'Daniel W Lin', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Lawrence D True', 'James D Brooks', 'Jeremy A Squire']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A multivariate analysis of clinical and pathological factors that predict for prostate specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Use of Gleason score, prostate specific antigen, seminal vesicle and margin status to predict biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic value of seminal vesicle involvement due to prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Clinical implications of PTEN loss in prostate cancer.', 'Clinicopathological features of primary seminal vesicle adenocarcinoma: A report of 4 cases and review of the literature.', 'Prognostic Values of Gene Copy Number Alterations in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic Features of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer Following Radical Prostatectomy Based on Multiparametric MRI and Immunohistochemistry Analysis of MRI-guided Biopsy Specimens.', 'Grading Evolution and Contemporary Prognostic Biomarkers of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Genetic Landscape of Prostate Cancer Conspicuity on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Systematic Review and Bioinformatic Analysis.', 'High throughput assessment of biomarkers in tissue microarrays using artificial intelligence: PTEN loss as a proof-of-principle in multi-center prostate cancer cohorts.']"""

Cases with thyroid cancer (n = 104) were recruited from 1992 to 2001 and diagnosed through 2009, and controls (n = 208) were individually matched (2:1) to cases by race, sex, birth date (within 1 year), center, and blood collection date (within 15 days).

There is an unmet requirement of clinically useful biomarkers for early detection of prostate cancer to reduce the liabilities of overtreatment and accompanying morbidity. The present population-based study investigates the factors disrupting expression of multiple functionally related genes of DNA mismatch repair pathway in prostate cancer patients to identify molecular attributes distinguishing adenocarcinoma from benign hyperplasia of prostate. Gene expression was compared between tissue samples from prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia using real-time-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Assessment of genotypes of seven single-nucleotide-polymorphisms of three MMR genes was conducted using PCR-coupled RFLP and sequencing. Promoter methylation was interrogated by methylation-specific-PCR and bisulfite-sequencing. Interaction between microRNAs and MMR genes was verified by 3'UTR-based dual luciferase assays. Concurrent reduction of three MMR genes namely hMLH1, hMSH6 and hMSH2 (34-85%, P<0.05) was observed in prostate cancer tissues. hMSH6 polymorphism rs1800932(Pro92Pro) conferred a borderline protection in cancer patients (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.15-0.75). Relative transcript level of hMLH1 was inversely related (r = -0.59, P<0.05) with methylation quotient of its promoter which showed a significantly higher methylation density (P = 0.008, Z = -2.649) in cancer patients. hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-141 and hsa-miR-21 gene expressions were significantly elevated (66-85%, P<0.05) in tumor specimens and negatively correlated (r = -0.602 to -0.527, P<0.05) with that of MMR genes. hsa-miR-155 & hsa-miR-141 and hsa-miR-155 & hsa-miR-21 were demonstrated to bind to their putative seed sequences in hMLH1 and hMSH6 3'UTRs respectively. Relatively higher expression of DNA methyl-transferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) and HIF-1α genes (34-50%, P<0.05) were also detected in tumor tissues. This study provides statistical evidence that MMR deficiency is correlated with hypermethylation of hMLH1 promoter and upregulation of hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-141 and hsa-miR-21 in prostate cancer.

In vitro, A10 NCs were selectively internalized across a panel of PSMA-expressing cancer cell lines, and when incorporating Doxo, A10 Doxo-PLA NCs exerted greater cytotoxic effects compared to nonfunctionalized Doxo-PLA NCs and free Doxo.

Several technologies have been proposed to cope with the bias from RNA cross-linking and degradation associated with archival specimens to generate data comparable with RNA from fresh-frozen materials. Direct comparison studies of these RNA expression platforms remain rare. We compared two commercially available platforms for RNA expression profiling of archival FFPE specimens from clinical studies of prostate and ovarian cancer: the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0ST Array following whole-transcriptome amplification using the NuGen WT-Ovation FFPE System V2, and the NanoString nCounter without amplification. For each assay, we profiled 7 prostate and 11 ovarian cancer specimens, with a block age of 4 to 21 years. Both platforms produced gene expression profiles with high sensitivity and reproducibility through technical repeats from FFPE materials. Sensitivity and reproducibility remained high across block age within each cohort. A strong concordance was shown for the transcript expression values for genes detected by both platforms. We showed the biological validity of specific gene signatures generated by both platforms for both cohorts.

Epub 2014 Apr 14""","""Background:   The androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide is approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that has progressed on docetaxel. Our aim was to assess the activity and safety of enzalutamide monotherapy in men with hormone-naive prostate cancer.  Methods:   This trial is an ongoing open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, done across 12 European sites. Men aged over 18 years with hormone-naive prostate cancer for whom hormone therapy was indicated, and who had noncastration levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 2ng/mL or greater at screening, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0, received oral enzalutamide 160mg/day. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an 80% or greater decline in PSA at week 25. All analyses included all patients who had received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01302041.  Findings:   67 men were enrolled into the study. 62 patients (92.5%, 95% CI: 86.2-98.8) had a decline in PSA of 80% or greater at week 25. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events up to week 25 were gynaecomastia (n = 24), fatigue (n = 23), nipple pain (n = 13), and hot flush (n = 12), all of which were of mild to moderate severity. Overall, 9 patients had a treatment-emergent adverse event of grade 3 or higher, most of which were reported in one patient each, except for pneumonia (grade 3, two patients) and hypertension (grade 3, four patients). Five patients reported serious adverse events, none of which were deemed to be treatment related.  Interpretation:   Our findings suggest that enzalutamide monotherapy in men with hormone-naive prostate cancer of varying severity provides a level of disease suppression and was generally well tolerated. These findings provide a rationale for further investigation of clinical response and outcomes with enzalutamide in noncastrated men with prostate cancer.""","""['Donald Trump']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Enzalutamide monotherapy in hormone-naive prostate cancer: primary analysis of an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study.', 'Enzalutamide monotherapy in hormone-naive prostate cancer: primary analysis of an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study.', 'Commentary on: ""Ipilimumab versus placebo after radiotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy (CA184-043): A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.""

The predicted 3-dimensional (3D) dose distribution was calculated by back-projection of relative dose error distribution per beam. A 3D gamma analysis of different organs (prostate: clinical [CTV] and planned target volumes [PTV], rectum, bladder, femoral heads; H&N: gross tumor volume [GTV], CTV, spinal cord, brain stem, both parotids) was performed using predicted and planned dose distributions under 2%/2 mm tolerance and physical gamma passing rate was calculated. TCP and NTCP values were calculated for voxels with physical gamma indices (PGI) >1. We propose a new radiobiological gamma index (RGI) to quantify the radiobiological effects of TCP and NTCP and calculate radiobiological gamma passing rates.  Results:   The mean RGI gamma passing rates for prostate cases were significantly different compared with those of PGI (P<.03-.001). The mean RGI gamma passing rates for H&N cases (except for GTV) were significantly different compared with those of PGI (P<.001). Differences in gamma passing rates between PGI and RGI were due to dose differences between the planned and predicted dose distributions. Radiobiological gamma distribution was visualized to identify areas where the dose was radiobiologically important.  Conclusions:   RGI was proposed to integrate radiobiological effects into PGI. This index would assist physicians and medical physicists not only in physical evaluations of treatment delivery accuracy, but also in clinical evaluations of predicted dose distribution.""","""['Iori Sumida', 'Hajime Yamaguchi', 'Hisao Kizaki', 'Keiko Aboshi', 'Mari Tsujii', 'Nobuhiko Yoshikawa', 'Yuji Yamada', 'Osamu Suzuki', 'Yuji Seo', 'Fumiaki Isohashi', 'Yasuo Yoshioka', 'Kazuhiko Ogawa']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Three-dimensional dose prediction and validation with the radiobiological gamma index based on a relative seriality model for head-and-neck IMRT.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'Experience-based quality control of clinical intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Online Adaptive Radiation Therapy.', 'Assessment of using a gamma index analysis for patient-specific quality assurance in Japan.', 'Dosimetric comparison between volumetric modulated arc therapy planning techniques for prostate cancer in the presence of intrafractional organ deformation.', 'Monte Carlo Modeling of the Agility MLC for IMRT and VMAT Calculations.', 'Monte Carlo Calculation of the Energy Spectrum of a 6 MeV Electron Beam using PENetration and Energy Loss of Positrons and Electrons Code.', 'Incorporating biological modeling into patient-specific plan verification.']"""

The outcomes of a consensus meeting on focal prostate brachytherapy were used to investigate optimal dosimetry of focal low-dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy targeted using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) and transperineal template prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy, including the effects of random and systematic seed displacements and interseed attenuation (ISA).  Methods and materials:   Nine patients were selected according to clinical characteristics and concordance of TPM and mp-MRI. Retrospectively, 3 treatment plans were analyzed for each case: whole-gland (WG), hemi-gland (hemi), and ultra-focal (UF) plans, with 145-Gy prescription dose and identical dose constraints for each plan. Plan robustness to seed displacement and ISA were assessed using Monte Carlo simulations.  Results:   WG plans used a mean 28 needles and 81 seeds, hemi plans used 17 needles and 56 seeds, and UF plans used 12 needles and 25 seeds. Mean D90 (minimum dose received by 90% of the target) and V100 (percentage of the target that receives 100% dose) values were 181.3 Gy and 99.8% for the prostate in WG plans, 195.7 Gy and 97.8% for the hemi-prostate in hemi plans, and 218.3 Gy and 99.8% for the focal target in UF plans. Mean urethra D10 was 205.9 Gy, 191.4 Gy, and 92.4 Gy in WG, hemi, and UF plans, respectively. Mean rectum D2 cm(3) was 107.5 Gy, 77.0 Gy, and 42.7 Gy in WG, hemi, and UF plans, respectively. Focal plans were more sensitive to seed displacement errors: random shifts with a standard deviation of 4 mm reduced mean target D90 by 14.0%, 20.5%, and 32.0% for WG, hemi, and UF plans, respectively. ISA has a similar impact on dose-volume histogram parameters for all plan types.  Conclusions:   Treatment planning for focal LDR brachytherapy is feasible. Dose constraints are easily met with a notable reduction to organs at risk. Treating smaller targets makes seed positioning more critical.""","""['Bashar Al-Qaisieh', 'Josh Mason', 'Peter Bownes', 'Ann Henry', 'Louise Dickinson', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Mark Emberton', 'Stephen Langley']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Dosimetry modeling for focal high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Hemi-gland focal low dose rate prostate brachytherapy: An analysis of dosimetric outcomes.', 'A comparison of treatment planning techniques for low-dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy.', 'Three-dimensional conformal brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Creation of a protective space between the rectum and prostate prior to prostate radiotherapy using a hydrogel spacer.', 'Low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Reductions in prostatic doses are associated with less acute morbidity in patients undergoing Pd-103 brachytherapy: Substantiation of the rationale for focal therapy.', 'Focal therapy for prostate cancer: the technical challenges.', 'Focal application of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: a pilot study.', 'An update on focal therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

There are many examples of how CBPR has been useful for generating culturally specific solutions for different health issues that affect African-Americans. However, few examples exist in the literature on how the CBPR approach can be applied to address prostate cancer. This paper describes a collaborative process for linking inner-city, African-American men to free prostate cancer education, physician counseling, and screening opportunities (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination (DRE)). The site of this community-based participatory project was the city of Buffalo, located in Erie County, New York. The collaborative, community-academic process that is described includes the following: (1) planning and conducting a community needs assessment to contextualize local prostate cancer issues, (2) organizing town and gown event planning, and (3) manipulating aspects of the built environment to build an infrastructure within the community to address disparities in screening opportunities.

Its optimal management remains largely undefined given a lack of prospective, randomized data to inform practice. We sought to describe modern practice patterns in the management of cN+ PCa and assess the effect of adding radiation therapy (RT) to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on survival using the National Cancer Data Base.  Methods:   Patients with cN+ PCa and without distant metastases diagnosed between 2004 and 2011 were included. Five-year overall survival for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2006 and treated with ADT alone or ADT+RT were compared. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to balance baseline characteristics, and Cox multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality.  Results:   Of 3540 total patients, 32.2% were treated with ADT alone and 51.4% received ADT+RT. Compared with ADT alone, patients treated with ADT+RT were younger and more likely to have private insurance, lower comorbidity scores, higher Gleason scores, and lower PSA values. After PS matching, 318 patients remained in each group. Compared with ADT alone, ADT+RT was associated with a 50% decreased risk of five-year all-cause mortality (HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.37 to 0.67, two-sided P < .001; crude OS rate: 71.5% vs 53.2%).  Conclusions:   Using a large national database, we have identified a statistically significant survival benefit for patients with cN+ PCa treated with ADT+RT. These data, if appropriately validated by randomized trials, suggest that a substantial proportion of such patients at high risk for prostate cancer death may be undertreated, warranting a reevaluation of current practice guidelines.""","""['Chun Chieh Lin', 'Phillip J Gray', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Jason A Efstathiou']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['RE: Androgen Deprivation With or Without Radiation Therapy for Clinically Node-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Response.', 'Words of Wisdom.

The primary objectives were to determine whether CTCs are measurable in patients with BR and whether it can reliably predict prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase and PSA doubling times (PSADTs).  Methods:   BR was identified in patients after prostatectomy or radiation or both, with a PSA increase of ≥ 0.2 for prior prostatectomy or > 2 mg/dL increase for post-nadir in prior radiotherapy. CTCs were enumerated at baseline at the time of study entry using the CellSearch (Janssen Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ) test.  Results:   The median age for all 36 patients accrued was 69.5 years (range, 51-91) with a median PSA of 1.65 ng/mL (range, 0.2-65.8). Gleason scores ranged from 5 to 9 (median, 7).

Technological advancements to interrogate omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, interactomics, etc.) provide widely open opportunities in population-based research. Molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) represents integrative science of molecular pathology and epidemiology. This unified paradigm requires multidisciplinary collaboration between pathology, epidemiology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and computational biology. Integration of these fields enables better understanding of etiologic heterogeneity, disease continuum, causal inference, and the impact of environment, diet, lifestyle, host factors (including genetics and immunity), and their interactions on disease evolution. Hence, the Second International MPE Meeting was held in Boston in December 2014, with aims to: (1) develop conceptual and practical frameworks; (2) cultivate and expand opportunities; (3) address challenges; and (4) initiate the effort of specifying guidelines for MPE. The meeting mainly consisted of presentations of method developments and recent data in various malignant neoplasms and tumors (breast, prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancers, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and leukemia), followed by open discussion sessions on challenges and future plans.

The mechanism of its down-regulation, however, is not clear. Here, we show that the 3' untranslated region of CSR1 contains a target site of miR-650. High level of miR-650 was found in prostate cancer samples and cell lines. Degradation of miR-650 by specific inhibitor dramatically increased the expression levels of CSR1. Interaction between miR-650 and its target site in the 3' untranslated region was validated through luciferase reporter system. Mutation at the target site completely abrogated the activity of miR-650 on the 3' untranslated region of CSR1. Inhibition of miR-650 reversed the expression suppression of CSR1, suppressed colony formation, and blocked cell cycle entry to the S phase of both PC3 and DU145 cells. Animal model showed significant decrease of tumor volume, rate of metastasis, and mortality of severe combined immunodeficient mice xenografted with PC3 or DU145 cells transformed with inhibitor of miR-650.

However, it remains to be determined whether finasteride concentrations may affect prostate cancer risk. In this study, we examined the association between serum finasteride concentrations and the risk of prostate cancer in the treatment arm of the PCPT and determined factors involved in modifying drug concentrations.  Methods:   Data for this nested case-control study are from the PCPT. Cases were drawn from men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and matched controls. Finasteride concentrations were measured using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry validated assay. The association of serum finasteride concentrations with prostate cancer risk was determined by logistic regression. We also examine whether polymorphisms in the enzyme target and metabolism genes of finasteride are related to drug concentrations using linear regression.  Results and conclusions:   Among men with detectable finasteride concentrations, there was no association between finasteride concentrations and prostate cancer risk, low-grade or high-grade, when finasteride concentration was analyzed as a continuous variable or categorized by cutoff points. Since there was no concentration-dependent effect on prostate cancer, any exposure to finasteride intake may reduce prostate cancer risk. Of the twenty-seven SNPs assessed in the enzyme target and metabolism pathway, five SNPs in two genes, CYP3A4 (rs2242480; rs4646437; rs4986910), and CYP3A5 (rs15524; rs776746) were significantly associated with modifying finasteride concentrations.

In the present study we were able to show by using a cDNA cancer profiling array that leupaxin is upregulated in breast and endometrial cancer, whereas downregulation of leupaxin was observed in lung cancer. In addition, immunohistochemical studies using a leupaxin-specific antibody on human breast cancer specimens (n=127) revealed that leupaxin is expressed mainly in invasive ductal carcinomas and ductal carcinoma in situ (40 and 49% respectively), and only in a minority of lobular mammary carcinomas. To further investigate the role of leupaxin in the progression of breast cancer the expression of leupaxin was analysed in six breast cancer cell lines. The estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive HCC70 and the ERα-negative MDA-MB‑231 cells showed leupaxin expression on the RNA and protein level. Leupaxin localizes in these mammary carcinoma cells at focal adhesion sites and shuttles between membrane and nucleus via its LD4 motif as major nuclear export signal. Interaction partners of leupaxin in the nucleus represent the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. Both ERα and ERβ bind to the LIM domains of leupaxin via their AF-1/DNA binding domains. Furthermore, leupaxin is able to induce transcriptional activity of ERα independent of the presence of estradiol. The specific downregulation of leupaxin expression using siRNAs in mammary carcinoma cells resulted in reduced migratory capability and diminished invasiveness whereas no effect on proliferation was observed. Collectively, these results show that leupaxin has particular influence on the progression and invasion of breast cancer cells and may therefore represent an interesting candidate protein for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.""","""['Silke Kaulfuss', 'Anna-Maria Herr', 'Anja Büchner', 'Bernhard Hemmerlein', 'Andreas R Günthert', 'Peter Burfeind']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Leupaxin, a novel coactivator of the androgen receptor, is expressed in prostate cancer and plays a role in adhesion and invasion of prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Expression of nuclear insulin receptor substrate 1 in breast cancer.', 'Expression and intranuclear distribution of nucleolin in estrogen receptor-negative and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers in women measured by laser scanning cytometry.', 'KISS1R induces invasiveness of estrogen receptor-negative human mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells.', 'Molecular mechanisms of leupaxin involved in prostate carcinoma metastasis.', 'Small interfering RNA-mediated LPXN silencing suppresses proliferation and enhances drug sensitivity of human acute monocytic leukemia SHI-1 cells in vitro.', 'Downregulation of LPXN expression by siRNA decreases the malignant proliferation and transmembrane invasion of SHI-1 cells.', 'An emerging link between LIM domain proteins and nuclear receptors.', 'Regulation of β-catenin transcription activity by leupaxin in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for haematuria not responding to conventional management. Only very few data exist for long-term follow-up after HBOT.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 15 patients referred for HBOT for haemorrhagic cystitis (HC). HBOT was performed for 130 min/day at a pressure of 2.4 atmospheres. We evaluated patient demographics, type of radio- and chemotherapy and characteristics of haematuria. The effect of HBOT was defined as complete or partial resolution of hematuria according to the RTOG/EORTC grade and Gray score.  Results:   A total of 15 patients (12 after radiotherapy, two after chemotherapy and one patient with a combination of both) were treated with a median of 34 HBO treatments. Radiotherapy patients received primary, adjuvant, salvage and HDR radiotherapy (60 - 78 Gy) for prostate, colon or cervical cancer. The patient with combination therapy and both of the chemotherapy patients were treated with cyclophosphamide. First episodes of haematuria occurred at a median of 48 months after completion of initial therapy. The first HBOT was performed at a median of 11 months after the first episode of hematuria. After a median of a 68-month follow-up after HBOT, 80% experienced a complete resolution and two patients suffered a singular new minor haematuria (p < 0.00001). A salvage-cystectomy was necessary in one patient. No adverse effects were documented.

Nevertheless, most of these cancers eventually relapse as they become less sensitive to androgen ablation and anti-androgen treatment. Elucidating the molecular events that are responsible for the conversion of androgen-sensitive cancers to androgen-refractory tumors may reveal new therapeutic opportunities.  Methods:   In the present study, we investigated nine androgen-sensitive and nine androgen-refractory prostate cancer samples to evaluate the expression levels of 10 selected proteins that have been implicated in oncogenesis and cancer progression.  Results:   Our immunohistochemical data show that three of the investigated proteins (i.e., minichromosome maintenance-2, methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, and androgen receptor) are expressed at significantly different levels in the androgen-refractory cancer samples than in the androgen-sensitive tumors, whereas the expression levels of the seven other studied proteins (i.e., β-catenin, p27, p21, p16, Ki67, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha, and geminin) are not significantly different regarding the two groups.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that the increased expression of minichromosome maintenance-2 and decreased expression of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase related to androgen receptor are indicative of the androgen-refractory stage in prostate cancer.

Nowell's description in 1976. Selective forces include those intrinsic to the host (including metastatic site) as well as those resulting from anti-cancer therapies. By examining the mutational status of multiple tumor sites within an individual patient some insight may be gained into those genetic variants that enhance site-specific metastasis. By comparing these data across multiple individuals, recurrent patterns may identify alterations that are fundamental to successful site-specific metastasis.  Methods:   We sequenced the mitochondrial genome in 10 prostate cancer patients with bone metastases enrolled in a rapid autopsy program. Patients had late stage disease and received androgen ablation and frequently other systemic therapies. For each of 9 patients, 4 separate tissues were sequenced: the primary prostate cancer, a soft tissue metastasis, a bone metastasis and an uninvolved normal tissue that served as the non-cancerous control. An additional (10th) patient had no primary prostate available for sequencing but had both metastatic sites (and control DNA) sequenced. We then examined the number and location of somatically acquired mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in the primary tumor and two metastatic sites in each individual patient. Finally, we compared patients with each other to determine any common patterns of somatic mutation.  Results:   Somatic mutations were significantly more numerous in the bone compared to either the primary tumor or soft tissue metastases. A missense mutation at nucleotide position (n.p.) 10398 (A10398G; Thr114Ala) in the respiratory complex I gene ND3 was the most common (7 of 10 patients) and was detected only in the bone. Other notable somatic mutations that occurred in more than one patient include a tRNA Arg mutation at n.p. 10436 and a tRNA Thr mutation at n.p. 15928. The tRNA Arg mutation was restricted to bone metastases and occurred in three of 10 patients (30%). Somatic mutation at 15928 was not restricted to the bone and also occurred in three patients.  Conclusions:   Mitochondrial genomic variation was greater in metastatic sites than in the primary tumor and bone metastases had statistically significantly greater numbers of somatic mutations than either the primary or the soft tissue metastases. The genome was not mutated randomly. At least one mutational ""hot-spot"" was identified at the individual base level (nucleotide position 10398 in bone metastases) indicating a pervasive selective pressure for bone metastatic cells that had acquired the 10398 mtDNA mutation.

Cell apoptosis was observed by flow cytometry analysis 24 h later. Then supernatant in four groups was extracted to test the concentration of TGF-β by ELISA at the time points of 5, 10, 20, 36, and 48 h.

Moreover, we found that group C has higher delayed apoptosis rate than group A, and group D has higher early apoptosis rate than other groups (P<0.05); compared with group A, C, D, group B has less TGF-β (P<0.05). Group C secrets more TGF-β than that in group A (P<0.05) and group D secrets more TGF-β than that in group C at the time points of 20, 36, 48 h (P<0.05); Group C and D expressed more Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 than group A and B at the time point of 10 h after treatment.

Background:   Lower urinary tract symptoms are a primary side effect after prostate cancer treatment.  Design:   A time-series survey design with descriptive and comparative elements.  Methods:   A sample of 51 prostate cancer patients was recruited: open radical prostatectomy = 20, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy = 23 and brachytherapy = 8. Data were collected at six time points: before treatment/baseline, 1 week post-treatment, 1 month post-treatment, 2 month post-treatment, 3 month post-treatment and 8 months post-treatment. The lower urinary tract symptoms were assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score, with a higher score indicating a worse condition. One-way anova was used to predict the progress of urinary symptoms after treatments. Bootstrap re-sampling was conducted to assess the stability of the outcomes.  Results:   Although there were no significant differences in the lower urinary tract symptoms among the three groups after treatments, the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group had the lowest International Prostate Symptom Score score at baseline. Compared with the baseline symptoms for patients undergoing each treatment, there were significant improvements after 2 months in the open radical prostatectomy and brachytherapy groups, and after 3 months in the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group.  Conclusions:   The prostate cancer patients undergoing the three treatments have similar lower urinary tract symptoms over 8-month follow-up although different lower urinary tract symptoms were presented before treatments.

Methods:   68 patients were selected. Carbon-ion scanning dose was calculated. Two different planning target volumes (PTVs) were defined: PTV1 was the clinical target volume plus a set-up margin for the anterior/lateral sides and posterior side, while PTV2 was the same as PTV1 minus the posterior side. Total prescribed doses of 34.4 Gy [relative biological effectiveness (RBE)] and 17.2 Gy (RBE) were given to PTV1 and PTV2, respectively. To estimate the influence of geometric variations on dose distribution, the dose was recalculated on the rigidly shifted single planning CT based on two dimensional-three dimensional rigid registration of the orthogonal radiographs before and after treatment for the fraction of maximum positional changes.  Results:   Intrafractional patient positional change values averaged over all patients throughout the treatment course were less than the target registration error = 2.00 mm and angular error = 1.27°. However, these maximum positional errors did not occur in all 12 treatment fractions. Even though large positional changes occurred during irradiation in all treatment fractions, lowest dose encompassing 95% of the target (D95)-PTV1 was >98% of the prescribed dose.  Conclusion:   Intrafractional patient positional changes occurred during treatment beam irradiation and degraded carbon-ion beam dose distribution.

The molecular mechanism of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still poorly understood. ESE3 is a member of the Ets transcription family, which is only expressed in epithelial tissues and acts as a tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer. Our study aim was to confirm whether ESE3 is involved in the carcinogenesis of ESCC. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ESE3 was mainly located in cell nuclei of normal tissues and the cytoplasm in ESCC tissues. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses of the normal esophageal cell line HEEpiC and ESCC cell lines EC9706 TE-1, KYSE150, and KYSE410 confirmed these results. pEGFP-ESE3 and pcDNA3.1-V5/HisA-ESE3 plasmids were constructed for overexpression of ESE3 in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells. The stably transfected cells showed restoration of the nuclear localization of ESE3. EC9706 cells with re-localization of ESE3 to the nucleus showed inhibition of proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion. To explore the possible mechanism of the differences in localization of ESE3 in normal esophageal cells and ESCC cells, ESCC cell lines were treated with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B, transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, PKC inhibitor sphinganine, P38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and CK II inhibitor TBCA. These reagents were chosen according to the well-known mechanisms of protein translocation. However, the localization of ESE3 was unchanged after these treatments. The sequence of ESE3 cDNA in ESCC cells was identical to the standard sequence of ESE3 in the NCBI Genebank database, indicating that there was no mutation in the coding region of ESE3 in ESCC. Taken together, our study suggests that ESE3 plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of ESCC through changes in subcellular localization and may act as a tumor suppressor gene in ESCC, although the mechanisms require further study.""","""['Li Wang', 'Jie Xing', 'Rui Cheng', 'Ying Shao', 'Peng Li', 'Shengtao Zhu', 'Shutian Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Epigenetic inactivation of secreted frizzled-related protein 2 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Elevated maspin expression is associated with better overall survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).', 'Profiling of differentially expressed cancer-related genes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) using human cancer cDNA arrays: overexpression of oncogene MET correlates with tumor differentiation in ESCC.', 'MAFB promotes the malignant phenotypes by IGFBP6 in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.', 'Targeted therapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: the NRF2 signaling pathway as target.', 'EHF is a novel regulator of cellular redox metabolism and predicts patient prognosis in HNSCC.', 'ESE3/EHF, a promising target of rosiglitazone, suppresses pancreatic cancer stemness by downregulating CXCR4.', 'Proteasome inhibitor MG132 suppresses pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-cell migration by increasing ESE3 expression.', 'ELF3, ELF5, EHF and SPDEF Transcription Factors in Tissue Homeostasis and Cancer.', 'ESE3 Inhibits Pancreatic Cancer Metastasis by Upregulating E-Cadherin.']"""

Ack1 tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in prostate cancer and promotes castrate resistant xenograft tumor growth and enhances androgen target gene expression and AR recruitment to enhancers. Ack1 phosphorylates AR at Tyr-267 and possibly Tyr-363, both in the N-terminal transactivation domain. In this study, the role of these phosphorylation sites was investigated by characterizing the phosphorylation site mutants in the context of full length and truncated AR lacking the ligand-binding domain. Y267F and Y363F mutants showed decreased transactivation of reporters. Expression of wild type full length and truncated AR in LNCaP cells increased cell proliferation in androgen-depleted conditions and increased colony formation. However, the Y267F mutant of full length and truncated AR was defective in stimulating cell proliferation. The Y363F mutant was less severely affected than the Y267F mutant. The full length AR Y267F mutant was defective in nuclear translocation induced by androgen or Ack1 kinase. The truncated AR was constitutively localized to the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that it was recruited to the target enhancers without androgen. The truncated Y267F AR mutant did not exhibit constitutive nuclear localization and androgen enhancer binding activity. These results support the concept that phosphorylation of Tyr-267, and to a lesser extent Tyr-363, is required for AR nuclear translocation and recruitment and DNA binding and provide a rationale for development of novel approaches to inhibit AR activity.""","""['Mehmet Karaca', 'Yuanbo Liu', 'Zhentao Zhang', 'Dinuka De Silva', 'Joel S Parker', 'H Shelton Earp', 'Young E Whang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Activated Cdc42-associated kinase Ack1 promotes prostate cancer progression via androgen receptor tyrosine phosphorylation.', 'Dasatinib inhibits site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of androgen receptor by Ack1 and Src kinases.', 'The hinge region regulates DNA binding, nuclear translocation, and transactivation of the androgen receptor.', 'Posttranslational modification of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Shepherding AKT and androgen receptor by Ack1 tyrosine kinase.', 'Posttranslational regulation of androgen dependent and independent androgen receptor activities in prostate cancer.', 'Interaction between androgen receptor and coregulator SLIRP is regulated by Ack1 tyrosine kinase and androgen.', 'PRISMOID: a comprehensive 3D structure database for post-translational modifications and mutations with functional impact.', 'Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II regulation of androgen receptor activity.', 'Quokka: a comprehensive tool for rapid and accurate prediction of kinase family-specific phosphorylation sites in the human proteome.']"""

The introduction of dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization in 2003, which by radically enhancing the nuclear spin polarization of (13)C nuclei in solution can increase their sensitivity to detection by more than 10(4)-fold, revolutionized the study of metabolism using magnetic resonance, with temporal and spatial resolutions in the seconds and millimeter ranges, respectively. The principal limitation of the technique is the short half-life of the polarization, which at ∼20-30 s in vivo limits studies to relatively fast metabolic reactions. Nevertheless, pre-clinical studies with a variety of different substrates have demonstrated the potential of the method to provide new insights into tissue metabolism and have paved the way for the first clinical trial of the technique in prostate cancer.

In view of the growing interest in the targeting of IL-17, knowing its cellular sources and clinical implications is crucial. In the present study, we unraveled the phenotype of IL-17 expressing cells in cervical cancer using immunohistochemical double and immunofluorescent triple stainings. In the tumor stroma, IL-17 was found to be predominantly expressed by neutrophils (66%), mast cells (23%), and innate lymphoid cells (8%). Remarkably, T-helper 17 (Th17) cells were a minor IL-17 expressing population (4%). A similar distribution was observed in the tumor epithelium. The Th17 and granulocyte fractions were confirmed in head and neck, ovarian, endometrial, prostate, breast, lung, and colon carcinoma. An above median number of total IL-17 expressing cells was an independent prognostic factor for poor disease-specific survival in early stage disease (p = 0.016). While a high number of neutrophils showed at trend toward poor survival, the lowest quartile of mast cells correlated with poor survival (p = 0.011). IL-17 expressing cells and neutrophils were also correlated with the absence of vaso-invasion (p < 0.01). IL-17 was found to increase cell growth or tightness of cervical cancer cell lines, which may be a mechanism for tumorigenesis in early stage disease. These data suggest that IL-17, primarily expressed by neutrophils, predominantly promotes tumor growth, correlated with poor prognosis in early stage disease. Strikingly, a high number of Th17 cells was an independent prognostic factor for improved survival (p = 0.026), suggesting Th17 cells are part of a tumor suppressing immune response.""","""['Simone Punt', 'Gert Jan Fleuren', 'Eva Kritikou', 'Erik Lubberts', 'J Baptist Trimbos', 'Ekaterina S Jordanova', 'Arko Gorter']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['FoxP3(+) and IL-17(+) cells are correlated with improved prognosis in cervical adenocarcinoma.', 'The correlations between IL-17\xa0vs. Th17 cells and cancer patient survival: a systematic review.', 'A beneficial tumor microenvironment in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by a high T cell and low IL-17(+) cell frequency.', 'Dual role of tumour-infiltrating T helper 17 cells in human colorectal cancer.', 'Human papillomavirus type 18: association with poor prognosis in early stage cervical cancer.', 'T Cells in Colorectal Cancer: Unravelling the Function of Different T Cell Subsets in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'TIME Is Ticking for Cervical Cancer.', 'Increased genital mucosal cytokines in Canadian women associate with higher antigen-presenting cells, inflammatory metabolites, epithelial barrier disruption, and the depletion of L. crispatus.', 'The prognostic and biology of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in the immunotherapy of cancer.', 'Interleukin (IL)-17A in triple-negative breast cancer: a potent prognostic factor associated with intratumoral neutrophil infiltration.']"""

The oncolytic adenovirus (Adv/CD-TK) expressing two suicide genes was tested in two HER2/neu positive BALB/c mouse mammary tumor systems: rat neu-induced TUBO and human HER2-transfected D2F2/E2. Intra-tumoral (i.t.) Adv/CD-TK injection of TUBO tumor plus systemic prodrug therapy showed limited antitumor activity, not exceeding that by the virus itself. Antibody (Ab) to the virus was induced in Adv-/Luc-treated mice, to coincide with the loss of transgene expression. Low replication activity of adenoviruses in rodent cells may limit viral persistence. Host immunity against Adv or Adv-infected cells further mutes suicide gene activity. Treatment of TUBO tumors with Adv/CD-TK alone, however, induced neu-specific Ab responses. Treatment with Adv/CD-TK/GM (Adv/GM) that also expressed mouse granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), but without prodrug treatment, delayed tumor growth, enhanced anti-neu Ab production and conferred complete protection against secondary tumor challenge. D2F2/E2 tumor-bearing mice showed decreased tumor growth following i.t. Adv/GM treatment and they generated greater HER2-specific T-cell responses. These data suggest that i.t. injection of Adv itself induces immune reactivity to tumor-associated antigens and the encoded cytokine, GM-CSF, amplifies that immune response, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. Incorporation of suicide gene therapy did not improve the efficacy of Adv therapy in this mouse mammary tumor system.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of mBCs treated from 2000 to 2013.  Results:   From a total of 97 patients with mBC, 6 (6.2%) with ductal in situ carcinoma were excluded, and 91 patients with invasive carcinoma were analyzed. Median age was 65 years (range: 25-87 years). Estrogen receptors were positive in 88 patients (96.7%), and progesterone receptors were positive in 84 patients (92.3%). HER-2 was overexpressed in 13 of 85 patients (16%). Median follow-up was 51.5 months (range: 0.5-219.3 months). Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 50%, whereas overall survival (OS) was 68.1%. Patients with grades 1 and 2 presented 5-year PFS of 71% versus 22.5% for patients with grade 3 disease; 5-year OS was 85.7% for patients with grades 1 and 2 versus 53.3% of patients with grade 3. Ki-67 score >20% and adjuvant chemotherapy were also statistically significant for OS on univariate analyses. Twenty-six of 87 patients (29.8%) experienced recurrent disease and 16 of 91 patients (17.6%) developed a second neoplasia.  Conclusion:   Male breast cancer shows different biological patterns compared with FBC, with higher positive hormone-receptor status and lower HER-2 overexpression. Grade 3 and Ki-67 >20% were associated with shorter OS.  Implications for practice:   There is little evidence that prognostic features established in female breast cancer, such as grading and Ki-67 labeling index, could be applied to male breast cancer as well. This study found that grade 3 was associated with shorter overall survival and a trend for Ki-67 >20%; this could help in choosing the best treatment option in the adjuvant setting. Many questions remain regarding the impact of HER-2 positivity on survival and treatment with adjuvant anti-HER-2 therapy.

BRCA mutation carriers are at higher risk of developing breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. BRCAPRO was developed for women and found to be superior to other risk assessment models. The present study evaluated the validity of BRCAPRO at predicting the risk of male patients carrying a BRCA mutation.  Patients and methods:   A total of 146 men who presented for genetic counseling and testing from February1997 to September 2011, and their test results were included in the present study. BRCAPRO risk assessment for all patients was calculated using the BRCAPRO clinical CancerGene assessment software.  Results:   The mean age at presentation was 57 years. Of the 146 patients, 48 had breast cancer, 18 had pancreatic cancer, 39 had prostate cancer, 27 had other primary cancers, and 37 had no cancer. Fifty patients (34%) tested positive for a BRCA mutation (22 BRCA1, 27 BRCA2, and 1 BRCA1 and BRCA2). The mean BRCAPRO score for all patients was 24.96%. The BRCAPRO score was significantly higher for patients who tested positive for a BRCA mutation (46.19% vs. 13.9%, p < .01). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.83 for all patients for the BRCAPRO score to predict the risk of carrying a BRCA mutation.

Implications for practice:   Men carrying genetic mutations in the BRCA gene have a greater risk than the general population of developing certain types of cancer, including breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. BRCAPRO is a risk assessment model that predicts the risk of carrying a BRCA mutation. The present study aimed at validating BRCAPRO for use with men seen for genetic counseling, whether affected by cancer or not.

In prostate external beam radiation therapy, it allows the propagation of MR-derived contours to reference CT images at the planning stage, and it enables dose mapping during dosimetry studies. The use of carefully registered CT-MR atlases allows the estimation of patient specific electron density maps from MRI scans, enabling MRI-alone radiation therapy planning and treatment adaptation. In all cases, the precision and accuracy achieved by registration influences the quality of the entire process.  Problem:   Most current registration algorithms do not robustly generalize and lack inverse-consistency, increasing the risk of human error and acting as a source of bias in studies where information is propagated in a particular direction, e.g. CT to MR or vice versa. In MRI-based treatment planning where both CT and MR scans serve as spatial references, inverse-consistency is critical, if under-acknowledged.  Purpose:   A robust, inverse-consistent, rigid/affine registration algorithm that is well suited to CT-MR alignment in prostate radiation therapy is presented.  Method:   The presented method is based on a robust block-matching optimization process that utilises a half-way space definition to maintain inverse-consistency. Inverse-consistency substantially reduces the influence of the order of input images, simplifying analysis, and increasing robustness. An open source implementation is available online at http://aehrc.github.io/Mirorr/.  Results:   Experimental results on a challenging 35 CT-MR pelvis dataset demonstrate that the proposed method is more accurate than other popular registration packages and is at least as accurate as the state of the art, while being more robust and having an order of magnitude higher inverse-consistency than competing approaches.  Conclusion:   The presented results demonstrate that the proposed registration algorithm is readily applicable to prostate radiation therapy planning.""","""['David Rivest-Hénault', 'Nicholas Dowson', 'Peter B Greer', 'Jurgen Fripp', 'Jason A Dowling']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'An atlas-based electron density mapping method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-alone treatment planning and adaptive MRI-based prostate radiation therapy.', 'An adaptive MR-CT registration method for MRI-guided prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'A review of segmentation and deformable registration methods applied to adaptive cervical cancer radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'White matter microstructure and receptive vocabulary in children with cerebral palsy: The role of interhemispheric connectivity.', 'Quality assurance for MRI-only radiation therapy: A voxel-wise population-based methodology for image and dose assessment of synthetic CT generation methods.', 'Synthesis of magnetic resonance images from computed tomography data using convolutional neural network with contextual loss function.', 'Joint synthesis and registration network for deformable MR-CBCT image registration for neurosurgical guidance.', 'Fully Automatic Registration Methods for Chest X-Ray Images.']"""

Further, we show that AR positively regulates CIP2A expression, both at the mRNA and protein level. Finally, CIP2A depletion reduced cell viability and colony forming efficiency of AR-independent PPECs as well as AR-responsive LNCaP cells, in which anchorage-independent growth is also impaired.These findings identify CIP2A as a common denominator for AR-signaling and cancer SC functionality, highlighting its potential therapeutic significance in the most clinically challenging prostate pathology: castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Anchit Khanna', 'Jayant K Rane', 'Kati K Kivinummi', 'Alfonso Urbanucci', 'Merja A Helenius', 'Teemu T Tolonen', 'Outi R Saramäki', 'Leena Latonen', 'Visa Manni', 'John E Pimanda', 'Norman J Maitland', 'Jukka Westermarck', 'Tapio Visakorpi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Leelamine, a Novel Inhibitor of Androgen Receptor and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer: a lesson in persistence.', 'From Basic Science to Clinical Practice: The Role of Cancerous Inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase 2A (CIP2A)/p90 in Cancer.', 'RAS and PP2A activities converge on epigenetic gene regulation.', 'Reciprocal regulation of CIP2A and AR expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Pre-Clinical Study Evaluating Novel Protein Phosphatase 2A Activators as Therapeutics for Neuroblastoma.', 'Global Genetics Research in Prostate Cancer: A Text Mining and Computational Network Theory Approach.']"""

Using patient-matched benign and malignant prostate samples, we show a significant association between low AR levels in cancer associated stroma and increased prostate cancer-related death at one, three and five years post-diganosis, and in tissue recombination models with primary prostate cancer cells that low stromal AR decreases castration-induced apoptosis. AR-regulation was found to be different in primary human fibroblasts isolated from adjacent to cancerous and non-cancerous prostate epithelia, and to represent altered activation of myofibroblast pathways involved in cell cycle, adhesion, migration, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Without AR signaling, the fibroblast-derived ECM loses the capacity to promote attachment of both myofibroblasts and cancer cells, is less able to prevent cell-matrix disruption, and is less likely to impede cancer cell invasion. AR signaling in prostate cancer stroma appears therefore to alter patient outcome by maintaining an ECM microenvironment inhibitory to cancer cell invasion.

Contrastultrasound dispersion imaging (CUDI) has recently shown great potential as a prostate cancer imaging technique. CUDI estimates the local dispersion of intravenously injected contrast agents, imaged by transrectal dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US), to detect angiogenic processes related to tumor growth. The best CUDI results have so far been obtained by similarity analysis of the contrast kinetics in neighboring pixels. To date, CUDI has been investigated in 2-D only. In this paper, an implementation of 3-D CUDI based on spatiotemporal similarity analysis of 4-D DCE-US is described. Different from 2-D methods, 3-D CUDI permits analysis of the entire prostate using a single injection of contrast agent. To perform 3-D CUDI, a new strategy was designed to estimate the similarity in the contrast kinetics at each voxel, and data processing steps were adjusted to the characteristics of 4-D DCE-US images. The technical feasibility of 4-D DCE-US in 3-D CUDI was assessed and confirmed. Additionally, in a preliminary validation in two patients, dispersion maps by 3-D CUDI were quantitatively compared with those by 2-D CUDI and with 12-core systematic biopsies with promising results.""","""['Stefan G Schalk', 'Libertario Demi', 'Martijn Smeenge', 'David M Mills', 'Kirk D Wallace', 'Jean J M C H de la Rosette', 'Hessel Wijkstra', 'Massimo Mischi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control""","""['3-D Quantitative Dynamic Contrast Ultrasound for Prostate Cancer Localization.', 'Spatiotemporal correlation of ultrasound contrast agent dilution curves for angiogenesis localization by dispersion imaging.', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with dispersion analysis for the localization of prostate cancer: correlation with radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'The value of ultrasound (US) in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'The evolving role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in urology: a review.', 'Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Modeling of an Analog to Pseudo-Diffusivity in Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'The challenge of prostate biopsy guidance in the era of mpMRI detected lesion: ultrasound-guided versus in-bore biopsy.', 'On the Relationship between Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Parameters and the Underlying Vascular Architecture Extracted from Acoustic Angiography.', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound tractography for 3D vascular imaging of the prostate.', 'Multiparametric dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging of prostate cancer.']"""

However, most biomarkers considered for further validation turn out not to have strong enough performance to be used in clinical practice. Group sequential designs that allow early termination for futility may be cost-effective for biomarker studies based on biobanks of stored specimens. Previous studies proposed a group sequential design for the validation of a single biomarker. In this article, we adapt a 2-stage design to the setting where a panel of candidate biomarkers are under investigation. Conditional estimators of the clinical performance are proposed under an updated risk model that uses all accrued data, and can be computed through resampling procedures. Under a special case where a multivariate binormal distribution applies for biomarkers following a suitable transformation, these estimators have analytical forms, alleviating the computational burden while retaining statistical efficiency. Performance of the proposed 2-stage design and estimators are compared with a traditional fixed-sample design and an existing 2-stage design that allows early termination but does not update the risk model with accrued information. Our proposed design and estimators show an ability to reduce sample size when the biomarker panel is not promising, while controlling rejection rate and gaining efficiency when the panel is promising.

Methods:   We queried our prospective prostate cancer database for patients treated with 60 to 68 Gy of radiation therapy (RT) to the prostate bed after prostatectomy from 2003 to 2011. Prostatectomy cases were obtained from billing records. Patients with an intact prostate treated with definitive RT served as a control for the change in volume of patients with prostate cancer treated in the department. Chi-square analysis assessed differences between adjuvant and salvage RT cohorts. Spearman correlation assessed yearly trends in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at the time of referral for RT. Linear regression models tested trends for number of PPRT cases, prostatectomies, and patients with intact prostate receiving radiation across years.  Results:   PPRT was used to treat 475 men at Fox Chase Cancer Center from 2003 to 2011 (83 adjuvant and 392 salvage). Over time, an increased proportion of patients receiving RT to the prostate were treated with PPRT. No increase was seen in the proportion of patients treated with adjuvant RT compared with salvage RT (P=.5). Patients receiving adjuvant RT were younger, had higher pathologic Gleason score, pathologic T stage, and rates of positive margins than those receiving salvage RT. Pre-RT PSA values were inversely correlated with year (P=.005). The number of patients referred for salvage RT with a PSA of 0.5 ng/mL or less increased significantly from 7.9% in 2003 to 26.6% in 2011 (P=.002).

Patients and methods:   This was a prospective observational cohort study. Inclusion criteria included patients on hormonal treatment who were recently diagnosed with CRPC. Exclusion criteria included patients previously having radical treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) and patients who have completed the first cycle of chemotherapy. All urine samples were collected and analyzed using the Progensa® assay. Samples were collected before starting chemotherapy and at 12 months. A prospective database was created including routine blood tests, prostate staging and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels throughout the study period. The effects of chemotherapy were also recorded.  Results:   Between January 2010 and February 2013, 12 patients were included in the study out of an initial cohort of 23 patients with CRPC. Mean follow-up was 14.8 months. Mean age at CRPC diagnosis was 73.8 years (±3.6 SD). Mean Gleason score was 8, with PSA 84.23 ng/ml (±158 SD). Mean duration of androgen deprivation treatment (ADT) was 45.16 months (±34.9 SD). Mean time to castrate-resistant state was 46.58 months (±35.3 SD). All twelve (n=12, 100%) patients had non-assessable PCA 3 scores at baseline and at 12 months follow-up. As a direct consequence, statistical analysis was not performed as the anticipated change in PCA 3 scores was not identified and correlation between measurable differences was not possible. All patients tolerated chemotherapy and completed the scheduled cycles with no serious adverse effects.  Conclusion:   To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to demonstrate lack of expression of PCA3 in CRPC, with the result apparently not influenced by chemotherapy. There appears to be a strong association between hormonal treatment and lack of PCA 3 expression. It is still unknown whether disease progression per se affects PCA 3 scores. The gradual reduction and eventual complete non-expression of PCA 3 with ongoing treatment and disease progression provide an insight towards molecular pathways that may be connected to castration-resistant state.""","""['Andreas Bourdoumis', 'Michael Chrisofos', 'Theodora Stasinou', 'Panagiotis Christopoulos', 'Panagiotis Mourmouris', 'Athanasios Kostakopoulos', 'Charalambos Deliveliotis']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Nevertheless, the largest studies that have used hypofractionation so far, employed image-guided radiation therapy/intensity modulated radiation therapy (IGRT/IMRT) facilities that might have overcome the radiobiological advantages, which remain to be fully confirmed. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the feasibility of a hypofractionated schedule delivered with 3D-Conformal Radiotherapy to prostate and seminal vesicles in combination with hormonal therapy.  Patients and methods:   The study included 97 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa), irrespective of risk class, treated with a schedule of 62 Gy in 20 fractions over 5 weeks (4 fractions of 3.1 Gy each per week). According to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) prognostic classification, patients were divided into a favourable group (19%), intermediate group (41%) and unfavourable group (40%). Early and late toxicities were scored using the radiation toxicity grading/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria. Additionally, the international prostate symptom index (IPSS) for benign prostate hypertrophy was used to evaluate obstructive urinary symptoms. Biochemical outcome was reported according to the Phoenix definition for biochemical failure. Hormonal therapy (HT) was administrated in 92% of patients.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 39 months (range=25-52), maximum ≥G2 late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities occurred in 8% and 11% patients, respectively. The corresponding figures for acute toxicities were 24% and 15%. Patients with higher IPSS score before enrolment had significantly worse urinary function after treatment. Only 2% of patients died from PCa. Biochemical non-evidence of disease (bNED) was 83% for all patients.  Conclusion:   Our study confirms that 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) remains a safe and effective method to deliver a dose-escalated hypofractionated regimen for PCa patients in all risk classes with acceptable toxicity rates and optimal biochemical control.""","""['Francesco Tramacere', 'Stefano Arcangeli', 'Antonietta Pignatelli', 'Roberta Castagna', 'Maurizio Portaluri']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Rectal/urinary toxicity after hypofractionated vs conventional radiotherapy in low/intermediate risk localized prostate cancer: systematic review and meta analysis.', 'Hypofractionated radiation therapy (66 Gy in 22 fractions at 3 Gy per fraction) for favorable-risk prostate cancer: long-term outcomes.', 'Impact of image guidance on toxicity and tumour outcome in moderately hypofractionated external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy reduces toxicity with similar biochemical control compared with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A randomized clinical trial.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy as primary treatment for prostate cancer: acute toxicity in 114 patients.', 'Acute and late toxicity patterns of moderate hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Rectal/urinary toxicity after hypofractionated vs conventional radiotherapy in low/intermediate risk localized prostate cancer: systematic review and meta analysis.', 'Hypofractionated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.']"""

We demonstrate in the present report the use of these dual-color cells for early detection of apoptosis in the presence of cancer chemotherapy agents.  Materials and methods:   Induction of apoptosis was observed by real-time imaging of cytoplasmic and nuclear size and shape changes and nuclear fragmentation using fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis was also detected by measuring DNA fragmentation. The cancer chemotherapy agents paclitaxel and vinblastine were used for induction of apoptosis.  Results:   When the PC-3 dual-color cells were treated with paclitaxel or vinblastine, cytoplasmic and nuclear size and shape changes and nuclear fragmentation were observed by 24 hours. The paclitaxel-treated PC-3 dual-color cells exhibited ring-like structures formed by the fragmented nuclei, which could be brightly visualized by H2B-GFP fluorescence. Apoptosis was also detected by the dual-color PC-3 cells by 24 hours when treated with vinblastine. However, no nuclear ring-like structures were formed in the PC-3 cells by vinblastine treatment. In contrast, DNA fragmentation could not be observed in PC-3 cells until 48 hours after exposure to paclitaxel.  Conclusion:   Dual-color PC-3 cells can serve as a simple real-time early reporter of apoptosis and as a screen for novel cancer therapeutics or genotoxic agents.

Age- and education-matched patients with prostate cancer treated with prostatectomy only (n = 84) and men without prostate cancer (n = 88) were assessed at similar intervals. Participants provided baseline blood samples for genotyping. Mean-level cognitive performance was compared using mixed models; cognitive impairment was compared using generalized estimating equations.  Results:   ADT recipients demonstrated higher rates of impaired cognitive performance over time relative to all controls (P = .01). Groups did not differ at baseline (P > .05); however, ADT recipients were more likely to demonstrate impaired performance within 6 and 12 months (P for both comparisons < .05). Baseline age, cognitive reserve, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and hot flash interference did not moderate the impact of ADT on impaired cognitive performance (P for all comparisons ≥ .09).

Clinical assessment may aid in disease stratification, complementing available prognostic tests.  Objective:   To determine the analytical validity and clinicopatholgic associations of microarray-based molecular subtyping.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed Affymetrix GeneChip expression profiles for 1577 patients from eight radical prostatectomy cohorts, including 1351 cases assessed using the Decipher prognostic assay (GenomeDx Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) performed in a laboratory with Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment certification. A microarray-based (m-) random forest ERG classification model was trained and validated. Outlier expression analysis was used to predict other mutually exclusive non-ERG ETS gene rearrangements (ETS(+)) or SPINK1 overexpression (SPINK1(+)).  Outcome measurements:   Associations with clinical features and outcomes by multivariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operating curves.  Results and limitations:   The m-ERG classifier showed 95% accuracy in an independent validation subset (155 samples). Across cohorts, 45% of PCas were classified as m-ERG(+), 9% as m-ETS(+), 8% as m-SPINK1(+), and 38% as triple negative (m-ERG(-)/m-ETS(-)/m-SPINK1(-)). Gene expression profiling supports three underlying molecularly defined groups: m-ERG(+), m-ETS(+), and m-SPINK1(+)/triple negative. On multivariate analysis, m-ERG(+) tumors were associated with lower preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen and Gleason scores, but greater extraprostatic extension (p<0.001). m-ETS(+) tumors were associated with seminal vesicle invasion (p=0.01), while m-SPINK1(+)/triple negative tumors had higher Gleason scores and were more frequent in Black/African American patients (p<0.001). Clinical outcomes were not significantly different among subtypes.  Conclusions:   A clinically available prognostic test (Decipher) can also assess PCa molecular subtypes, obviating the need for additional testing. Clinicopathologic differences were found among subtypes based on global expression patterns.  Patient summary:   Molecular subtyping of prostate cancer can be achieved using extra data generated from a clinical-grade, genome-wide expression-profiling prognostic assay (Decipher).

They are not selective for cancer cells, so prodrugs are required. CBIs can be formed at physiological pH by Winstein cyclisation of 1-chloromethyl-3-substituted-5-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzo[e]indoles (5-OH-seco-CBIs). Corresponding 5-NH2-seco-CBIs should also undergo Winstein cyclisation similarly. A key triply orthogonally protected intermediate on the route to 5-NH2-seco-CBIs has been synthesised, via selective monotrifluoroacetylation of naphthalene-1,3-diamine, Boc protection, electrophilic iodination, selective allylation at the trifluoroacetamide and 5-exo radical ring-closure with TEMPO. This intermediate has potential for introduction of peptide prodrug masking units (deactivating the Winstein cyclisation and cytotoxicity), addition of diverse indole-amide side-chains (enhancing non-covalent binding prior to alkylation) and use of different leaving groups (replacing the usual chlorine, allowing tuning of the rate of Winstein cyclisation). This key intermediate was elaborated into a simple model 5-NH2-seco-CBI with a dimethylaminoethoxyindole side-chain.

PSA is known to have anti-tumorigenic activities, however, the physiological role of PSA in prostate tumor progression is not well understood.  Methods:   Five candidate peptides identified based upon computer modeling of the PSA crystal structure and hydrophobicity were synthesized at >95% purity. The peptides in a linear form, and a constrained form forced by a di-sulfide bond joining the two ends of the peptide, were investigated for anti-angiogenic activity in HUVEC.  Results:   None of the five PSA-mimetic peptides exhibited PSA-like serine protease activity. Two of the peptides demonstrated significant anti-angiogenic activity in HUVEC based on (i) inhibition of cell migration and invasion; (ii) inhibition of tube formation in Matrigel; (iii) anti-angiogenic activity in a sprouting assay; and (iv) altered expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic growth factors. Constrained PSA-mimetic peptides had greater anti-angiogenic activity than the corresponding linearized form. Complexing of PSA with ACT eliminated PSA enzymatic activity and reduced anti-angiogenic activity. In contrast, ACT had no effect on the anti-angiogenic effects of the linear or constrained PSA-mimetic peptides. Modeling of the ACT-PSA complex demonstrated ACT sterically blocks the anti-angiogenic activity of the two bioactive peptides.  Conclusions:   The interaction of a hydrophilic domain on the surface of the PSA molecule with a target on the cell membrane of prostate endothelial and epithelial cells was responsible for the anti-angiogenic or anti-tumorigenic activity of PSA: enzymatic activity was not associated with anti-angiogenic effects.

Methods:   We determined the prevalence of the various G4 architectural patterns and intraductal carcinoma (IDC) in latent prostate cancer in contemporary Russian (n = 220) and Japanese (n = 100) autopsy prostates and in cystoprostatectomy (CP) specimens (n = 248) collected in Italy. We studied the association of each G4 pattern with extraprostatic extension (EPE) and tumor volume to gain insight into their natural history.

Results:   The prevalence of Gleason score ≥ 7 PC was higher in the autopsy series (11%) compared to the CP series (6.5%, P = 0.04). The prevalence of IDC and carcinoma with a cribriform architecture was 2.2% and 3.4% in the autopsy series and 0.8% and 3.6% in the cystoprostatectomy series, respectively. In multivariable analysis, cribriform architecture was significantly associated with increased tumor volume (P < 0.001) and EPE (OR:11.48, 95%CI:2.30-57.16, P = 0.003). IDC was also significantly associated with EPE (OR:10.08, 95%CI:1.58-64.28, P = 0.014).

Study subjects were either participating in or eligible but declined (i.e., nonparticipating) the active intervention study.  Methods:   The intervention-participating subjects were randomized into three groups, including two intervention groups (support and telephone groups) and a usual care reference group. Intervention-nonparticipating subjects were concurrently enrolled. Intervention effectiveness was assessed on the EQ-5D measure. The costs included direct healthcare cost from medical billing data, patient out-of-pocket expense, caregiver expense, patient loss-of-work cost, and intervention cost. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from societal, provider, and patient perspectives.  Results:   Two hundred and sixty-seven intervention-participating and 69 intervention-nonparticipating post-cancer treatment patients were included. The support and telephone groups, but not the usual care group, had significantly higher EQ-5D index scores (0.054, p = 0.033, and 0.057, p = 0.026, respectively) than the intervention-nonparticipating group at month 6. Within 6 months, intervention cost per subject was $252 and $484, respectively, for providers, and $564 and $203, respectively, for the support and phone group subjects. The final ICERs were $16,759 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and $12,561/QALY for support and telephone groups, compared with those of the intervention-nonparticipating group. These ICERs are much smaller than $50,000/QALY, the consensus threshold to determine cost-effectiveness for society.

We mapped pre- and post-treatment tumor locations to determine if residual disease is location-dependent.  Materials and methods:   There were 303 patients treated on a randomized hypofractionation trial. Of these, 125 underwent prostate biopsy 2-years post-RT. Biopsy cores were mapped to a sextant template, and 86 patients with both pre-/post-treatment systematic sextant biopsies were analyzed.  Results:   The pretreatment distribution of positive biopsy cores was not significantly related to prostate region (base, mid, apex; p=0.723). Whereas all regions post-RT had reduced positive biopsies, the base was reduced to the greatest degree and the apex the least (p=0.045). In 38 patients who had a positive post-treatment biopsy, there was change in the rate of apical positivity before and after treatment (76 vs. 71%; p=0.774), while significant reductions were seen in the mid and base.  Conclusion:   In our experience, persistence of prostate tumor cells after RT increases going from the base to apex.

Methods and materials:   From 1996 to 2007, 1989 patients with low-risk (61.3%), intermediate-risk (29.8%), high-intermediate-risk (4.5%), and high-risk prostate cancer (4.4%) were treated with PI and followed up prospectively in a registry. All patients were treated with (125)I monotherapy to 144 Gy. Late toxicity was coded retrospectively according to a modified Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0 scale. The rates of biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) were calculated. We identified factors associated with late grade ≥3 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, bRFS, DMFS, OS, PCSM, and incontinence.  Results:   The median age of the patients was 67 years, and the median overall and prostate-specific antigen follow-up times were 6.8 years and 5.8 years, respectively. The overall 5-year rates for bRFS, DMFS, OS, and PCSM were 91.9%, 97.8%, 93.7%, and 0.71%, respectively. The 10-year rates were 81.5%, 91.5%, 76.1%, and 2.5%, respectively. The overall rates of late grade ≥3 GU and GI toxicity were 7.6% and 0.8%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, age and prostate length were significantly associated with increased risk of late grade ≥3 GU toxicity. The risk of incontinence was highly correlated with both pre-PI and post-PI transurethral resection of the prostate.  Conclusions:   Prostate brachytherapy as monotherapy is an effective treatment for low-risk and low-intermediate-risk prostate cancer and appears promising as a treatment for high-intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer.

Objective:   Herein we describe treatment strategies for three patients with MPS, diagnosed by imaging and clinical findings, who responded to methadone treatment.  Methods:   Patient diagnoses, pain characteristics, and treatment were analyzed retrospectively. Subjects were three patients with MPS who presented to Hyogo Cancer Center with pain. A numeric rating scale (NRS; 0-10) was used to assess patients' pain levels.  Results:   All three patients were diagnosed with malignancies (prostate, cervical, and urachal) and had impaired gait and thigh extension. All had tumor invasion to the iliopsoas muscle, as determined by imaging, and were diagnosed with MPS. After starting methadone, symptoms improved in all patients and they were able to extend the thigh and walk normally. The NRS scores improved by an average of -7.3 points (95% confidence interval [CI] -4.97, -9.69) on Day 14; and the average time until symptom improvement after starting methadone was 2.3 days (95% CI 1.86, 2.80).

Transcripts of several connexin subunits were detected in all four cell lines, and connexin 43 (Cx43) showed marked elevation at both RNA and protein levels in cells with increased metastatic potential. Analysis of gap-junction-mediated intercellular communication revealed homocellular coupling in PC-3 cells, which had the highest C x 43 expression, with minimal coupling in LNCaP cells where C x 43 expression was very low. Treatment with the gap junction inhibitor carbenoxolone or connexin mimetic peptide ACT-1 did not impair cell growth, suggesting that growth is independent of functional gap junctions.

Material and methods:   We relied on patients with low-risk prostate cancer, who were classified based on the D׳Amico classification, treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) between 2008 and 2013 at the Martini-Clinic Prostate Cancer Center. We assessed differences in clinical, pathological, and surgical characteristics in D׳Amico low-risk patients according to AS eligibility (prostate-specific antigen [PSA]≤ 10 ng/ml, Gleason score ≤ 3 + 3, ≤ 2 positive cores,≤5 0% tumor content per core, and ≤ cT1-2a). Multivariable logistic regression analyses targeted 2 end points: (1) presence of either intermediate- or high-risk characteristics (Gleason score ≥ 3+4 or ≥ pT3 or pN1) or (2) exclusive presence of high-risk characteristics (Gleason score ≥ 4+4 or ≥ pT3 or pN1) at RP.  Results:   Of 1,331 patients low-risk prostate cancer classified based on the D׳Amico classification, 825 (62%) men were eligible for AS. AS candidates were less frequently either upgraded (55% vs. 78%, P<0.001) or upstaged (8% vs. 15%, P<0.001). Similarly, at final pathology, AS candidates less frequently harbored either intermediate- or high-risk (56% vs. 78%, P<0.001), or exclusive high-risk characteristics (9% vs. 16%, P<0.001). Tumor involvement per core (>50%) (most powerful), number of positive cores, PSA values, and age were independent predictors for either intermediate- or high-risk characteristics at RP. Tumor involvement per core and PSA values were independent predictors for exclusive high-risk characteristics at RP.  Conclusions:   D׳Amico low-risk patients did not have a homogeneous histology at RP. Especially, non-AS candidates were at a higher risk of either upgrading or upstaging at final pathology. Tumor involvement greater than 50% per core was the most powerful indicator of adverse pathology. Therefore, D'Amico low-risk criteria are not safe enough to identify AS candidates.""","""['Jonas Schiffmann', 'Philipp Wenzel', 'Georg Salomon', 'Lars Budäus', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Sarah Minner', 'Corinna Wittmer', 'Stefan Kraft', 'Till Krech', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Guido Sauter', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Katharina Boehm', 'Derya Tilki', 'Uwe Michl', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Reply by Authors.', 'Effects of pathological upstaging or upgrading on metastasis and cancer-specific mortality in men with clinical low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Pathologic Outcomes of Gleason 6 Favorable Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated With Radical Prostatectomy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', ""Primary Gleason pattern upgrading in contemporary patients with D'Amico low-risk prostate cancer: implications for future biomarkers and imaging modalities."", 'Active surveillance in prostate cancer.', 'Old men with prostate cancer have higher risk of Gleason score upgrading and pathological upstaging after initial diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Combining Molecular Subtypes with Multivariable Clinical Models Has the Potential to Improve Prediction of Treatment Outcomes in Prostate Cancer at Diagnosis.', 'Prognostic Impact and Clinical Implications of Unfavorable Upgrading in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Results of a Single Tertiary Referral Center.', 'Risk and predictors of adverse pathology after radical prostatectomy in patients diagnosed with IUSP 1-2 prostate cancer at MRI-targeted biopsy: a multicenter analysis.', 'The Challenges of Patient Selection for Prostate Cancer Focal Therapy: A Retrospective Observational Multicentre Study.', 'SATB1, genomic instability and Gleason grading constitute a novel risk score for prostate cancer.']"""

This study describes men's PSA screening preferences before and after viewing a decision aid and relates these preferences to subsequent clinician visit content.  Methods:   Men were recruited from two health systems in 2009-2013. Participants answered a questionnaire before and after decision aid viewing addressing PSA screening preferences and five basic knowledge questions. At one health system, participants also answered a survey after a subsequent clinician visit. Data were analyzed in 2014.  Results:   One thousand forty-one predominantly white, well-educated men responded to the pre- and post-viewing questionnaire (25% and 29% response rates at the two sites). After viewing, the proportion of patients leaning away from PSA screening increased significantly (p<0.001), with 386 (38%) leaning toward PSA screening versus 436 (43%) before viewing; 174 (17%) unsure versus 319 (32%) before; and 448 (44%) leaning away versus 253 (25%) before. Higher knowledge scores were associated with being more likely to lean against screening and less likely to be unsure (p<0.001). Among 278 men who also completed a questionnaire after a subsequent clinician visit, participants who planned to discuss PSA screening with their clinicians were significantly more likely to report such discussions than participants who did not (148/217 [68%] vs 16/46 [35%], respectively [p<0.001]).  Conclusions:   A decision aid reduces men's interest in PSA screening, particularly among the initially unsure.

Baliospermum montanum is a plant that is used in ayurveda for the treatment of cancer and the plant is studied to possess various constituents in it that are responsible for its anticancer activity. Stable nanoparticles of B. montanum were prepared from both the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the plant and its cytotoxic effects were studied on prostate cancer and normal cell lines. Size analysis by DLS and SEM revealed the average size of nanoparticles prepared was 100±50 nm and 150±50 nm for the nanoparticles prepared from aqueous and ethanolic extract respectively. In vitro cytotoxicity showed a concentration and time dependent toxicity on prostate cancer cells with cell viability of 22% and 6% with maximum concentration of aqueous and ethanolic nanoparticles respectively, in 48 h. In vitro hemolysis assay confirmed that the prepared nanoparticles were compatible with blood with no occurrence of hemolysis. The nanoparticles showed a significant reduction in the colony forming ability and wound healing capacity of the prostate cancer cells.

The men were aged ≤70 years at diagnosis. A control group of 1 000 men without prostate cancer were also selected, matched for age and county of residence. Functional outcomes were evaluated with a validated self-reported questionnaire.  Results:   Responses were obtained from 3 937/6 003 cases (66%) and 459/1 000 (46%) controls. At 12 years after diagnosis and at a median age of 75 years, the proportion of cases with adverse symptoms was 87% for erectile dysfunction/sexual inactivity, 20% for urinary incontinence and 14% for bowel disturbances. The corresponding proportions for controls were 62, 6 and 7%, respectively. Men with prostate cancer, except those on surveillance, had an increased risk of erectile dysfunction compared with the men in the control group. Radical prostatectomy was associated with an increased risk of urinary incontinence (odds ratio [OR] 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-2.62) and radiotherapy increased the risk of bowel dysfunction (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.73-3.49) compared with men in the control group. Multi-modal treatment, in particular treatment including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), was associated with the highest risk of adverse effects; for instance, radical prostatectomy followed by radiotherapy and ADT was associated with an OR of 3.74 (95% CI 1.76-7.95) for erectile dysfunction and an OR of 3.22 (95% CI 1.93-5.37) for urinary incontinence.

The questionnaire included indications for active surveillance, percentage of active surveillance for localized prostate cancer, problems with active surveillance, which protocol was used, timing of first repeat biopsy, use of prostate-specific antigen or doubling time and use of magnetic resonance imaging.  Results:   A total of 2133 Japanese urologists in the 632 training institutes answered the questionnaire. The median age was 42 years (26-84 years). Of the responders, 26.9% had no use of active surveillance for localized prostate cancer.

Objective:   To describe recurrence patterns, to identify predictors of progression, and to test the impact of the site of clinical recurrence (CR) on cancer-specific mortality (CSM).  Design, setting, and participants:   We included 1003 patients with node-positive PCa treated with RP and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Patients who experienced biochemical recurrence (BCR; n=370) and CR (n=183) were identified. CR was defined as positive imaging after BCR. Patients were stratified according to the first site of CR: local and/or nodal (recurrence in the prostatic bed and/or pelvic nodes), retroperitoneal, bony, or visceral.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable competing-risks regression analyses identified predictors of systemic recurrence (ie, retroperitoneal, bony, and/or visceral) and tested the association between the site of recurrence and CSM after accounting for the risk of other-cause mortality.  Results and limitations:   When considering patients experiencing BCR, pathologic Gleason score, time to BCR, and the administration of a positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan represented predictors of systemic recurrence (all p ≤ 0.002). Among patients who experienced CR, recurrence was local and/or nodal in 56 (30.5%), retroperitoneal in 25 (13.7%), skeletal in 77 (42.1%), and visceral in 25 (13.7%). Among patients experiencing local recurrence, 27 (48.2%) had positive margins, 29 (51.8%) had adjuvant radiotherapy, and 22 (39.5%) had salvage radiotherapy. Patients experiencing local and/or nodal recurrence had higher 5-yr CSM-free survival rates compared with those with retroperitoneal, skeletal, and visceral recurrence (79.3%, 76.3%, 50.8%, and 35.3%, respectively; p<0.001). The site of recurrence represented an independent predictor of CSM (p ≤ 0.04).  Conclusions:   In approximately one-third of patients who are pN+ and experience CR, the prostatic bed and pelvic lymph nodes represent the first sites of recurrence. These patients have a more favorable prognosis compared with those with skeletal and visceral metastases. These data have important implications for the selection of the optimal postoperative management of pN+ patients who experience CR. Although patients with local and/or pelvic nodal recurrence might benefit from nonsystemic salvage therapies, men with visceral and skeletal recurrence might represent ideal candidates for systemic approaches.  Patient summary:   Not all patients with pN+ prostate cancer who experience clinical recurrence harbor distant metastatic disease. Local and/or nodal recurrence occurs in one-third of these cases. These patients share a more favorable prognosis than their counterparts with systemic recurrence. These results are important for tailoring the optimal postoperative management for each node-positive patient with recurrent disease after surgery.""","""['Alessandro Nini', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Vito Cucchiara', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Walter Cazzaniga', 'Stefano Luzzago', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Pathologic Lymph Node-positive Prostate Cancer: Some Answers … with Many More Questions.', 'Long-term outcomes of salvage lymph node dissection for clinically recurrent prostate cancer: results of a single-institution series with a minimum follow-up of 5 years.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Pelvic/retroperitoneal salvage lymph node dissection for patients treated with radical prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence and nodal recurrence detected by 11Ccholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography.', 'Prognostic Value of Biochemical Recurrence Following Treatment with Curative Intent for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Narrative review of management strategies and outcomes in node-positive prostate cancer.', 'Bone scan positivity in non-metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer: external validation study.', 'Polo-like kinase 3 is associated with poor prognosis and regulates proliferation and metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Oncological outcome of patients treated with spot-specific salvage lymphnode dissection (sLND) for positron-emission tomography (PET)-positive prostate cancer (PCa) relapse.', 'Histological Validation of 11Carbon-Acetate Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography in Detecting Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Recent studies have shown that Dab2ip also plays an important role in regulating dendrite development and neuronal migration during brain development. In this study, we provide a more complete description of the mouse Dab2ip (mDab2ip) gene locus and examined DNA methylation and expression of Dab2ip during cerebellar development. Analysis of cDNA sequences in public databases revealed a total of 20 possible exons for mDab2ip gene, spanning over 172kb. Using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) data available through FANTOM5 project, we deduced five different transcription start sites for mDab2ip. Here, we characterized three different mDab2ip transcript variants beginning with exon 1. These transcripts varied by the presence or absence of exons 3 and 5, which encode a putative nuclear localization signal and the N-terminal region of a PH-domain, respectively. The 5' region of the mDab2ip gene contains three putative CpG islands (CpG131, CpG54, and CpG85). Interestingly, CpG54 and CpG85 are localized on exons 3 and 5.

We also looked at cancer risk according to duration of service in Lebanon, in the occupational groups of cooks and mechanics, and the risk of alcohol- and smoking-related cancers among those who served during high- or low-conflict periods.  Methods:   The cohort was followed for cancer incidence and all-cause mortality from 1978 through 2012. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) for cancer and mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated from national rates for the total cohort. SIRs were calculated according to duration of service; among cooks and mechanics; and according to high- and low-conflict exposure. Poisson regression, expressed as rate ratio (RR), was used to see the effect of duration of service, and of conflict exposure.  Results:   A decreased risk was found for cancer incidence overall (1050 cases, SIR=0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.95) and for cancers of the prostate (SIR=0.78) and skin (other than melanoma) (SIR=0.58). The incidence of rectal cancer was 73% higher in those who served for 1 year or more than in those with shorter-term service (RR=1.73, 95% CI 1.00-3.02). The cancer risk in cooks and mechanics was within expected values. The risk of lung cancer was higher in the high-conflict exposure group than in the low-conflict exposure group (RR=1.79; 95% CI 1.00-3.18). In the total cohort, all-cause mortality was lower than expected (SMR=0.83; 95% CI 0.78-0.88).  Conclusion:   We found a ""healthy soldier effect"" for overall cancer incidence and all-cause mortality.

The purpose of this work is to investigate how plans that are generated with the objective KBRT approach compare to those that rely on the judgment of the experienced planner.  Methods:   Thirty volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were randomly selected from a database of prostate plans that were generated by experienced planners (expert plans). The anatomical data (CT scan and delineation of organs) of these patients and the KBRT algorithm were given to a novice with no prior treatment planning experience. The inexperienced planner used the knowledge-based algorithm to predict the dose that the OARs receive based on their proximity to the treated volume. The population-based OAR constraints were changed to the predicted doses. A KBRT plan was subsequently generated. The KBRT and expert plans were compared for the achieved target coverage and OAR sparing. The target coverages were compared using the Uniformity Index (UI), while 5 dose-volume points (D10, D30, D50, D70 and D90) were used to compare the OARs (bladder and rectum) doses. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to check for significant differences (p<0.05) between both datasets.  Results:   The KBRT and expert plans achieved mean UI values of 1.10 ± 0.03 and 1.10 ± 0.04, respectively. The Wilcoxon test showed no statistically significant difference between both results. The D90, D70, D50, D30 and D10 values of the two planning strategies, and the Wilcoxon test results suggests that the KBRT plans achieved a statistically significant lower bladder dose (at D30), while the expert plans achieved a statistically significant lower rectal dose (at D10 and D30).

Materials and methods:   Totally 75 patients underwent transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy for prior negative MRI-guided (cognitive registration) biopsy during April 2013 to August 2014. Primary objective was to report clinically significant cancer detection in this cohort of patients. Significant cancer was defined using varying thresholds of MCL or Gleason grade 3+4 or greater or both. Cancers with more than 80% of positive core length anterior to the level of urethra were termed anterior zone cancer. Secondary objective was to evaluate the potential clinical and radiological predictors for significant cancer detection.  Results:   The mean age was 61.6 ± 6.5 years and median prostate-specific antigen was 10.4 ng/dl (7.9-18) with a mean MRI target size of 7.2mm (4-11). Transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy identified cancer in 36% (27/75) patients and 66.6% (18/27) of them were anterior zone cancers. The rates of detection of clinically significant and insignificant cancer according to the several definitions used range from 22.7% to 30.7% and 5.3% to 13.3%, respectively.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential effects of baicalein on androgen-independent PCa cells and the underlying mechanisms through which baicalein exerts its actions. Cell viability and flow cytometric apoptosis assays indicated that baicalein potently suppressed the growth and induced the apoptosis of DU145 and PC-3 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Consistently, the inhibitory effects of baicalein on migration and invasion were also observed in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that baicalein can suppress caveolin-1 and the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the inhibition of the activation of AKT with LY294002 significantly promoted the apoptosis and metastasis induced by baicalein.

The induction of an irreversible cell cycle arrest is very useful for treatment of cancer. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are considered as therapeutic targets to treat cancer patients. HDAC inhibitors repress cancer growth and are used in various clinical trials. Here, we analyzed whether sodium butyrate (NaBu), an inhibitor of class I and II HDACs, induces cellular senescence in neuroblastoma and prostate cancer (PCa) including an androgen-dependent as well as an androgen-independent human PCa cell line. We found that the HDAC inhibitors NaBu and valproic acid (VPA) induce cellular senescence in tumor cells. Interestingly, also an inhibitor of SIRT1, a class HDAC III, induces cellular senescence. Both neuroblastoma and human prostate cancer cell lines express senescence markers, such as the Senescence Associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) and Senescence Associated Heterochromatin Foci (SAHF). Furthermore, NaBu down-regulates the proto-oncogenes c-Myc, Cyclin D1 and E2F1 mRNA levels. The mRNA level of the cell cycle inhibitor p16 remains unchanged whereas that of the tumor suppressor p21 is strongly up-regulated. Interestingly, NaBu treatment robustly increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. These results indicate an epigenetic regulation and an association of HDAC inhibition and ROS production with cellular senescence. The data underline that tumor cells can be driven towards cellular senescence by HDAC inhibitors, which may further arise as a potent possibility for tumor suppression.""","""['Viola Lorenz', 'Wiebke Hessenkemper', 'Julia Rödiger', 'Sergiy Kyrylenko', 'Florian Kraft', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig""","""['p21Waf1/Cip1 is a common target induced by short-chain fatty acid HDAC inhibitors (valproic acid, tributyrin and sodium butyrate) in neuroblastoma cells.', 'Inhibition of HDAC increases the senescence induced by natural polyphenols in glioma cells.', 'Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells.', 'Sodium butyrate regulates androgen receptor expression and cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Is Senescence-Associated β-Galactosidase a Reliable in vivo Marker of Cellular Senescence During Embryonic Development?', 'Drug mechanism enrichment analysis improves prioritization of therapeutics for repurposing.', 'HDAC2 and 7 down-regulation induces senescence in dermal fibroblasts.', 'Histone Deacetylases and Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors in Neuroblastoma.', 'Sodium Butyrate Abrogates the Growth and Pathogenesis of Mycobacterium bovis via Regulation of Cathelicidin (LL37) Expression and NF-κB Signaling.', 'From molecular promise to preclinical results: HDAC inhibitors in the race for healthy aging drugs.']"""

The inhibition of AR by Alien seems to be restricted to cases where AR is bound to AR antagonists. In line with this, Alien inhibits AR target gene expression and human prostate cancer cell proliferation in an antagonist-specific manner indicating that Alien has an inhibitory role for cell cycle progression. Alien mediates gene silencing by recruitment of histone deacetylase activity and interestingly through nucleo-some assembly activity. Hereby, Alien enhances nucleosome positioning mediated by nucleosome assembly protein 1, which suggests a novel molecular mechanism of corepressor function.

To date, three types of 5α-reductases, chronologically named types 1, 2 and 3 5α-reductases (SRD5a-1, 2 and 3) have been described. In the present paper, we characterized the activity and compared the mRNA expression levels of SRD5a-3 with those of SRD5a-1 and 2 in various human tissues, and determined its sensitivity to finasteride and dutasteride. We have established HEK-293 cell line that stably expressed SRD5a-3 for studying its activity and the inhibitory effect of finasteride, using [14C]labeled steroids. mRNA expression levels were quantified using real-time PCR in many male and female human tissues including the prostate, adipose tissue, mammary gland, as well as breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Incubation of HEK-SRD5a-3 cells with [14C]4-androstenedione and [14C]testosterone allowed us to show that SRD5a-3 can catalyze very efficiently both substrates 4-androstenedione and testosterone into 5α-androstanedione and dihydrotestosterone, respectively. We observed that the affinity of the enzyme for 4-androstenedione is higher than for testosterone. The activity of SRD5a-3 and SRD5a-2 are similarly sensitive to finasteride, whereas dutasteride is a much more potent inhibitor of SRD5a-3 than SRD5a-2. Tissue distribution analysis shows that SRD5a-3 mRNA expression levels are higher than those of SRD5a-1 and SRD5a-2 in 20 analyzed tissues. In particular, it is highly expressed in the skin, brain, mammary gland and breast cancer cell lines, thus suggesting that SRD5a-3 could play an important role in the production of androgens in these and other peripheral tissues.""","""['Kazutoshi Yamana', 'Fernand Labrie', 'Van Luu-The']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig""","""['Sequential transformation of 4-androstenedione into dihydrotestosterone in prostate carcinoma (DU-145) cells indicates that 4-androstenedione and not testosterone is the substrate of 5α-reductase.', 'Characterization of 5α-reductase activity and isoenzymes in human abdominal adipose tissues.', 'New steroidal 17β-carboxy derivatives present anti-5α-reductase activity and anti-proliferative effects in a human androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line.', ""Health Risks Associated with Long-Term Finasteride and Dutasteride Use: It's Time to Sound the Alarm."", 'An overview on 5alpha-reductase inhibitors.', 'Altered Skin Permeation of Finasteride Using Clove Oil, Urea, and Lyophilized Powder of Grape Seed Extract.', 'Short course of dutasteride in treatment of a refractory category IIIB chronic prostatitis (A placebo-controlled study).', 'Guava (Psidium guajava L.)

A significant difference was observed in the percentage of NSCLC patients with PMSA (+) NECs and stage I or II cancer (92.98%) and those patients with stage III or IV cancer (76.77%). In the SCLC tissues, NEC PSMA expression (70.00%) did not differ significantly from NSCLC. SCLC tumor cells and normal lung tissues cells were all negative. There was no significant correlation between the presence of PSMA (+) NECs in SCLC patients and the observed clinicopathological parameters.  Conclusions:   PSMA is expressed not only in NECs of NSCLC and SCLC but also in tumor cells of most NSCLC patients. The presence of PSMA (+) tumor cells and PSMA (+) NECs in NSCLC was negatively correlated with age and the clinicopathological stage of the patients, respectively.""","""['Hai-long Wang', 'Shao-shan Wang', 'Wen-hui Song', 'Yi Pan', 'Hai-peng Yu', 'Tong-guo Si', 'Yong Liu', 'Xiao-nan Cui', 'Zhi Guo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Five different anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibodies confirm PSMA expression in tumor-associated neovasculature.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in tumor-associated vasculature of breast cancers.', 'PSMA expression on neovasculature of solid tumors.', 'Tumor target prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and its regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical and pilot clinical evaluation of a small-molecule carbonic anhydrase IX targeting PET tracer in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Heterogeneous uptake of 18F-FDG and 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in lung cancer and lymph node metastasis.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 theranostic probe for hepatocellular carcinoma imaging and therapy.', 'The clinical application of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and regulating mechanism of PSMA expression in patients with brain metastases of lung cancer.', 'PSMA Expression in Solid Tumors beyond the Prostate Gland: Ready for Theranostic Applications?']"""

However, the effect of SRW on voiding functions in adult males with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) has not been evaluated. To determine the effect of SRW on urination in male patients with LUTS, multiple voiding parameters of uroflowmetry with postvoid residual urine (PVR) were assessed according to the presence of SRW played by a mobile application.  Methods:   Eighteen consecutive male patients with LUTS were prospectively enrolled between March and April 2014. Uroflowmetry with PVR measured by a bladder scan was randomly performed once weekly for two consecutive weeks with and without SRW in a completely sealed room after pre-checked bladder volume was scanned to be more than 150 cc. SRW was played with river water sounds amongst relaxed melodies from a smartphone mobile application.  Results:   The mean age of enrolled patients and their mean International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) were 58.9 ± 7.7 years (range: 46-70) and 13.1 ± 5.9, respectively. All patients had not been prescribed any medications, including alpha-blockers or anti-muscarinic agents, in the last 3 months. There was a significant increase in mean peak flow rate (PFR) with SRW in comparison to without SRW (15.7 mL/s vs. 12.3 mL/s, respectively, p = 0.0125). However, there were no differences in other uroflowmetric parameters, including PVR.  Conclusions:   The study showed that SRW from a mobile phone application may be helpful in facilitating voiding functions by increasing PFR in male LUTS patients.""","""['Whi-An Kwon', 'Sung Han Kim', 'Sohee Kim', 'Jae Young Joung', 'Jinsoo Chung', 'Kang Hyun Lee', 'Sang-Jin Lee', 'Ho Kyung Seo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Evaluation of the clinical value of a simple flowmeter in the management of male lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'The relationship between the sensation of incomplete voiding and a high postvoid residual volume.', 'Effect of voiding position on uroflowmetric parameters and post-void residual urine volume in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Invasive urodynamic studies for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with voiding dysfunction.', 'EAU Guidelines on the Assessment of Non-neurogenic Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms including Benign Prostatic Obstruction.', 'Influence of visual and auditory cues about bladder volume on real-time filling sensation in healthy volunteers.', 'Perceptions of Older Men Using a Mobile Health App to Monitor Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Tamsulosin Side Effects: Mixed Methods Study.', 'Classification of Bladder Emptying Patterns by LSTM Neural Network Trained Using Acoustic Signatures.']"""

Unfortunately, little is known about the identity of these cells, making it difficult to target the metastatic prostate tumor. Here, for the first time, we report the identification of a rare population of prostate cancer cells that express the Tie-2 protein. We found that this Tie-2High population exists mainly in prostate cancer cell lines that are capable of metastasizing to the bone. These cells not only express a higher level of CSC markers but also demonstrate enhanced resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug Cabazitaxel. In addition, knockdown of the expression of the Tie-2 ligand angiopoietin (Ang-1) led to suppression of CSC markers, suggesting that the Ang-1/Tie-2 signaling pathway functions as an autocrine loop for the maintenance of prostate CSCs. More importantly, we found that Tie-2High prostate cancer cells are more adhesive than the Tie-2Low population to both osteoblasts and endothelial cells. Moreover, only the Tie-2High, but not the Tie-2Low cells developed tumor metastasis in vivo when injected at a low number. Taken together, our data suggest that Tie-2 may play an important role during the development of prostate tumor metastasis.""","""['Kai-Dun Tang', 'Boris M Holzapfel', 'Ji Liu', 'Terence Kin-Wah Lee', 'Stephanie Ma', 'Lidija Jovanovic', 'Jiyuan An', 'Pamela J Russell', 'Judith A Clements', 'Dietmar W Hutmacher', 'Ming-Tat Ling']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The molecular signature of the stroma response in prostate cancer-induced osteoblastic bone metastasis highlights expansion of hematopoietic and prostate epithelial stem cell niches.', 'A CD90(+) tumor-initiating cell population with an aggressive signature and metastatic capacity in esophageal cancer.', 'SOX2 expression associates with stem cell state in human ovarian carcinoma.', 'Function of Integrin-Linked Kinase in Modulating the Stemness of IL-6-Abundant Breast Cancer Cells by Regulating γ-Secretase-Mediated Notch1 Activation in Caveolae.', 'Animal models for prostate cancer.', 'NPM1 promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastasis and stemness by recruiting Mdm2 to induce the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of p53.', 'Harnessing cancer stem cell-derived exosomes to improve cancer therapy.', 'A Comprehensive Characterization of Stemness in Cell Lines and Primary Cells of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Formation of pre-metastatic bone niche in prostate cancer and regulation of traditional chinese medicine.', 'Ultrasensitive Detection of GRP78 in Exosomes and Observation of Migration and Proliferation of Cancer Cells by Application of GRP78-Containing Exosomes.']"""

Increased knowledge of the biological mechanisms underlying PCa onset and progression are critical for improved clinical management. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) deregulation is common in human cancers, and understanding how it impacts in PCa is of major importance. MiRNAs are mostly downregulated in cancer, although some are overexpressed, playing a critical role in tumor initiation and progression. We aimed to identify miRNAs overexpressed in PCa and subsequently determine its impact in tumorigenesis.  Results:   MicroRNA expression profiling in primary PCa and morphological normal prostate (MNPT) tissues identified 17 miRNAs significantly overexpressed in PCa. Expression of three miRNAs, not previously associated with PCa, was subsequently assessed in large independent sets of primary tumors, in which miR-182 and miR-375 were validated, but not miR-32. Significantly higher expression levels of miR-375 were depicted in patients with higher Gleason score and more advanced pathological stage, as well as with regional lymph nodes metastases. Forced expression of miR-375 in PC-3 cells, which display the lowest miR-375 levels among PCa cell lines, increased apoptosis and reduced invasion ability and cell viability. Intriguingly, in 22Rv1 cells, which displayed the highest miR-375 expression, knockdown experiments also attenuated the malignant phenotype. Gene ontology analysis implicated miR-375 in several key pathways deregulated in PCa, including cell cycle and cell differentiation. Moreover, CCND2 was identified as putative miR-375 target in PCa, confirmed by luciferase assay.  Conclusions:   A dual role for miR-375 in prostate cancer progression is suggested, highlighting the importance of cellular context on microRNA targeting.""","""['Pedro Costa-Pinheiro', 'João Ramalho-Carvalho#', 'Filipa Quintela Vieira#', 'Jorge Torres-Ferreira', 'Jorge Oliveira', 'Céline S Gonçalves', 'Bruno M Costa', 'Rui Henrique', 'Carmen Jerónimo#']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['MicroRNA alteration and putative target genes in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer: STAT3 and ZEB1 are upregulated during prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Altered miRNA expression in high-fat diet-induced prostate cancer progression.', 'Tumor suppressive microRNAs (miR-222 and miR-31) regulate molecular pathways based on microRNA expression signature in prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs as Epigenetic Determinants of Treatment Response and Potential Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Influence of miRNAs on Radiotherapy Treatment in Prostate Cancer - A Systematic Review.', 'Differential Expression of miRNAs Contributes to Tumor Aggressiveness and Racial Disparity in African American Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'MiR-375 and miR-21 as Potential Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Matching Samples of Plasma and Exosomes.', 'The clinicopathological and microrna expression signature associated with lymphovascular invasion in squamous cell carcinoma: A basic descriptive study.', 'Cancer-derived exosomal miR-375 targets DIP2C and promotes osteoblastic metastasis and prostate cancer progression by regulating the Wnt signaling pathway.', 'Expression Profiles and Interaction of MicroRNA and Transcripts in Response to Bovine Leukemia Virus Exposure.']"""

Nanobodies (single-domain antibodies, VHH) are the smallest antibody-based fragments possessing ideal molecular imaging properties, such as high target specificity and rapid background clearance. We developed a novel anti-PSMA Nanobody (JVZ-007) for targeted imaging and therapy of PCa. Here, we report on the application of the (111)In-radiolabeled Nanobody for SPECT/CT imaging of PCa.  Methods:   A Nanobody library was generated by immunization of a llama with 4 human PCa cell lines. Anti-PSMA Nanobodies were captured by biopanning on PSMA-overexpressing cells. JVZ-007 was selected for evaluation as an imaging probe. JVZ-007 was initially produced with a c-myc-hexahistidine (his) tag allowing purification and detection. The c-myc-his tag was subsequently replaced by a single cysteine at the C terminus, allowing site-specific conjugation of chelates for radiolabeling. JVZ-007-c-myc-his was conjugated to 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (p-SCN-DTPA) via the lysines, whereas JVZ-007-cys was conjugated to maleimide-DTPA via the C-terminal cysteine. PSMA targeting was analyzed in vitro by cell-binding experiments using flow cytometry, autoradiography, and internalization assays with various PCa cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). The targeting properties of radiolabeled Nanobodies were evaluated in vivo in biodistribution and SPECT/CT imaging experiments, using nude mice bearing PSMA-positive PC-310 and PSMA-negative PC-3 tumors.  Results:   JVZ-007 was successfully conjugated to DTPA for radiolabeling with (111)In at room temperature. (111)In-JVZ007-c-myc-his and (111)In-JVZ007-cys internalized in LNCaP cells and bound to PSMA-expressing PDXs and, importantly, not to PSMA-negative PDXs and human kidneys. Good tumor targeting and fast blood clearance were observed for (111)In-JVZ-007-c-myc-his and (111)In-JVZ-007-cys. Renal uptake of (111)In-JVZ-007-c-myc-his was initially high but was efficiently reduced by coinjection of gelofusine and lysine. The replacement of the c-myc-his tag by the cysteine contributed to a further reduction of renal uptake without loss of targeting. PC-310 tumors were clearly visualized by SPECT/CT with both tracers, with low renal uptake (<4 percentage injected dose per gram) for (111)In-JVZ-007-cys already at 3 h after injection.  Conclusion:   We developed an (111)In-radiolabeled anti-PSMA Nanobody, showing good tumor targeting, low uptake in nontarget tissues, and low renal retention, allowing excellent SPECT/CT imaging of PCa within a few hours after injection.""","""['Kristell L S Chatalic', 'Joke Veldhoven-Zweistra', 'Michiel Bolkestein', 'Sander Hoeben', 'Gerben A Koning', 'Otto C Boerman', 'Marion de Jong', 'Wytske M van Weerden']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Generation and characterization of nanobodies targeting PSMA for molecular imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Dual-Modality Image-Guided Surgery of Prostate Cancer with a Radiolabeled Fluorescent Anti-PSMA Monoclonal Antibody.', 'Extensive preclinical evaluation of lutetium-177-labeled PSMA-specific tracers for prostate cancer radionuclide therapy.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen for prostate cancer theranostics: from imaging to targeted therapy.', 'New aspects of molecular imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT) with Single-Domain Antibodies (Nanobodies).', 'Site-Specifically Conjugated Single-Domain Antibody Successfully Identifies Glypican-3-Expressing Liver Cancer by Immuno-PET.', 'Application Progress of the Single Domain Antibody in Medicine.', 'Nanobodies: a new potential for prostate cancer treatment.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.']"""

The natural history and detection component of the original model was based on the 2003 version of the Erasmus MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis (MISCAN) model, which was not calibrated to prevalence data. Compared with data from autopsy studies, prevalence of latent PCa assumed by the original model is low, which may bias the model toward screening. Our objective was to recalibrate the original model to match prevalence data from autopsy studies as well and compare benefit-harm predictions of the 2 model versions differing in prevalence.  Methods:   For recalibration, we reprogrammed the natural history and detection component of the PCOP model as a deterministic Markov state-transition cohort model in the statistical software package R. All parameters were implemented as variables or time-dependent functions and calibrated simultaneously in a single run. Observed data used as calibration targets included data from autopsy studies, cancer registries, and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. Compared models were identical except for calibrated parameters.  Results:   We calibrated 46 parameters. Prevalence from autopsy studies could not be fitted using the original parameter set. Additional parameters, allowing for interruption of disease progression and age-dependent screening sensitivities, were needed. Recalibration to higher prevalence demonstrated a considerable increase of overdiagnosis and decline of screening sensitivity, which significantly worsened the benefit-harm balance of screening.  Conclusions:   Our calibration suggests that not all cancers are at risk of progression, and screening sensitivity may be lower at older ages.

Pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D concentrations and cancer incidence were available in total for 15,486 older adults (mean age 63, range 50-84 years) participating in two cohort studies: ESTHER (Germany) and TROMSØ (Norway); and a subset of previously published nested-case control data from a another cohort study: EPIC-Elderly (Greece, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden) from the CHANCES consortium on health and aging.

It has been reported that stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) is associated with tumor progression and metastatic spread, including in cervical cancer, breast carcinoma and prostatic cancer. The present study investigated whether STIM1, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) sensor and activator of store-operated channel entry, contributed to SGC7901 cell progression. The pGPU6-shSTIM1 recombinant plasmid was constructed, and the effects of downregulation of STIM1 on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of SGC7901 cells were examined. Western blot analysis revealed that transfection with the pGPU6-shSTIM1 plasmid successfully inhibited the expression of STIM1. STIM1 silencing in the gastric cancer cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and increasing the apoptotic rate following treatment of the SGC7901 cells with pGPU6-shSTIM1, indicated using an MTT cell viability assay and flow cytometery, respectively. As expected, STIM1 knock down also reduced the migration and invasion of the SGC7901 cells, demonstrated using a Transwell assay. The possible molecular mechanism involved the regulation of several signaling pathways involved in the biological behavior of cell survival, apoptosis, migration and metastasis. Together, these finding suggested that the expression of STIM1 is crucial for the proliferation and invasion of SGC7901 cells, providing a foundation for the development of novel type‑specific diagnostic strategies and treatments for gastric cancer.""","""['Bin Liu', 'Hai-Hong Yu', 'Hong-Li Ye', 'Zhi-Ying Luo', 'Feng Xiao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Suppression of stromal interaction molecule 1 inhibits SMMC7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest.', 'Stromal interaction molecule 1 plays an important role in gastric cancer progression.', 'Elevated Orai1 and STIM1 expressions upregulate MACC1 expression to promote tumor cell proliferation, metabolism, migration, and invasion in human gastric cancer.', 'Effects of stromal interaction molecule 1 RNA interference on the cell proliferation and apoptosis in human laryngeal cancer.', 'Suppression of STIM1 inhibits human glioblastoma cell proliferation and induces G0/G1 phase arrest.', 'Store-Operated Calcium Channels as Drug Target in Gastroesophageal Cancers.', 'Cross-Talk Between the Adenylyl Cyclase/cAMP Pathway and Ca2+ Homeostasis.', 'Oncogenic KRAS suppresses store-operated Ca2+ entry and ICRAC through ERK pathway-dependent remodelling of STIM expression in colorectal cancer cell lines.', 'The store-operated calcium channels in cancer metastasis: from cell migration, invasion to metastatic colonization.']"""

To assess the impact of changing technique and evolving quality assurance on genitourinary toxicity rates.  Methods and materials:   One hundred eighty patients were treated with external beam radiation therapy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRB) for localized intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, between December 2002 and February 2012. The HDRB technique evolved over the period of this study, from 19.5 Gy/3 (n = 68), to 17 Gy/2 (n = 40), 18 Gy/2 (n = 39), and most recently 19 Gy/2 (n = 33). In the two fraction cohort, 68 patients underwent additional correction for catheter displacement before each fraction.  Results:   With a median followup of 5.2 years, 5-year freedom from failure was 93.7% for intermediate, and 76.0% for high risk patients. The 3- and 6-year cumulative stricture incidence for all patients was 7.8% and 15.3%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in stricture rate for the four dose levels used nor between the three fractions and the two fraction technique overall. The 19 Gy/2 fractionation group had the lowest 3-year stricture rate (3.0%). The addition of correction for intrafraction catheter displacement did not result in a statistically significant difference in stricture rates, although the severity of strictures has been reduced.  Conclusions:   Our biochemical control is consistent with other similar series. We found no increase in late urinary toxicity with a two fraction, two implant HDRB technique compared with three fractions. The HDRB dose did not correlate with stricture rates in our series. Correction of intra-fraction catheter displacement did not lead to a statistically significant reduction in stricture rates, although may have mitigated the effects of dose escalation.""","""['Andrej Bece', 'Nitya Patanjali', 'Michael Jackson', 'May Whitaker', 'George Hruby']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy and hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy in the treatment of intermediate-risk prostate cancer - long term results.', 'Direct 2-arm comparison shows benefit of high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost vs external beam radiation therapy alone for prostate cancer.', 'What is the ideal radiotherapy dose to treat prostate cancer?

The aim of the present pilot study was to determine the circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels in Bulgarian prostate cancer (PCa) patients and to investigate their relationship with various determinants associated with the severity and progression of the disease.  Methods:   A total of 53 male patients (mean age 67.0 ± 7.1 years) with clinical suspicion for PCa were enrolled in the study. All patients were subjected to systemic transrectal ultrasound-guided tru-cut prostate biopsies (10 cores at least). Detected tumors were graded using the Gleason grading system. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum levels were measured immunochemically. The 25OHD assay was performed by a validated HPLC-UV method. Other covariates (BMI, age, family history of PCa) were collected by interview at the time of hospitalization. One-way ANOVA with Kruskal Wallis statistics was used for comparison of medians of different parameters. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.  Results:   Significantly lower 25OHD levels were detected in PCa patients compared to those with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) (p < 0.05). Patients with high grade tumors (Gleason score ≥ 7) showed significantly lower 25OHD levels, while those with low grade tumors (Gleason score < 7) revealed better 25OHD status (50.49 vs. 63.17 nmol/L, p < 0.05). A moderate negative correlation between 25OHD levels and the Gleason score was established (Spearman r = -0.46, p < 0.05). Significant seasonal variations in 25OHD levels, both for PCa and BPH patients, were detected (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   This preliminary study shows an association between 25OHD status and classical markers characterizing the severity of PCa. The results might suggest a potential beneficial role of vitamin D for PCa patients. Further prospective studies are needed to strengthen the interrelationships between 25OHD levels and variables related with PCa and to test them for causality.""","""['Bistra Galunska', 'Daniela Gerova', 'Petar Kosev', 'Deyan Anakievski', 'Alexander Hinev']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Lab""","""['Total and Gleason grade 4/5 cancer volumes are major contributors of human kallikrein 2, whereas free prostate specific antigen is largely contributed by benign gland volume in serum from patients with prostate cancer or benign prostatic biopsies.', 'IGF-II serum levels increase discrimination between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer and improve the predictive value of PSA in clinical staging.', ""Vitamin D Status Is Associated with Intestinal Inflammation as Measured by Fecal Calprotectin in Crohn's Disease in Clinical Remission."", 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Does testosterone mediate the relationship between vitamin D and prostate cancer progression?

Methods:   Relevant electronic databases were searched for studies characterizing the associated risk of overall malignancy in patients with AASV. Standardized incidence rates (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of association. We tested for publication bias and heterogeneity and stratified for site-specific cancers.  Results:   Six studies (n = 2,578) were eventually identified, of which six provided the SIR for overall malignancy, five reported the SIR for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), four for leukemia, five for bladder cancer, three for lymphoma, three for liver cancer, four for lung cancer, three for kidney cancer, four for prostate cancer, four for colon cancer and four for breast cancer. Overall, the pooled SIR of cancer in AASV patients was 1.74 (95%CI = 1.37-2.21), with moderate heterogeneity among these studies (I(2) = 65.8%, P = 0.012). In sub-analyses for site-specific cancers, NMSC, leukemia and bladder cancer were more frequently observed in patients with AASV with SIR of 5.18 (95%CI = 3.47-7.73), 4.89 (95%CI = 2.93-8.16) and 3.84 (95%CI = 2.72-5.42) respectively. There was no significant increase in the risk of kidney cancer (SIR = 2.12, 95%CI = 0.66-6.85), prostate cancer (SIR = 1.45, 95%CI = 0.87-2.42), colon cancer (SIR = 1.26, 95%CI = 0.70-2.27), and breast cancer (SIR = 0.95, 95%CI = 0.50-1.79). Among these site-specific cancers, only NMSC showed moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 55.8%, P = 0.06). No publication bias was found by using the Begg's test and Egger's test.  Conclusions:   This meta-analysis shows that AASV patients treatment with cyclophosphamide (CYC) are at increased risk of late-occurring malignancies, particularly of the NMSC, leukemia and bladder cancer.

Objective:   The ability of a new formulation of MAGIC-f polymer gel was assessed by experimental measurement and Monte Carlo (MC) method for studying the effect of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in prostate dose distributions under the internal Ir-192 and external 18MV radiotherapy practices.  Method:   A Plexiglas phantom was made representing human pelvis. The GNP shaving 15 nm in diameter and 0.1 mM concentration were synthesized using chemical reduction method. Then, a new formulation of MAGIC-f gel was synthesized. The fabricated gel was poured in the tubes located at the prostate (with and without the GNPs) and bladder locations of the phantom. The phantom was irradiated to an Ir-192 source and 18 MV beam of a Varian linac separately based on common radiotherapy procedures used for prostate cancer. After 24 hours, the irradiated gels were read using a Siemens 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. The absolute doses at the reference points and isodose curves resulted from the experimental measurement of the gels and MC simulations following the internal and external radiotherapy practices were compared.  Results:   The mean absorbed doses measured with the gel in the presence of the GNPs in prostate were 15% and 8 % higher than the corresponding values without the GNPs under the internal and external radiation therapies, respectively. MC simulations also indicated a dose increase of 14 % and 7 % due to presence of the GNPs, for the same experimental internal and external radiotherapy practices, respectively.  Conclusion:   There was a good agreement between the dose enhancement factors (DEFs) estimated with MC simulations and experiment gel measurements due to the GNPs.

We then found that high expression of Cullin-1 protein suggested a poor prognosis in PCa patients. Also, Cullin-1 promotes PCa cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. We then found that the mechanism of Cullin-1 regulation on cell-cycle progression is due to increased expression of p21 and p27, and decreased expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E after Cullin-1 knockdown.

IP6 induces apoptosis in multiple types of cancer cells, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, skin tumor, liver cancer and colorectal cancer. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms of its anticancer effects. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the activity of IP6 against human colorectal cancer cells (HT-29) and to determine whether the IP6 regulates apoptosis in HT-29 cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.  Method:   A human colorectal cancer cell line (HT-29) was used for the study. HT-29 cells were treated with 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL of IP6. The MTT colorimetric assay was used to observe the proliferation of HT-29 in vitro, and flow cytometry (FCM) was used to analyze the apoptosis of the HT-29 cells. The relative mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR, and relative protein levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis.  Result:   The results of MTT showed that HT-29 cells underwent inhibition of proliferation after exposure to IP6 (100-400 μg/mL) for 12 and 48 h, and this inhibition clearly relied on time and dosage. IP6 induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The mRNA and protein expression of PI3K and Akt decreased in the groups treated with IP6, and IP6 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt (pAkt), whereas increased the expression of its downstream effector, caspase-9.

Methods:   We conducted a prospective nested case-control study among 48 men (24 prostate cancer cases and 24 controls) aged 48 to 76 years at baseline. The participants of our study were a part of the Fernald Community Cohort. Prostate cancer cases and controls were matched individually on age (± 3 years) with a 1:1 ratio.

The purpose of this study was to use normal tissue complication probability modeling in an effort to derive SBRT specific dosimetric predictor's of late urinary flare.  Material and methods:   Two hundred and sixteen men were treated for localized prostate cancer using ultra- hypofractionated SBRT. A dose of 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions was delivered to the prostate and proximal seminal vesicles. Functional surveys were conducted before and after treatment to assess late toxicity. Phenomenologic NTCP models were fit to bladder DVHs and late urinary flare outcomes using maximum likelihood estimation.  Results:   Twenty-nine patients experienced late urinary flare within two years of completion of treatment. Fitting of bladder DVH data to a Lyman NTCP model resulted in parameter estimates of m, TD50, and n of 0.19 (0-0.47), 38.7 Gy (31.1-46.4), and 0.13 (-0.14-0.41), respectively. Subsequent fit to a hottest volume probit model revealed a significant association of late urinary flare with dose to the hottest 12.7% of bladder volume. Multivariate analysis resulted in a final model that included patient age and hottest volume probit model predictions. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a two-year urinary flare free survival of 95.7% in patients 65 years or older with a bladder D12.7% of 33.5 Gy or less, compared to 74.5% in patients meeting none of these criteria.  Conclusion:   NTCP modeling of late urinary flare after ultra-hypofractionated prostate SBRT demonstrates a relatively small volume effect for dose to the bladder, suggesting that reduction of volume receiving elevated dose will result in decreased incidence of late urinary toxicity.

The presence of the T/E fusion gene is strongly associated with the expression of ERG protein, but emerging evidence indicates a significant interfocal and intrafocal variability in the levels of ERG protein expression. We therefore analyzed ERG protein expression by image analysis to objectively quantitate the extent of such heterogeneity, and confirmed significant interfocal and intrafocal variability of ERG protein expression levels in cancer expressing ERG. To define the pathways associated with ERG and its variable expression in prostate cancer, we have analyzed the correlations of ERG expression, as evaluated by immunohistochemistry, with 46 key proteins associated with signal transduction, transcriptional control, and other processes using a large tissue microarray with more than 500 prostate cancers. We found a significant correlation of ERG expression with the markers of activation of the PI3K, MYC, and NFκB pathways, which had previously been linked directly or indirectly to ERG expression. We have also identified significant correlations with novel proteins that have not been previously linked to ERG expression, including serum response factor, the p160 coactivator SRC1, and Sprouty1. Notably, SKP2 only correlated with a high level of ERG protein expression.

ISOpure is the only mRNA computational purification method to date that does not require a paired tumour-normal sample, provides a personalized cancer profile for each patient, and has been tested on clinical data. Replacing mixed tumour profiles with ISOpure-preprocessed cancer profiles led to better prognostic gene signatures for lung and prostate cancer.  Results:   To simplify the integration of ISOpure into standard R-based bioinformatics analysis pipelines, the algorithm has been implemented as an R package.

Prostate cancer is often multifocal and diagnosis of the lesion could therefore be difficult with diagnostic imaging only; thus, multiple core biopsies are taken from several different regions of the prostate. In current practice, 10- or 12-core needle biopsy is considered the clinical standard. Several techniques have been reported to improve the orientation of the specimens, but tissue marking, which could theoretically provide important information on the location of the lesion in the prostate, has been rarely reported. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the clinical significance of systematic 12-core needle biopsy with tissue marking for preoperative prediction of lesion sites and clinicopathological features of patients. We evaluated 93 patients who underwent 12-core prostate biopsy and subsequent radical prostatectomy. We correlated the biopsy results to the prostate sites in which biopsies were performed and prognostic factors of the patients, especially the degree of extraprostatic extension (EPE) obtained in surgical specimens. Among 253 cancer foci detected in 93 prostatectomy specimens, 168 (66.4%) foci were detected by biopsy. All patients had proven cancer. EPE-positive cancers were associated with a larger number of positive cores, larger tumor length, and higher percentage of cancer tissue in the corresponding cores. Systematic 12-core prostate biopsy with tissue marking is useful for preoperative detection of cancer foci and provides valuable information that enables effective surgical strategies.""","""['Satoko Sato', 'Mika Watanabe', 'Shinji Taniuchi', 'Atsuko Kasajima', 'Koji Mitsuzuka', 'Yasuhiro Nakamura', 'Fumiyoshi Fujishima', 'Yoichi Arai', 'Hironobu Sasano']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tohoku J Exp Med""","""['Relationship between systematic biopsies and histological features of 222 radical prostatectomy specimens: lack of prediction of tumor significance for men with nonpalpable prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer polar localization on core biopsy predicts pathologic stage.', 'Prognostic significance of tumor volume in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens.', 'Findings in 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy that predict more advanced cancer at prostatectomy: analysis of 388 biopsy-prostatectomy pairs.', 'Comparison of digital rectal examination and biopsy results with the radical prostatectomy specimen.']"""

The mucin 1 (MUC1) heterodimeric oncoprotein is overexpressed in human prostate cancers with aggressive pathologic and clinical features, resulting in a poor outcome. However, the functional role for MUC1 C-terminal domain (MUC1-C) in androgen-independent prostate cancer occurrence and development has remained unclear.  Methods:   Cell viability was measured by MTT assays. Western blot analysis was performed to measure the phosphorylation and protein expression of SAPK/JNK and ERK1/2, and MUC1-C, NF-κB subunit p65 and p50. Exogenous expression of MUC1-C, NF-κB subunit p65 was carried out by transient and electroporated transfection assays.  Results:   We showed that curcumin inhibited the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and a synergy was observed in the presence of curcumin and bicalutamide, the androgen receptor antagonist. To further explore the potential mechanism underlining this, we found that curcumin increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK, which was enhanced by bicalutamide. In addition, curcumin reduced the protein expression of MUC1-C and NF-κB subunit p65, which were abrogated in the presence of the inhibitors of MEK/ERK1/2 (PD98059) and SAPK/JNK (SP60015). A further reduction was observed in the combination of curcumin with bicalutamide. Moreover, while exogenous expression of MUC1-C had little effect on curcumin-reduced p65, the overexpression of p65 reversed the effect of curcumin on MUC1-C protein expression suggesting that p65 is upstream of MUC1-C. Intriguingly, we showed that exogenous expression of MUC1-C feedback diminished the effect of curcumin on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK, and antagonized the effect of curcumin on cell growth.  Conclusion:   Our results show that curcumin inhibits the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells through ERK1/2- and SAPK/JNK-mediated inhibition of p65, followed by reducing expression of MUC1-C protein. More importantly, there are synergistic effects of curcumin and bicalutamide. The negative feedback regulatory loop of MUC1-C to ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK further demonstrates the role of MUC1-C that contributes to the overall responses of curcumin.

There were studies proving that high-dietary intake of genistein may relate to the low morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer (PCa) in the Asian population. Since there were few studies of plasma genistein level in the Chinese population, we performed this study to preliminarily evaluate the associations among plasma genistein, epidemiologic factors and PCa in a Chinese population.  Methods:   Between 2012 and 2013, 100 men over the age of 40 underwent prostate biopsy for PCa at Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China. Clinical information, epidemiologic information and blood samples were collected prior to biopsy for each patient. All patients underwent 10-core ultrasound-guided transperineal prostate biopsy, and the pathology results were collected after biopsy. We measured the plasma genistein concentration of the blood samples and analyzed the results along with the clinical and epidemiologic information.  Results:   Among the 100 patients, 46 (46.0 %) were diagnosed with PCa. The median plasma genistein concentration of non-PCa patients (728.6 ng/ml) was significantly higher than that of PCa patients (513.0 ng/ml) (P < 0.05). In the univariate analysis, we found that age and smoking history were related to PCa (P < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, we found that age, smoking history and plasma genistein were related to PCa (P < 0.05). The age-adjusted odds ratio of PCa risk comparing plasma genistein level above median to that below median was 0.31 (95 % CI 0.13-0.71).

Additionally, recent pre-clinical studies suggested enzalutamide might have the potential adverse effect of inducing metastasis of prostate cancer cells via Stat3 activation. This study is aimed to target Stat3 activation and improve enzalutamide therapy.  Experimental design:   Sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide was tested using cell growth assays and clonogenic assays. Wound healing and invasion assays were performed to determine cell migration and invasion in vitro. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, ELISA and Western blotting were performed to detect expression levels of PSA, c-Myc, survivin, Stat3, and AR. ChIP assay was performed to examine recruitment of AR to the PSA promoter.  Results:   In the present study, we found niclosamide, a previously identified novel inhibitor of androgen receptor variant (AR-V7), inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation, and expression of downstream target genes. Niclosamide synergistically reversed enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells and combination treatment of niclosamide with enzalutamide significantly induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell growth, colony formation, cell migration and invasion. Knock down of Stat3 abrogated enzalutamide resistance resulting in reduced recruitment of AR to the PSA promoter in prostate cancer cells expressing IL6. Moreover, niclosamide reversed enzalutamide resistance by down-regulating Stat3 target gene expression Stat3and abrogating recruitment of AR to PSA promoter resulting in PSA inhibition.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated the IL6-Stat3-AR axis in prostate cancer is one of the crucial mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance. Niclosamide has the potential to target the IL6-Stat3-AR pathway to overcome enzalutamide resistance and inhibit migration and invasion in advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Chengfei Liu', 'Wei Lou', 'Cameron Armstrong', 'Yezi Zhu', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Inhibition of constitutively active Stat3 reverses enzalutamide resistance in LNCaP derivative prostate cancer cells.', 'Niclosamide and Bicalutamide Combination Treatment Overcomes Enzalutamide- and Bicalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: AR aberrations and resistance to abiraterone or enzalutamide.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Evolving cognition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway: autoimmune disorders and cancer.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Niclosamide Revitalizes Sorafenib through Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF-1R)/Stemness and Metabolic Changes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Niclosamide as a Promising Therapeutic Player in Human Cancer and Other Diseases.', 'The magic bullet: Niclosamide.']"""

Recently, we have demonstrated that miR-187 is significantly downregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) and here we propose a proteomic approach to identify its potential targets. For this purpose, PC-3 cells were transiently transfected with miR-187 precursor and miRNA mimic negative control. Proteins were analyzed by a two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and defined as differentially regulated if the observed fold change was ±1.06. Then, MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed after protein digestion and low abundance proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS. Peptides were identified by searching against the Expasy SWISS PROT database, and target validation was performed both in vitro by western blot and qRT-PCR and in clinical samples by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and ELISA. DIGE analysis showed 9 differentially expressed spots (p<0.05) and 7 showed a down-regulated expression upon miR-187 re-introduction. Among these targets we identified aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3 (ALDH1A3). ALDH1A3 expression was significantly downregulated in PC3, LNCaP and DU-145 cells after miR-187 re-introduction. Supporting these data, the expression of ALDH1A3 was found significantly (p<0.0001) up-regulated in PCa samples and inversely correlated (p<0.0001) with miR-187 expression, its expression being directly associated with Gleason score (p = 0.05). The expression of ALDH1A3 was measured in urine samples to evaluate the predictive capability of this biomarker for the presence of PCa and, at a signification level of 10%, PSA and also ALDH1A3 were significantly associated with a positive biopsy of PCa.

Methods:   The model was based on a quadratic equation that relates the reduction in intensity to the equivalent path length (EPL) of the attenuator. In this study, two sets of quadratic equation coefficients were derived from calibration dose planes measured with EPID and ionization chamber in water under reference conditions. With two sets of coefficients, EPL can be calculated from either EPID or treatment planning system (TPS) dose planes. Consequently, either the in-phantom exit dose or the EPID transit dose can be predicted from the EPL. The model was tested with two open, five wedge and seven sliding window prostate and head and neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields on phantoms. Results were analysed using absolute gamma analysis (3%/3 mm).  Results:   The open fields gamma pass rates were >96.8% for all comparisons. For wedge and IMRT fields, comparisons between predicted and TPS-computed in-phantom exit dose resulted in mean gamma pass rate of 97.4% (range, 92.3-100%).

The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm to derive cell and cell nuclei size distributions from 2D histology samples, and build 3D cellular geometries to provide Monte Carlo (MC)-based dose calculation engines with a morphologically relevant input geometry. Stained and unstained regions of the histology samples are segmented using a Gaussian mixture model, and individual cell nuclei are identified via thresholding. Delaunay triangulation is applied to determine the distribution of distances between the centroids of nearest neighbour cells. A pouring simulation is used to build a 3D virtual tissue sample, with cell radii randomised according to the cell size distribution determined from the histology samples.

The comparison between this virtual slice and the measured histology is used to adjust the initial cell size distribution into the pouring simulation. This iterative approach of a pouring simulation with adjustments guided by comparison is continued until an input cell size distribution is found that yields a distribution in the sliced geometry that agrees with the measured histology samples.

The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanisms by which miR-145 deregulation contribute to prostate cancer progression. The miR-145 levels, measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, were found to inversely correlate with occurrence of metastases, survival and androgen deprivation therapy response in a well-characterized prostate cancer cohort. Introduction of ectopic miR-145 in prostate cancer cells generated an inhibitory effect on the AR at both transcript and protein levels as well as its activity and downstream targets prostate-specific antigen (PSA), kallikrein-related peptidase 2 and TMPRSS2. The regulation was shown to be mediated by direct binding using Ago2-specific immunoprecipitation, but there was also indication of synergetic AR activation. These findings were verified in clinical prostate specimens by demonstrating inverse correlations between miR-145 and AR expression as well as serum PSA levels. In addition, miR-145 was found to regulate androgen-dependent cell growth in vitro. Our findings put forward novel possibilities of therapeutic intervention, as miR-145 potentially could decrease both the stem cells and the AR expressing bulk of the tumour and hence reduce the transformation to the deadly castration-resistant form of prostate cancer.""","""['Olivia Larne', 'Zandra Hagman', 'Hans Lilja', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Anders Edsjö', 'Yvonne Ceder']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Systematic analysis of microRNAs targeting the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen-regulated miR-32 targets BTG2 and is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A transcriptional target of androgen receptor, miR-421 regulates proliferation and metabolism of prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor and miR-206 regulation in prostate cancer.', 'The transcriptional regulation of miR-21, its multiple transcripts, and their implication in prostate cancer.', 'Plasmatic MicroRNAs and Treatment Outcomes of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Hospital-Based Cohort Study and In Silico Analysis.', 'Investigating microRNA Profiles in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases and Functional Effects of microRNA-23c and microRNA-4328.', 'Fibronectin Modulates the Expression of miRNAs in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'miR-145-5p Inhibits Neuroendocrine Differentiation and Tumor Growth by Regulating the SOX11/MYCN Axis in Prostate cancer.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway in prostate cancer and associated drug resistance.']"""

This study, for the first time, reveals 3-AWA treatment consistently sequestered nuclear β-catenin and augmented its cytoplasmic pool as evidenced by reducing β-catenin transcriptional activity in these cells. Moreover, 3-AWA treatment triggered robust induction of pro-apoptotic intracellular Par-4, attenuated Akt activity and rescued Phospho-GSK3β (by Akt) to promote β-catenin destabilization. Further, our in vitro studies demonstrate that 3-AWA treatment amplified E-cadherin expression along with sharp downregulation of c-Myc and cyclin D1 proteins. Strikingly, endogenous Par-4 knock down by siRNA underscored 3-AWA mediated inhibition of nuclear β-catenin was Par-4 dependent and suppression of Par-4 activity, either by Bcl-2 or by Ras transfection, restored the nuclear β-catenin level suggesting Par-4 mediated β-catenin regulation was not promiscuous. In vivo results further demonstrated that 3-AWA was effective inhibitor of tumor growth and immunohistochemical studies indicated that increased expression of total β-catenin and decreased expression of phospho-β-catenin and Par-4 in breast cancer tissues as compared to normal breast tissue suggesting Par-4 and β-catenin proteins are mutually regulated and inversely co-related in normal as well as cancer condition. Thus, strategic regulation of intracellular Par-4 by 3-AWA in diverse cancers could be an effective tool to control cancer cell metastasis.

Treatment comprised daily oral administration of 60 mg of a stabilized free sulforaphane for 6 months (M0-M6) followed by 2 months without treatment (M6-M8).

This treatment can enhance adaptive immune responses without an exogenous vaccine, but the immunologic biomarkers associated with improved clinical outcome in cancer patients are not fully established. A phase Ib trial in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer was performed combining ipilimumab with sargramostim (GM-CSF). In addition to evaluating ipilimumab dose, patients were followed clinically for response and overall survival, and for immunomodulation of circulating T cells. PSA declines of ≥50% and radiographic responses were observed at doses of ≥3 mg/kg/dose. Timing of clinical responses could be either immediate or delayed. Durable responses were also observed off treatment. A subset of patients experienced long-term survival with or without objective clinical responses. The relationship between T-cell phenotype in peripheral blood and overall survival was examined retrospectively. We found that the treatment induced an increase in the levels of CD4(+) effector T (Teff) cells, regulatory T cells, PD-1(+) CD4 Teff cells, and PD-1(+) CD8 T cells. However, these increased levels were not associated with overall survival. Instead, low pretreatment baseline levels of PD-1(+) CD4 Teff cells were found to correlate with longer overall survival. Furthermore, baseline levels of PD-1(+) CD4 Teff cells from patients with shorter overall survival were higher than from cancer-free male control subjects. These results suggest that preexisting expression of immunologic checkpoint marker PD-1 on CD4 Teff cells may help identify patients that may benefit from ipilimumab treatment.""","""['Serena S Kwek', 'Jera Lewis', 'Li Zhang', 'Vivian Weinberg', 'Samantha K Greaney', 'Andrea L Harzstark', 'Amy M Lin', 'Charles J Ryan', 'Eric J Small', 'Lawrence Fong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Res""","""['Pre-existing immune status associated with response to combination of sipuleucel-T and ipilimumab in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination immunotherapy induces distinct T-cell repertoire responses when administered to patients with different malignancies.', 'Ipilimumab plus sargramostim vs ipilimumab alone for treatment of metastatic melanoma: a randomized clinical trial.', 'Prospects for the use of ipilimumab in treating advanced prostate cancer.', 'The next generation of immunotherapy: keeping lung cancer in check.', 'CD4+ conventional T cells-related genes signature is a prognostic indicator for ovarian cancer.', 'A universal MHCII technology platform to characterize antigen-specific CD4+ T\xa0cells.', 'Racial differences in prostate tumor microenvironment: implications for disparate clinical outcomes and potential opportunities.', 'Recombinant GM-CSF for diseases of GM-CSF insufficiency: Correcting dysfunctional mononuclear phagocyte disorders.', 'Roles of m5C RNA Modification Patterns in Biochemical Recurrence and Tumor Microenvironment Characterization of Prostate Adenocarcinoma.']"""

The myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are important inhibitors of T-cell responses in solid tumors, such as prostate cancers. However, targeting MDSCs proved challenging due to their phenotypic heterogeneity.  Experimental design:   Myeloid cell populations were evaluated using flow cytometry on blood samples, functional assays, and immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent stainings on specimens from healthy subjects, localized and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.  Results:   Here, we identify a population of Lin(-)CD15(HI)CD33(LO) granulocytic MDSCs that accumulate in patients' circulation during prostate cancer progression from localized to metastatic disease. The prostate cancer-associated MDSCs potently inhibit autologous CD8(+) T cells' proliferation and production of IFNγ and granzyme-B. The circulating MDSCs have high levels of activated STAT3, which is a central immune checkpoint regulator. The granulocytic pSTAT3(+) cells are also detectable in patients' prostate tissues. We previously generated an original strategy to silence genes specifically in Toll-like Receptor-9 (TLR9) positive myeloid cells using CpG-siRNA conjugates. We demonstrate that human granulocytic MDSCs express TLR9 and rapidly internalize naked CpG-STAT3siRNA, thereby silencing STAT3 expression. STAT3 blocking abrogates immunosuppressive effects of patients-derived MDSCs on effector CD8(+) T cells. These effects depended on reduced expression and enzymatic activity of Arginase-1, a downstream STAT3 target gene and a potent T-cell inhibitor.  Conclusions:   Overall, we demonstrate the accumulation of granulocytic MDSCs with prostate cancer progression and the feasibility of using TLR9-targeted STAT3siRNA delivery strategy to alleviate MDSC-mediated immunosuppression.""","""['Dewan M S Hossain', 'Sumanta K Pal', 'Dayson Moreira', 'Priyanka Duttagupta', 'Qifang Zhang', 'Haejung Won', 'Jeremy Jones', ""Massimo D'Apuzzo"", 'Stephen Forman', 'Marcin Kortylewski']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['TLR9 expression and secretion of LIF by prostate cancer cells stimulates accumulation and activity of polymorphonuclear MDSCs.', 'STAT3 Inhibition Combined with CpG Immunostimulation Activates Antitumor Immunity to Eradicate Genetically Distinct Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancers.', 'Myeloid cells as a target for oligonucleotide therapeutics: turning obstacles into opportunities.', 'Myeloid-derived suppressor cells suppress antitumor immune responses through IDO expression and correlate with lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins: regulators of myeloid-derived suppressor cell-mediated immunosuppression in cancer.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.', '""Open Sesame"" to the complexity of pattern recognition receptors of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer.', 'Inflammation in Urological Malignancies: The Silent Killer.', 'Suppression of prostate cancer and amelioration of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through selective immunoproteasome inhibition.', 'The tumor innate immune microenvironment in prostate cancer: an overview of soluble factors and cellular effectors.']"""

A set of protein molecules as potential biomarkers was therefore evaluated in serum of PCa patients.  Methods:   Serum samples from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RPE) for biopsy-proven PCa without neoadjuvant treatment were compared to serum samples from healthy subjects. Preliminary screening of 119 proteins in 10 PCa patients and 10 controls was carried out by the Proteome Profiler Antibody Array. Those markers showing distinct differences between patients and controls were then further evaluated by ELISA in the serum of 165 PCa patients and 19 controls. Uni- and multivariate as well as correlation analysis were performed to test the capability of these molecules to detect disease and predict pathological outcome.  Results:   Screening showed that soluble (s)E-cadherin, E-selectin, MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, TIMP2, Galectin and Clusterin warranted further evaluation. sE-Cadherin, TIMP1, Galectin and Clusterin were significantly over- and MMP9 under-expressed in PCa compared to controls. The concentration of sE-cadherin, MMP2 and Clusterin correlated negatively and that of MMP9 and TIMP1 positively with the Gleason Sum at prostatectomy. Only sE-cadherin significantly correlated with the highest Gleason pattern. Compared to serum PSA, sE-cadherin provided an independent and better matching predictive ability for discriminating PCas with an upgrade at RPE and aggressive tumors with a Gleason Sum ≥7.

The association between TTFC and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death in the United States, has not yet been reported.  Methods:   We investigated the cross-sectional association between TTFC and prevalent COPD among 6,108 current smokers in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. COPD was defined as a self-reported diagnosis of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or both. Current smokers in PLCO reported TTFC, the amount of time they typically waited before smoking their first cigarette of the day after waking, in four categories: ≤ 5, 6-30, 31-60, or > 60 minutes. We used logistic regression models to investigate the association between TTFC and prevalent COPD with adjustments for age, gender, race, education, and smoking (cigarettes/day, years smoked during lifetime, pack-years, age at smoking initiation), and prior lung cancer diagnosis.  Results:   COPD was reported by 19% of these 6,108 smokers. Individuals with the shortest TTFC had the greatest risk of COPD; compared to those with the longest TTFC (> 60 minutes) the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for COPD were 1.48 (95% CI, 1.15-1.91), 1.64 (95% CI, 1.29-2.08), 2.18 (95% CI, 1.65-2.87) for those with TTFC 31-60 minutes, 6-30 minutes, and ≤ 5 minutes, respectively (P-trend < 0.0001). The association between TTFC and emphysema was similar to that for bronchitis, albeit the ORs were slightly stronger for chronic bronchitis; comparing TTFC ≤5 minutes to > 60 minutes, the adjusted OR (95% CI) was 2.29 (1.69-3.12) for emphysema and 2.99 (1.95-4.59) for chronic bronchitis.  Conclusions:   Current smokers with shorter TTFC have increased risk of COPD compared to those with longer TTFC, even after comprehensive adjustment for established smoking covariates. Future epidemiologic studies, including prospective designs, should incorporate TTFC to better assess disease risk and evaluate the potential utility of TTFC as a COPD screening tool for smokers in the clinical setting.""","""['Kristin A Guertin', 'Fangyi Gu', 'Sholom Wacholder', 'Neal D Freedman', 'Orestis A Panagiotou', 'Carolyn Reyes-Guzman', 'Neil E Caporaso']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Time to First Cigarette, a Proxy of Nicotine Dependence, Increases the Risk of Pulmonary Impairment, Independently of Current and Lifetime Smoking Behavior.', 'Time to smoke first morning cigarette and lung cancer in a case-control study.', 'Cigarette smoking and pancreatic cancer risk: a revisit with an assessment of the nicotine dependence phenotype.', 'Smoking cessation in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.', 'ROLE OF GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY IN NICOTINE ADDICTION AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.', '""Wake-and-bake"" cannabis use: Predictors and cannabis-related outcomes of use shortly after waking.', 'Cigarette dependence is more prevalent and increasing among US adolescents and adults who use cannabis, 2002-2019.', 'Household Smoking Restrictions, Time to First Cigarette and Tobacco Dependence.', 'Origins of human disease: the chrono-epigenetic perspective.', 'Association of the Time to First Cigarette and the Prevalence of Chronic Respiratory Diseases in Chinese Elderly Population.']"""

Here we examined the role of stromal Cav1 for growth and radiation response of MPR31-4 prostate cancer xenograft tumors using Cav1-deficient C57Bl/6 mice. Syngeneic MPR31-4 tumors grew faster when implanted into Cav1-deficient mice. Increased tumor growth on Cav1-deficient mice was linked to decreased integration of smooth muscle cells into the wall of newly formed blood vessels and thus with a less stabilized vessel phenotype compared with tumors from Cav1 wild-type animals. However, tumor growth delay of MPR31-4 tumors grown on Cav1 knockout mice to a single high-dose irradiation with 20 Gray was more pronounced compared with tumors grown on wild-type mice. Increased radiation-induced tumor growth delay in Cav1-deficient mice was associated with an increased endothelial cell apoptosis. In vitro studies using cultured endothelial cells (ECs) confirmed that the loss of Cav1 expression increases sensitivity of ECs to radiation-induced apoptosis and reduces their clonogenic survival after irradiation. Immunohistochemical analysis of human tissue specimen further revealed that although Cav1 expression is mostly reduced in the tumor stroma of advanced and metastatic prostate cancer, the vascular compartment still expresses high levels of Cav1. In conclusion, the radiation response of MPR31-4 prostate tumors is critically regulated by Cav1 expression in the tumor vasculature. Thus, Cav1 might be a promising therapeutic target for combinatorial therapies to counteract radiation resistance of prostate cancer at the level of the tumor vasculature.""","""['D Klein', 'T Schmitz', 'V Verhelst', 'A Panic', 'M Schenck', 'H Reis', 'M Drab', 'A Sak', 'C Herskind', 'P Maier', 'V Jendrossek']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogenesis""","""['Progression-related loss of stromal Caveolin 1 levels fosters the growth of human PC3 xenografts and mediates radiation resistance.', 'Caveolin-1 regulates the ASMase/ceramide-mediated radiation response of endothelial cells in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.', 'Progression-Related Loss of Stromal Caveolin 1 Levels Mediates Radiation Resistance in Prostate Carcinoma via the Apoptosis Inhibitor TRIAP1.', 'Caveolin-1, cancer and therapy resistance.', 'Prognostic significance and therapeutic implications of Caveolin-1 in gastrointestinal tract malignancies.', '""Stromal cells in prostate cancer pathobiology: friends or foes?"".', 'Alteration of cholesterol distribution at the plasma membrane of cancer cells: From evidence to pathophysiological implication and promising therapy strategy.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived gene signatures predict radiotherapeutic survival in prostate cancer patients.', 'Stromal Reprogramming by FAK Inhibition Overcomes Radiation Resistance to Allow for Immune Priming and Response to Checkpoint Blockade.', 'Stromal Fibroblasts Counteract the Caveolin-1-Dependent Radiation Response of LNCaP Prostate Carcinoma Cells.']"""

Screening strategies vary in intensity. Higher-intensity strategies are not necessarily higher value. High-value strategies provide a degree of benefits that clearly justifies the harms and costs incurred; low-value screening provides limited or no benefits to justify the harms and costs. When cancer screening leads to benefits, an optimal intensity of screening maximizes value. Some aspects of screening practices, especially overuse and underuse, are low value.  Methods:   Screening strategies for asymptomatic, average-risk adults for 5 common types of cancer were evaluated by reviewing clinical guidelines and evidence syntheses from the American College of Physicians (ACP), U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Cancer Society, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Gastroenterological Association, and American Urological Association. ""High value"" was defined as the lowest screening intensity threshold at which organizations agree about screening recommendations for each type of cancer and ""low value"" as agreement about not recommending overly intensive screening strategies. This information is supplemented with additional findings from randomized, controlled trials; modeling studies; and studies of costs or resource use, including information found in the National Cancer Institute's Physician Data Query and UpToDate. The ACP provides high-value care screening advice for 5 common types of cancer; the specifics are outlined in this article. The ACP strongly encourages clinicians to adopt a cancer screening strategy that focuses on reaching all eligible persons with these high-value screening options while reducing overly intensive, low-value screening.""","""['Timothy J Wilt', 'Russell P Harris', 'Amir Qaseem;High Value Care Task Force of the American College of Physicians']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Ann Intern Med""","""['Summaries for Patients.

Most clinical treatment planning systems currently in use approximate all tissue to water, neglecting the existence of inhomogeneities, such as calcifications. The presence of prostatic calcifications may perturb the dose due to the higher photoelectric effect cross section in comparison to water. This study quantitatively evaluates the effect of prostatic calcifications on the dosimetric outcome of brachytherapy treatments by means of Monte Carlo simulations and its potential clinical consequences.Four pathological calcification samples were characterised with micro-particle induced x-ray emission (μ-PIXE) to determine their heavy elemental composition. Calcium, phosphorus and zinc were found to be the predominant heavy elements in the calcification composition. Four clinical patient brachytherapy treatments were modelled using Geant4 based Monte Carlo simulations, in terms of the distribution of brachytherapy seeds and calcifications in the prostate. Dose reductions were observed to be up to 30% locally to the calcification boundary, calcification size dependent. Single large calcifications and closely placed calculi caused local dose reductions of between 30-60%. Individual calculi smaller than 0.5 mm in diameter showed minimal dosimetric impact, however, the effects of small or diffuse calcifications within the prostatic tissue could not be determined using the methods employed in the study. The simulation study showed a varying reduction on common dosimetric parameters. D90 showed a reduction of 2-5%, regardless of calcification surface area and volume. The parameters V100, V150 and V200 were also reduced by as much as 3% and on average by 1%. These reductions were also found to relate to the surface area and volume of calcifications, which may have a significant dosimetric impact on brachytherapy treatment, however, such impacts depend strongly on specific factors in the patient's individual treatment. These factors include the number, size, composition and spatial distribution of calcifications in the prostate as well as the distribution of brachytherapy seeds.""","""['D J Pope', 'D L Cutajar', 'S P George', 'S Guatelli', 'J A Bucci', 'K E Enari', 'S Miller', 'R Siegele', 'A B Rosenfeld']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Calcifications in low-dose rate prostate seed brachytherapy treatment: post-planning dosimetry and predictive factors.', 'Investigation of interseed attenuation and tissue composition effects in (125)I seed implant prostate brachytherapy.', 'Large-scale Retrospective Monte Carlo Dosimetric Study for Permanent Implant Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'Sensitivity of low energy brachytherapy Monte Carlo dose calculations to uncertainties in human tissue composition.', 'Effect of prostate size and isotope selection on dosimetric quality following permanent seed implantation.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Mask-Adapted Background Field Removal for Artifact Reduction in Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping of the Prostate.']"""

It also examines the challenges encountered by health care providers when disclosing an AD diagnosis to patients and caregivers. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have AD; 5.1 million are age 65 years, and approximately 200,000 are age <65 years and have younger onset AD. By mid-century, the number of people living with AD in the United States is projected to grow by nearly 10 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. Today, someone in the country develops AD every 67 seconds. By 2050, one new case of AD is expected to develop every 33 seconds, resulting in nearly 1 million new cases per year, and the estimated prevalence is expected to range from 11 million to 16 million. In 2013, official death certificates recorded 84,767 deaths from AD, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age 65 years. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths resulting from heart disease, stroke and prostate cancer decreased 14%, 23% and 11%, respectively, whereas deaths from AD increased 71%. The actual number of deaths to which AD contributes (or deaths with AD) is likely much larger than the number of deaths from AD recorded on death certificates. In 2015, an estimated 700,000 Americans age 65 years will die with AD, and many of them will die from complications caused by AD. In 2014, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.9 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $217 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 years with AD and other dementias are more than two and a half times as great as payments for all beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2015 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 years with dementia are expected to be $226 billion. Among people with a diagnosis of AD or another dementia, fewer than half report having been told of the diagnosis by their health care provider. Though the benefits of a prompt, clear and accurate disclosure of an AD diagnosis are recognized by the medical profession, improvements to the disclosure process are needed. These improvements may require stronger support systems for health care providers and their patients.""","""['Alzheimer’s Association']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Alzheimers Dement""","""[""2014 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""2016 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""2012 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""The costs of Alzheimer's disease and the value of effective therapies."", 'Dementia -- Caring, Ethics, Ethnical and Economical Aspects: A Systematic Review Internet.', 'Dementia care navigation: Building toward a common definition, key principles, and outcomes.', 'Management Practice and Clinical Outcomes of Dementia in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review.', ""Characterization of Mitochondrial DNA Methylation of Alzheimer's Disease in Plasma Cell-Free DNA."", ""PPAD: a deep learning architecture to predict progression of Alzheimer's disease."", 'Predictors of cognitive impairment in patients undergoing ileostomy for colorectal cancer: a retrospective analysis.']"""

Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) association analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data can improve upon the detection of cis-acting regulatory variation by leveraging allele-specific expression (ASE) patterns in association analysis. Here, we present a comprehensive evaluation of cis-acting eQTLs by analyzing RNA-seq gene-expression data and genome-wide high-density genotypes from 471 samples of normal primary prostate tissue. Using statistical models that integrate ASE information, we identified extensive cis-eQTLs across the prostate transcriptome and found that approximately 70% of expressed genes corresponded to a significant eQTL at a gene-level false-discovery rate of 0.05. Overall, cis-eQTLs were heavily concentrated near the transcription start and stop sites of affected genes, and effects were negatively correlated with distance. We identified multiple instances of cis-acting co-regulation by using phased genotype data and discovered 233 SNPs as the most strongly associated eQTLs for more than one gene. We also noted significant enrichment (25/50, p = 2E-5) of previously reported prostate cancer risk SNPs in prostate eQTLs. Our results illustrate the benefit of assessing ASE data in cis-eQTL analyses by showing better reproducibility of prior eQTL findings than of eQTL mapping based on total expression alone. Altogether, our analysis provides extensive functional context of thousands of SNPs in prostate tissue, and these results will be of critical value in guiding studies examining disease of the human prostate.""","""['Nicholas B Larson', 'Shannon McDonnell', 'Amy J French', 'Zach Fogarty', 'John Cheville', 'Sumit Middha', 'Shaun Riska', 'Saurabh Baheti', 'Asha A Nair', 'Liang Wang', 'Daniel J Schaid', 'Stephen N Thibodeau']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Hum Genet""","""['Characterising cis-regulatory variation in the transcriptome of histologically normal and tumour-derived pancreatic tissues.', 'Powerful identification of cis-regulatory SNPs in human primary monocytes using allele-specific gene expression.', 'Comparing allele specific expression and local expression quantitative trait loci and the influence of gene expression on complex trait variation in cattle.', 'Expression Quantitative Trait Loci Information Improves Predictive Modeling of Disease Relevance of Non-Coding Genetic Variation.', 'The Power of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing in eQTL Discovery.', 'InferLoop: leveraging single-cell chromatin accessibility for the signal of chromatin loop.', 'Systematic fine-mapping and functional studies of prostate cancer risk variants.', 'Extensive germline-somatic interplay contributes to prostate cancer progression through HNF1B co-option of TMPRSS2-ERG.', 'Prostate Cancer Transcriptomic Regulation by the Interplay of Germline Risk Alleles, Somatic Mutations, and 3D Genomic Architecture.', 'A microRNA Transcriptome-wide Association Study of Prostate Cancer Risk.']"""

We aimed to characterize post-radiation biopsy findings, including the treatment effect and the zonal distribution of recurrent disease after radiation therapy, in men experiencing biochemical recurrence.  Materials and methods:   We identified patients who received post-radiation biopsy in the setting of biochemical recurrence following primary radiation for localized disease. Histological post-radiation biopsy results were categorized by the absence of tumor, demonstration of radiation treatment effect, failure (recurrent cancer) or a combination of treatment effect and failure. We described patterns of histological failure and compared them to the diagnostic biopsy findings.  Results:   A total of 284 men underwent mapped post-radiation biopsy for biochemical recurrence. Mean age at initial diagnosis was 63 years and median prostate specific antigen was 8.2 ng/ml. Of the men 33%, 32% and 35% were classified at low, intermediate and high risk based on clinical CAPRA (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment) categories. Median time to post-radiation biopsy was 61 months after treatment. Findings were negative in 4% of cases while we noted a treatment effect in 31%, failure in 45% and a combination in 20%. Failure rates were similar across sextants. Of 140 patients with mapped pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies 4% demonstrated cancer in a new location previously identified as negative. Gleason upgrading occurred in 43% of cases with 85% upgraded to 4 + 3 or higher.  Conclusions:   Men with rising prostate specific antigen after radiotherapy for prostate cancer most often experience recurrence in dominant tumor sites. Whether failure is due to inadequate targeting, dosing or intrinsic radiation resistance remains unknown to our knowledge.

Methods:   Data for all non-metastatic prostate cancer cases diagnosed 1993-2002 and followed to the end of 2007 were analysed. The outcome was progression to metastatic disease, identified by metastatic episode notifications in the CCR or by prostate cancer death. Factors associated with metastatic disease progression were identified using Cox regression models.  Results:   Of the 32,643 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis 43.1% had localised disease, 5.1% had regional spread and 51.9% had unknown stage. After a median of 6.8 years of follow-up 6708 cases (20.6%) had developed distant metastases. The risk of developing metastatic disease was significantly higher for those with regional (adjusted HR=2.65, 95% CI: 2.40-2.93) or unknown initial stage (adjusted HR=1.70, 95% CI: 1.61-1.80), for older men (65-74 years: HR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.33-1.53; >74 years: HR=2.73, 95% CI: 2.55-2.93), and those living in inner regional (HR=1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.18) or rural areas (HR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.14-1.36) or more disadvantaged areas (middle tertile: HR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.16; most disadvantaged: HR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.19).

To create a computer-based decision aid (CBDA) for increasing prostate knowledge, decision self-efficacy, and intention to make an informed decision, the study implemented an iterative approach to develop a culturally appropriate CBDA.  Method:   A short CBDA prototype containing PrCA information and interactive activities was developed. A sample of 21 AA men aged 37 to 66 years in South Carolina participated in one of seven 90-minute focus groups and completed a 36-item survey. Updates were made to the CBDA based on participant feedback. The CBDA and heuristic evaluation surveys were then distributed to six expert reviewers. Ten men were also randomly selected from our sample population to participate in interviews regarding usability of the CBDA.  Results:   Participants and expert reviewers expressed consensus on many features of the CBDA, but some suggested changes to the format and graphics in order to enhance the CBDA's effectiveness. Development and evaluation processes and implications are discussed.  Conclusions:   Using CBDAs for informed decision making may be appropriate for AA men.

Plexin-B1, the receptor for semaphorin4D (Sema4D), has been implicated in prostate cancer where mutation of the gene and overexpression of the protein occur. It is not clear, however, as to which of the several Sema4D-activated signalling pathways downstream of plexin-B1 function in prostate cancer progression. We show here that Sema4D/plexin-B1 increases the expression of androgen-responsive genes and activates the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR). Activation of plexin-B1 results in phosphorylation of AR at Serine 81, a site that is phosphorylated by nuclear kinases. Cell fractionation and immunocytochemistry studies demonstrated that the proportion of cells with AR in the nucleus increases significantly upon Sema4D treatment. The N-terminal (AF-1) domain of AR, which contains binding sites for transcription regulators, is not required for this response. Depletion of AR suppressed Sema4D-induced anchorage-independent growth of LNCaP and LNCaP-LN3 cells, demonstrating the functional significance of these findings. These results show that Sema4D/plexin-B1 signalling promotes the translocation of AR to the nucleus and thereby enhances AR transcriptional activity. Plexin-B1 is therefore a promising target for cancer therapy, especially in low androgen situations such as those imposed by androgen deprivation therapy.""","""['M Williamson', 'P de Winter', 'J R Masters']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Transactivation of Met signalling by semaphorin4D in human placenta: implications for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.', 'Semaphorin-plexin signalling genes associated with human breast tumourigenesis.', 'PlexinB1 Promotes Nuclear Translocation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor.', 'Roles of Sema4D and Plexin-B1 in tumor progression.', 'The Plexin-B family and its role in cancer progression.', 'B-type Plexins promote the GTPase activity of Ran to affect androgen receptor nuclear translocation in prostate cancer.', 'Multi-omic profiling reveals an RNA processing rheostat that predisposes to prostate cancer.', 'Plexin-B1 Mutation Drives Metastasis in Prostate Cancer Mouse Models.', 'Posttranslational regulation of androgen dependent and independent androgen receptor activities in prostate cancer.', 'A Multi-Analyte Approach for Improved Sensitivity of Liquid Biopsies in Prostate Cancer.']"""

After identifying the most sensitive guideline for the entire cohort we compared demographic and tumor characteristics between patients who met this guideline and entered active surveillance, and those who received initial definitive therapy.  Results:   Of 4,882 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer 18% underwent active surveillance. When applied to the entire cohort, the sensitivity of published guidelines ranged from 49% in Toronto to 62% at Johns Hopkins. At a practice level the sensitivity of Johns Hopkins criteria varied widely from 27% to 84% (p <0.001). Compared with men undergoing active surveillance, those meeting Johns Hopkins criteria who received definitive therapy were younger (p <0.001) and more likely to have a positive family history (p = 0.003), lower prostate specific antigen (p <0.001), a greater number of positive cores (2 vs 1) on biopsy (p <0.001) and a higher cancer volume in positive core(s) (p = 0.002).

However, the optimal sequencing of these agents is unclear, and no previous reports discuss Japanese metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. The purpose of this analysis is to reveal the outcomes of Japanese metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate followed by docetaxel.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed Japanese Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate until disease progression and subsequently treated with docetaxel. The primary outcome measure was the rates of prostate-specific antigen declines ≧30 and ≧50%, respectively, with docetaxel. Secondary outcome measures included progression-free survival with docetaxel, and overall survival after initiation of abiraterone acetate and docetaxel. We performed correlation analysis between previous prostate-specific antigen response to abiraterone acetate and subsequent prostate-specific antigen response to docetaxel.  Results:   We identified 15 patients had experienced disease progression with abiraterone acetate and subsequently were treated with docetaxel. Prostate-specific antigen declines ≧30 and ≧50% with docetaxel were observed in five patients (33%) and two patients (13%), respectively. The median progression-free survival with docetaxel was 3.7 months (95% confidence interval: 2.9-4.6). The median overall survival from initiation of docetaxel and abiraterone acetate were 14.4 months (95% confidence interval: 6.3-22.4), and 25.7 months (95% confidence interval: 20.1-30.7), respectively. No significant correlation was observed between these prostate-specific antigen responses (Pearson r = 0.206, P = 0.46).  Conclusion:   The efficacy of docetaxel in Japanese mCRPC patients that was resistant to abiraterone acetate was modest. The prostate-specific antigen response to previous abiraterone acetate could not predict the efficacy of subsequent docetaxel.

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) allows for targeted biopsy of suspicious areas of the prostate instead of random 12-core biopsy. This method has been shown to be more accurate in detecting significant PCa. However, the precise spatial accuracy of cognitive targeting is unknown.  Methods:   Consecutive patients undergoing mpMRI-targeted TRUSGB with cognitive registration (MRTB-COG) followed by robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were included in the present analysis. The regions of interest (ROIs) involved by the index lesion reported on mpMRI were subsequently targeted by two experienced urologists using the cognitive approach. The 27 ROIs were used as spatial reference. Mapping on radical prostatectomy specimen was used as reference to determine true-positive mpMRI findings. Per core correlation analysis was performed.  Results:   Forty patients were included. Overall, 40 index lesions involving 137 ROIs (mean ROIs per index lesion 3.43) were identified on MRI. After correlating these findings with final pathology, 117 ROIs (85 %) were considered as true-positive lesions. A total of 102 biopsy cores directed toward such true-positive ROIs were available for final analysis. Cognitive targeted biopsy hit the target in 82 % of the cases (84/102). The only identified risk factor for missing the target was an anterior situated ROI (p = 0.01).  Conclusion:   In experienced hands, cognitive MRTB-COG allows for an accuracy of 82 % in hitting the correct target, given that it is a true-positive lesion.

In our previous study, we found a novel derivative of pterostilbene (PTER), to be an effective inducer of apoptosis in human breast and prostate cancer cells affecting various cellular targets. Herein, we further attempted to investigate its anti-inflammatory potential followed by its probable mode of action. The newly developed compound was tested for its anti-inflammatory actions in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and carrageenan induced rat paw edema models. Our data showed that the derivative inhibited the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as well as the downstream products like nitric oxide (NO) and PGE2, at much lower doses as compared to PTER. This effect was found to be associated with the inhibition of phosphorylation/degradation of IκB-α and nuclear translocation of the p-NFκB p65. Moreover, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) was also observed. In addition, the newly developed compound also reduced the paw edema, the tissue content of NO, PGE2 and expression of iNOS and COX-2 proteins within the tissues after λ-carrageenan stimulation. Taken together, our findings provide the possibility that the PTER derivative might have enhanced cancer chemopreventive potential based on its stronger anti-NFκB and anti-inflammatory activities as compared to its natural counterpart, i.e., PTER.

Recently, we identified that TRPM8 is as an ionotropic testosterone receptor. The TRPM8 mRNA is expressed in early prostate tumors with high androgen levels, while anti-androgen therapy greatly reduces its expression. Here, from the chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, we found that an androgen response element (ARE) mediates androgen regulation of trpm8. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence, calcium-imaging and planar lipid bilayers, we identified that TRPM8 channel is functionally regulated by androgens in the prostate. Although TRPM8 mRNA is expressed at high levels, we found that the TRPM8 protein undergoes ubiquitination and degradation in PC cells. The mass-spectrometry analysis of TRPM8, immunoprecipitated from LNCaP cells identified ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 1 (UBA1). PYR-41, a potent inhibitor of initial enzyme in the ubiquitination cascade, UBA1, increased TRPM8 activity on the plasma membrane (PM) of LNCaP cells. Furthermore, PYR-41-mediated PMTRPM8 activity was accompanied by enhanced activation of p53 and Caspase-9. Interestingly, we found that the trpm8 promoter possesses putative binding sites for p53 and that the overexpression of p53 increased the TRPM8 mRNA levels. In addition to the genomic regulation of TRPM8 by AR and p53, our findings indicate that the testosterone-induced PMTRPM8 activity elicits Ca2+ uptake, subsequently causing apoptotic cell death. These findings support the strategy of rescuing PMTRPM8 expression as a new therapeutic application through the regulation of PC cell growth and proliferation.""","""['Swapna Asuthkar', 'Kiran Kumar Velpula', 'Pia A Elustondo', 'Lusine Demirkhanyan', 'Eleonora Zakharian']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['TRPM8-androgen receptor association within lipid rafts promotes prostate cancer cell migration.', 'Evidence for specific TRPM8 expression in human prostate secretory epithelial cells: functional androgen receptor requirement.', 'Androgen regulated TRPM8 expression: a potential mRNA marker for metastatic prostate cancer detection in body fluids.', 'TRPM8 and prostate: a cold case?', 'Membrane Androgen Receptors Unrelated to Nuclear Steroid Receptors.', '""ThermoTRP"" Channel Expression in Cancers: Implications for Diagnosis and Prognosis (Practical Approach by a Pathologist).', 'Therapeutic potential of TRPM8 channels in cancer treatment.', 'Menthol: An underestimated anticancer agent.', 'TRPV6 Calcium Channel Targeting by Antibodies Raised against Extracellular Epitopes Induces Prostate Cancer Cell Apoptosis.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.']"""

Mixed-effects logistic regression analyses were performed to predict information seeking about each topic, adjusting for demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and clustering of repeated observations within individuals.  Results:   Information seeking about reducing risks of cancer recurrence was the most frequently reported topic across survivors and over time. Breast cancer survivors were more likely to seek about survivorship topics at round 1 compared with other survivors. In general, information seeking declined over time, but cancer-specific patterns emerged: the decline was sharpest for breast cancer survivors, whereas in later years female colon cancer survivors actually sought more information (about how to reduce the risk of family members getting colon cancer or a different cancer).  Conclusion:   Cancer survivors' information needs varied over time depending on the topic, and these trends differed by cancer type.

Objective:   To determine the value of this model in predicting high-grade cancer at biopsy in a community-based setting in which referral criteria included percentage of fPSA to tPSA (%fPSA).  Design, setting, and participants:   We evaluated the model, with or without adding blood levels of microseminoprotein-β (MSMB) in a cohort of 749 men referred for prostate biopsy due to elevated PSA (≥3 ng/ml), low %fPSA (<20%), or suspicious digital rectal examination at Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The kallikrein markers, with or without MSMB levels, measured in cryopreserved anticoagulated blood were combined with age in a published statistical model (Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment [ProtecT]) to predict high-grade cancer at biopsy. Predictive accuracy was compared with a base model.  Results and limitations:   The %fPSA was low (median: 17; interquartile range: 13-22) in this cohort because this marker was used as a referral criterion. The ProtecT model improved discrimination over age and PSA for high-grade cancer (0.777 vs 0.720; p=0.002). At one illustrative cut point, use of the panel would reduce the number of biopsies by 236 per 1000 and detect 195 of 208 (94%) but delay diagnosis of 13 of 208 high-grade cancers. MSMB levels in blood did not improve the accuracy of the panel (p=0.2).  Conclusions:   The kallikrein model is predictive of high-grade cancer if criteria for biopsy referral also include %fPSA, and it can reduce unnecessary biopsies without missing an undue number of tumors.

Eligibility criteria were clinical stage T1c and T2a disease; prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/ml; Gleason score <8; and cancer-suspicious regions (CSRs) on multiparametric MRI harboring PCa. CSRs harboring PCa were ablated using a Visualase cooled laser applicator system. Tissue temperature was monitored throughout the ablation cycle by proton resonance frequency shift magnetic resonance thermometry from phase-sensitive images. There were no significant differences between baseline and 3-mo mean American Urological Association Symptom Score or Sexual Health Inventory in Men scores. No man required pads at any time. Overall, the mean PSA decrease between baseline and 3 mo was 2.3 ng/ml (44.2%). Of 28 sites subjected to target biopsy after FLA, 26 (96%) showed no evidence of PCa. Our study provides encouraging evidence that excellent early oncologic control of significant PCa can be achieved following FLA, with virtually no complications or adverse impact on quality of life. Longer follow-up is required to show that oncologic control is durable.  Patient summary:   Early results for focal laser ablation of prostate cancer are very encouraging.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data of 3680 patients who underwent prostate biopsies at a single institution (March 2006 to January 2012). Of 529 men who had Gleason score 6 prostate cancer and were ineligible for active surveillance, 86 (16.3%) underwent transurethral resection of the prostate for symptomatic prostatic enlargement. We assessed how changes in prostate-specific antigen and prostate-specific antigen density influenced the eligibility for active surveillance and the outcome of subsequent therapy. The following active surveillance criteria were used: prostate-specific antigen ≤ 10 ng/ml, prostate-specific antigen density ≤ 0.15, positive cores ≤ 3 and single core involvement ≤ 50%.  Results:   The median age, pre-operative prostate-specific antigen and prostate volume were 71 years, 6.95 ng/ml, and 45.8 g, respectively. In 82.6% (71/86) of analyzed cases, ineligibility for active surveillance had resulted from elevated prostate-specific antigen level or prostate-specific antigen density. With a median resection of 16.5 g, transurethral resection of the prostate reduced the percentage of prostate-specific antigen and the percentage of prostate-specific antigen density by 34.5 and 50.0%, respectively, making 81.7% (58/71) of the patients eligible for active surveillance. Prostate-specific antigen level remained stabilized in all (21/21) patients maintained on active surveillance without disease progression during the median follow-up of 50.6 months. Among patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, 96.7% (29/30) exhibited localized disease.  Conclusions:   Risk-adaptive transurethral resection of the prostate may prevent overtreatment and allay prostate-specific antigen-associated anxiety in patients with biopsy-proven low-grade prostate cancer and elevated prostate-specific antigen.

Additionally, VHEE plans were compared to clinical state-of-the-art volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) photon plans for three cases.  Methods:   VHEE radiotherapy treatment planning was performed by linking EGSnrc Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations with inverse treatment planning in a research version of RayStation. In order to study the effect of VHEE treatment parameters on VHEE dose distributions, a matlab graphical user interface (GUI) for calculation of VHEE MC pencil beam doses was developed. Through the GUI, pediatric case MC simulations were run for a number of beam energies (60, 80, 100, and 120 MeV), number of beams (13, 17, and 36), pencil beam spot (0.1, 1.0, and 3.0 mm) and grid (2.0, 2.5, and 3.5 mm) sizes, and source-to-axis distance, SAD (40 and 50 cm). VHEE plans for the pediatric case calculated with the different treatment parameters were optimized and compared. Furthermore, 100 MeV VHEE plans for the pediatric case, a lung, and a prostate case were calculated and compared to the clinically delivered VMAT plans. All plans were normalized such that the 100% isodose line covered 95% of the target volume.  Results:   VHEE beam energy had the largest effect on the quality of dose distributions of the pediatric case. For the same target dose, the mean doses to organs at risk (OARs) decreased by 5%-16% when planned with 100 MeV compared to 60 MeV, but there was no further improvement in the 120 MeV plan. VHEE plans calculated with 36 beams outperformed plans calculated with 13 and 17 beams, but to a more modest degree (<8%). While pencil beam spacing and SAD had a small effect on VHEE dose distributions, 0.1-3 mm pencil beam sizes resulted in identical dose distributions. For the 100 MeV VHEE pediatric plan, OAR doses were up to 70% lower and the integral dose was 33% lower for VHEE compared to 6 MV VMAT. Additionally, VHEE conformity indices (CI100 = 1.09 and CI50 = 4.07) were better than VMAT conformity indices (CI100 = 1.30 and CI50 = 6.81). The 100 MeV VHEE lung plan resulted in mean dose decrease to all OARs by up to 27% for the same target coverage compared to the clinical 6 MV flattening filter-free (FFF) VMAT plan. The 100 MeV prostate plan resulted in 3% mean dose increase to the penile bulb and the urethra, but all other OAR mean doses were lower compared to the 15 MV VMAT plan. The lung case CI100 and CI50 conformity indices were 3% and 8% lower, respectively, in the VHEE plan compared to the VMAT plan. The prostate case CI100 and CI50 conformity indices were 1% higher and 8% lower, respectively, in the VHEE plan compared to the VMAT plan.  Conclusions:   The authors have developed a treatment planning workflow for MC dose calculation of pencil beams and optimization for treatment planning of VHEE radiotherapy. The authors have demonstrated that VHEE plans resulted in similar or superior dose distributions for pediatric, lung, and prostate cases compared to clinical VMAT plans.""","""['Magdalena Bazalova-Carter', 'Bradley Qu', 'Bianey Palma', 'Björn Hårdemark', 'Elin Hynning', 'Christopher Jensen', 'Peter G Maxim', 'Billy W Loo Jr']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Very high-energy electron (VHEE) beams in radiation therapy; Treatment plan comparison between VHEE, VMAT, and PPBS.', 'Assessment of the quality of very high-energy electron radiotherapy planning.', 'Improvement of conformal arc plans by using deformable margin delineation method for stereotactic lung radiotherapy.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'A potential revolution in cancer treatment: A topical review of FLASH radiotherapy.', 'Deep Seated Tumour Treatments With Electrons of High Energy Delivered at FLASH Rates: The Example of Prostate Cancer.', 'Ultra-high dose rate electron beams and the FLASH effect: From preclinical evidence to a new radiotherapy paradigm.', 'Treatment Planning System for Electron FLASH Radiation Therapy: Open-Source for Clinical Implementation.', 'Back to the Future: Very High-Energy Electrons (VHEEs) and Their Potential Application in Radiation Therapy.']"""

To this end, the authors propose an online update scheme for landmark-guided prostate segmentation, which can fully exploit valuable patient-specific information contained in the previous treatment images and can achieve improved performance in landmark detection and prostate segmentation.  Methods:   To localize the prostate in the daily treatment images, the authors first automatically detect six anatomical landmarks on the prostate boundary by adopting a context-aware landmark detection method. Specifically, in this method, a two-layer regression forest is trained as a detector for each target landmark. Once all the newly detected landmarks from new treatment images are reviewed or adjusted (if necessary) by clinicians, they are further included into the training pool as new patient-specific information to update all the two-layer regression forests for the next treatment day. As more and more treatment images of the current patient are acquired, the two-layer regression forests can be continually updated by incorporating the patient-specific information into the training procedure. After all target landmarks are detected, a multiatlas random sample consensus (multiatlas RANSAC) method is used to segment the entire prostate by fusing multiple previously segmented prostates of the current patient after they are aligned to the current treatment image. Subsequently, the segmented prostate of the current treatment image is again reviewed (or even adjusted if needed) by clinicians before including it as a new shape example into the prostate shape dataset for helping localize the entire prostate in the next treatment image.  Results:   The experimental results on 330 images of 24 patients show the effectiveness of the authors' proposed online update scheme in improving the accuracies of both landmark detection and prostate segmentation. Besides, compared to the other state-of-the-art prostate segmentation methods, the authors' method achieves the best performance.

A tumor visible on MR images can be projected on ultrasound (US) by using MR-US registration. A common approach is to use surface-based registration. The authors hypothesize that biomechanical modeling will better control deformation inside the prostate than a regular nonrigid surface-based registration method. The authors developed a novel method by extending a nonrigid surface-based registration algorithm with biomechanical finite element (FE) modeling to better predict internal deformations of the prostate.  Methods:   Data were collected from ten patients and the MR and TRUS images were rigidly registered to anatomically align prostate orientations. The prostate was manually segmented in both images and corresponding surface meshes were generated. Next, a tetrahedral volume mesh was generated from the MR image. Prostate deformations due to the TRUS probe were simulated using the surface displacements as the boundary condition. A three-dimensional thin-plate spline deformation field was calculated by registering the mesh vertices. The target registration errors (TREs) of 35 reference landmarks determined by surface and volume mesh registrations were compared.  Results:   The median TRE of a surface-based registration with biomechanical regularization was 2.76 (0.81-7.96) mm. This was significantly different than the median TRE of 3.47 (1.05-7.80) mm for regular surface-based registration without biomechanical regularization.  Conclusions:   Biomechanical FE modeling has the potential to improve the accuracy of multimodal prostate registration when comparing it to a regular nonrigid surface-based registration algorithm and can help to improve the effectiveness of MR guided TRUS biopsy procedures.""","""['Wendy J M van de Ven', 'Yipeng Hu', 'Jelle O Barentsz', 'Nico Karssemeijer', 'Dean Barratt', 'Henkjan J Huisman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', '2D-3D rigid registration to compensate for prostate motion during 3D TRUS-guided biopsy.', 'Learning Non-rigid Deformations for Robust, Constrained Point-based Registration in Image-Guided MR-TRUS Prostate Intervention.', 'Integrated US-MR fusion images and MR targeted biopsies.

Methods:   The proposed system utilizes two MRI sequences [T2-weighted MRI and high-b-value (b = 2000 s/mm(2)) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)] and texture features based on local binary patterns. A three-stage feature selection method is employed to provide the most discriminative features. The authors included a total of 244 patients. Training the CAD system on 108 patients (78 MR-positive prostate cancers and 105 benign MR-positive lesions), two validation studies were retrospectively performed on 136 patients (68 MR-positive prostate cancers, 111 benign MR-positive lesions, and 117 MR-negative benign lesions).  Results:   In distinguishing cancer from MR-positive benign lesions, an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76-0.89] was achieved. For cancer vs MR-positive or MR-negative benign lesions, the authors obtained an AUC of 0.89 AUC (95% CI: 0.84-0.93). The performance of the CAD system was not dependent on the specific regions of the prostate, e.g., a peripheral zone or transition zone. Moreover, the CAD system outperformed other combinations of MRI sequences: T2W MRI, high-b-value DWI, and the standard apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map of DWI.

However, little is known about the functions of SSEA-4 and the characteristics of SSEA-4 expressing tumor cells. Our studies identified SSEA-4 expression on a subpopulation of cells in many solid tumor cell lines but not in leukemic cell lines. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting-sorted SSEA-4(+) prostate cancer cells formed fibroblast-like colonies with limited cell-cell contacts, whereas SSEA-4(-) cells formed cobblestone-like epithelial colonies. Only colonies derived from SSEA-4(+) cells were enriched for pluripotent embryonic stem cell markers. Moreover, major epithelial cell-associated markers Claudin-7, E-cadherin, ESRP1 and GRHL2 were down-regulated in the SSEA-4(+) fraction of DU145 and HCT-116 cells. Similar to cell lines, SSEA-4(+) primary prostate tumor cells also showed down-regulation of epithelial cell-associated markers. In addition, they showed up-regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as well as mesenchymal markers. Furthermore, SSEA-4(+) cells escape from adhesive colonies spontaneously and form invadopodia-like migratory structures, in which SSEA-4, cortactin as well as active pPI3K, pAkt and pSrc are enriched and colocalized. Finally, SSEA-4(+) cells displayed strong tumorigenic ability and stable knockdown of SSEA-4 synthesis resulted in decreased cellular adhesion to different extracellular matrices. In conclusion, we introduce SSEA-4 as a novel marker to identify heterogeneous, invasive subpopulations of tumor cells.

The Mn(2+)-doped NaYF4:Yb,Er upconversion luminescence nanorods with an emission peak located in the red region were synthesized. The presence of Mn(2+) markedly increased the luminescence intensity over that of the NaYF4:Yb, Er upconversion nanomaterials (excited by a 980 nm continuous wavelength laser). The surfaces of Mn(2+)-doped NaYF4:Yb, Er upconversion nanorods were modified with poly(acrylic acid). Antibodies against prostate specific antigen were bound to the surface of the carboxyl-functionalized upconversion nanorods, which acted as the energy donor in this LET system. Gold nanorods with an absorption band at ~666 nm were synthesized by the seed growth method, acted as the energy acceptor. The emission band of the upconversion nanorods overlapped well with the absorption band of the gold nanorods. The luminescence was quenched because of the electrostatic interactions that shortened the distance between the donor (negatively charged) and the accepter (positively charged).When the PSA antigen was added into the system, the energy acceptor and the energy donors were separated because the binding affinity between PSA and anti-PSA was greater than the electrostatic interactions, and thereby the luminescence was recovered. The linear range of detecting PSA was from 0.1172 to 18.75 ng/mL (R=0.995), with a limit of detection for PSA as low as 0.1129 ng/mL.

In this study, we examined whether antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, could inhibit ABCB1 activity and overcome resistance to docetaxel.  Experimental design:   ABCB1 efflux activity was determined using a rhodamine efflux assay. ABCB1 ATPase activity was determined by Pgp-Glo assay systems. The effects of the antiandrogens bicalutamide and enzalutamide on docetaxel sensitivity were determined by cell growth assays and tumor growth in vivo.  Results:   We found that bicalutamide and enzalutamide inhibit ABCB1 ATP-binding cassette transporter activity through blocking ABCB1 efflux activity. Bicalutamide inhibited ABCB1 efflux activity by 40%, whereas enzalutamide inhibited ABCB1 efflux activity by approximately 60%. Both bicalutamide and enzalutamide inhibit ABCB1 ATPase activity. In addition, bicalutamide and enzalutamide inhibit ABCB1 efflux activity and desensitize docetaxel-resistant and androgen receptor (AR)-negative DU145 cells. Combination of bicalutamide with docetaxel had a significant antitumor effect in both AR-positive and AR-negative docetaxel-resistant xenograft models, suggesting that bicalutamide desensitizes docetaxel-resistant cells to docetaxel treatment independent of AR status.  Conclusions:   We identified a novel mechanism of action for antiandrogens such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide as inhibitors of ABCB1 efflux and ATPase activity. Bicalutamide and enzalutamide desensitize docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells to docetaxel treatment independent of AR status. These studies may lead to the development of combinational therapies with bicalutamide/enzalutamide and docetaxel as effective regimens to treat advanced prostate cancer independent of AR status, and possibly other types of cancer.""","""['Yezi Zhu', 'Chengfei Liu', 'Cameron Armstrong', 'Wei Lou', 'Amandeep Sandher', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: Antiandrogens reverse docetaxel resistance via ABCB1 inhibition.', 'Niclosamide and Bicalutamide Combination Treatment Overcomes Enzalutamide- and Bicalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'ABCB1 Mediates Cabazitaxel-Docetaxel Cross-Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Marked response to cabazitaxel in prostate cancer xenografts expressing androgen receptor variant 7 and reversion of acquired resistance by anti-androgens.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Non-Steroidal Androgen Receptor Antagonists and Prostate Cancer: A Survey on Chemical Structures Binding this Fast-Mutating Target.', 'Comprehensive Evaluation of Multiple Approaches Targeting ABCB1 to Resensitize Docetaxel-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Interleukin-30 suppresses IGF1 and CXCL5 and boosts SOCS3 reducing prostate cancer growth and mortality.', 'H1.0 induces paclitaxel-resistance genes expression in ovarian cancer cells by recruiting GCN5 and androgen receptor.', 'Understanding Drug Sensitivity and Tackling Resistance in Cancer.', 'Activation of the ABCB1 Amplicon in Docetaxel- and Cabazitaxel-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

This association may be modulated by dietary fiber intake, which has been shown to decrease steroid hormone bioavailability (decreased blood concentration and increased sex hormone-binding globulin concentration). However, this potential modulation has not been investigated in any prospective cohort.  Objectives:   Our objectives were to study the relation between alcohol intake and the risk of hormone-dependent cancers (breast, prostate, ovarian, endometrial, and testicular) and to investigate whether dietary fiber intake modulated these associations.  Design:   This prospective observational analysis included 3771 women and 2771 men who participated in the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants study (1994-2007) and completed at least 6 valid 24-h dietary records during the first 2 y of follow-up. After a median follow-up of 12.1 y, 297 incident hormone-dependent cancer cases, including 158 breast and 123 prostate cancers, were diagnosed. Associations were tested via multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   Overall, alcohol intake was directly associated with the risk of hormone-dependent cancers (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.84; P-trend = 0.02) and breast cancer (HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.61; P-trend = 0.04) but not prostate cancer (P-trend = 0.3). In stratified analyses (by sex-specific median of dietary fiber intake), alcohol intake was directly associated with hormone-dependent cancer (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: HR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.82; P-trend = 0.002), breast cancer (HR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.30, 4.95; P-trend = 0.02), and prostate cancer (HR: 1.37; 95% CI: 0.65, 2.89; P-trend = 0.02) risk among individuals with low dietary fiber intake but not among their counterparts with higher dietary fiber intake (P-trend = 0.9, 0.8, and 0.6, respectively). The P-interaction between alcohol and dietary fiber intake was statistically significant for prostate cancer (P = 0.01) but not for overall hormone-dependent (P = 0.2) or breast (P = 0.9) cancer.

Distinguishing indolent from aggressive prostate cancer is a major challenge in disease management. Associations between SBP1 levels, tumor grade, and disease recurrence following prostatectomy were investigated by duplex immunofluorescence imaging using a tissue microarray containing tissue from 202 prostate cancer patients who experienced biochemical (PSA) recurrence after prostatectomy and 202 matched control patients whose cancer did not recur. Samples were matched by age, ethnicity, pathological stage and Gleason grade, and images were quantified using the Vectra multispectral imaging system. Fluorescent labels were targeted for SBP1 and cytokeratins 8/18 to restrict scoring to tumor cells, and cell-by-cell quantification of SBP1 in the nucleus and cytoplasm was performed. Nuclear SBP1 levels and the nuclear to cytoplasm ratio were inversely associated with tumor grade using linear regression analysis. Following classification of samples into quartiles based on the SBP1 levels among controls, tumors in the lowest quartile were more than twice as likely to recur compared to those in any other quartile. Inducible ectopic SBP1 expression reduced the ability of HCT-116 human tumor cells to grow in soft agar, a measure of transformation, without affecting proliferation. Cells expressing SBP1 also demonstrated a robust induction in the phosphorylation of the p53 tumor suppressor at serine 15. These data indicate that loss of SBP1 may play an independent contributing role in prostate cancer progression and its levels might be useful in distinguishing indolent from aggressive disease.""","""['Emmanuel Ansong', 'Qi Ying', 'Dede N Ekoue', 'Ryan Deaton', 'Andrew R Hall', 'Andre Kajdacsy-Balla', 'Wancai Yang', 'Peter H Gann', 'Alan M Diamond']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Selenium-binding protein 1 alters energy metabolism in prostate cancer cells.', 'Selenium-Binding Protein 1 in Human Health and Disease.', 'Inverse association between glutathione peroxidase activity and both selenium-binding protein 1 levels and Gleason score in human prostate tissue.', 'Downregulation of selenium-binding protein 1 is associated with poor prognosis in lung squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Selenoproteins of the Human Prostate: Unusual Properties and Role in Cancer Etiology.', 'Exploration of Malignant Characteristics in Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy-Resistant Rectal Cancer, Focusing on Extramural Lesions.', 'Evolutionary Aspects of Selenium Binding Protein (SBP).', 'The role of SELENBP1 and its epigenetic regulation in carcinogenic progression.', 'Multiplex Tissue Imaging: Spatial Revelations in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'A transcriptomic signature for prostate cancer relapse prediction identified from the differentially expressed genes between TP53 mutant and wild-type tumors.']"""

Here, we explored whether PLX3397, a high-affinity small molecular antagonist that binds to and inhibits phosphorylation of colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor, the tyrosine-protein kinase c-Kit, and the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3, can reduce CIBP. These 3 targets all regulate the proliferation and function of a subset of the myeloid cells including macrophages, osteoclasts, and mast cells. Preliminary experiments show that PLX3397 attenuated inflammatory pain after formalin injection into the hind paw of the rat. As there is an inflammatory component in CIBP, involving macrophages and osteoclasts, the effect of PLX3397 was explored in a prostate model of CIBP where skeletal pain, cancer cell proliferation, tumor metastasis, and bone remodeling could be monitored in the same animal.

Earlier attempts at multitargeted strategies with the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy to ADT did not affect survival. As more effective therapies are emerging, including cytotoxic therapy for patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), there is increasing interest for testing these drugs earlier in the disease course. The premise is that agents with clinical benefit in advanced mCRPC may have a better effect if used preemptively before the development of significant resistance and to attack earlier de novo androgen resistant/independent clones. The recent results of the phase III clinical trial E3805 investigating ADT with or without docetaxel in mHSPC provide compelling support for this strategy. Docetaxel combined with ADT significantly improved overall survival from 44 to 57.6 months (p=0.0003), particularly in patients with high-volume disease (from 32.2 to 49.2 months; p=0.0006).

Yet, a classifier selected at the start of the trial based on smaller and more accessible datasets may yield inaccurate and unstable classification performance. In this paper, we aim to address two common concerns in classifier selection for clinical trials: (1) predicting expected classifier performance for large datasets based on error rates calculated from smaller datasets and (2) the selection of appropriate classifiers based on expected performance for larger datasets. We present a framework for comparative evaluation of classifiers using only limited amounts of training data by using random repeated sampling (RRS) in conjunction with a cross-validation sampling strategy. Extrapolated error rates are subsequently validated via comparison with leave-one-out cross-validation performed on a larger dataset. The ability to predict error rates as dataset size increases is demonstrated on both synthetic data as well as three different computational imaging tasks: detecting cancerous image regions in prostate histopathology, differentiating high and low grade cancer in breast histopathology, and detecting cancerous metavoxels in prostate magnetic resonance spectroscopy. For each task, the relationships between 3 distinct classifiers (k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine) are explored. Further quantitative evaluation in terms of interquartile range (IQR) suggests that our approach consistently yields error rates with lower variability (mean IQRs of 0.0070, 0.0127, and 0.0140) than a traditional RRS approach (mean IQRs of 0.0297, 0.0779, and 0.305) that does not employ cross-validation sampling for all three datasets.""","""['Ajay Basavanhally', 'Satish Viswanath', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Comparing radiomic classifiers and classifier ensembles for detection of peripheral zone prostate tumors on T2-weighted MRI: a multi-site study.', 'Improving the Accuracy of Computer-aided Diagnosis for Breast MR Imaging by Differentiating between Mass and Nonmass Lesions.', 'Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Evaluate Performance of a Classifier for Automatic Grading of Prostate Cancer From Digitized Histopathologic Images.', 'Reviewing ensemble classification methods in breast cancer.', 'An active learning based classification strategy for the minority class problem: application to histopathology annotation.', 'Real-time high-resolution millimeter-wave imaging for in-vivo skin cancer diagnosis.', 'Optical Radiomic Signatures Derived from Optical Coherence Tomography Images Improve Identification of Melanoma.', 'Breast MRI radiomics: comparison of computer- and human-extracted imaging phenotypes.', 'Omni-PolyA: a method and tool for accurate recognition of Poly(A) signals in human genomic DNA.', 'Multi-Pass Adaptive Voting for Nuclei Detection in Histopathological Images.']"""

Immediate continence was defined as no pad usage after catheter removal. Evaluated parameters included age, body mass index, ECOG performance status, erectile function, prostate volume, PSA, Gleason score, tumor stage and D'Amico risk groups, as well as surgical approach (RRP, RARP), surgeon volume, nerve-sparing, lymphadenectomy, blood transfusions and duration of catheterization.  Results:   A total of 240 men (15.5 %) did not require any pads 1 day or later after removal of the transurethral catheter. Correlation of parameters with immediate continence revealed significance for age (p < 0.001), ECOG-score (p = 0.025), erectile function (p = 0.001), nerve-sparing (p = 0.022), Gleason score (p = 0.002) and surgeon volume (p ≤ 0.022).

Methods:   One hundred and forty-seven patients underwent T2- weighted (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted prostate MRI. Cancers ≥0.5 ml and non-cancerous peripheral (PZ) and transition (TZ) zone tissue were identified on T2WI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, using whole-mount pathology as reference. Texture features (Energy, Entropy, Correlation, Homogeneity, Inertia) were extracted and analysed using generalized estimating equations.  Results:   PZ cancers (n = 143) showed higher Entropy and Inertia and lower Energy, Correlation and Homogeneity compared to non-cancerous tissue on T2WI and ADC maps (p-values: <.0001-0.008). In TZ cancers (n = 43) we observed significant differences for all five texture features on the ADC map (all p-values: <.0001) and for Correlation (p = 0.041) and Inertia (p = 0.001) on T2WI. On ADC maps, GS was associated with higher Entropy (GS 6 vs. 7: p = 0.0225; 6 vs. >7: p = 0.0069) and lower Energy (GS 6 vs. 7: p = 0.0116, 6 vs. >7: p = 0.0039). ADC map Energy (p = 0.0102) and Entropy (p = 0.0019) were significantly different in GS ≤3 + 4 versus ≥4 + 3 cancers; ADC map Entropy remained significant after controlling for the median ADC (p = 0.0291).  Conclusion:   Several Haralick-based texture features appear useful for prostate cancer detection and GS assessment.  Key points:   • Several Haralick texture features may differentiate non-cancerous and cancerous prostate tissue. • Tumour Energy and Entropy on ADC maps correlate with Gleason score. • T2w-image-derived texture features are not associated with the Gleason score.""","""['Andreas Wibmer', 'Hedvig Hricak', 'Tatsuo Gondo', 'Kazuhiro Matsumoto', 'Harini Veeraraghavan', 'Duc Fehr', 'Junting Zheng', 'Debra Goldman', 'Chaya Moskowitz', 'Samson W Fine', 'Victor E Reuter', 'James Eastham', 'Evis Sala', 'Hebert Alberto Vargas']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['T2-weighted MRI-derived textural features reflect prostate cancer aggressiveness: preliminary results.', 'Whole-Tumor Quantitative Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Histogram and Texture Analysis to Predict Gleason Score Upgrading in Intermediate-Risk 3 + 4 = 7 Prostate Cancer.', 'ADC Metrics From Multiparametric MRI: Histologic Downgrading of Gleason Score 9 or 10 Prostate Cancers Diagnosed at Nontargeted Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Correlation between ADC values and Gleason score in evaluation of prostate cancer: multicentre experience and review of the literature.', 'Texture analysis of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for differentiating clinically significant prostate cancer in the peripheral zone.', 'Multi-view radiomics and deep learning modeling for prostate cancer detection based on multi-parametric MRI.', 'MRI-based nomograms and radiomics in presurgical prediction of extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Textural Features of MR Images Correlate with an Increased Risk of Clinically Significant Cancer in Patients with High PSA Levels.', 'Radiomics-informed Deep Curriculum Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis.']"""

The tie-in between the intake of genistein and the decreased incidence of some solid tumors (including prostate cancer) has been demonstrated by epidemiological studies. The potential of genistein in treating prostate cancer has also been displayed by in vitro cell-based and in vivo animal experiments. Genistein has entered clinical trials for both chemoprevention and potential treatment of prostate cancer. Even though the low oral bioavailability has presented the major challenges to genistein's further clinical development, chemical modulation of genistein holds the promise to generate potential anti-prostate cancer agents with enhanced potency and/or better pharmacokinetic profiles than genistein. As part of our ongoing project to develop natural products-based anti-prostate cancer agents, the current study was undertaken to synthesize eight genistein analogues for cytotoxic evaluation in three prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP; both androgen-sensitive and androgen-refractory cell lines), as well as one aggressive cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). Eight genistein analogues have been successfully synthesized with Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction as a key step. Their in vitro anti-cancer potential was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay and WST-1 cell proliferation assay against a panel of four human cancer cell lines. The acquired data suggest i) that the C-5 and C-7 hydroxyl groups in genistein are very important for the cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative activity; and ii) that 1-alkyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl and pyridine-3-yl might act as good bioisosteres for the 4'-hydroxyphenyl moiety in genistein.""","""['Pahoua Xiong', 'Rubing Wang', 'Xiaojie Zhang', 'Eduardo DeLa Torre', 'Francisco Leon', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Shilong Zheng', 'Guangdi Wang', 'Qiao-Hong Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['A new class of flavonol-based anti-prostate cancer agents: Design, synthesis, and evaluation in cell models.', 'A new class of hybrid anticancer agents inspired by the synergistic effects of curcumin and genistein: Design, synthesis, and anti-proliferative evaluation.', 'Silibinin derivatives as anti-prostate cancer agents: Synthesis and cell-based evaluations.', 'Genistein and its synthetic analogs as anticancer agents.', 'Therapeutic potentials of genistein: New insights and perspectives.', 'Interventions on soy isoflavone molecules to improve their therapeutic potential for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Genistein anticancer efficacy during induced oral squamous cell carcinoma: an experimental study.', 'A Mini-Review of Flavone Isomers Apigenin and Genistein in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Anti-Cancer and Electrochemical Properties of Thiogenistein-New Biologically Active Compound.', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans in Viral Infection and Treatment: A Special Focus on SARS-CoV-2.']"""

Cell cycle-regulated genes may be more highly expressed in actively dividing cells, with transcript levels reflecting tumor growth rate. Here, we evaluated expression of cell cycle genes in relation to PCa outcomes in a population-based cohort.  Methods:   Gene expression data were generated from tumor tissues obtained at radical prostatectomy for 383 population-based patients (12.3-years average follow-up). The overall mean and individual transcript levels of 30 selected cell cycle genes was compared between patients with no evidence of recurrence (73%) and those who recurred (27%) or died (7%) from PCa.  Results:   The multivariate adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for a change from the 25th to 75th percentile of mean gene expression level (range 8.02-10.05) was 1.25 (95%CI 0.96-1.63; P = 0.10) for PCa recurrence risk, and did not vary substantially by Gleason score, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion status, or family history of PCa. For lethal PCa, the HR for a change (25th to 75th percentile) in mean gene expression level was 2.04 (95%CI 1.26-3.31; P = 0.004), adjusted for clinicopathological variables. The ROC curve for mean gene expression level alone (AUC = 0.740) did not perform as well as clinicopathological variables alone (AUC = 0.803) for predicting lethal PCa, and the addition of mean gene expression to clinicopathological variables did not substantially improve prediction (AUC = 0.827; P = 0.18). Higher TK1 expression was strongly associated with both recurrent (P = 6.7 × 10(-5)) and lethal (P = 6.4 × 10(-6)) PCa.  Conclusions:   Mean expression level for 30 selected cell cycle-regulated genes was unrelated to recurrence risk, but was associated with a twofold increase in risk of lethal PCa. However, gene expression had less discriminatory accuracy than clinical variables alone for predicting lethal events. Transcript levels for several genes in the panel were significantly overexpressed in lethal versus non-recurrent PCa.""","""['Rohina Rubicz', 'Shanshan Zhao', 'Craig April', 'Jonathan L Wright', 'Suzanne Kolb', 'Ilsa Coleman', 'Daniel W Lin', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Elaine A Ostrander', 'Ziding Feng', 'Jian-Bing Fan', 'Janet L Stanford']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Epigenetic signature of Gleason score and prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Gene expression signature of Gleason score is associated with prostate cancer outcomes in a radical prostatectomy cohort.', 'A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Value of the Cell Cycle Progression Score in Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Global DNA hypomethylation in prostate cancer development and progression: a systematic review.', 'The Transcriptomic Profiles of ESR1 and MMP3 Stratify the Risk of Biochemical Recurrence in Primary Prostate Cancer beyond Clinical Features.', 'Age- and Stage-Dependent Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness Associated with Differential Notch Signaling.', 'Carcinogenic effect of adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) in prostate cancer development and progression through the cell cycle pathway.', 'Expression of 5-methylcytosine regulators is highly associated with the clinical phenotypes of prostate cancer and DNMTs expression predicts biochemical recurrence.', 'Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetases 2 knockdown inhibits prostate cancer progression by suppressing cell cycle and inducing cell apoptosis.']"""

Investigating public interest in stratified screening and its acceptability to the public is therefore essential since as yet little is known.  Method:   Cross-sectional web survey sent to a sample of 10 000 individuals (20-74 years of age) representative of the Swedish population as registered in 2009.  Results:   Among the responders (28%), a vast majority (94%) expressed an interest in knowing their breast or prostate cancer risk and stated wanting to know to 'avoid worrying'. Men and women were equally interested in knowing their prostate and breast cancer risk, respectively. However, men showed more certainty. Trusting the healthcare workers with personal information (63%) as well as genetic information (70%), in order to calculate the risk, did not seem to be a major issue. Furthermore, 87% would agree to get screened more often if identified with a high risk, whereas, if identified with a low risk, only 27% would agree to get screened less often. Finally, although a consultation with a physician seemed to be the preferred way to communicate the risk, a majority would agree to receive it via a letter or a phone call.  Conclusion:   Risk-stratified screening has the possibility to be accepted by the general public.

We attempted to study this issue by analogy by comparing the long-term post-prostatectomy survival of patients with cT3 disease versus cT1/T2 disease upstaged to pathologic T3 disease.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify 60,165 men diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma between 1995 and 2002 who underwent prostatectomy. Prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) was evaluated by stage after adjusting for grade, marital status, race, sex, year of diagnosis, and age.  Results:   The median follow-up was 10.5 years. Patients with cT1/T2 but pathologic T3a disease had significantly better 10-year PCSM than men with cT3 disease had (3.0% vs. 9.9%, adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 0.420, P<0.001), but they had worse PCSM than men with pathologic T2 disease had (3.0% vs. 0.91%, AHR = 2.53, P<0.001). Of patients with occult T3a disease, those with low-grade/intermediate-grade disease (Gleason score 7 or less) had a slightly higher 10-year PCSM when compared with those with pathologic T2 disease (1.34% vs. 0.91%, AHR = 1.69, P<0.001). Patients with cT1/T2 and pathologic T3b disease had similar PCSM as men presenting with cT3 disease (11.0% vs. 9.86%, AHR = 1.14 [0.862, 1.52], P = 0.353).  Conclusions:   Patients with occult T3a disease had less than half the risk of PCSM as those with cT3 disease, and a subset of those men had similar risk as patients with pathologic T2 disease.

We detected its role in prostate cancer for possibility of target therapy as accumulating evidence has shown that CMTM3 is a promising tumor suppressor gene (TSG) for gene therapy.  Methods:   The expression of CMTM3 detected in prostate tissue microarray, specimens and cell lines were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. After being transfected with CMTM3 adenovirus or vector (mock), the proliferation and migration and invasion of LNCaP cells were detected by transwell assay and matrigel assay, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of CMTM3 on tumor growth were performed in nude mice xenograft in vivo.  Results:   We found CMTM3 was reduced in PCa tissues and cells compared with BPH tissues, and its expression in PCa tissues was related to the Gleason score. Moreover, after being transfected with adenovirus, ectopic expression of CMTM3 in LNCaP cells led to significant inhibition of cell proliferation and migration and invasion compared with the control (P < 0.05), which may be attributed to decreased Erk1/2 activity as p-Erk1/2 was remarkably reduced when CMTM3 was overexpressed.

Our results showed that INK-128 exerted potent anti-proliferative activity in established (PC-3 and LNCaP lines) and primary (patient-derived) human prostate cancer cells by inducing cell apoptosis. The latter was evidenced by increase of annexin V percentage, formation of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, and cleavage of caspase-3. INK-128-induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis and cytotoxicity were alleviated upon pretreatment of cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK or the specific caspase-3 inhibitor z-DVED-FMK. At the molecular level, INK-18 blocked mTORC1/2 activation in PC-3 cells and LNCaP cells and downregulated mTOR-regulated genes including cyclin D1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), and HIF-2α.

Introduction:   ADT using gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or orchiectomy is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis or fracture. To investigate the effects of ADT duration or orchiectomy on any type of fracture in Asian patients with prostate cancer, we conducted this retrospective analysis using a nationwide database in Taiwan.  Methods:   We included 17,359 subjects who were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2007. The risk of first fracture was our primary endpoint.  Results:   The rates of fracture from 12 months after prostate cancer diagnosis until the last follow-up date were 8.7 % for all patients, 7.1 % for patients who did not receive ADT or orchiectomy, 9.8 % for patients who received ADT, and 14.4 % for patients who received orchiectomy with or without ADT (P < 0.0001). In a Cox proportional hazard analysis, the relative risk of fracture increased steadily with the number of doses of GnRH agonists received during the first year after cancer diagnosis and with dose density. A significant hazard ratio was observed in patients who received at least nine doses within 1 year after diagnosis and in those whose dose density exceeded two doses per year. Age greater than or equal to 65 years was associated with a significantly lower risk of fracture.

Methods:   Six-hundred forty-nine patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer who received PADT from 1998 to 2005 by Nara Uro-Oncology Research Group were enrolled. Age, T classification, stage, PSA level at diagnosis, Gleason score, laterality of cancer detected by biopsy and seminal vesicle involvement (SVI) were adopted as parameters of PSA progression. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to determine the predictive factors for PSA progression.  Results:   The median follow-up period and the median PSA level at diagnosis were 49 months and 15 ng/mL. The 5-year disease specific survival rate, overall survival rate and PSA progression-free survival (PFS) rate were 97.9 %, 91.9 % and 71.2 %, respectively. The univariate analysis showed that the PSA level at diagnosis, Gleason score, laterality of cancer detected by biopsy and SVI were independent predictive parameters of PSA-PFS. However, by multivariate analysis, only laterality of cancer detected by biopsy (unilateral vs. bilateral) was an independent predictive parameter of PSA-PFS (p = 0.034). The patients were classified into new risk groups base on three factors: PSA level at diagnosis, Gleason score, and laterality of cancer detected by biopsy. The PSA-PFS rates at 5-years in the low- (none or one factor), intermediate- (two factors) and high-risk (three factors) groups were 78.2 %, 62.5 % and 46.9 % (p < 0.001), respectively.

PSPIO was prepared by modifying SPIO with redox-sensitive polyethylenimine (SSPEI) via a ligand exchange process. PSPIO could efficiently condense plasmid DNA (pDNA) into nanoparticles, which exhibited several favorable properties for gene delivery, including protection of nucleic acids from enzymatic degradation, stable colloids in serum, and redox-responsive pDNA release. As a potential MR imaging agent, PSPIO displayed good magnetization (28.3 emu/g) and dose-dependent T2-weighted imaging contrast (R2 = 291.1 s(-1) mM(-1)) in vitro. The use of redox-sensitive SSPEI polymer contributed to much lower cytotoxicity of PSPIO compared to nondegradable bPEI25k. In vitro transfection efficiency of PSPIO was significantly enhanced under an external magnetic field. In the presence of serum, PSPIO exhibited higher transgene expression than SSPEI or bPEI25k polymer on mouse glioma (ALTS1C1) or human prostate cancer (PC3) cell lines.

The objective of this study was to challenge these notions and show via a case study concerning risk-based screening for prostate cancer how calculators can be dynamically and locally tailored to improve on-site patient accuracy. Yearly data from five international prostate biopsy cohorts (3 in the US, 1 in Austria, 1 in England) were used to compare 6 methods for annual risk prediction: static use of the online US-developed Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator (PCPTRC); recalibration of the PCPTRC; revision of the PCPTRC; building a new model each year using logistic regression, Bayesian prior-to-posterior updating, or random forests. All methods performed similarly with respect to discrimination, except for random forests, which were worse. All methods except for random forests greatly improved calibration over the static PCPTRC in all cohorts except for Austria, where the PCPTRC had the best calibration followed closely by recalibration. The case study shows that a simple annual recalibration of a general online risk tool for prostate cancer can improve its accuracy with respect to the local patient practice at hand.""","""['Andreas N Strobl', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Ben Van Calster', 'Ewout Steyerberg', 'Robin J Leach', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Donna P Ankerst']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biomed Inform""","""['Evaluating the PCPT risk calculator in ten international biopsy cohorts: results from the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group.', 'The impact of prostate volume, number of biopsy cores and American Urological Association symptom score on the sensitivity of cancer detection using the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator.', 'Incorporation of Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 and TMPRSS2:ERG into Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator.', 'Methods for updating a risk prediction model for cardiac surgery: a statistical primer.', 'Prostate Cancer Risk Calculators for Healthy Populations: Systematic Review.', 'Comparison of Rotterdam and Barcelona Magnetic Resonance Imaging Risk Calculators for Predicting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'EHR foundation models improve robustness in the presence of temporal distribution shift.', 'A Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Predictive Model Using Digital Rectal Examination Prostate Volume Category to Stratify Initial Prostate Cancer Suspicion and Reduce Magnetic Resonance Imaging Demand.', 'External Validation of the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group Risk Calculator and the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in a Swedish Population-based Screening Cohort.', 'Clinical artificial intelligence quality improvement: towards continual monitoring and updating of AI algorithms in healthcare.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 302 men on active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer (T1c-T2a), Gleason 6 or less, 3 or fewer positive cores, 50% or less of any core involved and prostate specific antigen 11 ng/ml or less in the REduction by Dutasteride of clinical progression Events in Expectant Management (REDEEM) study. Patients underwent study mandated biopsies 18 and 36 months after enrollment. Disease progression was divided into pathological (4 or greater positive cores, 50% or greater core involvement, or Gleason greater than 6 on followup biopsy), therapeutic (any therapeutic prostate cancer intervention) or clinical (pathological or therapeutic progression). Time to disease progression was analyzed with Cox models adjusting for patient age, race, baseline prostate specific antigen, number of sampled and involved cores, tumor length and treatment.  Results:   A total of 11 patients (4%) had perineural invasion on baseline biopsy. Perineural invasion was not associated with any baseline features (each p >0.05). During the study clinical progression developed in 125 patients (41%), including pathological progression in 95. One, 2 and 3-year clinical progression-free survival for men with vs without perineural invasion was 82%, 27% and 27% vs 93%, 67% and 58%, respectively (p <0.05). On multivariable analyses perineural invasion was associated with clinical (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.16-4.94, p = 0.019) and pathological progression (HR 2.21, 95% CI 0.92-5.33, p = 0.076).  Conclusions:   Among patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance perineural invasion was associated with an increased risk of clinical progression. The 2-year risk of clinical progression with perineural invasion was 73%.

There is an increasing need for the development of rapid, sensitive, economical, miniaturized and multiplexable assays. Towards this goal, we present a systematic approach for the optimisation of a microfluidic sandwich immunoassay, which can be applied as a generic biosensor platform for PCa detection. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was used as the model biomarker, and its free form was captured using commercially available antibodies and detected using chemiluminescence, both in spiked buffer and matrix solutions. Along with the optimisation of surface chemistry and microfluidic parameters, we report a bio-affinity amplification strategy based on biotin-streptavidin chemistry to bring the limits of detection for free-PSA from 21.4 ng mL(-1) down to 2.7 ng mL(-1), within the clinically relevant range. An estimate of the surface coverage and simulations of the interactions taking place in the microfluidic biosensor during the assay are also presented. This novel platform using a simple passive adsorption-based bio-affinity strategy, when coupled with multiplexing and integrated detection, can serve as a promising point-of-care diagnostic tool for PCa.""","""['Narayanan Madaboosi', 'Ruben R G Soares', 'Virginia Chu', 'João Pedro Conde']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['SERS-Based Pump-Free Microfluidic Chip for Highly Sensitive Immunoassay of Prostate-Specific Antigen Biomarkers.', 'An integrated magnetic microfluidic chip for rapid immunodetection of the prostate specific antigen using immunomagnetic beads.', 'Wash-free magnetic immunoassay of the PSA cancer marker using SERS and droplet microfluidics.', 'Review on the simultaneous determination of total prostate-specific antigen and free prostate-specific antigen.', 'Biosensor developments: application to prostate-specific antigen detection.', 'Combined Use of Ionic Liquid-Based Aqueous Biphasic Systems and Microfluidic Devices for the Detection of Prostate-Specific Antigen.', 'Detection of C-Reactive Protein Using Histag-HRP Functionalized Nanoconjugate with Signal Amplified Immunoassay.', 'Top-Down Fabricated Silicon Nanowire Arrays for Field-Effect Detection of Prostate-Specific Antigen.', 'Advanced forensic validation for human spermatozoa identification using SPERM HY-LITER™ Express with quantitative image analysis.', 'Lab-on-chip systems for integrated bioanalyses.']"""

We hypothesized that high-throughput transcriptomic analysis would elucidate biological differences in PCas arising in younger versus older men, and would nominate potential age-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets.  Methods:   The high-density Affymetrix GeneChip platform, encompassing >1 million genomic loci, was utilized to assess gene expression in 1090 radical prostatectomy samples from patients with long-term follow-up. We identified genes associated with metastatic progression by 10 years post-treatment in younger (age<65) versus older (age⩾65) patients, and ranked these genes by their prognostic value. We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to nominate biological concepts that demonstrated age-specific effects, and validated a target by treating with a clinically available drug in three PCa cell lines derived from younger men.  Results:   Over 80% of the top 1000 prognostic genes in younger and older men were specific to that age group. GSEA nominated the proteasome pathway as the most differentially prognostic in younger versus older patients. High expression of proteasomal genes conferred worse prognosis in younger but not older men on univariate and multivariate analysis. Bortezomib, a Food and Drug Administration approved proteasome inhibitor, decreased proliferation in three PCa cell lines derived from younger patients.  Conclusions:   Our data show significant global differences in prognostic genes between older versus younger men. We nominate proteasomeal gene expression as an age-specific biomarker and potential therapeutic target specifically in younger men. Limitations of our study include clinical differences between cohorts, and increased comorbidities and lower survival in older patients.

Despite high-level evidence from several randomized trials, risk group stratification and treatment recommendations vary due to contradictory or inconclusive data, particularly with regard to EBRT dose prescription and ADT duration. Our aim was to investigate current patterns of practice in primary EBRT for prostate cancer in Switzerland.  Materials and methods:   Treatment recommendations on EBRT and ADT for localized and locally advanced prostate cancer were collected from 23 Swiss radiation oncology centers. Written recommendations were converted into center-specific decision trees, and analyzed for consensus and differences using a dedicated software tool. Additionally, specific radiotherapy planning and delivery techniques from the participating centers were assessed.  Results:   The most commonly prescribed radiation dose was 78 Gy (range 70-80 Gy) across all risk groups. ADT was recommended for intermediate-risk patients for 6 months in over 80 % of the centers, and for high-risk patients for 2 or 3 years in over 90 % of centers. For recommendations on combined EBRT and ADT treatment, consensus levels did not exceed 39 % in any clinical scenario. Arc-based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is implemented for routine prostate cancer radiotherapy by 96 % of the centers.  Conclusion:   Among Swiss radiation oncology centers, considerable ranges of radiotherapy dose and ADT duration are routinely offered for localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. In the vast majority of cases, doses and durations are within the range of those described in current evidence-based guidelines.""","""['Cédric M Panje', 'Alan Dal Pra', 'Thomas Zilli', 'Daniel R Zwahlen', 'Alexandros Papachristofilou', 'Fernanda G Herrera', 'Oscar Matzinger', 'Ludwig Plasswilm', 'Paul Martin Putora']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Salvage radiotherapy for macroscopic local recurrences after radical prostatectomy : A\xa0national survey on patterns of practice.', 'ESTRO-ACROP recommendations for evidence-based use of androgen deprivation therapy in combination with external-beam radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Changing trends in national practice for external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: 1999 Patterns of Care survey for prostate cancer.', 'Radiation therapy of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'External beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Variations in Radioiodine Therapy in Europe: Decision-Making after Total Thyroidectomy.', 'Variations in radioiodine ablation: decision-making after total thyroidectomy.', 'Radiotherapy for pelvic nodal recurrences after radical prostatectomy: patient selection in clinical practice.', 'Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer with simultaneous integrated boost after molecular imaging with 18F-choline-PET/CT : Clinical results and quality of life.']"""

Objective:   Validate logistic regression models, termed Mi-Prostate Score (MiPS), that incorporate serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA; or the multivariate Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator version 1.0 [PCPTrc]) and urine T2:ERG and PCA3 scores for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   T2:ERG and PCA3 scores were generated using clinical-grade transcription-mediated amplification assays. Pretrained MiPS models were applied to a validation cohort of whole urine samples prospectively collected after digital rectal examination from 1244 men presenting for biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare the performance of serum PSA (or the PCPTrc) alone and MiPS models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess clinical benefit.  Results and limitations:   Among informative validation cohort samples (n=1225 [98%], 80% from patients presenting for initial biopsy), models incorporating T2:ERG had significantly greater AUC than PSA (or PCPTrc) for predicting PCa (PSA: 0.693 vs 0.585; PCPTrc: 0.718 vs 0.639; both p<0.001) or high-grade (Gleason score >6) PCa on biopsy (PSA: 0.729 vs 0.651, p<0.001; PCPTrc: 0.754 vs 0.707, p=0.006). MiPS models incorporating T2:ERG score had significantly greater AUC (all p<0.001) than models incorporating only PCA3 plus PSA (or PCPTrc or high-grade cancer PCPTrc [PCPThg]). DCA demonstrated net benefit of the MiPS_PCPTrc (or MiPS_PCPThg) model compared with the PCPTrc (or PCPThg) across relevant threshold probabilities.  Conclusions:   Incorporating urine T2:ERG and PCA3 scores improves the performance of serum PSA (or PCPTrc) for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy.  Patient summary:   Incorporation of two prostate cancer (PCa)-specific biomarkers (TMPRSS2:ERG and PCA3) measured in the urine improved on serum prostate-specific antigen (or a multivariate risk calculator) for predicting the presence of PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy.

Objective:   Investigation of outcomes for concomitant BTT in a post hoc analysis of the COU-AA-302 trial, which demonstrated an overall clinical benefit of abiraterone acetate (AA) plus prednisone over placebo plus prednisone in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   This report describes the third interim analysis (prespecified at 55% overall survival [OS] events) for the COU-AA-302 trial.  Intervention:   Patients were grouped by concomitant BTT use or no BTT use.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Radiographic progression-free survival and OS were coprimary end points. This report describes the third interim analysis (prespecified at 55% OS events) and involves patients treated with or without concomitant BTT during the COU-AA-302 study. Median follow-up for OS was 27.1 mo. Median time-to-event variables with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), 95% CIs, and p values for concomitant BTT versus no BTT were obtained via Cox models.  Results and limitations:   While the post hoc nature of the analysis is a limitation, superiority of AA and prednisone versus prednisone alone was demonstrated for clinical outcomes with or without BTT use. Compared with no BTT use, concomitant BTT significantly improved OS (HR 0.75; p=0.01) and increased the time to ECOG deterioration (HR 0.75; p<0.001) and time to opiate use for cancer-related pain (HR 0.80; p=0.036). The safety profile of concomitant BTT with AA was similar to that reported for AA in the overall intent-to-treat population. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (all grade 1/2) with concomitant BTT use was reported in <3% of patients.  Conclusions:   AA with concomitant BTT was safe and well tolerated in men with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. The benefits of AA on clinical outcomes were increased with concomitant BTT.  Patient summary:   Treatment of advanced prostate cancer often includes bone-targeted therapy. This post hoc analysis showed that in patients with advanced prostate cancer who were treated with abiraterone acetate and prednisone in combination with bone-targeted therapy, there was a continued trend in prolongation of life when compared with patients treated with prednisone alone.

Materials and methods:   The records of patients with intermediate- or high-grade prostate sarcoma treated with curative intent at our institution from 1993 to 2013 were reviewed. Patient demographic information, tumor characteristics, and treatment modalities used were assessed. Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were calculated.  Results:   Eight patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age at presentation was 64 years, and urinary obstruction was the most common presenting symptom. All patients underwent surgical resection and neoadjuvant radiation and 6 had concurrent chemotherapy. Four patients received intraoperative radiation. With a median follow-up of 36 months, there were no local recurrences, 6 metastases, 4 deaths from disease, and no deaths from other causes. The median OS and CSS was 67.8 months, with actuarial OS and CSS rates of 100% at 1 year, 75% at 2 years, 62.5% at 3 years, and 62.5% at 5 years.

Patients and methods:   A multiple-institution cohort of 3709 prostate cancer patients was prospectively assembled from 1991 to 2006. The median age was 72 years and all patients had T1c-T3N0M0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Patients were treated with WPRT or PSVRT followed by a brachytherapy boost, with or without neoadjuvant ADT (median duration, 4.2 months). Seventy percent of patients had unfavorable-risk disease (Gleason score ≥ 7; prostate-specific antigen ≥ 10 ng/mL; or stage ≥ T2b). Cox regression was applied to determine whether the radiation treatment volume affected the risk of ACM. The interaction between radiation volume and ADT use was assessed.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 3.3 years, 561 deaths were observed. A decreased risk of ACM was noted with the use of WPRT versus PSVRT (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.89; P = .01), or with ADT use (AHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.90; P = .004). However, a combination of WPRT and ADT did not further improve ACM compared with either WPRT alone or PSVRT with ADT. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the radiotherapeutic treatment volume and ADT (AHR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.004-2.58; P = .048).  Conclusion:   Treatment with WPRT or short-course ADT is associated with a decreased risk of ACM, although a combination of the two does not yield greater benefit. This observation suggests a shared mechanism for this risk reduction, which we hypothesize to be via the treatment of micrometastatic disease within the pelvic lymph nodes.""","""['Lior Z Braunstein', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Daniel E Dosoretz', 'Sharon A Salenius', 'Michael J Katin', 'Akash Nanda', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Effect of whole pelvic radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and long-term androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Multi-institutional Evaluation of Elective Nodal Irradiation and/or Androgen Deprivation Therapy with Postprostatectomy Salvage Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Survival Outcomes of Whole-Pelvic Versus Prostate-Only Radiation Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients With Use of the National Cancer Data Base.', 'Radiotherapy and Hormone Treatment in Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on survival in men treated with radiation for prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy and Toxicity of Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy Versus Prostate-Only Radiotherapy in Localized Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Patterns of Bone Failure in Localized Prostate Cancer Previously Irradiated: The Preventive Role of External Radiotherapy on Pelvic Bone Metastases.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between January 2012 and September 2014, 330 men underwent prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 533 cancer suspicious regions were identified and scored on a Likert scale of 1 to 5 based on suspicion for malignancy with 5 indicating the highest suspicion level. Following multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging all men underwent magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted prostate biopsy using ProFuse software and the ei-Nav|Artemis system (innoMedicus, Cham, Switzerland), and a computer generated 12-core random biopsy. We analyzed a cohort of 34 men with a total of 51 cancer suspicious regions who had benign prostate biopsies and underwent repeat multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and prostate specific antigen testing at 1 year. Changes in the greatest linear measurement, the suspicion score and serum prostate specific antigen were ascertained.  Results:   During 1 year the suspicion score distribution and the mean greatest linear measurement of the cancer suspicious regions decreased significantly (p <0.0001) while mean prostate specific antigen did not significantly change (p = 0.632). Two (3.9%), 15 (29.4%) and 34 cancer suspicious regions (66.7%) showed an increase, no change and decrease in suspicion score, respectively. No (0%), 21 (42.0%) and 29 cancer suspicious regions (58.0%) showed an increase of 20% or greater, no change and a decrease of 20% or greater in greatest linear measurement, respectively. Of the 2 cancer suspicious regions exhibiting an increased suspicion score neither showed a prostate specific antigen increase of 0.5 ng/ml or greater.  Conclusions:   Our study provides compelling evidence that few benign cancer suspicious regions increase in suspicion score and/or the greatest linear measurement within 1 year independent of the baseline suspicion score. Therefore, routinely repeating multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging at 1 year in men with pathologically benign cancer suspicious regions should be discouraged since it is unlikely to influence management decisions.""","""['Darren J Bryk', 'Elton Llukani', 'William C Huang', 'Herbert Lepor']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['High diagnostic ability of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to detect anterior prostate cancer missed by transrectal 12-core biopsy.', 'Accuracy of Transperineal Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Visual Estimation and Image Fusion in Men Needing Repeat Biopsy in the PICTURE Trial.', 'Anterior Localization of Prostate Cancer Suspicious Lesions in 1,161 Patients Undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion Guided Targeted Biopsies.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound image fusion guidance of prostate biopsies: current status, challenges and future perspectives.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'A prospective study of cancer detection rates following early repeat imaging and biopsy of PI-RADS 4 and 5 regions of interest exhibiting no clinically significant prostate cancer on prior biopsy.', 'Axumin (18F-Fluciclovine) PET imaging in men exhibiting no clinically significant cancer on initial negative biopsy of PI-RADS 4 and 5 regions of interest.', 'Intra- and interreader reproducibility of PI-RADSv2: A multireader study.', 'Prostate Cancer Diagnosis on Repeat Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy of Benign Lesions: Recommendations for Repeat Sampling.', 'Serial Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer: Incremental Value.']"""

In this study, we evaluated the safety, in terms of acutetoxicity, of using moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy delivered with Helical Tomotherapy (HT) to treat prostate cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   Between December 2012 and April 2014, 42 consecutive patients were treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy using HT. All patients received 70 Gy in 28 fractions to PTV1, which included the prostate. In the intermediate risk group, 61.6 Gy were delivered to PTV2, which included the seminal vesicles. In high risk patients, the pelvic nodes were added (PTV3) and received 50.4 Gy. Acute toxicity was recorded prospectively with RTOG and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0, retrospectively with CTCAE 4.0. Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) was measured at baseline and 3 months after end of treatment, to investigate health related quality of life with regards to bladder and gastrointestinal function.  Results:   Acute toxicity was acceptable, independently from the system used to score side effects. Moderate genitourinary toxicity was more frequent than gastrointestinal toxicity. No correlation between acute side effects and patients' characteristics or physical dose parameters was registered. EPIC evaluation showed a negligible difference in urinary and bowel function post-treatment, that did not reach statistical significance.

Design:   Cross-sectional questionnaire survey.  Setting:   Secondary care prostate cancer (PCa) clinics across South, Central and Western England.  Participants:   313 men from a total sample of 426 with a histological diagnosis of PCa currently managed with AS were identified from seven UK urology departments. The mean age of respondents was 70 (51-86) years with the majority (76%) being married or in civil partnerships. 94% of responders were of white British ethnicity.  Primary outcome measures:   The prevalence of clinically meaningful depression and anxiety as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; score ≥8/21).  Secondary outcome measures:   Patient demographic data (age, employment, relationship, ethnic and educational status). Each demographic variable was cross-tabulated against patients identified as depressed or anxious to allow for the identification of variables that were significantly associated with depression and anxiety. In order to determine predictors for depression and anxiety among the demographic variables, logistic regression analyses were conducted, with p<0.05 considered as indicating statistical significance.  Results:   The prevalence of clinical anxiety and depression as determined via the HADS (HADS ≥8) was 23% (n=73) and 12.5% (n=39), respectively. Published data from men in the general population of similar age has shown prevalence rates of 8% and 6%, respectively, indicating a twofold increase in depression and a threefold increase in anxiety among AS patients. Our findings also suggest that AS patients experience substantially greater levels of anxiety than patients with PCa treated radically. The only demographic predictor for anxiety or depression was divorce.  Conclusions:   Patients with PCa managed with AS experienced substantially higher rates of anxiety and depression than that expected in the general population. Strategies to address this are needed to improve the management of this population and their quality of life.""","""['Sam Watts', 'Geraldine Leydon', 'Caroline Eyles', 'Caroline M Moore', 'Alison Richardson', 'Brian Birch', 'Philip Prescott', 'Catrin Powell', 'George Lewith']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Predictors of psychosocial distress 12 months after diagnosis with early and advanced prostate cancer.', 'A longitudinal study on the impact of active surveillance for prostate cancer on anxiety and distress levels.', 'Does Rotator Cuff Repair Improve Psychologic Status and Quality of Life in Patients With Rotator Cuff Tear?', 'Depression and anxiety in ovarian cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence rates.', 'Depression and anxiety in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence rates.', 'Related Factors with Depression and Anxiety in Mastectomized Women Breast Cancer Survivors.', 'Challenges to Recruiting Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer in Clinical Chemoprevention Trials.', ""Healthcare Professionals' Experiences and Perspectives of Facilitating Self-Management Support for Patients with Low-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer via mHealth and Health Coaching."", 'Effects of Green Tea Catechins on Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention: The Role of the Gut Microbiome.', 'Planning and developing a web-based intervention for active surveillance in prostate cancer: an integrated self-care programme for managing psychological distress.']"""

Metformin, a drug commonly prescribed for type II diabetes, displays antitumor properties. Here, we show that metformin inhibits lipogenesis in several prostate cancer cell lines. In LNCaP cells, this effect parallels the decrease of key lipogenic proteins: ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), FASN (fatty acid synthase) and SREBP1c (sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c), whereas there is no modification in DU145 and PC3 cells. Despite the relatively high level of lipogenic proteins induced by the overexpression of a constitutively active form of SREBP1c or treatment with androgens, metformin is still able to inhibit lipogenesis. Metformin does not alter the concentration of malonyl-CoA (the fatty acid precursor), and it only slightly decreases the NADPH levels, which is a co-factor required for lipogenesis, in LNCaP. Finally, we show that the inhibitory effect of metformin on lipogenesis is primarily due to a cellular energy deficit. Metformin decreases ATP in a dose-dependent manner, and this diminution is significantly correlated with the inhibition of lipogenesis in LNCaP and DU145. Indeed, the effect of metformin is linked to changes in the ATP content rather than the regulation of protein expression. Our results describe a new mechanism of action for metformin on prostate cancer metabolism.""","""['Camille Loubière', 'Thomas Goiran', 'Kathiane Laurent', 'Zied Djabari', 'Jean-François Tanti', 'Frédéric Bost']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Salicylate activates AMPK and synergizes with metformin to reduce the survival of prostate and lung cancer cells ex vivo through inhibition of de novo lipogenesis.', 'Inhibition of lipogenesis and induction of apoptosis by valproic acid in prostate cancer cells via the C/EBPα/SREBP-1 pathway.', 'RNA interference-mediated silencing of the acetyl-CoA-carboxylase-alpha gene induces growth inhibition and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgens, lipogenesis and prostate cancer.', 'The mitochondrial H(+)-ATP synthase and the lipogenic switch: new core components of metabolic reprogramming in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Diabetes and Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Cirrhosis Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.', 'Metformin and Cancer Hallmarks: Molecular Mechanisms in Thyroid, Prostate and Head and Neck Cancer Models.', 'Single cell mass spectrometry analysis of drug-resistant cancer cells: Metabolomics studies of synergetic effect of combinational treatment.']"""

Furthermore, the relationship between antihypertensive drugs and prostate cancer in hypertensive patients remains unclear.  Methods:   From Taiwan's national health insurance database, we identified 80,299 patients diagnosed with hypertension in 2001 and matched with 321,916 subjects without hypertension by age, income, urbanization level, and index day. A total of 684 hypertensive patients without antihypertensive drug use (drug non-user subcohort) were also matched (1:4) with 2736 patients on antihypertensive medication (drug subcohort) using the same criteria. Each subject in the two study groups was followed up for a maximum of nine years, during which death was considered a competing event when performing the stratified Fine and Gray regression hazards model for the estimation of prostate cancer risk for the cohorts. Uptake of antihypertensive prescription was considered a time-dependent variable.  Results:   Our findings indicate that patients with hypertension are at significantly increased risk for prostate cancer incidence when compared to their matched non-hypertensive counterparts (sHR=6.80, 95% CI=1.97-23.44, p=0.0024).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dosimetric effects of intrafractional motion on SIB-IMRT to a dominant intraprostatic lesion (IPL) using measured motion data of patients in a prone position, fixed with a thermoplastic shell. We obtained 2 orthogonal x-ray fluoroscopic images at the same moment every 0.2 seconds for 30 seconds before and after treatment, once weekly, from 7 patients with localized prostate cancer with detectable prostatic calcification. Prostate displacements in the left-right (LR), anteroposterior (AP), and superoinferior (SI) directions were calculated using the prostatic calcification as a fiducial marker. We defined the displacement between pretreatment and posttreatment as baseline drift (BD). An SIB-IMRT plan was generated in which each IPL + 3mm received a dose of 94.5Gy, whereas the remainder of the prostate + 7mm received a dose of 75.6Gy in 9 fields. A simulated plan of dose blurring was generated by the convolution of isocenter-shifted plans using measured motion data in 30 seconds and motion in 30 seconds + distance between pretreatment and posttreatment position (BD) for each of the 7 patients. The motion in 30 seconds mainly reflected respiration-induced motion. The mean displacements of BD were 1.4mm (- 3.1 to 8.2mm), - 2.2mm (- 9.1 to 1.5mm), and - 0.3mm (- 5.0 to 1.8mm) in the AP, SI, and LR directions, respectively. The differences in the target coverage with V90% of the IPL and V100% of the prostate between the simulated plan and original plan were - 3.9% to - 0.3% and - 0.6% to 1.1% for respiration-induced motion and 3.1% to - 67.8% and 3.6% to - 13.3% for BD with respiration-induced motion, respectively. The large motion of BD resulted in an inadequate coverage by the prescribed dose of the SIB-IMRT to the IPL. A 7-mm margin is recommended when real-time tracking techniques are not applied.

A syngeneic mouse-to-mouse transplantation assay was used to prove the functionality of the tissue-engineered ossicles.

Our current understanding of the patholobiology of these fundamental disorders suggests that inflammatory processes may differentially affect them; thus, atherosclerosis can be largely driven by inflammation, where as cancer often flourishes as inflammatory responses are modulated. A corollary of this hypothesis is that cancer (or its treatment may significantly attenuate atherosclerotic disease by diminishing host inflammatory response, suggesting potential therapeutic approaches. To evaluate the relationship between cancer and cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease, we assessed 1,024 autopsy reports from Brigham and Women's Hospital and performed correlative analyses on atherosclerotic severity and cancer prevalence. In gender- and age-matched populations, there is a statistically significant inverse correlation between history of malignancy and autopsy-proven atherosclerotic disease. In a second analysis, we evaluated 147,779 patients through analysis of the Harvard Catalyst SHRINE database and demonstrated a reduced non-coronary atherosclerotic disease rate: control (27.40%), leukemia/lymphoma (12.57%), lung (17.63%), colorectal (18.17%), breast (9.79%), uterus/cervix (11.47%), and prostate (18.40%). We herein report that, based on two separate medical records analysis, an inverse correlation between cancer and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, this correlation is not uniformly associated with anti-neoplastic treatment, suggesting that the inverse relationship may be in part attributable to an individual's intrinsic inflammatory propensity, and/or to inflammation-modulatory properties of neoplasms.""","""['Matthew Li', 'Michael J Cima', 'Danny A Milner Jr']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Evaluation of general and coronary atherosclerosis and malignant disease demonstrates inverse correlations for specific cancer types as well as cancer in general.', 'Preclinical carotid atherosclerosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Comprehensive analysis of clinico-pathological data reveals heterogeneous relations between atherosclerosis and cancer.', 'Diagnosis and management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease: a\xa0review.', 'Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure: Determinants of risk and outcomes in patients with diabetes.', 'Flaxseed Lignans as Important Dietary Polyphenols for Cancer Prevention and Treatment: Chemistry, Pharmacokinetics, and Molecular Targets.', 'Risk of cancer in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease: A nationwide population-based study with a matched control group.', 'The Assessment of Left Ventricle Function and Subclinical Atherosclerosis in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia.']"""

Sipuleucel-T is the first personalized treatment for prostate cancer to be manufactured using the immune system of each individual patient. Patient preparation and compliance are critical because patients undergo serial leukapheresis and reinfusion procedures within a relatively short time period, which may result in transient reactions.  Objectives:   The study aims to identify patients best suited for sipuleucel-T treatment, provide an overview of treatment, and encourage infusion sites to consider a primary contact model for the efficient coordination of care.  Methods:   Treatment experiences were evaluated from 124 patients with mCRPC who received sipuleucel-T from January 2010 to August 2013 according to current best practices. Feedback was collected from reflective interdisciplinary discussion within the sipuleucel-T delivery team (nurses, advanced practice providers, urologists, and medical oncologists).  Findings:   Early patient identification and education on treatment rationale, delivery, and expectations help ensure a successful sipuleucel-T treatment experience.

Acquired resistance to docetaxel precedes fatality in castration-resistant prostate cancer. The aims of this study were to evaluate docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant proteomes in PC-3 cells, and to investigate the molecular mechanism of docetaxel-resistant PC-3 cells.  Methods:   Docetaxel-resistant PC-3 cells were developed by docetaxel dose escalation. The global profiling of the protein expression was investigated in docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant proteomes in PC-3 cells using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.  Results:   Forty-nine differential proteins were found in docetaxel-resistant PC-3 cells in comparison with docetaxel-sensitive PC-3 cells.

We had previously developed a nonparametric multiple imputation approach. The method used two working proportional hazards (PH) models, one for the event times and the other for the censoring times, to define a nearest neighbor imputing risk set. This risk set was then used to impute failure times for censored observations. Here, we adapt the method to the situation where the event and censoring times follow accelerated failure time models and propose to use the Buckley-James estimator as the two working models. Besides studying the performances of the proposed method, we also compare the proposed method with two popular methods for handling dependent censoring through the use of auxiliary variables, inverse probability of censoring weighted and parametric multiple imputation methods, to shed light on the use of them. In a simulation study with time-independent auxiliary variables, we show that all approaches can reduce bias due to dependent censoring. The proposed method is robust to misspecification of either one of the two working models and their link function. This indicates that a working proportional hazards model is preferred because it is more cumbersome to fit an accelerated failure time model. In contrast, the inverse probability of censoring weighted method is not robust to misspecification of the link function of the censoring time model. The parametric imputation methods rely on the specification of the event time model. The approaches are applied to a prostate cancer dataset.""","""['Chiu-Hsieh Hsu', 'Jeremy M G Taylor', 'Chengcheng Hu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Survival analysis using auxiliary variables via non-parametric multiple imputation.', 'Cox regression analysis with missing covariates via nonparametric multiple imputation.', 'Multiple imputation for interval censored data with auxiliary variables.', 'Survival analysis in public health research.', 'Additive hazards model with auxiliary subgroup survival information.', 'Using simulation studies to evaluate statistical methods.', 'Survival analysis of thalassemia major patients using Cox, Gompertz proportional hazard and Weibull accelerated failure time models.']"""

Improved insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation are among the hypothesized mechanisms by which coffee drinking may affect cancer risk; however, associations between coffee drinking and systemic levels of immune and inflammatory markers have not been well characterized.  Methods:   We used Luminex bead-based assays to measure serum levels of 77 immune and inflammatory markers in 1,728 older non-Hispanic Whites. Usual coffee intake was self-reported using a food frequency questionnaire. We used weighted multivariable logistic regression models to examine associations between coffee and dichotomized marker levels. We conducted statistical trend tests by modeling the median value of each coffee category and applied a 20% false discovery rate criterion to P values.  Results:   Ten of the 77 markers were nominally associated (P trend < 0.05) with coffee drinking. Five markers withstood correction for multiple comparisons and included aspects of the host response namely chemotaxis of monocytes/macrophages (IFNγ, CX3CL1/fractalkine, CCL4/MIP-1β), proinflammatory cytokines (sTNFRII), and regulators of cell growth (FGF-2). Heavy coffee drinkers had lower circulating levels of IFNγ [odds ratios (OR), 0.35; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.16-0.75], CX3CL1/fractalkine (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.64), CCL4/MIP-1β (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.99), FGF-2 (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.28-1.38), and sTNFRII (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.79) than non-coffee drinkers.

Methods:   A single-institution prospective analysis of all patients who underwent RARP for localized prostate cancer was performed between January 2005 and June 2013. The primary end point was biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS). BRFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared to that from the log-rank test. Cox׳s proportional hazards regression univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to define the prognostic factors.  Results:   Overall, 742 men were included. After a median follow-up of 31.4 months, biochemical recurrence occurred in 80 patients (10.8%). BRFS was 93%, 87%, and 80.7% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Progression to local recurrence occurred in 49 patients (6.6%). During the follow-up period, 3 patients experienced progression to metastatic disease and were treated with hormonotherapy. No patient died of disease during the study period. In multivariate analyses, Gleason score was the strongest predictor of BRFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.4; P<0.001). There were 3 other predictive factors of BRFS were LVI (HR = 7.64; P = 0.005), MTD (HR = 4.04; P =0.009), and margin length ≥ 3 mm (HR = 1.25; P = 0.04).  Conclusion:   In the era of serum prostate-specific antigen testing maturity in conjunction with a single approach to extirpation of the prostate gland by RARP, LVI, MTD, and positive surgical margins ≥ 3 mm are prognostic factors associated with BRFS after RARP.

Material and methods:   Data from 1,882 men undergoing radical prostatectomy for PC between 1988 and 2011 at Veterans Affairs Health Care Facilities were analyzed from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database. Men were stratified by AO exposure (binary). Associations between AO exposure and biopsy and pathologic Gleason sum (GS) and pathologic stage were determined by logistic regression models adjusted for preoperative characteristics. Hazard ratios for biochemical recurrence (BCR), secondary treatment, metastases, and PC-specific mortality were determined by Cox models adjusted for preoperative characteristics.  Results:   There were 333 (17.7%) men with AO exposure. AO-exposed men were younger (median 59 vs. 62 y), had lower preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels (5.8 vs. 6.7 ng/ml), lower clinical category (25% vs. 38% palpable), and higher body mass index (28.2 vs. 27.6 kg/m(2)), all P<0.01.

Many major medical organizations have issued recommendations for prostate cancer screening, stressing the need for shared decision making before ordering a test. The purpose of this study is to better understand associations between discussions about benefits and harms of PSA testing and uptake of the test among men aged ≥40 years.  Methods:   Associations between pre-screening discussions and PSA testing were examined using self-reported data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Unadjusted prevalence of PSA testing was estimated and AORs were calculated using logistic regression in 2014.  Results:   The multivariate analysis showed that men who had ever discussed advantages of PSA testing only or discussed both advantages and disadvantages were more likely, respectively, to report having had a test within the past year than men who had no discussions (p<0.001). In addition, men who had only discussed the disadvantages of PSA testing with their healthcare providers were more likely (AOR=2.75, 95% CI=2.00, 3.79) to report getting tested than men who had no discussions.  Conclusions:   Discussions of the benefits or harms of PSA testing are positively associated with increased uptake of the test. Given the conflicting recommendations for prostate cancer screening and increasing importance of shared decision making, this study points to the need for understanding how pre-screening discussions are being conducted in clinical practice and the role played by patients' values and preferences in decisions about PSA testing.""","""['Jun Li', 'Guixiang Zhao', 'Ingrid J Hall']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Prev Med""","""['Prostate cancer screening decision-making in three states: 2013 behavioral risk factor surveillance system analysis.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Initiation and Shared Decision-Making: Findings from the 2000 and 2015 National Health Interview Surveys.', 'Recent Patterns in Shared Decision Making for Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing in the United States.', 'American Urological Association (AUA) guideline on prostate cancer detection: process and rationale.', 'Prostate-specific antigen screening: friend or foe?', 'Associations of Content and Context of Communication with Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing.', 'The Impact of Receipt of Information on Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing on Screening with the Prostate-Specific Antigen Test.', 'Nonlinear Relationship Between Age and Likelihood of Undergoing Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing, and the Predictive Factors of Testing at Different Ages.', 'Beliefs that contribute to delays in diagnosis of prostate cancer among Afro-Caribbean men in Trinidad and Tobago.', 'Are Men Making Informed Decisions According to the Prostate-Specific Antigen Test Guidelines?

It has been recently demonstrated that exosomes present in the body fluids contain proteins and RNAs in the cells from which they are derived and could serve as a diagnostic marker for various diseases. In the present study, we aimed to identify proteins contained in exosomes that could be markers for progression and taxane-resistance of prostate cancer. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from the culture medium of taxane-resistant human prostate cancer PC-3 cells (PC-3R) and their parental PC-3 cells. Isolated exosomes were subjected to iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis. Exosomes were also isolated from the culture medium by using anti-CD9 antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. Protein expression was knocked down by siRNA transfection followed by analysis of the silencing effects. Proteomic analysis showed that integrin β4 (ITGB4) and vinculin (VCL) were upregulated in exosomes derived from PC-3R cells compared to PC-3 cells. The elevation of ITGB4 and VCL was confirmed in exosomes captured by anti-CD9 antibody from the culture medium of PC-3R cells. Silencing of ITGB4 and VCL expression did not affect proliferation and taxane-resistance of PC-3R cells, but ITGB4 knockdown attenuated both cell migration and invasion and VCL knockdown reduced invasion. Our results suggest that ITGB4 and VCL in exosomes could be useful markers for progression of prostate cancer associated with taxane-resistance, providing the basis for development of an exosome-based diagnostic system.""","""['Kyojiro Kawakami', 'Yasunori Fujita', 'Taku Kato', 'Kosuke Mizutani', 'Koji Kameyama', 'Hiroki Tsumoto', 'Yuri Miura', 'Takashi Deguchi', 'Masafumi Ito']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Serum exosomal P-glycoprotein is a potential marker to diagnose docetaxel resistance and select a taxoid for patients with prostate cancer.', 'Gamma-glutamyltransferase activity in exosomes as a potential marker for prostate cancer.', 'Isolation of prostate cancer-related exosomes.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: From Current Knowledge to the Role of Metabolomics and Exosomes.', 'Vinculin Identified as a Potential Biomarker in Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome Based on iTRAQ and LC-MS/MS-Based Proteomic Analysis.', 'Vinculin phosphorylation impairs vascular endothelial junctions promoting atherosclerosis.', 'Small extracellular vesicle-associated miR-6068 promotes aggressive phenotypes of prostate cancer through miR-6068/HIC2/SIRT1 axis.', 'The Potential Role of Exosomal Proteins in Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging roles of exosome-derived biomarkers in cancer theranostics: messages from novel protein targets.']"""

These mutations were discussed as early drivers for malignant transformation. In prostate cancer (PrCa) TERT expression has been associated with a poor prognosis and higher risk for disease recurrence. The underlying mechanisms for high TERT expression in PrCa have still not been clarified. To date, data on TERT promoter mutation analysis in PrCa are sparse. Therefore, we performed sequence analysis of the core promoter region of the TERT gene in an unselected cohort of prostate tumors.  Methods:   Sections from 167 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and cryopreserved prostate tumors were microdissected and used for DNA isolation. The mutation hotspot region within the TERT core promoter (-260 to +60) was analyzed by direct Sanger sequencing or SNaPshot analysis.  Results:   All cases were analyzed successfully. Mutations within the core promoter of the TERT gene were not detected in any of the cases with all tumors exhibiting a wild-type sequence.

Intradural chondrosarcoma is even rarer.  Case:   Here, we describe a case of dural chondrosarcoma with a radiation history for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a radical prostatectomy for prostatic cancer 15 and 8 years earlier, respectively. A 67-year-old man presented with a 3-week memory disturbance and dysarthria. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance images of the brain revealed a dural-based mass in the left temporal area. Under the impression of a glioblastoma, a resection and an intraoperative squash cytology were done. A necrotic dirty background as well as bluish-to-pinkish myxoid stroma were characteristic; the nuclei of highly pleomorphic tumor cells were hyperchromatic to vesicular with an occasional ground-glass appearance. The cytoplasm was of an eosinophilic hyalinized condensed morphology with an occasional granular appearance.

Several studies implicate the RSK pathway as being pivotal for the growth and proliferation of CSCs, which are postulated to drive tumor relapse. We now address the potential for the newly developed RSK inhibitor LJI308 to target the CSC population and repress TNBC growth and dissemination. Overexpression of the Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) oncogene in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) drove TNBC tumor formation characterized by a multi-drug resistance phenotype, yet these cells were sensitive to LJI308 in addition to the classic RSK inhibitors BI-D1870 and luteolin. Notably, LJI308 specifically targeted transformed cells as it had little effect on the non-tumorigenic parental HMECs. Loss of cell growth, both in 2D and 3D culture, was attributed to LJI308-induced apoptosis. We discovered CD44+/CD49f+ TNBC cells to be less sensitive to chemotherapy compared to the isogenic CD44-/CD49f- cells. However, inhibition of RSK using LJI308, BI-D1870, or luteolin was sufficient to eradicate the CSC population.

PC-1, a prostate Leucine Zipper gene (PrLZ), is specifically expressed in prostate tissue as an androgen-induced gene and is up-regulated in advanced PCa. Recent work confirmed that PC-1 expression promotes PCa growth and androgen-independent progression. However, how this occurs and whether this can be used as a biomarker is uncertain. Here, we report that PC-1 overexpression confers PCa cells resistance to rapamycin treatment by antagonizing rapamycin-induced cytostasis and autophagy (rapamycin-sensitivity was observed in PC-1-deficient (shPC-1) C4-2 cells). Analysis of the mTOR pathway in PCa cells with PC-1 overexpressed and depressed revealed that eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1(4E-BP1) was highly regulated by PC-1. Immunohistochemistry assays indicated that 4E-BP1 up-regulation correlates with increased PC-1 expression in human prostate tumors and in PCa cells. Furthermore, PC-1 interacts directly with 4E-BP1 and stabilizes 4E-BP1 protein via inhibition of its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Thus, PC-1 is a novel regulator of 4E-BP1 and our work suggests a potential mechanism through which PC-1 enhances PCa cell survival and malignant progression and increases chemoresistance. Thus, the PC-1-4E-BP1 interaction may represent a therapeutic target for treating advanced PCa.""","""['Lan Yu', 'Zeng-Fu Shang', 'Jian Wang', 'Hongtao Wang', 'Fang Huang', 'Zhe Zhang', 'Ying Wang', 'Jianguang Zhou', 'Shanhu Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The 4E-BP1/eIF4E ratio is a determinant for rapamycin response in esophageal cancer cells.', 'PC-1/PrLZ contributes to malignant progression in prostate cancer.', 'EphA3, induced by PC-1/PrLZ, contributes to the malignant progression of prostate cancer.', '4E-BP1, a multifactor regulated multifunctional protein.', 'Reappraisal to the study of 4E-BP1 as an mTOR substrate - A normative critique.', 'Acetylation-dependent regulation of TPD52 isoform 1 modulates chaperone-mediated autophagy in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and its splice variant, AR-V7, differentially induce mRNA splicing in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen-dependent alternative mRNA isoform expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'PrLZ increases prostate cancer docetaxel resistance by inhibiting LKB1/AMPK-mediated autophagy.', 'Stabilization of 4E-BP1 by PI3K kinase and its involvement in CHK2 phosphorylation in the cellular response to radiation.']"""

The objective of this study was to determine the molecular correlates of the different Gleason grades. Global miRNA expression was analysed in pure regions of each Gleason grade. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to predict miRNA-mediated signalling. We experimentally validated the effect of miRNAs on target gene expression and cellular functions using cell line models. We also examined the correlation of miRNAs with biochemical failure, metastasis and prognosis. We identified miRNAs that are differentially expressed between grades 3 and 5, and the top biological processes associated with Gleason grade transition were extracellular matrix (ECM)-mediated signalling, focal adhesion kinase- and mitogen-activated kinase pathways. Transfection with miR-29c, miR-34a and miR-141 repressed genes involved in ECM-mediated pathways, such as SRC, PRKCA, COL1A1, ITGB1 and MAPK13, and decreased cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, miR-29c and miR-34a influenced downstream pathways that affect actin cytoskeleton organization and androgen receptor localization. Finally, miR-29c, miR-34a, miR-141 and miR-148a showed inverse correlations with biochemical recurrence, but were independent of other clinical parameters.

CEMP1 promotes cell attachment, differentiation, deposition rate, composition, and morphology of hydroxyapatite crystals formed by human cementoblastic cells. Its expression is restricted to cementoblasts and progenitor cell subpopulations present in the periodontal ligament. CEMP1 transfection into non-osteogenic cells such as adult human gingival fibroblasts results in differentiation of these cells into a ""mineralizing"" cell phenotype. Other studies have shown evidence that CEMP1 could have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of bone defects and regeneration of other mineralized tissues. To better understand CEMP1's biological effects in vitro we investigated the consequences of its expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) growing in non-mineralizing media by comparing gene expression profiles. We identified several mRNAs whose expression is modified by CEMP1 induction in HGF cells. Enrichment analysis showed that several of these newly expressed genes are involved in oncogenesis. Our results suggest that CEMP1 causes the transformation of HGF and NIH3T3 cells. CEMP1 is overexpressed in cancer cell lines. We also determined that the region spanning the CEMP1 locus is commonly amplified in a variety of cancers, and finally we found significant overexpression of CEMP1 in leukemia, cervix, breast, prostate and lung cancer.

PCR, real-time PCR (RT-PCR), sequencing, and bisulfite conversion of DNA were applied. We correlated the molecular data to the histological and clinical findings.  Results:   The obtained molecular profile in 11 PCa Bulgarian patients coincided with the clinico-histological data of strongly aggressive PCa. Association was detected between the tumor stage (assessed by TNM as T3 and T4) and the detected molecular profile of aggressive cancer behavior with one exception, assessed as T2. None of our patients had positive family history of prostate cancer and no somatic mutations were detected in the AR gene. All patients showed normal genotype with respect to the KLF6 IVS1- 27G>A polymorphism.

Our previous in vitro study showed that quercetin synergized with 2-Methoxyestradiol exhibiting increased antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in both androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines. In the present study, we determined whether their combination could inhibit LNCaP and PC-3 xenograft tumor growth in vivo and explored the underlying mechanism. Human prostate cancer LNCaP and PC-3 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in male BALB/c nude mice. When xenograft tumors reached about 100 mm3, mice were randomly allocated to vehicle control, quercetin or 2-Methoxyestradiol singly treated and combination treatment groups. After therapeutic intervention for 4 weeks, combination treatment of quercetin and 2-ME i) significantly inhibited prostate cancer xenograft tumor growth by 46.8% for LNCaP and 51.3% for PC-3 as compared to vehicle control group, more effective than quercetin (28.4% for LNCaP, 24.8% for PC3) or 2-ME (32.1% for LNCaP, 28.9% for PC3) alone; ii) was well tolerated by BALB/c mice and no obvious toxic reactions were observed; iii) led to higher Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cleaved caspase-3 protein expression and apoptosis rate; and iv) resulted in lower phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) protein level, vascular endothelial growth factor protein and mRNA expression, microvascular density and proliferation rate than single drug treatment. These effects were more remarkable compared to vehicle group. Therefore, combination of quercetin and 2-ME can serve as a novel clinical treatment regimen owning the potential of enhancing antitumor effect on prostate cancer in vivo and lessening the dose and side effects of either quercetin or 2-ME alone. These in vivo results will lay a further solid basis for subsequent researches on this novel therapeutic regimen in human prostate cancer.""","""['Feiya Yang', 'Liming Song', 'Huiping Wang', 'Jun Wang', 'Zhiqing Xu', 'Nianzeng Xing']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Quercetin synergizes with 2-methoxyestradiol inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Effect of 2-methoxyestradiol combined with quercetin on prostate cancer in vitro.', 'Quercetin inhibits angiogenesis through thrombospondin-1 upregulation to antagonize human prostate cancer PC-3 cell growth in vitro and in vivo.', 'Cannabinoids and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of Animal Studies.', 'Emerging impact of quercetin in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Tanshinone-I for the treatment of uterine fibroids: Molecular docking, simulation, and density functional theory investigations.', 'Computer-aided analysis of quercetin mechanism of overcoming docetaxel resistance in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The potential anti-cancer effects of quercetin on blood, prostate and lung cancers: An update.', 'Quercetin Attenuates Osteoporosis in Orchiectomy Mice by Regulating Glucose and Lipid Metabolism via the GPRC6A/AMPK/mTOR Signaling Pathway.', 'Elucidating the Synergistic Effect of Multiple Chinese Herbal Prescriptions in the Treatment of Post-stroke Neurological Damage.']"""

In addition, kep and kel values from DCE-US were significantly higher than those derived from DCE-MRI at day 0 (p < 0.0001) for both groups. At day 2, kel followed the same tendency for both groups, whereas kep showed this tendency only for the treated group in intermediate-enhancement regions.

Proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of PSMs in predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR), CRPC, metastases, and PCSM. To determine if PSMs were more predictive in certain patients, analyses were stratified by pathological Gleason score, stage, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.  Results:   The median (interquartile range) follow-up was 6.6 (3.2-10.6) years and 1 127 patients had >10 years of follow-up. During this time, 302 (32%) men had BCR, 112 (3%) developed CRPC, 144 (4%) developed metastases, and 83 (2%) died from prostate cancer. There were 1,600 (40%) men with PSMs. In unadjusted models, PSMs were significantly associated with all adverse outcomes: BCR, CRPC, metastases and PCSM (all P ≤ 0.001). After adjusting for demographic and pathological characteristics, PSMs were associated with increased risk of only BCR (HR 1.98, P < 0.001), and not CRPC, metastases, or PCSM (HR ≤1.29, P > 0.18).

Methods:   In a group of 91 prostate cancer patients presenting for primary (n = 51) or postoperative (n = 40) curative RT, blood samples (blood count, acute phase proteins, and cytokines) were analyzed before (T1), three times during (T2-T4), and 6-8 weeks after (T5) radiotherapy. Before RT (baseline), on the last day (acute toxicity), a median of 2 months and 16 months (late toxicity) after RT, patients responded to a validated questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite). Acute score changes > 20 points and late changes > 10 points were considered clinically relevant.  Results:   Radiotherapy resulted in significant changes of hematologic parameters, with the largest effect on lymphocytes (mean decrease of 31-45 %) and significant dependence on target volume. C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation > 5 mg/l and hemoglobin level decrease ≥ 5 G/1 at T2 were found to be independently predictive for acute urinary toxicity (p < 0.01, respectively). CRP elevation was predominantly detected in primary prostate RT (p = 0.02). Early lymphocyte level elevation ≥ 0.3G/l at T2 was protective against late urinary and bowel toxicity (p = 0.02, respectively). Other significant predictive factors for late bowel toxicity were decreasing hemoglobin levels (cut-off ≥ 5 G/l) at T2 (p = 0.04); changes of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor; p = 0.03) and ferritin levels (p = 0.02) at T5. All patients with late bowel toxicity had interleukin (IL)-6 levels < 1.5 ng/l at T2 (63 % without; p = 0.01).

Here, we report on an integrated circuit that combines the capture of CTCs with the profiling of their gene expression signatures.

CTCs are captured with 97% efficiency from 2 mL of whole blood, yielding a 500-fold concentration within 1 h. We show efficient capture of as few as 2 cancer cells/(mL of blood) and demonstrate that the gene expression module accurately profiles the expression of prostate-specific genes in CTCs captured from whole blood. This advance provides the first sample-to-answer solution for gene-based testing of CTCs.

The majority of castration-resistance cancers persist in the expression of the androgen receptor (AR), as well as androgen-dependent genes. The AR is regulated not only by it associated steroid hormone, but also by manifold regulatory and signaling molecules, including several kinases. We undertook evaluation of the role of Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 (LMTK2) in modulating AR activity, as several Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have shown a marked association of LMTK2 activity with the development of prostate cancer. We confirm that not only is LMTK2 mRNA reduced in prostate cancer tissue, but also LMTK2 protein levels are markedly diminished. Knockdown of LMTK2 protein in prostate cell lines greatly increased the transcription of androgen-responsive genes. In addition, LMTK2 knockdown led to an increase in prostate cancer stem cell populations in LNCaP cells, indicative of increased tumorogenicity. Using multiple approaches, we also demonstrate that LMTK2 interacts with the AR, thus putting LMTK2 as a component of a signaling complex modulating AR activity. Our finding that LMTK2 is a negative regulator of AR activity defines a novel cellular pathway for activation of AR-responsive genes in castrate resistant-prostate cancer.

Our previous study has demonstrated the high prevalence of TTTY15-USP9Y in prostate cancer samples from a Chinese population. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical utility of TTTY15-USP9Y in predicting the prostate biopsy outcome.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively examined the expression of TTTY15-USP9Y in 226 qualified urine sediment samples. Total RNA was extracted from the urine sediment by using TRIzol reagent, and complementary DNA was synthesized using TransPlex Complete Whole Transcriptome Amplification Kit (WTA2). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate the expression of TTTY15-USP9Y and the prostate cancer-specific antigen (PSA) level. The TTTY15-USP9Y score was calculated as 2(Ct(PSA)-Ct(TTTY15-USP9Y))× 1,000.  Results:   The TTTY15-USP9Y score was statistically significantly higher in men with positive biopsy outcome than in men with negative biopsy outcome (P<0.001). The area under the curve was 0.828 for the TTTY15-USP9Y score in the entire patient cohort. The TTTY15-USP9Y score׳s cutoff of 90.28 provided the optimal balance between sensitivity (84.0%) and specificity (77.5%). The combination of PSA level and the TTTY15-USP9Y score significantly improved the diagnostic performance of PSA level (P = 0.001). The TTTY15-USP9Y score alone was superior to PSA level, percent free PSA, and PSA density (serum PSA/prostate volume) in the subgroup of clinical interest (PSA level: 4-10ng/ml, gray zone). Univariable and multivariable logistic analyses indicated that TTTY15-USP9Y score, PSA level, age, and prostate volume were independent predictors of PCa. Adding the TTTY15-USP9Y score in the clinical base model (PSA level, age, and prostate volume) could bring a higher net benefit and reduce more unnecessary biopsies in the defined range of interest (10%-40% threshold probability).

The tailored pore size of the porous silicon also allows efficient immobilization of antibodies by surface adsorption, and does not require chemical immobilization. Monoclonal hK2 capture antibody (6B7) was dispensed onto P-Si chip using a piezoelectric dispenser. In total 13 × 13 arrays (169 spots) were spotted on the chip with its single spot volume of 300 pL. For an optimization of capture antibody condition, we firstly performed an immunoassay of the P-Si microarray under a titration series of hK2 in pure buffer (PBS) at three different antibody densities (75, 100 and 145 µg/mL).

Methods:   This is an open-label, randomized, crossover study to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of onapristone and its main metabolite, N-mono-desmethyl onapristone. Twelve healthy female subjects received 10 mg of oral IR onapristone after an overnight fast, or within 30 min of a high-fat, high-calorie meal with a 2-week washout between dosing periods.  Results:   Onapristone plasma t1/2 (mean ± SD) was 4.36 ± 0.81 h for the fasted state and 3.76 ± 0.36 h for the fed state. Following food, onapristone tmax was delayed from 1 to 4 h. Food intake was also associated with a small increase in AUC0-∞ of approximately 13 % and a statistically significant decrease in Cmax of approximately 18 %. One subject experienced a 23-day delay in menses after one 10 mg onapristone dose, while another subject experienced transient grade 2 NCI-CTCAE liver enzyme elevation 3 weeks post dose.  Conclusion:   The results are consistent with previous observations, indicating that there is a small increase in onapristone exposure and a significant decrease in Cmax when taken with food.

Methods:   Antioxidant activities of CP were determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl (OH(-)) radicals-scavenging methods. PC-3 and LNCaP (androgen-refractory and androgen-dependent PCa-derived cell lines) were cultured and treated with CP (10, 50 and 100 μg/mL). Effects of CP on cells were determined by cytotoxicity assay (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) and viability assay (sodium 3'-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate, XTT).

Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis was carried out on 429 patients with low and intermediate-risk of prostate adenocarcinoma, according to the recommendations of the EORTC, who underwent 125I brachytherapies in intraoperative dosimetry ""real-time"" system between September 2003 and September 2013.  Results:   The mean follow-up was 71.98 months. Biochemical relapse of disease by rising PSA (Phoenix criterion) was observed in 18 patients (4.2%). Through the application of Kaplan-Meier survival curves in this sample, the rate of survival at 6 years without biochemical relapse was higher than 95%. By Iog rank test comparing biochemical relapse with initial PSA (15-10 and <10) and Gleason values (7 and <7), there was no statistical difference (P=0.830) of the initial PSA in the probability of developing biochemical relapse. In relation to Gleason score, it was noted a statistical difference (P <0.05), demonstrating that patients with Gleason 7 are more likely to develop biochemical relapse.  Conclusions:   Brachytherapy as monotherapy is at present an effective choice in the treatment of localized prostate adenocarcinoma. Biochemical relapses are minimal. The initial PSA showed no statistically difference in the rate of relapses, unlike the value Gleason, where it was demonstrated that patients with Gleason 7 have a higher probability of biochemical relapse.

Simple linear regression was performed to analyze a correlation between PSA fluctuation and other factors such as age, PSA, PSA density, and prostate volume.  Results:   There were significant differences in PSA, PSA density, percentage of free PSA, and PSA fluctuation between two groups. PSA fluctuation was significantly greater in non-cancer group than prostate cancer group (19.95 ± 23.34%/month vs 9.63 ± 8.57%/ month, P=0.004).

To date, no effective treatment exists for metastatic prostate cancer and consequently, there is an urgent need to develop new and improved therapeutics. In recent years, the therapeutic potential of RNA interference (RNAi) has been extensively explored in a wide range of diseases including prostate cancer using numerous gene delivery vectors. The aims of this study were to investigate the ability of a non-viral modified cyclodextrin (CD) vector to deliver siRNA to the highly metastatic PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, to quantify the resulting knockdown of the two target genes (RelA and SRF) and to study the effects of the silencing on metastasis. Data from a Matrigel in vitro invasion assay indicated that the silencing of the target genes achieved by the CD vector resulted in significant reductions (P=0.0001) in the metastatic potential of these cells. As the silencing of these target genes was shown not to have a negative impact on cell viability, we hypothesise that the mechanism of invasion inhibition is due, in part, to the significant reduction observed (P⩽0.0001) in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokine, MMP9, which is known to be implicated in the metastasis of prostate cancer.""","""['J C Evans', 'J McCarthy', 'C Torres-Fuentes', 'J F Cryan', 'J Ogier', 'R Darcy', 'R W Watson', ""C M O'Driscoll""]""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Gene Ther""","""['NF-κB subunits regulate maspin expression in prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'S100A4 regulates migration and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells via NF-κB-dependent MMP-9 signal.', 'A novel, anisamide-targeted cyclodextrin nanoformulation for siRNA delivery to prostate cancer cells expressing the sigma-1 receptor.', 'The prognostic utility of the transcription factor SRF in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer: in-vitro discovery and in-vivo validation.', 'Blockade of NF-kappaB activity in human prostate cancer cells is associated with suppression of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.', 'miRacle of microRNA-Driven Cancer Nanotherapeutics.', 'Recent Advances in Nanomedicine for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Cyclodextrin-Based Functional Glyconanomaterials.', 'Advances in Targeting Cancer-Associated Genes by Designed siRNA in Prostate Cancer.', 'Progress in Delivery of siRNA-Based Therapeutics Employing Nano-Vehicles for Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

For patients treated with ADT, >80% were treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist with or without a nonsteroidal antiandrogen.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Biochemical failure (BF), distant metastasis (DM), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and overall mortality were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and propensity score analysis.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 144 patients (21%) received ADT with post-RP RT, most of whom had high-risk disease features such as Gleason score 8-10, seminal vesicle invasion, or pre-RT prostate-specific antigen >1 ng/ml. Median ADT duration was 12 mo (interquartile range: 6.0-23.7). Patients who received <12 mo of ADT had an association with increased BF (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.27; p=0.003) and DM (HR: 2.48; p=0.03) compared with patients receiving ≥12 mo of ADT. The 5-yr rates of DM were 6.0% and 23% for ≥12 and <12 mo of ADT, respectively. On propensity score analysis controlling for pretreatment and treatment-related factors, each month of ADT was associated with a decreased risk for BF (HR: 0.95; p=0.0004), DM (HR: 0.88; p=0.0004), and PCSM (HR: 0.90; p=0.037). These findings are limited by the retrospective nature of our analysis.  Conclusions:   For men with high-risk disease features receiving ADT with post-RP RT, the duration of ADT is associated with clinical outcomes. Our findings suggest that for these men an extended course of ADT ≥12 mo may be preferable. Validation of our findings is needed.  Patient summary:   We evaluated outcomes for men with high-risk disease features treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy. Longer durations of ADT resulted in improved patient outcomes.""","""['William C Jackson', 'Matthew J Schipper', 'Skyler B Johnson', 'Corey Foster', 'Darren Li', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Ganesh S Palapattu', 'Daniel A Hamstra', 'Felix Y Feng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy: Whether and How Long to Give Concurrent Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Re: William C.

The clock analysis showed that group V appeared earlier than group IV, which was earlier than group III, which was earlier than group I and II in the evolution. Group I involves in colorectal, lung, breast, pancreatic, gastric, colon, bladder and ovarian cancers. Group II affects bladder, breast, lung, gastric, colorectal, prostate, esophageal, renal, head and neck cancers. Group III affects bladder and breast cancer. The function of group IV and V has not been reported.  Results:   When HT1376 bladder cancer cells were transfected with Cx31.9 (Group IV), the growth rate was inhibited by 17%. Inversely, when HT1376 cells were transfected with Cx31.9 RNAi, the growth rate was increased by 21%. For Cx23 (Group V), it could not affect the growth rate.

We assessed the effectiveness of retreatment for painful bone metastases in terms of pain relief in everyday clinical practice and identified factors associated with response.  Materials and methods:   We carried out a single-institution 10 year retrospective cohort study among 247 patients retreated for painful bone metastases. Response was defined as a decrease in pain between 2 and 12 weeks after retreatment. The overall pain response rate was calculated in an evaluable-patients-only analysis and a worst-case analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with pain response.  Results:   A follow-up of ≥2 weeks was available in 162 of 247 patients (65%). The overall pain response was 66% (95% confidence interval 58-73%) in an evaluable-patients-only analysis and 43% (95% confidence interval 37-50%) in a worst-case analysis. Response to first irradiation (odds ratio 2.16, P = 0.049) and use of systemic therapy (odds ratio 0.39, P = 0.037) were independently associated with the response to retreatment. The median overall survival was 7.1 months.  Conclusion:   In everyday clinical practice, retreatment for painful bone metastases leads to pain reduction in 66% of evaluable patients and 43% of patients in a worst-case analysis.

Our study population included 381 men who had undergone at least one ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy whose pathologic examination yielded PCa or showed no evidence of prostatic malignancy. Serial PSA, fPSA, and proPSA measurements were performed on serum samples covering 7 years prior to biopsy using Beckmann Coulter Access immunoassays. Afterwards, velocities of PSA (PSAV), fPSA% (fPSA%V), proPSA% (proPSA%V) and the ratio proPSA/PSA/V were calculated and their ability to discriminate cancer from benign disease was evaluated. Among 381 men included in the study, 202 (53%) were diagnosed with PCa and underwent radical prostatectomy at our Department. PSAV, fPSA%V, proPSA%V as well as proPSA/PSA/V were able to differentiate significantly between PCa and non-cancerous prostate. The highest discriminatory power between cancer and benign disease has been observed two and one year prior to diagnosis with all measured parameters. Among all measured parameters, fPSA%V showed the best cancer specificity of 45.3% with 90% of sensitivity.

Patients and methods:   Between May 2007 and December 2009, 30 patients with localized PCa were treated with 3-dimensional conformal external-beam radiotherapy. Fifteen patients had received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy using a leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analog for six months prior to radiotherapy. The cytokine levels were collectively measured using a multiplex assay system.  Results:   Seventeen cytokines were at detectable levels throughout the blood sampling times before and during radiotherapy. Hormonal therapy for six months significantly decreased the serum levels of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) significantly increased during radiotherapy. Most cytokine levels, except for eotaxin, G-CSF, growth-related oncogene (GRO), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ)-1 and TGFβ2, significantly increased during radiotherapy compared to the levels observed before radiotherapy.  Conclusion:   The present study revealed the influence of hormonal, and of radiation therapy on the proinflammatory cytokine levels in the sera of patients with PCa.

We reported that radiosensitization by a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) was highly prominent in prostate cancer cells expressing the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion protein. Here, we show that TMPRSS2-ERG blocks nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair by inhibiting DNA-PKcs. VCaP cells, which harbor TMPRSS2-ERG and PC3 cells that stably express it, displayed γH2AX and 53BP1 foci constitutively, indicating persistent DNA damage that was absent if TMPRSS2-ERG was depleted by siRNA in VCaP cells. The extent of DNA damage was enhanced and associated with TMPRSS2-ERG's ability to inhibit DNA-PKcs function, as indicated by its own phosphorylation (Thr2609, Ser2056) and that of its substrate, Ser1778-53BP1. DNA-PKcs deficiency caused by TMPRSS2-ERG destabilized critical NHEJ components on chromatin. Thus, XRCC4 was not recruited to chromatin, with retention of other NHEJ core factors being reduced. DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation was restored to the level of parental cells when TMPRSS2-ERG was depleted by siRNA. Following IR, TMPRSS2-ERG-expressing PC3 cells had elevated Rad51 foci and homologous recombination (HR) activity, indicating that HR compensated for defective NHEJ in these cells, hence addressing why TMPRSS2-ERG alone did not lead to radiosensitization.

Methods:   Dose distributions planned with ADC were compared with delivered dose distributions as determined by Monte Carlo simulations. A total of 50 patients were investigated in this analysis with 10 patients per site for 5 treatment sites (head and neck, lung, breast, prostate, liver). Differences were evaluated using dosimetric indices based on a dose-volume histogram analysis, a γ-index analysis, and estimations of TCP.  Results:   We found that ADC overestimated the target doses on average by 1% to 2% for all patients considered. The mean dose, D95, D50, and D02 (the dose value covering 95%, 50% and 2% of the target volume, respectively) were predicted within 5% of the delivered dose. The γ-index passing rate for target volumes was above 96% for a 3%/3 mm criterion. Differences in TCP were up to 2%, 2.5%, 6%, 6.5%, and 11% for liver and breast, prostate, head and neck, and lung patients, respectively. Differences in normal tissue complication probabilities for bladder and anterior rectum of prostate patients were less than 3%.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that current dose calculation algorithms lead to underdosage of the target by as much as 5%, resulting in differences in TCP of up to 11%. To ensure full target coverage, advanced dose calculation methods like Monte Carlo simulations may be necessary in proton therapy. Monte Carlo simulations may also be required to avoid biases resulting from systematic discrepancies in calculated dose distributions for clinical trials comparing proton therapy with conventional radiation therapy.""","""['Jan Schuemann', 'Drosoula Giantsoudi', 'Clemens Grassberger', 'Maryam Moteabbed', 'Chul Hee Min', 'Harald Paganetti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Validation and application of a fast Monte Carlo algorithm for assessing the clinical impact of approximations in analytical dose calculations for pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'Radiobiological and dosimetric impact of RayStation pencil beam and Monte Carlo algorithms on intensity-modulated proton therapy breast cancer plans.', 'Comparison of Monte Carlo and analytical dose computations for intensity modulated proton therapy.', 'Quality of Life and Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Proton Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Radiation Therapy Intensification for Solid Tumors: A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials.', 'An evaluation of the use of DirectSPR images for proton planning in the RayStation treatment planning software.', 'A component method to delineate surgical spine implants for proton Monte Carlo dose calculation.', 'Improving Proton Dose Calculation Accuracy by Using Deep Learning.', 'Dual-energy CT based mass density and relative stopping power estimation for proton therapy using physics-informed deep learning.', 'CT-on-Rails Versus In-Room CBCT for Online Daily Adaptive Proton Therapy of Head-and-Neck Cancers.']"""

The severity of VDD differs with age, gender and region. Females are more severely vitamin D deficient than males. Various factors contributing towards it deficiency are linked to their housing designs, religious practices, lifestyle choices and dark skin color. The increasing incidences of breast, prostate and colon cancer among this society are also raising an alarm. The presence of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the enzyme responsible for conversion of the 25(OH)D in its active metabolite 25(OH)2D3 in extra renal tissue shows the involvement of vitamin D in other diseases like cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis etc. About 2000 genes related to various types of diseases are found to be regulated by VDRs. These genes possess vitamin D responsive elements (VDREs) in their promoters.

Multiple members of the ly-6 protein family can modulate nicotinic signaling including lynx1, lynx2, slurp-1, slurp-2 and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA). Consistent with the expression of multiple nicotinic receptors in bronchial epithelium, multiple members of the nicotinic-modulatory ly-6 proteins are expressed in lung including lynx1 and lynx2. We studied the role of lynx1 as an exemplar of the role of ly-6 proteins in lung. Our data demonstrates that lynx1 acts as a negative modulator of nicotinic signaling in normal and neoplastic lung. In normal lung lynx1 serves to limit the ability of chronic nicotine exposure to increase levels of nicotinic receptors and also serves to limit the ability of nicotine to upregulate levels of GABAA receptors in lung. In turn this allows lynx1 to limit the ability of nicotine to upregulate levels of mucin which is mediated by GABAergic signaling. This suggests that lynx1-mimetics may have potential for treatment of asthma and COPD. In that most lung cancer cells also express nicotinic receptor and lynx1 we examined the role of lynx-1 in lung cancer. Lynx1 levels are decreased in lung cancers compared to adjacent normal lung. Knockdown of lynx1 by siRNAs increased growth of lung cancer cells while expression of lynx1 in lung cancer cell decreased cell proliferation. This suggests that lynx1 is an endogenous regulator of lung cancer growth. Given that multiple small molecule negative and positive allosteric modulators of nicotinic receptors have already been developed, this suggests that lynx1 is a highly druggable target both for development of drugs that may limit lung cancer growth as well as for drugs that may be effective for asthma or COPD treatment.""","""['Xiao Wen Fu', 'Ping Fang Song', 'Eliot R Spindel']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int Immunopharmacol""","""['The ly-6 protein, lynx1, is an endogenous inhibitor of nicotinic signaling in airway epithelium.', 'Transcriptional regulation of SLURP2, a psoriasis-associated gene, is under control of IL-22 in the skin: A special reference to the nested gene LYNX1.', 'Selective actions of Lynx proteins on different nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the locust, Locusta migratoria manilensis.', 'Cholinergic Targets in Lung Cancer.', 'Three-finger snake neurotoxins and Ly6 proteins targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: pharmacological tools and endogenous modulators.', 'Exploring tumor-normal cross-talk with TranNet: role of the environment in tumor progression.', 'Ambient air pollution during pregnancy and DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood, with potential mediation of associations with infant adiposity: The Healthy Start study.', 'α9-Containing Nicotinic Receptors in Cancer.', 'Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in the Respiratory Tract.', 'SLURP-1 Controls Growth and Migration of Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells, Forming a Complex With α7-nAChR and PDGFR/EGFR Heterodimer.']"""

We present multi-institutional data on testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men with prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of hypogonadal men treated with testosterone therapy after radiation therapy for prostate cancer at 4 institutions. Serum testosterone, free testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen velocity and prostate biopsy findings were analyzed.  Results:   A total of 98 men were treated with radiation therapy. Median age was 70.0 years (range 63.0 to 74.3) at initiation of testosterone therapy. Median baseline testosterone was 209 ng/dl (range 152 to 263) and median baseline prostate specific antigen was 0.08 ng/ml (range 0.00 to 0.33).

We detected evidence for multiple independent signals at 16 regions, 12 of which contained additional newly identified significant associations. A single signal comprising a spectrum of correlated variation was observed at 39 regions; 35 of which are now described by a novel more significantly associated lead SNP, while the originally reported variant remained as the lead SNP only in 4 regions. We also confirmed two association signals in Europeans that had been previously reported only in East-Asian GWAS. Based on statistical evidence and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, we have curated and narrowed down the list of the most likely candidate causal variants for each region. Functional annotation using data from ENCODE filtered for PrCa cell lines and eQTL analysis demonstrated significant enrichment for overlap with bio-features within this set. By incorporating the novel risk variants identified here alongside the refined data for existing association signals, we estimate that these loci now explain ∼38.9% of the familial relative risk of PrCa, an 8.9% improvement over the previously reported GWAS tag SNPs. This suggests that a significant fraction of the heritability of PrCa may have been hidden during the discovery phase of GWAS, in particular due to the presence of multiple independent signals within the same region.""","""['Ali Amin Al Olama', 'Tokhir Dadaev', 'Dennis J Hazelett', 'Qiuyan Li', 'Daniel Leongamornlert', 'Edward J Saunders', 'Sarah Stephens', 'Clara Cieza-Borrella', 'Ian Whitmore', 'Sara Benlloch Garcia', 'Graham G Giles', 'Melissa C Southey', 'Liesel Fitzgerald', 'Henrik Gronberg', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Markus Aly', 'Brian E Henderson', 'Fredrick Schumacher', 'Christopher A Haiman', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Tiina Wahlfors', 'Teuvo L Tammela', 'Børge G Nordestgaard', 'Tim J Key', 'Ruth C Travis', 'David E Neal', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Paul Pharoah', 'Nora Pashayan', 'Kay-Tee Khaw', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Stephen N Thibodeau', 'Shannon K Mcdonnell', 'Daniel J Schaid', 'Christiane Maier', 'Walther Vogel', 'Manuel Luedeke', 'Kathleen Herkommer', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Cezary Cybulski', 'Dominika Wokołorczyk', 'Wojciech Kluzniak', 'Lisa Cannon-Albright', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Katja Butterbach', 'Volker Arndt', 'Jong Y Park', 'Thomas Sellers', 'Hui-Yi Lin', 'Chavdar Slavov', 'Radka Kaneva', 'Vanio Mitev', 'Jyotsna Batra', 'Judith A Clements', 'Amanda Spurdle', 'Manuel R Teixeira', 'Paula Paulo', 'Sofia Maia', 'Hardev Pandha', 'Agnieszka Michael', 'Andrzej Kierzek', 'Koveela Govindasami', 'Michelle Guy', 'Artitaya Lophatonanon', 'Kenneth Muir', 'Ana Viñuela', 'Andrew A Brown;PRACTICAL Consortium;COGS-CRUK GWAS-ELLIPSE (Part of GAME-ON) Initiative;Australian Prostate Cancer BioResource;UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study Collaborators;UK ProtecT Study Collaborators;Mathew Freedman', 'David V Conti', 'Douglas Easton', 'Gerhard A Coetzee', 'Rosalind A Eeles', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['Integration of multiethnic fine-mapping and genomic annotation to prioritize candidate functional SNPs at prostate cancer susceptibility regions.', 'Fine-mapping of prostate cancer susceptibility loci in a large meta-analysis identifies candidate causal variants.', 'An expanded variant list and assembly annotation identifies multiple novel coding and noncoding genes for prostate cancer risk using a normal prostate tissue eQTL data set.', 'Fine-mapping the HOXB region detects common variants tagging a rare coding allele: evidence for synthetic association in prostate cancer.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Association between obesity and frequency of high-grade prostate cancer on biopsy in men: A single-center retrospective study.', 'A microRNA Transcriptome-wide Association Study of Prostate Cancer Risk.', 'Novel role of prostate cancer risk variant rs7247241 on PPP1R14A isoform transition through allelic TF binding and CpG methylation.', 'H3K27ac HiChIP in prostate cell lines identifies risk genes for prostate cancer susceptibility.', 'Evolutionary selection of alleles in the melanophilin gene that impacts on prostate organ function and cancer risk.']"""

Objectives:   This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a brief PCST intervention delivered to patients in their homes using mobile health (mHealth) technology. Pre-to-post intervention changes in pain, physical functioning, physical symptoms, psychological distress, self-efficacy for pain management, and pain catastrophizing also were examined.  Methods:   Patients with a diagnosis of breast, lung, prostate, or colorectal cancer who reported persistent pain (N = 25) participated in a four-session intervention delivered using mHealth technology (videoconferencing on a tablet computer). Participants completed measures of pain, physical functioning, physical symptoms, psychological distress, self-efficacy for pain management, and pain catastrophizing. We also assessed patient satisfaction.  Results:   Participants completed an average of 3.36 (SD = 1.11) of the four intervention sessions for an overall session completion rate of 84%. Participants reported that the program was of excellent quality and met their needs. Significant preintervention to postintervention differences were found in pain, physical symptoms, psychological distress, and pain catastrophizing.  Conclusion:   The use of mHealth technology is a feasible and acceptable option for delivery of PCST for patients with cancer. This delivery mode is likely to dramatically increase intervention access for cancer patients with pain compared to traditional in-person delivery.

Results:   None of the observed 3-dimensional prostate displacements were ≥ 3 mm over the elapsed treatment time. A Gamma passing rate of 95.64 ± 4.28 % was observed between planned and delivered dose profiles on EBT3 film analysis in the low-dose region. No statistically significant differences between treatment plans with- and without-EIS were observed for rectal, bladder, clinical target volume (CTV), and PTV contours (p = 0.477, 0.484, 0.487, and 0.487, respectively). A mean rectal V80% of 1.07 cc was achieved for plans using the EIS.  Conclusions:   The EIS enables the safe delivery of brachytherapy-like SABR plans to the prostate while having minimal impact on treatment planning and rectal dosimetry.

We assessed the impact of two SMB reports on service provision (2009: Recommendation of conservative treatment as first option for rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee; 2011: Recommendation against PSA screening for prostate cancer).  Methods:   We performed an observational study and assessed quantitative data over time via interrupted times series analyses. The primary outcome was the quarterly number of performed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests and the annual rates of surgical ACL repair in patients with ACL rupture. Data were adjusted for time trends and relevant confounders.  Results:   We analysed PSA tests in 662,874 outpatients from 2005-2013 and treatment data in 101,737 patients with knee injury from 1990-2011. For the number of PSA tests, the secular trend before the intervention showed a continuous but diminishing increase over time. A statistically significant reduction in tests was estimated immediately after the intervention, but a later return to the trend before the intervention cannot be ruled out. The rate of surgical ACL repair had already declined after the late 1990s to about 55% in 2009. No relevant additional change emerged in this secular trend after the intervention.  Conclusions:   Despite some evidence of a possible change, we did not find a sustained and significant impact of SMB recommendations in our case study.

We treated PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines with the PP2A activators forskolin and FTY720 alone or combined with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid. We examined PP2A activity, cell growth, prostasphere formation, levels of PP2A phosphorylation, CIP2A and SET expression, and AKT and ERK activation. Interestingly, both forskolin and FTY720 dephosphorylated and activated PP2A, impairing proliferation and prostasphere formation and inducing changes in AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, FTY720 led to reduced CIP2A levels. Treatment with okadaic acid impaired PP2A activation thus demonstrating the antitumoral PP2A-dependent mechanism of action of both forskolin and FTY720. Levels of PP2A phosphorylation together with SET and CIP2A protein expression were studied in 24 PCa patients and both were associated with high Gleason scores and presence of metastatic disease.

Once prostate cancer patients develop skeletal metastases, they eventually succumb to the disease; therefore, it is imperative to identify key molecular drivers of this process. This study examines the involvement of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε), an oncogenic protein that is abnormally overexpressed in human tumor specimens and cell lines, on prostate cancer cell bone metastasis. PC3-ML cells, a highly invasive prostate cancer PC3 derivative with bone metastatic colonization properties, failed to induce skeletal metastatic foci upon inoculation into nude mice when PKCε expression was silenced using shRNA. Interestingly, while PKCε depletion had only marginal effects on the proliferative, adhesive, and migratory capacities of PC3-ML cells in vitro or in the growth of xenografts upon s.c. inoculation, it caused a significant reduction in cell invasiveness. Notably, PKCε was required for transendothelial cell migration (TEM) as well as for the growth of PC3-ML cells in a bone biomimetic environment. At a mechanistic level, PKCε depletion abrogates the expression of IL1β, a cytokine implicated in skeletal metastasis. Taken together, PKCε is a key factor for driving the formation of bone metastasis by prostate cancer cells and is a potential therapeutic target for advanced stages of the disease.  Implications:   This study uncovers an important new function of PKCε in the dissemination of cancer cells to the bone; thus, highlighting the promising potential of this oncogenic kinase as a therapeutic target for skeletal metastasis.""","""['Alvaro Gutierrez-Uzquiza', 'Cynthia Lopez-Haber', 'Danielle L Jernigan', 'Alessandro Fatatis', 'Marcelo G Kazanietz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Protein kinase Cepsilon interacts with signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3), phosphorylates Stat3Ser727, and regulates its constitutive activation in prostate cancer.', 'Genetic ablation of PKC epsilon inhibits prostate cancer development and metastasis in transgenic mouse model of prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Regulation of prostate cancer cell migration toward bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned medium by Wnt5a signaling.', 'Bone Marrow Microenvironment as a Regulator and Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Ecological paradigms to understand the dynamics of metastasis.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Elevated NF-κB/SHh/GLI1 Signature Denotes a Worse Prognosis and Represent a Novel Potential Therapeutic Target in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Protein Kinase C Epsilon Overexpression Is Associated With Poor Patient Outcomes in AML and Promotes Daunorubicin Resistance Through p-Glycoprotein-Mediated Drug Efflux.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

Methods:   The optimizer was a simple genetic algorithm (SGA) that, given a set of prostate and urethra contours, determines the optimal seed distribution in terms of coverage of the prostate with the prescribed dose while avoiding hotspots within the urethra. The algorithm was validated in a retrospective study on 45 previously contoured low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy patients. Dosimetric indices were evaluated to ensure solutions adhered to clinical standards. The SGA performance was further benchmarked by comparing solutions obtained from a commercial optimizer (inverse planning simulated annealing [IPSA]) with the same cohort of 45 patients.  Results:   Clinically acceptable target coverage by the prescribed dose (V100) was obtained for both SGA and IPSA, with a mean ± standard deviation of 98 ± 2% and 99.5 ± 0.5%, respectively. For the prostate D90, SGA and IPSA yielded 177 ± 8 Gy and 186 ± 7 Gy, respectively, which were both clinically acceptable. Both algorithms yielded reasonable dose to the rectum, with V100 < 0.3 cc. A reduction in dose to the urethra was seen using SGA. SGA solutions showed a slight prostate volume dependence, with smaller prostates (<25 cc) yielding less desirable, although still clinically viable, dosimetric outcomes. SGA plans used, on average, fewer needles than IPSA (21 vs. 24, respectively), which may lead to a reduction in urinary toxicity and edema that alters post-implant dosimetry.

This extra glycosylation site of PSA is associated with a mutation in KLK3 genes. Among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of KLKs families, the rs61752561 in KLK3 genes is an unusual missense mutation resulting in the conversion of D102 to N in PSA amino acid sequence. Accordingly, a new N-linked glycosylation site is created with an N102MS motif. Here we report the first qualitative and quantitative glycoproteomic study of PSA N102 glycosylation site by LC-MS/MS.

Radium-223 dichloride (radium-223 [Xofigo]) is a first-in-class α-emitting radiopharmaceutical shown to significantly prolong overall survival in patients with CRPC with symptomatic bone metastases and no visceral metastases. Current treatment guidelines recommended it in both pre- and post-docetaxel settings.  Areas covered:   Radium-223 mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and key efficacy and safety data are reviewed. The evaluation of adverse events reported in the Phase III ALSYMPCA trial is summarized for the overall population and patient subpopulations (prior docetaxel, concomitant external beam radiation therapy and baseline opioid use). An evaluation of how radium-223 is being incorporated into the CRPC treatment paradigm and the implications of its safety profile for future use are provided.  Expert opinion:   The pronounced efficacy and safety profile of radium-223 positions it as a valuable new therapeutic tool in the CRPC armamentarium. Its novel mechanism of action underlies low rates of hematologic adverse events.

The aim is to gain more findings by means of comparative studies.  Problem:   Based on the non-availability of clinical primary data of a methodologically acceptable level, it was analysed to what extent secondary data of the SHI may be used in order to arrive at valid conclusions for benefit aspects.  Methods:   As base approx. 8 million insured of TK with their data of cost reimbursement between 2006 and 2011 were considered. In SHI secondary data no clinical information regarding tumour stage and other prognostic factors are available. Therefore, a novel method with therapy-specific multisectoral inclusion and exclusion criteria, respectively, was developed in order to differentiate between localised and advanced tumours of the prostate. Overall survival, relapse-free survival, event-free survival and side-effects associated to prostate cancer were analysed.  Results:   Out of 87 822 insured persons with the diagnosis prostate cancer, 795 with PBT, 10 936 with RP and 1 925 with EBRT were investigated in detail. The 4-year event-free survival rate was 73% for RP, 77% for PBT and 71% for EBRT. Many prostate cancer-specific side effects appeared already before intervention. Side effects of the intestinal tract (23.8%) and sexual impairments (26.5%) were more frequent for EBRT than for RP (17.1%/14.8%) and PBT (16.4%/13.2%).  Conclusion:   By means of SHI secondary data and adequate operationalisation important findings regarding relevant aspects of prostate cancer in healthcare research can be generated. However, these hold methodological limitations and are not suited to draw valid conclusions for benefit assessment. Based solely on SHI routine data valid statements regarding comparative benefit assessment are limited. Limitations could be reduced by applying a record linkage with clinical data. Such primary data should include information on tumour stages as well as therapy assignment and observation of survival time.""","""['D Horenkamp-Sonntag', 'R Linder', 'S Engel', 'F Verheyen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Gesundheitswesen""","""['Challenges in the Analysis of Outcomes for Surgical Compared to Radiotherapy Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Benefit assessment by the Federal Joint Committee: assessment of treatment strategies for low risk prostate cancer.', 'Brachytherapy provides comparable outcomes and improved cost-effectiveness in the treatment of low/intermediate prostate cancer.', 'Brachytherapy for prostate cancer: a systematic review of clinical and cost effectiveness.', 'Valorisation of brachytherapy and medico-economic considerations.', 'Individual Data Linkage of Survey Data with Claims Data in Germany-An Overview Based on a Cohort Study.']"""

TGF-β could upregulate periostin expression in some cells, and both TGF-β and periostin could induce epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). We aimed to study the effect of periostin in the process of TGF-β-induced EMT in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   We constructed a lentivirus vector containing the periostin gene and transduced it into PC3 and DU145 cells. After confirming periostin overexpression by PCR and Western blotting, we used an MTT assay to establish a growth curve to measure cell proliferation. Additionally, we performed transwell and wound healing assays to measure cell invasion and migration, respectively. Lastly, we measured the expression of EMT associated factors using Western blot analysis to test the effect of periostin on EMT in prostate cancer cells.  Results:   PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed that periostin was upregulated after infection with the periostin lentiviral vector. Periostin overexpression promoted increased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration as measured by MTT, transwell, and wound healing assays, respectively. Western blot analysis illustrated that periostin overexpression increased the expression of EMT associated factors, and periostin overexpression activated Akt and GSK-3β, which could be inhibited using a PI3K inhibitor. Additionally, TGF-β increased the levels of STAT3, Twist1 and periostin, while both STAT3 shRNA and Twist1 shRNA inhibited periostin expression. However, STAT3 shRNA also decreased Twist1 expression. Although reduction of STAT3, Twist1 or periostin levels with shRNA inhibited TGF-β-induced overexpression of EMT associated factors, periostin overexpression could reverse such inhibition by interfering with STAT3 and Twist1. Similarly, periostin overexpression also reversed inhibition of cell invasion induced by interference of STAT3 and Twist1.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicate that periostin is an important mediator of TGF-β-induced EMT and suggest that periostin is a potential therapeutic target for suppressing the metastatic progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Qingfeng Hu', 'Shijun Tong', 'Xiaojun Zhao', 'Weihong Ding', 'Yuancheng Gou', 'Ke Xu', 'Chuanyu Sun', 'Guowei Xia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['A ROS/STAT3/HIF-1α signaling cascade mediates EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'AKT/GSK-3β regulates stability and transcription of snail which is crucial for bFGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells.', 'STAT3 mediates TGF-β1-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer invasion.', 'Aberrant Activation Mechanism of TGF-β Signaling in Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Prostate Cancer.', 'Periostin: biology and function in cancer.', 'Matricellular Protein Periostin Promotes Pericyte Migration in Fibrotic Airways.', 'Tumor- and Osteoblast-Derived Periostin in Prostate Cancer bone Metastases.', 'Genomic and transcriptomic characterization of heterogeneous immune subgroups of microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancers.', 'Periostin in Allergy and Inflammation.']"""

The patients included had metastatic or unresectable solid tumors and had exhausted standard treatment. Cohorts of three to six patients received cabazitaxel (15-20 mg/m) before (part 1a) or after (part 1b) gemcitabine (700-1000 mg/m) on Day 1 and gemcitabine alone on Day 8. Prophylactic growth factors were not allowed in cycle 1. In part 1a (n=12), five patients received 20 mg/m cabazitaxel plus 1000 mg/m gemcitabine (20/1000), five received 15/900, two received 15/700. In part 1b, all six patients received the lowest dose (700/15).

The MTD was not established as all cohorts exceeded the MTD by definition. All patients experienced an adverse event; the most frequent all-grade nonhematologic events were fatigue (66.7%), decreased appetite (50.0%), and diarrhea (44.4%). The most frequent grade 3-4 hematologic abnormalities were neutropenia (83.3%), leukopenia (77.8%), and lymphopenia (72.2%). Toxicity was sequence-independent but appeared worse with gemcitabine followed by cabazitaxel.

More precise information is needed for making treatment decisions to distinguish aggressive cases from indolent disease, for which heritable factors could be a useful tool. The genetic makeup of PrCa has only recently begun to be unravelled through large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The thus far identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) explain, however, only a fraction of familial clustering. Moreover, the known risk SNPs are not associated with the clinical outcome of the disease, such as aggressive or metastasised disease, and therefore cannot be used to predict the prognosis. Annotating the SNPs with deep clinical data together with miRNA expression profiles can improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of different phenotypes of prostate cancer.  Results:   In this study microRNA (miRNA) profiles were studied as potential biomarkers to predict the disease outcome. The study subjects were from Finnish high risk prostate cancer families. To identify potential biomarkers we combined a novel non-parametrical test with an importance measure provided from a Random Forest classifier. This combination delivered a set of nine miRNAs that was able to separate cases from controls. The detected miRNA expression profiles could predict the development of the disease years before the actual PrCa diagnosis or detect the existence of other cancers in the studied individuals. Furthermore, using an expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis, regulatory SNPs for miRNA miR-483-3p that were also directly associated with PrCa were found.  Conclusion:   Based on our findings, we suggest that blood-based miRNA expression profiling can be used in the diagnosis and maybe even prognosis of the disease. In the future, miRNA profiling could possibly be used in targeted screening, together with Prostate Specific Antigene (PSA) testing, to identify men with an elevated PrCa risk.""","""['Daniel Fischer', 'Tiina Wahlfors', 'Henna Mattila', 'Hannu Oja', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Johanna Schleutker']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['regQTLs: Single nucleotide polymorphisms that modulate microRNA regulation of gene expression in tumors.', 'Expressional profiling of prostate cancer risk SNPs at 11q13.5 identifies DGAT2 as a new target gene.', 'A Large-Scale Analysis of Genetic Variants within Putative miRNA Binding Sites in Prostate Cancer.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Recent scenario of microRNA as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Minor Intron Splicing from Basic Science to Disease.', 'On linear dimension reduction based on diagonalization of scatter matrices for bioinformatics downstream analyses.', 'The Glucose-Regulated MiR-483-3p Influences Key Signaling Pathways in Cancer.', 'Role of miR-483 in digestive tract cancers: from basic research to clinical value.']"""

An optimization-based reconstruction involves numerous parameters, which can significantly impact reconstruction properties (or utility). The success of an optimization-based reconstruction for a particular class of practical applications thus relies strongly on appropriate selection of parameter values. In the work, we focus on tailoring the constrained-TV-minimization-based reconstruction, an optimization-based reconstruction previously shown of some potential for CBCT imaging conditions of practical interest, to OBI imaging through appropriate selection of parameter values. In particular, for given real data of phantoms and patient collected with OBI CBCT, we first devise utility metrics specific to OBI-quality-assurance tasks and then apply them to guiding the selection of parameter values in constrained-TV-minimization-based reconstruction.

Recent studies revealed that JGT exhibited potent inhibitory effects on allergies, inflammation, pain, convulsions, and prostate hyperplasia. Several constituent herbs in JGT induce apoptotic cancer cell death. However, the anti-cancer activity of JGT has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of JGT using highly tumorigenic HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In addition, we examined whether the Lactobacillus fermentation of JGT enhanced its anti-cancer activity using an in vivo xenograft model because fermentation of herbal extracts is thought to strengthen their therapeutic effects. Data revealed that JGT suppressed the growth of cancer cells efficiently by stimulating G1 cell cycle arrest and then inducing apoptotic cell death by causing mitochondrial damage and activating caspases. The phosphorylation of p38 and ERK also played a role in JGT-induced cell death. In vitro experiments demonstrated that JGT fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus, designated fJGT162, elicited similar patterns of cell death as did non-fermented JGT. Meanwhile, the daily oral administration of 120 mg/kg fJGT162 to HT1080-bearing BALB/c nude mice suppressed tumor growth dramatically (up to 90%) compared with saline treatment, whereas the administration of non-fermented JGT suppressed tumor growth by ~70%. Collectively, these results suggest that JGT and fJGT162 are safe and useful complementary and alternative anti-cancer herbal therapies, and that Lactobacillus fermentation improves the in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of JGT significantly.""","""['Aeyung Kim', 'Minju Im', 'Youn-Hwan Hwang', 'Hye Jin Yang', 'Jin Yeul Ma']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Fermented So-Cheong-Ryong-Tang (FCY) induces apoptosis via the activation of caspases and the regulation of MAPK signaling pathways in cancer cells.', 'A novel herbal medicine, KIOM-C, induces autophagic and apoptotic cell death mediated by activation of JNK and reactive oxygen species in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells.', 'Isatis indigotica induces hepatocellular cancer cell death via caspase-independent apoptosis-inducing factor translocation apoptotic pathway in vitro and in vivo.', 'Guibitang, a traditional herbal medicine, induces apoptotic death in A431 cells by regulating the activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases.', 'Traditional Chinese medicine Ze-Qi-Tang formula inhibit growth of non-small-cell lung cancer cells through the p53 pathway.', 'Social Isolation Activates Dormant Mammary Tumors, and Modifies Inflammatory and Mitochondrial Metabolic Pathways in the Rat Mammary Gland.', 'Leaf extract of Osbeckia octandra induces apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'Enhanced production of compound K in fermented ginseng extracts by Lactobacillus brevis.', 'Lycopene Inhibits Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated NF-κB Signaling and Induces Apoptosis in Pancreatic Cancer Cells.', 'Anti-Neuroinflammatory Effect of Jaeumganghwa-Tang in an Animal Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.']"""

We now show that FGF23 is expressed as an autocrine growth factor in all prostate cancer cell lines tested and is present at increased levels in prostate cancer tissues. Exogenous FGF23 enhances proliferation, invasion and anchorage independent growth in vitro while FGF23 knockdown in prostate cancer cell lines decreases these phenotypes. FGF23 knockdown also decreases tumor growth in vivo. Given that classical FGFs and FGF19 are also increased in prostate cancer, we analyzed expression microarrays hybridized with RNAs from of LNCaP cells stimulated with FGF2, FGF19 or FGF23. The different FGF ligands induce overlapping as well as unique patterns of gene expression changes and thus are not redundant. We identified multiple genes whose expression is altered by FGF23 that are associated with prostate cancer initiation and progression.

However, angiogenesis may be increased in one tissue but decreased in another in the same patient at the same time point in the disease. The mechanisms of aberrant angiogenesis in diabetes are not understood. There are no selective therapeutic approaches to target increased neovascularization without affecting physiologic angiogenesis and angiogenesis in ischemic tissues. We recently reported a novel miRNA-dependent pathway that up-regulates angiogenesis in response to hyperglycemia in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. The goal of the work described herein was to test whether systemic administration of an antagonist of miR-467 would prevent hyperglycemia-induced local angiogenesis in a tissue-specific manner. We examined the effect of the antagonist on hyperglycemia-induced tumor growth and angiogenesis and on skin wound healing in mouse models of diabetes. Our data demonstrated that the systemic injection of the antagonist prevented hyperglycemia-induced angiogenesis and growth of mouse and human breast cancer tumors, where the miR-467 pathway was active in hyperglycemia. In tissues where the miR-467-dependent mechanism was not activated by hyperglycemia, there was no effect of the antagonist: the systemic injection did not affect skin wound healing or the growth of prostate tumors.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in identifying occult lymph node metastases following neoadjuvant hormone treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods and results:   One hundred and twenty-eight lymph nodes from 24 patients treated with neoadjuvant hormone therapy, including abiraterone acetate alone or combined with leuprolide, were stained with antibodies against keratin AE1/AE3, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate-specific acid phosphatase (PrAP), androgen receptor (AR), and NKX3.1. IHC slides were scored 'blind', and then retrospectively compared with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides and pathology reports. IHC identified carcinoma in six lymph nodes from three patients. All metastases were positive for NKX3.1 and AR, five of six were positive for AE1/AE3, and three of six were positive for PSA; PrAP was negative in all metastatic foci. All six lymph node metastases had been identified by H&E staining at the time of RP.

Although operative fistula repair remains the most successful treatment, there still is no consensus concerning the management of RUF. We present first experiences and transanal surgical technique using biological mesh for fistula repair after urological intervention.  Material and methods:   From January 2009 to December 2013, four cases of RUF were reported at our university hospital. Fistula occurred after extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, open radical prostatectomy, and high-intensity focused ultrasound, respectively. All patients were initially treated with transanal Cook Biodesign™ mesh, whereas two patients received reoperation with rectal mucosa advancement flap and gracilis muscle flap interposition, respectively. Mean follow-up was 36 months (range 9-62).  Results:   Fistula diameters ranged from 0.6 to 3.0 cm and were located 5 to 6 cm of anocutaneous line. The time from diagnosis to fistula repair was 3 to 7 weeks. The median operative time for Cook Biodesing™ mesh procedure was 79 min (IQR 60, 98). The initial success rate for biological mesh was 50 % (2/4 patients). Larger fistulae were minimalized successfully and finally closed with reoperation mentioned above. No deterioration of continence was documented.  Conclusions:   Management of rectourinary fistula is still challenging. Using biomaterials for fistula closure seems to be a promising and minimally invasive transanal technique in future. Further analysis including more patients is needed to clarify its exact role in comparison to traditional surgical techniques.""","""['M Gierth', 'S Denzinger', 'G Liebig-Hörl', 'M Burger', 'A Fürst']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Colorectal Dis""","""['Mid term functional results following surgical treatment of recto-urinary fistulas postprostate cancer treatment.', 'Anterior transanal, transsphincteric sagittal approach for fistula repair secondary to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a simple and effective technique.', 'Minimally Invasive Transanal Repair of Rectourethral Fistulas.', 'Laparoscopic urorectal fistula repair: value of the salvage prostatectomy and review of current approaches.', 'Surgical treatment of rectourinary fistulas: review of the literature.', 'Use of biological mesh in trans-anal treatment for recurrent recto-urethral fistula.', 'Transanal endoscopic surgery for complications of prior rectal surgery.']"""

Further, we determined that higher levels of TMPRSS2 expression correlate with higher levels of matriptase activation in prostate cancer tissues. Lastly, we found that the ability of TMPRSS2 to promote prostate cancer tumor growth and metastasis was associated with increased matriptase activation and enhanced degradation of extracellular matrix nidogen-1 and laminin β1 in tumor xenografts.

We investigated whether TMFol may have preclinical features superior to those of its two flavonol congeners.  Methods:   The ability of the three flavonols to compromise prostate cancer cell survival was tested in four prostate cancer cell types 22Rv1, TRAMP C2, PC-3 and LNCaP. The effect of TMFol on prostate cancer development in vivo was investigated in nude mice bearing the 22Rv1 or TRAMP C2 tumours.  Results:   TMFol inhibited cell growth in vitro in all four prostate cancer cell types more potently than fisetin and quercetin. It also interfered with TRAMP C2 tumour development in vivo, while fisetin and quercetin at equivalent doses were without activity in this model. Likewise, TMFol slowed the growth of the 22Rv1 tumour in vivo. Efficacy in either model was accompanied by induction of apoptosis, although in vitro only TRAMP C2 cells, but not 22Rv1, underwent apoptosis when exposed to TMFol.

Objective:   The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of bisbibenzyl compounds riccardin C (RC), marchantin M (MM), and riccardin D (RD) on androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer (PCa) cells.  Materials and methods:   After exposure to 10 μM of the compounds for 24 h, cell cycle and cell survival analyses were performed using FACS and MTT assay to confirm the effect of these bisbibenzyls on PCa LNCaP cells. Changes in the AR expression and function, as the result of exposure to the compounds, were investigated using real-time PCR, ELISA, transient transfection, western blotting (WB), immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence staining (IF). Chemical-induced autophagy was examined by WB, IF, and RNAi.  Results:   RC, MM, and RD reduced the viability of LNCaP cells accompanied with arrested cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and induction of apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that these compounds significantly inhibited AR expression at mRNA and protein levels, leading to the suppression of AR transcriptional activity. Moreover, inhibition of proteasome activity by bisbibenzyls, which in turn caused the induction of autophagy, as noted by induction of LC3B expression, conversion, and accumulation of punctate dots in treated cells. Co-localization of AR/LC3B and AR/Ub suggested that autophagy contributed to the degradation of polyubiquitinated-AR when proteasome activity was suppressed by the bisbibenzyls.

A complicating factor is the presence of a metallic prosthesis in the femur and pelvis, which is becoming more common in elderly populations. The goal of this work was to perform dose measurements to check the accuracy of radiotherapy treatment planning under these complicated conditions. To accomplish this, a scale phantom of an adult pelvic region was used with alanine dosimeters inserted in the prostate region. This phantom was irradiated according to the planned treatment under the following three conditions: with two metallic prostheses in the region of the femur head, with only one prosthesis, and without any prostheses. The combined relative standard uncertainty of dose measurement by electron spin resonance (ESR)/alanine was 5.05%, whereas the combined relative standard uncertainty of the applied dose was 3.35%, resulting in a combined relative standard uncertainty of the whole process of 6.06%. The ESR dosimetry indicated that there was no difference (P>0.05, ANOVA) in dosage between the planned dose and treatments. The results are in the range of the planned dose, within the combined relative uncertainty, demonstrating that the treatment-planning system compensates for the effects caused by the presence of femur and hip metal prostheses.""","""['G G Alves', 'A Kinoshita', 'H F de Oliveira', 'F S Guimarães', 'L L Amaral', 'O Baffa']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Braz J Med Biol Res""","""['In vivo dosimetry in the urethra using alanine/ESR during (192)Ir HDR brachytherapy of prostate cancer--a phantom study.', 'Uncertainties in alanine/ESR dosimetry at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt.', 'Verification of the pure alanine in PMMA tube dosimeter applicability for dosimetry of radiotherapy photon beams: a feasibility study.', 'Medical reference dosimetry using EPR measurements of alanine: development of an improved method for clinical dose levels.', 'Dose uncertainty in radiotherapy of patients with head and neck cancer measured by in vivo ESR/alanine dosimetry using a mouthpiece.']"""

We investigate whether clopidogrel, a widely used thienopyridine derivative, was associated with increased risk of cancer-specific or all-cause mortality in cancer patients.  Methods:   Colorectal, breast and prostate cancer patients, newly diagnosed from 1998 to 2009, were identified from the National Cancer Data Repository. Cohorts were linked to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, providing prescription records, and to the Office of National Statistics mortality data (up to 2012). Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer-specific and all-cause mortality in post-diagnostic clopidogrel users were calculated using time-dependent Cox regression models.  Results:   The analysis included 10 359 colorectal, 17 889 breast and 13 155 prostate cancer patients. There was no evidence of an increase in cancer-specific mortality in clopidogrel users with colorectal (HR = 0.98 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77, 1.24) or prostate cancer (HR = 1.03 95%CI 0.82, 1.28). There was limited evidence of an increase in breast cancer patients (HR = 1.22 95%CI 0.90, 1.65); however, this was attenuated when removing prescriptions in the year prior to death.

Breast was the primary site in 67,5% of cases, prostate and lung--in 7,5% each, renal--in 5,5%, other tumors--in 12%. The most frequent treatment site was the spine--47,8%, followed by pelvis--30,8%, long bones--14,4%, sacrum--2,9% and other sites--4%.

Experimental design:   FGFR1 status, expression levels, and BGJ398 sensitive growth were measured in 12 HNSCC cell lines.

Results:   Cell line sensitivity to BGJ398 is associated with FGFR1 mRNA and protein levels, not FGFR1 CNG. Thirty-one percent of primary HNSCC tumors expressed FGFR1 mRNA, 18% exhibited FGFR1 CNG, 35% of amplified tumors were also positive for FGFR1 mRNA.

While we and others have investigated the role of SOX4 overexpression in PCa, the molecular mechanism underlying its aberrant expression remains unclear.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry were utilized to detect SOX4 expression and the correlation between estrogen receptor β (ERβ), androgen receptor (AR) and SOX4 in a cohort of 94 clinical specimens. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to study the transcript and protein expression levels. Immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to assess the interaction and subcellular location of ERβ and AR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and Luciferase reporter assays were performed to explore the binding and transcriptional activities of ERβ and AR to the SOX4 promoter. Cellular function was evaluated by MTS, invasion and wound healing assays.  Results:   SOX4 expression is up-regulated in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) tumors compared to hormone-dependent PCa (HDPC) cases. Increased expression was also observed in PCa cells after long-term androgen-deprivation treatment (ADT). In vitro data indicated that SOX4 is an AR transcriptional target and down-regulated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) via AR. 17β-estradiol (E2) up-regulates SOX4 expression in the absence of androgen through the formation of a protein complex between ERβ and AR. Knockdown of AR or ERβ blocks the E2-induced SOX4 expression. ChIP assays confirmed that both ERβ and AR bind to the SOX4 promoter in response to E2. Functionally, silencing SOX4 significantly attenuates the proliferative effect, as well as the capacity of migration and invasion of E2 on PCa cells. Clinically, overexpression of SOX4 is significantly associated with ERβ expression in PCa. In addition, this association is still retained in CRPC patients with poor prognosis.

Machine learning algorithms can assist in image interpretation when reliable training data exist. In most cases, however, knowledge about ground truth (e.g. histology) and thus training data is limited, which makes application of machine learning algorithms difficult. The purpose of this study was to design and implement a learning algorithm for classification of multidimensional medical imaging data that is robust and accurate even with limited prior knowledge and that allows for generalization and application to unseen data. Local prostate cancer was chosen as a model for application and validation. 16 patients underwent combined simultaneous [(11) C]-choline positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI. The following imaging parameters were acquired: T2 signal intensities, apparent diffusion coefficients, parameters Ktrans and Kep from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and PET standardized uptake values (SUVs). A spatially constrained fuzzy c-means algorithm (sFCM) was applied to the single datasets and the resulting labeled data were used for training of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Accuracy and false positive and false negative rates of the proposed algorithm were determined in comparison with manual tumor delineation. For five of the 16 patients rates were also determined in comparison with the histopathological standard of reference. The combined sFCM/SVM algorithm proposed in this study revealed reliable classification results consistent with the histopathological reference standard and comparable to those of manual tumor delineation. sFCM/SVM generally performed better than unsupervised sFCM alone. We observed an improvement in accuracy with increasing number of imaging parameters used for clustering and SVM training. In particular, including PET SUVs as an additional parameter markedly improved classification results. A variety of applications are conceivable, especially for imaging of tissues without easily available histopathological correlation.""","""['Sergios Gatidis', 'Markus Scharpf', 'Petros Martirosian', 'Ilja Bezrukov', 'Thomas Küstner', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Stephan Kruck', 'Sascha Kaufmann', 'Christina Schraml', 'Christian la Fougère', 'Nina F Schwenzer', 'Holger Schmidt']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['Kernel-based learning from both qualitative and quantitative labels: application to prostate cancer diagnosis based on multiparametric MR imaging.', 'A novel fuzzy C-means algorithm for unsupervised heterogeneous tumor quantification in PET.', 'A fully automatic computer aided diagnosis system for peripheral zone prostate cancer detection using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Whole-body simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET)-MR: optimization and adaptation of MRI sequences.', 'Multiparametric imaging with simultaneous MRI/PET: Methodological aspects and possible clinical applications.', 'Radiomics and artificial intelligence in prostate cancer: new tools for molecular hybrid imaging and theragnostics.', 'A systematic review of the applications of Expert Systems (ES) and machine learning (ML) in clinical urology.', 'A review of the application of machine learning in molecular imaging.', 'PET/MRI in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Automatic classification of tissues on pelvic MRI based on relaxation times and support vector machine.']"""

Thus, in the present study, the apoptotic mechanism of gallotannin was elucidated in DU145, PC-3, and M2182 prostate cancer cells in association with myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) signaling. Gallotannin exerted dose-dependent cytotoxicity in DU145, PC-3, and M2182 prostate cancer cells. Also, gallotannin showed apoptotic morphological features and increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling positive cells and sub-G1 accumulation in three prostate cancer cell lines. Consistently, gallotannin cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and attenuated the expression of procaspases 9 and 3 in three prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, gallotannin attenuated the expression of survival genes such as Mcl-1, B-cell lymphoma 2, and B-cell lymphoma 2 extra large in three prostate cancer cell lines. Interestingly, overexpression of Mcl-1 reversed the ability of gallotannin to cleave PARP and increase sub-G1 population in three prostate cancer cell lines. Conversely, silencing of Mcl-1 enhanced apoptosis by gallotannin in three prostate cancer cell lines by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

Instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) into the urinary bladder after TURBT (adjuvant intravesical administration) reduces the risk of both recurrence and progression, and this is therefore the standard of care for high-risk tumours. However, over 30 % of people still recur or progress despite optimal delivery of BCG. Our meta-analysis suggests that outcomes might be improved further by using an adjuvant intravesical regimen that includes both mitomycin and BCG. These promising findings require corroboration in a definitive, large scale, randomised phase III trial using standard techniques for intravesical administration.  Methods and design:   The BCG + MMC trial (ANZUP 1301) is an open-label, randomised, stratified, two-arm multi-centre phase III trial comparing the efficacy and safety of standard intravesical therapy (BCG alone) against experimental intravesical therapy (BCG and mitomycin) in the treatment of adults with resected, high-risk NMIBC. Participants in the control group receive standard treatment with induction (weekly BCG for six weeks) followed by maintenance (four-weekly BCG for ten months). Participants in the experimental group receive induction (BCG weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8; mitomycin weeks 3, 6, and 9) followed by four-weekly maintenance (mitomycin weeks 13, 17, 25, 29, 37, and 41; BCG weeks 21, 33, and 45). The trial aims to include 500 participants who will be centrally randomised to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio stratified by T-stage, presence of CIS, and study site. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival; secondary endpoints are disease activity, time to recurrence, time to progression, safety, health-related quality of life, overall survival, feasibility, and resource use.

The Ca²⁺-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 was applied to measure [Ca²⁺](i). Doxepin at concentrations of 500-1000 μM induced a [Ca²⁺](i) rise in a concentration-dependent manner. The response was reduced partly by removing Ca²⁺. Doxepin-evoked Ca²⁺ entry was suppressed by Ca²⁺ entry blockers (nifedipine, econazole, SK&F96365), and protein kinase C (PKC) modulators. In the absence of extracellular Ca²⁺, incubation with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ pump inhibitor thapsigargin or 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) partly inhibit doxepin-induced [Ca²⁺](i) rise.

This cytotoxic effect was not reversed by chelating cytosolic Ca²⁺ with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'- tetraacetic acid/acetoxy methyl (BAPTA/AM). Annexin V/PI staining data implied that doxepin (200 and 250 μM) did not induce apoptosis.

Wide excision of prostate pedicle may be required to avoid positive surgical margins (PSMs) whereas preservation of neurovascular bundles requires resection close on the prostate. We studied Endo GIA™ stapling of prostate pedicle during RARP.  Methods:   Retrospectively the outcome of 55 men who underwent RARP with Endo GIA™ stapling (45-mm Echelon Ethicon; group A) of the pedicle were compared with 100 men where another method for prostate pedicle management (mono- and bipolar electrocautery, Hem-o-Lock clips or titanium 10-mm clips; group B) was used. Both groups were matched for age, prostate size, clinical T-stage, Gleason Score and fascia preservation (FP) score (as a measure of nerve sparing). Surgical, oncological, functional outcome factors and costs were compared.  Results:   The overall PSM rate was 33% in group A and 42% in group B (P=0.251). None of the cases had PSMs at the location of staples. PSMs with Endo GIA™ stapler at the periphery of the prostate were less frequent than in control group (4.1% vs. 11.5%; P=0.021). Median pedicle dissection time (7.8 [3.1-15.1] min vs. 10.5 [5.8-28.3] min; P=0.0001) and median operative time for RARP combined with lymphadenectomy (114 [70-129] min vs. 120 [67-200] min; P=0.043) tended to be shorter compared to group B. Erectile function and continence recovery at 12 months were comparable for both groups. Material costs for stapling (€730) were higher compared to variable costs in control group.

Strategies for triggering nonapoptotic or nonautophagic cell death may improve therapeutic efficacy against cancer. Curcumin has been reported to exhibit cancer chemopreventive properties. Herein, we report that curcumin induced apoptosis in LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 cells but triggered extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation in PC-3M cells. Electron microscopic images showed that the vacuoles lacked intracellular organelles and were derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, curcumin-induced vacuolation was not reversed by an apoptosis- or autophagy-related inhibitor, suggesting that vacuolation-mediated cell death differs from classical apoptotic and autophagic cell death. Mechanistic investigations revealed that curcumin treatment upregulated the ER stress markers CHOP and Bip/GRP78 and the autophagic marker LC3-II. In addition, curcumin induced ER stress by triggering ROS generation, which was supported by the finding that treating cells with the antioxidant NAC alleviated curcumin-mediated ER stress and vacuolation-mediated death. An in vivo PC-3M orthotopic prostate cancer model revealed that curcumin reduced tumor growth by inducing ROS production followed by vacuolation-mediated cell death. Overall, our results indicated that curcumin acts as an inducer of ROS production, which leads to nonapoptotic and nonautophagic cell death via increased ER stress.""","""['Wei-Jiunn Lee', 'Ming-Hsien Chien', 'Jyh-Ming Chow', 'Junn-Liang Chang', 'Yu-Ching Wen', 'Yung-Wei Lin', 'Chao-Wen Cheng', 'Gi-Ming Lai', 'Michael Hsiao', 'Liang-Ming Lee']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Corrigendum: Nonautophagic cytoplasmic vacuolation death induction in human PC-3M prostate cancer by curcumin through reactive oxygen species -mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'Curcumin enhances the effects of irinotecan on colorectal cancer cells through the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway.', 'Manumycin A inhibits triple-negative breast cancer growth through LC3-mediated cytoplasmic vacuolation death.', 'Curcumin analog WZ35 induced cell death via ROS-dependent ER stress and G2/M cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Small-molecule compounds target paraptosis to improve cancer therapy.', 'Curcumin, a Multifaceted Hormetic Agent, Mediates an Intricate Crosstalk between Mitochondrial Turnover, Autophagy, and Apoptosis.', 'Paraptosis: a unique cell death mode for targeting cancer.', 'PI5P4Kα supports prostate cancer metabolism and exposes a survival vulnerability during androgen receptor inhibition.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Single-Cell Chemistry of Photoactivatable Platinum Anticancer Complexes.', 'Curcumin and Carnosic Acid Cooperate to Inhibit Proliferation and Alter Mitochondrial Function of Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

However, Gleason upgrading between systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-GB) and radical prostatectomy (RPE) has frequently been observed. With respect to the high accuracy of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) for high-grade cancers and the higher percentage of cancer involvement per biopsy core in targeted MR-guided prostate biopsy (MR-GB), we hypothesized that MR-GB reduces the risk of Gleason upgrading on RPE as compared to the gold standard. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of Gleason upgrading on RPE for MR-GB, TRUS-GB, and the combination of both biopsy modalities.  Methods:   Overall, 52 consecutive patients with RPE had received an mpMRI of the prostate and subsequently underwent targeted MR-GB prior to surgery. All patients underwent an additional TRUS-GB during the same biopsy session. Gleason grading was measured by two different methods: the conventional Gleason score (cGS = primary + secondary pattern) and the highest Gleason pattern (hGP).  Results:   In relation to TRUS-GB, MR-GB alone showed lower rates of upgrading when comparing the cGS (40.4 vs. 50.0 %) and the hGP (21.2 vs. 32.7 %). The combination of MR-GB and TRUS-GB showed the lowest rates of upgrading (cGS: 28.8 %; hGP: 11.5 %), and compared to TRUS-GB, significantly reduced the risk of upgrading for both measurements of Gleason grading (cGS: OR 0.41, 95 % CL 0.18-0.91, p = 0.0289; hGP: OR 0.27, 95 % CL 0.10-0.75, p = 0.0123).  Conclusion:   MpMRI and targeted MR-GB are useful tools to better characterize and stage the extent of disease, and therefore enable the urologist to better risk-stratify and counsel the patient.

Purpose To investigate the feasibility of using ferumoxytol (an FDA-approved iron oxide agent) for lymph node mapping of the prostate on imaging (MRI) in a non-human primate (NHP) Macaque model. Material and Methods Four NHPs weighing 5-13 kg underwent injection of ferumoxytol after a needle was introduced transrectally under MRI guidance into the prostate using a commercially available intrarectal MRI biopsy guide. Ferumoxytol was administered at dosage in the range of 0.15-0.75 mg Fe/kg in a fixed injection volume of 0.2 mL. T1-weighted MRI was performed at 3 T starting immediately and extending at least 45 min post-injection. Two readers evaluated the images in consensus. The NHPs tolerated the ferumoxytol injections at all doses with no evident side effects. Results It was determined that the lowest dose of 0.15 mg Fe/kg produced the best outcome in terms of lymph node visualization and draining nodes were reliably visualized at this dose and volume. Conclusion Thus, MRI with intraprostatic injection of ferumoxytol may be considered an effective T1 contrast agent for prospective mapping of lymph nodes draining the prostate and, thus, for attempted sentinel lymph node identification in prostate cancer. Large clinical trials to determine safety and efficacy are needed.""","""['Sandeep Sankineni', 'Jeremy Smedley', 'Marcelino Bernardo', 'Anna M Brown', 'Linda Johnson', 'Berrend Muller', 'Gary L Griffiths', 'Hisataka Kobayashi', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Brandon Keele', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Baris Turkbey']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Radiol""","""['A Phase I Dosing Study of Ferumoxytol for MR Lymphography at 3 T in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Magnetic Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Prostate Cancer after intraprostatic Injection of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles.', 'Magnetic resonance sentinel lymph node imaging of the prostate with gadofosveset trisodium-albumin: preliminary results in a canine model.', 'Prostate cancer: detection of lymph node metastases outside the routine surgical area with ferumoxtran-10-enhanced MR imaging.', 'Emerging applications for ferumoxytol as a contrast agent in MRI.', 'Repurposing ferumoxytol: Diagnostic and therapeutic applications of an FDA-approved nanoparticle.', 'Novel Imaging in Detection of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance sentinel lymph node imaging and magnetometer-guided intraoperative detection in prostate cancer using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.', 'Lymph node imaging in initial staging of prostate cancer: An overview and update.', 'Current and potential imaging applications of ferumoxytol for magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

Although it has been demonstrated that BNIP3 is transcriptionally regulated by HIF-1α and is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR145, our previous data indicated that there might be some other transcription factors regulating BNIP3 in prostate cancer. This study is conducted to investigate whether BNIP3 expression is directly regulated by Sp3/Sp1 or not.  Materials and methods:   Bioinformatics analysis shows that BNIP3 promoter contains several potential Sp3/Sp1 binding sites. And then it is demonstrated that SP3 could regulate the BNIP3 transcriptionally by binding to the predicted sites by dual reporter gene assays, ChIP, and EMSA. The biological effects of SP3 regulating BNIP3 on prostate cancer cells proliferation are measured by MTT, TUNEL, and flow cytometry.  Results:   Our data show that Sp3 but not Sp1, is positively related to BNIP3 overexpression in prostate cancer. Sp3 can directly regulate BNIP3 transcription by mainly binding to the Sp3 binding sites (-624~-615 and -350~-343) of BNIP3 promoter. Knockdown of Sp3 by RNA interference could reduce cells growth and lead to cells apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145. Sp3-dependent BNIP3 overexpression might be an important mechanism to promote prostate cancer cells proliferation.  Conclusion:   This is the first study to provide direct evidence of Sp3-dependent BNIP3 expression. Sp3 might be the major transcriptional regulator of BNIP3 in prostate cancer and it is worthy to further study. The regulation of BNIP3 by Sp3 may be a new cancer-specific therapeutic target in prostate cancer.""","""['Ying Huang', 'Pengfei Shen', 'Xueqin Chen', 'Zhibin Chen', 'Tao Zhao', 'Ni Chen', 'Jing Gong', 'Ling Nie', 'Miao Xu', 'Xinglan Li', 'Hao Zeng', 'Qiao Zhou']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['MicroRNA145 targets BNIP3 and suppresses prostate cancer progression.', 'Evidence that Sp1 positively and Sp3 negatively regulate and androgen does not directly regulate functional tumor suppressor 15-lipoxygenase 2 (15-LOX2) gene expression in normal human prostate epithelial cells.', 'Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors upregulate the proximal promoter of the human prostate-specific antigen gene in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of tissue factor gene expression in human endometrium by transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3.', 'Gene regulation by Sp1 and Sp3.', 'BNIP3 enhances pancreatic cancer cell migration and proliferation via modulating autophagy under hypoxia.', 'The androgen receptor inhibits transcription of GPER1 by preventing Sp1 and Sp3 from binding to the promoters in prostate cancer cells.', 'A Transcription Factor-Based Risk Model for Predicting the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer and Potential Therapeutic Drugs.', 'Methylation of BNIP3 in pancreatic cancer inhibits the induction of mitochondrial-mediated tumor cell apoptosis.', 'Cancer: Linking Powerhouses to Suicidal Bags.']"""

Without a pre-existing superior option, a patient has to weigh his personal preferences against the risks and benefits of each alternative to select the most appropriate treatment. Given this context, in prostate cancer treatment decision-making, it is particularly suitable to follow the principles of shared decision-making (SDM), especially with the support of specific instruments like decision aids (DAs). Although several alternatives are available, present tools are not sufficiently compatible with routine clinical practice. To overcome existing barriers and to stimulate structural implementation of DAs and SDM in clinical practice, a web-based prostate cancer treatment DA was developed to fit clinical workflow. Following the structure of an existing DA, Dutch content was developed, and values clarification methods (VCMs) were added. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of this DA on (shared) treatment choice and patient-reported outcomes.  Methods/design:   Nineteen Dutch hospitals are included in a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial, with an intervention and a control arm. In the intervention group, the DA will be offered after diagnosis, and a summary of the patients' preferences, which were identified with the DA, can be discussed by the patient and his clinician during later consultation. Patients in the control group will receive information and decisional support as usual. Results from both groups on decisional conflict, treatment choice and the experience with involvement in the decision-making process are compared. Patients are requested to fill in questionnaires after treatment decision-making but before treatment is started, and 6 and 12 months later. This will allow the development of treatment satisfaction, decisional regret, and quality of life to be monitored. Clinicians from both groups will evaluate their practice of information provision and decisional support.  Discussion:   This study will describe a web-based prostate cancer treatment DA with VCMs. The effect of this DA on the decision-making process and subsequent patient reported outcomes will be evaluated.

Elevated intracellular copper is considered to sensitize prostate cancer cells to certain copper-coordination compounds, especially those with ionophoric properties. While there is compelling in vitro evidence that prostate cancer cells accumulate intracellular copper, a corresponding status for copper in patient tissues has not been corroborated. We therefore established whether copper concentrations increase in cancerous prostate tissues, and in sera, in patients throughout disease progression.  Methods:   Human prostate tissue samples were obtained from patient prostatectomies (n = 28), and together with patient-matched sera, were analyzed for copper content by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  Results:   When grouped together, cancerous prostate tissues exhibiting moderate disease severity (Gleason Score 7) (n = 10) had 1.6-fold more copper than age-matched normal tissues (n = 10) (P < 0.05). Those with more aggressive disease (Gleason Score 9) (n = 8) had 1.8-fold more copper (P < 0.05). In both disease stages however, the copper concentrations between individual samples were rather variable (0.55-3.02 μg/g), with many clearly within the normal range (0.52-1.28 μg/g). Additionally, we found that there was no change in serum copper concentrations in patients with either moderate or aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason Score 7 or 9), compared with reference intervals and to age-matched controls.  Conclusions:   The heterogeneous nature of copper concentrations in cancerous prostate tissues, suggest that a small subset of patients may respond to treatments that target elevated intratumoral copper.

Methods:   We evaluated the association between statin use and prostate cancer risk in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). Study participants were 32,091 men aged 40-79 at baseline, 67% of whom were non-Hispanic black. Between study enrollment (2002-2009) and December 31, 2010, 570 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed, including 324 low-grade cancers (Gleason score <7 or Gleason pattern 3 + 4) and 107 high-grade cancers (Gleason score >7 or Gleason pattern 4 + 3). Analyses of overall prostate cancer were conducted using Cox regression and analyses of grade-specific cancer were conducted using competing risks models.  Results:   Ten percent of non-Hispanic black men and 22% of non-Hispanic white men reported use of statins at study enrollment. As compared to non-use, statin use was associated with a non-significant 14% lower risk of prostate cancer in multivariable models (Hazard Ratio [HR]:0.86; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.63-1.18). This association was stronger for high-grade cancer (HR: 0.62; 95%CI: 0.30, 1.28) than low-grade cancer (HR:0.98; 95%CI: 0.65-1.48). Results were similar by race/ethnicity (p-interaction: 0.41) and did not vary by history of prostate-specific antigen [PSA] screening (p-interaction: 0.65).
