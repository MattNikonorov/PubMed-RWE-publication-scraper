Therefore, an additional serological screening of autoantibodies in patients' sera could improve the detection of prostate cancer. We performed protein macroarray screening with sera from 49 prostate cancer patients, 70 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and 28 healthy controls and compared the autoimmune response in those groups. We were able to distinguish prostate cancer patients from normal controls with an accuracy of 83.2%, patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia from normal controls with an accuracy of 86.0% and prostate cancer patients from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia with an accuracy of 70.3%. Combining seroreactivity pattern with a PSA level of higher than 4.0 ng/ml this classification could be improved to an accuracy of 84.1%. For selected proteins we were able to confirm the differential expression by using luminex on 84 samples. We provide a minimally invasive serological method to reduce false positive results in detection of prostate cancer and according to PSA screening to distinguish men with prostate cancer from men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.""","""['Petra Leidinger', 'Andreas Keller', 'Lisa Milchram', 'Christian Harz', 'Martin Hart', 'Angelika Werth', 'Hans-Peter Lenhof', 'Andreas Weinhäusel', 'Bastian Keck', 'Bernd Wullich', 'Nicole Ludwig', 'Eckart Meese']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Autoantibody signatures as biomarkers to distinguish prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with increased serum prostate specific antigen.', 'Value of free/total prostate specific antigen in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer (study of 105 patients).', 'Comparison of the clinical value of complexed PSA and total PSA in the discrimination between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Present-day possibilities of prostate cancer screening in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia before and after surgical treatment.', 'Molecular forms of serum prostate-specific antigen: the clinical usefulness of percent free PSA to discriminate prostate cancer from BPH.', 'Prostate cancer autoantibodies - applications in diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease progression and immunotherapy.', 'Over-Expression of LEDGF/p75 in HEp-2 Cells Enhances Autoimmune IgG Response in Patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia-A Novel Diagnostic Approach with Therapeutic Consequence?', 'The Autoantibodies against Tumor-Associated Antigens as Potential Blood-Based Biomarkers in Thyroid Neoplasia: Rationales, Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Biomarkers That Differentiate Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia from Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Tumor-associated autoantibodies in combination with alpha-fetoprotein for detection of early stage hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Pin1, one of the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases, is reportedly overexpressed in prostate cancers and is considered to contribute to accelerated cell growth, which may be one of the major factors contributing to their androgen-independent growth. Thus, we investigated how Pin1 modulates the gene expressions in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines using microarray analysis. In addition, the effects of Juglone, a commercially available Pin1 inhibitor were also examined.  Methods:   Two prostate cancer cell-lines, LNCaP (androgen-dependent) and DU145 (androgen-independent), were treated with Pin1 siRNA and its effects on gene expressions were analyzed by microarray. Individual gene regulations induced by Pin1 siRNA or the Pin1 inhibitor Juglone were examined using RT-PCR. In addition, the effects of Juglone on the growth of LNCaP and DU145 transplanted into mice were investigated.  Results:   Microarray analysis revealed that transcriptional factors regulated by Pin1 differed markedly between LNCaP and DU145 cells, the only exception being that Nrf was regulated in the same way by Pin1 siRNA in both cell lines. Despite this marked difference in gene regulations, Pin1 siRNA and Juglone exert a strong inhibitory effect on both the LNCaP and the DU145 cell line, suppressing in vitro cell proliferation as well as tumor enlargement when transplanted into mice.  Conclusions:   Despite Pin1-regulated gene expressions differing between these two prostate cancer cell-lines, LNCaP (androgen-dependent) and DU145 (androgen-independent), Pin1 inhibition suppresses proliferation of both cell-lines. These findings suggest the potential effectiveness of Pin1 inhibitors as therapeutic agents for prostate cancers, regardless of their androgen sensitivity.""","""['Ryuhei Kanaoka', 'Akifumi Kushiyama', 'Yasuyuki Seno', 'Yusuke Nakatsu', 'Yasuka Matsunaga', 'Toshiaki Fukushima', 'Yoshihiro Tsuchiya', 'Hideyuki Sakoda', 'Midori Fujishiro', 'Takeshi Yamamotoya', 'Hideaki Kamata', 'Akio Matsubara', 'Tomoichiro Asano']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Activation of beta-catenin signaling in prostate cancer by peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1-mediated abrogation of the androgen receptor-beta-catenin interaction.', 'Identification of phosphorylated proteins involved in the oncogenesis of prostate cancer via Pin1-proteomic analysis.', 'Stable suppression of tumorigenicity by Pin1-targeted RNA interference in prostate cancer.', 'Peptidyl-prolyl isomerases: functionality and potential therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease.', 'Pin1: a multi-talented peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase and a promising therapeutic target for human cancers.', 'Proline Isomerization: From the Chemistry and Biology to Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'The Role of Small Interfering RNAs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Par14 interacts with the androgen receptor, augmenting both its transcriptional activity and prostate cancer proliferation.', ""(3,3'-Methylene)bis-2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinones induce cytotoxicity against DU145 and PC3 cancer cells by inhibiting cell viability and promoting cell cycle arrest."", 'Targeting Pin1 for Modulation of Cell Motility and Cancer Therapy.']"""

Before this can be achieved, so-called 'cancer stem cell' (CSC) models must be developed and characterized in specific malignancies.  Methods:   In this study, holoclone formation assays were used to characterise stem-like molecular signatures in prostate cancer (PCa) cells.  Results:   LNCaP and PC3 parent cells were capable of responding to stem cell differentiation morphogen retinoic acid (RA), suggesting the presence of inherent stem-like properties. LNCaP cells, which represent early, androgen-responsive disease, formed holoclones after twenty six days. PC3 cells, which represent advanced, metastatic, castration-resistant disease, formed holoclones after only six days. Holoclones displayed decreased expression of RA-genes, suggesting a more immature, less differentiated phenotype. Gene and microRNA arrays demonstrated that holoclones downregulated a number of stem cell differentiation regulators while displaying enhanced regulation of G2 to M transition and the mitotic spindle checkpoint components of the cell cycle. PC3 holoclones displayed pronounced downregulation of known regulators of osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells and Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that some PCa cells retain the ability to transition to a more immature state in which differentiation and metastatic mechanisms are suppressed. The highlighting of osteoblast differentiation regulators in this mechanism is particularly notable, considering the propensity of PCa to metastasise to bone.""","""['Michael F Gallagher', 'Yvonne Salley', 'Cathy D Spillane', 'Brendan Ffrench', 'Salah El Baruni', 'Gordon Blacksheilds', 'Paul Smyth', 'Cara Martin', 'Orla Sheils', 'William Watson', ""John J O'Leary""]""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Clin Pathol""","""['PC3 human prostate carcinoma cell holoclones contain self-renewing tumor-initiating cells.', 'PC3 prostate tumor-initiating cells with molecular profile FAM65Bhigh/MFI2low/LEF1low increase tumor angiogenesis.', 'Prostate cancer cells induce osteoblast differentiation through a Cbfa1-dependent pathway.', 'Prostate cancer stem/progenitor cells: identification, characterization, and implications.', 'Prostate cancer and metastasis initiating stem cells.', 'Prostate cancer-derived holoclones: a novel and effective model for evaluating cancer stemness.', 'MicroRNA-17 is downregulated in esophageal adenocarcinoma cancer stem-like cells and promotes a radioresistant phenotype.', 'Genetic and cellular studies highlight that A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 19 is a protective biomarker in human prostate cancer.']"""

However, there is a lack of safety data for radical prostatectomy as therapy in this setting.  Objective:   To examine perioperative outcomes and short-term complications after radical prostatectomy for locally resectable, distant metastatic prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective case series from 2007 to 2014 comprising 106 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic (M1) prostate cancer from the USA, Germany, Italy, and Sweden.  Intervention:   Radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Descriptive statistics were used to present margin status, continence, and readmission, reoperation, and overall complication rates at 90 d, as well as for 21 specific complications. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to estimate survival function. Intercenter variability and M1a/ M1b subgroups were examined.  Results and limitations:   Some 79.2% of patients did not suffer any complications; positive-margin (53.8%), lymphocele (8.5%), and wound infection (4.7%) rates were higher in our cohort than in a meta-analysis of open radical prostatectomy performed for standard indications. At a median follow-up of 22.8 mo, 94/106 (88.7%) men were still alive. The study is limited by its retrospective design, differing selection criteria, and short follow-up.  Conclusions:   Radical prostatectomy for men with locally resectable, distant metastatic prostate cancer appears safe in expert hands for meticulously selected patients. Overall and specific complication rates related to the surgical extirpation are not more frequent than when radical prostatectomy is performed for standard indications, and the use of extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in all of this cohort compared to its selective use in localized/locally advanced prostate cancer accounts for any extra morbidity.  Patient summary:   Men presenting with advanced prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate are increasingly being considered for treatments directed at the prostate itself. On the basis of results for our international series of 106 men, surgery appears reasonably safe in this setting for certain patients.""","""['Prasanna Sooriakumaran', 'Jeffrey Karnes', 'Christian Stief', 'Bethan Copsey', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Peter Hammerer', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Marco Moschini', 'Christian Gratzke', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Lukas Manka', 'Tommy Nyberg', 'Susan J Dutton', 'Peter Wiklund', 'Markus Graefen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Treatment of the Prostate in the Presence of Metastases: Lessons from Other Solid Tumors.', 'Treatment of the Primary Tumour in the Presence of Metastases: Lessons from Breast Cancer.', 'Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Results of a Single-institution Series with Long-term Follow-up.', 'The role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection in the management of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Cytoreductive Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Prostate Cancer and Skeletal Metastases.', 'The Effect of Lymph Node Dissection in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: A Contemporary Analysis of Survival and Early Postoperative Outcomes.', 'Role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Oncological and perioperative outcomes of surgery with or without metastasis-directed therapy as part of a multimodal treatment in men with de-novo oligometastatic prostate cancer.', 'Web-Based Nomograms for Overall Survival and Cancer-Specific Survival of Bladder Cancer Patients with Bone Metastasis: A Retrospective Cohort Study from SEER Database.', 'Neoadjuvant radiohormonal therapy for oligo-metastatic prostate cancer: safety and efficacy outcomes from an open-label, dose-escalation, single-center, phase I/II clinical trial.', 'Development of a Prediction Model for Positive Surgical Margin in Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Unravelling oligometastatic disease from the perspective of radiation and medical oncology.

Methods:   To define the role of active surveillance and focal therapy in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancers, an invited international panel of practicing physicians in the field of localized prostate cancer discussed the available literature in three consecutive meetings to come to a broad interpretation of the available data.  Results:   The panel (""new prostate cancer management group,"" npm) agreed on the following observations. In most men with a low-volume Gleason 6 tumor, initial conservative management is appropriate. In men with a larger unifocal Gleason score 6 or 3 + 4 lesion, focal therapy, although still considered an investigational approach, appears to be a suitable option in early non-randomized comparison studies. Furthermore, in patients with multifocal small satellite Gleason 6 lesions in the presence of a larger index lesion, focal therapy of the index lesion is an option. For patients with high-grade, large-volume disease, or in young men with evidence of high-volume multifocal low-grade prostate cancer, whole-gland treatment should be considered.  Conclusion:   Active surveillance is a preferred and safe option for low-risk prostate cancer. Focal therapy is still under investigation, but the available phase II data are promising. Clinical benefits must be shown in prospective trials. With improved imaging, focal therapy may be an option for patients not choosing active surveillance with low-risk disease, progression upon active surveillance or intermediate-risk cancers with a localizable lesion.""","""['Henk van der Poel', 'Laurence Klotz', 'Gerald Andriole', 'Abdel-Rahmène Azzouzi', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Olivier Cussenot', 'Freddy Hamdy', 'Markus Graefen', 'Paolo Palma', 'Arturo Rodriguez Rivera', 'Christian G Stief']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on Prostate Cancer.

However, this is the first report of the interdependence of the two signaling systems. In a screen for proteins that interacted with, and thereby potentially regulated, the human platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX, ALOX12), we identified the integrin β4 (ITGB4).  Methods:   Using a cultured mammalian cell model, we have demonstrated that ITGB4 stimulation leads to recruitment of 12-LOX from the cytosol to the membrane where it physically interacts with the integrin to become enzymatically active to produce 12(S)-HETE, a known bioactive lipid metabolite that regulates numerous cancer phenotypes.  Results:   The net effect of the interaction was the prevention of cell death in response to starvation. Additionally, regulation of β4-mediated, EGF-stimulated invasion was shown to be dependent on 12-LOX, and downstream Erk signaling in response to ITGB4 activation also required 12-LOX.  Conclusions:   This is the first report of an enzyme of the eicosanoid pathway being recruited to and regulated by activated β4 integrin. Integrin β4 has recently been shown to induce expansion of prostate tumor progenitors and there is a strong correlation between stage/grade of prostate cancer and 12-LOX expression. The 12-LOX enzymatic product, 12(S)-HETE, regulates angiogenesis and cell migration in many cancer types. Therefore, disruption of integrin β4-12LOX interaction could reduce the pro-inflammatory oncogenic activity of 12-LOX. This report on the consequences of 12-LOX and ITGB4 interaction sets a precedent for the linkage of integrin and eicosanoid biology through direct protein-protein association.""","""['Keqin Tang', 'Yinlong Cai', 'Sangeeta Joshi', 'Elizabeth Tovar', 'Stephanie C Tucker', 'Krishna Rao Maddipati', 'John D Crissman', 'William T Repaskey', 'Kenneth V Honn']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Convergence of eicosanoid and integrin biology: Role of Src in 12-LOX activation.', 'beta4 integrin and epidermal growth factor coordinately regulate electric field-mediated directional migration via Rac1.', 'A small molecule induces integrin β4 nuclear translocation and apoptosis selectively in cancer cells with high expression of integrin β4.', 'Lipoxygenase metabolism: roles in tumor progression and survival.', 'Eicosanoid regulation of angiogenesis in human prostate carcinoma and its therapeutic implications.', 'Newly identified form of phenotypic plasticity of cancer: immunogenic mimicry.', 'Establishment of a novel prognostic prediction model through bioinformatics analysis for prostate cancer based on ferroptosis-related genes and its application in immune cell infiltration.', 'Integrin β4 as a Potential Diagnostic and Therapeutic Tumor Marker.', 'RAD001 targeted HUVECs reverses 12-lipoxygenase-induced angiogenesis in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Platelets in aging and cancer-""double-edged sword"".']"""

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a well-characterized process involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. The aim of this study is to analyze the expression of β-catenin, Snail, and E-cadherin in prostate cancer patients with prospective evaluation of their value in predicting disease-free survival (DFS). One-hundred-and-three consecutive prostate carcinoma patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and 35 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) were enrolled. Age, initial PSA level, tumor size and clinical stage were documented for adenocarcinoma patients and they were enrolled in active surveillance with serum PSA levels. Recurrence was defined as PSA level of ≥ 0.2 ng/ml on at least 2 occasions over a 2-month period. Immunohistochemical staining intensity was scored as negative, weakly positive, moderately positive, and strongly positive. For Snail and β-catenin immunoreaction, the tumors were considered nuclear positive when more than 5 % of the nuclei of tumor cells were positively stained. Patients with prostate cancer had weaker β-catenin (p < 0.0001), Snail (p = 0.006), and E-cadherin (p = 0.02) staining when compared to BPH patients and the frequency of nuclear positivity for β-catenin and Snail were higher in adenocarcinoma group (p < 0.0001). Increased expression and nuclear positivity of β-catenin were associated with advanced stage (p = 0.012 and p = 0.003) and higher tumor volume (p = 0.013 and p = 0.002). Additionally, patients with increased Snail expression had higher Gleason scores and tumor volume at presentation (p = 0.008 and p = 0.004). However, there were no significant DFS differences in adenocarcinoma patients who did and did not have β-catenin, Snail, and E-cadherin expression as assessed with log-rank test. Expressions of β-catenin, Snail, and E-cadherin were significantly lower in prostate cancer patients compared to BPH patients and both β-catenin and Snail had nuclear staining pattern in patients with adenocarcinoma.

Materials and methods:   We linked 20,648 participants from the Australian and New Zealand Diabetes and Cancer Collaboration with complete data on the MetS to national cancer registries and used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations of the MetS, the number of positive MetS components, and each of the five MetS components separately with the risk for overall, colorectal, prostate and breast cancer. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) are reported. We assessed predictive ability of the MetS using Harrell's c-statistic.  Results:   The MetS was inversely associated with prostate cancer (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.72-0.99). We found no evidence of an association between the MetS overall, colorectal and breast cancers. For those with five positive MetS components the HR was 1.12 (1.02-1.48) and 2.07 (1.26-3.39) for overall, and colorectal cancer, respectively, compared with those with zero positive MetS components. Greater waist circumference (WC) (1.38; 1.13-1.70) and elevated blood pressure (1.29; 1.01-1.64) were associated with colorectal cancer. Elevated WC and triglycerides were (inversely) associated with prostate cancer. MetS models were only poor to moderate discriminators for all cancer outcomes.  Conclusions:   We show that the MetS is (inversely) associated with prostate cancer, but is not associated with overall, colorectal or breast cancer. Although, persons with five positive components of the MetS are at a 1.2 and 2.1 increased risk for overall and colorectal cancer, respectively, and these associations appear to be driven, largely, by elevated WC and BP.

A direct comparison with cationic liposomes was made. This study validates the PLK1 gene as a potential target in cancer gene therapy including lung cancer, as demonstrated by the therapeutic efficacy of siPLK1:MWNT-NH3(+) complexes and their ability to significantly improve animal survival. Biological analysis of the siPLK1:MWNT-NH3(+) treated tumors by qRT-PCR and Western blot, in addition to TUNEL staining confirmed the biological functionality of the siRNA intratumorally, suggesting that tumor eradication was due to PLK1 knockdown. Furthermore, by using a fluorescently labeled, noncoding siRNA sequence complexed with MWNT-NH3(+), we established for the first time that the improved therapeutic efficacy observed in f-CNT-based siRNA delivery is directly proportional to the enhanced siRNA retention in the solid tumor and subsequent uptake by tumor cells after local administration in vivo.""","""['Chang Guo', 'Wafa T Al-Jamal', 'Francesca M Toma', 'Alberto Bianco', 'Maurizio Prato', 'Khuloud T Al-Jamal', 'Kostas Kostarelos']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Comparison of cationic liposome and PAMAM dendrimer for delivery of anti-Plk1 siRNA in breast cancer treatment.', 'Therapeutic targeting of polo-like kinase 1 using RNA-interfering nanoparticles (iNOPs) for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Antitumor activity and prolonged survival by carbon-nanotube-mediated therapeutic siRNA silencing in a human lung xenograft model.', 'pH-responsive hybrid nanoparticle with enhanced dissociation characteristic for siRNA delivery.', 'Polo-like Kinase 1-targeting Chitosan Nanoparticles Suppress the Progression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Natural and synthetic nanovectors for cancer therapy.', 'Carbon Nanotubes as Carriers in Drug Delivery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Mechanistic Analysis of Their Carcinogenic Potential, Safety Profiling and Identification of Biomarkers.', 'Tuning the cationic interface of simple polydiacetylene micelles to improve siRNA delivery at the cellular level.', 'Multistage pH-responsive codelivery liposomal platform for synergistic cancer therapy.', 'Smart Nanocarriers as an Emerging Platform for Cancer Therapy: A Review.']"""

To identify novel gene products whose downregulation transactivates AR in prostate cancer cells, we performed a screen of enzymatically-generated shRNA lenti-libraries selecting for transduced LNCaP cells with elevated expression of a fluorescent reporter gene under the control of an AR-responsive promoter. The shRNAs present in selected populations were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing to identify target genes. Highly enriched gene targets were then validated with siRNAs against selected genes, testing first for increased expression of luciferase from an AR-responsive promoter and then for altered expression of endogenous androgen-regulated genes in LNCaP cells. We identified 20 human genes whose silencing affected the expression of exogenous and endogenous androgen-responsive genes in prostate cancer cells grown in androgen-depleted medium. Knockdown of four of these genes upregulated the expression of endogenous AR targets and siRNAs targeting two of these genes (IGSF8 and RTN1) enabled androgen-independent proliferation of androgen-dependent cells. The effects of IGSF8 appear to be mediated through its interaction with a tetraspanin protein, CD9, previously implicated in prostate cancer progression.

Metformin also has an anti-proliferative effect in preclinical studies of both hematologic malignancies as well as solid cancers and clinical studies testing metformin as an anti-cancer drug are in progress. However, all cancer types do not respond to metformin with the same effectiveness or acquire resistance. To understand the mechanism of acquired resistance and possibly its mechanism of action as an anti-proliferative agent, we developed metformin resistant LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Metformin resistant LNCaP cells had an increased proliferation rate, increased migration and invasion ability as compared to the parental cells, and expressed markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A detailed gene expression microarray comparing the resistant cells to the wild type cells revealed that Edil2, Ereg, Axl, Anax2, CD44 and Anax3 were the top up-regulated genes and calbindin 2 and TPTE (transmembrane phosphatase with tensin homology) and IGF1R were down regulated. We focused on Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase that has been shown to be up regulated in several drug resistance cancers. Here, we show that the metformin resistant cell line as well as castrate resistant cell lines that over express Axl were more resistant to metformin, as well as to taxotere compared to androgen sensitive LNCaP and CWR22 cells that do not overexpress Axl. Forced overexpression of Axl in LNCaP cells decreased metformin and taxotere sensitivity and knockdown of Axl in resistant cells increased sensitivity to these drugs. Inhibition of Axl activity by R428, a small molecule Axl kinase inhibitor, sensitized metformin resistant cells that overexpressed Axl to metformin.

In our institute low-dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy is performed with encapsulated I-125 isotopes (seeds) using transrectal ultrasound guidance and metal needles. The SPOT PRO 3.1 (Elekta, Sweden) system is used for treatment planning. In this study the first 79 patients were treated with loose seed (LS) technique, the consecutive patients were treated with stranded seed (SS) technique. During intraoperative planning the dose constraints were the same for both techniques. All LSs were placed inside the prostate capsule, while with SS a 2 mm margin around the prostate was allowed for seed positioning. The prescribed dose for the prostate was 145 Gy. This study investigated prostate dose coverage in 30-30 randomly selected patients with LS and SS. Four weeks after the implantation native CT and MRI were done and CT/MRI image fusion was performed. The target was contoured on MRI and the plan was prepared on CT data. To assess the treatment plan dose-volume histograms were used. For the target coverage V100, V90, D90, D100, for the dose inhomogeneity V150, V200, and the dose-homogeneity index (DHI), for dose conformality the conformal index (COIN) were calculated.

All RT centers responded to all questions of the survey. 1. Treatment data: In 2014, 33,162 patients were treated with RT: 31,678 (95.5%) with teletherapy, and 1484 (4.5%) with brachytherapy (BT). Between 2012 and 2014, the number of patients treated with radiotherapy increased with 6.6%, but the number of BT patients decreased by 11%. Forty-two percent of all patients were treated in the two centers of the capital: 9235 patients (28%) at the National Institute of Oncology (NIO), and 4812 (14%) at the Municipial Oncoradiology Center (MOC). Out of the patients treated on megavoltage RT units (n=22,239), only 901 (4%) were treated with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), and 2018 (9%) with image-guided RT (IGRT).

Recent studies pointed to a consistent overexpression of MCT2 in prostate cancer (PCa) suggesting MCT2 as a putative biomarker and molecular target. Despite the importance of this observation the mechanisms involved in MCT2 regulation are unknown. Through an integrative analysis we have discovered that selective demethylation of an internal SLC16A7/MCT2 promoter is a recurrent event in independent PCa cohorts. This demethylation is associated with expression of isoforms differing only in 5'-UTR translational control motifs, providing one contributing mechanism for MCT2 protein overexpression in PCa. Genes co-expressed with SLC16A7/MCT2 also clustered in oncogenic-related pathways and effectors of these signalling pathways were found to bind at the SLC16A7/MCT2 gene locus. Finally, MCT2 knock-down attenuated the growth of PCa cells. The present study unveils an unexpected epigenetic regulation of SLC16A7/MCT2 isoforms and identifies a link between SLC16A7/MCT2, Androgen Receptor (AR), ETS-related gene (ERG) and other oncogenic pathways in PCa.

Objective:   The aim of this study was to describe nurses' views about PCSGs as a means to making recommendations for advancing the effectiveness of PCSGs.  Methods:   A convenience sample of 101 Canadian nurses completed a 43-item Likert-scale questionnaire with the additional option of providing comments in response to an open-ended question. Univariate descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data, respectively.  Results:   Participants held positive views about the roles and potential impact of PCSGs. Participants strongly endorsed the benefits of support groups in disseminating information and providing support to help decrease patient anxiety. Online support groups were endorsed as a practical alternative for men who are reluctant to participate in face-to-face groups.  Conclusions:   Findings suggest that nurses support the value of Canadian face-to-face and online PCSGs. This is important, given that nurses can help connect individual patients to community-based sources providing psychosocial support.  Implications for practice:   Many men benefit from participating in PCSGs.

A risk score of 105 known risk SNPs was strongly associated with prostate cancer (P < 1.0 × 10(-8)). Comparing the highest to lowest risk score deciles, the OR was 6.22 for non-Hispanic whites, 5.82 for Latinos, 3.77 for African-Americans, and 3.38 for East Asians. In non-Hispanic whites, the 105 risk SNPs explained approximately 7.6% of disease heritability. The entire GWAS array explained approximately 33.4% of heritability, with a 4.3-fold enrichment within DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (P = 0.004).  Significance:   Taken together, our findings of independent risk variants, ethnic variation in existing SNP replication, and remaining unexplained heritability have important implications for further clarifying the genetic risk of prostate cancer. Our findings also suggest that there may be much promise in evaluating understudied variation, such as indels and ethnically diverse populations.""","""['Thomas J Hoffmann', 'Stephen K Van Den Eeden', 'Lori C Sakoda', 'Eric Jorgenson', 'Laurel A Habel', 'Rebecca E Graff', 'Michael N Passarelli', 'Clinton L Cario', 'Nima C Emami', 'Chun R Chao', 'Nirupa R Ghai', 'Jun Shan', 'Dilrini K Ranatunga', 'Charles P Quesenberry', 'David Aaronson', 'Joseph Presti', 'Zhaoming Wang', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Stephen J Chanock', 'Shannon K McDonnell', 'Amy J French', 'Daniel J Schaid', 'Stephen N Thibodeau', 'Qiyuan Li', 'Matthew L Freedman', 'Kathryn L Penney', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Christopher A Haiman', 'Brian E Henderson', 'Daniela Seminara', 'Mark N Kvale', 'Pui-Yan Kwok', 'Catherine Schaefer', 'Neil Risch', 'John S Witte']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Discov""","""['Identification of novel common breast cancer risk variants at the 6q25 locus\xa0among Latinas.', 'Evaluating genetic risk for prostate cancer among Japanese and Latinos.', 'Multi-ethnic transcriptome-wide association study of prostate cancer.', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'A Review of Prostate Cancer Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).', 'African American Prostate Cancer Displays Quantitatively Distinct Vitamin D Receptor Cistrome-transcriptome Relationships Regulated by BAZ1A.', 'Polygenic risk score for tumor aggressiveness and early-onset prostate cancer in Asians.', 'Vitamin D and Systems Biology.', 'Type 2 Diabetes-Related Variants Influence the Risk of Developing Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Case-Control Study and Meta-Analysis.', 'A microRNA Transcriptome-wide Association Study of Prostate Cancer Risk.']"""

This study aims to provide a comprehensive view of the role and regulation of cell-cell adhesion in prostate cancer aggressiveness by examining the functional implications of both E-cadherin and Desmoglein 2 (DSG2). E-cadherin expression was first examined using immunofluorescence in 50 normal prostate tissues and in a cohort of 414 prostate cancer patients. Correlation and survival analyses were performed to assess its clinical significance. In primary prostate cancer patients, reduced expression of both E-cadherin and DSG2 is significantly associated with an earlier biochemical recurrence. Transgenic DU145 E-cadherin knockdown and constitutively active AKT overexpression lines were generated. Functional implications of such genetic alterations were analyzed in vitro and in vivo, the latter by using tumorigenesis as well as extravasation and metastatic tumor formation assays. We observed that loss of E-cadherin leads to impaired primary and metastatic tumor formation in vivo, suggesting a tumor promoter role for E-cadherin in addition to its known role as a tumor suppressor. Activation of AKT leads to a significant reduction in E-cadherin expression and nuclear localization of Snail, suggesting a role for the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the transient repression of E-cadherin. This reduced expression may be regulated by separate mechanisms as neither the loss of E-cadherin nor activation of AKT significantly affected DSG2 expression. In conclusion, these findings illustrate the critical role of cell-cell adhesion in the progression to aggressive prostate cancer, through regulation by the PI3K pathway.""","""['Alison G Barber', 'Mireia Castillo-Martin', 'Dennis M Bonal', 'Angela J Jia', 'Benjamin A Rybicki', 'Angela M Christiano', 'Carlos Cordon-Cardo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Snail promotes cell migration through PI3K/AKT-dependent Rac1 activation as well as PI3K/AKT-independent pathways during prostate cancer progression.', 'Characterization of desmoglein expression in the normal prostatic gland.

The goal of the current study was to determine whether increasing BMI was associated with outcomes in men with localized CaP who were treated with dose-escalated RT.  Methods:   The authors identified patients with localized (T1b-T4N0M0) CaP who were treated with definitive intensity-modulated RT and image-guided RT from 2001 through 2010. BMI was analyzed as a continuous variable. Adjusting for confounders, multivariable competing risk and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between BMI and the risk of biochemical failure (BF), distant metastases (DM), cause-specific mortality (CSM), and overall mortality.  Results:   Of the 1442 patients identified, approximately 20% had a BMI <25 kg/m(2) , 48% had a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m(2) , 23% had a BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m(2) , 6% had a BMI of 35 to 39.9 kg/m(2) , and 4% had a BMI of ≥40 kg/m(2) . The median follow-up was 47.6 months (range, 1-145 months), with a median age of 68 years (range, 36-89 years). The median dose was 78 grays (range, 76-80 grays) and 30% of patients received androgen deprivation therapy. Increasing BMI was found to be inversely associated with age (P<.001) and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level (P = .018). On multivariable analysis, increasing BMI was associated with an increased risk of BF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.00-1.07 [P = .042]), DM (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11 [P = .004]), CSM (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.23 [P<.001]), and overall mortality (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08 [P = .004]).

We experienced more than a few segmentation errors with the previous BONENAVI version (2.0.5). We have since obtained a revised version (2.1.7) and evaluate it.  Methods:   Bone scans of patients were analyzed by BONENAVI version 2.0.5 and a revised version 2.1.7 with regard to segmentation errors, sensitivity, and specificity. Patients with skeletal metastases from prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers were included in the study as true-positive cases. Patients with no skeletal metastasis (regardless of hot spots), and patients with abnormal bone scans but no skeletal metastasis were included as negative cases. Bone-scan patients were subjected to artificial neural network (ANN) evaluation. Values equal to or above 0.5 were regarded as positive, and those below 0.5 as negative. The patients whose clinical status did not correspond to their ANN scores were assessed for any similarities.  Results:   The frequency of segmentation errors was statistically significantly reduced when using BONENAVI version 2.1.7. The differences in sensitivity and specificity for the results of version 2.0.5 versus version 2.1.7 were not different, giving a high Cohen's kappa coefficient. In the patients who showed an increased ANN value with version 2.1.7, a few false-positive thoracic lesions were identified. Patients whose ANN value was significantly high with version 2.0.5 showed no tendencies.  Conclusion:   Revised BONENAVI version 2.1.7 for bone scintigraphy was superior with regard to segmentation errors. However, its sensitivity and specificity were similar to those of version 2.0.5.

Patients and methods:   The study was based on 915 patients from a prospective randomised multicentre trial (No. 5) by the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group, comparing parenteral oestrogen with total androgen blockade. Long-term survival was defined as patients having an overall survival of ≥10 years, and logistic regression models were constructed to identity clinical predictors of survival. QoL during follow-up was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire - C30 version 1 (EORTC-C30) ratings.  Results:   In all, 40 (4.4%) of the 915 men survived for >10 years. Factors significantly associated with increased likelihood of surviving for >10 years in the univariate analyses were: absence of cancer-related pain; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of <2; negligible analgesic consumption; T-category of 1-2; prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of <231 μg/L; and a Soloway score of 1. In the multivariate analyses, ECOG performance status of <2, PSA level of <231 μg/L, and Soloway score of 1, were all independent predictors of long-term survival.

Two types of P-SCs have been identified in both human and mouse adult prostates based on prostasphere or organoid cultures, cell lineage tracing, renal capsule implantation, and expression of luminal- and basal-specific proteins. The sphere-forming P-SCs are from the basal cell compartment that express P63, and are therefore designated as basal P-SCs (P-bSCs). Luminal P-SCs (P-lSCs) express luminal cytokeratins and Nkx3.1. Herein, we report that the type 2 FGF receptor (FGFR2) signaling axis is crucial for preserving stemness and preventing differentiation of P-bSCs. FGFR2 signaling mediated by FGFR substrate 2α (FRS2α) is indispensable for formation and maintenance of prostaspheres derived from P63(+) P-bSCs. Ablation of Fgfr2 in P63(+) cells in vitro causes the disintegration of prostaspheres. Ablation of Fgfr2 in vivo reduces the number of P63-expressing basal cells and enriches luminal cells. This suggests a basal stem cell-to-luminal cell differentiation. In addition, ablation of Fgfr2 in P63(+) cells causes defective postnatal development of the prostate. Therefore, the data indicate that FGFR2 signaling is critical for preserving stemness and preventing differentiation of P-bSCs.""","""['Yanqing Huang', 'Tomoaki Hamana', 'Junchen Liu', 'Cong Wang', 'Lei An', 'Pan You', 'Julia Y F Chang', 'Jianming Xu', 'Chengliu Jin', 'Zhongying Zhang', 'Wallace L McKeehan', 'Fen Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Prostate Sphere-forming Stem Cells Are Derived from the P63-expressing Basal Compartment.', 'Wnt and Notch pathways have interrelated opposing roles on prostate progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation.', 'Re: Prostate Sphere-Forming Stem Cells are Derived from the P63-Expressing Basal Compartment.', 'Role of epithelial cell fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2alpha in prostate development, regeneration and tumorigenesis.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Proteomics reveals the potential mechanism of Tanshinone IIA in promoting the Ex\xa0Vivo expansion of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.', 'Cytonemes coordinate asymmetric signaling and organization in the Drosophila muscle progenitor niche.', 'Establishment and characterization of prostate organoids from treatment-naïve patients with prostate cancer.', 'Cellular Mechanisms of FGF-Stimulated Tissue Repair.']"""

Curcumin is an active ingredient that has been extracted from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa. Recently, a potential of Curcumin against PC has been reported in PC, whereas the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we studied the effects of low-dose Curcumin on PC cell growth. Curcumin (from 0.2 to 0.8 μmol/l) dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of PC cells, without affecting cell apoptosis. Further analyses showed that Curcumin dose-dependently increased a cell cycle suppressor CDKN1A at protein levels, but not mRNA levels, in PC cells, suggesting that Curcumin may regulate the translation of CDKN1A, as well as a possible involvement of miRNA intervention. From all CDKN1A-3'-UTR-binding miRNAs, we found that miR-208 was specifically inhibited in PC cells dose-dependently by Curcumin.

It is therefore important to know to what extent post-diagnostic diet may affect disease-specific and overall mortality. A total of 926 men participating in the Physicians' Health Study diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer completed diet questionnaires for a median of 5.1 years after diagnosis, and were followed thereafter to assess mortality for a median of 9.9 years since questionnaire completion. Two post-diagnostic dietary patterns were identified: a Prudent pattern, characterized by higher intake of vegetables, fruits, fish, legumes, and whole grains; and a Western pattern, characterized by higher intake of processed and red meats, high-fat dairy and refined grains. Cox regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). During 8,093 person-years of follow-up, 333 men died, 56 (17%) of prostate cancer. The Western pattern was significantly related to a higher risk of prostate cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. Comparing men in the highest versus the lowest quartile of the Western pattern, the HRs were 2.53 (95% CI, 1.00-6.42; Ptrend = 0.02) for prostate cancer-specific mortality and 1.67 (95% CI, 1.16-2.42; Ptrend = 0.01) for all-cause mortality. The Prudent pattern was associated with a significantly lower all-cause mortality (HRQuartile 4 vs. Quartile 1: 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44-0.93; Ptrend = 0.02); the relationship with prostate cancer-specific mortality was inverse but not statistically significant. A post-diagnostic Western dietary pattern was associated with higher prostate cancer-specific and all-cause mortality, whereas a Prudent dietary pattern was related to lower all-cause mortality after prostate cancer diagnosis.""","""['Meng Yang', 'Stacey A Kenfield', 'Erin L Van Blarigan', 'Julie L Batista', 'Howard D Sesso', 'Jing Ma', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Jorge E Chavarro']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Dairy intake after prostate cancer diagnosis in relation to disease-specific and total mortality.', 'Association of dietary patterns with cancer recurrence and survival in patients with stage III colon cancer.', 'Dietary patterns and risk of prostate cancer in U.S. men.', 'Dietary fat and prostate cancer progression and survival.', 'Dietary fat reduction to reduce prostate cancer risk: controlled enthusiasm, learning a lesson from breast or other cancers, and the big picture.', 'Association between Dietary Indices and Dietary Patterns and Mortality and Cancer Recurrence among Cancer Survivors: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.', 'Post-diagnostic health behaviour scores and risk of prostate cancer progression and mortality.', 'Association of Food Deserts and Food Swamps With Obesity-Related Cancer Mortality in the US.', 'Monitoring and Modulating Diet and Gut Microbes to Enhance Response and Reduce Toxicity to Cancer Treatment.', 'Association of Neighborhood Deprivation With Prostate Cancer and Immune Markers in African American and European American Men.']"""

We aimed to identify features of serum proteome and associated processes involved in response to partial body irradiation during cancer treatment.  Methods and materials:   Twenty patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) and 20 patients with prostate cancer received definitive intensity modulated RT. Blood samples were collected before RT, just after RT, and 1 month after the end of RT. Complete serum proteome was analyzed in individual samples, using a shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach which allowed identification of approximately 450 proteins. Approximately 100 unique proteins were quantified in all samples after exclusion of immunoglobulins, and statistical significance of differences among consecutive samples was assessed. Processes associated with quantified proteins and their functional interactions were predicted using gene ontology tools.  Results:   RT-induced changes were marked in the HNSCC patient group: 22 upregulated and 33 downregulated proteins were detected in post-RT sera. Most of the changes reversed during follow-up, yet levels of some proteins remained affected 1 month after the end of RT. RT-upregulated proteins were associated with acute phase, inflammatory response, and complement activation. RT-downregulated proteins were associated with transport and metabolism of lipids (plasma apolipoproteins) and blood coagulation. RT-induced changes were much weaker in prostate cancer patients, which corresponded to differences in acute radiation toxicity observed in both groups. Nevertheless, general patterns of RT-induced sera proteome changes were similar in both of the groups of cancer patients.  Conclusions:   In this pilot study, we proposed to identify a molecular signature of radiation response, based on specific features of serum proteome. The signature included upregulation of factors involved in acute or inflammatory response but also downregulation of plasma apolipoproteins and factors involved in blood coagulation.""","""['Piotr Widlak', 'Karol Jelonek', 'Anna Wojakowska', 'Monika Pietrowska', 'Joanna Polanska', 'Łukasz Marczak', 'Leszek Miszczyk', 'Krzysztof Składowski']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Comparison of peptide cancer signatures identified by mass spectrometry in serum of patients with head and neck, lung and colorectal cancers: association with tumor progression.', 'Radiation-related changes in serum proteome profiles detected by mass spectrometry in blood of patients treated with radiotherapy due to larynx cancer.', 'Radiotherapy-related changes in serum proteome patterns of head and neck cancer patients; the effect of low and medium doses of radiation delivered to large volumes of normal tissue.', 'Systemic effects of ionizing radiation at the proteome and metabolome levels in the blood of cancer patients treated with radiotherapy: the influence of inflammation and radiation toxicity.', 'The management of head and neck tumors with high technology radiation therapy.', 'Modifiable contributing factors to COVID-19: A comprehensive review.', ""Proteomic Profiling of Saliva and Tears in Radiated Head and Neck Cancer Patients as Compared to Primary Sjögren's Syndrome Patients."", 'Dose-dependence of radiotherapy-induced changes in serum levels of choline-containing phospholipids; the importance of lower doses delivered to large volumes of normal tissues.', 'Proteomic Evaluation of the Natural History of the Acute Radiation Syndrome of the Gastrointestinal Tract in a Non-human Primate Model of Partial-body Irradiation with Minimal Bone Marrow Sparing Includes Dysregulation of the Retinoid Pathway.', 'Proteomics of Non-human Primate Plasma after Partial-body Radiation with Minimal Bone Marrow Sparing.']"""

To evaluate the clinical impact of SOX9 and its relationship with key genomic alterations in prostate cancer, SOX9 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 11,152 prostate cancers. Data on ERG status and deletions of PTEN, 3p13, 5q21 and 6q15 were available from earlier studies. SOX9 expression levels were comparable in luminal cells of normal prostate glands (50% SOX9 positive) and 3,671 cancers lacking TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (55% SOX9 positive), but was markedly increased in 3,116 ERG-fusion positive cancers (81% SOX9 positive, p<0.0001). While no unequivocal changes in the SOX9 expression levels were found in different stages of ERG-negative cancers, a gradual decrease of SOX9 paralleled progression to advanced stage, high Gleason grade, metastatic growth, and presence of PTEN deletions in ERG-positive cancers (p<0.0001 each). SOX9 levels were unrelated to deletions of 3p, 5q, and 6q. Down-regulation of SOX9 expression was particularly strongly associated with PSA recurrence in ERG-positive tumors harboring PTEN deletions (p=0.001), but had no significant effect in ERG-negative cancers or in tumors with normal PTEN copy numbers.

Essential for resistance, DHT synthesis from adrenal precursor steroids or possibly from de novo synthesis from cholesterol commonly requires enzymatic reactions by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD), steroid-5α-reductase (SRD5A) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) isoenzymes. Abiraterone, a steroidal 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) inhibitor, blocks this synthetic process and prolongs survival. We hypothesized that abiraterone is converted by an enzyme to the more active Δ(4)-abiraterone (D4A), which blocks multiple steroidogenic enzymes and antagonizes the androgen receptor, providing an additional explanation for abiraterone's clinical activity. Here we show that abiraterone is converted to D4A in mice and patients with prostate cancer. D4A inhibits CYP17A1, 3βHSD and SRD5A, which are required for DHT synthesis. Furthermore, competitive androgen receptor antagonism by D4A is comparable to the potent antagonist enzalutamide. D4A also has more potent anti-tumour activity against xenograft tumours than abiraterone. Our findings suggest an additional explanation-conversion to a more active agent-for abiraterone's survival extension. We propose that direct treatment with D4A would be more clinically effective than abiraterone treatment.""","""['Zhenfei Li', 'Andrew C Bishop', 'Mohammad Alyamani', 'Jorge A Garcia', 'Robert Dreicer', 'Dustin Bunch', 'Jiayan Liu', 'Sunil K Upadhyay', 'Richard J Auchus', 'Nima Sharifi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Pharmacology: How abiraterone works.', 'Clinical significance of D4A in prostate cancer therapy with abiraterone.', 'Resisting resistance: Establishing new treatment options for CRPC patients.', 'Redirecting abiraterone metabolism to fine-tune prostate cancer anti-androgen therapy.', 'Abiraterone inhibits 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase: a rationale for increasing drug exposure in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dihydrotestosterone synthesis pathways from inactive androgen 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol in prostate cancer cells: Inhibition of intratumoural 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities by abiraterone.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacological Efficacy of Repurposing Drugs in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Human cytochrome P450 17A1 structures with metabolites of prostate cancer drug abiraterone reveal substrate-binding plasticity and a second binding site.', 'Murine toxicology and pharmacokinetics of lead next generation galeterone analog, VNPP433-3β.', 'The clinical efficacy and limitations of dutasteride-regulated abiraterone metabolism in abiraterone-resistant patients: a prospective single-arm clinical trial in Chinese patients.']"""

Given that endothelial S100A4 can be a molecular target for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, we addressed here whether synthetic peptide capable of blocking S100A4-effector protein interaction could be a novel antiangiogenic agent. To examine this hypothesis, we focused on the S100A4-binding domain of methionine aminopeptidase 2, an effector protein, which plays a role in endothelial cell growth. Overexpression of the domain in mouse endothelial MSS31 cells reduced DNA synthesis, and the corresponding synthetic peptide (named NBD) indeed interacted with S100A4 and inhibited capillary formation in vitro and new blood vessel formation in vivo. Intriguingly, a single intra-tumor administration of the NBD peptide in human prostate cancer xenografts significantly reduced vascularity, resulting in tumor regression. Mechanistically, the NBD peptide enhanced assembly of nonmuscle myosin IIA filaments along with Ser1943 phosphorylation, stimulated formation of focal adhesions without phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, and provoked G1/S arrest of the cell cycle. Altogether, the NBD peptide is a potent inhibitor for tumor angiogenesis, and is the first example of an anticancer peptide drug developed on the basis of an endothelial S100A4-targeted strategy.""","""['Takahiro Ochiya', 'Keizo Takenaga', 'Masataka Asagiri', 'Kazumi Nakano', 'Hitoshi Satoh', 'Toshiki Watanabe', 'Shinobu Imajoh-Ohmi', 'Hideya Endo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev""","""['Inhibition of the invasion and metastasis of mammary carcinoma cells by NBD peptide targeting S100A4 via the suppression of the Sp1/MMP‑14 axis.', 'Structural features of methionine aminopeptidase2-active core peptide essential for binding with S100A4.', 'Correlation of two distinct metastasis-associated proteins, MTA1 and S100A4, in angiogenesis for promoting tumor growth.', 'Silencing of S100A4, a metastasis-associated protein, in endothelial cells inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth.', 'Metastasis-associated protein S100A4: spotlight on its role in cell migration.', 'New Angiogenic Regulators Produced by TAMs: Perspective for Targeting Tumor Angiogenesis.', 'Inhibition of the invasion and metastasis of mammary carcinoma cells by NBD peptide targeting S100A4 via the suppression of the Sp1/MMP‑14 axis.', 'Obesity reduces the anticancer effect of AdipoRon against orthotopic pancreatic cancer in diet-induced obese mice.', 'Molecular control of non-muscle myosin II assembly.']"""

In the first 20 years of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) era, screening for prostate cancer has successfully reduced prostate cancer mortality, but has led to significant problems with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. As a result, many men are subjected to unnecessary prostate biopsies and overtreatment of indolent cancer in order to save one man from dying of prostate cancer. A novel blood test known as the 4Kscore® Test (OPKO Lab, Nashville, TN) incorporates a panel of four kallikrein protein biomarkers (total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, and human kallikrein-related peptidase 2) and other clinical information in an algorithm that provides a percent risk for a high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 7) cancer on biopsy. In 10 peer-reviewed publications, the four kallikrein biomarkers and algorithm of the 4Kscore Test have been shown to improve the prediction not only of biopsy histopathology, but also surgical pathology and occurrence of aggressive, metastatic disease. Recently, a blinded prospective trial of the 4Kscore Test was conducted across the United States among 1012 men. The 4Kscore Test replicated previous European results showing accuracy in predicting biopsy outcome of Gleason score ≥ 7. In a recent case-control study nested within a population-based cohort from Västerbotten, Sweden, the four kallikrein biomarkers of the 4Kscore Test also predicted the risk for aggressive prostate cancer that metastasized within 20 years after the test was administered. These results indicate that men with an abnormal PSA or digital rectal examination result, and for whom an initial or repeat prostate biopsy is being considered, would benefit from a reflex 4Kscore Test to add important information to the clinical decision-making process. A high-risk 4Kscore Test result may be used to select men with a high probability of aggressive prostate cancer who would benefit from a biopsy of the prostate to prevent an adverse and potentially lethal outcome from prostate cancer. Men with a low 4Kscore Test result may safely defer biopsy.""","""['Sanoj Punnen', 'Nicola Pavan', 'Dipen J Parekh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Rev Urol""","""['The 4Kscore® Test Reduces Prostate Biopsy Rates in Community and Academic Urology Practices.', 'Reducing unnecessary biopsies while detecting clinically significant prostate cancer including cribriform growth with the ERSPC Rotterdam risk calculator and 4Kscore.', 'The 4Kscore blood test accurately identifies men with aggressive prostate cancer prior to prostate biopsy with or without DRE information.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', '4-Kallikrein Test and Kallikrein Markers in Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'MiR-21 Is Induced by Hypoxia and Down-Regulates RHOB in Prostate Cancer.', 'Circulating Chromosome Conformation Signatures Significantly Enhance PSA Positive Predicting Value and Overall Accuracy for Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'The potential of using circulating tumour cells and their gene expression to predict docetaxel response in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Predicting Grade group 2 or higher cancer at prostate biopsy by 4Kscore in blood and uCaP microRNA model in urine.', 'A Novel Combination of Serum Markers in a Multivariate Model to Help Triage Patients Into ""Low-"" and ""High-Risk"" Categories for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Combined docetaxel and estramustine improves survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. We assessed the effects of combined docetaxel and estramustine on relapse in patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer.  Methods:   We did this randomised phase 3 trial at 26 hospitals in France. We enrolled patients with treatment-naive prostate cancer and at least one risk factor (ie, stage T3-T4 disease, Gleason score of ≥8, prostate-specific antigen concentration >20 ng/mL, or pathological node-positive). All patients underwent a staging pelvic lymph node dissection. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; goserelin 10·8 mg every 3 months for 3 years) plus four cycles of docetaxel on day 2 at a dose of 70 mg/m(2) and estramustine 10 mg/kg per day on days 1-5, every 3 weeks, or ADT only. The randomisation was done centrally by computer, stratified by risk factor. Local treatment was administered at 3 months. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Follow-up for other endpoints is ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00055731.  Findings:   We randomly assigned 207 patients to the ADT plus docetaxel and estramustine group and 206 to the ADT only group. Median follow-up was 8·8 years (IQR 8·1-9·7). 88 (43%) of 207 patients in the ADT plus docetaxel and estramustine group had an event (relapse or death) versus 111 (54%) of 206 in the ADT only group. 8-year relapse-free survival was 62% (95% CI 55-69) in the ADT plus docetaxel and estramustine group versus 50% (44-57) in the ADT only group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·54-0·94, p=0·017). Of patients who were treated with radiotherapy and had data available, 31 (21%) of 151 in the ADT plus docetaxel and estramustine group versus 26 (18%) of 143 in the ADT only group reported a grade 2 or higher long-term side-effect (p=0·61). We recorded no excess second cancers (26 [13%] of 207 vs 22 [11%] of 206; p=0·57), and there were no treatment-related deaths.  Interpretation:   Docetaxel-based chemotherapy improves relapse-free survival in patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential the role of TRPM7 in the apoptosis of PC-3 cells, which is the key cell of advanced metastatic PCa. In this study, we demonstrated the influence and potential function of TRPM7 on the PC-3 cells apoptosis induced by TNF-related apoptosis inducing-ligand (TRAIL). The study also found a novel up-regulated expression of TRPM7 in PC-3 cells after treating with TRAIL. Suppression of TRPM7 by TRPM7 non-specific inhibitors (Gd3+ or 2-aminoethoxy diphenylborate (2-APB) ) not only markedly eliminated TRPM7 expression level, but also increased the apoptosis of TRAIL-treated PC-3 cells, which may be regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway accompany with up-regulated expression of cleaved Caspase-3, (TRAIL-receptor 1, death receptors 4) DR4, and (TRAIL-receptor 2, death receptors 5) DR5.

A recently developed taxane-cabazitaxel-has poor affinity for P-gp and is thereby effective in docetaxel-resistant CRPC. It has been recently demonstrated that exosomes in the body fluids could serve as a diagnostic marker because they contain proteins and RNAs specific to the cells from which they are derived. In this study, we aimed to investigate if P-gp in blood exosomes could be a marker to diagnose docetaxel resistance and select a taxoid for patients with CRPC.  Methods and materials:   Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer (PC-3) cells (PC-3R) and their parental PC-3 cells and from the serum of patients. Silencing of P-gp was performed by small interfering RNA transfection. Protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis. Viability of cells treated with docetaxel or cabazitaxel was determined by water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assay.  Results:   The level of P-gp was higher in exosomes as well as cell lysates from PC-3R cells than in those from PC-3 cells. Cabazitaxel effectively killed PC-3R cells, and MDR1 knockdown improved the sensitivity of PC-3R cells to docetaxel but not to cabazitaxel. The P-gp level in blood exosomes was relatively higher in clinically docetaxel-resistant patients than in therapy-naïve patients.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that detection of P-gp in blood exosomes, which is involved in resistance to docetaxel but not to cabazitaxel, could be useful to diagnose docetaxel resistance and select an appropriate taxoid for patients with CRPC-docetaxel or cabazitaxel.""","""['Taku Kato', 'Kosuke Mizutani', 'Koji Kameyama', 'Kyojiro Kawakami', 'Yasunori Fujita', 'Keita Nakane', 'Yusuke Kanimoto', 'Hidetoshi Ehara', 'Hiroyasu Ito', 'Mitsuru Seishima', 'Takashi Deguchi', 'Masafumi Ito']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Integrin β4 and vinculin contained in exosomes are potential markers for progression of prostate cancer associated with taxane-resistance.', 'CD44v8-10 mRNA contained in serum exosomes as a diagnostic marker for docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer patients.', 'EGFR mediates docetaxel resistance in human castration-resistant prostate cancer through the Akt-dependent expression of ABCB1 (MDR1).', 'Cabazitaxel: a novel second-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Toad venom-derived bufadienolides and their therapeutic application in prostate cancers: Current status and future directions.', 'The multiple combination of Paclitaxel, Ramucirumab and Elacridar reverses the paclitaxel-mediated resistance in gastric cancer cell lines.', 'Extracellular Vesicles in Liquid Biopsies as Biomarkers for Solid Tumors.', 'Exosomes in Genitourinary Cancers: Emerging Mediators of Drug Resistance and Promising Biomarkers.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.']"""

The study included 312 men index cases with family history of HBOCS and 61 MAC BRCA1/2 mutation-carriers. Family history, histological grade (HG), clinicopathological and immunohistochemistry data were collected. BRCA1/2 mutation analyses were performed by direct sequencing or screening methods and the large rearrangements by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification. We found 49 mutation-carriers (15.7%), 95.9% with BRCA2 mutations. BRCA2 mutation-carriers were associated with families with at least one MBC and one BC in female (type II; p = 0.05). Strong association were found between the presence of pathogenic mutations in MBCs and the advanced HG (p = 0.003). c.658_659delTG, c.2808_2811delACAA, c.6275_6276delTT and c.9026_9030delATCAT were the most prevalent mutations. In 61 MAC we found 20 mutations in BRCA1 and 41 in BRCA2. For MAC we show that mutational status was differentially associated with family history (p = 0.018) and tumor type, being BRCA2 mutations linked with BC and prostatic cancer (p = 0.018). MBC caused by BRCA1/2 mutations define two types of MBCs. The most frequent caused by BRCA2 mutation linked to type II families and the rarest one attributed to BRCA1 mutation.

Methods:   We elicited time-trade-off utilities for prostate cancer treatment outcomes from 168 men. We also elicited forecasted assessments, that is, an informal, non-quantitative, descriptive evaluation, of impotence and incontinence from these men. We used multivariate regression analysis to explore the relationship between forecasted assessment and reluctance to trade length for improved quality of life, that is, the unwillingness to trade length of life for improved quality of life in the time-trade-off utility assessment and the relationship between the forecasted assessments and the optimal decision of whether to undergo screening for prostate cancer as determined from a previously published decision-analytic model.  Results:   Importance of sexual function was strongly related to impotence utilities (P < 0.05). Based on the multivariate analysis, significant predictors for the utility of severe incontinence were family income, family history of prostate cancer, work status and attitude towards needing to wear an incontinence pad.

Nevertheless, the delivered radiation also irradiates normal tissues and dose escalation procedure often increases the elimination of normal tissue as well. In this article, we have developed theoretical frameworks under the premise of linear-quadratic-linear (LQL) model using stochastic differential equation and Jensen's inequality for exploring the possibility of attending to the two therapeutic performance objectives in contraposition-increasing the elimination of prostate tumour cells and enhancing the relative sparing of normal tissue in fractionated radiation therapy, within a prescribed limit of total radiation dose. Our study predicts that stochastic temporal modulation in radiation dose-rate appreciably enhances prostate tumour cell elimination, without needing dose escalation in radiation therapy. However, constant higher dose-rate can also enhance the elimination of tumour cells. In this context, we have shown that the sparing of normal tissue with stochastic dose-rate is considerably more than the sparing of normal tissue with the equivalent constant higher dose-rate. Further, by contrasting the stochastic dose-rate effects under LQL and linear-quadratic (LQ) models, we have also shown that the LQ model over-estimates stochastic dose-rate effect in tumour and under-estimates the stochastic dose-rate effect in normal tissue.

One hundred and four patients undergoing a TRUS-Bx in a single medical centre were prospectively enrolled in this study. In all patients, pre-biopsy rectal swabs were obtained. The analysis determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli strains to levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and a panel of other antibiotics. Before biopsy, each of the men received a levofloxacin-based prophylaxis. Telephone follow-up was used to identify patients who had complications after TRUS-Bx. Fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were isolated from 9.62 % of the patients. In all cases, there were related to E. coli and all those strains were resistant to both levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Fluoroquinolones showed greater antimicrobial activity against E. coli (p < 0.05) than ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalothin. Minor infectious complications occurred in three patients (2.91 %). The relation between the resistance of E. coli to fluoroquinolones and the risk of readmission, as well as infectious complications, was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Despite recent reports of increasing prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli and the associated increase of severe infectious complications, the presented results have not confirmed this phenomenon.

The cellular origin of IL6 in primary and metastatic prostate cancer was examined in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using a highly sensitive and specific chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) assay that underwent extensive analytical validation. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that benign prostate tissues often had higher expression of IL6 mRNA than matched tumor specimens. CISH analysis further indicated that both primary and metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma cells do not express IL6 mRNA. IL6 expression was highly heterogeneous across specimens and was nearly exclusively restricted to the prostate stromal compartment--including endothelial cells and macrophages, among other cell types. The number of IL6-expressing cells correlated positively with the presence of acute inflammation. In metastatic disease, tumor cells were negative in all lesions examined, and IL6 expression was restricted to endothelial cells within the vasculature of bone metastases.

By reducing intracellular dihydrotestosterone, dutasteride (dual 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) could increase the effectiveness of bicalutamide in this setting. The objective of the study is therefore to prospectively evaluate dutasteride plus bicalutamide in men with asymptomatic, non-metastatic CRPC with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Methods:   Prostate cancer patients with rising PSA whilst on first-line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were randomised (1:1) in a double-blind trial to receive bicalutamide 50mg plus placebo or bicalutamide 50mg plus dutasteride 3.5mg once daily for 18 months. Randomisation was stratified by centre; treatment assignments were generated using GlaxoSmithKline's RandAll System. Subjects who completed 18 months could participate in the 2-year extension. Central laboratory and study sites/monitors remained treatment-blinded. Primary end-point was time to disease progression (TDP) up to 42 months (defined as PSA progression from baseline or nadir, radiographic disease progression, death from prostate cancer or receipt of rescue medication).  Findings:   There was no statistically significant difference in TDP in 127 men treated with bicalutamide/dutasteride (n=62) compared with bicalutamide/placebo (n=65) (hazard ratio (HR)=0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61, 1.46]; p=0.79). The estimated median TDP was 425 days (95% CI 302, 858) in the bicalutamide/placebo group and 623 days (95% CI 369, 730) in the bicalutamide/dutasteride group. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups for any secondary efficacy end-points, including time to treatment failure or PSA response. In the multivariate analysis, age, non-White race, higher baseline testosterone and lower baseline PSA were associated with longer TDP. Adverse events were comparable between treatment groups.  Interpretation:   In men with non-metastatic CRPC, adding dutasteride to bicalutamide did not significantly prolong TDP.

Postprostatectomy incontinence is a significant burden on patients' emotional health and ability to perform activities of daily living.  Methods:   Between June 2012 and January 2014, we identified 50 men who had undergone AUS placement for postprostatectomy incontinence. All 50 men completed baseline Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-Urinary Domain (EPIC-UD) and Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form (UDI-6) questionnaires preoperatively. We evaluated patients' subjective postoperative continence status using the UDI-6 and EPIC-UD scales via a telephone-administered questionnaire.  Results:   Thirty-one of 50 patients (62%) were contacted and agreed to participate in the study. The pad score decreased significantly from 3 (median = 3 pads per day [ppd]; interquartile range [IQR] = 2) during minimal activity before surgery to 1 (median = 1.0 ppd; IQR = 0.5) after surgery (P <.001), and from 5 pads (median =5 ppd; IQR = 5) during strenuous activity to 1 pad (median = 1 ppd; IQR = 2; P <.001). QoL analysis pre- and post-AUS revealed a score increase of 16.5 points (P <.007) in EPIC-UD and an increase of 23.93 (P <.022) in UDI-6. Men reporting lower ppd before AUS placement were more likely to report higher public restroom urinal use (R = 0.366; P <.043) and increased public restroom comfort level (R = 0.342; P <.060) as compared with men with higher preoperative ppd usage.  Conclusion:   EPIC-UD and UDI-6 scores improved significantly and demonstrated high levels of correlation to self-reported ppd; however, both failed to show any correlation to patients' comfort level with public restrooms.

Methods:   Androgen-responsive LNCaP cells were treated with 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 10 nM) for 12-48 h, and their glycolytic metabolism, lactate production and viability were analyzed. Intracellular and extracellular levels of glucose and lactate were determined spectrophotometrically, and the expression of glucose transporters (GLUT1/GLUT3), phosphofructokinase 1, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT4) was analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot. The enzymatic activity of LDH was determined by means of a colorimetric assay. Experiments were reproduced in androgen-non-responsive DU145 and PC3 cells.  Results:   Androgens stimulated glucose consumption in LNCaP cells by increasing the expression of GLUT3, GLUT1 and PFK, which was underpinned by increased cell viability. Accordingly, lactate production by LNCaP cells was enhanced upon DHT stimulation as evidenced by the increased levels of lactate found in cell culture medium. Although LDH enzymatic activity decreased in LNCaP cells treated with DHT, the expression of MCT4 was significantly increased with androgenic treatment, which sustains the increase on lactate export. Glucose consumption and the expression of GLUTs and PFK remained unchanged in DHT-treated DU145 and PC3 cells.  Conclusions:   The results obtained establish androgens as modulators of glycolytic metabolism in PCa cells by stimulating glucose consumption, as well as the production and export of lactate, which may represent a crucial issue-driven prostate tumor development.

Our purpose is to report outcomes of urethroplasty for radiation-induced bulbomembranous urethral stenoses.  Methods:   Thirty-five patients underwent urethroplasty for refractory radiation-induced bulbomembranous stenoses from January 2004 to November 2013. Patients had a minimum follow-up of 12 months with routine cystoscopy at 6 and 12 months. Primary outcome was urethral patency, and secondary outcomes were 90-day complications, de novo incontinence, de novo erectile dysfunction and bothersome LUTS. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Of the 35 patients, 20 and 15 had stenosis related to external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy, respectively. Mean stricture length was 3.5 cm. Reconstruction was performed using anastomotic urethroplasty in 23 patients (65.7 %), while 12 required tissue transfer as a buccal mucosa graft (20.0 %) or penile island flap (14.3 %). With 50.5 months of follow-up, thirty patients (85.7 %) achieved cystoscopic patency with no significant difference between techniques (p = 0.32). A 90-day complication rate of 31.4 % was observed (all Clavien 1-2) with no difference between techniques (p = 1.00). Adverse change in continence occurred in 25.7 % of patients (13.3 % in those without previous TURP). Postoperatively, persisting storage LUTS occurred in 40.0 and 30.4 % described adverse change in erectile function (exclusively in the anastomotic urethroplasty group).

The aim of the study was to compare renal function detriments after LTA or PN.  Methods:   A Surveillance epidemiology and End Results-Medicare-linked retrospective cohort of 2850 T1 kidney cancer patients who underwent LTA or PN was abstracted. Short-term outcomes consisted of 30-day acute kidney injury (AKI) and 30-day dialysis rates. Long-term outcomes consisted of episodes of AKI, mild and moderate-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis and anemia in CKD. Analyses consisted of propensity score matching, logistic and Cox regression.  Results:   After propensity score matching, 1122 patients remained. The 30-day incidence of AKI was 4.6 % after LTA and 9.4 % after PN. In multivariable analyses (MVAs), LTA was associated with a lower AKI rate (OR 0.42; p = 0.001). The 30-day incidence of any dialysis was <2 % after either LTA or PN. In MVA, LTA was not associated with a lower rate of any dialysis (OR 0.43; p = 0.2). At long-term assessment, both the unadjusted and adjusted rates of all six examined end points were not different between LTA and PN (all p > 0.5).  Conclusions:   LTA offers short-term protective effect from AKI. The short-term rates of any dialysis treatment are similar after either LTA or PN. At long-term assessment, LTA and PN renal function detriment rates are not different.

Furthermore, we are aiming at finding preoperative parameters which predict an insignificant prostate carcinoma with higher accuracy. The current inclusion parameters of AS will be verified with regard to their reliability, and we will discuss the possibility of improving their prediction accuracy.  Methods:   We examined the data of 308 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with a clinically insignificant prostate carcinoma and therefore would be suited for AS, but opted for a radical prostatectomy. According to the literature(1), the following inclusion criteria were chosen for our evaluation: a proven prostate carcinoma, detected by either ultrasonically guided transrectal core needle biopsy (cT1c) with at least six obtained samples and with a maximum of two positive samples on one side and a less than a 50 % tumor rate per sample, or a 5 % or lower tumor rate found in the tissue obtained by transurethral prostate resection (cT1a). The PSA value in all cases was below 10 ng/ml and the Gleason Score ≤6. The probability of a preoperative ""undergrading"" or ""understaging"" was determined as a function of preoperative parameters like Gleason Score, PSA value, the number of collected samples and positive samples obtained by core needle biopsy, prostate volume, and PSA density. Based on the available preoperative data, we developed and tested several regression models for the identification of independent factors for upgrading and upstaging.  Results:   Within the examined patient population, 232 of 308 patients (75 %) were, according to their final prostate histology, diagnosed with a stage ≥pT2b prostate carcinoma. Eight percentage of the patients who had undergone surgery had a stage ≥pT3a carcinoma, and 118 of 308 (38 %) had a Gleason Score of 6 or higher. Positive lymph nodes and an infiltration of the seminal vesicle each occurred in 1 % of the cases. Histopathologic positive margins of resection existed in 33 of 308 patients (11 %). Independent factors for upgrading and upstaging a prostate volume of <50 ml and a preoperative Gleason Score of ≤6 were identified.  Conclusion:   The presented results show that the current inclusion criteria for AS are insufficient. For many patients, the beginning of the necessary therapy is delayed. According to our data, the prostate volume, the preoperative Gleason Score, and the number of positive samples obtained by transrectal core needle biopsy have the highest predictive power with regard to aggressiveness and expansion of the tumor. Despite the consideration of all these preoperative parameters, the differentiation of the prostate carcinomas was underrated in a third of all cases. The expansion of the tumor within the prostate was underrated even in three fourths of the cases.""","""['Ekaterina Lellig', 'Christian Gratzke', 'Alexander Kretschmer', 'Christian Stief']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Radical prostatectomy for impalpable prostate cancer: the Johns Hopkins experience with tumors found on transurethral resection (stages T1A and T1B) and on needle biopsy (stage T1C).', 'Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Incidence of upgrading and upstaging in patients with low-volume Gleason score 3+4 prostate cancers at biopsy: finding a new group eligible for active surveillance.', 'Prostate-specific antigen vs prostate-specific antigen density as a predictor of upgrading in men diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer by contemporary multicore prostate biopsy.', 'Diagnostic problems and prognostic factors in prostate cancer.', 'Adverse Pathology after Radical Prostatectomy of Patients Eligible for Active Surveillance-A Summary 7 Years after Introducing mpMRI-Guided Biopsy in a Real-World Setting.', 'Current concepts in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'Postoperative upgrading of prostate cancer in men ≥75\xa0years: a propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Radical prostatectomy as part of a multimodal concept for patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases at initial diagnosis.', 'Pathologic correlation of transperineal in-bore 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate biopsy samples with radical prostatectomy specimen.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between March 2007 and September 2013, clinical, pathological and biological data were prospectively collected for patients referred for radical prostatectomy in a single European center. Preoperative total testosterone (TT) and bioavailable testosterone (bioT) serum determinations were performed. The threshold for hypogonadism was set at TT <3 ng/mL. The preoperative PSA value was registered. Gleason score (GS) and predominant Gleason pattern (PrdGP) were determined in prostate tissue specimens, and crosschecked by two uro-pathologists. Statistical analyzes were done for PrdGP4 risk assessment.  Results:   A total of 937 consecutive patients were included. One hundred and thirty-five filled the criterion for obesity (14.4%), out of which 42 had TT <3 ng/mL (31.1%), while in non-obese patients, only 97 had TT <3 ng/mL (12.0%). In prostate specimens, mean GS was 6.8±0.5: 291 patients (31.1%) had a PrdGP4. The incidence of PrdGP4 was higher (p<0.001) in the 135 obese patients [50% when hypogonadal (p<0.02) or 42% when eugonadal (p<0.005)] than in non-obese patients (28.9% and 27.1%, respectively). In multivariable analyzis for PrdGP4 risk, obesity, TT <3 ng/mL, PSA, and age were independent risk factors.

Since part of this link may be due to genetics, we evaluated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune response genes and prostate cancer in the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.  Methods:   We genotyped 16 candidate SNPs in IL1β, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12(p40), IFNG, MSR1, RNASEL, TLR4, and TNFA and seven tagSNPs in IL10 in 881 prostate cancer cases and 848 controls negative for cancer on an end-of-study biopsy. Cases and controls were non-Hispanic white and frequency matched on age and family history. We classified cases as lower (Gleason sum <7; N = 674) and higher (7-10; N = 172) grade, and used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusting for age and family history.  Results:   The minor allele (C) of rs3212227 in IL12(p40) was associated with an increased risk of total (log additive: OR = 1.30, 95%CI 1.10-1.53; P-trend = 0.0017) and lower-grade (OR = 1.36, 95%CI 1.15-1.62; P-trend = 0.0004) prostate cancer. The minor allele (A) of rs4073 in IL8 was possibly associated with a decreased risk of higher-grade (OR = 0.81, 95%CI 0.64-1.02; P-trend = 0.07), but not total disease. None of the other candidates was associated with risk. The minor alleles of IL10 tagSNPs rs1800890 (A; OR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.75-0.99; P-trend = 0.04) and rs3021094 (C; OR = 1.31, 95%CI 1.03-1.66, P-trend = 0.03) were associated with risk; the latter also with lower- (P-trend = 0.04) and possibly higher- (P-trend = 0.06) grade disease. These patterns were similar among men with PSA <2 ng/ml at biopsy.  Conclusion:   Variation in some immune response genes may be associated with prostate cancer risk.

VitD is promoted for PCa prevention, but there is conflicting data on the association between vitD and PCa. We examined the association between serum vitD and dietary quercetin and their interaction with PCa risk in AA men.  Methods:   Participants included 90 AA men with PCa undergoing treatment at Howard University Hospital (HUH) and 62 controls participating in HUH's free PCa screening program. We measured serum 25-hydroxy vitD [25(OH)D] and used the 98.2 item Block Brief 2000 Food Frequency Questionnaires to measure dietary intake of quercetin and other nutrients. Case and control groups were compared using a two-sample t-test for continuous risk factors and a Fisher exact test for categorical factors. Associations between risk factors and PCa risk were examined via age-adjusted logistic regression models.  Results:   Interaction effects of dietary quercetin and serum vitD on PCa status were observed. AA men (age 40-70) with normal levels of serum vitD (>30 ng/ml) had a 71% lower risk of PCa compared to AA men with vitD deficiency (OR = 0.29, 95%CI: 0.08-1.03; P = 0.055). In individuals with vitD deficiency, increased dietary quercetin showed a tendency toward lower risk of PCa (OR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.82-1.00; P = 0.054, age-adjusted) while men with normal vitD were at elevated risk (OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.04-1.45).  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that AA men who are at a higher risk of PCa may benefit more from vitD intake, and supplementation with dietary quercetin may increase the risk of PCa in AA men with normal vitD levels.

In the present study, we investigate the chemopreventive potential of capsaicin on prostate cancer using the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. The TRAMP is a murine model that resembles the progression of human disease.  Methods:   Thirty-five 6-week-old TRAMP x C57BL/6 mice were randomized between treatment with capsaicin (5 mg/kg body weight) or control (saline) three times a week by oral gavage until 30 weeks of age. Body weight of animals was recorded thrice weekly. At termination, all tumors were extracted, recorded, and analyzed for histopathological analysis. To understand the effect of capsaicin on migration and invasion, in vitro experiments were carried out using PC3 cells.  Results:   Mice in the control group expressed an overall trend of higher-grade disease with 37.5% poorly differentiated (PD), 18.75% moderately differentiated (MD), and 44% of well-differentiated (WD) adenocarcinoma, compared to the capsaicin-treated group with only 27.7% PD, 61.0% of WD, and 11.1% of intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). The treatment group demonstrated a higher incidence of noncancerous PIN lesions compared to the control group. The capsaicin group also demonstrated a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the metastatic burden compared to the controls, which correlated to a reduction in p27(Kip) (1) expression and neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate tumors. Furthermore, there were no differences in body weight between groups overtime, and no pathological toxicities in the liver and gastrointestinal tract with capsaicin consumption. In vitro studies revealed a dose-dependent reduction in the invasion and migration capacity of PC3 cells.

In all cases, stromal cells preferentially adhered to more invasive cancer cells. Modulating integrin and cadherin binding affinities with calcium chelation revealed that adhesion was independent of integrin activity but required cadherin function. Invasive cancer cells had increased expression of mesenchymal markers cadherin 2 and 11 that localized with stromal cell cadherin 11, suggesting that these molecules are involved in stromal cell engraftment.

However, the etiology of these events remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that triggering of the innate immune receptor, Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9), in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells initiates signaling cascade leading to increased tumor growth and progression. Using limited dilution/serial transplantation experiments, we show that TLR9 is essential for prostate cancer cells' potential to propagate and self-renew in vivo. Furthermore, low expression or silencing of TLR9 limits the clonogenic potential and mesenchymal stem cell-like properties of LNCaP- and PC3-derived prostate cancer cell variants. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of prostate cancer cells isolated from xenotransplanted TLR9-positive and -negative tumors revealed a unique gene expression signature, with prominent upregulation of inflammation- and stem cell-related markers. TLR9 signaling orchestrated expression of critical stem cell-related genes such as NKX3.1, KLF-4, BMI-1 and COL1A1, at both mRNA and protein levels. Our further analysis identified that TLR9-induced NF-κB/RELA and STAT3 transcription factors co-regulated NKX3.1 and KLF4 gene expression by directly binding to both promoters.

Higher frequency of mutations in DNA polymerase kappa (POLK) recently been reported in prostate cancer. We sequenced entire exons of the POLK gene on genomic DNA from 40 prostate cancers and matched normal samples. We identified that 28% of patients have somatic mutations in the POLK gene of the prostate tumors. Mutations in these prostate cancers have somatic mutation spectra, which are dominated by C-to-T transitions. In the current study, we further investigate the effect of p.E29K, p.G154E, p.F155S, p.E430K, p.L442F, and p.E449K mutations on the biochemical properties of the polymerase in vitro, using TLS assay and nucleotide incorporation fidelity, following site-directed mutagenesis bacterial expression, and purification of the respective polymerase variants. We report that following missense mutations p.E29K, p.G154E, p.F155S, p.E430K, and p.L442F significantly diminished the catalytic efficiencies of POLK with regard to the lesion bypass (AP site). POLK variants show extraordinarily low fidelity by misincorporating T, C, and G as compared to wild-type variants.

It was originally recognized as an oncogene, and was frequently found to be amplified in prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon carcinoma, esophageal cancer, dog lymphomas and breast cancer. In the present study, the complete RNPC1 gene was identified in a number of vertebrate genomes, suggesting that RNPC1 exists in all types of vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. In the different genomes, the gene had a similar 4 exon/3 intron organization, and all the genetic loci were syntenically conserved. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the RNPC1 gene from the mammalian, bird, reptile and teleost lineage formed a species-specific cluster. A total of 34 functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 14 SNPs causing missense mutations, 8 exonic splicing enhancer SNPs and 12 SNPs causing nonsense mutations, were identified in the human RNPC1 gene. RNPC1 was found to be expressed in bladder, blood, brain, breast, colorectal, eye, head and neck, lung, ovarian, skin and soft tissue cancer. In 14 of the 94 tests, an association between RNPC1 gene expression and cancer prognosis was observed. We found that the association between the expression of RNPC1 and prognosis varied in different types of cancer, and even in the same type of cancer from the different databases used. This suggests that the function of RNPC1 in these tumors may be multidimensional.

DU145cells were stably transfected with lentivirus-mediated shRNA for c-kit silencing.  Results:   C-kit expression in prostate cancer was found to be significantly higher than in benign prostatic hyperplasia and positively associated with Gleason scores. The growth, migration and capacity of clonogenic property of DU145 cells significantly increased upon exposure to peripheral stromal CM and then were inhibited after silencing the expression of c-kit. The levels of c-kit, pJAK2 and pSTAT1 were significantly induced by peripheral zone stromal CM compared with controls in serum free medium and the levels of pJAK2 and pSTAT1 decreased after c-kit silencing.  Conclusions:   C-kit hyper-expression promotes the development of prostate cancer.

Methods:   We analyzed a single-surgeon series of 2036 RALP cases between 2003 and 2014. Days between cases (DBC) was calculated as the number of days elapsed since the surgeon's previous RALP with the second start cases assigned 0 DBC. Surgeon experience was assessed by dividing sequential case experience into cases 0-99, cases 100-249, cases 250-999, and cases 1000+ based on previously reported learning curve data for RALP. Outcomes included estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time (OT), and positive surgical margins (PSMs). Multiple linear regression was used to assess the impact of the DBC and surgeon experience on EBL, OT, and PSM, while controlling for patient characteristics, surgical technique, and pathologic variables.  Results:   Overall median DBC was 1 day (0-3) and declined with increasing surgeon case experience. Multiple linear regression demonstrated that each additional DBC was independently associated with increased EBL [β = 3.7, 95% CI (1.3-6.2), p < 0.01] and OT [β = 2.3 (1.4-3.2), p < 0.01], but was not associated with rate of PSM [β = 0.004 (-0.003-0.010), p = 0.2]. Increased experience was also associated with reductions in EBL and OT (p < 0.01). Surgeon experience of 1000+ cases was associated with a 10% reduction in PSM rate (p = 0.03) compared to cases 0-99.

Methods:   We used population-based cancer registry data, supplemented by information on PSA testing, life expectancy and mortality from Lithuania to examine age-specific prostate cancer incidence, mortality and survival trends among men aged 40+ between 1978 and 2009, as well as life expectancy of screening-eligible men, and the proportion of men with a first PSA test per year since the programme started.  Results:   The number of prostate cancer patients rose from 2.237 in 1990-1994 to 15.294 in 2005-2009. By 2010, around 70% of the eligible population was tested, on average around two times. The early detection programme brought about the highest prostate cancer incidence peaks ever seen in a country to date. Recent incidence and survival rises in the age groups 75-84 suggest PSA testing in the elderly non-eligible population. Life expectancy of men aged 70-74 indicates that less than 30% of patients will live for 15 years and may have a chance to benefit from early detection.  Conclusions:   Early detection among men aged 70-74, and particularly among the elderly (75+) may have to be reconsidered.

Conventional methods for exosome isolation based on their physical properties such as size and density (filtration, ultracentrifugation or density gradient), or relying on their differential solubility (chemical precipitation) are established primarily for processing of cell supernatants and later adjusted to complex biological samples such as plasma. Though still representing gold standard in the field, these methods are clearly suboptimal for processing of routine clinical samples and have intrinsic limits that impair their use in biomarker discovery and development of novel diagnostics. Immunoisolation (IA) offers unique advantages for the recovery of exosomes from complex and viscous fluids, in terms of increased efficiency and specificity of exosome capture, integrity and selective origin of isolated vesicles. We have evaluated several commercially available solutions for immunoplate- and immunobead-based affinity isolation and have further optimized protocols to decrease non-specific binding due to exosomes complexity and matrix contaminants. In order to identify best molecular targets for total exosome capture from diverse biological sources, as well as for selective enrichment in populations of interest (e.g. tumor derived exosomes) several exosome displayed proteins and respective antibodies have been evaluated for plate and bead functionalisation. Moreover, we have optimized and directly implemented downstream steps allowing on-line quantification and characterization of bound exosome markers, namely proteins and RNAs. Thus assembled assays enabled rapid overall quantification and validation of specific exosome associated targets in/on plasma exosomes, with multifold increased yield and enrichment ratio over benchmarking technologies. Assays directly coupling selective immobilization of exosomes to a solid phase and their immune- and or molecular profiling through conventional ELISA and PCR analysis, resulted in easy-to-elaborate, quantitative readouts, with high low-end sensitivity and dynamic range, low costs and hands-on time, minimal sample handling and downscaling of a working plasma volumes to as few as 100 μl.""","""['Natasa Zarovni', 'Antonietta Corrado', 'Paolo Guazzi', 'Davide Zocco', 'Elisa Lari', 'Giorgia Radano', 'Jekatarina Muhhina', 'Costanza Fondelli', 'Julia Gavrilova', 'Antonio Chiesi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Methods""","""['Integrated systems for exosome investigation.', 'An optimized procedure for exosome isolation and analysis using serum samples: Application to cancer biomarker discovery.', 'A protocol for exosome isolation and characterization: evaluation of ultracentrifugation, density-gradient separation, and immunoaffinity capture methods.', 'Surfaceome profiling enables isolation of cancer-specific exosomal cargo in liquid biopsies from pancreatic cancer patients.', 'Methods of isolating extracellular vesicles impact down-stream analyses of their cargoes.', 'Liquid Biopsy at the Frontier of Kidney Diseases: Application of Exosomes in Diagnostics and Therapeutics.', 'Progress in Isolation and Molecular Profiling of Small Extracellular Vesicles via Bead-Assisted Platforms.', 'Emerging Roles of Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal-Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in Cancer Therapy.', 'Plant-Derived Exosome-like Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications and Regenerative Therapy.', 'On the other end of the line: Extracellular vesicle-mediated communication in glaucoma.']"""

We investigated psychological factors that promote the comprehension of benefits and harms associated with common cancer screenings and their influence on shared decision making.  Methods:   In experiment 1, 256 men received information about PSA-based prostate cancer screening. In experiment 2, 355 women received information about mammography-based breast cancer screening. In both studies, information about potential screening outcomes was provided in 1 of 3 formats: text, a fact box, or a visual aid (e.g., mortality with and without screening and rate of overdiagnosis). We modeled the interplay of comprehension, perceived risks and benefits, intention to participate in screening, and desire for shared decision making.  Results:   Generally, visual aids were the most effective format, increasing comprehension by up to 18%. Improved comprehension was associated with 1) superior decision making (e.g., fewer intentions to participate in screening when it offered no benefit) and 2) more desire to share in decision making. However, comprehension of the evidence had a limited effect on experienced emotions, risk perceptions, and decision making among those participants who felt that the consequences of cancer were extremely severe.  Conclusions:   Even when information is counterintuitive and requires the integration of complex harms and benefits, user-friendly risk communications can facilitate comprehension, improve high-stakes decisions, and promote shared decision making.

Aim:   The aim of this study was to evaluate per-core detection rates (DRs) of targeted biopsies and systematic biopsies and to test if SWE findings can predict presence of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) at biopsy.  Patients and methods:   Overall, 95 patients scheduled for prostate biopsy in our center underwent SWE. SWE findings were classified into suspicious or normal. Targeted biopsies were taken in up to 3 SWE-suspicious areas. csPCa was defined as the presence of Gleason pattern ≥4, level of prostate-specific antigen ≥10 ng/ml or >2 positive cores.  Results:   Overall DR for csPCa in our study cohort was 40%. Per-core DR for exclusively SWE-targeted cores versus systematic samples cores was 10.5 vs. 8.6% (p = 0.3). In the logistic regression models, individuals with suspicious SWE findings are at 6.4-fold higher risk of harboring csPCa (p = 0.03). Gain in predictive accuracy was 2.3% (0.82 vs. 0.84, p = 0.01).  Conclusions:   Presence of suspicious SWE findings is an independent predictor of csPCa. Therefore, SWE may be helpful in selecting patients for biopsy. Nonetheless, per-core DR for SWE-targeted cores was not statistically significant higher than DR of systematic sampled cores.

PPRHs are hairpins formed by two antiparallel polypurine strands bound by intramolecular Hoogsteen bonds linked by a pentathymidine loop. These hairpins are able to bind to their target DNA sequence through Watson-Crick bonds producing specific silencing of gene expression. We designed PPRHs against the following genes: BCL2, TOP1, mTOR, MDM2, and MYC and tested them for mRNA levels, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis in prostate, pancreas, colon, and breast cancer cell lines. Even though all PPRHs were effective, the most remarkable results were obtained with those against BCL2 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in decreasing cell survival and mRNA levels and increasing apoptosis in prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancer cells. In the case of TOP1, MDM2, and MYC, their corresponding PPRHs produced a strong effect in decreasing cell viability and mRNA levels and increasing apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Thus, we confirm that the PPRH technology is broadly useful to silence the expression of cancer-related genes as demonstrated using target genes involved in metabolism (DHFR), proliferation (mTOR), DNA topology (TOP1), lifespan and senescence (telomerase), apoptosis (survivin, BCL2), transcription factors (MYC), and proto-oncogenes (MDM2).""","""['Xenia Villalobos', 'Laura Rodríguez', 'Anna Solé', 'Carolina Lliberós', 'Núria Mencia', 'Carlos J Ciudad', 'Véronique Noé']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nucleic Acid Ther""","""['Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen Hairpins as a Gene Silencing Tool for Cancer.', 'Coding polypurine hairpins cause target-induced cell death in breast cancer cells.', 'Polypurine reverse Hoogsteen hairpins as a gene therapy tool against survivin in human prostate cancer PC3 cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Nucleic acids therapeutics using PolyPurine Reverse Hoogsteen hairpins.', 'Polypurine hairpins directed against the template strand of DNA knock down the expression of mammalian genes.', 'In Vitro and In Vivo Effects of the Combination of Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen Hairpins against HER-2 and Trastuzumab in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting MYC Regulation with Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen Oligonucleotides.', 'Indoloquinoline-Mediated Targeted Downregulation of KRAS through Selective Stabilization of the Mid-Promoter G-Quadruplex Structure.', 'Targeting KRAS Regulation with PolyPurine Reverse Hoogsteen Oligonucleotides.', 'Gene Correction of Point Mutations Using PolyPurine Reverse Hoogsteen Hairpins Technology.']"""

It is characterized by coincidental upregulation of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin, fibronectin and N-cadherin concurrent with E-cadherin downregulation. Studies on EMT are generally performed in cell lines and mouse models, while the histopathological and phenotypical properties in clinical prostate cancer (PCa) are still unclear. The objective of this study was to identify EMT in PCa patients. We demonstrated that N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin were generally not co-expressed in corresponding tumor regions. Immunofluorescent double stainings confirmed that co-expression of mesenchymal markers was uncommon, as we found no prostate cancer cells that co-expressed N-cadherin with fibronectin and only rare (<1%) cells that co-expressed N-cadherin with vimentin.

Among Ephs and ephrins, only EphA6 is consistently overexpressed in metastatic CaP cells. Metastatic potential of EphA6 is assessed by RNAi in a CaP spontaneous metastasis mouse model. EphA6 knock-down in human PC-3M cells causes decreased invasion in vitro and reduced lung and lymph node metastasis in vivo. In addition, knock-down of EphA6 decreases tube formation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. EphA6 mRNA expression is higher in 112 CaP tumor samples compared with benign tissues from 58 benign prostate hyperplasia patients. Positive correlation was identified between EphA6 expression and vascular invasion, neural invasion, PSA level, and TNM staging in CaP cases.

Methods:   As an initial validation, paraffin-embedded prostatectomy specimen blocks with both normal and malignant prostate tissue were analysed for CHKA protein and mRNA expression by western blot and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively. Subsequently, 100 paraffin-embedded malignant prostate tumour and 25 normal prostate cores were stained for both Ki67 (labelling-index: LI) and CHKA expression.  Results:   The validity of CHKA-antibody was verified using CHKA-transfected cells and siRNA knockdown. Immunoblotting of tissues showed good resolution of CHKA protein in malignant prostate, verifying use of the antibody for IHC. There was minimal qRT-PCR detectable CHKA mRNA in normal tissue, and conversely high expression in malignant prostate tissues. IHC of normal prostate cores showed mild (intensity) CHKA expression in only 28% (7/25) of samples with no Ki67 expression. In contrast, CHKA was expressed in all malignant prostate cores along with characteristically low proliferation (median 2% Ki67-LI; range 1-17%). Stratification of survival according to CHK intensity showed a trend towards lower progression-free survival with CHK score of 3.  Conclusions:   Increased expression of CHKA, detectable by IHC, is seen in malignant lesions.

This has led to many approaches seeking to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. We previously reported that a DNA vaccine encoding the cancer-testis antigen SSX2, modified to encode altered epitopes with increased MHC class I affinity, elicited a greater frequency of cytolytic, multifunctional CD8(+) T cells in non-tumor-bearing mice. We sought to test whether this optimized vaccine resulted in increased antitumor activity in mice bearing an HLA-A2-expressing tumor engineered to express SSX2. We found that immunization of tumor-bearing mice with the optimized vaccine elicited a surprisingly inferior antitumor effect relative to the native vaccine. Both native and optimized vaccines led to increased expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, but antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells from mice immunized with the optimized construct expressed higher PD-1. Splenocytes from immunized animals induced PD-L1 expression on tumor cells in vitro. Antitumor activity of the optimized vaccine could be increased when combined with antibodies blocking PD-1 or PD-L1, or by targeting a tumor line not expressing PD-L1. These findings suggest that vaccines aimed at eliciting effector CD8(+) T cells, and DNA vaccines in particular, might best be combined with PD-1 pathway inhibitors in clinical trials.

By considering the change in neighbourhood size at a static boundary--such as a blood vessel, organ capsule or basement membrane--we show an edge effect that allows a tumour without invasive phenotypes in the bulk to have a polyclonal boundary with invasive cells. We present an example of this promotion of invasive (epithelial-mesenchymal transition-positive) cells in a metastatic colony of prostate adenocarcinoma in bone marrow. Our results caution that pathologic analyses that do not distinguish between cells in the bulk and cells at a static edge of a tumour can underestimate the number of invasive cells.

However, its effectiveness relies on sufficient image quality for the fiducial tracking task. To guide the performance characterisation of KIM under different clinically relevant conditions, the effect of different kV parameters and patient size on image quality, and quantification of MV scatter from the patient to the kV detector panel were investigated in this study. Image quality was determined for a range of kV acquisition frame rates, kV exposure, MV dose rates and patient sizes. Two methods were used to determine image quality; the ratio of kV signal through the patient to the MV scatter from the patient incident on the kilovoltage detector, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The effect of patient size and frame rate on MV scatter was evaluated in a homogeneous CIRS pelvis phantom and marker segmentation was determined utilising the Rando phantom with embedded markers. MV scatter incident on the detector was shown to be dependent on patient thickness and frame rate. The segmentation code was shown to be successful for all frame rates above 3 Hz for the Rando phantom corresponding to a kV to MV ratio of 0.16 and an SNR of 1.67. For a maximum patient dimension less than 36.4 cm the conservative kV parameters of 5 Hz at 1 mAs can be used to reduce dose while retaining image quality, where the current baseline kV parameters of 10 Hz at 1 mAs is shown to be adequate for marker segmentation up to a patient dimension of 40 cm. In conclusion, the MV scatter component of image quality noise for KIM has been quantified. For most prostate patients, use of KIM with 10 Hz imaging at 1 mAs is adequate however image quality can be maintained and imaging dose reduced by altering existing acquisition parameters.""","""['D Wallace', 'J A Ng', 'P J Keall', ""R T O'Brien"", 'P R Poulsen', 'P Juneja', 'J T Booth']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Current modulated volume-of-interest imaging for kilovoltage intrafaction monitoring of the prostate.', 'Improved quality of intrafraction kilovoltage images by triggered readout of unexposed frames.', 'Analysis of image quality for real-time target tracking using simultaneous kV-MV imaging.', 'A deep learning framework for automatic detection of arbitrarily shaped fiducial markers in intrafraction fluoroscopic images.', 'Combined kV and MV imaging for real-time tracking of implanted fiducial markers.', 'Quantification and correction of the scattered X-rays from a megavoltage photon beam to a linac-mounted kilovoltage imaging subsystem.', 'Effect of patient size on image quality in radiotherapy kV planar verification imaging: a phantom study.', '3D-printed breast phantom for multi-purpose and multi-modality imaging.', 'Evaluating the image quality of cone beam CT acquired during rotational delivery.']"""

PC-3 cells exhibited 4.2-fold higher GSH concentration than LNCaP cells but only modest differences in acute cytotoxicity were observed at certain time points. However, only LNCaP cells underwent diamide-induced apoptosis. PC-3 cells exhibited higher levels of Bax and caspase-8 cleavage product but lower levels of Bcl-2 than LNCaP cells. However, LNCaP cells exhibited higher expression of Fas receptor (FasR) but also higher levels of several stress response and antioxidant proteins than PC-3 cells.

This paradigm shift necessitates a change in the acceptance criteria and action tolerance for QA. Here we present a knowledge based technique to objectively quantify degradations in DVH for prostate radiotherapy. Using machine learning, organ-at-risk (OAR) DVHs from a population of 198 prior patients' plans were adapted to a test patient's anatomy to establish patient-specific DVH ranges. This technique was applied to single arc prostate VMAT plans to evaluate various simulated delivery errors: systematic single leaf offsets, systematic leaf bank offsets, random normally distributed leaf fluctuations, systematic lag in gantry angle of the mutli-leaf collimators (MLCs), fluctuations in dose rate, and delivery of each VMAT arc with a constant rather than variable dose rate.Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic suggests V75Gy dose limits of 15% for the rectum and 25% for the bladder, however the knowledge based constraints were more stringent: 8.48 ± 2.65% for the rectum and 4.90 ± 1.98% for the bladder. 19 ± 10 mm single leaf and 1.9 ± 0.7 mm single bank offsets resulted in rectum DVHs worse than 97.7% (2σ) of clinically accepted plans. PTV degradations fell outside of the acceptable range for 0.6 ± 0.3 mm leaf offsets, 0.11 ± 0.06 mm bank offsets, 0.6 ± 1.3 mm of random noise, and 1.0 ± 0.7° of gantry-MLC lag.Utilizing a training set comprised of prior treatment plans, machine learning is used to predict a range of achievable DVHs for the test patient's anatomy. Consequently, degradations leading to statistical outliers may be identified. A knowledge based QA evaluation enables customized QA criteria per treatment site, institution and/or physician and can often be more sensitive to errors than criteria based on organ complication rates.""","""['Carl Stanhope', 'Q Jackie Wu', 'Lulin Yuan', 'Jianfei Liu', 'Rodney Hood', 'Fang-Fang Yin', 'Justus Adamson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Sensitivity of volumetric modulated arc therapy patient specific QA results to multileaf collimator errors and correlation to dose volume histogram based metrics.', 'Accuracy of one algorithm used to modify a planned DVH with data from actual dose delivery.', 'Quantification of residual dose estimation error on log file-based patient dose calculation.', 'Quality management in radiotherapy treatment delivery.', 'Introducing new technologies into the clinic.', 'Mitigation of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning Errors on the Novel RefleXion X1 System Using Failure Mode and Effect Analysis Within Six Sigma Framework.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Clinical Target Volumes for Post-Modified Radical Mastectomy Radiotherapy Using Convolutional Neural Networks.', 'Optimizing efficiency and safety in external beam radiotherapy using automated plan check (APC) tool and six sigma methodology.', 'Applications and limitations of machine learning in radiation oncology.', 'Knowledge-based planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A review of data-driven approaches.']"""

Complementary to the reductive activation of LNM by cellular thiols, LNM E1 can be oxidatively activated by cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) to generate a similar episulfonium ion intermediate, thereby alkylating DNA and leading to eventual cell death. The feasibility of exploiting LNM E1 as an anticancer prodrug activated by ROS was demonstrated in two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and DU-145. Because many cancer cells are under higher cellular oxidative stress with increased levels of ROS than normal cells, these findings support the idea of exploiting ROS as a means to target cancer cells and highlight LNM E1 as a novel lead for the development of anticancer prodrugs activated by ROS.

Previous USPSTF recommendations did not appreciably alter prostate cancer screening. Therefore, we designed a trend analysis to determine the population-based impact of the 2012 recommendation.  Methods:   The nationally representative National Health Interview Survey was used to estimate the proportion of men age 40 years and older who saw a physician and were screened for prostate cancer in 2013. An externally validated 9-year mortality index was used to analyze screening rates based on remaining life expectancy. Screening rates from 2005, 2010, and 2013 were compared using logistic regression.  Results:   PSA-based screening did not significantly change from 2010 to 2013 among 40- to 49-year-old men (from 12.5% to 11.2%; P = .4). Screening rates significantly declined in men age 50 to 59 years (from 33.2% to 24.8%; P < .01), age 60 to 74 years (from 51.2% to 43.6%; P < .01), and age 75 years or older (from 43.9% to 37.1%; P = .03). A large percentage of men were screened for prostate cancer despite a high risk (> 52%) of 9-year mortality, including approximately one third of men older than age 75 years. Approximately 1.4 million men age 65 years or older with a high risk (> 52%) of 9-year mortality were screened in 2013.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer screening significantly declined among men older than age 50 years after the 2012 USPSTF guideline discouraging PSA-based screening.

Alternative splicing of the AR to generate constitutively active, ligand-independent variants is one of the principal mechanisms that promote the development of resistance to next-generation antiandrogens such as enzalutamide. Here, we demonstrate that the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear RNA-binding protein A1 (hnRNPA1) plays a pivotal role in the generation of AR splice variants such as AR-V7. hnRNPA1 is overexpressed in prostate tumors compared with benign prostates, and its expression is regulated by NF-κB2/p52 and c-Myc. CRPC cells resistant to enzalutamide exhibit higher levels of NF-κB2/p52, c-Myc, hnRNPA1, and AR-V7. Levels of hnRNPA1 and AR-V7 are positively correlated with each other in prostate cancer. The regulatory circuit involving NF-κB2/p52, c-Myc, and hnRNPA1 plays a central role in the generation of AR splice variants. Downregulation of hnRNPA1 and consequently of AR-V7 resensitizes enzalutamide-resistant cells to enzalutamide, indicating that enhanced expression of hnRNPA1 may confer resistance to AR-targeted therapies by promoting the generation of splice variants. These findings may provide a rationale for cotargeting these pathways to achieve better efficacy through AR blockade.""","""['Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Ramakumar Tummala', 'Chengfei Liu', 'Wei Lou', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['NF-κB2/p52 induces resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer: role of androgen receptor and its variants.', 'Quercetin Targets hnRNPA1 to Overcome Enzalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Upregulation of glucose metabolism by NF-κB2/p52 mediates enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.', 'AR-V7 and prostate cancer: The watershed for treatment selection?', 'Therapeutic Targeting of RNA Splicing in Cancer.', 'Regulation of Pre-mRNA Splicing: Indispensable Role of Post-Translational Modifications of Splicing Factors.', 'Role of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins in the Cancer-Immune Landscape.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'A comprehensive understanding of hnRNP A1 role in cancer: new perspectives on binding with noncoding RNA.']"""

Methods:   From June 2012 to August 2013, ThuLEP was performed on 100 patients in our institution. We present the results of a prospective evaluation during which we analyzed data related to the learning curves for two surgeons of different levels of experience.  Results:   The prostatic adenoma volumes ranged from 30 to 130 mL (average 61.2 mL). Surgeons A and B performed 48 and 52 operations, respectively. Six months after surgery, all patients were evaluated with the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire, uroflowmetry, and prostate-specific antigen test. Introduced in 2010, ThuLEP consists of blunt enucleation of the prostatic apex and lobes using the sheath of the resectoscope. This maneuver allows clearer visualization of the enucleation plane and precise identification of the prostatic capsule. These conditions permit total resection of the prostatic adenoma and coagulation of small penetrating vessels, thereby reducing the laser emission time. Most of the complications in this series were encountered during morcellation, which in some cases was performed under poor vision because of venous bleeding due to surgical perforation of the capsule during enucleation.  Conclusions:   Based on this analysis, we concluded that it is feasible for laser-naive urologists with endoscopic experience to learn to perform ThuLEP without tutoring. Those statements still require further validation in larger multicentric study cohort by several surgeon. The main novelty during the learning process was the use of a simulator that faithfully reproduced all of the surgical steps in prostates of various shapes and volumes.""","""['Giovanni Saredi', 'Giacomo Maria Pirola', 'Andrea Pacchetti', 'Jon Alexander Lovisolo', 'Giacomo Borroni', 'Federico Sembenini', 'Alberto Mario Marconi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""[""A novel one lobe technique of thulium laser enucleation of the prostate: 'All-in-One' technique."", 'Are Histological Findings of Thulium Laser Vapo-Enucleation Versus Transurethral Resection of the Prostate Comparable?', 'Anatomical Control of Adenoma Technique: An Accurate Surgical Approach to Thulium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate.', 'Transurethral anatomical enucleation of the prostate with Tm:YAG support (ThuLEP): review of the literature on a novel surgical approach in the management of benign prostatic enlargement.', 'Laser prostate enucleation techniques.', 'Residency Surgical BPH Training Paradigms from MIST to HOLEP.', 'Current evidence of ThuLEP for BPH: A review of literature.', 'Simulation models and training curricula for training in endoscopic enucleation of the prostate: A systematic review from ESUT.', 'Educational value of YouTube Surgical Videos of Thulium Laser Enucleation of The Prostate (ThuLEP): the quality assessment.', 'The Learning Curves for Laser Application in Urology Procedures: Review of the Literature.']"""

A secondary objective was to determine whether definitive prostate cancer treatment was associated with bladder cancer survival end points.  Materials and methods:   There were 749 patients who underwent radical cystectomy between 2000 and 2013. After excluding females and patients with nonurothelial histologies 561 men were identified, of whom 69 (12.3%) received single or multimodal definitive prostate cancer treatment. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine an association between clinical and pathological features such as definitive prostate cancer treatment and positive soft tissue surgical margins. Cox regression models and competing risk regression were used to investigate the impact of definitive prostate cancer treatment and positive surgical margins on survival.  Results:   The median age of the male population was 70.0 years. There were 57 cases of positive soft tissue surgical margins in our cohort of 561 men (10.2%). Of men who underwent previous definitive prostate cancer treatment 20 of 69 (29.0%) had positive surgical margins compared to 37 of 492 (7.5%) who never received definitive prostate cancer treatment (p <0.0001). Brachytherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and radical prostatectomy significantly increased the rate of positive margins. Brachytherapy (OR 5.8), radiotherapy (OR 2.7) and hormonal therapy (OR 5.1) remained independent predictors of positive margins on multivariate analysis. Positive margins were associated with negative effects on recurrence-free (HR 3.1), cancer specific (HR 4.1) and overall survival (HR 2.8).  Conclusions:   Patients with a history of definitive prostate cancer treatment are at increased risk for positive soft tissue surgical margins. Positive margins significantly impact bladder cancer recurrence-free, cancer specific and overall survival following radical cystectomy. Careful patient counseling and surgical planning are crucial when treating patients undergoing radical cystectomy who have a history of definitive prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Adam M Luchey', 'Hui-Yi Lin', 'Binglin Yue', 'Gautum Agarwal', 'Scott M Gilbert', 'Jorge Lockhart', 'Michael A Poch', 'Julio M Pow-Sang', 'Philippe E Spiess', 'Wade J Sexton']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Positive surgical margins in soft tissue following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer and cancer specific survival.', 'Soft tissue surgical margin status is a powerful predictor of outcomes after radical cystectomy: a multicenter study of more than 4,400 patients.', 'Outcomes after urothelial recurrence in bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy.', 'Upper urinary tract recurrence following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a meta-analysis on 13,185 patients.', 'Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma in patients with bladder cancer and their implications in the clinical practice.', 'Proteomic Analysis of Exosomes for Discovery of Protein Biomarkers for Prostate and Bladder Cancer.', 'The potential risk of tumor progression after use of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane allograft in a positive margin resection model.', 'Concomitant bladder cancer and prostate cancer: challenges and controversies.', 'Second neoplasms after percutaneous radiotherapy.', 'The Prognostic Value of Previous Irradiation on Survival of Bladder Cancer Patients.']"""

One experienced genitourinary pathologist selected those with real Gs=3+3 and 3+4 in only one core according to the 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology criteria. The primary end point was the proportion of unfavourable outcome (nonorgan confined disease or Gs⩾4+3). Logistic regressions explored the association between preoperative characteristics and the primary end point.  Results:   Two hundred and four patients were evaluated and 46 (22.5%) patients harboured unfavourable disease at final pathology.

Methods:   Two hundred and ten consecutive patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either IB-GB and prior intrarectal instillation of a 2% lidocaine gel (n = 106) or FUS-GB plus additional systematic 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy and prior application of a periprostatic nerve block (PPNB) with 2% mepivacaine (n = 104). The maximal procedural pain (MPP) on a 0-10 visual analog scale and the operating room time were recorded for each biopsy session.  Results:   Baseline characteristics and mean number of targeted biopsy cores (5.6 ± 0.8 vs 5.4 ± 1.2 for IB-GB and FUS-GB, respectively; p = 0.278) were similar in both study arms. In relation to the IB-GB arm, the total number of biopsy cores in the FUS-GB arm, including the systematic 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy, was significantly higher (17.4 ± 1.2; p < 0.001). Patients with IB-GB had significantly higher MPP scores (2.95 ± 2.15) compared with subjects with FUS-GB (1.95 ± 1.56; p < 0.001).

Conclusions:   The PPNB can easily be administered just prior to performing FUS-GB. Thus, patients have significantly lower pain levels in comparison with IB-GB, which is usually done with intrarectal anesthetic gels.

Methods and materials:   VMAT treatment plans were generated with version 11 of the Eclipse treatment planning system for a Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator operating with 10-MV x-rays in flattening filter-free mode (FFFM). Plans were designed with pelvic computed tomography scans from 10 patients with prostate cancer with an assumption of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk target volumes. The prescription dose was set to 36.25 Gy to be delivered in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy each. Dose-volume constraints imposed during optimization to protect organs at risk (OARs) were based on data from published studies and current SABR clinical trials. One-arc and 2-arc plans were compared in terms of dose homogeneity and conformity to the target volumes, dose to the OAR and to the surrounding normal tissue, the total number of monitor units required, and overall treatment time.  Results:   Clinically acceptable VMAT-FFFM-based SABR regimens were produced for all low-, intermediate-, and high-risk target volumes using both 1-arc and 2-arc deliveries. No significant dosimetric differences in terms of homogeneity, conformity, or dose to the OAR were observed between 1-arc and 2-arc deliveries, but treatment times were twice as long for 2-arc deliveries and consistently required more monitor units.

Methods:   The study population consisted of 313 patients treated with RARP for clinically localized prostate cancer at a single institution between 2010 and 2011. Patients subjected to neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies and patients with a follow-up of<2 years were excluded. BCR was defined as a postoperative level of total prostate-specific antigen ≥0.2 ng/ml and elevating after RARP. The minimum P-value method was used to determine the most significant PHI cutoff value to discriminate between patients with and without BCR. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine BCR-free survival rates. Finally, Cox regression models were fitted to determine the predictors of BCR, and the predictive accuracy (area under the curve) of each predictor was determined with the Harrell concordance index.  Results:   Mean total prostate-specific antigen and mean PHI levels were 5.76 ng/ml (interquartile range: 4.2-8.7) and 46.0 (35-62), respectively. Biopsy Gleason score was 6 in 173 (55.3%), 7 in 121 (38.7%), and ≥8 in 19 (6.1%) patients. At final pathology, extracapsular extension was observed in 59 (18.8%), seminal vesicle invasion in 24 (7.7%), and lymph node invasion in 11 (3.5%) patients, whereas 228 (72.8%) patients had organ-confined disease. The 2-year BCR-free survival rate was 92.5% in the overall population and was 96.7% in patients with organ-confined disease. The most significant PHI cutoff value to discriminate between patients with and without BCR was 82. Specifically, the 2-year BCR-free survival rate was 97.7% in patients with a preoperative PHI level<82 relative to 69.7% in patients with a PHI level ≥82 (log-rank test: P<0.001). Finally, in multivariable Cox regression analyses, PHI level emerged as an independent predictor of BCR in both the preoperative and the postoperative settings and was more accurate than several established BCR predictors were.

Methods:   We retrospectively examined 18 patients with prostate cancer who received androgen-deprivation therapy and who were treated with a GnRH antagonist (degarelix) after they showed an elevated PSA while on GnRH agonist therapy. We evaluated the characteristics of the patients and analyzed some clinical factors for their potential association with the patient response to the switch.  Results:   The median PSA at the switch was 7.9 (0.37-1709) ng/ml, and the median testosterone level was 0.17 (<0.08-0.81) ng/ml.

The recent advent of PET imaging using a novel dedicated radiotracer, [Formula: see text]-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), combined with MRI provides improved pre-interventional identification of suspicious areas. This work proposes a multimodal fusion image-guided biopsy framework that combines PET-MRI images with TRUS, using automatic segmentation and registration, and offering real-time guidance.  Methods:   The prostate TRUS images are automatically segmented with a Hough transform-based random forest approach. The registration is based on the Coherent Point Drift algorithm to align surfaces elastically and to propagate the deformation field calculated from thin-plate splines to the whole gland.

A prospective multicenter randomized controlled pivotal trial was performed to assess outcomes following absorbable spacer (SpaceOAR system) implantation.  Methods and materials:   Overall, 222 patients with clinical stage T1 or T2 prostate cancer underwent computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for treatment planning, followed with fiducial marker placement, and were randomized to receive spacer injection or no injection (control). Patients received postprocedure CT and MRI planning scans and underwent image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (79.2 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions). Spacer safety and impact on rectal irradiation, toxicity, and quality of life were assessed throughout 15 months.  Results:   Spacer application was rated as ""easy"" or ""very easy"" 98.7% of the time, with a 99% hydrogel placement success rate. Perirectal spaces were 12.6 ± 3.9 mm and 1.6 ± 2.0 mm in the spacer and control groups, respectively. There were no device-related adverse events, rectal perforations, serious bleeding, or infections within either group. Pre-to postspacer plans had a significant reduction in mean rectal V70 (12.4% to 3.3%, P<.0001). Overall acute rectal adverse event rates were similar between groups, with fewer spacer patients experiencing rectal pain (P=.02). A significant reduction in late (3-15 months) rectal toxicity severity in the spacer group was observed (P=.04), with a 2.0% and 7.0% late rectal toxicity incidence in the spacer and control groups, respectively. There was no late rectal toxicity greater than grade 1 in the spacer group. At 15 months 11.6% and 21.4% of spacer and control patients, respectively, experienced 10-point declines in bowel quality of life. MRI scans at 12 months verified spacer absorption.  Conclusions:   Spacer application was well tolerated. Increased perirectal space reduced rectal irradiation, reduced rectal toxicity severity, and decreased rates of patients experiencing declines in bowel quality of life.

Here, we report the polyarginine peptide (R11)-labeled non-toxic SSPEI nanomaterials capable of prostate cancer-specific miR-145 delivery to prostate cancer in vivo where they display full bioactivity at completely nontoxic concentrations. The R11-labeled BPEI-SS (R11-SSPEI) nanocarrier showed less toxicity in prostate cancer, and electrostatic interaction of R11-SSPEI with miR-145 exhibited optimal transfection efficacy. The R11-SSPEI/miR-145 polymer could be specifically uptaken in prostate cancer using FAM-miR-145 mixed with R11-SSPEI. The functional action of miR-145 oligomers released from polyplexes was evaluated by a reporter vector containing a miR-145-binding sequence, and showed a significantly reduced reporter signal in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, in a peritoneal mouse tumor model, the systemic administration of the R11-SSPEI/FAM-miR-145 complex leads to the delivery of miR-145 into the tumors, dramatically inhibiting tumor growth and prolonged survival time. Hence, we establish a novel and prostate cancer-specific targeting system for the systemic in vivo application of microRNAs through R11-SSPEI complexation as a powerful tool for future therapeutic use.""","""['Tingting Zhang', 'Xiang Xue', 'Dalin He', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['A brain-targeted rabies virus glycoprotein-disulfide linked PEI nanocarrier for delivery of neurogenic microRNA.', 'Prostate cancer-specific thermo-responsive polymer-coated iron oxide nanoparticles.', 'Designing a gold nanoparticle-based nanocarrier for microRNA transfection into the prostate and breast cancer cells.', 'Nanocarriers for microRNA delivery in cancer medicine.', 'Nanoparticle-based targeted cancer strategies for non-invasive prostate cancer intervention.', 'Dual Targeted Nanoparticles for the Codelivery of Doxorubicin and siRNA Cocktails to Overcome Ovarian Cancer Stem Cells.', 'MicroRNAs in T Cell-Immunotherapy.', 'MicroRNAs as clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Recent applications of cell-penetrating peptide guidance of nanosystems in breast and prostate cancer.', 'Signaling Pathway Inhibitors, miRNA, and Nanocarrier-Based Pharmacotherapeutics for the Treatment of Lung Cancer: A Review.']"""

Materials and methods:   We evaluated the participants in two consecutive prospective studies of the QL of patients treated with LDR-BT for LPC. QL was evaluated by means of a patient-completed questionnaire assessing non functional [physical (PHY) and psychological (PSY) well-being, physical autonomy (POW), social relationships (REL)] and functional scales [urinary (URI), rectal (REC), and sexual (SEX) function]; a scale for erectile function (ERE) was included in the second study.

As expected, a progressive impairment in sexual and erectile function was reported one month after LDR-BT, and became statistically significant after the third year. Rectal function significantly worsened after LDR-BT, but the differences progressively decreased after the 1-year assessment. Overall urinary function significantly worsened immediately after LDR-BT and then gradually improved over the next three years.

However, the role of its substrate, p70S6 kinase1 (S6K1), in autophagy is quite controversial. In some models S6K1 activity correlates with autophagy suppression, however, some other studies show that S6K1 promotes rather than inhibits this process. Here, we investigated the role of S6K1 in prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-cancerous, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), either treated with autophagy inducer sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous plants, or deprived of serum. Our results indicate that constitutively active S6K1 decreases the level of LC3 processing and foci formation by autophagosomal vacuoles in cells treated with sulforaphane. On the other hand, presence of S6K1 is necessary for autophagosome maturation under conditions of autophagy induced by either sulforaphane or serum deprivation. Diminished level of S6K1 or lack of S6 kinases results in both, accumulation of autophagosomes and drop in the autophagolysosome number, and thus disturbs autophagy flux under stress conditions.

The aim of this study was to compare the detection rate of (18)F-FACBC and (11)C-choline in patients presenting a biochemical relapse.

Results:   On a patient-based analysis, (18)F-fluciclovine detection turned out to be significantly superior to (11)C-choline (P < 0.000001). This result was also true on lesion, lymph node, bone lesion, and local relapse analysis (P < 0.0001 in all the cases).

Inverse associations between dietary and supplemental α-tocopherol and CaP aggressiveness were observed among AAs, though these did not reach statistical significance [OR (95%CI), highest versus lowest quartile: dietary α-tocopherol, 0.58 (0.28-1.19), P(trend) = 0.20; supplemental α-tocopherol, 0.64 (0.31-1.21) P(trend) = 0.15]. No significant association was observed between adipose tocopherol levels and CaP aggressiveness [OR (95%CI), highest versus lowest quartiles of α-tocopherol for EAs 1.43 (0.66-3.11) and AAs 0.66 (0.27-1.62)].

Therefore, the primary endpoint of this study was to investigate Cbz tolerability in mCRPC patients treated previously with D and AA. From April 2011 to the present, 43 mCRPC patients received AA after D at our institution. Of these, 22 patients were subsequently treated with Cbz and were evaluable for toxicity in the present retrospective study. Cbz was administered at a dose of 25 mg/m plus 10 mg oral prednisone every 3 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were reported using the NCI CTCAE (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 3.0.

However, many studies have yielded conflicting and controversial results. In this study, we systematically investigated the transcriptomes of human prostate samples for the unique genomic signatures of these pathogens using RNA-seq data from both western and Chinese patients. Human and nonhuman RNA-seq reads were mapped onto human and pathogen reference genomes respectively using alignment tools Bowtie and BLAT. Pathogen infections and integrations were analyzed in adherence with the standards from published studies. Among the nine pathogens (Propionibacterium acnes, HPV, HCMV, XMRV, BKV, JCV, SV40, EBV, and HBV) we analyzed, Propionibacterium acnes genes were detected in all prostate tumor samples and all adjacent samples, but not in prostate samples from healthy individuals. SV40, HCMV, EBV and low-risk HPVs transcripts were detected in one tumor sample and two adjacent samples from Chinese prostate cancer patients, but not in any samples of western prostate cancer patients; XMRV, BKV and JCV sequences were not identified in our work; HBV, as a negative control, was absent from any samples. Moreover, no pathogen integration was identified in our study. While further validation is required, our analysis provides evidence of Propionibacterium acnes infections in human prostate tumors.

The recent discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel effector molecules of AR disclosed the existence of an intricate network between AR, miRNAs and downstream target genes. In this study DUCaP cells, characterized by high content of wild-type AR and robust AR transcriptional activity, were chosen as the main experimental model. By integrative analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and microarray expression profiling data, miRNAs putatively bound and significantly regulated by AR were identified. A direct AR regulation of miR-22, miR-29a, and miR-17-92 cluster along with their host genes was confirmed. Interestingly, endogenous levels of miR-22 and miR-29a were found to be reduced in PCa cells expressing AR. In primary tumor samples, miR-22 and miR-29a were less abundant in the cancerous tissue compared with the benign counterpart. This specific expression pattern was associated with a differential DNA methylation of the genomic AR binding sites. The identification of laminin gamma 1 (LAMC1) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) as direct targets of miR-22 and miR-29a, respectively, suggested a tumor-suppressive role of these miRNAs.

Methods and materials:   Trial 44/20 randomized patients to 44 Gy plus 90 Gy (103)Pd vs. 20 Gy with 115 Gy (103)Pd, and the subsequent trial randomized patients to the 20 Gy arm vs. 125 Gy (103)Pd without EBRT (20/0 trial). Eligibility criteria included clinically organ-confined disease with Gleason scores 7-9 and/or a pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 10-20 ng/mL. The brachytherapy prescription dose was prescribed to the prostate gland with generous periprostatic margins. Biochemical failure (BF) was defined as a PSA >0.40 ng/mL after nadir. Median Day 0 minimum dose covering 90% of the prostate volume (D90) was >121.0% of the prescription dose. Multiple parameters were evaluated for effect on outcomes.  Results:   In 44/20 trial, 13-year BF, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and overall mortality (OM) were 8.2%, 4.0%, and 42.8% vs. 8.0%, 1.0%. and 40.3% for the 44 and 20 Gy arms. In 20/0 trial, 8-year BF, PCSM, and OM were 2.1%, 0%, and 14.4% vs. 3.6%, 0%, and 16.1% in the 20 vs. 0 Gy arms. When stratified by either pretreatment PSA or by Gleason score, supplemental EBRT dose did not impact BF, PCSM, or OM. In multivariate analysis, BF was most closely related to percent positive biopsies and prostate volume. In both trials, patients with biochemically controlled disease had a median PSA of <0.02 ng/mL.

We prospectively assessed categorical and continuous CTC-counts for their utility in early prediction of radiographic response, progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in mCRPC patients treated with docetaxel.  Methods:   CTC-counts were assessed in 122 serial samples, as continuous or categorical (<5 vs. ≥5 CTCs) variables, at baseline (q0) and after 1 (q1), 4 (q4) and 10 (q10) cycles of docetaxel (3-weekly, 75 mg/m2) in 33 mCRPC patients. Treatment response (TR) was defined as non-progressive (non-PD) and progressive disease (PD), by morphologic RECIST or clinical criteria at q4 and q10. Binary logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used as statistical methods.  Results:   Categorical CTC-count status predicted PD at q4 already after one cycle (q1) and after 4 cycles (q4) of chemotherapy with an odds ratio (OR) of 14.9 (p=0.02) and 18.0 (p=0.01). Continuous CTC-values predicted PD only at q4 (OR 1.04, p=0.048). Regarding PFS, categorical CTC-counts at q1 were independent prognostic markers with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.85 (95% CI 1.1-13.8, p=0.04) whereas early continuous CTC-values at q1 failed significance (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99-1.05, p=0.14).

Conclusions:   Categorical CTC-count status is an early independent predictor for TR, PFS and OS only 3 weeks following treatment initiation with docetaxel whereas continuous CTC-counts were an inconsistent surrogate marker in mCRPC patients.

Overexpression of wild-type Shp2 or an oncogenic Shp2 mutant leads to increased prostate cancer cell proliferation, colony and sphere formation, and in vivo tumor formation. Opposite effects are seen in Shp2-knockdown cells. Moreover, Shp2 promotes in vitro migration and in vivo metastasis of prostatic tumor cells. Mechanistically, Shp2 interacts with PAR3 (partitioning-defective 3) via its Src homology-2 domain. Ectopic expression of Shp2 attenuates the phosphorylation of PAR3 and the formation of the PAR3/PAR6/atypical protein kinase C polarity protein complex, resulting in disrupted cell polarity, dysregulated cell-cell junctions and increased EMT. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which oncogenic signal-transduction molecules regulate cell polarity and induction of EMT.""","""['K Zhang', 'H Zhao', 'Z Ji', 'C Zhang', 'P Zhou', 'L Wang', 'Q Chen', 'J Wang', 'P Zhang', 'Z Chen', 'H H Zhu', 'W-Q Gao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Elevated expression of Par3 promotes prostate cancer metastasis by forming a Par3/aPKC/KIBRA complex and inactivating the hippo pathway.', 'Tyrosine phosphorylated Par3 regulates epithelial tight junction assembly promoted by EGFR signaling.', 'PAR3-PAR6-atypical PKC polarity complex proteins in neuronal polarization.', 'Apical-basal polarity inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumour metastasis by PAR-complex-mediated SNAI1 degradation.', 'The Par3/Par6/aPKC complex and epithelial cell polarity.', 'Role of SHP2/PTPN11 in the occurrence and prognosis of cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A comprehensive review of SHP2 and its role in cancer.', 'Critical roles of PTPN family members regulated by non-coding RNAs in tumorigenesis and immunotherapy.', 'Targeting SHP2 phosphatase in hematological malignancies.', 'Partitioning defective 6 homolog alpha (PARD6A) promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition via integrin β1-ILK-SNAIL1 pathway in ovarian cancer.']"""

Gabarapl1 is transcriptionally regulated by androgen receptor (AR) and has a repressive role in autophagy. Androgen deprivation downregulates Gabarapl1 in an AR dependent manner, resulting in the increase of autophagy flux. Elevated Gabarapl1 also represses the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.

Objective:   To elucidate the association between pretreatment smoking status, cumulative smoking exposure, and time since smoking cessation and the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa in patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective analysis of 6538 patients with pathologically node-negative PCa treated with RP between 2000 and 2011. Clinicopathologic and smoking variables, including smoking status, number of cigarettes per day (CPD), duration in years, and time since smoking cessation were collected.  Intervention:   RP without neoadjuvant therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses assessed the association between smoking and risk of PCa BCR.  Results and limitations:   Of 6538 patients, 2238 (34%), 2086 (32%), and 2214 (34%) were never, former, and current smokers, respectively. Median follow-up for patients not experiencing BCR was 28 mo (interquartile range 14-42). RP Gleason score (p=0.3), extracapsular extension (p=0.2), seminal vesicle invasion (p=0.8), and positive surgical margins (p=0.9) were comparable among the three groups. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, former smokers (hazard ratio [HR] 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-2.04; p<0.001) and current smokers (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.45-2.24; p<0.001) had a higher risk of PCa BCR compared with non-smokers. Smoking cessation for ≥10 yr mitigated the risk of BCR in multivariable analyses (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.68-1.37; p=0.84). In multivariable analysis, no significant association between cumulative smoking exposure and risk of BCR could be detected. Limitations of the study include the retrospective design and potential recall bias regarding smoking history.  Conclusion:   Smoking seems to be associated with a higher risk of PCa BCR after RP. The effects of smoking appear to be mitigated by ≥10 yr of cessation. Smokers should be counseled regarding the detrimental effects of smoking on PCa prognosis.  Patient summary:   We investigated the effect of smoking on the risk of prostate cancer recurrence in patients with treated with surgery. We found that former smokers and current smokers were at higher risk of cancer recurrence compared to patients who never smoked; the detrimental effect of smoking was mitigated after 10 yr or more of smoking cessation. We conclude that smokers should be counseled regarding the detrimental effects on prostate cancer outcomes.""","""['Malte Rieken', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Luis A Kluth', 'Harun Fajkovic', 'Michael Rink', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Christian Seitz', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Morgan Rouprêt', 'Wolfgang Loidl', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Alexander Bachmann', 'Gholamreza Pourmand']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate Cancer Progression: The Smoking Gun?', ""Reply to Michael Froehner, Rainer Koch, Manfred P.

We propose a verification of the usefulness of MRI and an identification of which structures are involved in UI after RP.  Methods:   Between September 2002 and December 2011, 550 patients underwent RP. We performed MRI to evaluate extraprostatic disease before surgery. To evaluate patient status, we measured the following structures: length (LP), width (WP), height (HP) and volume (PV) of the prostate, membranous urethral length (MUL), urethral wall thickness (UWT), levator ani muscle (LAM) and obturator internus muscle (OIM) thickness, ratio of levator ani muscle/prostate volume (LAM/PV), volume of the urethra (VU). UI was defined according to ICS definition as the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine and evaluated 1 year after surgery. Analyses were performed by mean comparisons, univariate and multivariate logistic regression with a 1000-resample bootstrapping.  Results:   Means of measurements were: LP 4.46 cm, WP 5.15 cm, HP 3.9 cm, PV 49.3 cc; LAM 0.51 cm, OIM 1.46 cm; MUL 1.43 cm, UWT 1.38 cm; and LAM/PV 0.013 cm/cc, VU 2.33 cc. One hundred and twenty-two (22.2 %) patients complained of urine leakage. Univariate obtained differences in PV, OIM, MUL, and UWT. After adjusting by confounders, multivariate analysis showed: MUL: [OR 0.134; CI 95 % (0.022-0.493); P 0.006]; PV: [OR 1.016; CI 95 % (1.004-1.029); P 0.005]; UWT: [OR 6.03; CI 95 % (1.068-44.1); P 0.033].  Conclusions:   MRI is a useful tool to predict UI after RP. The MUL and PV are well-identified structures that are involved in UI.

Institutions may need to increase coordination between multidisciplinary clinical teams to optimize patient care. This study examines historical trends in adjuvant and neoadjuvant radiation therapy (ANRT) before or after cancer-directed surgery to identify disease sites that may benefit from coordinated care.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried to identify patients with bladder cancer; breast cancer; cervical cancer; colorectal cancer; kidney cancer; cancer of the lung, bronchus, and pleura; lymphoma; melanoma; cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx; ovarian cancer; pancreatic cancer; prostate cancer; thyroid cancer; and uterine cancer from 1973 to 2011. Number and percentage of patients who received ANRT were calculated from 1973 to 2011.  Results:   Adjuvant and neoadjuvant radiation therapy usage increased from 14% in 1973 to 19% in 2011. Adjuvant and neoadjuvant radiation therapy use for breast, oral cavity/pharynx, and thyroid cancers increased from 24%, 16%, and 9% in 1973 to 53%, 32%, and 46% in 2011, respectively. Changes in ANRT were seen in gynecologic and genitourinary cancers, with increased use of ANRT in cervical cancer and declines in uterine, ovarian, bladder, prostate, and kidney cancers. There were minimal changes in ANRT usage for patients within other diagnosis groups.  Discussion:   Overall usage of ANRT is increasing over time, with increased need for coordinated care in breast and head and neck cancers.

Methods:   Forty-two patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer underwent (223)Ra and a baseline fluoride PET/CT scan. Fluoride PET/CT parameters were generated, including maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the hottest lesion (hSUVmax), average SUV of disease (Mean10), and skeletal tumor burden indices of total fluoride skeletal metastatic lesion uptake (TLF10) and total volume of fluoride avid bone metastases (FTV10). Overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival and skeletal-related event (SRE).  Results:   Skeletal tumor burden indices (TLF10 and FTV10) derived from fluoride PET/CT at baseline were highly correlated and significant independent predictors of OS (P = 0.0212; hazard ratio = 5.990; 95% confidence interval = 1.306-27.475). A TLF10 cutoff value of 8,000 discriminated survivors from nonsurvivors after (223)Ra (with TLF10 values < 8,000, the median OS was not estimated, whereas with TLF10 > 8,000, the median OS was 6.67 mo). Visual analysis, Mean10, and hSUVmax were not predictors of OS or progression-free survival. Mean10 was found to be a significant univariate predictor of the odds of having an SRE (P = 0.0445; odds ratio = 1.30; 95% confidence interval = 1.006-1.681), with a Mean10 greater than 19 increasing the risk of SRE.

PSMA has been shown to be associated with higher Gleason grade and more aggressive disease. An imaging biomarker able to detect clinically significant high-grade primary prostate cancer reliably would address an unmet clinical need by allowing for risk-adapted patient management.  Methods:   We enrolled 13 patients with primary prostate cancer who were imaged with (18)F-DCFBC PET before scheduled prostatectomy, with 12 of these patients also undergoing pelvic prostate MR imaging. Prostate (18)F-DCFBC PET was correlated with MR imaging and histologic and immunohistochemical analysis on a prostate-segment (12 regions) and dominant-lesion basis. There were no incidental extraprostatic findings on PET suggestive of metastatic disease.  Results:   MR imaging was more sensitive than (18)F-DCFBC PET for detection of primary prostate cancer on a per-segment (sensitivities of up to 0.17 and 0.39 for PET and MR imaging, respectively) and per-dominant-lesion analysis (sensitivities of 0.46 and 0.92 for PET and MR imaging, respectively). However, (18)F-DCFBC PET was more specific than MR imaging by per-segment analysis (specificities of 0.96 and 0.89 for PET and MR imaging for corresponding sensitivity, respectively) and specific for detection of high-grade lesions (Gleason 8 and 9) greater than 1.0 mL in size (4/4 of these patients positive by PET). (18)F-DCFBC uptake in tumors was positively correlated with Gleason score (ρ = 0.64; PSMA expression, ρ = 0.47; and prostate-specific antigen, ρ = 0.52). There was significantly lower (18)F-DCFBC uptake in benign prostatic hypertrophy than primary tumors (median maximum standardized uptake value, 2.2 vs. 3.5; P = 0.004).  Conclusion:   Although the sensitivity of (18)F-DCFBC for primary prostate cancer was less than MR imaging, (18)F-DCFBC PET was able to detect the more clinically significant high-grade and larger-volume tumors (Gleason score 8 and 9) with higher specificity than MR imaging. In particular, there was relatively low (18)F-DCFBC PET uptake in benign prostatic hypertrophy lesions, compared with cancer in the prostate, which may allow for more specific detection of primary prostate cancer by (18)F-DCFBC PET.

MSKE has been shown previously to promote apoptosis in prostate cancer cells without affecting normal prostate epithelial cells. Snail is overexpressed in prostate and breast cancer, and is associated with increased invasion, migration and bone turnover/osteoclastogenesis. Cathepsin L (CatL) is a cysteine cathepsin protease that is overexpressed in cancer and involved in bone turnover. Snail overexpression in prostate (LNCaP, ARCaP-E) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells led to increased CatL expression/activity and phosphorylated STAT-3 (pSTAT-3), compared to Neo vector controls, while the reverse was observed in C4-2 (the aggressive subline of LNCaP) cells with Snail knockdown. Moreover, CatL expression was higher in prostate and breast tumor tissue compared to normal tissue. MSKE decreased Snail and pSTAT3 expression, and abrogated Snail-mediated CatL activity, migration and invasion. Additionally, Snail overexpression promoted osteoclastogenesis, which was significantly inhibited by the MSKE as effectively as Z-FY-CHO, a CatL-specific inhibitor, or osteoprotegerin, a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) antagonist. Overall, these novel findings suggest that Snail regulation of CatL may occur via STAT-3 signaling and can be antagonized by MSKE, leading to decreased cell invasion, migration and bone turnover. Therefore, inhibition using a natural product such as MSKE could potentially be a promising bioactive compound for bone metastatic cancer.""","""['Liza J Burton', 'Basil A Smith', 'Bethany N Smith', 'Quentin Loyd', 'Peri Nagappan', 'Danielle McKeithen', 'Catera L Wilder', 'Manu O Platt', 'Tamaro Hudson', 'Valerie A Odero-Marah']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['CCAAT-displacement protein/cut homeobox transcription factor (CUX1) represses estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) in triple-negative breast cancer cells and can be antagonized by muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE).', 'Muscadine grape skin extract reverts snail-mediated epithelial mesenchymal transition via superoxide species in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting the Nuclear Cathepsin L CCAAT Displacement Protein/Cut Homeobox Transcription Factor-Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition Pathway in Prostate and Breast Cancer Cells with the Z-FY-CHO Inhibitor.', 'The role of RANK/RANKL/osteoprotegerin (OPG) triad in cancer-induced bone diseases: physiopathology and clinical implications.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'Novel roles for HMGA2 isoforms in regulating oxidative stress and sensitizing to RSL3-Induced ferroptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Study design and methods for the pilot study of muscadine grape extract supplement to improve fatigue among older adult cancer survivors (FOCUS) trial.', 'Anthocyanins in Red Jasmine Rice (Oryza sativa L.)

However, with the nearly invariable progression of this disease to androgen independence, endocrine therapy ultimately fails to control prostate cancer in most patients. Androgen-independent acquisition may involve neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, but there is little knowledge about this process, which is presently controversial. In this study, we investigated this question in a novel model of human androgen-dependent LNCaP cells cultured for long periods in hormone-deprived conditions. Strikingly, characterization of the neuroendocrine phenotype by transcriptomic, metabolomic, and other statistically integrated analyses showed how hormone-deprived LNCaP cells could transdifferentiate to a nonmalignantneuroendocrine phenotype.

Subsequently, 21 prostate and 21 bladder cancer patients were scanned using the dual channel mTX upgrade. The precontrast signal ( S0) and the maximum enhancement ratio (MER) were measured in both the left and the right femoral arteries.

Methods:   A prostate cancer cohort was initiated from the Swedish Cancer Registry of patients diagnosed between 1961 and 2008. Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1961 and 1980 were generally treated with estrogen. The cohort diagnosed between 1981 and 2008 was further divided into 3 subcohorts of orchiectomy, prostatectomy, and other treatment. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for developing colorectal adenocarcinoma were estimated and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare relative risk among these patients and the general male population.  Results:   Of 601,542 person-years of follow-up, 1,698 cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma were identified. Compared with the general male population, no association was detected in the cohort diagnosed between 1961 and 1980, whereas an increased risk of colorectal adenocarcinoma was observed among patients diagnosed with prostate cancer who received treatments other than estrogen. Following bilateral orchiectomy, the SIR was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.14-1.47); after prostatectomy, the SIR was 1.22 (95% CI: 1.04-1.43); among those who received treatment other than estrogen, the SIR was 1.37 (95% CI: 1.29-1.45). The increased risks were more apparent in cases of adenocarcinoma of the distal colon and rectum than in the proximal colon.

Although these SNPs have been clearly associated with disease risk, their relationship with clinical outcomes is less clear. Our aim was to assess the frequency of known PCa susceptibility alleles within a single institution ascertainment and to correlate risk alleles with disease-specific outcomes.  Methods:   We genotyped 1354 individuals treated for localised PCa between June 1988 and December 2007. Blood samples were prospectively collected and de-identified before being genotyped and matched to phenotypic data. We investigated associations between 61 SNPs and disease-specific end points using multivariable analysis and also determined if SNPs were associated with PSA at diagnosis.  Results:   Seven SNPs showed associations on multivariable analysis (P<0.05), rs13385191 with both biochemical recurrence (BR) and castrate metastasis (CM), rs339331 (BR), rs1894292, rs17178655 and rs11067228 (CM), and rs11902236 and rs4857841 PCa-specific mortality.

Conclusions:   We confirmed that rs17632542 in KLK3 is associated with PSA at diagnosis.

It can be very difficult to study the cellular origins of pediatric solid tumors in developing organs characterized by rapid proliferative expansion, growth factor signaling, developmental angiogenesis, programmed cell death, tissue reorganization and cell migration. Not only has the etiology of pediatric cancer remained elusive because of their developmental origins, but it also makes it more difficult to treat. Molecular targeted therapeutics that alter developmental pathway signaling may have devastating effects on normal organ development. Therefore, basic research focused on the mechanisms of development provides an essential foundation for pediatric solid tumor translational research.

The upregulated iNOS/NO was shown to play a key role in cell resistance to apoptotic photokilling and also in the dramatic growth spurt observed in surviving cells. In the present study, we found that PC3 cells surviving an ALA/light insult not only proliferated faster than non-stressed controls, but migrated and invaded faster as well, these effects being abrogated by an iNOS inhibitor or NO scavenger. Photostressed prostate DU145 cells exhibited similar behavior. Using in-gel zymography, we showed that PC3 extracellular matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was strongly activated 24 h after ALA/light treatment and that MMP-9 inhibitor TIMP-1 was downregulated, consistent with MMP-9 involvement in enhanced invasiveness. We also observed a photostress-induced upregulation of α6 and β1 integrins, implying their involvement as well. The MMP-9, TIMP-1, and integrin effects were strongly attenuated by iNOS inhibition, confirming NO's role in photostress-enhanced migration/invasion.

We first demonstrated that miR-101 treatment promoted apoptosis in DU145 and PC3 cells by using flow cytometric analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To verify the mechanisms, we identified a novel miR-101 target, Ral binding protein 1 (RLIP76). We found miR-101 transfection significantly suppresses RLIP76 expression, which can transactivate phosphorylation of PI3K-Akt signaling, and resulted in an amplification of Bcl2-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RLIP76 overexpression could reverse the anti-tumor effects of miR-101 in DU145 and PC3 cells by using flow cytometry assay and MTT assay. Taken together, our results revealed that the effect of miR-101 on prostate cancer cell apoptosis was due to RLIP76 regulation of the PI3K/Akt/Bcl-2 signaling pathway.""","""['Jing Yang', 'Qi Song', 'Yi Cai', 'Peng Wang', 'Min Wang', 'Dong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['RLIP76 Depletion Enhances Autophagic Flux in U251 Cells.', 'MicroRNA-7 inhibits the stemness of prostate cancer stem-like cells and tumorigenesis by repressing KLF4/PI3K/Akt/p21 pathway.', 'Effects of overexpression of miR-17-92 gene cluster on the biological characteristics of prostate cancer cells and its mechanism.', 'Transport functions and physiological significance of 76 kDa Ral-binding GTPase activating protein (RLIP76).', 'RLIP76: A novel glutathione-conjugate and multi-drug transporter.', 'Regulation of the Cell Cycle by ncRNAs Affects the Efficiency of CDK4/6 Inhibition.', 'Exosomal miRNAs-a diagnostic biomarker acting as a guiding light in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'MiR-499a-5p promotes 5-FU resistance and the cell proliferation and migration through activating PI3K/Akt signaling by targeting PTEN in pancreatic cancer.', 'Anticancer Activity of Ω-6 Fatty Acids through Increased 4-HNE in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the role of MP-MRI in detection and prediction of PCa.  Methods:   Patients with clinical suspicion of PCa who underwent prebiopsy MP-MRI from 2002 to 2009 were recruited. MP-MRI results were retrospectively assigned as overall scores using PI-RADS by two radiologists. Patients were followed and the end point was the diagnosis of PCa. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was performed to test diagnostic efficacy of MP-MRI, under results of biopsy within three months. The cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent variables for the detection of PCa.  Results:   Finally, 1113 of the 1806 enrolled patients were included for analysis. The median follow-up was 56.0 months (1-137 mo). For 582 patients biopsied within three months, area under the curve for the detection of PCa with MP-MRI was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-1.00) in group of baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) 0.01-4.00 ng/ml (n = 31), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.95) in PSA 4.01-10.00 ng/ml (n = 142), and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94) in PSA >10.00 ng/ml (n = 409), respectively. In the cox model adjusted for age and baseline PSA level, for the detection rate of PCa, compared with PI-RADS 1-2 (reference), the hazard ratio was 6.43 (95% CI, 4.29-9.65) for PI-RADS 3, 18.58 (95% CI, 13.36-25.84) for PI-RADS 4-5 (p < 0.001).

Expression profiles can be markers of an oxidative or glycolytic phenotype. Descriptive studies and functional studies in neoplastic cells and fibroblasts in prostate cancer (PC) have suggested a distinct phenotype. We aimed to explore expression of MCT1 and MCT4 in PC cells and surrounding stroma in a large cohort. Additionally, we wanted to find out if distinct expression profiles were associated with biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS).  Methods:   Tissue microarrays were constructed from 535 patients with radical prostatectomies between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2005. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect expression, and degrees of expression were evaluated semiquantitatively by 2 pathologists using light microscopy.  Results:   For MCT1, there was only epithelial expression, whereas there was a low level of expression of MCT4 in tumor and stroma. A total of 172 patients had a low expression of MCT1 in tumor and MCT4 in stroma. There were 232 patients who had a high expression of MCT1 and a low expression of MCT4 in stroma. Only 11 patients had a low tumoral MCT1 expression and a high stromal MCT4 expression, and 26 patients (5%) had a high expression of both. Patients with a high-high combination had a significantly reduced BFFS (P = 0.011), and when adjusting for other factors, its effect was significant and independent (HR = 1.99, CI 95%: 1.09-3.62; P = 0.024).  Conclusions:   This study adds to the current understanding of the reversed Warburg effect to be a significant phenotype in PC.

We examined whether exposure to testosterone during a 5-year period was associated with an increased risk of high grade prostate cancer and whether this risk increased in a dose-response fashion with the cumulative number of testosterone injections.  Materials and methods:   Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare linked data we identified 52,579 men diagnosed with incident prostate cancer between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2006 who had a minimum of 5 years continuous enrollment in Medicare before the cancer diagnosis. We excluded patients diagnosed at death or after autopsy, those enrolled in a health maintenance organization in the 60 months before diagnosis and those with unknown tumor grade or tumor stage. In the 5 years before diagnosis 574 men had a history of testosterone use and 51,945 did not.  Results:   On logistic regression adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics exposure to testosterone therapy was not associated with an increased risk of high grade prostate cancer (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67-1.05) or receipt of primary androgen deprivation therapy following diagnosis (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74-1.30).

Cancers with high p160 SRC expression exhibit poor clinical outcomes and resistance to therapy, highlighting the SRCs as critical oncogenic drivers and, thus, therapeutic targets. microRNAs are important epigenetic regulators of protein expression. To examine the regulation of p160 SRCs by microRNAs, we used and combined 4 prediction algorithms to identify microRNAs that could target SRC1, SRC2, and SRC3 expression. For validation of these predictions, we assessed p160 SRC protein expression and cell viability after transfection of corresponding microRNA mimetics in breast cancer, uveal melanoma, and prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. Transfection of selected microRNA mimetics into breast cancer, uveal melanoma, and PC cells depleted SRC protein expression levels and exerted potent antiproliferative activity in these cell types. In particular, microRNA-137 (miR-137) depleted expression of SRC1, SRC2, and very potently, SRC3. The latter effect can be attributed to the presence of 3 miR-137 recognition sequences within the SRC3 3'-untranslated region. Using reverse phase protein array analysis, we identified a network of proteins, in addition to SRC3, that were modulated by miR-137 in PC cells. We also found that miR-137 and its host gene are epigenetically silenced in human cancer specimens and cell lines.

Patients and methods:   International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes were used to identify patients with prostate cancer who underwent RARP or ORP from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2009 to 2011. Hospital costs were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and multivariable linear regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics.  Results:   From the NIS database, 24,636 RARP and 13,590 ORP procedures were identified and evaluated. The lowest cost overall was in the South; the highest cost RARP was in the West and for ORP in the Northeast. In multivariable analysis, adjusted according to patient and hospital characteristics, RARP was 43.3% more costly in the Midwest, 37.2% more costly in the South, and 39.1% more costly in the West (P < .0001 for all). In contrast, the cost for RARP in the Northeast was 12.8% less than for ORP (P < .0001).

In addition, when we linked the DUSP5 protein levels to the clinicopathological features of the patients, we found that the downregulation of DUSP5 was significantly associated with advanced pathological stage (P = 0.004) and high Gleason score (P = 0.009). Moreover, we attempted to validate these findings and investigate the prognostic value of DUSP5 in a publicly available microarray-based Taylor Dataset. Statistic analysis demonstrated that the downregulation of DUSP5 was closely correlated with high Gleason score (P = 0.011), positive metastasis (P < 0.001) and biochemical recurrence (BCR) (P = 0.016). More importantly, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that significant differences between patients with high and low DUSP5 expression level in regard to the BCR-free survival of overall (P = 0.009), non-metastatic (P = 0.006) and patients with Gleason score 7 (P = 0.044). Multivariate analysis by Cox regression indicated that DUSP5 could be an independent predictor for the risk of BCR (HR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.2-0.82; P = 0.012). In summary, our findings disclose that DUSP5 may be an important tumor suppressor that inhibits the progression of PCa. The downregulation of DUSP5 may accurately predict poor prognosis in PCa patients.""","""['Chao Cai', 'Jin-Yan Chen', 'Zhao-Dong Han', 'Hui-Chan He', 'Jia-Hong Chen', 'Yan-Ru Chen', 'Sheng-Bang Yang', 'Yong-Ding Wu', 'Yan-Ru Zeng', 'Jun Zou', 'Yu-Xiang Liang', 'Qi-Shan Dai', 'Fu-Neng Jiang', 'Wei-De Zhong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Med""","""['Decreased expression of serine protease inhibitor family G1 (SERPING1) in prostate cancer can help distinguish high-risk prostate cancer and predicts malignant progression.', 'Dual specificity phosphatase 5 is a novel prognostic indicator for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.', 'Enhanced expression of centromere protein F predicts clinical progression and prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'ARRDC3 Inhibits the Progression of Human Prostate Cancer Through ARRDC3-ITGβ4 Pathway.', 'The prognostic value of long noncoding RNAs in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'TFEB inhibition induces melanoma shut-down by blocking the cell cycle and rewiring metabolism.', 'Dual targeting of aberrant DNA and histone methylation synergistically suppresses tumor cell growth in ATL.', 'Suppression of mutant Kirsten-RAS (KRASG12D)-driven pancreatic carcinogenesis by dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases 5 and 6.', 'The Biology of Classic Hairy Cell Leukemia.', 'PPP6C negatively regulates oncogenic ERK signaling through dephosphorylation of MEK.']"""

Recently, lots of cyclotides possessing anti-cancer activities were found in Hedyotis family plants, suggesting that H.diffusa may also contain these bioactive ingredients. Cyclotides are heat-stable macrocyclic peptides from plants that display a wide range of biological activities. Currently, over 250 cyclotides have been discovered.  Objective:   This study tried to isolate novel cyclotides from H.diffusa and further investigate their anti-cancer activities for the prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   The novel cyclotides from H.diffusa were isolated and purified by High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), amino acid sequences in their primary structure were confirmed using Edman degradation and gene cloning. Colorimetric cell viability assay (CCK8 assay), wound healing assay and human prostate cancer xenograft were used to analyze their anti-prostate cancer activity in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Three novel cyclotides, termed as Diffusa cyclotide 1 to 3 (DC1-3) from the leaves and root of H.diffusa, were isolated firstly based on my knowledge. Using Edman degradation sequencing and gene cloning, we confirmed their amino acid sequence and obtained precursors of these peptides. By CCK8 assay, all present cyclotides showed potent cytotoxicity against all three prostate cancer cell lines, especially for DC3. In migration assay and wound healing assay, DC3 inhibited the cell migration and invasion Of LNCap cells. By model of prostate xenograft, DC3 could significantly inhibit development of the tumor in weight and size compared to the placebo.  Conclusion:   The novel cyclotides extracted from H.Diffusa have anti-cancer effects, and they are potential bioactive ingredients in H.diffusa.""","""['Enping Hu', 'Dongguo Wang', 'Jiayu Chen', 'Xiulin Tao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Med""","""['The anti-tumor effect and bioactive phytochemicals of Hedyotis diffusa willd on ovarian cancer cells.', 'Scutellaria barbata and Hedyotis diffusa herb pair for breast cancer treatment: Potential mechanism based on network pharmacology.', 'Clarification of the phenotypic characteristics and anti-tumor activity of Hedyotis diffusa.', 'Novel strategies for isolation and characterization of cyclotides: the discovery of bioactive macrocyclic plant polypeptides in the Violaceae.', 'The Hedyotis diffusa Willd.

In the present study, we found that restoration of miR-26a or miR-26b significantly inhibited PCa cell invasion. Gene expression data and in silico analysis showed that the gene encoding La-related protein 1 (LARP1) was a putative candidate of miR-26a and miR-26b regulation. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays revealed that LARP1 was a direct target of both miR-26a and miR-26b. Overexpression of LARP1 was observed in PCa clinical specimens and knockdown of LARP1 inhibited cancer cell migration. Therefore, LARP1 acted as an oncogene in PCa cells. Moreover, 'ribosome', 'RNA transport' and 'mTOR signaling pathway' were identified as LARP1-regulated pathways. Our present data suggested that loss of tumor-suppressive miR-26a and miR-26b enhanced cancer cell invasion in PCa through direct regulation of oncogenic LARP1.

An accurate modeling of the physical processes considering patient heterogeneity using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods is currently too time-consuming and computationally demanding to be routinely used. In this work we implemented and evaluated an accurate and fast MCS on Graphics Processing Units (GPU) for brachytherapy low dose rate (LDR) applications. A previously proposed Geant4 based MCS framework implemented on GPU (GGEMS) was extended to include a hybrid GPU navigator, allowing navigation within voxelized patient specific images and analytically modeled (125)I seeds used in LDR brachytherapy. In addition, dose scoring based on track length estimator including uncertainty calculations was incorporated. The implemented GGEMS-brachy platform was validated using a comparison with Geant4 simulations and reference datasets. Finally, a comparative dosimetry study based on the current clinical standard (TG43) and the proposed platform was performed on twelve prostate cancer patients undergoing LDR brachytherapy. Considering patient 3D CT volumes of 400 × 250 × 65 voxels and an average of 58 implanted seeds, the mean patient dosimetry study run time for a 2% dose uncertainty was 9.35 s (≈500 ms 10(-6) simulated particles) and 2.5 s when using one and four GPUs, respectively. The performance of the proposed GGEMS-brachy platform allows envisaging the use of Monte Carlo simulation based dosimetry studies in brachytherapy compatible with clinical practice. Although the proposed platform was evaluated for prostate cancer, it is equally applicable to other LDR brachytherapy clinical applications. Future extensions will allow its application in high dose rate brachytherapy applications.""","""['Yannick Lemaréchal', 'Julien Bert', 'Claire Falconnet', 'Philippe Després', 'Antoine Valeri', 'Ulrike Schick', 'Olivier Pradier', 'Marie-Paule Garcia', 'Nicolas Boussion', 'Dimitris Visvikis']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Fast GPU-based Monte Carlo simulations for LDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'DVH-Based Inverse Planning Using Monte Carlo Dosimetry for LDR Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'A generic high-dose rate (192)Ir brachytherapy source for evaluation of model-based dose calculations beyond the TG-43 formalism.', 'Quantifying the effect of seed orientation in postplanning dosimetry of low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'egs_brachy: a versatile and fast Monte Carlo code for brachytherapy.', ""Standardization and Validation of Brachytherapy Seeds' Modelling Using GATE and GGEMS Monte Carlo Toolkits."", 'A machine-learning approach based on 409 treatments to predict optimal number of iodine-125 seeds in low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.']"""

It also aimed to validate a low dose rate brachytherapy source in terms of TG-43 metrics and to use this source to compute dose distributions for permanent prostate implant in very short times. The physics of bGPUMCD was reviewed and extended to include Rayleigh scattering and fluorescence from photoelectric interactions for all materials involved. The radial and anisotropy functions were obtained for the Nucletron SelectSeed in TG-43 conditions. These functions were compared to those found in the MD Anderson Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core brachytherapy source registry which are considered the TG-43 reference values. After appropriate calibration of the source, permanent prostate implant dose distributions were calculated for four patients and compared to an already validated Geant4 algorithm. The radial function calculated from bGPUMCD showed excellent agreement (differences within 1.3%) with TG-43 accepted values. The anisotropy functions at r = 1 cm and r = 4 cm were within 2% of TG-43 values for angles over 17.5°. For permanent prostate implants, Monte Carlo-based dose distributions with a statistical uncertainty of 1% or less for the target volume were obtained in 30 s or less for 1 × 1 × 1 mm(3) calculation grids. Dosimetric indices were very similar (within 2.7%) to those obtained with a validated, independent Monte Carlo code (Geant4) performing the calculations for the same cases in a much longer time (tens of minutes to more than a hour). bGPUMCD is a promising code that lets envision the use of Monte Carlo techniques in a clinical environment, with sub-minute execution times on a standard workstation.

AR-V regulates expression of both canonical AR targets and a unique set of cancer-specific targets that are enriched for cell-cycle functions. However, little is known about how AR-V controls gene expression. Here, we report that two major AR-Vs, termed AR-V7 and AR(v567es), not only homodimerize and heterodimerize with each other but also heterodimerize with full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL) in an androgen-independent manner. We found that heterodimerization of AR-V and AR-FL was mediated by N- and C-terminal interactions and by the DNA-binding domain of each molecule, whereas AR-V homodimerization was mediated only by DNA-binding domain interactions. Notably, AR-V dimerization was required to transactivate target genes and to confer castration-resistant cell growth. Our results clarify the mechanism by which AR-Vs mediate gene regulation and provide a pivotal pathway for rational drug design to disrupt AR-V signaling as a rational strategy for the effective treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Duo Xu', 'Yang Zhan', 'Yanfeng Qi', 'Bo Cao', 'Shanshan Bai', 'Wei Xu', 'Sanjiv S Gambhir', 'Peng Lee', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Erik K Flemington', 'Haitao Zhang', 'Chang-Deng Hu', 'Yan Dong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: AR splice variant dimerization-clinical implications.', 'Interplay between Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Mediates Castration Resistance.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants activating the full-length receptor in mediating resistance to androgen-directed therapy.', 'Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Visualization of the protein-protein interactions of hormone receptors in hormone-dependent cancer research.', 'Palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC7 inhibits androgen receptor and suppresses prostate cancer.', 'Cell-by-cell quantification of the androgen receptor in benign and malignant prostate leads to a better understanding of changes linked to cancer initiation and progression.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

In 2014, there were an estimated 233,000 new cases and 29,480 mortalities in the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy, also called androgen suppression therapy, targets androgen signaling and remains the standard treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer; however, responses to treatment are not durable and most patients advance to castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies to treat prostate cancer are urgently required. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a chaperone protein that has been shown to regulate the progression of tumor cells. Numerous Hsp90 inhibitors show anti-tumor activity and several of them have entered clinical trials. Geldanamycin (GA) was identified as the first Hsp90 inhibitor, but shows hepatotoxicity at its effective concentrations, limiting its clinical use. In previous studies by our group, the GA derivative 17-ABAG was designed and synthesized. The present study showed that 17-ABAG inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of LNCaP, an androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line, in vitro through a classic apoptotic pathway. 17-ABAG also downregulated the Hsp90 client protein and inhibited androgen receptor nuclear localization in LNCaP cells. In addition, 17-ABAG suppressed the growth of LNCaP xenograft tumors without any obvious side-effects. The present study demonstrated that 17-ABAG is a promising anti-tumor agent and warrants further validation in prospective studies.""","""['Zhiyuan Lin', 'Ruixian Peng', 'Zhenyu Li', 'Yang Wang', 'Chunhua Lu', 'Yuemao Shen', 'Jifeng Wang', 'Guowei Shi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Suppression of heat shock protein 27 using OGX-427 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and potentiates heat shock protein 90 inhibitors to delay castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', '17-DMCHAG, a new geldanamycin derivative, inhibits prostate cancer cells through Hsp90 inhibition and survivin downregulation.', 'Effect of the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin on androgen response of prostate cancer under hypoxic conditions.', 'Drug-mediated targeted disruption of multiple protein activities through functional inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone complex.', 'Discovery and development of heat shock protein 90 inhibitors as anticancer agents: a review of patented potent geldanamycin derivatives.', 'Exploration of the diagnostic capacity of PSAMR combined with PI-RADS scoring for clinically significant prostate cancer and establishment and validation of the Nomogram prediction model.', 'Diptoindonesin G antagonizes AR signaling and enhances the efficacy of antiandrogen therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Non-benzoquinone geldanamycin analogs trigger various forms of death in human breast cancer cells.', 'Reduced Contractility and Motility of Prostatic Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts after Inhibition of Heat Shock Protein 90.', 'The HSP90 inhibitor 17-PAG effectively inhibits the proliferation and migration of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.']"""

Specific targeting or radiosensitization of CSCs bear promise to improve tumor curability by synergistic effects in combination with radiotherapy. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be used as promising drug delivery systems for anticancer drugs such as the flavonoid catechin. Catechin is an extensively studied active ingredient of the different plants, including green tea, and it is widely recognized as co-adjuvant in cancer therapy. Here we describe the synthesis of biocompatible, catechin-loaded and gelatin-conjugated CNTs (Gel_CT_CNTs) with anticancer properties and demonstrate their potential for the eradication of prostate CSCs in combination with X-ray irradiation. Gel_CT_CNTs showed a significant enhancement of in vitro anticancer activity as compared to catechin alone. Moreover, treatment of prostate cancer cells with Gel_CT_CNT nanohybrids inhibited the tumorigenic cell population defined by a high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. A combination of X-ray irradiation and treatment with Gel_CT_CNTs caused a decrease in the protein level of stem cell-related transcription factors and regulators including Nanog, Oct4 and β-catenin and led to an increase of cancer cell radiosensitivity as demonstrated by clonogenic and spherogenic cell survival assays.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and predictors of GS upgrading when a subsequent MRI-guided biopsy is performed on patients with a diagnosis of GS 6 disease on the basis of conventional, transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy.  Methods and materials:   A consecutive series of 245 men with a diagnosis of low-risk CaP (ie, cT1c, GS 6, prostate-specific antigen <10) based on transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy was enrolled in an active surveillance protocol that used subsequent MRI-guided biopsy for confirmation of GS. ROIs were categorized on a scale of 1 to 5. The Artemis ultrasound-MRI fusion device was used to perform targeted biopsies of ROIs as well as systematic biopsies from a software-based 12-point map. Predictors of GS upgrading were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses.  Results:   Fusion biopsy resulted in 26% of patients having GS upgrading (GS 3+4 in 18%, 4+3 in 5%, and 8-9 in 3%). Of the 72% of patients with ROIs appropriate for targeting, targeted cores upgraded the GS in 18%, whereas systematic cores upgraded the GS in 24%. In patients without targeted biopsy, GS upgrading was seen in 14%. On multivariate analysis, a category 5 ROI was the most significant predictor of GS upgrading with an odds ratio of 10.56 (P < .01).  Conclusions:   Nearly 25% of men with GS 6 CaP diagnosed by standard transrectal ultrasound biopsy may experience GS upgrading when a subsequent MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy is performed. The most important single predictor of upgrading is a category 5 ROI on multiparametric MRI. GS upgrading may influence treatment decisions. Therefore, MRI-guided biopsy should be considered prior to formulating a management strategy in patients whose conventional biopsy reveals low-risk CaP.""","""['Mitchell Kamrava', 'Amar U Kishan', 'Daniel J Margolis', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Fred Dorey', 'Patricia Lieu', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Leonard S Marks']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy During Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance.', 'Targeted Biopsy to Detect Gleason Score Upgrading during Active Surveillance for Men with Low versus Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Relationship Between Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Biopsy Indication, and MRI-ultrasound Fusion-targeted Prostate Biopsy Outcomes.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Optimization of prostate biopsy: the role of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy in detection, localization and risk assessment.', 'COMPARISON OF GRADING ACCURACY OF PROSTATE CANCER IN SAMPLES ACQUIRED BY A TARGETED AND SYSTEMIC PROSTATE BIOPSY.', 'Role of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging fusion biopsy in active surveillance of prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'MRI-targeted prostate biopsy: the next step forward!', 'Clinical Significance of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Preoperative Predictor of Oncologic Outcome in Very Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', ""Urological technology: where will we be in 20 years' time?""]"""

We prospectively evaluated the use of ""high-dose-rate-like"" prostate stereotactic body RT (SBRT) salvage for this circumstance, evaluating prostate-specific antigen response, disease-free survival, and toxicity.  Methods and materials:   Between February 2009 and March 2014, 29 patients with biopsy-proven recurrent locally prostate cancer >2 years post-RT were treated. Median prior RT dose was 73.8 Gy and median interval to SBRT salvage was 88 months. Median recurrence Gleason score was 7 (79% was ≥7). Pre-existing RT toxicity >grade 1 was a reason for exclusion. Magnetic resonance imaging-defined prostate volume including any suspected extraprostatic extension, comprising the planning target volume. A total of 34 Gy/5 fractions was given, delivering a heterogeneous, high-dose-rate-like dose-escalation pattern. Toxicities were assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, criteria.  Results:   Twenty-nine treated patients had a median 24-month follow-up (range, 3-60 months). A median pre-SBRT salvage baseline prostate-specific antigen level of 3.1 ng/mL decreased to 0.65 ng/mL and 0.16 ng/mL at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Actuarial 2-year biochemical disease-free survival measured 82%, with no local failures. Toxicity >grade 1 was limited to the genitourinary domain, with 18% grade 2 or higher and 7% grade 3 or higher. No gastrointestinal toxicity >grade 1 occurred.  Conclusions:   Two-year disease-free survival is encouraging, and the prostate-specific antigen response kinetic appears comparable with that seen in de novo patients treated with SBRT, albeit still a preliminary finding. Grade ≥2 genitourinary toxicity was occasionally seen with no obvious predictive factor. Noting that our only brachytherapy case was 1 of the 2 cases with ≥grade 3 genitourinary toxicity, caution is recommended treating these patients. SBRT salvage of post-RT local recurrence appears clinically feasible, with longer term evaluation required to assess ultimate efficacy and late toxicity rates.""","""['Donald B Fuller', 'James Wurzer', 'Reza Shirazi', 'Stephen S Bridge', 'Jonathan Law', 'George Mardirossian']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Salvage prostate re-irradiation using high-dose-rate brachytherapy or focal stereotactic body radiotherapy for local recurrence after definitive radiation therapy.', 'Retreatment for Local Recurrence of Prostatic Carcinoma After Prior Therapeutic Irradiation: Efficacy and Toxicity of HDR-Like SBRT.', 'Salvage robotic SBRT for local prostate cancer recurrence after radiotherapy: preliminary results of the Oscar Lambret Center.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Salvage stereotactic body radiation therapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary radiation therapy, are benefits worth toxicity risks?: A systematic review.', 'Magnetic resonance guided SBRT reirradiation in locally recurrent prostate cancer: a multicentric retrospective analysis.', 'Linac-based stereotactic salvage reirradiation for intraprostatic prostate cancer recurrence: toxicity and outcomes.', 'Reirradiation of Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer with Cyberknife® System or Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and IGRT-Clarity®: Outcomes, Toxicities and Dosimetric Evaluation.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided Reirradiation for Local Recurrence Within the Prostate or in the Prostate Bed: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Registry Study.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: Rationale, current applications, and clinical outcome.']"""

Although many are effectively cured with local therapy alone, these men are by definition at higher risk of adverse pathologic features and clinical disease recurrence. It has been shown that the Decipher test predicts metastatic progression in cohorts that received adjuvant and salvage therapy following RP.  Objective:   To evaluate the Decipher genomic classifier in a natural history cohort of men at risk who received no additional treatment until the time of metastatic progression.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective case-cohort design for 356 men who underwent RP between 1992 and 2010 at intermediate or high risk and received no additional treatment until the time of metastasis. Participants met the following criteria: (1) Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment postsurgical (CAPRA-S) score ≥3; (2) pathologic Gleason score ≥7; and (3) post-RP prostate-specific antigen nadir <0.2 ng/ml.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was defined as regional or distant metastases. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, extension of decision curve analysis to survival data, and univariable and multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were used to measure the discrimination, net benefit, and prognostic potential of genomic and pathologic risk factors. Cumulative incidence curves were constructed using Fine-Gray competing-risks analysis with appropriate weighting of the controls to account for the case-cohort study design.  Results and limitations:   Ninety six patients had unavailable tumor blocks or failed microarray quality control. Decipher scores were then obtained for 260 patients, of whom 99 experienced metastasis. Decipher correlated with increased cumulative incidence of biochemical recurrence, metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (p<0.01). The cumulative incidence of metastasis was 12% and 47% for patients with low and high Decipher scores, respectively, at 10 yr after RP. Decipher was independently prognostic of metastasis in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 1.26 per 10% increase; p<0.01). Decipher had a c-index of 0.76 and increased the c-index of Eggener and CAPRA-S risk models from 0.76 and 0.77 to 0.86 and 0.87, respectively, at 10 yr after RP. Although the cohort was large, the single-center retrospective design is an important limitation.  Conclusions:   In a patient population that received no adjuvant or salvage therapy after prostatectomy until metastatic progression, higher Decipher scores correlated with clinical events, and inclusion of Decipher scores improved the prognostic performance of validated clinicopathologic risk models.

Data are lacking, however, that compare the outcomes of whole-gland (WG) to focal ablation therapy (FT). The aim of our study was to assess both oncologic and functional outcomes between WG and FT cryoablation of the prostate after having matched patients for preoperative characteristics.  Patients and methods:   We matched with a 1:1 ratio 317 men who underwent FT with 317 who underwent WG treatment in the Cryo Online Data (COLD) registry between 2007 and 2013. All patients were low-risk according to the D'Amico risk groups and were matched according to age at surgery. We only included preoperatively potent men. Oncologic outcomes were biochemical recurrence (BCR) free-survival defined according to the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and Phoenix criteria and assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves. Only patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir data were included in oncologic outcome analysis. Functional outcomes were assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months after the procedure for erectile function (defined as ability to have intercourse with or without erectile aids), urinary continence, urinary retention, and rates of fistula formation.  Results:   Median age at the time of the procedure was 66.5 years (standard deviation [SD] 6.6 y), and median follow-up time was 58.3 months. After surgery, 30% (n=95) and 17% (n=55) of the men who received WG and FT, respectively, underwent biopsy, with positive biopsy rates of 11.6% and 14.5%, respectively. BCR-free survival rates at 60 months according to the Phoenix definition were 80.1% and 71.3% in the WG and FT cohorts, respectively, with a hazard ratio of 0.827; according to the ASTRO definition, they were 82.1% and 73%, respectively (all P ≥ 0.1). Erectile function data at 24 months was available for 172 WG and 160 FT treated men. Recovery of erection was achieved in 46.8% and 68.8% of patients in the WG and FT cohorts, respectively (P=0.001). Urinary function data at 24 months was available for 307 WG and 313 FT patients. Continence rates were 98.7% and 100% for WG and FT groups, respectively (P=0.02). Urinary retention at 6, 12, and 24 months was reported in 7.3%, 1.9%, and 0.6%, respectively, in the WG arm, and in 5%, 1.3%, and 0.9%, respectively, in the FT arm. Finally, only one fistula was reported in each group.  Conclusions:   Men with low-risk prostate cancer who underwent FT cryoablation had comparable BCR-survival rates at 60 months to patients treated with WG. However, FT patients had higher erectile function preservation rates at 24 months post-procedure. Urinary continence, retention and fistula rates were similar between the two treatment groups.""","""['Melissa H Mendez', 'Niccolo Maria Passoni', 'Julio Pow-Sang', 'J Stephen Jones', 'Thomas J Polascik']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Propensity Score-Matched Comparison of Partial to Whole-Gland Cryotherapy for Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: An Analysis of the Cryo On-Line Data Registry Data.', 'Single center experience with third-generation cryosurgery for management of organ-confined prostate cancer: critical evaluation of short-term outcomes, complications, and patient quality of life.', 'Whole gland primary prostate cryoablation: initial results from the cryo on-line data registry.', 'A comparison of time taken to return to baseline erectile function following focal and whole gland ablative therapies for localized prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'Focal Cryotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer IRE Study (PRIS): A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Focal Therapy to Radical Treatment in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Narrative review-focal therapy: are we ready to change the prostate cancer treatment paradigm?', 'The use of advanced imaging in guiding the further investigation and treatment of primary prostate cancer.', 'Focal prostate cancer therapy in the era of multiparametric MRI: a review of options and outcomes.', 'Minimally invasive magnetic resonance image-guided prostate interventions.']"""

However, the expression of CaSR has not been systematically analyzed in prostate cancer from patients with or without bony metastases. By comparing human prostate cancer tissue sections in microarrays, we found that the CaSR was expressed in both normal prostate and primary prostate cancer as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We used two methods to analyze the expression level of CaSR. One was the pathological score read by a pathologist, the other was the positivity% obtained from the Aperio positive pixel count algorithm. Both of the methods gave consistent results. Metastatic prostate cancer tissue obtained from bone had higher CaSR expression than primary prostate cancer (P <0.05). The expression of CaSR in primary prostate cancers of patients with metastases to tissues other than bone was not different from that in primary prostate cancer of patients with or without bony metastases (P >0.05).

Here, using the Nkx3.1:Cre mouse strain and a genetic deletion approach, we investigate the role of Pten specifically in the developing mouse prostate epithelia. In contrast to its role in other developing organs, this gene is dispensable for the initial developmental processes such as budding and branching. However, as cytodifferentiation progresses, abnormal luminal cells fill the ductal lumens together with augmented epithelial proliferation. This phenotype resembles the hyperplasia seen in postnatal Pten deletion models that develop neoplasia at later stages. Consistent with this, gene expression analysis showed a number of genes affected that are shared with Pten mutant prostate cancer models, including a decrease in androgen receptor regulated genes. In depth analysis of the phenotype of these mice during development revealed that loss of Pten leads to the precocious differentiation of epithelial cells towards a luminal cell fate. This study provides novel insight into the role of Pten in prostate development as part of the process of coordinating the differentiation and proliferation of cell types in time and space to form a functional organ.""","""['Isabel B Lokody', 'Jeffrey C Francis', 'Jennifer R Gardiner', 'Janine T Erler', 'Amanda Swain']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prostate Organogenesis.', 'Conditionally ablated Pten in prostate basal cells promotes basal-to-luminal differentiation and causes invasive prostate cancer in mice.', 'Targeted biallelic inactivation of Pten in the mouse prostate leads to prostate cancer accompanied by increased epithelial cell proliferation but not by reduced apoptosis.', 'Differentiation of the ductal epithelium and smooth muscle in the prostate gland are regulated by the Notch/PTEN-dependent mechanism.', 'Portrait of PTEN: messages from mutant mice.', 'Prostate Cancer-Focus on Cholesterol.', 'Trop2: Jack of All Trades, Master of None.', 'Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II regulation of androgen receptor activity.', 'Prostate Organogenesis.', 'Oxidative stress in prostate hyperplasia and carcinogenesis.']"""

There are differing opinions on incorporating IDC-P into the Gleason score in such cases. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes and radical prostatectomy (RP) findings in patients with Gleason 3+3=6 and IDC-P on biopsy or TURP. We identified 73 patients in our consult files (2001 to 2014) who had IDC-P and Gleason score 6 carcinoma on biopsy or TURP with no invasive higher Gleason grade component. Clinical follow-up information was available in 62 patients. Treatment was RP in 14 patients, radiation therapy in 31 patients, androgen deprivation therapy in 1 patient, and cryotherapy in 1 patient. Four patients were found to have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and were treated with chemotherapy. Eleven patients underwent active surveillance after diagnosis, of which 6 were eventually treated for progressive disease. The 14 RP specimens were centrally reviewed, and 86% had extensive IDC-P present. The Gleason grades in these 14 RP cases were 3+3=6 in 21%, 3+4=7 in 36%, 4+3=7 in 29%, and 4+4=8 in 14%. Pathologic stage was pT2 in 36%, pT3a in 36%, and pT3b in 28%. After 3 years, there was a 20% actuarial rate of disease progression in men who underwent either RP or radiation therapy. In summary, most men with IDC-P on biopsy/TURP have aggressive tumors, even when the invasive tumor on biopsy is Gleason score 6. As a minority of men may only have Gleason 6 invasive cancer at RP and a favorable prognosis, we recommend that IDC-P on biopsy/TURP be reported separately and not assigned a Gleason score.""","""['Francesca Khani', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Re: Prostate Biopsy Specimens with Gleason 3+3=6 and Intraductal Carcinoma: Radical Prostatectomy Findings and Clinical Outcomes.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate without invasive carcinoma on needle biopsy: emphasis on radical prostatectomy findings.', 'Atypical Intraductal Cribriform Proliferations of the Prostate Exhibit Similar Molecular and Clinicopathologic Characteristics as Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Heterogeneous clinicopathological features of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate: a comparison between ""precursor-like"" and ""regular type"" lesions.', 'The 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) White Paper on Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'WHO Classification of Tumours fifth edition: evolving issues in the classification, diagnosis, and prognostication of prostate cancer.', 'Genomic Features and Clinical Implications of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer: The Impact of Grading Criteria and the Significance of the Amount of Intraductal Carcinoma.', 'Current Understanding and Management of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.']"""

Follow-up in silico modeling and profiling in cell-based assays allowed us to identify NSC130362, pharmacophore analog of ML100 that induced 65-95% cytotoxicity in cancer cells and did not affect the viability of human primary hepatocytes. In agreement with the activation of the apoptotic pathway, both ML100 and NSC130362 synergistically with TRAIL induced caspase-3/7 activity in MDA-MB-435 cells. Subsequent affinity chromatography and inhibition studies convincingly demonstrated that glutathione reductase (GSR), a key component of the oxidative stress response, is a target of NSC130362. In accordance with the role of GSR in the TRAIL pathway, GSR gene silencing potentiated TRAIL activity in MDA-MB-435 cells but not in human hepatocytes. Inhibition of GSR activity resulted in the induction of oxidative stress, as was evidenced by an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxidation of mitochondrial membrane after NSC130362 treatment in MDA-MB-435 cells but not in human hepatocytes. The antioxidant reduced glutathione (GSH) fully protected MDA-MB-435 cells from cell lysis induced by NSC130362 and TRAIL, thereby further confirming the interplay between GSR and TRAIL.

Here we have investigated the ability of Pim kinases to promote metastatic growth of prostate cancer cells in two xenograft models for human prostate cancer. We have also evaluated the efficacy of Pim-selective inhibitors to antagonize these effects.  Results:   We show here that tumorigenic growth of both subcutaneously and orthotopically inoculated prostate cancer xenografts is enhanced by stable overexpression of either Pim-1 or Pim-3. Moreover, Pim-overexpressing orthotopic prostate tumors are highly invasive and able to migrate not only to the nearby prostate-draining lymph nodes, but also into the lungs to form metastases. When the xenografted mice are daily treated with the Pim-selective inhibitor DHPCC-9, both the volumes as well as the metastatic capacity of the tumors are drastically decreased. Interestingly, the Pim-promoted metastatic growth of the orthotopic xenografts is associated with enhanced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, forced Pim expression also increases phosphorylation of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, which may enable the tumor cells to migrate towards tissues such as the lungs that express the CXCL12 chemokine ligand.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that Pim overexpression enhances the invasive properties of prostate cancer cells in vivo. These effects can be reduced by the Pim-selective inhibitor DHPCC-9, which can reach tumor tissues without serious side effects. Thus, Pim-targeting therapies with DHPCC-9-like compounds may help to prevent progression of local prostate carcinomas to fatally metastatic malignancies.""","""['Niina M Santio', 'Sini K Eerola', 'Ilkka Paatero', 'Jari Yli-Kauhaluoma', 'Fabrice Anizon', 'Pascale Moreau', 'Johanna Tuomela', 'Pirkko Härkönen', 'Päivi J Koskinen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Pim-selective inhibitor DHPCC-9 reveals Pim kinases as potent stimulators of cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'PIM kinases are essential for chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell survival (PIM2/3) and CXCR4-mediated microenvironmental interactions (PIM1).', 'Pim-3 promotes the growth of human pancreatic cancer in the orthotopic nude mouse model through vascular endothelium growth factor.', 'PIM kinases: an overview in tumors and recent advances in pancreatic cancer.', 'PIM kinases: From survival factors to regulators of cell motility.', 'Pim Kinases: Important Regulators of Cardiovascular Disease.', 'PIM1 phosphorylates ABI2 to enhance actin dynamics and promote tumor invasion.', 'Targeting Pim kinases in hematological cancers: molecular and clinical review.', 'PIM3 kinase promotes tumor metastasis in hepatoblastoma by upregulating cell surface expression of chemokine receptor cxcr4.', 'The Role of PIM Kinases in Pediatric Solid Tumors.']"""

Normally, to moderate RTK signalling, induction of Sprouty (SPRY) and Sprouty-related (SPRED) antagonists occurs. Whilst decreased SPRY and SPRED has been described in some cancers, their role in prostate cancer is poorly understood. Therefore, we hypothesise that due to the need for tight regulation of RTK signalling, SPRY and SPRED negative regulators provide a degree of redundancy which ensures that a suppression of one or more family member does not lead to disease. Contrary to this, our analyses of prostates from 24-week-old Spry1- or Spry2-deficientmice, either hemizygous (+/-) or homozygous (-/-) for the null allele, revealed a significantly greater incidence of PIN compared to wild-type littermates. We further investigated redundancy of negative regulators in the clinical setting in a preliminary analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus and Oncomine human prostate cancer datasets. Consistent with our hypothesis, in two datasets analysed a significant cosuppression of SPRYs and SPREDs is evident. These findings demonstrate the importance of negative regulators of receptor tyrosine signalling, such as Spry, in the clinical setting, and highlight their importance for future pharmacopeia.""","""['Stephen J Assinder', 'Daniella Beniamen', 'Frank J Lovicu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Spry1 and Spry2 are necessary for eyelid closure.', 'Negative regulation of lens fiber cell differentiation by RTK antagonists Spry and Spred.', 'Cooperative and independent functions of FGF and Wnt signaling during early inner ear development.', 'Sprouty proteins, masterminds of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.', 'Fibrosis in the lens.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between PRAC methylation status and clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in long-term follow-up primary nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The clinical relevance of PRAC methylation was determined in 136 human bladder specimens (eight normal controls [NCs] and 128 primary NMIBCs) using quantitative pyrosequencing analysis. PRAC methylation was significantly higher in NMIBC patients than in NCs and was significantly associated with higher grade and more advanced stage of cancer. Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed significant difference in tumor recurrence and progression according to PRAC methylation status (both p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the PRAC methylation status was a strong predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.652; p = 0.012) and progression (HR, 9.531; p = 0.035) of NMIBC.

In this study, by comparative proteomics analysis of PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues we attempted to elucidate the proteins and regulatory pathways involved in this disease.  Methods:   The samples used in this study were fresh surgical tissues with clinically and histologically confirmed PCa (n = 19) and BPH (n = 33). We used two dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics analysis.  Results:   Thirty-nine spots with statistically significant 1.8-fold variation or more in abundance, corresponding to 28 proteins were identified. The IPA analysis pointed out to 3 possible networks regulated within MAPK, ERK, TGFB1, and ubiquitin pathways. Thirteen of the identified proteins, namely, constituents of the intermediate filaments (KRT8, KRT18, DES), potential tumor suppressors (ARHGAP1, AZGP1, GSTM2, and MFAP4), transport and membrane organization proteins (FABP5, GC, and EHD2), chaperons (FKBP4 and HSPD1) and known cancer marker (NME1) have been associated with prostate and other cancers by numerous proteomics, genomics or functional studies. We evidenced for the first time the dysregulation of 9 proteins (CSNK1A1, ARID5B, LYPLA1, PSMB6, RABEP1, TALDO1, UBE2N, PPP1CB, and SERPINB1) that may have role in PCa. The UBE2N, PSMB6, and PPP1CB, involved in cell cycle regulation and progression were evaluated by Western blot analysis which confirmed significantly higher abundances of UBE2N and PSMB6 and significantly lower abundance of PPP1CB in PCa.

Patients and methods:   A total of 50 384 men diagnosed with localized PCa between 1992 and 2007 were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry areas. We compared those who received ADT within 2 years of PCa diagnosis with those who did not, calculated as monthly equivalent doses of GnRH agonists (<8, ≥8 doses), or orchiectomy. Men were further stratified according to life expectancy (<5 years, 5-10 years and >10 years). Adjusted Cox hazard models assessed the risk of new-onset coronary heart disease (CHD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), sudden cardiac death (SCD) and cardiac-related interventions, as well as any of these events.  Results:   Overall, patients receiving GnRH agonists were more likely to experience a cardiac event, with the most pronounced effect among those receiving ≥8 doses (hazard ratio [HR] <8 doses: 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.16, and HR ≥8 doses: 1.18, 95% CI 1.14-1.22; both P < 0.001). The effect of prolonged (≥8 doses) GnRH agonist use on cardiac events was sustained across all strata of life expectancy; however, there was no effect among men with a life expectancy of <5 years and when use of GnRH agonists was limited to <8 doses (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.67-1.46; P = 0.964). The use of GnRH agonists was associated with a higher risk of CHD (HR <8 doses: 1.13, 95% CI 1.09-1.17 and HR ≥8 doses: 1.17, 95% CI 1.13-1.21; both P < 0.001). Conversely, the use of GnRH was generally not associated with an increased risk of AMI or SCD, except for men who received ≥8 doses of GnRH agonists and had a life expectancy of ≥5 years, who were at a significantly higher risk of SCD (HR for life expectancy 5-10 years: 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.33; P = 0.003 and HR for life expectancy >10 years: 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.29; P = 0.006). Finally, orchiectomy was not associated with overall cardiac events, AMI or SCD, and was protective with regard to cardiac-related interventions (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.90, P = 0.001).  Conclusion:   Exposure to ADT with GnRH agonists is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events in elderly men with localized PCa and a decent life expectancy.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in various types of cancer and proposed as potential therapeutic targets for patients. In the present study, we aimed to identify miRNA that could serve as a therapeutic target for taxane-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   In order to identify miRNAs related to taxane-resistance, miRNA profiling was performed using prostate cancer PC-3 cells and paclitaxel-resistant PC-3 cell lines established from PC-3 cells. Microarray analysis of mRNA expression was also conducted to search for potential target genes of miRNA. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to examine miRNA binding to the 3'-UTR of target genes. The effects of ectopic expression of miRNA on cell growth, tubulin polymerization, drug sensitivity, and apoptotic signaling pathway were investigated in a paclitaxel-resistant PC-3 cell line.  Results:   The expression of miR-130a was down-regulated in all paclitaxel-resistant cell lines compared with parental PC-3 cells. Based on mRNA microarray analysis and luciferase reporter assay, we identified SLAIN1 as a direct target gene for miR-130a. Transfection of a miR-130a precursor into a paclitaxel-resistant cell line suppressed cell growth and increased the sensitivity to paclitaxel. Lastly, ectopic expression of miR-130a did not affect the polymerized tubulin level, but activated apoptotic signaling through activation of caspase-8.  Conclusions:   Our results suggested that reduced expression of miR-130a may be involved in the paclitaxel-resistance and that miR-130a could be a therapeutic target for taxane-resistant prostate cancer patients.""","""['Yasunori Fujita', 'Toshio Kojima', 'Kyojiro Kawakami', 'Kosuke Mizutani', 'Taku Kato', 'Takashi Deguchi', 'Masafumi Ito']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['MicroRNA-34a Attenuates Paclitaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells via Direct Suppression of JAG1/Notch1 Axis.', 'Role of microRNAs in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells.', 'A semisynthetic taxane Yg-3-46a effectively evades P-glycoprotein and β-III tubulin mediated tumor drug resistance in vitro.', 'The role of miR-130a in cancer.', 'Taxane refractory prostate cancer.', 'Noncoding RNAs in apoptosis: identification and function.', 'Association of Androgenic Regulation and MicroRNAs in Acinar Adenocarcinoma of Prostate.', 'A distinct metabolic response characterizes sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition in multiple myeloma.', 'Potential diagnostic and prognostic value and regulatory relationship of long noncoding RNA CCAT1 and miR-130a-3p in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'LncRNA H19 interacted with miR-130a-3p and miR-17-5p to modify radio-resistance and chemo-sensitivity of cardiac carcinoma cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   In a prospective comparative study, from July 2010 to June 2013, 53 men with newly histologically diagnosed intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer underwent acetate-PET/CT investigation at one regional centre before laparoscopic extended pelvic LN dissection (ePLND) at one referral centre. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of acetate-PET/CT were calculated. Comparisons were made between true-positive and false-negative PET/CT cases to identify differences in the clinical parameters: PSA level, Gleason status, lymph metastasis burden and size, calculated risk of LN involvement, and curative treatment decisions.  Results:   In all, 26 patients had surgically/histologically confirmed LN metastasis (LN+).

While orthotopic implantation is technically difficult, particularly in the mouse, most models favor subcutaneous tumor growth. This however provides little information about natural tumor growth behavior and tumor stroma interaction. Furthermore, established prostate cancer cell lines grown as in vivo xenografts are not able to reflect the variety of tumor specific growth patterns and growth behavior in men. Primary cell cultures are difficult to handle and an induction of orthotopic tumors has not been successful yet. Therefore, a tumorgraft model using tumor tissue from prostatectomy specimens was developed.  Methods:   Balb/c nude mice were used to graft fresh prostate tumor tissue by renal subcapsular and orthotopic implantation. Testosterone propionate was supplemented. Animals were tracked by means of 30 MHz ultrasound to monitor tumor engraftment and growth. Autopsy, histology, PSA measurements as well as immunostaining and PCR for human tissue were performed to confirm orthotopic tumor growth.  Results:   Renal subcapsular engraftment was seen in 2 of 3 mice. Orthotopic engraftment was observed in 7 of 11 animals (63.6%) with an overall engraftment of 5 out of 9 patient specimens (55.6%). Ultrasound confirmed the tumor growth over time. Of interest, the tumorgrafts not only retained essential features of the parental tumors, but also stained positive for tumor specific markers such as AR, PSA, and AMACR. Tumor positive animals showed highly elevated serum PSA levels with confirmation of a human specific PCR sequence and a human endothelial cell lining in the tumor vessels.  Conclusions:   Standardized implantation of fresh tumor tissue in nude mice prostates generates tumorgrafts with histological properties of organ-confined prostate cancer. These tumorgrafts display a new approach for an optimized in vivo model of prostate cancer and will allow further investigations on specific pathways of tumor initiation and progression as well as therapeutic response.""","""['Matthias Saar', 'Christina Körbel', 'Johannes Linxweiler', 'Volker Jung', 'Jörn Kamradt', 'Andrea Hasenfus', 'Michael Stöckle', 'Gerhard Unteregger', 'Michael D Menger']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prostate cancer: Novel xenografts in mice--a new wave of preclinical models.', 'A novel mouse model of human prostate cancer to study intraprostatic tumor growth and the development of lymph node metastases.', 'Inhibition of human prostate cancer xenograft growth by 125I labeled triple-helix forming oligonucleotide directed against androgen receptor.', 'Real-Time GFP Intravital Imaging of the Differences in Cellular and Angiogenic Behavior of Subcutaneous and Orthotopic Nude-Mouse Models of Human PC-3 Prostate Cancer.', 'In vivo and in vitro approaches to study metastasis in human prostatic cancer.', 'Use of nude mouse xenograft models in prostate cancer research.', 'Prostate and breast cancer: similarities and differences.', 'Primary Tumor Resection Decelerates Disease Progression in an Orthotopic Mouse Model of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Spontaneous and Induced Animal Models for Cancer Research.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts stimulate primary tumor growth and metastatic spread in an orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Critical evaluation of the subcutaneous engraftments of hormone naïve primary prostate cancer.']"""

We studied the influence of PV on outcomes in a large single center dataset and summarized the existing literature.  Methods:   5,477 patients who underwent RP between January 2008 and December 2011 were analyzed. The impact of PV on biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Uni- and multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate the impact of PV on surgical margin (SM), 1-week, 3-months and 12-months continence and 3-months and 12-months potency. Finally, the impact of PV on intraoperative blood loss was analyzed using uni- and multivariate linear regressions.  Results:   Median follow-up was 36.1 months. Overall, 16.5% of patients recurred during the follow-up period. The mean preoperative PV was 43.3 ml. One-week, 3-months and 12-months continence rates were 55.6%, 69.3%, and 87.4% for patients with PV ≥ 70 compared to 64.4%, 78.3%, and 92.1% for patients with PV < 30, respectively. Three-months and 12-months potency rates were 37.1% and 54.8% for men with large glands (≥70) and 56.3% and 65.0% for men with PV < 30. In multivariate analysis, continence at 1 week, 3 months and 12 months was significantly worse in patients with glands ≥70 ml, while potency was not influenced by PV in multivariate analysis. There was a higher mean blood loss (P < 0.001) in patients with larger glands. In univariate analysis, higher PV was significantly associated with lower BCR (P = 0.019), but not with metastasis free survival (P = 0.112).  Conclusions:   PV significantly influences BCR-free survival only in univariate analysis.

Methods:   A total of 6,537 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1996-2009 among the 80,144 men in the trial and 617 died from prostate cancer during the median follow-up of 7.5 years after the diagnosis. Prescription drug purchases information was obtained from the national reimbursement database. We calculated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for PCa-specific survival using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis separately for NSAID and aspirin usage before and after the diagnosis.  Results:   We observed an increased risk of PCa death associated with both pre- and post-diagnostic NSAID usage (HR 1.30, 95%CI 1.07-1.58 and HR 2.09, 95%CI 1.75-2.50, respectively). An increasing risk trend was observed by cumulative dose and intensity of NSAID use. When the last three years were excluded from the analysis, the death risk diminished to a protective level (HR 0.42, 95%CI 0.34-0.51 and HR 0.30 95%CI 0.24-0.39).

Therefore, a better understanding of this phenomenon is imperative and might help to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α) and its receptor CXCR4 have been implicated as regulators of bone resorption and bone metastatic development, suggesting that agents able to suppress this signaling pathway may be used as pharmacological treatments. In this study we studied if two CXCR4 receptor antagonists, Plerixafor and CTE9908, may affect bone metastatic disease induced by Pca in preclinical experimental models  Methods:   To verify the hypothesis that CXCR4 inhibition affects Pca metastatic disease, selective CXCR4 compounds, Plerixafor, and CTE9908, were tested in preclinical models known to generate bone lesions. Additionally, the expression levels of CXCR4 and SDF-1α were analyzed in a number of human tissues derived from primary tumors, lymph-nodes and osseous metastases of Pca as well as in a wide panel of human Pca cell lines to non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic phenotype.  Results:   Bone-derived Pca cells express higher CXCR4 levels than other Pca cell lines. This differential expression was also observed in human Pca samples. In vitro evidence supports the hypothesis that factors produced by bone microenvironment differentially sustain CXCR4 and SDF1-α expression with respect to prostate microenvironment determining increased efficacy toward Plerixafor. The use of SDF1-α neutralizing antibodies greatly reduced the increase of CXCR4 expression in cells co-cultured with bone stromal cells (BMSc) and to a lesser extent in cells co-cultured with prostate stromal cells (HPSc) and partially reduced SDF1-α Plerixafor efficacy. SDF-1α induced tumor cell migration and invasion, as well as MMP-9, MMP-2, and uPA expression, which were reduced by Plerixafor. The incidence of X-ray detectable bone lesions was significantly reduced following Plerixafor and CTE9908 treatment Kaplan-Meier probability plots showed a significant improvement in the overall survival of mice treated with Plerixafor and CTE9908. The reduced intra-osseous growth of PC3 and PCb2 tumor cells after intratibial injection, as a result of Plerixafor and CTE9908 treatment, correlated with decreased osteolysis and serum levels of both mTRAP and type I collagen fragments (CTX), which were significantly lower with respect to controls.  Conclusions:   Our report provides novel information on the potential activity of CXCR4 inhibitors on the formation and progression of Pca bone and soft tissue metastases and supports a biological rationale for the use of these inhibitors in men at high risk to develop clinically evident bone lesions.""","""['Giovanni Luca Gravina', 'Andrea Mancini', 'Paola Muzi', 'Luca Ventura', 'Leda Biordi', 'Enrico Ricevuto', 'Simona Pompili', 'Claudia Mattei', 'Ernesto Di Cesare', 'Emmanuele A Jannini', 'Claudio Festuccia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote the progression of endometrial cancer via the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis.', 'Skeletal localization and neutralization of the SDF-1(CXCL12)/CXCR4 axis blocks prostate cancer metastasis and growth in osseous sites in vivo.', 'CXCR4 inhibition with AMD3100 sensitizes prostate cancer to docetaxel chemotherapy.', 'Potential of CXCR4 antagonists for the treatment of metastatic lung cancer.', 'The CXCR4/SDF-1 chemokine axis: a potential therapeutic target for bone metastases?', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) blockade in cancer treatment.', 'The Role of Cytokines in the Metastasis of Solid Tumors to the Spine: Systematic Review.', 'Inhibition of CXCR4 Enhances the Efficacy of Radiotherapy in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Models.', 'Subsets of cancer cells expressing CX3CR1 are endowed with metastasis-initiating properties and resistance to chemotherapy.']"""

Be Clear on Cancer 'blood in pee': a case in point""","""Objectives:   To assess the impact on suspected cancer referral burden and new cancer diagnosis of Public Health England's recent Be Clear on Cancer 'blood in pee' mass media campaign.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study design was used. For two distinct time periods, August 2012 to May 2013 and August 2013 to May 2014, all referrals of patients deemed to be at risk of urological cancer by the referring primary healthcare physician to Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust were screened. Data were collected on age and sex and whether the referral was for visible haematuria, non-visible haematuria or other suspected urological cancer. In addition to referral data, hospital episode data for all new renal cell (RCC) and upper and lower tract transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), as well as testicular and prostate cancer diagnoses for the same time periods were obtained.  Results:   Over the campaign period and the subsequent 3 months, the number of haematuria referrals increased by 92% (P = 0.013) when compared with the same period a year earlier. This increase in referrals was not associated with a significant corresponding rise in cancer diagnosis; instead changes of 26.8% (P = 0.56) and -3.3% (P = 0.84) were seen in RCC and TCC, respectively.  Conclusions:   This study has shown that the Be Clear on Cancer 'blood in pee' mass media campaign significantly increased the number of new suspected cancer referrals, but there was no significant change in the diagnosis of target cancers across a large catchment. Mass media campaigns are expensive, require significant planning and appropriate implementation and, while the findings of this study do not challenge their fundamental objective, more work needs to be done to understand why no significant change in target cancers was observed. Further consideration should also be given to the increased referral burden that results from these campaigns, such that pre-emptive strategies, including educational and process mapping, across primary and secondary care can be implemented.""","""['Archie Hughes-Hallett', 'Daisy Browne', 'Elsie Mensah', 'Justin Vale', 'Erik Mayer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""[""Be better with public health campaigns (and taxpayers' money)."", ""A prospective evaluation of the fourth national Be Clear on Cancer 'Blood in Pee' campaign in England."", ""Be better with public health campaigns (and taxpayers' money)."", 'Outcomes of haematuria referrals: two-year data from a single large university hospital in Denmark.', 'The association between symptoms and bladder or renal tract cancer in primary care: a systematic review.', 'Patients with new onset haematuria: assessing the discriminant value of clinical information in relation to urological malignancies.', ""A prospective evaluation of the fourth national Be Clear on Cancer 'Blood in Pee' campaign in England."", 'Diagnostic and treatment delays among patients with primary bladder cancer in Poland: a survey study.', 'Public awareness of and responses to media coverage of invitation errors in the Breast Screening Programme in England: a cross-sectional population survey.', 'Promoting prompt help-seeking for symptoms - assessing the impact of a gynaecological cancer leaflet on presentations to primary care: a record-based randomised control trial.', 'The pathway to consultation for rheumatoid arthritis: exploring anticipated actions between the onset of symptoms and face-to-face encounter with a healthcare professional.']"""

However, the development of similar strategies to treat solid tumors raises challenges with respect to tumor antigen selection and the achievement of efficient T-cell homing, survival and sustained effector function within the tumor microenvironment. To address these challenges, we have developed a gene-modified cellular therapy called T4 immunotherapy. To generate T4 immunotherapy, autologous T-cells are engineered by retroviral transduction to co-express two transgenes: (1) a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), T1E28z, targeted against a range of ErbB homodimers and heterodimers and (2) a chimeric cytokine receptor, 4αβ, that allows the selective ex vivo expansion of engineered cells using interleukin-4. Targeting of the extended ErbB network using CAR T-cells is supported by prevalence of ErbB dysregulation in diverse solid tumors and the clinical impact of monoclonal antibody therapy directed against members of this family. However, the key obstacle to effective clinical translation is risk of on-target toxicity owing to the lower level expression of ErbB family members in many healthy tissues. To de-risk T4 immunotherapy in man, we are undertaking a trial in patients with locally advanced or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In that setting, engineered T-cells are injected directly into the tumor without prior lymphodepletion, an approach that we believe will minimize risk of toxicity. This chapter outlines how we plan to advance the development of T4 immunotherapy thereafter in Phase II clinical testing. In that setting, regional (intracavitary) approaches will be used to administer this therapy to patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma.""","""['Sophie Papa', 'May van Schalkwyk', 'John Maher']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""[""Intracavitary 'T4 immunotherapy' of malignant mesothelioma using pan-ErbB re-targeted CAR T-cells."", 'Synergistic Chemoimmunotherapy of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Using ErbB-Retargeted T Cells Combined with Carboplatin.', 'Design of a phase I clinical trial to evaluate intratumoral delivery of ErbB-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cells in locally advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer.', 'ErbB-targeted CAR T-cell immunotherapy of cancer.', 'CAR T-cell therapy for lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma.', 'Recent advances and future perspectives of CAR-T cell therapy in head and neck cancer.', 'Intratumoral pan-ErbB targeted CAR-T for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: interim analysis of the T4 immunotherapy study.', 'Ligand-based CAR-T cell: Different strategies to drive T cells in future new treatments.', 'Comparing Intraperitoneal and Intravenous Personalized ErbB2CAR-T for the Treatment of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'Immunotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and rare head and neck malignancies.']"""

Methods:   We addressed this in the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial by incorporating a RDE programme by stratification at randomisation. Men were allocated 6 or 18 months AS±18 months zoledronate (Z). The main endpoint was a composite of clinically diagnosed LP or PSA progression with a PSA doubling time ⩾6 months. Fine and Gray competing risk modelling with adjustment for site clustering produced cumulative incidence estimates at 6.5 years for each RDE group.  Results:   Composite LP declined coherently in the 66, 70 and 74 Gy external beam dosing groups and was lowest in the high dose rate brachytherapy boost (HDRB) group.

Experimental design:   In this study, IHC was performed to detect protein expression in mouse prostate tissue sections and human prostate cancer tissue sections. Subcutaneously and orthotopically xenografted tumor models were established to evaluate the functions of autocrine cholinergic signaling in regulating prostate cancer growth and castration resistance. Western blotting analysis was performed to assess the autocrine cholinergic signaling-induced signaling pathway.  Results:   We found the expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the secretion of acetylcholine and the expression of CHRM3 in prostate epithelial cells, supporting the presence of autocrine cholinergic signaling in the prostate epithelium. In addition, we found that CHRM3 was upregulated in clinical prostate cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues. Overexpression of CHRM3 or activation of CHRM3 by carbachol promoted cell proliferation, migration, and castration resistance. On the contrary, blockading CHRM3 by shRNA or treatment with darifenacin inhibited prostate cancer growth and castration resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that autocrine cholinergic signaling caused calmodulin/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaM/CaMKK)-mediated phosphorylation of Akt.

Results:   Coexpression of CHGA and SYP in >30% of cells was observed in 22 of 155 metastases (9 patients); 11 of the 22 metastases were AR(+)/PSA(+) (6 patients), 11/22 were AR-/PSA- (4 patients), and 4/24 LuCaP PDXs were AR(-)/PSA(-). By IHC, of the 71 metastases analyzed by whole-genome microarrays, 5 metastases were CHGA(+)/SYP(+)/AR(-), and 5 were CHGA(+)/SYP(+)/AR(+).

Family history of BC is considered one of the strongest risk factors for BCIS.  Methods:   To evaluate the association of BC susceptibility loci with BCIS risk, we genotyped 39 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), associated with risk of invasive BC, in 1317 BCIS cases, 10,645 invasive BC cases, and 14,006 healthy controls in the National Cancer Institute's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). Using unconditional logistic regression models adjusted for age and study, we estimated the association of SNPs with BCIS using two different comparison groups: healthy controls and invasive BC subjects to investigate whether BCIS and BC share a common genetic profile.  Results:   We found that five SNPs (CDKN2BAS-rs1011970, FGFR2-rs3750817, FGFR2-rs2981582, TNRC9-rs3803662, 5p12-rs10941679) were significantly associated with BCIS risk (P value adjusted for multiple comparisons <0.0016). Comparing invasive BC and BCIS, the largest difference was for CDKN2BAS-rs1011970, which showed a positive association with BCIS (OR = 1.24, 95 % CI: 1.11-1.38, P = 1.27 x 10(-4)) and no association with invasive BC (OR = 1.03, 95 % CI: 0.99-1.07, P = 0.06), with a P value for case-case comparison of 0.006.

However, due to the heterogeneity of disease samples, many disease genes are even not always consistently up-/down-regulated, leading to be under-estimated. This problem will seriously influence effective personalized diagnosis or treatment. The expression variance and expression covariance can address such a problem in a network manner. But, these analyses always require multiple samples rather than one sample, which is generally not available in clinical practice for each individual. To extract the common and specific network characteristics for individual patients in this paper, a novel differential network model, e.g. personalized dysfunctional gene network, is proposed to integrate those genes with different features, such as genes with the differential gene expression (DEG), genes with the differential expression variance (DEVG) and gene-pairs with the differential expression covariance (DECG) simultaneously, to construct personalized dysfunctional networks. This model uses a new statistic-like measurement on differential information, i.e., a differential score (DEVC), to reconstruct the differential expression network between groups of normal and diseased samples; and further quantitatively evaluate different feature genes in the patient-specific network for each individual. This DEVC-based differential expression network (DEVC-net) has been applied to the study of complex diseases for prostate cancer and diabetes. (1) Characterizing the global expression change between normal and diseased samples, the differential gene networks of those diseases were found to have a new bi-coloured topological structure, where their non hub-centred sub-networks are mainly composed of genes/proteins controlling various biological processes. (2) The differential expression variance/covariance rather than differential expression is new informative sources, and can be used to identify genes or gene-pairs with discriminative power, which are ignored by traditional methods. (3) More importantly, DEVC-net is effective to measure the expression state or activity of different feature genes and their network or modules in one sample for an individual. All of these results support that DEVC-net indeed has a clear advantage to effectively extract discriminatively interpretable features of gene/protein network of one sample (i.e. personalized dysfunctional network) even when disease samples are heterogeneous, and thus can provide new features like gene-pairs, in addition to the conventional individual genes, to the analysis of the personalized diagnosis and prognosis, and a better understanding on the underlying biological mechanisms.""","""['Xiangtian Yu', 'Tao Zeng', 'Xiangdong Wang', 'Guojun Li', 'Luonan Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Personalized characterization of diseases using sample-specific networks.', 'Comparative network stratification analysis for identifying functional interpretable network biomarkers.', 'A novel network control model for identifying personalized driver genes in cancer.', 'Network biomarkers reveal dysfunctional gene regulations during disease progression.', ""From 'differential expression' to 'differential networking' - identification of dysfunctional regulatory networks in diseases."", 'Network Control Models With Personalized Genomics Data for Understanding Tumor Heterogeneity in Cancer.', 'Interpreting Functional Impact of Genetic Variations by Network QTL for Genotype-Phenotype Association Study.', 'Novel cancer subtyping method based on patient-specific gene regulatory network.', 'Landscape dynamic network biomarker analysis reveals the tipping point of transcriptome reprogramming to prevent skin photodamage.', 'Identification of Key Genes With Differential Correlations in Lung Adenocarcinoma.']"""

Our objective was to compare the measurements obtained with digital image analysis (DIA) versus virtual microscopy (visual scoring (VS)).  Methods:   To do so, we compared the measurement distributions of each technique and their ability to predict clinically useful endpoints. A tissue microarray series from a cohort of 225 men who underwent radical prostatectomy was immunostained for Ki-67. The percentage of Ki-67 positive nuclei in malignant cells was assessed both by VS and DIA, and a H-score was calculated. The distribution and predictive ability of these scoring methods to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) and death from prostate cancer (DPCa) were compared using Mann-Whitney test and C-index.  Results:   The measurements obtained with VS were similar to the DIA measurements (p = 0.73) but dissimilar to the H-score (p < 0.001). Cox regression models showed that Ki-67 was associated with BCR (HR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.10-1.94) and DPCa (HR 1.26, 95 % CI 1.06-1.50). C-indexes revealed that Ki-67 was a better predictor of DPCa (0.803, 0.8059 and 0.789; VS, DIA and H-score, respectively) than of BCR (0.625, 0.632 and 0.604; VS, DIA and H-score, respectively).  Conclusion:   The measurement distributions and the predictive abilities of VS and DIA were similar and presented the same predictive behaviour in our cohort, supporting the role of Ki-67 proliferative index as an important prognostic factor of BCR and DPCa in prostate cancer post RP.

Inhibitors of the IBP, including statins and nitrogenous bisphosphonates, are used clinically for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and bone disease respectively. The statins work predominantly in the liver, while the nitrogenous bisphosphonates are highly sequestered to bone. Inhibition of the entire IBP is limited by organ specificity and side effects resulting from depletion of all isoprenoids. We have developed a novel compound, disodium [(6Z,11E,15E)-9-[bis(sodiooxy)phosphoryl]-17-hydroxy-2,6,12,16-tetramethyheptadeca-2,6,11,15-tetraen-9-yl]phosphonate (GGOHBP), which selectively targets geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, reducing post-translational protein geranylgeranylation. Intracardiac injection of luciferase-expressing human-derived 22Rv1 PCa cells into SCID mice resulted in tumor development in bone (100 %), adrenal glands (72 %), mesentery (22 %), liver (17 %), and the thoracic cavity (6 %). Three weeks after tumor inoculation, daily subcutaneous (SQ) injections of 1.5 mg/kg GGOHBP or the vehicle were given for one month. Dissected tumors revealed a reduction in adrenal gland tumors corresponding to a 54 % (P < 0.005) reduction in total adrenal gland tumor weight of the treated mice as compared to vehicle-treated controls. Western blot analysis of the harvested tissues showed a reduction in Rap1A geranylgeranylation in adrenal glands and mesenteric tumors of the treated mice while non-tumorous tissues and control mice showed no Rap1A alteration.

A mission-critical step in implementing a robust active surveillance program and plan its resource and service requirements, is to gauge its current practice across the United Kingdom. Furthermore it is imperative to determine the existing practices in the context of the recommendations suggested by the recent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance on active surveillance of prostate cancer.  Methods:   An internet questionnaire was circulated to urologists, clinical oncologists and urology nurse specialists across three geographically distinct cancer networks. Twenty five questions across four domains were assessed. (i) hospital resources (staff and clinical areas) utilised for active surveillance (ii) enrolment criteria (iii) follow up (iv) criteria that trigger conversion to active treatment.  Results:   We received 35 responses, 20 of which were from urologists. The survey data suggests that there is marked heterogeneity in enrolment criteria with patients having features of intermediate-risk prostate cancer often recruited into Active Surveillance programs. Only 60 % of our respondents use multiparametric MRI routinely to assess patient suitability for active surveillance. In addition, marked variation exists in how patients are followed up with regard to PSA testing intervals and timing of repeat biopsies. Only 40 % undertake a repeat biopsy at 12 months. Tumour upgrading on repeat biopsy, an increase in tumour volume or percentage of core biopsies involved would prompt a recommendation for treatment amongst most survey respondents. In addition allocation of resources and services for active surveillance is poor. Currently there are no dedicated active surveillance clinics, which are well-structured, -resourced and -supported for regular patient counselling and follow up.  Conclusion:   This variability in enrolment criteria and follow up is also demonstrated in international and national series of active surveillance. Resources are not currently in place across the UK to support an active surveillance program and a national discussion and debate to plan resources is much required so that it can become a mainstream therapeutic strategy.""","""['Yiannis Philippou', 'Hary Raja', 'Vincent J Gnanapragasam']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Selecting men diagnosed with prostate cancer for active surveillance using a risk calculator: a prospective impact study.', 'Biopsy features associated with prostate cancer progression in active surveillance patients: comparison of three statistical models.', 'Perceptions of Active Surveillance and Treatment Recommendations for Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Results from a National Survey of Radiation Oncologists and Urologists.', 'The critical role of the pathologist in determining eligibility for active surveillance as a management option in patients with prostate cancer: consensus statement with recommendations supported by the College of American Pathologists, International Society of Urological Pathology, Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology, the New Zealand Society of Pathologists, and the Prostate Cancer Foundation.', 'Prostate Biopsy in Active Surveillance Protocols: Immediate Re-biopsy and Timing of Subsequent Biopsies.', 'Prospective Implementation and Early Outcomes of a Risk-stratified Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Follow-up Protocol.', 'Development and External Validation of the STRATified CANcer Surveillance (STRATCANS) Multivariable Model for Predicting Progression in Men with Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Starting Active Surveillance.', 'Developing machine learning algorithms for dynamic estimation of progression during active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'MRI-derived radiomics model for baseline prediction of prostate cancer progression on active surveillance.', 'Survey on the practice of active surveillance for prostate cancer from the Middle East.']"""

Here, we report that under hypoxia (1% O2), human prostate cancer (PCA) cells, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by these cells, are significantly enriched in triglycerides due to the activation of lipogenesis-related enzymes and signaling molecules. This is likely a survival response to hypoxic stress as accumulated lipids could support growth following reoxygenation. Consistent with this, significantly higher proliferation was observed in hypoxic PCA cells following reoxygenation associated with rapid use of accumulated lipids. Importantly, lipid utilization inhibition by CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir and shRNA-mediated CPT1-knockdown significantly compromised hypoxic PCA cell proliferation following reoxygenation. Furthermore, COX2 inhibitor celecoxib strongly reduced growth and invasiveness following hypoxic PCA cells reoxygenation, and inhibited invasiveness induced by hypoxic PCA EVs. This establishes a role for COX2 enzymatic products in the enhanced PCA growth and invasiveness.

Self-reported resource utilisation data were obtained via the electronic Patient-reported Outcomes from Cancer Survivors system and included community-based health and social care, medications, travel costs and informal care. Hospital costs were retrieved through data linkage. Multivariate regression analysis was used to examine cost predictors.  Results:   Overall, 298 patients were included in the analysis, including 136 breast cancer, 83 colorectal cancer and 79 prostate cancer patients. The average monthly societal cost was $ US 409 (95%CI: $ US 316-$ US 502) [mean: £ 260, 95%CI: £ 198-£ 322] and was incurred by 92% of patients.

However, the function and mechanism of Toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9) in prostate cancer is not totally understood. Here, we found that high expression of TLR9 was associated with a higher probability of lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Further in vitro functional study verified that silence of TLR9 inhibited migration and invasion of PC-3 cells, indicating expression of TLR9 involving in the migration and invasion of cancer cells. The data of microarray exhibited silence of TLR9 induced 205 genes with larger than 2-fold changes in expression levels, including 164 genes down-regulated and 41 genes up-regulated. Functional Gene Ontology (GO) processes annotation demonstrated that the top three scores of molecular and cellular functions were regulation of programmed cell death, regulation of locomotion and response to calcium ion.

Patients and methods:   In all, 681 men who underwent initial 12-core transrectal prostate biopsy at our institution were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into groups with low (<300 ng/dL) and normal testosterone levels (≥300 ng/dL). Clinical and pathological data were analysed.  Results:   Among 681 men, 86 men (12.6%) had low testosterone levels, 143 (32.7%) had a positive biopsy, and 99 (14.5%) had high-grade prostate cancer. The mean age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density, body mass index (BMI), number of abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, and diabetes mellitus (DM) history were significantly different between the low and normal level testosterone groups. A low testosterone level was significantly associated with a higher risk of detection of overall prostate cancer than a normal testosterone level in univariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] 2.545, P = 0.001), but not in multivariate analysis adjusting for parameters such as age, PSA, prostate volume, BMI, abnormal DRE findings and DM (OR 1.583, P = 0.277). Meanwhile, a low testosterone level was significantly related to a higher rate of high-grade prostate cancer compared with a normal testosterone level in univariate (OR 3.324, P < 0.001) and multivariate analysis adjusting for other parameters (OR 2.138, P = 0.035).  Conclusion:   Low testosterone level is an independent risk factor for high-grade prostate cancer detection at biopsy.

This study explored differential DNA methylation in a priori selected genes to diagnose PCa and predict clinical failure (CF) in high-risk patients.  Methods:   A quantitative multiplex, methylation-specific PCR assay was developed to assess promoter methylation of the APC, CCND2, GSTP1, PTGS2 and RARB genes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 42 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and radical prostatectomy specimens of patients with high-risk PCa, encompassing training and validation cohorts of 147 and 71 patients, respectively. Log-rank tests, univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to investigate the prognostic value of the DNA methylation.  Results:   Hypermethylation of APC, CCND2, GSTP1, PTGS2 and RARB was highly cancer-specific. However, only GSTP1 methylation was significantly associated with CF in both independent high-risk PCa cohorts. Importantly, trichotomization into low, moderate and high GSTP1 methylation level subgroups was highly predictive for CF. Patients with either a low or high GSTP1 methylation level, as compared to the moderate methylation groups, were at a higher risk for CF in both the training (Hazard ratio [HR], 3.65; 95% CI, 1.65 to 8.07) and validation sets (HR, 4.27; 95% CI, 1.03 to 17.72) as well as in the combined cohort (HR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.42 to 5.27) in multivariate analysis.

Experimental design:   Plasma samples from patients with known tumor mutations who completed at least two courses of investigational targeted therapy were collected monthly, until disease progression. NGS was performed sequentially on the Ion Torrent PGM platform.  Results:   cfDNA was extracted from 39 patients with various tumor types. Treatments administered targeted mainly the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (n = 28) or MEK (n = 7). Overall, 159 plasma samples were sequenced with a mean sequencing coverage achieved of 1,685X across experiments. At trial initiation (C1D1), 23 of 39 (59%) patients had at least one mutation identified in cfDNA (mean 2, range 1-5). Out of the 44 mutations identified at C1D1, TP53, PIK3CA and KRAS were the top 3 mutated genes identified, with 18 (41%), 9 (20%), 8 (18%) different mutations, respectively. Out of these 23 patients, 13 received a targeted drug matching their tumor profile. For the 23 patients with cfDNA mutation at C1D1, the monitoring of mutation allele frequency (AF) in consecutive plasma samples during treatment with targeted drugs demonstrated potential treatment associated clonal responses. Longitudinal monitoring of cfDNA samples with multiple mutations indicated the presence of separate clones behaving discordantly.

This article identifies 3 areas of breast cancer care where opportunity currently exists to refine management strategies and help decrease overtreatment and overdiagnosis: the use of adjuvant-external beam radiation in invasive breast cancer, the application of aggressive treatment for all ductal carcinoma in situ, and the authors' approach to breast cancer screening.

Currently, there are only a limited number of targeted therapies that act by increasing senescence in cancers, but the majority of them are not selective and also target healthy cells. Here we developed a chemogenomic screening to identify compounds that enhance senescence in PTEN-deficient cells without affecting normal cells. By using this approach, we identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a pro-senescent target. Mechanistically, we show that Pten loss increases CK2 levels by activating STAT3. CK2 upregulation in Pten null tumours affects the stability of Pml, an essential regulator of senescence. However, CK2 inhibition stabilizes Pml levels enhancing senescence in Pten null tumours. Taken together, our screening strategy has identified a novel STAT3-CK2-PML network that can be targeted for pro-senescence therapy for cancer.""","""['Madhuri Kalathur', 'Alberto Toso', 'Jingjing Chen', 'Ajinkya Revandkar', 'Claudia Danzer-Baltzer', 'Ilaria Guccini', 'Abdullah Alajati', 'Manuela Sarti', 'Sandra Pinton', 'Lara Brambilla', 'Diletta Di Mitri', 'Giuseppina Carbone', 'R Garcia-Escudero', 'Alessandro Padova', 'Letizia Magnoni', 'Alessia Tarditi', 'Laura Maccari', 'Federico Malusa', 'Ravi Kiran Reddy Kalathur', 'Lorenzo A Pinna', 'Giorgio Cozza', 'Maria Ruzzene', 'Nicolas Delaleu', 'Carlo V Catapano', 'Ian J Frew', 'Andrea Alimonti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""[]"""

Infertility is common in both males and females with APS1. Although female infertility can be explained by autoimmune ovarian failure, the mechanisms underlying male infertility have remained poorly understood. We performed a proteome-wide autoantibody screen in APS1 patient sera to assess the autoimmune response against the male reproductive organs. By screening human protein arrays with male and female patient sera and by selecting for gender-imbalanced autoantibody signals, we identified transglutaminase 4 (TGM4) as a male-specific autoantigen. Notably, TGM4 is a prostatic secretory molecule with critical role in male reproduction. TGM4 autoantibodies were detected in most of the adult male APS1 patients but were absent in all the young males. Consecutive serum samples further revealed that TGM4 autoantibodies first presented during pubertal age and subsequent to prostate maturation. We assessed the animal model for APS1, the Aire-deficient mouse, and found spontaneous development of TGM4 autoantibodies specifically in males. Aire-deficient mice failed to present TGM4 in the thymus, consistent with a defect in central tolerance for TGM4. In the mouse, we further link TGM4 immunity with a destructive prostatitis and compromised secretion of TGM4.

The Annals of Statistics 2006; 34(1):290Ű325, the treatment effect can be modeled as a flexible function of the biomarker. In this paper, we propose a bootstrap test method for survival outcome data based on the LPLE, for assessing whether the treatment effect is a constant among all patients or varies as a function of the biomarker. The test method is called local partial-likelihood bootstrap (LPLB) and is developed by bootstrapping the martingale residuals. The test statistic measures the amount of change in treatment effects across the entire range of the biomarker and is derived based on asymptotic theories for martingales. The LPLB method is nonparametric and is shown in simulations and data analysis examples to be flexible enough to identify treatment effects in a biomarker-defined subset and more powerful to detect treatment-biomarker interaction of complex forms than the Cox regression model with a simple interaction.

ZD55-SATB1 was constructed and used to infect human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP. The inhibitory effect of ZD55-SATB1 on SATB1 expression was evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. The cytotoxicity of ZD55-SATB1 was detected by MTT assay. Cell invasion was detected by Matrigel invasion assay. The in vivo antitumor activities of ZD55-SATB1 were evaluated in xenograft mouse model. We found that ZD55-SATB1 selectively replicated and significantly reduced SATB1 expression in DU145 and LNCaP cells.

Therefore, hmga1 gene is considered as an attractive potential target for anticancer drugs. We have chosen 27 bp DNA sequence from a regulatory region of hmga1 promoter and studied its interaction with adriamycin (ADM) and in vitro expression of HMGA1 in the presence of ADM in HeLa cell line. A variety of biophysical techniques were employed to understand the characteristics of [DNA-ADM] complex. Spectrophotometric titration data, DNA denaturation profiles, and quenching of fluorescence of ADM in the presence of DNA demonstrated a strong complexation between DNA and ADM with a high binding affinity (Ka) of 1.3 × 10(6) M(-1) and a stoichiometry of 1:3 (drug:nucleotide). The energetics of binding obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry suggest the binding to be exothermic and enthalpy (∆H, -6.7 ± 2.4 kcal M(-1)) and entropy (TΔS, 18.5 ± 6.4 kcal M(-1)) driven (20°C), which is typical of intercalative mode of binding. Further, results on decreased expression (by ~70%) of HMGA1 both at mRNA and protein levels in association with the observed cell death (by ~75%) in HeLa cell line, clearly confirm that ADM does target hmga1; however, the effect of ADM on genes other than hmga1 either directly or via hmga1-mediated pathways cannot be ruled out in the observed cytotoxicity. Therefore, hmga1 in general and particularly the regulatory region is a promising target for therapeutic strategy in combating cancer.""","""['Md Zahid Akhter', 'Kalpana Luthra', 'Moganty R Rajeswari']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biomol Struct Dyn""","""['Interaction of adriamycin with a promoter region of hmga1 and its inhibitory effect on HMGA1 expression in A431 human squamous carcinoma cell line.', 'Interaction of doxorubicin with a regulatory element of hmga1 and its in vitro anti-cancer activity associated with decreased HMGA1 expression.', 'Interaction of adriamycin with a regulatory element of hmgb1: spectroscopic and calorimetric approach.', 'RNA-Mediated Regulation of HMGA1 Function.', 'HMGA Genes and Proteins in Development and Evolution.', 'High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1): Structure, Biological Function, and Therapeutic Potential.', 'Mandatory role of HMGA1 in human airway epithelial normal differentiation and post-injury regeneration.']"""

We aimed to measure the global awareness of thrombosis to address this gap.  Methods:   With Ipsos-Reid, from 22 July to 5 August 2014, we surveyed 800 respondents in their native language from each of Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Thailand, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States to measure general awareness about thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). In each country, respondents were distributed among three age groups: 18-39 years, 40-64 years, and over 65 years of age. Proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.  Results:   Overall, the proportion of respondents that were aware of thrombosis, DVT and PE (68%, 44% and 54%, respectively) was lower than the proportion that was aware of other thrombotic disorders, such as heart attack and stroke (88% and 85%, respectively), and health conditions such as hypertension, breast cancer, prostate cancer and AIDS (90%, 85%, 82% and 87%, respectively). Although there was variation across countries, lower awareness was associated with younger age and being male. Only 45% (95% CI, 43.9-46.5) of respondents were aware that blood clots were preventable, and awareness of cancer, hospitalization and surgery as risk factors was low (16%, 25%, and 36%, respectively).  Conclusions:   On a global level, public awareness about thrombosis overall, and VTE in particular, is low.

Additionally, inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) by their inhibitors like Vorinostat (SAHA) has also proven a useful strategy in cancer therapy and the concomitant use of proteasome and HDAC inhibitors has been shown to be superior to either treatment alone. It has also been reported that delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) is a proteasome-associated protein, and may function as an endogenous proteasome inhibitor. While the role of ALAD in the heme biosynthetic pathway is well characterized, little is known about its interaction with, and the mechanism by which it inhibits, the proteasome. In the present study, this ALAD-proteasome complex was further characterized in cultured prostate cancer cells and the effects of SAHA treatment on the regulation of ALAD were investigated. ALAD interacts with the 20S proteasomal core, but not the 19S regulatory cap. Some ubiquitinated species were detected in ALAD immunoprecipitates that have similar molecular weights to ubiquitinated proteasomal α2 subunits, suggesting preferred binding of ALAD to ubiquitinated α2. Additionally, SAHA treatment increases levels of ALAD protein and an acetylated protein with a molecular weight similar to the ubiquitinated α2 subunit. Thus, the results of this study suggest that ALAD may play a regulatory role in a previously unreported post-translational modification of proteasomal α subunits.""","""['Sara M Schmitt', 'Christine Neslund-Dudas', 'Min Shen', 'Cindy Cui', 'Bharati Mitra', 'Q Ping Dou']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Delta-aminolevulinic dehydratase is a proteasome interacting protein.', 'Regulation of acetylation restores proteolytic function of diseased myocardium in mouse and human.', 'Phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the 26S proteasome complex.', '240-kDa proteasome inhibitor (CF-2) is identical to delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase.', 'Regulation of cardiac proteasomes by ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and beyond.', 'Itraconazole Confers Cytoprotection Against Neurodegenerative Disease-Associated Abnormal Protein Aggregation.', 'Selective microautophagy of proteasomes is initiated by ESCRT-0 and is promoted by proteasome ubiquitylation.', ""Expanding the role of proteasome homeostasis in Parkinson's disease: beyond protein breakdown."", 'Proteasome Biology: Chemistry and Bioengineering Insights.', 'Post-Translational Modifications of Extracellular Proteasome.']"""

The limited survival benefit associated with the quick emergence of resistance and systemic toxicity diminished its efficacy. JNK-mediated apoptosis is one of the mechanisms of docetaxel activity whereas ERK1/2-c-Myc-CXCR4 signaling is implicated in the development of resistance and induction of migration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that the combination treatment with docetaxel and GLIPR1-ΔTM will synergistically induce greater cell death and inhibit the emergence of resistance and development of metastatic potential in prostate cancer (PCa) cells.  Methods:   The synergistic effects of the docetaxel and GLIPR1-ΔTM were evaluated with DNA fragmentation, DAPI staining and MTS using paired t-test and isobologram study. The effects of the drugs on JNK and ERK1/2-c-Myc-CXCR4 signaling were evaluated with Western blot, DNA fragmentation, and MTS assays using the JNK inhibitor SP600125, and CXCR4 siRNA. The results of docetaxel and GLIPR1-ΔTM combination on migration were examined with scratch assay using the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 while our hypothesis was examined in vivo using VCaP orthotopic xenograft model.  Results:   We found that GLIPR1-ΔΤΜ synergized with docetaxel to induce apoptosis in VCaP and PC-3 PCa cells through induction of JNK signaling and concomitant inhibition of ERK1/2-c-Myc-CXCR4 signaling. We showed that JNK activation mediates the apoptotic effects of the drug combination and that CXCR4 knockdown increases its efficacy. We also found that the addition of GLIPR1-ΔΤΜ to docetaxel decreases the migration of VCaP and PC-3 cells. The combination treatment with docetaxel and GLIPR1-ΔTM inhibited tumor growth and decreased metastatic potential in VCaP xenografts more than single agents did.  Conclusions:   Our data suggested that addition of GLIPR1-ΔTM treatment in PCa cells increases the efficacy of docetaxel and may inhibit the emergence of drug resistance; potentially permitting a decrease of docetaxel dose for patients with mCRPC eliminating its systemic toxicities.""","""['Styliani Karanika', 'Theodoros Karantanos', 'Shinji Kurosaka', 'Jianxiang Wang', 'Takahiro Hirayama', 'Guang Yang', 'Sanghee Park', 'Alexei A Golstov', 'Ryuta Tanimoto', 'Likun Li', 'Timothy C Thompson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Systemic GLIPR1-ΔTM protein as a novel therapeutic approach for prostate cancer.', 'Residual prostate cancer cells after docetaxel therapy increase the tumorigenic potential via constitutive signaling of CXCR4, ERK1/2 and c-Myc.', 'Anti-cancer efficacy of SREBP inhibitor, alone or in combination with docetaxel, in prostate cancer harboring p53 mutations.', 'Preclinical profile of cabazitaxel.', 'Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1: tumor-suppressor activities and therapeutic potential.', 'Synergistic effects and mechanisms of impressic acid or acankoreanogein in combination with docetaxel on prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the Intrinsic Apoptosis Pathway: A Window of Opportunity for Prostate Cancer.', 'Dual-specificity phosphatases: therapeutic targets in cancer therapy resistance.', 'Key genes and drug delivery systems to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy.', 'Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 performs dual functions in tumor cells.']"""

Material and methods:   Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1 May to 31 December 1997 and living in eight Danish counties were identified through the DCR. Clinical data was retrieved from hospital records where date of diagnosis, stage at diagnosis and treatment received were registered.  Results:   The mean age at diagnosis was 74.6 years (s.d. 8.6 years). Diagnosis was verified histologically for 87% of cases. Overall 95% of the patients had a difference less than three months between the reported date of diagnosis and the date found in hospital records. Correction of dates of diagnosis had no impact on survival. Hospital records identified 86 patients with T1-2 disease without distant metastases (M0), but only 56 of these patients (65%) were reported to the DCR as having localized disease. According to hospital records a total of 242 patients were confirmed having distant metastases (M1) at diagnosis but only 139 of these cases (57%) were reported to the DCR as such. Considerable ""over reporting"" of curative treatment was observed.  Conclusion:   The DCR has been shown to be reliable in terms of new cases being reported. For the majority of cases there were insignificant differences concerning the date of diagnosis. However, the DCR information on stage and treatment was found to be inaccurate.

Samples (5-10 g) were obtained from the abdominal and leg muscles of 36 patients (age, 17-79 years) undergoing prostate cancer treatment or leg amputation surgery. All patients gave informed consent.

Both cell fractions were appropriately expanded using conditioned culture medium for about 2 weeks. Differentiation potentials were then examined during cell culture and in vivo transplantation into the severely damaged muscles of athymic nude mice and rats. Interestingly, these two cell fractions could be divided into highly myogenic (Sk-DN/29(+)) and multipotent stem cell (Sk-34) fractions, in contrast to mouse Sk-Cs, which showed comparable capacities in both cells. At 6 weeks after the separate transplantation of both cell fractions, the former showed an active contribution to muscle fiber regeneration, but the latter showed vigorous engraftment to the interstitium associated with differentiation into Schwann cells, perineurial/endoneurial cells, and vascular endothelial cells and pericytes, which corresponded to previous observations with mouse SK-Cs. Importantly, mixed cultures of both cells resulted the reduction of tissue reconstitution capacities in vivo, whereas co-transplantation after separate expansion showed favorable results.

SRC-1 has been shown to play an important role in the progression of breast cancer and prostate cancer. However, its role in liver cancer progression remains unknown. In this study, we report that SRC-1 was overexpressed in 25 (62.5%) of 40 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. Down-regulation of SRC-1 decreased HCC cell proliferation and impaired tumor maintenance in HCC xenografts. Knockdown of SRC-1 reduced protein levels of the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the oncogene c-Myc. Knockout of SRC-1 in mice reduced diethylnitrosamine/CCl4-induced tumor formation in the liver and the expression of c-Myc and PCNA in liver tumors. SRC-1 promoted c-Myc expression, at least in part, by directly interacting with β-catenin to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Consistent with these results, the expression of SRC-1 was positively correlated with PCNA expression in human HCC specimens, and the expression levels of c-Myc in SRC-1-positive HCC specimens were higher than in SRC-1-negative HCC specimens.

Ramucirumab is a recombinant HuMAb that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. A non-comparative randomised phase II study evaluated cixutumumab or ramucirumab plus mitoxantrone and prednisone (MP) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Patients and methods:   Men with progressive mCRPC during or after docetaxel therapy received mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) on day 1 and prednisone 5mg twice daily and were randomised 1:1 to receive either cixutumumab or ramucirumab 6 mg/kg intravenously weekly in a 21-day cycle. Primary end-point was composite progression-free survival (cPFS). Secondary end-points included safety, response, radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Sample size was based on a 50% increase in median cPFS from 2.6 (MP) to 3.9 months (either combination).  Results:   132 men were treated (66 per arm). Median cPFS was 4.1 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.2-5.6) for cixutumumab and 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.5-8.3) for ramucirumab. Median time to radiographic progression was 7.5 months for cixutumumab and 10.2 months for ramucirumab, with a median OS of 10.8 and 13.0 months, respectively. Fatigue was the most frequent adverse event (AE). Incidence of most non-haematologic grade 3-4 AEs was <10% on both arms. Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction occurred in 7.6% of patients on ramucirumab.  Conclusion:   Combinations of cixutumumab or ramucirumab plus MP were feasible and associated with moderate toxicities in docetaxel-pretreated men with mCRPC.

The factors involved in the pathogenesis of mucinous carcinomas remain unknown; which is likely one contributor to the current dearth of biomarkers for detection. Because zinc changes are implicated in some cancers e.g., prostate; we assessed the possibility of a similar role in mucinous carcinomas.  Methods:   The goal of the current work is to study the expression of hZip1 by immunohistochemistry in mucinous carcinomas as compared with non-neoplastic epithelia and conventional carcinomas. Tissue microarray slides containing mucinous carcinomas of the ovary (n = 35), colon (n = 51), stomach (n = 32) and lung (n = 21) were used.  Results:   hZip1 showed persistent low expression in mucinous compared to ovarian serous carcinomas and normal tissue (P < 0.05), colonic adenocarcinoma and normal mucosa (P < 0.001), and gastric adenocarcinoma and normal epithelium (P < 0.05). hZip1 also showed low expression in pulmonary mucinous carcinomas.

However, the detailed mechanisms remain largely undiscovered. In the present study, we explored the regulation of the androgen receptor (AR) by capsaicin and further researched the mechanisms of their interaction in AR-positive prostate cancer cells. In the present study, cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Cell cycle distribution was determined using flow cytometry. Expression levels of cyclin D1, miR-449a, AR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot analysis. To further confirm the relationship among miR-449a, AR and prostate cancer proliferation, miR-449a was overexpressed by a lentivirus in prostate cancer cells. We discovered that capsaicin prevented tumor proliferation and cell cycle progression through inactivation and degradation of AR. We also found that restoration of miR-449a induced by capsaicin treatment resulted in the inhibition of AR signaling. Finally, we demonstrated that increased expression of miR-449a sensitized prostate cancer to capsaicin treatment. Finally, our experimental results indicated that capsaicin negatively modulates the activity of AR at the mRNA and protein levels by restoring miR-449a profiling in prostate cancer. In addition, increased expression of miR-449a may facilitate the sensitivity of prostate cancer to capsaicin treatment.

Morphological alterations were observed using transmission electron microscopy. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Notch1, Jagged1, VEGF and bFGF were detected using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. Laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) immunofluorescence analysis was performed to detect the levels of expression and the sub‑cellular localization of the Notch1 receptor protein. Growth of the PC3 cells was inhibited by emodin. Flow cytometry demonstrated that emodin induced apoptosis in the PC3 cells and arrested the cell cycle of the PC3 cells at the G2/M phase. The mRNA and protein expression of Notch1 in the PC3 cells was markedly increased, whereas the mRNA and protein expression levels of Jagged1, VEGF and bFGF were significantly decreased following exposure to emodin for 24 h. The LSCM assay revealed that the Notch1 was not only localized in the membrane and cytoplasm, but was also present in the nucleolus of the PC3 cells, and the expression of Notch1 in the nuclei gradually increased following treatment with emodin. These results demonstrated that emodin suppressed the growth of androgen‑independent prostate cancer cell lines and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The Notch signaling pathway was activated in the PC3 cells following exposure to emodin, which suggested that the Notch signaling pathway is involved in the prostate tumor‑suppressing mechanisms of emodin, the activation of which may depend on CBF1 protein in the nucleus by classic pathways.

Experimental design:   qRT-PCR was performed to detect miR-195 expression in both prostate cancer cell lines and clinical tissue samples. Its clinical significance was statistically analyzed. The roles of miR-195 and its candidate target gene, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70 kDa, polypeptide 1 (RPS6KB1) in prostate cancer progression were confirmed on the basis of both in vitro and in vivo systems.  Results:   miR-195 downregulation in prostate cancer tissues was significantly associated with high Gleason score (P = 0.001), positive metastasis failure (P < 0.001), and biochemical recurrence (BCR, P < 0.001). Survival analysis identified miR-195 as an independent prognostic factor for BCR-free survival of prostate cancer patients (P = 0.022). Then, we confirmed the tumor suppressive role of miR-195 through prostate cancer cell invasion, migration, and apoptosis assays in vitro, along with tumor xenograft growth, angiogenesis, and invasion in vivo according to both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. In addition, RPS6KB1 was identified as a novel direct target of miR-195 through proteomic expression profiling combined with bioinformatic target prediction and luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, the reexpression and knockdown of RPS6KB1 could respectively rescue and imitate the effects induced by miR-195.

Image segmentation may be difficult in some regions due to either poor contrast, low slice resolution, or tissue ambiguities. To address this, we present a novel non-rigid surface registration method designed to register two partial surfaces, capable of ignoring regions where the anatomical boundary is unclear. Our probabilistic approach incorporates prior geometric information in the form of a statistical shape model (SSM), and physical knowledge in the form of a finite element model (FEM). We validate results in the context of prostate interventions by registering pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to 3D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). We show that both the geometric and physical priors significantly decrease net target registration error (TRE), leading to TREs of 2.35 ± 0.81 mm and 2.81 ± 0.66 mm when applied to full and partial surfaces, respectively. We investigate robustness in response to errors in segmentation, varying levels of missing data, and adjusting the tunable parameters.

In the present study, we analyzed the LPXN-mediated adhesive and cytoskeletal changes during PCa progression. We identified an interaction between the actin-binding protein caldesmon (CaD) and LPXN and this interaction is increased during PCa cell migration. Furthermore, knockdown of LPXN did not affect CaD expression but reduced CaD phosphorylation. This is known to destabilize the affinity of CaD to F-actin, leading to dynamic cell structures that enable cell motility. Thus, downregulation of CaD increased migration and invasion of PCa cells. To identify the kinase responsible for the LPXN-mediated phosphorylation of CaD, we used data from an antibody array, which showed decreased expression of TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) after LPXN knockdown in PC-3 PCa cells. Subsequent analyses of the downstream kinases revealed the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as an interaction partner of LPXN that facilitates CaD phosphorylation during LPXN-mediated PCa cell migration.

Methods:   We described and modelled the effect of ethnicity, time, age and deprivation on survival for the five most incident cancers in each sex in South Asians in England between 1986 and 2004 using national cancer registry data. South Asian ethnicity was flagged using the validated name-recognition algorithm SANGRA (South Asian Names and Group Recognition Algorithm).  Results:   We observed survival advantage in South Asians in earlier periods. This ethnic gap either remained constant or narrowed over time. By 2004, age-standardised net survival was comparable for all cancers except three in men, where South Asians had higher survival 5 years after diagnosis: colorectal (58.9% vs 53.6%), liver (15.0% vs 9.4%) and lung (15.9% vs 9.3%). Compared with non-South Asians, South Asians experienced a slower increase in breast and prostate cancer survival, both cancers associated with either a screening programme or an early diagnosis test.

Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative parameters were measured.  Results:   Of 112 consecutive patients, 62 patients underwent vesicourethral anastomosis by use of the running technique, whereas 50 patients underwent anastomosis with the interrupted technique. The groups did not differ significantly in age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, or pathologic findings. The intraoperative extravasation rate was significantly lower in the running group (8.1% vs. 24.0%, p=0.01).

Materials and methods:   A total of 280 prostate biopsy sections from a homogeneous series of 70 patients with low-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score 3+3, prostate-specific antigen [PSA]<10 ng/mL, and clinical stage T1c) who underwent systematic biopsy sampling and subsequent radical prostatectomy were analyzed. For each biopsy, 2-µm sections were treated with CD34 antibodies and were digitized by using an image analysis system that automatically estimates the surface fractal dimension.  Results:   Our results showed that biopsy sections without cancer were significantly more vascularized than were tumors. No correlations were found between the vascular surface fractal dimension and patient's age, PSA and free-to-total PSA ratios, pathological stage, Gleason score, tumor volume, vascular invasion, capsular penetration, surgical margins, and biochemical recurrence.

The primary and secondary endpoints were safety and immune responses, respectively. Overall survival (OS), followed as a part of the safety evaluation, was compared to the predicted OS according to the Halabi and MSKCC nomograms.  Experimental design:   Twenty-five patients with progressive mCRPC were enrolled. Treatment comprised of initial 7 days administration of metronomic cyclophosphamide 50 mg p.o. DCVAC/PCa treatment consisted of a median twelve doses of 1 × 107 dendritic cells per dose injected s.c. (Aldara creme was applied at the site of injection) during a one-year period. The initial 2 doses of DCVAC/PCa were administered at a 2-week interval, followed by the administration of docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and prednisone (5 mg twice daily) given every 3 weeks until toxicity or intolerance was observed. The DCVAC/PCa was then injected every 6 weeks up to the maximum number of doses manufactured from one leukapheresis.  Results:   No serious DCVAC/PCa-related adverse events have been reported. The median OS was 19 months, whereas the predicted median OS was 11.8 months with the Halabi nomogram and 13 months with the MSKCC nomogram. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that patients had a lower risk of death compared with both MSKCC (Hazard Ratio 0.26, 95% CI: 0.13-0.51) and Halabi (Hazard Ratio 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17-0.63) predictions. We observed a significant decrease in Tregs in the peripheral blood. The long-term administration of DCVAC/PCa led to the induction and maintenance of PSA specific T cells. We did not identify any immunological parameter that significantly correlated with better OS.  Conclusions:   In patients with mCRPC, the combined chemoimmunotherapy with DCVAC/PCa and docetaxel was safe and resulted in longer than expected survival.

We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of 3 versus 2 days per week of RT in prostate cancer survivors diagnosed within the past 2 years.  Methods:   Prostate cancer survivors (N=30) were randomized to 12 weeks of supervised RT performed either 3 days per week (n=16) or 2 days per week (n=14). The primary outcome was muscular strength assessed by a multiple repetition maximum test at baseline and postintervention. Secondary outcomes were objective physical functioning, quality of life and psychosocial functioning.  Results:   A trend (P<0.10) and/or potentially meaningful effects (standardized effect size d⩾0.20) were found favoring 3 days per week over 2 days per week for the primary outcome of lower body strength (mean difference=27.8 kg; 95% confidence interval=-0.9 to 56.5; P=0.057; d=0.72) and for the secondary outcomes of 30-s chair stand (d=0.29; P=0.31), sit and reach (d=0.24; P=0.33), 6 -min walk (d=0.21; P=0.42) and the physical component summary (d=0.21; P=0.41). Conversely, a trend and/or potentially meaningful effects were found favoring 2 days per week over 3 days per week for the mental component summary (d=-0.38; P=0.10), mental health (d=-0.44; P=0.11), vitality (d=-0.31; P=0.28), role-emotional (d=-0.23; P=0.43), anxiety (d=0.32; P=0.29), happiness (d=-0.31; P=0.36) and perceived stress (d=0.23; P=0.39).  Conclusions:   This pilot randomized dose-comparison trial provides preliminary data to suggest that RT 3 days per week compared with 2 days per week may improve the strength and physical functioning in prostate cancer survivors, but may also blunt improvements in psychosocial functioning.

Methods:   Seven hundred and fifty-five consecutive patients underwent prebiopsy 3 T mpMRI and transperineal biopsy between October 2012 and September 2014. MRI images were analyzed using PIRADS (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System). All patients had systematic biopsies (SBs, median n=24) as reference test and targeted biopsies (TBs) with rigid software registration in case of MRI-suspicious lesions. Detection rates of SBs and TBs were assessed for all PC and sPC patients defined by Gleason score (GS)⩾3+4 and GS⩾4+3. For PC, which were not concordantly detected by TBs and SBs, prostatectomy specimens were assessed. We further compared bpMRI with mpMRI.  Results:   One hundred and ninety-one patients harbored 194 lesions in AFMS and TZ on mpMRI. Patient-based analysis detected no difference in the detection of all PC for SBs vs TBs in the overall cohort, but in the repeat-biopsy population TBs performed significantly better compared with SBs (P=0.004 for GS⩾3+4 and P=0.022 for GS⩾4+3, respectively). Nine GS⩾4+3 sPCs were overlooked by SBs, whereas TBs missed two sPC in men undergoing primary biopsy. The combination of SBs and TBs provided optimal local staging. Non-inferiority analysis showed no relevant difference of bpMRI to mpMRI in sPC detection.

This case-control study nested within the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) examined the association between inherited genetic variation in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene and obesity-related cancer risk.  Methods:   The study sample consisted of 1,475 controls and 396 cases from the second familial generation of the FHS. Participants who provided consent were genotyped. Nineteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the INSR gene were investigated in relation to risk of obesity-related cancers combined and breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. Generalized estimation equation models controlling for familial correlations and include age, sex, smoking and body mass index as covariates, assuming additive models, were used.  Results:   Three SNPs, rs2059807, s8109559 and rs919275, were significantly associated with obesity-related cancers (p value < 0.02) with the most significantly associated SNP being rs2059807 (p value = 0.008). Carriers of two copies of SNP rs2059807 risk allele T were significantly less prevalent among subjects with obesity-related cancers [f(TT)cases = 14 vs. f(TT)controls = 18 %; OR 1.23]. In exploratory analyses evaluating site-specific cancers, the INSR rs2059807 association with these cancers was consistent with that observed for the main outcome (ORs colorectal cancer = 1.5, breast cancer = 1.29, prostate = 1.06). There was no statistically significant interaction between the INSR-SNP and blood glucose in relation to obesity-related cancer.  Conclusions:   The INSR gene is implicated in obesity-related cancer risk, as 3 of 19 SNPs were nominally associated, after false discovery rate (FDR) correction, with the main outcome. Risk allele homozygotes (rs2059807) were less prevalent among subjects with obesity-related cancer.

The relationship between BPH and endogenous total testosterone (TT) levels has been widely studied. The aim of this post hoc analysis was to determine the association between LUTS and endogenous TT levels in a subset of men participating in the 2013 Prostate Cancer Awareness Week, a U.S. community-based prostate cancer screening program. Men completed the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) questionnaire, prostate size was estimated by a digital rectal examination, and serum TT and prostate-specific antigen levels were measured. Mean TT levels (ng/dl) did not significantly correlate with prostate size category (r = +.03, p = .69): normal, 419.2 (n = 106); enlarged, 394.7 (n = 71); abnormal, 416.4 (n = 7); and abnormal/suspicious, 515.2 (n = 19). Mean TT levels (ng/dl) did not significantly correlate with I-PSS category (r = -.06, p = .40): none, 468.5 (n = 15); mild, 414.0 (n = 138); moderate, 397.4 (n = 66); and severe, 437.9 (n = 7). Mean TT levels (ng/dl) did not significantly correlate with I-PSS quality of life rating (r = -.13, p = .055): delighted, 474.5 (n = 43); pleased, 424.6 (n = 65); mostly satisfied, 361.2 (n = 63); mixed, 448.2 (n = 29); mostly dissatisfied, 337.2 (n = 17); and unhappy, 435.8 (n = 6). Adjustment for prostate size or prostate-specific antigen levels yielded similar findings. In conclusion, endogenous TT levels did not correlate with LUTS or prostate size, and these findings support the saturation theory in which TT is not able to induce further androgen-stimulated prostate tissue growth due to receptor saturation. Any worsening of LUTS following testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men may be related to stimulation of prostatic cells previously deprived of testosterone.""","""['E David Crawford', 'Wendy Poage', 'Allen Nyhuis', 'David A Price', 'Sherie A Dowsett', 'David Muram']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['Relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms and total serum testosterone level in healthy middle-aged eugonadal men.', 'Obesity may influence the relationship between sex hormones and lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'Testosterone supplementation does not worsen lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'Testosterone and the Prostate: Artifacts and Truths.', 'Definition of at-risk patients: dynamic variables.', 'A Proposal of a New Nomogram to Predict the Need for Testosterone ReplACEment (TRACE): A Simple Tool for Everyday Clinical Practice.', 'Hypogonadism and urologic surgeries: a narrative review.', 'Factors Associated with Bothersome Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Middle-Aged Men Receiving Health Checkup.', 'Impact of Testosterone Deficiency and Testosterone Therapy on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Men with Metabolic Syndrome.', 'Prostate cancer: Testosterone therapy for hypogonadal men with prostate cancer.']"""

No prior study has comprehensively evaluated the effect of HIV on cancer-specific mortality.  Patients and methods:   We identified cases of 14 common cancers occurring from 1996 to 2010 in six US states participating in a linkage of cancer and HIV/AIDS registries. We used Cox regression to examine the association between patient HIV status and death resulting from the presenting cancer (ascertained from death certificates), adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, year of cancer diagnosis, and cancer stage. We included 1,816,461 patients with cancer, 6,459 (0.36%) of whom were HIV infected.  Results:   Cancer-specific mortality was significantly elevated in HIV-infected compared with HIV-uninfected patients for many cancers: colorectum (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.84), pancreas (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.18), larynx (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.47), lung (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.39), melanoma (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.70), breast (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 2.06 to 3.31), and prostate (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.41). HIV was not associated with increased cancer-specific mortality for anal cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. After further adjustment for cancer treatment, HIV remained associated with elevated cancer-specific mortality for common non-AIDS-defining cancers: colorectum (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.80), lung (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.44), melanoma (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.14 to 3.27), and breast (HR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.86 to 3.73).  Conclusion:   HIV-infected patients with cancer experienced higher cancer-specific mortality than HIV-uninfected patients, independent of cancer stage or receipt of cancer treatment.

In this observational study, we assess the impact of prostate removal on preoperative and postoperative PFRs after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Patients and methods:   A single surgeon (TA) performed RARPs between 2002 and 2007. Men underwent routine preoperative uroflowmetric testing: 550 qualified for analysis with a sufficient voided volume (VV) of 150 mL preoperatively and at least once postoperatively. Continence and self-assessed American Urological Association (AUA) symptom and urinary quality of life (QoL) questionnaires were queried. Uroflows were analyzed preoperatively, short-term (3-15 mos), long-term (>2 y), and by age decades, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) groups, and pathologic weight cohorts.  Results:   AUA and QoL scores improved from 8.1 and 1.6 at baseline to 4.4 and 1.0 at intermediate-term follow-up, P<0.01. Mean PFRs improved from a baseline 18.0 mL/s to 28.3, 30.8, and 36.5 at 3 months, 9 months, and >5 years follow- up (all P<0.001). Postvoid residual (PVR) volumes declined from 99 mL preoperatively to 24 mL at >5 years (P<0.01). Likewise, all age, LUTS, and prostate weight cohorts had significant improvements in PFR and PVR and stable voided volumes throughout the study.  Conclusion:   The natural history of prostatic obstruction for men 40 to 80 years typically reveals reduction of mean PFRs. We observed that removal of the prostate resulted on average with a near doubling of PFRs and decreased PVRs (>50%) by 3 months. After RARP, the average PFR was reset to 25-30 mL/s, and these results were seen across all age, LUTS, and prostate weight groups; the gains remained stable 2 to 4 years after operation.""","""['Douglas Skarecky', 'Adam Gordon', 'Kara N Babaian', 'Harleen Dhaliwal', 'Blanca Morales', 'Thomas E Ahlering']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Quantification of Long-term Stability and Specific Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Improved lower urinary tract symptoms after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: implications for survivorship, treatment selection and patient counselling.', 'Long-term outcomes in severe lower urinary tract symptoms in men undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'The association between the parameters of uroflowmetry and lower urinary tract symptoms in prostate cancer patients after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The Effect of the Vesical Adaptation Response to Diuresis on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms after Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: A Pilot Proof of Concept Study.', 'Quantification of Long-term Stability and Specific Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

This study tested a new instrument to measure cancer survivors' sexual health concerns and needs for sexual information after cancer treatment. The Information on Sexual Health: Your Needs after Cancer (InSYNC), developed by a multidisciplinary team of experts, is a novel 12-item questionnaire to measure sexual health concerns and information needs of cancer survivors. We tested the measure with a sample of breast and prostate cancer survivors. A convenience sample of 114 cancer survivors (58 breast, 56 prostate) was enrolled. Results of the InSYNC questionnaire showed high levels of sexual concern among cancer survivors. Areas of concern differed by cancer type. Prostate cancer survivors were most concerned about being able to satisfy their partners (57 %) while breast cancer survivors were most concerned with changes in how their bodies worked sexually (46 %). Approximately 35 % of all cancer survivors wanted more information about sexual health. Sexual health concerns and unmet information needs are common among breast and prostate cancer survivors, varying in some aspects by type of cancer. Routine screening for sexual health concerns should be included in comprehensive cancer survivorship care to appropriately address health care needs. The InSYNC questionnaire is one tool that may help clinicians identify concerns facing their patients.""","""['Sheila A Crowley', 'Sallie M Foley', 'Daniela Wittmann', 'Christina H Jagielski', 'Rodney L Dunn', 'Patricia M Clark', 'Jennifer J Griggs', 'Catherine Peterson', 'Marcia Leonard', 'Lawrence C An', 'John T Wei', 'James E Montie', 'Nancy K Janz']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Unmet needs in breast cancer survivors are common, and multidisciplinary care is underutilised: the Survivorship Needs Assessment Project.', ""Talking about sexual health during survivorship: understanding what shapes breast cancer survivors' willingness to communicate with providers."", 'Evaluation of Factors Associated With Unmet Needs in Adult Cancer Survivors in Canada.', 'Sexual Health Recovery For Prostate Cancer Survivors: The Proposed Role Of Acceptance And Mindfulness-Based Interventions.', 'Coping Strategies Used by Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A Literature Review.', '""How to start that conversation?"": Experiences of developing a virtual simulation about sexual health care for breast cancer survivors.', '« Comment en parler? »: Création d’une simulation virtuelle sur les soins de santé sexuelle destinés aux survivantes du cancer du sein.', 'Social relationships and relational pain in brain tumor patients and their partners.', ""Predictors of prostate cancer survivors' engagement in self-management behaviors."", 'Patient-reported outcome measurement implementation in cancer survivors: a systematic review.']"""

However, to date there are no reliable biomarkers that categorize those SCC patients that will progress to metastasis. Nuclear active IKKα diminishes Maspin levels in prostate cancer facilitating its metastatic potential. In this paper, we describe the immunohistochemical analysis of active IKK and Maspin in 56 metastasizing and 51 non-metastasizing primary cSCC to measure their association with cancer behaviour. We also determined the effect of inhibiting IKK activity in SCC cell growth and migration in vitro. We found that high levels of nuclear active IKK in the primary tumour are predictive of cSCC metastatic capacity, in particular when combined with poor tumour differentiation and a history of tumour recurrence. Active IKK inversely correlated with Maspin levels in cSCC tumours, and samples negative for Maspin are exclusively found in the metastatic group. Mechanistically, IKK activity regulates cellular motility and SCC cell survival. Our results indicate that nuclear active IKK is a robust biomarker to predict cSCC outcome, and suggest the possibility of targeting IKK activity as a future therapy for treating metastatic cSCC.""","""['Agusti Toll', 'Pol Margalef', 'Emili Masferrer', 'Carla Ferrándiz-Pulido', 'Javier Gimeno', 'Ramon Maria Pujol', 'Anna Bigas', 'Lluis Espinosa']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Arch Dermatol Res""","""['Nuclear cytokine-activated IKKalpha controls prostate cancer metastasis by repressing Maspin.', 'IKKα inibition by a glucosamine derivative enhances Maspin expression in osteosarcoma cell line.', 'Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Review of High-Risk and Metastatic Disease.', 'Biomarker and Pathologic Predictors of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Aggressiveness.', 'Diagnosis and treatment of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin: European consensus-based interdisciplinary guideline.', 'Management of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer: Radiologists Challenging and Risk Assessment.', 'Cornulin as a Potential Novel Biomarker for Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'A tEMTing target?

Methods:   Laboratory abnormalities and adverse events of hypocalcaemia in patients with metastatic bone disease were analysed using data from three identically designed phase 3 trials of subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg (n = 2841) versus intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg (n = 2836).  Results:   The overall incidence of laboratory events of hypocalcaemia grade ⩾ 2 was higher with denosumab (12.4%) than with zoledronic acid (5.3%). Hypocalcaemia events were primarily grade 2 in severity and usually occurred within the first 6 months of treatment. Patients who reported taking calcium and/or vitamin D supplements had a lower incidence of hypocalcaemia. Prostate cancer or small-cell lung cancer, reduced creatinine clearance and higher baseline bone turnover markers of urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen (uNTx; > 50 versus ⩽ 50 nmol/mmol) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP; > 20.77 μg/L [median] versus ⩽ 20.77 μg/L) values were important risk factors for developing hypocalcaemia. The risk associated with increased baseline BSAP levels was greater among patients who had > 2 bone metastases at baseline versus those with ⩽ 2 bone metastases at baseline.  Conclusion:   Hypocalcaemia was more frequent with denosumab versus zoledronic acid, consistent with denosumab's greater antiresorptive effect. Low serum calcium levels and potential vitamin D deficiency should be corrected before initiating treatment with a potent osteoclast inhibitor, and corrected serum calcium levels should be monitored during treatment.

Methods:   Consecutive patients on AS, who had targeted biopsy-proven lesion followed by at least a repeat surveillance biopsy and three times TRUS monitoring of the identical visible lesion, were included. Doppler grade of blood flow signal within the lesion was classified from grade 0 to 3. Biopsy-proven progression was defined as upgrade of Gleason score or 25% or greater increase in cancer core involvement.  Results:   Fifty patients were included in this study.

ES frequently causes distant metastases, particularly in the lung and bone, which worsens patient prognosis. Cadherin-11 (Cad-11) is an adhesion molecule that is highly expressed in osteoblasts. Its expression is associated with bone metastases in prostate and breast cancer patients, and is known to occur in ES. Here we investigated the effects of Cad-11 on bone metastases of ES. Human ES cell lines RD-ES, SK-ES-1, SK-N-MC, and TC-71 cells were transduced with lentivirus containing Cad-11 shRNA or control shRNA (ES/Cad-11 and ES/Ctr). RD-ES and TC-71 were infected with a lentivirus luciferase vector. Adhesion assays were performed using these cells and recombinant Cad-11-Fc chimera or mouse osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1. Cell motility was investigated via wound-healing assay. Intracardiac injection of RD-ES/Cad-11 and RD-ES/Ctr was used to create a mouse model of experimental bone metastasis. The association between Cad-11 expression and bone metastases and clinical prognosis in ES patients was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We found knockdown of Cad-11 in ES cells resulted in reduced attachment ability and cell motility. In a mouse model of metastasis, RD-ES/Cad-11 cells caused fewer metastases than RD-ES/Ctr cells. The expression of Cad-11 in ES patients was significantly related to bone metastases (P < 0.05, logistic regression) and poorer overall survival (P < 0.05, log-rank test).

We conducted a single institution phase-II open-labeled randomized study to assess the safety, tolerability, and early efficacy of docetaxel chemotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) vs. ADT alone for patients with advanced non-castration-resistant PCa with sequential prostatic biopsies.  Patients and methods:   We randomized 30 patients with newly diagnosed high-grade locally advanced or metastatic (cT3-4/N0-1/M0-1) PCa to receive ADT with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) docetaxel. Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsies were taken at randomization and ~22 weeks after treatment initiation. Primary end point: biochemical response rate. Secondary end points: time to progression and tumor profiling.  Results:   Both treatments appear to be well tolerated, and there was no difference in mean nadir prostate-specific antigen and time to prostate-specific antigen relapse between treatment arms (P>0.05). No adverse effects of pre- and post-treatment prostatic biopsies were observed. The study was neither designed nor sufficiently powered to demonstrate statistically significant differences in oncological outcomes or safety profiles between the 2 treatment arms.  Conclusions:   Despite the lack of statistical power, our study suggests that docetaxel and ADT in combination may be well tolerated with apparently similar short-term efficacy compared with ADT alone for high-grade locally advanced or metastatic non-castration-resistant PCa, Sequential prostatic biopsies may provide tissue for tumor profiling to yield mechanistic or prognostic insights relating to novel systemic anticancer therapies.""","""['Prabhakar Rajan', 'John A Frew', 'James M Wilson', 'Ashraf S T Azzabi', 'Rhona M McMenemin', 'Jacqueline Stockley', 'Naeem A Soomro', 'Garrett Durkan', 'Ian D Pedley', 'Hing Y Leung']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Androgen-deprivation therapy alone or with docetaxel in non-castrate metastatic prostate cancer (GETUG-AFU 15): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy plus docetaxel and estramustine versus androgen deprivation therapy alone for high-risk localised prostate cancer (GETUG 12): a phase 3 randomised controlled trial.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) Plus Docetaxel Versus ADT Alone in Metastatic Non castrate Prostate Cancer: Impact of Metastatic Burden and Long-term Survival Analysis of the Randomized Phase 3 GETUG-AFU15 Trial.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

In Panama, cancer is also one of the leading causes of death. In 1964, a nationwide cancer registry was started and it was restructured and improved in 2012. The aim of this study is to utilize Joinpoint regression analysis to study the trends of the incidence and mortality of cancer in Panama in the last decade. Cancer mortality was estimated from the Panamanian National Institute of Census and Statistics Registry for the period 2001 to 2011. Cancer incidence was estimated from the Panamanian National Cancer Registry for the period 2000 to 2009. The Joinpoint Regression Analysis program, version 4.0.4, was used to calculate trends by age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates for selected cancers. Overall, the trend of age-adjusted cancer mortality in Panama has declined over the last 10 years (-1.12% per year). The cancers for which there was a significant increase in the trend of mortality were female breast cancer and ovarian cancer; while the highest increases in incidence were shown for breast cancer, liver cancer, and prostate cancer. Significant decrease in the trend of mortality was evidenced for the following: prostate cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, and cervical cancer; with respect to incidence, only oral and pharynx cancer in both sexes had a significant decrease. Some cancers showed no significant trends in incidence or mortality. This study reveals contrasting trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Panama in the last decade. Although Panama is considered an upper middle income nation, this study demonstrates that some cancer mortality trends, like the ones seen in cervical and lung cancer, behave similarly to the ones seen in high income countries. In contrast, other types, like breast cancer, follow a pattern seen in countries undergoing a transition to a developed economy with its associated lifestyle, nutrition, and body weight changes.""","""['Michael Politis', 'Gladys Higuera', 'Lissette Raquel Chang', 'Beatriz Gomez', 'Juan Bares', 'Jorge Motta']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, part I: National cancer statistics.', 'Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2012, featuring the increasing incidence of liver cancer.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Progress in cancer mortality, incidence, and survival: a global overview.', 'Incidence and mortality trends for four major cancers in the elderly and middle-aged adults: an international comparison.', 'Is There a Difference in Adenoma Detection Rates According to Indication?

However, activating SRC mutations are exceedingly rare in human tumors, and mechanisms of ectopic SRC activation therefore remain largely unknown. Performing a functional genomics screen, we found that downregulation of SRC inhibitory kinase CSK is sufficient to overcome growth arrest induced by depriving human prostate cancer cells of androgen. CSK knockdown led to ectopic SRC activation, increased AR signaling, and resistance to anti-androgens. Consistent with the in vitro observations, stable knockdown of CSK conferred castration resistance in mouse xenograft models, while sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib was retained. Finally, CSK was found downregulated in a distinct subset of CRPCs marked by AR amplification and ETS2 deletion but lacking PTEN and RB1 mutations. These results identify CSK downregulation as a principal driver of SRC activation and castration resistance and validate SRC as a drug target in a molecularly defined subclass of CRPCs.""","""['Chih-Cheng Yang', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Salvatore Loguercio', 'Irina Zharkikh', 'Pedro Aza-Blanc', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Dieter A Wolf']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.', 'Dasatinib inhibits site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of androgen receptor by Ack1 and Src kinases.', 'Loss of Androgen-Regulated MicroRNA 1 Activates SRC and Promotes Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'The concept and mechanisms of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Regulation, targets and functions of CSK.', 'The Androgen Receptor and Its Crosstalk With the Src Kinase During Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Nuclear Export Inhibitor KPT-8602 Synergizes with PARP Inhibitors in Escalating Apoptosis in Castration Resistant Cancer Cells.', 'Unmasking Intra-tumoral Heterogeneity and Clonal Evolution in NF1-MPNST.', 'Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.']"""

Age-specific cutoff values were calculated using ROC curve analysis.  Results:   The median %fPSA was much lower in younger patients compared with older patients with a PSA level of 4.0-10.0 ng/ml or 10.1-20.0 ng/ml.

In some patients, disseminated tumor cells (DTC) proliferate to form active metastases after a prolonged period of undetectable disease known as tumor dormancy. Identifying mechanisms of PCa dormancy and reactivation remain a challenge partly due to the lack of in vitro models. Here, we characterized in vitro PCa dormancy-reactivation by inducing cells from three patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines to proliferate through tumor cell contact with each other and with bone marrow stroma. Proliferating PCa cells demonstrated tumor cell-cell contact and integrin clustering by immunofluorescence. Global gene expression analyses on proliferating cells cultured on bone marrow stroma revealed a downregulation of TGFB2 in all of the three proliferating PCa PDX lines when compared to their non-proliferating counterparts. Furthermore, constitutive activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), a downstream effector of integrin-beta1 and TGF-beta2, in non-proliferating cells promoted cell proliferation. This cell proliferation was associated with an upregulation of CDK6 and a downregulation of E2F4. Taken together, our data provide the first clinically relevant in vitro model to support cellular adhesion and downregulation of TGFB2 as a potential mechanism by which PCa cells may escape from dormancy.

Methods:   Thirty (30) archived paraffin embedded tissue samples from primary prostate tumors (15 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and 15 Cancer of the prostate (CaP)) were sectioned at thickness of 5 µm and confirmed as BPH or CaP. Sections from each sample were stained by Immunohistochemistry using the Streptavidin-biotin method and using CK5/6, CK7, CK8,CK20 and Ki67 antibodies (Zymed Antibody products). Appropriate positive and negative controls for each antibody were setup alongside the test slides.  Results:   BPH samples were reactive to Ck5/6 (93.3%), Ck7 (80%) and Ck8 (100%). Only 13.3% of BPH samples were reactive to Ki67. The reactivity of Ck5/6, 7, 8 in CaP is a contrast with only 3(20%) of samples positive with Ck5/6, 2(13.3%) positive with Ck7 and 14(93.3%) with Ck8. While reactivity of Ck 8 is similar in BPH and CaP, no reaction was recorded in Ck 20 in both BPH and CaP. Ki67 was only reactive in 2(13.3) of BPH samples and 15(100%) of CaP.

Methods:   PSMA I&T was synthesized in a combined solid phase and solution chemistry strategy. The PSMA affinity of (nat)Ga-/(nat)Lu-PSMA I&T was determined in a competitive binding assay using LNCaP cells. Internalization kinetics of (68)Ga- and (177)Lu-PSMA I&T were investigated using the same cell line, and biodistribution studies were performed in LNCaP tumor-bearing CD-1 nu/nu mice. Initial human PET imaging studies using (68)Ga-PSMA I&T, as well as endoradiotherapeutic treatment of 2 patients with metastatic PC using (177)Lu-PSMA I&T, were performed.  Results:   PSMA I&T and its cold gallium and lutetium analog revealed nanomolar affinity toward PSMA. The DOTAGA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1-(glutamic acid)-4,7,10-triacetic acid) conjugate PSMA I&T allowed fast and high-yield labeling with (68)Ga(III) and (177)Lu(III). Uptake of (68)Ga-/(177)Lu-PSMA I&T in LNCaP tumor cells is highly efficient and PSMA-specific, as demonstrated by competition studies both in vitro and in vivo. Tumor targeting and tracer kinetics in vivo were fast, with the highest uptake in tumor xenografts and kidneys (both PSMA-specific). First-in-human (68)Ga-PSMA I&T PET imaging allowed high-contrast detection of bone lesions, lymph node, and liver metastases. Endoradiotherapy with (177)Lu-PSMA I&T in 2 patients was found to be effective and safe with no detectable side effects.  Conclusion:   (68)Ga-PSMA I&T shows potential for high-contrast PET imaging of metastatic PC, whereas its (177)Lu-labeled counterpart exhibits suitable targeting and retention characteristics for successful endoradiotherapeutic treatment.

In addition to socioeconomic influences, biologic factors are believed to play a critical role in prostate cancer disparities. We investigated whether population-specific and -enriched miRNA-mRNA interactions might contribute to prostate cancer disparities.  Experimental design:   Integrative genomics was used, combining miRNA and mRNA profiling, miRNA target prediction, pathway analysis, and functional validation, to map miRNA-mRNA interactions associated with prostate cancer disparities.  Results:   We identified 22 AA-specific and 18 EA-specific miRNAs in prostate cancer versus patient-matched normal prostate, and 10 ""AA-enriched/-depleted"" miRNAs in AA prostate cancer versus EA prostate cancer comparisons. Many of these population-specific/-enriched miRNAs could be paired with target mRNAs that exhibited an inverse pattern of differential expression. Pathway analysis revealed EGFR (or ERBB) signaling as a critical pathway significantly regulated by AA-specific/-enriched mRNAs and miRNA-mRNA pairings. Novel miRNA-mRNA pairings were validated by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and/or IHC analyses in prostate cancer specimens. Loss/gain of function assays performed in population-specific prostate cancer cell lines confirmed miR-133a/MCL1, miR-513c/STAT1, miR-96/FOXO3A, miR-145/ITPR2, and miR-34a/PPP2R2A as critical miRNA-mRNA pairings driving oncogenesis. Manipulating the balance of these pairings resulted in decreased proliferation and invasion, and enhanced sensitization to docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity in AA prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that AA-specific/-enriched miRNA-mRNA pairings may play a critical role in the activation of oncogenic pathways in AA prostate cancer. Our findings also suggest that miR-133a/MCL1, miR-513c/STAT1, and miR-96/FOXO3A may have clinical significance in the development of novel strategies for treating aggressive prostate cancer.""","""['Bi-Dar Wang', 'Kristin Ceniccola', 'Qi Yang', 'Ramez Andrawis', 'Vyomesh Patel', 'Youngmi Ji', 'Johng Rhim', 'Jacqueline Olender', 'Anastas Popratiloff', 'Patricia Latham', 'Yinglei Lai', 'Steven R Patierno', 'Norman H Lee']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['MicroRNA-mRNA Regulatory Network Mediates Activation of mTOR and VEGF Signaling in African American Prostate Cancer.', 'A panel of miRNAs as prognostic markers for African-American patients with triple negative breast cancer.', 'MicroRNA profiling of novel African American and Caucasian Prostate Cancer cell lines reveals a reciprocal regulatory relationship of miR-152 and DNA methyltranferase 1.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'miRNAs as drivers of TMPRSS2-ERG negative prostate tumors in African American men.', 'Comparative and integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic-wide DNA methylation changes in African American prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Insight into Drug Resistance Mechanism Conferred by Aberrant PIK3CD Splice Variant in African American Prostate Cancer.', 'A pathway analysis-based algorithm for calculating the participation degree of ncRNA in transcriptome.', 'Downregulation of miR-99b-5p and Upregulation of Nuclear mTOR Cooperatively Promotes the Tumor Aggressiveness and Drug Resistance in African American Prostate Cancer.', 'The driver role of JAK-STAT signalling in cancer stemness capabilities leading to new therapeutic strategies for therapy- and castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Here, we report a novel humanized ADC that targets the tetraspanin-like protein TM4SF1. TM4SF1 is highly expressed on the plasma membranes of many human cancer cells and also on the endothelial cells lining tumor blood vessels. TM4SF1 is internalized upon interaction with antibodies. We hypothesized that an ADC against TM4SF1 would inhibit cancer growth directly by killing cancer cells and indirectly by attacking the tumor vasculature. We generated a humanized anti-human TM4SF1 monoclonal antibody, v1.10, and armed it with an auristatin cytotoxic agent LP2 (chemical name mc-3377). v1.10-LP2 selectively killed cultured human tumor cell lines and human endothelial cells that express TM4SF1. Acting as a single agent, v1.10-LP2 induced complete regression of several TM4SF1-expressing tumor xenografts in nude mice, including non-small cell lung cancer and pancreas, prostate, and colon cancers. As v1.10 did not react with mouse TM4SF1, it could not target the mouse tumor vasculature. Therefore, we generated a surrogate anti-mouse TM4SF1 antibody, 2A7A, and conjugated it to LP2. At 3 mpk, 2A7A-LP2 regressed several tumor xenografts without noticeable toxicity. Combination therapy with v1.10-LP2 and 2A7A-LP2 together was more effective than either ADC alone. These data provide proof-of-concept that TM4SF1-targeting ADCs have potential as anticancer agents with dual action against tumor cells and the tumor vasculature. Such agents could offer exceptional therapeutic value and warrant further investigation.

Given the significant proportion and role of women in African American churches, the M-PACT study examined whether including women in the intervention approach would have an effect on study outcomes compared with a men-only approach. The current analysis discusses the men's participation rates in the M-PACT intervention, which consisted of a series of 4 bimonthly men's health workshops in 18 African American churches. Data suggest that once enrolled, retention rates for men ranged from 62 to 69 % over the workshop series. Among the men who were encouraged to invite women in their lives (e.g., wife/partner, sister, daughter, friend) to the workshops with them, less than half did so (46 %), suggesting under-implementation of this ""health partner"" approach.

This study utilized data from the Japan Study Group of Prostate Cancer registry, which is a large, multicenter, population-based database.  Methods:   A total of 2982 patients treated with PADT were enrolled. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated using combined androgen blockade (CAB) and non-CAB therapies. The relationships between nadir PSA levels and PADT type according to initial serum PSA levels were also investigated.  Results:   Among the 2982 enrolled patients, 2101 (70.5 %) were treated with CAB. Although CAB-treated patients had worse clinical characteristics, their probability of PFS and OS was higher compared with those treated with a non-CAB therapy. These results were due to a survival benefit with CAB in patients with an initial PSA level of 500-1000 ng/mL. Nadir PSA levels were significantly lower in CAB patients than in non-CAB patients with comparable initial serum PSA levels.  Conclusions:   A small survival benefit for CAB in metastatic prostate cancer was demonstrated in a Japanese large-scale prospective cohort study.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma is generally regarded as a form of salivary gland carcinoma, but it can arise from sites unassociated with salivary tissue. A rare form of prostate carcinoma exhibits ACC-like features; it is no longer regarded as a true ACC but rather as prostatic basal cell carcinoma (PBCC) and within the spectrum of basaloid prostatic proliferations. True ACCs often harbor MYB translocations resulting in the MYB-NFIB fusion protein. MYB analysis could clarify the true nature of prostatic carcinomas that exhibit ACC features and thus help refine the classification of prostatic basaloid proliferations. Twelve PBCCs were identified from the pathology consultation files of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The histopathologic features were reviewed, and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization for MYB was performed. All 12 cases exhibited prominent basaloid histology. Four were purely solid, 7 exhibited a cribriform pattern reminiscent of salivary ACC, and 1 had a mixed pattern. The MYB rearrangement was detected in 2 (29%) of 7 ACC-like carcinomas but in none (0%) of the 5 PBCCs with a prominent solid pattern. True ACCs can arise in the prostate as is evidenced by the presence of the characteristic MYB rearrangement. When dealing with malignant basaloid proliferations in the prostate, recommendations to consolidate ACCs with other tumor types may need to be reassessed, particularly in light of the rapidly advancing field of biologic therapy where the identification of tumor-specific genetic alterations presents novel therapeutic targets.""","""['Justin A Bishop', 'Raluca Yonescu', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'William H Westra']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['MYB-NFIB gene fusion in adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast with special focus paid to the solid variant with basaloid features.', 'Primary cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma with MYB aberrations: report of three cases and comprehensive review of the literature.', 'Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland: MYB gene activation, genomic imbalances, and clinical characteristics.', 'Adenoid cystic carcinoma: emerging role of translocations and gene fusions.', 'MYB-NFIB fusion transcript in adenoid cystic carcinoma: Current state of knowledge and future directions.', 'Genomic Characterization of Prostatic Basal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Comparative proteomic and clinicopathological analysis of breast adenoid cystic carcinoma and basal-like triple-negative breast cancer.', 'WHO Classification of Tumours fifth edition: evolving issues in the classification, diagnosis, and prognostication of prostate cancer.', 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma/Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Prostate: Overview and Update on Rare Prostate Cancer Subtypes.', 'Overview of research on fusion genes in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   From October 2008 to December 2013, a total of 114 and 120 patients with primary whole-gland cryoablation and HIFU for localized prostate cancer, respectively, were enrolled in the study. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence defined by Phoenix definition, salvage treatment-free rate, metastasis-free rate, and PSA biochemical recurrence-free survival analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method were for oncological outcomes. Functional outcomes included complications and serial International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 scores, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and related quality of life (QoL) scores.  Results:   During the mean follow-up duration of approximately 2 years, the PSA biochemical recurrence rates of the two groups were similar (cryoablation 25.4 %, HIFU 18.3 %). In terms of functional outcomes, patients with HIFU had significantly lower IPSS (5.70 vs. 9.04 at 24 months; p = 0.030), lower erectile dysfunction rate (65.6 vs. 88.0 %; p = 0.015), and higher IIEF-5 score (9.36 vs. 4.18 at 24 months; p = 0.028) than patients with cryoablation.  Conclusions:   In this study, both primary whole-gland cryoablation and HIFU demonstrated good oncological outcomes for localized prostate cancer. We validated the safety of the two treatment modalities and identified the importance of combined HIFU and transurethral resection of the prostate. The HIFU patients experienced better urinary function improvement and more possible sexual function preservation than the cryoablation patients; therefore, HIFU may provide better quality of life for patients with localized prostate cancer.""","""['Yi Yang Liu', 'Po Hui Chiang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['Non-Whole-Gland High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound vs Whole-Gland High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Management of Localized Prostate Cancer: 1-Year Oncological and Functional Outcomes.', 'Whole-gland ablation of localized prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound: oncologic outcomes and morbidity in 1002 patients.', 'Hemi salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in unilateral radiorecurrent prostate cancer: a prospective two-centre study.', 'Current salvage methods for recurrent prostate cancer after failure of primary radiotherapy.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: 5-year experience.', 'Whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation and transurethral resection of the prostate in the patients with prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Salvage Radiotherapy Plus Androgen Deprivation Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer with Biochemical Failure after High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound as Primary Treatment.', 'Systematic Review of Focal and Salvage Cryotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Cohort study of high-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of localised prostate cancer treatment: Medium-term results from a single centre.', 'Primary cryotherapy for localised or locally advanced prostate cancer.']"""

Here, we report hydroxamic acid-based and benzoic acid-based inhibitors (SH5-07 and SH4-54, respectively) with robust bioactivity. Both inhibitors blocked STAT3 DNA-binding activity in vitro and in human glioma, breast, and prostate cancer cells and in v-Src-transformed murine fibroblasts. STAT3-dependent gene transcription was blocked along with Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, cyclin D1, c-Myc, and survivin expression. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of STAT3-inhibitor complexes defined interactions with the SH2 and DNA-binding domains of STAT3. Ectopic expression of the SH2 domain in cells was sufficient to counter the STAT3-inhibitory effects of SH4-54. Neither compound appreciably affected STAT1 or STAT5 DNA-binding activities, STAT3-independent gene transcription, or activation of a panel of oncogenic kinases in malignant cells. Each compound decreased the proliferation and viability of glioma, breast, and prostate cancer cells and v-Src-transformed murine fibroblasts harboring constitutively active STAT3. Further, in mouse xenograft models of glioma and breast cancer, administration of SH5-07 or SH4-54 effectively inhibited tumor growth.

Materials and methods:   We collected data of genetic SNP variants from 820 patients with PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) using a custom HumanExome BeadChip v1.0 (Illumina Inc.). We selected the SNPs that were most significantly associated with advanced-stage PCa (≥ T3) among the 242,186 SNPs that were genotyped, and we compared the accuracies of the associations using a multivariate logistic model that incorporated clinical factors and clinicogenetic factors.  Results:   Among the total cohort, 360 patients (43.9%) had advanced pathologic stage (≥ T3) after RP, of whom 262 (32.0%) had extracapsular extensions, 79 (9.6%) had seminal vesicle invasions, and 10 (1.3%) had bladder neck invasions. The exome array analysis indicated that 5 SNPs (rs6804162, rs8055236, rs56335308, rs6104, and rs12618769) were significant for predicting T3 stage after RP in patients with PCa. These genetic markers were significant factors after adjusting for other clinical parameters, and they increased the accuracy of a multivariate model for predicting advanced stage of PCa (83.9%-87.2%, P = 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Based on a genetic array, the selected SNPs were found to be independent predictors for advanced stage after RP, and the addition of individualized genetic information effectively enhanced the accuracy of predicting advanced-stage disease.

Methods:   A total of 57 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated between 2009 and 2014 were included in the present retrospective study. All patient data, including clinicopathological factors, were assessed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to predict overall survival and progression-free survival after chemotherapy initiation.  Results:   The median overall survival and progression-free survival were determined as 19.0 months (range 1-61 months) and 10.0 months (range 1-56 months), respectively. The cut-off level of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was set as the median value of 3.5 among all patients in this study. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the median overall survival and progression-free survival were shorter in patients with a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio compared with those with a low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (15 vs 20 months, P = 0.0125; and 9.5 vs 15 months, P = 0.0132, respectively). The overall survival and progression-free survival periods in patients with a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were significantly shorter than those of patients with a low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.0178 and 0.0176, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was an independent predictor of overall survival and progression-free survival (hazard ratio 2.728, 95% confidence interval 1.05-7.09, P = 0.039; and hazard ratio 2.376, 95% confidence interval 1.12-5.06, P=0.024, respectively).

The effect of PC-SPES II on LNCaP cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. According to the findings, at the mass concentration of 180-1 440 mg x L(-1), PC-SPES II significantly inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP cells; the IC50 of PC-SPES II at 24 h and 48 h were 311.48, 199.01 mg x L(-1), respectively. The flow Cytometry detection showed 240 mg x L(-1) PC-SPES II arrested cells in G2/M phase, and an obvious apoptotic peak appeared before G0/G1 peak and rose over time. Meanwhile, Hoechst 33258 staining revealed apoptotic cellular morphology. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining manifested an increase in apoptotic cell ratio at the PC-SPES II concentration of 480 mg x L(-1) in a dose dependent manner. The prostate specific antigen (PSA) secretion of LNCaP cells was tested by PSA ELISA kit. Besides, compared with 25 mg x L(-1) Bic, 480 mg x L(-1) PC-SPES II significantly reduced the cell secretion of PSA. The AR and PSA mRNA and protein expressions were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. According to the results, after the induction of LNCaP cells with synthetic androgen 25 μg x L(-1) R1881, 240-480 mg x L(-1) PC-SPES II notably down-regulated the AR and PSA mRNA and protein expressions and inhibited the translocation of AR from cytoplasm to nucleus. In summary, PC-SPES II significantly can inhibit the in vitro proliferation of LNCaP cells and arrest cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase.

Epidemiological studies demonstrated that hematopoietic, lung, skin, and prostate cancers are increased in RA, while breast and colon cancers are decreased, with an overall slight increase in all cancers.

In turn, loss of miR-34b resulted in downstream deregulation and overexpression of the ""stemness"" marker, Sox2.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and prostate cancer by performing a meta-analysis.  Materials and methods:   Pubmed and Web of Science databases were searched for case-control studies investigating the association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and prostate cancer. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were used to assess any link.  Results:   A total of 22 independent studies were identified, including 10,832 cases and 11,993 controls. Meta-analysis showed that there was no obvious association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and risk of prostate cancer under all five genetic models. There was also no obvious association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and risk of prostate cancer in the subgroup analyses of Caucasians. In contrast, MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with increased risk for prostate cancer in Asians with the allele model (C vs G: OR=1.299, 95 %CI =1.121-1.506, P=0.001, Pheterogeneity =0.120, I2=45%), additive genetic model (CC vs TT: OR =1.925, 95 % CI= 1.340-2.265, P=0.00, Pheterogeneity =0.587, I2=0.00%), recessive model (CC vs TT+TC: OR= 1.708, 95 % CI= 1.233-2.367, P=0.001, Pheterogeneity =0.716, I2=0.00%), and heterozygote genetic model (CT vs TT: OR=2.193, 95 % CI =1.510-3.186, P=0.000, Pheterogeneity =0.462, I2=0.00%).  Conclusions:   These results suggest that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism does not contribute to the risk of prostate cancer from currently available evidence in populations overall and Caucasians.

The approach generally followed is based on the fact that as the total number of samples increases, we expect to have greater power to detect associations of interest. This methodology has been applied to genome-wide association and transcriptomic studies due to the availability of datasets in the public domain. While this approach is well established in biostatistics, the introduction of new combinatorial optimization models to address this issue has not been explored in depth. In this study, we introduce a new model for the integration of multiple datasets and we show its application in transcriptomics.  Methods:   We propose a new combinatorial optimization problem that addresses the core issue of biomarker detection in integrated datasets. Optimal solutions for this model deliver a feature selection from a panel of prospective biomarkers. The model we propose is a generalised version of the (α,β)-k-Feature Set problem. We illustrate the performance of this new methodology via a challenging meta-analysis task involving six prostate cancer microarray datasets. The results are then compared to the popular RankProd meta-analysis tool and to what can be obtained by analysing the individual datasets by statistical and combinatorial methods alone.  Results:   Application of the integrated method resulted in a more informative signature than the rank-based meta-analysis or individual dataset results, and overcomes problems arising from real world datasets. The set of genes identified is highly significant in the context of prostate cancer. The method used does not rely on homogenisation or transformation of values to a common scale, and at the same time is able to capture markers associated with subgroups of the disease.""","""['Nisha Puthiyedth', 'Carlos Riveros', 'Regina Berretta', 'Pablo Moscato']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Integration of RNA-Seq data with heterogeneous microarray data for breast cancer profiling.', 'Gene expression signatures of neuroendocrine prostate cancer and primary small cell prostatic carcinoma.', 'Meta-analysis of prostate cancer gene expression data identifies a novel discriminatory signature enriched for glycosylating enzymes.', 'Inference of combinatorial Boolean rules of synergistic gene sets from cancer microarray datasets.', 'Microarrays--identifying molecular portraits for prostate tumors with different Gleason patterns.', ""A Systematic Bioinformatics Workflow With Meta-Analytics Identified Potential Pathogenic Factors of Alzheimer's Disease."", 'LogLoss-BERAF: An ensemble-based machine learning model for constructing highly accurate diagnostic sets of methylation sites accounting for heterogeneity in prostate cancer.', 'Selecting Feature Subsets Based on SVM-RFE and the Overlapping Ratio with Applications in Bioinformatics.', 'Identifying disease-associated pathways in one-phenotype data based on reversal gene expression orderings.', ""Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes through Integrated Study of Alzheimer's Disease Affected Brain Regions.""]"""

Clusterin (CLU) is a cytoprotective chaperone induced by androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition to facilitate adaptive survival pathway signaling and treatment resistance. In our study, we investigated the efficacy of siRNA tumor delivery using LNP systems in an enzalutamide-resistant (ENZ-R) castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) model.  Experimental design:   Gene silencing of a luciferase reporter gene in the PC-3M-luc stable cell line was first assessed in subcutaneous and metastatic PC-3 xenograft tumors. Upon validation, the effect of LNP siRNA targeting CLU in combination with AR antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) was assessed in ENZ-R CRPC LNCaP in vitro and in vivo models.  Results:   LNP LUC-siRNA silenced luciferase expression in PC-3M-luc subcutaneous xenograft and metastatic models. LNP CLU-siRNA potently suppressed CLU and AR ASO-induced CLU and AKT and ERK phosphorylation in ENZ-R LNCaP cells in vitro, more potently inhibiting ENZ-R cell growth rates and increased apoptosis when compared with AR-ASO monotherapy. In subcutaneous ENZ-R LNCaP xenografts, combinatory treatment of LNP CLU-siRNA plus AR-ASO significantly suppressed tumor growth and serum PSA levels compared with LNP LUC-siRNA (control) and AR-ASO.

Methods and materials:   In 45 men with high-risk PCa to be treated with WPRT, the target volumes and the OARs were delineated, the dose constraints for the OARs were defined, and treatment plans were generated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0924 protocol. Six dimensions to reflect the depth, width, and height of the bony pelvis were measured, and 2 indexes were calculated from the planning computed tomographic scans. The minimum dose (Dmin), maximum dose (Dmax), and mean dose (Dmean) for the target volumes and OARs and the partial volumes of each of these structures receiving a specified dose (VD) were calculated from the dose-volume histograms (DVHs). The data from the DVHs were correlated with the pelvic dimensions and indexes.  Results:   According to an overall hostility score (OHS) calculation, 25 patients were grouped as having a hospitable pelvis and 20 as having a hostile pelvis. Regarding the OHS grouping, the DVHs for the bladder, bowel bag, left femoral head, and right femoral head differed in favor of the hospitable pelvis group, and the DVHs for the rectum differed for a range of lower doses in favor of the hospitable pelvis group.

Methods and materials:   Seven patients with prostate cancer underwent standard planning computed tomography scanning. Four different CTVs (RMH, RTOG, modified RTOG, and Prostate and pelvIs Versus prOsTate Alone treatment for Locally advanced prostate cancer [PIVOTAL] trial) were created for each patient, and 6 different bowel expansion margins (BEM) were created to assess bowel avoidance by the CTV. The resulting CTVs were compared visually and by using Jaccard conformity indices. The volume of overlap between bowel and planning target volume (PTV) was measured to aid selection of an appropriate BEM to enable maximal LN yet minimal normal tissue coverage.  Results:   In total, 84 nodal contours were evaluated. LN coverage was similar in all groups, with all of the vascular-expansion techniques (RTOG, modified RTOG, and PIVOTAL), resulting in larger CTVs than that of the RMH technique (mean volumes: 287.3 cm(3), 326.7 cm(3), 310.3 cm(3), and 256.7 cm(3), respectively). Mean volumes of bowel within the modified RTOG PTV were 19.5 cm(3) (with 0 mm BEM), 17.4 cm(3) (1-mm BEM), 10.8 cm(3) (2-mm BEM), 6.9 cm(3) (3-mm BEM), 5.0 cm(3) (4-mm BEM), and 1.4 cm(3) (5-mm BEM) in comparison with an overlap of 9.2 cm(3) seen using the RMH technique. Evaluation of conformity between LN-CTVs from each technique revealed similar volumes and coverage.  Conclusions:   Vascular expansion techniques result in larger LN-CTVs than the freehand RMH technique. Because the RMH technique is supported by phase 1 and 2 trial safety data, we proposed modifications to the RTOG technique, including the addition of a 3-mm BEM, which resulted in LN-CTV coverage similar to that of the RMH technique, with reduction in bowel and planning target volume overlap.

Methods and materials:   For 30 patients, Erasmus-iCycle was first used to generate 15-, 20-, and 25-beam iBAS plans for a CyberKnife equipped with a multileaf collimator. With these plans, 6 recipes for creation of beam angle CSs were investigated. Plans of 10 patients were used to create CSs based on the recipes, and the other 20 to independently test them. For these tests, Erasmus-iCycle was also used to generate intensity modulated radiation therapy plans for the fixed CS beam setups.  Results:   Of the tested recipes for CS creation, only 1 resulted in 15-, 20-, and 25-beam noncoplanar CSs without plan deterioration compared with iBAS. For the patient group, mean differences in rectum D1cc, V60GyEq, V40GyEq, and Dmean between 25-beam CS plans and 25-beam plans generated with iBAS were 0.2 ± 0.4 Gy, 0.1% ± 0.2%, 0.2% ± 0.3%, and 0.1 ± 0.2 Gy, respectively. Differences between 15- and 20-beam CS and iBAS plans were also negligible. Plan quality for CS plans relative to iBAS plans was also preserved when narrower planning target volume margins were arranged and when planning target volume dose inhomogeneity was decreased. Using a CS instead of iBAS reduced the computation time by a factor of 14 to 25, mainly depending on beam number, without loss in plan quality.  Conclusions:   A recipe for creation of robust beam angle CSs for robotic prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy has been developed. Compared with iBAS, computation times decreased by a factor 14 to 25. The use of a CS may avoid long planning times without losses in plan quality.""","""['Linda Rossi', 'Sebastiaan Breedveld', 'Shafak Aluwini', 'Ben Heijmen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['iCycle: Integrated, multicriterial beam angle, and profile optimization for generation of coplanar and noncoplanar IMRT plans.', 'Variable circular collimator in robotic radiosurgery: a time-efficient alternative to a mini-multileaf collimator?', 'On the beam direction search space in computerized non-coplanar beam angle optimization for IMRT-prostate SBRT.', 'Rectal radiation dose-reduction techniques in prostate cancer: a focus on the rectal spacer.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices during prostate external-beam radiation therapy: A review.', 'Fully automated treatment planning for MLC-based robotic radiotherapy.', 'A treatment planning study comparing IMRT techniques and cyber knife for stereotactic body radiotherapy of low-risk prostate carcinoma.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for liver metastasis - clinical outcomes from the international multi-institutional RSSearch® Patient Registry.', 'Data for TROTS - The Radiotherapy Optimisation Test Set.']"""

We aim to expand the knowledge on the spectrum of phenotypes and outcomes of CPA-induced DILI.  Methods:   Twenty-two males (70 ± 8 years; range 54-83) developing liver damage as a result of CPA therapy (dose: 150 ± 50 mg/day; range 50-200) were included. Severity index and causality by RUCAM were assessed.  Results:   From 1993 to 2013, 22 patients were retrieved. Latency was 163 ± 97 days. Most patients were symptomatic, showing hepatocellular injury (91%) and jaundice. Liver tests at onset were: ALT 18 ± 13 × ULN, ALP 0.7 ± 0.7 × ULN and total serum bilirubin 14 ± 10 mg/dl. International normalized ratio values higher than 1.5 were observed in 14 (66%) patients. Severity was mild in 1 case (4%), moderate in 7 (32%), severe in 11 (50%) and fatal in 3 (14%). Five patients developed ascitis, and four encephalopathy. One patient had a liver injury that resembled autoimmune hepatitis. Eleven (50%) were hospitalized. Nineteen patients recovered after CPA withdrawal, although three required steroid therapy (two of them had high ANA titres). Liver biopsy was performed in seven patients (two hepatocellular collapse, one submassive necrosis, two cholestatic hepatitis, one cirrhosis with iron overload and one autoimmune hepatitis).

Grb2 exists in a constitutive equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric states. Here we show that only monomeric Grb2 is capable of binding to SOS and upregulating MAP kinase signalling and that the dimeric state is inhibitory to this process. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 160 (Y160) on Grb2, or binding of a tyrosylphosphate-containing ligand to the SH2 domain of Grb2, results in dimer dissociation.

Methods:   We examined MAOA expression in the prostate lobes of a conditional PTEN-deficient mouse model mirroring human PCa, with or without survivin knockout.

We further evaluated the combination of MAOA inhibitors and survivin suppressants on the growth, viability, migration and invasion of PCa cells.  Results:   Survivin and MAOA levels are both increased in clinical PCa tissues and significantly associated with patients' survival. Survivin depletion delayed MAOA increase during PCa progression, and silencing MAOA decreased survivin expression. The combination of MAOA inhibitors and the survivin suppressants (YM155 and SC144) showed significant synergy on the inhibition of PCa cell growth, migration and invasion with concomitant decrease in survivin and MMP-9 levels.

Methods:   Paraffin sections from 761 men with clinically localized prostate cancer diagnosed by needle biopsy and managed conservatively in the United Kingdom, mostly between 2000 and 2003. The primary end point was prostate cancer death. Clinical variables consisted of centrally reviewed Gleason score, baseline PSA level, age, clinical stage, and extent of disease; these were combined into a single predefined risk assessment (CAPRA) score. Full data were available for 585 men who formed a fully independent validation cohort.  Results:   In univariate analysis, the CCP score hazard ratio was 2.08 (95% CI (1.76, 2.46), P<10(-13)) for one unit change of the score. In multivariate analysis including CAPRA, the CCP score hazard ratio was 1.76 (95% CI (1.44, 2.14), P<10(-6)). The predefined CCR score was highly predictive, hazard ratio 2.17 (95% CI (1.83, 2.57), χ(2)=89.0, P<10(-20)) and captured virtually all available prognostic information.

Nine patients with localized prostate cancer who were previously treated with 78 Gy in 39 fractions using VMAT plans and rayArc system based on the direct machine parameter optimization (DMPO) algorithm were selected and replanned using the VMAT-MCO system. First, the dosimetric quality of the plans was evaluated using multiple conformity metrics that account for target coverage and sparing of healthy tissue, used in our departmental clinical protocols. The conformity and homogeneity index, number of monitor units, and treatment planning time for both modalities were assessed. Next, the effects of the technical plan parameters, such as constraint leaf motion CLM (cm/°) and maximum arc delivery time T (s), on the accuracy of delivered dose were evaluated using quality assurance passing rates (QAs) measured using the Delta4 phantom from ScandiDos.

We tested 3DVH software with an ArcCHECK. Two different calculating modes of ArcCHECK Planned Dose Perturbation (ACPDP) were used: ""Normal Sensitivity"" and ""High Sensitivity"". Ten prostate cancer patients treated with hypofractionated VMAT (67.6 Gy/26 Fr) in our hospital were studied. For the baseline plan, we induced MLC errors (-0.75, -0.5, -0.25, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mm for each single bank). We calculated the dose differences between the ACPDP dose with error and TPS dose with error using gamma passing rates and using DVH-based QA metrics. The correlations between dose estimation error and MLC position error varied with each structure and metric. A comparison using 1%/1 mm gamma index showed that the larger was the MLC error-induced, the worse were the gamma passing rates. Slopes of linear fit to dose estimation error versus MLC position error for mean dose and D95 to the PTV were 1.76 and 1.40% mm-1, respectively, for ""Normal Sensitivity"", and -0.53 and -0.88% mm-1, respectively, for ""High Sensitivity"", showing better accuracy for ""High Sensitivity"" than ""Normal Sensitivity"".

The steep dose gradient makes these measurements challenging. A phantom-based study was completed, aimed at developing a system for measurement of anterior rectal wall doses during hypofractionated prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) utilizing tomotherapy delivery. An array of four dual MOSkinTM dosimeters, spaced 1 cm apart, was placed on a replica Rectafix® immobilization spacer device. This Perspex probe is a more rigid alternative to rectal balloons, to improve geometric reproducibility. The doses at each point were measured in real time and compared to doses calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). Additionally, distance-to-agreement (DTA) measurements were acquired to assist in the comparison of measured and predicted doses. All dual MOSkin detectors measured dose to within ± 5% of the TPS at the anterior rectal wall. Whilst several points were outside of experimental error, the largest deviation from the TPS predicted dose represented a DTA of only 1.3 mm, within the acceptable DTA tolerance of 3 mm. Larger deviations of up to -11.9% were observed for the posterior and side walls; however, if acceptable DTA measurements are accounted for, then an agreement of 75% was observed. Although larger differences were observed at the other rectal wall locations, the overall effect of dose at these points was not as significant, given the lower doses. Despite the very high-dose gradient region, real-time measurements of the anterior rectal wall doses were within acceptable limits of TPS-predicted doses. The differences between measured and planned data were due to difficulties in precisely locating each detector on the TPS dose grid, which presented large variations in dose between CT voxels in regions of steep dose gradients. The dual MOSkin system would, therefore, be a useful device for detecting errors in real time, such as patient shifts or incorrect setup, during tomotherapy of the prostate.""","""['Sarah J Alnaghy', 'Shrikant Deshpande', 'Dean L Cutajar', 'Kemal Berk', 'Peter Metcalfe', 'Anatoly B Rosenfeld']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Real-time in vivo rectal wall dosimetry using MOSkin detectors during linac based stereotactic radiotherapy with rectal displacement.', 'In vivo rectal wall measurements during HDR prostate brachytherapy with MOSkin dosimeters integrated on a trans-rectal US probe: Comparison with planned and reconstructed doses.', 'Real-time in vivo dosimetry for SBRT prostate treatment using plastic scintillating dosimetry embedded in a rectal balloon: a case study.', 'Evaluation of linear array MOSFET detectors for in vivo dosimetry to measure rectal dose in HDR brachytherapy.', 'Reducing rectal injury in men receiving prostate cancer radiation therapy: current perspectives.', 'Real-time in vivo rectal wall dosimetry using MOSkin detectors during linac based stereotactic radiotherapy with rectal displacement.']"""

Radiochromic film is generally scanned 24 hr after film exposure (24-hr protocol). The single-scan protocol enables measurement results within a short time using only the verification film, one calibration film, and unirradiated film. The single-scan protocol was scanned 30 min after film irradiation. The EBT3 calibration curves were obtained with the multichannel film dosimetry method. The dose verifications for each protocol were performed with the step pattern, pyramid pattern, and clinical treatment plans for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The absolute dose distributions for each protocol were compared with those calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS) using gamma evaluation at 3% and 3 mm. The dose distribution for the single-scan protocol was within 2% of the 24-hr protocol dose distribution. For the step pattern, the absolute dose discrepancies between the TPS for the single-scan and 24-hr protocols were 2.0 ± 1.8 cGy and 1.4 ± 1.2 cGy at the dose plateau, respectively. The pass rates were 96.0% for the single-scan protocol and 95.9% for the 24-hr protocol.

In this study, the benefits of IMRT optimization using PAF-predicted objectives as guidance for prostate were evaluated. Three different optimization methods were compared.1) Expert Plan: Ten prostate cases (16 plans) were planned by an expert planner using conventional trial-and-error approach started with institutional modified OAR and PTV constraints. Optimization was stopped at 150 iterations and that plan was saved as Expert Plan. 2) Clinical Plan: The planner would keep working on the Expert Plan till he was satisfied with the dosimetric quality and the final plan was referred to as Clinical Plan. 3) PAF Plan: A third sets of plans for the same ten patients were generated fully automatically using predicted DVHs as guidance. The optimization was based on PAF-based predicted objectives, and was continued to 150 iterations without human interaction. DMAX and D98% for PTV, DMAX for femoral heads, DMAX, D10cc, D25%/D17%, and D40% for bladder/rectum were compared. Clinical Plans are further optimized with more iterations and adjustments, but in general provided limited dosimetric benefits over Expert Plans. PTV D98% agreed within 2.31% among Expert, Clinical, and PAF plans. Between Clinical and PAF Plans, differences for DMAX of PTV, bladder, and rectum were within 2.65%, 2.46%, and 2.20%, respectively. Bladder D10cc was higher for PAF but &lt; 1.54% in general. Bladder D25% and D40% were lower for PAF, by up to 7.71% and 6.81%, respectively. Rectum D10cc, D17%, and D40% were 2.11%, 2.72%, and 0.27% lower for PAF, respectively. DMAX for femoral heads were comparable (&lt; 35 Gy on average). Compared to Clinical Plan (Primary + Boost), the average optimization time for PAF plan was reduced by 5.2 min on average, with a maximum reduction of 7.1min. Total numbers of MUs per plan for PAF Plans were lower than Clinical Plans, indicating better delivery efficiency. The PAF-guided planning process is capable of generating clinical-quality prostate IMRT plans with no human intervention.

Comparisons between measurements taken with a 2D ion chamber array and results obtained by both systems for real VMAT plans were also performed (mean global gamma passing rates better than 87.0% and 97.9% for the 2%/2 mm and 3%/3 mm criteria). Clinical implementation of the systems was evaluated by comparing dose-volume parameters for all TG-119 tests and real VMAT plans with TPS values (mean differences were below 1%). In addition, comparisons between dose distributions calculated by TPS and those extracted by the two systems for real VMAT plans were also performed (mean global gamma passing rates better than 86.0% and 93.0% for the 2%/2 mm and 3%/ 3 mm criteria).

Intrafractional prostate motion was tracked during 8,660 treatment fractions for 236 patients. The following statistics were analyzed: 1) the percentage of fractions in which the prostate shifted 2-7 mm for a certain duration; 2) the proportion of the entire tracking time during which the prostate shifted 2-7mm; and 3) the proportion of each minute in which the shift exceeded 2-7 mm. The ten patients exhibiting maximum intrafractional-motion patterns were analyzed separately. Our results showed that the percentage of fractions in which the prostate shifted by &gt; 2, 3, 5, and 7 mm off the baseline in any direction for &gt; 30 s was 56.8%, 27.2%, 4.6%, and 0.7% for intact prostate and 68.7%, 35.6%, 10.1%, and 1.8% for postprostatectomy patients, respectively. For the ten patients, these percentages were 91.3%, 72.4%, 36.3%, and 6%, respectively. The percentage of tracking time during which the prostate shifted &gt; 2, 3, 5, and 7 mm was 27.8%, 10.7%, 1.6%, and 0.3%, respectively, and it was 56.2%, 33.7%, 11.2%, and 2.1%, respectively, for the ten patients. The percentage of tracking time for a &gt; 3 mm posterior motion was four to five times higher than that in other directions. For treatments completed in 5 min (VMAT) and 10 min (IMRT), the proportion for the prostate to shift by &gt; 3mm was 4% and 12%, respectively. Although intrafractional prostate motion was generally small, caution should be taken for patients who exhibit frequent large intrafractional motion. For those patients, adjustment of patient positioning may be necessary or a larger treatment margin may be used. After the initial alignment, the likelihood of prostate motion increases with time. Therefore, it is favorable to use advanced techniques (e.g., VMAT) that require less delivery time in order to reduce the treatment uncertainty resulting from intrafractional prostate motion.""","""['Xu Tong', 'Xiaoming Chen', 'Jinsheng Li', 'Qianqian Xu', 'Mu-Han Lin', 'Lili Chen', 'Robert A Price', 'Chang-Ming Ma']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Gains from real-time tracking of prostate motion during external beam radiation therapy.', 'Determining intrafractional prostate motion using four dimensional ultrasound system.', 'SU-D-BRA-06: Investigation of Prostate Intrafractional Motion during External Beam Radiotherapy for a Large Patient Population.', 'Intrafractional motion management in external beam radiotherapy.', 'Ultrasound Imaging in Radiation Therapy: From Interfractional to Intrafractional Guidance.', 'Single-Pulse X-ray Acoustic Computed Tomographic Imaging for Precision Radiation Therapy.', 'Prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy: quantifying intra-fraction motion and calculating margins using the new BIR geometric uncertainties in daily online IGRT recommendations.', 'Intrafraction Prostate Motion Management for Ultra-Hypofractionated Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Faster and more accurate patient positioning with surface guided radiotherapy for ultra-hypofractionated prostate cancer patients.', 'Plan comparison of prostate stereotactic radiotherapy in spacer implant patients.']"""

This plan comparison study describes the new features, their clinical applicability, and their effect on plan quality and treatment speed. For the first 45 patients worldwide that were scheduled for a treatment with TomoEdge, at least two plans were created: one with the previous ""standard""mode with static jaws and 2.5 cm field width (Reg 2.5) and one with TomoEdge technique and 5 cm field width (Edge 5). If, after analysis in terms of beam on time, integral dose, dose conformity, and organ at risk sparing the treating physician decided that the Edge 5 plan was not suitable for clinical treatment, a plan with TomoEdge and 2.5 cm field width was created (Edge 2.5) and used for the treatment. Among the 45 cases, 30 were suitable for Edge 5 treatment, including treatments of the head and neck, rectal cancer, anal cancer, malignancies of the chest, breast cancer, and palliative treatments. In these cases, the use of a 5 cm field width reduced beam on time by more than 30% without compromising plan quality. The 5 cm beam could not be clinically applied to treatments of the pelvic lymph nodes for prostate cancer and to head and neck irradiations with extensive involvement of the skull, as dose to critical organs at risk such as bladder (average dose 28 Gy vs. 29 Gy, Reg 2.5 vs. Edge 5), small bowel (29% vs. 31%, Reg 2.5 vs. Edge 5) and brain (average dose partial brain 19 Gy vs. 21 Gy, Reg 2.5 vs. Edge 5) increased to a clinically relevant, yet not statistically significant, amount.

Volunteers were scanned using the standard MR scanning protocol with the MR coil directly strapped on the external body and the volunteer lying on the original scanner table. They also were scanned using a MR-simulation table top and pelvic coil mounts. MR images from both setups were compared in terms of body contour variation and image quality effects within particular organs of interest. Six-field conformal plans were generated on the two images with assigned bulk density for dose calculation. With the MR-simulation devices, the anterior skin deformation was reduced by up to 1.7 cm. The hard tabletop minimizes the posterior body deformation which can be up to 2.3 cm on the standard table, depending on the weight of volunteer. The image signal-to-noise ratio reduced by 14% and 25% on large field of view (FOV) and small FOV images, respectively, after using the coil mount; the prostate volume contoured on two images showed difference of 1.05 ± 0.66 cm3. The external body deformation caused a mean dose reduction of 0.6 ± 0.3 Gy, while the coverage reduced by 22% ± 13% and 27% ± 6% in V98 and V100, respectively.

Subjects and methods:   This phase I trial enrolled patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). Three groups of five patients each (total of 15 patients) received IV ferumoxytol before RP with bilateral PLND at each of the following doses of iron: 4, 6, and 7.5 mg Fe/kg. Patients underwent abdominopelvic MRI at 3 T before and 24 hours after ferumoxytol injection using T2- and T2*-weighted sequences. Normalized signal intensity (SI) and normalized SD changes from baseline to 24 hours after injection within visible lymph nodes were calculated for each dose level. Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate the effects of dose on the percentage SI change and log-transformed SD change within visible lymph nodes to determine the optimal dose of ferumoxytol for achieving uniform low SI in normal nodes.  Results:   One patient who was excluded from the study group had a mild allergic reaction requiring treatment after approximately 2.5 mg Fe/kg ferumoxytol injection whereupon the injection was interrupted.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study consisted of 872 consecutive men who had undergone MRI-guided prostate biopsy. Inclusion criteria were PSA level greater than or equal to 4 ng/mL, one or more negative TRUS-guided biopsy session, the presence of suspicious lesions on previous multiparametric MRI, and prostate cancer histopathologically proven by MRI-guided biopsy. Thereafter, the location of intermediate- or high-risk cancers and cancers with a maximum cancer core length of 6 mm or longer were determined. The proportion of cancer locations was compared using a chi-square test. One-way ANOVA analyses were performed to compare patient characteristics.  Results:   Results were presented on both a patient and lesion basis because a single patient can have multiple lesions. In total, 176 of 872 patients met the inclusion criteria.

Methods:   34 patients were enrolled in the study. All patients had a clinical suspicion of cancer due to increased PSA and/or positive digital rectal examination. Patients were subjected to an MRSI 3T examination and subsequently to TPUS-B.  Results:   Of the 22 (22/34) patients who presented abnormalities MRSI at 3T, 9 had a histological diagnosis of Prostate adenocarcinoma. Of the remaining 13 patients, 6 were found to be histologically positive for Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy and 7 Chronic Interstitial Inflammation or High Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia. 12 (12/34) patients found to have no peripheral alterations in their prostate on 3T MRSI, none were positive for ADK or inflammation on histology. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 100%, 48%, 40% and 100% respectively.  Discussion:   In this study, we correlated the values obtained from 3T MRSI with the results of histologically examined prostate biopsies. Our work shows that 72.8% of the voxels in which there was a change in ratio of Cit/(Cho + Cr), corresponded to areas of prostate tissue disease. Of these, 73.2% were positive for ADK and 26.8% for CII or HG PIN. In literature, it is noted that PCa can be distinguished from areas of benign tissue, in the peripheral zone, on the basis of the values of the ratio Cit/(Cho + Cr) (17), although some benign conditions, such as prostatitis or PINHG, can alter these values (18-19).  Conclusions:   In conclusion, the use of MRSI 3T before performing prostate biopsies may represent a valid aid for the urologist in the diagnosis of PCa, allowing them to avoid unnecessary prostate biopsies that may be negative.

We present the effect of prostate biopsy on prostate cell dissemination and the phenotypic characteristics of these cells.  Methods:   50 men undergoing initial prostate biopsy for suspicion of prostate cancer were studied. Blood samples were taken immediately before, and 1 and 24 hours after biopsy for circulating prostate cells (CPC) determination and phenotypic characterization. CPCs were detected and counted using standard immunocytochemistry using anti-PSA and then characterized using anti-P504S and anti-matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2).  Results:   14 (28%) men had cancer detected on biopsy. 13/14 had P504S (+) and MMP-2 (+) cells detected prior to biopsy. One hour after biopsy there was a mixture of P504S (+) and P504S (-) cells detected, as well as MMP-2 (+) and MMP-2 (-) cells detected. 24 hours after biopsy the same 13/14 men remained positive, although the number of CPCs increased 1 hour after biopsy and then the numbers decreased to pre-biopsy levels after 24 hours. In cancer negative men, P504S (-) and MMP-2 (-) cells were detected, some of these cells persisted 24 hours after biopsy.  Conclusions:   Prostate biopsy causes dissemination of prostate cells into the circulation, both malignant and benign; the majority of them are cleared within 24 hours. There was no conversion of negative to positive result in men with cancer, this suggests that the inherent capacity of malignant CPCs to disseminate is more important than the effect of dissemination caused by prostate biopsy.""","""['Nigel P Murray', 'Eduardo Reyes', 'Nelson Orellana', 'Cynthia Fuentealba', 'Ricardo Dueñas', 'Omar Jacob']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['Extended use of P504S positive primary circulating prostate cell detection to determine the need for initial prostate biopsy in a prostate cancer screening program in Chile.', 'A performance analysis of the presence of malignant circulating prostate cells as a predictive factor for the detection of prostate cancer in the first, second and third prostate biopsy.', 'Comparison of the Formula of PSA, Age, Prostate Volume and Race Versus PSA Density and the Detection of Primary Malignant Circulating Prostate Cells in Predicting a Positive Initial Prostate Biopsy in Chilean Men with Suspicion of Prostate Cancer.', 'Conventional transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.

An English validation of a shortened version of the EPIC (Expanded Prostate Cancer Composite), the most used instrument to measure the quality of life in patients with prostate cancer, has been published recently. This version called EPIC-CP (Expanded Prostate Cancer Composite-Clinical Practice) consists of 16 questions arranged in a page, for easy and rapid clinical application. The objective of this work is to validate a Spanish version of the EPIC-CP.  Method:   An inversa-directa Spanish translation of the original version was performed. The EPIC-CP and EQ5D questionnaires were applied to 46 patients eligible to be subjected to different treatments - open prostatectomy (OP), Robotic Prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy (Br) or conformational radiotherapy (CR) - and 82 patients already treated (9 OP, 13 RP, 7 Br, 4 CR). For reliability evaluation, the Cronbach's alpha was used to test the internal consistency for each domain of the EPIC-CP. Treated and untreated patients' scores were compared with the Wilcoxon range sum test to assess the sensitivity to change.  Results:   Cronbach's alpha was elevated in all the EPIC-CP domains (near or greater than 0.7), indicating a high internal consistency. There was no significant difference in age and educational level between treated and untreated patients. We found significant differences between treated and untreated patients in the total EPIC CP score, in the domains of urinary incontinence, bowel function, sexual function and hormonal function.

However, the effectiveness of this approach has not been established. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term outcomes of primary radiotherapy compared with conservative management in order to facilitate treatment decisions.  Method:   This population-based study consisted of 57,749 patients with T1-T2 prostate cancers diagnosed during 1992-2007. We utilized an instrumental variable (IV) analytical approach with competing risk models to evaluate the outcomes of primary radiotherapy vs conservative management. The IV was comprised of combined health service areas with high- and low-use areas corresponding to the top and bottom tertile in radiotherapy usage rates.  Results:   In patients with low-/intermediate-risk prostate cancer, 10-year prostate cancer-specific and overall survival was similar in high- and low-radiotherapy use areas (96.1 vs 95.4% and 56.6 vs 56.3%, respectively). In patients with high-risk disease, however, areas with high-radiotherapy use had a higher 10-year cancer-specific survival (90.2 vs 88.1%, difference 2.1%; 95% CI 0.3-4.0%) and 10-year overall survival (53.3 vs 50.2%, difference 3.1%; 95% CI 1.3-6.3%). Results were similar irrespective of the type of radiotherapy used. To assess the robustness of our choice of IV, we repeated the IV analytical approach using different IVs (using the median utilization rate as the cutoff) and found the results to be similar.

The aim of this study was to determine the anti-invasive activity of fisetin in human breast cancer cells. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a major component facilitating the invasion of many cancer tumor cell types, and thus the inhibitory effect of fisetin on MMP-9 expression in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated human breast cancer cells was investigated in this study. Fisetin significantly attenuated TPA-induced cell invasion in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, and was found to inhibit the activation of the PKCα/ROS/ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. This effect was furthermore associated with reduced NF-κB activation, suggesting that the anti-invasive effect of fisetin on MCF-7 cells may result from inhibited TPA activation of NF-κB and reduced TPA activation of PKCα/ROS/ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signals, ultimately leading to the downregulation of MMP-9 expression.

Large-scale transcriptional profiling studies in each cancer type have reported aberrant gene expression associated with cancer development. However, common and specific patterns altered across cancer types, especially the contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators, are rarely explored.  Results:   Using transcriptional profiles from matched tumor and normal samples in the Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer dataset, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the altered expression across 9 cancer types, focusing on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators and cancer-related genes. As we expected, the transcription of cancer-related genes was significantly deregulated in tumor vs. normal across all cancer types. Surprisingly, the expression of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), master regulators of post-transcriptional gene expression, was also significantly changed across most studied cancer types. Although the expression of RBPs was not as strongly deregulated as cancer-related genes, their direct interaction partners are enriched by cancer-related genes, suggesting the cascade regulation effect of RBPs. Integrating genetic and epigenetic profiles found that deregulated RBPs were frequently caused by genetic rather than epigenetic alterations. Furthermore, tissue-specific genes were under-expressed in tumor vs. normal across all cancer types except prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Dysregulated transcription across cancer types reveals the importance of RBPs in carcinogenesis. The aberrant expression of RBPs is caused by genetic alterations and spreads their effect to cancer-related genes. In addition, disruption of tissue-specific genes contributes to the corresponding cancer pathology.""","""['Jing Wang', 'Qi Liu', 'Yu Shyr']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['A comprehensive expression landscape of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) across 16 human cancer types.', 'Mutational landscape of RNA-binding proteins in human cancers.', 'Analysis of post-transcriptional regulation during cancer progression using a donor-derived isogenic model of tumorigenesis.', 'MAPKAPK2: the master regulator of RNA-binding proteins modulates transcript stability and tumor progression.', 'RNA-Binding Proteins as Important Regulators of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Cancer.', 'Proof-of-Concept Method to Study Uncharacterized Methyltransferases Using PRDM15.', 'Tumor suppressor mediated ubiquitylation of hnRNPK is a barrier to oncogenic translation.', 'Proteomics-Based Identification of Dysregulated Proteins in Breast Cancer.', 'A comparative analysis of machine learning classifiers for predicting protein-binding nucleotides in RNA sequences.', 'Genome-wide cross-cancer analysis illustrates the critical role of bimodal miRNA in patient survival and drug responses to PI3K inhibitors.']"""

Patients and methods:   Patients treated with BT in Switzerland were registered in a prospective database. Only patients with a follow-up of at least 2 years were included in our analysis. Clinical follow-up and PSA measurements were assessed after 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter. If PSA increased, additional follow-up visits were scheduled.

Methods:   A total of 500 consecutive patients were included in this prospective series. All patients underwent open nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. Intraoperatively, both posterolateral aspects of the prostate were sent for IFS. In case of PSM, additional tissue was partly resected from the prostatic bed along the NVB. BCR was the oncologic endpoint (PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml). The impact of IFS on PSM and BCR-free survival, and the effect of secondary partial resection of NVB on continence and erectile function (EF) recovery were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analyses.  Results:   Twenty-nine patients were excluded because of neoadjuvant treatment/lymph node positive disease. PSM were detected in 137/471 patients (29.1%). After secondary resection, 127/137 patients (92.7%) converted to definitive negative surgical margins (NSM). Out of 137 patients, ten (7.3%) showed persistent PSM. False-negative rate was 3.3% (11/334). Out of 471 patients, two (0.4%) showed PSM outside the IFS area. Overall, final PSM rate was 4.9% (23/471).

Results:   Nine lincRNA co-expression modules were identified from PCa RNA-Seq data. The association between the principle component of each module and the PCa phenotype was examined by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficients. Three modules (M1, M3, and M5) were found associated with PCa. Two modules (M3 and M5) were significantly enriched with lincRNAs, and one of them, M3, may be used as a lincRNA module-biomarker for PCa diagnosis. This module includes seven essential lincRNAs: TCONS_l2_00001418, TCONS_l2_00008237, TCONS_l2_00011130, TCONS_l2_00013175, TCONS_l2_00022611, TCONS_l2_00022670 and linc-PXN-1. The clustering analysis and microRNA enrichment analysis further confirmed our findings.  Conclusion:   The correlation between lincRNAs and protein-coding genes is helpful for further exploration of functional mechanisms of lincRNAs in PCa. This study provides some important insights into the roles of lincRNAs in PCa and suggests a few lincRNAs as candidate biomarkers for PCa diagnosis and prognosis.""","""['Weirong Cui', 'Yulan Qian', 'Xiaoke Zhou', 'Yuxin Lin', 'Junfeng Jiang', 'Jiajia Chen', 'Zhongming Zhao', 'Bairong Shen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Integrative Analysis of Normal Long Intergenic Non-Coding RNAs in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pan-Cancer Analyses Reveal Long Intergenic Non-Coding RNAs Relevant to Tumor Diagnosis, Subtyping and Prognosis.', 'Clinical prospects of long noncoding RNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Identification and functional analysis of long intergenic noncoding RNA genes in porcine pre-implantation embryonic development.', 'The evolution of long noncoding RNA acceptance in prostate cancer initiation, progression, and its clinical utility in disease management.', 'Temporal progress of gene expression analysis with RNA-Seq data: A review on the relationship between computational methods.', 'Identification and Characterization of lncRNA and mRNA in Testes of Landrace and Hezuo Boars.', 'A Personalized Genomics Approach of the Prostate Cancer.', 'Sex-Biased lncRNA Signature in Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR).', 'The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA Regulatory Network and Factors Associated with Prognosis Prediction of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

We estimated the incidence of these outcomes among M0-PC patients on ADT and identified prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based biomarkers for mortality and metastasis.  Methods:   This population-based cohort study included all nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients in Northern and Central Denmark Regions during 1997-2010, identified through registry data. Primary outcomes were metastasis, overall survival, and bone metastasis-free survival (BMFS). We estimated relative risks (RR) associated with PSA and PSA doubling-time (PSA-DT), measured as time-varying variables beginning at ADT treatment start.  Results:   We included 2494 M0-PC patients treated with ADT, of whom 1617 (80%) developed CRPC during follow-up. One-fourth of the patients developed metastases within 5 years; bone metastases (BM) accounted for 81% of all metastases. Median survival time was 4.4 years. Compared with PSA <8 ng/mL, PSA ≥8 ng/mL was associated with an adjusted RR of 14.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.2, 19.0) for BM, 4.4 (CI: 3.9, 5.0) for all-cause mortality, and RR of 4.8 (CI: 4.3, 5.4) for the inverse of BMFS. PSA-DT ≤6 months was associated with an adjusted RR of 7.6 (95% CI: 6.1, 9.5) for BM, RR of 5.9 (CI: 5.2, 6.6) for all-cause mortality, and RR 6.6 (CI: 5.9, 7.4) for the inverse of BMFS.  Conclusions:   PSA ≥8 ng/mL and PSA-DT ≤6 months are strong predictors of mortality and bone metastasis.

Material and method:   A retrospective study was performed that analyzed baseline PSA in the fifth decade of life and its ability to predict the development of PC in a population of Madrid (Spain). An ROC curve was created and a cutoff was proposed. We compared the evolution of PSA from baseline in patients with consecutive readings using the Friedman test. We established baseline PSA ranges with different risks of developing cancer and assessed the diagnostic utility of the annual PSA velocity (PSAV) in this population.  Results:   Some 4,304 men aged 40-49 years underwent opportunistic screening over the course of 17 years, with at least one serum PSA reading (6,001 readings) and a mean follow-up of 57.1±36.8 months. Of these, 768 underwent biopsy of some organ, and 104 underwent prostate biopsy. Fourteen patients (.33%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer. The median baseline PSA was .74 (.01-58.5) ng/mL for patients without PC and 4.21 (.76-47.4) ng/mL for those with PC. The median time from the reading to diagnosis was 26.8 (1.5-143.8) months. The optimal cutoff for detecting PC was 1.9ng/mL (sensitivity, 92.86%; specificity, 92.54%; PPV, 3.9%; NPV, 99.97%), and the area under the curve was 92.8%. In terms of the repeated reading, the evolution of the PSA showed no statistically significant differences between the patients without cancer (p=.56) and those with cancer (P=.64). However, a PSAV value >.3ng/mL/year revealed high specificity for detecting cancer in this population.  Conclusions:   A baseline PSA level ≥1.9ng/mL in Spanish men aged 40-49 years predicted the development of PC. This value could therefore be of use for opportunistic screening at an early age. An appropriate follow-up adapted to the risk of this population needs to be defined, but an annual PSAV ≥.3ng/mL/year appears of use for reaching an early diagnosis.""","""['J C Angulo', 'M A Viñas', 'H Gimbernat', 'F Ramón de Fata', 'R Granados', 'M Luján']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Long-term prostate-specific antigen contamination in the Spanish arm of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Optimizing prostate cancer screening; prospective randomized controlled study of the role of PSA and PCA3 testing in a sequential manner in an opportunistic screening program.', 'Usefulness of prostate-specific antigen velocity in screening for prostate cancer.', 'The role of prostate-specific antigen velocity in prostate cancer early detection.', 'Prostatic specific antigen for prostate cancer detection.', 'Association of Baseline Prostate-Specific Antigen Level With Long-term Diagnosis of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Among Patients Aged 55 to 60 Years: A Secondary Analysis of a Cohort in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.', 'PSA kinetics before 40 years of age.']"""

Technical considerations:   We evaluated 155 consecutive patients undergoing RARP with PLND over 24 months. Group A included the first 77 patients with PLND using standard technique (no peritoneal flap). Group B included the subsequent 78 patients (1 patient excluded) with PLND and peritoneal interposition flap. The peritoneal interposition flap is created by rotating and advancing the peritoneum around the lateral surface of the ipsilateral bladder to the dependent portion of the pelvis and fixing it to the bladder itself. A cystogram was performed in 91% of the patients 7-14 days after the surgery. Lymphocele formation rates were compared (based on symptoms, cystogram findings, and radiographic confirmation).  Results:   The 2 groups were statistically equivalent in terms of prostate-specific antigen, age, blood loss, body mass index, Gleason score, prostate size, pathology, or heparin use. Lymphocele formation occurred in 9 of 77 (11.6%) group A patients and in 0 of 77 group B patients (P = .003). Mean time to lymphocele detection in group A was 30.4 days. Mean follow-up in groups A and B were 383.97 and 379 days, respectively (P = .91).

Some studies report brachyury as highly specific for chordoma, whereas others have concluded that brachyury is expressed in many types of common carcinomas by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and could be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastatic process. In this study, we immunohistochemically evaluated 5229 different tumors for nuclear brachyury expression using a new rabbit monoclonal antibody and automated immunostaining (Leica Bond Max). Only nuclear labeling was scored, and antibody dilution of 1:2000 was used. In normal tissues, only rare cells in seminiferous tubules were labeled; all other organs were negative. All chordomas (75/76), except a sarcomatous one, were positive, whereas chondrosarcomas were negative. Among epithelial tumors, positivity was often detected in embryonal carcinoma (74%) and seminoma (45%). Pulmonary small cell carcinoma was often positive (41%), whereas pulmonary and pancreatic adenocarcinomas only rarely showed nuclear brachyury positivity (3% to 4%). Common carcinomas such as ductal carcinomas of the breast or adenocarcinomas of the prostate only exceptionally showed nuclear positivity (<1%). No colorectal, hepatocellular, renal cell, squamous cell, thyroid or urothelial carcinoma, or mesothelioma showed nuclear brachyury positivity. Among mesenchymal and neuroectodermal tumors, only isolated cases of melanoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and follicular lymphoma showed nuclear expression. However, as shown previously with lung carcinoma, experiments with lower antibody dilutions (1:200 to 1:500) showed weak cytoplasmic and nuclear labeling in breast cancers. In addition to chordoma, we show here for the first time that nuclear brachyury expression is prevalent in embryonal carcinoma, seminoma, and small cell carcinoma of the lung but very rare in common carcinomas, sarcomas, and melanoma.

Materials and methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1021 men aged 40-79 years with no clinical evidence of prostate cancer, prostate surgery or 5α-reductase inhibitor treatment of known prostate conditions. The severity of LUTS was assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Potential factors associated with LUTS including age, ethnicity, education, history of hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, height, weight, and prostate volume were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses.  Results:   There were 506 (50%) men found to have moderate-to-severe LUTS attaining an IPSS above 7. Overall, nocturia (45.5%) was the most frequently reported symptom. Multivariable analysis showed that age, ethnicity, prostate volume and history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were independent factors associated with severity of LUTS (p < 0.05). Considering individual lower urinary tract symptoms, we found a strong association of storage symptom with history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Malay men were significantly bothered by post micturition symptom compared to their Chinese and Indian counterparts. Stratified analyses of LUTS demonstrated a mutually exclusive cardiovascular risk factors profile defined by ethnicity.

Due to its cellular localization, the relevance of its function and the availability of blocking agents, GRPR seems to be a promising candidate as therapeutic target. Our present work shows that effective knockdown of GRPR in LNCaP and VCaP cells attenuates their malignant phenotype by decreasing proliferation, invasion and anchorage-independent growth, while increasing apoptosis. Using an antibody microarray we were able to validate known and identify new targets of GRPR pathway, namely AKT1, PKCε, TYK2 and MST1.

This study was aimed at understanding the genome-wide binding and regulatory role of the DAXX transcriptional repressor, recently implicated in PCa. ChIP-Seq analysis of genome-wide distribution of DAXX in PC3 cells revealed over 59,000 DAXX binding sites, found at regulatory enhancers and promoters. ChIP-Seq analysis of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which is a key epigenetic partner for DAXX repression, revealed that DNMT1 binding was restricted to a small number of DAXX sites. DNMT1 and DAXX bound close to transcriptional activator motifs. DNMT1 sites were found to be dependent on DAXX for recruitment by analyzing DNMT1 ChIP-Seq following DAXX knockdown (K/D), corroborating previous findings that DAXX recruits DNMT1 to repress its target genes. Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to compare the transcriptomes of WT and DAXX K/D PC3 cells. Genes induced by DAXX K/D included those involved in autophagy, and DAXX ChIP-Seq peaks were found close to the transcription start sites (TSS) of autophagy genes, implying they are more likely to be regulated by DAXX. In conclusion, DAXX binds active regulatory elements and co-localizes with DNMT1 in the prostate cancer genome.

The aim of this study was to determine if osteoclasts play a role in the seeding of disseminated tumor cells to the bone marrow by mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) out of their marrow niche. Human PC-3Luc cells were introduced into male SCID mice by intracardiac (i.c.) injection after mice were treated with the antiresorptive agent Zoledronic Acid (bisphosphonate (BP)) and/or AMD3100, which mobilizes HSCs out of the marrow. Short term homing of PC-3 was assessed at 24 hours by QPCR for human Alu and luciferase and HSC number was determined by FACS. Mice also received pre and/or post treatments of BP by intraperiteneal (i.p.) injections, in addition to PC-3 luc by intratibial (i.t.) injections. TRAP assays were used to determine the osteoclast (OC) number in both studies. AMD3100 enhanced the release of HSCs from the bone marrow, while BP increased the retention of HSCs. PCa entry into bone was facilitated in AMD3100, BP, and AMD3100+BP treatments. Before PCa injection, the number of TRAP+ OC was increased in mice treated with AMD3100, while treatment with BP resulted in relatively lower TRAP+ OCs. TRAP+ OCs were not detected in the AMD3100 + BP treatment. After PCa injection, however, the number of TRAP+ OCs was dramatically increased, but did not differ significantly amongst the treatment groups. The pre and post BP treatments in the Nude mice decreased the size of PCa lesions in the tibia compared to the control. The results indicate that OC activation is not necessary for PCa metastasis to bone at the earliest stages. These findings are critical in proving that OCs' contribution to metastasis occur during the growth phase of the tumor rather than at the initiation phase.""","""['J L Zalucha', 'Y Jung', 'J Joseph', 'J Wang', 'J E Berry', 'Y Shiozawa', 'R S Taichman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cancer Stem Cell Res""","""['The bone metastasis niche in breast cancer-potential overlap with the haematopoietic stem cell niche in vivo.', 'Direct bone marrow injection of human bone marrow-derived stromal cells into mouse femurs results in greater prostate cancer PC-3 cell proliferation, but not specifically proliferation within the injected femurs.', 'CCR1 chemokines promote the chemotactic recruitment, RANKL development, and motility of osteoclasts and are induced by inflammatory cytokines in osteoblasts.', 'The role of osteoblasts in regulating hematopoietic stem cell activity and tumor metastasis.', 'Preclinical studies with zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates: impact on the bone microenvironment.', 'Prostate cancer induced bone pain: pathobiology, current treatments and pain responses from recent clinical trials.', 'Biodistribution studies for cell therapy products: Current status and issues.', 'Breast cancer bone metastases are attenuated in a Tgif1-deficient bone microenvironment.', 'The bone metastasis niche in breast cancer-potential overlap with the haematopoietic stem cell niche in vivo.', 'Targeting the Metastatic Bone Microenvironment by MicroRNAs.']"""

Therefore, the isolation of PIA and the extraction of high-quality RNA from isolated PIA are of great importance to further demonstrate the correlation between PIA and the development of PCa at a molecular level.

The present investigation seeks to determine whether a difference exists in recurrence rates when the margin involvement is at a site of prostate pseudocapsule invasion vs. within the prostate parenchyma proper.  Methods:   Patients were retrospectively identified for inclusion by clinically localized disease and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of< 30 ng/ml at diagnosis, managed with prostatectomy alone and identified to have involvement of surgical margin(s). Exclusion criteria were: pT3b or pN1 disease, immediate/nonsalvage postoperative radiation or hormone therapy, or insufficient follow-up (<12 mo). Pathology slides were reviewed by a pathologist blinded to outcome, for determination of pseudocapsule invasion at a site of margin involvement. Disease recurrence was defined as PSA level of ≥ 0.2 ng/ml and rising, per contemporary guidelines. Kaplan-Meier method was used for construction of disease control estimate confidence intervals; Cox Proportional Hazards Model was used to compare disease control across groups.  Results:   Between 2003 and 2010, 155 patients were identified for inclusion in the present study. The median age was 61 years, and all had clinical stage T1 and T2 disease (75% T1c). At diagnosis, the Gleason score was 6, 7, and 8-9 for 103 (66%), 42 (27%), and 10 (6%) patients, respectively, with median PSA level of 5.6 ng/ml (85%≤ 10). For 149 patients with reviewable margin site data, 51 (34%) demonstrated involvement within or beyond the pseudocapsule. At a median follow-up of 68 months (range: 13-137), 62 patients had experienced PSA relapse. The estimated 5-year PSA relapse rates for patients with an involved margin at the site of pseudocapsule invasion vs. prostate parenchyma were 49% vs. 34%, respectively (P = 0.017; hazard ratio = 1.853).  Conclusions:   Early PSA relapse rates are high for patients with involved surgical margin(s) without seminal vesicle or node involvement at prostatectomy; however, for patients who are followed without immediate adjuvant therapy, presence of tumor cells at the margin in a site of pseudocapsule invasion or penetration confers a higher risk of recurrence.""","""['James Kyle Russo', 'Michael Laszewski', 'Mark Rodacker', 'Patricia L Watkins', 'Tarek A Dufan', 'Nadim Koleilat', 'John M Watkins']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Stage T1-2 prostate cancer: a multivariate analysis of factors affecting biochemical and clinical failures after radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Correlation of clinical and pathologic factors with rising prostate-specific antigen profiles after radical prostatectomy alone for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Radical prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate.']"""

The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a potent angiogenic factor and aberrant FGF signaling is a common property of tumors. Yet, how the aberration in cancer cells contributes to angiogenesis in the tumor is not well understood. Most studies of its angiogenic signaling mechanisms have been in endothelial cells. FGF receptor substrate 2α (FRS2α) is an FGF receptor-associated protein required for activation of downstream signaling molecules that include those in the mitogen-activated protein and AKT kinase pathways. Herein, we demonstrated that overactivation and hyperactivity of FRS2α, as well as overexpression of cJUN and HIF1α, were positively correlated with vessel density and progression of human prostate cancer (PCa) toward malignancy. We also demonstrate that FGF upregulated the production of vascular endothelial growth factor A mainly by increasing expression of cJUN and HIF1α. This then promoted recruitment of endothelial cells and vessel formation for the tumor. Tumor angiogenesis in mouse PCa tissues was compromised by tissue-specific ablation of Frs2α in prostate epithelial cells. Depletion of Frs2α expression in human PCa cells and in a preclinical xenograft model, MDA PCa 118b, also significantly suppressed tumor angiogenesis accompanied with decreased tumor growth in the bone. The results underscore the angiogenic role of FRS2α-mediated signaling in tumor epithelial cells in angiogenesis. They provide a rationale for treating PCa with inhibitors of FGF signaling. They also demonstrate the potential of overexpressed FRS2α as a biomarker for PCa diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapies.""","""['J Liu', 'P You', 'G Chen', 'X Fu', 'X Zeng', 'C Wang', 'Y Huang', 'L An', 'X Wan', 'N Navone', 'C-L Wu', 'W L McKeehan', 'Z Zhang', 'W Zhong', 'F Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Role of epithelial cell fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2alpha in prostate development, regeneration and tumorigenesis.', 'Pharmacologically targeting the myristoylation of the scaffold protein FRS2α inhibits FGF/FGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling and tumor progression.', 'Protein kinase Ds promote tumor angiogenesis through mast cell recruitment and expression of angiogenic factors in prostate cancer microenvironment.', 'Targeting Angiogenesis in Cancer Therapy: Moving Beyond Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor.', 'The roles of ADAMTS in angiogenesis and cancer.', 'Discovery of a small molecule ligand of FRS2 that inhibits invasion and tumor growth.', 'A novel risk score model based on five angiogenesis-related long non-coding RNAs for bladder urothelial carcinoma.', 'miRNA-34b/c regulates mucus secretion in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells by targeting FGFR1.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Fibroblast growth factors signaling in bone metastasis.']"""

The Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 was used to measure [Ca(2+)](i). Protriptyline evoked [Ca(2+)](i) rises concentration-dependently. The response was reduced by removing extracellular Ca(2+). Protriptyline-evoked Ca(2+) entry was inhibited by store-operated channel inhibitors (nifedipine, econazole and SKF96365), protein kinase C activator (phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate, PMA) and protein kinase C inhibitor (GF109203X).

Thirdly, systematic variations in collimator, couch and gantry angle plus MLC positioning were applied to four clinical treatments (two prostate, two head and neck cases) in order to establish the detection sensitivity of the three devices. Measurements were compared with TPS computed doses via gamma analysis (3%/3 mm and 2%/2 mm) with an agreement of at least 95% and 90% respectively in all pixels. Effect of the errors on the dose distributions was analyzed.  Results:   Repeatability and reproducibility were excellent for the three devices. The average pass rate for the 59 cases was superior to 98% for all devices with 3%/3 mm criteria. It was found that for the plans delivered with errors, the sensitivity was quite similar for all devices. Devices were able to detect a 2 mm opened or closed MLC error with 3%/3 mm tolerance level. An error of 3° in collimator, gantry or couch rotation was detected by the three devices using 2%/2 mm criteria.

The sequence of decisions is known as a dynamic treatment regime or treatment policy. We consider dynamic treatment regimes in settings where each subject's final outcome can be defined as the sum of longitudinally observed values, each corresponding to a stage of the regime. Q-learning, which is a backward induction method, is used to first optimize the last stage treatment then sequentially optimize each previous stage treatment until the first stage treatment is optimized. During this process, model-based expectations of outcomes of late stages are used in the optimization of earlier stages. When the outcome models are misspecified, bias can accumulate from stage to stage and become severe, especially when the number of treatment stages is large. We demonstrate that a modification of standard Q-learning can help reduce the accumulated bias. We provide a computational algorithm, estimators, and closed-form variance formulas. Simulation studies show that the modified Q-learning method has a higher probability of identifying the optimal treatment regime even in settings with misspecified models for outcomes. It is applied to identify optimal treatment regimes in a study for advanced prostate cancer and to estimate and compare the final mean rewards of all the possible discrete two-stage treatment sequences.""","""['Xuelin Huang', 'Sangbum Choi', 'Lu Wang', 'Peter F Thall']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Adaptive contrast weighted learning for multi-stage multi-treatment decision-making.', 'C-learning: A new classification framework to estimate optimal dynamic treatment regimes.', 'Dynamic regime marginal structural mean models for estimation of optimal dynamic treatment regimes, Part I: main content.', 'Inference for non-regular parameters in optimal dynamic treatment regimes.', 'Mathematical models of decision making and learning.', 'Accountable survival contrast-learning for optimal dynamic treatment regimes.', 'Step-adjusted tree-based reinforcement learning for evaluating nested dynamic treatment regimes using test-and-treat observational data.', 'TREE-BASED REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR ESTIMATING OPTIMAL DYNAMIC TREATMENT REGIMES.', 'A Bayesian Machine Learning Approach for Optimizing Dynamic Treatment Regimes.', 'Quantile-Optimal Treatment Regimes.']"""

Currently, there is a great diversity in practices regarding screening for occult cancer in a person who has an unprovoked venous thromboembolism. We sought to assess the efficacy of a screening strategy for occult cancer that included comprehensive computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis in patients who had a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism.  Methods:   We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial in Canada. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo limited occult-cancer screening (basic blood testing, chest radiography, and screening for breast, cervical, and prostate cancer) or limited occult-cancer screening in combination with CT. The primary outcome measure was confirmed cancer that was missed by the screening strategy and detected by the end of the 1-year follow-up period.  Results:   Of the 854 patients who underwent randomization, 33 (3.9%) had a new diagnosis of occult cancer between randomization and the 1-year follow-up: 14 of the 431 patients (3.2%) in the limited-screening group and 19 of the 423 patients (4.5%) in the limited-screening-plus-CT group (P=0.28). In the primary outcome analysis, 4 occult cancers (29%) were missed by the limited screening strategy, whereas 5 (26%) were missed by the strategy of limited screening plus CT (P=1.0). There was no significant difference between the two study groups in the mean time to a cancer diagnosis (4.2 months in the limited-screening group and 4.0 months in the limited-screening-plus-CT group, P=0.88) or in cancer-related mortality (1.4% and 0.9%, P=0.75).  Conclusions:   The prevalence of occult cancer was low among patients with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism.

Because of wide variability observed between physicians' ratings, many large-scale studies have been conducted to quantify agreement between multiple experts' ordinal classifications in common diagnostic procedures such as mammography. However, very few statistical approaches are available to assess agreement in these large-scale settings. Many existing summary measures of agreement rely on extensions of Cohen's kappa. These are prone to prevalence and marginal distribution issues, become increasingly complex for more than three experts, or are not easily implemented. Here we propose a model-based approach to assess agreement in large-scale studies based upon a framework of ordinal generalized linear mixed models. A summary measure of agreement is proposed for multiple experts assessing the same sample of patients' test results according to an ordered categorical scale. This measure avoids some of the key flaws associated with Cohen's kappa and its extensions. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the approach with comparison with commonly used agreement measures. The proposed methods are easily implemented using the software package R and are applied to two large-scale cancer agreement studies.""","""['Kerrie P Nelson', 'Don Edwards']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""[""Summary measures of agreement and association between many raters' ordinal classifications."", 'Evaluating the effects of rater and subject factors on measures of association.', 'Assessing the influence of rater and subject characteristics on measures of agreement for ordinal ratings.', 'A measure of association for ordered categorical data in population-based studies.', 'Statistical description of interrater variability in ordinal ratings.', 'Inter-rater reliability of the Infectious Disease Modeling Reproducibility Checklist (IDMRC) as applied to COVID-19 computational modeling research.', 'Inter and intra-observer agreement of arterial wall contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in giant cell arteritis.', 'The ESSENCE-Questionnaire in Medical Records Screening for Neurodevelopmental Symptoms/Problems: Utility and Clinical Validity.', 'Methods of assessing categorical agreement between correlated screening tests in clinical studies.', 'Wheat Spike Blast Image Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.']"""

Cellular microvesicle (MV) release, which is involved in cancer progression, and deimination have not been associated before. We hypothesize that elevated PAD expression, observed in cancers, causes increased MV release in cancer cells and contributes to cancer progression.  Background:   We have previously reported that inhibition of MV release sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. PAD2 and PAD4, the isozymes expressed in patients with malignant tumours, can be inhibited with the pan-PAD-inhibitor chloramidine (Cl-am). We sought to investigate whether Cl-am can inhibit MV release and whether this pathway could be utilized to further increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to drug-directed treatment.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cells (PC3) were induced to release high levels of MVs upon BzATP stimulation of P2X7 receptors. Western blotting with the pan-protein deimination antibody F95 was used to detect a range of deiminated proteins in cells stimulated to microvesiculate. Changes in deiminated proteins during microvesiculation were revealed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry identified deiminated target proteins with putative roles in microvesiculation.  Conclusion:   We report for the first time a novel function of PADs in the biogenesis of MVs in cancer cells. Our results reveal that during the stimulation of prostate cancer cells (PC3) to microvesiculate, PAD2 and PAD4 expression levels and the deimination of cytoskeletal actin are increased. Pharmacological inhibition of PAD enzyme activity using Cl-am significantly reduced MV release and abrogated the deimination of cytoskeletal actin. We demonstrated that combined Cl-am and methotrexate (MTX) treatment of prostate cancer cells increased the cytotoxic effect of MTX synergistically. Refined PAD inhibitors may form part of a novel combination therapy in cancer treatment.""","""['Sharad Kholia', 'Samireh Jorfi', 'Paul R Thompson', 'Corey P Causey', 'Anthony P Nicholas', 'Jameel M Inal', 'Sigrun Lange']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Extracell Vesicles""","""['Peptidylarginine Deiminase Inhibitor Application, Using Cl-Amidine, PAD2, PAD3 and PAD4 Isozyme-Specific Inhibitors in Pancreatic Cancer Cells, Reveals Roles for PAD2 and PAD3 in Cancer Invasion and Modulation of Extracellular Vesicle Signatures.', 'Peptidylarginine deiminases: novel drug targets for prevention of neuronal damage following hypoxic ischemic insult (HI) in neonates.', 'Peptidylarginine Deiminases Post-Translationally Deiminate Prohibitin and Modulate Extracellular Vesicle Release and MicroRNAs in Glioblastoma Multiforme.', 'Peptidylarginine Deiminases-Roles in Cancer and Neurodegeneration and Possible Avenues for Therapeutic Intervention via Modulation of Exosome and Microvesicle (EMV) Release?', 'Peptidylarginine deiminases and deiminated proteins at the epidermal barrier.', 'The Extracellular Vesicle Citrullinome and Signature in a Piglet Model of Neonatal Seizures.', 'Microparticle Phosphatidylserine Mediates Coagulation: Involvement in Tumor Progression and Metastasis.', 'Selective inhibition of peptidyl-arginine deiminase (PAD): can it control multiple inflammatory disorders as a promising therapeutic strategy?', 'Differential, Stage Dependent Detection of Peptidylarginine Deiminases and Protein Deimination in Lewy Body Diseases-Findings from a Pilot Study.', 'Padi2/3 Deficiency Alters the Epigenomic Landscape and Causes Premature Differentiation of Mouse Trophoblast Stem Cells.']"""

The detailed mechanisms, especially the involvement of stromal cells, remain unclear. We found that the recruited BM-MSCs might be able to convert the normal fibroblasts to more cancer associated fibroblast (CAF)-like characteristics via alteration of secreted TGFβ-1. The consequences of such conversion might then enhance the PCa growth and invasion. Addition of functional TGFβ-1 or interruption with TGFβ-1 inhibitor SB431542 led to alteration of the BM-MSCs-induced CAF conversion and influence on the PCa cell growth and invasion. Together, these results suggest that BM-MSCs not only can be directly recruited by PCa epithelial cells to promote PCa invasion, they can also go through conversion of normal fibroblasts to CAFs to enhance PCa cell growth and invasion. Targeting the infiltrating BM-MSCs via either interruption of the interaction between PCa and BM-MSCs or prevention of the conversion of NFs to CAFs via inhibition of TGFβ-1 signal may result in the suppression of PCa progression.""","""['Simeng Wen', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Shuyuan Yeh', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Infiltrating bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells increase prostate cancer stem cell population and metastatic ability via secreting cytokines to suppress androgen receptor signaling.', 'Infiltrating bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) increase prostate cancer cell invasion via altering the CCL5/HIF2α/androgen receptor signals.', 'Immortalized Cancer-associated Fibroblasts Promote Prostate Cancer Carcinogenesis, Proliferation and Invasion.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells as a double-edged sword in suppression or progression of solid tumor cells.', 'Fibroblasts as Turned Agents in Cancer Progression.', 'LRRC superfamily expression in stromal cells predicts the clinical prognosis and platinum resistance of ovarian cancer.', 'Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy of Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Malignancies.', 'The Changing Landscape of Systemic Treatment for Cervical Cancer: Rationale for Inhibition of the TGF-β and PD-L1 Pathways.', 'Metformin and sodium dichloroacetate effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolic activity tested alone and in combination in a canine prostate and a bladder cancer cell line.']"""

We compare the perioperative and early results of this technique with a cohort of patients simultaneously treated in our institution with four-port LRC and a 7 to 10 cm midline incision.  Materials and methods:   A matched-pair study comparing perioperative outcomes, postoperative visual analog pain scale (VAPS), and morbidity of two-port (n=30) and four-port (n=30) LRC. Preoperative and perioperative data analyzed and compared included demographics, type of urinary diversion, operative time, blood loss, transfusion requirements, decrease in serum hemoglobin, operative complications, analgesic needs, length of stay, number of nodes removed, and other pathologic information. Complications in the first 3 months were evaluated according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results:   There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding patient age, gender, body-mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Charlson comorbidity index, tumor stage, percent of positive nodes, positive margin rate, number of nodes retrieved, proportion of neobladders, secondary carcinoma in situ, incidental prostate cancer, or need of systemic chemotherapy. Median operative time was 20 minutes higher in the two-port procedure, but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.2). Estimated blood loss and differential hemoglobin change were lower in the two-port technique (each p=0.03), but no difference was detected regarding the intraoperative or postoperative transfusion rate. Length of hospital stay was also equivalent. Differences were not observed either in the number or severity of complications. VAPS at days 2, 3, and 5 was significantly lower for two-port LRC (p<0.01).  Conclusions:   Two-port LRC performed through an umbilical platform and an accessory 10-mm port seems technically equivalent to standard four-port LRC. Perioperative outcomes regarding hospital stay and complications are tantamount.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the anticancer activity of H. sabdariffa leaf extract (HLE) are poorly understood. The object of the study was to examine the anti-invasive potential of HLE. First, HLE was demonstrated to be rich in polyphenols. The results of wound-healing assay and in vitro transwell assay revealed that HLE dose-dependently inhibited the migration and invasion of human prostate cancer LNCaP (lymph node carcinoma of the prostate) cells under non-cytotoxic concentrations. Our results further showed that HLE exerted an inhibitory effect on the activity and expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). The HLE-inhibited MMP-9 expression appeared to be a consequence of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) inactivation because its DNA-binding activity was suppressed by HLE. Molecular data showed all these influences of HLE might be mediated via inhibition of protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt)/NF-kB/MMP-9 cascade pathway, as demonstrated by the transfection of Akt1 overexpression vector. Finally, the inhibitory effect of HLE was proven by its inhibition on the growth of LNCaP cells and the expressions of metastasis-related molecular proteins in vivo. These findings suggested that the inhibition of MMP-9 expression by HLE may act through the suppression of the Akt/NF-kB signaling pathway, which in turn led to the reduced invasiveness of the cancer cells.""","""['Chun-Tang Chiu', 'Jing-Hsien Chen', 'Fen-Pi Chou', 'Hui-Hsuan Lin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nutrients""","""['Tianeptine sodium salt suppresses TNF-α-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in human carcinoma cells via suppression of the PI3K/Akt-mediated NF-κB pathway.', 'Camptothecin suppresses expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor in DU145 cells through PI3K/Akt-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activity and Nrf2-dependent induction of HO-1 expression.', 'Suppression of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced tumor cell invasion by bergamottin via the inhibition of protein kinase Cdelta/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and JNK/nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression.', 'Insight into the molecular evidence supporting the remarkable chemotherapeutic potential of Hibiscus sabdariffa L.', ""Mechanisms of Action of Nutritionally Rich Hibiscus sabdariffa's Therapeutic Uses in Major Common Chronic Diseases: A Literature Review."", 'Antioxidants in Traditional Mexican Medicine and Their Applications as Antitumor Treatments.', 'Advances in Molecular Regulation of Prostate Cancer Cells by Top Natural Products of Malaysia.', 'Screening the possible anti-cancer constituents of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis flower to address mammalian target of rapamycin: an in silico molecular docking, HYDE scoring, dynamic studies, and pharmacokinetic prediction.', 'Synergistic Cytotoxic and Antimigratory Effect of Brazilein and Doxorubicin on HER2-Overexpressing Cells.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.']"""

Here we investigated whether expression of intrinsic microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1) enhanced aggressiveness of PCa cells and might be critical for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated tumour progression. In PCa, overexpression of EGFR promotes metastatic invasion and correlates with a high Gleason score, while prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been reported to modulate oncogenic EGFR-driven oncogenicity. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that mPGES-1 in human prostate tissues is correlated with EGFR expression in advanced tumours. In DU145 and PC-3 cell lines expressing mPGES-1 (mPGES-1(SC) cells), we demonstrate that silencing or 'knock down' of mPGES-1 (mPGES-1(KD)) or pharmacological inhibition by MF63 strongly attenuates overall oncogenic drive. Indeed, mPGES-1(SC) cells express stem-cell-like features (high CD44, β1-integrin, Nanog and Oct4 and low CD24 and α6-integrin) as well as mesenchymal transition markers (high vimentin, high fibronectin, low E-cadherin). They also show increased capacity to survive irrespective of anchorage condition, and overexpress EGFR compared to mPGES-1(KD) cells. mPGES-1 expression correlates with increased in vivo tumour growth and metastasis. Although EGFR inhibition reduces mPGES-1(SC) and mPGES-1(KD) cell xenograft tumour growth, we show that mPGES-1/PGE2 signalling sensitizes tumour cells to EGFR inhibitors.

Its activity is found to be regulated by HDAC6. However, the significance of cortactin and HDAC6 remains unclear in uncommon histologic variant human prostatic foamy gland carcinoma (PfCa). In this study, we aimed to identify the expression and potential role of cortactin and HDAC6 in PfCa. Therefore, 16 PfCa specimens containing 48 foci with distinctive lesions were collected to identify the status of cortactin and HDAC6 by immunohistochemistry. Their correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic values were further analysed. The effect of cortactin and HDAC6 on prostate cancer cell migration and invasion was then evaluated in IA8 cells. The results showed that expression of cortactin and HDAC6 was significantly higher in PfCa foci, compared to that of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) foci and benign foci (P < 0.05). Cortactin and HDAC6 were associated with poor prognosis of patients with PfCa (P < 0.05). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed HDAC6 level was a significant prognostic factor for survival of patients with PfCa (β = 1.200, Wald value = 7.282, P = 0.007, 95% CI = 1.389-7.941, P < 0.01, β > 0). Both knocking down cortactin and inhibition of HDAC6 activity with tubacin reduced in vitro migration and invasion ability of IA8 cells substantially.

Nonetheless, specific and substantial physical, sexual, emotional and mental health problems often lead to a poor quality of life. Urology services increasingly struggle to cope with the demands of follow-up care, and primary care is likely to play the central role in long-term follow-up. The present phase II trial will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a nurse-led, person-centred psychoeducational intervention, delivered in community or primary care settings.  Methods and analysis:   Prostate cancer survivors diagnosed in the past 9-48 months and currently biochemically stable will be identified from hospital records by their treating clinician. Eligible men would have either completed radical treatment, or would be followed up with prostate specific antigen monitoring and symptom reporting. We will recruit 120 patients who will be randomised to receive either an augmented form of usual care, or an additional nurse-led intervention for a period of 36 weeks. Following the health policy in Wales, the intervention is offered by a key worker, is promoting prudent healthcare and is using a holistic needs assessment. Outcome measures will assess physical symptoms, psychological well-being, confidence in managing own health and quality of life. Healthcare service use will be measured over 36 weeks. Feedback interviews with patients and clinicians will further inform the acceptability of the intervention. Recruitment, attrition, questionnaire completion rates and outcome measures variability will be assessed, and results will inform the design of a future phase III trial and accompanying economic evaluation.  Ethics and dissemination:   Ethics approval was granted by Bangor University and North Wales REC (13/WA/0291).

The aim of this study was to assess the possible association between these genetic variants and PCa risk and progression in Serbian population. 355 samples of peripheral blood were obtained from the patients with PCa and 353 samples from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 312 volunteers derived from general population who gave samples of buccal swabs were included in the control group. Genotyping of rs3746444, rs11614913 and rs895819 was performed by using PCR-RFLP method, HRM analysis and allele-specific PCR, respectively. Allelic and genotypic associations were evaluated by unconditional linear (for serum PSA level in PCa patients) and logistic regression method with adjustment for age. Minor allele C of rs895819 was found to be associated with the increased risk of developing PCa under dominant (P=0.035; OR=1.38, 95%CI 1.02-1.86) and overdominant (P=0.04; OR=1.37, 95%CI 1.01-1.85) genetic model. Same genetic variant was found to be associated with the clinical stage of localized PCa, as well as with the presence of distant metastases. Allele G of rs3746444 was also shown to be associated with the decreased risk of PCa progression.

(11)C-choline and (18)F-fluoromethylcholine, though widely used, have poor sensitivity at low PSA levels. (68)Ga-PSMA (Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[(68)Ga-N,N'-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid]) has shown promising results in retrospective trials. Our aim was to prospectively compare the detection rates of (68)Ga-PSMA versus (18)F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT in men who were initially managed with radical prostatectomy, radiation treatment, or both and were being considered for targeted therapy.  Methods:   A sample of men with a rising PSA level after treatment, eligible for targeted treatment, was prospectively included. Patients on systemic treatment were excluded. (68)Ga-PSMA, (18)F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, and diagnostic CT were performed sequentially on all patients between January and April 2015, and the images were assessed by masked, experienced interpreters. The findings and their impact on management were documented, together with the results of histologic follow-up when feasible.  Results:   In total, 38 patients were enrolled. Of these, 34 (89%) had undergone radical prostatectomy and 4 (11%) had undergone radiation treatment. Twelve (32%) had undergone salvage radiation treatment after primary radical prostatectomy. The mean PSA level was 1.74 ± 2.54 ng/mL. The scan results were positive in 26 patients (68%) and negative with both tracers in 12 patients (32%). Of the 26 positive scans, 14 (54%) were positive with (68)Ga-PSMA alone, 11 (42%) with both (18)F-fluoromethylcholine and (68)Ga-PSMA, and only 1 (4%) with (18)F-fluoromethylcholine alone. When PSA was below 0.5 ng/mL, the detection rate was 50% for (68)Ga-PSMA versus 12.5% for (18)F-fluoromethylcholine. When PSA was 0.5-2.0 ng/mL, the detection rate was 69% for (68)Ga-PSMA versus 31% for (18)F-fluoromethylcholine, and when PSA was above 2.0, the detection rate was 86% for (68)Ga-PSMA versus 57% for (18)F-fluoromethylcholine. On lesion-based analysis, (68)Ga-PSMA detected more lesions than (18)F-fluoromethylcholine (59 vs. 29, P < 0.001). The tumor-to-background ratio in positive scans was higher for (68)Ga-PSMA than for (18)F-fluoromethylcholine (28.6 for (68)Ga-PSMA vs. 9.4 for (18)F-fluoromethylcholine, P < 0.001). There was a 63% (24/38 patients) management impact, with 54% (13/24 patients) being due to (68)Ga-PSMA imaging alone. Histologic follow-up was available for 9 of 38 patients (24%), and 9 of 9 (68)Ga-PSMA-positive lesions were consistent with prostate cancer ((68)Ga-PSMA was true-positive). The lesion positive on (18)F-fluoromethylcholine imaging and negative on (68)Ga-PSMA imaging was shown at biopsy to be a false-positive (18)F-fluoromethylcholine finding ((68)Ga-PSMA was true-negative).

Objective:   To compare MRF-TB and SB results and investigate the relationship between biopsy outcomes and prebiopsy MRI.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective analysis of a prospectively acquired cohort of men presenting for prostate biopsy over a 26-mo period. A total of 601 of 803 consecutively eligible men were included.  Interventions:   All men were offered prebiopsy MRI and assigned a maximum MRI suspicion score (mSS). Men with an MRI abnormality underwent combined MRF-TB and SB.  Outcomes:   Detection rates for all PCa and high-grade PCa (Gleason score [GS] ≥7) were compared using the McNemar test.  Results and limitations:   MRF-TB detected fewer GS 6 PCas (75 vs 121; p<0.001) and more GS ≥7 PCas (158 vs 117; p<0.001) than SB. Higher mSS was associated with higher detection of GS ≥7 PCa (p<0.001) but was not correlated with detection of GS 6 PCa. Prediction of GS ≥7 disease by mSS varied according to biopsy history. Compared to SB, MRF-TB identified more GS ≥7 PCas in men with no prior biopsy (88 vs 72; p=0.012), in men with a prior negative biopsy (28 vs 16; p=0.010), and in men with a prior cancer diagnosis (42 vs 29; p=0.043). MRF-TB detected fewer GS 6 PCas in men with no prior biopsy (32 vs 60; p<0.001) and men with prior cancer (30 vs 46; p=0.034). Limitations include the retrospective design and the potential for selection bias given a referral population.  Conclusions:   MRF-TB detects more high-grade PCas than SB while limiting detection of GS 6 PCa in men presenting for prostate biopsy. These findings suggest that prebiopsy multiparametric MRI and MRF-TB should be considered for all men undergoing prostate biopsy. In addition, mSS in conjunction with biopsy indications may ultimately help in identifying men at low risk of high-grade cancer for whom prostate biopsy may not be warranted.  Patient summary:   We examined how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted prostate biopsy compares to traditional systematic biopsy in detecting prostate cancer among men with suspicion of prostate cancer. We found that MRI-targeted biopsy detected more high-grade cancers than systematic biopsy, and that MRI performed before biopsy can predict the risk of high-grade cancer.""","""['Xiaosong Meng', 'Andrew B Rosenkrantz', 'Neil Mendhiratta', 'Michael Fenstermaker', 'Richard Huang', 'James S Wysock', 'Marc A Bjurlin', 'Susan Marshall', 'Fang-Ming Deng', 'Ming Zhou', 'Jonathan Melamed', 'William C Huang', 'Herbert Lepor', 'Samir S Taneja']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prebiopsy MRI and MRI-ultrasound Fusion-targeted Prostate Biopsy in Men With Previous Negative Biopsies: Impact on Repeat Biopsy Strategies.', 'The ultrasound characteristics of regions identified as suspicious by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predict the likelihood of clinically significant cancer on MRI-ultrasound fusion-targeted biopsy.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Prostate Biopsy in a Consecutive Cohort of Men with No Previous Biopsy: Reduction of Over Detection through Improved Risk Stratification.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Significance of MRI/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Three-Dimensional Model-Guided, Targeted Biopsy Based on Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Systematic Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Detection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Learning curve for magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy in detecting prostate cancer using cumulative sum analysis.', 'Prostate imaging-reporting and data system version 2 in combination with clinical parameters for prostate cancer detection: a single center experience.', 'Cost-effectiveness of an urinary biomarker panel in combination with MRI for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Temporal changes of PIRADS scoring by radiologists and correlation to radical prostatectomy pathological outcomes.', 'Usefulness of grayscale values of hypoechoic lesions matched with target lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging for the prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer.']"""

In the present study, the apoptotic mechanism of Vitisin A plus TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in prostate cancer cells was elucidated.  Methods:   The cytotoxicity of Vitisin A and/or TRAIL against PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells was measured by MTT colorimetric assay. Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit was used to detect apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. Intracellular levels of ROS were measured by flow cytometry using 2070-diacetyl dichlorofluorescein (DCFDA).  Results:   Combined treatment with Vitisin A and TRAIL enhanced cytotoxicity and also increased sub-G1 population in PC-3 cells better than DU145 or LNCap prostate cancer cells. Similarly, Annexin V and PI staining revealed that combination increased early and late apoptosis in PC-3 cells compared to untreated control. Consistently, combination attenuated the expression of pro-caspases 7/8, DcR1, Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 and activated caspase 3, FADD, DR5 and DR4 in PC-3 cells. Also, combination increased DR5 promoter activity compared to untreated control. Furthermore, combination increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DR5 cell surface expression. The ROS inhibitor NAC and silencing of DR5 by siRNA transfection inhibited the ability of combination to induce PARP cleavage and generate ROS.  Conclusion:   These findings provide evidence that Vitisin A can be used in conjunction with TRAIL as a potent TRAIL sensitizer for synergistic apoptosis induction via upregulation of DR5 and production of ROS in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Deokil Shin', 'Hee-Young Kwon', 'Eun Jung Sohn', 'Moon Sik Nam', 'Jung Hyo Kim', 'Jae Chul Lee', 'Shi-Yong Ryu', 'Byungchun Park', 'Sung-Hoon Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['Quinacrine induces apoptosis in cancer cells by forming a functional bridge between TRAIL-DR5 complex and modulating the mitochondrial intrinsic cascade.', 'Casticin, a flavonoid, potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis through modulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and death receptor 5 in colon cancer cells.', 'Upregulation of microRNA135a-3p and death receptor 5 plays a critical role in Tanshinone I sensitized prostate cancer cells to TRAIL induced apoptosis.', 'Down-regulation of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, particularly c-FLIP by therapeutic agents; the novel view to overcome resistance to TRAIL.', 'Regulation of Cancer Metastasis by TRAIL/Death Receptor Signaling.', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'Screening of Natural Stilbene Oligomers from Vitis vinifera for Anticancer Activity on Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.', 'The fungal metabolite chaetocin is a sensitizer for pro-apoptotic therapies in glioblastoma.', 'Suppression of miR-4735-3p in androgen receptor-expressing prostate cancer cells increases cell death during chemotherapy.', 'Securinine from Phyllanthus glaucus Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Human Cervical Cancer HeLa Cells.']"""

The proposed manipulator takes advantage of four sliders actuated by MRI-compatible piezoelectric motors and incremental rotary encoders. Errors, mostly originating from the design and manufacturing process, need to be identified and reduced before the robot is deployed in clinical trials.  Results:   The manipulator has undergone several experiments to evaluate the repeatability and accuracy (about 1 mm in air (in x or y direction) at the needle's reference point) of needle placement, which is an essential concern in percutaneous prostate interventions.

One vaccine, Prostvac-VF®, using a heterologous prime-boost strategy with vaccinia and fowlpox viral vectors encoding PSA, is currently being evaluated in a registration phase III multinational clinical trial. The current trial was planned to assess the clinical efficacy of this vaccine in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer receiving subsequent docetaxel chemotherapy. 10 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, with a predicted survival of at least 18 months, were enrolled out of a planned 144 patients. Eight of 10 patients were treated and were randomized to receive docetaxel chemotherapy alone (Arm B, n = 2) versus treatment with Prostvac-VF (days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57) followed by docetaxel (Arm A, n = 6) chemotherapy beginning at month 3. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival, and secondary endpoints included time to radiographic progression and immunological response. The trial was opened within the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, but due to slow accrual was closed by CTEP after only 10 patients were enrolled within 13 months.  Results:   Presented here are the safety, clinical, and immunological results from 8 eligible patients who underwent treatment. Two of 6 patients treated on Arm A, with vaccine followed by docetaxel, had a >50% PSA response, with one of these patients experiencing a PSA decline during treatment with vaccine. Significant PSA-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and IgG antibody responses specific for PSA were not detected. The primary endpoint of overall survival cannot be assessed due to limited accrual. The lack of T-cell responses, even in this small cohort, suggests that further validation and development of immune biomarkers will be important for future studies.

Prior work has assumed a constant negative relationship between physician supply and mortality outcomes throughout the US and has not addressed regional variation.  Methods:   In this ecological analysis, geographically weighted regression was used to identify spatially varying relationships between local urologist density and prostate cancer mortality at the county level. Data from 1,492 counties in 30 eastern and southern states from 2006-2010 were analyzed.  Findings:   The ordinary least squares (OLS) regression found that, on average, increasing urologist density by 1 urologist per 100,000 people resulted in an expected decrease in prostate cancer mortality of -0.499 deaths per 100,000 men (95% CI -0.709 to -0.289, p-value < 0.001), or a 1.5% decrease. Geographic weighted regression demonstrated that the addition of one urologist per 100,000 people in counties in the southern Mississippi River states of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, as well as parts of Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin is associated with decrease of 0.411 to 0.916 in prostate cancer mortality per 100,000 men (1.6-3.6%). In contrast, the urologist density was not significantly associated with the prostate state mortality in the new England region.

In males, the most common cancers were those of the prostate, Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and the liver. Prostate cancer showed the most dramatic increase over the whole study period (AAPC +11.3%; 95% CI: 9.7-13.0), with an ASR of 61.7 per 105 in 2003-2008. In females, the most frequent cancers were of the uterine cervix, the breast and KS, with the former increasing along the whole study period (AAPC + 4.7%; 95% CI: 3.4-6) with an ASR of 62.0 per 105 in 2003-2008 as well as breast cancer (AAPC +6.5%; 95%CI: 4.3-8.7).  Conclusions:   Overall, the risk of cancer rose in both sexes during the study period, particularly among cancers associated with westernization of lifestyles (prostate, breast), combined with increasingly rising incidences or limited changes in cancers associated with infection and poverty (uterine cervix, liver). Moreover, the burden of AIDS-associated cancers has shown a marked increase.""","""['Cesaltina Lorenzoni', 'Alba Vilajeliu', 'Carla Carrilho', 'Mamudo R Ismail', 'Paola Castillo', 'Orvalho Augusto', 'Alberto L García-Basteiro', 'Mohsin Sidat', 'Silvia de Sanjosé', 'Clara Menéndez', 'Jaume Ordi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Trends in the incidence of cancer in the black population of Harare, Zimbabwe 1991-2010.', 'Cancer risk in people infected with human immunodeficiency virus in the United States.', 'Cancer in Kampala, Uganda, in 1989-91: changes in incidence in the era of AIDS.', 'Cancer in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020: a review of current estimates of the national burden, data gaps, and future needs.', 'Changes in the Incidence of Cancer in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe over a 50-Year Period.', 'Oncology in Mozambique: Overview of the Diagnostic, Treatment, and Research Capacity.', 'Penile Squamous Cell Carcinomas in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe: Differential Etiopathogenesis.', 'Prevalence of hepatitis B virus and immunity status among healthcare workers in Beira City, Mozambique.', 'Differential etiopathogenic features of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas in sub-Saharan Africa and Europe.', 'Burden of mortality from cancer among adults in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, using verbal autopsy, 2007-2017.']"""

Nevertheless, the development of specific therapies against CSCs is hindered by the scarcity of these cells in prostate tissues. Suspension culture systems have been reported to enrich CSCs in primary cultures and cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been fully explored.  Methodology/principal findings:   We describe a prostasphere assay for the enrichment of CD133+ CSCs in four commercial PCa cell lines: 22Rv1, DU145, LNCaP, and PC3. Overexpression of CD133, as determined by flow cytometric analysis, correlated with an increased clonogenic, chemoresistant, and invasive potential in vitro. This phenotype is concordant to that of CSCs in vivo. Gene expression profiling was then carried out using the Cancer Reference panel and the nCounter system from NanoString Technologies. This analysis revealed several upregulated transcripts that can be further explored as potential diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets. Furthermore, functional annotation analysis suggests that ΔNp63α modulates the activation of developmental pathways responsible for the increased stem identity of cells growing in suspension cultures.  Conclusions/significance:   We conclude that profiling the genetic mechanisms involved in CSC enrichment will help us to better understand the molecular pathways that underlie CSC pathophysiology. This platform can be readily adapted to enrich and assay actual patient samples, in order to design patient-specific therapies that are aimed particularly against CSCs.""","""['Roberto Portillo-Lara', 'Mario Moisés Alvarez']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cancer stem cell differentiation: TGFβ1 and versican may trigger molecules for the organization of tumor spheroids.', 'Enrichment of prostate cancer stem-like cells from human prostate cancer cell lines by culture in serum-free medium and chemoradiotherapy.', 'Phenotypic subpopulations of metastatic colon cancer stem cells: genomic analysis.', 'Targeting CD133 antigen in cancer.', 'How powerful is CD133 as a cancer stem cell marker in brain tumors?', 'The dual role of p63 in cancer.', 'Stem cells from a malignant rat prostate cell line generate prostate cancers in vivo: a model for prostate cancer stem cell propagated tumor growth.', 'Radioresistance Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines Surviving Ultra-Hypo-Fractionated EBRT: Implications and Possible Clinical Applications.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: The Role of CD133.', 'EWI2 prevents EGFR from clustering and endocytosis to reduce tumor cell movement and proliferation.']"""

This study assessed the accuracy and consistency of automated soft tissue localisation using XVI's dual registration tool (DRT).  Methods:   Sixty CBCT images from ten post-prostatectomy patients were matched using: (i) the DRT and (ii) manual soft tissue registration by six radiation therapists (RTs). Shifts in the three Cartesian planes were recorded. The accuracy of the match was determined by comparing shifts to matches performed by two genitourinary radiation oncologists (ROs). A Bland-Altman method was used to assess the 95% levels of agreement (LoA). A clinical threshold of 3 mm was used to define equivalence between methods of matching.  Results:   The 95% LoA between DRT-ROs in the superior/inferior, left/right and anterior/posterior directions were -2.21 to +3.18 mm, -0.77 to +0.84 mm, and -1.52 to +4.12 mm, respectively. The 95% LoA between RTs-ROs in the superior/inferior, left/right and anterior/posterior directions were -1.89 to +1.86 mm, -0.71 to +0.62 mm and -2.8 to +3.43 mm, respectively. Five DRT CBCT matches (8.33%) were outside the 3-mm threshold, all in the setting of bladder underfilling or rectal gas. The mean time for manual matching was 82 versus 65 s for DRT.  Conclusions:   XVI's DRT is comparable with RTs manually matching soft tissue on CBCT. The DRT can minimise RT inter-observer variability; however, involuntary bladder and rectal filling can influence the tools accuracy, highlighting the need for RT evaluation of the DRT match.""","""['Amelia Campbell', 'Rebecca Owen', 'Elizabeth Brown', 'David Pryor', 'Anne Bernard', 'Margot Lehman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Implementing daily soft tissue image guidance with reduced margins for post-prostatectomy radiotherapy: research-based changes to clinical practice.', 'Assessment of cone beam CT registration for prostate radiation therapy: fiducial marker and soft tissue methods.', 'Does Interfraction Cone Beam Computed Tomography Improve Target Localization in Prostate Bed Radiotherapy?', 'Prostate bed motion may cause geographic miss in post-prostatectomy image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Determining optimal planning target volume and image guidance policy for post-prostatectomy intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'Improving the registration stability of cone-beam computed tomography with the Sphere-Mask Optical Positioning System: a feasibility study.', 'Evaluation of the XVI dual registration tool for image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'IMPACT OF THREE DIFFERENT MATCHING METHODS ON PATIENT SET-UP ERROR IN X-RAY VOLUMETRIC IMAGING FOR HEAD AND NECK CANCER.', 'Implementing daily soft tissue image guidance with reduced margins for post-prostatectomy radiotherapy: research-based changes to clinical practice.', 'Study to Compare the Effect of Different Registration Methods on Patient Setup Uncertainties in Cone-beam Computed Tomography during Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy for Breast Cancer Patients.']"""

However, studies of sirolimus and cancer incidence in kidney recipients have not been definitive, and have had limited ability to examine specific cancer types. The literature was systematically reviewed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of kidney recipients that compared sirolimus users to sirolimus nonusers. Meta-analytic methods were used to obtain pooled estimates of the association between sirolimus use and incidence of total cancer and specific cancer types. Estimates were stratified by study type (RCT vs. observational) and use of cyclosporine (an immunosuppressant that affects DNA repair). Twenty RCTs and two observational studies were eligible for meta-analysis, including 39,039 kidney recipients overall. Sirolimus use was associated with lower overall cancer incidence (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.56-0.90), driven by a reduction in incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC, IRR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.32-0.76). The protective effect of sirolimus on NMSC risk was most notable in studies comparing sirolimus against cyclosporine (IRR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.04-0.84). After excluding NMSCs, there was no overall association between sirolimus and incidence of other cancers (IRR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.69-1.63). However, sirolimus use had associations with lower kidney cancer incidence (IRR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.20-0.81), and higher prostate cancer incidence (IRR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.17-2.91). Among kidney recipients, sirolimus users have lower NMSC risk, which may be partly due to removal of cyclosporine.

Patients and methods:   Cases were 1933 men with incident PCa, diagnosed across Montreal hospitals between 2005 and 2009. Population controls were 1994 men from the same residential area and age distribution. In-person interviews collected information about socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and medical history, e.g., self-reported history of several genitourinary infections, as well as on PCa screening. Logistic regression analyses tested overall and grade-specific associations, including subgroup analyses with frequent PSA testing.  Results:   After multivariable adjustment, prostatitis was associated with an increased risk of any PCa (OR 1.81 [1.44-2.27]), but not urethritis (OR 1.05 [0.84-1.30]), orchitis (OR 1.28 [0.92-1.78]) or epididymitis (OR 0.98 [0.57-1.68]).

Adjusting for frequency of physician visits, PSA testing frequency or restricting analyses to frequently screened subjects did not affect these results.

Current options for PC therapy remain unsatisfactory, since they often produce uncomfortable long-term side effects, such as impotence (70%) and incontinence (5-20%) even in the first stages of the disease. Light-triggered therapies, such as photodynamic therapy, have the potential to provide important advances in the treatment of localized and partially metastasized prostate cancer. We have designed a novel molecular conjugate (DR2) constituted of a photosensitizer (pheophorbide a, Pba), connected to a nonsteroidal anti-androgen molecule through a small pegylated linker. This study aims at investigating whether DR2 represents a valuable approach for PC treatment based on light-induced production of single oxygen and nitric oxide (NO) in vitro. Besides being able to efficiently bind the androgen receptor (AR), the 2-trifluoromethylnitrobenzene ring on the DR2 backbone is able to release cytotoxic NO under the exclusive control of light, thus augmenting the general photodynamic effect. Although DR2 is similarly internalized in cells expressing different levels of androgen receptor, the AR ligand prevents its efflux through the ABCG2-pump. In vitro phototoxicity experiments demonstrated the ability of DR2 to kill cancer cells more efficiently than Pba, while no dark toxicity was observed.

DNA samples from male patients included in the Mayo Clinic Biobank (MCB) were genotyped to determine the frequency of the G84E mutation and its association with various cancers.  Methods:   Subjects were genotyped using a custom TaqMan (Applied Biosystems) assay for G84E (rs138213197). In addition to donating a blood specimen, all MCB participants completed a baseline questionnaire to collect information on medical history and family history of cancer.  Results:   Forty-nine of 9,012 male patients were carriers of G84E (0.5%). Thirty-one percent (n = 2,595) of participants had been diagnosed with cancer, including 51.1% of G84E carriers compared with just 30.6% of noncarriers (P = 0.004). G84E was most frequently observed among men with prostate cancer compared with men without cancer (P < 0.0001). However, the mutation was also more commonly observed in men with bladder cancer (P = 0.06) and leukemia (P = 0.01). G84E carriers were more likely to have a positive family history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative compared to noncarriers (36.2% vs. 16.0%, P = 0.0003).  Conclusions:   Our study confirms the association between the HOXB13 G84E variant and prostate cancer and suggests a novel association between G84E and leukemia and a suggestive association with bladder cancer. Future investigation is warranted to confirm these associations in order to improve our understanding of the role of germline HOXB13 mutations in human cancer.  Impact:   The associations between HOXB13 and prostate, leukemia, and bladder suggest that this gene is important in carcinogenesis.""","""['Jennifer L Beebe-Dimmer', 'Matthew Hathcock', 'Cecilia Yee', 'Linda A Okoth', 'Charles M Ewing', 'William B Isaacs', 'Kathleen A Cooney', 'Stephen N Thibodeau']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['A population-based assessment of germline HOXB13 G84E mutation and prostate cancer risk.', 'Prevalence of the HOXB13 G84E mutation in Danish men undergoing radical prostatectomy and its correlations with prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness.', 'Homeobox B13 G84E Mutation and Prostate Cancer Risk.', 'Screening for familial and hereditary prostate cancer.', 'Update on genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Hereditary cancer syndromes.', 'Germline Variants in DNA Damage Repair Genes and HOXB13 Among Black Patients With Early-Onset Prostate Cancer.', 'Acetylated HOXB13 Regulated Super Enhancer Genes Define Therapeutic Vulnerabilities of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Homologous Recombination Deficiency in Ovarian, Breast, Colorectal, Pancreatic, Non-Small Cell Lung and Prostate Cancers, and the Mechanisms of Resistance to PARP Inhibitors.', 'Clinical Significance of Gene Mutations and Polymorphic Variants and their Association with Prostate Cancer Risk in Polish Men.']"""

Accordingly, Multilocus Genetic Risk Scores (MGRSs) have been computed in previous studies in order to assess the cumulative association of multiple SNPs. When several SNPs have to be genotyped for each patient, using successive uniplex pyrosequencing reactions increases analytical reagent expenses and Turnaround Time (TAT). While a set of several pyrosequencing primers could theoretically be used to analyze multiplex amplicons, this would generate overlapping primer-specific pyro-signals that are visually uninterpretable.  Methods:   In the current study, two multiplex assays were developed consisting of a quadruplex (n=4) and a quintuplex (n=5) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) each followed by multiplex pyrosequencing analysis. The aim was to reliably but rapidly genotype a set of prostate cancer-related SNPs (n=9). The nucleotide dispensation order was selected using SENATOR software. Multiplex pyro-signals were analyzed using the new AdvISER-MH-PYRO software based on a sparse representation of the signal. Using uniplex assays as gold standard, the concordance between multiplex and uniplex assays was assessed on DNA extracted from patient blood samples (n = 10).  Results:   All genotypes (n=90) generated with the quadruplex and the quintuplex pyroquencing assays were perfectly (100 %) concordant with uniplex pyrosequencing. Using multiplex genotyping approach for analyzing a set of 90 patients allowed reducing TAT by approximately 75 % (i.e., from 2025 to 470 min) while reducing reagent consumption and cost by approximately 70 % (i.e., from ~229 US$ /patient to ~64 US$ /patient).  Conclusions:   This combination of quadruplex and quintuplex pyrosequencing and PCR assays enabled to reduce the amount of DNA required for multi-SNP analysis, and to lower the global TAT and costs of SNP genotyping while providing results as reliable as uniplex analysis. Using this combined multiplex approach also substantially reduced the production of waste material. These genotyping assays appear therefore to be biologically, economically and ecologically highly relevant, being worth to be integrated in genetic-based predictive strategies for better selecting patients at risk for prostate cancer. In addition, the same approach could now equally be transposed to other clinical/research applications relying on the computation of MGRS based on multi-SNP genotyping.""","""['Jérôme Ambroise', 'Valentina Butoescu', 'Annie Robert', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Jean-Luc Gala']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Med Genet""","""['Amplicon identification using SparsE representation of multiplex PYROsequencing signal (AdvISER-M-PYRO): application to bacterial resistance genotyping.', 'Development of a candidate method for forensic microbial genotyping using multiplex pyrosequencing combined with a universal biotinylated primer.', 'Multiplex PCR-pyrosequencing assay for genotyping CYP3A5 polymorphisms.', 'An overview of the use of SNaPshot for predicting blood group antigens.', 'Practical applications of DNA genotyping in diagnostic pathology.', 'Using a constraint-based regression method for relative quantification of somatic mutations in pyrosequencing signals: a case for NRAS analysis.', 'A qPCR and multiplex pyrosequencing assay combined with automated data processing for rapid and unambiguous detection of ESBL-producers Enterobacteriaceae.']"""

Most treatments to-date for metastatic PCa include androgen-deprivation therapy and second-generation anti-androgens such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide. However, a majority of patients eventually develop resistance to these therapies and relapse into the lethal, castration-resistant form of PCa to which no adequate treatment option remains. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop effective therapeutic agents toward this patient population. Imidazopyridines have recently been shown to possess Akt kinase inhibitory activity; thus in this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of novel imidazopyridine derivatives HIMP, M-MeI, OMP, and EtOP on different human castration-resistant PCa cells. Among these compounds, HIMP and M-MeI were found to possess selective dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition: they reduced castration-resistant PCa cell proliferation and spared benign prostate epithelial cells. Using LNCaP C-81 cells as the model system, these compounds also reduced colony formation as well as cell adhesion and migration, and M-MeI was the most potent in all studies. Further investigation revealed that while HIMP primarily inhibits PCa cell growth via suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, M-MeI can inhibit both PI3K/Akt and androgen receptor pathways and arrest cell growth in the G2 phase. Thus, our results indicate the novel compound M-MeI to be a promising candidate for castration-resistant PCa therapy, and future studies investigating the mechanism of imidazopyridine inhibition may aid to the development of effective anti-PCa agents.""","""['Matthew A Ingersoll', 'Anastesia S Lyons', 'Sakthivel Muniyan', ""Napoleon D'Cunha"", 'Tashika Robinson', 'Kyle Hoelting', 'Jennifer G Dwyer', 'Xiu R Bu', 'Surinder K Batra', 'Ming-Fong Lin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Antiproliferative activity of novel imidazopyridine derivatives on castration-resistant human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Statin derivatives as therapeutic agents for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Rooibos suppresses proliferation of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of Akt signaling.', 'Leading causes of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Identification of an Imidazopyridine-based Compound as an Oral Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader for Breast Cancer Therapy.', 'Mono-, Bis-, and Tris-Chelate Zn(II) Complexes with Imidazo1,5-apyridine: Luminescence and Structural Dependence.', 'The Anticancer Effects of Novel Imidazo1,2-aPyridine Compounds against HCC1937 Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting treatment options for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Novel imidazo1,2-apyridine inhibits AKT/mTOR pathway and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in melanoma and cervical cancer cells.']"""

It is formed on non-template basis, so, structure and functional activity of HS biosynthetic machinery is crucial for correct HS biosynthesis and post-synthetic modification. To reveal cancer-related changes in transcriptional pattern of HS biosynthetic system, the expression of HS metabolism-involved genes (EXT1/2, NDST1/2, GLCE, 3OST1/HS3ST1, SULF1/2, HPSE) in human normal (fibroblasts, PNT2) and cancer (MCF7, LNCaP, PC3, DU145, H157, H647, A549, U2020, U87, HT116, KRC/Y) cell lines and breast, prostate, colon tumors was studied. Real-time RT-PCR and Western-blot analyses revealed specific transcriptional patterns and expression levels of HS biosynthetic system both in different cell lines in vitro and cancers in vivo. Balance between transcriptional activities of elongation- and post-synthetic modification- involved genes was suggested as most informative parameter for HS biosynthetic machinery characterization. Normal human fibroblasts showed elongation-oriented HS biosynthesis, while PNT2 prostate epithelial cells had modification-oriented one. However, cancer epithelial cells demonstrated common tendency to acquire fibroblast-like elongation-oriented mode of HS biosynthetic system. Surprisingly, aggressive metastatic cancer cells (U2020, DU145, KRC/Y) retained modification-oriented HS biosynthesis similar to normal PNT2 cells, possibly enabling the cells to keep like-to-normal cell surface glycosylation pattern to escape antimetastatic control.

In this study, we addressed this problem by introducing a new analysis approach.  Method:   A planning computed tomography (CT) scan and 7 repeat cone-beam CT scans during the course of treatment were obtained for 19 prostate cancer patients who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. A single observer contoured the prostate gland only. To evaluate the local deformation of the prostate, it was divided into 12 manually defined segments. Prostate deformation was calculated using in-house developed software. The correlation between the displacement of the CoG and the local deformation of the prostate was evaluated using multiple regression analysis.  Results:   The mean value and standard deviation (SD) of the prostate deformation were 0.6 mm and 1.7 mm, respectively. For the majority of the patients, the local SD of the deformation was slightly lager in the superior and inferior segments. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the anterior-posterior displacement of the CoG of the prostate had a highly significant correlation with the deformations in the middle-anterior (p < 0.01) and middle-posterior (p < 0.01) segments of the prostate surface (R2 = 0.84). However, there was no significant correlation between the displacement of the CoG and the deformation of the prostate surface in other segments.

Gene expression profiling together with functional studies demonstrated that the molecular mechanism underlying the effect on tumor progression originates from HSF2 steering the switch between acinar morphogenesis and invasion. This is achieved by the regulation of genes connected to, for example, GTPase activity, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix and actin cytoskeleton dynamics.

Although older men have higher all cause mortality, they also have higher prostate cancer specific mortality. We hypothesized that older age is associated with an increased risk of Gleason score upgrading at confirmatory biopsy when controlling for prostate volume.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data on 1,130 patients with prostate cancer who were treated with active surveillance from 1991 through 2011. We included 646 patients with clinical Gleason 6 or less, stage T2a or less prostate cancer, a confirmatory biopsy within 2 years of diagnostic biopsy and prostate magnetic resonance imaging before confirmatory biopsy. The primary outcome was Gleason score upgrading to 7 or greater on confirmatory biopsy. We used logistic regression to estimate the effect of age on upgrading, adjusting for magnetic resonance imaging prostate volume and other potential confounders.  Results:   Median age was 66 years (IQR 61-72) and median magnetic resonance imaging prostate volume was 41 ml (IQR 29-55). At confirmatory biopsy disease was upgraded in 55 of 646 patients (9%) and unchanged in 290 (45%) and biopsy was negative in 297 (46%). Older age was associated with higher odds of upgrading (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09, p=0.009). Larger prostate volume was associated with lower odds of upgrading (adjusted OR 0.80/10 ml increase, 95% CI 0.7-0.9, p=0.012).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that older age is associated with an increased risk of misclassification on diagnostic biopsy. Older men who are interested in active surveillance should be counseled about the risks and benefits of confirmatory biopsy.""","""['Christopher B Anderson', 'Itay A Sternberg', 'Gal Karen-Paz', 'Philip H Kim', 'Daniel Sjoberg', 'Hebert Alberto Vargas', 'Karim Touijer', 'James A Eastham', 'Behfar Ehdaie']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Old men with prostate cancer have higher risk of Gleason score upgrading and pathological upstaging after initial diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging for predicting prostate biopsy findings in patients considered for active surveillance of clinically low risk prostate cancer.', 'Targeted Biopsy to Detect Gleason Score Upgrading during Active Surveillance for Men with Low versus Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Confirmatory Biopsy for Initiating Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer.', 'Old men with prostate cancer have higher risk of Gleason score upgrading and pathological upstaging after initial diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and clinical variables: Which is the best combination to predict reclassification in active surveillance patients?', 'Prostate Cancer: Is It a Battle Lost to Age?', 'Active Surveillance in Younger Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Influence of pathologist experience on positive surgical margins following radical prostatectomy.']"""

Objective:   To report on long-term biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, clinical recurrence (CR)-free survival, and salvage therapy rates in these patients. Given the heterogeneity of high-risk patients, a second objective was to stratify them according to their BCR risk (using preoperative parameters), in an effort to counsel them better preoperatively regarding their cancer control outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   We evaluated 1100 D'Amico high-risk PCa patients who underwent RARP between 2002 and 2013 at three tertiary care centers.  Outcome measures and statistical analyses:   Outcomes consisted of BCR-free survival, CR-free survival, and salvage therapy rates. Regression tree analysis stratified patients into novel risk groups based on preoperative characteristics and corresponding BCR risk. Kaplan-Meier curves estimated BCR-free survival, CR-free survival, and salvage therapy rates in the entire cohort and after stratification according to the novel risk groups (RGs).  Results and limitations:   Median age and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were 63 yr and 6.5 ng/ml, respectively. Biopsy Gleason score (GS) was ≥8 in 57.7%. Mean follow-up was 53 mo (median: 49 mo). At 10 yr, BCR-free survival, CR-free survival, and salvage therapy rates were 50%, 87%, and 37%, respectively. Regression tree analysis stratified patients into five novel RGs): RG1, very low risk (GS ≤6); RG2, low risk (PSA ≤10 ng/ml; GS: 7); RG3, intermediate risk (PSA ≤10 ng/ml; GS ≥8); RG4, high risk (PSA >10 ng/ml; GS: 7); RG5, very high risk (PSA >10 ng/ml; GS ≥8). In these RGs, the 10-yr BCR-free survival rates were 86%, 70%, 36%, 31%, and 26% (p<0.001), respectively; the 10-yr CR-free survival rates were 99%, 96%, 85%, 67%, and 55% (p<0.001), respectively; and the 10-yr salvage therapy rates were 9.8%, 16%, 42%, 47%, and 64% (p<0.001), respectively.  Conclusions:   Most patients with clinically high-risk PCa treated with RARP alone remain CR free at long term. Nonetheless, almost 37% of the patients at 10 yr require salvage therapy. Our novel tool allows accurate stratification of these heterogeneous patients according to their BCR, CR, and salvage therapy risks. This may help inform patients preoperatively about their cancer control outcomes postoperatively.  Patient summary:   Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy confers lasting long-term oncologic control in most high-risk prostate cancer patients.

Patients and methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify 383,039 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2004-2011. The percentage of patients diagnosed with low-, intermediate-, or high-risk disease or a Gleason score of 6, 7, or 8 to 10 was calculated by age range. As a secondary analysis, we examined whether this relationship was different in 2010-2011 versus 2007-2008 (before and after the 2009 publication of screening trials).  Results:   The probability of Gleason score 8 to 10 or high-risk disease increased significantly with increasing age. The percentage of Gleason score 8 to 10 disease among men ages 50 to 54, 70 to 74, and 80 to 84 years was 8.9%, 16.2%, and 28.5%, respectively, and the percentage of high-risk disease was 14.3%, 22.4%, and 38.7% (P < .001). There were similar relationships among men with stage T1c disease. In addition, older men experienced a significant increase in the relative probability of high-risk or high-grade disease from 2007-2008 to 2010-2011.  Conclusion:   In this large US-based cohort, older men had a much higher probability of high-grade or high-risk prostate cancer.

Triexponential analysis was performed to obtain three diffusion coefficients (Dp , Df , Ds ), as well as fractions (Fp , Ff , Fs ). Each diffusion parameter for cancerous lesions and normal tissues was compared and the relationship between diffusion parameters and Gleason score (GS) was assessed. K(trans) , Ve , and the ratios of intracellular components measured in histopathological specimens were compared with diffusion parameters.  Results:   Dp was significantly greater for cancerous lesions than normal peripheral zone (PZ) (P < 0.001), whereas Dp in transition zone (TZ) showed no significant difference (P = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -4.69-6.48).

Methods:   Using flow cytometry, we counted the CD4+ CD25 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells in the PBMCs of 62 PCa patients (5 cases of TNM stage I, 16 cases of stage II, 21 cases of stage III, and 20 cases of stage IV) and 42 normal healthy controls, and calculated their proportion in the CD4+ T-lymphocytes. We determined the levels of fast blood glucose (FBG) and fast insulin (FINS) for the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), obtained the serum IGF-1 level by ELISA, and analyzed the relationship of the count and proportion of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells with insulin resistance by comparison between the PCa patients and normal healthy controls.  Results:   Compared with the control group, the PCa patients showed significantly increased HOMA-IR (3.68 ± 1.42 vs 6.68 ± 1.66), decreased level of serum IGF-1 ([164.56 ± 30.58] vs [96.39 ± 21.21] ng/ml), and elevated count ([1.99 ± 0.78 ] x 10(7) vs [3.55 ± 0.29] x 10(7)) and proportion ([5.33 ± 0.65] vs [13.88 ± 0.96]%) of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 regulatory T cells in the PBMCs. The TNM stage was correlated positively with the count and percentage of CD4 + CD25+ Foxp3 + regulatory T cells and HOMA-IR, but negatively with the level of serum IGF-1. Meanwhile, the count and percentage of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells were found to have a positive correlation with HOMA-IR (r = 0.722 and 0.689, P < 0.01) but a negative correlation with the level of serum IGF-1 (r = -0.747 and -0.896, P < 0.01).

Here, we conducted serial measurements of AR-V7 and evaluated patterns of longitudinal AR-V7 dynamics over the course of multiple sequential therapies.  Patients and methods:   Metastatic prostate cancer patients treated at Johns Hopkins with AR-directed therapies or taxane chemotherapies underwent serial liquid biopsies for CTC-based AR-V7 analysis at baseline, during therapy, and at progression. We used a CTC enrichment platform followed by multiplexed reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect full-length androgen receptor and AR-V7 transcripts. Patients selected for inclusion in this report were those who provided ≥4 CTC samples, at least one of which was AR-V7 positive, over the course of ≥2 consecutive therapies.  Results:   We identified 14 patients who received a total of 37 therapies and contributed 70 CTC samples for AR-V7 analysis during a median follow-up period of 11 months. Three patients remained AR-V7 positive during the entire course of therapy. The remainder underwent transitions in AR-V7 status: there were eight instances of 'conversions' from AR-V7-negative to -positive status (during treatment with first-line androgen deprivation therapy, abiraterone, enzalutamide, and docetaxel), and six instances of 'reversions' from AR-V7-positive to -negative status (during treatment with docetaxel and cabazitaxel).  Conclusions:   AR-V7 is a dynamic marker, and transitions in AR-V7 status may reflect selective pressures on the tumor exerted by therapeutic interventions. While 'conversions' to AR-V7-positive status were observed with both AR-directed therapies and taxane chemotherapies, 'reversions' to AR-V7-negative status only occurred during taxane therapies.

To assess guideline recommended and observed PLND rates in a high-volume center cohort.  Methods:   We relied on the Martini-Clinic database and focused on patients treated with either ORP or RARP, between 2010 and 2013. Actual performed PLND was compared to European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline recommendation defined by nomogram predicted risk of lymph node invasion >5%. Categorical and multivariable logistic regression analyses targeted two endpoints: 1) probability of guideline recommended PLND and 2) probability of no PLND, when not recommended by EAU guideline.  Results:   Within 7868 PCa patients, adherence to EAU PLND guideline recommendation was 97.1% at ORP and 96.8% at RARP (p = 0.7). When PLND was not recommended, it was more frequently performed at RARP (71.6%) than at ORP (66.2%) (p = 0.002). Gleason score, PSA and number of positive biopsy cores were independent predictors for both either PLND when recommended, or no PLND when not recommended (all p < 0.05). Clinical tumor stage, age and surgical approach were also independent predictors for no PLND when not recommended (all p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Adherence of the indication to EAU guideline recommended PLND is high at this high-volume center. Neither ORP nor RARP represent a barrier for PLND, when recommended.

It remains unclear whether the combined approach using targeted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy (FUS-GB) and systematic TRUS-GB is superior to targeted MRI-guided in-bore biopsy (IB-GB) for PCa detection.  Objective:   To compare PCa detection between IB-GB alone and FUS-GB + TRUS-GB in patients with at least one negative TRUS-GB and prostate-specific antigen ≥4 ng/ml.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients were prospectively randomized after multiparametric prostate MRI to IB-GB (arm A) or FUS-GB + TRUS-GB (arm B) from November 2011 to July 2014.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The study was powered at 80% to demonstrate an overall PCa detection rate of ≥60% in arm B compared to 40% in arm A. Secondary endpoints were the distribution of highest Gleason scores, the rate of detection of significant PCa (Gleason ≥7), the number of biopsy cores to detect one (significant) PCa, the positivity rate for biopsy cores, and tumor involvement per biopsy core.  Results and limitations:   The study was halted after interim analysis because the primary endpoint was not met. The trial enrolled 267 patients, of whom 210 were analyzed (106 randomized to arm A and 104 to arm B). PCa detection was 37% in arm A and 39% in arm B (95% confidence interval for difference, -16% to 11%; p=0.7). Detection rates for significant PCa (29% vs 32%; p=0.7) and the highest percentage tumor involvement per biopsy core (48% vs 42%; p=0.4) were similar between the arms. The mean number of cores was 5.6 versus 17 (p<0.001). A limitation is the limited number of patients because of early cessation of accrual.  Conclusions:   This trial failed to identify an important improvement in detection rate for the combined biopsy approach over MRI-targeted biopsy alone. A prospective comparison between MRI-targeted biopsy alone and systematic TRUS-GB is justified.  Patient summary:   Our randomized study showed similar prostate cancer detection rates between targeted prostate biopsy guided by magnetic resonance imaging and the combination of targeted biopsy and systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. An important improvement in detection rates using the combined biopsy approach can be excluded.""","""['Christian Arsov', 'Robert Rabenalt', 'Dirk Blondin', 'Michael Quentin', 'Andreas Hiester', 'Erhard Godehardt', 'Helmut E Gabbert', 'Nikolaus Becker', 'Gerald Antoch', 'Peter Albers', 'Lars Schimmöller']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Omission of systematic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy from the MRI targeted approach in men with previous negative prostate biopsy might still be premature.', 'Re: Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Guided In-Bore Biopsy to MRI-Ultrasound Fusion and Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Biopsy in Patients with Prior Negative Biopsies.', 'Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in Biopsy-naive Men with Suspected Prostate Cancer Based on Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen Values: Results from a Randomized Prospective Blinded Controlled Trial.', 'Head-to-head Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Prostate Biopsy Versus Multiparametric Prostate Resonance Imaging with Subsequent Magnetic Resonance-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen: A Large Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2) is abundantly expressed in malignant prostatic tissue, and its gene, KLK2, is regulated by the androgen receptor. 11B6 is a murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against free human hK2. In this study, we performed a preclinical evaluation of (111)In-labelled 11B6 in mouse xenografts to investigate its potential in the clinical staging and assessment of metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   11B6 was radiolabelled with (111)In through CHX-A″-DTPA chelation. In vivo biodistribution and uptake of (111)In-DTPA-11B6 were measured until 168 h post-injection in NMRI nude mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP xenografts. The binding specificity to hK2 was evaluated by both in vivo competitive binding assays with excess non-labelled 11B6 and hK2-negative DU145 xenografts. SPECT/CT imaging of subcutaneous and intra-tibial LNCaP xenografts was used to visualize the tumours.  Results:   Tumour uptake of (111)In-DTPA-11B6 in LNCaP xenografts was 19% ± 0.78%IA/g at 48 h, giving a tumour-to-blood ratio of 1.6, which increases to 2.4 at 1 week post-injection. Accumulation was low in other organs except for the salivary glands, which is probably the result of cross-reactivity with mouse kallikreins. Significantly lower tumour accumulation was observed in competitive assays and DU145 xenografts. SPECT/CT imaging could clearly visualize the subcutaneous and intra-tibial LNCaP xenografts.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrates the potential of (111)In-DTPA-11B6 for the detection of metastatic prostate cancer and monitoring anti-androgen therapy, as it exhibits an increased uptake and accumulation in viable tumour when compared to normal tissue. A humanised version of the 11B6 monoclonal antibody is currently under evaluation.""","""['Oskar Vilhelmsson Timmermand', 'David Ulmert', 'Susan Evans-Axelsson', 'Kim Pettersson', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Hans Lilja', 'Sven-Erik Strand', 'Thuy A Tran']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['Quantitative In Vivo Imaging of the Androgen Receptor Axis Reveals Degree of Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Response.', 'Intratherapeutic biokinetic measurements, dosimetry parameter estimates, and monitoring of treatment efficacy using cerenkov luminescence imaging in preclinical radionuclide therapy.', 'Radioimmunotherapy of prostate cancer targeting human kallikrein-related peptidase 2.', ""111In-CHX-A''-DTPA-anti-mindin/RG-1 monoclonal antibody 19G9."", 'Human Kallikrein 2 (hK2) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA): two closely related, but distinct, kallikreins in the prostate.', 'Quantitative In Vivo Imaging of the Androgen Receptor Axis Reveals Degree of Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Response.', 'Role of Serine Proteases at the Tumor-Stroma Interface.', 'Remodelling of the tumour microenvironment by the kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'Expression and Clinical Significance of HKII and HIF-1α in Grade Groups of Prostate Cancer.', 'Novel Agents and Future Perspectives on Theranostics.']"""

Material and methods:   A multicentre observational study (AEU-PIEM/2014/0001) sponsored by the Spanish Association of Urology was conducted using their platform for multicentre studies. The clinical-pathological inclusion criteria were as follows: cT1a-cT3a, PSA ≤ 20 ng/ml, initial minimum biopsy of 10 cores, number of affected cores ≤ 3, 1st Gleason score of 3 and 2nd Gleason score ≤ 4 and a known prostate volume (in cc). A unified follow-up was not established for all recruiting centres; however, a survey was conducted that reflects the follow-up characteristics based on a number of tangible parameters that allow for their comparison. With the same philosophy of flexibility, the use of certain biomarkers and multiparametric MRI was not considered necessary for inclusion.  Results:   We describe the Registry's characteristics and possibilities, as well as the preliminary results from the 324 patients included in its first 5 months of operation in the 15 recruiting centres. We also report the clinical-pathological variables, biomarkers, radiodiagnosis technique and quality-of-life questionnaires considered for the database, as well as the possibilities for indefinite follow-up, remaining open to any active treatment recognized in clinical guidelines.  Conclusions:   The AEU-PIEM/2014/0001 represents an extremely useful tool for all Spanish urologists for multicentre clinical research. The registry will undoubtedly enable the dissemination of active surveillance of our patients in a more coordinated manner, thus maintaining the advantages of optimised opportunistic screening for prostate cancer without resulting in overtreatment.""","""['J Rubio-Briones', 'A Borque', 'L M Esteban', 'I Iborra', 'P A López', 'J M Gil', 'Y Pallás', 'Ll Fumadó', 'S Martínez-Breijo', 'V Chantada', 'E Gómez', 'C Quicios', 'C B Congregado', 'R Medina', 'M Ortiz', 'M Montesino', 'F Clar', 'J Soto', 'J M Campá']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Variability in the multicentre National Registry in Active Surveillance; a questionnaire for urologists.', 'Selecting men diagnosed with prostate cancer for active surveillance using a risk calculator: a prospective impact study.', 'Changes in Gleason score grading on serial follow-up biopsies in prostate cancer patients undergoing active surveillance.', 'Active surveillance: the Canadian experience.', 'The Prostate cancer Research International: Active Surveillance study.', 'The management of active surveillance in prostate cancer: validation of the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study risk calculator with the Spanish Urological Association Registry.']"""
